  - "Abstract\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is being extended to the edge
    of\n   operator networks including the network access nodes.  Separately,\n   network
    access nodes such as Passive Optical Network (PON) Optical\n   Line Terminations
    (OLTs) have evolved to support first-mile access\n   protection, where one or
    more physical OLTs provide first-mile\n   diversity to the customer edge.  Multihoming
    support is needed on the\n   MPLS-enabled PON OLT to provide resiliency for provided
    services.\n   This document describes the Multi-Chassis PON (MC-PON) protection\n
    \  architecture in MPLS and also specifies the Inter-Chassis\n   Communication
    Protocol (ICCP) extension to support it.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is being extended to
    the edge of\n   operator networks, as is described in the multi-segment pseudowires\n
    \  (PWs) with Passive Optical Network (PON) access use case [RFC6456].\n   Combining
    MPLS with Optical Line Termination (OLT) access further\n   facilitates a low-cost,
    multi-service convergence.\n   Tens of millions of Fiber-to-the-x (FTTx) (x =
    H for home, P for\n   premises, C for curb) lines have been deployed over the
    years, with\n   many of those lines being some PON variant.  PON provides operators
    a\n   cost-effective solution for delivering high bandwidth (1 Gbps or even\n
    \  10 Gbps) to a dozen or more subscribers simultaneously.\n   In the past, access
    technologies such as PON and Digital Subscriber\n   Line (DSL) are usually used
    for subscribers, and no redundancy is\n   provided in their deployment.\n   But,
    with the rapid growth of mobile data traffic, more and more Long\n   Term Evolution
    (LTE) small cells and Wi-Fi hotspots are deployed.\n   PON is considered a viable
    low-cost backhaul solution for these\n   mobile services.  Besides its high bandwidth
    and scalability, PON\n   further provides frequency and time-synchronization features,
    e.g.,\n   SyncE [G.8261] and IEEE 1588v2 [IEEE-1588] functionality, which can\n
    \  fulfill synchronization needs of mobile backhaul services.\n   The Broadband
    Forum specifies reference architecture for mobile\n   backhaul networks using
    MPLS transport in [TR-221] where PON can be\n   the access technology.\n   Unlike
    typical residential service where a single or handful of end-\n   users hang off
    a single PON OLT port in a physical optical\n   distribution network, a PON port
    that supports a dozen LTE small\n   cells or Wi-Fi hotspots could be providing
    service to hundreds of\n   simultaneous subscribers.  Small-cell backhaul often
    demands the\n   economics of a PON first mile and yet expects first-mile protection\n
    \  commonly available in a point-to-point access portfolio.\n   Some optical layer
    protection mechanisms, such as Trunk and Tree\n   protection, are specified in
    [IEEE-1904.1] to avoid a single point of\n   failure in the access.  They are
    called Type B and Type C protection,\n   respectively, in [G.983.1].\n   Trunk
    protection architecture is an economical PON resiliency\n   mechanism, where the
    working OLT and the working link between the\n   working splitter port and the
    working OLT (i.e., the working trunk\n   fiber) is protected by a redundant protection
    OLT and a redundant\n   trunk fiber between the protection splitter port and the
    protection\n   OLT; however, it only protects a portion of the optical path from
    OLT\n   to Optical Network Units (ONUs).  This is different from the more\n   complex
    and costly Tree protection architecture where there is a\n   working optical distribution
    network path from the working OLT and a\n   complete protected optical distribution
    network path from the\n   protection OLT to the ONUs.  Figure 1 depicts a typical
    scenario of\n   Trunk protection.\n                           |                                 |\n

    \                 Figure 1: Trunk Protection Architecture in PON\n   Besides small-cell
    backhaul, this protection architecture can also be\n   applicable to other services,
    for example, DSL and Multiple System\n   Operator (MSO) services.  In that case,
    an ONU in Figure 1 can play\n   the similar role as a Digital Subscriber Line
    Access Multiplexer\n   (DSLAM) or a Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification
    (DOCSIS)\n   Remote Physical Layer (PHY) device [remote-phy], and it may further\n
    \  be attached with dozens of Customer Premises devices.\n   In some deployments,
    it is also possible that only some ONUs need to\n   be protected.\n   The PON
    architecture as depicted in Figure 1 can provide redundancy\n   in its physical
    topology; however, all traffic, including link\n   Operation Administration and
    Maintenance (OAM), is blocked on the\n   protection link, which frustrates end-to-end
    protection mechanisms\n   such as those specified in ITU-T G.8031 [G.8031].  Therefore,
    some\n   standard signaling mechanisms are needed between OLTs to exchange\n   information,
    for example, PON link status, registered ONU\n   information, and network status,
    so that protection and restoration\n   can be done rapidly and reliably, especially
    when the OLTs also\n   support MPLS.\n   ICCP [RFC7275] provides a framework for
    inter-chassis synchronization\n   of state and configuration data between a set
    of two or more Provider\n   Edges (PEs).  Currently, ICCP only defines application-specific\n
    \  messages for Pseudowire Redundancy (PW-RED) and Multi-Chassis LACP\n   (mLACP),
    but it can be easily extended to support PON as an\n   Attachment Circuit (AC)
    redundancy.\n   This document proposes the extension of ICCP to support multi-\n
    \  chassis PON protection in MPLS.\n"

  - "3.  Considerations on PON ONU Database Synchronization\n   Without an effective
    mechanism to communicate the registered ONUs\n   between the working and protection
    OLT, all registered ONUs would be\n   de-registered and go through re-registration
    during a switchover,\n   which would significantly increase protection time.  To
    enable faster\n   switchover capability, the working and protection OLTs need
    to know\n   about the protected ONUs.  To enable service continuity, a mechanism\n
    \  needs to be employed such that the operational state and significant\n   configuration
    data of both the protected ONU and the services\n   provisioned to it can be distributed
    to the working and protection\n   OLT.\n   The specific ONU's configuration and
    operational data can be\n   synchronized by some policy mechanism or provisioned
    in the\n   management plane.  Alternatively, said synchronization could occur
    by\n   some other signaling options.  Describing how to synchronize the\n   configuration
    objects associated with both protected ONU as well as\n   the services constructed
    to the ONU (e.g., ONU MAC address, IPv4\n   addresses, IPv6 addresses, VLAN identifiers,
    etc.) is outside of the\n   scope of this document.\n"

    - "4.1.  Protection Procedure upon PON Link Failures\n   When a fault is detected
      on a working PON link, a working OLT\n   switches to the corresponding protection
      PON link attached with its\n   protection OLT, i.e., the working OLT turns off
      its faulty PON\n   interface so that the protection trunk link to its protection
      OLT can\n   be activated.  Then, the working OLT MUST send an LDP fault\n   notification
      message (i.e., with the status bit \"Local AC (ingress)\n   Receive Fault\"
      being set) to its peer PE on the remote end of the PW.\n   At the same time,
      the working OLT MUST send an ICCP message with PON\n   State TLV with Local
      PON Port State being set to notify the\n   protection OLT of the PON fault.\n
      \  Upon receiving a PON state TLV where Local PON Port State is set, a\n   protection
      OLT MUST activate the protection PON link in the\n   protection group and advertise
      a notification message for the\n   protection PW with the Preferential Forwarding
      status bit of active\n   to the remote PE.\n   According to [RFC6870], the remote
      PE(s) can match the local and\n   remote Preferential Forwarding status and
      select PW2 as the new\n   active PW over which data traffic is sent.\n"

    - "4.2.  Protection Procedure upon PW Failures\n   Usually, MPLS networks have
      their own protection mechanism such as\n   Label Switched Path (LSP) protection
      or Fast Reroute (FRR).  But, in\n   a link-sparse access or aggregation network
      where protection for a PW\n   is impossible in its LSP layer, the following
      PW layer protection\n   procedures can be enabled.\n   When a fault is detected
      on its working PW (e.g., by Virtual Circuit\n   Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
      Bidirectional Forwarding Detection\n   (BFD)), a working OLT SHOULD turn off
      its associated PON interface\n   and then send an ICCP message with PON State
      TLV with Local PON Port\n   State being set to notify the protection OLT of
      the PON fault.\n   Upon receiving a PON state TLV where Local PON Port State
      is set, the\n   protection OLT MUST activate its PON interface to the protection\n
      \  trunk fiber.  At the same time, the protection OLT MUST send a\n   notification
      message for the protection PW with the Preferential\n   Forwarding status bit
      of active to the remote PE, so that traffic can\n   be switched to the protection
      PW.\n"

      OLT, it SHOULD send an LDP notification\n   message on the protection PW with
      the Request Switchover bit set.\n   Upon receiving an LDP notification message
      from its remote PE with\n   the Request Switchover bit set, a protection OLT
      MUST activate its\n   optical interface to the protection trunk fiber and activate
      the\n   associated protection PW, so that traffic can be reliably switched to\n

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Similar to ICCP itself, this ICCP application
    SHOULD only be used in\n   well-managed and highly monitored service provider
    PON access\n   networks in a single administrative domain, including the\n   implementation
    of rogue ONU attachment detection and mitigation via\n   device authentication.
    \ Thus, many of the security considerations as\n   described in [RFC7275] apply
    here as well.\n   Again, similar to ICCP, activity on the attachment circuits
    may cause\n   security threats or be exploited to create denial-of-service attacks.\n
    \  In many passive optical networks, the optical paths between OLT and\n   ONUs
    traverse publicly accessible facilities including public\n   attachments (e.g.,
    telephone poles), which opens up the risk of\n   excessive link bouncing by optical
    layer impairment.  While ICCP for\n   MC-PON interconnects in the MPLS domain
    and does not traverse the PON\n   network, risks do include introduction of a
    malicious ONU that could\n   cause, for example, excessive link bouncing.  This
    link bouncing\n   could result in increased ICCP exchanges similar to the malicious
    CE\n   case described in [RFC7275].  Operators of such networks should take\n
    \  additional care to restrict unauthorized ONUs and to limit the impact\n   of
    link bouncing at the OLT, as these could result in service\n   impairment.\n"
