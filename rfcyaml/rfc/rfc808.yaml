    \   HELD AT BBN ON 10 JANUARY 1979\n"
- title: 'Introduction:'
  contents:
  - "Introduction:\n   This note is a very belated attempt to document a meeting that\
    \ was\n   held three years ago to discuss the state of computer mail in the\n\
    \   ARPA community and to reach some conclusions to guide the further\n   development\
    \ of computer mail systems such that a coherent total mail\n   service would continue\
    \ to be provided.\n   Some important conclusions were reached at this meeting\
    \ which limited\n   the extent to which mail systems were to incorporate new features\
    \ in\n   the context of the existing service and specifications.\n   Unfortunately,\
    \ this meeting and the conclusions were not documented,\n   and the specifications\
    \ were not revised.  This has led to continuing\n   problems in the mail service.\n\
    \   Due to the passage of time these notes are necessarily quite\n   incomplete.\
    \  It is thought that there were a number of other\n   attendees.  I would like\
    \ to express my appreciation to those who\n   helped provide this information,\
    \ especially Vint Cerf, Jack Haverty,\n   Danny Cohen, Bob Thomas, and Debbie\
    \ Deutsch.\n"

  - "The Meeting Announcement:\n   On 10 January 1979 we are holding a meeting at\
    \ BBN in Cambridge, MA,\n   starting at 0930, to discuss Message Service support\
    \ on the ARPANET.\n   The purpose of the meeting is to provide a basis for any\n\
    \   standardization of efforts which may be necessary.  We will take\n   stock\
    \ of the various message services currently available on the\n   ARPANET, discuss\
    \ problems which have been encountered between\n   different message systems,\
    \ review current protocols and review\n   forthcoming developments.  An agenda\
    \ is given below.  Each of you\n   should be prepared to discuss current problems\
    \ you are aware of and\n   any developments which impact future message service.\n"

  - "Talks:\n   1.  Duane Adams opened the meeting.  He indicated that we should be\n\
    \   concerned about computer mail as a total message service (not just as\n  \
    \ a local user interface), and asked what impact on the message service\n   the\
    \ developments in internetting and multimedia would have.\n   2.  Dave Farber\
    \ gave a bit of history of mail systems, listing the\n   names of all the systems\
    \ anybody had every heard of (see Appendix A).\n   It was noted that most of the\
    \ mail systems were not formal projects\n   (in the sense of explicitly sponsored\
    \ research), but things that\n   \"just happened\".\n   3.  Ted Myer chaired a\
    \ discussion of current problems in mail\n   systems, and the following made comments\
    \ as well: R. Stallman,\n   D. Farber, P. Santos, K. Harrenstien, R. Kunzelman,\
    \ T. Knight,\n   B. Thomas, D. Lebling, J. Haverty, D. Cohen, D. Adams, V. Cerf,\
    \ and\n   A. Vezza.\n      This was mostly gripes about what this or that mail\
    \ system did\n      wrong.\n         Topics included use of MLFL instead of MAIL,\
    \ fully qualifying\n         the all the usernames with hostnames on all the addresses,\n\
    \         immediate feedback about the addressed user having a mailbox at\n  \
    \       the destination host or getting an error message later, host\n"

    \ going\n         down in 10 minutes\"), and addressing issues.\n      There were\
    \ also some things mentioned that might be added to the\n      current systems.\n\
    \         Topics included virtual hosts (e.g., NSW), internetted hosts,\n    \
    \     authentication, message identification, duplicate detection,\n         spoofing,\
    \ multicopy delivery, limits on receipt, program to\n         program mail, structured\
    \ typed data, graphics, fax, and voice.\n      At the end of this session there\
    \ was a statement that further work\n      was putting patches on patches and\
    \ that we should make a\n      commitment to a version 2 system.  There should\
    \ be an edict that\n      says \"this is it\", and the current mail service should\
    \ be frozen.\n   4.  Debbie Deutsch talked about some work being done at BBN on\n\
    \   multimedia mail.\n      Debbie discussed the alternatives for including other\
    \ types of\n      data (voice, graphics, fax, numeric, executable) in messages,\
    \ and\n      for structuring messages to identify and interrelate the different\n\
    \      types of data.  The main choice to make is between encoding the\n     \
    \ data in ASCII and using keyword field identifiers, or using a\n      binary\
    \ typed structured format.  The current work is attempting\n      integrate fax\
    \ data handling into an existing text mail system.\n      Copies of the viewgraphs\
    \ were distributed.\n   5.  There was a discussion of Personal Computers.\n  \
    \    Tom Knight gave a short discription of the Lisp Machine project.\n      There\
    \ was some general discussion of the impact of personal\n      computers on mail\
    \ services.  The main realization being that the\n      personal computer will\
    \ not be available to handle incoming mail\n      all the time.  Probably, personal\
    \ computer users will have their\n      mailboxes on some big brother computer\
    \ (which may be dedicated to\n      mailbox service, or be a general purpose host)\
    \ and poll for their\n      mail when they want to read it.  There were some concerns\
    \ raised\n      about accountability and accounting.\n   6.  Bob Thomas talked\
    \ about the ideas for routing mail between\n   regular mailboxes on ARPANET Hosts\
    \ and mailboxes of NSW users.\n      The main point of interest is that an NSW\
    \ user is not a user of a\n      specific host, thus, the notion of a mailbox\
    \ being \"user@host\"\n      dosen't work.  Bob suggested that one might think\
    \ of NSW as a\n      virtual host.  The implementation of this mail service for\
    \ NSW\n"

  - "RFC 808\n      users is constrained to minimize the amount of new code and\n\
    \      changes to existing programs.  Bob described his ideas for address\n  \
    \    formats for sending messages between NSW users, from NSW users to\n     \
    \ ARPANET users, and from ARPANET users to NSW users.  The last\n      being the\
    \ most difficult to pull off.  Copies of the viewgraphs\n      were distributed,\
    \ and copies of a memo were distributed (BBN NSW\n      Working Note 24).\n  \
    \ 7.  Jon Postel talked about the ideas he had for internet multimedia\n   mail\
    \ systems.\n      Two aspects of this were a general approach to addressing and\n\
    \      routing for mail distribution, and using a structure of typed data\n  \
    \    elements to represent the message data and control.\n   8.  There was some\
    \ discussion of other work in mail services.\n      Someone talked about the work\
    \ of ANSI X3 S33 on message structure\n      and protocol.\n      Dave Farber\
    \ described the activities of IFIP TC 6.5 on\n      international message services.\n\
    \      Ted Myer described the interests of the US Congress Office of\n      Technology\
    \ Assesment (OTA) in electronic communication.\n"
- title: 'General Discussion:'
  contents:
  - "General Discussion:\n   It was suggested that we need to view the problems in\
    \ building a\n   total message service rather than individual message systems.\n\
    \   In general it was felt that the current message service was somewhat\n   out\
    \ of control with incompatible varations and extensions.  There\n   were several\
    \ instances where a minor change to one mail system led to\n   unexpected problems\
    \ in another mail system.\n   In part, the reason for this seemed to be the varations\
    \ allowed by\n   the protocol, and especially the partial implementation of the\n\
    \   protocol by most systems.\n   The general approach to resolving these problems\
    \ was two fold:\n      First, a few minor further changes were to be allowed,\
    \ but in\n      general full implementation of the protocol (RFC 733) was not\
    \ to\n      be carried out. In case of questions about a particular change\n \
    \     Duane Adams was to decide if it would be allowed ot not.  The goal\n   \
    \   in this approach was to quickly stabilize the mail service in a\n      useful\
    \ state.\n"

- title: RFC 808
  contents:
  - "RFC 808\n         In particular, if a small number of senders are doing something\n\
    \         that is incompatible with the total service, they will be asked\n  \
    \       to stop doing it.  Or, if a small number of receivers can't\n        \
    \ handle something that most systems do, they will be asked to\n         handle\
    \ that feature.\n      Second, work was to be focused on the definition and\n\
    \      implementation of a next-generation mail service which would\n      attack\
    \ all the existing problems and include facilities for voice,\n      fax, and\
    \ graphics data.\n   The use of structured data in the next-generation mail service\
    \ was\n   approved.  Jack Haverty noted that RFC 713 specified a language,\n \
    \  MSDTP, that could be used to define a structured mail protocol.\n"

  - "Conclusions:\n   A.  Existing Mail Services\n      1.  Mail shall not be sent\
    \ between hosts if it breaks existing\n      mail programs.\n         Outlawed\
    \ by this rule are:\n            a. Spaces in user names.\n            b. Multiple\
    \ at signs in mailboxes.\n      2.  Features of RFC 733 that are generally unimplemented\
    \ shall\n      remain unimplemented, and are decommitted from the specification.\n\
    \         Outlawed by this rule are:\n            a. \"Include\" and \"Postal\"\
    \ type addresses.\n      3.  Duane Adams will arbitrate disputes.\n      4.  There\
    \ shall be no more changes to the MAIL/MLFL FTP reply\n      codes.\n   B.  New\
    \ Mail Services\n      1.  New services should be provided in the context of the\n\
    \      experimental multimedia mail systems now being planned.\n"
