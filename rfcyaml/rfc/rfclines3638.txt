Abstract This memo recommends that RFC 1643 be reclassified as an Historic document and provides the supporting motivation for that recommendation.
Details STD 50, RFC 1643 [RFC1643], "Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet like Interface Types", and its SMIv2 equivalent, RFC 1650 [RFC1650], are applicable to half duplex 10
Subsequent to the 1994 publication of these documents, 100 Mb/s, 1000 Mb/s, and 10 Gb/s Ethernet interface types have been developed, and full duplex operation at 10 Mb/s has been standardized.
Updates to RFC 1650 have been produced to accommodate these new technologies [RFC2358] [RFC2665]
These updates define new MIB objects to supplement those defined in RFC 1643 and RFC 1650 and in addition deprecate some of the objects in RFC 1643 and RFC 1650 that are no longer considered useful.
They also levy a requirement for implementations of the EtherLike MIB to support the MAU MIB [RFC2239]
RFC 1643 is an obsolete specification, overtaken by events.
Its SMIv2 equivalent, RFC 1650, was officially retired in 1998.
New implementations   even those that support only half duplex 10
Mb/s interfaces   should comply with in the latest version of the specification, currently RFC 3635 [RFC3635] and RFC 2666
[RFC2666], instead of RFC 1643.
It is therefore recommended that RFC 1643 be reclassified as an Historic document.
Effect on Other Standards Track Documents Reclassification of RFC 1643 will have no impact on the status of any standards track RFC because no standards track RFC cites it as a normative reference.
An RFC content search made with the tools available at http://www.rfc
editor.org reveals the following standards track documents that cite RFC 1643:
IF MIB, which is the MIB module for managing IEEE 802.12 100VG AnyLAN interfaces.
It refers to RFC 1643 in the context of an admonition not to implement the EtherLike MIB for any interface where the DOT12 IF MIB is implemented.
RFC 2358 [RFC2358], RFC 2665 [RFC2665], and RFC 3635
[RFC3635] all contain updated versions of the EtherLike MIB.
They refer to RFC 1643 in the context of explaining the history of the EtherLike MIB, and the citation in RFC 3635 is explicitly listed as a non normative reference.
[RFC2720] contains the FLOW METER MIB.
It refers to RFC 1643 only in an ASN.1 comment in the MIB module.
Omission of that comment would not preclude correct implementation of the MIB module.
Clearly, none of these citations are normative.
Security Considerations Reclassification of RFC 1643 will not, in and of itself, have any effect on the security of the Internet.
