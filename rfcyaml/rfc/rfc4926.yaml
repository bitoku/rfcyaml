    \ and academic networks, for naming persistent resources\n   defined by GEANT,\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Consortium of European Academic and Research Networks\
    \ (GEANT)\n   provides high-speed, high-quality network connectivity for education\n\
    \   institutions, universities, and research centres in Europe.  The\n   network\
    \ infrastructure is composed of several National Research and\n   Education Networks\
    \ (NRENs) and their European-wide interconnection,\n   GEANT.  The current network\
    \ is GEANT2 [6], and is the seventh\n   generation of pan-European research and\
    \ education network, successor\n   to the pan-European multi-gigabit research\
    \ network GEANT.  DANTE [7]\n   is a UK-based organization representing the members\
    \ of the Consortium\n   and operating the GEANT2 Network.  This cooperative work\
    \ is mainly\n   done in the framework of EU-funded projects.  The biggest of such\n\
    \   activities is currently the GN2 project [6], started in September\n   2004,\
    \ that follows other successful ones that have evolved the\n   European Networks\
    \ for Research and Education for almost two decades.\n   It is expected that these\
    \ activities and the network evolution will\n   continue to be supported by the\
    \ European Union and all European\n   governments in the years to come, as they\
    \ view the existence of a\n   state-of-the-art network for research in Europe\
    \ as being of top\n   strategic importance.  We will refer to the organization\
    \ involved in\n   these projects and those that benefit from their outcome as\
    \ the\n   \"GEANT community\".\n   The GEANT community produces many kinds of\
    \ documents: specifications,\n   working drafts, project reports, schemas, stylesheets,\
    \ etc.  The\n   community wishes to provide global, distributed, persistent,\n\
    \   location-independent names for these resources.  The Uniform Resource\n  \
    \ Name (URN) variant of URIs meets these requirements.\n   The GEANT community\
    \ and other GEANT-affiliated groups would benefit\n   from the GEANT URN proposal\
    \ by having an easy, efficient way to\n   assign globally unique, persistent identifiers\
    \ to resources that they\n   create.  The nature of GEANT work is that it serves\
    \ the needs of many\n   communities of interest.  A namespace managed so as to\
    \ facilitate the\n   creation, registration, and resolution of unique, persistent\n\
    \   identifiers would be of great value for GEANT, its affiliates, and\n   the\
    \ higher education community generally.  The possibility of fitting\n   the naming\
    \ needs under existing namespaces has been considered, but\n   the conclusion\
    \ was that the number of activities and the size of the\n   developers community\
    \ is such that creating a lot of (possibly\n   uncoordinated) dependencies from\
    \ other namespaces is undesirable.\n   The proposed URN namespace specification\
    \ is for a formal namespace.\n"

    \ structure:\n         The Namespace Specific Strings (NSS) of all URNs assigned\
    \ by\n         GEANT will conform to the syntax defined in section 2.2 of RFC\n\
    \         2141, \"URN Syntax\" [2].  In addition, all GEANT URN NSSs will\n  \
    \       consist of a left-to-right series of tokens delimited by\n         colons.\
    \  The left-to-right sequence of colon-delimited tokens\n         corresponds\
    \ to descending nodes in a tree.  To the right of the\n         lowest naming\
    \ authority node, there may be zero, one, or more\n         levels of hierarchical\
    \ naming nodes terminating in a rightmost\n         leaf node.  See the section\
    \ below entitled \"Identifier\n         assignment\" for more on the semantics\
    \ of NSSs.  This syntax\n         convention is captured in the following normative\
    \ ABNF rules\n         for GEANT NSSs (see RFC 4234 [1]):\n         GEANT-NSS\
    \        =   1*(subStChar) 0*(\":\" 1*(subStChar))\n         subStChar       =\
    \   trans / \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\n         trans           =   ALPHA / DIGIT /\
    \ other / reserved\n         other           =   \"(\" / \")\" / \"+\" / \",\"\
    \ / \"-\" / \".\" /\n                             \"=\" / \"@\" / \";\" / \"$\"\
    \ /\n                             \"_\" / \"!\" / \"*\" / \"'\"\n         reserved\
    \        =   \"%\" / \"/\" / \"?\" / \"#\"\n         The exclusion of the colon\
    \ from the list of \"other\" characters\n         means that the colon can only\
    \ occur as a delimiter between\n         string tokens.  Note that this ABNF rule\
    \ set guarantees that\n         any valid GEANT NSS is also a valid RFC 2141 NSS.\n\
    \   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n         None.\n   Identifier uniqueness:\n\
    \         It is the responsibility of DANTE to guarantee uniqueness of\n     \
    \    the names of immediately subordinate naming authorities.  Each\n        \
    \ lower-level naming authority in turn inherits the\n         responsibility of\
    \ guaranteeing uniqueness of names in their\n         branch of the naming tree.\n\
    \   Identifier persistence:\n         DANTE bears ultimate responsibility for\
    \ maintaining the\n         usability of GEANT URNs over time.  This responsibility\
    \ may be\n         delegated to subordinate naming authorities per the discussion\n\
    \         in the section below on identifier assignment.  That section\n     \
    \    provides a mechanism for the delegation to be revoked in the\n         case\
    \ a subordinate naming authority ceases to function.\n   Identifier assignment:\n\
    \         DANTE will create an initial series of immediately subordinate\n   \
    \      naming authorities, and will define a process for adding to\n         that\
    \ list of authorities.  Each top-level working group of\n         GEANT will be\
    \ invited to designate a naming authority and to\n         suggest one or more\
    \ candidate names.\n         Institutions and communities affiliated with GEANT\
    \ may request,\n         through their designated GEANT liaison, that they be\
    \ granted\n         GEANT-subordinate naming authority status.  They may propose\n\
    \         candidate names for that authority.  One way for such entities\n   \
    \      to guarantee uniqueness of their proposed name is to base it on\n     \
    \    a DNS name.  That is, if, e.g., the German National Research\n         and\
    \ Education Network wished to be designated a subordinate\n         naming authority\
    \ under GEANT, the institutional GEANT liaison\n         could propose to DANTE\
    \ to be delegated control over names\n         beginning with \"urn:geant:dfn.de\"\
    .  Institutions seeking\n         affiliation with GEANT should send email to\n\
    \         geant-submit@dante.org.uk, nominating an institutional liaison\n   \
    \      and providing contact information for that person.\n         On at least\
    \ an annual basis, DANTE will contact the liaisons or\n         directors of each\
    \ immediately subordinate naming authority.  If\n         there is no response,\
    \ or if the respondent indicates that they\n         wish to relinquish naming\
    \ authority, the authority over that\n         branch of the tree reverts to GEANT.\
    \  This process will be\n         enforced recursively by each naming authority\
    \ on its\n         subordinates.  This process guarantees that responsibility\
    \ for\n         each branch of the tree will lapse for less than one year, at\n\
    \         worst, before being reclaimed by a superior authority.\n         Lexical\
    \ equivalence of two GEANT namespace specific strings\n         (NSSs) is defined\
    \ below as an exact, case-sensitive string\n         match.  DANTE will assign\
    \ names of immediately subordinate\n         naming authorities in lowercase only.\
    \  This forestalls the\n         registration of two GEANT-subordinate naming\
    \ authorities whose\n         names differ only in case.\n   Identifier resolution:\n\
    \         DANTE will maintain an index of all GEANT and GEANT workgroup\n    \
    \     assigned URNs on its Web site,\n         http://www.dante.net/urn-geant/urn-geant.html.\
    \  That index will\n         map URNs to resource identifiers, usually URLs. \
    \ GEANT-\n         affiliated naming authorities will specify how to resolve the\n\
    \         URNs they assign if they are resolvable.\n   Lexical equivalence:\n\
    \         Lexical equivalence of two GEANT Namespace Specific Strings\n      \
    \   (NSSs) is defined as an exact, case-sensitive string match.\n   Conformance\
    \ with URN syntax:\n         All GEANT NSSs fully conform to RFC 2141 syntax rules\
    \ for NSSs.\n   Validation mechanism:\n         As specified in the \"Identifier\
    \ resolution\" section above,\n         DANTE will maintain an index of all GEANT\
    \ and GEANT workgroup\n         assigned URNs on its Web site,\n         http://www.dante.net/urn-geant/urn-geant.html\
    \ Presence in that\n         index implies that a given URN is valid.  GEANT-affiliated\n\
    \         naming authorities will specify how to validate the URNs they\n    \
    \     assign.\n   Scope:\n         Global.\n"

    \ beyond those normally\n   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in\
    \ general.\n"
- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   Registration of an Namespace Identifier (NID)\
    \ specific to GEANT is\n   reasonable given the following considerations:\n  \
    \ 1.  GEANT would like to assign URNs to some very fine-grained\n       objects.\
    \  This does not seem to be the primary intended use of\n       the XMLORG namespace\
    \ (RFC 3120) [3], or the more tightly\n       controlled OASIS namespace (RFC\
    \ 3121) [4].\n   2.  GEANT seeks naming autonomy.  GEANT is not a member of OASIS,\
    \ so\n       becoming a subordinate naming authority under the OASIS URN space\n\
    \       is not an option.\n   3.  GEANT will want to assign URNs to non-XML objects\
    \ as well.  That\n       is another reason that XMLORG may not be an appropriate\
    \ higher-\n       level naming authority for GEANT.\n   Some GEANT-developed schema\
    \ and namespaces may be good candidates for\n   inclusion in the XMLORG or possible\
    \ future \"EU\" registry.  The fact\n   that such an object might already have\
    \ a GEANT-assigned URN shouldn't\n   be a hindrance.  RFC 3406 [5] (which replaced\
    \ RFC 2611) includes an\n   explicit statement that two or more URNs may point\
    \ to the same\n   resource.  A resource with a GEANT-assigned Namespace Specific\
    \ String\n   would, of course, be given an XMLORG or EU Namespace Specific String\n\
    \   as it enters the XMLORG or \"EU\" registry.\n"

  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   The assignment and use of identifiers within\

    \ agencies\n   (the next level naming authorities) will be the European National\n\
    \   Research and Education Networks and the established organizational\n   cross-border\
    \ formations.\n   It is expected that the majority of the NRENs and all GEANT\
    \ base\n   activities make use of the GEANT namespace.\n   After the establishment\
    \ of the GEANT namespace, the consortium will,\n   as soon as practical, establish\
    \ a resolution service (analogously to\n   other distributed pan-European services,\
    \ like EduROAM, PerfSONAR,\n   etc.) for the namespace clients.\n"
