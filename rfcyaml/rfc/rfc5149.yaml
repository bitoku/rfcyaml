  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile IPv6 [2] can identify mobile nodes in various ways,\
    \ including\n   home addresses [2], Network Access Identifiers (NAIs) [6][7],\
    \ and\n   credentials suitable for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol version\
    \ 2\n   (IKEv2) [10].  In some Mobile IPv6 deployments, identifying the\n   mobile\
    \ node or the mobility service subscriber via a Proxy Mobile\n   IPv6 client [5]\
    \ (hereafter, the mobile node and the Proxy Mobile IPv6\n   client are used interchangeably)\
    \ is not enough to distinguish between\n   multiple services possibly provisioned\
    \ to the said mobile node and\n   its mobility service subscription.\n   The capability\
    \ to specify different services in addition to the\n   mobile node identity can\
    \ be leveraged to provide flexibility for\n   mobility service providers to provide\
    \ multiple services within the\n   same mobility service subscription.  For example:\n\
    \   o  Provide an enterprise data access for which the mobility service\n    \
    \  provider hosts connectivity and mobility services on behalf of the\n      enterprise.\n\
    \   o  Provide access to service domains that are otherwise not\n      accessible\
    \ from public networks because of some mobility service\n      provider's business\
    \ reasons.\n   o  Provide simultaneous access to different service domains that\
    \ are\n      separated based on policies of the mobility service provider.\n \
    \  o  Enable easier policy and quality of service assignment for\n      mobility\
    \ service providers based on the subscribed services.\n   o  In the absence of\
    \ a specifically indicated service, the home agent\n      MUST act as if the default\
    \ service, plain Internet access, had\n      been requested.  There is no absolute\
    \ requirement that this\n      default service be allowed to all subscribers,\
    \ but it is highly\n      RECOMMENDED in order to avoid having normal subscribers\
    \ employ\n      operator-specific configuration values in order to get basic\n\
    \      service.\n   This document describes a Service Selection Mobility Option\
    \ for\n   Mobile IPv6 that is intended to assist home agents to make specific\n\
    \   service selections for the mobility service subscription during the\n   binding\
    \ registration procedure.  The service selection may affect\n   home agent routing\
    \ decisions, Home Address or Home Network Prefix\n   assignment policies, firewall\
    \ settings, and security policies.  The\n   Service Selection option should be\
    \ used in every Binding Update that\n   makes a new registration to the home agent.\n\
    \   Some of the potential use-cases were listed earlier in this section.\n   The\
    \ general aim is better manageability of services and service\n   provisioning\
    \ from the point of view of both operators and service\n   providers.  However,\
    \ it should be understood that there are potential\n   deployment possibilities\
    \ where selecting a certain service may\n   restrict simultaneous access to other\
    \ services from a user's point of\n   view.  For example, services may be located\
    \ in different\n   administrative domains or external customer networks that practice\n\
    \   excessive filtering of inbound and outbound traffic.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Mobile Node Considerations\n   A mobile node or a Proxy Mobile IPv6 client\
    \ MAY include, at most, one\n   Service Selection Mobility Option into a Binding\
    \ Update message.  The\n   option is used to identify the service to be associated\
    \ with the\n   binding registration and SHOULD only be included into the initial\n\
    \   Binding Update message sent to a home agent.  If the mobile node\n   wishes\
    \ to change the selected service, it is RECOMMENDED that the\n   mobile node de-register\
    \ the existing binding with the home agent\n   before proceeding with a binding\
    \ registration for a different\n   service.  The provisioning of the service identifiers\
    \ to the mobile\n   node or to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 client is out of the scope\
    \ of this\n   specification.\n   The placement of the Service Selection option\
    \ is as follows: when\n   present, this option MUST appear after the Mobile Node-Network\
    \ Access\n   Identifier (MN-NAI) option, if the MN-NAI option is present, and\n\
    \   before any authorization- and authentication-related options.  The\n   Service\
    \ Selection option can be used with any mobile node\n   identification method\
    \ such as a home address, an MN-NAI, and\n   credentials suitable for IKEv2.\n\
    \   If the mobile node receives a Binding Acknowledgement with a Status\n   Code\
    \ set to SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED and the mobile node has an\n   existing\
    \ binding with the Home Address or the Home Network Prefix\n   used in the failed\
    \ Binding Update message, the mobile node MUST\n   delete the existing binding.\
    \  If there is no existing binding, the\n   mobile node proceeds as with any failed\
    \ initial binding registration.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Home Agent Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Home Agent Considerations\n   Upon receiving a Binding Update message with\
    \ a Service Selection\n   option, the home agent authenticates and authorizes\
    \ the mobile node.\n   If the home agent supports the Service Selection, it MUST\
    \ also verify\n   that the mobile node is authorized for the service it included\
    \ in the\n   Service Selection option.  The services the mobile node is authorized\n\
    \   for SHOULD be part of the general mobile node subscription profile.\n   If\
    \ the mobile node is not authorized for the service, the home agent\n   MUST deny\
    \ the registration and send a Binding Acknowledgement with a\n   Status Code set\
    \ to SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (151).\n   The Service Selection option is used\
    \ to assist the authorization and\n   identifies a specific service that is to\
    \ be authorized.  The Service\n   Selection option MAY also affect the Home Address\
    \ or the Home Network\n   Prefix allocation when, for example, used with the MN-NAI\
    \ option.\n   For example, for the same NAI there MAY be different Home Addresses\n\
    \   or Home Network Prefixes depending on the identified service.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the Service Selection option MAY also affect the routing\n   of the outbound\
    \ IP packets in the home agent depending on the\n   selected service.  The home\
    \ agent MAY also apply different policy or\n   quality of service treatment to\
    \ traffic flows based on the selected\n   service.\n   If the newly arrived Binding\
    \ Update message with a Service Selection\n   option indicates a change in the\
    \ selected service, then the home\n   agent MUST re-authorize the mobile node.\
    \  Depending on the home agent\n   policies, the services policies, Home Address\
    \ or Home Network Prefix\n   allocation policies, and the subscription policies,\
    \ the home agent\n   may or may not be able to authorize the mobile node to the\
    \ new\n   service.  For example, the existing service and the new service could\n\
    \   require different Home Network Prefixes.  If the authorization fails,\n  \
    \ then the home agent MUST deny the registration, delete any binding\n   with\
    \ the existing Home Address or Home Network Prefix, and send a\n   Binding Acknowledgement\
    \ with a Status Code set to\n   SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (151).\n"
- title: 4.3.  Correspondent Node Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Correspondent Node Considerations\n   Unless the correspondent node and\
    \ the home agent share the same\n   knowledge about mobility services, the Service\
    \ Selection option is\n   more or less useless information to the correspondent\
    \ node.  The\n   correspondent node SHOULD silently ignore the Service Selection\n\
    \   option in this case.\n   There are deployment cases where the home agent and\
    \ a correspondent\n   node, for example, belong to the same administrative domain.\
    \  In this\n   case, it is possible that the correspondent node shares the same\n\
    \   knowledge of the services as the home agent.  Therefore, the\n   correspondent\
    \ node is, for example, able to provide service-based\n   traffic handling to\
    \ mobile nodes.\n"
