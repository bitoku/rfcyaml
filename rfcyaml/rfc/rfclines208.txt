Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. APPENDIX A IMP AND HOST SITE
IDENTIFICATION Bit 9 16 of the leader of most Host to IMP or IMP to Host messages define a network address related to the message (these bits are not meaningful for message types 1, 2, and 4).
In a Host to IMP message the network address identifies a particular Host to which the message should be delivered.
In an IMP to Host message the network address identifies the Host from which the message originated.
A network address consists of six bits (bits 11 16 of the leader) which specify an IMP number, preceded by two bits (bits 9 10 of the leader) which specify the Host number of a particular Host connected to that IMP.
The table below gives the decimal values of IMP number, Host number, and network address for each Host currently connected to the ARPA Network or scheduled for connection in the near future.
Scheduled installation dates are also shown for Hosts not currently connected; these dates, however, are subject to change without notice.
: Prior to September 1, 1971 the BBN PDP 1O (A) will be Host number 0 (network address 5) and the BBN DDP 516
will be Host number 1 (network address 69).
The address change is to be made during the day on 9/1/71.
