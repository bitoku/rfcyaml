  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The IP: next generation (IPng) area in the IETF is soliciting\
    \ white\n   papers on topics related to the IPng requirements and selection\n\
    \   criteria.\n   All interested parties are invited to submit white papers detailing\n\
    \   any specific requirements that they feel an IPng must fulfill or any\n   factors\
    \ that they feel might sway the IPng selection.  An example of\n   the former\
    \ might be a submission by a representative of a utility\n   company detailing\
    \ the scaling and addressing features which would be\n   required to service future\
    \ inclusion of utility meters on the\n   network.  An example of the other case\
    \ might be a paper outlining the\n   potential effect on IPng of some sections\
    \ of the future network\n   connectivity being provided via wireless networks.\n\
    \   At this time, we are not accepting white papers that evaluate\n   specific\
    \ IPng proposals.  This type of document will be accepted\n   after the various\
    \ proposal documents are deemed to be clear and\n   complete.\n   All white papers\
    \ will be reviewed in a process described below.  As a\n   result of these reviews,\
    \ each white paper will receive the focused\n   attention of the IPng directorate\
    \ and the community.  The white\n   papers will be used as resource materials\
    \ by the IPng Area working\n   groups, the directorate, the external review board\
    \ and the area\n   directors, during the selection process.\n   The deadline for\
    \ the submission of these white papers is February 1,\n   1994, though early submission\
    \ is encouraged.\n   Submit white papers, general or topic questions, and so on,\
    \ to\n   ipng-wp@harvard.edu.\n"
- title: 2. Document Review Process
  contents:
  - "2. Document Review Process\n   All submitted documents will first be reviewed\
    \ for clarity by members\n   of the IPng directorate and the external review board.\
    \  This review\n   may produce suggestions to the author on areas of the document\
    \ where\n   there may be some confusion as to the meaning.  Authors are urged\
    \ to\n   consider any such suggestions as constructive and to reexamine their\n\
    \   text in light of the suggestions.\n   A separate technical review will then\
    \ be done of the white paper.\n   This review will be conducted within the context\
    \ of the document.\n   That is, the review still will not make value judgments\
    \ on the white\n   papers, but will assess technical feasibility.  This review\
    \ may also\n   produce suggestions to the author.\n   The document will be submitted\
    \ as an Internet-Draft after these\n   reviews have been completed and after whatever\
    \ (if any) revisions\n   that the author decides to make.   After a suitable period\
    \ of time\n   these documents will be submitted as informational RFCs unless\n\
    \   withdrawn by the author.  These documents will comprise a part of the\n  \
    \ historical record of the IPng process.\n"
- title: 3. Document Format Requirements
  contents:
  - "3. Document Format Requirements\n   All white papers must follow the format requirements\
    \ listed in RFC\n   1543 and must not exceed 10 pages in length. (The relevant\
    \ portion of\n   RFC 1543 is included in this document as Appendix A.)  They should\n\
    \   not include the \"status of memo\" section; this will be added when the\n\
    \   documents are posted as Internet Drafts.  The reference version of\n   the\
    \ document must be in ASCII as is current practice with all RFCs.\n   A PostScript\
    \ version of the document may be submitted in addition to\n   the ASCII version.\
    \ (See RFC 1543 for the formatting procedures to use\n   with PostScript documents.)\n"
- title: 4. Outline for IPng Requirements and Concerns White Papers
  contents:
  - "4. Outline for IPng Requirements and Concerns White Papers\n   This section details\
    \ the white paper outline to be followed by\n   someone who would like to express\
    \ an opinion about the various\n   factors involved in the IPng definition and\
    \ selection process.  Since\n   these documents will be used as resource material\
    \ by the various IPng\n   working groups, the directorate, the external review\
    \ board and the\n   area directors, they should be well-focused and give specific\n\
    \   references to data supporting their points.\n   Each white paper should begin\
    \ with an executive summary of the\n   important points of the document.  This\
    \ executive summary should not\n   exceed 1/2 page in length.\n   The white paper\
    \ should then address the issue or issues that the\n   author feels should be\
    \ understood during the IPng process.  The total\n   document should not exceed\
    \ 10 pages in length.  An author may submit\n   more than one white paper if he\
    \ or she feels that the level of\n   detailed discussion on each topic warrants\
    \ it.\n"
- title: 5. Engineering considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Engineering considerations\n   In past discussions the following issues have\
    \ been raised as relevant\n   to the IPng selection process.  This list is in\
    \ no particular order.\n   Any or all of these issues may be addressed as well\
    \ as any other\n   topic that the author feels is germane, but do not exceed the\
    \ 10 page\n   limit, please.\n   5.1  Scaling - What is a reasonable estimate\
    \ for the scale of the\n      future data networking environment?  The current\
    \ common wisdom is\n      that IPng should be able to deal with 10 to the 12th\
    \ nodes.\n   5.2  Timescale - What are reasonable time estimates for the IPng\n\
    \      selection, development and deployment process or what should the\n    \
    \  timeframe requirements be?  This topic is being evaluated by the\n      ALE\
    \ working group and a copy of all white papers that express\n      opinions about\
    \ these topics will be forwarded to that group.\n   5.3  Transition and deployment\
    \ - Transition from the current version\n      to IPng will be a complex and difficult\
    \ process.  What are the\n      issues that should be considered The TACIT working\
    \ group will be\n      discussing these issues and a copy of all white papers\
    \ that\n      express opinions about these topics will be forwarded to that\n\
    \      group.\n   5.4  Security - What level and type of security will be required\
    \ in\n      the future network environment?  What features should be in an\n \
    \     IPng to facilitate security?\n   5.5  Configuration, administration and\
    \ operation - As networks get\n      larger and more complex, the day to day operational\
    \ aspects become\n      ever more important.  What should an IPng include or avoid\
    \ in\n      order to minimize the effect on the network operators?\n   5.6  Mobile\
    \ hosts - How important is the proliferation of mobile\n      hosts to the IPng\
    \ selection process?  To what extent should\n      features be included in an\
    \ IPng to assist in dealing with mobile\n      hosts?\n   5.7  Flows and resource\
    \ reservation - As the data networks begin to\n      get used for an increasing\
    \ number of time-critical processes, what\n      are the requirements or concerns\
    \ that affect how IPng should\n      facilitate the use of resource reservations\
    \ or flows?\n   5.8  Policy based routing - How important is policy based routing?\n\
    \      If it is important, what types of policies will be used?  What\n      requirements\
    \ do routing policies and potential future global\n      architectures of the\
    \ Internet bring to IPng?  How do policy\n      requirements interact with scaling?\n\
    \   5.9  Topological flexibility - What topology is anticipated for the\n    \
    \  Internet?  Will the current general topology model continue?  Is\n      it\
    \ acceptable (or even necessary) to place significant topological\n      restrictions\
    \ on interconnectivity of networks?\n   5.10 Applicability - What environment\
    \ / marketplace do you see for\n      the application of IPng?  How much wider\
    \ is it than the existing\n      IP market?\n   5.11 Datagram service - Existing\
    \ IP service is \"best effort\" and\n      based on hop-by-hop routed datagrams.\
    \  What requirements for this\n      paradigm influence the IPng selection?\n\
    \   5.12 Accounting - How important a consideration should the ability to\n  \
    \    do accounting be in the selection of an IPng?  What, if any,\n      features\
    \ should be included in an IPng to support accounting\n      functions?\n   5.13\
    \ Support of communication media - IPv4 can be supported over most\n      known\
    \ types of communications media.  How important is this same\n      flexibility\
    \ to an IPng?\n   5.14 Robustness and fault tolerance - To the extent that the\
    \ Internet\n      built from IPv4 has been highly fault tolerant, what are ways\
    \ that\n      IPng may avoid inadvertent decrease in the robustness (since some\n\
    \      things may work despite flaws that we do not understand well).\n      Comment\
    \ on any other ways in which this requirement may affect the\n      IPng.\n  \
    \ 5.15 Technology pull - Are there technologies that will pull the\n      Internet\
    \ in a way that should influence IPng?  Can specific\n      strategies be developed\
    \ to encompass these?\n   5.16 Action items - suggested charges to the directorate,\
    \ working\n      groups or others to support the concerns or gather more\n   \
    \   information needed for a decision.\n"

- title: Appendix  A - Formatting Rules (from RFC 1543)

  - "Appendix  A - Formatting Rules (from RFC 1543)\n   Note: there are a set of NROFF\
    \ formatting macros for the following\n   format.  Please contact ipng-wp@harvard.edu\
    \ if you would like to get\n   a copy.\n   3a.  ASCII Format Rules\n      The\
    \ character codes are ASCII.\n      Each page must be limited to 58 lines followed\
    \ by a form feed on a\n      line by itself.\n      Each line must be limited\
    \ to 72 characters followed by carriage\n      return and line feed.\n      No\
    \ overstriking (or underlining) is allowed.\n      These \"height\" and \"width\"\
    \ constraints include any headers,\n      footers, page numbers, or left side\
    \ indenting.\n      Do not fill the text with extra spaces to provide a straight\
    \ right\n      margin.\n      Do not do hyphenation of words at the right margin.\n\
    \      Do not use footnotes.  If such notes are necessary, put them at\n     \
    \ the end of a section, or at the end of the document.\n      Use single spaced\
    \ text within a paragraph, and one blank line\n      between paragraphs.\n   \
    \   Note that the number of pages in a document and the page numbers\n      on\
    \ which various sections fall will likely change with\n      reformatting.  Thus\
    \ cross references in the text by section number\n      usually are easier to\
    \ keep consistent than cross references by\n      page number.\n"
