  - "1.  Introduction\n   Origin validation based on Resource Public Key Infrastructure\
    \ (RPKI)\n   [RFC6811] provides a measure of resilience to accidental\n   mis-origination\
    \ of prefixes; however, it provides neither\n   cryptographic assurance (announcements\
    \ are not signed) nor assurance\n   of the AS Path of the announcement.\n   This\
    \ document describes requirements to be placed on a BGP security\n   protocol,\
    \ herein termed \"BGPsec\", intended to rectify these gaps.\n   The threat model\
    \ assumed here is documented in [RFC4593] and\n   [RFC7132].\n   As noted in the\
    \ threat model [RFC7132], this work is limited to\n   threats to the BGP protocol.\
    \  Issues of business relationship\n   conformance, while quite important to operators,\
    \ are not security\n   issues per se and are outside the scope of this document.\
    \  It is\n   hoped that these issues will be better understood in the future.\n"

- title: 3.  General Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  General Requirements\n   The following are general requirements for a BGPsec\
    \ protocol:\n   3.1   A BGPsec design MUST allow the receiver of a BGP announcement\n\
    \         to determine, to a strong level of certainty, that the\n         originating\
    \ AS in the received PATH attribute possessed the\n         authority to announce\
    \ the prefix.\n   3.2   A BGPsec design MUST allow the receiver of a BGP announcement\n\
    \         to determine, to a strong level of certainty, that the received\n  \
    \       PATH attribute accurately represents the sequence of External\n      \
    \   BGP (eBGP) exchanges that propagated the prefix from the origin\n        \
    \ AS to the receiver, particularly if an AS has added or deleted\n         any\
    \ AS number other than its own in the PATH attribute.  This\n         includes\
    \ modification to the number of AS prepends.\n   3.3   BGP attributes other than\
    \ the AS_PATH are used only locally, or\n         have meaning only between immediate\
    \ neighbors, may be modified\n         by intermediate systems and figure less\
    \ prominently in the\n         decision process.  Consequently, it is not appropriate\
    \ to try\n         to protect such attributes in a BGPsec design.\n   3.4   A\
    \ BGPsec design MUST be amenable to incremental deployment.\n         This implies\
    \ that incompatible protocol capabilities MUST be\n         negotiated.\n   3.5\
    \   A BGPsec design MUST provide analysis of the operational\n         considerations\
    \ for deployment and particularly of incremental\n         deployment, e.g., contiguous\
    \ islands, non-contiguous islands,\n         universal deployment, etc.\n   3.6\
    \   As proofs of possession and authentication may require\n         cryptographic\
    \ payloads and/or storage and computation, likely\n         increasing processing\
    \ and memory requirements on routers, a\n         BGPsec design MAY require use\
    \ of new hardware.  That is,\n         compatibility with current hardware abilities\
    \ is not a\n         requirement that this document imposes on a solution.\n \
    \  3.7   A BGPsec design need not prevent attacks on data-plane traffic.\n   \
    \      It need not provide assurance that the data plane even follows\n      \
    \   the control plane.\n   3.8   A BGPsec design MUST resist attacks by an enemy\
    \ who has access\n         to the inter-router link layer, per Section 3.1.1.2\
    \ of\n         [RFC4593].  In particular, such a design MUST provide\n       \
    \  mechanisms for authentication of all data, including protecting\n         against\
    \ message insertion, deletion, modification, or replay.\n         Mechanisms that\
    \ suffice include TCP sessions authenticated with\n         the TCP Authentication\
    \ Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925], IPsec\n         [RFC4301], or Transport Layer Security\
    \ (TLS) [RFC5246].\n   3.9   It is assumed that a BGPsec design will require information\n\
    \         about holdings of address space and Autonomous System Numbers\n    \
    \     (ASNs), and assertions about binding of address space to ASNs.\n       \
    \  A BGPsec design MAY make use of a security infrastructure\n         (e.g.,\
    \ a PKI) to distribute such authenticated data.\n   3.10  It is entirely OPTIONAL\
    \ to secure AS SETs and prefix\n         aggregation.  The long-range solution\
    \ to this is the\n         deprecation of AS_SETs; see [RFC6472].\n   3.11  If\
    \ a BGPsec design uses signed prefixes, given the difficulty\n         of splitting\
    \ a signed message while preserving the signature,\n         it need not handle\
    \ multiple prefixes in a single UPDATE PDU.\n   3.12  A BGPsec design MUST enable\
    \ each BGPsec speaker to configure\n         use of the security mechanism on\
    \ a per-peer basis.\n   3.13  A BGPsec design MUST provide backward compatibility\
    \ in the\n         message formatting, transmission, and processing of routing\n\
    \         information carried through a mixed security environment.\n        \
    \ Message formatting in a fully secured environment MAY be\n         handled in\
    \ a non-backward compatible manner.\n   3.14  While the formal validity of a routing\
    \ announcement should be\n         determined by the BGPsec protocol, local routing\
    \ policy MUST be\n         the final arbiter of the best path and other routing\
    \ decisions.\n   3.15  A BGPsec design MUST support 'transparent' route servers,\n\
    \         meaning that the AS of the route server is not counted in\n        \
    \ downstream BGP AS-path-length tie-breaking decisions.\n   3.16  A BGPsec design\
    \ MUST support AS aliasing.  This technique is\n         not well defined or universally\
    \ implemented but is being\n         documented in [AS-MIGRATION].  A BGPsec design\
    \ SHOULD\n         accommodate AS 'migration' techniques such as common\n    \
    \     proprietary and non-standard methods that allow a router to\n         have\
    \ two AS identities, without lengthening the effective AS\n         Path.\n  \
    \ 3.17  If a BGPsec design makes use of a security infrastructure, that\n    \
    \     infrastructure SHOULD enable each network operator to select\n         the\
    \ entities it will trust when authenticating data in the\n         security infrastructure.\
    \  See, for example, [LTA-USE-CASES].\n   3.18  A BGPsec design MUST NOT require\
    \ operators to reveal more than\n         is currently revealed in the operational\
    \ inter-domain routing\n         environment, other than the inclusion of necessary\
    \ security\n         credentials to allow others to ascertain for themselves the\n\
    \         necessary degree of assurance regarding the validity of Network\n  \
    \       Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) received via BGPsec.\n         This\
    \ includes peering, customer/provider relationships, an\n         ISP's internal\
    \ infrastructure, etc.  It is understood that some\n         data are revealed\
    \ to the savvy seeker by BGP, traceroute, etc.,\n         today.\n   3.19  A BGPsec\
    \ design MUST signal (e.g., via logging or SNMP)\n         security exceptions\
    \ that are significant to the operator.  The\n         specific data to be signaled\
    \ are an implementation matter.\n   3.20  Any routing information database MUST\
    \ be re-authenticated\n         periodically or in an event-driven manner, especially\
    \ in\n         response to events such as, for example, PKI updates.\n   3.21\
    \  Any inter-AS use of cryptographic hashes or signatures MUST\n         provide\
    \ mechanisms for algorithm agility.  For a discussion,\n         see [ALG-AGILITY].\n\
    \   3.22  A BGPsec design SHOULD NOT presume to know the intent of the\n     \
    \    originator of a NLRI, nor that of any AS on the AS Path, other\n        \
    \ than that they intend to pass it to the next AS in the path.\n   3.23  A BGPsec\
    \ listener SHOULD NOT trust non-BGPsec markings, such as\n         communities,\
    \ across trust boundaries.\n"
- title: 4.  BGP UPDATE Security Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  BGP UPDATE Security Requirements\n   The following requirements MUST be met\
    \ in the processing of BGP\n   UPDATE messages:\n   4.1  A BGPsec design MUST\
    \ enable each recipient of an UPDATE to\n        formally validate that the origin\
    \ AS in the message is\n        authorized to originate a route to the prefix(es)\
    \ in the\n        message.\n   4.2  A BGPsec design MUST enable the recipient\
    \ of an UPDATE to\n        formally determine that the NLRI has traversed the\
    \ AS Path\n        indicated in the UPDATE.  Note that this is more stringent\
    \ than\n        showing that the path is merely not impossible.\n   4.3  Replay\
    \ of BGP UPDATE messages need not be completely prevented,\n        but a BGPsec\
    \ design SHOULD provide a mechanism to control the\n        window of exposure\
    \ to replay attacks.\n   4.4  A BGPsec design SHOULD provide some level of assurance\
    \ that the\n        origin of a prefix is still 'alive', i.e., that a monkey in\
    \ the\n        middle has not withheld a WITHDRAW message or the effects\n   \
    \     thereof.\n   4.5  The AS Path of an UPDATE message SHOULD be able to be\n\
    \        authenticated as the message is processed.\n   4.6  Normal sanity checks\
    \ of received announcements MUST be done,\n        e.g., verification that the\
    \ first element of the AS_PATH list\n        corresponds to the locally configured\
    \ AS of the peer from which\n        the UPDATE was received.\n   4.7  The output\
    \ of a router applying BGPsec validation to a received\n        UPDATE MUST be\
    \ unequivocal and conform to a fully specified\n        state in the design.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   If an external \"security infrastructure\" is\
    \ used, as mentioned in\n   Section 3, paragraphs 9 and 17 above, the authenticity\
    \ and integrity\n   of the data of such an infrastructure MUST be assured.  In\
    \ addition,\n   the integrity of those data MUST be assured when they are used\
    \ by\n   BGPsec, e.g., in transport.\n   The requirement of backward compatibility\
    \ to BGP4 may open an avenue\n   to downgrade attacks.\n   The data plane might\
    \ not follow the path signaled by the control\n   plane.\n   Security for subscriber\
    \ traffic is outside the scope of this document\n   and of BGP security in general.\
    \  IETF standards for payload data\n   security should be employed.  While adoption\
    \ of BGP security measures\n   may ameliorate some classes of attacks on traffic,\
    \ these measures are\n   not a substitute for use of subscriber-based security.\n"
