  - "Introduction\n   The Computer Science Department of the University of California,\
    \ Los\n   Angeles (UCLA) organized a Symposium on Very High Speed Information\n\
    \   Networks as the first in a projected series of meetings on Advanced\n   Computer\
    \ Technologies, thus ACT ONE.  The time was chosen to also\n   commemorate the\
    \ 20th anniversary of the installation of the first\n   Interface Message Processor\
    \ (IMP) on the ARPANET which took place at\n   UCLA.\n   The Symposium took on\
    \ a theatrical theme and a few of the speakers\n   could not resist the temptation\
    \ to commit poetry.  This memo is an\n   attempt to capture the result.\n"

  - "The Poems\n                             Leonard Kleinrock\n   We've gathered\
    \ here for two days to examine and debate\n   And reflect on data networks and\
    \ as well to celebrate.\n   To recognize the leaders and recount the path we took.\n\
    \   We'll begin with how it happened; for it's time to take a look.\n   Yes, the\
    \ history is legend and the pioneers are here.\n   Listen to the story - it's\
    \ our job to make it clear.\n   We'll tell you where we are now and where we'll\
    \ likely go.\n   So welcome to ACT ONE, folks.  Sit back - enjoy the show!!\n\
    \                              ODE TO A QUEUE\n                              \
    \      by\n                             Leonard Kleinrock\n                  \
    \ In the 20 years of funding\n                   Many fields has DARPA led.\n\
    \                   But the finest thing that they did bring\n               \
    \    Was the analytic thread.\n                   By that I mean they nurtured\n\
    \                   Quantitative research tools.\n                   And they\
    \ always felt for all their gelt\n                   They got principles and rules.\n\
    \                   Indeed a wealth of knowledge\n                   Was uncovered\
    \ and was new.\n                   And the common thread with which we led\n \
    \                  Was the analytic queue!\n                   Now a queue may\
    \ have one server.\n                   If there's more, they form a team.\n  \
    \                 Its dearest wish is just to fish\n                   In a quiet\
    \ Poisson stream.\n                   If you want to model networks\n        \
    \           Or a complex data flow\n                   A queue's the key to help\
    \ you see\n                   All the things you need to know.\n             \
    \      So the next time you feel lonely\n                   And wonder what to\
    \ do,\n                   You'll soon feel fine if you join the line\n       \
    \            Of an analytic queue!\n                           THE PAST IS PROLOGUE\n\
    \                                    by\n                             Leonard\
    \ Kleinrock\n                   The past is prologue so they say.\n          \
    \         So Scene 1 was played today.\n                   It set the stage to\
    \ point the way\n                   To high speed nets on Friday.\n          \
    \         And old slow IMP, a costly link,\n                   Codes to fix the\
    \ lines that stink,\n                   Ideas born in tanks that think,\n    \
    \               Tomorrow's distance sure to shrink.\n                   But first\
    \ tonight we'll drink and eat.\n                   We'll take some time good friends\
    \ to greet.\n                   Hear Bible class from Danny's seat.\n        \
    \           Those good old days were bittersweet!\n                          \
    \     THE BIG BANG!\n                       (or the birth of the ARPANET)\n  \
    \                                  by\n                             Leonard Kleinrock\n\
    \   It was back in '67 that the clan agreed to meet.\n   The gangsters and the\
    \ planners were a breed damned hard to beat.\n   The goal we set was honest and\
    \ the need was clear to all:\n   Connect those big old mainframes and the minis,\
    \ lest they fall.\n   The spec was set quite rigid:  it must work without a hitch.\n\
    \   It should stand a single failure with an unattended switch.\n   Files at hefty\
    \ throughput 'cross the ARPANET must zip.\n   Send the interactive traffic on\
    \ a quarter second trip.\n   The spec went out to bidders and t'was BBN that won.\n\
    \   They worked on soft and hardware and they all got paid for fun.\n   We decided\
    \ that the first node would be we who are your hosts\n   And so today you're gathered\
    \ here while UCLA boasts.\n   I suspect you might be asking \"What means FIRST\
    \ node on the net?\"\n   Well frankly, it meant trouble, 'specially since no specs\
    \ were set.\n   For you see the interface between the nascent IMP and HOST\n \
    \  Was a confidential secret from us folks on the West coast.\n   BBN had promised\
    \ that the IMP was running late.\n   We welcomed any slippage in the deadly scheduled\
    \ date.\n   But one day after Labor Day, it was plopped down at our gate!\n  \
    \ Those dirty rotten scoundrels sent the damned thing out air freight!\n   As\
    \ I recall that Tuesday, it makes me want to cry.\n   Everybody's brother came\
    \ to blame the other guy!\n   Folks were there from ARPA, GTE and Honeywell.\n\
    \   UCLA and ATT and all were scared as hell.\n   We cautiously connected and\
    \ the bits began to flow.\n   The pieces really functioned - just why I still\
    \ don't know.\n   Messages were moving pretty well by Wednesday morn.\n   All\
    \ the rest is history - packet switching had been born!\n                    \
    \     ROSENCRANTZ AND ETHERNET\n                                    by\n     \
    \                            Vint Cerf\n   All the world's a net!  And all the\
    \ data in it merely packets\n   come to store-and-forward in the queues a while\
    \ and then are\n   heard no more.  'Tis a network waiting to be switched!\n  \
    \ To switch or not to switch?  That is the question.  Whether\n   'tis wiser in\
    \ the net to suffer the store and forward of\n   stochastic networks or to raise\
    \ up circuits against a sea\n   of packets and, by dedication, serve them.\n \
    \  To net, to switch.  To switch, perchance to slip!\n   Aye, there's the rub.\
    \  For in that choice of switch,\n   what loops may lurk, when we have shuffled\
    \ through\n   this Banyan net?  Puzzles the will, initiates symposia,\n   stirs\
    \ endless debate and gives rise to uncontrolled\n   flights of poetry beyond recompense!\n\
    \                                 UNTITLED\n                                 \
    \   by\n                                Barry Boehm\n                   Paul Baran\
    \ came out of the wood\n                   With a message first misunderstood\n\
    \                      But despite dangers lurking\n                      The\
    \ IMP's were soon working\n                   And ARPA did see it was good.\n\
    \                   So in place of our early myopia\n                   We now\
    \ have a net cornucopia\n                      With IMP's, TIP's, and LAN's\n\
    \                      Wideband VAN's, MAN's, and WAN's\n                   And\
    \ prospects of World Net Utopia.\n                   But though we must wind up\
    \ the clock\n                   With thoughts of downstream feature shock\n  \
    \                    We all be can mollified\n                      For there's\
    \ no one more qualified\n                   To discuss this than Leonard Kleinrock.\n"

    Ode to a Queue\" was presented in the Thursday morning session on\n   \"Giant\

    \ presented during the after dinner events on\n   Thursday night.\n   \"Rosencrantz\
    \ and Ethernet\" was presented at the morning session on\n   Friday on \"Communication\
    \ Technologies in the next Millenium\" (note\n   that this version may differ\
    \ slightly from the actual presentation\n   since it was reconstructed from human\
    \ memory several weeks later).\n   The untitled poem by Barry Boehm was presented\
    \ in the Friday\n   afternoon session on \"Impact on Government, Commerce and\
    \ Citizenry\".\n   Barry gave his talk on \"The Software Challenge to Our Technical\n\
    \   Aspirations\" then introduced the next speaker with this poem.\n"
