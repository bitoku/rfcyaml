  - "Abstract\n   This document summarizes the history of HTML development, and defines\n\
    \   the \"text/html\" MIME type by pointing to the relevant W3C\n   recommendations;\
    \ it is intended to obsolete the previous IETF\n   documents defining HTML, including\
    \ RFC 1866, RFC 1867, RFC 1980, RFC\n   1942 and RFC 2070, and to remove HTML\
    \ from IETF Standards Track.\n   This document was prepared at the request of\
    \ the W3C HTML working\n   group. Please send comments to www-html@w3.org, a public\
    \ mailing list\n   with archive at <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/>.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction and background
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction and background\n   HTML has been in use in the World Wide Web\
    \ information infrastructure\n   since 1990, and specified in various informal\
    \ documents.  The\n   text/html media type was first officially defined by the\
    \ IETF HTML\n   working group in 1995 in [HTML20]. Extensions to HTML were proposed\n\
    \   in [HTML30], [UPLOAD], [TABLES], [CLIMAPS], and [I18N].\n   The IETF HTML\
    \ working group closed Sep 1996, and work on defining\n   HTML moved to the World\
    \ Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The proposed\n   extensions were incorporated to\
    \ some extent in [HTML32], and to a\n   larger extent in [HTML40]. The definition\
    \ of multipart/form-data from\n   [UPLOAD] was described in [FORMDATA]. In addition,\
    \ a reformulation of\n   HTML 4.0 in XML 1.0[XHTML1] was developed.\n   [HTML32]\
    \ notes \"This specification defines HTML version 3.2. HTML 3.2\n   aims to capture\
    \ recommended practice as of early '96 and as such to\n   be used as a replacement\
    \ for HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866).\"  Subsequent\n   specifications for HTML describe\
    \ the differences in each version.\n   In addition to the development of standards,\
    \ a wide variety of\n   additional extensions, restrictions, and modifications\
    \ to HTML were\n   popularized by NCSA's Mosaic system and subsequently by the\n\
    \   competitive implementations of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft\n   Internet\
    \ Explorer; these extensions are documented in numerous books\n   and online guides.\n"
- title: 2. Registration of MIME media type text/html
  contents:
  - "2. Registration of MIME media type text/html\n   MIME media type name:      text\n\
    \   MIME subtype name:         html\n   Required parameters:       none\n   Optional\
    \ parameters:\n      charset\n         The optional parameter \"charset\" refers\
    \ to the character\n         encoding used to represent the HTML document as a\
    \ sequence of\n         bytes. Any registered IANA charset may be used, but UTF-8\
    \ is\n         preferred.  Although this parameter is optional, it is strongly\n\
    \         recommended that it always be present. See Section 6 below for\n   \
    \      a discussion of charset default rules.\n      Note that [HTML20] included\
    \ an optional \"level\" parameter; in\n      practice, this parameter was never\
    \ used and has been removed from\n      this specification.  [HTML30] also suggested\
    \ a \"version\"\n      parameter; in practice, this parameter also was never used\
    \ and has\n      been removed from this specification.\n   Encoding considerations:\n\
    \      See Section 4 of this document.\n   Security considerations:\n      See\
    \ Section 7 of this document.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n      HTML\
    \ is designed to be interoperable across the widest possible\n      range of platforms\
    \ and devices of varying capabilities.  However,\n      there are contexts (platforms\
    \ of limited display capability, for\n      example) where not all of the capabilities\
    \ of the full HTML\n      definition are feasible. There is ongoing work to develop\
    \ both a\n      modularization of HTML and a set of profiling capabilities to\n\
    \      identify and negotiate restricted (and extended) capabilities.\n      Due\
    \ to the long and distributed development of HTML, current\n      practice on\
    \ the Internet includes a wide variety of HTML variants.\n      Implementors of\
    \ text/html interpreters must be prepared to be\n      \"bug-compatible\" with\
    \ popular browsers in order to work with many\n      HTML documents available\
    \ the Internet.\n      Typically, different versions are distinguishable by the\
    \ DOCTYPE\n      declaration contained within them, although the DOCTYPE\n   \
    \   declaration itself is sometimes omitted or incorrect.\n   Published specification:\n\
    \      The text/html media type is now defined by W3C Recommendations;\n     \
    \ the latest published version is [HTML401].  In addition, [XHTML1]\n      defines\
    \ a profile of use of XHTML which is compatible with HTML\n      4.01 and which\
    \ may also be labeled as text/html.\n   Applications which use this media type:\n\
    \      The first and most common application of HTML is the World Wide\n     \
    \ Web; commonly, HTML documents contain URI references [URI] to\n      other documents\
    \ and media to be retrieved using the HTTP protocol\n      [HTTP]. Many gateway\
    \ applications provide HTML-based interfaces to\n      other underlying complex\
    \ services. Numerous other applications now\n      also use HTML as a convenient\
    \ platform-independent multimedia\n      document representation.\n   Additional\
    \ information:\n      Magic number:\n         There is no single initial string\
    \ that is always present for\n         HTML files. However, Section 5 below gives\
    \ some guidelines for\n         recognizing HTML files.\n      File extension:\n\
    \         The file extensions 'html' or 'htm' are commonly used, but\n       \
    \  other extensions denoting file formats for preprocessing are\n         also\
    \ common.\n      Macintosh File Type code: TEXT\n   Person & email address to\
    \ contact for further information:\n      Dan Connolly <connolly@w3.org>\n   \
    \   Larry Masinter <lmm@acm.org>\n   Intended usage: COMMON\n   Author/Change\
    \ controller:\n      The HTML specification is a work product of the World Wide\
    \ Web\n      Consortium's HTML Working Group.  The W3C has change control over\n\
    \      the HTML specification.\n   Further information:\n      HTML has a means\
    \ of including, by reference via URI, additional\n      resources (image, video\
    \ clip, applet) within the base document. In\n      order to transfer a complete\
    \ HTML object and the included\n      resources in a single MIME object, the mechanisms\
    \ of [MHTML] may\n      be used.\n"
- title: 3. Fragment Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3. Fragment Identifiers\n   The URI specification [URI] notes that the semantics\
    \ of a fragment\n   identifier (part of a URI after a \"#\") is a property of\
    \ the data\n   resulting from a retrieval action, and that the format and\n  \
    \ interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type\n   of\
    \ the retrieval result.\n   For documents labeled as text/html, the fragment identifier\n\
    \   designates the correspondingly named element; any element may be\n   named\
    \ with the \"id\" attribute, and A, APPLET, FRAME, IFRAME, IMG and\n   MAP elements\
    \ may be named with a \"name\" attribute.  This is described\n   in detail in\
    \ [HTML40] section 12.\n"
- title: 4. Encoding considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Encoding considerations\n   Because of the availability within HTML itself\
    \ for using character\n   entity references, documents that use a wide repertoire\
    \ of characters\n   may still be represented using the US-ASCII charset and transported\n\
    \   without encoding.  However, transport of text/html using a charset\n   other\
    \ than US-ASCII may require base64 or quoted-printable encoding\n   for 7-bit\
    \ channels.\n   As with all MIME text subtypes, the canonical form of \"text/html\"\
    \n   must always represent a line break as a sequence of a CR byte value\n   (0x0D)\
    \ followed by an LF (0x0A) byte value.  Similarly, any\n   occurrence of such\
    \ a CRLF sequence in \"text/html\" must represent a\n   line break.  Use of CR\
    \ byte values and LF byte values outside of line\n   break sequences is also forbidden.\
    \ This rule applies regardless of\n   the character encoding ('charset') involved.\n\
    \   Note, however, that the HTTP protocol allows the transport of data\n   not\
    \ in canonical form, and, in particular, with other end-of-line\n   conventions;\
    \ see [HTTP] section 3.7.1. This exception is commonly\n   used for HTML.\n  \
    \ HTML sent via email is still subject to the MIME restrictions; this\n   is discussed\
    \ fully in [MHTML] Section 10.\n"
- title: 5. Recognizing HTML files
  contents:
  - "5. Recognizing HTML files\n   Almost all HTML files have the string \"<html\"\
    \ or \"<HTML\" near the\n   beginning of the file.\n   Documents conformant to\
    \ HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.0 will start\n   with a DOCTYPE declaration \"\
    <!DOCTYPE HTML\" near the beginning,\n   before the \"<html\". These dialects\
    \ are case insensitive.  Files may\n   start with white space, comments (introduced\
    \ by \"<!--\" ), or\n   processing instructions (introduced by \"<?\") prior to\
    \ the DOCTYPE\n   declaration.\n   XHTML documents (optionally) start with an\
    \ XML declaration which\n   begins with \"<?xml\" and are required to have a DOCTYPE\
    \ declaration\n   \"<!DOCTYPE html\".\n"
- title: 6. Charset default rules
  contents:
  - "6. Charset default rules\n   The use of an explicit charset parameter is strongly\
    \ recommended.\n   While [MIME] specifies \"The default character set, which must\
    \ be\n   assumed in the absence of a charset parameter, is US-ASCII.\"  [HTTP]\n\
    \   Section 3.7.1, defines that \"media subtypes of the 'text' type are\n   defined\
    \ to have a default charset value of 'ISO-8859-1'\".  Section\n   19.3 of [HTTP]\
    \ gives additional guidelines.  Using an explicit\n   charset parameter will help\
    \ avoid confusion.\n   Using an explicit charset parameter also takes into account\
    \ that the\n   overwhelming majority of deployed browsers are set to use something\n\
    \   else than 'ISO-8859-1' as the default; the actual default is either a\n  \
    \ corporate character encoding or character encodings widely deployed\n   in a\
    \ certain national or regional community. For further\n   considerations, please\
    \ also see Section 5.2 of [HTML40].\n"
- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   [HTML401], section B.10, notes various security\
    \ issues with\n   interpreting anchors and forms in HTML documents.\n   In addition,\
    \ the introduction of scripting languages and interactive\n   capabilities in\
    \ HTML 4.0 introduced a number of security risks\n   associated with the automatic\
    \ execution of programs written by the\n   sender but interpreted by the recipient.\
    \  User agents executing such\n   scripts or programs must be extremely careful\
    \ to insure that\n   untrusted software is executed in a protected environment.\n"
