  - "               The Best Laid Plans . . .\nDr. Roberts informs me that it is now\
    \ unlikely that he will be\nable to attend the Monday afternoon session of the\
    \ NWG meeting,\nbut that he will be able to attend the Tuesday evening session.\n\
    Accordingly, the topics of \"Network Planning\" and \"other ARPA\nProjects\" are\
    \ moved to Tuesday evening, and on Monday afternoon,\nwe will take up as many\
    \ of the items originally scheduled for\nTuesday evening as we can.\nThe relevant\
    \ reading for Wednesday evening is RFC #131, not #113.\nIn general attendees should\
    \ read all of the RFC's since the last\nNWG meeting.\n   [ This RFC was put into\
    \ machine readable form for entry ]\n   [ into the online RFC archives by C. Harald\
    \ Koch  05/97 ]\n"
