- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is defined\
    \ in [RFC3748].\n   An EAP peer (hereafter, also referred to as the peer) may\
    \ have\n   multiple credentials.  Where the lower layer does not provide an\n\
    \   indication of which network it is connecting to, or where its home\n   network\
    \ may have roaming relationships with several mediating\n   networks, the peer\
    \ may be uncertain of which Network Access\n   Identifier (NAI) to include in\
    \ an EAP-Response/Identity.\n   This document defines a mechanism that allows\
    \ the access network to\n   provide an EAP peer with identity selection hints,\
    \ including\n   information about its roaming relationships.  This information\
    \ is\n   sent to the peer in an EAP-Request/Identity message by appending it\n\
    \   after the displayable message and a NUL character.\n   This mechanism may\
    \ assist the peer in selecting a credential and\n   associated NAI, or in formatting\
    \ the NAI [RFC4282] to facilitate\n   routing of Authentication, Authorization,\
    \ and Accounting (AAA)\n   messages to the home AAA server.  If there are several\
    \ mediating\n   networks available, the peer can influence which one is used.\n\
    \   Exactly how the selection is made by the peer depends largely on the\n   peer's\
    \ local policy and configuration, and is outside the scope of\n   this document.\
    \  For example, the peer could decide to use one of its\n   other identities,\
    \ decide to switch to another access network, or\n   attempt to reformat its NAI\
    \ [RFC4282] to assist in proper AAA\n   routing.  The exact client behavior is\
    \ described by standard bodies\n   using this specification such as 3GPP [TS-24.234].\n\
    \   Section 2 describes the required behavior of implementations,\n   including\
    \ the format for identity hints.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Relationship with Other Specifications
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Relationship with Other Specifications\n   This document specifies behavior\
    \ of Remote Authentication Dial-In\n   User Service (RADIUS) proxies that handle\
    \ EAP messages.  This\n   includes the specification of the behavior of proxies\
    \ in response to\n   an unknown realm within the User-Name(1) attribute of an\n\
    \   Access-Request containing one or more EAP-Message attributes.  This\n   document,\
    \ if used in a scenario requiring NAI \"decoration\" as\n   specified in [RFC4282],\
    \ assumes a source-routing model for\n   determination of the roaming relationship\
    \ path, and therefore affects\n   the behavior of RADIUS proxies in roaming situations.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Applicability\n   Identity hints are useful in situations where the peer\
    \ cannot\n   determine which credentials to use, or where there may be multiple\n\
    \   alternative routes by which an access network can reach a home\n   network.\
    \  This can occur when access networks support multiple\n   roaming consortiums\
    \ but do not have a full list of the home networks\n   reachable through them.\n\
    \   In such scenarios, identity hints (e.g., a list of roaming partners\n   of\
    \ the access network) can be provided to enable the EAP peer to\n   influence\
    \ route selection, using the NAI [RFC4282] to specify the\n   desired source route.\
    \  The immediate application of the proposed\n   mechanism is in 3GPP systems\
    \ interworking with WLANs [TS-23.234] and\n   [TS-24.234].\n   The number of hints\
    \ that can be provided by this mechanism is limited\n   by the EAP MTU.  For example,\
    \ assuming 20 octets per hint and an EAP\n   MTU of 1096, a maximum of 50 roaming\
    \ partners can be advertised.\n   Scaling limitations imposed by the EAP MTU should\
    \ be taken into\n   account when deploying this solution.\n   Since this mechanism\
    \ relies on information provided in the\n   EAP-Request/Identity packet, it is\
    \ necessary for the peer to select a\n   point of attachment prior to obtaining\
    \ identity hints.  Where there\n   are multiple points of attachment available,\
    \ the mechanism defined in\n   this specification does not allow the peer to utilize\
    \ the identity\n   hints in making a decision about which point of attachment\
    \ to select.\n   In roaming situations, this can require the peer to try multiple\n\
    \   points of attachment before it finds a compatible one, increasing\n   handoff\
    \ latency.\n   This document is related to the general network discovery and\n\
    \   selection problem described in [netsel-problem].  The proposed\n   mechanism\
    \ described in this document solves only a part of the\n   problem in [netsel-problem].\
    \  IEEE 802.11 is also looking into more\n   comprehensive and long-term solutions\
    \ for network discovery and\n   selection.\n"

- title: 2.  Implementation Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Implementation Requirements\n   The EAP authenticator MAY send an identity\
    \ hint to the peer in the\n   initial EAP-Request/Identity.  If the identity hint\
    \ is not sent\n   initially (such as when the authenticator does not support this\n\
    \   specification), then the EAP peer may select the wrong NAI.  If the\n   local\
    \ AAA proxy does not have a default route configured, then it may\n   find that\
    \ the User-Name(1) attribute in the request contains a realm\n   for which there\
    \ is no corresponding route.\n   As noted in [RFC2607], Section 5.1:\n   \"Proxies\
    \ are frequently used to implement policy in roaming\n   situations.  Proxies\
    \ implementing policy MAY reply directly to\n   Access-Requests without forwarding\
    \ the request.  When replying\n   directly to an Access-Request, the proxy MUST\
    \ reply either with an\n   Access-Reject or an Access-Challenge packet.  A proxy\
    \ MUST NOT reply\n   directly with an Access-Accept.\"\n   Where no route is found,\
    \ existing AAA proxies will typically send an\n   Access-Reject.  However, where\
    \ the request contains an EAP-Message\n   attribute, AAA proxies implementing\
    \ this specification should instead\n   reply with a challenge including an identity\
    \ hint.\n   For example, if a RADIUS proxy receives an Access-Request with an\n\
    \   EAP-Message attribute and a User-Name(1) attribute containing an\n   unknown\
    \ realm, it SHOULD reply with an Access-Challenge with an\n   EAP-Message attribute\
    \ encapsulating an EAP-Request/Identity packet\n   containing an identity hint,\
    \ rather than an Access-Reject.  See\n   \"Option 3\" in the appendix for the\
    \ message flow diagram.\n   If the peer responds with an EAP-Response/Identity\
    \ containing an\n   unknown realm after the local AAA proxy sends an identity\
    \ hint, then\n   a local AAA proxy/server implementing this specification MUST\n\
    \   eventually send an Access-Reject containing an EAP-Failure.  Prior to\n  \
    \ doing so, it MAY send an Access-Challenge containing an\n   EAP-Notification,\
    \ in order to provide an explanation for the failure.\n   In order to determine\
    \ whether an identity hint had been previously\n   sent, the State(24) attribute\
    \ defined in [RFC2865] can be used.\n   As noted in [RFC3748], Section 3.1, the\
    \ minimum EAP MTU size is 1020\n   octets.  EAP does not support fragmentation\
    \ of EAP-Request/Identity\n   messages, so the maximum length of the identity\
    \ hint information is\n   limited by the link MTU.\n"

- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Identity hint information is delivered inside\
    \ an EAP-Request/Identity\n   before the authentication conversation begins. \
    \ Therefore, it can be\n   modified by an attacker.  The NAIRealms attribute therefore\
    \ MUST be\n   treated as a hint by the peer.  That is, the peer must treat the\
    \ hint\n   as an unreliable indication\n   Unauthenticated hints may result in\
    \ peers inadvertently revealing\n   additional identities, thus compromising privacy.\
    \  Since the\n   EAP-Response/Identity is sent in the clear, this vulnerability\n\
    \   already exists.  This vulnerability can be addressed via\n   method-specific\
    \ identity exchanges.\n   Similarly, in a situation where the peer has multiple\
    \ identities to\n   choose from, an attacker can use a forged hint to convince\
    \ the peer\n   to choose an identity bound to a weak EAP method.  Requiring the\
    \ use\n   of strong EAP methods can protect against this.  A similar issue\n \
    \  already exists with respect to unprotected link-layer advertisements\n   such\
    \ as 802.11 SSIDs.\n   If the identity hint is used to select a mediating network,\
    \ existing\n   EAP methods may not provide a way for the home AAA server to verify\n\
    \   that the mediating network selected by the peer was actually used.\n   Any\
    \ information revealed either from the network or client sides\n   before authentication\
    \ has occurred can be seen as a security risk.\n   For instance, revealing the\
    \ existence of a network that uses a weak\n   authentication method can make it\
    \ easier for attackers to discover\n   that such a network is accessible.  Therefore,\
    \ the consent of the\n   network being advertised in the hints is required before\
    \ such hints\n   can be sent.\n"

  - "5.  Appendix - Delivery Options\n   Although the delivery options are described\
    \ in the context of IEEE\n   802.11 access networks, they are also applicable\
    \ to other access\n   networks that use EAP [RFC3748] for authentication and use\
    \ the NAI\n   format [RFC4282] for identifying users.\n   The options assume that\
    \ the AAA protocol in use is RADIUS [RFC2865].\n   However, Diameter [RFC3588]\
    \ could also be used instead of RADIUS\n   without introducing significant architectural\
    \ differences.\n   The main difference amongst the options is which entity in\
    \ the access\n   network creates the EAP-Request/Identity.  For example, the role\
    \ of\n   the EAP server may be played by the EAP authenticator (where an\n   initial\
    \ EAP-Request/Identity is sent with an identity hint) or a\n   RADIUS proxy/server\
    \ (where the NAIRealm is used for forwarding).\n   The RADIUS proxy/server acts\
