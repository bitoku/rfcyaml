- title: 1.  Introduction and Scope
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Scope\n   This document provides non-normative guidance\
    \ to aid in the\n   understanding of collaboration on standards development between\
    \ the\n   Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International\n   Telecommunication\
    \ Union (ITU-T) and the Internet Engineering Task\n   Force (IETF) of the Internet\
    \ Society (ISOC).  Early identification of\n   topics of mutual interest will\
    \ allow for constructive efforts between\n   the two organizations based on mutual\
    \ respect.\n   In the IETF, work is done in working groups (WGs), mostly through\n\
    \   open, public mailing lists rather than face-to-face meetings.  WGs\n   are\
    \ organized into areas, each area being managed by two co-area\n   directors.\
    \  Collectively, the area directors comprise the Internet\n   Engineering Steering\
    \ Group (IESG).\n   In the ITU-T, work is defined by study Questions which are\
    \ worked on\n   mostly through meetings led by rapporteurs (these are sometimes\n\
    \   called \"rapporteur's group\" meetings).  Questions are generally\n   grouped\
    \ within working parties (WPs) led by a WP chairman.  Working\n   parties report\
    \ to a parent study group (SG) led by an SG chairman.\n   Work may also be conducted\
    \ in ITU-T focus groups (see Section 2.7).\n   To foster ongoing communication\
    \ between the ITU-T and IETF, it is\n   important to identify and establish contact\
    \ points within each\n   organization.  Contact points may include:\n   1. ITU-T\
    \ Study Group Chairman and IETF Area Director\n      An IETF area director is\
    \ the individual responsible for overseeing\n      a major focus of activity with\
    \ a scope similar to that of an ITU-T\n      study group chairman.  These positions\
    \ are both relatively long-\n      term (of several years) and offer the stability\
    \ of contact points\n      between the two organizations for a given topic.\n\
    \   2. ITU-T Rapporteur and IETF Working Group Chair\n      An IETF working group\
    \ chair is an individual who is assigned to\n      lead the work on a specific\
    \ task within one particular area with a\n      scope similar to that of an ITU-T\
    \ rapporteur.  These positions are\n      working positions (of a year or more)\
    \ that typically end when the\n      work on a specific topic ends.  Collaboration\
    \ here is very\n      beneficial to ensure the actual work gets done.\n   3. Other\
    \ Contact Points\n      It may be beneficial to establish additional contact points\
    \ for\n      specific topics of mutual interest.  These contact points should\n\
    \      be established early in the work effort, and in some cases the\n      contact\
    \ point identified by each organization may be the same\n      individual.  ITU-T\
    \ has an additional level of management, the\n      working party chairman.  From\
    \ time to time, it may be beneficial\n      for this person to exchange views\
    \ with IETF working group chairs\n      and area directors.\n   Note: The current\
    \ list of IETF area directors and working group\n   chairs can be found in the\
    \ IETF working group charters.  The current\n   ITU-T study group chairmen and\
    \ rapporteurs are listed on the ITU-T\n   study group web pages.\n"

    \ within the IETF and\n   ITU-T may be utilized to enable collaboration between\
    \ the\n   organizations.\n"
- title: 2.1.  How to Interact on ITU-T or IETF Work Items
  contents:
  - "2.1.  How to Interact on ITU-T or IETF Work Items\n   Study groups that have\
    \ identified work topics that are related to the\n   Internet Protocol (IP) should\
    \ evaluate the relationship with topics\n   defined in the IETF. Current IETF\
    \ working groups and their charters\n   (IETF definition of the scope of work)\
    \ are listed in the IETF\n   archives (see Section 2.8.1).\n   A study group may\
    \ decide that development of a Recommendation on a\n   particular topic may benefit\
    \ from collaboration with the IETF.  The\n   study group should identify this\
    \ collaboration in its work plan\n   (specifically in that of each Question involved),\
    \ describing the goal\n   of the collaboration and its expected outcome.\n   An\
    \ IETF working group should also evaluate and identify areas of\n   relationship\
    \ with the ITU-T and document the collaboration with the\n   ITU-T study group\
    \ in its charter.\n   The following sections outline a process that can be used\
    \ to enable\n   each group to be informed about the other's new work items.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  How the ITU-T Is Informed about Existing IETF Work Items
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  How the ITU-T Is Informed about Existing IETF Work Items\n   The responsibility\
    \ is on individual study groups to review the\n   current IETF working groups\
    \ to determine if there are any topics of\n   mutual interest.  Working group\
    \ charters and active Internet-Drafts\n   can be found on the IETF web site (http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/).\n\
    \   If a study group identifies a common area of work, the study group\n   leadership\
    \ should contact both the IETF working group chair and the\n   area director(s)\
    \ responsible.  This may be accompanied by a formal\n   liaison statement (see\
    \ Section 2.3).\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  How the IETF Is Informed about Existing ITU-T Work Items
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  How the IETF Is Informed about Existing ITU-T Work Items\n   The IETF\
    \ through its representatives will review the current work of\n   the various\
    \ study groups from time to time.  Each ITU-T study group's\n   web page on the\
    \ ITU-T web site contains its current list of Questions\n   as well as its current\
    \ work programme.  When an area or working group\n   identifies a common area\
    \ of work, the matter is referred to\n   appropriate working group chairs and\
    \ area directors, where they may\n   consider sending a liaison statement to the\
    \ appropriate study group.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  How the ITU-T Is Informed about Proposed New IETF Work Items
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  How the ITU-T Is Informed about Proposed New IETF Work Items\n   The\
    \ IETF maintains a mailing list for the distribution of proposed\n   new work\
    \ items among standards development organizations.  Many such\n   items can be\
    \ identified in proposed Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF)\n   sessions, as well as draft\
    \ charters for working groups.  The IETF\n   forwards all such draft charters\
    \ for all new and revised working\n   groups and BOF session announcements to\
    \ the IETF new-work mailing\n   list.  An ITU-T mailing list is subscribed to\
    \ this list. Leadership\n   of study groups may subscribe to this ITU-T mailing\
    \ list, which is\n   maintained by the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau\
    \ (TSB).\n   Members of the SG-specific listname may include the SG chairman,\
    \ SG\n   vice-chairmen, working party chairmen, concerned rapporteurs, other\n\
    \   experts designated by the SG, and the SG Counsellor.  This will\n   enable\
    \ the SGs to monitor the new work items for possible overlap or\n   interest to\
    \ their study group.  It is expected that this mailing list\n   will see a few\
    \ messages per month.\n   Each SG chairman, or designated representative, may\
    \ provide comments\n   on these charters by responding to the IESG mailing list\
    \ at\n   iesg@ietf.org clearly indicating their ITU-T position and the nature\n\
    \   of their concern.  Plain-text email is preferred on the IESG mailing\n   list.\n\
    \   It should be noted that the IETF turnaround time for new working\n   group\
    \ charters can be as short as two weeks.  As a result, the\n   mailing list should\
    \ be consistently monitored.\n"
- title: 2.1.4.  How the IETF Is Informed about ITU-T Work Items
  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  How the IETF Is Informed about ITU-T Work Items\n   The ITU-T accepts\
    \ new areas of work through the creation or update of\n   Questions and these\
    \ can be found on the ITU-T study group web pages.\n   In addition, the ITU-T\
    \ work programme is documented on each ITU-T\n   study group's web page on the\
    \ ITU-T web site.\n   Study groups send updates to the IETF new-work mailing list\
    \ as new\n   Questions are first drafted or created, terms of reference for\n\
    \   Questions are first drafted or updated, or otherwise when there is\n   reason\
    \ to believe that a particular effort might be of interest to\n   the IETF.  Area\
    \ directors or WG chairs should provide comments\n   through liaison statements\
    \ or direct email to the relevant SG\n   chairman in cases of possible overlap\
    \ or interest.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Representation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Representation\n   ISOC, including its standards body IETF, is a Sector\
    \ Member of the\n   ITU-T.  As a result, ISOC delegates are afforded the same\

    \   delegates may participate in the work of the IETF as representatives\n   of\
    \ the ITU-T (see Section 2.2.2).  To promote collaboration, it is\n   useful to\
    \ facilitate communication between the organizations as\n   further described\
    \ below.\n"

    \ verification of\n   these people, as appropriate.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  ITU-T Recognition at ISOC/IETF
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  ITU-T Recognition at ISOC/IETF\n   ITU-T study group chairmen can authorize\
    \ one or more members to\n   attend an IETF meeting as an official ITU-T delegate\
    \ speaking\n   authoritatively on behalf of the activities of the study group\
    \ (or a\n   particular rapporteur group).  The study group chairman sends the\n\
    \   ITU-T list of delegates by email to the working group chair, with a\n   copy\
    \ to the area directors, and also to the study group.  According\n   to IETF process,\
    \ opinions expressed by any such delegate are given\n   equal weight with opinions\
    \ expressed by any other working group\n   participant.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Communication outside of Meetings
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Communication outside of Meetings\n   Informal communication between contact\
    \ points and experts of both\n   organizations is encouraged.  However, formal\
    \ communication from an\n   ITU-T study group, working party, or rapporteur group\
    \ to an\n   associated IETF contact point must be explicitly approved and\n  \
    \ identified as coming from the study group, working party, or\n   rapporteur\
    \ group, respectively.  Formal liaison statements from the\n   ITU-T to the IETF\
    \ are transmitted according to the procedures\n   described in RFC 4053 [2]. \
    \ These liaison statements are placed by\n   the IETF onto a liaison statements\
    \ web page at\n   https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/.  An individual at the\
    \ IETF is\n   assigned responsibility for dealing with each liaison statement\
    \ that\n   is received.  The name and contact information of the responsible\n\
    \   person and any applicable deadline is listed with the links to the\n   liaison\
    \ statement on this web page.\n   Formal liaison statements from the Internet\
    \ Architecture Board (IAB),\n   the IESG, the IETF, an IETF working group or area\
    \ to the ITU-T are\n   generated, approved, and transmitted according to the procedures\n\
    \   described in RFC 4053 [2] and Recommendation ITU-T A.1 [15].  Formal\n   communication\
    \ is intended to allow the sharing of positions between\n   the IETF and the ITU-T\
    \ outside of actual documents (as described in\n   Section 2.5.1).  This covers\
    \ such things as comments on documents and\n   requests for input.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Mailing Lists\n   All IETF working groups and all ITU-T study group Questions\
    \ have\n   associated mailing lists.\n   In the IETF, the mailing list is the\
    \ primary vehicle for discussion\n   and decision-making.  It is recommended that\
    \ the ITU-T experts\n   interested in particular IETF working group topics subscribe\
    \ to and\n   participate in these lists.  IETF WG mailing lists are open to all\n\
    \   subscribers.  The IETF working group mailing list subscription and\n   archive\
    \ information are noted in each working group's charter.  In\n   the ITU-T, the\
    \ TSB has set up formal mailing lists for Questions,\n   working parties, and\
    \ other topics within study groups (more detail\n   can be found on the ITU-T\
    \ web site).  These mailing lists are\n   typically used for ITU-T correspondence,\
    \ including technical\n   discussion, meeting logistics, reports, etc.\n   Note:\
    \ Individual subscribers to this list must be affiliated with an\n   ITU-T member\
    \ or associate (at this time, there is no blanket\n   inclusion of all IETF participants\
    \ as members, however, as a member,\n   the ISOC focal point can facilitate access\
    \ by IETF technical experts,\n   liaison representatives, or liaison managers).\n\
    \   IETF participants may subscribe to ITU-T focus group email lists if\n   they\
    \ are individuals from a country that is a member of ITU-T.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Document Sharing
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Document Sharing\n   During the course of ITU-T and IETF collaboration,\
    \ it is important to\n   share working drafts and documents among the technical\
    \ working\n   groups.  Initially proposed concepts and specifications typically\
    \ can\n   be circulated by email (often just repeating the concept and not\n \
    \  including the details of the specification) on both the IETF and\n   ITU-T\
    \ mailing lists.  In addition, working texts (or URLs) of draft\n   Recommendations,\
    \ Internet-Drafts, or RFCs may also be sent between\n   the organizations as described\
    \ below.\n   Internet-Drafts are available on the IETF web site.  The ITU-T can\n\
    \   make selected ITU-T documents at any stage of development available\n   to\
    \ the IETF by attaching them to a formal liaison statement.\n   Although a communication\
    \ can point to a URL where a non-ASCII\n   document (e.g., Word) can be downloaded,\
    \ attachments in proprietary\n   formats to an IETF mailing list are discouraged.\
    \  It should also be\n   recognized that the official versions of all IETF documents\
    \ are in\n   ASCII.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.5.1.  Contributions and Liaison Statements from the IETF to ITU-T\n   IETF\
    \ documents (e.g., Internet-Drafts) or URLs of those documents are\n   most commonly\
    \ transmitted to ITU-T study groups as liaison statements\n   (see RFC 4053 [2]),\
    \ but exceptionally can be submitted to a study\n   group as a contribution from\
    \ ISOC in accordance with Recommendation\n   ITU-T A.2 [16].  In order to ensure\
    \ that the IETF has properly\n   authorized this, the IETF working group must\
    \ agree that the specific\n   drafts are of mutual interest; that there is a benefit\
    \ in forwarding\n   them to the ITU-T for review, comment, and potential use;\
    \ and that\n   the document status is accurately represented in the cover letter.\n\
    \   Once agreed, the appropriate area directors review the working group\n   request\
    \ and give approval.  The rules of the IETF Trust are followed\n   in these circumstances\
    \ [3].  The contributions are then forwarded\n   (with the noted approval) to\
    \ the TSB for circulation as a\n   contribution to the appropriate ITU-T study\
    \ group.  Material\n   submitted to the ITU-T as an ISOC contribution is governed\
    \ by clause\n   3.1.5 of Recommendation ITU-T A.1 [15].  Any such contribution\
    \ will\n   be made only after receiving necessary approval of owners of the work\n\

  - "2.6.  Simple Cross Referencing\n   Recommendation ITU-T A.5 [6] describes the\
    \ process for including\n   references to documents of other organizations in\
    \ ITU-T\n   Recommendations.  Recommendation ITU-T A.5 also addresses the\n  \
    \ situation where a study group or working party decides to incorporate\n   the\
    \ text of another organization into the text of a Recommendation,\n   rather than\
    \ referencing it.  Information specific to referencing IETF\n   RFCs is found\
    \ at http://itu.int/ITU-T/go/ref-ietf-isoc.\n   Section 6.1.1 of RFC 2026 [7]\
    \ describes the process for referencing\n   other open standards (like ITU-T Recommendations)\
    \ in IETF RFCs.\n"

  - "2.7.  Preliminary Work Efforts\n   Both ITU-T and IETF provide mechanisms for\
    \ early discussion of\n   potential new work areas prior to the official start\
    \ of work in an\n   ITU-T study group or creation of an IETF working group.\n\
    \   Objectives, methods, and procedures for the creation and operation of\n  \
    \ ITU-T focus groups are defined in Recommendation ITU-T A.7 [17].\n   Focus groups\
    \ are frequently created in new work areas where there is\n   a need for deliverables\
    \ to be produced on a specific topic within a\n   short timeframe.  IETF participants\
    \ who are not members or associates\n   of ITU-T may participate fully in the\
    \ work of ITU-T focus groups if\n   they are from a country that is a member of\
    \ ITU-T.\n   In the IETF, guidance for BOF sessions is provided in RFC 5434 [13].\n\
    \   Efforts that have not yet reached the working group stage may be\n   discussed\
    \ in BOF sessions.  These sessions typically gauge interest\n   in pursuing creation\
    \ of working groups.  In some cases, these\n   discussions continue on mailing\
    \ lists.\n"
