Abstract This document defines a subset of a Management Information Base (MIB) for energy management of devices.
The module addresses device identification, context information, and the energy relationships between devices.
The Energy Management (EMAN) standards provide a specification for Energy Management.
This document defines a subset of a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols for Energy monitoring of network devices and devices attached to the network and possibly extending to devices in the industrial automation setting with a network interface.
The focus of the MIB module specified in this document is on the identification of Energy Objects and reporting the context and relationships of Energy Objects as defined in [RFC7326].
The module addresses Energy Object identification, Energy Object context, and Energy Object relationships.
This document specifies the Energy Object Context (ENERGY OBJECT  CONTEXT MIB) and IANA Energy Relationship (IANA ENERGY RELATION MIB) modules.
The Energy Object Context MIB module specifies MIB objects for identification of Energy Objects, and reporting context and relationship of an Energy Object.
The IANA Energy Relationship MIB module specifies the first version of the IANA maintained definitions of relationships between Energy Objects.
Firstly, to illustrate the importance of energy monitoring in networks and, secondly, to list some of the important areas to be addressed by the Energy Management Framework [RFC7326], several use cases and network scenarios are presented in the EMAN applicability statement document [EMAN AS].
In addition, for each scenario, the target devices for energy management, and how those devices powered and metered are also presented.
To address the network scenarios, requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking devices are specified in [RFC6988].
Based on the requirements in [RFC6988], [RFC7326] presents a solution approach.
Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this document is in accordance to the requirements specified in [RFC6988] and the concepts from [RFC7326].
This document is based on the Energy Management Framework [RFC7326] and meets the requirements on identification of Energy Objects and their context and relationships as specified in the Energy Management requirements document [RFC6988].
A second MIB module meeting the EMAN requirements [RFC6988] the Monitoring and Control MIB for Power and Energy [RFC7460], monitors the Energy Objects for Power States, for the Power and Energy consumption.
Power State monitoring includes: retrieving Power States, Power State properties, current Power State, Power State transitions, and Power State statistics.
In addition, this MIB module provides the Power Characteristics properties of the Power and Energy, along with optional characteristics.
The applicability statement document [EMAN AS] provides the list of use cases, describes the common aspects between existing Energy standards and the EMAN standard, and shows how the EMAN framework relates to other frameworks.

The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant with SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Terminology Please refer to [RFC7326] for the definitions of the following terminology used in this document.

Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Module
This section describes the basic concepts specified in the Energy Management Framework [RFC7326], with specific information related to the MIB modules specified in this document.
The Energy Object Context (ENERGY OBJECT CONTEXT MIB)
MIB module in this document specifies MIB objects for the identification of Energy Objects and reporting context and relationship of an Energy Object.
The managed objects are contained in two tables: eoTable and eoRelationTable.
The first table, eoTable, focuses on the link to the other MIB modules, on identification, and on the context of the Energy Object.
The second table, eoRelationTable, specifies the relationships between Energy Objects.
This is a simplified representation of the relationship between Energy Objects.
A "smidump style" tree presentation of the MIB modules contained in the document is presented.
" " n" "read only
The following Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram illustrates the relationship of the MIB objects in the eoTable, eoRelationTable, and ENTITY MIB.
The MIB objects describe the identity, context, and relationship of an Energy Object.
The UML diagram, furthermore, contains objects from the ENTITY MIB [RFC6933].
Link with the Power over Ethernet MIB
[LLDP MIB] [LLDP MED MIB] Figure 1:
MIB Objects Grouping As displayed in Figure 1, the MIB objects can be classified in different logical grouping of MIB objects.
See Section 5.1 "Energy Object Identification".
Devices and their sub components are characterized by the power related attributes of a physical entity present in the ENTITY MIB [RFC6933].
See Section 4.1 "Energy Object Context".
The links to other MIB modules.
See Section 4.3 "Links to Other Identifiers".
The Energy Object Relationships specific information.
See Section 4.4 "Energy Object Relationships".
The Energy Object Identity Persistence.
See Section 4.5 "Energy Object Identity Persistence".
Energy Object Identification Refer to the "Identification" section in [RFC7326] for background information about Energy Objects.
Every Energy Object MUST implement the unique index, entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalName, entPhysicalClass, and entPhysicalUUID from the ENTITY MIB
Module Compliance with respect to entity4CRCompliance of ENTITY MIB MUST be supported, which requires a limited number of objects supported (entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalName, entPhysicalClass, and entPhysicalUUID).
entPhysicalIndex is used as index for the Energy Object in the ENERGY OBJECT
Every Energy Object MUST have a printable name assigned to it.
Energy Objects MUST implement the entPhysicalName object specified in the ENTITY MIB [RFC6933], which must contain the Energy Object name.
For the ENERGY OBJECT CONTEXT MIB compliance, every Energy Object instance MUST implement the entPhysicalUUID from the ENTITY MIB [RFC6933].
As displayed in [RFC4122], the following is an example of the string representation of a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) as a URN:
For example, to understand the relationship between Energy Object Components and Energy Objects, the ENTITY MIB physical containment tree [RFC6933] MUST be implemented.
A second example deals with one of the ENTITY MIB extensions: if the Energy Object temperature is required, the managed objects from the ENTITY SENSOR MIB [RFC3433] should be supported.
Each Energy Object MUST belong to a single Energy Management Domain or in other words, an Energy Object cannot belong to more than one Energy Management Domain.
Refer to the "Context: Domain" section in [RFC7326] for background information.
The eoDomainName, which is an element of the eoTable, is a read write MIB object.
The Energy Management Domain should map 1:1 with a metered or sub metered portion of the network.
The Energy Management Domain MUST be configured on the Energy Object.
The Energy Object MAY inherit some of the domain parameters (possibly domain name, some of the context information such as role or keywords, importance) from the Energy Object or the Energy Management Domain MAY be configured directly in an Energy Object.
When an Energy Object acts as a Power Aggregator, the Energy Objects for which Power should be aggregated MUST be members of the same Energy Management Domain, specified by the eoDomainName MIB Object.
Energy Object Context Refer to the "Context: Domain" section in [RFC7326] for background information.
An Energy Object must provide a value for eoImportance in the range of 1 100 to help differentiate the use or relative value of the device.
The importance range is from 1 (least important) to 100 (most important).
The default importance value is 1.
An Energy Object can provide a set of eoKeywords.
These keywords are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary reporting within or between Energy Management Domains.
An Energy Object can have Power Interfaces and those interfaces can be classified as Power Inlet, Power Outlet, or both.
An Energy Object can be classified based on the physical properties of the Energy Object.
That Energy Object can be classified as consuming power or supplying power to other devices or that Energy Object can perform both of those functions and finally, an Energy Object can be a passive meter.
Additionally, an Energy Object can provide an eoRoleDescription string that indicates the purpose the Energy Object serves in the network.
While the entPhysicalIndex is the primary index for all MIB objects in the ENERGY OBJECT CONTEXT MIB module, the Energy Management Systems (EnMS) must be able to make the link with the identifier(s) in other supported MIB modules.
If the Energy Object is a Power over Ethernet (PoE) port, and if the Power over Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported by the SNMP agent managing the Energy Object, then the Energy Objects eoethPortIndex and eoethPortGrpIndex MUST contain the corresponding values of pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex
If the LLDP MED MIB [LLDP MIB] is supported by the Energy Object SNMP agent, then the Energy Object eoLldpPortNumber MUST contain the corresponding lldpLocPortNum from the LLDP MIB.
The intent behind the links to the other MIB module identifier(s) is to correlate the instances in the different MIB modules.
This will allow the ENERGY OBJECT CONTEXT MIB module to reference other MIB modules in cases where the Power over Ethernet and the LLDP MIB modules are supported by the SNMP agent.
Some use cases may not implement either of these two MIB modules for the Energy Objects.
However, in situations where either of these two MIB modules are implemented, the EnMS must be able to correlate the instances in the different MIB modules.
The eoAlternateKey object specifies an alternate key string that can be used to identify the Energy Object.
Since an EnMS may need to correlate objects across management systems, this alternate key is provided to facilitate such a link.
This optional value is intended as a foreign key or alternate identifier for a manufacturer or EnMS to use to correlate the unique Energy Object Id in other systems or namespaces.
If an alternate key is not available or is not applicable, then the value is the zero length string.
An Energy Object can have additional MIB objects that can be used for easier identification by the EnMS.
The optional objects eoMgmtMacAddress, eoMgmtAddressType, and eoMgmtDNSName can be used to help identify the relationship between the Energy Objects and other NMS objects.
These objects can be used as an alternate key to help link the Energy Object with other keyed information that may be stored within the EnMS(s).
For the optional objects that may not be included in some vendor implementations, the expected behavior when those objects are polled is a response noSuchInstance.
Energy Object Relationships Refer to the "Relationships" section in [RFC7326] for the definition and background information.
In order to link two Energy Objects, a separate table (eoRelationTable) has been introduced in this MIB module.
Each Energy Object can have one or more Energy Object relationships with other Energy Objects.
The relationship between Energy Objects is specified in eoRelationTable.
The relationship between the Energy Objects is specified with the entPhysicalIndex of the Energy Object and the UUID of the remote Energy Object.
The UUID MUST comply to the RFC 4122 specifications.
It is important to note that it is possible that an Energy Object may not have an Energy Object relationship with other Energy Objects.
The following relationships between Energy Objects have been considered in the eoRelationTable.
/ powering Aggregation Relationship    aggregatedBy /
aggregating Energy Object B has a "meteredBy" relationship with Energy Object A, if the energy consumption of Energy Object B is measured by Energy Object A.  Equivalently, it is possible to indicate that Energy Object A has a "metering" relationship with Energy Object B. Energy Object B has a "poweredBy" relationship with Energy Object A, if the power source of Energy Object B is
Energy Object A. Equivalently, it is possible to indicate that Energy Object A has a "powering" relationship with Energy Object B. Energy Object B has "aggregatedBy" relationship with Energy Object A, if Energy Object A is an aggregation point for energy usage of
Energy Object B.  Equivalently, it is possible to indicate that Energy Object A has "aggregating" relationship with Energy Object B.
The IANA ENERGY RELATION MIB module in Section 5 below specifies the first version of the IANA maintained definitions of relationships.
This way, for Energy Relationships, new textual conventions can be specified, without updating the primary Energy Object Context MIB module.
In some situations, the Energy Object identity information should be persistent even after a device reload.
For example, in a static setup where a switch monitors a series of connected PoE phones, there is a clear benefit for the EnMS if the Energy Object Identification and all associated information persist, as it saves a network discovery.
However, in other situations, such as a wireless access point monitoring the mobile user PCs, there is not much advantage to persist the Energy Object Information.
The identity information of an Energy Object should be persisted and there is value in the writable MIB objects persisted.
This MIB is used for describing the identity and the   context information of Energy Objects in network

If write access is implemented and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the eoKeywords instance associated with the same physical entity for as long as that entity remains instantiated.
This includes instantiations across all re initializations/reboots of the local management agent."
"This object specifies a ranking of how important the Energy Object is (on a scale of 1 to 100) compared with other Energy Objects in the same Energy Management Domain.
The ranking should provide a business or operational context for the Energy Object as compared to other similar Energy Objects.
This ranking could be used as input for policy based network management.
Although network managers must establish their own ranking, the following is a broad recommendation: 90 to 100 Emergency response 80 to 89  Executive or business critical 70 to 79  General or average 60 to 69  Staff or support 40 to 59  Public or guest 1 to 39  Decorative or hospitality

An enumerated value specifying the type of relationship between an Energy Object A, on which the relationship is specified, with the Energy Object B, identified by the UUID.
The enumeration 'poweredBy' is applicable if Energy Object A is poweredBy Energy Object B.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: Unauthorized changes to the eoDomainName, entPhysicalName, eoRoleDescription, eoKeywords, eoImportance, eoAlternateKey, eoRelationID, eoRelationship, eoRelationStatus,
and/or eoRelationStorageType MAY disrupt power and energy collection, and therefore any predefined policies defined in the network.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
In certain situations, energy and power monitoring can reveal sensitive information about individuals' activities and habits.
Implementors of this specification should use appropriate privacy protections as discussed in Section 9 of RFC 6988 and monitoring of individuals and homes should only occur with proper authorization.
A Specification Required as defined in [RFC5226] is REQUIRED for each modification of the energy relationships.
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry.
