- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF has general policies for managing disruptive behavior\
    \ in the\n   context of IETF activities.  In particular, [RFC7154] provides a\
    \ set\n   of guidelines for personal interaction in the IETF, and [RFC2418] and\n\
    \   [RFC3934] give guidelines for how to deal with disruptive behavior\n   that\
    \ occurs in the context of IETF working group face-to-face\n   meetings and on\
    \ mailing lists.\n   However, there is other problematic behavior that may be\
    \ more\n   personal and that can occur in the context of IETF activities\n   (meetings,\
    \ mailing list discussions, or social events) that does not\n   directly disrupt\
    \ working group progress but nonetheless is\n   unacceptable behavior between\
    \ IETF Participants.  This sort of\n   behavior, described in the IESG Statement\
    \ \"IETF Anti-Harassment\n   Policy\" [Policy], is not easily dealt with by our\
    \ previously existing\n   working group guidelines and procedures.  Therefore,\
    \ this document\n   sets forth procedures to deal with such harassing behavior.\n\
    \   These procedures are intended to be used when other IETF policies and\n  \
    \ procedures do not apply or have been ineffective.\n   Nothing in this document\
    \ should be taken to interfere with the due\n   process of law.  Similarly, it\
    \ does not release any person from any\n   contractual or corporate policies to\
    \ which they may be subject.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   The following terms are used in this document:\n   o  IETF\
    \ Participant: Anyone who participates in an IETF activity,\n      including IETF\
    \ support staff.\n   o  Reporter: An IETF Participant who reports potential harassment\
    \ to\n      an Ombudsperson.\n   o  Respondent: An IETF Participant who is claimed\
    \ to have engaged in\n      harassing behavior.\n   o  Ombudsteam: A group of\
    \ people who have been selected to take\n      reports of potential harassment,\
    \ evaluate them, and impose\n      appropriate actions and/or remedies to address\
    \ the circumstances.\n   o  Ombudsperson: A member of the Ombudsteam.\n   o  Lead\
    \ Ombudsperson: The Ombudsperson assigned to be the primary\n      contact person\
    \ for a particular report of potential harassment.\n   o  Subject: An individual,\
    \ group, or class of IETF Participant to\n      whom the potentially harassing\
    \ behavior was directed or who might\n      be subject to the behavior.\n   The\
    \ IESG Statement on harassment [Policy] gives a general definition\n   of harassment\
    \ as:\n      unwelcome hostile or intimidating behavior -- in particular,\n  \
    \    speech or behavior that is sexually aggressive or intimidates\n      based\
    \ on attributes such as race, gender, religion, age, color,\n      national origin,\
    \ ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or\n      gender identity.\n   This\
    \ document adopts that general definition but does not attempt to\n   further\
    \ precisely define behavior that falls under the set of\n   procedures identified\
    \ here, nor does it attempt to list every\n   possible attribute that might be\
    \ the basis for harassment, except to\n   note that it may be targeted at an individual,\
    \ directed at a specific\n   group of people, or more generally impact a broader\
    \ class of people.\n   This document concerns itself with harassment that has\
    \ the purpose or\n   effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's participation\n\
    \   in IETF activities or of creating an environment within the IETF that\n  \
    \ would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive in such a situation.\n   One way\
    \ in which harassment can occur is when submission to such\n   conduct is made,\
    \ either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition\n   of an individual's\
    \ participation in IETF activities or is used as a\n   basis for decisions affecting\
    \ that individual's relationship to the\n   IETF.\n   In general, disruptive behavior\
    \ that occurs in the context of an IETF\n   general or working group mailing list,\
    \ or happens in a face-to-face\n   or virtual meeting of a working group or the\
    \ IETF plenary, can be\n   dealt with by our normal procedures, whereas harassing\
    \ behavior is\n   more appropriately handled by the procedures described here.\n\
    \   However, there are plausible reasons to address behaviors that take\n   place\
    \ during working group meetings using these procedures.  This\n   document gives\
    \ some guidance to those involved in these situations in\n   order to decide how\
    \ to handle particular incidents, but the final\n   decision will involve judgment\
    \ and the guidance of the Ombudsteam.\n   Any definition of harassment prohibited\
    \ by an applicable law can be\n   subject to this set of procedures.\n"
- title: 3.  The Ombudsteam
  contents:
  - "3.  The Ombudsteam\n   This section describes the role of the Ombudsteam in terms\
    \ of the\n   appointment of Ombudspersons, their qualifications and training,\
    \ the\n   length of the term of service, any compensation from the IETF for\n\
    \   their service, and how they may be removed from service.  The general\n  \
    \ operational procedures for the Ombudsteam are described in Sections\n   4, 5,\
    \ and 6.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Size of the Ombudsteam
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Size of the Ombudsteam\n   The Ombudsteam shall comprise no fewer than\
    \ three people.  From time\n   to time, the size may fall below that number owing\
    \ to changes in\n   membership, but the team will be rapidly brought up to size\
    \ through\n   new appointments.  The team may be grown to a larger size as\n \
    \  described in Section 3.2\n"
- title: 3.2.  Appointing the Ombudsteam
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Appointing the Ombudsteam\n   The Ombudsteam is appointed by the IETF Chair.\
    \  The appointment is\n   solely the responsibility of the IETF Chair, who may\
    \ choose to\n   consult with members of the IETF community.\n   The IETF Chair\
    \ is encouraged to appoint at least some of the\n   Ombudsteam from within the\
    \ IETF community.\n   The IETF Chair may choose to solicit nominations or advertise\
    \ the\n   post.  This is entirely at the discretion of the IETF Chair.\n   The\
    \ IETF Chair is also free to decide to appoint more than three\n   Ombudspersons\
    \ to the Ombudsteam.  This may depend on the skill sets\n   available, the work\
    \ load, and the opinions of the seated Ombudsteam.\n   Furthermore, the IETF Chair\
    \ may consider elements of diversity in\n   making this decision.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Professional Advisors
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Professional Advisors\n   It is recognized that the Ombudsteam may need\
    \ to call on professional\n   services from external advisors for certain matters,\
    \ including legal\n   and Human Resources (HR) advice.  The IETF (via the IETF\n\
    \   Administrative Support Activity (IASA)) is committed to funding such\n   advice\
    \ as needed.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Qualifications and Training
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Qualifications and Training\n   It is not expected that there will be candidates\
    \ with all of the\n   necessary Ombudsperson skills and training who also have\
    \ a clear\n   understanding and familiarity with the IETF processes and culture.\n\
    \   The Chair might choose someone with a great deal of professional\n   experience\
    \ evaluating and mediating harassment disputes but little\n   exposure to the\
    \ IETF or could select someone with more exposure to\n   the IETF community but\
    \ without as much experience dealing with issues\n   of harassment.  Since all\
    \ of these attributes may be regarded by the\n   IETF Chair as essential for the\
    \ team, the IETF is committed to\n   providing training (or funding for it) as\
    \ deemed necessary for\n   appointed Ombudspersons.  In determining the appropriate\
    \ training,\n   the IETF Chair and Ombudsteam shall take professional advice and\
    \ will\n   consult with the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with\n\
    \   respect to the overall IETF budget.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Term of Service
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Term of Service\n   An Ombudsperson shall be appointed for a two-year term.\
    \  That is, the\n   Ombudsperson is making a commitment to serve for two years.\
    \  It is\n   understood, however, that circumstances may lead an Ombudsperson\
    \ to\n   resign for personal or other reasons.  See also Section 3.7.\n   If an\
    \ Ombudsperson's term ends while they are acting as Lead\n   Ombudsperson for\
    \ a report as described in Section 4, that\n   Ombudsperson's term shall be extended\
    \ until the handling of that\n   report has been completed.\n   It is entirely\
    \ at the discretion of the IETF Chair whether a serving\n   Ombudsperson is reappointed\
    \ at the end of their term.  Given the\n   sensitivity of, and training required\
    \ for, this role and the ideal\n   being a lack of activity, it is likely the\
    \ IETF Chair may choose to\n   reappoint a successful and still-willing Ombudsperson\
    \ for a number of\n   two-year terms.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Compensation
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Compensation\n   An Ombudsperson shall receive no compensation from the\
    \ IETF for their\n   services.  This includes, but is not limited to:\n   o  IETF\
    \ meeting fees\n   o  Remuneration for time spent\n   o  Out-of-pocket expenses\
    \ (such as telephone charges)\n   o  Travel or accommodation expenses\n   The\
    \ IETF will, however, meet the costs of training when agreed to by\n   the IETF\
    \ Chair as described in Section 3.4.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Removal
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Removal\n   The IETF Chair may remove a serving Ombudsperson before the\
    \ end of\n   their term without explanation to the community, including during\
    \ the\n   course of processing an active case.  Such an action shall be\n   appealable\
    \ as described in Section 3.8.\n   An Ombudsperson shall not be removed from service,\
    \ even if their term\n   has expired, during the period that the IETF Chair is\
    \ recused as\n   described in Section 7.  Once the case that led to the Chair\
    \ being\n   recused has been closed, normal processes resume.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Disputes with the IETF Chair Regarding the Ombudsteam
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Disputes with the IETF Chair Regarding the Ombudsteam\n   If an individual\
    \ should disagree with an action taken by the IETF\n   Chair regarding the appointment,\
    \ removal, or management of an\n   Ombudsperson or the Ombudsteam, that person\
    \ should first discuss the\n   issue with the IETF Chair directly.  If the IETF\
    \ Chair is unable to\n   resolve the issue, the dissatisfied party may appeal\
    \ to the IESG as a\n   whole.  The IESG shall then review the situation and attempt\
    \ to\n   resolve it in a manner of its own choosing.  The procedures of\n   Section\
    \ 6.5.4 of [RFC2026] apply to this sort of appeal.\n"
- title: 4.  Handling Reports of Harassment
  contents:
  - "4.  Handling Reports of Harassment\n   Any IETF Participant who believes that\
    \ they have been harassed, or\n   that any other IETF Participant or group of\
    \ IETF Participants has\n   been or may have been harassed, should bring the concern\
    \ to the\n   attention of any serving Ombudsperson.  This can be done by email\
    \ to\n   ombuds@ietf.org or can be done directly to a chosen Ombudsperson.\n \
    \  Direct contact information for the members of the Ombudsteam,\n   including\
    \ the email addresses to which mail to ombuds@ietf.org is\n   forwarded, can be\
    \ found at <https://www.ietf.org/ombudsteam>\n   [OmbudsteamPages].\n   All IETF\
    \ Participants are encouraged to talk with the Ombudsteam if\n   they are uncomfortable\
    \ or unsure about any behaviors.  Though much of\n   this document relates to\
    \ the formal duties of the Ombudsteam, it\n   should be understood that an important\
    \ function of the Ombudsteam is\n   to provide confidential advice and counsel\
    \ for any IETF Participant\n   regarding issues of harassment.  The Ombudsteam\
    \ will not commence a\n   formal investigation of any potential incident of harassment\
    \ without\n   agreement by the Reporter and Subject.\n   When a Reporter brings\
    \ an incident of potential harassment to the\n   attention of the Ombudsteam,\
    \ a single Ombudsperson shall be\n   designated as the primary contact person\
    \ (the Lead Ombudsperson) for\n   the report.  When the Reporter contacts a single\
    \ Ombudsperson, that\n   Ombudsperson shall be the Lead Ombudsperson for the report\
    \ unless the\n   Reporter and Ombudsperson mutually agree to select another Lead\n\
    \   Ombudsperson.\n   Information conveyed by the Reporter should be kept in confidence\
    \ by\n   the Lead Ombudsperson to the greatest extent possible.  When\n   necessary\
    \ (for example, in the course of a formal investigation), the\n   Lead Ombudsperson\
    \ may share information regarding the report with the\n   rest of the Ombudsteam\
    \ except when an Ombudsperson is recused (see\n   Section 7).  If a Reporter believes\
    \ that a member of the Ombudsteam\n   should recuse themself, the Reporter should\
    \ make this known to the\n   Lead Ombudsperson as soon as possible.  See Section\
    \ 4.1 for further\n   discussion of the confidentiality requirements of the Ombudsteam.\n\
    \   The Lead Ombudsperson will discuss the events with the Reporter and\n   may\
    \ give advice, including recommendations on how the Reporter can\n   handle the\
    \ issue on their own as well as strategies on how to prevent\n   the issue from\
    \ arising again.  The Lead Ombudsperson may also\n   indicate that the issue would\
    \ be best handled using regular IETF\n   procedures (such as those for dealing\
    \ with disruptive behavior)\n   outside the context of harassment, and in this\
    \ case, the Lead\n   Ombudsperson will provide assistance in using the relevant\
    \ IETF\n   procedures.  Otherwise, with agreement to proceed from the Subject\n\
    \   (or the Reporter if there is no individual Subject), the Ombudsteam\n   may\
    \ initiate a detailed investigation of the matter and may\n   subsequently, after\
    \ completing their investigation, impose a remedy\n   as described in Section\
    \ 5.  The Subject can withdraw their agreement\n   to proceed at any time.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Ombudsteam Operating Practices
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Ombudsteam Operating Practices\n   The Ombudsteam is responsible for devising\
    \ and documenting their\n   operating practices.  These practices must be discussed\
    \ with the IESG\n   and published in a publicly visible place (such as on the\
    \ IETF web\n   site).  Discussion with the IETF community is encouraged and, while\n\
    \   IETF consensus is not necessary, significant objections to the\n   processes\
    \ that are not addressed should result in an appeal per\n   Section 6.5.3 of [RFC2026]\
    \ and/or a recall petition against the IETF\n   Chair (and any of the rest of\
    \ the IESG if appropriate) if they do not\n   address the concern.\n   The practices\
    \ must include at least the following high-level\n   components:\n   o  Each member\
    \ of the Ombudsteam is expected to be present at the\n      majority of IETF meetings\
    \ and to be available for face-to-face\n      discussions.  The Ombudsteam is\
    \ expected to arrange itself so that\n      there is coverage of every IETF meeting\
    \ by at least one\n      Ombudsperson.\n   o  The Ombudsteam shall strive to keep\
    \ all information brought to it\n      in strict confidence.  However, it is acknowledged\
    \ that the\n      operation of the Ombudsteam may involve sharing of information\n\
    \      within the team and may require that the parties to the complaint\n   \
    \   (the Reporter, Respondent, and Subject) learn some of the\n      confidential\
    \ information.  The Ombudsteam is responsible for\n      documenting its expectations\
    \ of when disclosures of confidential\n      information are likely to be made\
    \ in the process and to whom.  Any\n      electronic information (such as email\
    \ messages) that needs to be\n      archived shall be encrypted before it is stored\
    \ using tools\n      similar to those used by the Nominating Committee (NomCom).\n\
    \   o  When conducting a detailed investigation of the circumstances\n      regarding\
    \ the complaint of harassment, the Ombudsteam may contact\n      the Respondent\
    \ and request a meeting in person or by a voice call.\n      The Ombudsteam shall\
    \ have contacted the Respondent and either\n      discussed the matter or ascertained\
    \ the Respondent's unwillingness\n      to cooperate prior to deciding to impose\
    \ a remedy as described in\n      Section 5.  The Respondent is not obliged to\
    \ cooperate, but the\n      Ombudsteam may consider failure to cooperate when\
    \ determining a\n      remedy (Section 5).\n   o  The Ombudsteam shall endeavor\
    \ to complete its investigation in a\n      timely manner.\n   o  Any individuals\
    \ who make a good faith report of harassment or who\n      cooperate with an investigation\
    \ shall not be subject to\n      retaliation for reporting, complaining, or cooperating,\
    \ even if\n      the investigation, once completed, shows no harassment occurred.\n\
    \      Anti-retaliation is noted here to alleviate concerns individuals\n    \
    \  may have with reporting an incident they feel should be reviewed\n      or\
    \ cooperating with an investigation.\n   o  In all cases, the Ombudsteam will\
    \ strive to maintain\n      confidentiality for all parties, including the very\
    \ fact of\n      contact with the Ombudsteam.\n   o  The results of investigations\
    \ as reported to the Subject or\n      Respondent and all requests for remedial\
    \ action (such as to the\n      IETF Secretariat) shall be in writing.\n   o \
    \ The Ombudsteam shall keep written records of their investigation\n      and\
    \ any contacts or interviews such that there is material\n      available in the\
    \ event of an appeal or legal action.  Such records\n      shall be held securely\
    \ and in confidence.\n   When investigating reports of harassment and determining\
    \ remedies, it\n   is up to the Ombudsteam whether they choose to act as a body\
    \ or\n   delegate duties to the Lead Ombudsperson.\n"
- title: 5.  Remedies
  contents:
  - "5.  Remedies\n   After examining the circumstances regarding the complaint of\n\
    \   harassment, the Ombudsteam should prepare a brief summary of the\n   incident\
    \ and their conclusions and discuss this with all parties.\n   The objective of\
    \ this step is to make clear what the Ombudsteam has\n   concluded and to make\
    \ an attempt at getting all parties to reach\n   agreement.\n   If the Ombudsteam\
    \ determines that harassment has taken place, the\n   Ombudsteam is expected to\
    \ determine the next action.\n   o  In some cases, a mechanism or established\
    \ IETF process may already\n      exist for handling the specific event.  In these\
    \ cases, the\n      Ombudsteam may decide that the misbehavior is best handled\

    \      and may assist the Reporter to bring the issue to the attention of\n  \
    \    the WG Chair or IESG member who can deal with the incident.\n   o  In other\
    \ cases, there is a spectrum of remedies that may be\n      appropriate to the\
    \ circumstances.  At one end of the spectrum, the\n      Ombudsteam might choose\
    \ to discuss the situation with the\n      Respondent and come up with a plan\
    \ such that there is no repeat of\n      the harassment.  With the agreement of\
    \ both parties, the\n      Ombudsteam can also help to mediate a conversation\
    \ between the\n      Respondent and the Subject (or the Reporter if there is no\n\
    \      individual Subject) in order to address the issue.  If mediation\n    \
    \  fails, then the Ombudsteam can decide to apply other remedies,\n      including\
    \ those discussed here.\n   o  At the other end of the spectrum, the Ombudsteam\
    \ could decide that\n      the Respondent is no longer permitted to participate\
    \ in a\n      particular IETF activity, for example, ejecting them from a\n  \
    \    meeting or requiring that the Respondent can no longer attend\n      future\
    \ meetings to ensure that the reported harassment cannot\n      continue or escalate.\
    \  If the Respondent holds a management\n      position in the IETF, the remedies\
    \ imposed may make it difficult\n      or impossible for them to perform the duties\
    \ required of that\n      position.  Further remedies may be applied to Respondents\
    \ in IETF\n      management positions as described in Section 5.1.\n   o  In determining\
    \ the appropriate remedy, the Ombudsteam may\n      communicate with the Reporter,\
    \ Subject, or Respondent in order to\n      assess the impact that the imposition\
    \ of a remedy might have on\n      any of those parties.  However, the Ombudsteam\
    \ has ultimate\n      responsibility for the choice of remedy.\n   o  In all cases,\
    \ the Lead Ombudsperson informs the Respondent of the\n      decision and imposes\
    \ the remedy as appropriate.  In cases where\n      the remedy is removal from\
    \ IETF activities, the Lead Ombudsperson\n      will confidentially notify the\
    \ Secretariat in writing of the\n      remedy such that the Secretariat can take\
    \ whatever logistical\n      actions are required to effect the remedy.  Only\
    \ the remedy itself\n      shall be disclosed to the Secretariat, not any information\n\
    \      regarding the nature of the harassment.\n   Where specific action is required\
    \ to ensure that a remedy is realized\n   or enforced, the Ombudsteam will make\
    \ a request in writing to the\n   IETF Secretariat and/or IETF Administrative\
    \ Director (IAD) to take\n   action as appropriate.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Remedies for Respondents in IETF Positions
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Remedies for Respondents in IETF Positions\n   The remedies discussed earlier\
    \ in this section are equally applicable\n   to all IETF Participants regardless\
    \ of role.\n   The Ombudsteam will want to be aware of the impact of remedies\
    \ on the\n   ability of an individual to carry out their duties in IETF management\n\
    \   positions, but this should not dissuade the Ombudsteam from applying\n   remedies\
    \ that they deem appropriate.  Per Section 5, the Ombudsteam\n   is expected to\
    \ apply proportionality and reasonableness, as well as\n   to consider the impact\
    \ of the remedy on the Respondent.  Per\n   Section 4.1, the Ombudsteam may communicate\
    \ with the Respondent in\n   order to assess the impact that the remedy might\
    \ have.\n   There may be cases where the Ombudsteam considers that it is\n   inappropriate\
    \ for a Respondent to continue in their IETF management\n   position, that is,\
    \ where the desired remedy is to remove the\n   Respondent from their management\
    \ position.  The Ombudsteam cannot by\n   itself remove a Respondent who is in\
    \ an IETF management position from\n   that position.  However, the Ombudsteam\
    \ can recommend the use of\n   existing mechanisms within the IETF process for\
    \ the removal of people\n   from IETF management positions as follows:\n   o \
    \ Many IETF management positions are appointed by the NomCom with\n      confirmation\
    \ from the IESG, IAB, or ISOC.  [RFC7437] describes the\n      recall procedure\
    \ for such appointments.  This document updates\n      [RFC7437] by allowing the\
    \ Ombudsteam to form a recall petition on\n      its own and without requiring\
    \ 20 signatories from the community.\n      Such a petition shall be treated in\
    \ all ways like any other recall\n      petition as described in [RFC7437]: that\
    \ is, the fact of the\n      petition and its signatories (the Ombudsteam) shall\
    \ be announced\n      to the IETF community, and a Recall Committee Chair shall\
    \ be\n      appointed to complete the Recall Committee process.  It is\n     \
    \ expected that the Recall Committee will receive a briefing from\n      the Ombudsteam\
    \ explaining why recall is considered an appropriate\n      remedy.\n   o  Other\
    \ IETF management positions are filled by appointment of the\n      IESG, the\
    \ IAB, the ISOC Board, or the ISOC President.  In such\n      cases, the Ombudsteam\
    \ may recommend to the appointing body that\n      the Respondent be removed from\
    \ their position.\n   o  Many IETF management positions are filled through appointment\
    \ by\n      an AD or by the ADs for an IETF Area.  In such cases, the\n      Ombudsteam\
    \ may recommend to those ADs in writing that the\n      Respondent be removed\
    \ from their position.\n   o  Some other IETF management positions are filled\
    \ through\n      appointment by WG Chairs.  In such cases, the Ombudsteam may\
    \ make\n      a recommendation in writing to the responsible AD (that is, not\n\
    \      directly to the WG Chairs) that the Respondent be removed from\n      their\
    \ position.\n   In each of the cases listed here, it is expected that the person\
    \ or\n   body responsible for removing someone from an IETF management\n   position\
    \ will take a recommendation from the Ombudsteam extremely\n   seriously and that\
    \ it would be very unusual for them to not act on\n   the recommendation.  It\
    \ is not the intent that the person or body\n   attempt to reinvestigate the circumstances\
    \ of the harassment.  They\n   are expected to understand that they are not qualified\
    \ in evaluating\n   or handling issues of harassment.  They must seek to preserve\n\
    \   confidentiality.  If the person or body feels removal from position\n   is\
    \ not the correct remedy, they must discuss their concern with the\n   Ombudsteam.\n\
    \   In the event that an AD declines to follow the recommendation of the\n   Ombudsteam,\
    \ and if the AD fails to convince the Ombudsteam of the\n   reasons for this,\
    \ the Ombudsteam should raise the issue with the\n   whole IESG while continuing\
    \ to attempt to retain confidentiality.\n   The IESG may choose to reorganize\
    \ the responsibilities for working\n   groups within its own structure so that\
    \ the AD concerned is no longer\n   in the direct management path.\n   All such\
    \ forced removals from management positions must be considered\n   by the Ombudsteam\
    \ as acts of last resort.  That is, before a\n   Respondent is recommended for\
    \ removal, the Ombudsteam should consider\n   other possible remedies and should\
    \ discuss the situation with the\n   Respondent, giving them ample opportunity\
    \ to understand what might\n   happen and to step down of their own volition.\n\
    \   As described in Section 4.1, the Ombudsteam is required to maintain\n   the\
    \ highest degree of confidentiality.  In recommending action as\n   described\
    \ above, the Ombudsteam will clearly have to indicate that\n   some event has\
    \ occurred that led to their recommendation, but it is\n   not expected that the\
    \ Ombudsteam will need to divulge substantially\n   more information.  It should\
    \ be enough that the Ombudsteam explains\n   the severity of the situation, that\
    \ they have considered other lesser\n   remedies, and that they deem the recommended\
    \ remedy to be\n   appropriate.\n   In removing someone from their position, it\
    \ may become apparent to\n   the IETF community that the removal is a remedy recommended\
    \ by the\n   Ombudsteam.  However, revealing the underlying events should be\n\
    \   avoided as far as possible.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Purpose of Remedies
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Purpose of Remedies\n   The purpose of the anti-harassment policy is to\
    \ prevent all incidents\n   of harassment in the IETF.  The set of procedures\
    \ documented here\n   serves to provide a mechanism whereby any harassment that\
    \ occurs can\n   be reported and handled both sympathetically and effectively.\
    \  The\n   policy also sends a clear message that the IETF does not tolerate\n\
    \   harassment in any form.\n   However, any remedy is imposed to try to make\
    \ sure that the incident\n   does not escalate and to ensure that a similar situation\
    \ is unlikely\n   to occur with the same Respondent in the future.\n   Because\
    \ the handling of incidents of harassment (including the\n   imposition of remedies)\
    \ is confidential, an imposed remedy cannot\n   itself serve as a deterrent to\
    \ others, nor can it be used to \"teach\"\n   the community how to behave.  ([RFC7154]\
    \ gives guidelines for conduct\n   in the IETF.)  Furthermore, a remedy is not\
    \ to be imposed for the\n   purposes of retribution.  However, the knowledge of\
    \ the existence of\n   a range of remedies and of processes by which they can\
    \ be applied\n   serves both as a statement of the IETF's seriousness in this\
    \ matter\n   and as a deterrent to potential offenders.\n   The Ombudsteam is\
    \ expected to apply the above considerations, as well\n   as proportionality and\
    \ reasonableness, in selecting a remedy.  They\n   are asked to consider the impact\
    \ of the remedy on the Respondent as\n   well as on the Subject.\n"
- title: 6.  Disputes with the Ombudsteam
  contents:
  - "6.  Disputes with the Ombudsteam\n   If either the Subject (or the Reporter if\
    \ there is no individual\n   Subject) or the Respondent is dissatisfied with the\
    \ decision of the\n   Ombudsteam, the dissatisfied party should first contact\
    \ the Lead\n   Ombudsperson and discuss the situation.  If the issue cannot be\n\
    \   resolved through discussion with the Lead Ombudsperson, the issue may\n  \
    \ be raised with the IETF Chair.\n   If necessary, the IETF Chair may recuse themself\
    \ from any part of\n   this process (see Section 7) and request the IESG to select\
    \ another\n   of its members to serve in this role.  This IESG member is known\
    \ as\n   the \"delegated IESG member\".\n   The IETF Chair (or the delegated IESG\
    \ member if the Chair is recused)\n   will attempt to resolve the issue in discussion\
    \ with the dissatisfied\n   party and the Lead Ombudsperson.  If this further\
    \ discussion does not\n   bring a satisfactory resolution, the Ombudsteam's decision\
    \ may be\n   formally appealed.  The appeal is strictly on the issue of whether\n\
    \   the Ombudsteam exercised due diligence both in their decision as to\n   whether\
    \ harassment had taken place as well as in their determination\n   of any appropriate\
    \ remedy that was imposed.  In particular, the\n   purpose of the appeal is not\
    \ to re-investigate the circumstances of\n   the incident or to negotiate the\
    \ severity of the remedy.\n   All elements of the appeal, including the fact of\
    \ the appeal, will be\n   held in confidence but will be recorded and held securely\
    \ for future\n   reference.\n   The appeal will be evaluated by the IETF Chair\
    \ (or the delegated IESG\n   member) and two other members of the IESG selected\
    \ by the IETF Chair\n   (or the delegated IESG member) and confirmed by the appellant.\
    \  This\n   Appeals Group shall convene as quickly as possible to evaluate and\n\
    \   determine the appeal.  Where the impacts are immediate and related to\n  \
    \ participation in an ongoing meeting, this shall happen in no more\n   than 24\
    \ hours after receiving the appeal.  The Appeals Group may ask\n   the appellant\
    \ and the Lead Ombudsperson for statements or other\n   information to consider.\
    \  If the Appeals Group concludes that due\n   diligence was exercised by the\
    \ Ombudsteam, this shall be reported to\n   the appellant, and the matter is concluded.\
    \  If the Appeals Group\n   finds that due diligence was not exercised, the Appeals\
    \ Group shall\n   report this to the Ombudsteam and consult with the Ombudsteam\
    \ on how\n   to complete the due diligence.\n   Because of the need to keep the\
    \ information regarding these matters\n   as confidential as possible, the Appeals\
    \ Group's decision is final\n   with respect to the question of whether the Ombudsteam\
    \ has used due\n   diligence in their decision.  The only further recourse available\
    \ is\n   to claim that the procedures themselves (i.e., the procedures\n   described\
    \ in this document) are inadequate or insufficient to the\n   protection of the\
    \ rights of all parties.  Such a claim may be made in\n   an appeal to the Internet\
    \ Society Board of Trustees, as described in\n   Section 6.5.3 of [RFC2026]. \
    \ Again, even in this circumstance, the\n   particulars of the incident at hand\
    \ will be held in confidence.\n"
- title: 7.  Conflicts of Interest
  contents:
  - "7.  Conflicts of Interest\n   In the event of any conflict of interest, the conflicted\
    \ person\n   (member of the Ombudsteam, member of the Appeals Group, IETF Chair,\n\
    \   etc.) is expected to recuse themselves.\n   A conflict of interest may arise\
    \ if someone involved in the process\n   of handling a harassment report is in\
    \ the role of Reporter,\n   Respondent, or Subject.  Furthermore, a conflict of\
    \ interest arises\n   if the person involved in the process of handling a harassment\
    \ report\n   is closely associated personally or through affiliation with any\
    \ of\n   the Reporter, Respondent, or Subject.\n   For the avoidance of doubt,\
    \ recusal in this context means completely\n   stepping out of any advisory or\
    \ decision-making part of any process\n   associated with handling a harassment\
    \ report, remedy arising from a\n   harassment report, or appeal into the handling\
    \ of a harassment\n   report.  That means that a recused person has no more right\
    \ to\n   participate in or witness the process than any other person from the\n\
    \   community in the same situation.  For example, an Ombudsperson\n   subject\
    \ to a complaint of harassment shall not be privy to the\n   deliberations of\
    \ another Ombudsperson handling the report.  Nor would\n   an IESG member who\
    \ was party to an appeal be able to witness the\n   discussions of the Appeals\
    \ Group.\n   In the event that there is an appeal and the IETF Chair is somehow\n\
    \   involved, the Chair will immediately recuse themself, and the IESG\n   will\
    \ select a single person to take the Chair's role in the appeal\n   process as\
    \ described in Section 6.\n"
- title: 8.  Confidentiality

  - "8.  Confidentiality\n   Throughout this document, there are mentions of requirements\
    \ to keep\n   information confidential.  This section summarizes those requirements\n\
    \   for clarity.\n   The Ombudsteam is expected to strive for confidentiality.\n\
    \   Confidentiality protects the Reporter, Subject, and Respondent in any\n  \
    \ case of alleged harassment.  It also protects witnesses or others\n   consulted\
    \ by the Ombudsteam during their investigation.\n   The Ombudsteam will keep its\
    \ email and other archival records in a\n   secure system and will not discuss\
    \ details of any case beyond what is\n   necessary for executing a thorough investigation.\n\
    \   Third-party receivers of output from the Ombudsteam (for example, ADs\n  \
    \ or the IETF Secretariat who are asked to take action) are required to\n   keep\
    \ such output confidential.\n   Participants in an investigation (Reporters, Subjects,\
    \ Respondents,\n   and anyone interviewed by the Ombudsteam during an investigation)\
    \ are\n   requested to keep the details of the events and investigation\n   confidential.\n\
    \   It is likely that members of the community will want to know more\n   when\
    \ they have become aware of some details of a case of harassment.\n   The community\
    \ is asked to show restraint and to trust the Ombudsteam.\n   This process is\
    \ designed to provide remedies not punishment, as\n   described in Section 5.2,\
    \ and public discussion of the events or\n   remedies does not form part of this\
