  - "2.  BCP 47 Required Information\n   Language tags, as defined by [BCP47], are\
    \ useful for identifying the\n   language of content.  They are also used as locale\
    \ identifiers (or\n   can be mapped to locales) in many operating environments\
    \ and APIs.\n   However, many locale identifiers also require additional \"tailorings\"\
    \n   or options for specific values within a language, culture, region, or\n \
    \  other variation.  This extension provides a mechanism for using these\n   additional\
    \ tailorings within language tags for general interchange.\n   The Unicode Consortium\
    \ defines a standardized, structured set of\n   locale data and identifiers for\
    \ locale data in the \"Common Locale\n   Data Repository\" or \"CLDR\".  The maintaining\
    \ authority for the\n   extension defined by this document is the Unicode Consortium:\n\

    \   The specification of extension subtags is provided by Section 3, Key\n   Type\
    \ Definitions of Unicode Technical Standard #35: Unicode Locale\n   Data Markup\
    \ Language [UTS35].  As required by BCP 47, subtags follow\n   the language tag\
    \ ABNF and other rules for the formation of language\n   tags and subtags, are\
    \ restricted to the ASCII letters and digits, are\n   not case sensitive, and\
    \ do not exceed eight characters in length.\n   Note that any \"well-formed\"\
    \ language tag (see RFC 5646, Section 2.2.9\n   [BCP47]) is also a well-formed\
    \ locale identifier.\n   LDML [UTS35] specifies a canonical representation.  LDML\
    \ is available\n   over the Internet and at no cost, and is available via a royalty-free\n\
    \   license at http://unicode.org/copyright.html.  LDML is versioned, and\n  \
    \ each version of LDML is numbered, dated, and stable.  Extension\n   subtags,\
    \ once defined by LDML, are never retracted and never change\n   in meaning in\
    \ a substantial way.\n   The structure of the Unicode locale extension is determined\
    \ by the\n   Unicode CLDR Technical Committee, in accordance with the policies\
    \ and\n   procedures in http://www.unicode.org/consortium/tc-procedures.html,\n\
    \   and subject to the Unicode Consortium Policies on\n   http://www.unicode.org/policies/policies.html.\n\
    \   Changes that can be made by successive versions of LDML [UTS35] by\n   the\
    \ Unicode Consortium without requiring a new RFC include: the\n   allocation of\
    \ new attributes, keywords, and types; clarifications or\n   non-material changes\
    \ to an existing attribute, keyword, or type; and\n   compatible extensions to\
    \ the overall syntactic structure of\n   attributes, keywords, and types.  A new\
    \ RFC would be required for\n   material changes to an existing attribute, keyword,\
    \ or type, or an\n   incompatible change to the overall syntactic structure of\
    \ attributes,\n   keywords, and types; however, such a change would be contrary\
    \ to the\n   policies of the Unicode Consortium, and thus is not anticipated.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Summary
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Summary\n   The subtags available for use in the 'u' extension consist\
    \ of a set\n   of attributes, keys, and types.  Attributes, keys, types, and their\n\
    \   respective meanings are defined in Section 3 (Unicode Language and\n   Locale\
    \ Identifiers) of [UTS35].  The following is a summary of that\n   definition:\n\
    \   o  An 'attribute' is a subtag with a length of three to eight\n      characters\
    \ following the singleton and preceding any 'keyword'\n      sequences.  No attributes\
    \ were defined at the time of this\n      document's publication.\n   o  A 'keyword'\
    \ is a sequence of subtags consisting of a 'key' subtag,\n      followed by zero\
    \ or more 'type' subtags (so a 'key' might appear\n      alone and not be accompanied\
    \ by a 'type' subtag).  A 'key' MUST\n      NOT appear more than once in a language\
    \ tag's extension string.\n      The order of the 'type' subtags within a 'keyword'\
    \ is sometimes\n      significant to their interpretation.\n      A.  A 'key'\
    \ is a subtag with a length of exactly two characters.\n          Each 'key' is\
    \ followed by zero or more 'type' subtags.\n      B.  A 'type' is a subtag with\
    \ a length of three to eight\n          characters following a 'key'.  'Type'\
    \ subtags are specific to\n          a particular 'key' and the order of the 'type'\
    \ subtags MAY be\n          significant to the interpretation of the 'keyword'.\n\
    \   For example, the language tag \"de-DE-u-attr-co-phonebk\" consists of:\n \
    \  o  The base language tag \"de-DE\" (German as used in Germany), exactly\n \
    \     as defined by [BCP47] using subtags from the IANA Language Subtag\n    \
    \  Registry.\n   o  The singleton 'u', identifying this extension.\n   o  The\
    \ attribute 'attr', which is an example for illustration (no\n      attributes\
    \ were defined at the time this document was published).\n   o  The keyword 'co-phonebk',\
    \ consisting to the key 'co' (Collation)\n      and the type 'phonebk' (Phonebook\
    \ collation order).\n   Only the first occurrence of an attribute or key conveys\
    \ meaning in a\n   language tag.  When interpreting tags containing the Unicode\
    \ locale\n   extension, duplicate attributes or keywords are ignored in the\n\
    \   following way: ignore any attribute that has already appeared in the\n   tag\
    \ and ignore any keyword whose key has already occurred in the tag.\n   Successive\
    \ versions of [UTS35] could define additional attributes,\n   keys, and types.\
    \  Once defined, attributes, keys, and types will\n   never be removed.\n   Beginning\
    \ with CLDR version 1.7.2, machine-readable files are\n   available listing the\
    \ valid attributes, keys, and types for each\n   successive version of [UTS35].\
    \  These releases are listed on\n   http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads. \
    \ Each release has an\n   associated data directory of the form\n   \"http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/<version>\"\
    , where \"<version>\" is\n   replaced by the release number.  For example, for\
    \ version 1.7.2, the\n   \"core.zip\" file is located at\n   http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/1.7.2/core.zip.\
    \  Inside the \"core.zip\"\n   file, the path \"common/bcp47\" contains the data\
    \ files defining the\n   valid attributes, keys, and types.  The most recent version\
    \ is always\n   identified by the version \"latest\" and can be accessed by the\
    \ URL in\n   Section 2.2.\n   To get the version information in XML when working\
    \ with the data\n   files, the XML parser must be validating.  When the 'core.zip'\
    \ file\n   is unzipped, the 'dtd' directory will be at the same level as the\n\
    \   'bcp47' directory; this is required for correct validation.  For each\n  \
    \ release after CLDR 1.8, types introduced in that release are also\n   marked\
    \ in the data files by the XML attribute \"since\", such as in the\n   following\
    \ example:\n   <type name=\"adp\" since=\"1.9\"/>\n   The data is also currently\
    \ maintained in a source code repository,\n   with each release tagged, for viewing\
    \ directly without unzipping.\n   For example, see:\n   o  http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/tags/release-1-7-2/common/bcp47/\n\
    \   o  http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/tags/release-1-8/common/bcp47/\n   Some data\
    \ in the CLDR data files might require reference to LDML\n   [UTS35].  For specific\
    \ information, see Appendix Q in that document.\n   For example, LDML reserves\
    \ the type 'codepoints' to define specific\n   code point ranges in Unicode for\
    \ specific purposes.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Canonicalization
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Canonicalization\n   As required by [BCP47], the use of uppercase or\
    \ lowercase letters is\n   not significant in the subtags used in this extension.\
    \  The canonical\n   form for all subtags in the extension is lowercase.  The\
    \ canonical\n   order of attributes is in [US-ASCII] order (that is, numbers before\n\
    \   letters, with letters sorted as lowercase US-ASCII code points).  The\n  \
    \ canonical order of keywords is in [US-ASCII] order by key.  The order\n   of\
    \ subtags within a keyword is significant; the meaning of this\n   extension is\
    \ altered if those subtags are rearranged.  Thus, the\n   canonical form of the\
    \ extension never reorders the subtags within a\n   keyword.\n"
