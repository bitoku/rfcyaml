  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In order to deploy a residential telephone service at a very large\n\
    \   scale across different domains, it is necessary for trusted elements\n   owned\
    \ by different service providers to exchange trusted information\n   that conveys\
    \ customer-specific information and expectations about the\n   parties involved\
    \ in the call.  This document describes private\n   extensions to the Session\

    \ access network coordination to prevent theft of service, customer\n   originated\
    \ trace of harassing calls, support for operator services\n   and emergency services,\
    \ and support for various other regulatory\n   issues.  The use of the extensions\
    \ is only applicable within closed\n   administrative domains, or among federations\
    \ of administrative\n   domains with previously agreed-upon policies where coordination\

- title: 1.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "1.  Applicability Statement\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]\
    \ extensions described\n   in this document make certain assumptions regarding\
    \ network topology,\n   linkage between SIP and lower layers, and the availability\
    \ of\n   transitive trust.  These assumptions are generally not applicable in\n\
    \   the Internet as a whole.  The use of these headers is only applicable\n  \
    \ within closed administrative domains, or among federations of\n   administrative\
    \ domains with previously agreed-upon policies where\n   coordination of charging\
    \ and other functions is required, as in, for\n   example, the architecture presented\
    \ in [DCSARCH].  Use outside such a\n   domain could result in the leakage of\
    \ potentially sensitive or\n   private information.  User consent to the privacy\
    \ implications of the\n   policies in [DCSARCH] is strongly encouraged in those\
    \ domains as\n   well.\n   Although [RFC2119] language is used in this document,\
    \ the scope of\n   the normative language is only for the area of applicability\
    \ of the\n   document and, like the technology, it does not apply to the general\n\
    \   Internet.\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   In order to deploy a SIP based residential telephone service\
    \ at very\n   large scale across different domains, it is necessary for trusted\n\
    \   elements owned by different service providers to exchange trusted\n   information\
    \ that conveys billing information and expectations about\n   the parties involved\
    \ in the call.\n   There are many billing models used in deriving revenue from\
    \ telephony\n   services today.  Charging for telephony services is tightly coupled\n\
    \   to the use of network resources.  It is outside the scope of this\n   document\
    \ to discuss the details of these numerous and varying\n   methods.\n   A key\
    \ motivating principle of the Distributed Call Signaling (DCS)\n   architecture\
    \ described in [DCSARCH] is the need for network service\n   providers to be able\
    \ to control and monitor network resources;\n   revenue may be derived from the\
    \ usage of these resources as well as\n   from the delivery of enhanced services\
    \ such as telephony.\n   Furthermore, the DCS architecture recognizes the need\
    \ for\n   coordination between call signaling and resource management.  This\n\
    \   coordination ensures that users are authenticated and authorized\n   before\
    \ receiving access to network resources and billable enhanced\n   services.\n\
    \   DCS Proxies, as defined in [DCSARCH], have access to subscriber\n   information\
    \ and act as policy decision points and trusted\n   intermediaries along the call\
    \ signaling path.  Edge routers provide\n   the network connectivity and resource\
    \ policy enforcement mechanism\n   and also capture and report network connectivity\
    \ and resource usage\n   information.  Edge routers need to be given billing information\
    \ that\n   can be logged with Record-Keeping or Billing servers.  The DCS Proxy,\n\
    \   as a central point of coordination between call signaling and\n   resource\
    \ management, can provide this information based on the\n   authenticated identity\
    \ of the calling and called parties.  Since\n   there is a trust relationship\
    \ among DCS Proxies, they can be relied\n   upon to exchange trusted billing information\
    \ pertaining to the\n   parties involved in a call.  See [DCSARCH] for a description\
    \ of the\n   trust boundary and trusted versus untrusted entities.\n   For these\
    \ reasons, it is appropriate to consider defining SIP header\n   extensions to\
    \ allow DCS Proxies to exchange information during call\n   setup.  The extensions\
    \ only appear on trusted network segments, are\n   inserted upon entering a trusted\
    \ network region, and are removed\n   before leaving trusted network segments.\n\
    \   Significant amounts of information are retrieved by an originating\n   DCS\
    \ Proxy in its handling of a connection setup request from a user\n   agent. \
    \ Such information includes location information about the\n   subscriber (essential\
    \ for emergency services calls), billing\n   information, and station information\
    \ (e.g., coin-operated phone).  In\n   addition, while translating the destination\
    \ number, information such\n   as the local-number-portability office code is\
    \ obtained and will be\n   needed by all other proxies handling this call.\n \
    \  For Usage Accounting records, it is necessary to have an identifier\n   that\
    \ can be associated with all the event records produced for the\n   call.  The\
    \ SIP Call-ID header field cannot be used as such an\n   identifier since it is\
    \ selected by the originating user agent, and it\n   may not be unique among all\
    \ past calls as well as current calls.\n   Further, since this identifier is to\
    \ be used by the service provider,\n   it should be chosen in a manner and in\
    \ a format that meets the\n   service provider's needs.\n   Billing information\
    \ may not necessarily be unique for each user\n   (consider the case of calls\
    \ from an office all billed to the same\n   account).  Billing information may\
    \ not necessarily be identical for\n   all calls made by a single user (consider\
    \ prepaid calls, credit card\n   calls, collect calls, etc).  It is therefore\
    \ necessary to carry\n   billing information separate from the calling and called\
    \ party\n   identification.  Furthermore, some billing models call for split-\n\
    \   charging where multiple entities are billed for portions of the call.\n  \
    \ The addition of a SIP General Header Field allows for the capture of\n   billing\
    \ information and billing identification for the duration of\n   the call.\n \
    \  The billing extensions only appear on trusted network segments and\n   MAY\
    \ be inserted by a DCS Proxy in INVITE and REFER requests and\n   INVITE responses\
    \ in a trusted network segment, and removed before\n   leaving trusted network\
    \ segments.\n   In addition to support for billing, current residential telephone\n\
    \   service includes the need for customer-originated trace (of harassing\n  \
    \ or obscene calls), for operator services such as busy line\n   verification\
    \ and emergency interrupt (initiated by an operator from\n   an Operator Services\
    \ Position System (OSPS)), for emergency services\n   such as 9-1-1 calls to a\
    \ Public Service Access Point (PSAP) and the\n   subsequent call handling, and\
    \ for support of Electronic Surveillance\n   and Law Enforcement access as required\
    \ by applicable legislation and\n   court orders.  In all of these cases, additional\
    \ information about\n   the call and about the subscribers involved in the call\
    \ needs to be\n   exchanged between the proxies.\n"
- title: 3.  Trust Boundary
  contents:
  - "3.  Trust Boundary\n   The DCS architecture [DCSARCH] defines a trust boundary\
    \ around the\n   various systems and servers that are owned, operated by, and/or\n\
    \   controlled by the service provider.  These trusted systems include\n   the\
    \ proxies and various servers such as bridge servers, voicemail\n   servers, announcement\
    \ servers, etc.  Outside of the trust boundary\n   lie the customer premises equipment\
    \ and various application and media\n   servers operated by third-party service\
    \ providers.\n   Certain subscriber-specific information, such as billing and\n\
    \   accounting information, stays within the trust boundary.  Other\n   subscriber-specific\
    \ information, such as endpoint identity, may be\n   presented to untrusted endpoints\
    \ or may be withheld based on\n   subscriber profiles.\n   The User Agent (UA)\
    \ may be either within the trust boundary or\n   outside the trust boundary, depending\
    \ on exactly what function is\n   being performed and exactly how it is being\
    \ performed.  Accordingly,\n   the procedures followed by a user agent are different\
    \ depending on\n   whether the UA is within the trust boundary or outside the\
    \ trust\n   boundary.\n   The following sections giving procedures for user agents\
    \ therefore\n   are subdivided into trusted user agents and untrusted user agents.\n\
    \   Since UAs may support client and server functions, the UA sections\n   include\
    \ procedures for the User Agent Client (UAC) and User Agent\n   Server (UAS).\n"

  - "5.  P-DCS-TRACE-PARTY-ID\n   In the telephone network, calling identity information\
    \ is used to\n   support regulatory requirements such as the Customer Originated\
    \ Trace\n   service, which provide the called party with the ability to report\n\
    \   obscene or harassing phone calls to law enforcement.  This service is\n  \
    \ provided independently of caller-id, and works even if the caller\n   requested\
    \ anonymity.  The calling party is here identified as the\n   station originating\
    \ the call.  In order for this service to be\n   dependable, the called party\
    \ must be able to trust that the calling\n   identity information being presented\
    \ is valid.  One way to achieve\n   this is described in [RFC3325].\n   To initiate\
    \ a customer-originated-trace from an untrusted User Agent\n   Client (UAC), an\
    \ additional header is defined for the INVITE request.\n   This header is called\
    \ P-DCS-Trace-Party-ID, and does not appear in\n   any other request or response.\
    \  The untrusted UAC also includes the\n   Target-Dialog header field, defined\
    \ in [RFC4538], in the INVITE\n   request in order to explicitly identify the\
    \ call to be traced.  The\n   entity addressed by the Request-URI performs the\
    \ service-provider-\n   specific functions of recording and reporting the caller\
    \ identity in\n   the P-DCS-Trace-Party-ID for law enforcement action.  It then\n\
    \   forwards the call to either an announcement server or to the service\n   provider's\

    \ may not be\n   satisfied by normal user agent call processing.  For example,\
    \ when a\n   user is engaged in a call and another call arrives, such a call might\n\
    \   be rejected with a busy indication.  However, some Public Switched\n   Telephone\

    \  interrupt, and \"RING\" for operator ringback (e.g., howling/sustained\n  \
    \ tone ring in the US).\n   If the user agent decides to honor such a request,\

  contents:
  - "7.  P-DCS-BILLING-INFO\n   There are many billing models used in deriving revenue\
    \ from telephony\n   services today.  Charging for telephony services is tightly\
    \ coupled\n   to the use of network resources.  It is outside the scope of this\n\
    \   document to discuss the details of these numerous and varying\n   methods.\n\
    \   Proxies have access to subscriber information and act as policy\n   decision\
    \ points and trusted intermediaries along the call signaling\n   path.  Edge routers\
    \ provide the network connection and resource\n   policy enforcement mechanism\
    \ and also capture and report network\n   connection and resource usage information.\
    \  Edge routers need to be\n   given billing information that can be logged with\
    \ Record-Keeping or\n   Billing servers.  The proxy, as a central point of coordination\n\
    \   between call signaling and resource management, can provide this\n   information\
    \ based on the authenticated identity of the calling and\n   called parties. \
    \ Since there is a trust relationship among proxies,\n   they can be relied upon\
    \ to exchange trusted billing information\n   pertaining to the parties involved\
    \ in a call.\n   For Usage Accounting records, it is necessary to have an identifier\n\
    \   that can be associated with all the event records produced for the\n   call.\
    \  The SIP Call-ID header field cannot be used as such an\n   identifier since\
    \ it is selected by the originating user agent, and\n   may not be unique among\
    \ all past calls as well as current calls.\n   Further, since this identifier\
    \ is to be used by the service provider,\n   it should be chosen in a manner and\
    \ in a format that meets the\n   service provider's needs.\n   Billing information\
    \ may not necessarily be unique for each user\n   (consider the case of calls\
    \ from an office all billed to the same\n   account).  Billing information may\
    \ not necessarily be identical for\n   all calls made by a single user (consider\
    \ prepaid calls, credit card\n   calls, collect calls, etc).  It is therefore\
    \ necessary to carry\n   billing information separate from the calling and called\
    \ party\n   identification.  Furthermore, some billing models call for\n   split-charging\
    \ where multiple entities are billed for portions of the\n   call.\n   The addition\
    \ of a SIP General Header Field allows for the capture of\n   billing information\
    \ and billing identification for the duration of\n   the call.\n   The billing\
    \ extensions only appear on trusted network segments, and\n   MAY be inserted\
    \ by a proxy or trusted UA in INVITE and SUBSCRIBE\n   requests in a trusted network\
    \ segment, and removed before leaving\n   trusted network segments.  The P-DCS-Billing-Info\
    \ header extension is\n   used only on requests and responses between proxies\
    \ and trusted UAs.\n   It is never sent to an untrusted UA.  It is expected that\
    \ untrusted\n   UAs do not send this header.\n"

  - "8.  P-DCS-LAES and P-DCS-Redirect\n   NOTE: According to RFC 2804 [RFC2804],\
    \ the IETF supports\n   documentation of lawful intercept technology if it is\
    \ necessary to\n   develop it.  The following section provides such documentation.\
    \  The\n   [RFC2119] language, as stated above, describes the requirements of\n\
    \   the specification only if implemented, and strictly within the\n   applicability\
    \ domain described above.  See RFC 2804 for description\n   of issues regarding\
    \ privacy, security, and complexity in relation to\n   this technology.\n   The\
    \ P-DCS-LAES extension contains the information needed to support\n   Lawfully\
    \ Authorized Electronic Surveillance.  This header contains\n   the address and\
    \ port of an Electronic Surveillance Delivery Function\n   for delivery of a duplicate\
    \ stream of event messages related to this\n   call.  The header fields MAY also\
    \ contain the associated BCID for the\n   event stream as well as additional address\
    \ and port for delivery of\n   call content and associated cccid.  The BCID is\
    \ used to correlate a\n   series of events associated with a single call or session.\
    \  The cccid\n   is used to identify an intercepted call content to an intercepted\n\
    \   call.  The P-DCS-LAES header is only used between proxies and trusted\n  \
    \ UAs.  The P-DCS-LAES header defined here is not backwards compatible\n   with\
    \ that defined in [RFC3603], which is deprecated by the document.\n   This version\
    \ of the P-DCS-LAES header adds a cccid parameter to\n   support the intercept\
    \ of content, and deletes security key\n   information.  This version does not\
    \ mandate the use of the BCID.\n   The P-DCS-Redirect extension contains call\
    \ identifying information\n   needed to support the requirements of Lawfully Authorized\
    \ Electronic\n   Surveillance of redirected calls.  This header is only used between\n\
    \   proxies and trusted UAs.\n   Note that there is overlap in function between\
    \ the P-DCS-Redirect\n   header and the History-Info header specified in RFC 4244.\
    \  The\n   original P-DCS-Redirect came to existence in RFC 3603 before the\n\
    \   History-Info.  Therefore, the P-DCS-Redirect header is continued here\n  \
    \ for backwards compatibility with existing implementations.\n   Use of P-DCS-LAES\
    \ and P-DCS-Redirect is controlled by a combination\n   of legislation, regulation,\
    \ and court orders, which MUST be followed.\n   In certain cases, inclusion of\
    \ these headers will be mandated, and\n   therefore MUST be present in the requests\
    \ and responses indicated.\n   In other cases, inclusion of these headers will\
    \ be forbidden, and\n   therefore MUST NOT be present in the request and responses\
    \ indicated.\n   In the sub-sections that follow, use of \"SHOULD\" is intended\
    \ to\n   capture these conflicting situations, e.g., a P-DCS-LAES header\n   SHOULD\
    \ be included in an initial INVITE means either that it MUST be\n   included or\

  - "8.6.2.  Procedures at Terminating Proxy\n   The terminating proxy MUST remove\
    \ any P-DCS-LAES and P-DCS-Redirect\n   headers in requests or responses to or\
    \ from an untrusted proxy or UA.\n   The terminating proxy checks for an outstanding\
    \ lawfully authorized\n   surveillance order for the terminating subscriber. \
    \ If present, the\n   terminating proxy MAY include this information in the authorization\n\
    \   for Quality of Service [PCDQOS].  Otherwise, intercept access points\n   are\
    \ instructed to perform call content and/or call data intercept by\n   mechanisms\
    \ that are outside the scope of this document.\n   The terminating proxy MUST\
    \ NOT send the P-DCS-LAES and P-DCS-Redirect\n   headers to an untrusted entity,\
    \ either as headers in the request or\n   response, or as headers attached to\
    \ URIs in the request or response.\n   If the terminating equipment is unable\
    \ to perform the required\n   surveillance (e.g., if the destination is a voicemail\
    \ server), the\n   terminating proxy SHOULD include a P-DCS-LAES header in the\
    \ first\n   reliable 1xx/2xx/3xx (except 100) response requesting the originating\n\
    \   proxy to perform the surveillance.  The P-DCS-LAES header MAY include\n  \
    \ the Laes-bcid parameter set to a value that uniquely identifies the\n   call,\
    \ SHOULD include the address and port of the local Electronic\n   Surveillance\
    \ Delivery Function for a copy of the call's event\n   messages, SHOULD include\
    \ the address and port of the local Electronic\n   Surveillance Delivery Function\
    \ for the copy of call content if call\n   content is to be intercepted, and MAY\
    \ include the Laes-cccid\n   parameter set to a value that uniquely identifies\
    \ the audio stream if\n   call content is to be intercepted.\n   If the response\
    \ to the initial INVITE request is a 3xx-Redirect\n   response, and there is an\
    \ outstanding lawfully authorized\n   surveillance order for the terminating subscriber,\
    \ the terminating\n   proxy SHOULD include a P-DCS-LAES header in the 3xx-Redirect\n\
    \   response, with contents as described above.\n   A proxy receiving a mid-call\
    \ REFER request [RFC3515] that includes a\n   Refer-To header with a P-DCS-LAES\
    \ header attached becomes a B2BUA for\n   this request.  It MUST generate a private-URL\
    \ and place it in the\n   Refer-To header sent to the endpoint.  This private-URL\
    \ MUST contain\n   the P-DCS-LAES and P-DCS-Redirect information from the attached\n\
    \   header fields.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   QoS gate coordination, billing information, and\
    \ electronic\n   surveillance information are all considered to be sensitive\n\
    \   information that MUST be protected from eavesdropping and furthermore\n  \
    \ require integrity checking.  It is therefore necessary that the\n   trusted\
    \ UAs and proxies take precautions to protect this information\n   from eavesdropping\
    \ and tampering.  Use of IPsec or TLS between\n   proxies and trusted UAs is REQUIRED.\
    \  A minimum mandatory-to-\n   implement IPsec configuration for the DCS architecture\
    \ is given by\n   [PCSEC].  Also REQUIRED is mutual authentication (1) between\
    \ Proxies\n   and (2) between trusted UAs and Proxies, both of which MAY be\n\
    \   implemented with administratively pre-shared keys, or through\n   consultation\
    \ with another trusted third party.  If IPsec is to be\n   used, the specification\
    \ of the security policies and procedures of\n   the administrative domain where\
    \ these headers are applicable (and all\n   connections between administrative\
