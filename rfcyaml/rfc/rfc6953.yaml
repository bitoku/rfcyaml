  - "1.1.  Introduction to White Space\n   Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is\
    \ regulated by governments.\n   The spectrum is used for various purposes, which\
    \ include, but are not\n   limited to, entertainment (e.g., radio and television),\
    \ communication\n   (e.g., telephony and Internet access), military (e.g., radars,\
    \ etc.),\n   and navigation (e.g., satellite communication, GPS).  Portions of\
    \ the\n   radio spectrum that are assigned to a licensed (primary) user but are\n\
    \   unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as\n   \"\
    white space\".  The concept of allowing additional (secondary)\n   transmissions\
    \ (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is a\n   technique to \"unlock\"\
    \ existing spectrum for new use.\n   An obvious requirement is that these secondary\
    \ transmissions do not\n   interfere with the assigned use of the spectrum.  One\
    \ interesting\n   observation is that often, in a given physical location, the\
    \ primary\n   user(s) may not be using the entire band assigned to them.  The\n\
    \   available spectrum for secondary transmissions would then depend on\n   the\
    \ location of the secondary user.  The fundamental issue is how to\n   determine,\
    \ for a specific location and specific time, if any of the\n   assigned spectrum\
    \ is available for secondary use.\n   Academia and industry have studied multiple\
    \ cognitive radio [CRADIO]\n   mechanisms for use in such a scenario.  One simple\
    \ mechanism is to\n   use a geospatial database that contains the spatial and\
    \ temporal\n   profile of all primary licensees' spectrum usage, and require\n\
    \   secondary users to query the database for available spectrum that\n   they\
    \ can use at their location.  Such databases can be accessible and\n   queryable\
    \ by secondary users on the Internet.\n   Any entity that is assigned spectrum\
    \ that is not densely used may be\n   asked by a governmental regulatory agency\
    \ to share it to allow for\n   more intensive use of the spectrum.  Providing\
    \ a mechanism by which\n   secondary users share the spectrum with the primary\
    \ user is\n   attractive in many bands, in many countries.\n   This document includes\
    \ the problem statement followed by use cases\n   and requirements associated\
    \ with the use of white-space spectrum by\n   secondary users via a database query\
    \ protocol.  The final sections\n   include the requirements associated with such\
    \ a protocol.  Note that\n   the IETF has undertaken to develop a database query\
    \ protocol (see\n   [PAWS]).\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.1.  In Scope\n   This document covers the requirements for a protocol to\
    \ allow a\n   device to access a database to obtain spectrum availability\n  \
    \ information.  Such a protocol should allow a device to perform the\n   following\
    \ actions:\n   1.  Determine the relevant database to query.\n   2.  Connect to\
    \ and optionally register with the database using a\n       well-defined protocol.\n\
    \   3.  Provide geolocation and perhaps other data to the database using\n   \
    \    a well-defined format for querying the database.\n   4.  Receive in response\
    \ to the query a list of available white-space\n       frequencies at the specified\
    \ geolocation using a well-defined\n       format for the information.\n   5.\
    \  Send an acknowledgment to the database with information\n       containing\
    \ channels selected for use by the device and other\n       device operation parameters.\n\
    \   Note: The above protocol actions should explicitly or implicitly\n   support\
    \ the ability of devices to re-register and/or re-query the\n   database when\
    \ they change their locations or operating parameters.\n   This will allow them\
    \ to receive permission to operate in their new\n   locations and/or with their\
    \ new operating parameters, and to send\n   acknowledgments to the database that\
    \ include information on their new\n   operating parameters.\n"
- title: 1.2.2.  Out of Scope
  contents:
  - "1.2.2.  Out of Scope\n   The following topics are out of scope for this specification:\n\
    \   1.  It is the device's responsibility to query the database for new\n    \
    \   spectrum when the device moves, changes operating parameters,\n       loses\
    \ connectivity, etc.  Other synchronization mechanisms are\n       out of scope.\n\
    \   2.  A rogue device may operate without contacting the database to\n      \
    \ obtain available spectrum.  Hence, enforcement of spectrum usage\n       by\
    \ devices is out of scope.\n   3.  The protocol defines communications between\
    \ the database and\n       devices.  The protocol for communications between devices\
    \ is out\n       of scope.\n   4.  Coexistence and interference avoidance of white-space\
    \ devices\n       within the same spectrum are out of scope.\n   5.  Provisioning\
    \ (releasing new spectrum for white-space use) is out\n       of scope.\n"

    \   devices.\n   A messaging interface between the white-space devices and the\n\
    \   database is required for operating a network using the white-space\n   spectrum.\
    \  The following sections discuss various aspects of such an\n   interface and\
    \ the need for a standard.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Global Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Global Applicability\n   The use of white-space spectrum is currently approved\
    \ or being\n   considered in multiple regulatory domains, whose rules may differ.\n\
    \   However, the need for devices that intend to use the spectrum to\n   communicate\
    \ with a database remains a common feature.  The database\n   implements rules\
    \ that protect all primary users, independent of the\n   characteristics of the\
    \ white-space devices.  It also provides a way\n   to specify a schedule of use,\
    \ since some primary users (for example,\n   wireless microphones) only operate\
    \ in limited time slots.\n   Devices need to be able to query a database, directly\
    \ or indirectly,\n   over the public Internet and/or private IP networks prior\
    \ to\n   operating in available spectrum.  Information about available\n   spectrum,\
    \ schedule, power, etc., are provided by the database as a\n   response to the\
    \ query from a device.  The messaging interface needs\n   to be:\n   1.  Interface\
    \ agnostic - An interface between a master white-space\n       device and database\
    \ can be wired or unwired (e.g., a radio/air\n       interface technology such\
    \ as IEEE 802.11af, IEEE 802.15.4m, IEEE\n       802.16, IEEE 802.22, LTE, etc.)\
    \  However, the messaging interface\n       between a master white-space device\
    \ and the database should be\n       agnostic to the interface used for such messaging\
    \ while being\n       cognizant of the characteristics of the interface technology\
    \ and\n       the need to include any relevant attributes in the query to the\n\
    \       database.\n   2.  Spectrum agnostic - The spectrum used by primary and\
    \ secondary\n       users varies by country.  Some spectrum bands have an explicit\n\
    \       notion of a \"channel\": a defined swath of spectrum within a band\n \
    \      that has some assigned identifier.  Other spectrum bands may be\n     \
    \  subject to white-space sharing, but only have actual frequency\n       low/high\
    \ parameters to define primary and secondary use.  The\n       protocol should\
    \ be able to be used in any spectrum band where\n       white-space sharing is\
    \ permitted.\n   3.  Globally applicable - A common messaging interface between\
    \ white-\n       space devices and databases will enable the use of such spectrum\n\
    \       for various purposes on a global basis.  Devices can operate in\n    \
    \   any location where such spectrum is available and a common\n       interface\
    \ ensures uniformity in implementations and deployment.\n       To allow the global\
    \ use of white-space devices in different\n       countries (whatever the regulatory\
    \ domain), the protocol should\n       support the database that communicates\
    \ the applicable regulatory\n       rule-set information to the white-space device.\n\
    \   4.  Built on flexible and extensible data structures - Different\n       databases\
    \ are likely to have different requirements for the kinds\n       of data required\
    \ for registration (different regulatory rule sets\n       that apply to the registration\
    \ of devices) and other messages\n       sent by the device to the database. \
    \ For instance, different\n       regulators might require different device-characteristic\n\
    \       information to be passed to the database.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Database Discovery
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Database Discovery\n   The master device must obtain the address of a trusted\
    \ database,\n   which it will query for available white-space spectrum.  If the\n\
    \   master device uses a discovery service to locate a trusted database,\n   it\
    \ may perform the following steps (this description is intended as\n   descriptive,\
    \ not prescriptive):\n   1.  The master device constructs and sends a request\
    \ (e.g., over the\n       Internet) to a trusted discovery service.\n   2.  If\
    \ no acceptable response is received within a pre-configured\n       time limit,\
    \ the master device concludes that no trusted database\n       is available. \
    \ If at least one response is received, the master\n       device evaluates the\
    \ response(s) to determine if a trusted\n       database can be identified where\
    \ the master device is able to\n       receive service from the database.  If\
    \ so, it establishes contact\n       with the trusted database.\n   3.  The master\
    \ device establishes a white-space network as described\n       in Section 4.\n\
    \   Optionally, and in place of steps 1-2 above, the master device can be\n  \
    \ pre-configured with the address (e.g., URI) of one or more trusted\n   databases.\
    \  The master device can establish contact with one of these\n   trusted databases.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Device Registration
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Device Registration\n   The master device may register with the database\
    \ before it queries\n   the database for available spectrum.  A registration process\
    \ may\n   consist of the following steps:\n   1.  The master device sends registration\
    \ information to the database.\n       This information may include the device\
    \ ID; serial number\n       assigned by the manufacturer; device location; device\
    \ antenna\n       height above ground; name of the individual or business that\

    \       phone number of a contact person responsible for the device's\n      \
    \ operation.\n   2.  The database responds to the registration request with an\n\
    \       acknowledgment to indicate the success of the registration\n       request\
    \ or with an error if the registration was unsuccessful.\n       Additional information\
    \ may be provided by the database in its\n       response to the master device.\n"

    \ or more slave devices\n   using its connection to the Internet to query the\
    \ database for\n   available spectrum for itself and for one or more slave devices.\n\
    \   These slave devices may be fixed or mobile, in close proximity with\n   each\
    \ other (indoor network or urban hotspot), or at a distance (rural\n   or remote\
    \ WAN).  Once slave devices switch to white-space spectrum\n   for their communications,\
    \ they may connect through the master to the\n   Internet or use white-space spectrum\
    \ for intra-network communications\n   only.  The master device can continue to\
    \ arbitrate and control white-\n   space communications by slave devices, and\
    \ it may notify them when\n   they are required to change white-space frequencies\
    \ or cease white-\n   space communications.\n   Figure 2 depicts the general architecture\
    \ of such a simple master-\n   slave network in which the master device communicates\
    \ with a database\n   on its own behalf and on behalf of slave devices.\n    \

    \           --------\n                Figure 2: Master-Slave White-Space Network\n\
    \   The protocol requirements for these master-slave devices and other\n   similar\
    \ scenarios is essentially the same: the protocol must support\n   the ability\
    \ of a master device to make available-spectrum query\n   requests on behalf of\
    \ slave devices, passing device identification,\n   geolocation, and other slave\
    \ device parameters to the database as\n   required to obtain a list of white-space\
    \ spectrum available for use\n   by one or more slave devices.  Of course, different\
    \ use cases will\n   use this spectrum information in different ways, and the\
    \ details of\n   master/slave communications may be different for different use\
    \ cases.\n   Common steps that may occur in master-slave networks include the\n\
    \   following:\n   1.  The master device powers up.\n   2.  Slave devices may\
    \ power up and associate with the master device\n       via Wi-Fi or some other\
    \ over-the-air, non-white-space spectrum.\n       Until the slave device is allocated\
    \ white-space spectrum, any\n       master-slave or slave-slave communications\
    \ occurs over such non-\n       white-space spectrum.\n   3.  The master has Internet\
    \ connectivity, determines (or knows) its\n       location, and establishes a\
    \ connection to a trusted database (see\n       Section 3.2).\n   4.  The master\
    \ may register with the trusted database (see\n       Section 3.3).\n   5.  The\
    \ master sends a query to the trusted database requesting a\n       list of available\
    \ white-space spectrum based upon its\n       geolocation.  Query parameters may\
    \ include the master's location,\n       device identifier, and antenna height.\
    \  The master may send\n       available-spectrum requests to the database on\
    \ behalf of slave\n       devices.\n   6.  The database responds to the master's\
    \ query with a list of\n       available white-space spectrum, associated maximum\
    \ power levels,\n       and durations of time for spectrum use.  If the master\
    \ made\n       requests on behalf of slave devices, the master may transmit the\n\
    \       obtained available-spectrum lists to the slaves (or the master\n     \
    \  may allocate spectrum to slaves from the obtained spectrum\n       lists).\n\
    \   7.  The master may inform the database of the spectrum and power\n       level\
    \ it selects from the available spectrum list.  If a slave\n       device has\
    \ been allocated available white-space spectrum, the\n       slave may inform\
    \ the master of the spectrum and power level it\n       has chosen, and the master\
    \ may, in turn, relay such slave device\n       usage to the database.\n   8.\
    \  Further communication among masters and slaves over the white-\n       space\
    \ network may occur via the selected/allocated white-space\n       spectrum frequencies.\n\
    \   Note: Steps 5 through 7 may be repeated by the master device when it\n   (or\
    \ a slave device that uses the master as a proxy to communicate\n   with the database)\
    \ changes its location or operating parameters --\n   for example, after a master\
    \ changes location, it may query the\n   database for available spectrum at its\
    \ new location, then acknowledge\n   the subsequent response received from the\
    \ database with information\n   on the spectrum and power levels it is using at\
    \ the new location.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   PAWS is a protocol whereby a master device requests\
    \ a schedule of\n   available spectrum at its location (or the location of its\
    \ slave\n   devices) before it (or they) can operate using those frequencies.\n\
    \   Whereas the information provided by the database must be accurate and\n  \
    \ conform to applicable regulatory rules, the database cannot enforce,\n   through\
    \ the protocol, that a client device uses only the spectrum it\n   provided. \
    \ In other words, devices can put energy in the air and\n   cause interference\
    \ without asking the database.  Hence, PAWS security\n   considerations do not\
    \ include protection against malicious use of the\n   white-space spectrum.\n\
    \   Threat model for the PAWS protocol:\n      Assumptions:\n         The link\
    \ between the master device and the database can be\n         wired or wireless\
    \ and provides IP connectivity.  It is assumed\n         that an attacker has\
    \ full access to the network medium between\n         the master device and the\
    \ database.  The attacker may be able\n         to eavesdrop on any communications\
    \ between these entities.\n      Threat 1: User modifies a device to masquerade\
    \ as another valid\n      certified device\n         A master device identifies\
    \ itself to the database in order to\n         obtain information about available\
    \ spectrum.  Without suitable\n         protection mechanisms, devices can listen\
    \ to registration\n         exchanges and later register with the database by\
    \ claiming the\n         identity of another device.\n      Threat 2: Spoofed\
    \ database\n         A master device attempts to discover a database (or databases)\n\
    \         that it can query for available spectrum information.  An\n        \
    \ attacker may attempt to spoof a database and provide responses\n         to\
    \ a master device that are malicious and result in the master\n         device\
    \ causing interference to the primary user of the\n         spectrum.\n      Threat\
    \ 3: Modifying or jamming a query request\n         An attacker may modify or\
    \ jam the query request sent by a\n         master device to a database.  The\
    \ attacker may change the\n         location of the device or its capabilities\
    \ (transmit power,\n         antenna height, etc.), and, as a result, the database\
    \ responds\n         with incorrect information about available spectrum or maximum\n\
    \         transmit power allowed.  The result of such an attack is that\n    \
    \     the master device can cause interference to the primary user of\n      \
    \   the spectrum.  It may also result in a denial of service to the\n        \
    \ master device if the modified database response indicates that\n         no\
    \ channels are available to the master device or when a jammed\n         query\
    \ prevents the request from reaching the database.\n      Threat 4: Modifying\
    \ or jamming a query response\n         An attacker may modify or jam the query\
    \ response sent by the\n         database to a master device.  For example, an\
    \ attacker may\n         modify the available spectrum or power-level information\n\
    \         carried in the database response.  As a result, a master device\n  \
    \       may use spectrum that is not available at a location or may\n        \
    \ transmit at a greater power level than allowed.  Such\n         unauthorized\
    \ use can result in interference to the primary user\n         of that spectrum.\
    \  Alternatively, an attacker may modify a\n         database response to indicate\
    \ that no spectrum is available at\n         a location (or jam the response),\
    \ resulting in a denial of\n         service to the master device.\n      Threat\
    \ 5: Third-party tracking of white-space device location and\n      identity\n\
    \         A master device may provide its identity in addition to its\n      \
    \   location in the query request.  Such location/identity\n         information\
    \ can be gleaned by an eavesdropper and used for\n         unauthorized tracking\
    \ purposes.\n      Threat 6: Malicious individual acts as a database to terminate\
    \ or\n      unfairly limit spectrum access of devices\n         A database may\
    \ include a mechanism by which service and\n         spectrum allocated to a master\
    \ device can be revoked by sending\n         a revoke message to a master device.\
    \  A malicious user can\n         pretend to be a database and send a revoke message\
    \ to that\n         device.  This results in denial of service to the master\n\
    \         device.\n   The security requirements arising from the above threats\
    \ are captured\n   in the requirements of Section 5.2.\n"
