- title: 3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of seven major\n   components. They are:\n   o    RFC 1902\
    \ [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n        describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.\n   o    RFC 1903 [2] defines textual\
    \ conventions for SNMPv2.\n   o    RFC 1904 [3] defines conformance statements\
    \ for SNMPv2.\n   o    RFC 1905 [4] defines  transport mappings for SNMPv2.\n\
    \   o    RFC 1906 [5] defines the protocol operations used for network\n     \
    \   access to managed objects.\n   o    RFC 1907 [6] defines the Management Information\
    \ Base for SNMPv2.\n   o    RFC 1908 [7] specifies coexistance between SNMP and\
    \ SNMPv2.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose\
    \ of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type\n   together\
    \ with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation\
    \ of the object.  For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed\
    \ the descriptor, to refer to the\n   object type.\n"
- title: 4.  Message Flow Model
  contents:
  - "4.  Message Flow Model\n   A general model of message flow inside an MTA has\
    \ to be presented\n   before a MIB can be described. Generally speaking, message\
    \ flow is\n   modelled as occuring in four steps:\n    (1)   Messages are received\
    \ by the MTA from User Agents, Message\n          Stores, other MTAs, and gateways.\n\
    \    (2)   The \"next hop\" for the each message is determined. This is\n    \
    \      simply the destination the message is to be transmitted to; it\n      \
    \    may or may not be the final destination of the message.\n          Multiple\
    \ \"next hops\" may exist for a single message (as a\n          result of either\
    \ having multiple recipients or distribution\n          list expansion); this\
    \ may make it necessary to duplicate\n          messages.\n    (3)   If necessary\
    \ messages are converted into the format that's\n          appropriate for the\
    \ next hop. Conversion operations may be\n          successful or unsuccessful.\n\
    \    (4)   Messages are transmitted to the appropriate destination, which\n  \
    \        may be a User Agent, Message Store, another MTA, or gateway.\n   Storage\
    \ of messages in the MTA occurs at some point during this\n   process.  However,\
    \ it is important to note that storage may occur at\n   different and possibly\
    \ even multiple points during this process. For\n   example, some MTAs expand\
    \ messages into multiple copies as they are\n   received. In this case (1), (2),\
    \ and (3) may all occur prior to\n   storage. Other MTAs store messages precisely\
    \ as they are received and\n   perform all expansions and conversions during retransmission\n\
    \   processing. So here only (1) occurs prior to storage.  This leads to\n   situations\
    \ where, in general, a measurement of messages received may\n   not equal a measurement\
    \ of messages in store, or a measurement of\n   messages stored may not equal\
    \ a measurement of messages\n   retransmitted, or both.\n"
- title: 5.  MTA Objects
  contents:
  - "5.  MTA Objects\n   If there are one or more MTAs on the host, the following\
    \ MIB may be\n   used to monitor them. Any number of the MTAs on a single host\
    \ or\n   group of hosts may be monitored. Each MTA is dealt with as a separate\n\
    \   network service and has its own applTable entry in the Network\n   Services\
    \ Monitoring MIB.\n   The MIB described in this document covers only the portion\
    \ which is\n   specific to the monitoring of MTAs. The network service related\
    \ part\n   of the MIB is covered in a separate document [8].\n   This MIB defines\
    \ four tables. The first of these contains per-MTA\n   information that isn't\
    \ specific to any particular part of MTA. The\n   second breaks each MTA down\
    \ into a collection of separate components\n   called groups. Groups are described\
    \ in detail in the comments\n   embedded in the MIB below. The third table provides\
    \ a means of\n   correlating associations tracked by the network services MIB\
    \ with\n   specific groups within different MTAs. Finally, the fourth table\n\
    \   provides a means of tracking any errors encountered during the\n   operation\
    \ of the MTA. The first two tables must be implemented to\n   conform with this\
    \ MIB; the last two are optional.\n"
