    \ The commonly used\n   paper format is different in North America and the rest\
    \ of the world.\n   North America uses the 'Letter' format, while the rest of\
    \ the world\n   mostly uses the ISO-standard 'A4' format. This means that documents\n\
    \   formatted on one continent may not be easily printable on another\n   continent.\
    \ This memo gives advice on how to produce documents which\n   are equally well\
    \ printable with the Letter and the A4 formats. By\n   using the advice in this\
    \ document, you can put up a document on the\n   Internet, which recipients can\
    \ print without problem both in and\n   outside North America.\n   A very short\
    \ summary of the advice in this document: If you are using\n   U.S. Letter paper\
    \ format, ensure that both the left and right margins\n   are at least 21 mm (0.8\
    \ in). If you are using A4 paper format, ensure\n   that both the top and bottom\
    \ margins are at least 33 mm (1.3 in).\n"

  - "1.    Introduction\n   Certain text formats, for example Postscript (MIME-Type:\n\
    \   application/postscript; file extension .ps) and Portable Document\n   Format\
    \ (MIME-Type: application/pdf;  file extension .pdf) specify\n   exactly the page\
    \ layout of the printed document. The commonly used\n   paper format is different\
    \ in North America and the rest of the world.\n   North America uses the 'Letter'\
    \ format, while the rest of the world\n   uses the 'A4' format.\n   The North\
    \ American Letter format is 216 x 279 mm (8.5 x 11 in) while\n   the ISO standardised\
    \ A4 format is 210 x 297 mm (8.3 x 11.7 in). The\n   Letter format is thus 6 mm\
    \ (0.2 inches) wider, while the A4 format is\n   18 mm (0.7 inches) taller.\n\
    \   This means that documents formatted on one continent may not be\n   printable\
    \ on another continent. It is oboviously desirable that\n   documents on the Internet\
    \ are printable on all continents. This paper\n   gives advice on how to achieve\
    \ this.\n   This memo is not intended for HTML documents, but the advice may be\n\
    \   of value also for HTML developers in case they are using fixed-size\n   graphics\
    \ and fixed WIDTH sizes of objects in HTML documents.\n"

    \ margins\n   The reason why you have to add 18 respectively 6 mm to both the\
    \ top\n   and the bottom margin is that you do not know what kind of printer\n\
    \   the recipient uses, and different printers feed paper in different\n   ways,\
    \ requiring the margin to be added either at the top or the\n   bottom of the\
    \ paper. Left and right margins on any paper format\n   should be at least 20\
    \ mm wide to accomodate filing with ISO 838 hole\n   punches.\n   Note: Ensure\
    \ that also headers, footers, and page numbers are within\n   the suggested minimal\
    \ margins. Many word processors put headers,\n   footers and page numbers outside\
    \ the specified text margins.\n"
- title: '2.2   Method 2: Print with reduced size'
  contents:
  - "2.2   Method 2: Print with reduced size\n   This is a method useful for the recipient\
    \ of a document with the\n   wrong paper size: The recipient sets the printer\
    \ to print with\n   reduced size.  When the sender produces the PDF or Postscript\
    \ files,\n   the sender should 'print' with 100 % size, but when the recipient\n\
    \   prints the PDF or Postscript files, and if the program for printing\n   PDF\
    \ or Postscript files allows this, the recipient should print the\n   document\
    \ with 94% or less of full size. Many programs for printing\n   Postscript files\
    \ do not allow this. In that case, the recipient can\n   convert a Postscript\
    \ document to PDF format and then print it with\n   the PDF printing program.\
    \  This requires, however, that the recipient\n   has the Adobe Acrobat Distiller\
    \ program, which is not freeware.\n   Recent versions of the freeware ghostscript\
    \ can also convert to PDF\n   format. The user may also have to specify the paper\
    \ size as the\n   actual paper size loaded in the printer, not the paper size\
    \ specified\n   when the document was converted to PDF or Postscript format.\n\
    \   It is also possible to edit the Postscript file, and add a scale\n   command\
    \ to it, before sending it to the printer.\n   Method 2 can be more difficult\
    \ for the recipient, who has to manage\n   these settings himself. However, manufacturers\
    \ of printing software\n   may in the future make method 2 easier by making this\
    \ service\n   automatic, perhaps controlled by a 'shrink to fit paper size'\n\
    \   checkbox in the printing window and a 'default shrink to fit paper\n   size'\
    \ preference setting.\n   In general, the authors of this RFC recommend PDF as\
    \ the prefered\n   formatted document distribution format over Postscript, not\
    \ only\n   because PDF printing programs typically feature a 'shrink to fit'\n\
    \   option to handle different paper sizes elegantly, but also because\n   PDF\
    \ has built-in per page data compression, PDF files can be\n   displayed without\
    \ being fully downloaded, PDF is more portable, PDF\n   has a better method of\
    \ rendering fonts not available in the printer\n   and PDF allows to embed URLs.\n"

    \ need to print international\n   documents might choose to buy paper in the A4\
    \ size. It is available\n   in the U.S. from many large paper distribution companies,\
    \ and almost\n   all laser printers support it.\n"

  - "4.    Security Considerations\n   Adherence to the recommendations in this memo\
    \ will increase the\n   likelihood that a document will be readable, and look\
    \ the same, to\n   all recipients, and thus reduce the risk of misunderstanding.\
    \ The\n   recommendation does not in itself introduce any known new security\n\
    \   risks. Of course, there might be a risk that reliance on the\n   recommendations\
    \ in this memo will make certain writers too sure that\n   their documents will\
    \ look the same.\n   Postscript (TM) has well known security risks. These are\
    \ discussed in\n   [MIME].\n"
