Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.
In particular, it defines objects for managing a Routing Bridge (RBridge), also known as a TRILL Switch, based on the IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol.
This document describes a model for managing Routing Bridges (RBridges), also known as TRILL Switches, as defined in [RFC6325].
RBridges provide optimal pair wise forwarding without configuration using IS IS routing and encapsulation of traffic.
RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes.
They are as invisible to current IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol.
In creating an RBridge management model, the device is viewed primarily as a customer bridge.
For a discussion of the problem addressed by TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links), see [RFC5556].
RBridges support features specified for transparent bridges in IEEE 802.1, and the corresponding MIB modules are used to manage those features.
For IS IS purposes, the corresponding MIB module is used to manage the protocol.
This MIB module specifies those objects that are TRILL specific and hence not available in other MIB modules.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The RBridge MIB module is intended as an overall framework for managing RBridges, also known as TRILL Switches.
Where possible, the MIB references existing MIB definitions in order to maximize reuse.
This results in a considerable emphasis on the relationship with other MIB modules.
Starting with the physical interfaces, there are requirements for certain elements of the IF MIB to be implemented.
These elements are required in order to connect the per port parameters to higher level functions of the physical device.
Transparent bridging, VLANs, traffic classes, and multicast filtering are supported by the TRILL protocol, and the corresponding management is expected to conform to the BRIDGE MIB module [RFC4188] and to the P BRIDGE MIB and Q BRIDGE MIB modules [RFC4363].
The IS IS routing protocol is used in order to determine the optimum pair wise forwarding path.
This protocol is managed using the IS IS MIB module defined in [RFC4444].
Since the TRILL protocol specifies the use of a single level and a fixed area address of zero, some IS IS
MIB objects are not applicable.
Some IS IS MIB objects are used in the TRILL protocol.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Structure of the MIB Module Objects in this MIB module are arranged into subtrees.
Each subtree is organized as a set of related objects.
The various subtrees are shown below.
These are supplemented with required elements of the IF MIB, ISIS MIB, BRIDGE MIB, P BRIDGE MIB, Q BRIDGE MIB, and IEEE Bridge MIB modules.
Textual Conventions Textual conventions are defined to represent object types relevant to TRILL.
This subtree contains system  and port specific objects applicable to all RBridges.
This subtree contains objects applicable to the forwarding database used by the RBridge in making packet forwarding decisions.
Because it contains additional information used by the TRILL protocol not applicable to 802.1D/Q bridges, it is a superset of the corresponding subtrees defined in the BRIDGE MIB and Q BRIDGE MIB.
This subtree describes objects applicable to VLANs configured on the RBridge. 5.5.
This subtree describes objects relevant to RBridges that support the optional End Station Address Distribution Information (ESADI) protocol.
The rbridgeCounters Subtree This subtree contains statistics maintained by RBridges that can aid in monitoring and troubleshooting networks connected by them.
This subtree describes objects applicable to RBridges capable of snooping IPv4
and/or IPv6 multicast control frames and pruning IP multicast traffic based on detection of IP multicast routers and listeners.
This subtree contains objects relevant to distribution trees computed by RBridges for the forwarding of multi destination frames.
This subtree contains objects applicable to the TRILL IS IS protocol, beyond what is available in the ISIS MIB. 5.10.
The defined notifications are focused on the TRILL protocol functionality.
Notifications are defined for changes in the Designated RBridge status and the topology.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
The IF MIB, BRIDGE MIB, P BRIDGE MIB, Q BRIDGE MIB, IEEE8021 BRIDGE MIB, IEEE8021 Q BRIDGE MIB, and ISIS
MIB modules all contain objects relevant to the RBridge MIB.
Management objects contained in these modules are not duplicated here, to reduce overlap to the extent possible.
The Bridge MIB modules were originally written in the IETF and implemented by many vendors.
Per [RFC4663], this has recently been transferred to the IEEE 802.1 working group.
As vendors may have implemented either the IETF or IEEE Bridge MIB modules, this RBridge MIB module is designed to work with either one.
The port identification elements MUST be implemented in order to allow them to be cross referenced.
The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] requires that any MIB module that is an adjunct of the Interfaces MIB clarify specific areas within the Interfaces MIB module.
These areas were intentionally left vague in the Interfaces MIB module to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of certain media types.
Section 4 of [RFC2863] enumerates several areas that a media specific MIB module must clarify.
The implementor is referred to [RFC2863] in order to understand the general intent of these areas.
The following subtrees in the BRIDGE MIB [RFC4188] contain information relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality is implemented.
Relationship to P BRIDGE MIB
The following subtrees in the P BRIDGE MIB [RFC4363] contain information relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality is implemented.
Relationship to Q BRIDGE MIB
The following groups in the Q BRIDGE MIB [RFC4363] contain information relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality is implemented.
This functionality is also contained in the IEEE8021 Q BRIDGE MIB.
Relationship to IEEE8021 BRIDGE MIB
The following subtrees in the IEEE8021 BRIDGE MIB contain information relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality is implemented.
The following subtrees in the IEEE8021 Q BRIDGE MIB contain information relevant to RBridges when the corresponding functionality is implemented.
Relationship to ISIS MIB "Management Information Base for Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS IS)"
[RFC4444] defines a MIB module for the IS IS routing protocol when it is used to construct routing tables for IP networks.
While most of these objects are applicable to the TRILL layer 2 implementation, note the IS IS constraints for the current version of TRILL [RFC6325]:
The TRILL IS IS instance uses a single Level 1 IS IS area.
The TRILL Level 1 IS IS area
uses the fixed area address zero.
The TRILL IS IS instance is not used for IP address advertisement.
The TRILL IS IS instance is used for only a single protocol: TRILL.
Accordingly, tables that report IP address reachability and tables that allow configuration or reporting of multiple IS IS areas, multiple IS IS levels, or multiple protocols will be empty in the ISIS MIB module for the current version of TRILL.
Note also that when more than one instance of the IS IS protocol is running on a device, as in the case of a device performing both RBridge and IS IS IP router functions, multiple instances of the ISIS MIB module can be distinguished by the use of SNMPv3 contexts or SNMPv1 communities.
MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS
The following MIB module imports objects from the SNMPv2 SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2
CONF [RFC2580], IF MIB [RFC2863], INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001], BRIDGE MIB [RFC4188], and Q BRIDGE MIB [RFC4363].
(The IEEE Bridge MIB modules import similar TCs.)

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: The following tables and objects in the RBRIDGE MIB can be manipulated to interfere with the operation of RBridges:
rbridgeBaseUniMultipathEnable affects the ability of the RBridge to route unicast traffic over multiple paths, and rbridgeBaseMultiMultipathEnable affects the ability of the RBridge to route multi destination traffic over multiple paths.
rbridgeBasePortTable contains a number of objects that may affect network connectivity.
Actions that may be triggered by manipulating objects in this table include disabling of an RBridge port, discarding of native packets, disabling learning, and others.
rbridgeEsadiTable contains objects that affect the operation of the ESADI protocol used for learning, and manipulation of the objects contained therein can be used to confuse the learning ability of RBridges.
rbridgeDtreePriority can affect computation of distribution trees within an RBridge campus, thereby affecting the forwarding of multi destination traffic.
rbridgeTrillMinMtuDesired can affect the size of packets being used to exchange information between RBridges.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
For example, access to network topology and RBridge attributes can reveal information that should not be available to all users of the network.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
For other RBridge security considerations, see [RFC6325].
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
