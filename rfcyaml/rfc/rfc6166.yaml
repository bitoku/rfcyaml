  - "Abstract\n   This document provides instructions to IANA for the creation of\
    \ a\n   registry for PIM message types.  It specifies the initial content of\n\
    \   the registry, based on existing RFCs specifying PIM message types.\n   It\
    \ also specifies a procedure for registering new types.\n   In addition to this,\
    \ one message type is reserved, and may be used\n   for a future extension of\
    \ the message type space.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Apart from this document, there is no existing document\
    \ specifying a\n   registry for PIM message types.  PIM version 1 made use of\
    \ IGMP\n   [RFC1112], and there is an IGMP registry [IGMPREG] listing the\n  \
    \ message types used by PIM version 1.  PIM version 2, however, is not\n   based\
    \ on IGMP, and a separate PIM message type registry is needed.\n   There are currently\
    \ several RFCs specifying new PIM version 2 message\n   types that should be in\
    \ this new registry.  They are the RFCs for PIM\n   Dense Mode [RFC3973], PIM\
    \ Sparse Mode [RFC4601], and Bidirectional\n   PIM [RFC5015].\n   This document\
    \ specifies the initial content of the new PIM message\n   type registry, based\
    \ on those existing RFCs.  This document also\n   specifies a procedure for registering\
    \ new PIM message types.\n   In addition to this, this document reserves one message\
    \ type.  This\n   type may be used for a future extension of the message type\
    \ space.\n   The current message type space is only 4 bits, so it is not unlikely\n\
    \   that this will be needed.  How exactly the extension should be done\n   is\
    \ left to a future document.\n"
- title: 2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   This document only creates an IANA registry.\
    \  There may be a security\n   benefit in a well-known place for finding information\
    \ on which PIM\n   message types are valid and how they are used.  Apart from\
    \ that,\n   there are no security considerations.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created a PIM message type registry.  It\
    \ has been placed in\n   the \"Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)\" branch of\
    \ the tree.  Each\n   entry in the registry consists of a message type, a message\
    \ name, and\n   references to the documents defining the type.  The message type\
    \ is a\n   4-bit integer with possible values from 0 to 15.\n"
