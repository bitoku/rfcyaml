  - "Abstract\n   This memo reclassifies RFC 1863, A BGP/IDRP Route Server alternative\n\
    \   to a full mesh routing, to Historic status.  This memo also obsoletes\n  \
    \ RFC 1863.\n"
- title: 1.  Reclassification of RFC 1863 to Historic
  contents:
  - "1.  Reclassification of RFC 1863 to Historic\n   RFC 1863 [1] describes the use\
    \ of route servers as an alternative to\n   BGP/IDRP full mesh routing.\n   In\
    \ the context of this document, the term \"RFC 1863 route server\" is\n   used\
    \ to refer to a route server as specified in RFC 1863.  Other uses\n   of the\
    \ term \"route server\" are outside the scope of this document.\n   Implementations\
    \ of RFC 1863 route servers do not exist and are not\n   used as an alternative\
    \ to full mesh routing.  Therefore, RFC 1863 is\n   reclassified to Historic status.\n\
    \   Current techniques that serve as an alternative to full mesh routing\n   include\
    \ BGP Route Reflectors [2], BGP Confederedations [3], and the\n   use of private\
    \ AS numbers.  IDRP for IP has never been standardized\n   by the IETF and can\
    \ be considered obsolete.\n   Other uses of (non-RFC1863) route servers, rather\
    \ than as an\n   alternative to full mesh routing as described by RFC 1863, are\n\
    \   expected to continue to be used for multiple purposes, but are out of\n  \
    \ the scope of this memo.\n"
