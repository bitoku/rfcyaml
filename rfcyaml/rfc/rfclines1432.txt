Abstract This article originally appeared in Volume 2 Number 12, (December 1992) of Matrix News, the monthly newsletter of Matrix Information and Directory Services,
Which Books Here is a list of books related to using the Internet, which is the global and exponentially growing network of more than a million computers that communicate by interactive use of the TCP/IP protocols, for the use of millions of users.
This article was prompted by the recent publication of nine or ten books on the Internet in the space of a year (some are so new they aren't even published yet).
I have also included some books that have been around for quite a long time (as long ago as the dim past of 1984).
I think all of them contain useful information for people new to the Internet.
Some of the books included here are about more than the Internet.
Some of them are about the Matrix, which is the set of all computer networks worldwide that exchange electronic mail.
The Matrix includes FidoNet, UUCP, BITNET, USENET, the Internet, and many others, but is not limited to any one of those networks.
This particular bibliographic collection is oriented around the largest computer network in the world, the Internet, because of all the recent books about that network.
Matrix News continues to publish information about the Matrix, including but not limited to the Internet.
I have excluded from this article books that are solely about technical aspects of technology, such as the TCP/IP protocols.
Instead, I have included books about the resources and users of the Internet.
I have grouped them in rough classifications for convenience of presentation.
Several of these books fit several classifications.
For that reason and others, the classifications should be taken as illustrative, not definitive.
Table 1 summarizes some features of all the books described.
Thanks to various people for input; especially David Bridge.
Much of the detailed bibliographic information came from the Library of Congress catalog server supported by Digital Research Associates, Inc., accessed via gopher and Telnet over the Internet.
Please note that prices may change, as may electronic mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and postal addresses.
The price you pay, in particular, may be less because of a discount, or more because of shipping, or because you buy the book outside of the United States.
The information included here is accurate to the best of my knowledge, but your mileage may vary.
Use at your own risk.
But please do report errors, changes, and additions to mids@tic.com.

Introductions New user guides and information on getting connected fill most of the new books about the Internet.

Many fine lunches and dinners with users, administrators, and developers of the Internet in many countries around the world, with accurate technical background.
Certainly the most wickedly funny of all the books about the Internet.
