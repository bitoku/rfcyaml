- title: '1.  Introduction to the Problem of Name Space Fragmentation:'
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction to the Problem of Name Space Fragmentation:\n    following the\
    \ referral chain\n   A resolver that tries to look up a name starts out at the\
    \ root, and\n   follows referrals until it is referred to a name server that is\n\
    \   authoritative for the name.  If somewhere down the chain of referrals\n  \
    \ it is referred to a name server that is only accessible over a\n   transport\
    \ which the resolver cannot use, the resolver is unable to\n   finish the task.\n\
    \   When the Internet moves from IPv4 to a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 it is\n  \
    \ only a matter of time until this starts to happen.  The complete DNS\n   hierarchy\
    \ then starts to fragment into a graph where authoritative\n   name servers for\
    \ certain nodes are only accessible over a certain\n   transport.  The concern\
    \ is that a resolver using only a particular\n   version of IP and querying information\
    \ about another node using the\n   same version of IP can not do it because somewhere\
    \ in the chain of\n   servers accessed during the resolution process, one or more\
    \ of them\n   will only be accessible with the other version of IP.\n   With all\
    \ DNS data only available over IPv4 transport everything is\n   simple.  IPv4\
    \ resolvers can use the intended mechanism of following\n   referrals from the\
    \ root and down while IPv6 resolvers have to work\n   through a \"translator\"\
    , i.e., they have to use a recursive name\n   server on a so-called \"dual stack\"\
    \ host as a \"forwarder\" since they\n   cannot access the DNS data directly.\n\
    \   With all DNS data only available over IPv6 transport everything would\n  \
    \ be equally simple, with the exception of IPv4 recursive name servers\n   having\
    \ to switch to a forwarding configuration.\n   However, the second situation will\
    \ not arise in the foreseeable\n   future.  Instead, the transition will be from\
    \ IPv4 only to a mixture\n   of IPv4 and IPv6, with three categories of DNS data\
    \ depending on\n   whether the information is available only over IPv4 transport,\
    \ only\n   over IPv6 or both.\n   Having DNS data available on both transports\
    \ is the best situation.\n   The major question is how to ensure that it becomes\
    \ the norm as\n   quickly as possible.  However, while it is obvious that some\
    \ DNS data\n   will only be available over v4 transport for a long time it is\
    \ also\n   obvious that it is important to avoid fragmenting the name space\n\
    \   available to IPv4 only hosts.  For example, during transition it is\n   not\
    \ acceptable to break the name space that we presently have\n   available for\
    \ IPv4-only hosts.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The phrase \"IPv4 name server\" indicates a name server available\
    \ over\n   IPv4 transport.  It does not imply anything about what DNS [1,2] data\n\
    \   is served.  Likewise, \"IPv6 [4,5,6] name server\" indicates a name\n   server\
    \ available over IPv6 transport.  The phrase \"dual-stack name\n   server\" indicates\
    \ a name server that is actually configured to run\n   both protocols, IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6, and not merely a server running on a\n   system capable of running both\
    \ but actually configured to run only\n   one.\n"
- title: 3.  Policy Based Avoidance of Name Space Fragmentation
  contents:
  - "3.  Policy Based Avoidance of Name Space Fragmentation\n   Today there are only\
    \ a few DNS \"zones\" on the public Internet that\n   are available over IPv6\
    \ transport, and most of them can be regarded\n   as \"experimental\".  However,\
    \ as soon as the root and top level\n   domains are available over IPv6 transport,\
    \ it is reasonable to expect\n   that it will become more common to have zones\
    \ served by IPv6 servers.\n   Having those zones served only by IPv6-only name\
    \ server would not be\n   a good development, since this will fragment the previously\n\
    \   unfragmented IPv4 name space and there are strong reasons to find a\n   mechanism\
    \ to avoid it.\n   The recommended approach to maintain name space continuity\
    \ is to use\n   administrative policies, as described in the next section.\n"
- title: 4.  DNS IPv6 Transport recommended Guidelines
  contents:
  - "4.  DNS IPv6 Transport recommended Guidelines\n   In order to preserve name space\
    \ continuity, the following\n   administrative policies are recommended:\n   \
    \   - every recursive name server SHOULD be either IPv4-only or dual\n       \
    \ stack,\n         This rules out IPv6-only recursive servers.  However, one might\n\
    \         design configurations where a chain of IPv6-only name server\n     \
    \    forward queries to a set of dual stack recursive name server\n         actually\
    \ performing those recursive queries.\n      - every DNS zone SHOULD be served\
    \ by at least one IPv4-reachable\n        authoritative name server.\n       \
    \  This rules out DNS zones served only by IPv6-only authoritative\n         name\
    \ servers.\n   Note: zone validation processes SHOULD ensure that there is at\
    \ least\n   one IPv4 address record available for the name servers of any child\n\
    \   delegations within the zone.\n"

    \ happened in\n   the DNS community at IETF and elsewhere since 2001.  During\
    \ that\n   period of time, a number of Internet drafts have been published to\n\
    \   clarify various aspects of the issues at stake.  This document\n   focuses\
    \ on the conclusion of those discussions.\n   The authors would like to acknowledge\
    \ the role of Pekka Savola in his\n   thorough review of the document.\n"
