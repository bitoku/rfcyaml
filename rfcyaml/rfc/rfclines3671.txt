Abstract X.500 collective attributes allow common characteristics to be shared between collections of entries.
This document summarizes the X.500 information model for collective attributes and describes use of collective attributes in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).
This document provides schema definitions for collective attributes for use in LDAP.
In X.500 [X.500], a collective attribute is "a user attribute whose values are the same for each member of an entry collection" [X.501].
This document details their use in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC3377].
A collection of entries is a grouping of object and alias entries based upon common properties or shared relationship between the corresponding entries which share certain attributes.
An entry collection consists of all entries within scope of a collective attributes subentry [RFC3672].
An entry can belong to several entry collections.
Collective Attributes Attributes shared by the entries comprising an entry collection are called collective attributes.
Values of collective attributes are visible but not updateable to clients accessing entries within the collection.
Collective attributes are updated (i.e., modified) via their associated collective attributes subentry.
When an entry belongs to multiple entry collections, the entry's values of each collective attribute are combined such that independent sources of these values are not manifested to clients.
Entries can specifically exclude a particular collective attribute by listing the attribute as a value of the collectiveExclusions attribute.
Like other user attributes, collective attributes are subject to a variety of controls including access, administrative, and content controls.
Conventions Schema definitions are provided using LDAPv3 [RFC2251] description formats [RFC2252].
Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for readability.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
System Schema for Collective Attributes
The following operational attributes are used to manage Collective Attributes.
LDAP servers [RFC3377] MUST act in accordance with the X.500 Directory Models [X.501] when providing this service.
collectiveAttributeSubentry Subentries of this object class are used to administer collective attributes and are referred to as collective attribute subentries.
( 2.5.17.2 NAME 'collectiveAttributeSubentry' AUXILIARY )
A collective attribute subentry SHOULD contain at least one collective attribute.
The collective attributes contained within a collective attribute subentry are available for finding, searching, and comparison at every entry within the scope of the subentry.
The collective attributes, however, are administered (e.g., modified) via the subentry.
Implementations of this specification SHOULD support collective attribute subentries in both collectiveAttributeSpecificArea (2.5.23.5)
and collectiveAttributeInnerArea (2.5.23.6) administrative areas [RFC3672][X.501].
The collectiveAttributeSubentries operational attribute identifies all collective attribute subentries that affect the entry.
( 2.5.18.12 NAME 'collectiveAttributeSubentries' EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
NO USER MODIFICATION ) 2.3.
The collectiveExclusions operational attribute allows particular collective attributes to be excluded from an entry.
It MAY appear in any entry and MAY have multiple values.
( 2.5.18.7 NAME 'collectiveExclusions' EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38 USAGE directoryOperation )
The descriptor excludeAllCollectiveAttributes is associated with the OID 2.5.18.0.
When this descriptor or OID is present as a value of the collectiveExclusions attribute, all collective attributes are excluded from an entry.
Collective Attribute Types A userApplications attribute type can be defined to be COLLECTIVE [RFC2252].
This indicates that the same attribute values will appear in the entries of an entry collection subject to the use of the collectiveExclusions attribute and other administrative controls.
These administrative controls MAY include DIT Content Rules, if implemented.
Collective attribute types are commonly defined as subtypes of non  collective attribute types.
By convention, collective attributes are named by prefixing the name of their non collective supertype with "c ".
For example, the collective telephone attribute is named c TelephoneNumber after its non collective supertype telephoneNumber.
Non collective attributes types SHALL NOT subtype collective attributes.
Collective attributes SHALL NOT be SINGLE VALUED.
Collective attribute types SHALL NOT appear in the attribute types of an object class definition.
Operational attributes SHALL NOT be defined to be collective.
The remainder of section provides a summary of collective attributes derived from those defined in [X.520].
The SUPerior attribute types are described in [RFC 2256] for use with LDAP.
Implementations of this specification SHOULD support the following collective attributes and MAY support additional collective attributes.
The c l attribute type specifies a locality name for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.7.1 NAME 'c l' SUP l COLLECTIVE )
Collective State or Province Name
The c st attribute type specifies a state or province name for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.8.1 NAME 'c st' SUP st COLLECTIVE ) 3.3.
The c street attribute type specifies a street address for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.9.1 NAME 'c street' SUP street COLLECTIVE )
The c o attribute type specifies an organization name for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.10.1 NAME 'c o' SUP COLLECTIVE )
The c ou attribute type specifies an organizational unit name for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.11.1 NAME 'c ou' SUP ou COLLECTIVE )
The c PostalAddress attribute type specifies a postal address for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.16.1 NAME 'c PostalAddress' SUP postalAddress COLLECTIVE ) 3.7.
The c PostalCode attribute type specifies a postal code for a collection of entries.
NAME 'c PostalCode' SUP postalCode COLLECTIVE ) 3.8.
The c PostOfficeBox attribute type specifies a post office box for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.18.1 NAME 'c PostOfficeBox' SUP postOfficeBox COLLECTIVE ) 3.9.
Collective Physical Delivery Office Name
The c PhysicalDeliveryOfficeName attribute type specifies a physical delivery office name for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.19.1 NAME 'c PhysicalDeliveryOfficeName' SUP physicalDeliveryOfficeName COLLECTIVE ) 3.10.
The c TelephoneNumber attribute type specifies a telephone number for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.20.1 NAME 'c TelephoneNumber' SUP telephoneNumber COLLECTIVE )
The c TelexNumber attribute type specifies a telex number for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.21.1 NAME 'c TelexNumber' SUP telexNumber COLLECTIVE )
The c FacsimileTelephoneNumber attribute type specifies a facsimile telephone number for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.23.1 NAME 'c FacsimileTelephoneNumber' SUP facsimileTelephoneNumber COLLECTIVE ) 3.14.
The c InternationalISDNNumber attribute type specifies an international ISDN number for a collection of entries.
( 2.5.4.25.1 NAME 'c InternationalISDNNumber' SUP internationalISDNNumber COLLECTIVE )
Security Considerations Collective attributes, like other attributes, are subject to access control restrictions and other administrative policy.
Generally speaking, collective attributes accessed via an entry in a collection are governed by rules restricting access to attributes of that entry.
And collective attributes access via a subentry are governed by rules restricting access to attributes of that subentry.
However, as LDAP does not have a standard access model, the particulars of each server's access control system may differ.
General LDAP security considerations [RFC3377] also apply.
The IANA has registered the LDAP descriptors [RFC3383] defined in this technical specification.
