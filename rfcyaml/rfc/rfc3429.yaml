  contents:
  - "2. OAM functions\n   MPLS OAM (Operation and Maintenance) functions provide necessary\n\
    \   tools for network operators to operate and maintain the networks.\n   MPLS\
    \ OAM functionality is required at the MPLS layer, and more\n   specifically at\
    \ each MPLS level, independent of OAM functionality\n   provided by the lower\
    \ layers (SONET/SDH, etc.).  The objectives of\n   the OAM functions include the\
    \ following:\n   -  Defect and failure detection: Defect/failures affecting the\n\
    \      transport of user information are detected by continuous or\n      periodic\
    \ checking.  As a result, maintenance event information or\n      appropriate\
    \ alarms will be produced.\n   -  Reporting the defect/failure information: Defect\
    \ information is\n      given to other management entities (e.g., Operation Support\n\
    \      System) in order to provide the appropriate indications to the\n      maintenance\
    \ staff for maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS)\n      level offered to customers.\n\
    \   -  Defect/failure localization: Determination by internal or external\n  \
    \    test systems of a failed entity is performed if defect information\n    \
    \  is insufficient.\n   -  Performance monitoring: Performance (packet losses,\
    \ transfer\n      delay, bit errors, etc.) of the user information transport is\n\
    \      measured in order to estimate the transport integrity.\n"

    \   One of the reserved label values defined in RFC 3032 (MPLS label\n   stack\

- title: 5.2 Applicability of MPLS OAM to PHP
  contents:
  - "5.2 Applicability of MPLS OAM to PHP\n   There are two cases where PHP is used:\n\
    \   Case 1: The ultimate node is an MPLS LSR, and implements both MPLS\n   control-plane\
    \ and data-plane, but is not able to perform 2 lookups at\n   line rate.  So it\
    \ asks the penultimate node to pop the top label\n   (rather than swapping it),\
    \ using the MPLS reserved label 3 (implicit\n   null label) as per defined in\
    \ RFC 3032 [2].\n   Case 2: The ultimate node has no MPLS label look up and processing\n\
    \   capability and does not recognize labeled packets.  This node asks\n   for\
    \ PHP, using the MPLS reserved label 3 (implicit null label) as\n   defined in\
    \ RFC 3032 [2].\n   Currently, MPLS OAM functions defined in ITU-T Recommendation\
    \ Y.1711\n   [1] can only be applied to Case 1.  The next subsection describes\
    \ the\n   node behavior in Case 1.  Application for Case 2 needs further study.\n\
    \   Also, application to carrier supporting carrier scenarios is for\n   future\
    \ study.\n"
- title: 5.3 Node behavior when OAM functions are activated
  contents:
  - "5.3 Node behavior when OAM functions are activated\n   Where the ultimate LSR\
    \ is an MPLS LSR and PHP is in effect, the\n   penultimate LSR pops the top label\
    \ and forwards the OAM packet (with\n   the OAM label and the OAM payload intact)\
    \ to the ultimate LSR [5].\n   -  If the ultimate LSR supports MPLS OAM, it understands\
    \ that a\n      received packet with an OAM label on top is an OAM packet, since\n\
    \      the original top label has been removed by the penultimate LSR.\n     \
    \ It also knows the ingress LSR that originated the MPLS OAM packet\n      from\
    \ the TTSI (Trail Termination Source Identifier) value of the\n      received\
    \ MPLS OAM packet.  TTSI is a unique identifier for ingress\n      LSR that is\
    \ contained in MPLS OAM packets (see ITU-T\n      Recommendation Y.1711 [1]).\n\
    \   -  If the ultimate LSR does not support MPLS OAM, the OAM packet is\n    \
    \  discarded as per section 3.18 of RFC 3031 [5].\n"

    \ of the\n   network layer protocol contained within the encapsulation.\n   OAM\
    \ functions could enhance the security of MPLS networks.  For\n   example, Connectivity\
    \ Verification (CV) function defined in ITU-T\n   Recommendation Y.1711 [1] can\
    \ detect mis-connections, and therefore\n   can prevent customers' traffic being\
    \ exposed to other customers.\n"
