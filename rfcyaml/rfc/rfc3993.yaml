  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCP (RFC 2131 [2]) provides IP addresses and configuration\n
    \  information for IPv4 clients.  It includes a relay agent capability\n   in
    which processes within the network infrastructure receive\n   broadcast messages
    from clients and forward them to DHCP servers as\n   unicast messages.  In network
    environments such as DOCSIS data-over-\n   cable and xDSL, it has proven useful
    for the relay agent to add\n   information to the DHCP message before forwarding
    it, by using the\n   relay agent information option (RFC 3046 [3]).\n   Servers
    that recognize the relay agent option echo it back in their\n   replies, and some
    of the information that relays add may be used to\n   help an edge device efficiently
    return replies to clients.  The\n   information that relays supply can also be
    used in the server's\n   decision making about the addresses and configuration
    parameters that\n   the client should receive.\n   In many service provider environments,
    it is desirable to associate\n   some provider-specific information with clients'
    DHCP messages.  This\n   is often done by using the relay agent information option.
    \ RFC 3046\n   defines Remote-ID and Circuit-ID suboptions that are used to carry\n
    \  such information.  The values of those suboptions, however, are\n   usually
    based on a network resource such as an IP address of a\n   network access device,
    an ATM Virtual Circuit identifier, or a DOCSIS\n   cable-modem identifier.  As
    a result, the values carried in these\n   suboptions are dependent on the physical
    network configuration.  If a\n   client connects to the service provider network
    through different\n   paths, different values are carried in network-dependent
    suboptions.\n"

  - "3.  The Subscriber-ID Suboption\n   In complex service provider environments,
    connecting a customer's\n   DHCP configuration and administrative information
    is necessary.  The\n   Subscriber-ID suboption carries a value that can be independent
    of\n   the physical network configuration through which the subscriber is\n   connected.
    \ This value complements, and might well be used in\n   addition to, the network-based
    relay agent option suboptions\n   discussed in Section 2.  The \"subscriber-id\"
    assigned by the provider\n   is intended to be stable as customers connect through
    different\n   paths, and as network changes occur.\n   The Subscriber-ID information
    allows the service provider to\n   assign/activate subscriber-specific actions;
    e.g., assignment of host\n   IP address and subnet mask, DNS configuration, or
    trigger accounting.\n   This suboption is de-coupled from the access network's
    physical\n   structure, so subscriber moves from one access-point to another,
    for\n   example, would not require reconfiguration at the service provider's\n
    \  DHCP servers.\n   The Subscriber-ID is an ASCII string; the encoding of the
    string is\n   defined in Section 3.1.  The semantic contents of the Subscriber-ID\n
    \  string are, of course, provider-specific.  This specification does\n   not
    establish any semantic requirements on the data in the string.\n"

    - "3.1.  Suboption Format\n   This memo defines a new DHCP relay agent option
      suboption that\n   carries a \"Subscriber-ID\" value.  The value is an ASCII
      string.  The\n   suboption takes a form similar to that of many other relay\n
      \  information option suboptions:\n       0     1     2     3     4     5\n
      \      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+--\n       |Code | Len | Subscriber-ID
      string ...\n       +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+--\n   The Code for the
      suboption is 6.\n   The one-octet Len field is the length of the ID string,
      in octets.\n   The minimum length of the ID string is 1 octet.\n   The \"Subscriber-ID\"
      is an NVT ASCII [4] string.  The string MUST NOT\n   be NULL terminated, as
      the length is specified in the \"Len\" field.\n"

    Subscriber-ID\n   suboption if they include a relay agent information option in
    relayed\n   DHCP messages.  The subscriber-id strings themselves are assigned
    and\n   configured through mechanisms that are outside the scope of this\n   memo.\n"

  - "5.  DHCP Server Behavior\n   This suboption provides additional information to
    the DHCP server.\n   If it is configured to support this option, the DHCP server
    may use\n   this information in addition to other relay agent option data and\n
    \  other options included in the DHCP client messages in order to assign\n   an
    IP address and/or other configuration parameters to the client.\n   There is no
    special additional processing for this suboption.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain
    use where the out-of-\n   band exchange of a shared secret is feasible is defined
    in RFC 3118\n   [5].  Potential exposures to attacks are discussed in section
    7 of\n   the DHCP protocol specification in RFC 2131 [2].\n   The DHCP relay agent
    option depends on a trusted relationship between\n   the DHCP relay agent and
    the server, as described in section 5 of RFC\n   3046.  Fraudulent relay agent
    option data could potentially lead to\n   theft-of-service or exhaustion of limited
    resources (like IP\n   addresses) by unauthorized clients.  A host that tampered
    with relay\n   agent data associated with another host's DHCP messages could deny\n
    \  service to that host, or interfere with its operation by leading the\n   DHCP
    server to assign it inappropriate configuration parameters.\n   While the introduction
    of fraudulent relay agent options can be\n   prevented by a perimeter defense
    that blocks these options unless the\n   relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense
    using authentication for\n   relay agent options via the Authentication Suboption
    [6] or IPSec [7]\n   SHOULD be deployed as well.\n   There are several data fields
    in a DHCP message conveying information\n   that may identify an individual host
    on the network.  These include\n   the chaddr, the client-id option, and the hostname
    and client-fqdn\n   options.  Depending on the type of identifier selected, the\n
    \  Subscriber-ID suboption may also convey information that identifies a\n   specific
    host or a specific user on the network.  In practice, this\n   information isn't
    exposed outside the internal service-provider\n   network, where DHCP messages
    are usually confined.  Administrators\n   who configure data that's going to be
    used in DHCP Subscriber-ID\n   suboptions should be careful to use identifiers
    that are appropriate\n   for the types of networks they administer.  If DHCP messages
    travel\n   outside the service-provider's own network, or if the suboption\n   values
    may become visible to other users, that may raise privacy\n   concerns for the
    access provider or service provider.\n"
