- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Uniform Resource Name (URN) technology [RFC2141] provides\
    \ a way\n   to generate persistent, location-independent resource identifiers.\n\
    \   The primary \"scope\" of a URN is provided by its namespace identifier\n \
    \  (NID).  As specified in [RFC3406], there are three kinds of NIDs:\n   formal,\
    \ informal, and experimental.  Most of the NIDs registered to\n   date are formal.\
    \  As far as is known, the few informal namespaces\n   have not been widely used,\
    \ and the experimental namespaces are by\n   definition unregistered.\n   The\
    \ experimental namespaces take the form \"X-NID\" (where \"NID\" is the\n   desired\
    \ namespace identifier).  Because the \"X-\" convention has been\n   deprecated\
    \ in general [RFC6648], it seems sensible to achieve the\n   same objective in\
    \ a different way.  Therefore, this document\n   registers a formal namespace\
    \ identifier of \"example\", similar to\n   \"example.com\" and other domain names\
    \ [RFC2606].  Under the \"example\"\n   NID, specification authors and code developers\
    \ can mint URNs for use\n   in documentation and in URN-related testing and experimentation\
    \ by\n   assigning their own unique Namespace Specific Strings without fear of\n\
    \   conflicts with current or future actual URNs.  Such URNs are intended\n  \
    \ for use as examples in documentation, testing of code for URN and URI\n   processing,\
    \ URN-related experimentation, invalid URNs, and other\n   similar uses.  They\
    \ are not intended for testing non-URI code or for\n   building higher-level applications\
    \ for use over the Internet or\n   private networks (e.g., as XML namespace names),\
    \ since it is\n   relatively easy to mint URIs whose authority component is a\
    \ domain\n   name controlled by the person or organization that wishes to engage\n\
    \   in such testing and experimentation.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in\n   [RFC2119].\n"

- title: 3.6.  Identifier Uniqueness Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Identifier Uniqueness Considerations\n   Those who mint example URNs ought\
    \ to strive for uniqueness in the\n   Namespace Specific String portion of the\
    \ URN.  However, such\n   uniqueness cannot be guaranteed through the assignment\
    \ process.\n   Therefore, it is NOT RECOMMENDED for implementers to use example\
    \ URNs\n   for any purposes other than documentation, private testing, and truly\n\
    \   experimental contexts.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Identifier Persistence Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Identifier Persistence Considerations\n   Once minted, an example URN is\
    \ immutable.  However, it is simply a\n   string; and there is no guarantee that\
    \ the documentation, test suite,\n   or other application using the URN is immutable.\n"

  - "3.8.  Process of Identifier Assignment\n   Assignment is completely open, since\

- title: 3.9.  Process for Identifier Resolution
  contents:
  - "3.9.  Process for Identifier Resolution\n   Example URNs are not intended to\

- title: 3.13.  Scope
  contents:
  - "3.13.  Scope\n   The scope of an example URN is limited to the documentation\
    \ in which\n   it is found, the test in which it is used, the experiment in which\
    \ it\n   appears, etc.  Example URNs have no meaning outside such strictly\n \
    \  limited contexts.\n"
- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   No existing formal namespace enables entities\
    \ to generate URNs that\n   are appropriate for use as examples in documentation\
    \ and in\n   URN-related testing and experimentation.  It could be argued that\
    \ no\n   such formal namespace is needed, given that experimental namespaces\n\
    \   can be minted at will.  However, experimental namespaces run afoul of\n  \
    \ the trend away from using the \"X-\" convention in the names of\n   protocol\
    \ parameters and identifiers [RFC6648].  Additionally, in\n   practice, specification\
    \ authors often mint examples using fake NIDs\n   that go unregistered because\
    \ they are never intended to be used.  To\n   minimize the possibility of confusion,\
    \ use of this dedicated example\n   namespace is recommended for generating example\
    \ URNs.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   The \"example\" NID is intended to provide a\
    \ clean, easily recognizable\n   space for minting examples to be used in documentation\
    \ and in\n   URN-related testing and experimentation.  The NSS is best as a unique\n\
    \   string, generated by the person, organization, or other entity that\n   creates\
    \ the documentation, test suite, or other application.  There\n   is no issuing\
    \ authority for example URNs, and it is not intended that\n   they can be resolved\
    \ in any meaningful way.\n   The \"example\" NID does not obviate the need to\
    \ coordinate with\n   issuing authorities for existing namespaces (e.g., minting\n\
    \   \"urn:example:xmpp:foo\" instead of requesting issuance of\n   \"urn:xmpp:foo\"\
    ), to register new namespace identifiers if existing\n   namespaces do not match\
    \ one's desired functionality (e.g., minting\n   \"urn:example:sha-1:29ead03e784b2f636a23ffff95ed12b56e2f2637\"\
    \ instead\n   of registering the \"sha-1\" NID), or to respect the basic spirit\
    \ of\n   URN NID assignment (e.g., setting up shadow NIDs such as\n   \"urn:example:MyCompany:*\"\
    \ instead of using, say, HTTP URIs).\n"
