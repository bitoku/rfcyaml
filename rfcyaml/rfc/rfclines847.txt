This is a summary of the surveys of Telnet, FTP and Mail (SMTP)
servers conducted by David Smallberg in December 1982 and January and February 1983 as reported in RFC 832 843, 845 846.
This memo extracts the number of hosts that accepted the connection to their server for each of Telnet, FTP, and SMTP, and compares it to the total host in the Internet (not counting TACs or ECHOS).
One would not expect the percentage to reach 100, since some hosts will be down when the surveys are run, but many hosts are for special purposes and don't offer these services.
We estimate that 37 hosts or 11 percent are in this catagory and the highest percentage one could reasonably expect is 89.
