  - "Abstract\n   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery's Router Advertisement message contains\n
    \  an 8-bit field reserved for single-bit flags.  Several protocols have\n   reserved
    flags in this field and others are preparing to reserve a\n   sufficient number
    of flags to exhaust the field.  This document\n   defines an option to the Router
    Advertisement message that expands\n   the number of flag bits available.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol's (NDP) [RFC4861] Router\n
    \  Advertisement message contains an 8-bit field reserved for single-bit\n   flags.
    \ Several protocols have reserved flags in this field and\n   others are preparing
    to reserve a sufficient number of flags to\n   exhaust the field.\n   This document
    defines an option for the Router Advertisement message\n   that expands the available
    number of flag bits by adding an\n   additional 48 flag bits to NDP messages.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"

  title: 2.  Terminology

  - "3.  Current Router Advertisement Flags\n   Currently, the NDP Router Advertisement
    message contains the\n   following one-bit flags defined in published RFCs:\n
    \   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   |M|O|H|Prf|P|R|R|\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \                  Figure 1: Router Advertisement Flags\n   o  M - Managed Address
    Configuration Flag [RFC4861]\n   o  O - Other Configuration Flag [RFC4861]\n   o
    \ H - Mobile IPv6 Home Agent Flag [RFC3775]\n   o  Prf - Router Selection Preferences
    [RFC4191]\n   o  P - Neighbor Discovery Proxy Flag [RFC4389]\n   o  R - Reserved\n
    \  With other protocols in the works (e.g., Detecting Network\n   Attachment)
    that want to use flags in the NDP messages, it is\n   necessary to define an expansion
    capability to support new features.\n"

  - "4.  Flags Expansion Option\n   The Neighbor Discovery specification [RFC4861]
    contains the\n   capability to define NDP options.  The following (Figure 2) is
    the\n   definition of the Expanded Flags Option (EFO) for NDP Router\n   Advertisement
    messages.\n    0                   1                   2                   3\n

    \  ... for assignment                                              |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \          Figure 2: Router Advertisement Expanded Flags Option\n   o  Type -
    26\n   o  Length - The length MUST be checked when processing the option in\n
    \     order to allow for future expansion of this option.  An\n      implementation
    of this specification MUST set the Length to 1,\n      MUST ignore any unrecognized
    data, and MUST be able to recognize\n      the specific length in order to skip
    over unrecognized bits.\n   o  Bits - allocated by IANA\n   The definition and
    usage of these bits is to be found in the document\n   requesting their allocation.\n
    \  During the construction/transmission, this option:\n   o  MUST only occur in
    Router Advertisement messages.\n   o  MUST occur prior to any additional options
    associated with any\n      flags set in this option.\n   o  MUST only occur once
    in the Router Advertisement message.\n   o  MUST NOT be added to a Router Advertisement
    message if no flags in\n      the option are set.\n   o  MUST set all unused flags
    to zero.\n   Upon reception, a receiver processing NDP messages containing this\n
    \  option:\n   o  MUST ignore the option if it occurs in a message other than
    a\n      Router Advertisement.\n   o  MUST ignore all instances of the option
    except the first one\n      encountered in the Router Advertisement message.\n
    \  o  MUST ignore the option if the Length is less than 1.\n   o  MUST ignore
    any unknown flag bits.\n   The bit fields within the option are numbered from
    left to right,\n   from 8 to 55 (starting as bit offset 16 in the option) and
    follow the\n   numbering of the flag bits in the RA option described in Figure
    1.\n   Flag bits 0 to 7 are found in the Router Advertisement message header\n
    \  defined in [RFC4861].\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has defined a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery option
    for the option\n   defined in this document of the form:\n             +------+---------------------------+-----------+\n

    \  The registry for these options can be found at:\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters\n
    \  IANA has created a new registry for IPv6 ND Router Advertisement\n   flags.
    \ This should include the current flags in the RA option and in\n   the extension

    \  The assignment of new RA flags in the RA option header and the bits\n   defined
    in the RA extension option defined in this document require\n   standards action
    or IESG approval [RFC2434].\n"
