  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   There are three name spaces in RADIUS that require
    registration:\n   Packet Type Codes, Attribute Types, and Attribute Values (for
    certain\n   Attributes).  This document creates no new IANA registries, since
    a\n   RADIUS registry was created by [RFC2865].\n   RADIUS is not intended as
    a general-purpose protocol, and allocations\n   SHOULD NOT be made for purposes
    unrelated to Authentication,\n   Authorization or Accounting.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Recommended Registration Policies\n   For registration requests where
      a Designated Expert should be\n   consulted, the responsible IESG area director
      should appoint the\n   Designated Expert.  The intention is that any allocation
      will be\n   accompanied by a published RFC.  However, the Designated Expert
      can\n   approve allocations once it seems clear that an RFC will be\n   published,
      allowing for the allocation of values prior to the\n   document being approved
      for publication as an RFC.  The Designated\n   Expert will post a request to
      the AAA WG mailing list (or a successor\n   designated by the Area Director)
      for comment and review, including an\n   Internet-Draft.  Before a period of
      30 days has passed, the\n   Designated Expert will either approve or deny the
      registration\n   request, publish a notice of the decision to the AAA WG mailing
      list\n   or its successor, and inform IANA of its decision.  A denial notice\n
      \  must be justified by an explanation and, in the cases where it is\n   possible,
      concrete suggestions on how the request can be modified so\n   as to become
      acceptable.\n   Packet Type Codes have a range from 1 to 253.  RADIUS Type Codes
      1-5\n   and 11-13 were allocated in [RFC2865], while Type Codes 40-45,\n   250-253
      are allocated by this document.  Type Codes 250-253 are\n   allocated for Experimental
      Uses, and 254-255 are reserved.  Packet\n   Type Codes 6-10, 12-13, 21-34, 50-51
      have no meaning defined by an\n   IETF RFC, but are reserved until a specification
      is provided for\n   them.  This is being done to avoid interoperability problems
      with\n   software that implements non-standard RADIUS extensions that are or\n
      \  have been in use on the Internet.  Because a new Packet Type has\n   considerable
      impact on interoperability, a new Packet Type Code\n   requires IESG Approval.
      \ The intention is that any allocation will be\n   accompanied by a published
      RFC.  Type Codes 52-249 should be\n   allocated first; when these are exhausted,
      Type Codes 14-20, 35-39,\n   46-49 may be allocated.  For a list of Type Codes,
      see Appendix A.\n   Attribute Types have a range from 1 to 255, and are the
      scarcest\n   resource in RADIUS, thus must be allocated with care.  Attributes\n
      \  1-53,55,60-88,90-91,94-100 have been allocated, with 17 and 21\n   available
      for re-use.  Attributes 17, 21, 54, 56-59, 89, 101-191 may\n   be allocated
      by IETF Consensus.  It is recommended that attributes 17\n   and 21 be used
      only after all others are exhausted.\n   Note that RADIUS defines a mechanism
      for Vendor-Specific extensions\n   (Attribute 26) for functions specific only
      to one vendor's\n   implementation of RADIUS, where no interoperability is deemed
      useful.\n   For functions specific only to one vendor's implementation of RADIUS,\n
      \  the use of that should be encouraged instead of the allocation of\n   global
      attribute types.\n   As noted in [RFC2865]:\n      Attribute Type Values 192-223
      are reserved for experimental use,\n      values 224-240 are reserved for implementation-specific
      use, and\n      values 241-255 are reserved and should not be used.\n   Therefore
      Attribute Type values 192-240 are considered Private Use,\n   and values 241-255
      require Standards Action.\n   Certain attributes (for example, NAS-Port-Type)
      in RADIUS define a\n   list of values to correspond with various meanings.  There
      can be 4\n   billion (2^32) values for each attribute.  Additional values can
      be\n   allocated by the Designated Expert.  The exception to this policy is\n
      \  the Service-Type attribute (6), whose values define new modes of\n   operation
      for RADIUS.  Values 1-16 of the Service-Type attribute have\n   been allocated.
      \ Allocation of new Service-Type values are by IETF\n   Consensus.  The intention
      is that any allocation will be accompanied\n   by a published RFC.\n"
