  - "1.  INTRODUCTION\n   A working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ has\n   recently completed and published a monumental standards document on\n\
    \   software requirements for Internet hosts [RFC-1122, RFC-1123].  This\n   document\
    \ has been published as two RFC's: \"Requirements for Internet\n   Hosts -- Communication\
    \ Layers\", referred to here as \"HR-CL\", and\n   \"Requirements for Internet\
    \ Hosts -- Application and Support\",\n   referred to here as \"HR-AS\".  Together,\
    \ we refer to them as the Host\n   Requirements RFCs, or \"HR RFCs\".\n   Creation\
    \ of the Host Requirements document required the dedicated\n   efforts of about\
    \ 20 Internet experts, with significant contributions\n   from another 20.  The\
    \ Host Requirements working group held 7 formal\n   meetings over the past 20\
    \ months, and exchanged about 3 megabytes of\n   electronic mail.  The HR RFCs\
    \ went through approximate 20 distinct\n   drafts.\n   This group of people struggled\
    \ with a broad range of issues in host\n   implementations of the Internet protocols,\
    \ attempting to reconcile\n   theoretical and architectural concerns with the\
    \ sometimes conflicting\n   imperatives of the real world.  The present RFC recaps\
    \ the results of\n   this struggle, with the issues that were settled and those\
    \ that\n   remain for future work.  This exegesis has several goals:\n   (1) \
    \ to give the Internet technical community some insight into the\n        results\
    \ of the host requirements effort;\n   (2)  to inform the community of areas that\
    \ need further work; and\n   (3)  to preserve some history and context of the\
    \ effort as a starting\n        point for a future revision.\n"
- title: 1.1  GOALS OF THE HOST REQUIREMENTS RFCs
  contents:
  - "1.1  GOALS OF THE HOST REQUIREMENTS RFCs\n   The basic purpose of the Host Requirements\
    \ RFCs is to define the\n   requirements for Internet host software.  However,\
    \ the document goes\n   far beyond a simple prescription of requirements, to include:\n\
    \   (a)  a bibliography of the documents essential to an implementor;\n   (b)\
    \  corrections and updates to the original standards RFC's;\n   (c)  material\
    \ to fill gaps in the previous specifications;\n   (d)  limitations on implementation\
    \ choices, where appropriate;\n   (e)  clarification of important issues and the\
    \ intent of the\n        protocols; and\n   (f)  documentation of known solutions\
    \ to recurring problems as well\n        as implementation hints.\n   Broadly\
    \ speaking, the Host Requirements working group started from\n   the following\
    \ goals for Internet host software:\n   (1)  Interoperability\n   (2)  Extensibility\n\
    \   (3)  Functionality\n   (4)  Efficiency\n   (5)  Architectural Purity\n   Of\
    \ these, interoperability was clearly preeminent, while\n   architectural purity\
    \ had the lowest priority.  It is more difficult\n   to assign relative importance\
    \ to extensibility, functionality, and\n   efficiency, as it varied from one topic\
    \ to another.\n   At a more technical level, the working group pursued a set of\
    \ general\n   goals that included the following:\n   *    Discourage hosts from\
    \ unexpectedly acting as gateways.\n   *    Discourage the use of bad IP addresses.\n\
    \   *    Eliminate broadcast storms.\n   *    Discourage gratuitous Address Mask\
    \ Reply messages.\n   *    Facilitate the use IP Type-of-Service for routing and\
    \ queueing.\n   *    Encourage implementations of IP multicasting.\n   *    Encourage\
    \ TCP connection robustness.\n   *    Encourage (mandate!) implementation of known\
    \ TCP performance\n        enhancements.\n   *    Encourage user interfaces that\
    \ support the full capabilities of\n        the protocols.\n   *    Encourage\
    \ more complete implementations of FTP.\n   *    Encourage robust mail delivery\n\
    \   *    Discourage the source-routing of mail in the Internet.\n   *    Encourage\
    \ error logging.\n   In addition to these general technical goals, the working\
    \ group\n   decided to discourage the use of certain protocol features: e.g.,\
    \ the\n   IP Stream Id option, ICMP Information Request and Reply messages, the\n\
    \   RFC-795 TOS mappings, WKS records in the Domain Name System, and FTP\n   Page\
    \ structure.\n   The HR RFC tries to deal only with the software implementation,\
    \ not\n   with the way in which that software is configured and applied.  There\n\
    \   are a number of requirements on Internet hosts that were omitted from\n  \
    \ the HR RFC as administrative or configuration issues.\n   The HR RFCs contain\
    \ many, many detailed requirements and\n   clarifications that are straightforward\
    \ and (almost) non-\n   controversial.\n   Indeed, many of these are simply restatements\
    \ or reinforcement of\n   requirements that are already explicit or implicit in\
    \ the original\n   standards RFC's.  Some more cynical members of the working\
    \ group\n   refer to these as \"Read The Manual\" provisions.  However, they were\n\
    \   included in the HR RFCs because at least one implementation has\n   failed\
    \ to abide by these requirements.  In addition, many provisions\n   of the HR\
    \ RFCs are simply applications of Jon Postel's Robustness\n   Principle [1.2.2\
    \ in either RFC].\n   However, not all issues were so easy; the working group\
    \ struggled\n   with a number of deep and controversial technical issues.  Where\
    \ the\n   result was a reasonable consensus, then definite, firm\n   recommendations\
    \ and requirements resulted.  We list these settled\n   issues in Section 2. \
    \ Section 2 also lists a number of areas where\n   the HR RFCs fill gaping holes\
    \ in the current specifications by giving\n   extended discussions of particular\
    \ issues.\n   However, in some other cases the working group was unable to reach\
    \ a\n   crisp decision or even a reasonable consensus; we list these open\n  \
    \ issues in Section 3.  Future discussion is needed to ascertain which\n   of\
    \ these issues really do have \"right answers\", and which can\n   reasonably\
    \ be left as implementation choices.  Section 4 contains\n   some other areas\
    \ that the working group did not tackle but which need\n   further work outside\
    \ the context of the HR RFCs (although the outcome\n   may be reflected in a future\
    \ revision).  Finally, Appendix I lists\n   specific issues for consideration\
    \ by a future HR RFC revision effort,\n   while Appendix II lists the issues that\
    \ are relevant to a revision of\n   the Gateway Requirements RFC.\n   It should\
    \ be noted that this categorization of issues is imperfect; a\n   few issues appear\
    \ (legitimately) in more than one category.\n   For brevity, we do not attempt\
    \ to define all the terminology or\n   explain all the concepts mentioned here.\
    \  For those cases where\n   further clarification is needed, we include (in square\
    \ brackets)\n   references to the corresponding sections of the HR RFCs.\n"

    \        Discourage the use of source routes for delivering mail.  (This\n   \
    \     was one of the few cases where the working group opted for the\n       \

- title: 3.  OPEN ISSUES
  contents:
  - "3.  OPEN ISSUES\n   For some issues, the disagreement was so serious that the\
    \ working\n   group was unable to reach a consensus.  In each case, some spoke\
    \ for\n   MUST or SHOULD, while others spoke with equal fervor for MUST NOT or\n\
    \   SHOULD NOT.  As a result, the HR RFCs try to summarize the differing\n   viewpoints\
    \ but take no stand; the corresponding requirements are\n   given as MAY or OPTIONAL.\
    \  The most notorious of these contentious\n   issues are as follows.\n   -  \
    \  Hosts forwarding source-routed datagrams, even though the hosts\n        are\
    \ not otherwise acting as gateways   [CL 3.3.5]\n   -    The multihoming model\

    \   There was another set of controversial issues for which the HR RFCs\n   did\
    \ take a compromise stand, to allow the disputed functions but\n   circumscribe\
    \ their use.  In many of these cases, there were one or\n   more significant voices\
    \ for banning the feature altogether.\n   -    Host acting as gateways   [CL 3.1]\n\

- title: 4.  OTHER FUTURE WORK
  contents:
  - "4.  OTHER FUTURE WORK\n   General Issues:\n   (1)  Host Initialization Procedures\n\
    \      When a host system boots or otherwise initializes, it needs\n      certain\
    \ network configuration information in order to communicate;\n      e.g., its\
    \ own IP address(es) and address mask(s).  In the case of\n      a diskless workstation,\
    \ obtaining this information is an essential\n      part of the booting process.\n\
    \      The ICMP Address Mask messages and the RARP (Reverse ARP) protocol\n  \
    \    each provide individual pieces of configuration information.  The\n     \
    \ working group felt that such piecemeal solutions are a mistake,\n      and that\
    \ a comprehensive approach to initialization would result\n      in a uniform\
    \ mechanism to provide all the required configuration\n      information at once.\
    \  The HR working group recommends that a new\n      working group be established\
    \ to develop a unified approach to\n      system initialization.\n   (2)  Configuration\
    \ Options\n      Vendors, users, and network administrators all want host software\n\
    \      that is \"plug-and-play\".  Unfortunately, the working group was\n    \
    \  often forced to require additional configuration parameters to\n      satisfy\
    \ interoperability, functionality, and/or efficiency needs\n      [1.2.4 in either\
    \ RFC].  The working group was fully aware of the\n      drawbacks of configuration\
    \ parameters, but based upon extensive\n      experience with existing implementations,\
    \ it felt that the\n      flexibility was sometimes more important than installation\n\
    \      simplicity.\n      Some of the configuration parameters are forced for\n\
    \      interoperability with earlier, incorrect implementations.  Very\n     \
    \ little can be done to ease this problem, although retirement of\n      the offending\
    \ systems will gradually solve it.  However, it would\n      be desirable to re-examine\
    \ the other required configuration\n      options, in an attempt to develop ways\
    \ to eliminate some of them.\n   Link-Layer Issues:\n   (2)  ARP Cache Maintenance\n\
    \      \"Proxy ARP\" is a link-layer mechanism for IP routing, and its use\n \
    \     results in difficult problems in managing the ARP cache.\n      Even without\
    \ proxy ARP, the management dynamics of the IP route\n      cache interact in\
    \ subtle ways with transport-layer dynamics;\n      introducing routing via proxy\
    \ ARP brings a third protocol layer\n      into the problem, complicating the\
    \ inter-layer dynamics still\n      further.\n      The algorithms for maintaining\
    \ the ARP cache need to be studied\n      and experimented with, to create more\
    \ complete and explicit\n      algorithms and requirements.\n   (3)  FDDI Bit-order\
    \ in MAC addresses\n      On IEEE 802.3 or 802.4 LAN, the MAC address in the header\
    \ uses the\n      same bit-ordering as transmission of the address as data.  On\n\
    \      802.5 and FDDI networks, however, the MAC address in the header is\n  \
    \    in a different bit-ordering from the equivalent 6 bytes sent as\n      data.\
    \  This will make it hard to do MAC-level bridging between\n      FDDI and 802.3\
    \ LAN's, for example, although gateways (IP routers)\n      can still be used.\n\
    \      The working group concluded that this is a serious but subtle\n      problem\
    \ with no obvious fix, and that resolving it was beyond the\n      scope of the\
    \ HR working group.\n   IP-Layer Issues\n   (4)  Dead Gateway Detection\n    \
    \  A fundamental requirement for a host is to be able to detect when\n      the\
    \ first-hop gateway has failed.  The early TCP/IP\n      experimentation was based\
    \ on the ARPANET, which provided explicit\n      notification of gateway failure;\
    \ as a result, dead gateway\n      detection algorithms were not much considered\
    \ at that time.  The\n      very general guidelines presented by Dave Clark [RFC-816]\
    \ are\n      inadequate for implementors.  The first attempt at applying these\n\
    \      guidelines was the introduction of universal gateway pinging by\n     \
    \ TOPS-20 systems; this quickly proved to be a major generator of\n      ARPANET\
    \ traffic, and was squelched.  The most widely used\n      implementation of the\
    \ Internet protocols, 4.2BSD, solved the\n      problem in an extra-architectural\
    \ manner, by letting the host\n      wiretap the gateway routing protocol (RIP).\
    \  As a result of this\n      history, the HR working group was faced with an\
    \ absence of\n      documentated techniques that a host conforming to the Internet\n\
    \      architecture could use to detect dead gateways.\n      After extensive\
    \ discussion, the working group agreed on the\n      outline of an appropriate\
    \ algorithm.  A detailed algorithm was in\n      fact written down, to validate\
    \ the discussion in the HR RFCs.\n      This algorithm, or a better one, should\
    \ be tried experimentally\n      and documented in a new RFC.\n   (5)  Gateway\
    \ Discovery\n      A host needs to discover the IP addresses of gateways on its\n\
    \      connected networks.  One approach, begun but not finished by\n      members\
    \ of the HR working group, would be to define a new pair of\n      ICMP query\
    \ messages for gateway discovery.  In the future, gateway\n      discovery should\
    \ be considered as part of the complete host\n      initialization problem.\n\
    \   (6)  MTU Discovery\n      Members of the HR working group designed IP options\
    \ that a host\n      could use to discover the minimum MTU of a particular Internet\n\
    \      path [RFC-1063].  To be useful, the Probe MTU options would have\n    \
    \  to be implemented in all gateways, which is an obstacle to its\n      adoption.\
    \  Code written to use these options has never been\n      tested.  This work\
    \ should be carried forward; an effective MTU\n      choice will become increasingly\
    \ important for efficient Internet\n      service.\n   (7)  Routing Advice from\
    \ Gateways\n      A working group member produced a draft specification for ICMP\n\
    \      messages a host could use to ask gateways for routing advice\n      [Lekashman].\
    \  While this is not of such pressing importance as the\n      issues listed previously,\
    \ it deserves further consideration and\n      perhaps experimentation.\n   (8)\
    \  Dynamic TTL Discovery\n      Serious connectivity problems have resulted from\
    \ host software\n      that has too small a TTL value built into the code.  HR-CL\n\
    \      specifies that TTL values must be configurable, to allow TTL to be\n  \
    \    increased if required for communication in a future Internet;\n      conformance\
    \ with this requirement would solve the current\n      problems.  However, configurable\
    \ parameters are an operational\n      headache, so it has been suggested that\
    \ a host could have an\n      algorithm to determine the TTL (\"Internet diameter\"\
    ) dynamically.\n      Several algorithms have been suggested, but considerably\
    \ more work\n      would be required to validate them.  This is a lower-priority\n\
    \      problem than issues (4)-(6).\n   (9)  Dynamic Discovery of Reassembly Timeout\
    \ Time\n      The maximum time for retaining a partially-reassembled datagram\
    \ is\n      another parameter that creates a potential operational headache.\n\
    \      An appropriate reassembly timeout value must balance available\n      reassembly\
    \ buffer space against reliable reassembly.  The best\n      value thus may depend\
    \ upon the system and upon subtle delay\n      properties (delay dispersion) of\
    \ the Internet.  Again, dynamic\n      discovery could be desirable.\n   (10)\
    \ Type-of-Service Routing in Hosts\n      As pointed out previously, the HR RFCs\
    \ contain a number of\n      provisions designed to make Type-of-Service (TOS)\
    \ useful.  This\n      includes the suggestion that the route cache should have\
    \ a place\n      or specifying the TOS of a particular route.  However, host\n\
    \      algorithms for using TOS specifications need to be developed and\n    \
    \  documented.\n   (11) Using Subnets\n      An RFC is needed to provide a thorough\
    \ explanation of the\n      implications of subnetting for Internet protocols\
    \ and for network\n      administration.\n   Transport-Layer Issues:\n   (12)\
    \ RST Message\n      It has been proposed that TCP RST (Reset) segments can contain\n\
    \      text to provide an explicit explanation of the reason for the\n      particular\
    \ RST.  A proposal has been drafted [CLynn].\n   (13) Performance Algorithms\n\
    \      HR-CL contains a number of requirements on TCP performance\n      algorithms;\
    \ Van Jacobson's slow start and congestion avoidance,\n      Karn's algorithm,\
    \ Nagle's algorithm, and SWS prevention at the\n      sender and receiver.  Implementors\
    \ of new TCPs really need more\n      guidance than could possibly be included\
    \ in the HR RFCs.  The\n      working group suggested that an RFC on TCP performance\
    \ is needed,\n      to describe each of these issues more deeply and especially\
    \ to\n      explain how they fit together.\n      Another issue raised by the\
    \ HR RFCs is the need for validation (or\n      rejection) of Van Jacobson's fast\
    \ retransmit algorithm.\n   Application-Layer Issues:\n   (14) Proposed FTP extensions\n\
    \      A number of minor extensions proposed for FTP should be processed\n   \
    \   and accepted or rejected.  We are aware of the following\n      proposals:\n\
    \      (a)  Atomic Store Command\n         The FTP specification leaves undefined\
    \ the disposition of a\n         partial file created when an FTP session fails\
    \ during a store\n         operation.  It was suggested that this ambiguity could\
    \ be\n         resolved by defining a new store command, Store Atomic (STOA).\n\
    \         The receiver would delete the partial file if the transfer\n       \
    \  failed before the final data-complete reply had been sent.\n         This assumes\
    \ the use of a transfer mode (e.g., block) in which\n         end-of-file can\
    \ be distinguished from TCP connection failure,\n         of course.\n      (b)\
    \  NDIR Command\n         \"NDIR would be a directories-only analogue to the NLST\
    \ command.\n         Upon receiving an NDIR command an FTP server would return\
    \ a\n         list of the subdirectories to the specified directory or file\n\
    \         group; or of the current directory if no argument was sent.\n      \
    \   ... The existing NLST command allows user FTPs to implement\n         user-interface\
    \ niceties such as a \"multiple get\" command.  It\n         also allows a selective\
    \ (as opposed to generative) file-naming\n         user interface: the user can\
    \ pick the desired file out of a\n         list instead of typing its name.\"\
    \ [Matthews]\n         However, the interface needs to distinguish files from\n\
    \         directories.  Up to now, such interfaces have relied on a bug\n    \
    \     in many FTP servers, which have included directory names in the\n      \
    \   list returned by NLST.  As hosts come into conformance with\n         HR-AS,\
    \ we need an NDIR command to return directory names.\n      (c)  Adaptive Compression\n\
    \         It has been suggested that a sophisticated adaptive data\n         compression\
    \ algorithm, like that provided by the Unix\n         \"compress\" command, should\
    \ be added as an alternative FTP\n         transfer mode.\n   (15) SMTP: Global\
    \ Mail Addressing\n      While writing requirements for electronic mail, the working\
    \ group\n      was urged to set rules for SMTP and RFC-822 that would be\n   \
    \   universal, applicable not only to the Internet environment but\n      also\
    \ to the other mail environments that use one or both of these\n      protocols.\
    \  The working group chose to ignore this Siren call, and\n      instead limit\
    \ the HR RFC to requirements specific to the Internet.\n      However, the networking\
    \ world would certainly benefit from some\n      global agreements on mail routing.\
    \  Strong passions are lurking\n      here.\n   (16) DNS: Fully Replacing hosts.txt\n\
    \      As noted in HR-AS [AS 6.1.3.8], the DNS does not yet incorporate\n    \
    \  all the potentially-useful information included in the DDN NIC's\n      hosts.txt\
    \ file.  The DNS should be expanded to cover the hosts.txt\n      information.\
    \  RFC-1101 [RFC-1101] is a step in the right\n      direction, but more work\
    \ is needed.\n"

- title: APPENDIX I -- ISSUES FOR FUTURE REVISION
  contents:
  - "APPENDIX I -- ISSUES FOR FUTURE REVISION\n   In order to complete the HR RFCs,\
    \ it was necessary to defer some\n   technical issues.  These issues should be\
    \ considered by the parties\n   responsible for the first update of the HR RFCs.\n\
    \   The issues pending at the time of publication are listed here, in\n   order\
    \ by protocol layer.\n   General Issue:\n      Error Logging\n      The working\
    \ group felt that more complete and explicit guidance on\n      error logging\
    \ procedures is needed than is presently contained in\n      Section 1.2.3 (both\
    \ HR RFCs).\n   Link Layer Issues:\n   -    Stolen IP Address\n      How should\
    \ a host react when it detects through ARP traffic that\n      some other host\
    \ has \"stolen\" its IP address?\n   IP Layer Issues:\n   -    \"Raw Mode\" Interface\n\
    \      HR-CL could define an optional \"raw mode\" interface from the\n      application\
    \ layer to IP.\n   -    Rational Fragmentation\n      When a host performs intentional\
    \ fragmentation, it should make the\n      first fragment as large as possible\
    \ (this same requirement should\n      be placed on gateways).\n   -    Interaction\
    \ of Multiple Options\n      HR-CL does not give specific rules for the interactions\
    \ of\n      multiple options in the same IP header; this issue was generally\n\
    \      deferred to a revision of the Gateway Requirements RFC.  However,\n   \
    \   this issue might be revisited for hosts.\n   -    ICMP Error for Source-Routed\
    \ Packet\n      It was suggested that when a source-routed packet arrives with\
    \ an\n      error, any ICMP error message should be sent with the\n      corresponding\
    \ return route.  This assumes that the ICMP error\n      message is more likely\
    \ to be delivered successfully with the\n      source route than without it.\n\
    \   -    \"Strong\" IP Options and ICMP Types\n      The HR RFCs takes the general\
    \ approach that a host should ignore\n      whatever it does not understand, so\
    \ that possible future\n      extensions -- e.g., new IP options or new ICMP message\
    \ types --\n      will cause minimum problems for existing hosts.  The result\
    \ of\n      this approach is that when new facilities are used with old hosts,\n\
    \      a \"black hole\" can result.  Several people have suggested that\n    \
    \  this is not always what is wanted; it may sometimes be more useful\n      to\
    \ obtain an ICMP error message from the old host.  To quote\n      Jeremey Siegel:\n\
    \         \"The basic premise is that if an option is to have any real\n     \
    \    meaning at all within an '[upward] compatible' environment, it\n        \
    \ must be known whether or not the option actually *carries* its\n         meaning.\
    \  An absurd analogy might be programming languages: I\n         could make a\
    \ compiler which simply ignored unknown sorts of\n         statements, thereby\
    \ allowing for future expansion of the\n         language.\n         Right now,\
    \ there are four \"classes\" of options; only two are\n         defined.  Take\
    \ one of the other classes, and define it such\n         that any options in that\
    \ class, if unrecognized, cause an ICMP\n         error message.  Thus anyone\
    \ who wants to propose a \"strong\"\n         option (one which requires full\
    \ participation by all systems\n         involved to operate correctly) can assign\
    \ it to that class.\n         Options in the current classes may still be passed\
    \ through if\n         they are unknown; only \"weak\" options will be assigned\
    \ to these\n         classes in the future.\"\n   -    Network Mask\n      As\
    \ explained in HR-CL [CL 3.1.2.3], we believe that a possible\n      future transition\
    \ for the interpretation of IP addresses may be\n      eased if hosts always treat\
    \ an IP address as an indivisible 32-\n      bit number.  However, there are various\
    \ circumstances where a host\n      has to distinguish its own network number.\
    \  Charlie Lynn has\n      suggested that indivisibility can be retained if a\
    \ host is\n      configured with both an address mask (indicating subnetting)\
    \ and a\n      network mask (with network but not subnet bits).\n   -    WhoAmI\
    \ Query\n      The following requirement is needed: for a multihomed host, a\n\
    \      UDP-based application should (must?) be able to query the\n      communication\
    \ layers to obtain a list of all local IP addresses\n      for the host.\n   -\
    \    New Destination Unreachable codes\n      For each of the new ICMP Destination\
    \ Unreachable codes defined in\n      HR-CL [CL 3.2.2.1], it should be documented\
    \ whether the error is\n      \"soft\" or \"hard\".\n   -    ICMP Error Schizophrenia\n\
    \      Section 3.3.8 of HR-CL requires a host to send ICMP error\n      messages,\
    \ yet in nearly all individual cases the specific\n      requirements say that\
    \ errors are to be silently ignored.  The\n      working group recognized this\
    \ contradiction but was unwilling to\n      resolve it.\n      At every choice\
    \ point, the working group opted towards a\n      requirement that would avoid\
    \ broadcast storms.  For example, (1)\n      ICMP errors cannot be sent for broadcasts,\
    \ and also (2) individual\n      errors are to be silently ignored.  This is redundant;\
    \ either\n      provision (1) or (2) alone, if followed, should eliminate\n  \
    \    broadcast storms.  The general area of responses to errors and\n      broadcast\
    \ storms could be reassessed and the individual decisions\n      reviewed.\n \
    \  Transport-Layer Requirements:\n   -    Delayed ACK Definition\n      A more\
    \ precise and complete definition of the conditions for\n      delaying a TCP\
    \ ACK segment may be desirable; see Section 4.2.3.2\n      of HR-CL.\n   Telnet\
    \ Requirements:\n   -    Flushing Output\n      The DISCUSSION in Section 3.2.4\
    \ of HR-AS concerns three possible\n      ways for a User Telnet to flush output.\
    \  It would be helpful for\n      users and implementers if one of these could\
    \ be recommended over\n      the others; however, when the working group discussed\
    \ the matter,\n      there seemed to be compelling arguments for each choice.\
    \  This\n      issue needs more study.\n   -    Telnet LineMode Option\n     \
    \ This important new option is still experimental, but when it\n      becomes\
    \ a standard, implementation should become recommended or\n      required.\n \
    \  FTP Requirements:\n   -    Reply Codes\n   A number of problems have been raised\
    \ with FTP reply codes.\n   (a)  Access Control Failures\n      Note that a 550\
    \ message is used to indicate access control\n      problems for a read-type operation\
    \ (e.g., RETR, RNFR), while a 553\n      message is used for the same purpose\
    \ for a write-type operation\n      (e.g., STOR, STOU, RNTO).\n      LIST, NLST,\
    \ and STAT may fail with a 550 reply due to an access\n      control violation.\n\
    \      MKD should fail with a 553 reply if a directory already exists\n      with\
    \ the same name.\n   (b)  Directory Operations (RFC-959 Appendix II)\n      An\
    \ RMD may result in a 450 reply if the directory is busy.\n      Many of the reply\
    \ codes shown in the text of Appendix II are\n      wrong.  A positive completion\
    \ for CWD should be 250.  The 521 code\n      shown for MKD should be 553 (see\
    \ above), while the 431 shown for\n      CWD should be a 550.\n   (c)  HELP and\
    \ SITE Commands\n      The positive completion reply to a HELP command should\
    \ be code\n      214.\n      HELP or SITE with an invalid argument should return\
    \ a 504 reply.\n   -    Bidirectional FTP\n      The FTP specification allows\
    \ an implementation in which data\n      transfer takes place in both directions\
    \ simultaneously, although\n      few if any implementations support this.  Perhaps\
    \ HR-AS should\n      take a stand for or against this.\n   SMTP Requirements:\n\
    \   -    Offline SEND\n      Some on the working group felt that the SMTP SEND\
    \ command,\n      intended to display a message immediately on the recipient's\n\
    \      terminal, should produce an error message if delivery must be\n      deferred.\n\
    \   -    Header-like Fields\n   John Klensin proposed:\n      \"Header-like fields\
    \ whose keywords do not conform to RFC822 are\n      strongly discouraged; gateways\
    \ SHOULD filter them out or place\n      them into the message body.  If, however,\
    \ they are not removed,\n      Internet hosts not acting as gateways SHOULD NOT\
    \ utilize or\n      inspect them.  Hence address-like subfields of those fields\
    \ SHOULD\n      NOT be altered by the gateway.\"\n   -    Syntax of Received:\
    \ Line\n      The precise syntax of a revised Received: line (see Section 5.2.8\n\
    \      of HR-AS) could be given.  An unresolved question concerned the\n     \
    \ use of \"localhost\" rather than a fully-qualified domain name in\n      the\
    \ FROM field of a Received: line.  Finally, new syntax was\n      proposed for\
    \ the Message Id field.\n"

    \  The GR RFC should take a stand on whether or\n      not gateways ought to implement\
    \ the necessary routing.\n   -    Rational Fragmentation\n      When a gateway\
    \ performs intentional fragmentation, it should make\n      the first fragment\
    \ as large as possible.\n   -    Illegal Source Address\n      It has been suggested\
