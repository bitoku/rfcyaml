- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Point-to-point and broadcast are the two predominant circuit\
    \ types\n   used by link state routing protocols such as IS-IS [ISO10589]\n  \
    \ [RFC1195] and OSPF [RFC2328] [RFC5340].  They are treated differently\n   with\
    \ respect to establishing neighbor adjacencies, flooding link\n   state information,\
    \ representing the topology, and calculating the\n   Shortest Path First (SPF)\
    \ and protocol packets.  The most important\n   differences are that broadcast\
    \ circuits utilize the concept of a\n   designated router and are represented\
    \ topologically as virtual nodes\n   in the network topology graph.\n   Compared\
    \ with broadcast circuits, point-to-point circuits afford more\n   straightforward\
    \ IGP operation.  There is no designated router\n   involved, and there is no\
    \ representation of the pseudonode or network\n   Link State Advertisement (LSA)\
    \ in the link state database.  For IS-\n   IS, there also is no periodic database\
    \ synchronization.  Conversely,\n   if there are more than two routers on the\
    \ LAN media, the traditional\n   view of the broadcast circuit will reduce the\
    \ routing information in\n   the network.\n   When there are only two routers\
    \ on the LAN, it makes more sense to\n   treat the connection between the two\
    \ routers as a point-to-point\n   circuit.  This document describes the mechanism\
    \ to allow link state\n   routing protocols to operate using point-to-point connections\
    \ over a\n   LAN under this condition.  Some implications related to forwarding\
    \ IP\n   packets on this type of circuit are also discussed.  We will refer to\n\
    \   this as a p2p-over-lan circuit in this document.\n"

- title: 2.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "2.  Motivation\n   Even though a broadcast circuit is meant to handle more than\
    \ two\n   devices, there are cases where only two routers are connected over\n\
    \   either the physical or logical LAN segment:\n      1. The media itself is\
    \ being used for point-to-point operation\n         between two routers.  This\
    \ is mainly for long-haul operation.\n      2. There are only two routers on the\
    \ physical LAN.\n      3. There are only two routers on a virtual LAN (vLAN).\n\
    \   In any of the above cases, the link state routing protocols will\n   normally\
    \ still treat the media as a broadcast circuit.  Hence, they\n   will have the\
    \ overhead involved with protocol LAN operation without\n   the benefits of reducing\
    \ routing information and optimized flooding.\n   Being able to treat a LAN as\
    \ a point-to-point circuit provides the\n   benefit of reduction in the amount\
    \ of information routing protocols\n   must carry and manage.  DR/DIS (Designated\
    \ Router / Designated\n   Intermediate System) election can be omitted.  Flooding\
    \ can be done\n   as in p2p links without the need for using \"LSA reflection\"\
    \ by the DR\n   in OSPF or periodic Complete Sequence Number Packets (CSNPs) in\
    \ IS-\n   IS.\n   Also, if a broadcast segment wired as a point-to-point link\
    \ can be\n   treated as a point-to-point link, only the connection between the\
    \ two\n   routers would need to be advertised as a topological entity.\n   Even\
    \ when there are multiple routers on the LAN, an ISP may want to\n   sub-group\
    \ the routers into multiple vLANs, since this allows them to\n   assign different\
    \ costs to IGP neighbors.  When there are only two\n   routers in some of the\
    \ vLANs, this LAN can be viewed by the IGP as a\n   mesh of point-to-point connections.\n\
    \   The IP unnumbered configuration is widely used in networks.  It\n   enables\
    \ IP processing on a point-to-point interface without an\n   explicit IP address.\
    \  The IP unnumbered interface can \"borrow\" the IP\n   address of another interface\
    \ on the node.  The advantages of\n   unnumbered point-to-point links are obvious\
    \ in the current IP\n   addressing environment where addresses are a scarce resource.\
    \  The\n   unnumbered interface can also be applied over p2p-over-lan circuits.\n\
    \   Separating the concept of network type from media type will allow\n   LANs,\
    \ e.g., ethernet, to be unnumbered and realize the IP address\n   space savings.\
    \  Another advantage is in simpler network management\n   and configuration. \
    \ In the case of an IPv6 network, a link local\n   address used in IS-IS [RFC5308]\
    \ and OSPFv3 [RFC5340] serves the same\n   purpose.\n"
- title: 3.  IP Multi-Access Subnets
  contents:
  - "3.  IP Multi-Access Subnets\n   When an IP network includes multi-access segments,\
    \ each segment is\n   usually assigned a separate subnet, and each router connected\
    \ to it\n   is assigned a distinct IP address within that subnet.  The role of\n\
    \   the IP address assigned to a multi-access interface can be outlined\n   as\
    \ follows:\n      1. Source IP address - The interface address can be used by\
    \ the\n         router as the source IP address in locally originated IP\n   \
    \      packets that are destined for that subnet or have a best path\n       \
    \  next hop on that subnet.\n      2. Destination IP address - The interface address\
    \ can be used by\n         other devices in the network as a destination address\
    \ for\n         packets to router applications (examples include telnet, SMTP,\n\
    \         TFTP, OSPF, BGP, etc).\n      3. Next-hop identifier - If other routers\
    \ connected to the same\n         segment need to forward traffic through the\
    \ router, the\n         corresponding routes in their routing tables will include\
    \ the\n         router's interface IP address.  This address will be used to\n\
    \         find the router's MAC (Media Access Control) address using the\n   \
    \      ARP/ND (Address Resolution Protocol / Neighbor Discovery)\n         protocol.\
    \  Effectively, the interface IP addresses help other\n         routers find the\
    \ data-link layer details that are required to\n         specify the destination\
    \ of the encapsulating data-link frame\n         when it is sent on the segment.\n\
    \   The IP addressing scheme includes an option that allows the\n   administrators\
    \ to not assign any subnets to point-to-point links\n   (links connecting only\
    \ two devices and using protocols like PPP,\n   SLIP, or HDLC for IP encapsulation).\
    \  This is possible because the\n   routers do not need next-hop identifiers on\
    \ point-to-point links\n   (there is only one destination for any transmission),\
    \ and an\n   interface-independent IP address can be used as the source and\n\
    \   destination.  Using the unnumbered option for a point-to-point link\n   essentially\
    \ makes it a purely topological entity used only to reach\n   other destinations.\n"
- title: 4.  Point-to-Point Connection over LAN Media
  contents:
  - "4.  Point-to-Point Connection over LAN Media\n   The idea is very simple: provide\
    \ a configuration mechanism to inform\n   the IGP that the circuit is type point-to-point,\
    \ irrespective of the\n   physical media type.  For the IGP, this implies that\
    \ it will send\n   protocol packets with the appropriate point-to-point information,\
    \ and\n   it expects to receive protocol packets as they would be received on\
    \ a\n   point-to-point circuit.  Over LAN media, the MAC header must contain\n\
    \   the correct multicast MAC address to be received by the other side of\n  \
    \ the connection.  For vLAN environments, the MAC header must also\n   contain\
    \ the proper vLAN ID.\n   In order to allow LAN links used to connect only two\
    \ routers to be\n   treated as unnumbered point-to-point interfaces, the MAC address\n\
    \   resolution and nexthop IP address issues need to be addressed.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Operation of IS-IS
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Operation of IS-IS\n   This p2p-over-lan circuit extension for IS-IS is\
    \ only concerned with\n   pure IP routing and forwarding operation.\n   Since\
    \ physically the circuit is a broadcast one, the IS-IS protocol\n   packets need\
    \ to have MAC addresses for this p2p-over-lan circuit.\n   From a link-layer point\
    \ of view, those packets are IS-IS LAN packets.\n   The Multi-destination address\
    \ including AllISs, AllL1ISs, and\n   AllL2ISs, defined in [ISO10589], can be\
    \ used for link-layer\n   encapsulation; the use of AllISs is recommended.\n \
    \  The circuit needs to have IP address(es), and the p2p IS-IS Hello\n   (IIH)\
    \ over this circuit MUST include the IP interface address(es) as\n   defined in\
    \ [RFC1195].  The IPv4 address(es) included in the IIHs is\n   either the IP address\
    \ assigned to the interface in the case of a\n   numbered interface or the interface-independent\
    \ IP address in the\n   case of an unnumbered interface.  The IPv6 addresses are\
    \ link-local\n   IPv6 address(es) [RFC5308].\n"
- title: 4.2.  Operation of OSPF and OSPFv3
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Operation of OSPF and OSPFv3\n   OSPF and OSPFv3 [RFC5340] routers supporting\
    \ the capabilities\n   described herein should support an additional interface\
    \ configuration\n   parameter specifying the interface topology type.  For a LAN\
    \ (i.e.,\n   broadcast-capable) interface, the interface may be viewed as a\n\
    \   point-to-point interface.  Both routers on the LAN will simply join\n   the\
    \ AllSPFRouters multicast group and send all OSPF packets with a\n   destination\
    \ address of AllSPFRouters.  AllSPFRouters is 224.0.0.5 for\n   OSPF and FF02::5\
    \ for OSPFv3.  This is identical to operation over a\n   physical point-to-point\
    \ link as described in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of\n   [RFC2328].\n"
- title: 4.3.  ARP and ND
  contents:
  - "4.3.  ARP and ND\n   Unlike a normal point-to-point IGP circuit, the IP nexthop\
    \ for the\n   routes using this p2p-over-lan circuit as an outbound interface\
    \ is\n   not optional.  The IP nexthop address has to be a valid interface or\n\
    \   internal address on the adjacent router.  This address is used by a\n   local\
    \ router to obtain the MAC address for IP packet forwarding.  The\n   ARP process\
    \ has to be able to resolve the internal IPv4 address used\n   for the unnumbered\
    \ p2p-over-lan circuits.  For the ARP implementation\n   (which checks that the\
    \ subnet of the source address of the ARP\n   request matches the local interface\
    \ address), this check needs to be\n   relaxed for the unnumbered p2p-over-lan\
    \ circuits.  The\n   misconfiguration detection is handled by the IGPs and is\
    \ described in\n   Section 4.5.  In the IPv6 case, the ND resolves the MAC for\
    \ the\n   link-local address on the p2p-over-lan circuit, which is part of the\n\
    \   IPv6 neighbor discovery process [RFC4861].\n"
- title: 4.4.  Other MAC Address Resolution Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Other MAC Address Resolution Mechanisms\n   In more general cases, while\
    \ p2p-over-lan circuit is used as an\n   unnumbered link, other MAC address resolution\
    \ mechanisms are needed\n   for IP packet forwarding; for example, if link state\
    \ IGP is not\n   configured over this p2p-over-lan link, or if the mechanism described\n\
    \   in Section 4.3 is not possible.  The following techniques can be used\n  \
    \ to acquire the MAC address and/or the next-hop IP address of the\n   remote\
    \ device on an unnumbered point-to-point LAN link.\n      1. Static configuration.\
    \  A router can be statically configured\n         with the MAC address that should\
    \ be used as the destination MAC\n         address when sending data out of the\
    \ interface.\n      2. MAC address gleaning.  If a dynamic routing protocol is\
    \ running\n         between the routers connected to the link, the MAC address\
    \ of\n         the remote device can be taken from a data-link frame carrying\n\
    \         a packet of the corresponding routing protocol.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Detection of Misconfiguration
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Detection of Misconfiguration\n   With this p2p-over-lan extension, the\
    \ difference between a LAN and a\n   point-to-point circuit can be made purely\
    \ by configuration.  It is\n   important to implement the mechanisms for early\
    \ detection of\n   misconfiguration.\n   If the circuit is configured as the point-to-point\
    \ type and receives\n   LAN hello packets, the router MUST discard the incoming\
    \ packets; if\n   the circuit is a LAN type and receives point-to-point hello\
    \ packets,\n   it MUST discard the incoming packets.  If the system ID or the\
    \ router\n   ID of an incoming hello packet does not match the system ID or the\n\
    \   router ID for an established adjacency over a p2p-over-lan circuit,\n   the\
    \ packet MUST be discarded.  Furthermore, if OSPF hello suppression\n   (as described\
    \ in [RFC1793]) is active for the adjacency, the hello\n   suppression MUST be\
    \ terminated for a period of RouterIntervalSeconds.\n   After this interval, either\
    \ the neighbor adjacency will time out and\n   an adjacency may be formed with\
    \ a neighbor with a different router\n   ID, or hello suppression may be renegotiated.\
    \  The implementation\n   should offer logging and debugging information of the\
    \ above events.\n"
- title: 5.  Compatibility Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Compatibility Considerations\n   Both routers on a LAN must support the p2p-over-lan\
    \ extension and\n   both must have the LAN segment configured as a p2p-over-lan\
    \ circuit\n   for successful operation.  Both routers SHOULD support at least\
    \ one\n   of the above listed methods for mapping IP addresses on the link to\n\
    \   MAC address.  If a proprietary method of IP address to MAC address\n   resolution\
    \ is used by one router, both routers must be capable of\n   using the same method.\
    \  Otherwise, the link should be configured as a\n   standard LAN link, with traditional\
    \ IGP LAN models used.\n"
- title: 6.  Scalability and Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Scalability and Deployment Considerations\n   While there is advantage to\
    \ using this extension on the LANs that are\n   connected back to back or only\
    \ contain two routers, there are trade\n   offs when modeling a LAN as multiple\
    \ vLANs and using this extension\n   since one does sacrifice the inherent scalability\
    \ benefits of multi-\n   access networks.  In general, it will increase the link\
    \ state\n   database size, the amount of packets flooded, and the route\n   calculation\
    \ overhead.\n   Deployment of the described technique brings noticeable benefits\
    \ from\n   the perspective of IP address usage: the network management and the\n\
    \   router configuration.  Note, however, that use of the IP unnumbered\n   option\
    \ for point-to-point LAN links inherits the same problems as\n   those present\
    \ for serial links, i.e., not being able to ping or\n   monitor a specific interface\
    \ between routers.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce any new security\
    \ issues to IS-IS,\n   OSPF, ARP, or ND.  Implementations may have 'source address\
    \ subnet\n   checks' that need to be relaxed as described in Section 4.3.  These\n\
    \   are used to manage misconfigurations, not so much to secure ARP -- if\n  \
    \ an attacker would be attached to the LAN, (s)he could pick a subnet-\n   wise\
    \ correct address as well.\n   If one router on a link thinks that a LAN should\
    \ be either broadcast\n   or p2p-over-lan, and the other router has a different\
    \ opinion, the\n   adjacencies will never form, as specified in Section 4.5. \
    \ There are\n   no fallbacks at either end to resolve the situation, except by\
    \ a\n   manual configuration change.\n"
