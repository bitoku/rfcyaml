- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Profiles, as defined by [RFC6906], can be used to signal\
    \ support for\n   additional semantics, such as constraints, conventions, extensions,\n\
    \   or any other aspects that do not alter the basic media type\n   semantics.\
    \  Profiles are identified by a URI and can thus be created\n   without central\
    \ coordination.\n   Similar to media types and link relation types, it is, in\
    \ some cases,\n   beneficial to centrally manage profile URIs to ensure\n   interoperability\
    \ and decrease the coupling between clients and\n   servers.  This allows the\
    \ independent evolution of clients and\n   servers as both are coupled to these\
    \ central contracts instead of\n   being coupled to each other.  Therefore, this\
    \ document establishes an\n   IANA registry for profile URIs.\n"
- title: 2.  Registration Process
  contents:
  - "2.  Registration Process\n   All elements in this registry require a URI in order\
    \ to be\n   registered.  The meaning of the profile URI should be documented in\
    \ a\n   permanent and readily available public specification in sufficient\n \
    \  detail so that interoperability between independent implementations\n   is\
    \ possible (see the registration template in Section 4).\n   An example registration\
    \ request can be found in Section 3.\n"
- title: 3.  Example Registration Request
  contents:
  - "3.  Example Registration Request\n   The following is an example registration\
    \ request for the profile URI\n   http://example.com/profiles/example.\n   This\
    \ is a request to IANA to please register the profile URI\n   \"http://example.com/profiles/example\"\
    \ in the \"Profile URIs\" registry\n   according [RFC7284].\n   o  Profile URI:\
    \ http://example.com/profiles/example\n   o  Common Name: My Profile\n   o  Description:\
    \ An exemplary profile URI registration.\n   o  Reference: [the relevant specification]\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document establishes the \"Profile URIs\" registry.\
    \  The\n   registration procedure for new entries requires a request in the form\n\
    \   of the following template and is \"First Come First Served\" per\n   [RFC5226].\
    \  Instructions for a registrant to request the registration\n   of a profile\
    \ URI are in Section 2.\n   The underlying registry data (e.g., the XML file)\
    \ must include\n   Simplified BSD License text as described in Section 4.e of\
    \ the Trust\n   Legal Provisions [TRUST].\n   The registration template is:\n\
    \   o  Profile URI: The URI that identifies the registered profile.\n   o  Common\
    \ Name: The name by which the profile being registered is\n      generally known.\n\
    \   o  Description: A relatively short description of the profile.  For\n    \
    \  simple profiles, this might be all the documentation that is\n      required\
    \ and there might be no reference document.  In those\n      cases, be sure this\
    \ description adequately documents the profile\n      and is suitable for interoperable\
    \ implementation.\n   o  Reference: Reference to the document that specifies the\
    \ URI,\n      preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a copy of\n\
    \      the document.  An indication of the relevant sections may also be\n   \
    \   included.  This is recommended but can be left blank if the\n      \"Description\"\
    \ field provides sufficient documentation.\n   o  Notes: [optional]\n"
