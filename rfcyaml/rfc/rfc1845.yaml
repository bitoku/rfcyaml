  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Although SMTP is widely and robustly deployed, various extensions\n\
    \   have been requested by parts of the Internet community. In\n   particular,\
    \ when dealing with very large messages over less reliable\n   connections it\
    \ is possible for substantial resources to be consumed\n   by repeated unsuccessful\
    \ attempts to transmit the message in its\n   entirety. The original SMTP specification\
    \ [1] does not provide any\n   means to pick up a partially completed transaction\
    \ after the\n   underlying TCP connection has been broken and reestablished.\n\
    \   This memo provides a facility by which a client can uniquely identify\n  \
    \ a particular SMTP transaction. The server then stores this\n   identifying information\
    \ along with all the information it receives as\n   the transaction proceeds.\
    \ If the transaction is interrupted during\n   the data transfer phase the SMTP\
    \ client may establish a new SMTP\n   session at a later time and ask the server\
    \ to continue the\n   transaction from the point where the server lost its connection\
    \ with\n   the client. The server then reestablishes the transaction context and\n\
    \   tells the client where to resume operations. If this is acceptable\n   the\
    \ client resumes operations at this point.\n   This extension may also be used\
    \ to work around the common timeout\n   problem where a client times out waiting\
    \ for a response from the\n   server acknowledging that the message has been accepted.\
    \ However, use\n   of this extension is not an acceptable substitute for proper\
    \ setting\n   of timeout parameters.\n"
- title: 2.  Framework for the Checkpointing Extension
  contents:
  - "2.  Framework for the Checkpointing Extension\n   The checkpointing extension\
    \ is laid out as follows:\n (1)   the name of the SMTP service extension defined\
    \ here is\n       checkpointing;\n (2)   the EHLO keyword value associated with\
    \ the extension is\n       CHECKPOINT;\n (3)   no parameter is used with the CHECKPOINT\
    \ EHLO keyword;\n (4)   one optional parameter using the keyword TRANSID is\n\
    \       added to the MAIL FROM command.  The value associated\n       with this\
    \ parameter, coupled with the name of the\n       client taken from EHLO command,\
    \ forms a globally unique\n       value that identifies this particular transaction\
    \ and\n       serves to distinguish it from all others. This value is\n      \
    \ case-sensitive. The syntax of the value is as follows,\n       using the ABNF\
    \ notation of [2]:\n            transid-value  ::= \"<\" transid-spec \">\"\n\
    \                               ; transid-value may not be longer than\n     \
    \                          ; 80 characters\n            transid-spec   ::= transid-local\
    \ \"@\" transid-domain\n            transid-domain ::= transid-token\n       \
    \     transid-local  ::= transid-token\n            transid-token  ::= transid-atom\
    \ *(\".\" transid-atom)\n            transid-atom   ::= 1*<any (ASCII) CHAR except\
    \ SPACE,\n                                  CTLs, tspecials, or \".\">\n     \
    \  NOTE: tspecials is defined in [3]. The TRANSID is\n       likely to be different\
    \ from the RFC822 message id,\n       since it must uniquely identify the particular\
    \ copy of\n       the message being sent over this SMTP link. However,\n     \
    \  the syntax of transid-value is designed so that any\n       TRANSID is both\
    \ a legal RFC822 msg-id as well as being\n       a legal esmtp-value [4].\n (5)\
    \   The maximum length of a MAIL FROM command line is\n       increased by 88\
    \ characters by the possible addition of\n       the TRANSID keyword and value;\n\
    \ (6)   no additional SMTP verbs are defined by this extension;\n       and,\n\
    \ (7)   the next section specifies how support for the\n       extension affects\
    \ the behavior of a server and client\n       SMTP.\n"
- title: 3.  The checkpointing service extension
  contents:
  - "3.  The checkpointing service extension\n   When a client SMTP wishes to use\
    \ checkpointing to eliminate the need\n   to retransmit all message data in its\
    \ entirety in the event of a\n   session interruption, it first issues the EHLO\
    \ command to the server\n   SMTP. If the server SMTP responds with code 250 to\
    \ the EHLO command,\n   and the response includes the EHLO keyword value CHECKPOINT,\
    \ then the\n   server SMTP is indicating that it supports SMTP checkpointing and\n\
    \   will honor requests to restart interrupted SMTP transactions.\n   The extended\
    \ MAIL command is issued by a client SMTP when it wishes\n   to enable server\
    \ checkpointing. The syntax for this command is\n   identical to the MAIL command\
    \ in [1], except that a TRANSID parameter\n   must appear after the address.\n\
    \   The complete syntax of this extended command is defined in [4], with\n   the\
    \ esmtp-keyword TRANSID and transid-value parameter as previously\n   defined.\n\
    \   The value associated with the TRANSID parameter must be an identifier\n  \
    \ that serves to uniquely identify this particular SMTP transaction.\n   Only\
    \ one TRANSID parameter may be used in a single MAIL command. Care\n   must be\
    \ used in constructing TRANSID values to simultaneously insure\n   both uniqueness\
    \ and the ability to reidentify interrupted\n   transactions.\n   The TRANSID\
    \ is structured to ensure globally uniqueness without any\n   additional registry.\
    \ The transid-domain part should be a valid domain\n   name that uniquely identifies\
    \ the SMTP client. Note that this is\n   usually the same as the domain name given\
    \ in conjunction with the\n   EHLO command, but not always. The EHLO domain name\
    \ identifies the\n   specific host the SMTP connection originated from, whereas\
    \ the\n   transid-domain may refer to a group of hosts that collectively host\
    \ a\n   multi-homed SMTP client. The transid-local part should be an\n   identifier\
    \ that distinguishes this SMTP transaction from any other\n   originating from\
    \ this SMTP client.\n   Despite the structured nature of the TRANSID the server\
    \ should treat\n   the value as an opaque, case-sensitive string.\n   Note that\
    \ the contents of the RFC822 message-id header typically are\n   NOT appropriate\
    \ for use as the TRANSID parameter value, since such\n   identifiers may be associated\
    \ with multiple copies of the same\n   message -- e.g., as it is split during\
    \ transmission down different\n   network paths -- and hence with multiple distinct\
    \ SMTP transactions.\n   A server which supports the checkpointing extension will\
    \ then retain\n   the transaction identifer as well as the most recent state of\
    \ the\n   transaction in non-volatile storage. This information should deleted\n\
    \   only when the transaction is known to be complete from the client's\n   perspective.\
    \ Completion is assured only when the client either\n   explicitly aborts the\
    \ transaction, starts a new transaction, or\n   requests that the connection be\
    \ closed with a QUIT command.\n   In the event of an interruption prior to completing\
    \ a transaction\n   this preserved state will remain for some period of time defined\
    \ by\n   the operational policies of the server administrator. It is\n   recommended\
    \ that transaction state information be preserved for at\n   least 48 hours, although\
    \ no specific time is required.\n   When a client detects that a transaction has\
    \ been interrupted, it\n   then must wait for some period before reconnecting.\
    \ This period must\n   be long enough for server connections to time out and for\
    \ the\n   transaction state associated with such connections to be released for\n\
    \   use by a new connection. The Internet Host Requirements [5] also\n   impose\
    \ restriction on how quickly reconnection attempts can be made\n   (section 5.3.1.1).\n\
    \   Once the necessary period has elapsed the client first checks the DNS\n  \
    \ as described in [6] and determine the set of acceptable IP addresses\n   the\
    \ message can be transferred to. If the IP address used to connect\n   to the\
    \ original server is still on this list it should be tried\n   first, since this\
    \ server is most likely to be capable of restarting\n   the transaction. If this\
    \ connection attempt fails the client must\n   then proceed as described in [6]\
    \ to try all the remaining IP\n   addresses and restart the transaction there.\
    \ If the attempt to\n   restart fails on one of the other servers the client is\
    \ required to\n   retransmit the transaction in its entirety at that point.  Waiting\n\
    \   for a server with an interrupted transaction state to come back\n   online\
    \ is not acceptable.\n   Note: Multi-homed SMTP servers do exist, which means\
    \ that it is\n   entirely possible for a transaction to restart on a different\
    \ server\n   host.\n   Once the connection is made the client issues the same\
    \ MAIL command\n   with exactly the same transaction identifier. If the transaction\
    \ was\n   interrupted during or at the end of the transfer of actual message\n\
    \   data, the server first reestablishes its context to a point close as\n   possible\
    \ to the point of interruption and then responds with the\n   status message:\n\
    \     355 octet-offset is the transaction offset\n   The actual status text can\
    \ vary. However the octet-offset field is\n   required to be the first thing on\
    \ the first line of the reply, it\n   must be separated from any following text\
    \ by linear whitespace, and\n   it is structured as follows:\n     octet-offset\
    \ ::= 1*DIGIT\n   The octet-offset represents an offset, counting from zero, to\
    \ the\n   particular octet in the actual message data the server expects to see\n\
    \   next. (This is also a count of how many octets the server has\n   received\
    \ and stored successfully.) This offset does NOT account for\n   envelope data,\
    \ i.e., MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands. A value of 0\n   would indicate that the\
    \ client needs to start sending the message\n   from the beginning, a value of\
    \ 1 would indicate that the client\n   should skip one octet, and so on.\n   The\
    \ SMTP canonical format for messages is used when this offset is\n   computed.\
    \  Any octets added by any SMTP data-stuffing algorithm do\n   not count as part\
    \ of this offset. In the case of data transferred\n   with the DATA command the\
    \ offset must also correspond to the\n   beginning of a line.\n   Once this context\
    \ is reestablished the client issues another data\n   transfer command (e.g.,\
    \ DATA) and sends the remaining message data.\n   Once this data is terminated\
    \ the transaction completes in the normal\n   fashion and the server deletes the\
    \ transaction context from non-\n   volatile storage.\n   Note that the semantics\
    \ of the octet-offset immediately suggest a\n   particularly simple implementation\
    \ strategy, where the client\n   retransmits the message data as it normally would\
    \ but suppresses\n   output of the first octet-offset octets of material. The\
    \ semantics\n   used here are intentionally designed to make such implementation\n\
    \   possible, but care must be taken to insure that such an\n   implementation\
    \ strategy does not impose a significant performance\n   penalty on the client.\n"
