Abstract Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Label Switched Paths (LSPs) established using the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP TE) extensions may be signaled with a set of LSP  specific attributes.
These attributes may be carried in both Path and Resv messages.
This document specifies how LSP attributes are to be carried in RSVP Path and Resv messages using the Routing Backus  Naur Form and clarifies related Resv message formats.
This document updates RFC 4875 and RFC 5420.
Introduction Signaling in support of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) point to point
Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].
[RFC4875] defines signaling support for point to multipoint (P2MP)
Two LSP Attributes objects are defined in [RFC5420].
These objects may be used to provide additional information related to how an LSP should be set up when carried in a Path message and, when carried in a Resv message, how an LSP has been established.
The definition of the objects includes a narrative description of related message formats (see Section 9 of [RFC5420]).
This definition does not provide the related Routing Backus Naur Form (BNF)
[RFC5511] that is typically used to define how messages are to be constructed using RSVP objects.
The current message format description has led to the open question of how the LSP Attributes objects are to be processed in Resv messages of P2MP LSPs (which are defined in [RFC4875]).
This document provides the BNF for Path and Resv messages carrying the LSP Attributes object.
The definition clarifies how the objects are to be carried for all LSP types.
Both Path and Resv message BNF is provided for completeness.
This document presents the related RSVP message formats as modified by [RFC5420].
This document modifies formats defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473], and [RFC4875].
See [RFC5511] for the syntax used by RSVP.
Unmodified formats are not listed.
An example of a case where the modified formats are applicable is described in [RFC6511].
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Path message formatting is unmodified from the narrative description provided in Section 9 of [RFC5420]:
The LSP ATTRIBUTES object and the LSP REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES object MAY be carried in a Path message....
The order of objects in RSVP TE messages is recommended, but implementations must be capable of receiving the objects in any meaningful order.
On a Path message, the LSP ATTRIBUTES object and LSP REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES objects are RECOMMENDED to be placed immediately after the SESSION ATTRIBUTE object if it is present, or otherwise immediately after the LABEL REQUEST object.
If both the LSP ATTRIBUTES object and the LSP REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES object are present, the LSP REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES object is RECOMMENDED to be placed first.
LSRs MUST be prepared to receive these objects in any order in any position within a Path message.
Subsequent instances of these objects within a Path message SHOULD be ignored and MUST be forwarded unchanged.
This section presents the Path message format as modified by [RFC5420].
Unmodified formats are not listed.
This section updates [RFC4875] and [RFC5420].
Section 9 of [RFC5420] contains the following text regarding Resv messages:
The LSP ATTRIBUTES object MAY be carried in a Resv message.
On a Resv message, the LSP ATTRIBUTES object is placed in the flow descriptor and is associated with
the FILTER SPEC object that precedes it.
It is RECOMMENDED that the LSP ATTRIBUTES object be placed immediately after the LABEL object.
LSRs MUST be prepared to receive this object in any order in any position within a Resv message, subject to the previous note.
Only one instance of the LSP ATTRIBUTES object is meaningful within the context of a FILTER SPEC object.
Subsequent instances of the object SHOULD be ignored and MUST be forwarded unchanged.
This means that LSP attributes may be present per sender (LSP) and allows for the LSP Attributes object to be modified using make  before break (see [RFC3209]).
This definition is sufficient for point to point ([RFC3209] and [RFC3473])
LSPs and the special case where all point to multipoint source to leaf (S2L) sub LSPs ([RFC4875])
report the same operational status (as used in [RFC5420]).
However, this definition does not allow for different egress Label Switching Routers (LSRs) to report different operational statuses.
In order to allow such reporting, this document adds the following definition: An LSR that wishes to report the operational status of a (point  to multipoint)
S2L sub LSP may include the LSP Attributes object in a Resv message or update the object that is already carried in a Resv message.
LSP Attributes objects representing S2L sub LSP status MUST follow a S2L SUB LSP object.
Only the first instance of the LSP Attributes object is meaningful within the context of a S2L SUB LSP object.
Subsequent instances of the object SHOULD be ignored and MUST be forwarded unchanged.
When an LSP Attributes object is present before the first S2L SUB LSP object, the LSP Attributes object represents the operational status of all S2L sub LSPs identified in the message.
Subsequent instances of the object (e.g., in the filter spec or the S2L sub LSP flow descriptor) SHOULD be ignored and MUST be forwarded unchanged.
When a branch node is combining Resv state from multiple receivers into a single Resv message and an LSP Attributes object is present before the first S2L SUB LSP object in a received Resv message, the received LSP Attributes object SHOULD be moved to follow the first received S2L SUB LSP object and then SHOULD be duplicated for, and placed after, each subsequent S2L SUB LSP object.
This section presents the Resv message format for LSPs as modified by [RFC5420] and can be used to report operational status per LSP.
Unmodified formats are not listed.
The following is based on [RFC4875].
[ <S2L sub LSP flow descriptor list
[ <S2L sub LSP flow descriptor list> ] 3.2.
This section presents the Resv message format for LSPs as modified by this document and [RFC5420], and can be used to report operational status per S2L sub LSP.
Unmodified formats are not listed.
The following is based on [RFC4875].
[ <S2L sub LSP flow descriptor list> ]
<S2L sub LSP flow descriptor list
[ <P2MP SECONDARY RECORD ROUTE> ] 3.2.1.  Compatibility A node that supports [RFC4875] and [RFC5420], but not this document, will interpret
the first LSP Attributes object present in a received message, which is formatted as described in this document, as representing LSP operational status rather than S2L sub LSP status.
It is unclear if this is a significant issue as the LSP Attributes object is currently considered to be an unsuitable mechanism for reporting operational status of P2MP LSPs, for example, see Section 2.1 of [RFC6511].
The intent of this document is to correct this limitation; it is expected that networks that wish to make use of such operational reporting will deploy this extension.
This document clarifies usage of objects defined in [RFC5420].
No new information is conveyed; therefore, no additional security considerations are included here.
