  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies payload formats for encapsulating
    both\n   consumer- and professional-use Digital Video (DV) format data streams\n
    \  into the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].  DV\n   compression
    audio and video formats were designed for a recording\n   format on helical-scan
    magnetic tape media.  The DV standards for\n   consumer-market devices, the IEC
    61883 and 61834 series, cover many\n   aspects of consumer-use digital video,
    including mechanical\n   specifications of a cassette, magnetic recording format,
    error\n   correction on the magnetic tape, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)\n   video
    encoding format, and audio encoding format [IEC61834].  The\n   digital interface
    part of IEC 61883 defines an interface on the IEEE\n   1394 system [IEC61883][IEEE1394].
    \ This specification set supports\n   several video formats: SD-VCR (Standard
    Definition), HD-VCR (High\n   Definition), SDL-VCR (Standard Definition - Long),
    PALPlus, DVB\n   (Digital Video Broadcast), and ATV (Advanced Television).  North\n
    \  American formats are indicated with a number of lines and \"/60\",\n   while
    European formats use \"/50\".  DV standards extended for\n   professional use
    were published by the Society of Motion Picture and\n   Television Engineers (SMPTE)
    as 314M and 370M, for different sampling\n   systems, higher color resolution,
    and higher bit rates\n   [SMPTE314M][SMPTE370M].\n   In summary, there are two
    kinds of DV, one for consumer use and the\n   other for professional.  The original
    \"DV\" specification designed for\n   consumer-use digital VCRs is approved as
    the IEC 61834 standard set.\n   The specifications for professional DV are published
    as SMPTE 314M\n   and 370M.  Both encoding formats are based on consumer DV and
    used in\n   SMPTE D-7, D-9, and D-12 video systems.  The RTP payload format\n
    \  specified in this document supports IEC 61834 consumer DV and\n   professional
    SMPTE 314M and 370M (DV-based) formats.\n   IEC 61834 also includes magnetic tape
    recording for digital TV\n   broadcasting systems (such as DVB and ATV) that use
    MPEG2 encoding.\n   The payload format for encapsulating MPEG2 into RTP has already
    been\n   defined in RFC 2250 [RFC2250] and elsewhere.\n   Consequently, the payload
    specified in this document will support six\n   video formats of the IEC standard:
    SD-VCR (525/60, 625/50), HD-VCR\n   (1125/60, 1250/50), and SDL-VCR (525/60, 625/50).
    \ It also supports\n   eight of the SMPTE standards: 314M 25 Mbit/s (525/60, 625/50),
    314M\n   50 Mbit/s (525/60, 625/50), and 370M 100 Mbit/s (1080/60i, 1080/50i,\n
    \  720/60p, and 720/50p).  In the future, it can be extended into other\n   video
    formats managed by the 80-byte DV Digital Interface Format\n   (DIF) block.\n
    \  Throughout this specification, we make extensive use of the\n   terminology
    of IEC and SMPTE standards.  The reader should consult\n   the original references
    for definitions of these terms.\n"

    - "2.1.  The DV Format Encoding\n   The DV format only uses the DCT compression
      technique within each\n   frame, contrasted with the interframe compression
      of the MPEG video\n   standards [ISO/IEC11172][ISO/IEC13818].  All video data,
      including\n   audio and other system data, is managed within the picture frame
      unit\n   of video.\n   The DV video encoding is composed of a three-level hierarchical\n
      \  structure, i.e., DCT super block, DCT macro block, and DCT block.  A\n   picture
      frame is divided into rectangle- or clipped-rectangle-shaped\n   DCT super blocks.
      \ DCT super blocks are divided into 27 rectangle- or\n   square-shaped DCT macro
      blocks, and each DCT macro block consists of\n   a number of DCT blocks.  Each
      DCT block consists of 8x8 pixels and\n   represents a rectangle region for each
      color, Y, Cb, and Cr.\n   Audio data is encoded in Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
      format.  The\n   sampling frequency is 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, or 48 kHz and the\n
      \  quantization is 12-bit non-linear, 16-bit linear, or 20-bit linear.\n   The
      number of channels may be up to 8.  Only certain combinations of\n   these parameters
      are allowed, depending upon the video format; the\n   restrictions are specified
      in each document [IEC61834][SMPTE314M]\n   [SMPTE370M].\n   A frame of data
      in the DV format stream is divided into several \"DIF\n   sequences\".  A DIF
      sequence is composed of an integral number of\n   80-byte DIF blocks.  A DIF
      block is the primitive unit for all\n   treatment of DV streams.  Each DIF block
      contains a 3-byte ID header\n   that specifies the type of the DIF block and
      its position in the DIF\n   sequence.  Five types of DIF blocks are defined:
      DIF sequence header,\n   Subcode, Video Auxiliary (VAUX) information, Audio,
      and Video.  Audio\n   DIF blocks are composed of 5 bytes of Audio Auxiliary
      (AAUX) data and\n   72 bytes of audio data.\n   Each RTP packet starts with
      the RTP header as defined in RFC 3550\n   [RFC3550].  No additional payload-format-specific
      header is required\n   for this payload format.\n"
    title: 2.1.  The DV Format Encoding
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  RTP Header Usage\n   The RTP header fields that have a meaning specific
      to the DV format\n   are described as follows:\n   Payload type (PT): The payload
      type is dynamically assigned by means\n   outside the scope of this document.
      \ If multiple DV encoding formats\n   are to be used within one RTP session,
      then multiple dynamic payload\n   types MUST be assigned, one for each DV encoding
      format.  The sender\n   MUST change to the corresponding payload type whenever
      the encoding\n   format is changed.\n   Timestamp: 32-bit 90 kHz timestamp representing
      the time at which the\n   first data in the frame was sampled.  All RTP packets
      within the same\n   video frame MUST have the same timestamp.  The timestamp
      SHOULD\n   increment by a multiple of the nominal interval for one DV frame\n
      \  time, as given in the following table:\n   +----------+----------------+---------------------------------------+\n
      \  |   Mode   |   Frame rate   |  Increase of 90 kHz timestamp per DV  |\n   |
      \         |      (Hz)      |                 frame                 |\n   +----------+----------------+---------------------------------------+\n
      \  |  525-60  |      29.97     |                  3003                 |\n   |
      \ 625-50  |       25       |                  3600                 |\n   |  1125-60
      |       30       |                  3000                 |\n   |  1250-50 |
      \      25       |                  3600                 |\n   | 1080-60i |      29.97
      \    |                  3003                 |\n   | 1080-50i |       25       |
      \                 3600                 |\n   |  720-60p |      59.94     |                3003(*)
      \               |\n   |  720-50p |       50       |                3600(*)                |\n
      \  +----------+----------------+---------------------------------------+\n   (*)
      Note that even in the 720-line DV system, the data in two video\n   frames shall
      be processed within one DV frame duration of the 1080-\n   line system.  Audio
      data and subcode data in the 720-line system are\n   processed in the same way
      as the 1080-line system.  Therefore, in the\n   720-line system, the timestamp
      increase given in the third column\n   corresponds to two video frames time.\n
      \  Marker bit (M): The marker bit of the RTP fixed header is set to one\n   on
      the last packet of a video frame; on other packets, it MUST be\n   zero.  The
      M bit allows the receiver to know that it has received the\n   last packet of
      a frame so it can display the image without waiting\n   for the first packet
      of the next frame to arrive to detect the frame\n   change.  However, detection
      of a frame change MUST NOT rely on the\n   marker bit since the last packet
      of the frame might be lost.\n   Detection of a frame change MUST be based on
      a difference in the RTP\n   timestamp.\n"
    title: 2.2.  RTP Header Usage
  - contents:
    - "2.3.  Payload Structures\n   Integral DIF blocks are placed into the RTP payload
      beginning\n   immediately after the RTP header.  Any number of DIF blocks may
      be\n   packed into one RTP packet, but all DIF blocks in one RTP packet MUST\n
      \  be from the same video frame.  DIF blocks from the next video frame\n   MUST
      NOT be packed into the same RTP packet even if more payload\n   space remains.
      \ This requirement stems from the fact that the\n   transition from one video
      frame to the next is indicated by a change\n   in the RTP timestamp.  It also
      reduces the processing complexity on\n   the receiver.  Since the RTP payload
      contains an integral number of\n   DIF blocks, the length of the RTP payload
      will be a multiple of 80\n   bytes.\n   Audio and video data may be transmitted
      as one bundled RTP stream or\n   in separate RTP streams (unbundled).  The choice
      MUST be indicated as\n   part of the assignment of the dynamic payload type
      and MUST remain\n   unchanged for the duration of the RTP session to avoid complicated\n
      \  procedures of sequence number synchronization.  The RTP sender could\n   omit
      the DIF sequence header and subcode DIF blocks from a stream\n   when the information
      either is known from out-of-band sources or is\n   not required for the application.
      \ Note that time code in DIF blocks\n   is mandatory for professional video
      applications.  When unbundled\n   audio and video streams are sent, any DIF
      sequence header and subcode\n   DIF blocks MUST be included and sent in the
      video stream.\n   DV streams include \"source\" and \"source control\" packs
      that carry\n   information indispensable for proper decoding, such as video
      signal\n   type, frame rate, aspect ratio, picture position, quantization of\n
      \  audio sampling, number of audio samples in a frame, number of audio\n   channels,
      audio channel assignment, and language of the audio.\n   However, describing
      all of these attributes with a signaling protocol\n   would require large descriptions
      to enumerate all the combinations.\n   Therefore, no Session Description Protocol
      (SDP) [RFC4566] parameters\n   for these attributes are defined in this document.
      \ Instead, the RTP\n   sender MUST transmit at least those VAUX (Video Auxiliary)
      DIF blocks\n   and/or audio DIF blocks with AAUX (Audio Auxiliary) information
      bytes\n   that include \"source\" and \"source control\" packs containing the\n
      \  indispensable information for decoding.\n   In the case of one bundled stream,
      DIF blocks for both audio and\n   video are packed into RTP packets in the same
      order as they were\n   encoded.\n   In the case of an unbundled stream, only
      the header, subcode, video,\n   and VAUX DIF blocks are sent within the video
      stream.  Audio is sent\n   in a different stream if desired, using a different
      RTP payload type.\n   It is also possible to send audio duplicated in a separate
      stream, in\n   addition to bundling it in with the video stream.\n   When using
      unbundled mode, it is RECOMMENDED that the audio stream\n   data be extracted
      from the DIF blocks and repackaged into the\n   corresponding RTP payload format
      for the audio encoding (DAT12, L16,\n   L20) [RFC3551][RFC3190] in order to
      maximize interoperability with\n   non-DV-capable receivers while maintaining
      the original source\n   quality.\n   In the case of unbundled transmission that
      is compelled to use both\n   audio and video in the DV format, the same timestamp
      SHOULD be used\n   for both audio and video data within the same frame to simplify
      the\n   lip synchronization effort on the receiver.  Lip synchronization may\n
      \  also be achieved using reference timestamps passed in RTP Control\n   Protocol
      (RTCP) as described in [RFC3550].  In this case, the audio\n   stream uses the
      90 kHz clock rate, and the timestamp uses the same\n   clock rate as the video.\n
      \  The sender MAY reduce the video frame rate by discarding the video\n   data
      and VAUX DIF blocks for some of the video frames.  The RTP\n   timestamp MUST
      still be incremented to account for the discarded\n   frames.  The sender MAY
      alternatively reduce bandwidth by discarding\n   video data DIF blocks for portions
      of the image that are unchanged\n   from the previous image.  To enable this
      bandwidth reduction,\n   receivers SHOULD implement an error-concealment strategy
      to\n   accommodate lost or missing DIF blocks, e.g., repeating the\n   corresponding
      DIF block from the previous image.\n"

      - "3.2.1.  Mapping of Payload Type Parameters to SDP\n   The information carried
        in the media type specification has a\n   specific mapping to fields in the
        Session Description Protocol (SDP),\n   which is commonly used to describe
        RTP sessions.  When SDP is used to\n   specify sessions employing the DV encoding,
        the mapping is as\n   follows:\n   o  The media type (\"video\") goes in SDP
        \"m=\" as the media name.\n   o  The media subtype (\"DV\") goes in SDP \"a=rtpmap\"
        as the encoding\n      name.  The RTP clock rate in \"a=rtpmap\" MUST be 90000,
        which for\n      the payload format defined in this document is a 90 kHz clock.\n
        \  o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP \"a=fmtp\" attribute by\n      copying
        them directly from the media type string as a semicolon-\n      separated
        list of parameter=value pairs.\n   In the DV video payload format, the \"a=fmtp\"
        line will be used to\n   show the encoding type within the DV video and will
        be used as below:\n      a=fmtp:<payload type> encode=<DV-video encoding>\n
        \  The required parameter \"encode\" specifies which type of DV format is\n
        \  used.  The DV format name will be one of the following values:\n      SD-VCR/525-60\n
        \     SD-VCR/625-50\n      HD-VCR/1125-60\n      HD-VCR/1250-50\n      SDL-VCR/525-60\n
        \     SDL-VCR/625-50\n      314M-25/525-60\n      314M-25/625-50\n      314M-50/525-60\n
        \     314M-50/625-50\n      370M/1080-60i\n      370M/1080-50i\n      370M/720-60p\n
        \     370M/720-50p\n      306M/525-60 (for backward compatibility)\n      306M/625-50
        (for backward compatibility)\n   In order to show whether or not the audio
        data is bundled into the DV\n   stream, a format-specific parameter is defined:\n
        \     a=fmtp:<payload type> encode=<DV-video encoding> audio=<audio\n      bundled>\n
        \  The optional parameter \"audio\" will be one of the following values:\n
        \     bundled\n      none (default)\n   If the fmtp \"audio\" parameter is
        not present, then audio data MUST\n   NOT be bundled into the DV video stream.\n"

        apply when using SDP offer/answer\n   procedures [RFC3264] to negotiate the
        use of the DV payload in RTP:\n   o  The \"encode\" parameter can be used
        for sendrecv, sendonly, and\n      recvonly streams.  Each encode type MUST
        use a separate payload\n      type number.\n   o  Any unknown parameter in
        an offer MUST be ignored by the receiver\n      and MUST NOT be included in
        the answer.\n   In an offer for unbundled streams, the group attribute as
        defined in\n   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework [RFC5888]\n
        \  can be used in order to associate the related audio and video.  The\n   example

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   RTP packets using the payload format defined
    in this specification\n   are subject to the security considerations discussed
    in the RTP\n   specification [RFC3550] and any appropriate RTP profile.  This\n
    \  implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by\n   encryption.
    \ Because the data compression used with this payload\n   format is applied end-to-end,
    encryption may be performed after\n   compression so there is no conflict between
    the two operations.\n   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings
    using\n   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end\n   computational
    load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams\n   into the stream that
    are complex to decode and cause the receiver to\n   be overloaded.  However, this
    encoding does not exhibit any\n   significant non-uniformity.\n   As with any
    IP-based protocol, in some circumstances, a receiver may\n   be overloaded simply
    by the receipt of too many packets, either\n   desired or undesired.  Network-layer
    authentication may be used to\n   discard packets from undesired sources, but
    the processing cost of\n   the authentication itself may be too high.  In a multicast\n
    \  environment, mechanisms for joining and pruning of specific sources\n   are
    specified in IGMPv3, Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2\n   (MLDv2) [RFC3376][RFC3810]
    or Lightweight-IGMPv3 (LW-IGMPv3),\n   LW-MLDv2 [RFC5790] and in multicast routing
    protocols to allow a\n   receiver to select which sources are allowed to reach
    it [RFC4607].\n"

    [SMPTE314M]\n   as different encoding formats, although the format of SMPTE 306M
    is\n   already covered by SMPTE 314M.  Therefore, this document recommends\n   that
    the definition depending on SMPTE 306M SHOULD NOT be used, and\n   SMPTE 314M
    SHOULD be used instead.  An RTP application could handle a\n   stream identified
    in SMPTE 306M encoding as SMPTE 314M encoding\n   instead.\n   An offer MAY include
    SMPTE 306M encoding coming from a legacy system,\n   and receivers SHOULD support
    this value.\n   If an initial offer that did not include SMPTE 306M was rejected,
    the\n   offerer MAY try a new offer with SMPTE 306M.  For this case, an RTP\n
    \  application MAY handle a stream identified in SMPTE 306M encoding as\n   SMPTE
    314M encoding instead.\n   In addition, the SDP examples in [RFC3189] provide
