  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the format of an electronic signature that\
    \ can\n   remain valid over long periods.  This includes evidence as to its\n\
    \   validity even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny\n  \
    \ (i.e., repudiates) the validity of the signature.\n   The format can be considered\
    \ as an extension to RFC 3852 and RFC\n   2634, where, when appropriate, additional\
    \ signed and unsigned\n   attributes have been defined.\n   The contents of this\
    \ Informational RFC amount to a transposition of\n   the ETSI Technical Specification\
    \ (TS) 101 733 V.1.7.4 (CMS Advanced\n   Electronic Signatures -- CAdES) and is\
    \ technically equivalent to it.\n   The technical contents of this specification\
    \ are maintained by ETSI.\n   The ETSI TS and further updates are available free\
    \ of charge at:\n   http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/Standards/StandardsDownload.aspx\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is intended to cover electronic signatures\
    \ for various\n   types of transactions, including business transactions (e.g.,\n\
    \   purchase requisition, contract, and invoice applications) where\n   long-term\
    \ validity of such signatures is important.  This includes\n   evidence as to\
    \ its validity even if the signer or verifying party\n   later attempts to deny\
    \ (i.e., repudiates; see ISO/IEC 10181-5\n   [ISO10181-5]) the validity of the\
    \ signature.\n   Thus, the present document can be used for any transaction between\
    \ an\n   individual and a company, between two companies, between an\n   individual\
    \ and a governmental body, etc.  The present document is\n   independent of any\
    \ environment; it can be applied to any environment,\n   e.g., smart cards, Global\
    \ System for Mobile Communication Subscriber\n   Identity Module (GSM SIM) cards,\
    \ special programs for electronic\n   signatures, etc.\n   The European Directive\
    \ on a community framework for Electronic\n   Signatures defines an electronic\
    \ signature as: \"Data in electronic\n   form which is attached to or logically\
    \ associated with other\n   electronic data and which serves as a method of authentication\"\
    .\n   An electronic signature, as used in the present document, is a form\n  \
    \ of advanced electronic signature, as defined in the Directive.\n"
- title: 2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope\n   The scope of the present document covers electronic signature formats\n\
    \   only.  The aspects of Electronic Signature Policies are defined in\n   RFC\
    \ 3125 [RFC3125] and ETSI TR 102 272 [TR102272].\n   The present document defines\
    \ a number of electronic signature\n   formats, including electronic signatures\
    \ that can remain valid over\n   long periods.  This includes evidence as to its\
    \ validity even if the\n   signer or verifying party later attempts to deny (repudiates)\
    \ the\n   validity of the electronic signature.\n   The present document specifies\
    \ use of Trusted Service Providers\n   (e.g., Time-Stamping Authorities) and the\
    \ data that needs to be\n   archived (e.g., cross-certificates and revocation\
    \ lists) to meet the\n   requirements of long-term electronic signatures.\n  \
    \ An electronic signature, as defined by the present document, can be\n   used\
    \ for arbitration in case of a dispute between the signer and\n   verifier, which\
    \ may occur at some later time, even years later.\n   The present document includes\
    \ the concept of signature policies that\n   can be used to establish technical\
    \ consistency when validating\n   electronic signatures, but it does not mandate\
    \ their use.\n   The present document is based on the use of public key cryptography\n\

- title: 4.1.  Major Parties
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Major Parties\n   The major parties involved in a business transaction\
    \ supported by\n   electronic signatures, as defined in the present document,\
    \ are:\n      - the signer;\n      - the verifier;\n      - Trusted Service Providers\
    \ (TSP); and\n      - the arbitrator.\n   The signer is the entity that creates\
    \ the electronic signature.  When\n   the signer digitally signs over data using\
    \ the prescribed format,\n   this represents a commitment on behalf of the signing\
    \ entity to the\n   data being signed.\n   The verifier is the entity that validates\
    \ the electronic signature;\n   it may be a single entity or multiple entities.\n\
    \   The Trusted Service Providers (TSPs) are one or more entities that\n   help\
    \ to build trust relationships between the signer and verifier.\n   They support\
    \ the signer and verifier by means of supporting services\n   including: user\
    \ certificates, cross-certificates, time-stamp tokens,\n   CRLs, ARLs, and OCSP\
    \ responses.  The following TSPs are used to\n   support the functions defined\
    \ in the present document:\n      - Certification Authorities;\n      - Registration\
    \ Authorities;\n      - CRL Issuers;\n      - OCSP Responders;\n      - Repository\
    \ Authorities (e.g., a Directory);\n      - Time-Stamping Authorities;\n     \
    \ - Time-Marking Authorities; and\n      - Signature Policy Issuers.\n   Certification\
    \ Authorities provide users with public key certificates\n   and a revocation\
    \ service.\n   Registration Authorities allow the identification and registration\
    \ of\n   entities before a CA generates certificates.\n   Repository Authorities\
    \ publish CRLs issued by CAs, signature policies\n   issued by Signature Policy\
    \ Issuers, and optionally public key\n   certificates.\n   Time-Stamping Authorities\
    \ attest that some data was formed before a\n   given trusted time.\n   Time-Marking\
    \ Authorities record that some data was formed before a\n   given trusted time.\n\
    \   Signature Policy Issuers define the signature policies to be used by\n   signers\
    \ and verifiers.\n   In some cases, the following additional TSPs are needed:\n\
    \      - Attribute Authorities.\n   Attributes Authorities provide users with\
    \ attributes linked to public\n   key certificates.\n   An Arbitrator is an entity\
    \ that arbitrates in disputes between a\n   signer and a verifier.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Signature Policies
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Signature Policies\n   The present document includes the concept of signature\
    \ policies that\n   can be used to establish technical consistency when validating\n\
    \   electronic signatures.\n   When a comprehensive signature policy used by the\
    \ verifier is either\n   explicitly indicated by the signer or implied by the\
    \ data being\n   signed, then a consistent result can be obtained when validating\
    \ an\n   electronic signature.\n   When the signature policy being used by the\
    \ verifier is neither\n   indicated by the signer nor can be derived from other\
    \ data, or the\n   signature policy is incomplete, then verifiers, including\n\
    \   arbitrators, may obtain different results when validating an\n   electronic\
    \ signature.  Therefore, comprehensive signature policies\n   that ensure consistency\
    \ of signature validation are recommended from\n   both the signer's and verifier's\
    \ point of view.\n   Further information on signature policies is provided in:\n\
    \      - TR 102 038 [TR102038];\n      - Sections 5.8.1, C.1, and C.3.1 of the\
    \ present document;\n      - RFC 3125 [RFC3125]; and\n      - TR 102 272 [TR102272].\n"
- title: 4.3.  Electronic Signature Formats

  - "4.3.  Electronic Signature Formats\n   The current section provides an overview\
    \ for two forms of CMS\n   advanced electronic signature specified in the present\
    \ document,\n   namely, the CAdES Basic Electronic Signature (CAdES-BES) and the\n\
    \   CAdES Explicit Policy-based Electronic Signature (CAdES-EPES).\n   Conformance\

  contents:
  - "4.3.1.  CAdES Basic Electronic Signature (CAdES-BES)\n   A CAdES Basic Electronic\
    \ Signature (CAdES-BES), in accordance with\n   the present document, contains:\n\
    \      - The signed user data (e.g., the signer's document), as defined\n    \
    \    in CMS (RFC 3852 [4]);\n      - A collection of mandatory signed attributes,\
    \ as defined in CMS\n        (RFC 3852 [4]) and in ESS (RFC 2634 [5]);\n     \
    \ - Additional mandatory signed attributes, defined in the present\n        document;\

    \ attributes; and\n      - a collection of optional unsigned attributes.\n   The\
    \ mandatory signed attributes are:\n      - Content-type.  It is defined in RFC\
    \ 3852 [4] and specifies the\n        type of the EncapsulatedContentInfo value\
    \ being signed.  Details\n        are provided in Section 5.7.1 of the present\
    \ document.\n        Rationale for its inclusion is provided in Annex C.3.7;\n\
    \      - Message-digest.  It is defined in RFC 3852 [4] and specifies the\n  \
    \      message digest of the eContent OCTET STRING within\n        encapContentInfo\
    \ being signed.  Details are provided in Section\n        5.7.2;\n      - ESS\
    \ signing-certificate OR ESS signing-certificate-v2.  The ESS\n        signing-certificate\
    \ attribute is defined in Enhanced Security\n        Services (ESS), RFC 2634\
    \ [5], and only allows for the use of\n        SHA-1 as a digest algorithm.  The\
    \ ESS signing-certificate-v2\n        attribute is defined in \"ESS Update: Adding\
    \ CertID Algorithm\n        Agility\", RFC 5035 [15], and allows for the use of\
    \ any digest\n        algorithm.  A CAdES-BES claiming compliance with the present\n\
    \        document must include one of them.  Section 5.7.3 provides the\n    \
    \    details of these attributes.  Rationale for its inclusion is\n        provided\
    \ in Annex C.3.3.\n   Optional signed attributes may be added to the CAdES-BES,\
    \ including\n   optional signed attributes defined in CMS (RFC 3852 [4]), ESS\
    \ (RFC\n   2634 [5]), and the present document.  Listed below are optional\n \
    \  attributes that are defined in Section 5 and have a rationale\n   provided\
    \ in Annex C:\n      - Signing-time: as defined in CMS (RFC 3852 [4]), indicates\
    \ the\n        time of the signature, as claimed by the signer.  Details and\n\
    \        short rationale are provided in Section 5.9.1.  Annex C.3.6\n       \
    \ provides the rationale.\n      - content-hints: as defined in ESS (RFC 2634\
    \ [5]), provides\n        information that describes the innermost signed content\
    \ of a\n        multi-layer message where one content is encapsulated in\n   \
    \     another.  Section 5.10.1 provides the specification details.\n        Annex\
    \ C.3.8 provides the rationale.\n      - content-reference: as defined in ESS\
    \ (RFC 2634 [5]), can be\n        incorporated as a way to link request and reply\
    \ messages in an\n        exchange between two parties.  Section 5.10.1 provides\
    \ the\n        specification details.  Annex C.3.9 provides the rationale.\n \
    \     - content-identifier: as defined in ESS (RFC 2634 [5]), contains\n     \
    \   an identifier that may be used later on in the previous\n        content-reference\
    \ attribute.  Section 5.10.2 provides the\n        specification details.\n  \
    \    - commitment-type-indication: this attribute is defined by the\n        present\
    \ document as a way to indicate the commitment endorsed by\n        the signer\
    \ when producing the signature.  Section 5.11.1\n        provides the specification\
    \ details.  Annex C.3.2 provides the\n        rationale.\n      - signer-location:\
    \ this attribute is defined by the present\n        document.  It allows the signer\
    \ to indicate the place where the\n        signer purportedly produced the signature.\
    \  Section 5.11.2\n        provides the specification details.  Annex C.3.5 provides\
    \ the\n        rationale.\n      - signer-attributes: this attribute is defined\
    \ by the present\n        document.  It allows a claimed or certified role to\
    \ be\n        incorporated into the signed information.  Section 5.11.3\n    \
    \    provides the specification details.  Annex C.3.4 provides the\n        rationale.\n\
    \      - content-time-stamp: this attribute is defined by the present\n      \
    \  document.  It allows a time-stamp token of the data to be signed\n        to\
    \ be incorporated into the signed information.  It provides\n        proof of\
    \ the existence of the data before the signature was\n        created.  Section\
    \ 5.11.4 provides the specification details.\n        Annex C.3.6 provides the\
    \ rationale.\n   A CAdES-BES form can also incorporate instances of unsigned\n\
    \   attributes, as defined in CMS (RFC 3852 [4]) and ESS (RFC 2634 [5]).\n   \

  - "4.6.  Validation Process\n   The validation process validates an electronic signature;\
    \ the output\n   status of the validation process can be:\n      - invalid;\n\
    \      - incomplete validation; or\n      - valid.\n   An invalid response indicates\
    \ that either the signature format is\n   incorrect or that the digital signature\
    \ value fails verification\n   (e.g., the integrity check on the digital signature\
    \ value fails, or\n   any of the certificates on which the digital signature verification\n\
    \   depends is known to be invalid or revoked).\n   An incomplete validation response\
    \ indicates that the signature\n   validation status is currently unknown.  In\
    \ the case of incomplete\n   validation, additional information may be made available\
    \ to the\n   application or user, thus allowing them to decide what to do with\
    \ the\n   electronic signature.  In the case of incomplete validation, the\n \
    \  electronic signature may be checked again at some later time when\n   additional\
    \ information becomes available.\n      NOTE: For example, an incomplete validation\
    \ may be because all the\n      required certificates are not available or the\
    \ grace period is not\n      completed.\n   A valid response indicates that the\
    \ signature has passed\n   verification, and it complies with the signature validation\
    \ policy.\n   Example validation sequences are illustrated in Annex B.\n"

    \ is a time-stamp token of many of the\n   elements of the signedData in the electronic\
    \ signature.  If the\n   certificate-values and revocation-values attributes are\
    \ not present\n   in the CAdES-BES or CAdES-EPES, then they shall be added to\
    \ the\n   electronic signature prior to computing the archive time-stamp token.\n\
    \   The archive-time-stamp attribute is an unsigned attribute.  Several\n   instances\
    \ of this attribute may occur with an electronic signature\n   both over time\

    \ use of the\n      archiveTimestamp attribute defined in prior versions of TS\
    \ 101 733\n      is deprecated.\n      NOTE 2: Counter signatures held as countersignature\
    \ attributes do\n      not require independent archive time-stamps, as they are\
    \ protected\n      by the archive time-stamp against the containing SignedData\n\
    \      structure.\n      NOTE 3: Unless DER is used throughout, it is recommended\
    \ that the\n      binary encoding of the ASN.1 structures being time-stamped be\n\
    \      preserved when being archived to ensure that the recalculation of\n   \
    \   the data hash is consistent.\n      NOTE 4: The hash is calculated over the\
    \ concatenated data elements\n      as received/stored, including the Type and\
    \ Length encoding.\n      NOTE 5: Whilst it is recommended that unsigned attributes\
    \ be DER\n      encoded, it cannot generally be so guaranteed except by prior\n\
    \      arrangement.  For further information and definition of\n      TimeStampToken,\
    \ see Section 7.4.  The timestamp should be created\n      using stronger algorithms\
    \ (or longer key lengths) than in the\n      original electronic signatures and\
    \ weak algorithm (key length)\n      timestamps.\n      NOTE 6: This form of ES\
    \ also provides protection against a TSP key\n      compromise.\n   The ArchiveTimeStamp\
    \ will be added as an unsigned attribute in the\n   SignerInfo sequence.  For\
    \ the validation of one ArchiveTimeStamp, the\n   data elements of the SignerInfo\
    \ must be concatenated, excluding all\n   later ArchivTimeStampToken attributes.\n\
    \   Certificates and revocation information required to validate the\n   ArchiveTimeStamp\

  contents:
  - "B.1.  Extended Forms of Validation Data\n   The Complete validation data (CAdES-C)\
    \ described in Section 4.3 and\n   illustrated in Figure 3 may be extended to\
    \ create electronic\n   signatures with extended validation data.  Some electronic\
    \ signature\n   forms that include extended validation are explained below.\n\
    \   An X-Long electronic signature (CAdES-X Long) is the CAdES-C with the\n  \
    \ values of the certificates and revocation information.\n   This form of electronic\
    \ signature can be useful when the verifier\n   does not have direct access to\
    \ the following information:\n      - the signer's certificate;\n      - all the\
    \ CA certificates that make up the full certification\n        path;\n      -\
    \ all the associated revocation status information, as referenced\n        in\
    \ the CAdES-C.\n   In some situations, additional time-stamps may be created and\
    \ added\n   to the Electronic Signatures as additional attributes.  For example:\n\
    \      - time-stamping all the validation data as held with the ES\n        (CAdES-C),\
    \ this eXtended validation data is called a CAdES-X\n        Type 1; or\n    \
    \  - time-stamping individual reference data as used for complete\n        validation.\
    \  This form of eXtended validation data is called an\n        CAdES-X Type 2.\n\
    \      NOTE 1: The advantages/drawbacks for CAdES-X Type 1 and CAdES-X\n     \
    \ Type 2 are discussed in Annex C.4.4.\n   The above time-stamp forms can be useful\
    \ when it is required to\n   counter the risk that any CA keys used in the certificate\
    \ chain may\n   be compromised.\n   A combination of the two formats above may\
    \ be used.  This form of\n   eXtended validation data is called an ES X-Long Type\
    \ 1 or CAdES-X\n   Long Type 2.  This form of electronic signature can be useful\
    \ when\n   the verifier needs both the values and proof of when the validation\n\
    \   data existed.\n      NOTE 2: The advantages/drawbacks for CAdES-X long Type\
    \ 1 and\n      CAdES-X long Type 2 are discussed in Annex C.4.6.\n"

    \ validation sequence\n   Soon after receiving the electronic signature (CAdES)\
    \ from the signer\n   (1), the digital signature value may be checked; the validation\n\
    \   process shall at least add a time-stamp (2), unless the signer has\n   provided\
    \ one which is trusted by the verifier.  The validation\n   process may also validate\
    \ the electronic signature using additional\n   data (e.g., certificates, CRL,\
    \ etc.) provided by Trusted Service\n   Providers.  When applicable, the validation\
    \ process will also need to\n   conform to the requirements specified in a signature\
    \ policy.  If the\n   validation process is validation incomplete, then the output\
    \ from\n   this stage is the CAdES-T.\n   To ascertain the validity status as\
    \ Valid or Invalid and communicate\n   that to the user (4), all the additional\
    \ data required to validate\n   the CAdES-C must be available (e.g., the complete\
    \ certificate and\n   revocation information).\n   Once the data needed to complete\
    \ validation data references (CAdES-C)\n   is available, then the validation process\
    \ should:\n      - obtain all the necessary additional certificates and revocation\n\
    \        status information;\n      - complete all the validation checks on the\
    \ ES using the complete\n        certificate and revocation information (if a\
    \ time-stamp is not\n        already present, this may be added at the same stage,\
    \ combining\n        the CAdES-T and CAdES-C processes);\n      - record the complete\
    \ certificate and revocation references (3);\n      - indicate the validity status\
    \ to the user (4).\n   At the same time as the validation process creates the\
    \ CAdES-C, the\n   validation process may provide and/or record the values of\n\
    \   certificates and revocation status information used in CAdES-C (5).\n   The\
    \ end result is called CAdES-X Long.\n   This is illustrated in Figure B.7.\n"

- title: C.1.  The Signature Policy
  contents:
  - "C.1.  The Signature Policy\n   The signature policy is a set of rules for the\
    \ creation and\n   validation of an electronic signature, under which the signature\
    \ can\n   be determined to be valid.  A given legal/contractual context may\n\
    \   recognize a particular signature policy as meeting its requirements.\n   A\
    \ signature policy may be issued, for example, by a party relying on\n   the electronic\
    \ signatures and selected by the signer for use with\n   that relying party. \
    \ Alternatively, a signature policy may be\n   established through an electronic\
    \ trading association for use amongst\n   its members.  Both the signer and verifier\
    \ use the same signature\n   policy.\n   The signature policy may be explicitly\
    \ identified or may be implied\n   by the semantics of the data being signed and\
    \ other external data,\n   like a contract being referenced, which itself refers\
    \ to a signature\n   policy.  An explicit signature policy has a globally unique\n\
    \   reference, which is bound to an electronic signature by the signer as\n  \
    \ part of the signature calculation.\n   The signature policy needs to be available\
    \ in human readable form so\n   that it can be assessed to meet the requirements\
    \ of the legal and\n   contractual context in which it is being applied.  To facilitate\
    \ the\n   automatic processing of an electronic signature, the parts of the\n\
    \   signature policy, which specify the electronic rules for the creation\n  \
    \ and validation of the electronic signature, also need to be\n   comprehensively\
    \ defined and in a computer-processable form.\n   The signature policy thus includes\
    \ the following:\n      - rules that apply to technical validation of a particular\n\
    \        signature;\n      - rules that may be implied through adoption of Certificate\n\
    \        Policies that apply to the electronic signature (e.g., rules for\n  \
    \      ensuring the secrecy of the private signing key);\n      - rules that relate\
    \ to the environment used by the signer, e.g.,\n        the use of an agreed CAD\
    \ (Card Accepting Device) used in\n        conjunction with a smart card.\n  \
    \ For example, the major rules required for technical validation can\n   include:\n\
    \      - recognized root keys or \"top-level certification authorities\";\n  \
    \    - acceptable certificate policies (if any);\n      - necessary certificate\
    \ extensions and values (if any);\n      - the need for the revocation status\
    \ for each component of the\n        certification tree;\n      - acceptable TSAs\
    \ (if time-stamp tokens are being used);\n      - acceptable organizations for\
    \ keeping the audit trails with\n        time-marks (if time-marking is being\
    \ used);\n      - acceptable AAs (if any are being used),and;\n      - rules defining\
    \ the components of the electronic signature that\n        shall be provided by\
    \ the signer with data required by the\n        verifier when required to provide\
    \ long-term proof.\n"

  contents:
  - "C.3.1.  Reference to the Signature Policy\n   When two independent parties want\
    \ to evaluate an electronic\n   signature, it is fundamental that they get the\
    \ same result.  This\n   requirement can be met using comprehensive signature\
    \ policies that\n   ensure consistency of signature validation.  Signature policies\
    \ can\n   be identified implicitly by the data being signed, or they can be\n\
    \   explicitly identified using the CAdES-EPES form of electronic\n   signature;\
    \ the CAdES-EPES mandates a consistent signature policy must\n   be used by both\
    \ the signer and verifier.\n   By signing over the Signature Policy Identifier\
    \ in the CAdES-EPES,\n   the signer explicitly indicates that he or she has applied\
    \ the\n   signature policy in creating the signature.\n   In order to unambiguously\
    \ identify the details of an explicit\n   signature policy that is to be used\
    \ to verify a CAdES-EPES, the\n   signature, an identifier, and hash of the \"\

- title: C.3.2.  Commitment Type Indication
  contents:
  - "C.3.2.  Commitment Type Indication\n   The commitment type can be indicated in\
    \ the electronic signature\n   either:\n      - explicitly using a \"commitment\
    \ type indication\" in the\n        electronic signature;\n      - implicitly\
    \ or explicitly from the semantics of the signed data.\n   If the indicated commitment\
    \ type is explicit using a \"commitment type\n   indication\" in the electronic\
    \ signature, acceptance of a verified\n   signature implies acceptance of the\
    \ semantics of that commitment\n   type.  The semantics of explicit commitment\
    \ type indications may be\n   subject to signer and verifier agreement, specified\
    \ as part of the\n   signature policy or registered for generic use across multiple\n\
    \   policies.\n   If a CAdES-EPES electronic signature format is used and the\n\
    \   electronic signature includes a commitment type indication other than\n  \
    \ one of those recognized under the signature policy, the signature\n   shall\
    \ be treated as invalid.\n   How commitment is indicated using the semantics of\
    \ the data being\n   signed is outside the scope of the present document.\n  \
    \    NOTE: Examples of commitment indicated through the semantics of\n      the\
    \ data being signed are:\n      - an explicit commitment made by the signer indicated\
    \ by the type\n        of data being signed over.  Thus, the data structure being\n\
    \        signed can have an explicit commitment within the context of the\n  \
    \      application (e.g., EDIFACT purchase order);\n      - an implicit commitment\
    \ that is a commitment made by the signer\n        because the data being signed\
    \ over has specific semantics\n        (meaning), which is only interpretable\
    \ by humans, (i.e., free\n        text).\n"
- title: C.3.3.  Certificate Identifier from the Signer
  contents:
  - "C.3.3.  Certificate Identifier from the Signer\n   In many real-life environments,\
    \ users will be able to get from\n   different CAs or even from the same CA, different\
    \ certificates\n   containing the same public key for different names.  The prime\n\
    \   advantage is that a user can use the same private key for different\n   purposes.\
    \  Multiple use of the private key is an advantage when a\n   smart card is used\
    \ to protect the private key, since the storage of a\n   smart card is always\
    \ limited.  When several CAs are involved, each\n   different certificate may\
    \ contain a different identity, e.g., as a\n   citizen of a nation or as an employee\
    \ from a company.  Thus, when a\n   private key is used for various purposes,\
    \ the certificate is needed\n   to clarify the context in which the private key\
    \ was used when\n   generating the signature.  Where there is the possibility\
    \ that\n   multiple private keys are used, it is necessary for the signer to\n\
    \   indicate to the verifier the precise certificate to be used.\n   Many current\
    \ schemes simply add the certificate after the signed data\n   and thus are vulnerable\
    \ to substitution attacks.  If the certificate\n   from the signer was simply\
    \ appended to the signature and thus not\n   protected by the signature, anyone\
    \ could substitute one certificate\n   for another, and the message would appear\
    \ to be signed by someone\n   else.  In order to counter this kind of attack,\
    \ the identifier of the\n   signer has to be protected by the digital signature\
    \ from the signer.\n   In order to unambiguously identify the certificate to be\
    \ used for the\n   verification of the signature, an identifier of the certificate\
    \ from\n   the signer shall be part of the signed data.\n"
- title: C.3.4.  Role Attributes
  contents:
  - "C.3.4.  Role Attributes\n   While the name of the signer is important, the position\
    \ of the signer\n   within a company or an organization is of paramount importance\
    \ as\n   well.  Some information (i.e., a contract) may only be valid if\n   signed\
    \ by a user in a particular role, e.g., a Sales Director.  In\n   many cases,\
    \ who the sales Director really is, is not that important,\n   but being sure\
    \ that the signer is empowered by his company to be the\n   Sales Director is\
    \ fundamental.\n   The present document defines two different ways for providing\
    \ this\n   feature:\n      - by placing a claimed role name in the CMS signed\
    \ attributes\n        field;\n      - by placing an attribute certificate containing\
    \ a certified role\n        name in the CMS signed attributes field.\n      NOTE:\
    \ Another possible approach would have been to use additional\n      attributes\
    \ containing the roles name(s) in the signer's identity\n      certificate.  However,\
    \ it was decided not to follow this approach\n      as it significantly complicates\
    \ the management of certificates.\n      For example, by using separate certificates\
    \ for the signer's\n      identity and roles means new identity keys need not\
    \ be issued if a\n      user's role changes.\n"

- title: C.3.4.2.  Certified Role
  contents:
  - "C.3.4.2.  Certified Role\n   Unlike public key certificates that bind an identifier\
    \ to a public\n   key, Attribute Certificates bind the identifier of a certificate\
    \ to\n   some attributes, like a role.  An Attribute Certificate is NOT issued\n\
    \   by a CA but by an Attribute Authority (AA).  The Attribute Authority,\n  \
    \ in most cases, might be under the control of an organization or a\n   company\
    \ that is best placed to know which attributes are relevant for\n   which individual.\
    \  The Attribute Authority may use or point to public\n   key certificates issued\
    \ by any CA, provided that the appropriate\n   trust may be placed in that CA.\
    \  Attribute Certificates may have\n   various periods of validity.  That period\
    \ may be quite short, e.g.,\n   one day.  While this requires that a new Attribute\
    \ Certificate be\n   obtained every day, valid for that day, this can be advantageous\n\
    \   since revocation of such certificates may not be needed.  When\n   signing,\
    \ the signer will have to specify which Attribute Certificate\n   it selects.\
    \  In order to do so, the Attribute Certificate will have\n   to be included in\
    \ the signed data in order to be protected by the\n   digital signature from the\
    \ signer.\n   In order to unambiguously identify the attribute certificate(s)\

- title: C.3.6.  Signing Time
  contents:
  - "C.3.6.  Signing Time\n   The present document provides the capability to include\

  contents:
  - "C.4.3.  Time-Stamping for Long Life of Signatures\n   An important property for\
    \ long-standing signatures is that a\n   signature, having been found once to\
    \ be valid, shall continue to be\n   so months or years later.\n   A signer, verifier,\
    \ or both may be required to provide, on request,\n   proof that a digital signature\
    \ was created or verified during the\n   validity period of all the certificates\
    \ that make up the certificate\n   path.  In this case, the signer, verifier,\
    \ or both will also be\n   required to provide proof that the signer's certificate\
    \ and all the\n   CA certificates used to form a valid certification path were\
    \ not\n   revoked when the signature was created or verified.\n   It would be\
    \ quite unacceptable to consider a signature as invalid\n   even if the keys or\
    \ certificates were later compromised.  Thus, there\n   is a need to be able to\
    \ demonstrate that the signature keys were\n   valid at the time that the signature\
    \ was created to provide long-term\n   evidence of the validity of a signature.\n\
    \   It could be the case that a certificate was valid at the time of the\n   signature\
    \ but revoked some time later.  In this event, evidence shall\n   be provided\
    \ that the document was signed before the signing key was\n   revoked.  Time-stamping\
    \ by a Time-Stamping Authority (TSA) can\n   provide such evidence.  A time-stamp\
    \ is obtained by sending the hash\n   value of the given data to the TSA.  The\
    \ returned \"time-stamp\" is a\n   signed document that contains the hash value,\
    \ the identity of the\n   TSA, and the time of stamping.  This proves that the\
    \ given data\n   existed before the time of stamping.  Time-stamping a digital\n\
    \   signature (by sending a hash of the signature to the TSA) before the\n   revocation\
    \ of the signer's private key provides evidence that the\n   signature had been\
    \ created before the certificate was revoked.\n   If a recipient wants to hold\
    \ a valid electronic signature, he will\n   have to ensure that he has obtained\
    \ a valid time-stamp for it before\n   that key (and any key involved in the validation)\
    \ is revoked.  The\n   sooner the time-stamp is obtained after the signing time,\
    \ the better.\n   Any time-stamp or time-mark that is taken after the expiration\
    \ date\n   of any certificate in the certification path has no value in proving\n\
    \   the validity of a signature.\n   It is important to note that signatures may\
    \ be generated \"off-line\"\n   and time-stamped at a later time by anyone, for\
    \ example, by the\n   signer or any recipient interested in the value of the signature.\n\
    \   The time-stamp can thus be provided by the signer, together with the\n   signed\
    \ document, or obtained by the recipient following receipt of\n   the signed document.\n\
    \   The time-stamp is NOT a component of the Basic Electronic Signature,\n   but\
    \ it is the essential component of the ES with Time.\n   It is required, in the\
    \ present document, that if a signer's digital\n   signature value is to be time-stamped,\
    \ the time-stamp token is issued\n   by a trusted source, known as a Time-Stamping\
    \ Authority.\n   The present document requires that the signer's digital signature\n\
    \   value be time-stamped by a trusted source before the electronic\n   signature\
    \ can become an ES with Complete validation data.  Acceptable\n   TSAs may be\
    \ specified in a Signature Validation Policy.\n   This technique is referred to\
    \ as CAdES-C in the present document.\n   Should both the signer and verifier\
    \ be required to time-stamp the\n   signature value to meet the requirements of\
    \ the signature policy, the\n   signature policy may specify a permitted time\

    \ in\n   particular that response in the case the key from the responder would\n\
    \   be compromised.  Since the information contained in the OCSP response\n  \
    \ is user specific and time specific, an individual time-stamp is\n   needed for\
    \ every signature received.  Instead of placing the\n   time-stamp only over the\
    \ certification path references and revocation\n   information references, which\
    \ include the OCSP response, the\n   time-stamp is placed on the CAdES-C.  Since\

    \ the weakened cryptography.  In\n   order to simplify matters, a single technique\
    \ called Archive\n   validation data, covering all the cases, is being used in\
    \ the present\n   document.\n   Archive validation data consists of the validation\

    \ time-stamps of the Archived Electronic Signature\n   are required.\n   The potential\
    \ for a Trusted Service Provider (TSP) key compromise\n   should be significantly\

  contents:
  - "F.1.  Use of MIME to Encode Data\n   The signed content may be structured using\
    \ MIME (Multipurpose\n   Internet Mail Extensions -- RFC 2045 [6]).  Whilst the\
    \ MIME structure\n   was initially developed for Internet email, it has a number\
    \ of\n   features that make it useful to provide a common structure for\n   encoding\
    \ a range of electronic documents and other multi-media data\n   (e.g., photographs,\
    \ video).  These features include:\n      - providing a means of signalling the\
    \ type of \"object\" being\n        carried (e.g., text, image, ZIP file, application\
    \ data);\n      - providing a means of associating a file name with an object;\n\
    \      - associating several independent objects (e.g., a document and\n     \
    \   image) to form a multi-part object;\n      - handling  data encoded in text\
    \ or binary and, if necessary,\n        re-encoding the binary as text.\n   When\
    \ encoding a single object, MIME consists of:\n      - header information, followed\
    \ by;\n      - encoded content.\n   This structure can be extended to support\
    \ multi-part content.\n"
- title: F.1.1.  Header Information
  contents:
  - "F.1.1.  Header Information\n   A MIME header includes:\n   MIME Version information:\
    \ e.g., MIME-Version: 1.0\n   Content type information, which includes information\
    \ describing the\n   content sufficient for it to be presented to a user or application\n\
    \   process, as required.  This includes information on the \"media type\"\n \
    \  (e.g., text, image, audio) or whether the data is for passing to a\n   particular\
    \ type of application.  In the case of text, the content\n   type includes information\
    \ on the character set used, e.g.,\n   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\
    .\n   Content-encoding information, which defines how the content is\n   encoded\
    \ (see below about encoding supported by MIME).\n   Other information about the\
    \ content, such as a description or an\n   associated file name.\n   An example\
    \ MIME header for text object is:\n   Mime-Version: 1.0\n   Content-Type: text/plain;\
    \ charset=ISO-8859-1\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n   An example\
    \ MIME header for a binary file containing a pdf document\n   is:\n   Content-Type:\
    \ application/pdf\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n   Content-Description:\
    \ JCFV201.pdf\n   Content-Disposition: filename=\"JCFV201.pdf\"\n"
- title: F.1.2.  Content Encoding
  contents:
  - "F.1.2.  Content Encoding\n   MIME supports a range of mechanisms for encoding\
    \ both text and binary\n   data.\n   Text data can be carried transparently as\
    \ lines of text data encoded\n   in 7- or 8-bit ASCII characters.  MIME also includes\
    \ a\n   \"quoted-printable\" encoding that converts characters other than the\n\
    \   basic ASCII into an ASCII sequence.\n   Binary can either be carried:\n  \
    \    - transparently as 8-bit octets; or\n      - converted to a basic set of\
    \ characters using a system called\n        Base64.\n      NOTE: As there are\
    \ some mail relays that can only handle 7-bit\n      ASCII, Base64 encoding is\
    \ usually used on the Internet.\n"
- title: F.1.3.  Multi-Part Content
  contents:
  - "F.1.3.  Multi-Part Content\n   Several objects (e.g., text and a file attachment)\
    \ can be associated\n   together using a special \"multi-part\" content type.\
    \  This is\n   indicated by the content type \"multipart\" with an indication\
    \ of the\n   string to be used indicating a separation between each part.\n  \
    \ In addition to a header for the overall multipart content, each part\n   includes\
    \ its own header information indicating the inner content type\n   and encoding.\n\

  - "H.1.  Data Framing\n   In order to be able to use either of these APIs, it will\
    \ be necessary\n   to frame the previously defined electronic signature data structures\n\
    \   using a mechanism-independent token format.  Section 3.1 of RFC 2743\n   [RFC2743]\
    \ specifies a mechanism-independent level of encapsulating\n   representation\
    \ for the initial token of a GSS-API context\n   establishment sequence, incorporating\
    \ an identifier of the mechanism\n   type to be used on that context and enabling\
    \ tokens to be interpreted\n   unabmiguously.\n   In order to be processable by\
    \ these APIs, all electronic signature\n   data formats that are defined in the\
    \ present document shall be framed\n   following that description.\n   The encoding\
    \ format for the token tag is derived from ASN.1 and DER,\n   but its concrete\
    \ representation is defined directly in terms of\n   octets rather than at the\
    \ ASN.1 level, in order to facilitate\n   interoperable implementation without\
    \ use of general ASN.1 processing\n   code.  The token tag consists of the following\
    \ elements, in order:\n      1) 0x60 -- Tag for RFC 2743 SEQUENCE; indicates that\
    \ constructed\n         form, definite length encoding follows.\n      2) Token-length\
    \ octets, specifying length of subsequent data\n         (i.e., the summed lengths\
    \ of elements 3 to 5 in this list, and\n         of the mechanism-defined token\
    \ object following the tag).  This\n         element comprises a variable number\
    \ of octets:\n         a) If the indicated value is less than 128, it shall be\n\
    \            represented in a single octet with bit 8 (high order) set to\n  \
    \          \"0\" and the remaining bits representing the value.\n         b) If\
    \ the indicated value is 128 or more, it shall be\n            represented in\
    \ two or more octets, with bit 8 of the first\n            octet set to \"1\"\
    \ and the remaining bits of the first octet\n            specifying the number\
    \ of additional octets.  The subsequent\n            octets carry the value, 8\
    \ bits per octet, with the most\n            significant digit first.  The minimum\
    \ number of octets shall\n            be used to encode the length (i.e., no octets\
    \ representing\n            leading zeros shall be included within the length\
    \ encoding).\n      3) 0x06 -- Tag for OBJECT IDENTIFIER.\n      4) Object identifier\
    \ length -- length (number of octets) of the\n         encoded object identifier\
    \ contained in element 5, encoded per\n         rules as described in 2a) and\
    \ 2b) above.\n      5) object identifier octets -- variable number of octets,\
    \ encoded\n         per ASN.1 BER rules:\n         - The first octet contains\
    \ the sum of two values:\n            (1) the top-level object identifier component,\
    \ multiplied by\n                40 (decimal); and\n            (2) the second-level\
    \ object identifier component.\n                This special case is the only\
    \ point within an object\n                identifier encoding where a single octet\
    \ represents\n                contents of more than one component.\n         \
    \   - Subsequent octets, if required, encode successively lower\n            \
    \  components in the represented object identifier.  A\n              component's\
    \ encoding may span multiple octets, encoding 7\n              bits per octet\
    \ (most significant bits first) and with bit\n              8 set to \"1\" on\
    \ all but the final octet in the component's\n              encoding.  The minimum\
    \ number of octets shall be used to\n              encode each component (i.e.,\
    \ no octets representing\n              leading zeros shall be included within\
    \ a component's\n              encoding).\n      NOTE: In many implementations,\
    \ elements 3 to 5 may be stored and\n      referenced as a contiguous string constant.\n\
    \   The token tag is immediately followed by a mechanism-defined token\n   object.\
    \  Note that no independent size specifier intervenes following\n   the object\
    \ identifier value to indicate the size of the\n   mechanism-defined token object.\n\
    \   Tokens conforming to the present document shall have the following\n   OID\
    \ in order to be processable by IDUP-APIs:\n   id-etsi-es-IDUP-Mechanism-v1 OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER ::=\n    { itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0)\n     electronic-signature-standard\

  contents:
  - "H.2.  IDUP-GSS-APIs Defined by the IETF\n   The IETF CAT WG produced, in December\
    \ 1998, an RFC (RFC 2479\n   [RFC2479]) under the name of IDUP-GSS-API (Independent\
    \ Data Unit\n   Protection) able to handle the electronic signature data format\n\
    \   defined in the present document.\n   The IDUP-GSS-API includes support for\
    \ non-repudiation services.\n   It supports evidence generation, where \"evidence\"\
    \ is information that\n   either by itself, or when used in conjunction with other\
    \ information,\n   is used to establish proof about an event or action, as well\
    \ as\n   evidence verification.\n   IDUP supports various types of evidences.\
    \  All the types defined in\n   IDUP are supported in the present document through\
    \ the\n   commitment-type parameter.\n   Section 2.3.3 of IDUP describes the specific\
    \ calls needed to handle\n   evidence (\"EV\" calls).  The \"EV\" group of calls\
    \ provides a simple,\n   high-level interface to underlying IDUP mechanisms when\
    \ application\n   developers need to deal with only evidence: not with encryption\
    \ or\n   integrity services.\n   All generations and verification are performed\
    \ according to the\n   content of a NR policy that is referenced in the context.\n\
    \   Get_token_details is used to return the attributes that correspond to\n  \
    \ a given input token to an application.  Since IDUP-GSS-API tokens are\n   meant\
    \ to be opaque to the calling application, this function allows\n   the application\
    \ to determine information about the token without\n   having to violate the opaqueness\
    \ intention of IDUP.  Of primary\n   importance is the mechanism type, which the\
    \ application can then use\n   as input to the IDUP_Establish_Env() call in order\
    \ to establish the\n   correct environment in which to have the token processed.\n\
    \   Generate_token generates a non-repudiation token using the current\n   environment.\n\
    \   Verify_evidence verifies the evidence token using the current\n   environment.\
    \  This operation returns a major_status code that can be\n   used to determine\
    \ whether the evidence contained in a token is\n   complete (i.e., can be successfully\
    \ verified (perhaps years) later).\n   If a token's evidence is not complete,\
    \ the token can be passed to\n   another API, form_complete_pidu, to complete\
    \ it.  This happens when a\n   status \"conditionally valid\" is returned.  That\
    \ status corresponds to\n   the status \"validation incomplete\" of the present\
    \ document.\n   Form_complete_PIDU is used primarily when the evidence token itself\n\
    \   does not contain all the data required for its verification, and it\n   is\
    \ anticipated that some of the data not stored in the token may\n   become unavailable\
    \ during the interval between generation of the\n   evidence token and verification\
    \ unless it is stored in the token.\n   The Form_Complete_PIDU operation gathers\
    \ the missing information and\n   includes it in the token so that verification\
    \ can be guaranteed to be\n   possible at any future time.\n"

    \   The name allocated by an RA is based on registration information\n   provided\
    \ by, or relating to, the applicant (e.g., his personal name,\n   date of birth,\
    \ residence address) and information allocated by the\n   RA. Three variations\
    \ commonly exist:\n      - the name is based entirely on registration information,\
    \ which\n        uniquely identifies the applicant (e.g., \"Pierre Durand (born\n\
    \        on) July 6, 1956\");\n      - the name is based on registration information,\
    \ with the addition\n        of qualifiers added by the registration authority\
    \ to ensure\n        uniqueness (e.g., \"Pierre Durand 12\");\n      - the registration\
    \ information is kept private by the registration\n        authority and the registration\
    \ authority allocates a\n        \"pseudonym\".\n"

  - "J.2.  Providing Access to Registration Information\n   Under certain circumstances,\
    \ it may be necessary for information used\n   during registration, but not published\
    \ in the certificate, to be made\n   available to third parties (e.g., to an arbitrator\
    \ to resolve a\n   dispute or for law enforcement).  This registration information\
    \ is\n   likely to include personal and sensitive information.\n   Thus, the RA\
    \ needs to establish a policy for:\n         - whether the registration information\
    \ should be disclosed;\n         - to whom such information should be disclosed;\n\
    \         - under what circumstances such information should be\n           disclosed.\n\
    \   This policy may be different whether the RA is being used only within\n  \
    \ a company or for public use.  The policy will have to take into\n   account\
    \ national legislation and in particular any data protection\n   and privacy legislation.\n\
    \   Currently, the provision of access to registration is a local matter\n   for\
    \ the RA.  However, if open access is required, standard protocols,\n   such as\
    \ HTTP -- RFC 2068 (Internet Web Access Protocol), may be\n   employed with the\
    \ addition of security mechanisms necessary to meet\n   the data protection requirements\
    \ (e.g., Transport Layer Security --\n   RFC 4346 [RFC4346]) with client authentication.\n"

  - "J.3.1.  Naming Schemes for Individual Citizens\n   In some cases, the subject\
    \ name that is contained in a public key\n   certificate may not be meaningful\
    \ enough.  This may happen because of\n   the existence of homonyms or because\
    \ of the use of pseudonyms.  A\n   distinction could be made if more attributes\
    \ were present.  However,\n   adding more attributes to a public key certificate\
    \ placed in a public\n   repository would be going against the privacy protection\n\
    \   requirements.\n   In any case, the Registration Authority will get information\
    \ at the\n   time of registration, but not all that information will be placed\
    \ in\n   the certificate.  In order to achieve a balance between these two\n \
    \  opposite requirements, the hash values of some additional attributes\n   can\
    \ be placed in a public key certificate.  When the certificate\n   owner provides\
    \ these additional attributes, then they can be\n   verified.  Using biometrics\
    \ attributes may unambiguously identify a\n   person.  Examples of biometrics\
    \ attributes that can be used include:\n   a picture or a manual signature from\
    \ the certificate owner.\n      NOTE: Using hash values protects privacy only\
    \ if the possible\n      inputs are large enough.  For example, using the hash\
    \ of a\n      person's social security number is generally not sufficient since\n\
    \      it can easily be reversed.\n   A picture can be used if the verifier once\
    \ met the person and later\n   on wants to verify that the certificate that he\
    \ or she got relates to\n   the person whom was met.  In such a case, at the first\
    \ exchange, the\n   picture is sent, and the hash contained in the certificate\
    \ may be\n   used by the verifier to verify that it is the right person.  At the\n\
    \   next exchange, the picture does not need to be sent again.\n   A manual signature\
    \ may be used if a signed document has been received\n   beforehand.  In such\
    \ a case, at the first exchange, the drawing of\n   the manual signature is sent,\
    \ and the hash contained in the\n   certificate may be used by the verifier to\
    \ verify that it is the\n   right manual signature.  At the next exchange, the\
    \ manual signature\n   does not need to be sent again.\n"
- title: J.3.2.  Naming Schemes for Employees of an Organization

  - "J.3.2.  Naming Schemes for Employees of an Organization\n   The name of an employee\
    \ within an organization is likely to be some\n   combination of the name of the\
    \ organization and the identifier of the\n   employee within that organization.\n\
    \   An organization name is usually a registered name, i.e., business or\n   trading\
    \ name used in day-to-day business.  This name is registered by\n   a Naming Authority,\
    \ which guarantees that the organization's\n   registered name is unambiguous\
    \ and cannot be confused with another\n   organization.\n   In order to get more\
    \ information about a given registered\n   organization name, it is necessary\
    \ to go back to a publicly available\n   directory maintained by the Naming Authority.\n\
    \   The identifier may be a name or a pseudonym (e.g., a nickname or an\n   employee\
    \ number).  When it is a name, it is supposed to be\n   descriptive enough to\
    \ unambiguously identify the person.  When it is\n   a pseudonym, the certificate\
    \ does not disclose the identity of the\n   person.  However, it ensures that\
    \ the person has been correctly\n   authenticated at the time of registration\
    \ and therefore may be\n   eligible to some advantages implicitly or explicitly\
    \ obtained through\n   the possession of the certificate.  In either case, however,\
    \ this can\n   be insufficient because of the existence of homonyms.\n   Placing\
    \ more attributes in the certificate may be one solution, for\n   example, by\
    \ giving the organization unit of the person or the name of\n   a city where the\
    \ office is located.  However, the more information is\n   placed in the certificate,\
    \ the more problems arise if there is a\n   change in the organization structure\
    \ or the place of work.  So this\n   may not be the best solution.  An alternative\
    \ is to provide more\n   attributes (like the organization unit and the place\
    \ of work) through\n   access to a directory maintained by the company.  It is\
    \ likely that,\n   at the time of registration, the Registration Authority got\
    \ more\n   information than what was placed in the certificate, if such\n   additional\
    \ information is placed in a repository accessible only to\n   the organization.\n"
