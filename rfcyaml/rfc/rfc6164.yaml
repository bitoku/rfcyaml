  - "Abstract\n   On inter-router point-to-point links, it is useful, for security
    and\n   other reasons, to use 127-bit IPv6 prefixes.  Such a practice\n   parallels
    the use of 31-bit prefixes in IPv4.  This document\n   specifies the motivation
    for, and usages of, 127-bit IPv6 prefix\n   lengths on inter-router point-to-point
    links.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4291] specifies that interface IDs for all unicast addresses,\n
    \  except those that start with the binary value 000, are required to be\n   64
    bits long and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64 format.  In\n   addition, it
    defines the Subnet-Router anycast address, which is\n   intended to be used for
    applications where a node needs to\n   communicate with any one of the set of
    routers on a link.\n   Some operators have been using 127-bit prefixes, but this
    has been\n   discouraged due to conflicts with Subnet-Router anycast [RFC3627].\n
    \  However, using 64-bit prefixes creates security issues that are\n   particularly
    problematic on inter-router links, and there are other\n   valid reasons to use
    prefixes longer than 64 bits, in particular /127\n   (see Section 5).\n   This
    document provides a rationale for using 127-bit prefix lengths,\n   reevaluates
    the reasons why doing so was considered harmful, and\n   specifies how /127 prefixes
    can be used on inter-router links\n   configured for use as point-to-point links.\n"

  - "2.  Scope of This Memo\n   This document is applicable to cases where operators
    assign specific\n   addresses on inter-router point-to-point links and do not
    rely on\n   link-local addresses.  Many operators assign specific addresses for\n
    \  the purposes of network monitoring, reverse DNS resolution for\n   traceroute
    and other management tools, External Border Gateway\n   Protocol (EBGP) [RFC4271]
    peering sessions, and so on.\n   For the purposes of this document, an inter-router
    point-to-point\n   link is a link to which only two routers and no hosts are attached.\n
    \  This may include Ethernet links that are configured to be point-to-\n   point.
    \ Links between a router and a host, or links to which both\n   routers and hosts
    are attached, are out of scope of this document.\n   The recommendations in this
    document do not apply to the link-local\n   address scope.\n"

  - "4.  Problems Identified with 127-Bit Prefix Lengths in the Past\n   [RFC3627]
    discourages the use of 127-bit prefix lengths due to\n   conflicts with the Subnet-Router
    anycast addresses, while stating\n   that the utility of Subnet-Router anycast
    for point-to-point links is\n   questionable.\n   [RFC5375] also says the usage
    of 127-bit prefix lengths is not valid\n   and should be strongly discouraged,
    but the stated reason for doing\n   this is to be in compliance with [RFC3627].\n
    \  Though the analyses in the RFCs are correct, operational experience\n   with
    IPv6 has shown that /127 prefixes can be used successfully.\n"
  title: 4.  Problems Identified with 127-Bit Prefix Lengths in the Past
- contents:
  - "5.  Reasons for Using Longer Prefixes\n   There are reasons network operators
    use IPv6 prefix lengths greater\n   than 64, particularly 127, for inter-router
    point-to-point links.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Ping-Pong Issue\n   A forwarding loop may occur on a point-to-point link
      with a prefix\n   length shorter than 127.  This does not affect interfaces
      that\n   perform Neighbor Discovery, but some point-to-point links, which use\n
      \  a medium such as the Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), do not use\n   Neighbor
      Discovery.  As a consequence, configuring any prefix length\n   shorter than
      127 bits on these links can create an attack vector in\n   the network.\n   The
      ping-pong issue happens in the case of IPv4 as well.  But due to\n   the scarcity
      of IPv4 address space, the current practice is to assign\n   long prefix lengths
      such as /30 or /31 [RFC3021] on point-to-point\n   links; thus, the problem
      did not come to the fore.\n   The latest ICMPv6 specification [RFC4443] mitigates
      this problem by\n   specifying that a router receiving a packet on a point-to-point
      link,\n   where the packet is destined to an address within a subnet assigned\n
      \  to that same link (other than one of the receiving router's own\n   addresses),
      MUST NOT forward the packet back on that link.  Instead,\n   it SHOULD generate
      an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message (code 3)\n   in response.  This check
      is on the forwarding processing path, so it\n   may have performance impact.\n"
    title: 5.1.  Ping-Pong Issue
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Neighbor Cache Exhaustion Issue\n   As described in Section 4.3.2 of
      [RFC3756], the use of a 64-bit\n   prefix length on an inter-router link that
      uses Neighbor Discovery\n   (e.g., Ethernet) potentially allows for denial-of-service
      attacks on\n   the routers on the link.\n   Consider an Ethernet link between
      two routers, A and B, to which a\n   /64 subnet has been assigned.  A packet
      sent to any address on the\n   /64 (except the addresses of A and B) will cause
      the router\n   attempting to forward it to create a new cache entry in INCOMPLETE\n
      \  state, send a Neighbor Solicitation message on the link, start a\n   retransmit
      timer, and so on [RFC4861].\n   By sending a continuous stream of packets to
      a large number of the\n   2^64 - 3 unassigned addresses on the link (one for
      each router and\n   one for Subnet-Router anycast), an attacker can create a
      large number\n   of neighbor cache entries and cause one of the routers to send
      a\n   large number of Neighbor Solicitation packets that will never receive\n
      \  replies, thereby consuming large amounts of memory and processing\n   resources.
      \ Sending the packets to one of the 2^24 addresses on the\n   link that has
      the same Solicited-Node multicast address as one of the\n   routers also causes
      the victim to spend large amounts of processing\n   time discarding useless
      Neighbor Solicitation messages.\n   Careful implementation and rate-limiting
      can limit the impact of such\n   an attack, but are unlikely to neutralize it
      completely.  Rate-\n   limiting Neighbor Solicitation messages will reduce CPU
      usage, and\n   following the garbage-collection recommendations in [RFC4861]
      will\n   maintain reachability, but if the link is down and neighbor cache\n
      \  entries have expired while the attack is ongoing, legitimate traffic\n   (for
      example, BGP sessions) over the link might never be\n   re-established, because
      the routers cannot resolve each others' IPv6\n   addresses to link-layer addresses.\n
      \  This attack is not specific to point-to-point links, but is\n   particularly
      harmful in the case of point-to-point backbone links,\n   which may carry large
      amounts of traffic to many destinations over\n   long distances.\n   While there
      are a number of ways to mitigate this kind of issue,\n   assigning /127 subnets
      eliminates it completely.\n"

  - contents:
    - "5.3.  Other Reasons\n   Though address space conservation considerations are
      less important\n   for IPv6 than they are in IPv4, some operators prefer not
      to assign\n   /64s to individual point-to-point links.  Instead, they may be
      able\n   to number all of their point-to-point links out of a single /64 or
      a\n   small number of /64s.\n"
    title: 5.3.  Other Reasons
  title: 5.  Reasons for Using Longer Prefixes
- contents:
  - "6.  Recommendations\n   Routers MUST support the assignment of /127 prefixes
    on point-to-\n   point inter-router links.  Routers MUST disable Subnet-Router
    anycast\n   for the prefix when /127 prefixes are used.\n   When assigning and
    using any /127 prefixes, the following\n   considerations apply.  Some addresses
    have special meanings, in\n   particular addresses corresponding to reserved anycast
    addresses.\n   When assigning prefixes (and addresses) to links, care should be\n
    \  taken to ensure that addresses reserved for such purposes aren't\n   inadvertently
    assigned and used as unicast addresses.  Otherwise,\n   nodes may receive packets
    that they are not intended to receive.\n   Specifically, assuming that a number
    of point-to-point links will be\n   numbered out of a single /64 prefix:\n   (a)
    \ Addresses with all zeros in the rightmost 64 bits SHOULD NOT be\n        assigned
    as unicast addresses, to avoid colliding with the\n        Subnet-Router anycast
    address [RFC4291].\n   (b)  Addresses in which the rightmost 64 bits are assigned
    the\n        highest 128 values (i.e., ffff:ffff:ffff:ff7f to ffff:ffff:ffff:\n
    \       ffff) SHOULD NOT be used as unicast addresses, to avoid\n        colliding
    with reserved subnet anycast addresses [RFC2526].\n"
