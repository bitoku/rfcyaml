- title: Introduction

  - "Introduction\n   We often mention the Internet, and in the press you read about\
    \ the\n   Internet as the prototype of the Information Highway; as a research\n\
    \   tool; as open for business; as not ready for prime time; as a place\n   your\
    \ children might communicate with (pick one) a. strangers, b.\n   teachers, c.\
    \ pornographers, d. other children, e. their parents; as\n   bigger than Poland;\
    \ as smaller than Chicago; as a place to surf; as\n   the biggest hype since Woodstock;\
    \ as a competitive business tool; as\n   the newest thing since sliced bread.\n\
    \   A recent New York Times article quoting one of us as to the current\n   size\
    \ of the Internet has particularly stirred up quite a ruckus.  The\n   exact figures\
    \ attributed to John in the article are not the ones we\n   recommended for such\
    \ use, but the main point of contention is whether\n   the Internet is, as the\
    \ gist of the article said, smaller than many\n   other estimates have said. \
    \ Clearly lots of people really want to\n   believe that the Internet is very\
    \ large.  Succeeding discussion has\n   shown that some want to believe that so\
    \ much that they want to count\n   computers and people that are probably *going\
    \ to be* connected some\n   time in the future, even if they are not actually\
    \ connected now.  We\n   prefer to talk about who is actually on the Internet\
    \ and on other\n   networks now.  We'll get back to the sizes of the various networks\n\
    \   later, but for now let's discuss a more basic issue that is at the\n   heart\
    \ of much confusion and contention about sizes: what is the\n   Internet, anyway?\n"
- title: Starting at the Center
  contents:
  - "Starting at the Center\n   For real confusion, start trying to get agreement\
    \ on what is part of\n   the Internet:  NSFNET?  CIX?  Your company's internal\
    \ network?\n   Prodigy?  FidoNet?  The mainframe in accounting?  Some people would\n\
    \   include all of the above, and perhaps even consider excluding\n   anything\
    \ politically incorrect.  Others have cast doubts on each of\n   the above.\n\
    \   Let's start some place almost everyone would agree is on the\n   Internet.\
    \  Take RIPE, for example.  The acronym stands for European\n   IP Networks. \
    \ RIPE is a coordinating group for IP networking in\n   Europe.  (IP is the Internet\
    \ protocol, which is the basis of the\n   Internet.  IP has a suite of associated\
    \ protocols, including the\n   Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, and the\
    \ name IP, or sometimes\n   TCP/IP, is often used to refer to the whole protocol\
    \ suite.) RIPE's\n   computers are physically located in Amsterdam.  The important\
    \ feature\n   of RIPE for our purposes is that you can reach RIPE (usually by\
    \ using\n   its domain, ripe.net) from just about anywhere anyone would agree\
    \ is\n   on the Internet.\n   Reach it with what?  Well, just about any service\
    \ anyone would agree\n   is related to the Internet.  RIPE has a WWW (World Wide\
    \ Web) server,\n   a Gopher server, and an anonymous FTP server.  So they provide\n\
    \   documents and other resources by hypertext, menu browsing, and file\n   retrieval.\
    \  Their personnel use client programs such as Mosaic and\n   Lynx to access other\
    \ people's servers, too, so RIPE is a both\n   distributor and a consumer of resources\
    \ via WWW, Gopher, and FTP.\n   They support TELNET interfaces to some of their\
    \ services, and of\n   course they can TELNET out and log in remotely anywhere\
    \ they have\n   personal login accounts or someone else has an anonymous TELNET\n\
    \   service such a library catalog available.  They also have electronic\n   mail,\
    \ they run some mailing lists, and some of their people read and\n   post news\
    \ articles to USENET newsgroups.\n   WWW, Gopher, FTP, TELNET, mail, lists, and\
    \ news:  that's a pretty\n   characteristic set of major Internet services.  There\
    \ are many more\n   obscure Internet services, but it's pretty safe to say that\
    \ an\n   organization like RIPE that is reachable with all these services is\n\
    \   on the Internet.\n   Reachable from where?  Russia first connected to the\
    \ Internet in\n   1992.  For a while it was reachable from networks in the Commercial\n\
    \   Internet Exchange (CIX) and from various other networks, but not from\n  \
    \ NSFNET, the U.S. National Science Foundation network.  At the time,\n   some\
    \ people considered NSFNET so important that they didn't count\n   Russia as reachable\
    \ because it wasn't accessible through NSFNET.\n   Since there are now several\
    \ other backbone networks in the U.S. as\n   fast (T3 or 45Mbps) as NSFNET, and\
    \ routing through NSFNET isn't very\n   restricted anymore, few people would make\
    \ that distinction anymore.\n   So for the moment let's just say reachable through\
    \ NSFNET or CIX\n   networks, and get back to services.\n"
- title: Looking at Firewalls
  contents:
  - "Looking at Firewalls\n   Many companies and other organizations run networks\
    \ that are\n   deliberately firewalled so that their users can get to servers\
    \ like\n   those at ripe.net, but nobody outside the company network can get to\n\
    \   company hosts.  A user of such a network can thus use WWW, Gopher,\n   FTP,\
    \ and TELNET, but cannot supply resources through these protocols\n   to people\
    \ outside the company.  Since a network that is owned and\n   operated by a company\
    \ in support of its own operations is called an\n   enterprise network, let's\
    \ call these networks enterprise IP networks,\n   since they typically use the\
    \ Internet Protocol (IP) to support these\n   services.  Some companies integrate\
    \ their enterprise IP networks into\n   the Internet without firewalls, but most\
    \ do use firewalls, and those\n   are the ones that are of interest here, since\
    \ they're the ones with\n   one-way access to these Internet services.  Another\
    \ name for an\n   enterprise IP network, with or without firewall, is an enterprise\n\
    \   Internet.\n   For purposes of this distinction between suppliers and consumers,\
    \ it\n   doesn't matter whether the hosts behind the firewall access servers\n\
    \   beyond the firewall by direct IP and TCP connections from their own\n   IP\
    \ addresses, or whether they use proxy application gateways (such as\n   SOCKS)\
    \ at the firewall.  In either case, they can use outside\n   services, but cannot\
    \ supply them.\n   So for services such as WWW, Gopher, FTP, and TELNET, we can\
    \ draw a\n   useful distinction between supplier or distributor computers such\
    \ as\n   those at ripe.net and consumer computers such as those inside\n   firewalled\
    \ enterprise IP networks.  It might seem more obvious to say\n   producer computers\
    \ and consumer computers, since those would be more\n   clearly paired terms.\
    \  However, the information distributed by a\n   supplier computer isn't necessarily\
    \ produced on that computer or\n   within its parent organization.  In fact, most\
    \ of the information on\n   the bigger FTP archive servers is produced elsewhere.\
    \  So we choose\n   to say distributors and consumers.  Stores and shoppers would\
    \ work\n   about as well, if you prefer.\n   Even more useful than discussing\
    \ computers that actually are\n   suppliers or consumers right now may be a distinction\
    \ between\n   supplier-capable computers (not firewalled) and consumer-capable\n\
    \   computers (firewalled).  This is because a computer that is not\n   supplying\
    \ information right now may be capable of doing so as soon as\n   someone puts\
    \ information on it and tells it to supply it.  That is,\n   setting up a WWW,\
    \ Gopher, or FTP server isn't very difficult; much\n   less difficult than getting\
    \ corporate permission to breach a\n   firewall.  Similarly, a computer may not\
    \ be able to retrieve\n   resources by WWW, Gopher, at the moment, since client\
    \ programs for\n   those services usually don't come with the computer or its\
    \ basic\n   software, but almost any computer can be made capable of doing so\
    \ by\n   adding some software.  In both cases, once you've got the basic IP\n\
    \   network connection, adding capabilities for specific services is\n   relatively\
    \ easy.\n   Let's call the non-firewalled computers the core Internet, and the\n\
    \   core plus the consumer-capable computers the consumer Internet.  Some\n  \
    \ people have referred to these two categories as the Backbone Internet\n   and\
    \ the Internet Web.  We find the already existing connotations of\n   \"Backbone\"\
    \ and \"Web\" confusing, so we prefer core Internet and\n   consumer Internet.\n\
    \   It's true that many companies with firewalls have one or two\n   computers\
    \ carefully placed at the firewall so that they can serve\n   resources.  Company\
    \ employees may be able to place resources on these\n   servers, but they can't\
    \ serve resources directly from their own\n   computers.  It's rather like having\
    \ to reserve space on a single\n   company delivery truck, instead of owning one\
    \ yourself.  If you're\n   talking about companies, yes, the company is thus fully\
    \ on the core\n   Internet, yet its users aren't as fully on the Internet as users\
    \ not\n   behind a firewall.\n   If you're just interested in computers that can\
    \ distribute\n   information (maybe you're selling server software), that's a\
    \ much\n   smaller Internet than if you're interested in all the computers that\n\
    \   can retrieve such information for their users (maybe you have\n   information\
    \ you want to distribute).  A few years ago it probably\n   wouldn't have been\
    \ hard to get agreement that firewalled company\n   networks were a different\
    \ kind of thing than the Internet itself.\n   Nowadays, firewalls have become\
    \ so popular that it's hard to find an\n   enterprise IP network that is not firewalled,\
    \ and the total number of\n   hosts on such consumer-capable networks is probably\
    \ almost as large\n   as the number on the supplier-capable core of the Internet.\
    \  So many\n   people now like to include these consumer-capable networks along\
    \ with\n   the supplier-capable core when discussing the Internet.\n   Some people\
    \ claim that you can't measure the number of consumer-\n   capable computers or\
    \ users through measurements taken on the Internet\n   itself.  Perhaps not, but\
    \ you can get an idea of how many actual\n   consumers there are by simply counting\
    \ accesses to selected servers\n   and comparing the results to other known facts\
    \ about the accessing\n   organizations.  And there are other ways to get useful\
    \ information\n   about consumers on the Internet, including asking them.\n"
- title: Mail, Lists, and News
  contents:
  - "Mail, Lists, and News\n   But what about mail, lists, and news?  We carefully\
    \ left those out of\n   the discussion of firewalls, because almost all the firewalled\n\
    \   networks do let these communications services in and out, so there's\n   little\
    \ useful distinction between firewalled and non-firewalled\n   networks on the\
    \ basis of these services.  That's because there's a\n   big difference between\
    \ these communications services and the resource\n   sharing (TELNET, FTP) and\
    \ resource discovery (Gopher, WWW) services\n   that firewalls usually filter.\
    \  The communications services are\n   normally batch, asynchronous, or store-and-forward.\
    \  These\n   characterizations mean more or less the same thing, so pick the one\n\
    \   you like best.  The point is that when you send mail, you compose a\n   message\
    \ and queue it for delivery.  The actual delivery is a separate\n   process; it\
    \ may take seconds or hours, but it is done after you\n   finish composing the\
    \ message, and you normally do not have to wait\n   for the message to be delivered\
    \ before doing something else.  It is\n   not uncommon for a mail system to batch\
    \ up several messages to go\n   through a single network link or to the same destination\
    \ and then\n   deliver them all at once.  And mail doesn't even necessarily go\
    \ to\n   its final destination in one hop; repeated storing at an intermediate\n\
    \   destination followed by forwarding to another computer is common;\n   thus\
    \ the term store-and-forward.  Mailing lists are built on top of\n   the same\
    \ delivery mechanisms as regular electronic mail.  USENET news\n   uses somewhat\
    \ different delivery mechanisms, but ones that are also\n   typically batch, asynchronous,\
    \ and store-and-forward.  Because it is\n   delivered in this manner, a mail message\
    \ or a news article is much\n   less likely to be a security problem than a TELNET,\
    \ FTP, Gopher, or\n   WWW connection.  This is why firewalls usually pass mail,\
    \ lists, and\n   news in both directions, but usually stop incoming connections\
    \ of\n   those interactive protocols.\n   Because WWW, Gopher, TELNET, and FTP\
    \ are basically interactive, you\n   need IP or something like it to support them.\
    \  Because mail, lists,\n   and news are asynchronous, you can support them with\
    \ protocols that\n   are not interactive, such as UUCP and FidoNet.  In fact,\
    \ there are\n   whole networks that do just that, called UUCP and FidoNet, among\n\
    \   others.  These networks carry mail and news, but are not capable of\n   supporting\
    \ TELNET, FTP, Gopher, or WWW.  We don't consider them part\n   of the Internet,\
    \ since they lack the most distinctive and\n   characteristic services of the\
    \ Internet.\n   Some people argue that networks such as FidoNet and UUCP should\
    \ also\n   be counted as being part of the Internet, since electronic mail is\n\
    \   the most-used service even on the core, supplier-capable Internet.\n   They\
    \ further argue that the biggest benefit of the Internet is the\n   community\
    \ of discussion it supports, and mail is enough to join that.\n   Well, if mail\
    \ is enough to be on the Internet, why is the Internet\n   drawing such attention\
    \ from press and new users alike?  Mail has been\n   around for quite a while\
    \ (1972 or 1973), but that's not what has made\n   such an impression on the public.\
    \  What has is the interactive\n   services, and interfaces to them such as Mosaic.\
    \  Asynchronous\n   networks such as FidoNet and UUCP don't support those interactive\n\
    \   services, and are thus not part of the Internet.  Besides, if being\n   part\
    \ of a community of discussion was enough, we would have to also\n   include anyone\
    \ with a fax machine or a telephone.  Recent events have\n   demonstrated that\
    \ all readers of the New York Times would also have\n   to be included.  With\
    \ edges so vague, what would be the point in\n   calling anything the Internet?\
    \  We choose to stick with a definition\n   of the Internet as requiring the interactive\
    \ services.\n   Some people argue that anything that uses RFC-822 mail is therefore\n\
    \   using Internet mail and must be part of the Internet.  We find this\n   about\
    \ as plausible as arguing that anybody who flies in a Boeing 737\n   is using\
    \ American equipment and is thus within the United States.\n   Besides, there\
    \ are plenty of systems out there that use mail but not\n   RFC-822.\n   So what\
    \ to call systems that can exchange mail, but aren't on the\n   Internet?  We\
    \ say they are part of the Matrix, which is all computer\n   systems worldwide\
    \ that can exchange electronic mail.  This term is\n   borrowed (with permission)\
    \ from Bill Gibson, the science fiction\n   writer.\n   Other people refer to\
    \ the Matrix as global E-mail.  That's accurate,\n   but is a description, rather\
    \ than a name.  Some even call it the e-\n   mail Internet.  We find that term\
    \ misleading, since if a system can\n   only exchange mail, we don't consider\
    \ it part of the Internet.  Not\n   to mention not everything in the world defines\
    \ itself in terms of the\n   Internet, or communicates through the Internet. \
    \ FidoNet and WWIVnet,\n   for example, have gateways between themselves that\
    \ have nothing to do\n   with the Internet.  Referring to the Matrix as the Internet\
    \ is rather\n   like referring to the United Kingdom as England.  You may call\
    \ it\n   convenient shorthand; the Scots may disagree.\n   What about news?  Well,\
    \ the set of all systems that exchange news\n   already has a name: USENET.  USENET\
    \ is presumably a subset of the\n   Matrix, since it's hard to imagine a USENET\
    \ node without mail, even\n   though USENET itself is news, not mail.  USENET\
    \ is clearly not the\n   same thing as the Internet, since many (almost certainly\
    \ most)\n   Internet nodes do not carry USENET news, and many USENET nodes are\
    \ on\n   other networks, especially UUCP, FidoNet, and BITNET.\n   A few years\
    \ ago it was popular in some corners of the press to\n   attempt to equate USENET\
    \ and the Internet.  They're clearly not the\n   same.  News, like mail, is an\
    \ asynchronous, batch, store-and-forward\n   service.  The distinguishing services\
    \ of the Internet are\n   interactive, not news.\n"
- title: Asynchronous Compared to Dialup
  contents:
  - "Asynchronous Compared to Dialup\n   Please note that interactive vs. asynchronous\
    \ isn't the same thing as\n   direct vs. dialup connections.  Dialup IP is still\
    \ IP and can support\n   all the usual IP services.  It's true that for the more\
    \ bandwidth-\n   intensive services such as WWW, you'll be a lot happier with\
    \ a *fast*\n   dialup IP connection, but any dialup IP connection can support\
    \ WWW.\n   Some people call these on-demand IP connections, or part-time IP\n\
    \   access.  They're typically supported over SLIP, PPP, ISDN, or perhaps\n  \
    \ even X.25.\n   It's also true that it's a lot easier to run a useful interactive\n\
    \   Internet supplier node if you're at least dialed up most of the time\n   so\
    \ that consumers can reach your node, but you can run servers that\n   are accessible\
    \ over any dialup IP connection whenever it's dialed up.\n   It's true that some\
    \ access providers handle low-end dialup IP\n   connections through a rotary of\
    \ IP addresses, and that's not\n   conducive to running servers, since it's difficult\
    \ for users to know\n   how to reach them.  But given a dedicated IP address,\
    \ how long you\n   stay dialed up is a matter of degree more than of quality.\
    \  A IP\n   connection that's up the great majority of the time is often called\
    \ a\n   dedicated connection regardless of whether it's established by\n   dialing\
    \ a modem or starting software over a hardwired link.\n   It's possible to run\
    \ UUCP over a dedicated IP connection, but it's\n   still UUCP, and still does\
    \ not support interactive services.\n   Some people object to excluding the asynchronous\
    \ networks from a\n   definition of the Internet just because they don't support\
    \ the\n   interactive services.  The argument they make is that FTP, Gopher,\n\
    \   and WWW can be accessed through mail.  This is true, but it's hardly\n   the\
    \ same, and hardly interactive in the same sense as using FTP,\n   Gopher, or\
    \ WWW over an IP connection.  It's rather like saying a\n   mail-order catalog\
    \ is the same as going to the store and buying an\n   item on the spot.  Besides,\
    \ we've yet to see anyone log in remotely\n   by mail.\n"
- title: Is IP Characteristic?
  contents:
  - "Is IP Characteristic?\n   We further choose to define the Internet as being those\
    \ networks that\n   use IP to permit users to use both the communication services\
    \ and at\n   least TELNET and FTP among the interactive services we have listed.\n\
    \   This requirement for IP has been questioned by some on the basis that\n  \
    \ there are now application gateways for other protocol suites such as\n   Novell\
    \ Netware that permit use of such services.  This kind of\n   application gateway\
    \ is actually nothing new, and is not yet\n   widespread.  We choose to think\
    \ of such networks, at least for the\n   moment, as yet another layer of the onion,\
    \ outside the core and\n   consumer layers of the Internet.\n   Others have objected\
    \ to the use of IP as a defining characteristic of\n   the Internet because they\
    \ think it's too technical.  Actually, we\n   find far fewer people confused about\
    \ whether a software package or\n   network supports IP than about whether it's\
    \ part of the Internet or\n   not.\n   Some people point out that services like\
    \ WWW, Gopher, FTP, TELNET,\n   etc.  could easily be implemented on top of other\
    \ protocol suites.\n   This is true, and has been done.  However, people seem\
    \ to forget to\n   ask why these services developed on top of IP in the first\
    \ place.\n   There seems to be something about IP and the Internet that is\n \
    \  especially conducive to the development of new protocols.  We make no\n   apologies\
    \ about naming IP, because we think it is important.\n   There is also the question\
    \ of IP to where?  If you have a UNIX shell\n   login account on a computer run\
    \ by an Internet access provider, and\n   that system has IP access to the rest\
    \ of the Internet, then you are\n   an Internet user.  However, you will not be\
    \ able to use the full\n   graphical capabilities of protocols such as WWW, because\
    \ the\n   provider's system cannot display on a bitmapped screen for you.  For\n\
    \   that, you need IP to your own computer with a bitmapped screen.\n   These\
    \ are two different degrees of Internet connectivity that are\n   important to\
    \ both end users and marketers.  Some people refer to them\n   as text-only interactive\
    \ access and graphical interactive access.\n   Some people have gone so far as\
    \ to say you have to have graphical\n   capabilities to have a full service Internet\
    \ connection.  That may or\n   may not be so, but in the interests of keeping\
    \ the major categories\n   to a minimum, we are simply going to note these degrees\
    \ and say no\n   more about them in this article.  However, we agree that the\n\
    \   distinction of graphical access is becoming more important with the\n   spread\
    \ of WWW and Mosaic.\n"

    \ dolls;\n   the kind where inside Boris Yeltsin is Mikhail Gorbachov, inside\n\
    \   Gorbachov is Brezhnev, then Kruschev, Stalin, Lenin, and maybe even\n   Tsar\
    \ Nicholas II.  Let's not talk about that many concentric layers,\n   though,\
    \ rather just three: the Matrix on the outside, the consumer\n   Internet inside,\
    \ and the core Internet inside that.\n                    the core        the\
    \ consumer    the Matrix\n                    Internet        Internet\n    interactive\
    \     supplier-       consumer-       by mail\n    services        capable   \
    \      capable\n                    stores and      shoppers        mail\n   \
    \                 shoppers                        order\n    asynchronous    yes\
    \             yes             yes services\n   Some people have argued that these\
    \ categories are bad because they\n   are not mutually exclusive.  Well, we observe\
    \ that in real life\n   networks have differing degrees of services, and the ones\
    \ of most\n   interest share the least common denominator of electronic mail.\
    \  Thus\n   concentric categories are needed to describe the real world.  You\n\
    \   can, however, extract three mutually-exclusive categories by\n   referring\
    \ to the core Internet, the interactive consumer-only part of\n   the Internet,\
    \ and to asynchronous systems.\n   Other people have argued that these categories\
    \ are not sequential.\n   They look sequential to us, since if you start with\
    \ the core Internet\n   and move out, you subtract services, and if you start\
    \ at the outside\n   of the Matrix and move in, you add services.\n"
- title: Outside the Matrix
  contents:
  - "Outside the Matrix\n   In addition to computers and networks that fit these classifications,\n\
    \   there are also LANs, mainframes, and BBSes that don't exchange any\n   services\
    \ with other networks or computers; not even mail.  These\n   systems are outside\
    \ the Matrix.  For example, many companies have an\n   AppleTalk LAN in marketing,\
    \ a Novell NetWare LAN in management, and a\n   mainframe in accounting that aren't\
    \ connected to talk to anything\n   else.  In addition, there are a few large\
    \ networks such as France's\n   Teletel (commonly known as Minitel) that support\
    \ very large user\n   populations but don't communicate with anything else.  These\
    \ are all\n   currently outside all our Chinese boxes of the core Internet, the\n\
    \   consumer Internet, and the Matrix.\n"
- title: DNS and Mail Addresses
  contents:
  - "DNS and Mail Addresses\n   There are other interesting network services that\
    \ make a difference\n   to end users.  For example, DNS (Domain Name System) domain\
    \ names\n   such as tic.com and domain addresses such tic@tic.com can be set up\n\
    \   for systems outside the Internet.  We used tic.com when we only had a\n  \
    \ UUCP connection, and few of our correspondents noticed any difference\n   when\
    \ we added an IP connection (except our mail was faster).  This\n   would be more\
    \ or less a box enclosing the consumer Internet and\n   within the Matrix.  But\
    \ the other three boxes are arguably the most\n   important.\n   Some people have\
    \ claimed that anything that uses DNS addresses is\n   part of the Internet. \
    \ We note that DNS addresses can be used with\n   the UUCP network, which supports\
    \ no interactive services, and we\n   reject such an equation.\n   It is interesting\
    \ to note that over the years various attempts have\n   been made to equate the\
    \ Internet with something else.  Until the\n   mid-1980s lots of people tried\
    \ to say the Internet was the ARPANET.\n   In the late 1980s many tried to say\
    \ the Internet was NSFNET.  In the\n   early 1990s many tried to say the Internet\
    \ was USENET.  Now many are\n   trying to say the Internet is anything that can\
    \ exchange mail.  We\n   say the Internet is the Internet, not the same as anything\
    \ else.\n"
- title: Summary
  contents:
  - "Summary\n   So, here we have a simple set of categories for several of the\n\
    \   categories of network access people talk about most these days.  Any\n   such\
    \ categories are at least somewhat a matter of opinion, and other\n   people will\
    \ propose other categories and other names.  We like these\n   categories, because\
    \ they fit our experience of what real users\n   actually perceive.\n   You'll\
    \ notice we've avoided use of the words \"connected\" and\n   \"reachable\" because\
    \ they mean different things to different people at\n   different times.  For\
    \ either of them to be meaningful, you have to\n   say which services you are\
    \ talking about.  To us, reachable usually\n   means pingable with ICMP ECHO,\
    \ which is another way to define the\n   core Internet.  To others, reachable\
    \ might mean you can send mail\n   there, which is another way to define the Matrix.\n\
    \   Once we have terms for networks of interest, we can talk about how\n   big\
    \ those networks are.  We think the terms we have defined here\n   refer to groups\
    \ of computers that people want to use, and that some\n   people want to measure.\
    \  Many marketers want to know about users.\n   Well, users of mail are in the\
    \ Matrix, and users of interactive\n   services such as WWW and FTP are in the\
    \ Internet.  Other people are\n   more interested in suppliers or distributors\
    \ of information.\n   Suppliers of information by mail can be anywhere in the\
    \ Matrix, but\n   suppliers of information by WWW or FTP are in the core Internet.\
    \  It\n   is easy to define more and finer degrees of distinctions of\n   capabilities\
    \ and connectivity, but these three major categories\n   handle the most important\
    \ cases.\n   We invite our readers to tell us what distinctions they find\n  \
    \ important about the various networks and their services.\n"
