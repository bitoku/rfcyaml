    \ for\n   the Web3D Consortium (Web3D) for naming persistent resources such as\n\
    \   technical documents and specifications, Virtual Reality Modeling\n   Language\
    \ (VRML) and Extensible 3D (X3D) files and resources,\n   Extensible Markup Language\
    \ (XML) Document Type Definitions (DTDs),\n   XML Schemas, namespaces, style sheets,\

  - "1. Introduction\n   Web3D is a non-profit organization with a mandate to develop\
    \ and\n   promote open standards to enable 3D for the Internet, Web and\n   broadcast\
    \ applications.  Web3D is responsible for developing,\n   advancing, and maintaining\
    \ the VRML97 ISO/IEC International Standard\n   (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997), X3D (the\
    \ forthcoming official successor to\n   VRML) and related technologies.\n   Web3D\
    \ maintains and extends its standardization activities through\n   the coordinated\
    \ efforts of dedicated Working Groups, Task Groups, and\n   professional Liaisons\
    \ to related standards bodies such as ISO, W3C,\n   and MPEG.  See http://web3d.org/\
    \ for details.\n   Web3D would like to assign unique, permanent, location-independent\n\
    \   names based on URNs for some resources it produces or manages.\n   This namespace\
    \ specification is for a formal namespace.\n"

    \      Web        : <http://mantiscorp.com/people/aew/>\n   Declaration of syntactic\
    \ structure:\n      URNs assigned by Web3D will have the following hierarchical\n\
    \      structure based on the group's organizational structure:\n         urn:web3d:{subgroup}:{subgroup-specific\
    \ string}\n      where \"subgroup\" corresponds to an official Web3D subgroup\
    \ or\n      activity such as the VRML standard ('vrml97'), Extensible 3D\n   \
    \   ('x3d'), Universal Media Working Group ('media'), Geographical\n      VRML\
    \ Working Group ('geovrml'), Humanoid Animation Working Group\n      ('hanim')\
    \ and so forth, and \"subgroup-specific string\" is a US-\n      ASCII string\
    \ that conforms to URN Syntax requirements ([RFC2141]).\n      In cases where\
    \ ownership or management of a resource is shared by\n      multiple Web3D subgroups\
    \ or activities, a general category may be\n      used in place of a specific\
    \ subgroup.\n      Chairs of Web3D subgroups and activities assign all unique\n\
    \      identifiers that fall within the scope of the subgroup or activity\n  \
    \    that they chair.  Chairs of Web3D subgroups and activities are\n      also\
    \ responsible for publishing the specific structure of URNs\n      assigned by\
    \ their group or activity.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      None\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      Identifier uniqueness will be\
    \ enforced by the Web3D Board of\n      Directors (BoD) in cooperation with Chair(s)\
    \ of corresponding\n      Web3D subgroups.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \      Web3D is committed to maintaining the accessibility and\n      persistence\
    \ of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by\n      the organization.\n\
    \   Process of identifier assignment:\n      Assignment is limited to the owner\
    \ and those authorities that are\n      specifically designated by the owner.\
    \  Web3D may designate\n      portions of its namespace for assignment by other\
    \ parties.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      The owner will develop\
    \ and maintain \"URN catalogs\" that map all\n      assigned URNs to Uniform Resource\
    \ Locators (URLs), specifically to\n      enable Web-based resolution of named\
    \ resources.  In the future, an\n      interactive online resolution system may\
    \ be developed to automate\n      this process.\n      The owner will authorize\
    \ additional resolution services as\n      appropriate.\n   Rules for Lexical\
    \ Equivalence:\n      URNs are lexically equivalent if they are lexically identical.\n\
    \   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n   Validation\
    \ mechanism:\n      None specified.  The owner will develop and maintain URN catalogs.\n\
    \      The presence of a URN in a catalog indicates that it is valid.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global\n"

- title: 5. Namespace Considerations and Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Namespace Considerations and Community Considerations\n   The Web3D Consortium\
    \ (formerly \"VRML Consortium\") long acknowledged\n   the value and utility of\
    \ URNs starting with the VRML International\n   Standard issued in 1997 (ISO/IEC\
    \ 14772-1:1997, commonly known as\n   \"VRML97\").  Annex F.2, \"URNs\", of that\
    \ standard outlines non-\n   normative use of URNs as a persistent naming mechanism\
    \ for referenced\n   resources such as files, EXTERNPROTOs, textures, and so forth.\n\
    \   As such numerous VRML players and authoring tools, as well as content\n  \
    \ authoring communities, have adopted Web3D-oriented URNs for this\n   purpose\
    \ despite the fact that no formal \"web3d\" URN NID has been\n   established by\
    \ the Web3D Consortium.  Consequently, interoperability\n   of resources named\
    \ using these disparate naming conventions is\n   difficult, if not impossible,\
    \ owing to the lack of a single, well\n   defined \"web3d\" URN namespace that\
    \ is formally registered and\n   maintained by the Web3D Consortium.\n   In order\
    \ to promote complete compatibility and interoperability\n   across past, current\
    \ and future Web3D standards, as well as across\n   myriad Web3D-related products,\
    \ tools, and content, the Web3D\n   Consortium believes formal registration and\
    \ management of the \"web3d\"\n   URN namespace is necessary and in the best interest\
    \ of the larger\n   Internet- and Web-based communities it serves.\n   The \"\
    web3d\" URN namespace will be used to name VRML and X3D files and\n   resources,\
    \ XML DTDs and Schemas, namespaces, style sheets, media\n   assets, and other\
    \ resources produced or managed by Web3D.  As an open\n   standards organization,\
    \ any Web3D Consortium resources that are\n   officially named using the \"web3d\"\
    \ namespace will be made freely\n   available to the public.\n   Resources will\
    \ be named and maintained in accordance with the\n   process(es) described in\
    \ this document.  Any organization or\n   individual can utilize the Web3D Consortium's\
    \ freely available URN\n   catalogs to resolve a resource named therein.  Although\
    \ the Web3D\n   Consortium will control the naming and allocation of resources\
    \ in\n   order to maintain compliance with the process(es) described in this\n\
    \   document, resolution and/or use of these resources is unrestricted\n   and\
    \ without fee in order to promote widespread adoption of open Web3D\n   technologies.\
    \  To this end, related documentation and open source\n   resolvers will be freely\
    \ provided through the Web3D Consortium's Web\n   site.\n   Additionally, member\
    \ organizations or individuals that wish to name\n   their own resources using\
    \ the \"web3d\" namespace may submit such\n   request(s) directly to the corresponding\
    \ Web3D Working Group\n   (subgroup) for subsequent review.\n"
