  - "4.  Motivation for the option.\n   Many network sites now provide a listing of
    the users currently\n   logged in giving their names and locations (see the NAME/FINGER\n
    \  protocol, RFC 742).  The location is useful for physically locating\n   the
    user if he or she is nearby, or for calling them (a nearby phone\n   number is
    often included). However, for users logged in via the\n   network, the location
    printed is often no more than the originating\n   site name. This TELNET option
    allows the user's TELNET program to\n   send the user's location to the server
    TELNET so that it can be\n   displayed in addition to the site name.  This functionality
    is\n   already present in the SUPDUP protocol (RFC 734).\n"

  - "5.  Description of the option.\n   When the user TELNET program knows the user's
    location, it should\n   offer to transmit this information to the server TELNET
    by sending\n   IAC WILL SEND-LOCATION.  If the server's system is able to make
    use\n   of this information (as can the ITS sites), then the server will\n   reply
    with IAC DO SEND-LOCATION.  The user TELNET is then free to\n   send the location
    in a subnegotiation at any time.\n"
