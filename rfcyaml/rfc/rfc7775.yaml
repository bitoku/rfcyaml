  - "Abstract\n   In existing specifications, the route preferences for IPv4/IPv6\n
    \  Extended Reachability TLVs are not explicitly stated.  There are also\n   inconsistencies
    in the definition of how the up/down bit applies to\n   route preference when
    the prefix advertisement appears in Level 2\n   Link State Protocol Data Units
    (LSPs).  This document addresses these\n   issues.\n   This document updates RFC
    5308.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5302] defines the route preference rules as they apply
    to TLVs\n   128 and 130.  [RFC5305] introduced the IP Extended Reachability TLV\n
    \  135 but did not explicitly adapt the route preference rules defined\n   in
    [RFC5302] for the new TLV.  [RFC5308] defines the IPv6\n   Reachability TLV 236
    and does include an explicit statement regarding\n   route preference -- but the
    statement introduces use of the up/down\n   bit in advertisements that appear
    in Level 2 LSPs, which is\n   inconsistent with statements made in [RFC5302] and
    [RFC5305].  This\n   document defines explicit route preference rules for TLV
    135, revises\n   the route preference rules for TLV 236, and clarifies the usage
    of\n   the up/down bit when it appears in TLVs in Level 2 LSPs.  This\n   document
    is a clarification (NOT a correction) of [RFC5302] and\n   [RFC5305]; it is a
    correction of the route preference rules defined\n   in [RFC5308] to be consistent
    with the rules for IPv4.  It also makes\n   explicit that the same rules apply
    to the Multi-Topology (MT)\n   equivalent TLVs 235 and 237.\n"

  - "2.  Use of the Up/Down Bit in Level 2 LSPs\n   The up/down bit was introduced
    in support of leaking prefixes\n   downwards in the IS-IS level hierarchy.  Routes
    that are leaked\n   downwards have the bit set to 1.  Such prefixes MUST NOT be
    leaked\n   upwards in the hierarchy.  So long as we confine ourselves to a\n   single
    IS-IS instance and the current number of supported levels\n   (two), it is impossible
    to have a prefix advertised in a Level 2 LSP\n   and have the up/down bit set
    to 1.  However, because [RFC5302]\n   anticipated a future extension to IS-IS
    that might support additional\n   levels, it allowed for the possibility that
    the up/down bit might be\n   set in a Level 2 LSP and supported easy migration
    in the event such\n   an extension was introduced.  Section 3.3 of [RFC5302] states:\n
    \     ...it is RECOMMENDED that implementations ignore the up/down bit\n      in
    L2 LSPs, and accept the prefixes in L2 LSPs regardless of\n      whether the up/down
    bit is set.\n   [RFC5305] addressed an additional case wherein an implementation\n
    \  included support for multiple virtual routers running IS-IS in\n   different
    areas.  In such a case, it is possible to redistribute\n   prefixes between two
    IS-IS instances in the same manner that prefixes\n   are redistributed from other
    protocols into IS-IS.  This introduced\n   the possibility that a prefix could
    be redistributed from Level 1 to\n   Level 1 (as well as between Level 2 and Level
    2), and in the event\n   the redistributed route was leaked from Level 1 to Level
    2, two\n   different routers in different areas would be advertising the same\n
    \  prefix into the Level 2 sub-domain.  To prevent this, Section 4.1 of\n   [RFC5305]
    specifies:\n      If a prefix is advertised from one area to another at the same\n
    \     level, then the up/down bit SHALL be set to 1.\n   However, the statement
    in [RFC5302] that the up/down bit is ignored\n   in Level 2 LSPs is not altered
    by [RFC5305].\n   The conclusion then is that there is no \"L2 inter-area route\";\n
    \  indeed, no such route type is defined by [RFC5302].  However,\n   [RFC5308]
    ignored this fact and introduced such a route type in\n   Section 5 when it specified
    a preference for \"Level 2 down prefix\".\n   This is an error that this document
    corrects.  As changing the use of\n   the up/down bit in TLVs 236 and 237 may
    introduce interoperability\n   issues, implementors may wish to support transition
    mechanisms from\n   the behavior described in [RFC5308] to the behavior described
    in this\n   document.\n"

    supported by TLVs 135, 235, 236, and\n   237.  Distinction between internal/external
    metrics is not supported.\n   In the case of IPv4 TLVs (135 and 235), the distinction

  - "Appendix A.  Example Interoperability Issue\n   This example documents a real-world
    interoperability issue that\n   occurs because implementations from different
    vendors have\n   interpreted the use of the up/down bit in Level 2 LSPs\n   inconsistently.\n
    \          L2       L2       L2     L2|L2      L2\n    10/8 - R0 ----- R1 -----
    R2 ----- R3 ----- R4 ---- 10/8\n                                      |\n                   Figure
    1\n   In Figure 1, both R0 and R4 are advertising the prefix 10/8.  Two IS-\n
    \  IS Level 2 instances are running on R3 to separate the network into\n   two
    areas.  R3 is performing route leaking and advertises prefixes\n   from R4 to
    the other Level 2 process.  The network is using extended\n   metrics (TLV 135
    defined in [RFC5305]).  R0 advertises 10/8 with\n   metric 2000, and R3 advertises
    10/8 with metric 100.  All links have\n   a metric of 1.  When advertising 10/8
    in its Level 2 LSP, R3 sets the\n   down bit as specified in [RFC5305].\n   R1,
    R2, and R3 are from three different vendors (R1->Vendor1,\n   R2->Vendor2, R3->Vendor3).
    \ During interoperability testing, routing\n   loops are observed in this scenario.\n
    \  o  R2 has two possible paths to reach 10/8: Level 2 route with metric\n      2002
    and up/down bit set to 0 (from R0) and Level 2 route with\n      metric 101 and
    up/down bit set to 1 (from R3).  R2 selects R1 as\n      the next hop to 10/8
    because it prefers the route that does NOT\n      have the up/down bit set.\n
    \  o  R3 has two possible paths to reach 10/8: Level 2 route with metric\n      2003
    and up/down bit set to 0 (from R0) and Level 2 route with\n      metric 101 and
    up/down bit set to 0 (from R4).  R3 selects R4 as\n      the next hop due to lowest
    metric.\n   o  R1 has two possible paths to reach 10/8: Level 2 route with metric\n
    \     2001 and up/down bit set to 0 (from R0) and Level 2 route with\n      metric
    102 and up/down bit set to 1 (from R3).  R1 selects R2 as\n      the next hop
    due to lowest metric.\n   When R1 or R2 try to send traffic to 10/8, packets loop
    due to\n   inconsistent routing decisions between R1 and R2.\n"
