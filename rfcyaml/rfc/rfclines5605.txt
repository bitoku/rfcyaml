Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling ATM Pseudowire (PW) carrying ATM cells over Packet Switched Networks (PSNs).
This document describes a model for managing "emulated" ATM services over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).
The document follows the requirements for Pseudowire Emulation Edge  to Edge [PWREQ]; it is closely related to [ATMENCAP] and [ATMTRANS], which describe the encapsulation of ATM signals and provide the Emulation Service over a Packet Switched Network.
The ATM management model consists of several MIB modules, following the layering model described in the PWE3 Architecture [PWARCH] document.
The ATM MIB module described in this document works closely with the MIB modules described in [AToMTC], [AToM], [IFMIB], [PWMIB], and the textual conventions defined in [PWTC].
The conceptual layering and relationship among all of those is described in Figure 1 and in the "Relation to Other PW MIB Modules" section listed below.
An ATM connection will be a pseudowire (PW) connection.
It will not be treated as an interface and will therefore not be represented in the ifTable.
LSR STD MIB Figure 1 2.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].
This document follows the terminology used in PW Architecture [PWARCH].
Within the MIB objects, it is called outbound.
Within the MIB objects, it is called inbound.
For example, in an ATM service, the foreign protocol is ATM.
The PSN may be MPLS.
In practice, this connection is not limited to path oriented types of PSNs such as MPLS.
An example of a non  path oriented PSN is an IP PSN.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This MIB module is designed to satisfy the following requirements and constraints:
Fit within the architecture defined by [PWARCH] and [PWMIB].
Fit within the model for Virtual Path/Virtual Circuit (VP/VC) definitions and management concept as defined in the [AToM] MIB.
Support manually configured ATM PWs.
Support automatically configured ATM PWs.
Enable the use of any PSN type.
Support point to point ATM PW connections.
Point to multipoint and multipoint to point connections are for future study.
Allow configuration of all the parameters needed to establish a PW to carry ATM cells.
Report ATM performance metrics for the ATM PW.
This includes cells transmit, Cells dropped, Cells received, and unknownCells.
In addition, it reports performance metrics at packet level.
Support ATM Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) cells.
Do not consider Integrated Local Management Interface (ILMI) support.
The MIB structure for defining a PW service is composed of three layers of MIB modules functioning together.
This general model is defined in the PWE3 Architecture [PWARCH].
The layering model is intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN layer that carries the emulated service.
This is done at the same time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported services to any supported PSNs.
The first layer, known as the service layer, contains service  specific modules such as the one defined in this document.
These modules define service specific management objects that interface or collaborate with existing MIB modules for the native version of the service.
The service specific module "glues" the standard module to the PWE MIB framework.
The next layer of the PWE MIB framework is comprised of the PW MIB module [PWMIB].
This module is used to configure general parameters of PW connections that are common to all types of emulated services and PSNs.
This layer is connected to the service specific layer above, and the PSN layer below.
The PSN layer provides PSN specific modules for each type of PSN.
These modules associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry the service over the PSN.
These modules are defined in other documents.
This module is used to "glue" the PW service to the underlying PSN specific MIB modules.
In the case of MPLS, for example, the PW MPLS MIB [PWMPLSMIB] is used to connect the PW service to either the MPLS LDP [LDPMIB] or MPLS TE [TEMIB] MIBs.
[PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules.
This section provides an example of using the MIB objects described in section 9 to set up an ATM PW.
While this example is not meant to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid in the understanding of some key concepts.
It is meant to be read after going through the MIB itself.
See [PWMIB] for an example of setting up a PSN Tunnel.
The following example illustrates how a user will set up an ATM Adaptation Layer 5
ATM PW on a switch/router with cells entering the switch/router through ATM Interface with IfIndex 1000 [IFMIB], Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) 1 and Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI)
100 (from an ATM network to a PSN   outbound direction) and on the way back, it goes out of the switch/router through ATM Interface 1000 with VPI 1 and VCI 100
(PSN to ATM network   inbound direction).
First create an entry in the PW MIB with pwType atmAal5SduVcc(2), then create entries in the pwAtmCfg table, inbound and outbound tables.
CLP will not be mapped to QoS pwAtmOamCellSupported
OAM cells will be supported In pwAtmOutboundTable:
Structure of the MIB Module
This MIB consists of 4 types of tables; It is important to note that the TrafficParamDescr Table is not defined as part of this MIB, although an object pointing to such a table entry exists in all configuration tables of this MIB module.
Users can refer to any ATM TrafficDescr (TD) Table if there is a need to overwrite the TD assigned to the ATM endpoint in the ATM service MIB [AToM].
A table for generic parameters for ATM PW configuration that is applicable for each ATM PW.
PW ATM Outbound Table: There are two tables to configure an outbound ATM PW depending on the type of service.
One table for 1:1 service, and the other for N:1 service and transparent cell mode
: There are two tables to configure an inbound ATM PW depending on the type of service.
One table for 1:1 service, and the other for N:1 service and transparent cell mode.
: There are three tables; each contains the relevant time dependent statistics for an ATM PW Entry.
There is a current table, a 15 minute interval table, and a one day interval table.
The tables are aligned with statistic models of other PW services.

current DESCRIPTION "Collection of objects for N:1, 1:1, or transparent ATM PW outbound configuration."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The pwAtmOutboundTable, pwAtmInboundTable, pwAtmCfgTable, pwAtmOutboundNto1Table, and pwAtmInboundNto1Table contain objects of ATM PW parameters on a Provider Edge (PE) device.
Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result in disruption of traffic on the network.
The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where possible.
Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any SNMPV3 agent, which implements this MIB module.
Administrators should consider whether read access to these objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable under certain circumstances.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: The pwATMCfgTable, pwAtmPerfCurrentTable, pwAtmPerfIntervalTable, and pwAtmPerf1DayIntervalTable collectively show the ATM pseudowire connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.
If an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
