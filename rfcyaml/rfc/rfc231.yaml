    \ USAGE--A USER'S VIEW\nINTRODUCTION\n------------\n     This note is a statement\
    \ of our views on service cen- ter\nstandards.  It is an input to the service\
    \ center panel discussion of\nthe October Network meeting.  Some areas are identified\
    \ for\nconsideration in intra-network standardiza- tion.  We do not describe\n\
    a methodology for analyzing com- puter systems; however, such analysis\nmay be\
    \ appropriate for solving the problems.  We also do not enumerate\nthe spectrum\
    \ of services that may be required.  We merely enu- merate\nareas where commonality\
    \ of appearance and function can be of immediate\nvalue to a network user.\nCAVEAT\n\
    ------\n     It is assumed that service centers will conform to official\nnetwork\
    \ standard protocols.  This is essential for service centers\nsince the effects\
    \ of their practices are generally more wide-spread\nand are crucial to the effectiveness\
    \ of minimal hosts such as TIPs.\nJUSTIFICATION\n-------------\n     The generation\
    \ of network standards for service centers is of\nvalue to a very important class\
    \ of people--the ultimate user\ncommunity.  We have such a community at Rand that\
    \ is composed of\nresearch scientists and their support programmers.  Certainly\
    \ such\nusers exist elsewhere, and a goal of the net- work must be to\nencourage\
    \ their use.  In the past, these researchers have relied\nsolely on programmers\
    \ to buffer them from computer detail.\nStandardization of services is cer- tainly\
    \ a great value in expanding\nthe community of users and eliminating the buffer.\n\
    \     Additionally, standards will be of benefit to those persons\nresponsible\
    \ for implementation of resource access programs.  Instances\nand areas of standardization\
    \ are cited below to support both of these\nstatements.\n     Each host installation\
    \ has its own standards for pro- gramming\nand operational procedures.  From a\
    \ network point of view, we are only\ninterested in standards affecting external\
    \ performance--primarily\nrequired operations and documentation of procedures.\
    \  Intra-network\nstandards should allow a user to plan his network use effectively\
    \ to\nimprove the performance of his tasks and take advantage of savings in\n\
    both time and money.\nRemote Job Entry\n----------------\n     One immediately\
    \ apparent area for standardization is in the\naccess to network resources.  For\
    \ example, there are two remote job\nentry (RJE) facilities on the network at\
    \ present with two different\ndata protocols.  The UCSB facility was developed\
    \ early to provide\ntimely access to their resources.  The UCLA facility was developed\n\
    after the Telnet and Data Transfer protocols and takes advantage of\nthem.  If\
    \ these two services appeared alike to the user and to the\nusing process, two\
    \ significant advantages would be obtained.  First,\nthe using system would need\
    \ only one module to access both facilities.\nAnd secondly, a user could select\
    \ either facility on a dynamic basis\nusing the conditions influencing him at\
    \ any given moment without any\nadditional knowledge of the specific site.\nLogin\
    \ Procedures and Subsystem Access\n-------------------------------------\n   \
    \  A more global example of common access to resources is the login\nprocedure\
    \ to remote systems.  All systems require basically the same\ninformation--password,\
    \ identification, account number.  Yet the\nformats are syntactically inconsis-\
    \ tent.  An extension to the logger\ngenerally exists at these sites in the form\
    \ of a \"line scanner\" for\nthe network.  In general, this module also performs\
    \ other\ntransformational functions.  It would certainly be reasonable for this\n\
    module to translate a network standard login into whatever format was\nrequired\
    \ at the site.  Perhaps to a lesser extent, a similar approach\ncould be taken\
    \ to constructing a uniform access to subsystems from the\nsupervisor.  In like\
    \ fashion, a network standard interrupt could be\ntranslated into the escape (e.g.,\
    \ control C) of the serving host to\nreturn from a subsystem.\nCharging Algorithms\
    \ and Accounting Protocol\n-------------------------------------------\n     To\
    \ accurately forecast costs, a normalized formula for machine\nis the same for\
    \ all nodes, thus the Net charges are readily determined\nby any node.  More difficult\
    \ is the prediction and comparison of host\ncharges.  Like the login procedure\
    \ example, each host uses the same\ningredients, namely storage, I/O, connect\
    \ time, and CPU resources\nexpended.  Again, like the login procedure the information\
    \ is handled\nslightly dif- ferently in each case such that estimations are\n\
    difficult.  For example, some charge algorithms represent I/O as\ncounts of I/O\
    \ transactions where others clock I/O time.  Without\nsignificantly perturbing\
    \ anyone's local accounting proce- dures, it is\ndesirable to normalize the charge\
    \ components as a step toward\nreasonable cost comparisons and forecast- ing.\n\
    Off-Line Services\n-----------------                             .\n     Procedures\
    \ need to be established for off-line services where\nthey are offered as a service\
    \ or are an integral part of a service.\nSuch services are graphic hardcopy, large\
    \ quantities of printer\noutput, tape or disc facilities, etc.  How are such items\
    \ transmitted?\nWhat guarantees or state- ments should be made about turnaround\
    \ times?\nHow should they be specified--in terms of invocation and communication\n\
    with operations staffs?\nJob Scheduling, Priorities and Status Information\n-------------------------------------------------\n\
    \     Extrapolating from the above rather static cost com- parisons\nthat a normalized\
    \ formula allows, envision a small but useful process,\ni.e., a throughput query\
    \ service, that allows the user to dynamically\ndetermine the most cost ef- fective\
    \ location for a job.  (Such a\nservice is technically reasonable since some systems\
    \ now offer status\ndata such as a core map and job queues display.) Imagine the\
    \ user's\nsituation.  \"Let's see, I need these numbers by 4:00 and I'm willing\n\
    to pay a slight dollar premium to get them; the job will run on any\nTenex machine,\
    \ where should I run it?\" The user would like to query\nTenex systems, providing\
    \ as input the requirements of his program, and\nget answers like probable turn-around\
    \ time and cost vectors for dif-\nferent priorities.  (Incidentally, our non-programmer\
    \ users are\nfamiliar with their job parameters (time, core space, etc.) since\
    \ this\ninformation is normally part of the out- put stream.)\n     Most of the\
    \ necessary elements for such a service are readily\navailable in systems with\
    \ which we are concerned.  The query service\nwould be a utility for users.  This\
    \ is the kind of a problem we should\naddress concerning services vis-a-vis exporting\
    \ Network concepts.\n     In addition to the above items, the user community could\n\
    immediately benefit from standards in: documentation formats and\ndistribution,\
    \ operating schedules, the extent and availability of\nconsulting services, data\
    \ transmission and storage facilities,\ntechniques for communication with operations\
    \ staffs, and abnormal\nprocedures such as system or program failures.\n     Some\
    \ of the above items should be described in a standard format\nrather than the\
    \ services themselves being standardized across the\nnetwork.  For example, schedules\
    \ obviously vary in different time\nzones and each system has a different magnitude\
    \ and policy for on-line\nstorage capabilities.\n     To some extent these items\
    \ are covered in the Resource Notebook.\nIt should either be expanded to become\
    \ a service center standards\nnotebook or a separate item to fulfill that function\
    \ should be\ncreated.  For example, a site might have resources that it wished\
    \ to\noffer on a limited or special arrangement basis to the network\ncommunity\
    \ and should be included as such in the Resource Notebook.\nHowever, that site\
    \ might not wish to or have the staff to conform to\nnetwork service center standards.\
    \  Hence, the service center notebook\nwould describe standards for a much more\
    \ rigor- ously conforming\ncommunity.\nSUMMARY\n-------\n     The theme of this\
    \ note is that without classifying ser- vices and\nanalyzing operations at service\
    \ nodes, there are a number of areas\nthat can be standardized to some extent\
    \ throughout the network.  What\nis needed is a manual of service center standards\
    \ and a collection of\ndocumentation on services.  Perhaps the latter is the Resource\n\
    Notebook.\n     Service centers who intend to attract a significant network user\n\
    community should be prepared to adopt a psychol- ogy appropriate to\nthe market-oriented\
    \ requirements for providing service.  In the\nnetwork at large, with our re-\
    \ search orientation, personnel tend to\nhave a different approach to computing\
    \ than that required by a service\nbureau.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
