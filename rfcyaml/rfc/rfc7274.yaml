  - "Abstract\n   Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes.  A block\n
    \  of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end; these labels are\n   commonly
    called \"reserved labels\".  They will be called \"special-\n   purpose labels\"
    in this document.\n   As there are only 16 of these special-purpose labels, caution
    is\n   needed in the allocation of new special-purpose labels; yet, at the\n   same
    time, forward progress should be allowed when one is called for.\n   This memo
    defines new procedures for the allocation and retirement of\n   special-purpose
    labels, as well as a method to extend the special-\n   purpose label space and
    a description of how to handle extended\n   special-purpose labels in the data
    plane.  Finally, this memo renames\n   the IANA registry for special-purpose labels
    to \"Special-Purpose MPLS\n   Label Values\" and creates a new registry called
    the \"Extended\n   Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\" registry.\n   This document
    updates a number of previous RFCs that use the term\n   \"reserved label\".  Specifically,

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MPLS Label Stack Encoding specification [RFC3032] defined
    four\n   special-purpose label values (0 to 3) and set aside values 4 through\n
    \  15 for future use.  These labels have special significance in both\n   the
    control and the data plane.  Since then, three further values\n   have been allocated
    (values 7, 13, and 14 in [RFC6790], [RFC5586],\n   and [RFC3429], respectively),
    leaving nine unassigned values from the\n   original space of sixteen.\n   While
    the allocation of three out of the remaining twelve special-\n   purpose label
    values in the space of about 12 years is not in itself\n   a cause for concern,
    the scarcity of special-purpose labels is.\n   Furthermore, many of the special-purpose
    labels require special\n   processing by forwarding hardware, changes to which
    are often\n   expensive and sometimes impossible.  Thus, documenting a newly\n
    \  allocated special-purpose label value is important.\n   This memo outlines
    some of the issues in allocating and retiring\n   special-purpose label values
    and defines mechanisms to address these.\n   This memo also extends the space
    of special-purpose labels.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Questions\n   In re-appraising MPLS special-purpose labels, the following
    questions\n   come to mind:\n   1.  What allocation policies should be applied
    by IANA for the\n       allocation of special-purpose labels?  Should Early Allocation\n
    \      [RFC7120] be allowed?  Should there be labels for experimental\n       use
    or private use [RFC5226]?\n   2.  What documentation is required for special-purpose
    labels\n       allocated henceforth?\n   3.  Should a special-purpose label ever
    be retired?  What criteria\n       are relevant here?  Can a retired special-purpose
    label ever be\n       re-allocated for a different purpose?  What procedures and
    time\n       frames are appropriate?\n   4.  The special-purpose label value of
    3 (the \"Implicit NULL Label\"\n       [RFC3032]) is only used in signaling, never
    in the data plane.\n       Could it (and should it) be used in the data plane?
    \ If so, how\n       and for what purpose?\n   5.  What is a feasible mechanism
    to extend the space of special-\n       purpose labels should this become necessary?\n
    \  6.  Should extended special-purpose labels be used for load\n       balancing?\n"
  title: 2.  Questions
- contents:
  - "3.  Answers\n   This section provides answers to the questions posed in the previous\n
    \  section.\n   1.\n       A.  Allocation of special-purpose MPLS labels is via
    \"Standards\n           Action\".\n       B.  The IANA registry will be renamed
    \"Special-Purpose MPLS Label\n           Values\".\n       C.  Early allocation
    may be allowed on a case-by-case basis.\n       D.  The current space of 16 special-purpose
    labels is too small\n           for setting aside values for experimental or private
    use.\n           However, the \"Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\"\n
    \          registry created by this document has enough space, and this\n           document
    defines a range for experimental use.\n   2.  A Standards Track RFC must accompany
    a request for allocation of\n       Standards Action special-purpose labels, as
    per [RFC5226].\n   3.  The retirement of a special-purpose MPLS label value must
    follow\n       a strict and well-documented process.  This is necessary since
    we\n       must avoid orphaning the use of this label value in existing\n       deployments.
    \ This process is detailed in Section 3.2.\n   4.  For now, the use of the \"Implicit
    NULL Label\" (value 3) in the\n       data plane will not be allowed.  If this
    decision is revisited\n       later, an accompanying Standards Track RFC that
    details the use\n       of the label, a discussion of possible sources of confusion\n
    \      between signaling and data plane, and mitigation thereof shall be\n       required.\n
    \  5.  A special-purpose label (the \"Extension Label\", XL, value 15) is\n       set
    aside for the purpose of extending the space of special-\n       purpose labels.
    \ Further details are described in Section 3.1.\n   6.  [RFC6790] says that special-purpose
    labels MUST NOT be used for\n       load balancing.  The same logic applies to
    extended special-\n       purpose labels (ESPLs).  Thus, this document specifies
    that ESPLs\n       MUST NOT be used for load balancing.  It is noted that existing\n
    \      implementations would violate this, as they do not recognize XL\n       as
    anything other than a single special-purpose label and will\n       not expect
    an ESPL to follow.  The consequence is that if ESPLs\n       are used in some
    packets of a flow, these packets may be\n       delivered on different paths and
    so could be re-ordered.\n       However, it is important to specify the correct
    behavior for\n       future implementations, hence the use of \"MUST NOT\".\n
    \  A further question that needed to be settled in this regard was\n   whether
    a \"regular\" special-purpose label retains its meaning if it\n   follows the
    XL.  The answer to this question is provided in\n   Section 3.1.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\n   The XL MUST be followed
      by another label L (and thus MUST have the\n   bottom-of-stack bit clear).  L
      MUST be interpreted as an ESPL and\n   interpreted as defined in a new registry
      created by this document\n   (see Section 5).  Whether or not L has the bottom-of-stack
      bit set\n   depends on whether other labels follow L.  The XL only assigns\n
      \  special meaning to L.  A label after L (if any) is parsed as usual\n   and
      thus may be a regular label or a special-purpose label; if the\n   latter, it
      may be the XL and thus followed by another ESPL.\n   The label value 15 is set
      aside as the XL as shown in Section 5.\n   Values 0-15 of the \"Extended Special-Purpose
      MPLS Label Values\"\n   registry are set aside as reserved.  Furthermore, values
      0-6 and 8-15\n   MUST NOT appear in the data plane following an XL; an LSR processing\n
      \  a packet with an XL at the top of the label stack followed by a label\n   with
      value 0-6 or 8-15 MUST drop the packet.\n   Label 7 (when received) retains
      its meaning as Entropy Label\n   Indicator (ELI) whether a regular special-purpose
      label or an ESPL;\n   this is because of backwards compatibility with existing
      implemented\n   and deployed code and hardware that looks for the ELI without\n
      \  verifying if the previous label is XL or not.  However, when an LSR\n   inserts
      an entropy label, it MUST insert the ELI as a regular\n   special-purpose label,
      not as an ESPL.\n"
    - contents:
      - "3.1.1.  Forwarding Packets with Extended Special-Purpose Labels\n   If an
        LSR encounters the XL at the top of stack and it doesn't\n   understand extension
        labels, it MUST drop the packet as specified for\n   the handling of an invalid
        incoming label according to [RFC3031].  If\n   an LSR encounters an ESPL at
        the top of stack (after the XL) that it\n   does not understand, it MUST drop
        the packet, again following the\n   same procedure.  In either case, the LSR
        MAY log the event, but such\n   logging MUST be rate-limited.\n   An LSR SHOULD
        NOT make forwarding decisions on labels not at the top\n   of stack.  For
        load-balancing decisions, see Answer 6 in Section 3.\n"

        of\n   \"normal\" special-purpose labels for use in cases where minimizing

    - "3.2.  Process for Retiring Special-Purpose Labels\n   While the following process
      is defined for the sake of completeness,\n   note that retiring special-purpose
      labels is difficult.  It is\n   recommended that this process be used sparingly.\n
      \  a.  A label value that has been assigned from the \"Special-Purpose\n       MPLS
      Label Values\" registry may be deprecated by IETF consensus\n       with review
      by the MPLS working group (or designated experts if\n       the working group
      or a successor does not exist).  An RFC with at\n       least Informational
      status is required.\n       The RFC will direct IANA to mark the label value
      as \"deprecated\"\n       in the registry but will not release it at this stage.\n
      \      Deprecating means that no further specifications using the\n       deprecated
      value will be documented.\n       At the same time, this is an indication to
      vendors not to include\n       the deprecated value in new implementations and
      to operators to\n       avoid including it in new deployments.\n   b.  Twelve
      months after the RFC deprecating the label value is\n       published, an IETF-wide
      survey may be conducted to determine if\n       the deprecated label value is
      still in use.  If the survey\n       indicates that the deprecated label value
      is in use, the survey\n       may be repeated after an additional 6 months.\n
      \  c.  If the survey indicates that a deprecated label value is not in\n       use,
      24 months after the RFC that deprecated the label value was\n       published,
      publication may be requested of an IETF Standards\n       Track Internet-Draft
      that retires the deprecated label value.\n       This document will request
      that IANA release the label value for\n       future use and assignment.\n"
