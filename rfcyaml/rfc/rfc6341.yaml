  - "1.  Introduction\n   Session recording is a critical operational requirement\
    \ in many\n   businesses, especially where voice is used as a medium for commerce\n\
    \   and customer support.  A prime example where voice is used for trade\n   is\
    \ the financial industry.  The call recording requirements in this\n   industry\
    \ are quite stringent.  The recorded calls are used for\n   dispute resolution\
    \ and compliance.  Other businesses, such as\n   customer support call centers,\
    \ typically employ call recording for\n   quality control or business analytics,\
    \ with different requirements.\n   Depending on the country and its regulatory\
    \ requirements, financial\n   trading floors typically must record all calls.\
    \  In contrast, call\n   centers typically only record a subset of the calls,\
    \ and calls must\n   not fail, regardless of the availability of the recording\
    \ device.\n   Respecting the privacy rights and wishes of users engaged in a call\n\
    \   is of paramount importance.  In many jurisdictions, participants have\n  \
    \ a right to know that the session is being recorded or might be\n   recorded,\
    \ and they have a right to opt out, either by terminating the\n   call or by demanding\
    \ that the call not be recorded.  Therefore, this\n   document contains requirements\
    \ for being able to notify users that a\n   call is being recorded and for users\
    \ to be able to request that a\n   call not be recorded.  Use cases where users\
    \ participating in a call\n   are not informed that the call is or might be recorded\
    \ are outside\n   the scope of this document.  In particular, lawful intercept\
    \ is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n   Furthermore, a one-size-fits-all\
    \ model will not fit all markets where\n   the scale and cost burdens vary widely\
    \ and where needs differ for\n   such solution capabilities as media injection,\
    \ transcoding, and\n   security.  If a standardized solution supports all of the\n\
    \   requirements from every recording market but doing so would be\n   expensive\
    \ for markets with lesser needs, then proprietary solutions\n   for those markets\
    \ will continue to propagate.  Care must be taken,\n   therefore, to make a standards-based\
    \ solution support optionality and\n   flexibility.\n   This document specifies\
    \ requirements for using SIP [RFC3261] between\n   a Session Recording Client\
    \ and a Session Recording Server to control\n   the recording of media that has\
    \ been transmitted in the context of a\n   Communication Session.  A Communication\
    \ Session is the \"call\" between\n   participants.  The Session Recording Client\
    \ is the source of the\n   recorded media.  The Session Recording Server is the\
    \ sink of recorded\n   media.  It should be noted that the requirements for the\
    \ protocol\n   between a Session Recording Server and Session Recording Client\
    \ have\n   very similar requirements (such as codec and transport negotiation,\n\
    \   encryption key interchange, and firewall traversal) as compared to\n   regular\
    \ SIP media sessions.  The choice of SIP for session recording\n   provides reuse\
    \ of an existing protocol.\n   The recorded sessions can be any RTP media sessions,\
    \ including voice,\n   dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) (as defined by [RFC4733]),\
    \ video, and\n   text (as defined by [RFC4103]).\n   An archived session recording\
    \ is typically comprised of the\n   Communication Session media content and the\
    \ Communication Session\n   Metadata.  The Communication Session Metadata allows\
    \ recording\n   archives to be searched and filtered at a later time and allows\
    \ a\n   session to be played back in a meaningful way, e.g., with correct\n  \
    \ synchronization between the media.  The Communication Session\n   Metadata needs\
    \ to be conveyed from the Session Recording Client to\n   the Session Recording\
    \ Server.\n   This document only considers active recording, where the Session\n\
    \   Recording Client purposefully streams media to a Session Recording\n   Server.\
    \  Passive recording, where a recording device detects media\n   directly from\
    \ the network, is outside the scope of this document.\n"

- title: 3.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.  Definitions\n   Session Recording Server (SRS): A Session Recording Server\
    \ (SRS) is a\n      SIP User Agent (UA) that is a specialized media server or\n\
    \      collector that acts as the sink of the recorded media.  An SRS is\n   \
    \   typically implemented as a multi-port device that is capable of\n      receiving\
    \ media from multiple sources simultaneously.  An SRS is\n      the sink of the\
    \ recorded session metadata.\n   Session Recording Client (SRC): A Session Recording\
    \ Client (SRC) is a\n      SIP User Agent (UA) that acts as the source of the\
    \ recorded media,\n      sending it to the SRS.  An SRC is a logical function.\
    \  Its\n      capabilities may be implemented across one or more physical\n  \
    \    devices.  In practice, an SRC could be a personal device (such as\n     \
    \ a SIP phone), a SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border\n      Controller (SBC),\
    \ or a SIP Media Server (MS) integrated with an\n      Application Server (AS).\
    \  This specification defines the term\n      \"SRC\" such that all such SIP entities\
    \ can be generically addressed\n      under one definition.  The SRC provides\
    \ metadata to the SRS.\n   Communication Session (CS): A session created between\
    \ two or more SIP\n      User Agents (UAs) that is the subject of recording.\n\
    \   Recording Session (RS): The SIP session created between an SRC and\n     \
    \ SRS for the purpose of recording a Communication Session.\n   Figure 1 pictorially\

  - "4.  Use Cases\n   Use Case 1: Full-time Recording: One Recording Session for\
    \ each\n      Communication Session.\n      For example, the diagram below shows\
    \ the life cycle of\n      Communication Sessions (CSs) and the relationship to\
    \ the Recording\n      Sessions (RS).\n         CS  |--- CS 1 ---|      |--- CS\
    \ 2 ---|     |--- CS 3 ---|\n         RS  |--- RS 1 ---|      |--- RS 2 ---| \
    \    |--- RS 3 ---|\n         t--->\n                                 Figure 2\n\
    \      Record every CS for each specific extension/person.\n      The need to\
    \ record all calls is typically due to business process\n      purposes (such\
    \ as transaction confirmation or dispute resolution)\n      or to ensure compliance\
    \ with governmental regulations.\n      Applications include enterprise, contact\
    \ center, and financial\n      trading floors.\n      This is also commonly known\
    \ as Total Recording.\n   Use Case 2: Selective Recording: Start a Recording Session\
    \ when a\n      Communication Session to be recorded is established.\n      In\
    \ this example, Communication Sessions 1 and 3 are recorded but\n      CS 2 is\
    \ not.\n         CS  |--- CS 1 ---|      |--- CS 2 ---|     |--- CS 3 ---|\n \
    \        RS  |--- RS 1----|                         |--- RS 2 ---|\n         t--->\n\
    \                                 Figure 3\n   Use Case 3: Start/Stop a Recording\
    \ Session during a Communication\n      Session.\n      The Recording Session\
    \ starts during a Communication Session,\n      either manually via a user-controlled\
    \ mechanism (e.g., a button on\n      a user's phone) or automatically via an\
    \ application (e.g., a\n      contact center customer service application) or\
    \ business event.  A\n      Recording Session ends either during the Communication\
    \ Session or\n      when the Communication Session ends.  One or more Recording\n\
    \      Sessions may record each Communication Session.\n         CS  |-------------\
    \ Communication Session -----------|\n         RS           |---- RS 1 ----| \
    \ |---- RS 2 -----|\n         t--->\n                                 Figure 4\n\
    \   Use Case 4: Persistent Recording: A single Recording Session captures\n  \
    \    one or more Communication Sessions.\n                |--- CS 1 ---|     \

    \   Figure 5\n      A Recording Session records continuously without interruption.\n\
    \      Periods when there is no CS in progress must be reproduced upon\n     \
    \ playback (e.g., by recording silence during such periods, or by\n      not recording\
    \ such periods but marking them by means of metadata\n      for utilization on\
    \ playback, etc.).  Applications include\n      financial trading desks and emergency\
    \ (first-responder) service\n      bureaus.  The length of a Persistent Recording\
    \ Session is\n      independent from the length of the actual Communication Sessions.\n\
    \      Persistent Recording Sessions avoid issues such as media clipping\n   \
    \   that can occur due to delays in Recording Session establishment.\n      The\
    \ connection and attributes of media in the Recording Session\n      are not dynamically\
    \ signaled for each Communication Session before\n      it can be recorded; however,\
    \ codec re-negotiation is possible.\n      In some cases, more than one concurrent\
    \ Communication Session (on\n      a single end-user apparatus, e.g., trading-floor\
    \ turret) is mixed\n      into one Recording Session:\n                      \

    \ 6\n   Use Case 5: Real-time Recording Controls.\n      For an active Recording\
    \ Session, privacy or security reasons may\n      demand not capturing a specific\
    \ portion of a conversation.  An\n      example is for PCI (payment card industry)\
    \ compliance where credit\n      card information must be protected.  One solution\
    \ is not to record\n      a caller speaking their credit card information.\n \
    \     An example of a real-time control is Pause/Resume.\n   Use Case 6: IVR /\
    \ Voice Portal Recording.\n      Self-service Interactive Voice Response (IVR)\
    \ applications may\n      need to be recorded for application performance tuning\
    \ or to meet\n      compliance requirements.\n      Metadata about an IVR session\
    \ recording must include session\n      information and may include application\
    \ context information (e.g.,\n      VoiceXML session variables, dialog names,\
    \ etc.).\n   Use Case 7: Enterprise Mobility Recording.\n      Many agents and\
    \ enterprise workers whose calls are to be recorded\n      are not located on\
    \ company premises.\n      Examples:\n      o  Home-based agents or enterprise\
    \ workers.\n      o  Mobile phones of knowledge workers (e.g., insurance agents,\n\
    \         brokers, or physicians) when they conduct work-related (and\n      \
    \   legally required recording) calls.\n   Use Case 8: Geographically distributed\
    \ or centralized recording.\n      Enterprises such as banks, insurance agencies,\
    \ and retail stores\n      may have many locations, possibly up to thousands of\
    \ small sites.\n      Frequently, only phones and network infrastructure are installed\n\
    \      in branches, without local recording services.  In cases where\n      calls\
    \ inside or between branches must be recorded, a centralized\n      recording\
    \ system in data centers together with telephony\n      infrastructure (e.g.,\
    \ Private Branch Exchange (PBX)) may be\n      deployed.\n   Use Case 9: Record\
    \ complex call scenarios.\n      The following is an example of a scenario where\
    \ one call that is\n      recorded must be associated with a related call that\
    \ also must be\n      recorded.\n      o  A Customer is in a conversation with\
    \ a Customer Service Agent.\n      o  The Agent puts the Customer on hold in order\
    \ to consult with a\n         Supervisor.\n      o  The Agent enters into a conversation\
    \ with the Supervisor.\n      o  The Agent disconnects from the Supervisor, then\
    \ reconnects with\n         the Customer.\n      o  The Supervisor call must be\
    \ associated with the original\n         Customer call.\n   Use Case 10: High\
    \ availability and continuous recording.\n      Specific deployment scenarios\
    \ present different requirements for\n      system availability, error handling,\
    \ etc., including the\n      following:\n      o  An SRS must always be available\
    \ at call setup time.\n      o  No loss of media recording can occur, including\
    \ during failure\n         of an SRS.\n      o  The Communication Session must\
    \ be terminated (or suitable\n         notification given to parties) in the event\
    \ of a recording\n         failure.\n   Use Case 11: Record multi-channel, multimedia\
    \ session.\n      Some applications require the recording of more than one media\n\
    \      stream, possibly of different types.  Media are synchronized,\n      either\
    \ at storage or at playback.\n      Speech analytics technologies (e.g., word\
    \ spotting, emotion\n      detection, speaker identification) may require speaker-separated\n\
    \      recordings for optimum performance.\n      Multi-modal contact centers\
    \ may include audio, video, IM, or other\n      interaction modalities.\n    \
    \  In trading-floor environments, in order to minimize storage and\n      recording\
    \ system resources, it may be preferable to mix multiple\n      concurrent calls\
    \ (Communication Sessions) on different handsets/\n      speakers on the same\
    \ turret into a single recording session.\n   Use Case 12: Real-time media processing.\n\
    \      It must be possible for an SRS to support real-time media\n      processing,\
    \ such as speech analytics of trading-floor\n      interactions.  Real-time analytics\
    \ may be employed for automatic\n      intervention (stopping interaction or alerting)\
    \ if, for example, a\n      trader is not following regulations.\n      Speaker\
    \ separation is required in order to reliably detect who is\n      saying specific\
    \ phrases.\n"

  - "6.  Privacy Considerations\n   Respecting the privacy rights and wishes of users\
    \ engaged in a call\n   is of paramount importance.  In many jurisdictions, participants\
    \ have\n   a right to know that the session is being recorded or might be\n  \
    \ recorded, and they have a right to opt out, either by terminating the\n   call\
    \ or by demanding that the call not be recorded.  Therefore, this\n   document\
    \ contains requirements for being able to notify users that a\n   call is being\
    \ recorded and for users to be able to request that a\n   call not be recorded.\
    \  Use cases where users participating in a call\n   are not informed that the\
    \ call is or might be recorded are outside\n   the scope of this document.  In\
    \ particular, lawful intercept is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n  \
    \ Requirements for participant notification of recording vary widely by\n   jurisdiction.\
    \  In a given deployment, not all users will be\n   authorized to stop the recording\
    \ of a CS (although any user can\n   terminate its participation in a CS).  Typically,\
    \ users within the\n   domain that is carrying out the recording will be subject\
    \ to policies\n   of that domain concerning whether CSs are recorded.  For example,\
    \ in\n   a call center, agents will be subject to policies of the call center\n\
    \   and may or may not have the right to prevent the recording of a CS or\n  \
    \ part of a CS.  Users calling into the call center, on the other hand,\n   will\
    \ typically have to ask the agent not to record the CS.  If the\n   agent is unable\
    \ to prevent recording, or if the caller does not trust\n   the agent, the only\
    \ option generally is to terminate the CS.\n   Privacy considerations also extend\
    \ to what happens to a recording\n   once it has been created.  Typical issues\
    \ are who can access the\n   recording (e.g., receive a copy of the recording,\
    \ view the metadata,\n   play back the media, etc.), for what purpose the recording\
    \ can be\n   used (e.g., for training purposes, for quality control purposes,\n\
    \   etc.), and for how long the recording is to be retained before\n   deletion.\
    \  These are typically policies of the domain that makes the\n   recording, rather\
    \ than policies of individual users involved in a\n   recorded CS, whether those\
    \ users be in the same domain or in a\n   different domain.  Taking the call center\
    \ example again, agents might\n   be made aware of call center policy regarding\
    \ retention and use of\n   recordings as part of their employment contract, and\
    \ callers from\n   outside the call center might be given some information about\
    \ policy\n   when notified that a CS will be recorded (e.g., through an\n   announcement\
    \ that says that calls may be recorded for quality\n   purposes).\n   This document\
    \ does not specify any requirements for a user engaged in\n   a CS to be able\
    \ to dictate policy for what happens to a recording, or\n   for such information\
    \ to be conveyed from an SRC to an SRS.  It is\n   assumed that the SRS has access\
    \ to policy applicable to its\n   environment and can ensure that recordings are\
    \ stored and used in\n   accordance with that policy.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Session recording has substantial security implications,\
    \ for the SIP\n   UAs being recorded, the SRC, and the SRS.\n   For the SIP UAs\
    \ involved in the Communication Session, the\n   requirements in this document\
    \ enable the UA to identify that a\n   Communication Session is being recorded\
    \ and to request that a given\n   Communication Session not be subject to recording.\n\
    \   Since humans don't typically look at or know about protocol signaling\n  \
    \ such as SIP, and indeed the SIP session might have originated through\n   a\
    \ Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) gateway without any\n   ability to\
    \ pass on in-signaling indications of recording, users can\n   be notified of\
    \ recording in the media itself through voice\n   announcements, a visual indicator\
    \ on the endpoint, or other means.\n   With regard to security implications of\
    \ the protocol(s), clearly\n   there is a need for authentication, authorization,\
    \ and eavesdropping\n   protection for the solution.  The SRC needs to know the\
    \ SRS it is\n   communicating with is legitimate, and vice versa, even if they\
    \ are in\n   different domains.  Both the signaling and media for the Recording\n\
    \   Session need the ability to be authenticated and protected from\n   eavesdropping.\
    \  Requirements are detailed in Section 5.\n   Communication Sessions and Recording\
    \ Sessions can require different\n   security levels both for signaling and media,\
    \ depending on deployment\n   configurations.  For some environments, e.g., the\
    \ SRS and SRC will be\n   collocated in a secure network region, and therefore\
    \ the RS will not\n   require the same protection level as a CS that extends over\
    \ a public\n   network, for example.  For other environments, the SRS can be located\n\
    \   in a public cloud, for example, and the RS will require a higher\n   protection\
    \ level than the CS.  For these reasons, there is not a\n   direct relationship\
    \ between the security level of Communication\n   Sessions and the security level\
    \ of Recording Sessions.\n   A malicious or corrupt SRC can tamper with media\
    \ and metadata\n   relating to a CS before sending the data to an SRS.  Also,\
    \ CS media\n   and signaling can be tampered with in the network prior to reaching\n\
    \   an SRC, unless proper means are provided to ensure integrity\n   protection\
    \ during transmission on the CS.  Means for ensuring the\n   correctness of media\
    \ and metadata emitted by an SRC are outside the\n   scope of this work.  Other\
    \ organizational and technical controls will\n   need to be used to prevent tampering.\n"
