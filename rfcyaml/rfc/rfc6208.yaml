  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI) [CDMI-1], developed\
    \ by the\n   Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA), is the functional\n\
    \   interface that applications will use to create, retrieve, update, and\n  \
    \ delete data elements from the cloud.  As part of this interface, the\n   client\
    \ will be able to discover the capabilities of the cloud storage\n   offering\
    \ and use this interface to manage containers and the data\n   that is placed\
    \ in them.  In addition, metadata can be set on\n   containers and their contained\
    \ data elements through this interface.\n"

    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Cloud Data Management Domain and Its Relevance
  contents:
  - "2.  Cloud Data Management Domain and Its Relevance\n   A storage cloud is a storage\
    \ service hosted either on premise or off\n   premise, across a network.  An important\
    \ part of the cloud model, in\n   general, is the concept of a pool of resources\
    \ that are drawn from,\n   on demand, in small increments (smaller than what one\
    \ would typically\n   purchase by buying equipment).  By abstracting data storage\
    \ behind a\n   set of service interfaces and delivering it on demand, a wide range\n\
    \   of actual offerings and implementations are possible.  The only type\n   of\
    \ storage that is excluded from this definition is that which is\n   delivered\
    \ based on fixed capacity increments rather than on demand.\n   The CDMI defines\
    \ a set of functional interfaces (data paths) and\n   management interfaces (control\
    \ paths) to create, retrieve, update,\n   and delete data elements from a storage\
    \ cloud.  Another important\n   concept in this standard is that of metadata.\
    \  When managing large\n   amounts of data with differing requirements, metadata\
    \ is a convenient\n   mechanism to express those requirements in such a way that\
    \ underlying\n   data services can differentiate their treatment of the data to\
    \ meet\n   those requirements.  CDMI also defines an extensible metadata system\n\
    \   for storage clouds.\n   As part of the CDMI interface, the client will be\
    \ able to discover\n   the capabilities of the cloud storage offering and to use\
    \ this\n   interface to manage containers and the data that is placed in them.\n\
    \   In addition, system metadata can be added to containers and their\n   contained\
    \ data elements through this interface.\n   The hierarchy that CDMI defines is\
    \ as follows:\n   o  The basic element of storage is an object.\n   o  Objects\
    \ are stored in a container hierarchy.\n   o  CDMI also defines an object, called\
    \ a queue, which has special\n      properties for in-order, first-in, first-out\
    \ creation and fetching\n      of queue objects, similar to a container of data\
    \ objects.\n   o  A cloud offering can also support domains, which allow\n   \
    \   administrative ownership to be associated with stored objects.\n      Domains\
    \ can also be hierarchical, allowing for corporate domains\n      with multiple\
    \ children domains for departments or individuals.\n      The domain concept is\
    \ also used to map Access Control Lists (ACLs)\n      to principals as well as\
    \ to aggregate usage data that is used to\n      bill, meter, and monitor cloud\
    \ usage.  (Note: The CDMI \"domain\"\n      defined here is not a DNS domain name\
    \ as specified in [RFC1076]\n      and [RFC1024]).\n   o  Finally, a capabilities\
    \ resource and associated URI [RFC3986]\n      allows a client to discover the\
    \ capabilities of the offering and\n      its implementation of CDMI.\n"
- title: 3.  Processing Guidelines
  contents:
  - "3.  Processing Guidelines\n   This section summarizes the processing of each\
    \ media type.  This\n   document provides only the essential information.  The\
    \ CDMI\n   specification [CDMI-1], which has more details and appropriate\n  \
    \ examples, is the final authority on the processing aspects.\n"
- title: '3.1.  Media Type: application/cdmi-object'
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Media Type: application/cdmi-object\n   A CDMI object is the basic storage\
    \ element in a CDMI system and is\n   analogous to a file within a filesystem.\
    \  The object is represented\n   in the CDMI interface in JavaScript Object Notation\
    \ (JSON) format\n   [RFC4627].  (See the JSON web site at [JSON-1] for general\n\
    \   information about JSON).  Each data object has a set of well-defined\n   fields\
    \ that includes a single value and optional metadata.  The\n   implementations\
    \ are free to store the data in any form they choose,\n   but the application/cdmi-object\
    \ SHOULD be represented in the CDMI\n   interface as defined in Section 8 of the\
    \ CDMI specification [CDMI-1].\n"
- title: '3.2.  Media Type: application/cdmi-container'
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Media Type: application/cdmi-container\n   A container object is the fundamental\
    \ grouping of stored data within\n   CDMI and is analogous to a directory within\
    \ a filesystem.  Each\n   container has zero or more child objects and a set of\
    \ well-defined\n   fields that includes standardized and custom metadata.  A container\n\
    \   can include other containers similar to sub-directories in a\n   filesystem.\
    \  The implementations are free to represent the container\n   in any form they\
    \ choose, but the application/cdmi-container SHOULD be\n   represented in the\
    \ CDMI interface as defined in Section 9 of the CDMI\n   specification [CDMI-1].\n"
- title: '3.3.  Media Type: application/cdmi-domain'
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Media Type: application/cdmi-domain\n   Domain objects represent the concept\
    \ of administrative ownership of\n   stored data within a CDMI storage system.\
    \  A CDMI offering may\n   include a hierarchy of domains that provide access\
    \ to domain-related\n   information within a CDMI context.  This domain hierarchy\
    \ is a series\n   of CDMI objects that correspond to parent and child domains,\
    \ with\n   each domain corresponding to logical groupings of objects that are\
    \ to\n   be managed together.  Section 10 of the CDMI specification [CDMI-1]\n\
    \   details the information content, representation, and processing of\n   domain\
    \ objects.\n"
- title: '3.4.  Media Type: application/cdmi-capability'
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Media Type: application/cdmi-capability\n   Capability objects form a special\
    \ class of container objects that\n   allows a CDMI client to discover what subset\
    \ of the CDMI standard is\n   implemented by a CDMI provider.  For each URI in\
    \ a CDMI system, the\n   set of interactions that the system is capable of performing\
    \ against\n   that URI is described by the presence of named \"capabilities\"\
    .  Each\n   capability present for a given URI indicates what functionality the\n\
    \   cloud storage system will allow against that URI.  Capabilities are\n   always\
    \ static.  Section 12 of the CDMI specification [CDMI-1] details\n   the representation\
    \ and processing of capability objects.\n"
- title: '3.5.  Media Type: application/cdmi-queue'
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Media Type: application/cdmi-queue\n   Queues are a special class of container\
    \ object and are used to\n   provide first-in, first-out access when storing and\
    \ retrieving data.\n   A queue writer PUTs objects in the queue, and a queue reader\
    \ GETs\n   objects from the queue, acknowledging the receipt of the last object\n\
    \   that it received.  Queuing provides a simple mechanism for one or\n   more\
    \ writers to send data to a single reader in a reliable way.  If\n   queues are\
    \ supported by the cloud storage system, cloud clients\n   create the queue objects\
    \ by using the same mechanism used to create\n   data objects.  Section 11 of\
    \ the CDMI specification [CDMI-1] details\n   the operations and processing of\
    \ queue objects.\n"
- title: 4.  Transport Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Transport Considerations\n   The CDMI operates over HTTP [RFC2616] and does\
    \ not make sense outside\n   the HTTP realm.  We do not expect the CDMI to operate\
    \ over other\n   protocols nor to use a transport protocol, such as TCP [RFC793],\n\
    \   directly.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the following media types:\n\

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This section was developed with RFC 3552 [RFC3552]\
    \ as a guide.  CDMI\n   is an application interface and the relevant security\
    \ considerations\n   include confidentiality, integrity, access control, and audit.\n\
    \   Transport and endpoint security artifacts like Distributed Denial of\n   Service\
    \ (DDoS) are orthogonal, and domains like non-repudiation are\n   left to the\
    \ application that employs this interface.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Confidentiality and Integrity
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Confidentiality and Integrity\n   The confidentiality and integrity of\
    \ the CDMI exchanges are\n   determined by the application that uses the interface.\
    \  CDMI does not\n   contain any specific mechanisms and relies on transport mechanisms\n\
    \   such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) (see [RFC2818]) for\n   confidentiality\
    \ and integrity of the messages across the network.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Access Control
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Access Control\n   The access control of the CDMI endpoint URLs are beyond\
    \ this\n   specification.  If required, applications should use appropriate URL\n\
    \   authentication and authorization techniques, such as URI routers for\n   different\
    \ classes of users and restrict access based on URI origin.\n   For fine-grained\
    \ control of the CDMI objects, the CDMI specification\n   [CDMI-1] contains the\
    \ Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Access Control\n   Entries (ACEs).  These are\
    \ described fully in Section 16.1 of the\n   CDMI specification [CDMI-1].\n"
- title: 6.3.  Audit
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Audit\n   The CDMI specification [CDMI-1] has defined a set of metadata\
    \ fields,\n   as explained in Section 16.3, to facilitate the incorporation of\n\
    \   access and other audit markers.  The CDMI metadata system is\n   extensible,\
    \ and the implementations can add more metadata as required\n   by the security\
    \ posture of the domain.\n"
