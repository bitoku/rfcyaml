- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the Remote Operations and Abstract\
    \ Syntax for\n   the operation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) over an ISO\
    \ OSI\n   stack.\n   NTP itself is documented in great detail in RFC 1119.\n"
- title: 1.1  Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.1  Motivation\n   The motivation behind the implementation of a Remote Operations\n\
    \   Service implementation of NTP is fourfold.\n      1.  The inclusion of a useful\
    \ service to an OSI\n          environment.\n      2.  The feasibility of automatically\
    \ checking a ROS/ASN.1\n          specification, and automatically generating\
    \ code to\n          implement the protocol.\n      3.  The feasibility of running\
    \ NTP on connection oriented\n          network services (CONS or X.25), and consequentially,\n\
    \          the ability to use connection success or failure to\n          optimise\
    \ reachability discovery.\n      4.  The generalisation of the last point: the\
    \ use of ROS\n          makes NTP independent of the underlying communications\n\
    \          architecture.\n   The need for time synchronisation is clear, and RFC\
    \ 1119 indicates a\n   few of the necessary uses of this service.  However, it\
    \ is becoming\n   clear that OSI applications are very much in need of this service\n\
    \   too.  Not just in the local context but across the wide area.  For\n   example\
    \ much of the strong authentication outlined in X.511 is based\n   on encrypted\
    \ packets with time stamps to indicate how long the packet\n   is valid for. \
    \ If two hosts have clocks that are not closely\n   synchronised, the host with\
    \ the faster clock will be more prone to\n   cryptographic attacks from the slower,\
    \ and the slower host will\n   possibly find it is unauthentable.\n   A similar\
    \ problem occurs with the X.500 directory and the service\n   control limiting\
    \ the time allowed for the search.\n   Authentication between NTP peers and between\
    \ clients and servers is\n   not addressed here, as the choice of mechanism is\
    \ still the subject\n   of some debate.\n"
- title: 2.  Protocol Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Protocol Overview\n   The NTP application functions exactly as in RFC 1119.\
    \  The use of\n   remote operations and the underlying Application support means\
    \ that\n   for NTP daemons to peer with one another, they send an A-\n   ASSOCIATE.REQUEST,\
    \ and receive an A-ASSOCIATE.INDICATION.\n   On successful association, they subsequently\
    \ periodically invoke the\n   appropriate Remote Operation with the appropriate\
    \ parameters at the\n   appropriate frequency.\n   On failure, they mark the peer\
    \ as unreachable.\n   The states that an ntp daemon records for each peer are\
    \ enhanced from\n   RFC 1119 to include:\n      Connected: this indicates the\
    \ host is connected with its peer and\n      synchronisation data is being exchanged.\n\
    \      Connecting: this state indicates that a connection is in progress.\n  \
    \    Hosts at large distances may take several seconds to connect, and\n     \
    \ such blocking can perturb the exchange of data with other hosts.\n      Therefore,\
    \ the connection is made asynchronously.\n      Accepting: this state indicates\
    \ that a connection is being\n      accepted from another host, but the necessary\
    \ negotiation of\n      transport session etc has not been fulfilled yet.  This\
    \ is another\n      asynchronous part.\n      Disconnected: this state is reached\
    \ if the remote host cannot be\n      contacted.\n"
- title: 3.  Operation of the Protocol
  contents:
  - "3.  Operation of the Protocol\n   The use of a connection oriented service means\
    \ that the operation of\n   the NTP algorithm is slightly different.  This stems\
    \ firstly from\n   some necessary adjustments made to the protocol and secondly\
    \ from\n   some optimisations that are possible through the use of connections.\n\
    \   Firstly, the reachability of the host can be directly determined.\n   The\
    \ NTP protocol maintains a shift register to determine if it is\n   likely that\
    \ a peer is still responding and exchanging data.  This\n   works by recording\
    \ over the last eight transfers how many responses\n   have been received.  If\
    \ there have been no responses to the last\n   eight packets, then the host is\
    \ deemed unreachable.\n   Naturally, with a connection to the remote host, the\
    \ reachability is\n   immediately determinable.  Either a connection is established\
    \ or the\n   connection is broken or not yet made.  For this reason it is not\n\
    \   necessary to rely on the shift register to determine reachability.\n   Secondly,\
    \ there are a large number of optimisations that can be made\n   by use of the\
    \ connection oriented mode.  The NTP packet format can be\n   broken into several\
    \ categories.\n      a) Synchronisation data\n      b) Authentication data\n \
    \     c) Protocol data\n   Of these classes of data, only the first (a) is necessary\
    \ to maintain\n   the synchronisation between hosts.  Information such as protocol\n\
    \   version and the precision of the local clock are not likely to vary\n   over\
    \ the lifetime of the connection.  Likewise the authentication if\n   in use need\
    \ only be done at connection establishment and is not\n   necessarily required\
    \ for every packet.\n   For these reason, the NTP protocol can be simplified slightly\
    \ to\n   remove this information.  This can be seen in the specification for\n\
    \   the Packet in Appendix A.\n"
- title: 4.  Network Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Network Considerations\n   Although on first inspection it might be thought\
    \ that a high speed\n   network is necessary for accurate synchronisation, this\
    \ is not the\n   case.  What is more important is the dispersion of the packet\n\
    \   traversal times.  It is normally the case that a low speed network\n   with\
    \ little variance in packet transit times will give better results\n   than a\
    \ high speed network with large differences in individual packet\n   transit times.\
    \  This would lead us to think that connection oriented\n   networks with resource\
    \ allocation done at connection time might lead\n   to higher accuracies than\
    \ connectionless networks which can suffer\n   large swings in packet transit\
    \ time under high loading.  (This is\n   heresy!)\n"
- title: 5.  Implementation Model
  contents:
  - "5.  Implementation Model\n   Ideally, the implementor will provide interoperability\
    \ between the\n   existing UDP based NTP service, and a ROS based service.\n \
    \  To this end, the internal records that hold NTP state information,\n   can\
    \ be kept the same as existing implementations, and for\n   optimisation reasons,\
    \ the internal representations of NTP packets can\n   be the same.  Translation\
    \ between these and appropriate ROS/ASN\n   concrete encodings can be provided\
    \ by automatic translators such as\n   Rosy [ISODE].\n"
- title: 6.  Constructing NTP Data Fields
  contents:
  - "6.  Constructing NTP Data Fields\n   The way in which the data fields in the\
    \ Packet described in Appendix\n   A is unchanged from RFC 1119.  This simplifies\
    \ implementations based\n   on existing ones, and encourages interworking.\n"
- title: 7.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "7.  Discussion\n   From the limited testing of this model so far done, the results\
    \ would\n   seem to indicate that the ROS based model running over an X.25\n \
    \  service is of similar reliability as the UDP model.  Until further\n   experimentation\
    \ can be performed, specific data can not be given.\n   However, in the UK where\
    \ the most common method of time\n   synchronisation is the system administrators\
    \ watch and typing in the\n   time to the nearest minute, this method is clearly\
    \ far superior.\n   Connection management is transparent to NTP since it is implemented\n\
    \   beneath the Remote Operations Service.  However, an NTP\n   implementation\
    \ must have access to the status of connections, and\n   uses this not only for\
    \ reachability information but also to find the\n   information gleaned at connect\
    \ time and no longer exchanged in NTP\n   operations.\n"
- title: 8.  Prototype Experience
  contents:
  - "8.  Prototype Experience\n   There are a number of UK sites running NTP over\
    \ ROS over X.25 with an\n   earlier ROS specification, with at least one site\
    \ peering both over\n   ROS with UK sites on X.25, and over UDP with US Internet\
    \ sites.\n   Initial experience is promising.  The table below shows the\n   reachabilities,\
    \ delays, offsets and dispersions for the central UK\n   site peering with 2 JANET\
