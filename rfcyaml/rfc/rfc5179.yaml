  - "1.  Domain-Based Names for the Kerberos V GSS-API Mechanism\n   In accordance
    with [RFC5178], this document provides the mechanism-\n   specific details needed
    to implement GSS-API [RFC2743] domain-based\n   service names with the Kerberos
    V GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121].\n   GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE name SHOULD be
    mapped to Kerberos V\n   principal names as follows:\n   o  the <service> name
    becomes the first (0th) component of the\n      Kerberos V principal name;\n   o
    \ the <hostname> becomes the second component of the Kerberos V\n      principal
    name;\n   o  the <domain> name becomes the third component of the Kerberos V\n
    \     principal name;\n   o  the realm of the resulting principal name is that
    which\n      corresponds to the domain name, treated as a hostname.\n   The same
    name canonicalization considerations and methods as used\n   elsewhere in the
    Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121] and Kerberos\n   V [RFC4120] in general
    apply here.\n   Implementations SHOULD use a Kerberos V name-type of\n   NTT-SRVT-HST-DOMAIN
    (which has the value 12) but MAY use NT-UNKNOWN\n   instead.\n"

    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC2119].\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  Internationalization Considerations\n   It is unclear, at this time, how
    best to address internationalization\n   of Kerberos V domain-based principal
    names.  This is because the\n   Kerberos V core protocol internationalization
    project is incomplete.\n   However, clearly the best way to interoperate when
    using Kerberos V\n   domain-based principal names is to use ACE-encoded internationalized\n
    \  domain names [RFC3490] for the hostname and domain name slots of a\n   Kerberos
    V domain-based principal name.  Therefore Kerberos V GSS-API\n   mechanism implementations
    MUST do just that.\n"
  title: 3.  Internationalization Considerations
- contents:
  - "4.  Examples\n   o  The domain-based name, of generic form,\n      \"ldap@foo.example@ds1.foo.example\"
    may map to a Kerberos V\n      principal name like: \"ldap/ds1.foo.example/\n
    \     foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE\"\n   o  The domain-based name, of generic form,\n
    \     \"kadmin@foo.example@kdc1.foo.example\" may map to a Kerberos V\n      principal
    name like: \"kadmin/kdc1.foo.example/\n      foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE\"\n"
  title: 4.  Examples
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   See [RFC5178].\n   It is important for the security
    of protocols using the Kerberos V\n   GSS-API mechanism and domain-based names,
    that the realm of domain-\n   based principal names be derived from the hostname,
    rather than the\n   domain name slots of the input domain-based name string.\n"
