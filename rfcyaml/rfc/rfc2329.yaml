    \    OSPFv2, herein abbreviated simply as OSPF, is an IPv4 routing\n    protocol\
    \ documented\tin [Ref8]. OSPF\tis a link-state\trouting\n    protocol.  It is\
    \ designed to be run\tinternal to a single Autonomous\n    System.  Each OSPF\
    \ router maintains\tan identical database describing\n    the\tAutonomous System's\
    \ topology.  From this database, a routing\n    table is calculated\tby constructing\t\
    a shortest-path\ttree. OSPF\n    features include the following:\n    o\tOSPF\
    \ responds quickly to topology changes, expending a minimum\n\tof network bandwidth\
    \ in\tthe process.\n    o\tSupport\tfor CIDR addressing.\n    o\tOSPF routing\
    \ exchanges can be authenticated, providing routing\n\tsecurity.\n    o\tEqual-cost\
    \ multipath.\n    o\tAn area\trouting\tcapability is provided,\tenabling an Autonomous\n\
    \tsystem to be split into\ta two level hierarchy to further reduce\n\tthe amount\
    \ of routing protocol traffic.\n    o\tOSPF allows import of external routing\
    \ information into\tthe\n\tAutonomous System, including a tagging feature that\
    \ can\tbe\n\texploited to exchange extra information\tat the AS boundary (see\n\
    \t[Ref7]).\n    An analysis\tof OSPF\ttogether with a\tmore detailed description\
    \ of\n    OSPF features was originally provided in [Ref6], as\ta part of\n   \
    \ promoting OSPF to Draft Standard status. The analysis of OSPF\n    remains unchanged.\
    \ Two additional major features have been developed\n    for\tOSPF since the protocol\t\
    achieved Draft Standard\tstatus:\tthe\n    Point-to-MultiPoint\tinterface and\
    \ Cryptographic Authentication.\n    These features are described in Sections\
    \ 2.1 and 2.2 respectively of\n    this memo.\n    The\tOSPF MIB is documented\
    \ in [Ref4]. It is\tcurrently at Draft\n    Standard status.\n2.  Modifications\
    \ since\tDraft Standard status\n    OSPF became\ta Draft\tStandard with the release\
    \ of RFC 1583 [Ref3].\n    Implementations of the new specification in\t[Ref8]\
    \ are backward-\n    compatible with RFC\t1583. The differences between the two\
    \ documents\n    are\tdescribed in the Appendix Gs of\t[Ref1] and [Ref8]. These\n\
    \    differences\tare listed briefly below. Two major features were also\n   \
    \ added, the Point-to-MultiPoint interface and Cryptographic\n    Authentication,\
    \ which are described\tin separate sections.\n    o\tConfiguration requirements\
    \ for OSPF area address ranges\thave\n\tbeen relaxed to\tallow greater flexibility\
    \ in area assignment.\n\tSee Section G.3\tof [Ref1] for details.\n    o\tThe OSPF\
    \ flooding algorithm was\tmodified to a) improve database\n\tconvergence in networks\t\
    with low speed links b)\tresolve\ta\n\tproblem\twhere unnecessary LSA retransmissions\
    \ could occur as a\n\tresult of differing clock granularities, c) remove race\n\
    \tconditions between the flooding\tof MaxAge LSAs and the Database\n\tExchange\
    \ process, d) clarify the use of\tthe MinLSArrival\n\tconstant, and e) rate-limit\
    \ the\tresponse to less recent\tLSAs\n\treceived via flooding.\tSee Sections G.4\
    \ and G.5 of [Ref1] and\n\tSection\tG.1 of [Ref8] for details.\n    o\tTo resolve\
    \ the long-standing confusion regarding representation\n\tof point-to-point links\t\
    in OSPF, the specification now\n\toptionally allows advertisement\tof a stub link\
    \ to a point-to-\n\tpoint link's subnet, ala RIP. See Section G.6 of [Ref1].\n\
    \    o\tSeveral\tproblems involving advertising the same\texternal route\n\tfrom\
    \ multiple areas were found and fixed, as described in\n\tSection\tG.7 of [Ref1]\
    \ and Section G.2 of [Ref8].  Without the\n\tfixes, persistent routing loops\t\
    could form in certain such\n\tconfigurations.\tNote that one of the fixes was\
    \ not backward-\n\tcompatible, in that mixing routers implementing\tthe fixes\
    \ with\n\tthose implementing just\tRFC 1583 could cause loops not present\n\t\
    in an RFC 1583-only configuration. This\tcaused an\n\tRFC1583Compatibility global\
    \ configuration parameter to be added,\n\tas described in\tSection\tC.1 of [Ref1].\n\
    \    o\tIn order to deal with high delay links,\tretransmissions\tof\n\tinitial\t\
    Database Description packets no\tlonger reset an\tOSPF\n\tadjacency.\n    o\t\
    In order to detect link\tMTU mismatches,\twhich can cause\tproblems\n\tboth in\t\
    IP forwarding and in the OSPF routing protocol itself,\n\tMTU was\tadded to OSPF's\t\
    Database Description packets.\n\tNeighboring routers refuse to bring up an OSPF\
    \ adjacency unless\n\tthey agree on their common link's MTU.\n    o\tThe TOS\t\
    routing\toption was deleted from\tOSPF. However, for\n\tbackward compatibility\
    \ the formats of OSPF's various LSAs remain\n\tunchanged, maintaining the ability\
    \ to specify TOS metrics in\n\trouter-LSAs, summary-LSAs, ASBR-summary-LSAs, and\
    \ AS-external-\n\tLSAs.\n    o\tOSPF's routing table lookup algorithm was changed\
    \ to reflect\n\tcurrent\tpractice. The \"best match\" routing table entry is now\n\
    \talways selected\tto be the one providing\tthe most specific\n\t(longest) match.\
    \ See Section G.4 of [Ref8] for details.\n    2.1.  Point-to-MultiPoint interface\n\
    \tThe Point-to-MultiPoint\tinterface was added as an alternative to\n\tOSPF's\
    \ NBMA interface when running OSPF\tover non-broadcast\n\tsubnets. Unlike\tthe\
    \ NBMA interface, Point-to-MultiPoint\tdoes not\n\trequire\tfull mesh connectivity\
    \ over the\tnon-broadcast subnet.\n\tPoint-to-MultiPoint is less efficient than\
    \ NBMA, but is\teasier\n\tto configure (in fact, it can be self-configuring) and\
    \ is more\n\trobust than NBMA, tolerating all failures within the non-\n\tbroadcast\
    \ subnet.  For more information\ton the Point-to-\n\tMultiPoint interface, see\
    \ Section G.2 of [Ref1].\n\tThere are at least six independent implementations\
    \ of the\n\tPoint-to-MultiPoint interface. Interoperability\thas been\n\tdemonstrated\
    \ between at\tleast two pairs\tof implementations:\n\tbetween\t3com and Bay Networks,\
    \ and between cisco and Cascade.\n    2.2.  Cryptographic\tAuthentication\n\t\
    Non-trivial authentication was added to\tOSPF with the\n\tdevelopment of the Cryptographic\
    \ Authentication\ttype. This\n\tauthentication type uses any keyed message digest\
    \ algorithm,\n\twith explicit instructions included for\tthe use\tof MD5.\tFor\
    \ more\n\tinformation on OSPF authentication, see\tSection\t4.\n\tThere are at\
    \ least three independent implementations of\tthe OSPF\n\tCryptographic authentication\
    \ type. Interoperability has\tbeen\n\tdemonstrated between the implementations\
    \ from cisco and\tCascade.\n3.  Updated implementation and deployment experience\n\
    \    When OSPF was promoted to Draft Standard Status, a report was issued\n  \
    \  documenting\tcurrent\timplementation and deployment experience (see\n    [Ref6]).\
    \ That report is now\tquite dated. In\tan attempt to get more\n    current data,\
    \ a questionnaire was sent to OSPF mailing list\tin\n    January 1996. Twelve\
    \ responses were\treceived, from 11 router vendors\n    and\t1 manufacturer of\
    \ test equipment. These\tresponses represented 6\n    independent\timplementations.\
    \ A tabulation of the results are\n    presented below.\n    Table 1 indicates\
    \ the implementation, interoperability and\n    deployment of the major OSPF functions.\
    \ The\tnumber in each column\n    represents the number of responses in the affirmative.\n\

    \ attempt to ascertain the extent to which OSPF\tis currently\n    deployed, vendors\
    \ were also\tasked in January 1998 to provide\n    deployment estimates. Four\
    \ vendors of OSPF routers responded, with a\n    total estimate of 182,000 OSPF\
    \ routers in service, organized into\n    4300 separate OSPF routing domains.\n\
    4.  Protocol Security\n    All\tOSPF protocol exchanges\tare authenticated. OSPF\t\
    supports\n    multiple types of authentication; the type of authentication in\
    \ use\n    can\tbe configured on a per network segment basis. One of OSPF's\n\
    \    authentication types, namely the Cryptographic authentication\n    option,\
    \ is believed\tto be secure against passive attacks and provide\n    significant\t\
    protection against active attacks. When\tusing the\n    Cryptographic authentication\
    \ option, each router appends a \"message\n    digest\" to its transmitted OSPF\
    \ packets. Receivers then use\tthe\n    shared secret key and received digest\
    \ to verify that each received\n    OSPF packet\tis authentic.\n    The\tquality\t\
    of the security\tprovided by the\tCryptographic\n    authentication option depends\
    \ completely on\tthe strength of\tthe\n    message digest algorithm (MD5 is currently\
    \ the only\tmessage\tdigest\n    algorithm specified), the strength of the key\
    \ being\tused, and the\n    correct implementation of the security mechanism in\t\
    all\n    communicating OSPF implementations.\t It also requires that all\n   \
    \ parties maintain the secrecy of the\tshared secret key.\n    None of the\tOSPF\
    \ authentication types provide confidentiality. Nor\n    do they protect against\
    \ traffic analysis. Key management is\talso not\n    addressed by the OSPF specification.\n\
