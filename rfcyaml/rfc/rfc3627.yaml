  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In some cases, the operational decision may be to use IPv6 /127\n\
    \   prefix lengths, especially on point-to-point links between routers.\n   Under\
    \ certain situations, this may lead to one router claiming both\n   addresses\
    \ due to subnet-router anycast being implemented.  This\n   document discusses\
    \ the issue and offers a couple of solutions to the\n   problem; nevertheless,\
    \ /127 should be avoided between two routers.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [ADDRARCH] defines Subnet-router anycast address: in a subnet\
    \ prefix\n   of n bits, the last 128-n bits are all zero.  It is meant to be in\n\
    \   use of any one router in the subnet.\n   Even though having prefix length\
    \ longer than /64 is forbidden by\n   [ADDRARCH] section 2.4 for non-000/3 unicast\
    \ prefixes, using /127\n   prefix length has gained a lot of operational popularity;\
    \ it seems\n   like that these prefix lengths are being used heavily in point-to-\n\
    \   point links.  The operational practise has often been to use the\n   least\
    \ amount of address space especially in the presence of a large\n   number of\
    \ point-to-point links; it may be unlikely that all of these\n   links would start\
    \ to use /64's.  Using /127 has also other\n   operational benefits: you always\
    \ know which address the other end\n   uses, and there is no \"ping-pong\" [PINGPONG]\
    \ problem with older ICMP\n   implementations (fixed now in [ICMPv3]).\n"

  - "2.  Scope of this Memo\n   This memo does not advocate the use of long prefixes,\
    \ but brings up\n   problems for those that do want to use them, for one reason\
    \ or\n   another.\n   Detailed discussion on what is the \"right\" solution is\
    \ out of the\n   scope; it is not the goal of this memo to try to find the \"\
    best\"\n   addressing solution for everyone.\n"
- title: 3.  Problem with /127 and Two Routers
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem with /127 and Two Routers\n   Note that this problem does not exist\
    \ between a router and a host,\n   assuming the PREFIX::0/127 address is assigned\
    \ to the router.\n   Using /127 can be especially harmful on a point-to-point\
    \ link when\n   Subnet-router anycast address is implemented.  Consider the following\n\
    \   sequence of events:\n   1. Router A and Router B are connected by a point-to-point\
    \ link.\n   2. Neither has anything configured or set up on this link.\n   3.\
    \ 3ffe:ffff::1/127 address is added to Router A; now it performs\n      Duplicate\
    \ Address Detection (DAD) [NDISC] for 3ffe:ffff::1.\n      Router A also adds\
    \ the Subnet-router anycast address\n      3ffe:ffff::0/127.  (DAD is not performed\
    \ for anycast addresses.)\n   4. Now Router B has been planned and configured\
    \ to use\n      3ffe:ffff::0/127 as its unicast IPv6 address, but adding it will\n\
    \      fail DAD, and Router B does not have any address.\n   Similar scenarios\
    \ also happen during router reboots, crashes and\n   such.\n   The usability of\
    \ subnet-router anycast address between two routers on\n   a point-to-point link\
    \ is very questionable, but it is still a\n   mandated feature of [ADDRARCH].\
    \  Workarounds for this are presented\n   in the next section.\n   As of yet,\
    \ this kind of unexpected behavior hasn't been seen at large\n   perhaps because\
    \ the Subnet-router anycast address hasn't been\n   implemented or too widely\
    \ used.\n"
- title: 4.  Solutions
  contents:
  - "4.  Solutions\n   1. One could use /64 for subnets, including point-to-point\
    \ links.\n   2. One could use only link-local addresses, but that may make network\n\
    \      maintenance and debugging impractical at least in bigger networks;\n  \
    \    for example, \"traceroute\" can only return a list of nodes on the\n    \
    \  path, not the links which would have been used.\n   3. Failing that, /126 does\
    \ not have this problem, and it can be used\n      safely on a point-to-point\
    \ link (e.g., using the 2nd and the 3rd\n      address for unicast).  This is\
    \ analogous to using /30 for IPv4.\n      Using two /128 addresses is also one,\
    \ though often cumbersome,\n      approach.  Naturally, not much would be lost\
    \ if even a shorter\n      prefix was used, e.g., /112 or /120.\n      The author\
    \ feels that if /64 cannot be used, /112, reserving the\n      last 16 bits for\
    \ node identifiers, has probably the least amount\n      of drawbacks (also see\
    \ section 3).\n   4. [ADDRARCH] could be revised to state that Subnet-router anycast\n\
    \      address should not be used if the prefix length of the link is not\n  \
    \    /64 (or even longer than /120).  This does not seem like a good\n      approach,\
    \ as we should avoid making assumptions about prefix\n      lengths in the specifications,\
    \ to maintain future flexibility.\n      Also, in some cases, it might be usable\
    \ to have a Subnet-router\n      anycast address in some networks with a longer\
    \ prefix length.\n      A more conservative (implementation) approach would be\
    \ not using\n      Subnet-router anycast addresses in subnets with a prefix length\
    \ of\n      /127 if there are only two routers on the link: this can be\n    \
    \  noticed with [NDISC] 'Router' bit in Neighbor Advertisement\n      messages.\
    \  However, this seems to overload the functionality of\n      'R' bit, so it\
    \ does not look like a good approach in the long run.\n   5. It's also possible\
    \ to improve implementations: if /127 is used on\n      a point-to-point link,\
    \ never claim two addresses.  This has the\n      drawback that even if the router\
    \ using the combined unicast and\n      anycast address is down, the packets to\
    \ subnet-router anycast\n      address will be lost as the other cannot claim\
    \ the address.  This\n      approach might lead to unpredictability which would\
    \ be hard to\n      trace when debugging problems.  However, this would normally\
    \ be an\n      issue only when the Subnet-router anycast address is used from\n\
    \      outside of the link; usually, this cannot be done reliably as the\n   \
    \   prefix length or EUI64 u/g bits cannot be known for certain.\n      There\
    \ are other problems with an address being anycast and unicast\n      too: use\
    \ of it as a source address, whether to use unicast or\n      anycast semantics\
    \ in [NDISC], and others: allowing this behavior\n      would seem to only add\
    \ a lot of complexity to the implementations.\n   1) is definitely the best solution,\
    \ wherever it is possible.  2) may\n   be usable in some scenarios, but in larger\
    \ networks (where the most\n   often the desire would be to use longer prefix\
    \ length) it may be\n   deemed very impractical.  There are some situations where\
    \ one of\n   these may not be an option; then an operational work-around for this\n\
    \   operational problem, that is 3), appears to be the best course of\n   action.\
    \  This is because it may be very difficult to know whether all\n   implementations\
    \ implement some checks, like ones described in 4) or\n   5).\n"
- title: 5.  Other Problems with Long Prefixes
  contents:
  - "5.  Other Problems with Long Prefixes\n   These issues are not specific to /127.\n\
    \   One should note that [ADDRARCH] specifies universal/local bits (u/g),\n  \
    \ which are the 70th and 71st bits in any address from non-000/3 range.\n   When\
    \ assigning prefixes longer than 64 bits, these should be taken\n   into consideration;\
    \ in almost every case, u should be 0, as the last\n   64 bits of a long prefix\
    \ is very rarely unique.  'G' is still\n   unspecified, but defaults to zero.\
    \  Thus, all prefixes with u or g=1\n   should be avoided.\n   [MIPV6] specifies\
    \ \"Mobile IPv6 Home-Agents\" anycast address which is\n   used for Home Agent\
    \ Discovery.  In consequence, 7 last bits of have\n   been reserved in [ANYCAST]\
    \ of every non-000/3 non-multicast address,\n   similar to [ADDRARCH].  Thus,\
    \ at least /120 would seem to make sense.\n   However, as the sender must know\
    \ the destination's prefix length,\n   this \"reserved anycast addresses\" mechanism\
    \ is only applicable when\n   the sender knows about the link and expects that\
    \ there is a service\n   it needs there.  In the case of e.g., /126 between routers,\
    \ the only\n   to node to be found on this link would be the other router, so\
    \ the\n   mechanism does not seem useful.  At least, Mobile IPv6 Home Agent\n\
    \   Discovery should not be performed if the prefix length is longer than\n  \
    \ /120.\n"
