    \ Switched Path (TE-LSP) is an LSP that transits through at least two\n   IGP\
    \ areas.  In a multi-area network, topology visibility remains\n   local to a\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4105] lists a set of motivations and requirements for\
    \ setting up\n   TE-LSPs across IGP area boundaries.  These LSPs are called inter-area\n\
    \   TE-LSPs.  These requirements include the computation of inter-area\n   shortest\
    \ constrained paths with a key guideline being to respect the\n   IGP hierarchy\
    \ concept, and particularly the containment of topology\n   information.  The\
    \ main challenge with inter-area MPLS-TE lies in path\n   computation.  Indeed,\
    \ the head-end LSR cannot compute an explicit\n   path across areas, as its topology\
    \ visibility is limited to its own\n   area.\n   Inter-area path computation is\
    \ one of the key applications of the\n   PCE-based architecture [RFC4655].  The\
    \ computation of optimal inter-\n   area paths may be achieved using the services\
    \ of one or more PCEs.\n   Such PCE-based inter-area path computation could rely\
    \ for instance on\n   a single multi-area PCE that has the TE database of all\
    \ the areas in\n   the IGP domain and can directly compute an end-to-end constrained\n\
    \   shortest path.  Alternatively, this could rely on the cooperation\n   between\
    \ PCEs whereby each PCE covers one or more IGP areas and the\n   full set of PCEs\
    \ covers all areas.\n   The generic requirements for a PCE Communication Protocol\
    \ (PCECP),\n   which allows a PCC to send path computation requests to a PCE and\
    \ the\n   PCE to send path computation responses to a PCC, are set forth in\n\
    \   [RFC4657].  The use of a PCE-based approach for inter-area path\n   computation\
    \ implies specific requirements on a PCE Communication\n   Protocol, in addition\
    \ to the generic requirements already listed in\n   [RFC4657].  This document\
    \ complements these generic requirements by\n   listing a detailed set of PCECP\
    \ requirements specific to inter-area\n   path computation.\n   It is expected\
    \ that PCECP procedures be defined to satisfy these\n   requirements.\n   Note\
    \ that PCE-based inter-area path computation may require a\n   mechanism for automatic\
    \ PCE discovery across areas, which is out of\n   the scope of this document.\
    \  Detailed requirements for such a\n   mechanism are discussed in [RFC4674].\n"

- title: 3.  Motivations for PCE-Based Inter-Area Path Computation
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivations for PCE-Based Inter-Area Path Computation\n   IGP hierarchy enables\
    \ improved IGP scalability by dividing the IGP\n   domain into areas and limiting\
    \ the flooding scope of topology\n   information to within area boundaries.  A\
    \ router in an area has full\n   topology information for its own area, but only\
    \ information about\n   reachability to destinations in other areas.  Thus, a\
    \ head-end LSR\n   cannot compute an end-to-end path that crosses the boundary\
    \ of its\n   IGP area(s).\n   A current solution for computing inter-area TE-LSP\
    \ path relies on a\n   per-domain path computation [PD-COMP].  It is based on\
    \ loose hop\n   routing with an ERO expansion on each ABR.  This allows an LSP\
    \ to be\n   set up following a constrained path, but faces two major limitations:\n\
    \   - This does guarantee the use of an optimal constrained path.\n   - This may\
    \ lead to several crankback signaling messages and hence\n     delay the LSP setup,\
    \ and may also invoke possible alternate routing\n     activities.\n   Note that,\
    \ here, by optimal constrained path we mean the shortest\n   constrained path\
    \ across multiple areas, taking into account either\n   the IGP or TE metric [RFC3785].\
    \  In other words, such a path is the\n   path that would have been computed by\
    \ making use of some CSPF\n   algorithm in the absence of multiple IGP areas.\n\
    \   The PCE-based architecture [RFC4655] is well suited to inter-area\n   path\
    \ computation.  It allows the path computation limitations\n   resulting from\
    \ the limited topology visibility to be overcome by\n   introducing path computation\
    \ entities with more topology visibility,\n   or by allowing cooperation between\
    \ path computation entities in each\n   area.\n   There are two main approaches\
    \ for the computation of an inter-area\n   optimal path:\n   - Single-PCE computation:\
    \ The path is computed by a single PCE that\n     has topology visibility in all\
    \ areas and can compute an end-to-end\n     optimal constrained path on its own.\n\
    \   - Multiple-PCE computation with inter-PCE communication: The path\n     computation\
    \ is distributed on multiple PCEs, which have partial\n     topology visibility.\
    \  They compute path segments in their domains\n     of visibility and collaborate\
    \ with each other so as to arrive at an\n     end-to-end optimal constrained path.\
    \  Such collaboration is ensured\n     thanks to inter-PCE communication.\n  \
    \ Note that the use of a PCE-based approach to perform inter-area path\n   computation\
    \ implies specific functional requirements in a PCECP, in\n   addition to the\
    \ generic requirements listed in [RFC4657].  These\n   specific requirements are\
    \ discussed in the next section.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Control and Recording of Area Crossing\n   In addition to the path constraints\
    \ specified in [RFC4657], the\n   request message MUST allow indicating whether\
    \ or not area crossing is\n   permitted.  Indeed, when the source and destination\
    \ reside in the\n   same IGP area, there may be intra-area and inter-area feasible\
    \ paths.\n   As set forth in [RFC4105], if the shortest path is an inter-area\n\
    \   path, an operator either may want to avoid, as far as possible,\n   crossing\
    \ areas and thus may prefer selecting a sub-optimal intra-area\n   path or, conversely,\
    \ may prefer to use a shortest path, even if it\n   crosses areas.\n   Also, when\
    \ the source and destination reside in the same area it may\n   be useful to know\
    \ whether the returned path is an inter-area path.\n   Hence, the response message\

    \ be strictly explicit\n   or loose (e.g., a list of ABRs as loose hops).  It\
    \ may be useful to\n   indicate to the PCE if a Strict Explicit path is required\
    \ or not.\n   Hence, the PCECP request message MUST allow indicating whether a\n\

  contents:
  - "4.4.  PCE List Enforcement and Recording in Multiple-PCE Computation\n   In case\
    \ of multiple-PCE inter-area path computation, a PCC may want\n   to indicate\
    \ a preferred list of PCEs to be used, one per area.  In\n   each area, the preferred\
    \ PCE should be tried before another PCE is\n   selected.  Note that if there\
    \ is no preferred PCE indicated for an\n   area, any PCE in that area may be used.\n\
    \   Hence, the PCECP request message MUST support the inclusion of a list\n  \
    \ of preferred PCEs per area.  Note that this requires that a PCC in\n   one area\
    \ has knowledge of PCEs in other areas.  This could rely on\n   configuration\
    \ or on a PCE discovery mechanism, allowing discovery\n   across area boundaries\
    \ (see [RFC4674]).\n   Also, it would be useful to know the list of PCEs that\
    \ effectively\n   participated in the computation.  Hence, the request message\
    \ MUST\n   support a request for PCE recording, and the response message MUST\n\
    \   support the recording of the set of one or more PCEs that took part\n   in\
    \ the computation.\n   It may also be useful to know the path segments computed\
    \ by each PCE.\n   Hence, the request message SHOULD allow a request for the\n\
    \   identification of path segments computed by a PCE, and the response\n   message\
