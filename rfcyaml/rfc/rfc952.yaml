  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This RFC is the official specification of the format\
    \ of the Internet\n   Host Table.  This edition of the specification includes\
    \ minor\n   revisions to RFC-810 which brings it up to date. Distribution of this\n\

- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The DoD Host Table is utilized by the DoD Hostname Server maintained\n\
    \   by the DDN Network Information Center (NIC) on behalf of the Defense\n   Communications\
    \ Agency (DCA) [See RFC-953].\n"
- title: LOCATION OF THE STANDARD DOD ONLINE HOST TABLE
  contents:
  - "LOCATION OF THE STANDARD DOD ONLINE HOST TABLE\n   A machine-translatable ASCII\
    \ text version of the DoD Host Table is\n   online in the file NETINFO:HOSTS.TXT\
    \ on the SRI-NIC host.  It can be\n   obtained via FTP from your local host by\
    \ connecting to host\n   SRI-NIC.ARPA (26.0.0.73 or 10.0.0.51), logging in as\
    \ user =\n   ANONYMOUS, password = GUEST, and retrieving the file\n   \"NETINFO:HOSTS.TXT\"\
    .  The same table may also be obtained via the NIC\n   Hostname Server, as described\
    \ in RFC-953.  The latter method is\n   faster and easier, but requires a user\
    \ program to make the necessary\n   connection to the Name Server.\n"
- title: ASSUMPTIONS
  contents:
  - "ASSUMPTIONS\n   1. A \"name\" (Net, Host, Gateway, or Domain name) is a text\
    \ string up\n   to 24 characters drawn from the alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9),\
    \ minus\n   sign (-), and period (.).  Note that periods are only allowed when\n\
    \   they serve to delimit components of \"domain style names\". (See\n   RFC-921,\
    \ \"Domain Name System Implementation Schedule\", for\n   background).  No blank\
    \ or space characters are permitted as part of a\n   name. No distinction is made\
    \ between upper and lower case.  The first\n   character must be an alpha character.\
    \  The last character must not be\n   a minus sign or period.  A host which serves\
    \ as a GATEWAY should have\n   \"-GATEWAY\" or \"-GW\" as part of its name.  Hosts\
    \ which do not serve as\n   Internet gateways should not use \"-GATEWAY\" and\
    \ \"-GW\" as part of\n   their names. A host which is a TAC should have \"-TAC\"\
    \ as the last\n   part of its host name, if it is a DoD host.  Single character\
    \ names\n   or nicknames are not allowed.\n   2. Internet Addresses are 32-bit\
    \ addresses [See RFC-796].  In the\n"

  - "DOD INTERNET HOST TABLE SPECIFICATION\n   host table described herein each address\
    \ is represented by four\n   decimal numbers separated by a period.  Each decimal\
    \ number\n   represents 1 octet.\n   3. If the first bit of the first octet of\
    \ the address is 0 (zero),\n   then the next 7 bits of the first octet indicate\
    \ the network number\n   (Class A Address).  If the first two bits are 1,0 (one,zero),\
    \ then\n   the next 14 bits define the net number (Class B Address).  If the\n\
    \   first 3 bits are 1,1,0 (one,one,zero), then the next 21 bits define\n   the\
    \ net number (Class C Address) [See RFC-943].\n      This is depicted in the following\
    \ diagram:\n      +-+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\n\
    \      |0|  NET <-7-> |         LOCAL ADDRESS <-24->               |\n      +-+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\n\

    \   4. The LOCAL ADDRESS portion of the internet address identifies a\n   host\
    \ within the network specified by the NET portion of the address.\n   5. The ARPANET\
    \ and MILNET are both Class A networks.  The NET portion\n   is 10 decimal for\
    \ ARPANET, 26 decimal for MILNET, and the LOCAL\n   ADDRESS maps as follows: the\
    \ second octet identifies the physical\n   host, the third octet identifies the\
    \ logical host, and the fourth\n   identifies the Packet Switching Node (PSN),\
    \ formerly known as an\n   Interface Message Processor (IMP).\n      +-+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\n\

    \      (NOTE:  RFC-796 also describes the local address mappings for\n      several\
    \ other networks.)\n   6. It is the responsibility of the users of this host table\
    \ to\n   translate it into whatever format is needed for their purposes.\n   7.\
