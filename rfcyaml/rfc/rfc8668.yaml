  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are deployments where the Layer 3 interface on which
    an IS-IS\n   adjacency is established is a Layer 2 interface bundle, for instance,\n
    \  a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) [IEEE802.1AX].  This reduces the\n   number
    of adjacencies that need to be maintained by the routing\n   protocol in cases
    where there are parallel links between the\n   neighbors.  Entities external to
    IS-IS such as Path Computation\n   Elements (PCEs) [RFC4655] may wish to control
    traffic flows on\n   individual members of the underlying Layer 2 bundle.  In
    order to do\n   so, link attribute information about individual bundle members
    is\n   required.  The protocol extensions defined in this document provide\n   the
    means to advertise this information.\n   This document introduces a new TLV to
    advertise link attribute\n   information for each of the L2 Bundle Members that
    comprise the Layer\n   3 interface on which IS-IS operates.\n   [RFC8667] introduces
    a new link attribute, adjacency segment\n   identifier (Adj-SID), which can be
    used as an instruction to\n   forwarding to send traffic over a specific link.
    \ This document\n   introduces additional sub-TLVs to advertise Adj-SIDs for L2
    Bundle\n   Members.\n   Note that the new advertisements defined in this document
    are\n   intended to be provided to external (to IS-IS) entities.  The\n   following
    items are intentionally not defined and/or are outside the\n   scope of this document:\n
    \  *  What link attributes will be advertised.  This is determined by\n      the
    needs of the external entities.\n   *  A minimum or default set of link attributes.\n
    \  *  How these attributes are configured.\n   *  How the advertisements are used.\n
    \  *  What impact the use of these advertisements may have on traffic\n      flow
    in the network.\n   *  How the advertisements are passed to external entities.\n"

  - "3.  L2 Bundle Member Attributes TLV\n   A new TLV is introduced to advertise
    L2 Bundle Member attributes.\n   Although much of the information is identical
    to and uses the same\n   sub-TLVs included in Extended IS Neighbor advertisements
    (TLVs 22 and\n   222), a new TLV is used so that changes to the advertisement
    of the\n   L2 Bundle Member link attributes do not trigger unnecessary action
    by\n   the [ISO10589] Decision Process.\n   Advertisement of this information
    implies that the identified link is\n   a member of the L2 Bundle associated with
    the identified Parent L3\n   Neighbor and that the member link is operationally
    up.  Therefore,\n   advertisements MUST be withdrawn if the link becomes operationally\n
    \  down or it is no longer a member of the identified L2 Bundle.\n   This new
    TLV utilizes the sub-TLV space defined for TLVs 22, 23, 141,\n   222, and 223.\n
    \  The following new TLV is introduced:\n      L2 Bundle Member Attributes\n      Type:
    25\n      Length: Number of octets to follow\n      Parent L3 Neighbor Descriptor\n
    \        L3 Neighbor System ID + pseudonode ID (7 octets)\n         Flags:  1-octet
    field of the following flags:\n             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \           |P|             |\n            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n            where:\n
    \           P-Flag:  When set to 1, one of the sub-TLVs described in\n                     Section
    3.1 immediately follows the flags field.\n                     If the P-Flag is
    set to 0, then none of the sub-\n                     TLVs described in Section
    3.1 are present.\n            Other bits:  MUST be zero when originated and ignored
    when\n                     received.\n      One or more L2 Bundle Attribute Descriptors
    (as defined below).\n         Length of L2 Bundle Attribute Descriptor (1 octet)\n
    \           NOTE: This includes all fields described below.\n         Number of
    L2 Bundle Member Descriptors (1 octet)\n         L2 Bundle Member Link Local Identifiers\n

    An L2 Bundle Member Descriptor is a Link Local\n            Identifier as defined
    in [RFC4202].\n         Sub-TLV(s)\n         A sub-TLV may define an attribute
    common to all of the bundle\n         members listed, or it may define an attribute
    unique to each\n         bundle member.  Use of these two classes of sub-TLVs
    is\n         described in the following sections.\n      NOTE: Only one Parent
    L3 Neighbor Descriptor is present in a given\n      TLV.  Multiple L2 Bundle Attribute
    Descriptors may be present in a\n      single TLV.\n"

    - "3.1.  Parallel L3 Adjacencies\n   When there exist multiple L3 adjacencies
      to the same neighbor,\n   additional information is required to uniquely identify
      the L3\n   Neighbor.  One and only one of the following three sub-TLVs is used\n
      \  to uniquely identify the L3 adjacency:\n   *  IPv4 Interface Address (sub-TLV
      6 defined in [RFC5305])\n   *  IPv6 Interface Address (sub-TLV 12 defined in
      [RFC6119])\n   *  Link Local/Remote Identifiers (sub-TLV 4 defined in [RFC5307])\n
      \  When the P-Flag is set in the flags field in the Parent L3 Neighbor\n   Descriptor,
      one and only one of the above sub-TLVs MUST be present.\n   The chosen sub-TLV
      MUST immediately follow the flags field described\n   in Section 3.\n   These
      sub-TLVs MAY be omitted if no parallel adjacencies to the\n   neighbor exist.\n"

      Member Attribute\n   Descriptor.  No more than one copy of a given sub-TLV in
      this\n   category may appear in the set of sub-TLVs under the preceding L2\n
      \  Bundle Member Attribute Descriptor.  If multiple copies of a given\n   sub-TLV
      are present, all copies MUST be ignored.\n   The set of L2 Bundle Member Descriptors
      that may be advertised under\n   a single L2 Bundle Member Attribute Descriptor
      is therefore limited\n   to bundle members that share the set of attributes
      advertised in the\n   shared attribute sub-TLVs.\n   All existing sub-TLVs defined
      in the IANA registry for Sub-TLVs for\n   TLVs 22, 23, 141, 222, and 223 are

    of a single\n   Adj-SID.  As it is expected that each L2 Bundle Member will have\n
    \  unique Adj-SIDs in many deployments, it is desirable to define a new\n   sub-TLV
    that allows more efficient encoding of a set of Adj-SIDs in a\n   single sub-TLV.
    \ Two new sub-TLVs are therefore introduced to support\n   advertising Adj-SIDs
    for L2 Bundle Members.  The format of the new\n   sub-TLVs is similar to that
    used for L3 adjacencies, but it is\n   optimized to allow advertisement of a set
    of Adj-SIDs (one per L2\n   Bundle Member) in a single sub-TLV.\n   The two new

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The IS-IS protocol has supported the advertisement
    of link attribute\n   information, including link identifiers, for many years.
    \ The\n   advertisements defined in this document are identical to existing\n
    \  advertisements defined in [RFC4202], [RFC5305], [RFC8570], and\n   [RFC8667],
    but are associated with L2 links that are part of a bundle\n   interface on which
    the IS-IS protocol operates.  There are therefore\n   no new security issues introduced
    by the extensions in this document.\n   As always, if the protocol is used in
    an environment where\n   unauthorized access to the physical links on which IS-IS
    Protocol\n   Data Units (PDUs) are sent occurs, then attacks are possible.  The\n
    \  use of authentication as defined in [RFC5304] and [RFC5310] is\n   recommended
    to prevent such attacks.\n"
