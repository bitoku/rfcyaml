  - "                          LINK USAGE VIOLATION\n   We have noticed that TENEX\
    \ systems use link numbers outside the\n   allowed range.  This is a violation\
    \ of the official HOST-HOST\n   protocol.  This causes problems with some sites\
    \ when attempting to\n   establish connections with TENEX systems.  We urge that\
    \ this problem\n   be corrected by bringing all TENEX systems into conformance\
    \ with the\n   established official protocol\n          [This RFC was put into\
    \ machine readable form for entry]\n      [into the online RFC archives by Helene\
    \ Morin, Via Genie 12/99]\n"
