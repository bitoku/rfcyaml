    \ Draft Standards, or\n   Standards.  Since the status of these RFCs may change\
    \ during the\n   standards processing, we note here only that they are on the\n\
    \   standards track.  Please see the latest edition of \"Internet Official\n \

    \                  Destinations\nThis brief paper offers a perspective on the\
    \ subject of names of\ndestinations in data communication networks. It suggests\
    \ two ideas:\nFirst, it is helpful to distinguish among four different kinds of\n\
    objects that may be named as the destination of a packet in a network.\nSecond,\
    \ the operating system concept of binding is a useful way to\ndescribe the relations\
    \ among the four kinds of objects.  This memo\nprovides information for the Internet\
