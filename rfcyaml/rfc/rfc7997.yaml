- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a\
    \ more\n   diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for\n\
    \   the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the\n   required\
    \ language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will be\n   in UTF-8, allowing\
    \ for a broader range of characters than typically\n   used in the English language.\
    \  This document describes the RFC Editor\n   requirements and gives guidance\
    \ regarding the use of non-ASCII\n   characters in RFCs.\n   This document updates\
    \ RFC 7322.  Please view this document in PDF\n   form to see the full text.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Please review the PDF version of this draft.\n   For much\
    \ of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding\n   used for RFCs has\
    \ been ASCII [RFC20].  This was a sensible choice at\n   the time: the language\
    \ of the Series has always been English, a\n   language that primarily uses ASCII-encoded\
    \ characters (ignoring for a\n   moment words borrowed from more richly decorated\
    \ alphabets); and,\n   ASCII is the \"lowest common denominator\" for character\
    \ encoding,\n   making cross-platform viewing trivial.\n   There are limits to\
    \ ASCII, however, that hinder its continued use as\n   the exclusive character\
    \ encoding for the Series.  The increasing need\n   for easily readable, internationalized\
    \ content suggests it is time to\n   allow non-ASCII characters in RFCs where\
    \ necessary.  To support this\n   move away from ASCII, RFCs will switch to supporting\
    \ UTF-8 as the\n   default character encoding and will allow support for a broad\
    \ range\n   of Unicode characters [UnicodeCurrent].  Note that the RFC Editor\
    \ may\n   reject any code point that does not render adequately across all\n \
    \  formats or in enough rendering engines using the v3 tooling.\n   Given the\
    \ continuing goal of maximum readability across platforms,\n   the use of non-ASCII\
    \ characters should be limited to only where\n   necessary within the text.  This\
    \ document describes the rules under\n   which non-ASCII characters may be used\
    \ in an RFC.  These rules will\n   be applied as the necessary changes are made\
    \ to submission checking\n   and editorial tools.\n   This document updates the\
    \ RFC Style Guide [RFC7322].\n   The details included in this document are expected\
    \ to change based on\n   experience gained in implementing the new publication\
    \ toolsets.\n   Revised documents will be published capturing those changes as\
    \ the\n   toolsets are completed.  Other implementers must not expect those\n\
    \   changes to remain backwards compatible with the details included in\n   this\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 2.  Basic Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Basic Requirements\n   Two fundamental requirements inform the guidance and\
    \ examples\n   provided in this document.  They are:\n   o  Searches against RFC\
    \ indexes and database tables need to return\n      expected results and support\
    \ appropriate Unicode string matching\n      behaviors;\n   o  RFCs must be able\
    \ to be displayed correctly across a wide range of\n      readers and browsers.\
    \  People whose systems do not have the fonts\n      needed to display a particular\
    \ RFC need to be able to read the\n      various publication formats and the XML\
    \ correctly in order to\n      understand and implement the information described\
    \ in the\n      document.\n"
- title: 3.  Rules for the Use of Non-ASCII Characters
  contents:
  - "3.  Rules for the Use of Non-ASCII Characters\n   This section describes the\
    \ guidelines for the use of non-ASCII\n   characters in an RFC.  If the RFC Editor\
    \ identifies areas where the\n   use of non-ASCII characters negatively impacts\
    \ the readability of the\n   text, they will request alternate text.\n   The RFC\
    \ Editor may, in cases of entire words represented in non-ASCII\n   characters,\
    \ ask for a set of reviewers to verify the meaning,\n   spelling, characters,\
    \ and grammar of the text.\n"
- title: 3.1.  General Usage throughout a Document
  contents:
  - "3.1.  General Usage throughout a Document\n   Where the use of non-ASCII characters\
    \ is purely part of an example\n   and not otherwise required for correct protocol\
    \ operation, escaping\n   the non-ASCII character is not required.  Note, however,\
    \ that as the\n   language of the RFC Series is English, the use of non-ASCII\n\
    \   characters is based on the spelling of words commonly used in the\n   English\
    \ language following the guidance in the Merriam-Webster\n   dictionary [MerrWeb].\n\
    \   The RFC Editor will use the primary spelling listed in that\n   dictionary\
    \ by default.\n   Example of non-ASCII characters that do not require escaping\
    \ (example\n   from Section 3.1.1.12 of RFC 4475 [RFC4475], with a hex dump replaced\n\
    \   by the actual character glyphs):\n   This particular response contains unreserved\
    \ and non-ASCII\n   UTF-8 characters.\n   This response is well formed.  A parser\

  - "3.6.  Code Components\n   The RFC Editor encourages the use of the U+ notation\
    \ except within a\n   code component where one must follow the rules of the programming\n\
    \   language in which the code is being written.\n   Code components are generally\
    \ expected to use fixed-width fonts.\n   Where such fonts are not available for\
    \ a particular script, the best\n   script-appropriate font will be used for that\
    \ part of the code\n   component.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Bibliographic Text
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Bibliographic Text\n   The reference entry must be in English; whatever\
    \ subfields are\n   present must be available in ASCII-encoded characters.  For\n\
    \   references to RFCs and Internet-Drafts, the author's name will be\n   formatted\
    \ in the reference as per current RFC Style Guide\n   recommendations.  As long\
    \ as good sense is used, the reference entry\n   may also include non-ASCII characters\
    \ at the author's discretion and\n   as provided by the author.  The RFC Editor\
    \ may request that a third\n   party, such as a language specialist or subject\
    \ matter expert, review\n   of any non-ASCII reference.  This applies to both\
    \ normative and\n   informative references.\n   Example:\n   [GOST3410] \"Information\
    \ technology. Cryptographic data security.\n              Signature and verification\
    \ processes of [electronic]\n              digital signature.\", GOST R 34.10-2001,\

- title: 3.9.  Address Information
  contents:
  - "3.9.  Address Information\n   The purpose of providing address information, either\

    \ by\n   their company or local postal service without additional non-ASCII\n\
    \   character escapes.  If the email address includes non-ASCII\n   characters\
    \ and is a valid email address at the time of publication,\n   non-ASCII character\
    \ escapes are not required.\n   Example:\n     Qin Wu (editor)\n     Huawei\n\

- title: 5.  XML Markup
  contents:
  - "5.  XML Markup\n   As described above, use of non-ASCII characters in areas such\
    \ as\n   email, company name, address, and name is allowed.  In order to make\n\
    \   it easier for code to identify the appropriate ASCII alternatives,\n   authors\
    \ must include an \"ascii\" attribute to their XML markup when an\n   ASCII alternative\
    \ is required.  See [RFC7991] for more detail on how\n   to tag ASCII alternatives.\n"
- title: 6.  Internationalization Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Internationalization Considerations\n   The ability to use non-ASCII characters\
    \ in RFCs in a clear and\n   consistent manner will improve the ability to describe\n\
    \   internationalized protocols and will recognize the diversity of\n   authors.\
    \  However, the goal of readability will override the use of\n   non-ASCII characters\
    \ within the text.\n"
