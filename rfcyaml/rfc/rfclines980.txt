This RFC indicates how to obtain various protocol documents used in the DARPA research community.
Included is an overview of the new 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook and available sources for obtaining related documents (such as, DoD, ISO, and CCITT).
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
How to get the Requests for Comments (RFCs): RFCs are the working memos of the DARPA research community.
The subjects may include protocol specifications, interface definitions, program descriptions, policy statements, trouble reports, algorithms, announcements, and humor.
These may range from wild ideas and crazy suggestions, to firm specifications.
The normal method for distribution of RFCs is for interested parties to copy the documents from the DDN Network Information Center's (NIC) online library using FTP.
Public access files may be copied from the RFC directory on the SRI NIC.ARPA host computer via FTP with username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.
The pathname of RFC nnn is RFC:RFCnnn.
Requests for special distribution should be addressed to either the author of the RFC in question or to
Unless specifically noted otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are for unlimited distribution.
For hardcopy distribution from the NIC there is a charge of $5 for each RFC that is less than 100 pages, and $10 for each RFC that is 100 pages or more to cover the cost of postage and handling (check, money order, or purchase order accepted).

: It has been about 5 years since the release of the Internet Protocol Transition Workbook (IPTW) and the related documents which were issued as a document set for implementors of TCP/IP and related application protocols.
These were issued to assist the NCP to TCP transition which took place in early 1983.
Since that time the network has undergone many changes, the most noteable being the creation of the Defense Data Network (DDN) and
the ARPANET/MILNET split, leaving the ARPANET as a research and development network, and MILNET as an operational military network.
An updated and much expanded version of the IPTW is needed to reflect these changes, and the 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook is a response to this need.
The cost is $110 domestic, and $130 foreign, including 4th class postage (check, money order, or purchase order accepted).
The 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook is divided into three volumes: 1.
The first volume includes Military Standard (MIL STD) protocols as well as administrative guidelines pertaining to the MILNET portion of the DDN. 2.
The second volume includes the DARPA Internet protocols as well as administrative guidelines pertaining to the ARPANET portion of the DDN.
Most of these protocols have also been issued as RFCs.
The third volume contains several background articles, implementation guidelines, and additional protocol specifications.
This volume is relevant to both portions of the network, and should be used in conjunction with the other two volumes.

How to get the Old Protocol Workbook 1982: The 1982 edition of the Protocol Handbook is a five volume set.
These documents were distributed in hardcopy by the NIC, but are now out of print.
Many of the protocols are also RFCs which are available online or in hardcopy from the NIC.
The complete documents may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), or the Defense Technical Information Service (DTIC).
The documents and their NTIS order numbers are: Internet Protocol Transition Workbook (IPTW)

The MIL STDs listed below are the official DoD versions of these commmunication protocols and should be consulted for any implementations.
These documents are available from the Naval Publications and Forms Center.
Requests can be initiated by telephone, telegraph, or mail; however, it is preferred that private industry use form DD1425, if possible.
These five documents are included in the 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook.

There may also be brokers in your area that will handle orders for MIL STDs.
One such vendor for MIL STD documents is Global Engineering.
Relationship between the RFC versions and the MIL STD versions: The ARPA community specifications for IP (RFC 791) and TCP (RFC 793) and the DoD specifications above are intended to describe exactly the same protocols.
Any difference in the protocols specified by these sets of documents should be reported to DCA and to DARPA.
The RFCs and the MIL STDs for IP and TCP differ in style and level of detail.
It is strongly advised that the two sets of documents be used together.
The ARPA and the DoD specifications for the FTP, SMTP, and Telnet protocols are essentially the same documents (RFCs 765, 821, 854).
Note that the current ARPA specification for FTP is RFC 959.
The MIL STD versions have been edited slightly.
Implementers should also check the "Official Protocols" memo for comments on protocol status or pending changes (RFC 961).
OTHER PROTOCOL DOCUMENTS ISO Protocol Documents: Approved ISO standards, and ISO draft standards at either the DP or DIS level, are available from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in New York.

All the ISO protocols are in the X.200 to X.430 area.
There may also be brokers in your area that will handle orders for ISO documents.
One such vendor of CCITT documents is OMNICOM.
