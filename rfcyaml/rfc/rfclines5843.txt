Abstract The IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Digest Algorithm Values" defines values for digest algorithms used by Instance Digests in HTTP.
Instance Digests in HTTP provide a digest, also known as a checksum or hash, of an entire representation of the current state of a resource.
This document adds new values to the registry and updates previous values.
The IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Digest Algorithm Values" defines values for digest algorithms used by Instance Digests in HTTP.
Note: This is unrelated to HTTP Digest Authentication.
Instance Digests in HTTP provide a digest, also known as a checksum or hash, of an entire representation of the current state of a resource.
The registry was created by [RFC3230] in 2002.
This document adds new values to the registry and updates previous values that had redundant or outdated references.
Example Example of Instance Digest for SHA 256:
Digest: SHA 256 MWVkMWQxYTRiMzk5MDQ0MzI3NGU5NDEyZTk5OWY1ZGFmNzgyZTJlO DYzYjRjYzFhOTlmNTQwYzI2M2QwM2U2MQ  2.
This document makes use of the IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Digest Algorithm Values" specified in [RFC3230].
Accordingly, IANA has updated the following registrations: Digest Algorithm:
The MD5 algorithm, as specified in [RFC1321].
The output of this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].
Reference: [RFC1321], [RFC4648], this document.
The SHA 1 algorithm [FIPS 180 3].
The output of this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].
Reference: [FIPS 180 3], [RFC4648], this document.
New Registrations Accordingly, IANA has made the following registrations
: Digest Algorithm: SHA 256 Description:
The SHA 256 algorithm [FIPS 180 3].
The output of this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].
Reference: [FIPS 180 3], [RFC4648], this document.
The SHA 512 algorithm [FIPS 180 3].
The output of this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].
Reference: [FIPS 180 3], [RFC4648], this document.
Security Considerations Same as [RFC3230].
The reference for base64 encoding has been updated for both MD5 and SHA.
The reference for SHA has been updated.
The SHA 256 and SHA 512 algorithms have been added to the registry.
All other previous values to the registry are still valid.
