  - "1.  Introduction\n   An advantage of flow-based measurement is that it allows\
    \ monitoring\n   large amounts of traffic observed at distributed Observation\
    \ Points.\n   While flow-based measurement can be applied to one of various\n\
    \   purposes and applications, it is difficult for flow-based measurement\n  \
    \ to apply to multiple applications with very different requirements in\n   parallel.\
    \  Network administrators need to adjust the parameters of\n   the metering devices\
    \ to fulfill the requirements of every single\n   measurement application.  Such\
    \ configurations are often not supported\n   by the metering devices, either because\
    \ of functional restrictions or\n   because of limited computational and memory\
    \ resources, which inhibit\n   the metering of large amounts of traffic with the\
    \ desired setup.  IP\n   Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Mediation fills the gap\
    \ between\n   restricted metering capabilities and the requirements of measurement\n\
    \   applications by introducing an intermediate device called the IPFIX\n   Mediator.\n\
    \   The IPFIX requirements defined in [RFC3917] mention examples of\n   intermediate\
    \ devices located between Exporters and Collectors, such\n   as IPFIX proxies\
    \ or concentrators.  But, there are no documents\n   defining a generalized concept\
    \ for such intermediate devices.  This\n   document addresses that issue by defining\
    \ IPFIX Mediation -- a\n   generalized intermediate device concept for IPFIX --\
    \ and examining in\n   detail the motivations behind its application.\n   This\
    \ document is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the\n   terminology used\
    \ in this document, Section 3 gives an IPFIX/Packet\n   Sampling (PSAMP) document\
    \ overview, Section 4 introduces general\n   problems related to flow-based measurement,\
    \ Section 5 describes some\n   applicability examples where IPFIX Mediation would\
    \ be beneficial,\n   and, finally, Section 6 describes some problems an IPFIX\
    \ Mediation\n   implementation might face.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology and Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology and Definitions\n   The IPFIX-specific and PSAMP-specific terminology\
    \ used in this\n   document is defined in [RFC5101] and [RFC5476], respectively.\
    \  In\n   this document, as in [RFC5101] and [RFC5476], the first letter of\n\
    \   each IPFIX-specific and PSAMP-specific term is capitalized along with\n  \
    \ the IPFIX Mediation-specific terms defined here.\n   In this document, we call\
    \ \"record stream\" a stream of records\n   carrying flow- or packet-based information.\
    \  The records may be\n   encoded as IPFIX Data Records or in any other format.\n\
    \   Original Exporter\n      An Original Exporter is an IPFIX Device that hosts\
    \ the Observation\n      Points where the metered IP packets are observed.\n \
    \  IPFIX Mediation\n      IPFIX Mediation is the manipulation and conversion of\
    \ a record\n      stream for subsequent export using the IPFIX protocol.\n   The\
    \ following terms are used in this document to describe the\n   architectural\
    \ entities used by IPFIX Mediation.\n   Intermediate Process\n      An Intermediate\
    \ Process takes a record stream as its input from\n      Collecting Processes,\
    \ Metering Processes, IPFIX File Readers,\n      other Intermediate Processes,\
    \ or other record sources; performs\n      some transformations on this stream,\
    \ based upon the content of\n      each record, states maintained across multiple\
    \ records, or other\n      data sources; and passes the transformed record stream\
    \ as its\n      output to Exporting Processes, IPFIX File Writers, or other\n\
    \      Intermediate Processes, in order to perform IPFIX Mediation.\n      Typically,\
    \ an Intermediate Process is hosted by an IPFIX Mediator.\n      Alternatively,\
    \ an Intermediate Process may be hosted by an\n      Original Exporter.\n   IPFIX\
    \ Mediator\n      An IPFIX Mediator is an IPFIX Device that provides IPFIX Mediation\n\
    \      by receiving a record stream from some data sources, hosting one\n    \
    \  or more Intermediate Processes to transform that stream, and\n      exporting\
    \ the transformed record stream into IPFIX Messages via an\n      Exporting Process.\
    \  In the common case, an IPFIX Mediator receives\n      a record stream from\
    \ a Collecting Process, but it could also\n      receive a record stream from\
    \ data sources not encoded using IPFIX,\n      e.g., in the case of conversion\
    \ from the NetFlow V9 protocol\n      [RFC3954] to the IPFIX protocol.\n     \
    \ Note that the IPFIX Mediator is a generalization of the\n      concentrator\
    \ and proxy elements envisioned in the IPFIX\n      requirements [RFC3917].  IPFIX\
    \ Mediators running appropriate\n      Intermediate Processes provide the functionality\
    \ specified\n      therein.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  IPFIX/PSAMP Documents Overview\n   IPFIX Mediation can be applied to Flow-\
    \ or packet-based information.\n   The Flow-based information is encoded as IPFIX\
    \ Flow Records by the\n   IPFIX protocol, and the packet-based information is\
    \ extracted by some\n   packet selection techniques and then encoded as PSAMP\
    \ Packet Reports\n   by the PSAMP protocol.  Thus, this section describes relevant\n\
    \   documents for both protocols.\n"
- title: 3.1.  IPFIX Documents Overview
  contents:
  - "3.1.  IPFIX Documents Overview\n   The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] provides network\
    \ administrators with\n   access to IP flow information.  The architecture for\
    \ the export of\n   measured IP flow information from an IPFIX Exporting Process\
    \ to a\n   Collecting Process is defined in [RFC5470], per the requirements\n\
    \   defined in [RFC3917].  The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] specifies how\n   IPFIX\
    \ Data Records and Templates are carried via a number of\n   transport protocols\
    \ from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX\n   Collecting Processes.  IPFIX has\
    \ a formal description of IPFIX\n   Information Elements, their names, types,\
    \ and additional semantic\n   information, as specified in [RFC5102].  [RFC5815]\
    \ specifies the\n   IPFIX Management Information Base.  Finally, [RFC5472] describes\
    \ what\n   types of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and how they can use\n\
    \   the information provided.  Furthermore, it shows how the IPFIX\n   framework\
    \ relates to other architectures and frameworks.  The storage\n   of IPFIX Messages\
    \ in a file is specified in [RFC5655].\n"
- title: 3.2.  PSAMP Documents Overview
  contents:
  - "3.2.  PSAMP Documents Overview\n   The framework for packet selection and reporting\
    \ [RFC5474] enables\n   network elements to select subsets of packets by statistical\
    \ and\n   other methods and to export a stream of reports on the selected\n  \
    \ packets to a Collector.  The set of packet selection techniques\n   (Sampling\
    \ and Filtering) standardized by PSAMP is described in\n   [RFC5475].  The PSAMP\
    \ protocol [RFC5476] specifies the export of\n   packet information from a PSAMP\
    \ Exporting Process to a Collector.\n   Like IPFIX, PSAMP has a formal description\
    \ of its Information\n   Elements, their names, types, and additional semantic\
    \ information.\n   The PSAMP information model is defined in [RFC5477].  [PSAMP-MIB]\n\
    \   describes the PSAMP Management Information Base.\n"
- title: 4.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "4.  Problem Statement\n   Network administrators generally face the problems\
    \ of measurement\n   system scalability, Flow-based measurement flexibility, and\
    \ export\n   reliability, even if some techniques, such as Packet Sampling,\n\
    \   Filtering, Data Records aggregation, and export replication, have\n   already\
    \ been developed.  The problems consist of adjusting some\n   parameters of metering\
    \ devices to resources of the measurement system\n   while fulfilling appropriate\
    \ conditions: data accuracy, Flow\n   granularity, and export reliability.  These\
    \ conditions depend on two\n   factors.\n   o  Measurement system capacity: This\
    \ consists of the bandwidth of the\n      management network, the storage capacity,\
    \ and the performances of\n      the collecting devices and exporting devices.\n\
    \   o  Application requirements: Different applications, such as traffic\n   \
    \   engineering, detecting traffic anomalies, and accounting, impose\n      different\
    \ Flow Record granularities, and data accuracies.\n   The sustained growth of\
    \ IP traffic has been overwhelming the\n   capacities of measurement systems.\
    \  Furthermore, a large variety of\n   applications (e.g., Quality-of-Service\
    \ (QoS) measurement, traffic\n   engineering, security monitoring) and the deployment\
    \ of measurement\n   systems in heterogeneous environments have been increasing\
    \ the demand\n   and complexity of IP traffic measurements.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Coping with IP Traffic Growth
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Coping with IP Traffic Growth\n   Enterprise or service provider networks\
    \ already have multiple 10 Gb/s\n   links, their total traffic exceeding 100 Gb/s.\
    \  In the near future,\n   broadband users' traffic will increase by approximately\
    \ 40% every\n   year according to [TRAFGRW].  When administrators monitor IP traffic\n\
    \   sustaining its growth at multiple Exporters, the amount of exported\n   Flow\
    \ Records from Exporters could exceed the ability of a single\n   Collector.\n\
    \   To deal with this problem, current data reduction techniques (Packet\n   Sampling\
    \ and Filtering in [RFC5475], and aggregation of measurement\n   data) have been\
    \ generally implemented on Exporters.  Note that Packet\n   Sampling leads to\
    \ potential loss of small Flows.  With both Packet\n   Sampling and aggregation\
    \ techniques, administrators might no longer\n   be able to detect and investigate\
    \ subtle traffic changes and\n   anomalies, as this requires detailed Flow information.\
    \  With\n   Filtering, only a subset of the Data Records are exported.\n   Considering\
    \ the potential drawbacks of Packet Sampling, Filtering,\n   and Data Records\
    \ aggregation, there is a need for a large-scale\n   collecting infrastructure\
    \ that does not rely on data reduction\n   techniques.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Coping with Multipurpose Traffic Measurement
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Coping with Multipurpose Traffic Measurement\n   Different monitoring applications\
    \ impose different requirements on\n   the monitoring infrastructure.  Some of\
    \ them require traffic\n   monitoring at a Flow level while others need information\
    \ about\n   individual packets or just Flow aggregates.\n   To fulfill these diverse\
    \ requirements, an Exporter would need to\n   perform various complex metering\
    \ tasks in parallel, which is a\n   problem due to limited resources.  Hence,\
    \ it can be advantageous to\n   run the Exporter with a much simpler setup and\
    \ to perform appropriate\n   post-processing of the exported Data Records at a\
    \ later stage.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Coping with Heterogeneous Environments
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Coping with Heterogeneous Environments\n   Network administrators use IPFIX\
    \ Devices and PSAMP Devices from\n   various vendors, various software versions,\
    \ and various device types\n   (router, switch, or probe) in a single network\
    \ domain.  Even legacy\n   flow export protocols are still deployed in current\
    \ networks.  This\n   heterogeneous environment leads to differences in Metering\
    \ Process\n   capabilities, Exporting Process capacity (export rate, cache memory,\n\
    \   etc.), and data format.  For example, probes and switches cannot\n   retrieve\
    \ some derived packet properties from a routing table.\n   To deal with this problem,\
    \ the measurement system needs to mediate\n   the differences.  However, equipping\
    \ all collecting devices with this\n   absorption function is difficult.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Summary
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Summary\n   Due to resource limitations of the measurement system, it is\n\
    \   important to use traffic data reduction techniques as early as\n   possible,\
    \ e.g., at the Exporter.  However, this implementation is\n   made difficult by\
    \ the heterogeneous environment of exporting devices.\n   On the other hand, keeping\
    \ data accuracy and Flow granularity to meet\n   the requirements of different\
    \ monitoring applications requires a\n   scalable and flexible collecting infrastructure.\n\
    \   This implies that a new Mediation function is required in typical\n   Exporter-Collector\
    \ architectures.  Based on some applicability\n   examples, the next section shows\
    \ the limitation of the typical\n   Exporter-Collector architecture model and\
    \ the IPFIX Mediation\n   benefits.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Adjusting Flow Granularity
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Adjusting Flow Granularity\n   The simplest set of Flow Keys is a fixed\
    \ 5-tuple of protocol, source\n   and destination IP addresses, and source and\
    \ destination port\n   numbers.  A shorter set of Flow Keys, such as a triple,\
    \ a double, or\n   a single property, (for example, network prefix, peering autonomous\n\
    \   system number, or BGP Next-Hop fields), creates more aggregated Flow\n   Records.\
    \  This is especially useful for measuring router-level\n   traffic matrices in\
    \ a core network domain and for easily adjusting\n   the performance of Exporters\
    \ and Collectors.\n   Implementation analysis:\n      Implementations for this\
    \ case depend on where Flow granularity is\n      adjusted.  More suitable implementations\
    \ use configurable Metering\n      Processes in Original Exporters.  The cache\
    \ in the Metering\n      Process can specify its own set of Flow Keys and extra\
    \ fields.\n      The Original Exporter thus generates Flow Records of the desired\n\
    \      Flow granularity.\n      In the case where a Metering Process hosting no\
    \ ability to change\n      the Flow Keys in Original Exporters creates Flow Records,\
    \ or PSAMP\n      Packet Reports, an IPFIX Mediator can aggregate Data Records\
    \ based\n      on a new set of Flow Keys.  Even in the case of a Metering Process\n\
    \      hosting this ability, an IPFIX Mediator can further aggregate the\n   \
    \   Flow Records.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Collecting Infrastructure

  - "5.2.  Collecting Infrastructure\n   Increasing numbers of IPFIX Exporters, IP\

    \   applications within a single Collector.\n   Implementation analysis:\n   \
    \   To increase the collecting (e.g., the bandwidth capacity) and\n      processing\
    \ capacity, distributed Collectors close to Exporters\n      need to be deployed.\
    \  In such a case, those Collectors would\n      become IPFIX Mediators, re-exporting\
    \ Data Records on demand to\n      centralized applications.  To cope with the\

  - "5.6.  Data Record Anonymization\n   IPFIX exports across administrative domains\
    \ can be used to measure\n   traffic for wide-area traffic engineering or to analyze\
    \ Internet\n   traffic trends, as described in the spatial composition across\n\
    \   administrative domains in the previous subsection.  In such a case,\n   administrators\
    \ need to adhere to privacy protection policies and\n   prevent access to confidential\
    \ traffic measurements by other people.\n   Typically, anonymization techniques\
    \ enable the provision of traffic\n   data to other people without violating these\
    \ policies.\n   Generally, anonymization modifies a data set to protect the identity\n\
    \   of the people or entities described by the data set from being\n   disclosed.\
    \  It also attempts to preserve sets of network traffic\n   properties useful\
    \ for a given analysis while ensuring the data cannot\n   be traced back to the\
    \ specific networks, hosts, or users generating\n   the traffic.  For example,\
    \ IP address anonymization is particularly\n   important for avoiding the identification\
    \ of users, hosts, and\n   routers.  As another example, when an ISP provides\
    \ traffic monitoring\n   service to end customers, network administrators take\
    \ care of\n   anonymizing interface index fields that could disclose any\n   information\
    \ about the vendor or software version of the Exporters.\n   Implementation analysis:\n\
    \      One possible implementation for this case uses an anonymization\n     \
    \ function at the Original Exporter.  However, this increases the\n      load\

- title: 5.7.  Data Retention
  contents:
  - "5.7.  Data Retention\n   Data retention refers to the storage of traffic data\
    \ by service\n   providers and commercial organizations.  Legislative regulations\n\
    \   often require that network operators retain both IP traffic data and\n   call\
    \ detail records, in wired and wireless networks, generated by end\n   users while\
    \ using a service provider's services.  The traffic data is\n   required for the\
    \ purpose of the investigation, detection, and\n   prosecution of serious crime,\
    \ if necessary.  Data retention examples\n   relevant to IP networks are the following:\n\
    \   o  Internet telephony (includes every multimedia session associated\n    \
    \  with IP multimedia services)\n   o  Internet email\n   o  Internet access\n\
    \   Data retention, for these services in particular, requires a\n   measurement\
    \ system with reliable export and huge storage, as the data\n   must be available\
    \ for a long period of time, typically at least six\n   months.\n   Implementation\
    \ analysis:\n      Regarding export reliability requirement, the most suitable\n\
    \      implementation uses the Stream Control Transmission Protocol\n      (SCTP)\
    \ between the Original Exporter and Collector.  If an\n      unreliable transport\
    \ protocol such as UDP is used, a legacy\n      exporting device exports Data\
    \ Records to a nearby IPFIX Mediator\n      through UDP, and then an IPFIX Mediator\
    \ could reliably export them\n      to the IPFIX Collector through SCTP.  If an\
    \ unreliable transport\n      protocol such as UDP is used and if there is no\
    \ IPFIX Mediator,\n      the legacy exporting device should duplicate the exports\
    \ to\n      several Collectors to lower the probability of losing Flow\n     \
    \ Records.  However, it might result in network congestion, unless\n      dedicated\
    \ export links are used.\n      Regarding huge storage requirements, the collecting\
    \ infrastructure\n      is described in Section 5.2.\n"

    \ Data Records from branch\n   offices are gathered in a central office.  However,\
    \ in the long-\n   distance branch office case, the bandwidth for transporting\

- title: 5.9.  Distributing Data Record Types
  contents:
  - "5.9.  Distributing Data Record Types\n   Recently, several networks have shifted\
    \ towards integrated networks,\n   such as the pure IP and MPLS networks, which\
    \ include IPv4, IPv6, and\n   VPN traffic.  Data Record types (IPv4, IPv6, MPLS,\
    \ and VPN) need to\n   be analyzed separately and from different perspectives\
    \ for different\n   organizations.  A single Collector handling all Data Record\
    \ types\n   might become a bottleneck in the collecting infrastructure.  Data\n\
    \   Records distributed based on their respective types can be exported\n   to\
    \ the appropriate Collector, resulting in load distribution amongst\n   multiple\
    \ Collectors.\n   Implementation analysis:\n      One possible implementation\
    \ for this case uses replication of the\n      IPFIX Message in an Original Exporter\
    \ for multiple IPFIX\n      Collectors.  Each Collector then extracts the Data\
    \ Record required\n      by its own applications.  However, this replication increases\
    \ the\n      load of the Exporting Process and the waste of bandwidth between\n\
    \      the Exporter and Collector.\n      A more sophisticated implementation\
    \ uses an Intermediate Process\n      located between the Metering Processes and\
    \ Exporting Processes in\n      an Original Exporter.  The Intermediate Process\
    \ determines to\n      which Collector a Data Record is exported, depending on\
    \ certain\n      field values.  If an Original Exporter does not have this\n \
    \     capability, it exports Data Records to a nearby separate IPFIX\n      Mediator,\
    \ and then the IPFIX Mediator could distribute them to the\n      appropriate\
    \ IPFIX Collectors.\n      For example, in the case of distributing a specific\
    \ customer's\n      Data Records, an IPFIX Mediator needs to identify the customer\n\
    \      networks.  The Route Distinguisher (RD), ingress interface,\n      peering\
    \ Autonomous System (AS) number, or BGP Next-Hop, or simply\n      the network\
    \ prefix may be evaluated to distinguish different\n      customer networks. \
    \ In the following figure, the IPFIX Mediator\n      reroutes Data Records on\

    \ or spatial composition,\n   caution should be taken regarding how to aggregate\
    \ non-key fields in\n   IPFIX Mediation.  The IPFIX information model [RFC5102]\
    \ specifies\n   that the value of non-key fields, which are derived from fields\
    \ of\n   packets or from packet treatment and for which the value may change\n\
    \   from packet to packet within a single Flow, is determined by the\n   first\
    \ packet observed for the corresponding Flow, unless the\n   description of the\
    \ Information Element explicitly specifies a\n   different semantics.\n   However,\
    \ this simple rule might not be appropriate when aggregating\n   Flow Records\
    \ that have different values in a non-key field.  For\n   example, if Differentiated\
    \ Services Code Point (DSCP) information is\n   to be exported, the following\
    \ problem can be observed: if two Flows\n   with identical Flow Key values are\
    \ measured at different Observation\n   Points, they may contain identical packets\
    \ observed at different\n   locations in the network and at different points in\
    \ time.  On their\n   way from the first to the second Observation Point, the\
    \ DSCP and\n   potentially some other packet fields may have changed.  Hence,\
    \ if the\n   Information Element ipDiffServCodePoint is included as a non-key\n\
    \   field, it can be useful to include the DSCP value observed at either\n   the\
    \ first or the second Observation Point in the resulting Flow\n   Record, depending\
    \ on the application.\n   Other potential solutions include removing the Information\
    \ Element\n   ipDiffServCodePoint from the Data Record when re-exporting the\n\
    \   aggregate Flow Record, changing the Information Element\n   ipDiffServCodePoint\
    \ from a non-key field to a Flow Key when\n   re-exporting the aggregated Flow\
    \ Record, or assigning a non-valid\n   value for the Information Element to express\
    \ to the Collector that\n   this Information Element is meaningless.\n   If Packet\
    \ Sampling or Filtering is applied, the IPFIX Mediator must\n   report an adjusted\
    \ PSAMP Configured Selection Fraction when\n   aggregating IPFIX Flow Records\
    \ with different Sampling rates.\n   Finally, special care must be taken when\
    \ aggregating Flow Records\n   resulting from different Sampling techniques such\

  - "7.  Summary and Conclusion\n   This document describes the problems that network\
    \ administrators have\n   been facing, the applicability of IPFIX Mediation to\
    \ these problems,\n   and the problems related to the implementation of IPFIX\
    \ Mediators.\n   To assist the operations of the Exporters and Collectors, this\n\
    \   document demonstrates that there exist various IPFIX Mediation\n   functions\
    \ from which the administrators may select.\n   However, there are still some\
    \ open issues with the use of IPFIX\n   Mediators.  These issues stem from the\
    \ fact that no standards\n   regarding IPFIX Mediation have been set.  In particular,\
    \ the minimum\n   information that should be communicated between Original Exporters\n\
    \   and Collectors, the mapping between different IPFIX Transport\n   Sessions,\
    \ and the internal components of IPFIX Mediators should be\n   standardized.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   A flow-based measurement system must prevent\
    \ potential security\n   threats: the disclosure of confidential traffic data,\
    \ injection of\n   incorrect data, and unauthorized access to traffic data.  These\n\
    \   security threats of the IPFIX protocol are covered by the Security\n   Considerations\
    \ section in [RFC5101] and are still valid for IPFIX\n   Mediators.\n   A measurement\
    \ system must also prevent the following security threats\n   related to IPFIX\
    \ Mediation:\n   o  Attacks against an IPFIX Mediator\n      IPFIX Mediators can\
    \ be considered as a prime target for attacks,\n      as an alternative to IPFIX\
    \ Exporters and Collectors.  IPFIX\n      Proxies or Masquerading Proxies need\
    \ to prevent unauthorized\n      access or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks from\
    \ untrusted public\n      networks.\n   o  Man-in-the-middle attack by untrusted\
    \ IPFIX Mediator\n      The Exporter-Mediator-Collector structure model could\
    \ be misused\n      for a man-in-the-middle attack.\n   o  Configuration on IPFIX\
    \ Mediation\n      An accidental misconfiguration and unauthorized access to\n\
    \      configuration data could lead to the crucial problem of disclosure\n  \
    \    of confidential traffic data.\n   o  Unintentional exposure of end-user information\n\
    \      The probability of collecting fine-grained information on one\n      arbitrary\
    \ end user increases with the number of Observation\n      Points.  An IPFIX Mediator\
    \ facing such a situation may have to\n      apply appropriate functions (e.g.,\
    \ anonymization or aggregation)\n      to the Data Records it produces.\n   o\
    \  Multiple-tenancy policy on an IPFIX Mediator\n      An IPFIX Mediator handling\
    \ traffic data from multiple tenants or\n      customers needs to protect those\
    \ tenants or customers from one\n      another's traffic data.  For example, an\
    \ IPFIX Mediator needs to\n      identify the customer's identifier, e.g., ingress\
    \ interface index,\n      network address range, VLAN ID, Media Access Control\
    \ (MAC)\n      address, etc., when feeding the customer's traffic data to a\n\
    \      customer's own dedicated IPFIX Collector.  If the IPFIX Mediator\n    \
    \  cannot identify each customer's traffic data, it may need to drop\n      the\
    \ Data Records.  In addition, another technique to keep track of\n      a customer's\
    \ identifier may be required when customer sites are\n      movable, e.g., in\
    \ the case of a virtual machine moving to another\n      physical machine.\n \
    \  o  Confidentiality protection via an IPFIX Mediator\n      To ensure security\
    \ of Data Records in transit, transport of Data\n      Records should be confidential\
    \ and integrity-protected, e.g., by\n      using Transport Layer Security (TLS)\
    \ [RFC5246] or Datagram\n      Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC4347].  However,\
    \ an IPFIX\n      Collector cannot know whether received Data Records are\n  \
    \    transported as encrypted data between an Original Exporter and an\n     \
    \ IPFIX Mediator.  If this information is required on the IPFIX\n      Collector,\
    \ it must be encoded in the IPFIX Mediator.\n   o  Certification for an Original\
    \ Exporter\n      An IPFIX Collector communicating via an IPFIX Mediator cannot\n\
    \      verify the identity of an Original Exporter directly.  If an\n      Original\
    \ Exporter and an IPFIX Collector are located in different\n      administrative\
    \ domains, an IPFIX Collector cannot trust its Data\n      Records.  If this information\
    \ is required on the IPFIX Collector,\n      it must be encoded in the IPFIX Mediator.\n"
