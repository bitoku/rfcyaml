  contents:
  - "1.1.  IETF Trust\n   Currently the IETF requires that authors of Contributions\
    \ to the IETF\n   grant to the IETF (meaning the full set of participants in the\
    \ IETF\n   Standards Process) a limited set of non-exclusive rights and\n   permissions\
    \ as part of the process of submitting such Contribution.\n   These rights and\
    \ permissions are detailed in \"IETF Rights in\n   Contributions\" (RFC 3978 -\
    \ BCP 78) [RFC3978].\n   The IETF Trust was recently formed to act as the administrative\n\
    \   custodian of all copyrights and other intellectual property rights\n   relating\
    \ to the IETF Standards Process that had previously been held\n   by ISOC and\
    \ the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI)\n   (see [IETF_Trust_Agmt]).\n\
    \   The IETF is supported by an IETF Administrative Support Activity\n   (IASA)\
    \ defined in BCP 101 [BCP101].  BCP 101 was updated by [RFC4371]\n   to recognize\
    \ the creation of the IETF Trust.\n   This document updates RFC 3978 in order\
    \ to recognize the IETF Trust\n   and to implement the structure needed to support\
    \ it.  Most\n   importantly, it alters the license-grant path as follows:  whereas\n\
    \   previously, authors of Contributions to the IETF would grant a\n   license\
    \ to ISOC, such authors will grant a license to the IETF Trust\n   (in Section\
    \ 3.3).  This document concerns itself only with changes to\n   RFC 3978 needed\
    \ to recognize the creation of the IETF Trust.\n   This introductory section is\
    \ to provide context for the reader.\n   Section 2 of this document is intended\
    \ to be normative.\n"
