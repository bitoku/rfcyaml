    \ on the ARPANET\nDate:  Monday May 21, 1973\nTime:  9:00 AM to 5:00 PM\nPlace:\
    \ Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., Cambridge, Mass.\nHosts: TENEX and TIP Groups\
    \ at BBN\nTheme:\n-----\nThis workshop will focus on various aspects of the question:\n\
    \    What steps can be taken to automate access to the distributed\n    resources\
    \ on the ARPANET?\nIn particular, how can we move from where we are today toward\
    \ an\nenvironment which facilitates resource sharing by moving the burden of\n\
    dealing with the network from the human user to processes which act on\nhis behalf?\
    \  Additionally, operating systems themselves perform various\noperations not\
    \ directly initiated by human users which could better be\nperformed with the\
    \ availability of resources on other systems (e.g.\nfile system backup); how can\
    \ we move toward an environment which\nfacilitates such system-system cooperation?\n\
    Objectives of Workshop:\n----------------------\n1.  To identify and clarify the\
    \ issues raised by automated resource\n    sharing.\n    What are the obstacles\
    \ preventing more widespread resource sharing\n    on the ARPANET?  Are they technical,\
    \ political, administrative in\n    nature?  Is it that there are few resources\
    \ worth sharing (we don't\n    think so)?  Is automated sharing a bad idea (We\
    \ don't think so)?\n2.  To identify resources at various network sites appropriate\
    \ for\n    automated sharing; and to identify the need for resources which\n \
    \   don't but should exist.\n3.  To formulate a series of experiments for the\
    \ purpose of evaluating\n    relative merits and disadvantages of different approaches\
    \ to\n    automating resource sharing.\n    The intent of such experimentation\
    \ is to gain experience through\n    construction and use of prototype systems\
    \ which support automated\n    sharing.\nFormat of Workshop:\n------------------\n\
    Morning:\nIn order to get the workshop \"up to speed\", each participant will\
    \ be\nexpected to give a brief presentation of relevant work he (his site) is\n\
    currently engaged in, is planning to do, or to identify and discuss\nissues he\
    \ feels are relevant to the subject.  Time will be allowed for\nbrief discussion\
    \ after each presentation.\nAfternoon:\nGeneral discussion of the issues raised\
    \ during the morning session.\nPossible subjects for discussion include (but need\
    \ not be limited to):\n1.  Identification of possible multi-site \"services\"\
    .\n    Intersite mail, terminal linking, status information are some\n    examples\
    \ - what are others?\n2.  Identification of resources appropriate for remote utilization.\n\
    \    File systems, compilers, on-line query systems, manuscript\n    preparation\
    \ systems are some examples - what are others?\n3.  Access to remote resources.\n\
    \    Possibility of access paths other than the standard logger port.  To\n  \
    \  what extent (if at all) can the access paths to a variety of\n    different\
    \ resources be standardized?  How can resources which may\n    move from Host\
    \ to Host or may be available on several Hosts be\n    dynamically located and\
    \ selected for use?  The need for\n    (desirability of) a \"broadcast ICP\".\n\
    4.  Problems of accounting for resource utilization.\n    Some form of network\
    \ wide accounting would be a great convenience.\n    For example, it would be\
    \ nice if a user could use the same account\n    at many (all?) sites.  What are\
    \ the problems (if any) preventing\n    this?\n5.  Problems of security and access\
    \ control.\n    Authentication of users/processes attempting to use resources.\
    \  As\n    with network wide accounts, the ability to use the same name and\n\
    \    password at all sites would be convenient.  How can a user's\n    password\
    \ and other sensitive data be protected in such an\n    environment?\n    The\
    \ notion of a third party password validation and user\n    authentication service.\n\
    6.  Approaches to automating resource sharing.\n    It is possible without difficulty\
    \ to identify several which on the\n    surface appear to be different:\n    a.\
    \  Multi-site executive programs which make resources accessible to\n        the\
    \ user at the command language level; e.g.  the inter-site,\n        user-user\
    \ interaction and file maintenance activity supported by\n        the RSEXEC.\n\
    \    b.  A programming language environment designed to facilitate\n        resource\
    \ sharing; e.g. LISP is a machine independent language -\n        one could imagine\
    \ a multi-computer LISP system which supported\n        automated resource sharing.\n\
    \    c.  The \"collect a resource\" approach - identify an Editor here,\n    \
    \    file storage service there, a compiler somewhere else, etc; and\n       \
    \ build a \"workshop\" environment which provides convenient access\n        to\
    \ these resources.\n    What are the relative merits and disadvantages of these\
    \ approaches?\n    What aspects do these approaches have in common?  Is it possible\
    \ to\n    identify a common base capable of supporting them all?\n7.  Protocols\
    \ to support automated resource sharing.\n    It would be inappropriate to attempt\
    \ to generate a detailed protocol\n    specification at this workshop. However,\
    \ it is appropriate to\n    discuss the kinds of activity a protocol should support.\
    \ Existing\n    protocols (excepting Host-Host protocol and possibly, the new\
    \ TELNET\n    protocol) appear to be oriented toward human users. Automated\n\
    \    resource sharing suggests processes acting on behalf of human users\n   \
    \ to interface to remote resources; this in turn suggests that the\n    protocols\
    \ should be highly process oriented. For example, because\n    there should be\
    \ minimal human intervention in error recovery, the\n    protocols should be extremely\
    \ robust; e.g., include well specified\n    time outs, etc.\nArrangements:\n------------\n\
    If you are planning to attend the workshop, please notify Bob Thomas at\nBBN (send\
    \ net mail to BTHOMAS@BBN, telephone (617) 491-1850, x483).  If\nyou would like\
    \ us to make motel reservations for you (at the homestead\nInn at Fresh Pond)\
    \ call Mrs Terry Bernier at BBN (x545).\nIt is possible that a single day will\
    \ prove to be insufficient for this\nworkshop.  If that is the consensus of the\
    \ attendees, the workshop will\ncontinue through Tuesday May 22.\nPosition papers,\
    \ memos, notes, etc. prepared by participants in advance\nof the workshop will\
    \ help contribute to the success of the workshop and\nare requested.  All such\
    \ papers received before May 11 will be\ndistributed, in advance, to workshop\
    \ attendees.\nThe following questions may be helpful in focusing your thinking:\n\
    - What resources would your site be willing to make available for use in\n  automated\
    \ resource sharing experiments?\n- Under what conditions would your site be willing\
    \ or able to\n  participate in such experiments?\n- What administrative and/or\
    \ technical considerations would prevent your\n  site from entering into a network\
    \ wide resource sharing agreement?\n- If you employ accounting Procedures that\
    \ require cost recovery, how,\n  if at all, should they be modified to work in\
    \ a network resource\n  sharing environment?\nReading List:\n------------\nWe\
    \ are aware of little that has been written on the subject of automated\nresource\
    \ sharing.  However, the following items are relevant (at least\nmarginally) to\
    \ the workshop.  Please inform us of others of which you\nare aware.\n1.  ARPANET\
