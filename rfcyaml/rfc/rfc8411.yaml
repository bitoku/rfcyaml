    \ the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and signature\n   algorithms.  This\

    \ the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.  This\n   document describes the donated range\
    \ and the identifiers that were\n   assigned from that range, transfers control\
    \ of that range to IANA,\n   and establishes IANA allocation policies for any\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a\
    \ range of\n   object identifiers was donated to the working group by DigiCert,\
    \ Inc.\n   The use of these object identifiers allowed for the Edwards Elliptic\n\
    \   Curve key agreement [RFC7748] and signature [RFC8032] algorithms to\n   be\
    \ defined with encodings that are smaller than similar ones would be\n   if assigned\
    \ from the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.  The initial\n   registrations from this\
    \ arc were made while developing [RFC8410].\n   After those registrations were\
    \ made, there were still some unused\n   values that could be used by other security\
    \ groups.\n   Object identifiers are primarily used with Abstract Syntax Notation\n\
    \   (ASN.1) [ASN.1].  The ASN.1 specifications continue to evolve, but\n   object\
    \ identifiers can be used with any and all versions of ASN.1.\n   This document\
    \ describes the object identifiers that were assigned in\n   that donated range,\
    \ transfers control of the range to IANA, and\n   establishes IANA allocation\
    \ policies for any future assignments.\n   The donated range from DigiCert, Inc.\
    \ is as follows:\n   first: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101)\
    \ 100 }\n   last: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 127 }\n"

    \ 'Decimal' is required to be a number between 100 and 127\n   inclusive.\n  \
    \ The value of 100 has been reserved so that a new arc below that point\n   can\
    \ be established in the future (i.e., starting at 1.3.101.100.1).\n   If the new\
    \ child registry is established, a name for this value is to\n   be assigned at\

    \ instead.\n"
