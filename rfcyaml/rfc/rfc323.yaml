  - "              Formation of Network Measurement Group (NMG)\n   On March 17, 1972,\
    \ at MIT project MAC, the following group met to\n   discuss plans to perform\
    \ measurement experiments on the ARPANET:\n                    A. Bhushan    \
    \ - MIT/DMCG\n                    V. Cerf        - UCLA/NMC, Chairman, NMG\n \
    \                   S. Crocker     - ARPA/IPT\n                    J. Forgie \

    \ - UCLA/NMC\n                    J. Winett      - LL/67\n   The purpose of the\
    \ meeting was to discuss existing and planned\n   measurements of network and\
    \ HOST behavior.\n"
- title: '1.  Measurement Link #''s'
  contents:
  - "1.  Measurement Link #'s\n   It was agreed (after a ridiculously long discussion)\
    \ to allocate\n   links 159-191 for network measurement only (see RFC #317). \
    \ It was\n   further agreed that these links would be allocated in the following\n\
    \   way:\n         159-174  HOST DISCARD; co-operating HOSTS receiving messages\
    \ on\n                  these links will throw them away without generating an\n\
    \                  error message.\n         175-190  To be allocated as needed\
    \ by V. Cerf - UCLA/NMC.\n         191      To be used by IMPs to send measurement\
    \ traffic\n                  obtained from IMP statistics packages.\n   It should\
    \ be apparent that HOSTs wishing to co-operate in the support\n   of a HOST discard\
    \ service should modify their NCP's to throw away all\n   messages received on\
    \ links 159-174 without sending an error back to\n   the source HOST (no connection\
    \ will be open on these links).\n"
- title: 2.  Process Discard
  contents:
  - "2.  Process Discard\n   Although it was not mentioned at the meeting, C. Kline\
    \ at UCLA has\n   suggested a PROCESS DISCARD also with some well known socket\
    \ number.\n   The purpose of this discard routine would be to help us study\n\
    \   Process-Process behavior of the network.\n   It would be convenient if all\
    \ co-operating HOSTs could write a\n   Process Discard program which would simply\
    \ wait for ICP on some\n   standard socket number.  Until a complete survey is\
    \ made of well-\n   known socket numbers at each HOST, no socket number will be\
    \ proposed\n   (see RFC #322).\n"
- title: 3.  NCP Statistics
  contents:
  - "3.  NCP Statistics\n   At the meeting it was apparent that several sites have\
    \ already\n   instrumented their NCP's out of curiosity.  In particular, Joel\n\
    \   Winett, Lincoln Labs (360/67), has instrumented all connections\n   originated\
    \ by local TELNET users.  He gathers statistics per\n   connection such as:\n\
    \         a) Network connect time\n         b) NCP CPU time\n         c) Number\
    \ of reads or writes on connection\n         d) Time stamps on:\n            \
    \   first RFC, last RFC, first close, last close.\n         e) Number of messages\
    \ and bits transmitted\n         f) Log of errors sent or received\n   MULTICS\
    \ gathers summary statistics on the number of regular (type 0)\n   messages sent\
    \ and received, and the number of irregular messages (not\n   type 0) sent or\
    \ received.\n   The NWG agreed to implement a minimal NCP instrumentation procedure\n\
    \   which would gather by HOST for some standard 24 hour period (e.g.\n   local\
    \ midnight to local midnight) the following:\n         a. Total bits sent to HOST\n\
    \         b. Total bits received from HOST\n         c. Total messages sent to\
    \ HOST\n         d. Total messages received from HOST and optionally\n       \
    \  e. Average Round Trip delay on send connections to HOST\n   The information\
    \ above should be collected only for standard open\n   connections (i.e. those\
    \ using standard NCP protocol) and not\n   Measurement links or experimental NCP\
    \ links, and in particular, not\n   traffic on link 0).\n   Another optional measurement\
    \ would be to gather the distribution of\n   message types over link 0 over all\
    \ HOSTS (i.e. not broken down by\n   HOST).  This will reveal the relative utilization\
    \ of control messages\n   (ALLOC should be very prevalent).\n   The data collected\
    \ for the last 24 hour sample period should be\n   available from a process whose\
    \ well-known (to be specified) socket\n   number will support ICP and will produce\
    \ a message in the following\n   format:\n                   16         16\n \

  - "4.  Process level measurements\n   R Metcalfe MIT/DMCG suggested that the NWG\
    \ consider trying to gather\n   the following data about network connections:\n\
    \         1. Capacity in bits/sec\n         2. Transmission delay\n         3.\
    \ Mean Time Between Failures\n         4. Percent availability\n   These statistics\
    \ characterize connections as communication\n   commodities and would be the kind\
    \ of information one would want if\n   Network connections were for sale as \"\
    off-the-shelf\" items.  The\n   first two measures are fairly easy to obtain (although\
    \ they may vary\n   from connection to connection).  The last two are harder to\
    \ get at\n   and will require some planning to measure.\n"
- title: 5 HOST surveys
  contents:
  - "5 HOST surveys\n   Several HOSTS have built or are building automatic survey\
    \ programs\n   which periodically test and record the status of various HOSTs.\
    \  BB&N\n   (Ellen Westheimer) has been doing this manually on a daily basis.\n\
    \   MIT/DMCG has a program developed by R. Metcalfe and M. Seriff which\n   gathers\
    \ these statistics every 15 minutes and stores the data away in\n   messaged form.\
    \  The data can be retrieved through the NETWORK program\n   at DMCG.  A summary\
    \ can be obtained, by HOST, declaring the % time VP\n   overall samples and the\
    \ message response to perform ICP in seconds.\n   This program also keeps the\
    \ state of the HOSTs according to the\n   following measures:\n   code  meaning\n\
    \   ----  -------\n   0     HOST not surveyed\n   1     HOST Dead (according to\
    \ IMP)\n   2     NCP not responding to RESET request (15 second time-out)\n  \
    \ 3     NCP rejecting (ICP got close response).\n   4     Logger not responding\
    \ (20 second time-out after ICP request).\n   5     Logger available (i.e. ICP\
    \ successful followed by Close request\n         by DMCG).\n   Details and sample\
    \ data are available in an RFC produced by M. Seriff\n   (RFC #308, NIC #9259).\
    \  At UCLA, M. Kampe is implementing a similar\n   program.\n   J. Postel and\
    \ V. Cerf plotted Ellen Westheimer's data for HOSTS OPEN\n   (regarding HOST advertising\
    \ of service of hours) and found the\n   resulting plot rather interesting.  The\
    \ result is reproduced in the\n   figure below.  On a moving average, the number\
    \ of HOSTS OPEN seems to\n   be increasing, which is a good sign.\n   [Here was\
    \ a figure]\n"

    \ delay and total\n   throughput as a function of file size for transmissions\
    \ to and from\n   UCSB's Simple Minded File System.  The NWG is interested in\n\
    \   specifying certain measurements which should become a standard part\n   of\
    \ any File transmission protocol implementation.  In particular,\n   distributions\
    \ of file sizes, transmission delay and perhaps\n   destination would be of interest.\

- title: 6.  Artificial traffic generator
  contents:
  - "6.  Artificial traffic generator\n   UCLA and Lincoln Labs have experimented\
    \ with artificial traffic\n   generators as a means of testing network capacity.\
    \  At Lincoln Labs,\n   J. Forgie used the 360/67 to generate traffic from a normal\
    \ user\n   process.  Depending on system load, he was able to maintain traffic\n\
    \   rates ranging from 4800 bps to 38K bps.  UCLA has had a generator for\n  \
    \ about a year and has managed to obtain transmission rates around 75K\n   bps\
    \ using multiple links for parallel transmission.\n   The NWG is interested in\
    \ having such artificial traffic generators\n   available at several HOSTs as\
    \ a means of artificially loading the\n   network.  Ideally, generators could\
    \ be started by a TELNET-like\n   protocol and would permit specification of\n\
    \         a) Link #'s to send on\n         b) Destination: HOST's or IMP's discard\n\
    \         c) Inter-arrival time distribution for messages sent on each\n     \
    \       link (i.e. possibly different distribution for each link).\n         \
    \   Or at least average IAT for assumed exponential\n            distribution.\
    \  An average IAT of 0 would imply RFNM driven\n            traffic\n        \
    \ d) Message length distribution, or average, or fixed length for\n          \
    \  each link.\n   It would also be helpful to accumulate average round-trip times\
    \ and\n   total bits sent for the duration of the experiment.\n   At UCLA, the\
    \ traffic generator permits the following specifications:\n         a) message\
    \ header (includes link #)\n         b) message length (for each link) - distribution\
    \ (can be\n            constant for each link)\n         c) message inter-arrival\
    \ time - distribution for each link\n         d) Duration of generation in seconds\n\
    \   We can also send imperative commands to the program to stop message\n   generation\
    \ prematurely.  Throughput and average response times (Round\n   Trip delays)\
    \ are automatically accumulated for each link and are\n   published at the end\
    \ of the experiment.\n   A more sophisticated version will also permit specification\
    \ of ICP\n   socket number for the Process Discard experiments.  The idea is to\n\
    \   have a number of artificial traffic generators available at different\n  \
    \ sites and to be able to start these up remotely from UCLA/NMC during\n   the\
    \ course of a measurement experiment.  More details of the desired\n   generator\
    \ will be published in another RFC.\n"
