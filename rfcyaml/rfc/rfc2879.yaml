  - "1. Introduction\n   This document defines a content media feature schema for
    Internet\n   fax.\n   It is a profile of the media feature registration mechanisms
    [1,2,3]\n   for use in performing capability identification between extended\n
    \  Internet fax systems [5].  It replaces and updates the feature schema\n   defined
    in RFC 2531.\n   The media feature description mechanisms do not describe any
    specific\n   mechanisms for communicating capability information, but do presume\n
    \  that any such mechanisms will transfer textual values.  In\n   conjunction
    with this feature schema, they specify a textual format\n   to be used for describing
    Internet Fax capability information.\n   The range of capabilities that can be
    indicated are based on those\n   covered by the TIFF file format for Internet
    fax [7] and Group 3\n   facsimile [6].  A companion document [4] describes the
    relationship\n   and mapping between this schema and Group 3 fax capabilities.\n"

      are to be recognized and\n   processed by extended Internet fax systems, according
      to their\n   capabilities.\n   Appendix A contains additional feature tag registrations

    - "1.2 Terminology and document conventions\n   The term \"extended Internet fax
      system\" is used to describe any\n   software, device or combination of these
      that conforms to the\n   specification \"Extended Facsimile Using Internet Mail\"
      [5].\n   \"capability exchange\" describes any transfer of information between\n
      \  communicating systems that is used to indicate system capabilities\n   and
      hence determine the form of data transferred.  This term covers\n   both one-way
      and two-way transfers of capability information.\n   \"capability identification\"
      is a particular form of capability\n   exchange in which a receiving system
      provides capability information\n   to a sending system.\n   \"capability description\"
      is a collection of data presented in some\n   specific format that describes
      the capabilities of some communicating\n   entity.  It may exist separately
      from any specific capability\n   exchange mechanism.\n        NOTE:  Comments
      like this provide additional nonessential\n        information about the rationale
      behind this document.\n        Such information is not needed for building a
      conformant\n        implementation, but may help those who wish to understand\n
      \       the design in greater depth.\n"

    title: 1.3 Discussion of this document
  title: 1. Introduction
- contents:
  - "2. Fax feature schema syntax\n   The syntax for the fax feature schema is described
    by \"A syntax for\n   describing media feature sets\" [2].  This in turn calls
    upon media\n   feature tags that may be registered according to the procedure\n
    \  described in \"Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure\" [1].\n        NOTE:
    \ Media feature registration provides a base\n        vocabulary of features that
    correspond to media handling\n        capabilities.  The feature set syntax provides
    a\n        mechanism and format for combining these to describe\n        combinations
    of features.  This memo indicates those\n        features that may be associated
    with extended Internet\n        fax systems.\n"
  title: 2. Fax feature schema syntax
- contents:
  - "3. Internet fax feature tags\n   This section enumerates and briefly describes
    a number of feature\n   tags that are defined for use with extended Internet fax
    systems and\n   applications.  These tags may be used also by other systems and\n
    \  applications that support corresponding capabilities.\n   The feature tags
    presented below are those that an extended Internet\n   fax system is expected
    to recognize its ability or non-ability to\n   handle.\n   Definitive descriptions
    of feature tags are indicated by reference to\n   their registration according
    to the media feature registration\n   procedure [1] (some of which are appended
    to this document).\n        NOTE:  The presence of a feature tag in this list
    does\n        not mean that an extended Internet fax system must have\n        that
    capability;  rather, it must recognize the feature\n        tag and deal with
    it according to the capabilities that\n        it does have.\n        Further,
    an extended Internet fax system is not prevented\n        from recognizing and
    offering additional feature tags.\n        The list below is intended to provide
    a basic vocabulary\n        that all extended Internet fax systems can use in
    a\n        consistent fashion.\n        If an unrecognized or unused feature tag
    is received, the\n        feature set matching rule (described in [2]) operates
    so\n        that tag is effectively ignored.\n"

      for image handling (both color and non-color) is\n   described here from a receiver's
      perspective;  a similar model\n   operates in the reverse direction for a scan/send
      perspective:\n        raw bit        pixel         color         physical\n
      \       stream  -(A)-> values -(B)-> values -(C)-> rendition\n    -   \"raw
      bit stream\" is a stream of coded bits\n   (A)  indicates image coding/decoding
      (MH,MR,MMR,JPEG,JBIG,etc.)\n    -   \"pixel values\" are a single numeric value
      per picture element\n        that designates the color of that element.\n   (B)
      \ indicates pixel-to-color value mapping\n    -   \"color values\" have a separate
      numeric value for each color\n        component (i.e. L*, a*, b* in the case
      of CIELAB indicated\n        above.)\n   (C)  indicates how the color values
      are related to a physical\n        color.  This involves interpretation of the
      color value with\n        respect to a color model (e.g. RGB, L*a*b*, CMY, CMYK)
      and a\n        color space (which is typically recipient-dependent).\n    -
      \  \"physical rendition\" is a color value physically realized on a\n        display,
      printer or other device.\n   There are many variables that can be applied at
      each stage of the\n   processing of a color image, and any may be critical to
      meaningful\n   handling of that image in some circumstances.  In other circumstances\n
      \  many of the variables may be implied (to some level of approximation)\n   in
      the application that uses them (e.g. color images published on a\n   Web page).\n
      \  The color feature framework described here is intended to allow\n   capability
      description at a range of granularity:  feature tags which\n   correspond to
      implied (or \"don't care\" or \"unknown\") feature values\n   may simply be
      omitted from a capability description.\n   Grey scale and bi-level images are
      handled within this framework as a\n   special case, having a 1-component color
      model.  The following\n   features are used for describing color capabilities:\n
      \  'color-levels' indicates the number of distinct values for each\n   picture
      element, and applies to all but bi-level images.  For bi-\n   level images,
      a value of 2 is implied.\n   'color-space' is used mainly with 'Mapped' and
      'Full', but could be\n   used with other modes if the exact color or color model
      used is\n   significant.  Two kinds of color space can be distinguished:\n   device-dependent
      and calibrated.  Device dependent spaces are named\n   here as 'Device-xxx',
      and are used to indicate a color space that is\n   defined by the receiving
      device.  Calibrated color spaces presume the\n   existence of a rendering system
      that is calibrated with respect to an\n   indicated definition, and is capable
      of processing the device-\n   independent color information accordingly.\n   A
      color-handling receiver should indicate any appropriate device\n   color space
      capability in addition to any calibrated color spaces\n   that it may support.
      \ A calibrated color space should be used when\n   precise color matching is
      required in the absence of specific\n   knowledge of the receiving system.\n
      \    NOTE:  In practice, although they appear to be separate\n     concepts,
      the color model and color space cannot be\n     separated.  In the final analysis,
      a color model (RGB,\n     CMY, etc.) must be defined with respect to some color\n
      \    space.\n   'color-illuminant' indicates a CIE illuminant, using the same
      general\n   form that is used for this purpose by Group 3 fax (as defined in
      ITU\n   T.4 [13], section E.6.7).  When the illuminant is specified by its\n
      \  color temperature, the token string 'CTnnnn' is used, where 'nnnn' is\n   a
      decimal number that is the color temperature in Kelvins; e.g.\n   CT7500 indicates
      an illuminant color temperature of 7500K.\n     NOTE: ITU T.4 indicates a binary
      representation for color\n     temperature values.\n     In practice, much of
      the illuminant detail given here\n     will probably be unused by Internet fax.
      \ The only value\n     likely to be specified is 'D50', which is the default\n
      \    color illuminant for Group 3 fax.\n   'CIELAB-L-depth', 'CIELAB-a-depth'
      and 'CIELAB-b-depth' indicate the\n   number of different values that are possible
      for the L*, a* and b*\n   color components respectively, and are significant
      only when colors\n   are represented in a CIELAB color space.  These features
      would be\n   used with palletized color, or with full color where each color\n
      \  component has a different number of possible values.\n   Color depth values
      relate to the representation of colour values\n   rather than the resolution
      of a scanning or rendering device.  Thus,\n   if 256 different L-component values
      can be represented then the\n   assertion (CIELAB-L-depth<=256) is used, even
      if a receiving device\n   can render only 100 distinct luminance values.  (Color
      rendering\n   resolution is not covered by this memo.)\n   The 'CIELAB-x-min'
      and 'CIELAB-x-max' values indicate a color gamut\n   (i.e. a range of color
      values that are used or may be rendered).  A\n   gamut may be indicated in terms
      of the CIELAB color space even when\n   colors are represented in some other
      space.\n"

      \  Reference: this document, appendix A.\n   'image-file-structure' defines
      how the coded image data is wrapped\n   and formatted.  The following options
      are defined here:\n   o  'TIFF' indicates image data enclosed and tagged using
      TIFF\n      structures described in Adobe's definition of TIFF [20].\n   o  'TIFF-limited'
      indicates image data structured using TIFF, but\n      with the limitations
      on the placement of Image File Descriptors\n      (IFDs) indicated in section
      4.4.6 of RFC 2301 [7].\n   o  'TIFF-minimal' indicates a TIFF image format that
      meets the IFD\n      placement, byte ordering and bit ordering requirements
      of the\n      \"minimal black and white mode\" described in section 3.5 of RFC\n
      \     2301 [7], also known as TIFF-S.\n   o  'TIFF-MRC' uses a TIFF image structure
      [20] augmented with a sub-\n      IFD structure, described for the \"Mixed Raster
      Content mode\" in\n      section 8.1.2 of RFC 2301 [7], also known as TIFF-M.
      \ This\n      provides a file structure to contain composite images constructed\n
      \     using the MRC model described in T.44 [15] (see tag 'MRC-mode').\n   o
      \ 'TIFF-MRC-limited' is the same as 'TIFF-MRC', except that the\n      primary
      IFD (i.e. top-level IFDs, as opposed to sub-IFDs)\n      placement is constrained
      in the same way as 'TIFF-limited'.\n   'image-coding' describes how raw image
      data is compressed and coded\n   as a sequence of bits.  These are generic tags
      that may apply to a\n   range of file formats and usage environments.\n   'image-coding-constraint'
      describes how the raw image data coding\n   method is constrained to meet a
      particular operating environment.\n   Options defined here are JBIG and JPEG
      coding constraints that apply\n   in typical Group 3 fax environments.\n   The
      'JBIG-stripe-size' feature may be used with JBIG image coding,\n   and indicates
      the number of scan lines in each stripe except the last\n   in an image.  The
      legal constraints are:\n      (JBIG-stripe-size=128)\n      (JBIG-stripe-size>=0)\n
      \  The latter being equivalent to no restriction.\n     NOTE: there are several
      image coding options here, and\n     not all are required in all circumstances.\n
      \    Specification of the image-file-structure tag value alone\n     is not
      normally sufficient to describe the capabilities\n     of a recipient.  A general
      rule is that sufficient detail\n     should be provided to exclude any unsupported
      features.\n     For extended Internet fax, image-file-structure and\n     image-coding
      should always be specified, together with\n     additional values described
      above as needed to clearly\n     indicate which feature tag values are supported
      and which\n     are not.  (See also the examples in section 4.)\n"

      \  MRC-mode            <Integer> (0..7)   (per ITU T.44 [15])\n   MRC-max-stripe-size
      <Integer>\n   Reference: this document, appendix A.\n   The 'MRC-mode' feature
      is used to indicate the availability of MRC\n   (mixed raster content) image
      format capability.  A zero value\n   indicates MRC is not available, a non-zero
      value indicates the\n   maximum available MRC mode number.\n   An MRC formatted
      document is actually a collection of several images,\n   each of which is described
      by a separate feature collection.  An\n   MRC-capable receiver is presumed to
      be capable of accepting any\n   combination of contained images that conform
      to both the MRC\n   construction rules and the image-coding capabilities declared\n
      \  elsewhere.\n   Within an MRC-formatted document, multi-level coders are used
      for\n   foreground and background images (i.e. odd-numbered layers: 1, 3, 5,\n
      \  etc.) and bi-level coders are used for mask layers (i.e. even\n   numbered
      layers 2, 4, 6, etc.).  MRC format also imposes constraints\n   on the resolutions
      that can be used.\n   The 'MRC-max-stripe-size' feature may be used with MRC
      coding, and\n   indicates the maximum number of scan lines in each MRC stripe.
      \ The\n   legal constraints are:\n      (MRC-max-stripe-size<=256)\n      (MRC-max-stripe-size>=0)\n
      \  These values indicate upper bounds on the stripe size.  The actual\n   value
      may vary between stripes, and the actual size for each stripe\n   is indicated
      in the image data.\n"

    - "4.7 Sender and receiver feature matching\n   This example considers sending
      a document to an enhanced black-and-\n   white fax system with the following
      receiver capabilities:\n      (& (| (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyatio=200/100) )\n            (&
      (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=1) )\n            (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1) )\n            (&

      (ua-media=[stationery,transparency]) )\n            (& (paper-size=B4) (ua-media=continuous)
      ) )\n         (image-coding=[MH,MR,JBIG]) )\n   Turning to the document itself,
      assume it is available to the sender\n   in three possible formats, A4 high
      resolution, B4 low resolution and\n   A4 high resolution color, described by:\n
      \     (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)\n         (color=Binary)\n         (paper-size=A4)\n
      \        (image-coding=[MMR,JBIG]) )\n      (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=200/100)\n
      \        (color=Binary)\n         (paper-size=B4)\n         (image-coding=[MH,MR])
      )\n      (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)\n         (color=Mapped) (color-levels<=256)\n
      \        (paper-size=A4)\n         (image-coding=JPEG) )\n   These three image
      formats can be combined into a composite capability\n   statement by a logical-OR
      operation (to describe format-1 OR format-2\n   OR format-3):\n      (| (& (dpi=300)
      (dpi-xyratio=1)\n            (color=Binary)\n            (paper-size=A4)\n            (image-coding=[MMR,JBIG])
      )\n         (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=200/100)\n            (color=Binary)\n
      \           (paper-size=B4)\n            (image-coding=[MH,MR]) )\n         (&
      (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)\n            (color=Mapped) (color-levels=42)\n            (paper-size=A4)\n
      \           (image-coding=JPEG) ) )\n   This could be simplified, but there
      is little gain in doing so at\n   this point.\n   The composite document description
      can be matched with the receiver\n   capability description, according to the
      rules in [2], to yield the\n   result:\n      (| (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)\n
      \           (color=Binary)\n            (paper-size=A4)\n            (ua-media=[stationery,transparency])\n
      \           (image-coding=JBIG) )\n         (& (dpi=200) (dpi-xyratio=200/100)\n
      \           (color=Binary)\n            (paper-size=B4)\n            (ua-media=continuous)\n
      \           (image-coding=[MH,MR]) ) )\n   Points to note about the feature
      matching process:\n   o  The color document option is eliminated because the
      receiver\n      cannot handle either color (indicated by '(color=Mapped)') or\n
      \     JPEG coding (indicated by '(image-coding=JPEG)').\n   o  The high resolution
      version of the document with '(dpi=300)' must\n      be send using '(image-coding=JBIG)'
      because this is the only\n      available coding of the image data that the
      receiver can use for\n      high resolution documents.  (The available 300dpi
      document\n      codings here are MMR and JBIG, and the receiver capabilities
      are\n      MH, MR and JBIG.)\n   o  The low-resolution version of the document
      can be sent with\n      either MH or MR coding as the receiver can deal with
      either of\n      these for low resolution documents.\n   o  The high resolution
      variant of the document is available only for\n      A4, so that is the paper-size
      used in that case.  Similarly the\n      low resolution version is sent for
      B4 paper.\n   o  Even though the sender may not understand the 'ua-media' feature\n
      \     tag, and does not mention it, the matching rules preserve the\n      constraint
      that the B4 document is rendered with\n     '(ua-media=continuous)', and the
      A4 document may be rendered with\n     '(ua-media=[stationery,transparency])'.\n
      \  Finally, note that when matching an MRC document description, the\n   description
      of each component sub-image must match the capabilities\n   of the intended
      receiver.\n"

      media features indicated:\n        These feature tags indicate the size of a
      displayed, printed\n        or otherwise rendered document image;  they indicate\n
      \       horizontal (size-x) and vertical (size-y) dimensions.\n        The unit
      of measure is inches (to be consistent with the\n        measure of resolution
      defined by the feature tag 'dpi').\n        Where the actual size is available
      in millimetres, a\n        conversion factor of 10/254 may be applied to yield

      of typical use:\n        This example describes the maximum scanned image width
      and\n        height for Group 3 fax: 215x297 mm (8.46x11.69 inches):\n        (size-x<=2150/254)\n
      \       (size-y<=2970/254)\n   -  Related standards or documents:\n        The
      memo \"Media Features for Display, Print, and Fax\" [3]\n        describes features
      (pix-x, pix-y) for measuring document size\n        in pixels.\n        Fax
      applications should declare physical dimensions using the\n        features
      defined here.\n   -  Considerations particular to use in individual applications,\n
      \     protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:\n        Where no physical
      size is known or available, but a pixel size\n        is known, a notional size
      should be declared based upon known\n        pixel dimensions and a notional
      resolution of (say) 100dpi\n        For example, to describe a 640x480 pixel
      display:\n           (& (size-x<=640/100) (size-y<=480/100) (dpi=100) )\n        The
      notional 100dpi resolution is used as it represents a\n        fairly typical
      resolution for a pixel-limited display.\n        Reducing the rational numbers
      to canonical form gives the\n        following equivalent expression:\n           (&
      (size-x<=32/5) (size-y<=24/5) (dpi=100) )\n   -  Interoperability considerations:\n
      \       For interoperability with other (non-fax) applications that\n        use
      only pixel-based measurements, pixel dimensions (pix-x,\n        pix-y) may
      be declared in addition to physical measurements.\n   -  Related feature tags:\n

      \          of the \"minimal black and white mode\" described in section\n           3.5
      of RFC 2301 [7], also known as TIFF-S.\n        o  'TIFF-MRC' uses a TIFF image
      structure [20] augmented with a\n           sub-IFD structure, described for
