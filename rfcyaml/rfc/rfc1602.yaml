  - "Abstract\n   This document is a revision of RFC 1310, which defined the official\n\
    \   procedures for creating and documenting Internet Standards.\n   This revision\
    \ (revision 2) includes the following major changes:\n   (a)  The new management\
    \ structure arising from the POISED Working\n        Group is reflected.  These\
    \ changes were agreed to by the IETF\n        plenary and by the IAB and IESG\
    \ in November 1992 and accepted by\n        the ISOC Board of Trustees at their\
    \ December 1992 meeting.\n   (b)  Prototype status is added to the non-standards\
    \ track maturity\n        levels (Section 2.4.1).\n   (c)  The Intellectual Property\
    \ Rights section is completely revised,\n        in accordance with legal advice.\
    \  Section 5 of this document\n        replaces Sections 5 and 6 of RFC-1310.\
    \  The new section 5 has\n        been reviewed by legal counsel to the Internet\
    \ Society.\n   (d)  An appeals procedure is added (Section 3.6).\n   (e)  The\
    \ wording of sections 1 and 1.2 has been changed to clarify\n        the relationships\
    \ that exist between the Internet Society and\n        the IAB, the IESG, the\
    \ IETF, and the Internet Standards process.\n   (f)  An Appendix B has been added,\
    \ listing the contact points for the\n        RFC editor, the IANA, the IESG,\

  - "1.  INTRODUCTION\n   This memo documents the process currently used by the Internet\n\
    \   community for the standardization of protocols and procedures.  The\n   Internet\
    \ Standards process is an activity of the Internet Society\n   that is organized\
    \ and managed on behalf of the Internet community by\n   the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering\n   Steering Group.\n   1.1  Internet\
    \ Standards\n      The Internet, a loosely-organized international collaboration\
    \ of\n      autonomous, interconnected networks, supports host-to-host\n     \
    \ communication through voluntary adherence to open protocols and\n      procedures\
    \ defined by Internet Standards.  There are also many\n      isolated internets,\
    \ i.e., sets of interconnected networks, which\n      are not connected to the\
    \ Internet but use the Internet Standards.\n      Internet Standards were once\
    \ limited to those protocols composing\n      what has been commonly known as\
    \ the \"TCP/IP protocol suite\".\n      However, the Internet has been evolving\
    \ towards the support of\n      multiple protocol suites, especially the Open\
    \ Systems\n      Interconnection (OSI) suite.  The Internet Standards process\n\
    \      described in this document is concerned with all protocols,\n      procedures,\
    \ and conventions that are used in or by the Internet,\n      whether or not they\
    \ are part of the TCP/IP protocol suite.  In the\n      case of protocols developed\
    \ and/or standardized by non-Internet\n      organizations, however, the Internet\
    \ Standards process may apply\n      only to the application of the protocol or\
    \ procedure in the\n      Internet context, not to the specification of the protocol\
    \ itself.\n      In general, an Internet Standard is a specification that is stable\n\
    \      and well-understood, is technically competent, has multiple,\n      independent,\
    \ and interoperable implementations with substantial\n      operational experience,\
    \ enjoys significant public support, and is\n      recognizably useful in some\
    \ or all parts of the Internet.\n      The procedures described in this document\
    \ are designed to be fair,\n      open and objective; to reflect existing (proven)\
    \ practice; and to\n      be flexible.\n      o    These procedures are intended\
    \ to provide a fair, open, and\n           objective basis for developing, evaluating,\
    \ and adopting\n           Internet Standards.  They provide ample opportunity\
    \ for\n           participation and comment by all interested parties.  At each\n\
    \           stage of the standardization process, a specification is\n       \
    \    repeatedly discussed and its merits debated in open meetings\n          \
    \ and/or public electronic mailing lists, and it is made\n           available\
    \ for review via world-wide on-line directories.\n      o    These procedures\
    \ are explicitly aimed at recognizing and\n           adopting generally-accepted\
    \ practices.  Thus, a candidate\n           specification is implemented and tested\
    \ for correct operation\n           and interoperability by multiple independent\
    \ parties and\n           utilized in increasingly demanding environments, before\
    \ it\n           can be adopted as an Internet Standard.\n      o    These procedures\
    \ provide a great deal of flexibility to adapt\n           to the wide variety\
    \ of circumstances that occur in the\n           standardization process.  Experience\
    \ has shown this\n           flexibility to be vital in achieving the goals listed\
    \ above.\n      The goal of technical competence, the requirement for prior\n\
    \      implementation and testing, and the need to allow all interested\n    \
    \  parties to comment, all require significant time and effort.  On\n      the\
    \ other hand, today's rapid development of networking technology\n      places\
    \ an urgency on timely development of standards.  The\n      Internet standardization\
    \ rules described here are intended to\n      balance these conflicting goals.\
    \  The process is believed to be as\n      short and simple as possible without\
    \ undue sacrifice of technical\n      competence, prior testing, or openness and\
    \ fairness.\n      In summary, the goals for the Internet standards process are:\n\
    \      *    technical excellence;\n      *    prior implementation and testing;\n\
    \      *    clear, short, and easily understandable documentation;\n      *  \
    \  openness and fairness; and\n      *    timeliness.\n      In outline, the process\
    \ of creating an Internet Standard is\n      straightforward: a specification\
    \ undergoes a period of development\n      and several iterations of review by\
    \ the Internet community and\n      revision based upon experience, is adopted\
    \ as a Standard by the\n      appropriate body (see below), and is published.\
    \  In practice, the\n      process is more complicated, due to (1) the difficulty\
    \ of creating\n      specifications of high technical quality; (2) the need to\
    \ consider\n      the interests of all of the affected parties; (3) the importance\n\
    \      of establishing widespread community consensus; and (4) the\n      difficulty\
    \ of evaluating the utility of a particular specification\n      for the Internet\
    \ community.\n      From its inception, the Internet has been, and is expected\
    \ to\n      remain, an evolving system whose participants regularly factor new\n\
    \      requirements and technology into its design and implementation.\n     \
    \ Users of the Internet and providers of the equipment, software,\n      and services\
    \ that support it should anticipate and embrace this\n      evolution as a major\
    \ tenet of Internet philosophy.\n      The procedures described in this document\
    \ are the result of three\n      years of evolution, driven both by the needs\
    \ of the growing and\n      increasingly diverse Internet community, and by experience.\n\
    \      Comments and suggestions are invited for improving these\n      procedures.\n\
    \      The remainder of this section describes the organizations and\n      publications\
    \ involved in Internet standardization.  Section 2\n      presents the nomenclature\
    \ for different kinds and levels of\n      Internet standard technical specifications\
    \ and their\n      applicability.  Section 3 describes the process and rules for\n\
    \      Internet standardization.  Section 4 defines how relevant\n      externally-sponsored\
    \ specifications and practices, developed and\n      controlled by other standards\
    \ bodies or by vendors, are handled in\n      the Internet standardization process.\
    \  Section 5 presents the\n      rules that are required to protect intellectual\
    \ property rights\n      and to assure unrestricted ability for all interested\
    \ parties to\n      practice Internet Standards.\n   1.2  Organizations\n    \
    \  The following organizations are involved in the Internet standards\n      process.\n\
    \      *    IETF\n           The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a loosely\
    \ self-\n           organized group of people who make technical and other\n \
    \          contributions to the engineering and evolution of the\n           Internet\
    \ and its technologies.  It is the principal body\n           engaged in the development\
    \ of new Internet Standard\n           specifications, although it is not itself\
    \ a part of the\n           Internet Society.  The IETF is composed of individual\
    \ Working\n           Groups, which are grouped into Areas, each of which is\n\
    \           coordinated by one or more Area Directors.  Nominations to\n     \
    \      the Internet Architecture Board and the Internet Engineering\n        \
    \   Steering Group are made by a nominating committee selected at\n          \
    \ random from the ranks of regular IETF meeting attendees who\n           have\
    \ volunteered to serve as nominating committee members.\n      *    ISOC\n   \
    \        Internet standardization is an organized activity of the\n          \
    \ Internet Society (ISOC).  The ISOC is a professional society\n           that\
    \ is concerned with the growth and evolution of the\n           worldwide Internet,\
    \ with the way in which the Internet is and\n           can be used, and with\
    \ the social, political, and technical\n           issues that arise as a result.\
    \  The ISOC Board of Trustees is\n           responsible for approving appointments\
    \ to the Internet\n           Architecture Board from among the nominees submitted\
    \ by the\n           IETF nominating committee.\n      *    IESG\n           The\
    \ Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) is responsible\n           for technical\
    \ management of IETF activities and the Internet\n           Standards process.\
    \  As part of the Internet Society, it\n           administers the Internet Standards\
    \ process according to the\n           rules and procedures given in this document,\
    \ which have been\n           accepted and ratified by the Internet Society Trustees.\
    \  The\n           IESG is directly responsible for the actions associated with\n\
    \           entry into and movement along the \"standards track\", as\n      \
    \     described in section 3 of this document, including final\n           approval\
    \ of specifications as Internet Standards.  The IESG\n           is composed of\
    \ the IETF Area Directors and the chairperson of\n           the IETF, who also\
    \ serves as the chairperson of the IESG.\n      *    IAB\n           The Internet\
    \ Architecture Board (IAB) is a technical advisory\n           group of the Internet\
    \ Society.  It is chartered by the\n           Internet Society Trustees to provide\
    \ oversight of the\n           architecture of the Internet and its protocols,\
    \ and to serve\n           in the context of the Internet Standards process as\
    \ a body to\n           which the decisions of the IESG may be appealed (as described\n\
    \           in section 3.6 of this document).  The IAB is responsible for\n  \
    \         approving appointments to the IESG from among the nominees\n       \
    \    submitted by the IETF nominating committee.\n      Any member of the Internet\
    \ community with the time and interest is\n      urged to participate actively\
    \ in one or more IETF Working Groups\n      and to attend IETF meetings.  In many\
    \ cases, active Working Group\n      participation is possible through email alone;\
    \ furthermore,\n      Internet video conferencing is being used experimentally\
    \ to allow\n      remote participation.  Participation is by individual technical\n\
    \      contributors rather than formal representatives of organizations.\n   \
    \   The process works because the IETF Working Groups display a spirit\n     \
    \ of cooperation as well as a high degree of technical maturity;\n      IETF participants\
    \ recognize that the greatest benefit for all\n      members of the Internet community\
    \ results from cooperative\n      development of technically superior protocols\
    \ and services.\n      Members of the IESG and IAB are nominated for two-year\
    \ terms by a\n      committee that is drawn from the roll of recent participation\
    \ in\n      the IETF and chartered by the ISOC Board of Trustees.  The\n     \
    \ appointment of IESG and of IAB members are made from these\n      nominations\
    \ by the IAB and by the ISOC Board of Trustees,\n      respectively.\n      The\
    \ Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) is not directly part of\n      the standards\
    \ process.  It investigates topics considered to be\n      too uncertain, too\
    \ advanced, or insufficiently well-understood to\n      be the subject of Internet\
    \ standardization.  When an IRTF activity\n      generates a specification that\
    \ is sufficiently stable to be\n      considered for Internet standardization,\
    \ the specification is\n      processed through the IETF using the rules in this\
    \ document.\n   1.3  Standards-Related Publications\n      1.3.1  Requests for\
    \ Comments (RFCs)\n         Each distinct version of a specification is published\
    \ as part\n         of the \"Request for Comments\" (RFC) document series.  This\n\
    \         archival series is the official publication channel for\n         Internet\
    \ standards documents and other publications of the\n         IESG, IAB, and Internet\
    \ community.  RFCs are available for\n         anonymous FTP from a number of\
    \ Internet hosts.\n         The RFC series of documents on networking began in\
    \ 1969 as part\n         of the original ARPA wide-area networking (ARPANET) project\n\
    \         (see Appendix A for glossary of acronyms).  RFCs cover a wide\n    \
    \     range of topics, from early discussion of new research concepts\n      \
    \   to status memos about the Internet.  RFC publication is the\n         direct\
    \ responsibility of the RFC Editor, under the general\n         direction of the\
    \ IAB.\n         The rules for formatting and submitting an RFC are defined in\n\
    \         reference [5].  Every RFC is available in ASCII text, but some\n   \
    \      RFCs are also available in PostScript.  The PostScript version\n      \
    \   of an RFC may contain material (such as diagrams and figures)\n         that\
    \ is not present in the ASCII version, and it may be\n         formatted differently.\n\
    \         *********************************************************\n        \
    \ *  A stricter requirement applies to standards-track    *\n         *  specifications:\
    \ the ASCII text version is the        *\n         *  definitive reference, and\
    \ therefore it must be a     *\n         *  complete and accurate specification\
    \ of the standard, *\n         *  including all necessary diagrams and illustrations.\
    \  *\n         *                                                       *\n   \
    \      *********************************************************\n         The\
    \ status of Internet protocol and service specifications is\n         summarized\
    \ periodically in an RFC entitled \"Internet Official\n         Protocol Standards\"\
    \ [1].  This RFC shows the level of maturity\n         and other helpful information\
    \ for each Internet protocol or\n         service specification.  See Section\
    \ 3.1.3 below.\n         Some RFCs document Internet standards.  These RFCs form\
    \ the\n         'STD' subseries of the RFC series [4].  When a specification\n\
    \         has been adopted as an Internet Standard, it is given the\n        \
    \ additional label \"STDxxxx\", but it keeps its RFC number and its\n        \
    \ place in the RFC series.\n         Not all specifications of protocols or services\
    \ for the\n         Internet should or will become Internet Standards.  Such non-\n\
    \         standards track specifications are not subject to the rules for\n  \
    \       Internet standardization.  Generally, they will be published\n       \
    \  directly as RFCs at the discretion of the RFC editor and the\n         IESG.\
    \  These RFCs will be marked \"Prototype\", \"Experimental\" or\n         \"Informational\"\
    \ as appropriate (see section 2.3).\n         ********************************************************\n\
    \         *   It is important to remember that not all RFCs      *\n         *\
    \   are standards track documents, and that not all    *\n         *   standards\
    \ track documents reach the level of       *\n         *   Internet Standard.\
    \                                 *\n         ********************************************************\n\
    \      1.3.2  Internet Drafts\n         During the development of a specification,\
    \ draft versions of\n         the document are made available for informal review\
    \ and comment\n         by placing them in the IETF's \"Internet Drafts\" directory,\n\
    \         which is replicated on a number of Internet hosts.  This makes\n   \
    \      an evolving working document readily available to a wide\n         audience,\
    \ facilitating the process of review and revision.\n         An Internet Draft\
    \ that is published as an RFC, or that has\n         remained unchanged in the\
    \ Internet Drafts directory for more\n         than six months without being recommended\
    \ by the IESG for\n         publication as an RFC, is simply removed from the\
    \ Internet\n         Draft directory.  At any time, an Internet Draft may be\n\
    \         replaced by a more recent version of the same specification,\n     \
    \    restarting the six-month timeout period.\n         An Internet Draft is NOT\
    \ a means of \"publishing\" a\n         specification; specifications are published\
    \ through the RFC\n         mechanism described in the previous section.  Internet\
    \ Drafts\n         have no formal status, are not part of the permanent archival\n\
    \         record of Internet activity, and are subject to change or\n        \
    \ removal at any time.\n         ********************************************************\n\
    \         *   Under no circumstances should an Internet Draft    *\n         *\
    \   be referenced by any paper, report, or Request-for-*\n         *   Proposal,\
    \ nor should a vendor claim compliance     *\n         *   with an Internet-Draft.\
    \                            *\n         ********************************************************\n\
    \         Note: It is acceptable to reference a standards-track\n         specification\
    \ that may reasonably be expected to be published\n         as an RFC using the\
    \ phrase \"Work in Progress\", without\n         referencing an Internet Draft.\n\
    \   1.4  Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA)\n      Many protocol specifications\
    \ include numbers, keywords, and other\n      parameters that must be uniquely\
    \ assigned.  Examples include\n      version numbers, protocol numbers, port numbers,\
    \ and MIB numbers.\n      The IAB has delegated to the Internet Assigned Numbers\
    \ Authority\n      (IANA) the task of assigning such protocol parameters for the\n\
    \      Internet.  The IANA publishes tables of all currently assigned\n      numbers\
    \ and parameters in RFCs titled \"Assigned Numbers\" [3].\n      Each category\
    \ of assigned numbers typically arises from some\n      protocol that is on the\
    \ standards track or is an Internet\n      Standard.  For example, TCP port numbers\
    \ are assigned because TCP\n      is a Standard.  A particular value within a\
    \ category may be\n      assigned in a variety of circumstances; the specification\n\
    \      requiring the parameter may be in the standards track, it may be\n    \
    \  Experimental, or it may be private.  Note that assignment of a\n      number\
    \ to a protocol is independent of, and does not imply,\n      acceptance of that\
    \ protocol as a standard.\n      Chaos could result from accidental conflicts\
    \ of parameter values,\n      so we urge that every protocol parameter, for either\
    \ public or\n      private usage, be explicitly assigned by the IANA.  Private\n\
    \      protocols often become public.  Programmers are often tempted to\n    \
    \  choose a \"random\" value or to guess the next unassigned value of a\n    \
    \  parameter; both are hazardous.\n      The IANA is expected to avoid frivolous\
    \ assignments and to\n      distinguish different assignments uniquely.  The IANA\
    \ accomplishes\n      both goals by requiring a technical description of each\
    \ protocol\n      or service to which a value is to be assigned.  Judgment on\
    \ the\n      adequacy of the description resides with the IANA.  In the case of\n\
    \      a standards track or Experimental protocol, the corresponding\n      technical\
    \ specifications provide the required documentation for\n      IANA.  For a proprietary\
    \ protocol, the IANA will keep confidential\n      any writeup that is supplied,\
    \ but at least a short (2 page)\n      writeup is still required for an assignment.\n"

  - "2.  NOMENCLATURE\n   2.1  The Internet Standards Track\n      Specifications\
    \ that are destined to become Internet Standards\n      evolve through a set of\
    \ maturity levels known as the \"standards\n      track\".  These maturity levels\
    \ -- \"Proposed Standard\", \"Draft\n      Standard\", and \"Standard\" -- are\
    \ defined and discussed below in\n      Section 3.2.\n      Even after a specification\
    \ has been adopted as an Internet\n      Standard, further evolution often occurs\
    \ based on experience and\n      the recognition of new requirements.  The nomenclature\
    \ and\n      procedures of Internet standardization provide for the replacement\n\
    \      of old Internet Standards with new ones, and the assignment of\n      descriptive\
    \ labels to indicate the status of \"retired\" Internet\n      Standards.  A set\
    \ of maturity levels is defined in Section 3.3 to\n      cover these and other\
    \ \"off-track\" specifications.\n   2.2  Types of Specifications\n      Specifications\
    \ subject to the Internet standardization process\n      fall into two categories:\
    \  Technical Specifications (TS) and\n      Applicability Statements (AS).\n \
    \     2.2.1  Technical Specification (TS)\n         A Technical Specification\
    \ is any description of a protocol,\n         service, procedure, convention,\
    \ or format.  It may completely\n         describe all of the relevant aspects\
    \ of its subject, or it may\n         leave one or more parameters or options\
    \ unspecified.  A TS may\n         be completely self-contained, or it may incorporate\
    \ material\n         from other specifications by reference to other documents\n\
    \         (which may or may not be Internet Standards).\n         A TS shall include\
    \ a statement of its scope and the general\n         intent for its use (domain\
    \ of applicability).  Thus, a TS that\n         is inherently specific to a particular\
    \ context shall contain a\n         statement to that effect.  However, a TS does\
    \ not specify\n         requirements for its use within the Internet; these\n\
    \         requirements, which depend on the particular context in which\n    \
    \     the TS is incorporated by different system configurations, is\n        \
    \ defined by an Applicability Statement.\n      2.2.2  Applicability Statement\
    \ (AS)\n         An Applicability Statement specifies how, and under what\n  \
    \       circumstances, one or more TSs are to be applied to support a\n      \
    \   particular Internet capability.  An AS may specify uses for TSs\n        \
    \ that are not Internet Standards, as discussed in Section 4.\n         An AS\
    \ identifies the relevant TSs and the specific way in which\n         they are\
    \ to be combined, and may also specify particular values\n         or ranges of\
    \ TS parameters or subfunctions of a TS protocol\n         that must be implemented.\
    \  An AS also specifies the\n         circumstances in which the use of a particular\
    \ TS is required,\n         recommended, or elective.\n         An AS may describe\
    \ particular methods of using a TS in a\n         restricted \"domain of applicability\"\
    , such as Internet routers,\n         terminal servers, Internet systems that\
    \ interface to Ethernets,\n         or datagram-based database servers.\n    \
    \     The broadest type of AS is a comprehensive conformance\n         specification,\
    \ commonly called a \"requirements document\", for a\n         particular class\
    \ of Internet systems, such as Internet routers\n         or Internet hosts.\n\
    \         An AS may not have a higher maturity level in the standards\n      \
    \   track than any standards-track TS to which the AS applies.  For\n        \
    \ example, a TS at Draft Standard level may be referenced by an\n         AS at\
    \ the Proposed Standard or Draft Standard level, but not by\n         an AS at\
    \ the Standard level.\n         An AS may refer to a TS that is either a standards-track\
    \ speci-\n         fication or is \"Informational\", but not to a TS with a maturity\n\
    \         level of \"Prototype\", \"Experimental\", or \"Historic\" (see\n   \
    \      section 2.4).\n      Although TSs and ASs are conceptually separate, in\
    \ practice a\n      standards-track document may combine an AS and one or more\
    \ related\n      TSs.  For example, Technical Specifications that are developed\n\
    \      specifically and exclusively for some particular domain of\n      applicability,\
    \ e.g., for mail server hosts, often contain within a\n      single specification\
    \ all of the relevant AS and TS information.\n      In such cases, no useful purpose\
    \ would be served by deliberately\n      distributing the information among several\
    \ documents just to\n      preserve the formal AS/TS distinction.  However, a\
    \ TS that is\n      likely to apply to more than one domain of applicability should\
    \ be\n      developed in a modular fashion, to facilitate its incorporation by\n\
    \      multiple ASs.\n   2.3  Standards Track Maturity Levels\n      ASs and TSs\
    \ go through stages of development, testing, and\n      acceptance.  Within the\
    \ Internet standards process, these stages\n      are formally labeled \"maturity\
    \ levels\".\n      This section describes the maturity levels and the expected\n\
    \      characteristics of specifications at each level.\n      2.3.1  Proposed\
    \ Standard\n         The entry-level maturity for the standards track is \"Proposed\n\
    \         Standard\".  A Proposed Standard specification is generally\n      \
    \   stable, has resolved known design choices, is believed to be\n         well-understood,\
    \ has received significant community review, and\n         appears to enjoy enough\
    \ community interest to be considered\n         valuable.  However, further experience\
    \ might result in a change\n         or even retraction of the specification before\
    \ it advances.\n         Usually, neither implementation nor operational experience\
    \ is\n         required for the designation of a specification as a Proposed\n\
    \         Standard.  However, such experience is highly desirable, and\n     \
    \    will usually represent a strong argument in favor of a Proposed\n       \
    \  Standard designation.\n         The IESG may require implementation and/or\
    \ operational\n         experience prior to granting Proposed Standard status\
    \ to a\n         specification that materially affects the core Internet\n   \
    \      protocols or that specifies behavior that may have significant\n      \
    \   operational impact on the Internet.  Typically, such a\n         specification\
    \ will be published initially with Experimental or\n         Prototype status\
    \ (see below), and moved to the standards track\n         only after sufficient\
    \ implementation or operational experience\n         has been obtained.\n    \
    \     A Proposed Standard should have no known technical omissions\n         with\
    \ respect to the requirements placed upon it.  However, the\n         IESG may\
    \ recommend that this requirement be explicitly reduced\n         in order to\
    \ allow a protocol to advance into the Proposed\n         Standard state, when\
    \ a specification is considered to be useful\n         and necessary (and timely),\
    \ even absent the missing features.\n         Implementors should treat Proposed\
    \ Standards as immature\n         specifications.  It is desirable to implement\
    \ them in order to\n         gain experience and to validate, test, and clarify\
    \ the\n         specification.  However, since the content of Proposed\n     \
    \    Standards may be changed if problems are found or better\n         solutions\
    \ are identified, deploying implementations of such\n         standards into a\
    \ disruption-sensitive customer base is not\n         normally advisable.\n  \
    \    2.3.2  Draft Standard\n         A specification from which at least two independent\
    \ and\n         interoperable implementations have been developed, and for\n \
    \        which sufficient successful operational experience has been\n       \
    \  obtained, may be elevated to the \"Draft Standard\" level.  This\n        \
    \ is a major advance in status, indicating a strong belief that\n         the\
    \ specification is mature and will be useful.\n         A Draft Standard must\
    \ be well-understood and known to be quite\n         stable, both in its semantics\
    \ and as a basis for developing an\n         implementation.  A Draft Standard\
    \ may still require additional\n         or more widespread field experience,\
    \ since it is possible for\n         implementations based on Draft Standard specifications\
    \ to\n         demonstrate unforeseen behavior when subjected to large-scale\n\
    \         use in production environments.\n      2.3.3  Internet Standard\n  \
    \       A specification for which significant implementation and\n         successful\
    \ operational experience has been obtained may be\n         elevated to the Internet\
    \ Standard level.  An Internet Standard\n         (which may simply be referred\
    \ to as a Standard) is\n         characterized by a high degree of technical maturity\
    \ and by a\n         generally held belief that the specified protocol or service\n\
    \         provides significant benefit to the Internet community.\n         A\
    \ Draft Standard is normally considered to be a final\n         specification,\
    \ and changes are likely to be made only to solve\n         specific problems\
    \ encountered.  In most circumstances, it is\n         reasonable for vendors\
    \ to deploy implementations of draft\n         standards into the customer base.\n\
    \   2.4  Non-Standards Track Maturity Levels\n      Not every TS or AS is on the\
    \ standards track.  A TS may not be\n      intended to be an Internet Standard,\
    \ or it may be intended for\n      eventual standardization but not yet ready\
    \ to enter the standards\n      track.  A TS or AS may have been superseded by\
    \ more recent\n      Internet Standards, or have otherwise fallen into disuse\
    \ or\n      disfavor.\n      Specifications not on the standards track are labeled\
    \ with one of\n      four off-track maturity levels: \"Prototype, \"Experimental\"\
    ,\n      \"Informational\", and \"Historic\".  There are no time limits\n    \
    \  associated with these non-standard track labels, and the documents\n      bearing\
    \ these labels are not Internet standards in any sense.  As\n      the Internet\
    \ grows, there is a growing amount of credible\n      technical work being submitted\
    \ directly to the RFC Editor without\n      having been gone through the IETF.\
    \  It is possible that such\n      outside submissions may overlap or even conflict\
    \ with ongoing IETF\n      activities.  In order for the best technical result\
    \ to emerge for\n      the community, we believe that the such outside submissions\
    \ should\n      be given the opportunity to work within IETF to gain the broadest\n\
    \      possible consensus.\n      It is also possible that supporters of a view\
    \ different from the\n      IETF may wish to publish their divergent view.  For\
    \ this reason,\n      it is important that, ultimately, authors should have the\n\
    \      opportunity to publish Informational and Experimental RFCs should\n   \
    \   they wish to.  However, it is also possible that this could open a\n     \
    \ loophole in which developers could try to bypass the IETF\n      consensus process\
    \ completely by publishing an Informational RFC\n      (and relying on the prestige\
    \ of the RFC series to gain community\n      support for their document).\n  \
    \    For all these reasons, the IESG and the RFC Editor have agreed to\n     \
    \ the following policy for publishing Info and Exp RFCs:\n      1.   The RFC Editor\
    \ will bring to the attention of the IESG all\n           Informational and Experimental\
    \ submissions that the RFC\n           Editor feels may be related to, or of interest\
    \ to, the IETF\n           community.\n      2.   The IESG will review all such\
    \ referrals within a fixed length\n           of time and make a recommendation\
    \ on whether to publish, or\n           to suggest that the author bring their\
    \ work within the IETF.\n      3.   If the IESG recommends that the work be brought\
    \ within the\n           IETF, but the author declines the invitation, the IESG\
    \ may\n           add disclaimer text into the standard boilerplate material\n\
    \           added by the RFC Editor (e.g., \"Status of this memo\").\n       \
    \    2.4.1  Prototype\n              For new protocols which affect core services\
    \ of the\n              Internet or for which the interactions with existing\n\
    \              protocols are too complex to fully assimilate from the\n      \
    \        written specification, the IESG may request that\n              operational\
    \ experience be obtained prior to advancement to\n              Proposed Standard\
    \ status.  In these cases, the IESG will\n              designate an otherwise\
    \ complete specification as\n              \"Prototype\". This status permits\
    \ it to be published as an\n              RFC before it is entered onto the standards\
    \ track.  In\n              this respect, \"Prototype\" is similar to \"Experimental\"\
    ,\n              except that it indicates the protocol is specifically\n     \
    \         being developed to become a standard, while \"Experimental\"\n     \
    \         generally indicates a more exploratory phase of\n              development.\n\
    \           2.4.2  Experimental\n              The \"Experimental\" designation\
    \ on a TS typically denotes a\n              specification that is part of some\
    \ research or development\n              effort.  Such a specification is published\
    \ for the general\n              information of the Internet technical community\
    \ and as an\n              archival record of the work.  An Experimental\n   \
    \           specification may be the output of an organized Internet\n       \
    \       research effort (e.g., a Research Group of the IRTF), or\n           \
    \   it may be an individual contribution.\n              Documents intended for\
    \ Experimental status should be\n              submitted directly to the RFC Editor\
    \ for publication.  The\n              procedure is intended to expedite the publication\
    \ of any\n              responsible Experimental specification, subject only to\n\
    \              editorial considerations, and to verification that there\n    \
    \          has been adequate coordination with the standards process.\n      \
    \     2.4.3  Informational\n              An \"Informational\" specification is\
    \ published for the\n              general information of the Internet community,\
    \ and does\n              not represent an Internet community consensus or\n \
    \             recommendation.  The Informational designation is intended\n   \
    \           to provide for the timely publication of a very broad\n          \
    \    range of responsible informational documents from many\n              sources,\
    \ subject only to editorial considerations and to\n              verification\
    \ that there has been adequate coordination\n              with the standards\
    \ process.\n              Specifications that have been prepared outside of the\n\
    \              Internet community and are not incorporated into the\n        \
    \      Internet standards process by any of the provisions of\n              Section\
    \ 4 may be published as Informational RFCs, with the\n              permission\
    \ of the owner.\n           2.4.4  Historic\n              A TS or AS that has\
    \ been superseded by a more recent\n              specification or is for any\
    \ other reason considered to be\n              obsolete is assigned to the \"\
    Historic\" level.  (Purists\n              have suggested that the word should\
    \ be \"Historical\";\n              however, at this point the use of \"Historic\"\
    \ is\n              historical.)\n        2.5  Requirement Levels\n          \
    \ An AS may apply one of the following \"requirement levels\" to\n           each\
    \ of the TSs to which it refers:\n      (a)  Required:  Implementation of the\
    \ referenced TS, as specified\n           by the AS, is required to achieve minimal\
    \ conformance.  For\n           example, IP and ICMP must be implemented by all\
    \ Internet\n           systems using the TCP/IP Protocol Suite.\n      (b)  Recommended:\
    \  Implementation of the referenced TS is not\n           required for minimal\
    \ conformance, but experience and/or\n           generally accepted technical\
    \ wisdom suggest its desirability\n           in the domain of applicability of\
    \ the AS.  Vendors are\n           strongly encouraged to include the functions,\
    \ features, and\n           protocols of Recommended TSs in their products, and\
    \ should\n           omit them only if the omission is justified by some special\n\
    \           circumstance.\n      (c)  Elective:  Implementation of the referenced\
    \ TS is optional\n           within the domain of applicability of the AS; that\
    \ is, the AS\n           creates no explicit necessity to apply the TS.  However,\
    \ a\n           particular vendor may decide to implement it, or a particular\n\
    \           user may decide that it is a necessity in a specific\n           environment.\n\
    \      As noted in Section 2.4, there are TSs that are not in the\n      standards\
    \ track or that have been retired from the standards\n      track, and are therefore\
    \ not required, recommended, or elective.\n      Two additional \"requirement\
    \ level\" designations are available for\n      such TSs:\n      (d)  Limited\
    \ Use:  The TS is considered appropriate for use only\n           in limited or\
    \ unique circumstances.  For example, the usage\n           of a protocol with\
    \ the \"Experimental\" designation should\n           generally be limited to\
    \ those actively involved with the\n           experiment.\n      (e)  Not Recommended:\
    \  A TS that is considered to be inappropriate\n           for general use is\
    \ labeled \"Not Recommended\".  This may be\n           because of its limited\
    \ functionality, specialized nature, or\n           historic status.\n      The\
    \ \"Official Protocol Standards\" RFC lists a general requirement\n      level\
    \ for each TS, using the nomenclature defined in this section.\n      In many\
    \ cases, more detailed descriptions of the requirement\n      levels of particular\
    \ protocols and of individual features of the\n      protocols will be found in\
    \ appropriate ASs.\n"

    \      3.1.1  Initiation of Action\n         Typically, a standards action is\
    \ initiated by a recommendation\n         to the appropriate IETF Area Director\
    \ by the individual or\n         group that is responsible for the specification,\
    \ usually an\n         IETF Working Group.\n         After completion to the satisfaction\
    \ of its author and the\n         cognizant Working Group, a document that is\
    \ expected to enter\n         or advance in the Internet standardization process\
    \ shall be\n         made available as an Internet Draft.  It shall remain as\
    \ an\n         Internet Draft for a period of time that permits useful\n     \
    \    community review, at least two weeks, before submission to the\n        \
    \ IESG with a recommendation for action.\n      3.1.2  IESG Review and Approval\n\
    \         The IESG shall determine whether a specification satisfies the\n   \
    \      applicable criteria for the recommended action (see Sections\n        \
    \ 3.2 and 3.3 of this document).\n         The IESG shall determine if an independent\
    \ technical review of\n         the specification is required, and shall commission\
    \ one when\n         necessary.  This may require creating a new Working Group,\
    \ or\n         an existing group may agree to take responsibility for\n      \
    \   reviewing the specification.  When a specification is\n         sufficiently\
    \ important in terms of its potential impact on the\n         Internet or on the\
    \ suite of Internet protocols, the IESG shall\n         form an independent technical\
    \ review and analysis committee to\n         prepare an evaluation of the specification.\
    \  Such a committee\n         is commissioned to provide an objective basis for\
    \ agreement\n         within the Internet community that the specification is\
    \ ready\n         for advancement.\n         The IESG shall communicate its findings\
    \ to the IETF to permit a\n         final review by the general Internet community.\
    \  This \"last-\n         call\" notification shall be via electronic mail to\
    \ the IETF\n         mailing list.  In addition, for important specifications\
    \ there\n         shall be a presentation or statement by the appropriate Working\n\
    \         Group or Area Director during an IETF plenary meeting.  Any\n      \
    \   significant issues that have not been resolved satisfactorily\n         during\
    \ the development of the specification may be raised at\n         this time for\
    \ final resolution by the IESG.\n         In a timely fashion, but no sooner than\
    \ two weeks after issuing\n         the last-call notification to the IETF mailing\
    \ list, the IESG\n         shall make its final determination on whether or not\
    \ to approve\n         the standards action, and shall notify the IETF of its\
    \ decision\n         via email.\n      3.1.3  Publication\n         Following\
    \ IESG approval and any necessary editorial work, the\n         RFC Editor shall\
    \ publish the specification as an RFC.  The\n         specification shall then\
    \ be removed from the Internet Drafts\n         directory.\n         An official\
    \ summary of standards actions completed and pending\n         shall appear in\
    \ each issue of the Internet Society Newsletter.\n         This shall constitute\
    \ the \"journal of record\" for Internet\n         standards actions.  In addition,\
    \ the IESG shall publish a\n         monthly summary of standards actions completed\
    \ and pending in\n         the Internet Monthly Report, which is distributed to\
    \ all\n         members of the IETF mailing list.\n         Finally, the IAB shall\
    \ publish quarterly an \"Internet Official\n         Protocol Standards\" RFC,\
    \ summarizing the status of all Internet\n         protocol and service specifications,\
    \ both within and outside\n         the standards track.\n   3.2  Entering the\
    \ Standards Track\n      A specification that is potentially an Internet Standard\
    \ may\n      originate from:\n      (a)  an ISOC-sponsored effort (typically an\
    \ IETF Working Group),\n      (b)  independent activity by individuals, or\n \
    \     (c)  an external organization.\n      Case (a) accounts for the great majority\
    \ of specifications that\n      enter the standards track.  In cases (b) and (c),\
    \ the work might\n      be tightly integrated with the work of an existing IETF\
    \ Working\n      Group, or it might be offered for standardization without prior\n\
    \      IETF involvement.  In most cases, a specification resulting from\n    \
    \  an effort that took place outside of an IETF Working Group will be\n      submitted\
    \ to an appropriate Working Group for evaluation and\n      refinement.  If necessary,\
    \ an appropriate Working Group will be\n      created.\n      For externally-developed\
    \ specifications that are well-integrated\n      with existing Working Group efforts,\
    \ a Working Group is assumed to\n      afford adequate community review of the\
    \ accuracy and applicability\n      of the specification.  If a Working Group\
    \ is unable to resolve all\n      technical and usage questions, additional independent\
    \ review may\n      be necessary.  Such reviews may be done within a Working Group\n\
    \      context, or by an ad hoc review committee established specifically\n  \
    \    for that purpose.  Ad hoc review committees may also be convened\n      in\
    \ other circumstances when the nature of review required is too\n      small to\
    \ require the formality of Working Group creation.  It is\n      the responsibility\
    \ of the appropriate IETF Area Director to\n      determine what, if any, review\
    \ of an external specification is\n      needed and how it shall be conducted.\n\
    \   3.3  Advancing in the Standards Track\n      A specification shall remain\
    \ at the Proposed Standard level for at\n      least six (6) months.\n      A\
    \ specification shall remain at the Draft Standard level for at\n      least four\
    \ (4) months, or until at least one IETF meeting has\n      occurred, whichever\
    \ comes later.\n      These minimum periods are intended to ensure adequate opportunity\n\
    \      for community review without severely impacting timeliness.  These\n  \
    \    intervals shall be measured from the date of publication of the\n      corresponding\
    \ RFC(s), or, if the action does not result in RFC\n      publication, the date\
    \ of IESG approval of the action.\n      A specification may be (indeed, is likely\
    \ to be) revised as it\n      advances through the standards track.  At each stage,\
    \ the IESG\n      shall determine the scope and significance of the revision to\
    \ the\n      specification, and, if necessary and appropriate, modify the\n  \
    \    recommended action.  Minor revisions are expected, but a\n      significant\
    \ revision may require that the specification accumulate\n      more experience\
    \ at its current maturity level before progressing.\n      Finally, if the specification\
    \ has been changed very significantly,\n      the IESG may recommend that the\
    \ revision be treated as a new\n      document, re-entering the standards track\
    \ at the beginning.\n      Change of status shall result in republication of the\n\
    \      specification as an RFC, except in the rare case that there have\n    \
    \  been no changes at all in the specification since the last\n      publication.\
    \  Generally, desired changes will be \"batched\" for\n      incorporation at\
    \ the next level in the standards track.  However,\n      deferral of changes\
    \ to the next standards action on the\n      specification will not always be\
    \ possible or desirable; for\n      example, an important typographical error,\
    \ or a technical error\n      that does not represent a change in overall function\
    \ of the\n      specification, may need to be corrected immediately.  In such\n\
    \      cases, the IESG or RFC Editor may be asked to republish the RFC\n     \
    \ with corrections, and this will not reset the minimum time-at-\n      level\
    \ clock.\n      When a standards-track specification has not reached the Internet\n\
    \      Standard level but has remained at the same status level for\n      twenty-four\
    \ (24) months, and every twelve (12) months thereafter\n      until the status\
    \ is changed, the IESG shall review the viability\n      of the standardization\
    \ effort responsible for that specification.\n      Following each such review,\
    \ the IESG shall approve termination or\n      continuation of the development.\
    \ This decision shall be\n      communicated to the IETF via electronic mail to\
    \ the IETF mailing\n      list, to allow the Internet community an opportunity\
    \ to comment.\n      This provision is not intended to threaten a legitimate and\
    \ active\n      Working Group effort, but rather to provide an administrative\n\
    \      mechanism for terminating a moribund effort.\n   3.4  Revising a Standard\n\
    \      A new version of an established Internet Standard must progress\n     \
    \ through the full Internet standardization process as if it were a\n      completely\
    \ new specification.  Once the new version has reached\n      the Standard level,\
    \ it will usually replace the previous version,\n      which will move to Historic\
    \ status.  However, in some cases both\n      versions may remain as Internet\
    \ Standards to honor the\n      requirements of an installed base.  In this situation,\
    \ the\n      relationship between the previous and the new versions must be\n\
    \      explicitly stated in the text of the new version or in another\n      appropriate\
    \ document (e.g., an Applicability Statement; see\n      Section 2.2.2).\n   3.5\
    \  Retiring a Standard\n      As the technology changes and matures, it is possible\
    \ for a new\n      Standard specification to be so clearly superior technically\
    \ that\n      one or more existing Internet Standards for the same function\n\
    \      should be retired.  In this case, the IESG shall approve a change\n   \
    \   of status of the superseded specification(s) from Standard to\n      Historic.\
    \  This recommendation shall be issued with the same\n      Last-Call and notification\
    \ procedures used for any other standards\n      action.\n   3.6  Conflict Resolution\
    \ and Appeals\n      IETF Working Groups are generally able to reach consensus,\
    \ which\n      sometimes requires difficult compromises between differing\n  \
    \    technical solutions.  However, there are times when even\n      reasonable\
    \ and knowledgeable people are unable to agree.  To\n      achieve the goals of\
    \ openness and fairness, such conflicts must be\n      resolved with a process\
    \ of open review and discussion.\n      Participants in a Working Group may disagree\
    \ with Working Group\n      decisions, based either upon the belief that their\
    \ own views are\n      not being adequately considered or the belief that the\
    \ Working\n      Group made a technical choice which essentially will not work.\n\
    \      The first issue is a difficulty with Working Group process, and\n     \
    \ the latter is an assertion of technical error.  These two kinds of\n      disagreements\
    \ may have different kinds of final outcome, but the\n      resolution process\
    \ is the same for both cases.\n      Working Group participants always should\
    \ first attempt to discuss\n      their concerns with the Working Group chair.\
    \  If this proves\n      unsatisfactory, they should raise their concerns with\
    \ an IESG Area\n      Director or other IESG member.  In most cases, issues raised\
    \ to\n      the level of the IESG will receive consideration by the entire\n \
    \     IESG, with the relevant Area Director or the IETF Chair being\n      tasked\
    \ with communicating results of the discussion.\n      For the general community\
    \ as well as Working Group participants\n      seeking a larger audience for their\
    \ concerns, there are two\n      opportunities for explicit comment.  (1) When\
    \ appropriate, a\n      specification that is being suggested for advancement\
    \ along the\n      standards track will be presented during an IETF plenary. \
    \ At that\n      time, IETF participants may choose to raise issues with the\n\
    \      plenary or to pursue their issues privately, with any of the\n      relevant\
    \ IETF/IESG management personnel.  (2) Specifications that\n      are to be considered\
    \ by the IESG are publicly announced to the\n      IETF mailing list, with a request\
    \ for comments.\n      Finally, if a problem persists, the IAB may be asked to\
    \ adjudicate\n      the dispute.\n      *    If a concern involves questions of\
    \ adequate Working Group\n           discussion, the IAB will attempt to determine\
    \ the actual\n           nature and extent of discussion that took place within\
    \ the\n           Working Group, based upon the Working Group's written record\n\
    \           and upon comments of other Working Group participants.\n      *  \
    \  If a concern involves questions of technical adequacy, the\n           IAB\
    \ may convene an appropriate review panel, which may then\n           recommend\
    \ that the IESG and Working Group re-consider an\n           alternate technical\
    \ choice.\n      *    If a concern involves a reasonable difference in technical\n\
    \           approach, but does not substantiate a claim that the Working\n   \
    \        Group decision will fail to perform adequately, the Working\n       \
    \    Group participant may wish to pursue formation of a separate\n          \
    \ Working Group.  The IESG and IAB encourage alternative points\n           of\
    \ view and the development of technical options, allowing\n           the general\
    \ Internet community to show preference by making\n           its own choices,\
    \ rather than by having legislated decisions.\n"
- title: 4.  EXTERNAL STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
  contents:
  - "4.  EXTERNAL STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS\n   Many standards groups other than\
    \ the IETF create and publish\n   standards documents for network protocols and\
    \ services.  When these\n   external specifications play an important role in\
    \ the Internet, it is\n   desirable to reach common agreements on their usage\
    \ -- i.e., to\n   establish Internet Standards relating to these external\n  \
    \ specifications.\n   There are two categories of external specifications:\n \
    \  (1)  Open Standards\n        Accredited national and international standards\
    \ bodies, such as\n        ANSI, ISO, IEEE, and ITU-TS, develop a variety of protocol\
    \ and\n        service specifications that are similar to Technical\n        Specifications\
    \ defined here.  National and international groups\n        also publish \"implementors'\
    \ agreements\" that are analogous to\n        Applicability Statements, capturing\
    \ a body of implementation-\n        specific detail concerned with the practical\
    \ application of\n        their standards.\n   (2)  Vendor Specifications\n  \
    \      A vendor-proprietary specification that has come to be widely\n       \
    \ used in the Internet may be treated by the Internet community as\n        if\
    \ it were a \"standard\".  Such a specification is not generally\n        developed\
    \ in an open fashion, is typically proprietary, and is\n        controlled by\
    \ the vendor or vendors that produced it.\n   To avoid conflict between competing\
    \ versions of a specification, the\n   Internet community will not standardize\
    \ a TS or AS that is simply an\n   \"Internet version\" of an existing external\
    \ specification unless an\n   explicit cooperative arrangement to do so has been\
    \ made.  However,\n   there are several ways in which an external specification\
    \ that is\n   important for the operation and/or evolution of the Internet may\
    \ be\n   adopted for Internet use.\n   (a)  Incorporation of an Open Standard\n\
    \        An Internet Standard TS or AS may incorporate an open external\n    \
    \    standard by reference.  The reference must be to a specific\n        version\
    \ of the external standard, e.g., by publication date or\n        by edition number,\
    \ according to the prevailing convention of the\n        organization that is\
    \ responsible for the specification.\n        For example, many Internet Standards\
    \ incorporate by reference\n        the ANSI standard character set \"ASCII\"\
    \ [2].  Whenever possible,\n        the referenced specification shall be made\
    \ available online.\n   (b)  Incorporation of a Vendor Specification\n       \
    \ Vendor-proprietary specifications may be incorporated by\n        reference\
    \ to a specific version of the vendor standard.  If the\n        vendor-proprietary\
    \ specification is not widely and readily\n        available, the IESG may request\
    \ that it be published as an\n        Informational RFC.\n        For a vendor-proprietary\
    \ specification to be incorporated within\n        the Internet standards process,\
    \ the proprietor must meet the\n        requirements of section 5 below, and in\
    \ general the\n        specification shall be made available online.\n       \
    \ The IESG shall not favor a particular vendor's proprietary\n        specification\
    \ over the technically equivalent and competing\n        specifications of other\
    \ vendors by making it \"required\" or\n        \"recommended\".\n   (c)  Assumption\n\
    \        An IETF Working Group may start from an external specification\n    \
    \    and develop it into an Internet TS or AS.  This is acceptable if\n      \
    \  (1) the specification is provided to the Working Group in\n        compliance\
    \ with the requirements of section 5 below, and (2)\n        change control has\
    \ been conveyed to IETF by the original\n        developer of the specification.\
    \  Continued participation in the\n        IETF work by the original owner is\
    \ likely to be valuable, and is\n        encouraged.\n   The following sample\
    \ text illustrates how a vendor might convey\n   change control to the Internet\
    \ Society:\n        \"XXXX Organization asserts that it has the right to transfer\
    \ to\n        the Internet Society responsibility for further evolution of the\n\
    \        YYYY protocol documented in References (1-n) below.  XXXX\n        Organization\
    \ hereby transfers to the Internet Society\n        responsibility for all future\
    \ modification and development of\n        the YYYY protocol, without reservation\
    \ or condition.\"\n"

    \           This is an agreement between ______________(hereinafter\n      called\
    \ \"Rights Holder\") and the Internet Society on behalf of\n      itself and its\
    \ trustees, officers, employees, contractors and\n      agents, the Internet Architecture\

    \ and\n      use Internet Standards (hereinafter together with ISOC called\n \
    \     \"Internet community\").  This agreement takes effect when signed on\n \
    \     behalf of the Rights Holder and the Internet Society.\n           The Rights\
    \ Holder represents that it has or will have rights\n      in patent applications,\
    \ patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and\n      other proprietary rights in various\
    \ countries (hereinafter called\n      \"Rights\") which may block or impede the\
    \ ability of the Internet\n      community to implement and operate under the\
    \ standards set forth\n      in ISOC standards document ____,____, and ____(the\
    \ listed\n      standards and any similar or related standards now existing or\n\
    \      later developed are together hereinafter called \"Standards\").  The\n\
    \      Rights as they presently exist are listed on attached Schedule A.\n   \
    \   The Rights Holder further agrees to review the Rights listed in\n      Schedule\
    \ A from time to time, and, in particular, immediately\n      prior to the elevation\
    \ of the Standards to the Internet Standard\n      level of maturity in accordance\
    \ with the Internet Standards\n      Process, and to inform the Executive Director\
    \ of the Internet\n      Engineering Task Force Secretariat promptly upon learning\
    \ of any\n      new Rights in the Standards that should be added to the list in\n\
    \      Schedule A.\n           The Rights Holder believes and affirms that it\
    \ will derive\n      benefits by permitting ISOC and the Internet community to\n\
    \      implement and operate under the Standards without interference of\n   \
    \   any of the Rights.  The policy of ISOC is not to propose, adopt,\n      or\
    \ continue to maintain the Standards unless written assurances\n      are given\
    \ by the Rights Holder with respect to proprietary rights.\n      Accordingly,\
    \ in consideration of the benefits noted above and\n      other good and valuable\
    \ consideration, the Rights Holder makes the\n      assurances set forth herein.\n\
    \           The Rights Holder grants to ISOC a cost-free, perpetual,\n      non-exclusive,\
    \ world-wide license under the Rights with respect to\n      implementing and\
    \ operating under the Standards.  The license\n      extends to all activities\
    \ of ISOC involving the Standards without\n      limit, including the rights to\
    \ reproduce, distribute, propose,\n      test, develop, analyze, enhance, revise,\
    \ adopt, maintain,\n      withdraw, perform and display publicly, and prepare\
    \ derivative\n      works in any form whatsoever and in all languages, and to\n\
    \      authorize others to do so.  The Rights Holder also grants ISOC\n      permission\
    \ to use the name and address of Rights Holder in\n      connection with the Standards.\n\
    \           The Rights Holder relinquishes any right or claim in any\n      trade\
    \ secret which is part of the Rights, and makes the trade\n      secrets available\
    \ without restriction to the Internet community.\n      The Rights Holder hereby\
    \ acknowledges that ISOC assumes no\n      obligation to maintain any confidentiality\
    \ with respect to any\n      aspect of the Standards, and warrants that the Standards\
    \ do not\n      violate the rights of others.\n           The Rights Holder assures\
    \ ISOC that the Rights Holder shall\n      grant to any member of the Internet\
    \ community, as a beneficiary of\n      this agreement, a non-exclusive, perpetual,\
    \ world-wide license\n      under the Rights, with respect to operating under\
    \ the Standards\n      for a reasonable royalty and under other terms which are\n\
    \      reasonable considering the objective of ISOC to assure that all\n     \
    \ members of the Internet community will be able to operate under\n      the Standards\
    \ at a minimal cost.  The license discussed in this\n      paragraph shall permit\
    \ the licensee to make, have made, test,\n      enhance, implement, and use methods,\
    \ works, computer programs, and\n      hardware as needed or desirable for operating\
    \ under the Standards.\n      Every license shall include a clause automatically\
    \ modifying the\n      terms of the license to be as favorable as the terms of\
    \ any other\n      license under the Rights previously or later granted by the\
    \ Rights\n      Holder.\n           A form of the license shall always be publicly\
    \ accessible on\n      the Internet, and shall become effective immediately when\
    \ the\n      member of the Internet community executes it and posts it for\n \
    \     delivery to the Rights Holder either by mail or electronically.\n      The\
    \ initial version of the license shall be in the form attached\n      as Schedule\
    \ B.\n           The Rights Holder represents and warrants that its rights are\n\
    \      sufficient to permit it to grant the licenses and give the other\n    \
    \  assurances recited in this agreement.  The Rights Holder further\n      represents\
    \ and warrants that it does not know of any rights of any\n      other party in\
    \ any country which would block or impede the ability\n      of ISOC and the Internet\
    \ community to implement or operate under\n      the Standards, or that would\
    \ prevent the Rights Holder from\n      granting the licenses and other assurances\
    \ in this agreement.\n           This agreement shall not be construed to obligate\
    \ the ISOC to\n      propose, adopt, develop, or maintain any of the Standards\
    \ or any\n      other standard.\n"

  - "o    Policy Recommendations and Operational Guidelines\n     Internet standards\
    \ have generally been concerned with the technical\n     specifications for hardware\
    \ and software required for computer\n     communication across interconnected\
    \ networks.  The Internet itself\n     is composed of networks operated by a great\
    \ variety of\n     organizations, with diverse goals and rules.  However, good\
    \ user\n     service requires that the operators and administrators of the\n \
    \    Internet follow some common guidelines for policies and operations.\n   \
    \  While these guidelines are generally different in scope and style\n     from\
    \ protocol standards, their establishment needs a similar\n     process for consensus\
    \ building.  Specific rules for establishing\n     policy recommendations and\
    \ operational guidelines for the Internet\n     in an open and fair fashion should\
    \ be developed, published, and\n     adopted by the Internet community.\n"

  - "o    Industry Consortia\n     The rules presented in Section 4 for external standards\
    \ should be\n     expanded to handle industry consortia.\n"
- title: o    Tracking Procedure
  contents:
  - "o    Tracking Procedure\n     It has been suggested that there should be a formal\
    \ procedure for\n     tracking problems and change requests as a specification\
    \ moves\n     through the standards track.  Such a procedure might include\n \
    \    written responses, which were cataloged and disseminated, or simply\n   \
    \  a database that listed changes between versions.  At the present\n     time,\
    \ there are not sufficient resources to administer such a\n     procedure.\n \
    \    A simpler proposal is to keep a change log for documents.\n"
- title: o    Time Limit
  contents:
  - "o    Time Limit\n     An explicit time limit (e.g., 3 months) has been suggested\
    \ for IESG\n     resolution concerning a standards action under the rules of Section\n\
    \     3.1.2.  If it were necessary to extend the time for some reason,\n     the\
    \ IETF would have to be explicitly notified.\n"
- title: o    Bug Reporting
  contents:
  - "o    Bug Reporting\n     There is no documented mechanism for an individual community\
    \ member\n     to use to report a problem or bug with a standards-track\n    \
    \ specification.  One suggestion was that every standards RFC should\n     include\
    \ an email list for the responsible Working Group.\n"
