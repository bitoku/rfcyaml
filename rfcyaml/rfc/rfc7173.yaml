- contents:
  - "2.  PWE3 Interconnection of TRILL Switches\n   When a pseudowire is used to interconnect
    a pair of TRILL switch\n   ports, a PPP [RFC4618] pseudowire is used as described
    below.  The\n   pseudowire between such ports can be signaled [RFC4447] or manually\n
    \  configured.  In this context, the TRILL switch ports at the ends of\n   the
    pseudowire are acting as native service processing (NSP) elements\n   [RFC3985]
    and, assuming that the pseudowires are over MPLS or IP\n   [RFC4023] networks,
    as label switched or IP routers at the TRILL\n   switch ports.\n   Pseudowires
    provide transparent transport, and the two TRILL switch\n   ports appear directly
    interconnected with a transparent link.  With\n   such an interconnection, the
    TRILL adjacency over the link is\n   automatically discovered and established
    through TRILL IS-IS control\n   messages [RFC7177].\n   A pseudowire is carried
    over a packet switched network tunnel\n   [RFC3985], for example, an MPLS or MPLS-TP
    label switched path tunnel\n   in MPLS networks.  Either a signaling protocol
    or manual\n   configuration can be used to configure a label switched path tunnel\n
    \  between two TRILL switch ports.  This application needs no additions\n   to
    the existing pseudowire standards.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  PWE3 Type-Independent Details\n   The sending pseudowire TRILL switch
      port SHOULD map the inner\n   priority of the TRILL Data packets being sent
      to the Traffic Class\n   field of the pseudowire label [RFC5462] so as to minimize
      the\n   probability that higher priority TRILL Data packets will be discarded\n
      \  due to excessive TRILL Data packets of lower priority.\n   TRILL IS-IS PDUs
      critical to establishing and maintaining adjacency\n   (Hello and MTU PDUs)
      SHOULD be sent with the MPLS Traffic Class that\n   calls for handling with
      the maximum priority.  Other TRILL IS-IS PDUs\n   SHOULD be sent with the MPLS
      Traffic Class denoting the highest\n   priority that is less than the maximum
      priority.  TRILL Data packets\n   SHOULD be sent with appropriate MPLS Traffic
      Classes, typically\n   mapped from the TRILL Data packet priority, such that
      TRILL Data\n   packet Traffic Classes denote priorities less than the priorities\n
      \  used for TRILL IS-IS PDUs.  This minimizes the probability of other\n   traffic
      interfering with these important control PDUs and causing\n   false loss of
      adjacency or other control problems.\n   If a pseudowire supports fragmentation
      and reassembly (a feature that\n   has received little or no deployment), then
      there is no reason to do\n   TRILL MTU testing on it, and the pseudowire will
      not be a constraint\n   on the TRILL campus-wide MTU size (Sz) (see Section
      4.3.1 of\n   [RFC6325]).  If the pseudowire does not support fragmentation (the\n
      \  more common case), then the available TRILL IS-IS packet payload size\n   over
      the pseudowire (taking into account MPLS encapsulation with a\n   control word)
      or some lower value, MUST be used in helping to\n   determine MTU size (Sz)
      (see Section 5 of [RFC7180]).\n   An intervening MPLS label switched router
      or similar packet switched\n   network device has no awareness of TRILL.  Such
      devices will not\n   change the TRILL Header hop count.\n"

    - "2.2.  PPP PWE3 Transport of TRILL\n   For a PPP pseudowire (PW type = 0x0007),
      the two TRILL switch ports\n   being connected are configured to form a pseudowire
      with PPP\n   encapsulation [RFC4618].  After the pseudowire is established and\n
      \  TRILL use is negotiated within PPP, the two TRILL switch ports appear\n   directly
      connected with a PPP link [RFC1661] [RFC6361].\n   If pseudowire interconnection
      of two TRILL switch ports is signaled\n   [RFC4447], the initiating TRILL switch
      port MUST attempt the\n   connection setup with pseudowire type PPP (0x0007).\n
      \  Behavior for TRILL with a PPP pseudowire continues to follow that of\n   TRILL
      over PPP as specified in Section 3 of [RFC6361].\n   The following figures show

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   TRILL-level security mechanisms, such as the
    ability to use\n   authentication with TRILL IS-IS PDUs [RFC6325], are not affected
    by\n   link technology, such as the use of pseudowire links as specified in\n
    \  this document.\n   Link security may be useful in improving TRILL campus security.\n
    \  TRILL is transported over pseudowires as TRILL over PPP over\n   pseudowires,
    pseudowires are over MPLS or IP, and MPLS and IP are\n   over some lower-level
    link technology.  Thus, link security below the\n   TRILL level for a pseudowire
    link could be provided by PPP security,\n   pseudowire security, MPLS or IP security,
    or security of the link\n   technology supporting MPLS or IP.\n   PPP TRILL security
    considerations are discussed in [RFC6361].  For\n   security considerations introduced
    by carrying PPP TRILL links over\n   pseudowires, see [RFC3985], which discusses
    the risks introduced by\n   sending protocols that previously assumed a point-to-point
    link on a\n   pseudowire built on a packet switched network (PSN).  However, the\n
    \  PPP layer in TRILL transport by pseudowire is somewhat vestigial and\n   intended
    primarily as a convenient way to use existing PPP code\n   points to identify
    TRILL Data packets and TRILL IS-IS packets.\n   Furthermore, existing PPP security
    standards are arguably\n   questionable in terms of current security criteria.
    \ For these\n   reasons, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use PPP security in the transport\n
    \  of TRILL by pseudowires as specified in this document.\n   It is RECOMMENDED
    that link security be provided at the layers\n   supporting pseudowires transporting
    TRILL, that is, at the MPLS or IP\n   layer or the link layer transporting MPLS
    or IP.\n   For applications involving sensitive data, end-to-end security should\n
    \  always be considered, in addition to link security, to provide\n   security
    in depth.  In this context, such end-to-end security should\n   be between the
    end stations involved so as to protect the entire path\n   to, through, and from
    the TRILL campus.\n   For general TRILL protocol security considerations, see
    [RFC6325].\n"
