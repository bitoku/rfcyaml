  - "1.  Introduction\n   Measuring the capacity of a link or network path is a task\
    \ that\n   sounds simple, but in reality can be quite complex.  Any physical\n\
    \   medium requires that information be encoded and, depending on the\n   medium,\
    \ there are various schemes to convert information into a\n   sequence of signals\
    \ that are transmitted physically from one location\n   to another.\n   While\
    \ on some media, the maximum frequency of these signals can be\n   thought of\
    \ as \"capacity\", on other media, the signal transmission\n   frequency and the\
    \ information capacity of the medium (channel) may be\n   quite different.  For\
    \ example, a satellite channel may have a carrier\n   frequency of a few gigahertz,\
    \ but an information-carrying capacity of\n   only a few hundred kilobits per\
    \ second.  Often similar or identical\n   terms are used to refer to these different\
    \ applications of capacity,\n   adding to the ambiguity and confusion, and the\
    \ lack of a unified\n   nomenclature makes it difficult to properly build, test,\
    \ and use\n   various techniques and tools.\n   We are interested in information-carrying\
    \ capacity, but even this is\n   not straightforward.  Each of the layers, depending\
    \ on the medium,\n   adds overhead to the task of carrying information.  The wired\n\
    \   Ethernet uses Manchester coding or 4/5 coding, which cuts down\n   considerably\
    \ on the \"theoretical\" capacity.  Similarly, RF (radio\n   frequency) communications\
    \ will often add redundancy to the coding\n   scheme to implement forward error\
    \ correction because the physical\n   medium (air) is lossy.  This can further\
    \ decrease the information\n   capacity.\n   In addition to coding schemes, usually\
    \ the physical layer and the\n   link layer add framing bits for multiplexing\
    \ and control purposes.\n   For example, on SONET there is physical-layer framing\
    \ and typically\n   also some layer-2 framing such as High-Level Data Link Control\n\
    \   (HDLC), PPP, or ATM.\n   Aside from questions of coding efficiency, there\
    \ are issues of how\n   access to the channel is controlled, which also may affect\
    \ the\n   capacity.  For example, a multiple-access medium with collision\n  \
    \ detection, avoidance, and recovery mechanisms has a varying capacity\n   from\
    \ the point of view of the users.  This varying capacity depends\n   upon the\
    \ total number of users contending for the medium, how busy\n   the users are,\
    \ and bounds resulting from the mechanisms themselves.\n   RF channels may also\
    \ vary in capacity, depending on range,\n   environmental conditions, mobility,\
    \ shadowing, etc.\n   The important points to derive from this discussion are\
    \ these: First,\n   capacity is only meaningful when defined relative to a given\
    \ protocol\n   layer in the network.  It is meaningless to speak of \"link\" capacity\n\
    \   without qualifying exactly what is meant.  Second, capacity is not\n   necessarily\
    \ fixed, and consequently, a single measure of capacity at\n   any layer may in\
    \ fact provide a skewed picture (either optimistic or\n   pessimistic) of what\
    \ is actually available.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   In this section, we specify definitions for capacity.  We\
    \ begin by\n   first defining \"link\" and \"path\" clearly, and then we define\
    \ a\n   baseline capacity that is simply tied to the physical properties of\n\
    \   the link.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Links and Paths
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Links and Paths\n   To define capacity, we need to broaden the notions\
    \ of link and path\n   found in the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework document\n\
    \   [RFC2330] to include network devices that can impact IP capacity\n   without\
    \ being IP aware.  For example, consider an Ethernet switch\n   that can operate\
    \ ports at different speeds.\n   We define nodes as hosts, routers, Ethernet switches,\
    \ or any other\n   device where the input and output links can have different\n\
    \   characteristics.  A link is a connection between two of these network\n  \
    \ devices or nodes.  We then define a path P of length n as a series of\n   links\
    \ (L1, L2, ..., Ln) connecting a sequence of nodes (N1, N2, ...,\n   Nn+1).  A\
    \ source S and destination D reside at N1 and Nn+1,\n   respectively.  Furthermore,\
    \ we define a link L as a special case\n   where the path length is one.\n"
- title: '2.2.  Definition: Nominal Physical Link Capacity'
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Definition: Nominal Physical Link Capacity\n   Nominal Physical Link Capacity,\
    \ NomCap(L), is the theoretical maximum\n   amount of data that the link L can\
    \ support.  For example, an OC-3\n   link would be capable of 155.520 Mbit/s.\
    \  We stress that this is a\n   measurement at the physical layer and not the\
    \ network IP layer, which\n   we will define separately.  While NomCap(L) is typically\
    \ constant\n   over time, there are links whose characteristics may allow otherwise,\n\
    \   such as the dynamic activation of additional transponders for a\n   satellite\
    \ link.\n   The nominal physical link capacity is provided as a means to help\n\
    \   distinguish between the commonly used link-layer capacities and the\n   remaining\
    \ definitions for IP-layer capacity.  As a result, the value\n   of NomCap(L)\
    \ does not influence the other definitions presented in\n   this document.  Instead,\
    \ it provides an upper bound on those values.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Capacity at the IP Layer
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Capacity at the IP Layer\n   There are many factors that can reduce the\
    \ IP information carrying\n   capacity of the link, some of which have already\
    \ been discussed in\n   the introduction.  However, the goal of this document\
    \ is not to\n   become an exhaustive list of such factors.  Rather, we outline\
    \ some\n   of the major examples in the following section, thus providing food\n\
    \   for thought to those implementing the algorithms or tools that\n   attempt\
    \ to measure capacity accurately.\n   The remaining definitions are all given\
    \ in terms of \"IP-layer bits\"\n   in order to distinguish these definitions\
    \ from the nominal physical\n   capacity of the link.\n"
- title: '2.3.1.  Definition: IP-layer Bits'
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Definition: IP-layer Bits\n   IP-layer bits are defined as eight (8)\
    \ times the number of octets in\n   all IP packets received, from the first octet\
    \ of the IP header to the\n   last octet of the IP packet payload, inclusive.\n\
    \   IP-layer bits are recorded at the destination D beginning at time T\n   and\
    \ ending at a time T+I.  Since the definitions are based on\n   averages, the\
    \ two time parameters, T and I, must accompany any report\n   or estimate of the\
    \ following values in order for them to remain\n   meaningful.  It is not required\
    \ that the interval boundary points\n   fall between packet arrivals at D.  However,\
    \ boundaries that fall\n   within a packet will invalidate the packets on which\
    \ they fall.\n   Specifically, the data from the partial packet that is contained\n\
    \   within the interval will not be counted.  This may artificially bias\n   some\
    \ of the values, depending on the length of the interval and the\n   amount of\
    \ data received during that interval.  We elaborate on what\n   constitutes correctly\
    \ received data in the next section.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.1.  Standard or Correctly Formed Packets
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.1.  Standard or Correctly Formed Packets\n   The definitions in this document\
    \ specify that IP packets must be\n   received correctly.  The IPPM framework\
    \ recommends a set of criteria\n   for such standard-formed packets in Section\
    \ 15 of [RFC2330].\n   However, it is inadequate for use with this document. \
    \ Thus, we\n   outline our own criteria below while pointing out any variations\
    \ or\n   similarities to [RFC2330].\n   First, data that is in error at layers\
    \ below IP and cannot be\n   properly passed to the IP layer must not be counted.\
    \  For example,\n   wireless media often have a considerably larger error rate\
    \ than wired\n   media, resulting in a reduction in IP link capacity.  In accordance\n\
    \   with the IPPM framework, packets that fail validation of the IP\n   header\
    \ must be discarded.  Specifically, the requirements in\n   [RFC1812], Section\
    \ 5.2.2, on IP header validation must be checked,\n   which includes a valid length,\
    \ checksum, and version field.\n   The IPPM framework specifies further restrictions,\
    \ requiring that any\n   transport header be checked for correctness and that\
    \ any packets with\n   IP options be ignored.  However, the definitions in this\
    \ document are\n   concerned with the traversal of IP-layer bits.  As a result,\
    \ data\n   from the higher layers is not required to be valid or understood as\n\
    \   that data is simply regarded as part of the IP packet.  The same\n   holds\
    \ true for IP options.  Valid IP fragments must also be counted\n   as they expend\
    \ the resources of a link even though assembly of the\n   full packet may not\
    \ be possible.  The IPPM framework differs in this\n   area, discarding IP fragments.\n\
    \   For a discussion of duplicates, please see Section 3.2.\n   In summary, any\
    \ IP packet that can be properly processed must be\n   included in these calculations.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.2.  Type P Packets
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.2.  Type P Packets\n   The definitions in this document refer to \"Type\
    \ P\" packets to\n   designate a particular type of flow or sets of flows.  As\
    \ defined in\n   RFC 2330, Section 13, \"Type P\" is a placeholder for what may\
    \ be an\n   explicit specification of the packet flows referenced by the metric,\n\
    \   or it may be a very loose specification encompassing aggregates.  We\n   use\
    \ the \"Type P\" designation in these definitions in order to\n   emphasize two\
    \ things: First, that the value of the capacity\n   measurement depends on the\
    \ types of flows referenced in the\n   definition.  This is because networks may\
    \ treat packets differently\n   (in terms of queuing and scheduling) based on\
    \ their markings and\n   classification.  Networks may also arbitrarily decide\
    \ to flow-balance\n   based on the packet type or flow type and thereby affect\
    \ capacity\n   measurements.  Second, the measurement of capacity depends not\
    \ only\n   on the type of the reference packets, but also on the types of the\n\
    \   packets in the \"population\" with which the flows of interest share\n   the\
    \ links in the path.\n   All of this indicates two different approaches to measuring:\
    \ One is\n   to measure capacity using a broad spectrum of packet types,\n   suggesting\
    \ that \"Type P\" should be set as generic as possible.  The\n   second is to\
    \ focus narrowly on the types of flows of particular\n   interest, which suggests\
    \ that \"Type P\" should be very specific and\n   narrowly defined.  The first\
    \ approach is likely to be of interest to\n   providers, the second to application\
    \ users.\n   As a practical matter, it should be noted that some providers may\n\
    \   treat packets with certain characteristics differently than other\n   packets.\
    \  For example, access control lists, routing policies, and\n   other mechanisms\
    \ may be used to filter ICMP packets or forward\n   packets with certain IP options\
    \ through different routes.  If a\n   capacity-measurement tool uses these special\
    \ packets and they are\n   included in the \"Type P\" designation, the tool may\
    \ not be measuring\n   the path that it was intended to measure.  Tool authors,\
    \ as well as\n   users, may wish to check this point with their service providers.\n"
- title: '2.3.2.  Definition: IP-type-P Link Capacity'
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Definition: IP-type-P Link Capacity\n   We define the IP-layer link capacity,\
    \ C(L,T,I), to be the maximum\n   number of IP-layer bits that can be transmitted\
    \ from the source S and\n   correctly received by the destination D over the link\
    \ L during the\n   interval [T, T+I], divided by I.\n   As mentioned earlier,\
    \ this definition is affected by many factors\n   that may change over time. \
    \ For example, a device's ability to\n   process and forward IP packets for a\
    \ particular link may have varying\n   effect on capacity, depending on the amount\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Time and Sampling\n   We must emphasize the importance of time in the basic\
    \ definitions of\n   these quantities.  We know that traffic on the Internet is\
    \ highly\n   variable across all time scales.  This argues that the time and\n\
    \   length of measurements are critical variables in reporting available\n   capacity\
    \ measurements and must be reported when using these\n   definitions.\n   The\
    \ closer to \"instantaneous\" a metric is, the more important it is\n   to have\

    \  By doing so, we allow valid statistical\n   inferences to be made from the\

- title: 3.2.  Hardware Duplicates
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Hardware Duplicates\n   We briefly consider the effects of paths where\

    \ multiple,\n   identical copies of these packets.  Both the original packet and\
    \ the\n   duplicates can be properly received and appear to be originating from\n\
    \   the sender.  Thus, in the most generic form, duplicate IP packets are\n  \
    \ counted in these definitions.  However, hardware duplication can\n   affect\
    \ these definitions depending on the use of \"Type P\" to add\n   additional restrictions\
    \ on packet reception.  For instance, a\n   restriction only to count uniquely-sent\
    \ packets may be more useful to\n   users concerned with capacity for meaningful\
    \ data.  In contrast, the\n   more general, unrestricted metric may be suitable\
    \ for a user who is\n   concerned with raw capacity.  Thus, it is up to the user\

  - "3.4.  Common Terminology in Literature\n   Certain terms are often used to characterize\
    \ specific aspects of the\n   presented definitions.  The link with the smallest\
    \ capacity is\n   commonly referred to as the \"narrow link\" of a path.  Also,\
    \ the link\n   with the smallest available capacity is often referred to as the\n\
    \   \"tight link\" within a path.  So, while a given link may have a very\n  \
    \ large capacity, the overall congestion level on the link makes it the\n   likely\
    \ bottleneck of a connection.  Conversely, a link that has the\n   smallest capacity\
    \ may not be the bottleneck should it be lightly\n   loaded in relation to the\
    \ rest of the path.\n   Also, literature often overloads the term \"bandwidth\"\
    \ to refer to\n   what we have described as capacity in this document.  For example,\n\
    \   when inquiring about the bandwidth of a 802.11b link, a network\n   engineer\
    \ will likely answer with 11 Mbit/s.  However, an electrical\n   engineer may\
    \ answer with 25 MHz, and an end user may tell you that\n   his observed bandwidth\
    \ is 8 Mbit/s.  In contrast, the term \"capacity\"\n   is not quite as overloaded\
    \ and is an appropriate term that better\n   reflects what is actually being measured.\n"

  - "3.5.  Comparison to Bulk Transfer Capacity (BTC)\n   Bulk Transfer Capacity (BTC)\
    \ [RFC3148] provides a distinct\n   perspective on path capacity that differs\
    \ from the definitions in\n   this document in several fundamental ways.  First,\
    \ BTC operates at\n   the transport layer, gauging the amount of capacity available\
    \ to an\n   application that wishes to send data.  Only unique data is measured,\n\
    \   meaning header and retransmitted data are not included in the\n   calculation.\
    \  In contrast, IP-layer link capacity includes the IP\n   header and is indifferent\
    \ to the uniqueness of the data contained\n   within the packet payload.  (Hardware\
    \ duplication of packets is an\n   anomaly addressed in a previous section.) \
    \ Second, BTC utilizes a\n   single congestion-aware transport connection, such\
    \ as TCP, to obtain\n   measurements.  As a result, BTC implementations react\
    \ strongly to\n   different path characteristics, topologies, and distances. \
    \ Since\n   these differences can affect the control loop (propagation delays,\n\
    \   segment reordering, etc.), the reaction is further dependent on the\n   algorithms\
    \ being employed for the measurements.  For example,\n   consider a single event\
    \ where a link suffers a large duration of bit\n   errors.  The event could cause\
    \ IP-layer packets to be discarded, and\n   the lost packets would reduce the\
    \ IP-layer link capacity.  However,\n   the same event and subsequent losses would\
    \ trigger loss recovery for\n   a BTC measurement resulting in the retransmission\
    \ of data and a\n   potentially reduced sending rate.  Thus, a measurement of\
    \ BTC does\n   not correspond to any of the definitions in this document.  Both\n\
    \   techniques are useful in exploring the characteristics of a network\n   path,\
    \ but from different perspectives.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies definitions regarding\
    \ IP traffic traveling\n   between a source and destination in an IP network.\
    \  These definitions\n   do not raise any security issues and do not have a direct\
    \ impact on\n   the networking protocol suite.\n   Tools that attempt to implement\
    \ these definitions may introduce\n   security issues specific to each implementation.\
    \  Both active and\n   passive measurement techniques can be abused, impacting\
    \ the security,\n   privacy, and performance of the network.  Any measurement\
    \ techniques\n   based upon these definitions must include a discussion of the\n\
    \   techniques needed to protect the network on which the measurements\n   are\
    \ being performed.\n"
- title: 5.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "5.  Conclusion\n   In this document, we have defined a set of quantities related\
    \ to the\n   capacity of links and paths in an IP network.  In these definitions,\n\
    \   we have tried to be as clear as possible and take into account\n   various\
    \ characteristics that links and paths can have.  The goal of\n   these definitions\
    \ is to enable researchers who propose capacity\n   metrics to relate those metrics\
    \ to these definitions and to evaluate\n   those metrics with respect to how well\
    \ they approximate these\n   quantities.\n   In addition, we have pointed out\
    \ some key auxiliary parameters and\n   opened a discussion of issues related\
    \ to valid inferences from\n   available capacity metrics.\n"
