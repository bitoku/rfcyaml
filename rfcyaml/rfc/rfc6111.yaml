  - "1.  Introduction\n   Occasionally, protocol designers need to designate a Kerberos\n
    \  principal name or a Kerberos realm name to have a special meaning\n   other
    than identifying a particular instance.  An example is that the\n   anonymous
    principal name and the anonymous realm name are defined for\n   the Kerberos anonymity
    support [RFC6112].  This anonymity name pair\n   conveys no more meaning than
    that the client's identity is not\n   disclosed.  In the case of the anonymity
    support, it is critical that\n   deployed Kerberos implementations that do not
    support anonymity fail\n   the authentication if the anonymity name pair is used;
    therefore, no\n   access is granted accidentally to a principal who's name happens
    to\n   match with that of the anonymous identity.\n   However, Kerberos, as defined
    in [RFC4120], does not have such\n   reserved names.  As such, protocol designers
    have resolved to use\n   names that are exceedingly unlikely to have been used
    to avoid\n   collision.  Even if a registry were set up to avoid collision of
    new\n   implementations, there is no guarantee for deployed implementations\n
    \  preventing accidental reuse of names that can lead to access being\n   granted
    unexpectedly.\n   The Kerberos realm name in [RFC4120] has a reserved name space\n
    \  although no specific name is defined and the criticality of unknown\n   reserved
    realm names is not specified.\n   This document remedies these issues by defining
    well-known Kerberos\n   names and the protocol behavior when a well-known name
    is used but\n   not supported.\n"

  - "3.  Definitions\n   In this section, well-known names are defined for both the
    Kerberos\n   principal name and the Kerberos realm name.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Well-Known Kerberos Principal Names\n   A new name type KRB_NT_WELLKNOWN
      is defined for well-known principal\n   names.  The Kerberos principal name
      is defined in Section 6.2 of\n   [RFC4120].\n            KRB_NT_WELLKNOWN                  11\n
      \  A well-known principal name MUST have at least two or more\n   KerberosString
      components, and the first component MUST be the string\n   literal \"WELLKNOWN\".\n
      \  If a well-known principal name is used as the client principal name\n   or
      the server principal name but not supported, the Authentication\n   Service
      (AS) [RFC4120] and the application server MUST reject the\n   authentication
      attempt.  Similarly, the Ticket Granting Service (TGS)\n   [RFC4120] MAY reject
      the authentication attempt if a well-known\n   principal name is used as the
      client principal name but not\n   supported, and SHOULD reject the authentication
      attempt if a well-\n   known principal name is used as the server principal
      name but not\n   supported.  These rules were designed to allow incremental
      updates\n   and ease migration.  More specifically, if a well-known principal
      is\n   accepted in one realm, it is desirable to allow the cross-realm\n   Ticket
      Granting Ticket (TGT) to work when not all of the realms in\n   the cross-realm
      authentication path are updated; if the server\n   principal with an identically
      named well-known name was created\n   before the Key Distribution Center (KDC)
      is updated, it might be\n   acceptable to allow authentication to work within
      a reasonably\n   limited time window.  However, unless otherwise specified,
      if a well-\n   known principal name is used but not supported in any other places
      of\n   Kerberos messages, authentication MUST fail.  The error code is\n   KRB_AP_ERR_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN,
      and there is no accompanying error data\n   defined in this document for this
      error.\n            KRB_AP_ERR_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN      82\n                 --
      A well-known Kerberos principal name is used but not\n                 -- supported.\n"

    - "3.2.  Well-Known Kerberos Realm Names\n   Section 6.1 of [RFC4120] defines
      the \"other\" style of realm name, a\n   new realm type WELLKNOWN is defined
      as a name of type \"other\", with\n   the NAMETYPE part filled in with the string
      literal \"WELLKNOWN\".\n            other: WELLKNOWN:realm-name\n   This name
      type is designated for well-known Kerberos realms.\n   The AS and the application
      server MUST reject the authentication\n   attempt if a well-known realm name
      is used as the client realm or the\n   server realm but not supported.  The
      TGS [RFC4120] MAY reject the\n   authentication attempt if a well-known realm
      name is used as the\n   client realm but not supported, and it SHOULD reject
      the\n   authentication attempt if a well-known realm name is used as the\n   server
      realm but not supported.  Unless otherwise specified, if a\n   well-known realm
      name is used but not supported in any other places\n   of Kerberos messages,
      authentication MUST fail.  The error code is\n   KRB_AP_ERR_REALM_UNKNOWN, and
      there is no accompanying error data\n   defined in this document for this error.\n
      \           KRB_AP_ERR_REALM_UNKNOWN          83\n                 -- A well-known
      Kerberos realm name is used but not\n                 -- supported.\n   Unless
      otherwise specified, all principal names involving a well-\n   known realm name
      are reserved, and if a reserved principal name is\n   used but not supported,
      and if the authentication is rejected, the\n   error code MUST be KRB_AP_ERR_PRINCIPAL_RESERVED.\n
      \           KRB_AP_ERR_PRINCIPAL_RESERVED     84\n                 -- A reserved
      Kerberos principal name is used but not\n                 -- supported.\n   There
      is no accompanying error data defined in this document for this\n   error.\n
      \  According to Section 3.3.3.2 of [RFC4120], the TGS MUST add the name\n   of
      the previous realm into the transited field of the returned\n   ticket.  Typically,
      well-known realms are defined to carry special\n   meanings, and they are not
      used to refer to intermediate realms in\n   the client's authentication path.
      \ Consequently, unless otherwise\n   specified, the TGS MUST NOT encode a well-known
      Kerberos realm name\n   into the transited field [RFC4120] of a ticket, and
      parties checking\n   the transited realm path MUST reject a transited realm
      path that\n   includes a well-known realm.  In the case of KDCs checking the\n
      \  transited realm path, this means that the TRANSITED-POLICY-CHECKED\n   flag
      MUST NOT be set in the resulting ticket.  Aside from the\n   hierarchical meaning
      of a null subfield, the DOMAIN-X500-COMPRESS\n   encoding for transited realms
      [RFC4120] treats realm names as\n   strings, although it is optimized for domain
      style and X.500 realm\n   names; hence, the DOMAIN-X500-COMPRESS encoding can
      be used when the\n   client realm or the server realm is reserved or when a
      reserved realm\n   is in the transited field.  However, if the client's realm
      is a well-\n   known realm, the abbreviation forms [RFC4120] that build on the\n
      \  preceding name cannot be used at the start of the transited encoding.\n   The
      null-subfield form (e.g., encoding ending with \",\") [RFC4120]\n   could not
      be used next to a well-known realm, including potentially\n   at the beginning
      and end where the client and server realm names,\n   respectively, are filled
      in.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   It is possible to have a name collision with
    well-known names because\n   Kerberos, as defined in [RFC4120], does not reserve
    names that have\n   special meanings; accidental reuse of names MUST be avoided.
    \ If a\n   well-known name is not supported, authentication MUST fail as\n   specified
    in Section 3.  Otherwise, access can be granted\n   unintentionally, resulting
    in a security weakness.  Consider, for\n   example, a KDC that supports this specification
    but not the anonymous\n   authentication described in [RFC6112].  Assume further
    that the KDC\n   allows a principal to be created named identically to the anonymous\n
    \  principal.  If that principal were created and given access to\n   resources,
    then anonymous users might inadvertently gain access to\n   those resources if
    the KDC supports anonymous authentication at some\n   future time.  Similar issues
    may occur with other well-known names.\n   By requiring that KDCs reject authentication
    with unknown well-known\n   names, we minimize these concerns.\n   If a well-known
    name was created before the KDC is updated to conform\n   to this specification,
    it SHOULD be renamed.  The provisioning code\n   that manages account creation
    MUST be updated to disallow creation of\n   principals with unsupported well-known
    names.\n"
