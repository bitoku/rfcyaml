  - "I.  QUESTIONS\n   HOW DOES THE SERVER VERIFY AN ID?\n      References:\n    \
    \     (DHC JBP RFC 539 -- 17644,3g:gy)\n      Discussion:\n         One postulates\
    \ the existence of AT LEAST ONE host whose Mail\n         server process implements\
    \ the User Verification Function (JEW\n         RFC 524 -- 17140,5f7:gy).  Any\
    \ process can contact that server,\n         give him the name of any Individual\
    \ in the Net and a test Id,\n         and the server will determine whether or\
    \ not the Individual and\n         Id agree.\n            The NIC, for one, will\
    \ without question provide this\n            service.\n         With such support\
    \ available to it, ANY FTP server process can\n         then require (of any or\
    \ all user processes that contact it) an\n         ID command wherever it wishes\
    \ within the user-server\n         interchange (within the constraints of the\
    \ Protocol).  The\n         server simply prompts for the Id, gets it, opens a\
    \ connection\n         to the User Verification Agent, presents to it the Individual's\n\
    \         name and purported Id, receives a positive or negative\n         response,\
    \ and deals with the original user process accordingly.\n         Example:\n \
    \           Suppose a user process opens a connection to UCLA-NMC's\n        \
    \    server process, invokes the Delivery function, and in the\n            course\
    \ of the interchange identifies the Author as Roberts\n            at USC-ISI.\n\
    \            The implementors at UCLA-NMC's server process chose to\n        \
    \    require proof, in all Delivery transactions, that the Author\n          \
    \  is who he claims he is.  It therefore prompts for an Id in\n            response\
    \ to the AUTHOR command from the user process, and\n            receives in return\
    \ the command 'ID arpawheel <CA>'.\n            UCLA-NMC's server then connects\
    \ to the NIC's server, invokes\n            the User Verification function there,\
    \ specifying 'REQUESTOR\n            roberts @ usc-isi <CA>' and 'ID arpawheel\
    \ <CA>'.  The NIC\n            informs UCLA-NMS that the Id is incorrect.\n  \
    \          UCLA-NMC then rejects the original ID command.\n         Of course,\
    \ the Protocol does not require that a server demand\n         Ids from users\
    \ that contact it.  Servers who choose not to\n         require proof of identity\
    \ simply never prompt for ID commands,\n         and treat any they receive as\
    \ NOPs.  For such implementations\n         (which represent the current, FTP\
    \ mail protocol situation), no\n         third-part interchanges are ever required.\n\
    \         Each user in the Net has a single Id that he uses throughout\n     \
    \    the Net for purposes of sending and receiving mail.  That Id\n         need\
    \ not (but may, either coincidentally or by design) have any\n         other use.\
    \  In particular, a user's Id is independent of the\n         passwords by which\
    \ he gains access to accounts that he might\n         possess on hosts around\
    \ the Net.\n            Of course, a user could and might see to it that his\n\
    \            passwords and Id are the same.  The NIC, for example, might\n   \
    \         require that a user log in to its system with NIC ident and\n      \
    \      Id, rather than with host name and password, as it does\n            currently.\n\
    \         I emphasize again that Ids have nothing whatsoever to do with\n    \
    \     accounting.  UCLA-NMC doesn't force the Author to prove his\n         identity\
    \ so UCLA has someone to whom it can bill the resources\n         consumed in\
    \ processing the Delivery transaction.  It does so to\n         prevent Jim White\
    \ from authoring a piece of mail and claiming\n         that Larry Roberts wrote\
    \ it.\n            UCLA-NMC does have the option of requiring that a user\n  \
    \          process log in before it delivers mail so that it can be\n        \
    \    billed for the resources it uses.  The appropriate commands\n           \
    \ to require of the user process are USER, PASS, and ACCT.\n            But, the\
    \ billing process is separable from that of\n            identifying Author, Clerk,\
    \ etc.\n            The NIC, for example, in its role as a Distribution Agent,\n\
    \            might establish an account at UCLA-NMC to use whenever it\n     \
    \       delivers mail there.  UCLA-NMC will bill ALL of the NIC's\n          \
    \  activity at UCLA to that account.  But when the NIC delivers\n            a\
    \ piece of mail it claims was authored by Larry Roberts,\n            UCLA-NMC\
    \ may still wish to verify that claim.  Hence the ID\n            command.\n \
    \  ACK, PROGRESS REPORT, OR REPLY WITH NO REFERENCE SERIAL NUMBER\n      References:\n\
    \         (DHC JBP RFC 539 -- 17644,3h:gy)\n      Discussion:\n         A Delivery\
    \ of type POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGMENT,\n         PROGRESS REPORT, or REPLY\
    \ requires a Reference Serial Number of\n         the user process.  Should the\
    \ server determine that one is\n         lacking when the final EXIT command is\
    \ given, he should reject\n         the EXIT command with an appropriate error\
    \ response.\n            The same applies in the Distribution function:  a Reference\n\
    \            Serial Number MUST be specified if the Delivery Type is\n       \
    \     REPLY.\n         The Protocol document is deficient in that it doesn't state\
    \ the\n         above.\n"

  - "II.  COMPLAINTS\n   TERMINATING BOTH THE SUBSYSTEM AND FUNCTIONS WITH EXIT\n\
    \      References:\n         (AAM -- 17404,)\n      Discussion:\n         I have\
    \ no objection to defining two terminating commands, one\n         to exit a function,\
    \ the other to exit the subsystem.  I guess\n         I'd suggest defining a command\
    \ 'GO <CA>' to be used to\n         terminate a function.\n         I don't believe,\
    \ however, that's it's necessary to distinguish\n         the two cases to avoid\
    \ confusion by human users.\n         Even though the command language is ASCII,\
    \ rather than binary,\n         and even though I've adopted Mike Padlipsky's\
    \ concept of a\n         Unified USER Level Protocol', I don't consider that MP\
    \ is a\n         protocol for direct use by humans (although nothing can STOP\
    \ a\n         human user from speaking MP if he has access to a TELNET user\n\
    \         program and is determined to do so).\n         The concept I mean to\
    \ extract from the UULP and exploit is its\n         model of a single process\
    \ with many subsystems, not its\n         philosophy of a Network-standard command\
    \ language for use by\n         human users (the latter may be a good idea, too,\
    \ but it's not\n         the one I'm concerned with at the moment).\n        \
    \ I don't think that designing a protocol to govern an exchange\n         between\
    \ processes is the same task as designing a protocol to\n         mediate a conversation\
    \ between a process and a human user.\n         Using ASCII commands suggests\
    \ (as it did for FTP, RJE, etc.)\n         that the latter problem is the one\
    \ being addressed; it's not.\n   USING TELNET GO AHEAD TO TERMINATE CERTAIN COMMANDS\n\

    \ (ESC? EXT? ...) can easily be chosen that\n         need not appear (and can\

    \ are two separable issues here:\n            (1)  Server Process Proliferation\
    \ of Not?\n               If the consensus of the Network community is that\n\
    \               Padlipsky's UULP approach to protocol design and\n           \
    \    implementation is in fact superior to the current scheme,\n             \
    \  which calls for the implementation of each new Network\n               protocol\
    \ as a distinct server process with its own\n               contact socket, then\
    \ we should begin to embrace that\n               concept and begin reshuffling\
    \ existing protocol\n               implementations accordingly.  Even more surely,\
    \ NEW\n               protocols (like MP), should be designed in accordance\n\
    \               with the new standards, not the old.\n               I think Buz\
    \ Owen's suggestion (ADO RFC 552 -- 17809,3:y)\n               -- that a skeletal\
    \ UULP be defined, a socket assigned to\n               server processes which\
    \ implement it, and MP defined as a\n               subsystem under it -- is excellent.\
    \  I retract my\n               suggestion (JEW RFC 524 -- 17140,3a2:gy) in favor\
    \ of\n               Owen's.\n               I further suggest that the latest\
    \ revision of FTP (NJN\n               RFC 542 -- 17759,) be similarly implemented\
    \ (i.e., as a\n               UULP subsystem), rather then implemented temporarily\n\
    \               under a new socket and later moved over to socket 3 as\n     \
    \          suggested in RFC 542.\n            (2)  RJE's model for FTP Use or\
    \ Not?\n               If both MP (as currently defined) and RJE were instated\n\
    \               as UULP subsystems, they would still embrace different\n     \
    \          philosophies regarding their use of FTP.  As the person\n         \
    \      who proposed and fought for the current RJE model (i.e.,\n            \
    \   to its use of FTP),  I (still) believe it to be an\n               elegant\
    \ one, more elegant by far then the one I've\n               proposed for MP.\n\
    \               An alternative I considered and discarded SOLELY for\n       \
    \        reasons of efficiency (neglecting, perhaps, the issue of\n          \
    \     cleanness of implementation), is that the command\n               currently\
    \ defined as 'FILE <CA>' (JEW RFC 524 --\n               17140,4q2a:gy), both\
    \ in specifying Content and in the\n               Citation Retrieval function,\
    \ be 'FILE <fileaddr> <CA>'\n               instead.\n                  The server\
    \ is then obliged to retrieve the Content of\n                  the Mail from\
    \ the designated server process via a\n                  third-party exchange.\n\
    \               The redefined FILE command would be similar to the\n         \
    \      LOCATION command, except that the former would specify\n              \
    \ JUST Content (and none of the other Static Attributes),\n               and\
    \ that the Server must retrieve the file (which may be\n               a temporary\
    \ file created by the user process) in real\n               time, i.e. BEFORE\
    \ it sends its response to the FILE\n               command.\n               This\
    \ alternative eliminates the need to borrow the BYTE,\n               SOCK, PASV,\
    \ TYPE, STRU, MODE, REST, and SITE commands\n               from FTP (JEW RFC\
    \ 524 -- 17140,7c1:gy).  It also allows\n               the user process the flexibility\
    \ of specifying a file at\n               a host other than his own.\n       \
    \        After some thought, I think I agree with Crocker and\n              \
    \ Postel that theirs is the better implementation.\n                  As they\
    \ point out, however, this implementation\n                  introduces the problem\
    \ of somehow reconciling the\n                  desire to permit (in general)\
    \ the transfer of mail\n                  files without requiring a login, with\
    \ a server's\n                  inability to distinguish that case from the general\n\
    \                  case of file retrieval (for which many hosts will\n       \
    \           require a login).\n   USE OF THE DATE FORM 1/2/73 (JAN 2 OR FEB 1?)\n\

    \ 539 -- 17644,31:gy)\n      Discussion:\n         The Protocol does not, as Crocker\
    \ and Postel state, impose an\n         order upon command specification within\
    \ a function (see for\n         example, JEW RFC 524 -- 17140,5f1b:gy).\n    \
    \     Having considered their suggestion only briefly, it does seem\n        \
    \ to me appropriate to impose some constraints on the order of\n         parameter\
    \ specification by the user.  Off hand, the order\n         suggested -- Dynamic,\
    \ Optional, Static -- seems good.\n"

    \ the format of the the Protocol document.\n         It differs radically from\
    \ that of previous Protocol documents\n         (e.g., FTP, RJE), and is certainly\

    \    (1) It supports all of the functions of the current FTP mail\n          \
    \  protocol.  In addition,\n            (2) It makes specification of author and\
    \ title explicit,\n            avoiding the current problem of multiple headers\

    \            the text of the message),\n            (3) It allows the text of\
    \ the message to reside at a third\n            host, and\n            (4) It\
    \ permits multiple recipients.\n         The breakdown is the following:\n   \
