  - "Abstract\n   With growing availability of good time sources to network nodes,\
    \ it\n   becomes increasingly possible to measure one-way IP performance\n   metrics\
    \ with high precision.  To do so in an interoperable manner, a\n   common protocol\
    \ for such measurements is required.  This document\n   specifies requirements\
    \ for a one-way active measurement protocol\n   (OWAMP) standard.  The protocol\
    \ can measure one-way delay, as well as\n   other unidirectional characteristics,\
    \ such as one-way loss.\n"

  - "1.  Motivations and Goals\n   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working\
    \ group has proposed\n   standards track metrics for one-way packet delay [RFC2679]\
    \ and loss\n   [RFC 2680] across Internet paths.  Although there are now several\n\
    \   measurement platforms that implement the collection of these metrics\n   ([CQOS],\
    \ [BRIX], [RIPE], [SURVEYOR]), there is not currently a\n   standard for interoperability.\
    \  This requirements document is aimed\n   at defining a protocol that allows\
    \ users to do measurements using\n   devices from different vendors at both ends\
    \ and get meaningful\n   results.\n   With the increasingly wide availability\
    \ of affordable global\n   positioning system (GPS) and CDMA based time sources,\
    \ hosts\n   increasingly have available to them time sources that allow hosts\
    \ to\n   time-stamp packets with accuracies substantially better than the\n  \
    \ delays seen on the Internet--either directly or through their\n   proximity\
    \ to NTP primary (stratum 1) time servers.  By standardizing\n   a technique for\
    \ collecting IPPM one-way active measurements, we hope\n   to create an environment\
    \ where these metrics may be collected across\n   a far broader mesh of Internet\
    \ paths than is currently possible.  One\n   particularly compelling vision is\
    \ of widespread deployment of open\n   one-way active measurement beacons that\
    \ would make measurements of\n   one-way delay as commonplace as measurements\
    \ of round-trip time are\n   today using ICMP-based tools like ping.  Even without\
    \ very accurate\n   timestamps one can measure characteristics such as loss with\
    \ quality\n   acceptable for many practical purposes, e.g., network operations.\n\
    \   To support interoperability between alternative OWAMP implementations\n  \
    \ and make possible a world where \"one-way ping\" could become\n   commonplace,\
    \ a standard is required that specifies how test streams\n   are initiated, how\
    \ test packets are exchanged, and how test results\n   are retrieved.  Detailed\
    \ functional requirements are given in the\n   subsequent section.\n"
- title: 2.  Functional Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Functional Requirements\n   The protocol(s) should provide the ability to\
    \ measure, record, and\n   distribute the results of measurements of one-way singleton\
    \ network\n   characteristics such as characteristics defined in [RFC2679] and\n\
    \   [RFC2680].  Result reporting, sampling, and time stamps are to be\n   within\
    \ the framework of [RFC2330].\n   It should be possible to measure arbitrary one-way\
    \ singleton\n   characteristics (e.g., loss, median delay, mean delay, jitter,\
    \ 90th\n   percentile of delay, etc.); this is achieved by keeping all the raw\n\
    \   data for post-processing by the final data consumer, as specified in\n   section\
    \ 2.1.  Since RFC2679 and RFC2680 standardize metrics based on\n   Poisson sampling\
    \ processes, Poisson streams must be supported by the\n   protocol(s).\n   Non-singleton\
    \ characteristics (such as those related to trains of\n   packets, back-to-back\
    \ tuples, and so forth) and application traffic\n   simulation need not be addressed.\
    \  However, they may be addressed if\n   considered practical and not in contradiction\
    \ to other design goals.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Keeping All Data for Post-processing
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Keeping All Data for Post-processing\n   To facilitate the broadest possible\
    \ use of obtained measurement\n   results, the protocol(s) should not necessitate\
    \ any required post-\n   processing.  (This does not apply to implementation details\
    \ such as\n   converting timestamps from ticks since midnight into a canonical\
    \ form\n   or applying calibration constants; such details should naturally be\n\
    \   hidden.)  All data obtained during a measurement session should be\n   available\
    \ after the session is finished if desired by the data\n   consumer so that various\
    \ characteristics can be computed from the raw\n   data using arbitrary algorithms.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Result Distribution
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Result Distribution\n   A means to distribute measurement results (between\
    \ hosts\n   participating in a measurement session and beyond) should be\n   provided.\
    \  Since there can exist a wide variety of scenarios as to\n   where the final\
    \ data destination should be, these should be invoked\n   separately from measurement\
    \ requests (e.g., receiver should not have\n   to automatically send measurement\
    \ results to the sender, since it may\n   be the receiver or a third host that\
    \ are the ultimate data\n   destination).\n   At the same time, ability to transfer\
    \ results directly to their\n   destination (without need for potentially large\
    \ intermediate\n   transfers) should be provided.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Protocol Separation
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Protocol Separation\n   Since measurement session setup and the actual\
    \ measurement session\n   (i) are different tasks; (ii) require different levels\
    \ of\n   functionality, flexibility, and implementation effort; (iii) may need\n\
    \   to run over different transport protocols, there should exist two\n   protocols:\
    \ one for conducting the actual measurement session and\n   another for session\
    \ setup/teardown/confirmation/retrieval.  These\n   protocols are further referred\
    \ to as OWAMP-Test and OWAMP-Control,\n   respectively.\n   It should be possible\
    \ to use devices that only support OWAMP-Test but\n   not OWAMP-Control to conduct\
    \ measurement sessions (such devices will\n   necessarily need to support one\
    \ form of session setup protocol or the\n   other, but it doesn't have to be known\
    \ to external parties).\n   OWAMP-Control would thus become a common protocol\
    \ for different\n   administrative domains, which may or may not use it for session\
    \ setup\n   internally.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Test Protocol
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Test Protocol\n   The test protocol needs to be implemented on all measurement\
    \ nodes\n   and should therefore have the following characteristics:\n   +  Be\
    \ lightweight and easy to implement.\n   +  Be suitable for implementation on\
    \ a wide range of measurement\n      nodes.\n   +  Allow UDP as the transport\
    \ protocol, since the protocol needs to\n      be able to measure individual packet\
    \ delivery times and has to run\n      on various machines (see the section \"\
    Support for Measurements\n      with Different Packet Types\" below for further\
    \ discussion).\n   +  Support varying packet sizes and network services (e.g.,\
    \ DSCP\n      marking).\n   +  Be as simple as possible, but no simpler than necessary\
    \ to\n      implement requirements set forth in this document; the OWAMP-Test\n\
    \      packet format should include only universally meaningful fields,\n    \
    \  and minimum number of them.\n   +  If practical, it should be possible to generate\
    \ OWAMP-Test packets\n      small enough, so that when encapsulated, each fits\
    \ inside a single\n      ATM cell.\n   +  Data needed to calculate experimental\
    \ errors on the final result\n      should be included in every OWAMP-Test packet.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Control Protocol
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Control Protocol\n   Control protocol needs to provide the capability to:\n\
    \   +  authenticate peers to each other using a common authentication\n      method\
    \ that doesn't require building any new authentication\n      infrastructure,\
    \ such as user ID and a shared secret;\n   +  schedule zero or more OWAMP-Test\
    \ sessions (which do not have to be\n      between the peers of OWAMP-Control\
    \ conversation);\n   +  start OWAMP-Test sessions simultaneously or at a pre-scheduled\n\
    \      per-session times;\n   +  retrieve OWAMP-Test session results (of OWAMP-Test\
    \ sessions\n      scheduled in the current and other OWAMP-Control sessions);\n\
    \   +  confirm graceful completion of sessions and allow either side to\n    \
    \  abort a session prematurely.\n   The OWAMP-Control design should not preclude\
    \ the ability to record\n   extended periods of losses.  It should always provide\
    \ peers with the\n   ability to distinguish between network and peer failures.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Support for Measurements with Different Packet Types
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Support for Measurements with Different Packet Types\n   Since the notion\
    \ of a packet of type P from [RFC2330], section 13\n   doesn't always imply precise\
    \ definition of packet type, some\n   decisions narrowing the scope of possible\
    \ packet types need to be\n   made at measurement protocol design stage.  Further,\
    \ measurement with\n   packets of certain types, while feasible in more closed\
    \ settings than\n   those implied by OWAMP, become very hard to perform in an\
    \ open\n   inter-domain fashion (e.g., measurements with particular packets with\n\
    \   broken IP checksum or particular loose source routing options).\n   In addition,\
    \ very general packet type specification could result in\n   several problems:\n\
    \   +  Many OWAMP-Test speakers will be general purpose computers with a\n   \
    \   multitasking operating system that includes a socket interface.\n      These\
    \ will inevitably have higher losses when listening to raw\n      network traffic.\
    \  Raw sockets will induce higher loss rate than\n      one would have with UDP\
    \ measurements.\n   +  It's not at all clear (short of standardizing tcpdump syntax)\
    \ how\n      to describe formally the filter that a receiver should use to\n \
    \     listen for test traffic.\n   +  Suppose an identity of an authenticated\
    \ user becomes compromised.\n      Now the attacker could use that to run TCP\
    \ sessions to the rlogin\n      port of machines around servers that trust this\
    \ user to perform\n      measurements (or, less drastically, to send spam from\
    \ that\n      network).  The ability to perform measurements is transformed into\n\
    \      an ability to generate arbitrary traffic on behalf of all the\n      senders\
    \ an OWAMP-Control server controls.\n   +  Carefully crafted packets could cause\
    \ disruption to some link-\n      layer protocols.  Implementors can't know what\
    \ to disallow\n      (scrambling is different for different link-layer technologies).\n\
    \   It appears that allowing one to ask a measurement server to generate\n   arbitrary\
    \ packets becomes an unmanageable security hole and a\n   formidable specification\
    \ and implementation hurdle.\n   For these reasons, we only require OWAMP to support\
    \ a small subspace\n   of the whole packet type space.  Namely, it should be possible\
    \ to\n   conduct measurements with a given Differentiated Services Codepoint\n\
    \   (DSCP) [RFC2474] or a given Per Hop Behavior Identification Code (PHB\n  \
    \ ID) [RFC3140].\n"
- title: 3.  Scalability
  contents:
  - "3.  Scalability\n   While some measurement architecture designs have inherent\
    \ scalability\n   problems (e.g., a full mesh of always-on measurements among\
    \ N\n   measurement nodes requires O(N^2) total resources, such as storage\n \
    \  space and link capacity), OWAMP itself should not exaggerate the\n   problem\
    \ or make it impossible (where it is in principle possible) to\n   design other\
    \ architectures that are free of scalability deficiencies.\n   It is the protocol\
    \ user's responsibility to decide how to use the\n   protocol and which measurements\
    \ to conduct.\n"

    \   information about it by observing, initiating, or modifying protocol\n   transactions.\n\
    \   It should also be infeasible for such party to use any information\n   obtained\

    \ identities (or classes of identities) can have different\n   testing privileges.\
    \  The use of authorization for arriving at\n   specific policy decisions (such\
    \ as whether to allow a specific test\n   with a specific source and destination\

  contents:

    \ a\n   conversation (other than the detention of some messages), facility\n \
    \  must be provided to authenticate each message of the OWAMP-Control\n   protocol,\
    \ its attribution to a given session, and its exact placement\n   in the sequence\

    \   OWAMP-Test, on the other hand, is a protocol for network measurement.\n  \
    \ One of the attributes of networks is packet duplication.  OWAMP-Test\n   has\
    \ to be suitable for measurement of duplication.  This would make\n   it vulnerable\
    \ to attacks that involve replaying a recent packet.  For\n   the recipient of\
    \ such a packet it is impossible to determine whether\n   the duplication is malicious\
    \ or naturally occurring.\n   OWAMP-Test should measure all duplication -- malicious\
    \ or otherwise.\n   Note that this is similar to delay attacks: an attacker can\
    \ hold up a\n   packet for some short period of time and then release it to continue\n\
    \   on its way to the recipient.  There's no way such delay can be\n   reliably\
    \ distinguished from naturally occurring delay by the\n   recipient.\n   OWAMP-Test\
    \ should measure the network as it was.  Note, however, that\n   this does not\
    \ prevent the data from being sanitized at a later stage\n   of processing, analysis,\
    \ or consumption.  Some sanity checks (those\n   that are deemed reliable and\

    \ to support\n   varying degrees of security modes of operation.  The parameters\
    \ to be\n   considered include: confidentiality, data origin authentication,\n\
    \   integrity and replay protection.\n   It should also be possible to operate\
    \ in a mode where all security\n   mechanisms are enabled and security objectives\
    \ are realized to the\n   fullest extent possible.  We call this \"encrypted mode\"\
    .\n   Since timestamp encryption takes a certain amount of time, which may\n \
    \  be hard to predict on some devices (with a time-sharing OS), a mode\n   should\
    \ be provided that is similar to encrypted mode, but in which\n   timestamps are\
    \ not encrypted.  In this mode, all security properties\n   of the encrypted mode\
    \ that can be retained without timestamp\n   encryption should be present.  We\
    \ call this \"authenticated mode\".\n   It should be possible to operate in a\
    \ completely \"open\" mode, where\n   no cryptographic security mechanisms are\
    \ used.  We call this\n   \"unauthenticated mode\".  In this mode, mandatory-to-use\

    \   capacity starvation denial-of-service attacks (e.g., only sending\n   test\
    \ data back to the client that requested them to be sent with the\n   request\
    \ delivered over a TCP connection), and that prevent a worm\n   from using the\
    \ protocol to send test data to a very large number of\n   hosts in a short time\
    \ (e.g., ensuring that open mode requests can\n   only be made by humans, rate-limiting\
    \ the acceptance of open mode\n   requests).\n   To make implementation more manageable,\
    \ the number of other options\n   and modes should be kept to the absolute practical\
    \ minimum.  Where\n   choosing a single mechanism for achieving anything related\
