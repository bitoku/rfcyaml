  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n
    \  protocol [RFC6325] [RFC7780] is implemented by devices called TRILL\n   switches
    or RBridges (Routing Bridges).  It provides efficient least-\n   cost transparent
    routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary\n   topologies and link technologies,
    using link-state routing and a hop\n   count.\n   The TRILL protocol includes
    an RBridge Channel facility [RFC7178] to\n   support typed message transmission
    between RBridges in the same\n   campus and between RBridges and end stations
    on the same link.  This\n   document specifies a method of sending messages specified
    by a\n   particular organization, indicated by OUI (Organizationally Unique\n
    \  Identifier) [RFC7042] or CID (Company Identifier) [802], over the\n   RBridge
    Channel facility.  Such organization-specific messages could,\n   for example,
    be used for vendor-specific diagnostic or control\n   messages.\n   However, note
    that a range of RBridge Channel protocol numbers are\n   available based on RFC
    publication.  Those intending to use the\n   RBridge Channel facility are encouraged
    to document their use in an\n   RFC and to use RBridge Channel protocol numbers
    based on such RFC\n   publication.\n"

    packet on a link between\n   TRILL switches (RBridges) is shown in Figure 1 below.
    \ When an\n   RBridge Channel message is sent between an RBridge and an end station\n
    \  on the same link, in either direction, it is called a Native RBridge\n   Channel
    message and the TRILL Header (including the Inner Ethernet\n   Addresses and Data
    Label area) is omitted as shown in Figure 2.  The\n   type of RBridge Channel
    packet is given by a Protocol field in the\n   RBridge Channel Header that indicates
    how to interpret the Channel-\n   Protocol-Specific Payload.  See [RFC7178].\n

    RBridge Channel Protocol value allocated\n         for the Vendor Channel (see
    Section 4).\n      Vendor ID: This field indicates the vendor specifying the\n
    \        particular use or uses of the Vendor Channel.  The vendor to\n         whom
    the OUI or CID in this field has been allocated is in\n         charge of specifying
    Vendor Channel messages using their\n         identifier.  Depending on the first
    byte of this field as\n         follows:\n         OUI: When the bottom two bits
    of the first byte of the Vendor\n            ID are zero (that is, the first byte
    is 0bXXXXXX00), the\n            Vendor ID is an OUI.\n         CID: When the
    bottom two bits of the first byte are a one\n            followed by a zero (that
    is, the first byte is 0bXXXXXX10),\n            the Vendor ID is a CID.\n         Other:
    Other values of the bottom two bits of the first byte of\n            the Vendor
    ID are invalid, and a VERR of 2 MUST be returned,\n            subject to possible
    rate limiting (see Section 3).\n      VERR:  Vendor Channel Error.  See Section
    3.\n      Sub-Protocol: Actually, the vendor specifying their use of the\n         Vendor
    Channel can do whatever they want with the bits after\n         the VERR field.
    \ But it is strongly RECOMMENDED that they use\n         the sub-protocol / sub-version
    fields indicated so that\n         multiple and evolving uses can be specified
    based on a single\n         OUI.\n      Sub-Version: See explanation above of

  - "3.  Vendor Channel Errors\n   The VERR field values from 0x0 through 0x0F (inclusive)
    and the value\n   0xFF are reserved for specification by the IETF.  See Section
    4.  All\n   other values of VERR are available for whatever use the vendor\n   specifies,
    except that a Vendor Channel implementation MUST NOT send\n   a Vendor Channel
    Error in response to a Vendor Channel message with a\n   nonzero VERR.\n   The
    VERR values thus far specified by the IETF are as follows:\n   0.  The VERR field
    is zero in Vendor Channel messages unless the\n       Vendor Channel packet is
    reporting an error.\n   1.  The value one indicates that the length of the RBridge-Channel-\n
    \      Specific Data is less than 4 bytes.  This means that at least the\n       VERR
    byte and possibly part or all of the OUI is truncated.  If\n       an RBridge
    that implements the Vendor Channel facility receives\n       such a Vendor Channel
    message, it MUST expand it to extend\n       through the VERR field, set that
    field to one, and return the\n       packet as described in Section 3.1.\n   2.
    \ The OUI/CID field value is unknown.  If an RBridge implements the\n       Vendor
    Channel facility and receives a Vendor Channel packet with\n       a zero VERR
    field and an OUI/CID field it does not recognize and\n       the SL flag is zero
    in the RBridge Channel Header, it MUST set\n       the VERR field to the value
    two and return the packet as\n       described in Section 3.1.\n   3.  The value
    3 indicates that the Sub-Protocol field value is\n       unknown.  An RBridge
    SHOULD set the VERR field to 3 and return\n       the packet as described in Section
    3.1 if it implements the\n       Vendor Channel facility and it receives a Vendor
    Channel packet\n       meeting the following conditions:\n       (a) a zero VERR
    field in the RBridge Channel Header,\n       (b) a zero SL flag in the RBridge
    Channel Header,\n       (c) an OUI/CID that it implements, and\n       (d) a Sub-Protocol
    field value it does not recognize even though\n           it implements and uses
    the Sub-Protocol field.\n   4.  The value 4 indicates that the Sub-Version field
    value is\n       unknown.  An RBridge SHOULD set the VERR field to 4 and return\n
    \      the packet as described in Section 3.1 if it implements the\n       Vendor
    RBridge Channel facility and it receives a Vendor Channel\n       packet meeting
    the following conditions:\n       (a) a zero VERR field  in the RBridge Channel
    Header,\n       (b) a zero SL flag in the RBridge Channel Header,\n       (c)
    an OUI/CID and Sub-Protocol that it implements, and\n       (d) a Sub-Version
    field value it does not recognize even though\n           it implements and uses
    the Sub-Version field.\n   Uniform error handling is generally advisable for the
    sake of\n   maintenance and understandability; however, \"SHOULD\" is chosen for\n
    \  errors 3 and 4 above because, as long as each message is\n   distinguished
    by a vendor's OUI/CID, it is up to that vendor to\n   decide between standard
    and nonstandard error handling.\n"

    - "3.1.  Sending an Error Response\n   The IETF-specified Vendor Channel errors
      are sent in response to a\n   received RBridge Channel packet by setting the
      VERR field as\n   specified above and modifying the packet as specified below.
      \ (The\n   ERR field will be zero because, if it were nonzero, the packet would\n
      \  have been handled at the general RBridge Channel level rather than\n   being
      passed down to the Vendor Channel level.)\n   The RBridge Channel Header is
      modified by setting the SL flag.  (The\n   flags in the Channel Header and the
      semantics of the SL flag are\n   specified in [RFC7178].)\n   o  If an error
      1 is being generated because of truncation, the\n      RBridge-Channel-Specific
      Data area is extended to include the VERR\n      byte.\n   o  If a Vendor Channel
      message was sent between RBridges, the TRILL\n      Header is modified by (1)
      clearing the M bit, (2) setting the\n      egress nickname to the ingress nickname
      as received, (3) setting\n      the ingress nickname to a nickname held by the
      TRILL switch\n      sending the error packet, and (4) setting the hop count
      to the\n      usual value on TRILL Data packets used by the TRILL switch sending\n
      \     the error packet.\n   o  If a Vendor Channel message was sent between
      an RBridge and an end\n      station in either direction, the outer MAC addresses
      are modified\n      by (1) setting the Outer.MacDA to the Outer.MacSA as received
      and\n      (2) setting the Outer.MacSA to the MAC address of the port of the\n
      \     TRILL switch or end station sending the error packet.\n   o  The priority
      of the error response message MAY be reduced from the\n      priority of the
      Vendor Chanel message causing the error, unless it\n      was already minimum
      priority, and the Drop Eligibility Indicator\n      bit MAY be set in an error
      response.  (See Section 4.1.1 of\n      [RFC6325].)\n   o  Vendor Channel error
      responses MAY be rate-limited.\n   It is generally anticipated that the entire
      packet in which an error\n   was detected would be sent back, modified as above,
      as the protocol\n   specific payload, so that, for example, error responses
      could more\n   easily be matched with messages sent; however, except for errors
      1\n   and 2, this is up to the vendor specifying how their Vendor RBridge\n
      \  Channel messages are to be used.\n   Note that if you receive a Vendor Channel
      error message with error 1,\n   indicating a truncation error, you cannot trust
      the apparent\n   \"OUI/CID\" in that Vendor Channel error message.\n"
