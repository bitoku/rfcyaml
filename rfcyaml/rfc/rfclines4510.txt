Abstract The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an Internet protocol for accessing distributed directory services that act in accordance with X.500 data and service models.
This document provides a road map of the LDAP Technical Specification.
The technical specification detailing version 3 of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), an Internet Protocol, consists of this document and the following documents:
Authentication Methods and Security Mechanisms
String Representation of Distinguished Names [RFC4514
String Representation of Search Filters [RFC4515] LDAP:
] LDAP: Syntaxes and Matching Rules
The terms "LDAP" and "LDAPv3" are commonly used to refer informally to the protocol specified by this technical specification.
The LDAP suite, as defined here, should be formally identified in other documents by a normative reference to this document.
LDAP is an extensible protocol.
Extensions to LDAP may be specified in other documents.
Nomenclature denoting such combinations of LDAP plus extensions is not defined by this document but may be defined in some future document(s).
Extensions are expected to be truly optional.
Considerations for the LDAP extensions described in BCP 118, RFC 4521 [RFC4521] fully apply to this revision of the LDAP Technical Specification.
IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) considerations for LDAP described in BCP 64, RFC 4520 [RFC4520] apply fully to this revision of the LDAP technical specification.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
2.  Relationship to X.500 This technical specification defines LDAP in terms of [X.500] as an X.500 access mechanism.
An LDAP server MUST act in accordance with the X.500 (1993) series of International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization (ITU T
) Recommendations when providing the service.
However, it is not required that an LDAP server make use of any X.500 protocols in providing this service.
For example, LDAP can be mapped onto any other directory system so long as the X.500 data and service models [X.501][X.511], as used in LDAP, are not violated in the LDAP interface.
This technical specification explicitly incorporates portions of X.500(93).
Later revisions of X.500 do not automatically apply to this technical specification.
This technical specification, as defined in Section 1, obsoletes entirely the previously defined LDAP technical specification defined in RFC 3377 (and consisting of RFCs 2251 2256, 2829, 2830, 3771, and 3377 itself).
The technical specification was significantly reorganized.
This document replaces RFC 3377 as well as Section 3.3 of RFC 2251.
[RFC4512] replaces portions of RFC 2251, RFC 2252, and RFC 2256.
[RFC4511] replaces the majority RFC 2251, portions of RFC 2252, and all of RFC 3771.
[RFC4513] replaces RFC 2829, RFC 2830, and portions of RFC 2251.
[RFC4517] replaces the majority of RFC 2252 and portions of RFC 2256.
[RFC4519] replaces the majority of RFC 2256.
[RFC4518] is new to this revision of the LDAP technical specification.
Each document of this specification contains appendices summarizing changes to all sections of the specifications they replace.
Appendix A.1 of this document details changes made to RFC 3377.
Appendix A.2 of this document details changes made to Section 3.3 of RFC 2251.
Additionally, portions of this technical specification update and/or replace a number of other documents not listed above.
These relationships are discussed in the documents detailing these portions of this technical specification.
Security Considerations LDAP security considerations are discussed in each document comprising the technical specification.
Appendix A.  Changes to Previous Documents
This appendix outlines changes this document makes relative to the documents it replaces (in whole or in part).
This document is nearly a complete rewrite of RFC 3377 as much of the material of RFC 3377 is no longer applicable.
The changes include redefining the terms "LDAP" and "LDAPv3" to refer to this revision of the technical specification.
Changes to Section 3.3 of RFC 2251
The section was modified slightly (the word "document" was replaced with "technical specification") to clarify that it applies to the entire LDAP technical specification.
