  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Currently, there does not exist a simple and dynamic mechanism for\n\
    \   routers running IS-IS to learn about symbolic hostnames. This\n   document\
    \ defines a new TLV which allows the IS-IS routers to flood\n   their name to\
    \ system ID mapping information across the IS-IS network.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   IS-IS uses a 1-8 byte system ID (normally 6 bytes) to represent\
    \ a\n   node in the network.  For management and operation reasons, network\n\
    \   operators need to check the status of IS-IS adjacencies, entries in\n   the\
    \ routing table and the content of the IS-IS link state database.\n   It is obvious\
    \ that, when looking at diagnostics information,\n   hexadecimal representations\
    \ of systemIDs and LSP identifiers are less\n   clear than symbolic names.\n \
    \  One way to overcome this problem is to define a name-to-systemID\n   mapping\
    \ on a router. This mapping can be used bidirectionally. E.g.,\n   to find symbolic\
    \ names for systemIDs, and to find systemIDs for\n   symbolic names. One way to\
    \ build this table of mappings is by static\n   definitions. Among network administrators\
    \ who use IS-IS as their IGP\n   it is current practice to define such static\
    \ mappings.\n   Thus every router has to maintain a table with mappings between\n\
    \   router names and systemIDs. These tables need to contain all names\n   and\
    \ systemIDs of all routers in the network.\n   There are several ways one could\
    \ build such a table. One is via\n   static configurations. Another scheme that\
    \ could be implemented is\n   via DNS lookups. In this document we propose a third\
    \ solution. We\n   hope the proposed solution is easier and more manageable than\
    \ static\n   mapping or DNS schemes.\n"
- title: 2. Possible solutions
  contents:
  - "2. Possible solutions\n   The obvious drawback of static configuration of mappings\
    \ is the issue\n   of scalability and maintainability. The network operators have\
    \ to\n   maintain the name tables. They have to maintain an entry in the table\n\
    \   for every router in the network. They have to maintain this table on\n   each\
    \ router in the network. The effort to create and maintain these\n   static tables\
    \ grows with the total number of routers on the network.\n   Changing the name\
    \ or systemID of one router, or adding one new router\n   introduced will affect\
    \ the configurations of all the other routers on\n   the network. This will make\
    \ it very likely that those static tables\n   are outdated.\n   Having one table\
    \ that can be updated in a centralized place would be\n   helpful. One could imagine\
    \ using the DNS system for this. A drawback\n   is that during the time of network\
    \ problems, the response time of DNS\n   services might not be satisfactory or\
    \ the DNS services might not even\n   be available. Another possible drawback\
    \ might be the added complexity\n   of DNS. Also, some DNS implementations might\
    \ not support A and PTR\n   records for CLNS NSAPs.\n   A third way to build dynamic\
    \ mappings would be to use the transport\n   mechanism of the routing protocol\
    \ itself to advertise symbolic names\n   in IS-IS link-state PDU. This document\
    \ defines a new TLV which allows\n   the IS-IS routers to include the name to\
    \ systemID mapping information\n   in their LSPs. This will allow simple and reliable\
    \ transport of name\n   mapping information across the IS-IS network.\n"
- title: 3. The Dynamic Hostname TLV
  contents:
  - "3. The Dynamic Hostname TLV\n   The Dynamic hostname TLV is defined here as TLV\
    \ type 137.\n         LENGTH - total length of the value field.\n         VALUE\
    \ - a string of 1 to 255 bytes.\n   The Dynamic hostname TLV is optional. This\
    \ TLV may be present in any\n   fragment of a non-pseudo node LSP. The value field\
    \ identifies the\n   symbolic name of the router originating the LSP. This symbolic\
    \ name\n   can be the FQDN for the router, it can be a subset of the FQDN or any\n\
    \   string operators want to use for the router. The use of FQDN or a\n   subset\
    \ of it is strongly recommended. The content of this value is a\n   domain name,\
    \ see RFC 2181. The string is not null-terminated. The\n   systemID of this router\
    \ can be derived from the LSP identifier.\n   If this TLV is present in a pseudo\
    \ node LSP, then it should not be\n   interpreted as the DNS hostname of the router.\n"
- title: 4. Implementation
  contents:
  - "4. Implementation\n   The Dynamic Hostname TLV is optional. When originating\
    \ an LSP, a\n   router may decide to include this TLV in its LSP. Upon receipt\
    \ of an\n   LSP with the dynamic hostname TLV, a router may decide to ignore this\n\
    \   TLV, or to install the symbolic name and systemID in its hostname\n   mapping\
    \ table.\n   A router may also optionally insert this TLV in it's pseudo node\
    \ LSP\n   for the association of a symbolic name to a local LAN.\n"

    \ IS-IS. However, it is\n   encouraged to use authentications for IS-IS routing\
    \ protocol.  The\n   authentication mechanism for IS-IS protocol is specified\
    \ in [1] and\n   it is being enhanced within IETF in [2].\n"
