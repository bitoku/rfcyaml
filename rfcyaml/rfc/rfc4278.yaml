  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Standards Process [RFC2026] requires that all normative\n\
    \   references for a document be at the same or higher level of\n   standardization.\
    \  RFC 2026 section 9.1 allows the IESG to grant a\n   variance to the standard\
    \ practices of the IETF.  Pursuant to that, it\n   is considering publishing the\
    \ updated BGP-4 specification [RFC4271]\n   as Draft Standard, despite the normative\
    \ reference to [RFC2385],\n   \"Protection of BGP Sessions via the TCP MD5 Signature\
    \ Option\".  RFC\n   2385 will remain a Proposed Standard.  (Note that although\
    \ the title\n   of [RFC2385] includes the word \"signature\", the technology described\n\
    \   in it is commonly known as a Message Authentication Code or MAC, and\n   should\
    \ not be confused with digital signature technologies.)\n   [RFC2385], which is\
    \ widely implemented, is the only transmission\n   security mechanism defined\
    \ for BGP-4.  Other possible mechanisms,\n   such as IPsec [RFC2401] and TLS [RFC2246],\
    \ are rarely, if ever, used\n   for this purpose.  Given the long-standing requirement\
    \ for security\n   features in protocols, it is not possible to advance BGP-4\
    \ without a\n   mandated security mechanism.\n   The conflict of maturity levels\
    \ between specifications would normally\n   be resolved by advancing the specification\
    \ being referred to along\n   the standards track, to the level of maturity that\
    \ the referring\n   specification needs to achieve.  However, in the particular\
    \ case\n   considered here, the IESG believes that [RFC2385], though adequate\n\
    \   for BGP deployments at this moment, is not strong enough for general\n   use,\
    \ and thus should not be progressed along the standards track.  In\n   this situation,\
    \ the IESG believes that variance procedure should be\n   used to allow the updated\
    \ BGP-4 specification to be published as\n   Draft Standard.\n   The following\
    \ sections of the document give detailed explanations of\n   the statements above.\n"
- title: 2.  Draft Standard Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Draft Standard Requirements\n   The requirements for Proposed Standards and\
    \ Draft Standards are given\n   in [RFC2026].  For Proposed Standards, [RFC2026]\
    \ warns that:\n        Implementors should treat Proposed Standards as immature\n\
    \        specifications.  It is desirable to implement them in order to\n    \
    \    gain experience and to validate, test, and clarify the\n        specification.\
    \  However, since the content of Proposed Standards\n        may be changed if\
    \ problems are found or better solutions are\n        identified, deploying implementations\
    \ of such standards into a\n        disruption-sensitive environment is not recommended.\n\
    \   In other words, it is considered reasonable for flaws to be\n   discovered\
    \ in Proposed Standards.\n   The requirements for Draft Standards are higher:\n\
    \        A Draft Standard must be well-understood and known to be quite\n    \
    \    stable, both in its semantics and as a basis for developing an\n        implementation.\n\
    \   In other words, any document that has known deficiencies should not\n   be\
    \ promoted to Draft Standard.\n"
- title: 3.  The TCP MD5 Signature Option
  contents:
  - "3.  The TCP MD5 Signature Option\n   [RFC2385], despite its 1998 publication\
    \ date, describes a Message\n   Authentication Code (MAC) that is considerably\
    \ older.  It utilizes a\n   technique known as a \"keyed hash function\", using\
    \ MD5 [RFC1321] as\n   the hash function.  When the original code was developed,\
    \ this was\n   believed to be a reasonable technique, especially if the key was\n\
    \   appended (rather than prepended) to the data being protected.  But\n   cryptographic\
    \ hash functions were never intended for use as MACs, and\n   later cryptanalytic\
    \ results showed that the construct was not as\n   strong as originally believed\
    \ [PV1, PV2].  Worse yet, the underlying\n   hash function, MD5, has shown signs\
    \ of weakness [Dobbertin, Wang].\n   Accordingly, the IETF community has adopted\
    \ Hashed Message\n   Authentication Code (HMAC) [RFC2104], a scheme with provable\
    \ security\n   properties, as its standard MAC.\n   Beyond that, [RFC2385] does\
    \ not include any sort of key management\n   technique.  Common practice is to\
    \ use a password as a shared secret\n   between pairs of sites, but this is not\
    \ a good idea [RFC3562].\n   Other problems are documented in [RFC2385] itself,\
    \ including the lack\n   of a type code or version number, and the inability of\
    \ systems using\n   this scheme to accept certain TCP resets.\n   Despite the\
    \ widespread deployment of [RFC2385] in BGP deployments,\n   the IESG has thus\
    \ concluded that it is not appropriate for use in\n   other contexts.  [RFC2385]\
    \ is not suitable for advancement to Draft\n   Standard.\n"
- title: 4.  Usage Patterns for RFC 2385
  contents:
  - "4.  Usage Patterns for RFC 2385\n   Given the above analysis, it is reasonable\
    \ to ask why [RFC2385] is\n   still used for BGP.  The answer lies in the deployment\
    \ patterns\n   peculiar to BGP.\n   BGP connections inherently tend to travel\
    \ over short paths.  Indeed,\n   most external BGP links are one hop.  Although\
    \ internal BGP sessions\n   are usually multi-hop, the links involved are generally\
    \ inhabited\n   only by routers rather than general-purpose computers; general-\n\
    \   purpose computers are easier for attackers to use as TCP hijacking\n   tools\
    \ [Joncheray].\n   Also, BGP peering associations tend to be long-lived and static.\
    \  By\n   contrast, many other security situations are more dynamic.\n   This\
    \ is not to say that such attacks cannot happen.  (If they\n   couldn't happen\
    \ at all, there would be no point to any security\n   measures.)  Attackers could\
    \ divert links at layers 1 or 2, or they\n   could (in some situations) use Address\
    \ Resolution Protocol (ARP)\n   spoofing at Ethernet-based exchange points.  Still,\
    \ on balance, BGP\n   is employed in an environment that is less susceptible to\
    \ this sort\n   of attack.\n   There is another class of attack against which\
    \ BGP is extremely\n   vulnerable:  false route advertisements from more than\
    \ one autonomous\n   system (AS) hop away.  However, neither [RFC2385] nor any\
    \ other\n   transmission security mechanism can block such attacks.  Rather, a\n\
    \   scheme such as S-BGP [Kent] would be needed.\n"
- title: 5.  LDP
  contents:
  - "5.  LDP\n   The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC3036] also uses [RFC2385].\n\
    \   Deployment practices for LDP are very similar to those of BGP: LDP\n   connections\
    \ are usually confined within a single autonomous system\n   and most frequently\
    \ span a single link between two routers.  This\n   makes the LDP threat environment\
    \ very similar to BGP's.  Given this,\n   and a considerable installed base of\
    \ LDP in service provider\n   networks, we are not deprecating [RFC2385] for use\
    \ with LDP.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The IESG believes that the variance described\
    \ here will not adversely\n   affect the security of the Internet.\n"
- title: 7.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "7.  Conclusions\n   Given the above analysis, the IESG is persuaded that waiving\
    \ the\n   prerequisite requirement is the appropriate thing to do.  [RFC2385]\n\
    \   is clearly not suitable for Draft Standard.  Other existing\n   mechanisms,\
    \ such as IPsec, would do its job better.  However, given\n   the current operational\
    \ practices in service provider networks at the\n   moment -- and in particular\
    \ the common use of long-lived standard\n   keys, [RFC3562] notwithstanding --\
    \  the marginal benefit of such\n   schemes in this situation would be low, and\
    \ not worth the transition\n   effort.  We would prefer to wait for a security\
    \ mechanism tailored to\n   the major threat environment for BGP.\n"
