Abstract This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.
This memo defines a portion of the MIB for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects to configure and/or monitor Bidirectional Forwarding Detection for [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883], and [RFC7130], BFD versions 0 and/or 1, on devices supporting this feature.
This memo does not define a compliance requirement for a system that only implements BFD version 0.
This is a reflection of a considered and deliberate decision by the BFD WG because the BFD version 0 protocol is primarily of historical interest by comparison to the widespread deployment of the BFD version 1 protocol.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
As with all MIB modules, an attempt to SET or CREATE an object to a value that is not supported by the implementation will result in a failure using a return code that indicates that the value is not supported.
This document adopts the definitions, acronyms, and mechanisms described in [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883], and [RFC7130].
Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms described therein will not be redescribed here.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
Brief Description of MIB Objects
This section describes objects pertaining to BFD.
The MIB objects are derived from [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883], and [RFC7130], and also include textual conventions defined in [RFC7330].
The General Variables are used to identify parameters that are global to the BFD process.
The session table is used to identify a BFD session between a pair of nodes.
The session performance table is used for collecting BFD performance counters on a per session basis.
This table is an AUGMENT to the bfdSessionTable.
BFD Session Discriminator Mapping Table (bfdSessDiscMapTable)
The BFD Session Discriminator Mapping Table provides a mapping between a local discriminator value to the associated BFD session found in the bfdSessionTable.
BFD Session IP Mapping Table (bfdSessIpMapTable) Given bfdSessInterface, bfdSessSrcAddrType, bfdSessSrcAddr, bfdSessDstAddrType, and bfdSessSrcAddrType, the BFD Session IP Mapping Table maps to an associated BFD session found in the bfdSessionTable.
This table SHOULD contain those BFD sessions that are of type "IP".
This MIB module makes references to the following documents: [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC2863], [RFC3289], [RFC3413], [RFC5082], [RFC5880], and [RFC5881].

"Collection of objects needed to monitor the performance of BFD sessions."
Set of notifications implemented in this module."
As BFD may be tied into the stability of the network infrastructure (such as routing protocols), the effects of an attack on a BFD session may be very serious.
This ultimately has denial of service effects, as links may be declared to be down (or falsely declared to be up.)
As such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large number of end users.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
Improper change of bfdAdminStatus, to disabled(2), adminDown(3), or down(4), can cause significant disruption of the connectivity to those portions of the Internet reached via all the applicable remote BFD peers.
bfdSessAdminStatus   Improper change of bfdSessAdminStatus, to disabled(2), adminDown(3), or down(4), can cause significant disruption of the connectivity to those portions of the Internet reached via all the applicable remote BFD peers.
Improper change of this object can cause connections to be disrupted for extremely long time periods when otherwise they would be restored in a relatively short period of time.
Some management objects define the BFD session whilst other management objects define the parameter of the BFD session.
It is particularly important to control the support for SET access to those management objects that define the BFD session, as changes to them can be disruptive.
Implementation SHOULD NOT allow changes to following management objects when bfdSessState is up(4):
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
The bfdSessTable may be used to directly configure BFD sessions.
The bfdSessMapTable can be used indirectly in the same way.
Unauthorized access to objects in this table could result in disruption of traffic on the network.
This is especially true if an unauthorized user configures enough tables to invoke a denial of service attack on the device where they are configured, or on a remote device where the sessions terminate.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The bfdSessPerfTable allows access to the performance characteristics of BFD sessions.
Network administrators not wishing to show this information should consider this table sensitive.
The bfdSessAuthenticationType, bfdSessAuthenticationKeyID, and bfdSessAuthenticationKey objects hold security methods and associated security keys of BFD sessions.
These objects are highly sensitive.
In order to prevent this sensitive information from being improperly accessed, implementers SHOULD disallow access to these objects.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the "SMI Network Management MGMT Codes" registry:
{ mib 2 222 }
