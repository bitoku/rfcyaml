RFC 802: The ARPANET 1822L Host Access Protocol
malis@bbn unix Bolt Beranek and
This document proposes two major changes to the  current  ARPANET host  access  protocol.
The first change will allow hosts to use logical addressing (i.e., host addresses that are independent  of their  physical location on the ARPANET) to communicate with each other, and the second will allow a host to shorten the amount  of time
that  it  may  be  blocked  by  its IMP after it presents a message to the network (currently,  the  IMP  can  block  further input from a host for up to 15 seconds).
The new host access protocol is known as the ARPANET  1822L  (for Logical)  Host  Access Protocol, and it represents an addition to the current ARPANET 1822 Host Access Protocol, which is described in  sections  3.3  and  3.4 of BBN Report 1822 [1].
Although the 1822L protocol uses different  Host IMP  leaders  than  the  1822 protocol,
either  protocol can readily communicate with each other (the IMPs handle the translation automatically).
The new option for shortening the host blocking timeout is called the short blocking feature, and it replaces the non blocking host interface described in section 3.7 of Report 1822.
This  feature will  be  available  to  all  hosts  on  C/30
IMPs (see the next paragraph), regardless of whether they  use  the  1822  or  1822L protocol.
There is one major restriction  to
the  new  capabilities  being described.
protocol  and  the  short blocking feature will be implemented on C/30 IMPs only, and will therefore only be useable by hosts connected to C/30 IMPs, as the Honeywell and Pluribus IMPs do not have sufficient memory to hold  the  new programs  and  tables.
This restriction also means that logical addressing cannot be used to address a host on  a  non C/30  IMP.
However, the ARPANET will shortly be completely converted to C/30 IMPs, and at that time this  restriction  will  no  longer  be  a problem.
I will try to keep my terminology consistent with  that  used  in Report  1822, and will define new terms when they are first used.
Of course, familiarity with Report 1822 (section 3 in particular) is assumed.
This document  makes  many  references  to  Report  1822.
As  a convenient  abbreviation,  I  will  use  "see 1822(x)" instead of "please refer to Report 1822, section x, for further details".
This document is a proposal, not a description of an  implemented system.
are subject to change based upon responses to this  document  and  restrictions  that  become evident  during  implementation.
However,  any such changes are expected to be minor.
A new RFC will be made available once  the 2 implementation  is  complete containing the actual as implemented description.
Finally, I would like to thank Dr. Eric C. Rosen, who wrote  most of section 2.4, and James G. Herman, Dr. Paul J. Santos Jr., John F.  Haverty, and Robert M. Hinden, all of  BBN,  who  contributed many of the ideas found herein.
Host  Access  Protocol,  which  replaces
Protocol  described  in Report 1822, sections 3.3 and 3.4, allows a host to use logical addressing  to communicate  with other hosts on the ARPANET.
Basically, logical addressing allows hosts to refer to each  other  using  an  1822L name  (see section 2.1) which is independent of a host's physical location in the network.
IEN 183 (also published as  BBN  Report 4473)
[2]  gives  the  use  of
Among the advantages it cites are: The ability to refer to each host on  the  network  by  a  name independent of its location on the network.
Allowing different hosts to share  the  same  host
port  on  a time division basis.
Allowing a host to use multi homing (where a single  host  uses more than one port to communicate with the network).
And allowing several hosts that provide  the  same  service  to share the same name.
The main differences between the 1822 and 1822L protocols are the format of the leaders that are used to introduce messages between 4 a host and an IMP, and the specification in those leaders of  the source  and/or  destination
Hosts  have the choice of using the 1822 or the 1822L protocol.
When a host comes up on an IMP,  it declares itself to be an 1822 host or an 1822L host host by the type of NOP message (see section 3.1)
Once  up, hosts  can  switch  from  one protocol to the other by issuing an appropriate NOP.
Hosts that do not use the 1822L  protocol  will still  be  addressable by and can communicate with hosts that do, and vice versa.
Another difference between the two protocols  is  that  the  1822 leaders are symmetric, while the 1822L leaders are not.
The term symmetric means that in the 1822 protocol, the exact same  leader format  is used for messages in both directions between the hosts and IMPs.
For example, a leader sent from a host  over  a  cable that  was  looped  back onto itself (via a looping plug or faulty hardware) would arrive back at the host and appear to be a  legal message  from  a  real host (the destination host of the original message).
In contrast, the 1822L headers are not symmetric,  and a  host
can  detect  if  the  connection to its IMP is looped by receiving a message with the wrong leader  format.
This  allows the host to take appropriate action upon detection of the loop.
5 2.1  Addresses and Names
The 1822 protocol defines one form of host specification, and the 1822L  protocol  defines  two additional ways to identify network hosts.
These three forms are 1822 addresses,  1822L
1822 addresses are  the  24 bit  host
These fields are quite large, and the ARPANET will never use more than  a  fraction of the available address space.
1822 addresses are used in 1822 leaders only.
1822L names are 16 bit unsigned numbers that serve as
a  logical identifier  for  one  or  more  hosts.
The 1822L names are just 16 bit  unsigned  numbers,  except
are not both zeros (see below).
This allows over 49,000 hosts to be specified.
1822 addresses cannot be used in 1822L leaders, but there may  be a  requirement for an 1822L host to be able to address a specific physical host port or IMP fake host.
are  used for  this  function.
1822L addresses form a subset of the 1822L name space, and have both bits 1 and 2 off.
This format gives 1822L hosts the  ability  to  directly  address hosts  0
1 255 (IMP 0 does not exist).
60 63 are reserved for addressing the four  fake  hosts  at  each IMP.
Every host on a C/30 IMP, regardless of whether it is  using  the 1822 or 1822L protocol to access the network, will be assigned at least one 1822L name (logical address).
Other 1822L  hosts  will use  this name to address the host, wherever it may be physically located.
Because of the implementation constraints mentioned  in the introduction, hosts on non C/30 IMPs cannot be assigned 1822L names.
To circumvent this restriction, however, 1822L hosts  can use  1822L addresses to access all other hosts on the network, no matter where they reside.
At this point, several questions  arise:
How  are  these  names assigned,
they  become  known  to  the  IMPs
(so  that translations to physical addresses can be made), and
how  do  the IMPs know which host is currently using a shared port?
To answer each question in order: 8 Names are assigned by a central network administrator.
When each name  is  created, it is assigned to a host (or a group of hosts) at one or more specific host ports.
The host(s) are  allowed  to reside at those specific host ports, and nowhere else.
If a host moves, it will keep the same name, but the administrator  has  to update  the  central  database  to  reflect  the  new  host port.
Changes to this database are  distributed  to  the  IMPs  by  the Network  Operations  Center  (NOC) at BBN.
For a while, the host may be allowed to reside at either of (or both) the new  and  old ports.
Once  the  correspondence between a name and one or more hosts ports where it may be used has been made  official  by  the administrator,   that  name  is  said  to  be  authorized.
1822L addresses, which actually  refer  to  physical  host  ports,  are always authorized in this sense.
Once a host has been assigned one or more names, it  has  to  let the  IMPs  know  where it is and what name(s) it is using.
There are two cases to consider, one for 1822L hosts  and  another  for 1822  hosts.
The following discussion only pertains to hosts on C/30 IMPs.
When an IMP sees an 1822L host come up on a host  port,
the  IMP has  no way of knowing which host has just come up (several hosts may share the same port, or one host may prefer to  be  known  by 9 different  names  at different times).
This requires the host to let the IMP know what is happening before it
can  actually  send and  receive messages.
This function is performed by a new host  to IMP message, the Name Declaration Message (NDM),  which  lists the  names
that  the  host  would  like to be known by.
The IMP checks its tables to see if each of the names is authorized,  and sends an NDM Reply to the host saying which names in the list can be used for sending and receiving messages (i.e., which names are effective).
A host can also use an NDM message to change its list of effective addresses (it can add to and delete from  the  list) at  any  time.
The only constraint on the host is that any names it  wishes  to  use
can  become  effective  only  if  they   are authorized.
In the second case, if a host comes up on a C/30  IMP  using  the 1822 protocol, the IMP automatically makes the first name the IMP finds in its tables for that host become effective.
Thus,  even though  the host is using the 1822 protocol, it can still receive messages from 1822L hosts via its 1822L name.
Of course, it  can also receive messages from an 1822L host via its 1822L address as well.
(Remember,  the  distinction  between  1822L  names   and addresses
is that the addresses correspond to physical locations on  the  network,  while
the   names   are   strictly   logical identifiers).
The  IMPs translate between the different leaders 10 and send the proper leader in each case (more on this below).
The third question above has by now already been answered.
When an  1822L  host comes up, it uses the NDM message to tell the IMP which host it is (which names it is known by).
Even if this is a shared port, the IMP knows which host is currently connected.
Whenever a host goes down, its names  automatically  become  non  effective.
When it comes back up, it has to make them effective again.
Several hosts can share the same 1822L name.
If more than one of these  hosts  is  up  at the same time, any messages sent to that 1822L name will be delivered to just one  of  the  hosts  sharing that  name,  and  a RFNM will be returned as usual.
However, the sending host will  not  receive  any  indication  of  which  host received  the  message,  and subsequent messages to that name are not guaranteed to be sent to the  same  host.
Typically,  hosts providing  exactly  the  same  service could share the same 1822L name in this manner.
Similarly, when a host is multi homed, the same  1822L  name  may refer  to  more  than  one  host  port (all connected to the same host).
If the host is up on only one of those ports,  that  port will  be  used for all messages addressed to it.
However, if the 11 host were up  on  more  than  one  port,  the  message  would  be delivered  over  just  one  of  those ports, and the subnet would choose which port to use.
This port selection could change  from message  to  message.
If  a  host wanted to insure that certain messages were delivered to it on specific ports,  these  messages could  use  either  the  port's 1822L address or a specific 1822L name that referred to that port alone.
Some further details are required on communications between  1822 and  1822L  hosts.
Obviously, when 1822 hosts converse, or when 1822L hosts converse, no conversions between leaders and  address formats  are  required.
However,  this becomes more complicated when 1822 and 1822L hosts converse with each other.
how   these   addressing combinations  are  handled,  showing  how  each  type of host can access every other type of host.
There are three types of hosts: "1822  on  C/30
an  1822 host that is on a C/30 IMP, "1822L" signifies an 1822L host (on a C/30  IMP),  and  "1822  on
an  non C/30 IMP (which cannot support the 1822L protocol).
The table entry shows the  protocol and  host address format(s) that the source host can use to reach the destination host.
The message is presented  to  the  destination  host with  an 1822L leader containing the 1822L addresses of the source  and  destination  hosts.
If  either address  cannot be encoded as an 1822L address, then the message is not delivered and and  error
message is sent to the source host.
The message is presented  to  the  destination  host with  an  1822 leader containing the 1822 address of the source host.
Communications between different host types 13 2.3  Uncontrolled Messages Uncontrolled messages (see 1822(3.6))
present  a  unique  problem for  the  1822L  protocol.
Uncontrolled messages use none of the normal ordering and error control mechanisms in the IMP,  and
do not  use  the  normal  subnetwork
As a result, uncontrolled messages need to carry all of their overhead with  them, including source and destination addresses.
If 1822L addresses  are  used  when  sending  an   uncontrolled   message, additional information is now required by the subnetwork when the message is transferred to the destination IMP.
This  means  that less  host to host  data  can be contained in the message than is possible between 1822 hosts.
that  are  sent  between  1822  hosts  may contain  not  more  than 991 bits of data.
Uncontrolled messages that are sent to and/or from 1822L hosts are limited to  32  bits less,  or
not  more  than  959  bits.
Messages that exceed this length will result in an error indication to the  host,  and  the message  will  not  be sent.
This error indication represents an enhancement to the previous level of service provided by the IMP, which  would  simply  discard an overly long uncontrolled message without notification.
14 Other enhancements that are  provided  for  uncontrolled  message service
are  a  notification  to the host of any message related errors that are detected by the host's IMP when it  receives  the message.
A  host  will  be  notified if an uncontrolled message contains an error in the 1822L name specification,
such  as  the name  not being authorized or effective, or if the remote host is unreachable (which is  indicated  by  none  of  its  names  being effective),  or  if  network  congestion  control  throttled  the message before it left the source IMP.
The  host  will  not  be notified  if  the  uncontrolled  message was lost for some reason once it was transmitted by the source IMP.
The short blocking feature of the 1822  and  1822L  protocols  is designed  to  allow a host to present messages to the IMP without causing the IMP to not accept further messages from the host  for long amounts of time (up to 15 seconds).
It is a replacement for the non blocking host interface described in 1822(3.7), and  that description should be ignored.
Host Blocking Most commonly, when a source host submits a message  to  an  IMP, the  IMP
immediately  processes that message and sends it on its way to its destination host.
Sometimes, however, the IMP is  not able  to  process  the message immediately.
Processing a message requires a significant number of resources, and when the  network is heavily loaded, there can sometimes be a long delay before the necessary resources become available.
In  such  cases,  the  IMP must  make  a decision as to what to do while it is attempting to gather the resources.
One possibility is for the IMP to stop  accepting  messages  from the  source  host  until  it has gathered the resources needed to process the message just submitted.
This strategy  is  known  as blocking  the  host,  and is basically the strategy that has been used in the ARPANET up to the present.
When  a  host  submits  a message  to  an  IMP, all further transmissions from that host to that IMP are blocked until the message can be processed.
It is important to note, however, that not all  messages  require the  same
set  of resources in order to be processed by the IMP.
The particular set of resources needed will depend on the message type, the message length, and the destination host of the message (see below).
Therefore, although it might take a  long  time  to 16 gather  the  resources needed to process some particular message, it might take only a short time to gather the resources needed to process  some  other  message.
This  fact exposes a significant disadvantage in the strategy of blocking the host.
A host  which is  blocked may have many other messages to submit which, if only they could be submitted, could be processed immediately.
It  is "unfair"  for  the IMP to refuse to accept these message until it has gathered the resources for  some  other,  unrelated  message.
Why  should messages for which the IMP has
plenty of resources be delayed for an arbitrarily long amount of time just  because  the IMP lacks the resources needed for some other message?
A simple way to alleviate the problem would be to place  a  limit on  the  amount of time during which a host can be blocked.
that,   in   most circumstances,  the  IMP  will  be  able  to gather the resources needed to process the message within the given time period.
If, however, the resources cannot be gathered in this period of time, the IMP will flush the message, sending a  reply  to  the  source host   indicating   that  the  message  was  not  processed,  and specifying the reason that it could not be  processed.
However, the  resource gathering process would continue.
The intention is that the host  resubmit  the  message  in  a  short  time,  when, hopefully,   the   resource   gathering   process  has  concluded 17 successfully.
In  the  meantime,  the  host  can  submit  other messages,  which may be processed sooner.
This strategy does not eliminate the phenomenon of host blocking, but  only  limits  the time  during  which  a  host is blocked.
This shorter time limit will generally fall somewhere in the range of 100 milliseconds to 2  seconds,  with  its value possibly depending on the reason for the blocking.
Note, however, that there  is  a  disadvantage  to  having  short blocking  times.
Let us say that the IMP accepts a message if it has all the resources needed to process it.
The ARPANET provides a  sequential  delivery  service,
whereby messages with the same priority, source host, and destination host are delivered to  the destination
host in the same order as they are accepted from the source host.
With short blocking times, however,  the  order  in which  the  IMP accepts messages from the source host need not be the same as  the  order  in  which  the  source  host  originally submitted  the messages.
Since the two data streams (one in each direction) between the host and the IMP are not synchronized, the host  may  not  receive the reply to a rejected message before it submits subsequent messages of the same  priority  for  the  same destination host.
If a subsequent message is accepted, the order of acceptance differs from the order of original submission,  and the ARPANET will not provide the same type of sequential delivery 18 that it has in the past.
Up to now, type 0 (regular)  messages  have  only  had  sub types available  to  request the standard blocking timeout.
The short  blocking feature makes available new  sub types
that  allow  the host  to  request  messages to be short blocking, i.e. only cause the host to be blocked for a short amount of time if the  message cannot be immediately processed.
See section 3.1 for a complete list of the available sub types.
If sequential delivery by the subnet is a strict requirement,  as would  be  the  case  for  messages  produced  by NCP, the short  blocking feature cannot be used.
For messages produced  by  TCP, however,  the  use  of
the short blocking feature is allowed and recommended.
There are a number of reasons why a message could  cause  a  long blockage  in  the  IMP,  which would result in the rejection of a short blocking message.
a short blocking message by using the Incomplete Transmission (Type 9) message, using the sub type field to  indicate  which  of  the above  reasons  caused the rejection of the message.
See section 19 3.2 for a summary of the Incomplete Transmission  message  and  a complete  list of its sub types.
The sub types that apply to the short blocking feature are: 6.
Although the IMP  presents  a  simple message at a time  interface  to  the  host,
it  provides an internal  connection oriented  (virtual   circuit)
service, except  in  the  case  of  uncontrolled messages (see section 2.3).
Two  messages  are  considered  to  be  on
the  same connection  if they have the same source host (i.e., they are submitted to the same IMP over the same host interface),  the same priority, and the same destination host name or address.
The subnet maintains internal connection set up and tear down procedures.
Connections  are set up as needed, and are torn down  only  after  a  period  of  inactivity.
Occasionally, network  congestion or resource shortage will cause a lengthy delay in connection set up.
During this period, no  messages for  that  connection can be accepted, but other messages can be accepted.
For  every  message  that  a  host submits  to  an  IMP  (except  uncontrolled messages)
the IMP eventually  returns  a  reply  to  the  host  indicating  the disposition  of  the  message.
that the 20 message is submitted and  the  time
the  host  receives  the reply,  the  message  is  said to be outstanding.
The ARPANET allows  only  eight  outstanding  messages   on
If  there  are  eight outstanding messages on a given connection, and a ninth is  submitted,  it
If  a message is refused because its connection is blocked due to flow control, messages  on  other  connections can still be accepted.
End to end flow control is the  most  common
cause  of  host blocking in the ARPANET at present.
Destination IMP buffer space shortage: If the host submits  a message  of  more  than  1008  bits  (exclusive of the 96 bit leader), buffer space at the destination IMP must be reserved before  the  message  can  be  accepted.
Buffer space at the destination IMP is always reserved on a per connection basis.
If  the  destination  IMP  is  heavily loaded, there may be a lengthy wait for the buffer space;  this  is  another  common cause  of  blocking  in  the  present  ARPANET.
Messages are rejected  for  this  reason  based  on   their   length   and connection;  messages  of  1008 or fewer bits or messages for other connections may still be acceptable.
A message may be refused for  reasons  of congestion  control if the path via the intermediate IMPs and lines to the destination IMP is too heavily loaded to  handle additional  traffic.
Messages  to other destinations may be acceptable, however.
Local resource shortage: Sometimes the source IMP itself  is short  of buffer space, table entries, or some other resource that it needs to accept a message.
Unlike the other  reasons for message rejection, this resource shortage will affect all messages equally,  except  for  uncontrolled  messages.
The message's size or connection is not relevant.
The short blocking feature is available  to  all  hosts  on  C/30 IMPs,  whether they are using the 1822 or 1822L protocol, through the use of Type 0, sub type 1 and 2 messages.
A host using these sub types  should  be  prepared  to  correctly  handle Incomplete Transmission messages from the IMP.
When a host comes up on an IMP, or after there has been  a  break in   the  communications  between  the  host  and  its  IMP  (see 1822(3.2)), the orderly flow of messages between the host and the 22 IMP  needs  to  be properly (re)established.
This allows the IMP and host to recover from most any failure  in  the  other  or  in their communications path, including a break in mid message.
The first messages that a host should send to its IMP  are  three NOP  messages.
Three  messages  are  required to insure that at least one message will be properly read by the IMP (the first NOP could be concatenated to a previous message if communications had been broken in mid stream, and the third provides redundancy  for the   second).
These   NOPs   serve  several  functions:  they synchronize the IMP with the host, they tell  the  IMP  how  much padding
the  host  requires  between  the message leader and its body, and they also tell the IMP whether the host will  be  using 1822 or 1822L leaders.
Similarly, the IMP will send three  NOPs  to  the  host  when  it detects  that  the host has come up.
Actually, the IMP will send six NOPs, alternating three 1822  NOPs  with  three  1822L  NOPs.
Thus, the host will see three NOPs no matter which protocol it is using.
will  be  followed  by  two  Interface  Reset messages,  one of each style.
If the IMP receives a NOP from the host while the above sequence is occurring,  the  IMP  will  only send  the  remainder  of  the NOPs and the Interface Reset in the proper style.
The 1822 NOPs will contain the 1822 address of the 23 host interface, and the 1822L NOPs will contain the corresponding 1822L address.
Once the IMP  and  the  host  have  sent
the  above messages, regular communications can commence.
See 1822(3.2) for further details concerning the ready line,  host  tardiness,  and other issues.
The following sections describe the formats of the  leaders  that precede  messages  between  an 1822L host and its IMP.
They were designed to be as compatible with the 1822 leaders  as  possible.
The  second,  fifth,  and  sixth  words
are identical in the two leaders, and all  of  the  existing  functionality  of  the  1822 leaders has been retained.
The first difference one will note is in the first word.
The 1822 New Format Flag is now also used  to identify  the  two  types of 1822L leaders, and the Handling Type has been moved to the second byte.
The third  and  fourth  words contain the Source and Destination 1822L Name, respectively.

Error Without Message ID See 1822(3.3).
Host Going Down see 1822(3.3).
Type 3: Name Declaration Message (NDM)
This  message  is used by the host to declare which of its 1822L names is or is not effective (see section 2.2), or to  make  all of  its  names non effective.
The first 16 bits of the data portion of the NDM message, following  the  leader and  any  padding,  contains  the  number of 1822L name 28 entries contained in the message.
This is followed  by the 1822L name entries, each 32 bits long, of which the first 16 bits is a 1822L name and the  second  16  bits
contains  either  of  the  integers  zero or one.
Zero indicates that the name should not  be  effective,  and one
indicates  that the name should be effective.
The IMP will reply with a NDM Reply  message  (see  section 3.2)  indicating  which  of the names are now effective and which are not.
will  cause  all  current effective names for the host to become non effective.
NOP This allows the IMP to  know
style  of leader  the  host wishes to use.
A 1822L NOP signifies that the host wishes to use 1822L leaders, and an  1822 NOP signifies that the host wishes to use 1822 leaders.
All of the other remarks concerning the NOP message  in 30 1822(3.3)  still  hold.
The  host should always issue NOPs in groups of three to insure proper  reception  by the IMP.

All messages from the same host need not use the  same  name  in this  field.
Each  source  name, when used, is checked for authorization, effectiveness, and actually belonging to this host.
Messages using names that do not satisfy all of these requirements will not be delivered, and will instead  result in  an  error
message being sent back into the source host.
If the host places its 1822L  Address  in  this  field,  the address is checked to insure that it actually represents the host port where the message originated.
If the  message  is destined for an 1822 host on a non C/30 IMP, this field MUST
31 contain the source host's 1822L address  (see  Figure  4  in section 2.2).
This field  contains  the  1822L  name  or  address  of  the destination  host.
If it contains a name, the name will be checked for effectiveness, with an error message returned to the  source  host
if  the  name  is  not effective.
If the message is destined for an 1822 host on a non C/30 IMP, this field MUST contain the destination host's 1822L address (see Figure 4 in section 2.2).
This is a host specified identification used in all  type  0 and  type  8  messages, and is also used in type 2 messages.
When used in type 0 messages, bits 65 72 are also  known  as the  Link  Field,  and
should  contain  values specified in Assigned  Numbers  [3]  appropriate  for  the   host to host protocol being used.
Sub type: This field is used as a modifier by message types 0,  2,  4, and 8.
33 3.2  IMP to Host 1822L
Leader Format 34 Bits 1 4:
Unused and set to zero.
1822L IMP to Host Flag: This field is set to decimal 14 (1110 in binary).
This has the value assigned by the source host (see  section 3.1).
This  field is only used in message types 0, 5 9, 11 and 15.
Unused and set to zero.
Trace Bit: If equal to one, the source host designated this message for tracing as it proceeds through the network.
Bit 22: Available as a destination host flag.
Bits 23 24: Reserved for future use, set to zero.
All  host to host  communication occurs  via  regular  messages, which have several sub  types.
The sub type field (bits 77 80) is the same  as sent in the host to IMP leader (see section 3.1).
Error in Leader See 1822(3.4).
IMP Going Down See 1822(3.4).
This is a reply to the  NDM  host to IMP message  (see  section  3.1).
It  will  have the same number of entries as the  NDM
that  is  being replying  to,  and
will  be accompanied by a zero or a one.
that the  name  is  not  effective, and a one means that the name is now effective.
NOP The host should discard this message.
It  is used    during    initialization    of   the   IMP/host communication.
The Destination Host field will contain the  1822L  Address of the host port over which the NOP is being sent.
All other fields are unused.
Type 5: Ready for Next Message (RFNM) See 1822(3.4).
Dead Host Status See 1822(3.4).
Type 7: Destination Host or IMP Dead  (or  unknown)
This message  is  sent  in  response  to  a  message  for  a destination which the IMP cannot reach.
The message to the "dead" destination is discarded.
See 1822(3.4) for a complete list of the applicable sub types.
If  this message  is in response to a standard (type 0,
sub type 0 or 1) message
, it will be followed  by
a  Dead  Host Status  message,  which gives further information about 36 the status of the dead host.
If  this  message  is  in response  to  an uncontrolled (type 0, sub type 2 or 3) message,
(The destination host  is  not up) will be used, and it will not be followed by a Dead Host Status message.
Type 8: Error in Data See 1822(3.4).
The  transmission  of  the named  message  was  incomplete  for  some  reason.
An incomplete transmission message is similar to  a  RFNM, but  is  a  failure  indication
rather  than a success indication.
This message is also used  by  the  short  blocking feature to indicate that the named message was rejected because it would have caused to IMP  to  block the  host  for  a long amount of time.
See section 2.4 for more details concerning the short blocking feature.
The message's sub types are: 0:
The destination host  did  not  accept  the  message quickly enough.
: The message was too long.
: The host took more than 15 seconds to  transmit  the message  to  the  IMP.
This time is measured from the last bit of the leader through the last bit of the message.
: The message was lost in the network due  to  IMP  or circuit failures.
The IMP could not accept the entire  message  within 15 seconds because of unavailable resources.
This sub type is only used in  response  to
If  a short blocking message timed out, it will be responded to with one of the sub types 6 10.
O failure occurred  during  receipt  of this message.
Sub types 6 10 are all issued in response to  a  short  blocking  message that timed out (would have caused the host to become blocked for a long amount of time).
The sub types are designed to give the host some indication of why it timed out and what other messages would  also time  out.
See  section  2.4.2  for  further  details concerning each of these sub types.
: The message timed out because of  connection  set up delay.
Further  messages to the same host (if on the same connection) may also be affected.
: The message timed out  because  of  end to end  flow control.
Further messages to the same host on the same connection will also be affected.
Destination IMP buffer shortage caused  the  message to  time  out.
This affects multi packet standard messages  to
the  specified  host,  but   shorter messages  or  messages  to hosts on other IMPs
: Network congestion control caused the message to  be rejected.
Messages to hosts on other IMPs may not be affected, however.
Local resource shortage kept  the  IMP  from  being able  to  accept  the  message  within
the short  blocking timeout period.
1822L Name or Address Error
This message is  sent in  response  to  a  type  0  message  from a host that contained an erroneous Source Host or Destination  Host field.
Its sub types are: 0:
The Source Host 1822L name is not authorized or  not effective.
The Source Host 1822L address
the host port used to send the message.
The Destination Host 1822L name is not authorized.
The Destination Host 1822L name  is  authorized  but 39 not  effective,  even though the named host is up.
If the host were actually down, a type
7  message would be returned, not a type 15.
Host  field  contains  a 1822L  name,  but the host being addressed is on a non C/30 IMP (see Figure 4 in section 2.2).
For type 0 messages, this field contains the 1822L  name  or address  of  the  host  that  originated  the  message.
All replies to the message should be sent to the host  specified herein.
For  message  types  5 9,
, this field contains the source host field used in  a  previous  type  0 message sent by this host.
For type 0 messages, this field contains the 1822L  name  or address  that  the  message  was  sent  to.
This allows the destination host to detect  how
it  was  specified  by  the source  host.
For message types 5 9, 11 and 15, this field contains the destination host field used in a previous  type 0 message sent by this host.
40 Bits 65 76: Message ID:
For message types 0, 5, 7 9, 11 and 15, this  is  the  value assigned  by  the  source  host to identify the message (see section 3.1).
This field is also used by  message  types  2 and 6.
Sub type: This field is used as a modifier by message types 0 2,  4 7, 9, 11 and 15.
Message Length: This field is contained in type 0 and type 3 messages  only, and  is  the actual length in bits of the message (exclusive of leader, leader padding, and hardware padding) as computed by the IMP.
