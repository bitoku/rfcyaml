  - "1.  Introduction\n   The tel URI (RFC 3966 [1]), defines a URI that can be used
    to\n   represent resources identified by telephone numbers.  The tel URI,\n   like
    many other URIs, provides extensibility through the definition\n   of new URI
    parameters and new values for existing parameters.\n   However, RFC 3966 did not
    specify an IANA registry where such\n   parameters and values can be listed and
    standardized.  This\n   specification creates such a registry.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Use of the Registry\n   The tel URI parameters and values for these parameters
    MUST be\n   documented in a RFC or other permanent and readily available public\n
    \  specification in order to be registered by IANA.  This documentation\n   MUST
    fully explain the syntax, intended usage, and semantics of the\n   parameter.
    \ The intent of this requirement is to assure\n   interoperability between independent
    implementations, and to prevent\n   accidental namespace collisions between implementations
    of dissimilar\n   features.\n   Documents defining tel URI parameters or parameter
    values MUST\n   register them with IANA, as described in Section 4.  The IANA\n
    \  registration policy for such parameters is \"Specification Required,\n   Designated
    Expert,\" and is further discussed in Section 4.2.\n   Some tel URI parameters
    only accept a set of predefined parameter\n   values while others can take any
    value.  There are also parameters\n   that do not have any value; they are used
    as flags.\n   Those URI parameters that take on predefined values typically take
    on\n   a large number of values.  Registering each of those values, or\n   creating
    a sub-registry for each such parameter is not appropriate.\n   Instead, we have
    chosen to register URI parameter values by\n   reference.  That is, the entry
    in the URI parameter registry for a\n   given URI parameter contains references
    to the RFCs defining new\n   values of that parameter.\n   Accordingly, the tel
    URI parameter registry contains a column that\n   indicates whether or not each
    parameter accepts a value.  The column\n   may contain \"No value\" or \"Constrained\".
    \ A \"Constrained\" in the\n   column implies that certain predefined values exist
    for this\n   parameter and the accompanying RFC or other permanent and readily\n
    \  available public specification should be consulted to find out the\n   accepted
    set of values.  A \"No Value\" in the column implies that the\n   parameter is
    used either as a flag, or does not have a set of\n   predefined values.  The accompanying
    RFC or other permanent and\n   readily available public specification should provide
    more\n   information on the semantics of the parameter.\n"

    - "4.2.  Registration Policy for tel URI Parameters\n   As per the terminology
      in [3] and actions accorded to such a role,\n   the registration policy for
      tel URI parameters shall be\n   \"Specification Required, Designated Expert\"
      (the former implicitly\n   implies the latter).\n   The Designated Expert, when
      deliberating on whether to include a new\n   parameter in the tel URI registry,
      may use the criteria provided\n   below to reach a decision (this is not an
      exhaustive list but\n   representative of the issues to consider when rendering
      an equitable\n   decision):\n   o  If the tel URI -- with the parameter under
      consideration -- will\n      be converted to a URI used by other signaling protocols
      such as\n      the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP [5]) or H.323 [7], then
      the\n      expert must consider whether this parameter merely encapsulates\n
      \     signaling information that is not meaningful to the processing of\n      requests
      in the domain of the converted URI.  For example, certain\n      Integrated
      Services Digital Network (ISDN) User Part (ISUP, [8])\n      parameters have
      no equivalent corollary in SIP; thus, their\n      presence or absence in a
      SIP URI will not hinder the normal rules\n      for processing that URI.  Other
      parameters may affect the normal\n      processing rules associated with the
      URI; in such cases, the\n      expert must carefully consider the ramifications,
      if any, of the\n      presence of such parameters.\n   o  Certain parameters
      of a tel URI can be optional.  These parameters\n      act as metadata about
      the identifier in the tel URI.  Optional\n      parameters should provide additional
      information to a service for\n      which they apply instead of acting as enablers
      of that service in\n      the first place.  The service must continue to be
      invoked and\n      operate normally even in the absence of these parameters.\n"

    have security\n   considerations.  However, as mentioned in [4], an important

    \  extensions and parameters are able to provide secure usage.  The\n   supporting
    RFC publications for parameter registrations described in\n   this specification
    MUST provide detailed security considerations for\n   them.\n"
