  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a packet transport\
    \ technology\n   based on a profile of the MPLS functionality specific to the\n\
    \   construction of packet-switched transport networks.  MPLS is\n   described\
    \ in [RFC3031], and requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in\n   [RFC5654].\n\
    \   A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been\n   developed\
    \ to help model and manage the various aspects of\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching\
    \ (MPLS) networks.  These MIB modules are\n   defined in separate documents that\
    \ focus on the specific areas of\n   responsibility for the modules that they\
    \ describe.\n   An MPLS-TP network can be operated via static provisioning of\n\
    \   transport paths, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and pseudowires (PWs),\n   or\
    \ the elective use of a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) control plane to\n   support\
    \ dynamic provisioning of transport paths, LSPs, and PWs.\n   This document describes\
    \ the MIB-based management architecture for\n   MPLS, as extended for MPLS-TP.\
    \  The document also indicates the\n   interrelationships between existing MIB\
    \ modules that should be\n   leveraged for MPLS-TP network management and identifies\
    \ areas where\n   additional MIB modules are required.\n   Note that [RFC5951]\
    \ does not specify a preferred management interface\n   protocol to be used as\
    \ the standard protocol for managing MPLS-TP\n   networks.\n"
- title: 1.1.  MPLS-TP Management Function
  contents:
  - "1.1.  MPLS-TP Management Function\n   The management of the MPLS-TP networks\
    \ is separable from that of its\n   client networks so that the same means of\
    \ management can be used\n   regardless of the client.  The management function\
    \ of MPLS-TP\n   includes fault management, configuration management, performance\n\
    \   monitoring, and security management.\n   The purpose of the management function\
    \ is to provide control and\n   monitoring of the MPLS transport profile protocol\
    \ mechanisms and\n   procedures.  The requirements for the network management\n\
    \   functionality are found in [RFC5951].  A description of the network\n   and\
    \ element management architectures that can be applied to the\n   management of\
    \ MPLS-based transport networks is found in [RFC5950].\n"

    \ a given Forward\n   Equivalence Class (FEC).  When a packet, with or without\
    \ a label,\n   arrives at an ingress Label Edge Router (LER) of an LSP, it is\n\
    \   encapsulated with the label corresponding to the FEC and sent across\n   the\
    \ LSP.  The labeled packet traverses the LSRs and arrives at the\n   egress LER\
    \ of the LSP, where it gets forwarded, depending on the\n   packet type it came\
    \ with.  LSPs could be nested using label stacking,\n   such that an LSP could\
    \ traverse another LSP.  A more detailed\n   description of an LSP can be found\

    \ of the LSP it\n   represents, and then forwards it to the adjacent LSR of the\
    \ LSP.\n   Each FEC is mapped to a label-forwarding entry, so that a packet\n\
    \   could be encapsulated with one or more label entries; this is\n   referred\
    \ to as a label stack.\n   The packet traverses the LSP.  Upon reaching the egress\

  contents:
  - "4.2.6.  Pseudowire Modules\n   The pseudowire (PW) MIB architecture provides\
    \ a layered modular model\n   into which any supported emulated service such as\
    \ Frame Relay, ATM,\n   Ethernet, Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), and Synchronous\
    \ Optical\n   Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) can be connected\
    \ to\n   any supported Packet Switched Network (PSN) type.  This MIB\n   architecture\
    \ is modeled based on PW3 architecture [RFC3985].\n   The emulated service layer,\
    \ generic PW layer, and PSN Virtual Circuit\n   (VC) layer constitute the different\
    \ layers of the model.  A\n   combination of the MIB modules belonging to each\
    \ layer provides the\n   glue for mapping the emulated service onto the native\
    \ PSN service.\n   At least three MIB modules, each belonging to a different layer,\
    \ are\n   required to define a PW emulated service.\n   -  The service-specific\
    \ module is dependent on the emulated signal\n      type and helps in modeling\
    \ the emulated service layer.\n   The PW-ENET-STD-MIB [RFC5603] describes a model\
    \ for managing Ethernet\n   pseudowire services for transmission over a PSN. \
    \ This MIB module is\n   generic and common to all types of PSNs supported in\
    \ the PWE3\n   Architecture [RFC3985], which describes the transport and\n   encapsulation\
    \ of L1 and L2 services over supported PSN types.\n   In particular, the MIB module\
    \ associates a port or specific VLANs on\n   top of a physical Ethernet port or\
    \ a virtual Ethernet interface (for\n   the Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS))\
    \ to a point-to-point PW.  It\n   is complementary to the PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601],\
    \ which manages the\n   generic PW parameters common to all services, including\
    \ all supported\n   PSN types.\n   The PW-TDM-MIB [RFC5604] describes a model\
    \ for managing TDM\n   pseudowires, i.e., TDM data encapsulated for transmission\
    \ over a PSN.\n   The term \"TDM\" in this document is limited to the scope of\n\
    \   Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH).  It is currently specified to\n  \
    \ carry any TDM signals in either Structure Agnostic Transport mode\n   (E1, T1,\
    \ E3, and T3) or Structure Aware Transport mode (E1, T1, and\n   NxDS0) as defined\
    \ in the PWE3 TDM Requirements document [RFC4197].\n   -  The generic PW module\
    \ configures general parameters of the PW that\n      are common to all types\
    \ of emulated services and PSN types.\n   The PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] defines a MIB\
    \ module that can be used to\n   manage PW services for transmission over a PSN\
    \ [RFC3931] [RFC4447].\n   This MIB module provides generic management of PWs\
    \ that is common to\n   all types of PSN and PW services defined by the IETF PWE3\

    \ such does not have\n   any security implications in and of itself.\n   Each\
    \ IETF MIB document that specifies MIB objects for MPLS-TP must\n   provide a\
    \ proper Security Considerations section that explains the\n   security aspects\
    \ of those objects.\n   The attention of readers is particularly drawn to the\
    \ security\n   implications of making MIB objects available for create or write\n\
    \   access through an access protocol such as SNMP.  SNMPv1 by itself is\n   an\
    \ insecure environment.  Even if the network itself is made secure\n   (for example,\
    \ by using IPsec), there is no control over who on the\n   secure network is allowed\
    \ to access the objects in the MIB module.\n   It is recommended that the implementers\
    \ consider the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414], and\
    \ the\n   View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415], is\n   recommended.\n\
    \   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity\
    \ giving access to an instance of each MIB module is properly\n   configured to\
    \ give access to only those objects, and to those\n   principals (users) that\
    \ have legitimate rights to access them.\n"
