  - "1.  Introduction\n   There is currently a need for a mechanism to identify the
    originating\n   party of a voice mail message, outside of the \"FROM\" header\n
    \  information.  The telephone number and name of the caller are\n   typically
    available from the telephone network, but there is no\n   obvious header field
    to store this in an Internet Mail message.\n   This information is intended for
    use when the VPIM message format is\n   used for storing \"Call Answer\" voice
    messages in an Internet Mail\n   message store, i.e., the calling party leaves
    a voice message for the\n   recipient, who was unable to answer the call.  The
    implication is\n   that there is no RFC 2822 address known for the originator.\n
    \  [VPIMV2R2] suggests the originating number be included as an Internet\n   address,
    using the first method shown below.  There are several other\n   ways to store
    this information, but they all involve some\n   manipulation of the \"From\" field.
    \ For example:\n      1. From: \"416 555 1234\" <non-mail-user@host>\n      2.
    From: \"John Doe\" <4165551234@host>\n      3. From:  unknown:;\n   Since any
    of these is a forced translation, it would be useful to\n   store the calling
    party's name and number as presented by the\n   telephone system to the called
    party without manipulation.  This\n   would allow the calling party's information
    to be displayed to the\n   recipient (similar to it appearing on the telephone)
    and also allow\n   future determination of an Internet address for the originator
    (if\n   one exists).  Note that there is no requirement to store meta-data\n   (e.g.,
    type of number, presentation restricted), as this information\n   is not presented
    to the called party and is generally not available\n   to voice mail systems.
    \ The intent is to store the available\n   information to an analog (non-ISDN)
    phone (e.g., per [T1.401] in\n   North America).\n   [RFC2076] currently lists
    \"phone\" as an Internet message header which\n   would hold the originating party's
    telephone number, but it is listed\n   as \"non-standard\", i.e., usage of this
    header is not generally\n   recommended.  It also has no defined format, making
    the information\n   unparsable.  There is no similar entry for the originator's
    name.\n   It is proposed that two new message header fields be included to hold\n
    \  this information, namely the Calling Line Identification (\"Caller-\n   ID\")
    and Caller Name (\"Caller-Name\").\n"

  title: 2.  Conventions Used in this Document
- contents:
  - "3.  Calling Line Identification Field\n   The Calling Line Identification header
    (\"Caller-ID\") holds sufficient\n   information for the recipient's voice mail
    system to call back, or\n   reply to, the sender of the message.  The number that
    is contained in\n   this header is supplied by the telephone system.  The exact
    format of\n   the data received depends on the type of call, that is -- internal
    or\n   external call.\n   Note that for both options, the number field MUST contain
    only the\n   digits of the number and MUST be representable using the American\n
    \  Standard Code for Information Interchange [ASCII] character set; it\n   does
    not include any separating character (e.g., \"-\").\n   It is expected that default,
    likely to be the most common case, will\n   not have any numbering plan semantic
    associated with the number.\n   However, in the case that it is known, an optional
    \"NumberingPlan\"\n   parameter MAY be used to indicate the semantic.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Internal Call\n   For an internal call (e.g., between two extensions
      within the same\n   company), it is sufficient to relay only the extension of
      the calling\n   party, based on the company dialing plan.\n   However, the support
      of longer numbers may be supported by the\n   enterprise phone system.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Internal Call
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  External Call\n   For an international call, the calling party's number
      must be the\n   full international number as described in [E.164], i.e., Country
      Code\n   (CC), National Destination Code (NDC), and Subscriber Number (SN).\n
      \  Other information, such as prefixes or symbols (e.g., \"+\"), MUST NOT\n
      \  be included.  [E.164] allows for numbers of up to 15 digits.\n   For a call
      within North America, it is also suggested that 15 digits\n   per [T1.625] be
      supported.  However, some service providers may only\n   support 10 digits as
      described in [T1.401] and [GR-31-CORE].  Though\n   it is desirable that an
      international number not be truncated to 10\n   digits if it contains more,
      it is recognized that limitations of\n   various systems will cause this to
      happen.\n   Implementors of this specification should be aware that some phone\n
      \  systems are known to truncate international numbers, even though this\n   behavior
      is undesirable.\n   Note that the other defined fields available to non-analog
      systems\n   (e.g., subaddress, redirecting number), as well as the meta-data,
      are\n   not intended to be stored in this header.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Numbering Plan\n   In this baseline case (i.e., analog lines), no numbering
      plan\n   information is known or implied.  However, in the case that a\n   numbering
      plan is known, an optional \"NumberingPlan\" parameter MAY be\n   used to indicate
      the semantic.  Only three semantics are defined:\n   \"unknown\", \"local\",
      and \"e164\".  \"unknown\" is the default if no\n   numbering plan semantic
      is known (and the default if the parameter is\n   absent).  \"local\" has meaning
      only within the domain of the voice\n   mail system that stored the message
      (i.e., the voice mail system\n   knows that the number belongs to a local numbering
      plan).  \"e164\"\n   indicates that the number is as described in [E.164].  \"x-\"
      may be\n   used to indicate enterprise or service specific dialing plans.\n"

    - "3.4.  Date Header\n   The date and time may be included by the telephone system
      with the\n   calling party's telephone number per [T1.401].  This MAY be used,
      as\n   there is an existing \"Date\" Internet header to hold this information.\n
      \  It is a local implementation decision whether this time or the local\n   system
      time will be recorded in the \"Date\" header.\n"

  - "4.  Caller Name Field\n   The name of the person sending the message is also
    important.\n   Information about whether the call is internal or external may
    be\n   included if it is available.  This information may not be available\n   on
    international calls.\n   Further, the exact format for this field is typically
    a service\n   provider option per [T1.641].  It is possible for the caller's name\n
    \  to be sent in one of several character sets depending on the service\n   provider
    signaling transport (e.g., ISDN-UP, SCCP, TCAP).  These\n   include:\n      1)
    International Reference Alphabet (IRA), formerly know as\n         International
    Alphabet No.5 or IA5 [T.50]\n      2) Latin Alphabet No. 1 [8859-1]\n      3)
    American National Standard Code for Information Interchange\n         [ASCII]\n
    \     4) Character Sets for the International Teletex Service [T.61]\n   Of these,
    the IRA and T.61 character sets contain a number of options\n   that help specify
    national and application oriented versions.  If\n   there is no agreement between
    parties to use these options, then the\n   7-bit character set in which the graphical
    characters of IRA, T.61,\n   and ASCII are coded exactly the same, will be assumed.
    \ Further, the\n   7-bit graphical characters of [8859-1] are the same as in [ASCII].\n
    \  Note that for delivery to customer equipment in North America, the\n   calling
    name MUST be presented in ASCII per [T1.401].\n   As a result, for the caller
    name header defined in this document,\n   characters are represented with ASCII
    characters.  However, if a name\n   is received that cannot be represented in
    7-bit ASCII, it MAY be\n   stored using its native character set as defined in
    [RFC2047].\n   In telephone networks, the length of the name field MUST NOT exceed\n
    \  50 characters, as defined in [T1.641].  However, service providers\n   may
    choose to further limit this to 15 characters for delivery to\n   customer equipment,
    e.g., [T1.401] and [GR-1188-CORE].\n"

      headers are to record telephone number that is\n   sent by the analog phone
      system with an incoming call without\n   alteration or interpretation.  If sufficient
      semantic is known or can\n   be inferred, this may be included in the NumberingPlan
      field.  This\n   may allow it to be later translated into an addressable phone
      number.\n   Addressable or dialable phone numbers (which this document does

      or telephone URL [RFC2806].\n"

    - "6.2.  Usage\n   There are a few scenarios of how this mechanism may fail that
      must be\n   considered.  The first is mentioned in section 3.2 - the truncation\n
      \  of an international number to 10 digits.  This could result in a\n   misinterpretation
      of the resulting number.  For instance, an\n   international number (e.g., from
      Ireland) of the form \"353 91 73\n   3307\" could be truncated to \"53 91 73
      3307\" if received in North\n   America, and interpreted as \"539 917 3307\"
      - a seemingly \"North\n   American\" style number.  Thus, the recipient is left
      with incorrect\n   information to reply to the message, possibly with an annoyed
      callee\n   at the North American number.\n   The second scenario is the possibility
      of sending an internal\n   extension to an external recipient when a Call Answer
      message is\n   forwarded.  This poses two problems, the recipient is given the
      wrong\n   phone number, and the company's dialing plan could be exposed.\n   The
      final concern deals with exercising character options that are\n   available
      in coding the Calling Name field.  An international system\n   may send a message
      with coding options that are not available on the\n   receiving system, thus
      giving the recipient an incorrect Caller Name.\n"

    exchanged\n   between service providers.\n   However, it must also be noted that
