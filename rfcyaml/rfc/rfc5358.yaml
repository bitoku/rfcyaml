  - "1.  Introduction\n   Recently, DNS [RFC1034] has been named as a major factor\
    \ in the\n   generation of massive amounts of network traffic used in Denial of\n\
    \   Service (DoS) attacks.  These attacks, called reflector attacks, are\n   not\
    \ due to any particular flaw in the design of the DNS or its\n   implementations,\
    \ except that DNS relies heavily on UDP, the easy\n   abuse of which is at the\
    \ source of the problem.  The attacks have\n   preferentially used DNS due to\
    \ common default configurations that\n   allow for easy use of open recursive\
    \ nameservers that make use of\n   such a default configuration.\n   In addition,\
    \ due to the small query-large response potential of the\n   DNS system, it is\
    \ easy to yield great amplification of the source\n   traffic as reflected traffic\
    \ towards the victims.\n   DNS authoritative servers that do not provide recursion\
    \ to clients\n   can also be used as amplifiers; however, the amplification potential\n\
    \   is greatly reduced when authoritative servers are used.  It is also\n   impractical\
    \ to restrict access to authoritative servers to a subset\n   of the Internet,\
    \ since their normal operation relies on them being\n   able to serve a wide audience;\
    \ hence, the opportunities to mitigate\n   the scale of an attack by modifying\
    \ authoritative server\n   configurations are limited.  This document's recommendations\
    \ are\n   concerned with recursive nameservers only.\n   In this document we describe\
    \ the characteristics of the attack and\n   recommend DNS server configurations\
    \ that specifically alleviate the\n   problem described, while pointing to the\
    \ only real solution: the\n   wide-scale deployment of ingress filtering to prevent\
    \ use of spoofed\n   IP addresses [BCP38].\n"

- title: 3.  Problem Description
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Description\n   Because most DNS traffic is stateless by design,\
    \ an attacker could\n   start a DoS attack in the following way:\n   1.  The attacker\
    \ starts by configuring a record on any zone he has\n       access to, normally\
    \ with large RDATA and Time to Live (TTL).\n   2.  Taking advantage of clients\
    \ on non-BCP38 networks, the attacker\n       then crafts a query using the source\
    \ address of their target\n       victim and sends it to an open recursive nameserver.\n\
    \   3.  Each open recursive nameserver proceeds with the resolution,\n       caches\
    \ the record, and finally sends it to the target.  After\n       this first lookup,\
    \ access to the authoritative nameservers is\n       normally no longer necessary.\
    \  The record will remain cached at\n       the open recursive nameserver for\
    \ the duration of the TTL, even\n       if it's deleted from the zone.\n   4.\
    \  Cleanup of the zone might, depending on the implementation used\n       in\
    \ the open recursive nameserver, afford a way to clean the\n       cached record\
    \ from the open recursive nameserver.  This would\n       possibly involve queries\
    \ luring the open recursive nameserver to\n       lookup information for the same\
    \ name that is being used in the\n       amplification.\n   Because the characteristics\
    \ of the attack normally involve a low\n   volume of packets amongst all the kinds\
    \ of actors besides the victim,\n   it's unlikely any one of them would notice\
    \ their involvement based on\n   traffic pattern changes.\n   Taking advantage\
    \ of an open recursive nameserver that supports EDNS0\n   [RFC2671], the amplification\
    \ factor (response packet size / query\n   packet size) could be around 80.  With\
    \ this amplification factor, a\n   relatively small army of clients and open recursive\
    \ nameservers could\n   generate gigabits of traffic towards the victim.\n   With\
    \ the increasing length of authoritative DNS responses derived\n   from deployment\
    \ of DNSSEC [RFC4033] and NAPTR resource records as\n   used in ENUM services,\
    \ authoritative servers will eventually be more\n   useful as actors in this sort\
    \ of amplification attack.\n   Even if this amplification attack is only possible\
    \ due to non-\n   deployment of BCP38, it is easier to leverage because of historical\n\
    \   reasons.  When the Internet was a much closer-knit community, some\n   nameserver\
    \ implementations were made available with default\n   configurations that, when\
    \ used for recursive nameservers, made the\n   server accessible to all hosts\
    \ on the Internet.\n   For years this was a convenient and helpful configuration,\
    \ enabling\n   wider availability of services.  As this document aims to make\n\
    \   apparent, it is now much better to be conscious of one's own\n   nameserver\
    \ services and focus the delivery of services on the\n   intended audience of\
    \ those services -- be they a university campus,\n   an enterprise, or an ISP's\
    \ customers.  The target audience also\n   includes operators of small networks\
    \ and private server managers who\n   decide to operate nameservers with the aim\
    \ of optimising their DNS\n   service, as these are more likely to use default\
    \ configurations as\n   shipped by implementors.\n"
- title: 4.  Recommended Configuration
  contents:
  - "4.  Recommended Configuration\n   In this section we describe the Best Current\
    \ Practice for operating\n   recursive nameservers.  Following these recommendations\
    \ would reduce\n   the chances of any given recursive nameserver being used for\
    \ the\n   generation of an amplification attack.\n   The generic recommendation\
    \ to nameserver operators is to use the\n   means provided by the implementation\
    \ of choice to provide recursive\n   name lookup service to only the intended\
    \ clients.  Client\n   authorization can usually be done in several ways:\n  \
    \ o  IP address based authorization.  Use the IP source address of the\n     \
    \ DNS queries and filter them through an Access Control List (ACL)\n      to service\
    \ only the intended clients.  This is easily applied if\n      the recursive nameserver's\
    \ service area is a reasonably fixed IP\n      address range that is protected\
    \ against external address spoofing,\n      usually the local network.\n   o \
    \ Incoming interface based selection.  Use the incoming interface\n      for the\
    \ query as a discriminator to select which clients are to be\n      served.  This\
    \ is of particular applicability for SOHO (Small\n      Office, Home Office) devices,\
    \ such as broadband routers that\n      include embedded recursive nameservers.\n\
    \   o  TSIG [RFC2845] or SIG(0) [RFC2931] signed queries to authenticate\n   \
    \   the clients.  This is a less error prone method that allows server\n     \
    \ operators to provide service to clients who change IP address\n      frequently\
    \ (e.g., roaming clients).  The current drawback of this\n      method is that\
    \ very few stub resolver implementations support TSIG\n      or SIG(0) signing\
    \ of outgoing queries.  The effective use of this\n      method implies, in most\
    \ cases, running a local instance of a\n      caching nameserver or forwarder\
    \ that will be able to TSIG sign the\n      queries and send them on to the recursive\
    \ nameserver of choice.\n   o  For mobile users, use a local caching nameserver\
    \ running on the\n      mobile device or use a Virtual Private Network to a trusted\n\
    \      server.\n   In nameservers that do not need to be providing recursive service,\n\
    \   for instance servers that are meant to be authoritative only, turn\n   recursion\
    \ off completely.  In general, it is a good idea to keep\n   recursive and authoritative\
    \ services separate as much as practical.\n   This, of course, depends on local\
    \ circumstances.\n   Even with all these recommendations, network operators should\n\
    \   consider deployment of ingress filtering [BCP38] in routers to\n   prevent\
    \ use of address spoofing as a viable course of action.  In\n   situations where\
    \ more complex network setups are in place, \"Ingress\n   Filtering for Multihomed\
    \ Network\" [BCP84] maybe a useful additional\n   reference.\n   By default, nameservers\
    \ SHOULD NOT offer recursive service to\n   external networks.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not create any new security\
    \ issues for the DNS\n   protocol, it deals with a weakness in implementations.\n\
    \   Deployment of SIG(0) transaction security [RFC2931] should consider\n   the\
    \ caveats with SIG(0) computational expense as it uses public key\n   cryptography\
    \ rather than the symmetric keys used by TSIG [RFC2845].\n   In addition, the\
    \ identification of the appropriate keys needs similar\n   mechanisms as those\
    \ for deploying TSIG or, alternatively, the use of\n   DNSSEC [RFC4033] signatures\
    \ (RRSIGs) over the KEY RRs if published in\n   DNS.  This will in turn require\
    \ the appropriate management of DNSSEC\n   trust anchors.\n"
