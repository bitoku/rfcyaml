  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The IPv6 address space will be managed by the IANA for the good\
    \ of\n   the Internet community, with advice from the IAB and the IESG, by\n \
    \  delegation to the regional registries.\n"
- title: Statement
  contents:
  - "Statement\n   The IPv6 address space must be managed for the good of the Internet\n\
    \   community.  Good management requires at least a small element of\n   central\
    \ authority over the delegation and allocation of the address\n   space.\n   The\
    \ Internet community recognizes the Internet Assigned Numbers\n   Authority (IANA)\
    \ as the appropriate entity to have the responsibility\n   for the management\
    \ of the IPv6 address space.\n   The IANA will rely on the advice of the Internet\
    \ Architecture Board\n   (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)\
    \ in the\n   management of the IPv6 address space.\n   The IANA will delegate\
    \ to regional (and other) registries the task of\n   making specific address allocations\
    \ to network service providers and\n   other subregional registries.  Individuals\
    \ and organizations may\n   obtain address allocations directly from the appropriate\
    \ regional (or\n   other) registry, or from their service provider.\n   Delegation\
    \ of address space by the IANA is not irrevocable. If, in\n   the judgement of\
    \ the IANA, a registry has seriously mishandled the\n   address space delegated\
    \ to it, the IANA may revoke the delegation,\n   with due notice and with due\
    \ consideration of the operational\n   implications.  IANA will make every effort\
    \ in such a case not to\n   revoke addresses that are in active use, unless there\
    \ are\n   overwhelming technical reasons for doing so.\n   Any revenues (such\
    \ as transaction fees) received with respect to the\n   IPv6 address space should\
    \ be used only for expenses related to\n   registry activities, and not to subsidize\
    \ any other activities.\n   There will be no charges for the address space itself,\
    \ only fees to\n   recover the registry costs.\n   Any situation in the management\
    \ of the IPv6 address space that leads\n   to monopoly control or predatory practices\
    \ must be avoided.\n   The IANA will develop a plan for the initial IPv6 address\
    \ allocation,\n   including a provision for the automatic allocation of IPv6 addresses\n\
    \   to holders of IPv4 addresses. IANA will also develop mediation and\n   appeals\
    \ procedures concerning delegation and revocation.\n"
