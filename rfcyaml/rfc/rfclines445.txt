This note presents the current IMP/TIP Preventive Maintenance schedule.
Preventive Maintenance is scheduled on a monthly basis, and a given machine is normally scheduled at the same time each month; wherever possible the time is chosen to coincide with the PM time for the Host(s) at the site.
It is sometimes necessary to reschedule PM's because of network connectivity considerations or for other reasons.
Whenever such rescheduling occurs, we will announce the fact as soon as possible via two mechanisms the TIP NEWS and a Journal note (NOT an RFC) to Technical Liaisons.
Any permanent changes to the schedule will be announced via the RFC mechanism.
All times show below are Eastern Time.
