A one byte DATA TYPE signal is sent as the first byte of data over a connection.
A default is employed if the first byte over a connection has the high order bit set to zero, and it is assumed that the seven bit ASCII NVT convention will be employed.
After initial connection, the DATA TYPE may be changed (see code X'88').
Most implementations and applications may expect the DATA TYPES to be symmetrical at any point in time,(i.e.
both using a serving site using the same DATA TYPE.).
A site receiving a DATA TYPE signal is to respond with a double X'88' if the new DATA TYPE is acceptable.
