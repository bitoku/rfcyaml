  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6718] describes the framework and requirements for pseudowire\n
    \  (PW) redundancy, and [RFC6870] specifies a PW redundancy mechanism\n   for
    scenarios where a set of redundant PWs are configured between\n   Provider Edge
    (PE) nodes in Single-Segment Pseudowire (SS-PW)\n   [RFC3985] applications, or
    between Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE)\n   nodes in Multi-Segment Pseudowire
    (MS-PW) [RFC5659] applications.\n   In some MS-PW scenarios, there are benefits
    of providing PW\n   redundancy on Switching Provider Edges (S-PEs), such as reducing
    the\n   burden on the access T-PE nodes and enabling faster protection\n   switching
    compared to the end-to-end MS-PW protection mechanisms.\n   This document describes
    some scenarios in which PW redundancy is\n   provided on S-PEs and specifies the
    operations of the S-PEs.  The\n   S-PEs connect to the neighboring T-PEs or S-PEs
    with PW segments.\n   For the S-PE that provides PW redundancy for an MS-PW, there
    is a\n   single PW segment on one side, which is called the single-homed side,\n
    \  and there are multiple PW segments on the other side, which is called\n   the
    multi-homed side.  The scenario in which the S-PE has two multi-\n   homed sides
    is out of scope.  Signaling of the Preferential\n   Forwarding status as defined

      \                   Figure 1: MS-PW Redundancy on S-PE\n   As illustrated in
      Figure 1, Customer Edge (CE) node CE1 is connected\n   to T-PE1 while CE2 is
      dual-homed to T-PE2 and T-PE3.  T-PE1 is\n   connected to S-PE1 only, and S-PE1
      is connected to both T-PE2 and\n   T-PE3.  The MS-PW is switched on S-PE1, and
      PW segments PW-Seg2 and\n   PW-Seg3 provide resiliency on S-PE1 for the failure
      of T-PE2, T-PE3,\n   or the connected Attachment Circuits (ACs).  PW-Seg2 is
      selected as\n   the primary PW segment, and PW-Seg3 is the secondary PW segment.\n
      \  MS-PW redundancy on S-PE is beneficial for the scenario in Figure 1\n   since
      T-PE1 as an access node may not support PW redundancy.\n   Besides, with PW
      redundancy on S-PE, the number of PW segments\n   required between T-PE1 and
      S-PE1 is only half of the number of PW\n   segments needed when end-to-end MS-PW
      redundancy is used.  In\n   addition, in this scenario, PW redundancy on S-PE
      could provide\n   faster protection switching, compared with end-to-end protection\n
      \  switching of MS-PW.\n"

      \  As illustrated in Figure 2, CE1 is connected to T-PE1 while CE2 is\n   dual-homed

      that are switched at S-PE1 and S-PE2,\n   respectively, to provide S-PE node
      protection.  For PW1, S-PE1\n   provides resiliency using PW1-Seg2 and PW1-Seg3.
      \ For PW2, S-PE2\n   provides resiliency using PW2-Seg2 and PW2-Seg3.  PW1 is

  - "3.  S-PE Operations\n   For an S-PE that provides PW redundancy for MS-PW, it
    is important to\n   advertise the proper preferential forwarding status to the
    PW\n   segments on both sides and perform protection switching according to\n
    \  the received status information.  Note that when PW redundancy for\n   MS-PW
    is provided on S-PE, the optional S-PE Bypass mode as defined\n   in [RFC6478]
    MUST NOT be used; otherwise, the S-PE will not receive\n   the PW status messages
    originated by T-PEs.  This section specifies\n   the operations of S-PEs on which
    PW redundancy is provisioned.  This\n   section does not make any change to the
    T-PEs of MS-PW.\n   The S-PEs connect to the neighboring T-PEs or other S-PEs
    on two\n   sides with PW segments.  For the S-PE that provides PW redundancy for\n
    \  an MS-PW, on one side there is a single PW segment, which is called\n   the
    single-homed side, and on the other side there are multiple PW\n   segments, which
    is called the multi-homed side.  The scenario in\n   which the S-PE has two multi-homed
    sides is out of scope.\n   The S-PE that provides PW redundancy MUST work in Slave
    mode for the\n   single-homed side, and MUST work in Independent mode for the
    multi-\n   homed side.  Consequently, the T-PE on the single-homed side MUST\n
    \  work in the Master mode, and the T-PEs on the multi-homed side MUST\n   work
    in the Independent mode.  The signaling of the Preferential\n   Forwarding bit
    as defined in [RFC6870] and [RFC6478] is reused.\n   The S-PE MUST pass the Preferential
    Forwarding status received from\n   the single-homed side unchanged to all the
    PW segments on the multi-\n   homed side.  The S-PE MUST advertise the Standby
    Preferential\n   Forwarding status to the single-homed side if it receives Standby\n
    \  status from all the PW segments on the multi-homed side, and it MUST\n   advertise
    the Active Preferential Forwarding status to the single-\n   homed side if it
    receives Active status from any of the PW segments\n   on the multi-homed side.
    \ For the single-homed side, the active PW\n   segment is determined by the T-PE
    on this side, which works in the\n   Master mode.  On the multi-homed side, since
    both the S-PE and T-PEs\n   work in the Independent mode, the PW segment which
    has both the local\n   and remote Up/Down status as Up and both the local and
    remote\n   Preferential Forwarding status as Active MUST be selected for traffic\n
    \  forwarding.  When a switchover happens on the S-PE, if the S-PE\n   supports
    the SP-PE TLV processing as defined in [RFC6073], it SHOULD\n   advertise the
    updated SP-PE TLVs by sending a Label Mapping message\n   to the T-PEs.\n"

      the Active\n   Preferential Forwarding status bit on the single-homed side from\n
      \  T-PE1, then it would advertise the Active Preferential Forwarding\n   status
      bit on both PW-Seg2 and PW-Seg3.  T-PE2 and T-PE3 would\n   advertise the Active
      and Standby Preferential Forwarding status bit\n   to S-PE1, respectively, reflecting
      the forwarding state of the two\n   ACs connected to CE2.  By matching the local
      and remote Up/Down\n   status and Preferential Forwarding status, PW-Seg2 would

      Up/Down Status\n   and Preferential Forwarding status, PW1-Seg2 from S-PE1 to

      have any Active PW segment on the multi-homed\n   side.\n   On failure of the
      AC between CE2 and T-PE2, the forwarding state of\n   AC on T-PE3 is changed
      to Active.  T-PE3 would then advertise the\n   Active Preferential Forwarding
