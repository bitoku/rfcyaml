  - "1. Abstract\n   This RFC is meant to represent a guideline by which the IETF\n\
    \   conferences may run more effeciently with regards to identification\n   and\
    \ security protocols, with specific attention paid to a particular\n   sub-group\
    \ within the IETF: \"facial hairius extremis\".\n   This document will shed further\
    \ illumination on these problems and\n   provide some possible solutions.\n  \
    \ This memo provides entertainment for the Internet community.  It does\n   not\
    \ specify an Internet standard of any kind, but is rather\n   unstandard, actually.\
    \  Please laugh loud and hard.\n"
- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   It has come to the attention of THEY [1] that a certain \"\
    facial\n   hairius extremesis\" of the male variety of the species \"homo sapien\"\
    \n   of the sub-culture \"computeris extrordinarisis\" have overrun the IETF\n\
    \   conferences and thus led to the break-down of many identification and\n  \
    \ safety protocols.\n"
- title: 3. Per Capita (Anecdotal) Evidence
  contents:
  - "3. Per Capita (Anecdotal) Evidence\n   While collecting research about the sub-group\
    \ \"facial hairius\n   extremis\" (FHE), it was noted that the per capita appearance\
    \ of FHEs\n   at IETFs was largely disproportional with the existence of FHEs\
    \ in\n   the world-at-large.  In fact, the existence of facial hair at all\n \
    \  within the IETF community is extraordinarily common among the males\n   of\
    \ the group.  Apart from ZZ-Top and WWF Wrestling, it is not\n   possible to find\
    \ more facial hair within any occupational group.  In\n   this author's own experience\
    \ the average amount of men with long-term\n   facial hair is less than 20%. \
    \ Long-term versus short-term facial\n   hair is a very important distinction\
    \ as short-term facial hair, also\n   known as the temporary illness \"goatee\
    \ universitis\" (which symptoms\n   range from full goatees to the less popular\
    \ chin-goatee) is a common\n   affliction for university-based males.  Per capita\
    \ (temporary) facial\n   hair can go as high as 40%.  However, among the males\
    \ of the IETF the\n   per capita long-term facial hair is as high as 60% [2].\n\
    \   Ordinarily, this abundance of long-term FHE would not require that an\n  \
    \ RFC be written.  However, increasingly there have been issues\n   regarding\
    \ mistaken identification.  For security purposes as well as\n   ease of identification,\
    \ this RFC will serve to clarify these issues\n   and hopefully provide a solution\
    \ for them.\n"
- title: 4. Mistaken Identification Syndrome (or "Are you --jon. or Scott?")
  contents:
  - "4. Mistaken Identification Syndrome (or \"Are you --jon. or Scott?\")\n   I was\
    \ speaking to a very well-known network researcher, I'll call him\n   --jon.,\
    \ who tells me that he is often mistaken for a SOBbing Harvard\n   person.  --jon.\
    \ says, \"People tell someone to look for me or him and\n   say that I'm about\
    \ so-tall with a big white beard, and suddenly\n   people are coming up to me\
    \ and saying, 'Hi Scott' and he often tells\n   me that he is mistakenly hailed\
    \ as, '--jon.'.  Often the mistake is\n   made solely on the appearance of our\
    \ facial hair.\"\n   Another story --jon. told me is that once a woman called\
    \ looking for\n   a computer researcher but only having a first name and physical\n\
    \   description.  The receiptionist asked for the description and the\n   woman\
    \ said she was looking for an older Caucasian man with a beard.\n   The receptionist\
    \ reportedly blurted out, \"they all have beards!!!!\"\n   On a more personal\
    \ note, two researchers who were both employed at\n   USC/ISI shaved their very\
    \ famous facial hair and were both\n   unrecognizable to friends and co-workers\
    \ alike.  If it weren't for\n   B.M.'s Grateful Dead T-shirts and lack of shoes,\
    \ or R.V.M.'s voice I\n   would have never recognized them.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   It is obvious to this researcher that facial hair\
    \ of any variety is a\n   very recognizable characteristic.  Indeed, when giving\
    \ a description\n   of a male who has facial hair, it is always one of the first\n\
    \   characteristics given.  Ordinarily this would not be a problem, since\n  \
    \ facial hair in the world at large is below 20%.  However, when used\n   as a\
    \ description at IETFs, disaster can insue.\n"
- title: 6. Solutions
  contents:
  - "6. Solutions\n   There are two parts to my proposed solution: the role of the\
    \ seeker\n   and the role of the FHE.\n   For those who are seeking a FHE of known\
    \ identity:\n      -It is important to recognize these men as individuals.\n \
    \        Just because a man has the facial hair you are looking for,\n       \
    \  please stop to inquire if you have the correct person.  Think\n         of\
    \ what a blow it is to a person's ego to be constantly\n         misidentified,\
    \ and think of how annoying it is to be hailed by\n         someone across a crowded\
    \ IETF room and they are yelling the\n         WRONG NAME.  So remember to look,\
    \ identify, and ask BEFORE you\n         begin rambling on about some Internet\
    \ stuff.\n   For the FHE:\n      -Give proper signals when being sought.\n   \
    \      If someone mistakenly calls you the wrong name, do not lose\n         heart.\
    \  Count to 10 and commonly reply, \"You must have mistaken\n         me for so-and-so,\
    \ I am not that person.\", and walk away.  Also,\n         if someone calls you\
    \ from across a room, raise your your arm,\n         smile and wave vigorously\
    \ in affirmation or raise your arm,\n         shake your head and give them a\
    \ sign that you are not who they\n         are looking for.  As an FHE it is part\
    \ of your responsibility\n         to understand that facial hair is an extremely\
    \ identifiable\n         physical characteristic.  Understand that non-FHE people\
    \ do not\n         mean any harm.\n"

    \ raised\n   some interesting points.  I also hope that I was able to further\
