  - "1. Introduction\n   This document defines terms that are to be used in a methodology\
    \ that\n   determines the IP packet forwarding performance of IP routers as a\n\
    \   function of the forwarding information base installed within the\n   router.\n\
    \   The objective of this methodology is to evaluate the performance\n   levels\
    \ of IP routers as forwarding information bases continue to grow\n   in size and\
    \ complexity of structure.\n   This methodology utilizes the packet forwarding\
    \ performance\n   measurements described in [2]; reference will also be made to\
    \ the\n   associated terminology document [3] for these terms.\n"
- title: 2. Overview
  contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   In order to measure the forwarding information base-based router\n\
    \   performance, different forwarding information bases (5.3) are\n   installed\
    \ in the router.  The two key elements describing the FIB are\n   the FIB size\
    \ (5.5) and FIB prefix distribution (5.7).  The forwarding\n   performance of\
    \ a router may be dependent upon these two primary\n   factors, particularly if\
    \ FIB prefix distributions tend towards longer\n   network prefixes (5.1).  The\
    \ FIB-dependent throughput, latency and\n   frame loss rate (6.3, 6.4, 6.5), measured\
    \ with fully meshed traffic\n   flows [2], will reflect the change in performance\
    \ of the router.\n   Tests may need to be performed up to the maximum FIB size\
    \ (6.1).\n   When configuring the router for these measurements, the routes need\n\
    \   to be manually entered into the router, or advertised via a routing\n   protocol.\
    \  It may take some period of time (the FIB learning time\n   (6.2)) before the\
    \ router learns all the routes.\n   When routes are advertised into the router,\
    \ the routes should be\n   advertised in such a way so that route aggregation\
    \ (5.10) does not\n   occur.  Also, the effect of a per-interface FIB cache (5.9)\
    \ needs to\n   be taken into account.\n"

    \ definition is taken directly from section 2.2.5.2,\n      \"Classless Inter\
    \ Domain Routing (CIDR)\", in [4].)\n   Discussion:\n      In the CIDR context,\
    \ the network prefix is the network component\n      of an IP address.  A common\
    \ alternative to using a bitwise mask to\n      communicate this component is\
    \ the use of \"slash (/) notation.\"\n      Slash notation binds the notion of\
    \ network prefix length (see 5.2)\n      in bits to an IP address. E.g., 141.184.128.0/17\
    \ indicates the\n      network component of this IPv4 address is 17 bits wide.\n\

    \  The longer the network\n      prefix length, the longer it will take for a\

    \   Discussion:\n      Prior to installing a complete copy of the forwarding information\n\
    \      base on each interface of a router, a popular technique for\n      speeding\
    \ destination address lookups is to install a cache of\n      frequently used\
    \ routes on a router's interface.\n      The most frequently used routes are placed\
    \ in the forwarding\n      information base cache.  IP packets whose destination\
    \ address does\n      not match a network prefix within the per-interface forwarding\n\
    \      information base cache are forwarded to a router's central\n      processor\
    \ for lookup in the complete forwarding information base.\n      The implication\
    \ for benchmarking the performance of a router as a\n      function of the forwarding\
    \ information base is significant.  IP\n      packets whose destination address\
    \ matches an entry within the\n      per-interface forwarding information base\
    \ cache could be forwarded\n      more quickly than packets whose destination\
    \ address does not match\n      an entry within the per-interface forwarding information\
    \ base\n      cache.\n      To create useful benchmarks, the role of a per-interface\n\
    \      forwarding cache needs to be considered.  The nature of\n      benchmarking\
    \ tests to measure the impact of the forwarding\n      performance of a router\
    \ requires that the destination addresses\n      within IP packets transmitted\
    \ into the router be distributed\n      amongst the total set of network prefixes\
    \ advertised into the\n      router.  This negates the role of a per-interface\
    \ forwarding\n      information base cache, but serves to stress the forwarding\n\

  contents:
  - "5.10 Route Aggregation\n   Definition:\n      The ability of a router to collapse\
    \ many forwarding information\n      base entries into a single entry.\n   Discussion:\n\
    \      A router may aggregate routes in a forwarding information base\n      into\
    \ a single entry to conserve space.\n      When advertising routes into a router\
    \ to perform benchmarking\n      tests as a function of the forwarding information\
    \ base installed\n      within the router, it is necessary to ensure that a router\
    \ does\n      not aggregate routes.\n      Thus, when routes are advertised to\
    \ the router or installed\n      statically, care must be taken to ensure that\
    \ the router does not\n      aggregate routes.\n      For example, if advertising\
    \ a set of /24 network prefixes into a\n      particular port on the router, 256\
    \ consecutive /24 routes, sharing\n      a common leading 16 bits, should not\
    \ be advertised on a single\n      port.  If this is done, then the router will\

    \ that all\n      networks matching a particular /16 network prefix are accessible\n\
    \      through one particular entry.\n      Route aggregation on a router can\
    \ be turned off, but routes should\n      still be advertised into the router\
