  - 'This RFC is an introduction to the Domain Name System (DNS), and omits

    '
  - 'many details which can be found in a companion RFC, "Domain Names -

    '
  - 'Implementation and Specification" [RFC-1035].  That RFC assumes that the

    '
  - 'reader is familiar with the concepts discussed in this memo.

    '
  - 'A subset of DNS functions and data types constitute an official

    '
  - 'protocol.  The official protocol includes standard queries and their

    '
  - 'responses and most of the Internet class data formats (e.g., host

    '
  - 'addresses).

    '
  - 'However, the domain system is intentionally extensible.  Researchers are

    '
  - 'continuously proposing, implementing and experimenting with new data

    '
  - 'types, query types, classes, functions, etc.  Thus while the components

    '
  - 'of the official protocol are expected to stay essentially unchanged and

    '
  - 'operate as a production service, experimental behavior should always be

    '
  - 'expected in extensions beyond the official protocol.  Experimental or

    '
  - 'obsolete features are clearly marked in these RFCs, and such information

    '
  - 'should be used with caution.

    - '2.1. The history of domain names

      '
    - 'The impetus for the development of the domain system was growth in the

      '
    - "Internet:\n   - Host name to address mappings were maintained by the Network\n
      \    Information Center (NIC) in a single file (HOSTS.TXT) which\n     was FTPed
      by all hosts [RFC-952, RFC-953].  The total network\n     bandwidth consumed
      in distributing a new version by this\n     scheme is proportional to the square
      of the number of hosts in\n     the network, and even when multiple levels of
      FTP are used,\n     the outgoing FTP load on the NIC host is considerable.\n
      \    Explosive growth in the number of hosts didn't bode well for\n     the
      future.\n   - The network population was also changing in character.  The\n
      \    timeshared hosts that made up the original ARPANET were being\n     replaced
      with local networks of workstations.  Local\n     organizations were administering
      their own names and\n     addresses, but had to wait for the NIC to change HOSTS.TXT
      to\n     make changes visible to the Internet at large.  Organizations\n     also
      wanted some local structure on the name space.\n   - The applications on the
      Internet were getting more\n     sophisticated and creating a need for general
      purpose name\n     service.\n"
    - 'The result was several ideas about name spaces and their management

      '
    - '[IEN-116, RFC-799, RFC-819, RFC-830].  The proposals varied, but a

      '
    - 'common thread was the idea of a hierarchical name space, with the

      '
    - 'hierarchy roughly corresponding to organizational structure, and names

      '
    - 'using "."  as the character to mark the boundary between hierarchy

      '
    - 'levels.  A design using a distributed database and generalized resources

      '
    - 'was described in [RFC-882, RFC-883].  Based on experience with several

      '
    - 'implementations, the system evolved into the scheme described in this

      '
    - 'memo.

      '
    - 'The terms "domain" or "domain name" are used in many contexts beyond the

      '
    - 'DNS described here.  Very often, the term domain name is used to refer

      '
    - 'to a name with structure indicated by dots, but no relation to the DNS.

    - '2.2. DNS design goals

      '
    - "The design goals of the DNS influence its structure.  They are:\n   - The primary
      goal is a consistent name space which will be used\n     for referring to resources.
      \ In order to avoid the problems\n     caused by ad hoc encodings, names should
      not be required to\n     contain network identifiers, addresses, routes, or
      similar\n     information as part of the name.\n   - The sheer size of the database
      and frequency of updates\n     suggest that it must be maintained in a distributed
      manner,\n     with local caching to improve performance.  Approaches that\n
      \    attempt to collect a consistent copy of the entire database\n     will
      become more and more expensive and difficult, and hence\n     should be avoided.
      \ The same principle holds for the structure\n     of the name space, and in
      particular mechanisms for creating\n     and deleting names; these should also
      be distributed.\n   - Where there tradeoffs between the cost of acquiring data,
      the\n     speed of updates, and the accuracy of caches, the source of\n     the
      data should control the tradeoff.\n   - The costs of implementing such a facility
      dictate that it be\n     generally useful, and not restricted to a single application.\n
      \    We should be able to use names to retrieve host addresses,\n     mailbox
      data, and other as yet undetermined information.  All\n     data associated
      with a name is tagged with a type, and queries\n     can be limited to a single
      type.\n   - Because we want the name space to be useful in dissimilar\n     networks
      and applications, we provide the ability to use the\n     same name space with
      different protocol families or\n     management.  For example, host address
      formats differ between\n     protocols, though all protocols have the notion
      of address.\n     The DNS tags all data with a class as well as the type, so\n
      \    that we can allow parallel use of different formats for data\n     of type
      address.\n   - We want name server transactions to be independent of the\n     communications
      system that carries them.  Some systems may\n     wish to use datagrams for
      queries and responses, and only\n     establish virtual circuits for transactions
      that need the\n     reliability (e.g., database updates, long transactions);
      other\n     systems will use virtual circuits exclusively.\n   - The system
      should be useful across a wide spectrum of host\n     capabilities.  Both personal
      computers and large timeshared\n     hosts should be able to use the system,
      though perhaps in\n     different ways.\n"

    - '2.3. Assumptions about usage

      '
    - 'The organization of the domain system derives from some assumptions

      '
    - 'about the needs and usage patterns of its user community and is designed

      '
    - 'to avoid many of the the complicated problems found in general purpose

      '
    - 'database systems.

      '
    - "The assumptions are:\n   - The size of the total database will initially be
      proportional\n     to the number of hosts using the system, but will eventually\n
      \    grow to be proportional to the number of users on those hosts\n     as
      mailboxes and other information are added to the domain\n     system.\n   -
      Most of the data in the system will change very slowly (e.g.,\n     mailbox
      bindings, host addresses), but that the system should\n     be able to deal
      with subsets that change more rapidly (on the\n     order of seconds or minutes).\n
      \  - The administrative boundaries used to distribute\n     responsibility for
      the database will usually correspond to\n     organizations that have one or
      more hosts.  Each organization\n     that has responsibility for a particular
      set of domains will\n     provide redundant name servers, either on the organization's\n
      \    own hosts or other hosts that the organization arranges to\n     use.\n
      \  - Clients of the domain system should be able to identify\n     trusted name
      servers they prefer to use before accepting\n     referrals to name servers
      outside of this \"trusted\" set.\n   - Access to information is more critical
      than instantaneous\n     updates or guarantees of consistency.  Hence the update\n
      \    process allows updates to percolate out through the users of\n     the
      domain system rather than guaranteeing that all copies are\n     simultaneously
      updated.  When updates are unavailable due to\n     network or host failure,
      the usual course is to believe old\n     information while continuing efforts
      to update it.  The\n     general model is that copies are distributed with timeouts
      for\n     refreshing.  The distributor sets the timeout value and the\n     recipient
      of the distribution is responsible for performing\n     the refresh.  In special
      situations, very short intervals can\n     be specified, or the owner can prohibit
      copies.\n   - In any system that has a distributed database, a particular\n
      \    name server may be presented with a query that can only be\n     answered
      by some other server.  The two general approaches to\n     dealing with this
      problem are \"recursive\", in which the first\n     server pursues the query
      for the client at another server, and\n     \"iterative\", in which the server
      refers the client to another\n     server and lets the client pursue the query.
      \ Both approaches\n     have advantages and disadvantages, but the iterative
      approach\n     is preferred for the datagram style of access.  The domain\n
      \    system requires implementation of the iterative approach, but\n     allows
      the recursive approach as an option.\n"
    - 'The domain system assumes that all data originates in master files

      '
    - 'scattered through the hosts that use the domain system.  These master

      '
    - 'files are updated by local system administrators.  Master files are text

      '

      '

      '
    - 'and then arrange with the system administrator of the name server to get

      '
    - 'the files loaded.

      '
    - 'Each host''s name servers and resolvers are configured by a local system

      '

      '
    - 'includes the identity of local master files and instructions on which

    - 'The domain system defines procedures for accessing the data and for

      '

    - '2.4. Elements of the DNS

      '
    - "The DNS has three major components:\n   - The DOMAIN NAME SPACE and RESOURCE
      RECORDS, which are\n     specifications for a tree structured name space and
      data\n     associated with the names.  Conceptually, each node and leaf\n     of
      the domain name space tree names a set of information, and\n     query operations
      are attempts to extract specific types of\n     information from a particular
      set.  A query names the domain\n     name of interest and describes the type
      of resource\n     information that is desired.  For example, the Internet\n
      \    uses some of its domain names to identify hosts; queries for\n     address
      resources return Internet host addresses.\n   - NAME SERVERS are server programs
      which hold information about\n     the domain tree's structure and set information.
      \ A name\n     server may cache structure or set information about any part\n
      \    of the domain tree, but in general a particular name server\n     has complete
      information about a subset of the domain space,\n     and pointers to other
      name servers that can be used to lead to\n     information from any part of
      the domain tree.  Name servers\n     know the parts of the domain tree for which
      they have complete\n     information; a name server is said to be an AUTHORITY
      for\n     these parts of the name space.  Authoritative information is\n     organized
      into units called ZONEs, and these zones can be\n     automatically distributed
      to the name servers which provide\n     redundant service for the data in a
      zone.\n   - RESOLVERS are programs that extract information from name\n     servers
      in response to client requests.  Resolvers must be\n     able to access at least
      one name server and use that name\n     server's information to answer a query
      directly, or pursue the\n     query using referrals to other name servers.  A
      resolver will\n     typically be a system routine that is directly accessible
      to\n     user programs; hence no protocol is necessary between the\n     resolver
      and the user program.\n"
    - 'These three components roughly correspond to the three layers or views

      '
    - "of the domain system:\n   - From the user's point of view, the domain system
      is accessed\n     through a simple procedure or OS call to a local resolver.\n
      \    The domain space consists of a single tree and the user can\n     request
      information from any section of the tree.\n   - From the resolver's point of
      view, the domain system is\n     composed of an unknown number of name servers.
      \ Each name\n     server has one or more pieces of the whole domain tree's data,\n
      \    but the resolver views each of these databases as essentially\n     static.\n
      \  - From a name server's point of view, the domain system consists\n     of
      separate sets of local information called zones.  The name\n     server has
      local copies of some of the zones.  The name server\n     must periodically
      refresh its zones from master copies in\n     local files or foreign name servers.
      \ The name server must\n     concurrently process queries that arrive from resolvers.\n"
    - 'In the interests of performance, implementations may couple these

      '
    - 'functions.  For example, a resolver on the same machine as a name server

      '
    - 'might share a database consisting of the the zones managed by the name

      '
    - 'server and the cache managed by the resolver.

    - 'The domain name space is a tree structure.  Each node and leaf on the

      '
    - 'tree corresponds to a resource set (which may be empty).  The domain

      '
    - 'system makes no distinctions between the uses of the interior nodes and

      '
    - 'leaves, and this memo uses the term "node" to refer to both.

      '
    - 'Each node has a label, which is zero to 63 octets in length.  Brother

      '
    - 'nodes may not have the same label, although the same label can be used

      '
    - 'for nodes which are not brothers.  One label is reserved, and that is

      '
    - 'the null (i.e., zero length) label used for the root.

      '
    - 'The domain name of a node is the list of the labels on the path from the

      '
    - 'node to the root of the tree.  By convention, the labels that compose a

      '
    - 'domain name are printed or read left to right, from the most specific

      '
    - '(lowest, farthest from the root) to the least specific (highest, closest

      '
    - 'to the root).

      '
    - 'Internally, programs that manipulate domain names should represent them

      '
    - 'as sequences of labels, where each label is a length octet followed by

      '
    - 'an octet string.  Because all domain names end at the root, which has a

      '
    - 'null string for a label, these internal representations can use a length

      '
    - 'byte of zero to terminate a domain name.

      '
    - 'By convention, domain names can be stored with arbitrary case, but

      '
    - 'domain name comparisons for all present domain functions are done in a

      '
    - 'case-insensitive manner, assuming an ASCII character set, and a high

      '
    - 'order zero bit.  This means that you are free to create a node with

      '
    - 'label "A" or a node with label "a", but not both as brothers; you could

      '
    - 'refer to either using "a" or "A".  When you receive a domain name or

      '
    - 'label, you should preserve its case.  The rationale for this choice is

      '
    - 'that we may someday need to add full binary domain names for new

      '
    - 'services; existing services would not be changed.

      '
    - 'When a user needs to type a domain name, the length of each label is

      '
    - 'omitted and the labels are separated by dots (".").  Since a complete

      '
    - 'domain name ends with the root label, this leads to a printed form which

      '
    - "ends in a dot.  We use this property to distinguish between:\n   - a character
      string which represents a complete domain name\n     (often called \"absolute\").
      \ For example, \"poneria.ISI.EDU.\"\n   - a character string that represents
      the starting labels of a\n     domain name which is incomplete, and should be
      completed by\n     local software using knowledge of the local domain (often\n
      \    called \"relative\").  For example, \"poneria\" used in the\n     ISI.EDU
      domain.\n"
    - 'Relative names are either taken relative to a well known origin, or to a

      '
    - 'list of domains used as a search list.  Relative names appear mostly at

      '
    - 'the user interface, where their interpretation varies from

      '
    - 'implementation to implementation, and in master files, where they are

      '
    - 'relative to a single origin domain name.  The most common interpretation

      '
    - 'uses the root "." as either the single origin or as one of the members

      '
    - 'of the search list, so a multi-label relative name is often one where

      '
    - 'the trailing dot has been omitted to save typing.

    - 'As a matter of policy, the DNS technical specifications do not mandate a

      '
    - 'particular tree structure or rules for selecting labels; its goal is to

      '
    - 'be as general as possible, so that it can be used to build arbitrary

      '

      '
    - 'boundaries, name servers, etc.  The rationale for this is not that the

      '
    - 'name space should have no implied semantics, but rather that the choice

      '
    - 'of implied semantics should be left open to be used for the problem at

      '
    - 'hand, and that different parts of the tree can have different implied

      '
    - 'semantics.  For example, the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain is organized and

      '
    - 'distributed by network and host address because its role is to translate

      '
    - 'from network or host numbers to names; NetBIOS domains [RFC-1001, RFC-

    - 'Name servers are the repositories of information that make up the domain

      '
    - 'database.  The database is divided up into sections called zones, which

      '
    - 'are distributed among the name servers.  While name servers can have

      '
    - 'several optional functions and sources of data, the essential task of a

      '
    - 'name server is to answer queries using data in its zones.  By design,

      '
    - 'name servers can answer queries in a simple manner; the response can

      '
    - 'always be generated using only local data, and either contains the

      '
    - 'answer to the question or a referral to other name servers "closer" to

      '
    - 'the desired information.

      '
    - 'A given zone will be available from several name servers to insure its

      '
    - 'availability in spite of host or communication link failure.  By

      '
    - 'administrative fiat, we require every zone to be available on at least

      '
    - 'two servers, and many zones have more redundancy than that.

      '
    - 'A given name server will typically support one or more zones, but this

      '
    - 'gives it authoritative information about only a small section of the

      '
    - 'domain tree.  It may also have some cached non-authoritative data about

      '
    - 'other parts of the tree.  The name server marks its responses to queries

      '
    - 'so that the requester can tell whether the response comes from

      '
    - 'authoritative data or not.

      '
    title: 4.1. Introduction
  - contents:
    - '4.2. How the database is divided into zones

      '
    - 'The domain database is partitioned in two ways: by class, and by "cuts"

      '
    - 'made in the name space between nodes.

      '
    - 'The class partition is simple.  The database for any class is organized,

      '
    - 'delegated, and maintained separately from all other classes.  Since, by

      '
    - 'convention, the name spaces are the same for all classes, the separate

      '
    - 'classes can be thought of as an array of parallel namespace trees.  Note

      '
    - 'that the data attached to nodes will be different for these different

      '
    - 'parallel classes.  The most common reasons for creating a new class are

      '
    - 'the necessity for a new data format for existing types or a desire for a

      '
    - 'separately managed version of the existing name space.

      '
    - 'Within a class, "cuts" in the name space can be made between any two

      '
    - 'adjacent nodes.  After all cuts are made, each group of connected name

      '
    - 'space is a separate zone.  The zone is said to be authoritative for all

      '
    - 'names in the connected region.  Note that the "cuts" in the name space

      '
    - 'may be in different places for different classes, the name servers may

      '
    - 'be different, etc.

      '
    - 'These rules mean that every zone has at least one node, and hence domain

      '
    - 'name, for which it is authoritative, and all of the nodes in a

      '
    - 'particular zone are connected.  Given, the tree structure, every zone

      '
    - 'has a highest node which is closer to the root than any other node in

      '
    - 'the zone.  The name of this node is often used to identify the zone.

      '
    - 'It would be possible, though not particularly useful, to partition the

      '
    - 'name space so that each domain name was in a separate zone or so that

      '
    - 'all nodes were in a single zone.  Instead, the database is partitioned

      '
    - 'at points where a particular organization wants to take over control of

      '
    - 'a subtree.  Once an organization controls its own zone it can

      '
    - 'unilaterally change the data in the zone, grow new tree sections

      '
    - 'connected to the zone, delete existing nodes, or delegate new subzones

      '
    - 'under its zone.

      '
    - 'If the organization has substructure, it may want to make further

      '
    - 'internal partitions to achieve nested delegations of name space control.

      '
    - 'In some cases, such divisions are made purely to make database

      '
    - 'maintenance more convenient.

      - '4.2.1. Technical considerations

        '
      - "The data that describes a zone has four major parts:\n   - Authoritative
        data for all nodes within the zone.\n   - Data that defines the top node of
        the zone (can be thought of\n     as part of the authoritative data).\n   -
        Data that describes delegated subzones, i.e., cuts around the\n     bottom
        of the zone.\n   - Data that allows access to name servers for subzones\n
        \    (sometimes called \"glue\" data).\n"
      - 'All of this data is expressed in the form of RRs, so a zone can be

        '
      - 'completely described in terms of a set of RRs.  Whole zones can be

        '
      - 'transferred between name servers by transferring the RRs, either carried

        '
      - 'in a series of messages or by FTPing a master file which is a textual

        '
      - 'representation.

        '
      - 'The authoritative data for a zone is simply all of the RRs attached to

        '
      - 'all of the nodes from the top node of the zone down to leaf nodes or

        '
      - 'nodes above cuts around the bottom edge of the zone.

        '
      - 'Though logically part of the authoritative data, the RRs that describe

        '
      - 'the top node of the zone are especially important to the zone''s

        '
      - 'management.  These RRs are of two types: name server RRs that list, one

        '
      - 'per RR, all of the servers for the zone, and a single SOA RR that

        '
      - 'describes zone management parameters.

        '
      - 'The RRs that describe cuts around the bottom of the zone are NS RRs that

        '
      - 'name the servers for the subzones.  Since the cuts are between nodes,

        '
      - 'these RRs are NOT part of the authoritative data of the zone, and should

        '
      - 'be exactly the same as the corresponding RRs in the top node of the

        '
      - 'subzone.  Since name servers are always associated with zone boundaries,

        '
      - 'NS RRs are only found at nodes which are the top node of some zone.  In

        '
      - 'the data that makes up a zone, NS RRs are found at the top node of the

        '
      - 'zone (and are authoritative) and at cuts around the bottom of the zone

        '
      - '(where they are not authoritative), but never in between.

        '
      - 'One of the goals of the zone structure is that any zone have all the

        '
      - 'data required to set up communications with the name servers for any

        '
      - 'subzones.  That is, parent zones have all the information needed to

        '
      - 'access servers for their children zones.  The NS RRs that name the

        '
      - 'servers for subzones are often not enough for this task since they name

        '
      - 'the servers, but do not give their addresses.  In particular, if the

        '
      - 'name of the name server is itself in the subzone, we could be faced with

        '
      - 'the situation where the NS RRs tell us that in order to learn a name

        '
      - 'server''s address, we should contact the server using the address we wish

        '
      - 'to learn.  To fix this problem, a zone contains "glue" RRs which are not

        '
      - 'part of the authoritative data, and are address RRs for the servers.

        '
      - 'These RRs are only necessary if the name server''s name is "below" the

        '
      - 'cut, and are only used as part of a referral response.

      - 'When some organization wants to control its own domain, the first step

        '
      - 'is to identify the proper parent zone, and get the parent zone''s owners

        '

      - 'there are some administrative groupings discussed in [RFC-1032] which

        '
      - 'As the last installation step, the delegation NS RRs and glue RRs

        available in the response\n      depending on whether the name server is willing
        to provide\n      recursive service.  If recursive service is available and\n
        \     requested via the RD bit in the query, go to step 5,\n      otherwise
        step 2.\n   2. Search the available zones for the zone which is the nearest\n
        \     ancestor to QNAME.  If such a zone is found, go to step 3,\n      otherwise
        step 4.\n   3. Start matching down, label by label, in the zone.  The\n      matching
        process can terminate several ways:\n         a. If the whole of QNAME is
        matched, we have found the\n            node.\n            If the data at
        the node is a CNAME, and QTYPE doesn't\n            match CNAME, copy the
        CNAME RR into the answer section\n            of the response, change QNAME
        to the canonical name in\n            the CNAME RR, and go back to step 1.\n
        \           Otherwise, copy all RRs which match QTYPE into the\n            answer
        section and go to step 6.\n         b. If a match would take us out of the
        authoritative data,\n            we have a referral.  This happens when we
        encounter a\n            node with NS RRs marking cuts along the bottom of
        a\n            zone.\n            Copy the NS RRs for the subzone into the
        authority\n            section of the reply.  Put whatever addresses are\n
        \           available into the additional section, using glue RRs\n            if
        the addresses are not available from authoritative\n            data or the
        cache.  Go to step 4.\n         c. If at some label, a match is impossible
        (i.e., the\n            corresponding label does not exist), look to see if
        a\n            the \"*\" label exists.\n            If the \"*\" label does
        not exist, check whether the name\n            we are looking for is the original
        QNAME in the query\n            or a name we have followed due to a CNAME.
        \ If the name\n            is original, set an authoritative name error in
        the\n            response and exit.  Otherwise just exit.\n            If
        the \"*\" label does exist, match RRs at that node\n            against QTYPE.
        \ If any match, copy them into the answer\n            section, but set the
        owner of the RR to be QNAME, and\n            not the node with the \"*\"
        label.  Go to step 6.\n   4. Start matching down in the cache.  If QNAME is
        found in the\n      cache, copy all RRs attached to it that match QTYPE into
        the\n      answer section.  If there was no delegation from\n      authoritative
        data, look for the best one from the cache, and\n      put it in the authority
        section.  Go to step 6.\n   5. Using the local resolver or a copy of its algorithm
        (see\n      resolver section of this memo) to answer the query.  Store\n      the
        results, including any intermediate CNAMEs, in the answer\n      section of
        the response.\n   6. Using local data only, attempt to add other RRs which
        may be\n      useful to the additional section of the query.  Exit.\n"

      - 'When the appropriate conditions are met, the name server creates RRs

        '

        '
      - 'forward mail from the Internet to some other mail system.  The general

        '

        '

        '
      - 'across zone boundaries, although a subzone may choose to achieve that

        '
      - 'appearance by setting up similar defaults.

        '
      - 'The contents of the wildcard RRs follows the usual rules and formats for

        '
      - 'RRs.  The wildcards in the zone have an owner name that controls the

        '
      - 'query names they will match.  The owner name of the wildcard RRs is of

        '
      - '<anydomain> should not contain other * labels, and should be in the

      - 'authoritative data of the zone.  The wildcards potentially apply to

        '
      - 'descendants of <anydomain>, but not to <anydomain> itself.  Another way

        '
      - 'to look at this is that the "*" label always matches at least one whole

        '
      - 'label and sometimes more, but always whole labels.

        '
      - "Wildcard RRs do not apply:\n   - When the query is in another zone.  That
        is, delegation cancels\n     the wildcard defaults.\n   - When the query name
        or a name between the wildcard domain and\n     the query name is know to
        exist.  For example, if a wildcard\n     RR has an owner name of \"*.X\",
        and the zone also contains RRs\n     attached to B.X, the wildcards would
        apply to queries for name\n     Z.X (presuming there is no explicit information
        for Z.X), but\n     not to B.X, A.B.X, or X.\n"

        '
      - 'The general model of automatic zone transfer or refreshing is that one

        '
      - 'coordinated at the primary, typically by editing a master file for the

    - 'servers.  In the simplest case, a resolver receives a request from a

      '
    - 'user program (e.g., mail programs, TELNET, FTP) in the form of a

      '
    - 'subroutine call, system call etc., and returns the desired information

    - 'in a form compatible with the local host''s data formats.

      '
    - 'The resolver is located on the same machine as the program that requests

      '
    - 'the resolver''s services, but it may need to consult name servers on

      '
    - 'other hosts.  Because a resolver may need to consult several name

      '
    - 'servers, or may have the requested information in a local cache, the

      '
    - 'amount of time that a resolver will take to complete can vary quite a

      '
    - 'bit, from milliseconds to several seconds.

      '
    - 'A very important goal of the resolver is to eliminate network delay and

      '
    - 'name server load from most requests by answering them from its cache of

      '
    - 'prior results.  It follows that caches which are shared by multiple

      '

        '
      - 'The client interface to the resolver is influenced by the local host''s

        '
      - 'conventions, but the typical resolver-client interface has three

        '
      - "functions:\n   1. Host name to host address translation.\n      This function
        is often defined to mimic a previous HOSTS.TXT\n      based function.  Given
        a character string, the caller wants\n      one or more 32 bit IP addresses.
        \ Under the DNS, it\n      translates into a request for type A RRs.  Since
        the DNS does\n      not preserve the order of RRs, this function may choose
        to\n      sort the returned addresses or select the \"best\" address if\n
        \     the service returns only one choice to the client.  Note that\n      a
        multiple address return is recommended, but a single\n      address may be
        the only way to emulate prior HOSTS.TXT\n      services.\n   2. Host address
        to host name translation\n      This function will often follow the form of
        previous\n      functions.  Given a 32 bit IP address, the caller wants a\n
        \     character string.  The octets of the IP address are reversed,\n      used
        as name components, and suffixed with \"IN-ADDR.ARPA\".  A\n      type PTR
        query is used to get the RR with the primary name of\n      the host.  For
        example, a request for the host name\n      corresponding to IP address 1.2.3.4
        looks for PTR RRs for\n      domain name \"4.3.2.1.IN-ADDR.ARPA\".\n   3.
        General lookup function\n      This function retrieves arbitrary information
        from the DNS,\n      and has no counterpart in previous systems.  The caller\n
        \     supplies a QNAME, QTYPE, and QCLASS, and wants all of the\n      matching
        RRs.  This function will often use the DNS format\n      for all RR data instead
        of the local host's, and returns all\n      RR content (e.g., TTL) instead
        of a processed form with local\n      quoting conventions.\n"
      - 'When the resolver performs the indicated function, it usually has one of

        '
      - "the following results to pass back to the client:\n   - One or more RRs giving
        the requested data.\n     In this case the resolver returns the answer in
        the\n     appropriate format.\n   - A name error (NE).\n     This happens
        when the referenced name does not exist.  For\n     example, a user may have
        mistyped a host name.\n   - A data not found error.\n     This happens when
