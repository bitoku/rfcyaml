- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are\n\
    \   configured to send IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) to convey\n   information\
    \ to nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the\n   network.  This information\
    \ includes the implied default router\n   address taken from the observed source\
    \ address of the RA message, as\n   well as on-link prefix information.  However,\
    \ unintended\n   misconfigurations by users or administrators, or possibly malicious\n\
    \   attacks on the network, may lead to bogus RAs being present, which in\n  \
    \ turn can cause operational problems for hosts on the network.  In\n   this document,\
    \ we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be\n   observed and present\
    \ a list of possible solutions to the problem.  We\n   focus on the unintended\
    \ causes of rogue RAs in the text.  The goal of\n   this text is to be Informational,\
    \ and as such to present a framework\n   around which solutions can be proposed\
    \ and discussed.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861] describes the\
    \ operation of\n   IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) that are used to determine\
    \ node\n   configuration information during the IPv6 autoconfiguration process,\n\
    \   whether that node's configuration is stateful, via the Dynamic Host\n   Configuration\
    \ Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] or stateless, as\n   per [RFC4862], possibly\
    \ in combination with DHCPv6 Light [RFC3736].\n   In observing the operation of\
    \ deployed IPv6 networks, it is apparent\n   that there is a problem with undesired\
    \ or \"bogus\" IPv6 RAs appearing\n   on network links or subnets.  By \"bogus\"\
    \ we mean RAs that were not\n   the intended configured RAs, but rather RAs that\
    \ have appeared for\n   some other reason.  While the problem appears more common\
    \ in shared\n   wireless environments, it is also seen on wired enterprise networks.\n\
    \   The problem with rogue RAs is that they can cause partial or complete\n  \
    \ failure of operation of hosts on an IPv6 link.  For example, the\n   default\
    \ router address is drawn directly from the source address of\n   the RA message.\
    \  In addition, rogue RAs can cause hosts to assume\n   wrong prefixes to be used\
    \ for stateless address autoconfiguration.\n   In a case where there may be mixing\
    \ of \"good\" and \"bad\" RAs, a host\n   might keep on using the \"good\" default\
    \ gateway, but pick a wrong\n   source address, leading to egress filtering problems.\
    \  As such, rogue\n   RAs are an operational issue for which solution(s) are required,\
    \ and\n   for which best practice needs to be conveyed.  This not only includes\n\
    \   preventing or detecting rogue RAs, but also where necessary ensuring\n   the\
    \ network (and hosts on the network) have the ability to quickly\n   recover from\
    \ a state where host configuration is incorrect as a\n   result of processing\
    \ such an RA.\n   In the next section, we discuss the scenarios that may give\
    \ rise to\n   rogue RAs being present.  In the following section, we present some\n\
    \   candidate solutions for the problem, some of which may be more\n   practical\
    \ to deploy than others.  This document focuses on\n   \"accidental\" rogue RAs;\
    \ while malicious RAs are of course also\n   possible, the common problem today\
    \ lies with unintended RAs.  In\n   addition, a network experiencing malicious\
    \ attack of this kind is\n   likely to also experience malicious Neighbor Advertisement\
    \ (NA) and\n   related messages.\n"
- title: 2.  Bogus RA Scenarios
  contents:
  - "2.  Bogus RA Scenarios\n   There are three broad classes of scenario in which\
    \ bogus RAs may be\n   introduced to an IPv6 network.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Administrator Misconfiguration
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Administrator Misconfiguration\n   Here an administrator incorrectly configures\
    \ RAs on a router\n   interface, causing incorrect RAs to appear on links and\
    \ causing hosts\n   to generate incorrect or unintended IPv6 address, gateway,\
    \ or other\n   information.  In such a case, the default gateway may be correct,\
    \ but\n   a host might for example become multiaddressed, possibly with a\n  \
    \ correct and incorrect address based on a correct and incorrect\n   prefix. \
    \ There is also the possibility of other configuration\n   information being misconfigured,\
    \ such as the lifetime option.\n   In the case of a Layer 2 IEEE 802.1Q Virtual\
    \ LAN (VLAN)\n   misconfiguration, RAs may \"flood\" to unintended links, causing\
    \ hosts\n   or more than one link to potentially become incorrectly\n   multiaddressed,\
    \ with possibly two different default routers\n   available.\n"
- title: 2.2.  User Misconfiguration
  contents:
  - "2.2.  User Misconfiguration\n   In this case, a user's device \"accidentally\"\
    \ transmits RAs onto the\n   local link, potentially adding an additional default\
    \ gateway and\n   associated prefix information.\n   This seems to typically be\
    \ seen on wireless (though sometimes wired)\n   networks where a laptop has enabled\
    \ the Windows Internet Connection\n   Sharing (ICS) service, which can turn a\
    \ host into a 6to4 [RFC3056]\n   gateway; this can be a useful feature, unless\
    \ of course it is run\n   when not intended.  This service can also cause IPv4\
    \ problems, as it\n   will typically start a \"rogue\" DHCPv4 server on the host.\n\
    \   We have also had reports that hosts may not see genuine IPv6 RAs on a\n  \
    \ link due to host firewalls, causing them to turn on a connection-\n   sharing\
    \ service and 6to4 as a result.  In some cases, more technical\n   users may also\
    \ use a laptop as a home gateway (e.g., again a 6to4\n   gateway) and then connect\
    \ to another network, forgetting their\n   previous gateway configuration is still\
    \ active.\n   There are also reported incidents in enterprise networks of users\n\
    \   physically plugging Ethernet cables into the wrong sockets and\n   bridging\
    \ two subnets together, causing a problem similar to VLAN\n   flooding.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Malicious Misconfiguration
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Malicious Misconfiguration\n   Here an attacker is deliberately generating\
    \ RAs on the local network\n   in an attempt to perform some form of denial-of-service\
    \ or man-in-\n   the-middle attack.\n   As stated above, while this is a genuine\
    \ concern for network\n   administrators, there have been few if any reports of\
    \ such activity,\n   while in contrast reports of accidental rogue RAs are very\n\
    \   commonplace.  In writing this text, and with the feedback of the\n   v6ops\
    \ working group, we came to the conclusion that the issue of\n   malicious attack,\
    \ due to the other complementary attacks that are\n   likely to be launched using\
    \ rogue NA and similar messages, are best\n   considered by further work and document(s).\
    \  As a result, this text\n   intends to provide informational guidance for operators\
    \ looking for\n   practical measures to take to avoid \"accidental\" rogue RAs\
    \ on their\n   own networks.\n"
- title: 3.  Methods to Mitigate against Rogue RAs
  contents:
  - "3.  Methods to Mitigate against Rogue RAs\n   In this section, we present a summary\
    \ of methods suggested to date\n   for reducing or removing the possibility of\
    \ rogue RAs being seen on a\n   network.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Manual Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Manual Configuration\n   The default gateway and host address can usually\
    \ be manually\n   configured on a node.  This of course can be a resource intensive\n\
    \   solution, and also prone to administrative mistakes in itself.\n   Manual\
    \ configuration implies that RA processing is disabled.  Most\n   operating systems\
    \ allow RA messages to be ignored, such that if an\n   IPv6 address is manually\
    \ configured on a system, an additional global\n   autoconfigured address will\
    \ not be added should an unexpected RA\n   appear on the link.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Introducing RA Snooping
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Introducing RA Snooping\n   It should be possible to implement \"RA snooping\"\
    \ in Layer 2 switches\n   in a similar way to DHCP snooping, such that RAs observed\
    \ from\n   incorrect sources are blocked or dropped, and not propagated through\n\
    \   a subnet.  One candidate solution in this space, called \"RA-Guard\"\n   [RFC6105],\
    \ has been proposed.  This type of solution has appeal\n   because it is a familiar\
    \ model for enterprise network managers, but\n   it can also be used to complement\
    \ SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\n   [RFC3971], by a switch acting as a SEND\
    \ proxy for hosts.\n   This type of solution may not be applicable everywhere,\
    \ e.g., in\n   environments where there are not centrally controlled or manageable\n\
    \   switches.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Using ACLs on Managed Switches
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Using ACLs on Managed Switches\n   Certain switch platforms can already\
    \ implement some level of rogue RA\n   filtering by the administrator configuring\
    \ Access Control Lists\n   (ACLs) that block RA ICMP messages that might be inbound\
    \ on \"user\"\n   ports.  Again this type of \"solution\" depends on the presence\
    \ of such\n   configurable switches.\n   A recent document describes the RA message\
    \ format(s) for filtering\n   [IPv6-AUTOCFG-FILTER].  The document also notes\
    \ requirements for\n   DHCPv6 snooping, which can then be implemented similarly\
    \ to DHCPv4\n   snooping.\n"
- title: 3.4.  SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
  contents:
  - "3.4.  SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\n   The SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\
    \ [RFC3971] protocol provides a\n   method for hosts and routers to perform secure\
    \ Neighbor Discovery.\n   Thus, it can in principle protect a network against\
    \ rogue RAs.\n   SEND is not yet widely used at the time of writing, in part because\n\
    \   there are very few implementations of the protocol.  Some other\n   deployment\
    \ issues have been raised, though these are likely to be\n   resolved in due course.\
    \  For example, routers probably don't want to\n   use autogenerated addresses\
    \ (which might need to be protected by\n   ACLs), so SEND needs to be shown to\
    \ work with non-autogenerated\n   addresses.  Also, it has been argued that there\
    \ are \"bootstrapping\"\n   issues, in that hosts wanting to validate router credentials\
    \ (e.g.,\n   to a certificate server or Network Time Protocol (NTP) server) are\n\
    \   likely to need to communicate via the router for that information.\n   Further,\
    \ it's not wholly clear how widely adopted SEND could or would\n   be in site\
    \ networks with \"lightweight\" security (e.g., many campus\n   networks), especially\
    \ where hosts are managed by users and not\n   administratively.  Public or conference\
    \ wireless networks may face\n   similar challenges.  There may also be networks,\
    \ like perhaps sensor\n   networks, where use of SEND is less practical.  These\
    \ networks still\n   require rogue RA protection.\n   While SEND clearly can provide\
    \ a good, longer-term solution,\n   especially in networks where malicious activity\
    \ is a significant\n   concern, there is a requirement today for practical solutions,\
    \ and/or\n   solutions more readily applicable in more \"relaxed\" environments.\
    \  In\n   the latter case, solutions like \"RA snooping\" or applied ACLs are\n\
    \   more attractive now.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Router Preference Option
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Router Preference Option\n   [RFC4191] introduced a Router Preference option,\
    \ such that an RA\n   could carry one of three Router Preference values: High,\
    \ Medium\n   (default), or Low.  Thus, an administrator could use \"High\" settings\n\
    \   for managed RAs, and hope that \"accidental\" RAs would be medium\n   priority.\
    \  This of course would only work in some scenarios -- if the\n   user who accidentally\
    \ sends out a rogue RA on the network has\n   configured their device with \"\
    High\" precedence for their own intended\n   usage, the priorities would clash.\
    \  But for accidental rogue RAs\n   caused by software like Windows ICS and 6to4,\
    \ which would use the\n   default precedence, it could be useful.  Obviously this\
    \ solution\n   would also rely on clients (and routers) having implementations\
    \ of\n   the Router Preference option.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Relying on Layer 2 Admission Control
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Relying on Layer 2 Admission Control\n   In principle, if a technology\
    \ such as IEEE 802.1x is used, devices\n   would first need to authenticate to\
    \ the network before being able to\n   send or receive IPv6 traffic.  Ideally,\
    \ authentication would be\n   mutual.  Deployment of 802.1x, with mutual authentication,\
    \ may\n   however be seen as somewhat \"heavyweight\", akin to SEND, for some\n\
    \   deployments.\n   Improving Layer 2 security may help to mitigate against an\
    \ attacker's\n   capability to join the network to send RAs, but it doesn't prevent\n\
    \   misconfiguration issues.  A user can happily authenticate and still\n   launch\
    \ a Windows ICS service, for example.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Using Host-Based Packet Filters
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Using Host-Based Packet Filters\n   In a managed environment, hosts could\
    \ be configured via their\n   \"personal firewall\" to only accept RAs from trusted\
    \ sources.  Hosts\n   could also potentially be configured to discard 6to4-based\
    \ RAs in a\n   managed enterprise environment.\n   However, the problem is then\
    \ pushed to keeping this configuration\n   maintained and correct.  If a router\
    \ fails and is replaced, possibly\n   with a new Layer 2 interface address, the\
    \ link local source address\n   in the filter may become incorrect, and thus no\
    \ method would be\n   available to push the new information to the host over the\
    \ network.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Using an "Intelligent" Deprecation Tool
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Using an \"Intelligent\" Deprecation Tool\n   It is possible to run a daemon\
    \ on a link (perhaps on the router on\n   the link) to watch for incorrect RAs\
    \ and to send a deprecating RA\n   with a router lifetime of zero when such an\
    \ RA is observed.  The KAME\n   rafixd is an example of such a tool, which has\
    \ been used at IETF\n   meetings with some success.  A slightly enhanced tool\
    \ called RAMOND\n   has since been developed from this code, and is now available\
    \ as a\n   Sourceforge project.  As with host-based firewalling, the daemon\n\
    \   would need to somehow know what \"good\" and \"bad\" RAs are, from some\n\
    \   combination of known good sources and/or link prefixes.  In an\n   environment\
    \ with native IPv6, though, 6to4-based RAs would certainly\n   be known to be\
    \ rogue.\n   Whether or not use of such a tool is the preferred method, monitoring\n\
    \   a link for observed RAs seems prudent from a network management\n   perspective.\
    \  Some such tools exist already, e.g., NDPMon, which can\n   also detect other\
    \ undesirable behaviour.\n"
- title: 3.9.  Using Layer 2 Partitioning
  contents:
  - "3.9.  Using Layer 2 Partitioning\n   If each system or user on a network is partitioned\
    \ into a different\n   Layer 2 medium, then the impact of rogue RAs can be limited.\
    \  In\n   broadband networks, bridging [RFC2684] may be available, for example.\n\
    \   The benefit may be scenario-specific, e.g., whether a given user or\n   customer\
    \ has their own network prefix or whether the provisioning is\n   in a shared\
    \ subnet or link.  It is certainly desirable that any given\n   user or customer's\
    \ system(s) are unable to see RAs that may be\n   generated by other users or\
    \ customers.\n   However, such partitioning would probably increase address space\n\
    \   consumption significantly if applied in enterprise networks, and in\n   many\
    \ cases, hardware costs and software licensing costs to enable\n   routing to\
    \ the edge can be quite significant.\n"
- title: 3.10.  Adding Default Gateway/Prefix Options to DHCPv6
  contents:
  - "3.10.  Adding Default Gateway/Prefix Options to DHCPv6\n   Adding Default Gateway\
    \ and Prefix options for DHCPv6 would allow\n   network administrators to configure\
    \ hosts to only use DHCPv6 for\n   default gateway and prefix configuration in\
    \ managed networks, where\n   RAs would be required today.  A new document has\
    \ proposed such a\n   default router option, along with prefix advertisement options\
    \ for\n   DHCPv6 [DHCPv6-DEFAULT-RTR].  Even with such options added to DHCPv6,\n\
    \   an RA is in principle still required to inform hosts to use DHCPv6.\n   An\
    \ advantage of DHCPv6 is that should an error be introduced, only\n   hosts that\
    \ have refreshed their DHCP information since that time are\n   affected, while\
    \ a multicast rogue RA will most likely affect all\n   hosts immediately.  DHCPv6\
    \ also allows different answers to be given\n   to different hosts.\n   While\
    \ making host configuration possible via DHCPv6 alone is a viable\n   option that\
    \ would allow IPv6 configuration to be done in a way\n   similar to IPv4 today,\
    \ the problem has only been shifted: rather than\n   rogue RAs being the problem,\
    \ rogue DHCPv6 servers would be an\n   equivalent issue.  As with IPv4, a network\
    \ would then still require\n   use of Authenticated DHCP, or DHCP(v6) snooping,\
    \ as suggested in\n   [IPv6-AUTOCFG-FILTER].\n   There is certainly some demand\
    \ in the community for DHCPv6-only host\n   configuration.  While this may mitigate\
    \ the rogue RA issue, it simply\n   moves the trust problem elsewhere, albeit\
    \ to a place administrators\n   are familiar with today.\n"

    \   What the above summary does not consider is the practicality of\n   deploying\
    \ the measure.  An easy-to-deploy method that buys improved\n   resilience to\
    \ rogue RAs without significant administrative overhead\n   is attractive.  On\
    \ that basis, the RA snooping proposal, e.g.,\n   RA-Guard, has merit, while approaches\
    \ like manual configuration are\n   less appealing.  However, RA-Guard is not\
    \ yet fully defined or\n   available, while only certain managed switch equipment\

- title: 5.1.  Unicast RAs

  - "5.1.  Unicast RAs\n   The above discussion was initially held on the assumption\
    \ that rogue\n   multicast RAs were the cause of problems on a shared network\
    \ subnet.\n   However, the specifications for Router Advertisements allow them\
    \ to\n   be sent unicast to a host, as per Section 6.2.6 of RFC 4861.  If a\n\
    \   host sending rogue RAs sends them unicast to the soliciting host,\n   that\
    \ RA may not be seen by other hosts on the shared medium, e.g., by\n   a monitoring\
    \ daemon.  In most cases, though, an accidental rogue RA\n   is likely to be multicast.\n"
- title: 5.2.  The DHCP versus RA Threat Model
  contents:
  - "5.2.  The DHCP versus RA Threat Model\n   Comparing the threat model for rogue\
    \ RAs and rogue DHCPv6 servers is\n   an interesting exercise.  In the case of\
    \ Windows ICS causing rogue\n   6to4-based RAs to appear on a network, it is very\
    \ likely that the\n   same host is also acting as a rogue IPv4 DHCP server.  The\
    \ rogue\n   DHCPv4 server can allocate a default gateway and an address to hosts,\n\
    \   just as a rogue RA can lead hosts to learning of a new (additional)\n   default\
    \ gateway, prefix(es), and address.  In the case of multicast\n   rogue RAs, however,\
    \ the impact is potentially immediate to all hosts,\n   while the rogue DHCP server's\
    \ impact will depend on lease timers for\n   hosts.\n   In principle, Authenticated\
    \ DHCP can be used to protect against rogue\n   DHCPv4 (and DHCPv6) servers, just\
    \ as SEND could be used to protect\n   against rogue IPv6 RAs.  However, actual\
    \ use of Authenticated DHCP in\n   typical networks is currently minimal.  Were\
    \ new DHCPv6 default\n   gateway and prefix options to be standardised as described\
    \ above,\n   then without Authenticated DHCP the (lack of) security is just pushed\n\
    \   to another place.\n   The RA-Guard approach is essentially using a similar\
    \ model to DHCP\n   message snooping to protect against rogue RAs in network (switch)\n\
    \   equipment.  As noted above, DHCPv6 message snooping would also be\n   very\
    \ desirable in IPv6 networks.\n"
- title: 5.3.  IPv4-Only Networks
  contents:
  - "5.3.  IPv4-Only Networks\n   The rogue RA problem should also be considered by\
    \ administrators and\n   operators of IPv4-only networks, where IPv6 monitoring,\
    \ firewalling,\n   and other related mechanisms may not be in place.\n   For example,\
    \ a comment has been made that in the case of 6to4 being\n   run by a host on\
    \ a subnet that is not administratively configured\n   with IPv6, some OSes or\
    \ applications may begin using IPv6 to the 6to4\n   host (router) rather than\
    \ IPv4 to the intended default IPv4 router,\n   because they have IPv6 enabled\
    \ by default and some applications\n   prefer IPv6 by default.  Technically aware\
    \ users may also\n   deliberately choose to use IPv6, possibly for subversive\
    \ reasons.\n   Mitigating against this condition can also be seen to be important.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Network Monitoring Tools
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Network Monitoring Tools\n   It would generally be prudent for network\
    \ monitoring or management\n   platforms to be able to observe and report on observed\
    \ RAs, and\n   whether unintended RAs (possibly from unintended sources) are present\n\
    \   on a network.  Further, it may be useful for individual hosts to be\n   able\
    \ to report their address status (assuming their configuration\n   status allowed\
    \ it, of course), e.g., this could be useful during an\n   IPv6 renumbering phased\
    \ process as described in RFC 4192 [RFC4192].\n   The above assumes, of course,\
    \ that what defines a \"good\" (or \"bad\")\n   RA can be configured in a trustworthy\
    \ manner within the network's\n   management framework.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Recovering from Bad Configuration State
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Recovering from Bad Configuration State\n   After a host receives and processes\
    \ a rogue RA, it may have multiple\n   default gateways, global addresses, and\
    \ potentially clashing RA\n   options (e.g., M/O bits [RFC4861]).  The host's\
    \ behaviour may then be\n   unpredictable, in terms of the default router that\
    \ is used, and the\n   (source) address(es) used in communications.  A host that\
    \ is aware of\n   protocols such as Shim6 [RFC5533] may believe it is genuinely\n\
    \   multihomed.\n   An important issue is how readily a host can recover from\
    \ receiving\n   and processing bad configuration information, e.g., considering\
    \ the\n   \"2 hour rule\" mentioned in Section 5.5.3 of RFC 4862 (though this\n\
    \   applies to the valid address lifetime and not the router lifetime).\n   We\
    \ should ensure that methods exist for a network administrator to\n   correct\
    \ bad configuration information on a link or subnet, and that\n   OS platforms\
    \ support these methods.  At least if the problem can be\n   detected, and corrected\
    \ promptly, the impact is minimised.\n"

  - "5.6.  Isolating the Offending Rogue RA Source\n   In addition to issuing a deprecating\
    \ RA, it would be desirable to\n   isolate the offending source of the rogue RA\
    \ from the network.  It\n   may be possible to use Network Access Control methods\
    \ to quarantine\n   the offending host, or rather the network point of attachment\
    \ or port\n   that it is using.\n"
- title: 6.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "6.  Conclusions\n   In this text we have described scenarios via which rogue\
    \ Router\n   Advertisements (RAs) may appear on a network, and some measures that\n\
    \   could be used to mitigate against these.  We have also noted some\n   related\
    \ issues that have arisen in the rogue RA discussions.  Our\n   discussion is\
    \ generally focused on the assumption that rogue RAs are\n   appearing as a result\
    \ of accidental misconfiguration on the network,\n   by a user or administrator.\n\
    \   While SEND perhaps offers the most robust solution, implementations\n   and\
    \ deployment guidelines are not yet widely available.  SEND is very\n   likely\
    \ to be a good, longer-term solution, but many administrators\n   are seeking\
    \ solutions today.  Such administrators are also often in\n   networks with security\
    \ models for which SEND is a \"heavyweight\"\n   solution, e.g., campus networks,\
    \ or wireless conference or public\n   networks.  For such scenarios, simpler\
    \ measures are desirable.\n   Adding new DHCPv6 Default Gateway and Prefix options\
    \ would allow IPv6\n   host configuration by DHCP only and would be a method that\
    \ IPv4\n   administrators are comfortable with (for better or worse), but this\n\
    \   simply shifts the robustness issue elsewhere.\n   While a number of the mitigations\
    \ described above have their appeal,\n   the simplest solutions probably lie in\
    \ switch-based ACLs and\n   RA-Guard-style approaches.  Where managed switches\
    \ are not available,\n   use of the Router Preference option and (more so in managed\
    \ desktop\n   environments) host firewalls may be appropriate.\n   In the longer\
    \ term, wider experience of SEND will be beneficial,\n   while the use of RA snooping\
    \ will remain useful either to complement\n   SEND (where a switch running RA-Guard\
    \ can potentially be a SEND\n   proxy) or to assist in scenarios for which SEND\
    \ is not deployed.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This Informational document is focused on discussing\
    \ solutions to\n   operational problems caused by rogue RAs resulting from unintended\n\
    \   misconfiguration by users or administrators.  Earlier versions of\n   this\
    \ text included some analysis of rogue RAs introduced maliciously;\n   e.g., the\
    \ text included an extra column in the matrix in Section 4.\n   However, the consensus\
    \ of the v6ops working group feedback was to\n   instead focus on the common operational\
    \ problem of \"accidental\" rogue\n   RAs seen today.\n   Thus, the final version\
    \ of this text does not address attacks on a\n   network where rogue RAs are intentionally\
    \ introduced as part of a\n   broader attack, e.g., including malicious NA messages.\
    \  On the wire,\n   malicious rogue RAs will generally look the same as \"accidental\"\
    \n   ones, though they are more likely, for example, to spoof the Media\n   Access\
    \ Control (MAC) or IPv6 source address of the genuine router, or\n   to use a\
    \ \"High\" Router Preference option.  It is also likely that\n   malicious rogue\
    \ RAs will be accompanied by other attacks on the IPv6\n   infrastructure, making\
    \ discussion of mitigations more complex.\n   Administrators may be able to detect\
    \ such activity by the use of\n   tools such as NDPMon.\n   It is worth noting\
    \ that the deprecation daemon could be used as part\n   of a denial-of-service\
    \ attack, should the tool be used to deprecate\n   the genuine RA.\n"
