  - "                  Data Management Meeting Announcement\n        Mitre will host\
    \ a Network Data Management Meeting, February 23,\n   24.  As a follow-on from\
    \ past meetings, the meeting is being held to\n   accomplish two objectives. \
    \ As a result of the first data management\n   meeting in Aug- ust, the general\
    \ consensus was a need to learn about\n   applications of net- work data facilities,\
    \ and how networks will\n   better help users achieve their objectives.  There\
    \ are several people\n   that have expressed an inter- est in discussing applications.\
    \  The\n   attached schedule is a list of people who have agreed to talk.  If\n\
    \   anyone knows of other people interested in discussing applications,\n   please\
    \ have them contact me.\n        Secondly, the meeting will discuss and try to\
    \ arrive at a\n   specifica- tion for a network data management protocol.  It\
    \ was\n   decided that the best way to come up with a design would be to discuss\n\
    \   a tentative written proposal or proposals.  I will try and have copies\n \
    \  of a written proposal available to meeting attendees before the\n   meeting\
    \ date.  I would like to encourage anyone else interested in\n   submitting a\
    \ 3rd level protocol for sharing network data to do so.\n        The protocol\
    \ design would hopefully achieve the objectives of a\n   data facility described\
    \ in stage 2 of RFC-146.\n        Since the facilities are limited and the second\
    \ half of the\n   meeting is to be a working session, it will be necessary to\
    \ limit the\n   attendance.  First priority will be the people or representatives\
    \ from\n   groups that have participated in the past two meetings.  I will inform\n\
    \   any other people who contact me of any openings.\n        All reservations\
    \ should be made by contacting Mrs. Madeline\n   Cornell at Mitre, Telephone (Area\
    \ Code 703) 893-3500 Extension 2395 as\n   soon as possible.\n   DBM:eb\n"
