  - "1.  Introduction\n   Early in ARPANET development, the SRI-NIC established a\
    \ centralized\n   whois database that provided host and network information about\
    \ the\n   systems connected to the network and the E-mail addresses of the\n \
    \  users on those systems.  The ARPANET experiment has evolved into a\n   global\
    \ network with countless people and hundreds of thousands of end\n   systems.\
    \  Given the sheer size and effort needed to maintain a\n   centralized database,\
    \ an alternate, decentralized approach to store\n   and display this information\
    \ is desired.\n   The Internet portions of the DDN NIC have been transitioned\
    \ to what\n   is now known as InterNIC Registration Services (RS).  The charter\
    \ for\n   InterNIC RS has been reduced to maintain information only for IP\n \
    \  networks, top-level domains, Autonomous System Numbers, and the\n   points\
    \ of contact for each of these particular entities.  In\n   addition, the InterNIC,\
    \ in its role as an Internet Registry (IR), has\n   delegated IP block assignment\
    \ authority to Regional Registries such\n   as the RIPE NCC for Europe and the\
    \ APNIC for the Asian Pacific\n   region, while retaining authority for North\
    \ America and all non-\n   delegated regions.  This has led to a fragmentation\
    \ of whois service\n   to the Internet user.\n   Several different solutions have\
    \ been proposed and developed by the\n   various regional IR's.  Two solutions\
    \ have been worked on\n   extensively:  the Shared Whois Project (SWIP) and X.500.\n\
    \   The SWIP project has a common exchange format that can be parsed by\n   the\
    \ various IR's for input and output.  Thus, one can synchronize\n   their databases\
    \ with information obtained from the other IR's.  This\n   project is showing\
    \ promise and is now operational.  However, this\n   approach still requires a\
    \ centralized database for store and display.\n   The InterNIC has also been involved\
    \ in the use of X.500 for display\n   of registration information.  Among other\
    \ things, this included\n   defining schemas and Directory information tree structures\
    \ for the\n   purpose of distributing information amongst the various IR X.500\n\
    \   Directory Service Agents (DSA).  Unfortunately, X.500's complexity,\n   resource\
    \ utilization, and lack of Internet support has made a search\n   for an alternative\
    \ solution necessary.\n   The information that the various IR's maintain is inherently\n\
    \   hierarchical in nature.  (Examples: hammer.nic.ddn.mil is under the\n   nic.ddn.mil\
    \ domain which is under the ddn.mil domain which is under\n   the .mil domain.\
    \ 198.41.0.21 is part of network 198.41.0.0/24 which\n   is part of the block\
    \ 198.41.0.0/16 which is part of the block\n   198.0.0.0/8)  The InterNIC may\
    \ not have the information, but will at\n   least be able to reduce the query\
    \ and point or refer the users closer\n   to their goal.  This has led to the\
    \ development of a referral whois,\n   and the corresponding RWhois protocol.\n\
    \   The underlying premise for this project has been to retain the basic\n   functionality\
    \ of the whois server and client, making all of the\n   extensions optional. \
    \ The server must respond to the original whois\n   client, currently included\
    \ with many operating systems.  The RWhois\n   client must also interact with\
    \ RFC 954 [RFC-954] whois servers.\n   RWhois has been designed as an extensible\
    \ protocol to ensure that\n   many uses can be accommodated.  Public extensions\
    \ to the protocol\n   should be documented as RFCs.  Private extensions can be\
    \ used with\n   agreement left up to the client and server.\n   If extensions\
    \ are not implemented at the server in question, an\n   appropriate error message\
    \ must be sent.  The use of extended error\n   message is outlined in Section\
    \ 5 - Error Codes.\n   Throughout this document the following notations will be\
    \ used to\n   describe the RWhois server/client interaction:\n     <SP>      space\n\
    \     [arg]     optional argument\n     <arg>     required argument\n     (<arg>)\
    \   conditional required argument\n     ([arg])   conditional optional argument\n\
    \     {format}  format of item\n     \\         continued on next line\n   The\
    \ words should and must are significant in this document.  If\n   should is used,\
    \ the implementor has the option to follow the advice\n   of this document.  If\
    \ must is used then it is a required part of the\n   protocol.  Implementations\
    \ without this functionality may not\n   interact correctly with other RWhois\
    \ servers.\n   The format descriptions throughout this document use macro\n  \
    \ definitions described in Section 6.1.  Refer to that section for\n   clarification.\n\
    \   The RWhois protocol specified in this document can be extended to\n   accommodate\
    \ such applications as NetHelp and ZoneGen (DNS zone\n   generator).\n"
- title: 2.  RWhois Client Model
  contents:
  - "2.  RWhois Client Model\n   The RWhois design requires compatibility with the\
    \ current Whois and\n   Whois++ servers.  Therefore, the RWhois client must wait\
    \ or have\n   knowledge of server type to determine if the server contacted is\
    \ an\n   RWhois server.  The user should have control over the time the client\n\
    \   waits, since this will vary based on network congestion and capacity.\n  \
    \ If after the wait the server does not respond with the %RWhois\n   response,\
    \ the client must not send any RWhois extended directives.\n   In this case, the\
    \ client should only send the query.  We realize that\n   the server identification\
    \ feature may mean that the identity of an\n   RWhois server may be missed.  However,\
    \ it will allow the RWhois\n   system to utilize the current Whois and Whois++\
    \ infrastructure.\n   Referrals from RWhois can be directed toward a Whois or\
    \ Whois++\n   server.  These non-RWhois servers must be placed as a leaf on the\n\
    \   hierarchical tree.  These servers represent a mesh structure from the\n  \
    \ RWhois perspective.  This restriction should not discourage the use\n   of these\
    \ servers in building the RWhois structure.\n   The RWhois server must remain\
    \ connected until a query is received.\n   If the client wishes to make multiple\
    \ queries it must send the\n   -holdconnect directive.  In this mode, once the\
    \ client has sent the\n   last query and received either an answer or the error\
    \ code indicating\n   that no records were found, it must issue the -quit directive.\
    \  If\n   the client only wishes to issue directives, then upon completion the\n\
    \   -quit directive must be sent.  If it is not sent, the server will\n   wait\
    \ until it receives non-directive input from the client.\n   Considering the requirement\
    \ for compatibility with the original\n   whois, the RWhois client in default\
    \ mode must operate exactly like\n   the current Whois client.  However, in the\
    \ enhanced mode, the RWhois\n   client can do much more based on information received\
    \ from the RWhois\n   server.\n"
- title: '2.1  Directives:  Client to Server Interaction'
  contents:
  - "2.1  Directives:  Client to Server Interaction\n   The RWhois client sends directives\
    \ to the RWhois server. These\n   directives are prefaced with the `-' character\
    \ always at the start of\n   a new line.  However, for compatibility with older\
    \ Whois clients, the\n   query is not prefaced with the `-' character. Only after\
    \ the client\n   is certain that the server is an RWhois server should these\n\
    \   directives be sent.  Compatibility with RFC 954 [RFC-954] whois\n   servers\
    \ is required.  All directives must be terminated by <LF><CR>.\n"

    \ physical data for these objects is not contained on the system\n   hosting the\
    \ server.  The -cache directive allows the client to\n   instruct the server whether\
    \ or not to send cached data.  The RWhois\n   client should start with the cache\
    \ turned off.  The server must start\n   with the cache turned on in order to\

    \  dump (#)            Display the record in a parsable format.\n   In addition\

  - "5.  Error Codes\n   The error code immediately follows the %error response from\
    \ the\n   RWhois server.  The definitions of the error codes are below.  The\n\
    \   error codes are descriptive so that the client can group the error\n   messages\
    \ in order to determine group action that must be taken before\n   taking error\
    \ specific action.  Error codes should remain consistent\n   without variable\
    \ extensions except for messages associated with the\n   registration process.\
    \  If a client receives a `6' in the second\n   position of the error code and\
    \ the client does not support the\n   extended code received, the client must\
    \ act on the first position\n   code. (Example: If a client received %error 561\
    \ and the client did\n   not support the extended error codes for the server currently\n\
    \   connected, the client would exit based on the `5' in the first\n   position\

  - "6.  Attribute Format\n   The format for all attributes for objects in the RWhois\
    \ server must\n   be specified using a format specifier.  This definition will\
    \ allow\n   the client software to interpret the received data correctly.  The\n\
    \   RWhois format specifier closely follows the `C' language scanf syntax\n  \
    \ with macro extensions.\n   Format specifiers must follow this pattern:\n   %[alignment][length\
    \ restriction]<type>[range restriction]\n   [alignment]    '-' = left justified\n\
    \                  '.' = right justified\n   [length restriction]     <value>\

    \ bits allowed\n   <type>    This is the only required part of the format specifier.\n\
    \             Below are the allowed format type values.  The length\n        \
    \     of these values are not specified.  These restrictions\n             will\

    \ the allowed\n                       values.  This may specify a number,\n  \
    \                     character, or string range.\n   Examples: %-3s[\"ON\",\"\
    OFF\"] =  Defines a string with 3 characters\n                               \
    \  left aligned and limited to the\n                                 strings ON\
