  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace\
    \ for\n   the Schema for Academia (SCHAC).\n   The namespace described in this\
    \ document is for naming persistent\n   resources defined by the SCHAC participants\
    \ internationally, their\n   working groups, and other designated subordinates.\
    \  The main use of\n   this namespace will be for the creation of controlled vocabulary\n\
    \   values for attributes in the SCHAC schema.  These values will be\n   associated\
    \ with particular instances of persons or objects belonging\n   to any of the\
    \ SCHAC object classes.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Schema for Academia (SCHAC) international activity was\
    \ born\n   inside the Task Force on European Middleware Coordination and\n   Collaboration\
    \ (TF-EMC2) of the Trans-European Research and Education\n   Networking Association\
    \ (TERENA) [6].  The initial aim of SCHAC was to\n   harmonize the disjoint person\
    \ schemas of the participating countries\n   in order to have a common way for\
    \ expressing data about persons,\n   exchanged between educational organizations.\
    \  SCHAC, as are other\n   person schemas, is designed to ease the sharing of\
    \ information about\n   a given individual between parties, mostly, but not limited\
    \ to,\n   educational and research institutions.  The main aims of this sharing\n\
    \   are to provide resources to individuals and to allow said individuals\n  \
    \ to move, virtually and physically, between such institutions.  Thus,\n   the\
    \ SCHAC schema was defined with input from all participants'\n   national person\
    \ schemas [7].\n   SCHAC does not supplant other person schemas such as\n   organizationalPerson\
    \ [8], inetOrgPerson [9], or eduPerson [10]; it\n   extends those where needed\
    \ for the purposes of Higher Education\n   outside the United States.  This characteristic\
    \ has made SCHAC,\n   originally a European effort, useful for groups outside\
    \ Europe.\n"

    \ victoriano@uma.es\n      Phone: +34 95 213 1415\n   Syntactic structure:\n \
    \     The Namespace Specific Strings (NSSs) of all URNs assigned by\n      SCHAC\
    \ will conform to the syntax defined in Section 2.2 of\n      RFC 2141, \"URN\
    \ Syntax\" [11].  In addition, all SCHAC URN NSSs will\n      consist of a left-to-right\
    \ series of tokens delimited by colons.\n      The left-to-right sequence of colon-delimited\
    \ tokens corresponds\n      to descending nodes in a tree.  To the right of the\
    \ lowest naming\n      authority node, there may be zero, one, or more levels\
    \ of\n      hierarchical naming nodes terminating in a rightmost leaf node.\n\
    \      See the \"Identifier assignment\" section below for more on the\n     \
    \ semantics of NSSs.  This syntax convention is captured in the\n      following\
    \ normative ABNF rules for SCHAC NSSs (see RFC 5234 [2]):\n           SCHAC-NSS\
    \    =   1*subStChar *( \":\" 1*subStChar )\n           subStChar    =   trans\
    \ / \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\n           trans        =   ALPHA / DIGIT / other / reserved\n\
    \           other        =   \"(\" / \")\" / \"+\" / \",\" / \"-\" / \".\" /\n\
    \                            \"=\" / \"@\" / \";\" / \"$\" /\n               \
    \             \"_\" / \"!\" / \"*\" / \"'\"\n           reserved     =   \"/\"\
    \ / \"?\" / \"#\"\n      The exclusion of the colon from the list of \"other\"\
    \ characters\n      means that the colon can only occur as a delimiter between\
    \ string\n      tokens.  Note that this ABNF rule set guarantees that any valid\n\
    \      SCHAC NSS is also a valid RFC 2141 NSS.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \      None.\n   Identifier uniqueness:\n      It is the responsibility of TERENA\
    \ to guarantee uniqueness of the\n      names of immediately subordinate naming\
    \ authorities.  Each lower-\n      level naming authority in turn inherits the\
    \ responsibility of\n      guaranteeing uniqueness of names in its branch of the\
    \ naming tree.\n   Identifier persistence:\n      TERENA bears ultimate responsibility\
    \ for maintaining the usability\n      of SCHAC URNs over time.  This responsibility\
    \ MAY be delegated to\n      subordinate naming authorities per the discussion\
    \ in the section\n      below on identifier assignment.  That section provides\
    \ a mechanism\n      for the delegation to be revoked in the case where a subordinate\n\
    \      naming authority ceases to function.\n   Identifier assignment:\n     \
    \ TERENA will create an initial series of immediately subordinate\n      naming\
    \ authorities, and will define a process for adding to that\n      list of authorities.\
    \  Such a list, and the policy for adding to\n      it, will be published at the\
    \ root registry page.  Each country\n      with a representative in SCHAC will\
    \ be invited to designate a\n      naming authority.  Country-specific namespaces\
    \ based on the\n      country Internet Top-Level Domain (TLD) [12] will then be\
    \ assigned\n      to the designated authority.  The subordinated namespaces int\
    \ and\n      eu will remain under TERENA authority, controlled by the SCHAC\n\
    \      activity members, for entities of global, international, or\n      European\
    \ interest.  There is also the possibility of granting\n      subordinate namespaces\
    \ to multi-country organizations; in this\n      case, the organizational Internet\
    \ Fully Qualified Domain Name\n      (FQDN) will be used as the prefix.\n    \
    \  As an example, a European-level interest entity would be any value\n      related\
    \ to information used in the Higher Education European\n      Space, or the so-called\
    \ Bologna process.  Such entities will\n      belong in the eu subordinate namespace.\n\
    \      Global international entities could encompass values related to\n     \
    \ the Grid community or values useful both for some European and for\n      some\
    \ Australian universities.  Such entities would belong in the\n      int subordinate\
    \ namespace.\n      Examples of multi-country organizations include TERENA itself\
    \ or\n      an association like the Educational Policy Institute (EPI)\n     \
    \ (educationalpolicy.org) that has members from Australia, Canada,\n      and\
    \ the US.\n      URNs intended for values of SCHAC attributes will include the\n\
    \      attribute name immediately after the NSS prefix, before any\n      geographical\
    \ namespace delegation, such that any string can convey\n      information about\
    \ the attribute for which it is a value.  For\n      example, values for schacUserStatus\
    \ will be of the form:\n                urn:schac:userStatus:int\n           \
    \     urn:schac:userStatus:au or\n                urn:schac:userStatus:terena.org\n\
    \      If at all possible, automated registry publication mechanisms will\n  \
    \    be provided, based on the work on distributed URN registries done\n     \
    \ by the TF-EMC2 task force members.\n      Institutions and communities affiliated\
    \ with SCHAC participants\n      may request that they be granted subordinate\
    \ naming authority\n      status.  Uniqueness of these namespaces under country\
    \ authority\n      will be based on the requestor's Internet FQDN.  This\n   \
    \   subordination procedure SHOULD be carried along the delegation\n      chain;\
    \ i.e., if at all possible, all entities that receive a\n      delegated namespace\
    \ MUST have a valid FQDN and MUST publish an\n      Internet accessible URN value\
    \ registry, based on the URN registry\n      mechanisms designed by the TF-EMC2\
    \ task force members.\n      On at least an annual basis, TERENA will contact\
    \ the liaisons or\n      directors of each immediately subordinate naming authority.\
    \  If\n      there is no response, or if the respondent indicates that they\n\
    \      wish to relinquish naming authority, the authority over that\n      branch\
    \ of the tree reverts to TERENA.  This process will be\n      enforced recursively\
    \ by each naming authority on its subordinates.\n      This process guarantees\
    \ that responsibility for each branch of the\n      tree will lapse for less than\
    \ one year, at worst, before being\n      reclaimed by a superior authority.\n\
    \      Lexical equivalence of two SCHAC Namespace Specific Strings (NSSs)\n  \
    \    is defined below as an exact, case-sensitive string match.  TERENA\n    \
    \  will assign names of immediately subordinate naming authorities in\n      lowercase\
    \ only.  This forestalls the registration of two SCHAC-\n      subordinate naming\
    \ authorities whose names differ only in case.\n      Attribute names will use\
    \ the same mixed-case format as in the\n      schema definition.\n   Identifier\
    \ resolution:\n      The namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery\n\
    \      System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace prohibits the future\n  \
    \    definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing with\n      an RDS.\n\
    \      TERENA will maintain a registry of all SCHAC-assigned URN values,\n   \
    \   both final and for delegation, on its web site:\n      https://urnreg.terena.org/\n\
    \      Delegation entries will have a pointer to the registry of the\n      subordinate\
    \ naming authority.  This SHOULD recurse down the\n      delegation tree, but\
    \ registries for several delegated namespaces\n      MAY be maintained by a single\
    \ naming authority.\n      All registries MUST publish their URNs over https links\
    \ [3].  The\n      https links MUST be secured by sites offering credentials signed\n\
    \      by a SCHAC-community recognized Certification Authority (CA) using\n  \
    \    the latest secure methods for accessing a web site (which at\n      present\
    \ is the latest version of Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n      [4]).  Registries\
    \ SHOULD consider the user interface implications\n      of their choice of CA,\
    \ taking into account issues like browser\n      alerts and blind trust.\n   Lexical\
    \ equivalence:\n      Lexical equivalence of two SCHAC Namespace Specific Strings\
    \ (NSSs)\n      is defined as an exact, case-sensitive string match.\n   Conformance\
    \ with URN syntax:\n      All SCHAC NSSs fully conform to RFC 2141 syntax rules\
    \ for NSSs.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      As specified in the \"Identifier\
    \ resolution\" section above, TERENA\n      will maintain an index of all SCHAC-assigned\
    \ URNs on its web site:\n      https://urnreg.terena.org/.  Presence in that registry\
    \ or in any\n      subordinate registry implies that a given URN is valid.  Delegated\n\
    \      naming authorities MUST guarantee that values are valid in their\n    \
    \  assigned spaces.\n   Scope:\n      Global.\n"

- title: 6.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Namespace Considerations\n   Registration of a Namespace Identifier (NID)\
    \ specific to SCHAC is\n   reasonable given the following considerations:\n  \
    \    SCHAC would like to assign URNs to some very fine-grained objects.\n    \
    \  This does not seem to be the primary intended use of the XML.org\n      namespace\
    \ (RFC 3120) [13], or the more tightly controlled\n      Organization for the\
    \ Advancement of Structured Information\n      Standards (OASIS) [14] namespace\
    \ (RFC 3121) [15].\n      SCHAC seeks naming autonomy.  SCHAC is not a member\
    \ of OASIS, so\n      becoming a subordinate naming authority under the OASIS\
    \ URN space\n      is not an option.  There is the MACE (Middleware Architecture\n\
    \      Committee for Education) (RFC 3613) [16] namespace, but the SCHAC\n   \
    \   development is done outside of the MACE activity scope; thus, the\n      attributes\
    \ and values do not belong in the MACE namespace.  Using\n      the MACE namespace\
    \ requires that the SCHAC namespace be placed\n      under one of the SCHAC participants'\
    \ namespaces, which hinders its\n      global scope.\n      SCHAC will want to\
    \ assign URNs to non-XML objects as well.  That\n      is another reason that\
    \ XML.org may not be an appropriate higher-\n      level naming authority for\
    \ SCHAC.\n   Some of the already defined SCHAC attribute values have been assigned\n\
    \   URNs under the urn:mace:terena.org namespace.  These values will\n   enter\
    \ a deprecation cycle, with a clear indication that they will be\n   replaced\
    \ by values under the new namespace once it is assigned.  In\n   any case, RFC\
    \ 3406 [5] (which replaced RFC 2611) includes an explicit\n   statement that two\
    \ or more URNs may point to the same resource.\n"
- title: 7.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Community Considerations\n   The assignment and use of identifiers within\
    \ the namespace are open,\n   and the related rule is established by the SCHAC\
    \ activity members.\n   Registration agencies (the next-level naming authorities)\
    \ will be the\n   National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) and established\n\
    \   organizational cross-border organizations that participate in SCHAC.\n   It\
    \ is expected that the majority of the European NRENs, their\n   constituencies,\
    \ participants in the Australian Access Federation, and\n   some other international\
    \ activities will make use of the SCHAC\n   namespace.\n   After the establishment\
    \ of the SCHAC namespace, TERENA will establish\n   a registry service (analogously\
    \ to other distributed pan-European\n   services, such as eduroam, PerfSONAR,\
    \ etc.) for the namespace\n   clients.  This registry will be available via the\
    \ root page of the\n   namespace: https://urnreg.terena.org/.  The policy for\
