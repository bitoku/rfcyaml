  - "1.  Introduction\n   The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is composed\
    \ of the\n   European Central Bank (ECB) [ECB] and the national central banks\n\
    \   (NCBs) of all 27 EU Member States (Article 107.01 of the Treaty) --\n   whether\
    \ they have adopted the Euro currency or not.  One central bank\n   belonging\
    \ to the ESCB is Deutsche Bundesbank [DBBK], which, for the\n   purpose of this\
    \ document, is acting on behalf of the ESCB.  The term\n   Eurosystem is used\
    \ to refer to the entity composed of the ECB and the\n   NCBs of those member\
    \ states that have adopted the Euro currency.  For\n   further information on\
    \ the tasks of the ESCB and the Eurosystem,\n   please refer to the ECB web site\
    \ ([ECB], [ESCB], [Eurosystem]).\n   The ESCB provides the TARGET2 (Trans-European\
    \ Automated Realtime\n   Gross Settlement Express Transfer) system for market\
    \ infrastructure;\n   it is an interbank payment system for the real-time processing\
    \ of\n   cross-border transfers throughout the European Union.  In addition,\n\
    \   the ESCB is currently implementing TARGET2-Securities, a future\n   securities\
    \ settlement platform that offers a new, harmonized and\n   centralized method\
    \ of settling securities in central bank money.  The\n   TARGET2-Securities project\
    \ was initiated by the Eurosystem as\n   platform owner in 2006.  TARGET2-Securities\
    \ is currently under\n   development.  Four central banks of the Eurosystem --\
    \ Deutsche\n   Bundesbank, Banque de France, Banca d'Italia, and Banco de Espana\n\
    \   (4CB) -- are entrusted with the development and the operation of the\n   platform.\
    \  For details, see [T2S_ECB] and [T2S_DBBK].\n   The future users of TARGET2-Securities\
    \ will communicate and exchange\n   information with the platform via messages\
    \ (a set of structured\n   information) following the ISO 20022 Standard [ISO20022-RA].\n\
    \   This document specifies and registers with IANA a URN Namespace for\n   the\
    \ Eurosystem, which will be populated initially by names for\n   abstract and\
    \ concrete entities used in TARGET2-Securities messaging,\n   but may be used\
    \ for similar purposes in the future.\n"
- title: 2.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Namespace Considerations\n   The goal of the requested namespace is to ensure\
    \ the stability and\n   uniqueness of the names of various items that are used\
    \ within the\n   messages exchanged between the Eurosystem and the users of\n\
    \   TARGET2-Securities (or potentially, other future projects of the\n   Eurosystem).\n\
    \   It is essential that names of items (such as the XML schema\n   describing\
    \ the message itself) can be used to identify the resource\n   even years after\
    \ the message has been exchanged.  This context\n   requires a new namespace owned\
    \ by, and under the perpetual control\n   of, the Eurosystem.\n   The messaging\
    \ context of the needed identifiers necessitates the\n   usage of Uniform Resource\
    \ Identifiers (URIs) as specified in Internet\n   STD 66 [RFC3986].\n   The persistent\
    \ identifiers needed are protocol-independent resource\n   names -- the same resource\
    \ may exist in multiple physical locations,\n   and thus be accessible via multiple\
    \ URLs, but there's the need for a\n   single abstract identifier as a handle\
    \ (name) for it.\n   Thus, the logical choice for the placement of such a namespace\
    \ is the\n   use of Uniform Resource Names (URNs), as defined by [RFC1737] and\n\
    \   [RFC2141] (and its work-in-progress successor), by specifying a new\n   URN\
    \ Namespace [RFC3406] for the Eurosystem.\n"
- title: 3.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Community Considerations\n   The Eurosystem messages carrying the resource\
    \ names are exchanged in\n   IP networks.  Although the mass production use of\
    \ the assigned URNs\n   will be contained in messages carried in cryptographic\
    \ digital\n   envelopes or Virtual Private Networks, the message-related resources\n\
    \   being persistently named need to be referred to and resolved in the\n   public\
    \ Internet.  The transparency requirements (needed for\n   establishing and maintaining\
    \ public trust into the subject financial\n   transaction systems), open software\
    \ development processes, and\n   software deployment require the origin and authority\
    \ for the URNs to\n   be easily identified, and the URNs to be resolved on the\
    \ public\n   Internet.  URI references to the Eurosystem resources will be used\
    \ in\n   connection with identifiers drawn from previously standardized Formal\n\
    \   URN Namespaces allocated to other international treaty organizations,\n  \
    \ and it is mandatory that the authority behind the new URNs be easily\n   and\
    \ clearly identified, and be at a perceived \"equivalent\" standards\n   level,\
    \ parallel to the existing ones.  Therefore, a mnemonic, Formal\n   URN Namespace\
    \ Identifier is needed for the intended purpose.\n   Thus, this document specifies\
    \ a \"Formal URN Namespace\" using the\n   procedures laid down in RFC 3406 [RFC3406]\
    \ (and incorporates some of\n   the additional information under discussion for\
    \ its work-in-progress\n   successor into the registration template below).\n\
    \   The requested URN Namespace Identifier (NID) is 'eurosystem'.\n"

    \ structure of NSS part:\n      The structure of the Namespace Specific String\
    \ is a flat space of\n      printable URI characters (<pchar>; see RFC 3986),\
    \ with a\n      preference for short letter-digit-period-hyphen-based strings.\n\
    \      The NSS has no knowable structure outside of the context of the\n     \
    \ Eurosystem community internal resolver.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \      None\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special consideration.\n\
    \   Rules for Lexical Equivalence of NSS part:\n      No special consideration.\n\
    \   Usage of query part:\n      There is no support for query instructions or\
    \ other components of\n      the query part to be used in URI references to 'eurosystem'\
    \ URNs.\n   Usage of fragment part:\n      The fragment part of URI references\
    \ to 'eurosystem' URNs has no\n      particular specified utility.\n   Identifier\
    \ uniqueness considerations:\n      Identifiers are opaquely assigned by Eurosystem\
    \ URN Registration\n      that guarantees uniqueness.  This is simply achieved\
    \ by reliably\n      keeping track of already assigned names and comparing all\
    \ new\n      proposed names to the ones already present in the database.  If\n\
    \      the name already has been assigned, a new one has to be proposed.\n   Identifier\
    \ persistence considerations:\n      Assigned URNs will not be reused and will\
    \ remain valid beyond the\n      lifecycle of the referenced resources.  However,\
    \ it should be\n      noted that although the URNs remain valid, the status of\
    \ the\n      referenced resource may change.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n\
    \      Names are granted by Eurosystem URN Registration via proprietary\n    \
    \  registration procedures.\n      Future changes to the assignment methods may\
    \ allow others to\n      assign sub-spaces of the flat namespace, but again, this\
    \ knowledge\n      is only valid internally and should never be inferred or relied\n\
    \      upon externally.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      Eurosystem\
    \ URNs are resolved via URN resolvers run under\n      Eurosystem responsibility.\n\
    \      Initially, resolution service will be provided via a web page\n      listing\
    \ the assigned names and the related metadata of the named\n      resources.\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Since the URNs in this namespace are opaque,\
    \ there are no additional\n   security considerations other than those normally\
    \ associated with the\n   use and resolution of URIs and URNs in general (see\
    \ the Security\n   Considerations in Internet STD 66 [RFC3986], RFC 2141 [RFC2141],\
    \ and\n   BCP 66 [RFC3406]).\n   It is noted, however, that attempting to resolve\
    \ a Eurosystem URN\n   through a resolver other than the one provided by the Eurosystem\
    \ is\n   error prone.  In any case, it is not considered authoritative.\n"
