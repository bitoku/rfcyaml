  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Although HTML [RFC 1866] was designed within the context of MIME,\n\
    \   more than the specification of HTML as defined in RFC 1866 is needed\n   for\
    \ two electronic mail user agents to be able to interoperate using\n   HTML as\
    \ a document format. These issues include the naming of objects\n   that are normally\
    \ referred to by URIs, and the means of aggregating\n   objects that go together.\
    \ This document describes a set of guidelines\n   that will allow conforming mail\
    \ user agents to be able to send,\n   deliver and display these objects, such\
    \ as HTML objects, that can\n   contain links represented by URIs. In order to\
    \ be able to handle\n   inter-linked objects, the document uses the MIME type\n\
    \   multipart/related and specifies the MIME content-headers \"Content-\n   Location\"\
    \ and \"Content-Base\".\n"

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   There are a number of document formats, HTML [HTML2], PDF\
    \ [PDF] and\n   VRML for example, which provide links using URIs for their\n \
    \  resolution. There is an obvious need to be able to send documents in\n   these\
    \ formats in e-mail [RFC821=SMTP, RFC822]. This document gives\n   additional\
    \ specifications on how to send such documents in MIME [RFC\n   1521=MIME1] e-mail\
    \ messages. This version of this standard was based\n   on full consideration\
    \ only of the needs for objects with links in the\n   Text/HTML media type (as\
    \ defined in RFC 1866 [HTML2]), but the\n   standard may still be applicable also\
    \ to other formats for sets of\n   interlinked objects, linked by URIs. There\
    \ is no conformance\n   requirement that implementations claiming conformance\
    \ to this\n   standard are able to handle URI-s in other document formats than\n\
    \   HTML.\n   URIs in documents in HTML and other similar formats reference other\n\
    \   objects and resources, either embedded or directly accessible through\n  \
    \ hypertext links. When mailing such a document, it is often desirable\n   to\
    \ also mail all of the additional resources that are referenced in\n   it; those\
    \ elements are necessary for the complete interpretation of\n   the primary object.\n\
    \   An alternative way for sending an HTML document or other object\n   containing\
    \ URIs in e-mail is to only send the URL, and let the\n   recipient look up the\
    \ document using HTTP. That method is described\n   in [URLBODY] and is not described\
    \ in this document.\n   An informational RFC will at a later time be published\
    \ as a\n   supplement to this standard. The informational RFC will discuss\n \
    \  implementation methods and some implementation problems. Implementors\n   are\
    \ recommended to read this informational RFC when developing\n   implementations\
    \ of the MHTML standard. This informational RFC is,\n   when this RFC is published,\
    \ still in IETF draft status, and will stay\n   that way for at least six months\
    \ in order to gain more implementation\n   experience before it is published.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1 Conformance requirement terminology\n   This specification uses the same\
    \ words as RFC 1123 [HOSTS] for\n   defining the significance of each particular\
    \ requirement. These words\n   are:\n   MUST    This word or the adjective \"\
    required\" means that the item is\n           an absolute requirement of the specification.\n\
    \   SHOULD  This word or the adjective \"recommended\" means that there may\n\
    \           exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this\n \
    \          item, but the full implications should be understood and the\n    \
    \       case carefully weighed before choosing a different course.\n   MAY   \
    \  This word or the adjective \"optional\" means that this item is\n         \
    \  truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item\n           because\
    \ a particular marketplace requires it or because it\n           enhances the\
    \ product, for example; another vendor may omit\n           the same item.\n \
    \  An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more\n   of\
    \ the MUST requirements for the protocols it implements. An\n   implementation\
    \ that satisfies all the MUST and all the SHOULD\n   requirements for its protocols\
    \ is said to be \"unconditionally\n   compliant\"; one that satisfies all the\
    \ MUST requirements but not all\n   the SHOULD requirements for its protocols\

- title: 3. Overview
  contents:
  - "3. Overview\n   An aggregate document is a MIME-encoded message that contains\
    \ a root\n   document as well as other data that is required in order to represent\n\
    \   that document (inline pictures, style sheets, applets, etc.).\n   Aggregate\
    \ documents can also include additional elements that are\n   linked to the first\
    \ object.  It is important to keep in mind the\n   differing needs of several\
    \ audiences. Mail sending agents might send\n   aggregate documents as an encoding\
    \ of normal day-to-day electronic\n   mail. Mail sending agents might also send\
    \ aggregate documents when a\n   user wishes to mail a particular document from\
    \ the web to someone\n   else. Finally mail sending agents might send aggregate\
    \ documents as\n   automatic responders, providing access to WWW resources for\
    \ non-IP\n   connected clients.\n   Mail receiving agents also have several differing\
    \ needs. Some mail\n   receiving agents might be able to receive an aggregate\
    \ document and\n   display it just as any other text content type would be displayed.\n\
    \   Others might have to pass this aggregate document to a browsing\n   program,\
    \ and provisions need to be made to make this possible.\n   Finally several other\
    \ constraints on the problem arise. It is\n   important that it be possible for\
    \ a document to be signed and for it\n   to be able to be transmitted to a client\
    \ and displayed with a minimum\n   risk of breaking the message integrity (MIC)\
    \ check that is part of\n   the signature.\n"

- title: 4.1 MIME content headers
  contents:
  - "4.1 MIME content headers\n   In order to resolve URI references to other body\
    \ parts, two MIME\n   content headers are defined, Content-Location and Content-Base.\
    \ Both\n   these headers can occur in any message or content heading, and will\n\
    \   then be valid within this heading and for its content.\n   In practice, at\
    \ present only those URIs which are URLs are used, but\n   it is anticipated that\
    \ other forms of URIs will in the future be\n   used.\n   The syntax for these\
    \ headers is, using the syntax definition tools\n   from [RFC822]:\n       content-location\
    \ ::= \"Content-Location:\" ( absoluteURI |\n                            relativeURI\
    \ )\n       content-base ::= \"Content-Base:\" absoluteURI\n   where URI is at\
    \ present (June 1996) restricted to the syntax for URLs\n   as defined in RFC\
    \ 1738 [URL].\n   These two headers are valid only for exactly the content heading\
    \ or\n   message heading where they occurs and its text. They are thus not\n \
    \  valid for the parts inside multipart headings, and are thus\n   meaningless\
    \ in multipart headings.\n   These two headers may occur both inside and outside\
    \ of a\n   multipart/related part.\n"
- title: 4.2 The Content-Base header
  contents:
  - "4.2 The Content-Base header\n   The Content-Base gives a base for relative URIs\

- title: 4.3 The Content-Location Header
  contents:
  - "4.3 The Content-Location Header\n   The Content-Location header specifies the\
    \ URI that corresponds to the\n   content of the body part in whose heading the\
    \ header is placed. Its\n   value CAN be an absolute or relative URI. Any URI\
    \ or URL scheme may\n   be used, but use of non-standardized URI or URL schemes\
    \ might entail\n   some risk that recipients cannot handle them correctly.\n \
    \  The Content-Location header can be used to indicate that the data\n   sent\
    \ under this heading is also retrievable, in identical format,\n   through normal\
    \ use of this URI. If used for this purpose, it must\n   contain an absolute URI\
    \ or be resolvable, through a Content-Base\n   header, into an absolute URI. In\
    \ this case, the information sent in\n   the message can be seen as a cached version\
    \ of the original data.\n   The header can also be used for data which is not\
    \ available to some\n   or all recipients of the message, for example if the header\
    \ refers to\n   an object which is only retrievable using this URI in a restricted\n\
    \   domain, such as within a company-internal web space. The header can\n   even\
    \ contain a fictious URI and need in that case not be globally\n   unique.\n \

    \     (a) There is a base specification inside the MIME body part\n          containing\
    \ the link which resolves relative URIs into absolute\n          URIs. For example,\
    \ HTML provides the BASE element for this.\n     (b) There is a Content-Base header\
    \ (as defined in section 4.2),\n          specifying the base to be used.\n  \
    \   (c) There is a Content-Location header in the heading of the body\n      \
    \    part which can then serve as the base in the same way as the\n          requested\
    \ URI can serve as a base for relative URIs within a\n          file retrieved\

    \   multipart/alternative of which at least one alternative resolves to\n   such\

    \ URIs.\n       (c) For items which are not available on the web.\n       (d)\
    \ For any recipient to speed up access.\n   The type parameter of the \"Content-Type:\

    \   When a sending MUA sends objects which were retrieved from the WWW,\n   it\
    \ SHOULD maintain their WWW URIs. It SHOULD not transform these URIs\n   into\
    \ some other URI form prior to transmitting them. This will allow\n   the receiving\
    \ MUA to both verify MICs included with the email\n   message, as well as verify\
    \ the documents against their WWW\n   counterpoints.\n   In certain special cases\
    \ this will not work if the original HTML\n   document contains URIs as parameters\
    \ to objects and applets. In such\n   a case, it might be better to rewrite the\
    \ document before sending it.\n   This problem is discussed in more detail in\
    \ the informational RFC\n   which will be published as a supplement to this standard.\n\
    \   This standard does not cover the case where a multipart/related\n   contains\
    \ links to MIME body parts outside of the current\n   multipart/related or in\
    \ other MIME messages, even if methods similar\n   to those described in this\

  - "8.1 General principle\n   A body part, such as a text/HTML body part, may contain\
    \ hyperlinks to\n   objects which are included as other body parts in the same\
    \ message\n   and within the same multipart/related content. Often such linked\n\
    \   objects are meant to be displayed inline to the reader of the main\n   document;\
    \ for example, objects referenced with the IMG tag in HTML\n   [RFC 1866=HTML2].\
    \  New tags with this property are proposed in the\n   ongoing development of\
    \ HTML (example: applet, frame).\n   In order to send such messages, there is\
    \ a need to indicate which\n   other body parts are referred to by the links in\
    \ the body parts\n   containing such links. For example, a body part of Content-Type:\n\
    \   Text/HTML often has links to other objects, which might be included\n   in\
    \ other body parts in the same MIME message. The referencing of\n   other body\
    \ parts is done in the following way: For each body part\n   containing links\
    \ and each distinct URI within it, which refers to\n   data which is sent in the\
    \ same MIME message, there SHOULD be a\n   separate body part within the current\
    \ multipart/related part of the\n   message containing this data. Each such body\
    \ part SHOULD contain a\n   Content-Location header (see section 8.2) or a Content-ID\
    \ header (see\n   section 8.3).\n   An e-mail system which claims conformance\
    \ to this standard MUST\n   support receipt of multipart/related (as defined in\
    \ section 7) with\n   links between body parts using both the Content-Location\
    \ (as defined\n   in section 8.2) and the Content-ID method (as defined in section\n\
    \   8.3).\n"
- title: 8.2 Use of the Content-Location header
  contents:
  - "8.2 Use of the Content-Location header\n   If there is a Content-Base header,\
    \ then the recipient MUST employ\n   relative to absolute resolution as defined\
    \ in RFC 1808 [RELURL] of\n   relative URIs in both the HTML markup and the Content-Location\
    \ header\n   before matching a hyperlink in the HTML markup to a Content-Location\n\
    \   header. The same applies if the Content-Location contains an absolute\n  \
    \ URI, and the HTML markup contains a BASE element so that relative\n   URIs in\
    \ the HTML markup can be resolved.\n   If there is NO Content-Base header, and\
    \ the Content-Location header\n   contains a relative URI, then NO relative to\
    \ absolute resolution\n   SHOULD be performed. Matching the relative URI in the\
    \ Content-\n   Location header to a hyperlink in an HTML markup text is in this\
    \ case\n   a two step process. First remove any LWSP from the relative URI which\n\
    \   may have been introduced as described in section 4.4. Then perform an\n  \
    \ exact textual match against the HTML URIs. For this matching process,\n   ignore\
    \ BASE specifications, such as the BASE element in HTML. Note\n   that this only\
    \ applies for matching Content-Location headers, not for\n   URL-s in the HTML\
    \ document which are resolved through network look up\n   at read time.\n   The\
    \ URI in the Content-Location header need not refer to an object\n   which is\
    \ actually available globally for retrieval using this URI\n   (after resolution\
    \ of relative URIs). However, URI-s in Content-\n   Location headers (if absolute,\
    \ or resolvable to absolute URIs) SHOULD\n   still be globally unique.\n"

    \ as defined in RFC 1738 [URL] and RFC 1873\n   [MIDCID] are used for links between\
    \ body parts, the Content-Location\n   statement will normally be replaced by\
    \ a Content-ID header. Thus, the\n   following two headers are identical in meaning:\n\
    \   Content-ID: foo@bar.net\n   Content-Location: CID: foo@bar.net\n   Note: Content-IDs\
    \ MUST be globally unique [MIME1]. It is thus not\n   permitted to make them unique\

  contents:
  - "11. Character encoding issues and end-of-line issues\n   For the encoding of\
    \ characters in HTML documents and other text\n   documents into a MIME-compatible\
    \ octet stream, the following\n   mechanisms are relevant:\n   - HTML [HTML2,\
    \ HTML-I18N] as an application of SGML [SGML] allows\n     characters to be denoted\
    \ by character entities as well as by numeric\n     character references (e.g.\
    \ \"Latin small letter a with acute accent\"\n     may be represented by \"&aacute;\"\
    \ or \"&#225;\") in the HTML markup.\n   - HTML documents, in common with other\
    \ documents of the MIME\n     \"Content-Type  text\", can be represented in MIME\
    \ using one of\n     several character encodings. The MIME Content-Type \"charset\"\
    \n     parameter value indicates the particular encoding used. For the\n     exact\
    \ meaning and use of the \"charset\" parameter, please see\n     [MIME-IMB section\
    \ 4.2].\n      Note that the \"charset\" parameter refers only to the MIME\n \
    \     character encoding. For example, the string \"&aacute;\" can be sent\n \
    \     in MIME with \"charset=US-ASCII\", while the raw character \"Latin\n   \
    \   small letter a with acute accent\" cannot.\n   The above mechanisms are well\
    \ defined and documented, and therefore\n   not further explained here. In sending\
    \ a message, all the above\n   mentioned mechanisms MAY be used, and any mixture\
    \ of them MAY occur\n   when sending the document via e-mail. Receiving mail user\
    \ agents\n   (together with any Web browser they may use to display the document)\n\
    \   MUST be capable of handling any combinations of these mechanisms.\n   Also\
    \ note that:\n   - Any documents including HTML documents that contain octet values\n\
    \     outside the 7-bit range need a content-transfer-encoding applied\n     before\
    \ transmission over certain transport protocols\n     [MIME1, chapter 5].\n  \
    \ - The MIME standard [MIME1] requires that documents of \"Content-Type:\n   \
    \  Text MUST be in canonical form before Content-Transfer-Encoding,\n     i.e.\
    \ that line breaks are encoded as CRLFs, not as bare CRs or bare\n     LFs or\
    \ something else. This is in contrast to [HTTP] where section\n     3.6.1 allows\
    \ other representations of line breaks.\n   Note that this might cause problems\
    \ with integrity checks based on\n   checksums, which might not be preserved when\
    \ moving a document from\n   the HTTP to the MIME environment. If a document has\
    \ to be converted\n   in such a way that a checksum integrity check becomes invalid,\
    \ then\n   this integrity check header SHOULD be removed from the document.\n\
    \   Other sources of problems are Content-Encoding used in HTTP but not\n   allowed\
    \ in MIME, and charsets that are not able to represent line\n   breaks as CRLF.\
    \ A good overview of the differences between HTTP and\n   MIME with regards to\
    \ \"Content-Type: Text\" can be found in [HTTP],\n   appendix C.\n   If the original\
    \ document has line breaks in the canonical form\n   (CRLF), then the document\
    \ SHOULD remain unconverted so that integrity\n   check sums are not invalidated.\n\
    \   A provider of HTML documents who wants his documents to be\n   transferable\
    \ via both HTTP and SMTP without invalidating checksum\n   integrity checks, should\
    \ always provide original documents in the\n   canonical form with CRLF for line\
    \ breaks.\n   Some transport mechanisms may specify a default \"charset\" parameter\n\
    \   if none is supplied [HTTP, MIME1]. Because the default differs for\n   different\
    \ mechanisms, when HTML is transferred through mail, the\n   charset parameter\
    \ SHOULD be included, rather than relying on the\n   default.\n"
- title: 12. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "12. Security Considerations\n   Some Security Considerations include the potential\
    \ to mail someone an\n   object, and claim that it is represented by a particular\
    \ URI (by\n   giving it a Content-Location header). There can be no assurance\
    \ that\n   a WWW request for that same URI would normally result in that same\n\
    \   object. It might be unsuitable to cache the data in such a way that\n   the\
    \ cached data can be used for retrieval of this URI from other\n   messages or\
    \ message parts than those included in the same message as\n   the Content-Location\
    \ header. Because of this problem, receiving User\n   Agents SHOULD not cache\
    \ this data in the same way that data that was\n   retrieved through an HTTP or\
    \ FTP request might be cached.\n   URLs, especially File URLs, may in their name\
    \ contain company-\n   internal information, which may then inadvertently be revealed\
    \ to\n   recipients of documents containing such URLs.\n   One way of implementing\
    \ messages with linked body parts is to handle\n   the linked body parts in a\
    \ combined mail and WWW proxy server. The\n   mail client is only given the start\
    \ body part, which it passes to a\n   web browser. This web browser requests the\
    \ linked parts from the\n   proxy server. If this method is used, and if the combined\
    \ server is\n   used by more than one user, then methods must be employed to ensure\n\
    \   that body parts of a message to one person is not retrievable by\n   another\
    \ person.  Use of passwords (also known as tickets or magic\n   cookies) is one\
    \ way of achieving this. Note that some caching WWW\n   proxy servers may not\
    \ distinguish between cached objects from e-mail\n   and HTTP, which may be a\
    \ security risk.\n   In addition, by allowing people to mail aggregate objects,\
    \ we are\n   opening the door to other potential security problems that until\
    \ now\n   were only problems for WWW users. For example, some HTML documents\n\
    \   now either themselves contain executable content (JavaScript) or\n   contain\
    \ links to executable content (The \"INSERT\" specification,\n   Java). It would\
    \ be exceedingly dangerous for a receiving User Agent\n   to execute content received\
    \ through a mail message without careful\n   attention to restrictions on the\
    \ capabilities of that executable\n   content.\n   Some WWW applications hide\
    \ passwords and tickets (access tokens to\n   information which may not be available\
    \ to anyone) and other sensitive\n   information in hidden fields in the web documents\
    \ or in on-the-fly\n   constructed URLs. If a person gets such a document, and\
    \ forwards it\n   via e-mail, the person may inadvertently disclose sensitive\n\
    \   information.\n"
