  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the certificate policy for a Public Key\n\
    \   Infrastructure (PKI) used to support attestations about Internet\n   Number\
    \ Resource (INR) holdings.  Each organization that distributes\n   IP addresses\
    \ or Autonomous System (AS) numbers to an organization\n   will, in parallel,\
    \ issue a (public key) certificate reflecting this\n   distribution.  These certificates\
    \ will enable verification that the\n   resources indicated in the certificate\
    \ have been distributed to the\n   holder of the associated private key and that\
    \ this organization is\n   the current, unique holder of these resources.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the certificate policy for a Public\
    \ Key\n   Infrastructure (PKI) used to attest to Internet Number Resource (INR)\n\
    \   holdings (IP addresses or Autonomous System (AS) numbers).  An\n   organization\
    \ that distributes INRs to another organization MAY, in\n   parallel, issue a\
    \ (public key) certificate reflecting this\n   distribution.  These certificates\
    \ will enable verification that the\n   resources indicated in the certificate\
    \ have been distributed to the\n   holder of the associated private key and that\
    \ this organization is\n   the current holder of these resources.\n   The most\
    \ important and distinguishing aspect of the PKI for which\n   this policy was\
    \ created is that it does not purport to identify an\n   INR holder via the subject\
    \ name contained in the certificate issued\n   to that entity.  Rather, each certificate\
    \ issued under this policy is\n   intended to enable an entity to assert, in a\
    \ verifiable fashion, that\n   it is the current holder of an INR based on the\
    \ current records of\n   the entity responsible for the resources in question.\
    \  Verification\n   of the assertion is based on two criteria: the ability of\
    \ the entity\n   to digitally sign data that is verifiable using the public key\n\
    \   contained in the corresponding certificate, and validation of that\n   certificate\
    \ in the context of this PKI.\n   This PKI is designed exclusively for use in\
    \ support of validation of\n   claims related to current INR holdings.  This includes\
    \ any\n   certificates issued in support of operation of this infrastructure,\n\
    \   e.g., for integrity or access control of the repository system\n   described\
    \ in Section 2.4.  Such transitive uses of certificates also\n   are permitted\
    \ under this policy.  Use of the certificates and\n   Certificate Revocation Lists\
    \ (CRLs) managed under this PKI for any\n   other purpose is a violation of this\
    \ CP, and relying parties (RPs)\n   SHOULD reject certificates presented for such\
    \ uses.\n   Note: This document is based on the template specified in RFC 3647\n\
    \   [RFC3647], a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\n   stream.\
    \  In the interest of keeping the document as short as\n   reasonable, a number\
    \ of sections contained in the template have been\n   omitted from this policy\
    \ because they do not apply to this PKI.\n   However, we have retained the section\
    \ numbering scheme employed in\n   RFC 3647 to facilitate comparison with the\
    \ outline in Section 6 of\n   RFC 3647.  Each of these omitted sections should\
    \ be read as \"No\n   stipulation\" in Certificate Policy (CP) / Certification\
    \ Practice\n   Statement (CPS) parlance.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   This PKI is designed to support validation of claims by current\n\
    \   holders of INRs, in accordance with the records of the organizations\n   that\
    \ act as Certification Authorities (CAs) in this PKI.  The ability\n   to verify\
    \ such claims is essential to ensuring the unambiguous\n   distribution of these\
    \ resources [RFC6480].\n   The structure of the RPKI is congruent with the number\
    \ resource\n   allocation framework of the Internet.  The IANA allocates number\n\
    \   resources to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), to others, and for\n   special\
    \ purposes [RFC5736].  The RIRs, in turn, manage the allocation\n   of number\
    \ resources to end users, Internet Service Providers, and\n   others.\n   This\
    \ PKI encompasses several types of certificates (see [RFC6487] for\n   more details):\n\
    \   o  CA certificates for each organization distributing INRs and for\n     \
    \ INR holders\n   o  End-entity (EE) certificates for organizations to validate\
    \ digital\n      signatures on RPKI signed objects\n"

    \ of INRs - A process of distribution of the INRs along\n          the respective\
    \ number hierarchy.  IANA distributes blocks of\n          IP addresses and AS\
    \ numbers to the five Regional Internet\n          Registries (RIRs).  RIRs distribute\
    \ smaller address blocks and\n          AS numbers to organizations within their\
    \ service regions, who\n          in turn distribute IP addresses to their customers.\n\
    \   IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.  IANA is responsible for\n   \
    \       global coordination of the IP addressing system and AS numbers\n     \
    \     used for routing Internet traffic.  IANA distributes INRs to\n         \
    \ Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).\n   INRs - Internet Number Resources. \
    \ INRs are number values for three\n          protocol parameter sets, namely:\n\
    \          o  IP version 4 addresses,\n          o  IP version 6 addresses, and\n\
    \          o  Identifiers used in Internet inter-domain routing,\n           \
    \  currently Border Gateway Protocol-4 AS numbers.\n   ISP -  Internet Service\
    \ Provider.  This is an organization managing\n          and providing Internet\
    \ services to other organizations.\n   LIR -  Local Internet Registry.  In some\
    \ regions, this term is used\n          to refer to what is called an ISP in other\
    \ regions.\n   NIR -  National Internet Registry.  This is an organization that\n\
    \          manages the distribution of INRs for a portion of the\n          geopolitical\
    \ area covered by a Regional Registry.  NIRs form\n          an optional second\
    \ tier in the tree scheme used to manage\n          INRs.\n   RIR -  Regional\
    \ Internet Registry.  This is an organization that\n          manages the distribution\
    \ of INRs for a geopolitical area.\n   RPKI signed object - An RPKI signed object\
    \ is a digitally signed data\n          object (other than a certificate or CRL)\
    \ that is declared to\n          be such by a Standards Track RFC, and that can\

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   According to X.509, a certificate policy (CP)\
    \ is \"a named set of\n   rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate\
    \ to a\n   particular community and/or class of applications with common\n   security\
    \ requirements.\" A CP may be used by a relying party to help\n   in deciding\
    \ whether a certificate and the binding therein are\n   sufficiently trustworthy\
    \ and otherwise appropriate for a particular\n   application.  This document describes\
    \ the CP for the Resource Public\n   Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  There are separate\
    \ documents (CPSs) that\n   cover the factors that determine the degree to which\
    \ a relying party\n   can trust the binding embodied in a certificate.  The degree\
    \ to which\n   such a binding can be trusted depends on several factors, e.g.,\
    \ the\n   practices followed by the CA in authenticating the subject; the CA's\n\
    \   operating policy, procedures, and technical security controls,\n   including\
    \ the scope of the subscriber's responsibilities (for\n   example, in protecting\
    \ the private key), and the stated\n   responsibilities and liability terms and\
    \ conditions of the CA (for\n   example, warranties, disclaimers of warranties,\
    \ and limitations of\n   liability).\n   Since name uniqueness within the RPKI\
    \ cannot be guaranteed, there is\n   a risk that two or more CAs in the RPKI will\
    \ issue certificates and\n   CRLs under the same issuer name.  Path validation\
    \ implementations\n   that conform to the resource certification path validation\
    \ algorithm\n   (see [RFC6487]) verify that the same key was used to sign both\
    \ the\n   target (the resource certificate) and the corresponding CRL.  So, a\n\
    \   name collision will not change the result.  Use of the basic X.509\n   path\
    \ validation algorithm, which assumes name uniqueness, could\n   result in a revoked\
    \ certificate being accepted as valid or a valid\n   certificate being rejected\
    \ as revoked.  Relying parties must ensure\n   that the software they use to validate\
    \ certificates issued under this\n   policy verifies that the same key was used\
    \ to sign both the\n   certificate and the corresponding CRL, as specified in\
    \ [RFC6487].\n"
