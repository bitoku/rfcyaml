  - "Introduction\n   A meeting was held on the 11th of January 1982 at USC Information\n\
    \   Sciences Institute to discuss addressing issues in computer mail.\n   The\
    \ attendees are listed at the end of this memo.  The major\n   conclusion reached\
    \ at the meeting is to extend the\n   \"username@hostname\" mailbox format to\
    \ \"username@host.domain\", where\n   the domain itself can be further structured.\n"

  - "Overview\n   The meeting opened with a brief discussion of the objectives of\
    \ the\n   meeting and a review of the agenda.\n      The meeting was called to\
    \ discuss a few specific issues in text\n      mail systems for the ARPA Internet.\
    \  In particular, issues of\n      addressing are of major concern as we develop\
    \ an internet in which\n      mail relaying is a common occurance.  We need to\
    \ discuss\n      alternatives in the design of the mail system to provide high\n\
    \      utility at reasonable cost.  One scheme suggested is to create\n      \"\
    mail domains\" which are another level of addressing.  The ad hoc\n      scheme\
    \ of source routing, while effective for some cases, is seen\n      to lead to\
    \ some problems.  A key test of addressing schemes is the\n      procedure for\
    \ sending copies of a reply to a message to the people\n      who received copies\
    \ of the original message.  The key reference\n      documents for the meeting\
    \ were RFCs 788, 799, and 801.\n   Jon Postel gave a brief review of the NCP-to-TCP\
    \ transition plan (RFC\n   801).  The emphasis was on mail, the internet host\
    \ table, and the\n   role of a Host Name Server.\n   The major part of the meeting\
    \ was devoted to a wide ranging\n   discussion of the general mailbox identification\
    \ problem.  In\n   particular, the notion of a hierarchial structure of name domains\
    \ was\n   discussed, and the issues associated with name servers were discussed\n\
    \   including the types of information name servers should provide.\n"

    \ principle, be replaced by a \"unique-id@location-id\" model, where the\n   unique-id\
    \ would be a globally unique id for this mailbox (independent\n   of location)\
    \ and the location-id would be advice about where to find\n   the mailbox.  However,\
    \ it was recognized that the \"user@host\" model\n   was well established and\
    \ that so many different elaborations of the\n   \"user\" field were already in\
    \ use that there was no point in persuing\n   this \"unique-id\" idea at this\
    \ time.\n   Several alternatives for the structuring and ordering of the\n   extensions\
    \ to the \"host\" field to make it into a general\n   \"location-id\" were discussed.\n\
    \      These basically involved adding more hierarchical name information\n  \
    \    either to the right or the left of the @, with the \"higher order\"\n   \
    \   portion rightmost or leftmost.  It was clear that the information\n      content\
    \ of all these syntactic alternatives was the same, so that\n      the one causing\
    \ least difficulty for existing systems should be\n      chosen.  Hence it was\
    \ decided to add all new information on the\n      right of the @ sign, leaving\
    \ the \"user\" field to the left\n      completely to each system to determine\
    \ (in particular to avoid the\n      problem that some systems already use dot\
    \ (.) internally as part\n      of user names).\n   The conclusion in this area\
    \ was that the current \"user@host\" mailbox\n   identifier should be extended\
    \ to \"user@host.domain\" where \"domain\"\n   could be a hierarchy of domains.\n\
    \      In particular, the \"host\" field would become a \"location\" field\n \
    \     and the structure would read (left to right) from the most\n      specific\
    \ to the most general.\n         For example: \"Postel@F.ISI.IN\" might be the\
    \ mailbox of Jon\n         Postel on host F in the ISI complex of the Internet\
    \ domain.\n      Formally, in RFC733, the host-indicator definition rule would\n\
    \      become:\n         host indicator = ( \"at\" / \"@\" ) domains\n       \
    \  domains = node / node \".\" domains\n            Note only one \"at\" or \"\
    @\" is allowed, and that the domains\n            form a hierarchy with the most\
    \ general in scope last.\n            And note that the choice of domain names\
    \ must be\n            administratively controlled and the highest level domain\n\
    \            names must be globally unique.\n"

    \    The hierarchial domain type naming differs from source routing in\n     \
    \ that the former gives absolute addressing while the latter gives\n      relative\
    \ adressing.\n"
- title: Name Servers
  contents:
  - "Name Servers\n   The discussion of name servers identified three separate name\
    \ server\n   functions: \"white pages\", \"unique-id to location-id\", and\n \
    \  \"location-id to address\".\n      The \"white pages\" service is a way of\
    \ looking up a user by name\n      and other properties using pattern matching\
    \ and may return several\n      data base \"hits\".  Each hit must have an associated\
    \ unique-id.\n      The \"unique-id to location-id\" service returns the character\n\
    \      string location-id where the unique-id is currently found.\n      The \"\
    location-id to address\" service returns a network address\n      (numeric) corresponding\
    \ to the location-id.\n         If the location-id is the name of a host in the\
    \ current domain\n         it is clear that the address returned will be the address\
    \ to\n         send the mail to, but if the location-id is that of some other\n\
    \         domain then the address returned may be either the address to\n    \
    \     send the mail to, or the address of a name server for that\n         domain,\
    \ and these two cases must be distinguished.\n   The conclusion of this discussion\
    \ was that a location-id to address\n   name service must be defined soon.  The\
    \ other types of name servers\n   were not further discussed, and are not required\
    \ in the\n   implemenation.\n   Another aspect of the name server is returning\
    \ additional information\n   besides the address.  In particular, for mail it\
    \ is important to know\n   which mail procedures the destination implements (NCP/FTP,\
    \ TCP/SMTP,\n   etc.).  Two approaches were discussed: one is coding the information\n\
    \   as service names (e.g., NCP/SMTP), and the other is by reference to\n   protocol\
    \ and port numbers (e.g., PROTOCOL=6, PORT=25).  Another\n   suggestion was that\
    \ the request ought to be \"location-id,service\"\n   (e.g., \"ISIF.IN,MAIL\"\
    ) and the response ought to be the location-id,\n   address, protocol, and port.\
    \  A different way of getting this\n   information was suggested that instead\
    \ of (or in addition to) having\n   this information in the name server, one should\
    \ get this data from\n   the host itself via some sort of query or \"who are you\"\
    \ protocol.\n   Also discussed was the initial  provision for name service.  It\
    \ seems\n   useful to start with a text file that can be accessed via FTP, and\
    \ to\n   have both \"Telnet-Like\" (i.e., based on TCP) and \"Datagram\" (i.e.,\n"

    \ based on UDP) access to a query server.  This might be possible as an\n   extension\
    \ of the IEN-116 name server.\n   Another issue was the central vs. distributed\
    \ implementation of the\n   name look up service.  It is recognized that separate\
    \ servers for\n   each domain has administrative and maintenance advantages, but\
    \ that a\n   central server may be a useful first step.  It is also recognized\n\
    \   that each distinct database should be replicated a few times and be\n   avialiable\
    \ from distinct servers for robust and reliable service.\n   An Example:\n   \
    \   Suppose that the new mailbox specification is of the form\n      USER@HOST.ORG.DOMAIN.\n\
    \         e.g., Postel@F.ISI.IN\n      A source host sending mail to this address\
    \ first queries a name\n      server for the domain IN (giving the whole location\
    \ \"F.ISI.IN\").\n      The result of the query is either (1) the final address\
    \ of the\n      destination host (F.ISI), or (2) the address of a name server\
    \ for\n      ISI, or (3) the address of a forwarder for ISI.  In cases 1 and 3,\n\
    \      the source host sends the mail to the address returned.  In case\n    \
    \  2,  the source host queries the ISI name server and ... (recursive\n      call\
    \ to this paragraph).\n"
