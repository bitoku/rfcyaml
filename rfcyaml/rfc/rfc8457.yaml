  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) specification
    [RFC3501]\n   defines the use of message keywords, and an \"IMAP Keywords\" registry\n
    \  is created in [RFC5788].  [RFC6154] defines an extension to the IMAP\n   LIST
    command for special-use mailboxes.  The extension allows servers\n   to provide
    extra information (attributes) about the purpose of a\n   mailbox and defines
    an initial set of special-use attributes.\n   This document does the following:\n
    \  o  defines a new message keyword, \"$Important\", to apply to messages\n      that
    are considered important for the user by some externally\n      defined criteria;\n
    \  o  registers the \"$Important\" keyword in the \"IMAP Keywords\"\n      registry;\n
    \  o  defines a new special-use attribute, \"\\Important\", to designate a\n      mailbox
    that will hold messages that are considered important for\n      the user by some
    externally defined criteria; and\n   o  creates a registry for IMAP mailbox attributes
    and registers the\n      new attribute and those defined in [RFC5258], [RFC3501],
    and\n      [RFC6154].\n"

  - "2.  Definition of the \"$Important\" Message Keyword\n   The \"$Important\" keyword
    is a signal that a message is likely\n   important to the user.  The keyword is
    generally expected to be set\n   automatically by the system based on available
    signals (such as who\n   the message is from, who else the message is addressed
    to, evaluation\n   of the subject or content, or other heuristics).  While the
    keyword\n   also can be set by the user, that is not expected to be the primary\n
    \  usage.\n   This is distinct from the \"\\Flagged\" system flag in two ways:\n
    \  1.  \"$Important\" carries a meaning of general importance, as opposed\n       to
    follow-up or urgency.  It is meant to be used for a form of\n       triage, with
    \"\\Flagged\" remaining as a designation of special\n       attention, need for
    follow-up, or time sensitivity.  In\n       particular, the sense of \"$Important\"
    is that other messages that\n       are \"like this one\" according to some server-applied
    heuristics\n       will also be considered \"$Important\".\n   2.  The setting
    of \"$Important\" is expected to be based at least\n       partly on heuristics
    (generally set automatically by the server),\n       whereas \"\\Flagged\" is
    only intended to be set by the user with\n       some sort of \"flag this message\"
    or \"put a star on this message\"\n       interface.\n"

  - "3.  Definition of the 'Important' Mailbox Attribute\n   The \"\\Important\" mailbox
    attribute is a signal that the mailbox\n   contains messages that are likely important
    to the user.  In an\n   implementation that also supports the \"$Important\" keyword,
    this\n   special use is likely to represent a virtual mailbox collecting\n   messages
    (from other mailboxes) that are marked with the \"$Important\"\n   keyword.  In
    other implementations, the system might automatically\n   put messages there based
    on the same sorts of heuristics that are\n   noted for the \"$Important\" keyword
    (see Section 2).  The distinctions\n   between \"\\Important\" and \"\\Flagged\"
    for mailboxes are similar to\n   those between \"$Important\" and \"\\Flagged\"
    for messages.\n"

  - "4.  Implementation Notes\n   This section is non-normative and is intended to
    describe the\n   intended (and current as of this publication) usage of \"$Important\"\n
    \  in contrast with \"\\Flagged\" on a message.\n   On the server:\n   o  \"\\Flagged\"
    is set or cleared in response to an explicit command\n      from the client.\n
    \  o  \"$Important\" is set via a heuristic process performed by the\n      server
    and usually involves analysis of header fields, what\n      mailbox the message
    is filed in, perhaps message content,\n      attachments, and such.  It may then
    be set or cleared in response\n      to an explicit command from the client, and
    the server may use\n      that to adjust the heuristics in the future.  It's also
    possible\n      that the server will re-evaluate this and make a message\n      \"$Important\"
    later if the user accesses the message frequently,\n      for example.\n   On
    the client:\n   o  Typically, an icon such as a flag or a star (or an indication,\n
    \     such as red or bold text) is associated with \"\\Flagged\", and the\n      UI
    provides a way for the user to turn that icon or indication on\n      or off.
    \ Manipulation of this results in a command to the server.\n   o  Typically, a
    lesser indication is used for \"$Important\".  The\n      client might or might
    not provide the user with a way to\n      manipulate it.  If it does, manipulation
    results in a command to\n      the server.\n"
  title: 4.  Implementation Notes
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations in Section 7 of [RFC6154]
    apply equally\n   to this extension, in particular, \"Conveying special-use information\n
    \  to a client exposes a small bit of extra information that could be of\n   value
    to an attacker.\"  Moreover, identifying important messages or a\n   place where
    important messages are kept could give an attacker a\n   strategic starting point.
    \ If the algorithm by which messages are\n   determined to be important is well
    known, still more information is\n   exposed -- perhaps, for example, there is
    an implication that the\n   senders of these messages are particularly significant
    to the mailbox\n   owner, and perhaps that is information that should not be made\n
    \  public.\n   As noted in RFC 6154, it is wise to protect the IMAP channel from\n
    \  passive eavesdropping and to defend against unauthorized discernment\n   of
    the identity of a user's \"\\Important\" mailbox or of a user's\n   \"$Important\"
    messages.  See Section 11 of [RFC3501] for security\n   considerations about using
    the IMAP STARTTLS command to protect the\n   IMAP channel.\n"

    - "6.2.  Creation of the IMAP Mailbox Name Attributes Registry\n   IANA has created
      a new registry in the group \"Internet Message Access\n   Protocol (IMAP)\".
      \ It is called \"IMAP Mailbox Name Attributes\", and\n   it has two references:
      \"RFC 3501, Section 7.2.2\", and \"RFC 8457,\n   Section 6\".  This registry
      will be shared with the JSON Meta\n   Application Protocol (JMAP) for Mail [JMAP-MAIL].\n
      \  The registry entries contain the following fields:\n   1.  Attribute Name\n
      \  2.  Description\n   3.  Reference\n   4.  Usage Notes\n   IANA keeps this
      list in alphabetical order by Attribute Name, which\n   is registered without
      the initial backslash (\"\\\").  The names are\n   generally registered with
      initial capital letters but are treated as\n   case-insensitive US-ASCII strings.\n
      \  The \"Usage Notes\" field is free-form US-ASCII text that will normally\n
      \  be empty (and is empty if it's not specified in the registration\n   request).
      \ It is intended to hold things such as \"not used by JMAP\"\n   and \"JMAP
      only\".  The field is for human use, and there is no need\n   for a registry
      of strings that may appear here.\n   The registration policy for the new registry
      is listed as \"IETF\n   Review\" or \"Expert Review\" [RFC8126], and new registrations
      will be\n   accepted in one of two ways:\n   1.  For registrations requested
      in an IETF consensus document, the\n       registration policy will be IETF
      Review, and the request will be\n       made in the IANA Considerations section
      of the document, which\n       gives the requested values for each of the fields.\n
      \  2.  For other registrations, the policy will be Expert Review policy\n       (see
      Section 6.2.1), and the request will be made by sending\n       email to IANA
      asking for a new IMAP Mailbox Name Attribute and\n       giving the requested
      values for each of the fields.  While a\n       formal specification is not
      required, the reference document\n       should provide a description of the
      proposed attribute sufficient\n       for building interoperable implementations.
      \ An Informational RFC\n       (submitted, for example, through the IETF or
      Independent stream)\n       is a fine way to publish a reference document (see
      also\n       Section 6.2.1).\n"

      - "6.2.1.  Instructions to the Designated Expert\n   The expert reviewer, who

        description are adequate for\n   understanding the intent of the registered
