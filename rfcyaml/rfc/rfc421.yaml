  - "            A SOFTWARE CONSULTING SERVICE FOR NETWORK USERS\n     As actual or\
    \ attempted Network use has grown, it has become\nincreasingly apparent that users\
    \ with real problems to solve are not\nafforded the kinds of software assistance\
    \ and consulting services\nnormally provided by computer service facilities. Two\
    \ mechanisms which\nwere designed to help fill the void in the past are the Resources\n\
    Notebook and the designation of Techincal Liaisons. Unfortunately, the\nResources\
    \ Notebook tends to have a long undate cycle, and Technical\nLiaisons are frequently\
    \ systems programmers who may work at odd hours\nand are sometimes impatient with\
    \ the questions of naive users.\n     In an attempt to deal with this problem\
    \ in a more satisfactory way,\nBBN recently aided a \"software consultant\", Nancy\
    \ Neigus, to the\nNetwortk Control Center staff. Nancy has extensive software\
    \ experience\non a number of systems, and has spent the last few months familiarizing\n\
    with server systems and subsystems via the network.\n     This consulting service\
    \ is experimental in nature, and as such its\nlimits, even its continued existance,\
    \ will be influenced by the\nexpressed needs of the user community. Altough the\
    \ primary goal is for\nNancy to provide assistan ce in using existing resources,\
    \ we do not\n(currently) exclude the possibility of her participation in such\n\
    projects as the checkout of protocol implementations and resolution of\nany discovered\
    \ conflicts. In some cases, it may turn out that successful\nnetwork operation\
    \ of a subsystem requires changes to Host software; we\nwill attempt to act as\
    \ a repository and dispatch point of reported\ndifficulties of its kind.\n   \
    \     Nancy can be contacted via the Network Control Center\ntelephone:\n    \
    \    (617) 611-0100\nCollect calls will be accepted. She will normally be available\
    \ between\n9am and 5pm (Eastern Time) weekdays, but the NCC has round-the-clock\n\
    operator coverage and the operators will take messages for her at\nother times.\
    \ Online messages may also be left at the NIC for \"NJN\",\nor, for TIP users,\
    \ vis the \"Gripe\" service (see TIP news).\n        Please inform users at your\
    \ site of the this software\nconsulting service, and encourage them to try it.\n\
