  - "Abstract\n   This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in\n\
    \   currently deployed IETF Sub-IP Area documented standards.  In order\n   to\
    \ successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6\n   Internet,\
    \ many interim steps will be taken.  One of these steps is\n   the evolution of\
    \ current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.  It\n   is hoped that these protocols\
    \ (and their implementations) will be\n   redesigned to be network address independent,\
    \ but failing that will\n   at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end,\
    \ all Standards\n   (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will\
    \ be\n   surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of a document set aiming to document\
    \ all usage\n   of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards.  In an effort to have the\n\
    \   information in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents\n  \
    \ conforming to the current IETF areas (Application,  Internet,\n   Operations\
    \ & Management, Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport).\n   For a full introduction,\
    \ please see the introduction [1].\n"
- title: 2.  Document Organization
  contents:
  - "2.  Document Organization\n   The rest of the document sections are described\
    \ below.\n   Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full,\n\
    \   Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each RFC is\n   discussed\
    \ in its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with (around)\n   RFC 3100. The comments\
    \ for each RFC are \"raw\" in nature.  That is,\n   each RFC is discussed in a\
    \ vacuum and problems or issues discussed do\n   not \"look ahead\" to see if\
    \ the problems have already been fixed.\n   Section 7 is an analysis of the data\
    \ presented in Sections 3, 4, 5,\n   and 6.  It is here that all of the results\
    \ are considered as a whole\n   and the problems that have been resolved in later\
    \ RFCs are\n   correlated.\n"
- title: 3.  Full Standards
  contents:
  - "3.  Full Standards\n   Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred\
    \ to as\n   \"Standards\") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely\n\
    \   implemented and used throughout the Internet.\n   There are no full standards\
    \ within the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Draft Standards
  contents:
  - "4.  Draft Standards\n   Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level\
    \ in the IETF.\n   A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple,\n\
    \   independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards are\n   usually\
    \ quite mature and widely used.\n   There are no draft standards within the scope\
    \ of this document.\n"
- title: 5.  Proposed Standards
  contents:
  - "5.  Proposed Standards\n   Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.\
    \  There are no\n   requirements for even a single implementation.  In many cases\n\
    \   Proposed are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards\n   process.\
    \  They therefore are often just proposed ideas that are\n   presented to the\
    \ Internet community.  Sometimes flaws are exposed or\n   they are one of many\
    \ competing solutions to problems.  In these later\n   cases, no discussion is\
    \ presented as it would not serve the purpose\n   of this discussion.\n   5.01.\
    \  RFC 3031 Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)\n      There are\
    \ no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.\n   5.02.  RFC 3032 MPLS Label Stack\
    \ Encoding\n      This specification is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no\n\
    \      changes.\n   5.03.  RFC 3034 Use of Label Switching on Frame Relay Networks\n\
    \         Specification\n      There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.\n\
    \   5.04.  RFC 3035 MPLS using LDP and ATM VC Switching\n      There are no IPv4\
    \ dependencies in this specification.\n   5.05.  RFC 3036 LDP Specification\n\
    \      This specification is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no\n      changes.\n\
    \   5.06.  RFC 3038 VCID Notification over ATM link for LDP\n      There are no\
    \ IPv4 dependencies in this specification.\n"
- title: 6.  Experimental RFCs
  contents:
  - "6.  Experimental RFCs\n   Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do\
    \ not have\n   widescale implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are often\n\
    \   propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented\n   to\
    \ the Internet community in order to allow potential\n   interoperability or some\
    \ other potential useful scenario.  In a few\n   cases they are presented as alternatives\
    \ to the mainstream solution\n   to an acknowledged problem.\n   6.01.  RFC 3063\
    \ MPLS Loop Prevention Mechanism\n      There are no IPv4 dependencies in this\
    \ specification.\n"
- title: 7.  Summary of Results
  contents:
  - "7.  Summary of Results\n   In the initial survey of RFCs 0 positives were identified\
    \ out of a\n   total of 7, broken down as follows:\n         Standards:      \
    \                   0 out of  0 or  0.00%\n         Draft Standards:         \
    \          0 out of  0 or  0.00%\n         Proposed Standards:               \
    \ 0 out of  6 or  0.00%\n         Experimental RFCs:                 0 out of\
    \  1 or  0.00%\n   Of those identified many require no action because they document\n\
    \   outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols\n   that\
    \ are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups.\n   Additionally\
    \ there are many instances of standards that should be\n   updated but do not\
    \ cause any operational impact if they are not\n   updated.  The remaining instances\
    \ are documented below.\n   7.01.  Standards\n      There are no standards within\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   7.02.  Draft Standards\n      There are no draft\
    \ standards within the scope of this document.\n   7.03.  Proposed Standards\n\
    \      There are no proposed standards with recommendations in this\n      document.\n\
    \   7.04.  Experimental RFCs\n      There are no experimental standards with recommendations\
    \ in this\n      document.\n"
