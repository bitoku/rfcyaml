  - "Abstract\n   New fields are occasionally added to civic addresses.  A backward-\n
    \  compatible mechanism for adding civic address elements to the Geopriv\n   civic
    address format is described.  A formal mechanism for handling\n   unsupported
    extensions when translating between XML and DHCP civic\n   address forms is defined
    for entities that need to perform this\n   translation.  Initial extensions for

    protocol\n   mechanism (defined in RFC 5222) that returns civic address element\n
    \  names used for validation of location information is clarified and is\n   normatively
    updated to require a qualifying namespace identifier on\n   each civic address
    element returned as part of the validation\n   process.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Geopriv civic location specifications ([RFC4776], [RFC5139])\n
    \  define an XML and binary representations for civic addresses that\n   allow
    for the expression of civic addresses.  Guidance for the use of\n   these formats
    for the civic addresses in different countries is\n   included in [RFC5774].\n
    \  Subsequent to these specifications being produced, use cases for\n   extending
    the civic address format with new elements have emerged.\n   [RFC5774] describes
    a mechanism for mapping long-standing address\n   formats into the civic address
    elements defined in [RFC4776] and\n   [RFC5139].  However, some of these existing
    address elements do not\n   readily fit into the civic address elements defined
    in [RFC4776] and\n   [RFC5139].  In these cases, creating new civic address elements\n
    \  provides a better solution than overloading existing civic address\n   fields,
    which may cause confusion.\n   The XML format for civic addresses [RFC5139] provides
    a mechanism\n   that allows for the addition of standardized or privately understood\n
    \  elements.  A similar facility for private extension is not provided\n   for
    the DHCP format [RFC4776], though new specifications are able to\n   define new
    CAtypes (civic address types).\n   A recipient of a civic address in either format
    currently has no\n   option other than to ignore elements that it does not understand.\n
    \  This results in any elements that are unknown to that recipient being\n   discarded
    if a recipient performs a translation between the two\n   formats.  In order for
    a new extension to be preserved through\n   translation by any recipient, the
    recipient has to understand the\n   extension and know how to correlate an XML
    element with a CAtype.\n   This document describes how new civic address elements
    are added.\n   Extensions always start with the definition of XML elements.  A\n
    \  mechanism for carrying the extension in the DHCP format is described.\n   A
    new XML namespace containing a small number of additional civic\n   elements is
    also defined and can be used as a template to illustrate\n   how other extensions
    can be defined as required.\n   These mechanisms ensure that any translation between
    formats can be\n   performed consistently and without loss of information.  Translation\n
    \  between formats can occur without knowledge of every extension that\n   is
    present.\n   The registry of numeric CAtypes is modified so that the creators
    of\n   extensions can advertise new namespaces and civic elements to\n   encourage
    maximum reuse.\n   The additions described in this document are backwardly compatible.\n
    \  Existing implementations may cause extension information to be lost,\n   but
    the presence of extensions does not affect an implementation that\n   conforms
    to either [RFC4776] or [RFC5139].\n   This document also normatively updates [RFC5222]
    to clarify that the\n   namespace must be included with the element name in the
    lists of\n   valid, invalid, and not checked elements in the <locationValidation>\n
    \  part of a Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) response.  While the\n   LoST
    schema does not need to be changed, the example in the document\n   is updated
    to show the namespaces in the lists.\n"

      is where a device\n   receives location configuration using DHCP [RFC4776].

      \  The device that performs the translation between the DHCP and XML\n   formats
      might not be aware of some of the extensions that are in use.\n   Without knowledge
      of these extensions and how they are represented in\n   XML, the device is forced
      to discard them.\n   These extensions could be useful, or may be critical, to
      the ultimate\n   consumers of this information.  For instance, an extension
      element\n   might provide a presence watcher with important information in\n
      \  locating the device, or an extension might be significant in choosing\n   a
      particular call route.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Specifying Civic Address Extensions\n   The civic schema in [RFC5139] defines
    an ordered structure of\n   elements that can be combined to describe a civic
    address.  The XML\n   extension point at the end of this sequence is used to extend
    the\n   address.\n   New elements are defined in a new XML namespace [XMLNS].
    \ This is\n   true of address elements with significance within private or\n   localized
    domains as well as those that are intended for global\n   applicability.\n   New
    elements SHOULD use the basic \"caType\" schema type defined in\n   [RFC5139].
    \ This type provides an optional \"xml:lang\" attribute.\n   For example, suppose
    the (fictitious) Central Devon Canals Authority\n   wishes to introduce a new
    civic element called \"bridge\".  The\n   authority defines an XML namespace that
    includes a \"bridge\" element.\n   The namespace needs to be a unique URI, for
    example\n   \"http://devon.canals.example.com/civic\".\n   A civic address that
    includes the new \"bridge\" element is shown in\n   Figure 2.\n      <civicAddress
    xml:lang=\"en-GB\"\n           xmlns=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr\"\n
    \          xmlns:cdc=\"http://devon.canals.example.com/civic\">\n        <country>UK</country>\n
    \       <A1>Devon</A1>\n        <A3>Monkokehampton</A3>\n        <RD>Deckport</RD>\n
    \       <STS>Cross</STS>\n        <cdc:bridge>21451338</cdc:bridge>\n      </civicAddress>\n
    \                Figure 2: Extended Civic Address Example\n   An entity that receives
    this location information might not\n   understand the extension address element.
    \ As long as the added\n   element is able to be safely ignored, the remainder
    of the civic\n   address can be used.  The result is that the information is not
    as\n   useful as it could be, but the added element does not prevent the use\n
    \  of the remainder of the address.\n   The address can be passed to other applications,
    such as a LoST\n   server [RFC5222], without modification.  If the application\n
    \  understands the added element(s), it is able to make use of that\n   information.
    \ For example, if this civic address is acquired using\n   HTTP-Enabled Location
    Delivery (HELD) [RFC5985], it can be included\n   in a LoST request directly.\n"

    be carried without consequence\n   as long as the format of the address does not
    change.  However,\n   conversion between formats has been shown to be necessary.\n
    \  Format conversion requires knowledge of the format of the address\n   elements.
    \ An entity performing a conversion between XML and DHCP\n   address formats is
    forced to discard unrecognized elements.  The\n   entity performing the conversion
    has no way to know the correct\n   element to use in the target format.\n   This
    document defines a single extension element for the DHCP format\n   that makes
    knowledge of extensions unnecessary during conversion.\n   This extension element
    relies on the extension mechanisms defined for\n   the XML format.  New extensions
    to the civic address format MUST be\n   defined only for the XML format; these
    extensions are then conveyed\n   in DHCP using the extension element.\n   Further
    extensions to the DHCP format are prohibited; these\n   extensions cannot be safely
    conveyed in environments where conversion\n   is possible.\n"

      treated as a\n   source location for the actual schema and doing so will serve
      no\n   useful purpose.\n   Extensions in the XML format can be added to a DHCP

  - "6.  Using Local Civic Extension with the LoST Protocol\n   One critical use of
    civic location information is in next generation\n   emergency services applications,
    in particular, call routing\n   applications.  In such cases, location information
    is provided to a\n   location-based routing service using the LoST protocol [RFC5222].\n
    \  LoST is used to provide call routing information, but it is also used\n   to
    validate location information to ensure that it can route to an\n   emergency
    center when required.\n   LoST is an XML-based protocol, and so the namespace
    extension\n   mechanisms described in this document do not impact LoST.  When
    LoST\n   is used for validation, a <locationValidation> element is returned\n
    \  containing a list of valid, a list of invalid, and a list of\n   unchecked
    civic elements.  Figure 9 is an extract of the validation\n   response in Figure
    6 from [RFC5222].\n   <locationValidation>\n       <valid>country A1 A3 A6</valid>\n
    \      <invalid>PC</invalid>\n       <unchecked>HNO</unchecked>\n   </locationValidation>\n
    \        Figure 9: Location Validation Example from LoST (RFC5222)\n   The RelaxNG
    schema in [RFC5222] requires the elements in each of\n   these lists to be namespace
    qualified, which makes the example in\n   Figure 6 of [RFC5222] erroneous.  This
    issue is especially\n   significant when local-civic extensions are used as the
    domain to\n   which the extensions are attributed may impact their interpretation\n
    \  by the server or client.  To ensure that local-civic extensions do\n   not
    cause issues with the LoST server and client implementations, all\n   elements
    listed in a <valid>, <invalid>, or <unchecked> element MUST\n   be qualified with
    a namespace.  To illustrate this, the extract above\n   from Figure 6 in [RFC5222]
    becomes Figure 10.\n   <locationValidation\n          xmlns:ca=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr\">\n
    \      <valid>ca:country ca:A1 ca:A3 ca:A6</valid>\n       <invalid>ca:PC</invalid>\n
    \      <unchecked>ca:HNO</unchecked>\n   </locationValidation>\n             Figure
    10: Corrected Location Validation Example\n   If a validation request has also
    included the extensions defined in\n   Section 5, then the validation response
    would look like Figure 11.\n <locationValidation\n        xmlns:ca=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr\"\n
