  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access\
    \ (PANA)\n   Working Group is developing methods for authenticating clients to\
    \ the\n   access network using IP based protocols.  This document discusses the\n\
    \   threats to such IP based protocols.\n   A client wishing to get access to\
    \ the network must carry on multiple\n   steps.  First, it needs to discover the\
    \ IP address of the PANA\n   authentication agent (PAA) and then execute an authentication\n\
    \   protocol to authenticate itself to the network.  Once the client is\n   authenticated,\
    \ there might be other messages exchanged during the\n   lifetime of the network\
    \ access.  This document discusses the threats\n   in these steps without discussing\
    \ any solutions.  The requirements\n   arising out of these threats will be used\
    \ as input to the PANA\n   Working Group.  The use of word co-located in this\
    \ document means\n   that the referred entities are present on the same node.\n"

- title: 4.  Usage Scenarios
  contents:
  - "4.  Usage Scenarios\n      PANA is intended to be used in an environment where\
    \ there is no a\n      priori trust relationship or security association between\
    \ the PaC\n      and other nodes, such as the PAA and EP.  In these environments,\n\
    \      one may observe the following:\n      o  The link between PaC and PAA may\
    \ be a shared medium (e.g.,\n         Ethernet) or may not be a shared medium\
    \ (e.g., DSL network).\n      o  All the PaCs may be authenticated to the access\
    \ network at\n         layer 2 (e.g., 3GPP2 CDMA network) and share a security\n\
    \         association with a layer 2 authentication agent (e.g., BTS).\n     \
    \    The PaCs still don't trust each other;  any PaC can pretend to\n        \
    \ be a PAA, spoof IP addresses, and launch various other attacks.\n   The scenarios\
    \ mentioned above affect the threat model of PANA.  This\n   document discusses\
    \ the various threats in the context of the above\n   network access scenarios\
    \ for a better understanding of the threats.\n   In the following discussion,\
    \ any reference to a link that is not\n   shared (or non-shared) is assumed to\
    \ be physically secure.  If such\n   an assumption cannot be made about the link,\
    \ then the case becomes\n   the same as that for a link being shared by more than\
    \ one node.\n"
- title: 5.  Trust Relationships
  contents:
  - "5.  Trust Relationships\n   PANA authentication involves a client (PaC), a PANA\
    \ agent (PAA), an\n   Authentication server (AS), and an Enforcement point (EP).\
    \  The AS\n   here refers to the AAA server that resides in the home realm of\
    \ the\n   PaC.\n   The entities that have a priori trust relationships before\
    \ PANA\n   begins are as follows:\n      1) PAA and AS: The PaC belonging to the\
    \ same administrative domain\n         that the AS does often has to use resources\
    \ provided by a PAA\n         that belongs to another administrative domain. \
    \ A PAA\n         authenticates the PaC before providing local network access.\n\
    \         The credentials provided by the PaC for authentication may or\n    \
    \     may not be understood by the PAA.  If the PAA does not\n         understand\
    \ the credentials, it needs to communicate with the AS\n         in a different\
    \ domain to verify the credentials.  The threats\n         in the communication\
    \ path between the PAA and AS are already\n         covered in [RAD-EAP].  To\
    \ counter these threats, the\n         communication between the PAA and AS is\
    \ secured by using a\n         static or dynamic security association.\n     \
    \ 2) PAA and EP: The PAA and EP belong to the same administrative\n         domain.\
    \  Hence, the network operator can set up a security\n         association to\
    \ protect the traffic exchanged between them.\n         This document discusses\
    \ the threats in this path.\n      3) PaC and AS: The PaC and AS belong to the\
    \ same administrative\n         domain and share a trust relationship.  When the\
    \ PaC uses a\n         different domain than its home for network access, it provides\n\
    \         its credentials to the PAA in the visited network for\n         authentication.\
    \  The information provided by the PaC traverses\n         the PaC-PAA and PAA-AS\
    \ paths.  The threats in the PAA-AS path\n         are already discussed in [RAD-EAP].\
    \  This document discusses\n         the threats in the PaC-PAA path.\n   It is\
    \ possible that some of the entities such as the PAA, AS, and EP\n   are co-located.\
    \  In those cases, it can be safely assumed that there\n   are no significant\
    \ external threats in their communication.\n   The entities that do not have any\
    \ trust relationship before PANA\n   begins are as follows:\n      1) PaC and\
    \ PAA: The PaC and PAA normally belong to two different\n         administrative\
    \ domains.  They do not necessarily share a trust\n         relationship initially.\
    \  They establish a security association\n         in the process of authentication.\
    \  All messages exchanged\n         between the PaC and PAA are subject to various\
    \ threats, which\n         are discussed in this document.\n      2) PaC and EP:\
    \ The EP belongs to the same administrative domain as\n         the PAA.  Hence,\
    \ the PaC and EP do not necessarily share a\n         trust relationship initially.\
    \  When the PaC is successfully\n         authenticated, it may result in key\
    \ establishment between the\n         PaC and PAA, which can be further used to\
    \ secure the link\n         between the PaC and EP.  For example, the EAP keying\
    \ framework,\n         [EAP-KEY], defines a three party EAP exchange in which\
    \ the\n         clients derive the transient sessions keys to secure the link\n\
    \         between the peer and NAS in their final step.  Similarly, PANA\n   \
    \      will provide the ability to establish keys between the PaC and\n      \
    \   EP that can be used to secure the link further.  This is\n         discussed\
    \ further in Section 6.4 below.\n"
- title: 6.  Threat Scenarios
  contents:
  - "6.  Threat Scenarios\n   First, the PaC needs to discover the PAA.  This involves\
    \ either\n   sending solicitations or waiting for advertisements.  Once it has\n\
    \   discovered the PAA, the two will enter authentication exchange.  Once\n  \
    \ the access is granted, the PaC will most likely exchange data with\n   other\
    \ nodes in the Internet.  These steps are vulnerable to man-in-\n   the-middle\
    \ (MITM), denial of service (DoS), and service theft\n   attacks, which are discussed\
    \ below.\n   The threats are grouped by the various stages the client goes through\n\
    \   to gain access to the network.  Section 6.1 discusses the threats\n   related\
    \ to PAA discovery.  Section 6.2 discusses the threats related\n   to authentication\
    \ itself.  Section 6.3 discusses the threats involved\n   when leaving the network.\
    \  Section 6.4 discusses service theft.\n   Section 6.5 discusses the threats\
    \ in the PAA-EP path.  Section 6.6\n   discusses the miscellaneous threats.\n\
    \   Some of the threats discussed in the following sections may be\n   specific\
    \ to shared links.  The threat may be absent on non-shared\n   links.  Hence,\
    \ it is only required to prevent the threat on shared\n   links.  Instead of specifying\
    \ a separate set of requirements for\n   shared links and non-shared links, this\
    \ document specifies one set of\n   requirements with the following wording: \"\
    PANA MUST be able to\n   prevent threat X\".  This means that the PANA protocol\
    \ should be\n   capable of preventing threat X.  The feature that prevents threat\
    \ X\n   may or may not be used depending on the deployment.\n"
- title: 6.1.  PAA Discovery
  contents:
  - "6.1.  PAA Discovery\n   The PAA is discovered by sending solicitations or receiving\n\
    \   advertisements.  The following are possible threats.\n   T6.1.1: A malicious\
    \ node can pretend to be a PAA by sending a spoofed\n           advertisement.\n\
    \   In existing dial-up networks, the clients authenticate to the network\n  \
    \ but generally do not verify the authenticity of the messages coming\n   from\
    \ Network Access Server (NAS).  This mostly works because the link\n   between\
    \ the device and the NAS is not shared with other nodes\n   (assuming that nobody\
    \ tampers with the physical link), and clients\n   trust the NAS and the phone\
    \ network to provide the service.  Spoofing\n   attacks are not present in this\
    \ environment, as the PaC may assume\n   that the other end of the link is the\
    \ PAA.\n   In environments where the link is shared, this threat is present, as\n\
    \   any node can pretend to be a PAA.  Even if the nodes are\n   authenticated\
    \ at layer 2, the threat remains present.  It is\n   difficult to protect the\
    \ discovery process, as there is no a priori\n   trust relationship between the\
    \ PAA and PaC.  In deployments where EP\n   can police the packets that are sent\
    \ among the PaCs, it is possible\n   to filter out the unauthorized PANA packets\
    \ (e.g., PAA advertisements\n   sent by PaC) to prevent this threat.\n   The advertisement\
    \ may be used to include information (such as\n   supported authentication methods)\
    \ other than the discovery of the PAA\n   itself.  This can lead to a bidding\
    \ down attack, as a malicious node\n   can send a spoofed advertisement with capabilities\
    \ that indicate\n   authentication methods less secure than those that the real\
    \ PAA\n   supports, thereby fooling the PaC into negotiating an authentication\n\
    \   method less secure than would otherwise be available.\n   Requirement 1\n\
    \   PANA MUST not assume that the discovery process is protected.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Authentication
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Authentication\n   This section discusses the threats specific to the authentication\n\
    \   protocol.  Section 6.2.1 discusses the possible threat associated\n   with\
    \ success/failure indications that are transmitted to PaC at the\n   end of the\
    \ authentication.  Section 6.2.2 discusses the man-in-the-\n   middle attack when\
    \ compound methods are used.  Section 6.2.3\n   discusses the replay attack, and\
    \ Section 6.2.4 discusses the device\n   identifier attack.\n"
- title: 6.2.1.  Success or Failure Indications
  contents:
  - "6.2.1.  Success or Failure Indications\n   Some authentication protocols (e.g.,\
    \ EAP) have a special message to\n   indicate success or failure.  An attacker\
    \ can send a false\n   authentication success or failure message to the PaC. \
    \ By sending a\n   false failure message, the attacker can prevent the client\
    \ from\n   accessing the network.  By sending a false success message, the\n \
    \  attacker can prematurely end the authentication exchange, effectively\n   denying\
    \ service for the PaC.\n   If the link is not shared, then this threat is absent,\
    \ as ingress\n   filtering can prevent the attacker from impersonating the PAA.\n\
    \   If the link is shared, it is easy to spoof these packets.  If layer 2\n  \
    \ provides per-packet encryption with pair-wise keys, it might make it\n   hard\
    \ for the attacker to guess the success or failure packet that the\n   client\
    \ would accept.  Even if the node is already authenticated at\n   layer 2, it\
    \ can still pretend to be a PAA and spoof the success or\n   failure.\n   This\
    \ attack is possible if the success or failure indication is not\n   protected\
    \ by using a security association between the PaC and the\n   PAA.  In order to\
    \ avoid this attack, the PaC and PAA should mutually\n   authenticate each other.\
    \  In this process, they should be able to\n   establish keys to protect the success\
    \ or failure indications.  It may\n   not always be possible to protect the indication,\
    \ as the keys may not\n   be established prior to transmitting the success or\
    \ failure packet.\n   If the client is re-authenticating to the network, it can\
    \ use the\n   previously established security association to protect the success\
    \ or\n   failure indications.  Similarly, all PANA messages exchanged during\n\
    \   the authentication prior to key establishment may not be protected.\n   Requirement\
    \ 2\n   PANA MUST be able to mutually authenticate the PaC and PAA.  PANA\n  \
    \ MUST be able to establish keys between the PaC and PAA to protect the\n   PANA\
    \ messages.\n"
- title: 6.2.2.  MITM Attack
  contents:
  - "6.2.2.  MITM Attack\n   A malicious node can claim to be the PAA to the real\
    \ PaC and claim to\n   be the PaC to the real PAA.  This is a man-in-the-middle\
    \ (MITM)\n   attack, whereby the PaC is fooled to think that it is communicating\n\
    \   with the real PAA and the PAA is fooled to think that it is\n   communicating\
    \ with the real PaC.\n   If the link is not shared, this threat is absent, as\
    \ ingress\n   filtering can prevent the attacker from acting as a man-in-the-\n\
    \   middle.\n   If the link is shared, this threat is present.  Even if the layer\
    \ 2\n   provides per-packet protection, the attacker can act as a man-in-\n  \
    \ the-middle and launch this attack.  An instance of MITM attack, in\n   which\
    \ compound authentication methods are used is described in\n   [TUN-EAP].  In\
    \ these attacks, the server first authenticates to the\n   client.  As the client\
    \ has not proven its identity yet, the server\n   acts as the man-in-the-middle,\
    \ tunneling the identity of the\n   legitimate client to gain access to the network.\
    \  The attack is\n   possible because there is no verification that the same entities\n\
    \   participated among the compound methods.  It is not possible to do\n   such\
    \ verification if compound methods are used without being able to\n   create a\
    \ cryptographic binding among them.  This implies that PANA\n   will be vulnerable\
    \ to such attacks if compound methods are used\n   without being able to cryptographically\
    \ bind them.  Note that the\n   attack does not exist if the keys derived during\
    \ the tunnel\n   establishment are not used to authenticate the client (e.g.,\
    \ tunnel\n   keys are used for just protecting the identity of the client).\n\
    \   Requirement 3\n   When compound authentication methods are used in PANA, the\
    \ methods\n   MUST be cryptographically bound.\n"
- title: 6.2.3.  Replay Attack
  contents:
  - "6.2.3.  Replay Attack\n   A malicious node can replay the messages that caused\
    \ authentication\n   failure or success at a later time to create false failures\
    \ or\n   success.  The attacker can also potentially replay other messages of\n\
    \   the PANA protocol to deny service to the PaC.\n   If the link is not shared,\
    \ this threat is absent, as ingress\n   filtering can prevent the attacker from\
    \ impersonating the PAA to\n   replay the packets.\n   If the link is shared,\
    \ this threat is present.  If the packets are\n   encrypted at layer 2 by using\
    \ pair-wise keys, it will make it hard\n   for the attacker to learn the unencrypted\
    \ (i.e., original) packet\n   that needs to be replayed.  Even if layer 2 provides\
    \ replay\n   protection, the attacker can still replay the PANA messages (layer\
    \ 3)\n   for denying service to the client.\n   Requirement 4\n   PANA MUST be\
    \ able to protect itself against replay attacks.\n"
- title: 6.2.4.  Device Identifier Attack
  contents:
  - "6.2.4.  Device Identifier Attack\n   When the client is successfully authenticated,\
    \ the PAA sends access\n   control information to the EP for granting access to\
    \ the network.\n   The access control information typically contains the device\n\
    \   identifier of the PaC, which is either obtained from the IP headers\n   and\
    \ MAC headers of the packets exchanged during the authentication\n   process or\
    \ carried explicitly in the PANA protocol field.  The\n   attacker can gain unauthorized\
    \ access into the network by taking the\n   following steps.\n      o  An attacker\
    \ pretends to be a PAA and sends advertisements.  The\n         PaC is fooled\
    \ and starts exchanging packets with the attacker.\n      o  The attacker modifies\
    \ the IP source address on the packet,\n         adjusts the UDP/TCP checksum,\
    \ and forwards the packet to the\n         real PAA.  It also does the same on\
    \ return packets.\n      o  When the real PaC is successfully authenticated, the\
    \ attacker\n         gains access to the network, as the packets contained the\
    \ IP\n         address (and potentially the MAC address also) of the attacker.\n\
    \   If the link is not shared, this threat is absent, as the attacker\n   cannot\
    \ impersonate the PAA and intercept the packets from the PaC.\n   If the link\
    \ is shared, this threat is present.  If the layer 2\n   provides per-packet protection,\
    \ it is not possible to change the MAC\n   address, and hence this threat may\
    \ be absent in such cases if EP\n   filters on both the IP and MAC address.\n\
    \   Requirement 5\n   PANA MUST be able to protect the device identifier against\
    \ spoofing\n   when it is exchanged between the PaC and PAA.\n"
- title: 6.3.  PaC Leaving the Network
  contents:
  - "6.3.  PaC Leaving the Network\n   When the PaC leaves the network, it can inform\
    \ the PAA before\n   disconnecting from the network so that the resources used\
    \ by PaC can\n   be accounted properly.  The PAA may also choose to revoke the\
    \ access\n   anytime it deems necessary.  The following are possible threats:\n\
    \   T6.3.1: A malicious node can pretend to be a PAA and revoke the\n        \
    \   access to PaC.\n   T6.3.2: A malicious node can pretend to be a real PaC and\

- title: 6.4.  Service Theft
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Service Theft\n   An attacker can gain unauthorized access into the network\
    \ by stealing\n   the service from another client.  Once the real PaC is successfully\n\
    \   authenticated, the EP will have filters in place to prevent\n   unauthorized\
    \ access into the network.  The filters will be based on\n   something that will\
    \ be carried on every packet.  For example, the\n   filter could be based on the\
    \ IP and MAC addresses, where the packets\n   will be dropped unless the packets\
    \ coming with certain IP addresses\n   also match the MAC addresses.  The following\
    \ are possible threats:\n   T6.4.1: An attacker can spoof both the IP and MAC\
    \ addresses of an\n           authorized client to gain unauthorized access. \
    \ The attacker\n           can launch this attack easily by just sniffing the\
    \ wire for\n           IP and MAC addresses.  This lets the attacker use the network\n\
    \           without any authorization, getting a free service.\n   T6.4.2: The\
    \ PaC can leave the network without notifying the PAA or EP\n           (e.g.,\
    \ the Ethernet cable is unplugged, system crash).  An\n           attacker can\
    \ pretend to be the PaC and start using the\n           network.\n   Service theft\
    \ allows the possibility of exploiting the weakness in\n   other authentication\
    \ protocols that use IP address for\n   authentication.  It also allows the interception\
    \ of traffic destined\n   for other nodes by spoofing the IP address.\n   If the\
    \ link is not shared, T6.4.1 is absent, as there is only one\n   client on the\
    \ link, and ingress filtering can prevent the use of the\n   authorized IP and\
    \ MAC addresses by the attacker on another link.\n   Threat T6.4.2 exists, as\
    \ the attacker can use the IP or MAC address\n   of the real PaC to gain access\
    \ to the network.\n   If the link is shared, both the threats are present.  If\
    \ layer 2\n   provides per-packet protection using pair-wise keys, both the threats\n\
    \   can be prevented.\n   Requirement 7\n   PANA MUST securely bind the authenticated\
    \ session to the device\n   identifier of the client, to prevent service theft.\
    \  PANA MUST be\n   able to bootstrap a shared secret between the PaC and PAA\
    \ that can be\n   further used to set up a security association between the PaC\
    \ and EP\n   to provide cryptographic protection against service theft.\n"
- title: 6.5.  PAA-EP Communication
  contents:
  - "6.5.  PAA-EP Communication\n   After a successful authentication, the PAA needs\
    \ to communicate the\n   access control information of the PaC to the EP so that\
    \ the PaC will\n   be allowed to access the network.  The information communicated\
    \ would\n   contain at least the device identifier of the PaC.  If strong\n  \
    \ security is needed, the PAA will communicate a shared secret known\n   only\
    \ to the PaC and PAA, for setting up a security association\n   between the PaC\
    \ and EP.  The following are possible threats:\n   T6.5.1: An attacker can eavesdrop\
    \ to learn the information\n           communicated between the PAA and EP.  The\
    \ attacker can\n           further use this information to spoof the real PaC\
    \ and also\n           to set up security association for gaining access to the\n\
    \           network.  This threat is absent if the attacker cannot\n         \
    \  eavesdrop on the link; e.g., the PAA and EP communicate on a\n           link\
    \ separate from that of visiting PaCs.\n   T6.5.2: An attacker can pretend to\
    \ be a PAA and send false\n           information to an EP to gain access to the\
    \ network.  In the\n           case of stronger security, the attacker has to\
    \ send its own\n           device identifier and also a shared secret, so that\
    \ the EP\n           will let the attacker access the network.\n   If the communication\
    \ between the PAA and EP is protected, these\n   threats are absent.\n   Requirement\
    \ 8\n   The communication between the PAA and EP MUST be protected against\n \
    \  eavesdropping and spoofing attacks.\n"
- title: 6.6.  Miscellaneous Attacks
  contents:
  - "6.6.  Miscellaneous Attacks\n   T6.6.1: There are various forms of DoS attacks\
    \ that can be launched\n           on the PAA or AS.  A few are mentioned below.\
    \  As it is hard\n           to defend against some of the DoS attacks, the protocol\n\
    \           should be designed carefully to mitigate or prevent such\n       \
    \    attacks.\n           o  An attacker can bombard the PAA with lots of\n  \
    \            authentication requests.  If the PAA and AS are not co-\n       \
    \       located, the PAA may have to allocate resources to store\n           \
    \   some state about the PaC locally before it receives the\n              response\
    \ from the back-end AS.  This can deplete memory\n              resources on the\
    \ PAA.\n           o  With minimal effort, an attacker can force the PAA or AS\n\
    \              to make computationally intensive operations with minimal\n   \
    \           effort, that can deplete the CPU resources of the PAA or\n       \
    \       AS.\n   T6.6.2: PaC acquires an IP address by using stateful or stateless\n\
    \           mechanisms before PANA authentication begins [PANAREQ].  When\n  \
    \         the IP addresses are assigned before the client\n           authentication,\
    \ it opens up the possibility of DoS attacks in\n           which unauthenticated\
    \ malicious nodes can deplete the IP\n           address space by acquiring multiple\
    \ IP addresses or deny\n           allocation to others by responding to every\
    \ duplicate address\n           detection (DAD) query.\n           Depleting a\
    \ /64 IPv6 link-local address space or a /8 RFC1918\n           private address\
    \ space requires a brute-force attack.  Such an\n           attack is part of\
    \ a DoS class that can equally target the\n           link capacity or the CPU\
    \ cycles on the target system by\n           bombarding arbitrary packets.  Therefore,\
    \ solely handling the\n           IP address depletion attack is not going to\
    \ improve the\n           security, as a more general solution is needed to tackle\
    \ the\n           whole class of brute-force attacks.\n           The DAD attack\
    \ can be prevented by deploying secure address\n           resolution that does\
    \ not depend on the client authentication,\n           such as [SEND].  The attack\
    \ may also be prevented if the EP\n           is placed between the PaCs to monitor\
    \ the ND/ARP activity and\n           to detect DAD attacks (excessive NA/ARP\
    \ replies).  If none of\n           these solutions are applicable to a deployment,\
    \ the PaCs can\n           send arbitrary packets to each other without going\
    \ through\n           the EP, which enables a class of attacks that are based\
    \ on\n           interfering with the PANA messaging (See T6.1.1).  Since\n  \
    \         there will always be a threat in this class (e.g., insecure\n      \
    \     discovery), it is not going to improve the overall security\n          \
    \ by addressing DAD.\n"
