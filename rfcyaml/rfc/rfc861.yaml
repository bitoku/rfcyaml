  - "2.  Command Meanings\n   IAC DO EXOPL\n      The sender of this command REQUESTS
    that the receiver of this\n      command begin negotiating, or confirms that the
    receiver of this\n      command is expected to begin negotiating, TELNET options
    which are\n      on the \"Extended Options List\".\n   IAC WILL EXOPL\n      The
    sender of this command requests permission to begin\n      negotiating, or confirms
    that it will begin negotiating, TELNET\n      options which are on the \"Extended
    Options List\".\n   IAC WON'T EXOPL\n      The sender of this command REFUSES
    to negotiate, or to continue\n      negotiating, options on the \"Extended Options
    List\".\n   IAC DON'T EXOPL\n      The sender of this command DEMANDS that the
    receiver conduct no\n      further negotiation of options on the \"Extended Options
    List\".\n   IAC SB EXOPL <subcommand>\n      The subcommand contains information
    required for the negotiation\n      of an option of the \"Extended Options List\".
    \ The format of the\n      subcommand is discussed in section 5 below.\n"

    \"Extended Options List\" is not\n      permitted.\n"

  - "4.  Motivation for the Option\n   Eventually, a 257th TELNET option will be needed.
    \ This option will\n   extend the option list for another 256 options in a manner
    which is\n   easy to implement.  The option is proposed now, rather than later\n
    \  (probably much later), in order to reserve the option number (255).\n"

  - "5.  An Abstract Description of the Option\n   The EXOPL option has five subcommand
    codes:  WILL, WON'T, DO, DON'T,\n   and SB.  They have exactly the same meanings
    as the TELNET commands\n   with the same names, and are used in exactly the same
    way.  For\n   consistency, these subcommand codes will have the same values as
    the\n   TELNET command codes (250-254).  Thus, the format for negotiating a\n
    \  specific option on the \"Extended Options List\" (once both parties\n   have
    agreed to use it) is:\n      IAC SB EXOPL DO/DON'T/WILL/WON'T/<option code> IAC
    SE\n   Once both sides have agreed to use the specific option specified by\n   <option
    code>, subnegotiation may be required.  In this case the\n   format to be used
    is:\n      IAC SB EXOPL SB <option code> <parameters> SE IAC SE\n"
