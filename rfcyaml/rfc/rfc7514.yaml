- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The deployment of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)\
    \ [RFC3168]\n   remains stalled.  While most operating systems support ECN, it\
    \ is\n   currently disabled by default because of fears that enabling ECN will\n\
    \   break transport protocols.  This document proposes a new ICMP message\n  \
    \ that a router or host may use to advise a host to reduce the rate at\n   which\
    \ it sends, in cases where the host ignores other signals such as\n   packet loss\
    \ and ECN.  We call this message the \"Really Explicit\n   Congestion Notification\"\
    \ (RECN) message because it delivers a less\n   subtle indication of congestion\
    \ than packet loss and ECN.\n"

    \ starting with the ICMP type\n      field.  When an RECN message is encapsulated\
    \ in an IPv6 packet,\n      the computation includes a \"pseudo-header\" of IPv6\
    \ header fields\n      as specified in Section 8.1 of [RFC2460].  For computing\
    \ the\n      checksum, the checksum field is first set to zero.\n   Explicit Notification\n\
    \      A 4-byte value that conveys an explicit notification in the ASCII\n   \
    \   format defined in [RFC20].  This field MUST NOT be set to zero.\n   Description\n\
    \      An RECN message SHOULD be sent by a router in response to a host\n    \
    \  that is generating traffic at a rate persistently unfair to other\n      competing\
    \ flows and that has not reacted to previous packet losses\n      or ECN marks.\n\
    \      The contents of an RECN message MUST be conveyed to the user\n      responsible\
    \ for the traffic.  Precisely how this is accomplished\n      will depend on the\
    \ capabilities of the host.  If text-to-speech\n      capabilities are available,\
    \ the contents should be converted to\n      sound form and audibly rendered.\
    \  If the system is currently\n      muted, a pop-up message will suffice.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Advice to Implementers
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Advice to Implementers\n   As the Explicit Notification field is only 4\
    \ bytes, it is not\n   required that the word be null terminated.  A client implementation\n\
    \   should be careful not to use more than those 4 bytes.  If a router\n   chooses\
    \ a word less than 4 bytes in size, it should null-terminate\n   that word.\n\
    \   A router should not necessarily send an RECN message every time it\n   discards\
    \ a packet due to congestion.  Rather, a router should send\n   these messages\
    \ whenever it discards a burst of packets from a single\n   sender.  For every\
    \ packet a router discards in a single burst, it\n   should send an RECN message.\
    \  A router may form short sentences\n   composed of different 4-byte words, and\
    \ a host should play these\n   sentences back to the user.  A router may escalate\
    \ the content in the\n   Explicit Notification field if it determines that a sender\
    \ has not\n   adjusted its transmission rate in response to previous RECN messages.\n\
    \   There is no upper bound on the intensity of the escalation, either in\n  \
    \ content or sentence length.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Relationship to ICMP Source Quench
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Relationship to ICMP Source Quench\n   The RECN message was inspired by\
    \ the ICMP Source Quench message,\n   which is now deprecated [RFC6633].  Because\
    \ the RECN message uses a\n   similar approach, an RECN message uses the same\
    \ ICMP type when\n   encapsulated in IPv4 as was used by the ICMP Source Quench\
    \ message.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This is an Experimental RFC; the experiment will\
    \ conclude two years\n   after the publication of this RFC.  During the experiment,\n\
    \   implementers are free to use words of their own choosing (up to four\n   letters)\
    \ in RECN messages.  If RECN becomes a Standard of any kind, a\n   list of allowed\
    \ words will be maintained in an IANA registry.  There\n   are no IANA actions\
    \ required at this time.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   ICMP messages may be used in various attacks\
    \ [RFC5927].  An attacker\n   may use the RECN message to cause a host to reduce\
    \ their transmission\n   rate for no reason.  To prevent such an attack, a host\
    \ must ensure\n   the quoted message corresponds to an active flow on the system,\
    \ and\n   an attacker MUST set the security flag defined in [RFC3514] to 1 when\n\
    \   the RECN message is carried in an IPv4 packet.\n"
