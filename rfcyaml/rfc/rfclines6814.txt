Abstract A number of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have never been formally deprecated.
This document deprecates such IPv4 options, thus cleaning up the corresponding IANA registry.
Additionally, it obsoletes RFCs 1385, 1393, 1475, and 1770, and requests that the RFC Editor change their status to Historic.
The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
[RFC791] provides for expansion of the protocol by supporting a number of "options" in the variable length IPv4 header.
IPv4 options are identified by an option "type" value, whose registration is managed by IANA [IANA IP].
A number of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have never been formally deprecated.
This document deprecates such IPv4 options, thus cleaning up the corresponding IANA registry.
This document also obsoletes [RFC1385], [RFC1393], [RFC1475], and [RFC1770], and requests that the RFC Editor change their status to Historic. 2.
The following subsections discuss the options being deprecated.
No other reference information has been found.
The Stream ID option is obsolete.
It is specified in RFC 791 [RFC791], and is deprecated in Section 3.2.1.8 of RFC 1122 [RFC1122] and Section 4.2.2.1 of RFC 1812
The Extended Internet Protocol option is defined in [RFC1385] and is superseded by [RFC2460].
Traceroute The Traceroute option is defined in [RFC1393].
The Traceroute option is defined as Experimental; it was never widely deployed on the public Internet.
This option was used for experimentation around IP layer encryption.
No products are known to ever have shipped with support for this option.
This option was part of an experiment [VISA87]
[VISA89] at USC and was never widely deployed.
The Address Extension option is defined in an Experimental RFC [RFC1475] and marked as IPv7.
IPv7 was never widely deployed.
The Selective Directed Broadcast option was originally defined in [RFC1770].
This option was never widely deployed and the approach was abandoned.
The Dynamic Packet State option was specified in [DIFFSERV DPS].
The aforementioned document was meant to be published as Experimental, but it never became an RFC.
The IP option was never widely deployed.
This option was originally specified in [BIDIR PIM].
Its use was deprecated by [RFC5015], which employs a control plane mechanism to solve the problem of doing upstream forwarding of multicast packets on a multi access
The "IP OPTION NUMBERS" registry [IANA IP] contains the list of currently assigned IP option numbers.
This registry also denotes a deprecated IP Option Number by marking it with a footnote.
This document formally deprecates the following options.
IANA has marked them as such in the corresponding registry [IANA IP].
The IP options "MTU Probe" (MTUP, value 11) and "MTU Reply" (MTUR, value 12) were initially defined in [RFC1063] and have already been deprecated by [RFC1191].
Changing the Status of the Corresponding RFCs to Historic Per this document, the RFC Editor has changed the status of [RFC1385], [RFC1393], [RFC1475], and [RFC1770] to Historic.
Security Considerations This document does not modify the security properties of the IPv4 options being deprecated.
