  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) has been adopted as\
    \ a solution\n   to the scaling problem in the Internet. The overall CIDR architecture\n\
    \   is described in [1]. The architecture for IP address assignment with\n   CIDR\
    \ is covered in [2] and [3]. The inter-domain routing protocols\n   that are capable\
    \ of supporting CIDR are covered in [4], [5], and [6].\n   The purpose of this\
    \ document is twofold. First, it describes various\n   alternatives for exchanging\
    \ inter-domain routing information across\n   domain boundaries, where one of\
    \ the peering domain is CIDR-capable\n   and another is not.  Second, it addresses\
    \ the implications of running\n   CIDR-capable inter-domain routing protocols\
    \ (e.g., BGP-4, IDRP) on\n   intra-domain routing.\n   This document is not intended\
    \ to cover all the cases (either real or\n   imaginable). Rather, it focuses on\
    \ what are viewed to be the most\n   common cases.  We expect that individual\
    \ service providers will use\n   this document as guidelines in establishing their\
    \ specific\n   operational plans for the transition to CIDR.\n   The concepts\
    \ of \"network service provider\" and \"network service\n   subscriber\" were\
    \ introduced in [3]. For the sake of brevity, we will\n   use the term \"provider\"\
    \  or \"service provider\" here to mean either\n   \"network service provider\"\
    \ or \"network service subscriber\", since for\n   the most part, the distinction\
    \ is not important to this discussion.\n   Furthermore, we use the same terms\
    \ to refer to the network and to the\n   organization that operates the network.\
    \ We feel that the context\n   makes it amply clear whether we are talking about\
    \ hardware or people,\n   and defining different terms would only make this paper\
    \ harder to\n   read.\n   This document defines a CIDR-capable provider as the\
    \ provider that\n   can perform correct IP packet forwarding (both internally\
    \ and to\n   other adjacent providers) when the inter-domain routing information\n\
    \   acquired by the provider is expressed solely in terms of IP address\n   prefixes\
    \ (with no distinction between A/B/C class of addresses).\n   This document defines\
    \ CIDR-capable forwarding as the ability of a\n   router to maintain its forwarding\
    \ table and to perform correct\n   forwarding of IP packets without making any\
    \ assumptions about the\n   class of IP addresses.\n   This document defines CIDR\
    \ reachability information as reachability\n   information that may violate any\
    \ assumptions about the class of IP\n   addresses. For instance, a contiguous\
    \ block of class C networks\n   expressed as a single IP address prefix constitutes\
    \ CIDR reachability\n   information.\n"
- title: 2.  Taxonomy of Service Providers
  contents:
  - "2.  Taxonomy of Service Providers\n   For the purpose of this document we partition\
    \ all service providers\n   into the following categories, based on the type and\
    \ volume of\n   inter-domain routing information a provider needs to acquire in\
    \ order\n   to meet its service requirements:\n      - Requirements imposed on\
    \ a service provider preclude it from\n        using Default inter-domain route(s)\
    \ -- we'll refer to such a\n        pqrovider as a Type 1 provider.\n      - Requirements\
    \ imposed on a service provider allow it to rely on\n        using one or more\
    \ Default routes for inter-domain routing, but\n        this information must\
    \ be supplemented by requiring the provider\n        to acquire a large percentage\
    \ of total Internet routing\n        information -- we'll refer to such a provider\
    \ as a Type 2\n        provider.\n      - Requirements imposed on a service provider\
    \ allow it to rely on\n        using one or more Default routes for inter-domain\
    \ routing;\n        however, to meet its service requirements the provider must\n\
    \        supplement Default route(s) by acquiring a small percentage of\n    \
    \    total Internet routing information -- we'll refer to such a\n        provider\
    \ as a Type 3 provider.\n      - Requirements imposed on a service provider allow\
    \ it to rely\n        solely on using one or more Default routes for inter-domain\n\
    \        routing; no other inter-domain routing information need to be\n     \
    \   acquired -- we'll refer to such a provider as a Type 4 provider.\n"
- title: 3.  Assumptions on Deployment of CIDR in the Internet
  contents:
  - "3.  Assumptions on Deployment of CIDR in the Internet\n   The document assumes\
    \ that the CIDR deployment in the Internet will\n   proceed as a three phase process.\n\
    \   In the first phase all the major service providers will become CIDR-\n   capable.\
    \ Specifically, all the providers that can't rely on using\n   Default route(s)\
    \ for inter-domain routing (Type 1 providers) are\n   expected to deploy BGP-4\
    \ and transition to CIDR during this phase. It\n   is expected that CIDR reachability\
    \ information will first appear in\n   the Internet upon transition of all Type\
    \ 1 service providers to CIDR.\n   The second phase will commence upon completion\
    \ of the first phase.\n   During the second phase other service providers that\
    \ are connected to\n   the service providers that were transitioned to CIDR during\
    \ the first\n   phase will become CIDR-capable.  Specifically, during the second\n\
    \   phase it is expected that most of the providers that need to acquire\n   a\
    \ large percentage of the total Internet routing information (Type 2\n   provider)\
    \ will become CIDR-capable.  In addition, during the second\n   phase some of\
    \ the Type 3 providers may become CIDR-capable as well.\n   This plan was agreed\
    \ to by a number of major providers [8]. NSFNET's\n   steps to implement this\
    \ plan are described in [9].\n   Finally, during the third phase the rest of the\
    \ Type 3 providers and\n   most of the Type 4 providers will transition to CIDR.\n\
    \   It is expected that the duration of the first phase will be\n   significantly\
    \ shorter than duration of the second phase.  Likewise,\n   the duration of the\
    \ second phase is expected to be shorter than the\n   duration of the third phase.\n\
    \   This document addresses the need for service providers to exchange\n   inter-domain\
    \ routing information during the second and third phases\n   of this deployment.\
    \ During these phases, some providers will be\n   CIDR-capable, and others will\
    \ not. Hence this document considers\n   routing exchanges where one of the peers\
    \ is CIDR-capable and the\n   other is CIDR-incapable.\n"
- title: 4.  Implications of CIDR on Interior Routing
  contents:
  - "4.  Implications of CIDR on Interior Routing\n   A CIDR-capable service provider\
    \ can use the following two techniques\n   to distribute exterior routing information\
    \ to all of its routers\n   (both interior and border):\n      - utilize internal\
    \ BGP/IDRP between all the routers\n      - use CIDR-capable IGPs (e.g., OSPF,\
    \ IS-IS, RIP2)\n   The first technique doesn't impose any addition requirements\
    \ on the\n   IGP within the provider. Additional information on implementing the\n\
    \   first option is presented in [5] (see Section A.2.4).\n   The second technique\
    \ allows the provider to reduce the utilization of\n   internal BGP/IDRP, but\
    \ imposes specific requirements on the intra-\n   domain routing. It also requires\
    \ the ability to inject inter-domain\n   routing information (acquired either\
    \ via BGP or IDRP) into the\n   intra-domain routing. Additional details on implementing\
    \ the second\n   option are provided in [7]. It is not expected that all the features\n\
    \   enumerated in [7] will be widely needed. Therefore, it would be\n   highly\
    \ desirable to prioritize the features.\n   Note that both of these techniques\
    \ imply that all the routers within\n   a CIDR-capable service provider need to\
    \ be capable of CIDR-based\n   forwarding.\n   Discussion of which of the two\
    \ techniques should be preferred is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 5.  Exchanging Inter-Domain Routing Information
  contents:
  - "5.  Exchanging Inter-Domain Routing Information\n   At each phase during the\
    \ transition to CIDR one of the essential\n   aspects of the Internet operations\
    \ will be the exchange of inter-\n   domain routing information between CIDR-capable\
    \ providers and CIDR-\n   incapable provider.\n   When exchanging inter-domain\
    \ routing information between a CIDR-\n   capable provider and a CIDR-incapable\
    \ provider, it is of utmost\n   importance to take into account the view each\
    \ side wants the other to\n   present. This view has two distinct aspects:\n \
    \     - the type of routing information exchanged (i.e., Default route,\n    \
    \    traditional (non-CIDR) reachability information, CIDR\n        reachability\
    \ information)\n      - routing information processing each side needs to do to\
    \ maintain\n        these views (e.g., ability to perform aggregation, ability\
    \ to\n        perform controlled de-aggregation)\n   The exchange of inter-domain\
    \ routing information is expected to be\n   controlled by bilateral agreements\
    \ between the directly connected\n   service providers. Consequently, the views\
    \ each side wants of the\n   other are expected to form an essential component\
    \ of such agreements.\n   To facilitate troubleshooting and problem isolation,\
    \ the bilateral\n   agreements should be made accessible to other providers. \
    \ One way to\n   accomplish this is by placing them in a generally accessible\n\
    \   database. The details of how this can be implemented are outside the\n   scope\
    \ of this document. A possible way to accomplish this is\n   described in [9].\n\
    \   Since the exchange of inter-domain routing information across\n   provider\
    \ boundaries occurs on a per peer basis, a border router is\n   expected to provide\
    \ necessary mechanisms (e.g., configuration) that\n   will control exchange and\
    \ processing of this information on a per\n   peer basis.\n   In the following\
    \ sections we describe possible scenarios for\n   exchanging inter-domain routing\
    \ information. It is always assumed\n   that one side is CIDR-capable and the\
    \ other is not.\n"
- title: 5.1  Exchanging Inter-Domain Routing Information between CIDR-capable
  contents:
  - "5.1  Exchanging Inter-Domain Routing Information between CIDR-capable\n     providers\
    \ and CIDR-incapable Type 2 (default with large proportion\n     of explicit routes)\
    \ providers\n   We expect the border router(s) within a CIDR-capable provider\
    \ to be\n   capable of aggregating inter-domain routing information they receive\n\
    \   from a CIDR-incapable Type 2 provider.  The aggregation is expected\n   to\
    \ be governed and controlled via a bilateral agreement.\n   Specifically, the\
    \ CIDR capable provider is expected to aggregate only\n   the information the\
    \ other side (the CIDR-incapable provider)\n   requests. In other words, the aggregation\
    \ shall be done by the CIDR-\n   capable provider (the receiver) and only when\
    \ agreed to by the CIDR-\n   incapable provider (the sender).\n   Passing inter-domain\
    \ routing information from a CIDR-capable provider\n   to a CIDR-incapable Type\
    \ 2 provider will require an agreement between\n   the two that would cover the\
    \ following items:\n      - under what conditions the CIDR-capable provider can\
    \ pass an\n        inter-domain Default route to the CIDR-incapable provider\n\
    \      - exchange of specific non-CIDR reachability information\n      - controlled\
    \ de-aggregation of CIDR reachability information\n   Agreements that cover the\
    \ first two items are already implemented\n   within the Internet. Thus, the only\
    \ additional factor introduced by\n   CIDR is controlled de-aggregation. A CIDR-capable\
    \ provider may decide\n   not to de-aggregate any CIDR reachability information,\
    \ or to de-\n   aggregate some or all of the CIDR reachability information.\n\
    \   If a CIDR-capable provider does not de-aggregate CIDR reachability\n   information,\
    \ then its non-CIDR Type 2 peer can obtain reachability\n   information from it\
    \ either as non-CIDR reachability information\n   (explicit Class A/B/C network\
    \ advertisement) or as an inter-domain\n   Default route.  Since most of the current\
    \ reachability information in\n   the Internet is non-CIDR, a Type 2 provider\
    \ would be able to acquire\n   this information as explicit Class A/B/C network\
    \ advertisements from\n   the CIDR-capable provider, as it does now.  Further,\
    \ it is expected\n   that at least on a temporary basis (until the completion\
    \ of the\n   second phase of the transition) in a majority of cases, Type 2\n\
    \   providers should be able to use an inter-domain Default route\n   (acquired\
    \ from the CIDR-capable provider) as a way of dealing with\n   forwarding to destinations\
    \ covered by CIDR reachability information.\n   Thus, it is expected that most\
    \ of the cases involving a CIDR-capable\n   Type 2 provider and a CIDR-capable\
    \ provider that does not perform\n   de-aggregation could be addressed by a combination\
    \ of exchanging\n   specific non-CIDR reachability information and an inter-domain\n\
    \   Default route. Any inconvenience to a CIDR-incapable provider due to\n   the\
    \ use of an inter-domain Default route will be removed once the\n   provider transitions\
    \ to CIDR.\n   On the other hand, a CIDR-capable provider may decide to perform\n\
    \   controlled de-aggregation of CIDR reachability information.\n   Additional\
    \ information on performing controlled de-aggregation can be\n   found in [5]\
    \ (Section 8).  Special care must be taken when de-\n   aggregating CIDR reachability\
    \ information carried by a route with the\n   ATOMIC_AGGREGATE path attribute.\
    \  It is worth while pointing out that\n   due to the nature of Type 2 provider\
    \ (it needs to acquire a large\n   percentage of total inter-domain routing information)\
    \ it is expected\n   that the controlled de-aggregation would result in substantial\n\
    \   configuration at the border router that performs the de-aggregation.\n"
