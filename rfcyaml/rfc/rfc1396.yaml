    \   starting from the events leading to the formation of the WG to the\n   end\
    \ of 1992.  Necessarily, this synopsis represents my own\n   perception, particularly\
    \ for the \"prehistory\" period.  Quite a few\n   people hold strong views about\
    \ both the overall sequence and specific\n   events.  My intent here is to convey\
    \ as neutral a point of view as\n   possible.\n"
- title: Background and Formation of POISED Working Group
  contents:
  - "Background and Formation of POISED Working Group\n   The POISED WG resulted from\
    \ two sequences of activity, both\n   intimately related to the growth of the\
    \ Internet.  During 1991, there\n   was great concern that the IP address space\
    \ was being depleted and\n   that the routing tables were growing too large. \
    \ Some change in the\n   IP addressing and routing mechanisms seemed inevitable,\
    \ and it became\n   urgent to explore and choose what those changes should be.\
    \  The ROAD\n   Working Group was formed to study the issues and recommend changes.\n\
    \   The ROAD group returned with a specific recommendation for the short\n   term,\
    \ but did not reach a conclusion on a long term plan.\n   The Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG) then formulated a plan\n   of action for further exploration\
    \ of the issues and forwarded these\n   recommendations to the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board (IAB).  In June\n   1992, after the INET '92 meeting in Kobe, Japan, the\
    \ IAB met and\n   considered the IESG's recommendations.  After considering the\
    \ IESG's\n   recommendations, the IAB felt that additional ideas were also\n \
    \  important, particularly some of the addressing ideas in the CLNP\n   protocol.\
    \  The IAB communicated its concerns, and there was immediate\n   controversy\
    \ along two dimensions.  One dimension was technical: What\n   is the best course\
    \ for evolving the IP protocol?  How important or\n   useful are the ideas in\
    \ the OSI protocol stack?  The other dimension\n   was political: Who makes decisions\
    \ within the Internet community?\n   Who chooses who makes these decisions?\n\
    \   As often happens during periods of conflict, communication suffered\n   among\
    \ the several parties.  The June communication from the IAB was\n   understood\
    \ by many an IAB decision or, equivalently, a sense of the\n   decisions the IAB\
    \ would make in the future.  In contrast, many if not\n   all on the IAB felt\
    \ that they were trying to open up the discussion\n   and their memos were intended\
    \ as advice and not decisions.  From my\n   perspective, this form of miscommunication\
    \ was partly due to the\n   extended size of the Internet technical community.\
    \  When the\n   community was much smaller, the IAB was in close contact with\
    \ the day\n   to day workings of the technical groups.  With the creation of the\n\
    \   IESG and area directorates, there are now two or three layers between\n  \
    \ a working group and the IAB.\n   These matters came to a head during the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task\n   Force (IETF) meeting in July in Cambridge, MA.  It was\
    \ made clear\n   that the consideration of changes to the IP protocol remained\
    \ open.\n   Work on that topic has proceeded and is reported in the appropriate\n\
    \   forums.  However, it became clear that it was necessary to examine\n   the\
    \ decision process and the procedures for populating the IESG and\n   IAB.  With\
    \ respect to the procedures for selecting IAB and IESG\n   members, the procedures\
    \ that were in place derived from the creation\n   of the Internet Society (ISOC)\
    \ and the ISOC's sponsorship of the IAB.\n   These procedures had been developed\
    \ during the early part of 1992 and\n   had been adopted by the ISOC during its\
    \ meeting in Kobe in June.\n   Hence, as fast as the ISOC was building the framework\
    \ for supporting\n   the Internet community, the community was questioning its\
    \ structure\n   and processes.\n   Following the IETF meeting, Vint Cerf, Internet\
    \ Society president,\n   called for the formation of working group to examine\
    \ the processes\n   and particularly the selection process (Attachment 1).  During\n\
    \   August, the working group was formed, I was asked to chair it, and a\n   charter\
    \ for the WG was formulated (Attachment 2).  (The acronym is\n   due to Erik Huizer\
    \ and originally stood for The Process for\n   Organization of Internet Standards\
    \ and Development.  It was shortened\n   to fit into the space available on paper\
    \ and in the IETF\n   Secretariat's database.)\n"

  - "Deliberations: August through mid-November\n   The formation of the POISED WG\
    \ provided a forum for discussion of\n   process issues.  An estimated 20 MB of\
    \ messages filled up disks all\n   over the world.  Much of this discussion was\
    \ fragmented or focused on\n   narrow issues.  The salient point that emerged\
    \ was the need for a\n   well defined process for selecting leaders with explicit\
    \ community\n   representation in the selection process.  There was also substantial\n\
    \   discussion of the role of the IAB -- to what extent should it make\n   decisions\
    \ and to what extent should it provide technical guidance? --\n   and the relationship\
    \ between the IAB and IESG.\n   After several weeks of discussion, Carl Malamud\
    \ and I attempted to\n   capture the main elements of the discussion by presenting\
    \ a specific\n   proposal for the reorganization of the entire structure.  The\
    \ main\n   elements of the proposal were:\n      o Retention of the WG and area\
    \ structure now in place within the\n        IETF.\n      o Replacement of the\
    \ IAB and IESG by two boards, one devoted to\n        technical management and\
    \ one devoted to oversight of the\n        process.\n      o Well defined terms\
    \ for members of both boards.\n      o Selection by committees with input from\
    \ the community.\n   This proposal was technically radical in the sense that it\
    \ proposed\n   new structures to replace existing structures instead of proposing\n\
    \   changes within the existing system.  The proposal focused all further\n  \
    \ discussion and set the stage for the fall IETF in mid-November in\n   Washington\
    \ D.C.\n"
- title: November IETF meeting

  - "November IETF meeting\n   By virtue of the intensity of interest throughout the\
    \ community, the\n   POISED WG was one of the focal points of the IETF meeting.\
    \  The\n   schedule included a plenary session Tuesday morning to present the\n\
    \   current state of the POISED WG discussions, a formal POISED WG\n   session\
    \ Tuesday afternoon and an open IESG meeting Thursday evening\n   devoted to the\
    \ POISED issues.  The formal schedule was only the tip\n   of the iceberg; numerous\
    \ meetings took place over breakfast, lunch\n   and dinner, in the halls and off\
    \ in the corners.  The more active\n   participants probably had a dozen or more\
    \ separate meetings on this\n   over the three most active days, Tuesday, Wednesday\
    \ and Thursday.\n   Amidst all this frenetic activity, remarkable progress occurred\
    \ at\n   two key points.  At the Tuesday afternoon POISED WG meeting, Lyman\n\
    \   Chapin, IAB chair, Phill Gross, IETF chair and IAB member, and other\n   IAB\
    \ members proposed changes within the existing IAB/IESG structure\n   which converged\
    \ with the process management elements of the Malamud-\n   Crocker proposal. \
    \ The key point was that all processing of standards\n   actions, including the\
    \ final decision to advance a specification\n   along the standards track, would\
    \ be made by the IESG.  This change in\n   the process shortens the decision cycle\
    \ and brings it a step closer\n   to the working group.   Convergence on this\
    \ key point obviated a\n   radical proposal and signaled the building of a consensus\
    \ on how the\n   standards process should evolve.  Over the next two days attention\n\
    \   then turned to the selection process.\n   As indicated above, there was a\
    \ strong feeling in the community that\n   the IAB and IESG members should be\
    \ selected with the consensus of the\n   community.  A natural mechanism for doing\
    \ this is through formal\n   voting.  However, a formal voting process requires\
    \ formal delineation\n   of who's enfranchised.  One of the strengths of the IETF\
    \ is there\n   isn't any formal membership requirement, nor is there a tradition\
    \ of\n   decision through  votes.  Decisions are generally reached by\n   consensus\
    \ with mediation by leaders when necessary.\n   Various formulas were considered,\
    \ and the one that emerged was that\n   IAB and IESG members would be selected\
    \ by a nomination and recruiting\n   committee.  The committee is to consist of\
    \ seven members from the\n   community, with non-voting representatives from the\
    \ IAB and IESG and\n   a non-voting chair provided by the ISOC.  The seven members\
    \ are to be\n   volunteers, with selection by lot if there are more than seven\n\
    \   volunteers.  The only requirement for volunteers is they must have\n   attended\
    \ two IETF meetings.  This requirement is designed to ensure\n   the nomination\
    \ committee has some familiarity with the Internet\n   community and the standards\
    \ process.\n   IAB and IESG members are to serve two years.  Half of each body\
    \ is to\n   have terms starting in odd years, and half is to have terms starting\n\
    \   in even years.  Selections to the IESG have to be ratified by the\n   IAB,\
    \ and selections to the IAB had to be ratified by the ISOC.  In\n   the event\
    \ that the nomination committee is unable to reach a\n   consensus on a single\
    \ candidate for each position, it may forward\n   multiple nominations to the\
    \ ratifying body, and the ratifying body\n   will select the candidate.\n   In\
    \ addition to this selection process, a recall mechanism was\n   outlined using\
    \ a similar scheme.  The ISOC is to supply an ombudsman\n   who will field complaints\
    \ after all oversight processes have been\n   exhausted.  If the ombudsman is\
    \ unable to resolve a complaint after a\n   cooling off period, a recall committee,\
    \ selected at random among\n   volunteering community members, will consider the\
    \ matter.  A two\n   thirds vote by the committee is necessary to remove someone.\n\
    \   This proposal was formulated and circulated during Wednesday and\n   Thursday\
    \ and presented at the IESG open plenary.  In contrast to the\n   extraordinarily\
    \ contentious open IESG meeting in Cambridge, this\n   meeting was characterized\
    \ by a strenuous effort by numerous people,\n   representing diverse points of\
    \ view, to reach consensus on this\n   proposal, and the meeting ended with a\
    \ distinct decision to proceed\n   on this basis.  Given the strong consensus\
    \ that emerged at that\n   meeting, the group decided to implement the selection\
    \ process by the\n   next IETF meeting, with the new IESG and IAB members to begin\
    \ their\n   terms at the termination of the IETF meeting in March.\n   On Friday,\
    \ the IAB and IESG met jointly to determine what to do next.\n   Both groups agreed\
    \ to implement the change in processing standards\n   actions quickly and cooperatively\
    \ and to identify the positions which\n   are open for selection.  Within a couple\
    \ of weeks, the IAB finished\n   processing the standards actions in its queue,\
    \ and IESG began to\n   handle standards actions on its own.\n"

  - "December ISOC meeting\n   The Internet Society Trustees met December 10 and 11\
    \ at CNRI in\n   Reston, VA.  The process and organization of the IAB and IETF\
    \ was one\n   of their major concerns.  A session of the Trustees at 3:00 p.m.\
    \ EST,\n   December 10, was broadcast via the Internet.  It was not clear how\n\
    \   many people listened, but Geoff Huston, Internet Trustee, was spliced\n  \

    \ charter is needed.\n   Given the very compressed schedule for these activities,\
    \ there has\n   not been time to draft and refine a new charter, so the Trustees\
    \ were\n   asked to approve the general direction of the reorganization of the\n\
    \   IAB and IETF and give temporary approval to the selection process in\n   order\
    \ to permit the first round of selections to proceed.\n   The Trustees expressed\
    \ strong approval for the work of the POISED WG\n   and general approval for the\
    \ direction of the effort.  One area of\n   concern for the Trustees is the legal\
    \ liability of the Internet\n   Society regarding decisions the IESG might make\
    \ in the future.  The\n   Trustees made it quite clear that they are not inclined\
    \ to\n   micromanage the IETF process, but they do feel compelled to\n   understand\
    \ the legal issues and help construct a charter which is\n   consistent with their\
    \ responsibilities as Trustees.\n   The session adjourned with agreement to proceed\
    \ on the current course\n   and for the IETF, IAB and ISOC Trustees to work together\

  - "Introduction\n   In June, 1992, The Internet Society Board of Trustees received\
    \ a\n   proposed charter for an Internet Architecture Board to be created\n  \
    \ within the Internet Society. The new Internet Architecture Board was\n   envisioned\
    \ to be made up of the then current members of the Internet\n   Activities Board.\
    \ The functions of the IETF and the IRTF would be\n   brought under the umbrella\
    \ of the Internet Society as elements of the\n   newly chartered Internet Architecture\
    \ Board. The Trustees voted to\n   accept the proposed charter, which is contained\
    \ in RFC 1358.\n   In the period between June and July, a great deal of discussion\n\
    \   occurred both by email and at the IETF meeting in Boston about the\n   procedures\
    \ by which the IAB, IETF, and IRTF should work together\n   under the general\
    \ umbrella of the Internet Society. Among the many\n   points raised, three seemed\
    \ particularly important to consider:\n      1. Procedures for making appointments\
    \ to the Internet Architecture\n         Board.\n      2. Procedures for resolving\
    \ disagreements among the IETF, IESG,\n         and IAB in matters pertaining\
    \ to the Internet Standards.\n      3. Methods for ensuring that for any particular\
    \ Internet Standard,\n         procedures have been followed satisfactorily by\
    \ all parties\n         so that everyone with an interest has had a fair opportunity\n\
    \         to be heard.\n   Effective discussion of these issues requires the availability\
    \ of an\n   open venue, an opportunity to comment by email, and the possibility\n\
    \   of conducting face-to-face meetings. Recognizing this, the IAB has\n   recommended\
    \ that the most effective means available to the Internet\n   Community for gathering\
    \ recommendations for refining our existing\n   procedures is to request that\
    \ an IETF Working Group be formed.\n   I am pleased to make this request of the\
    \ IETF to create such a WG.\n   It would be extremely helpful to have recommendations\
    \ on the three\n   topics listed above by the first of December, 1992, in time\
    \ to be\n   presented at the Internet Society Board of Trustees meeting scheduled\n\
    \   for December 10th.\n   With respect to point 1 above, the current procedures\
    \ for making IAB\n   appointments are contained in the IAB charter (RFC 1358).\
    \ RFC 1310\n   contains a description of the current process by which Internet\n\
    \   Standards are achieved. Points (2) and (3) could be discussed in the\n   context\
    \ of the present procedures described in RFC 1310, which\n   recognizes a number\
    \ of open issues in an appendix.\n   The Internet Society Trustees hope that members\
    \ of the IAB, IRTF,\n   IESG, and IETF, as well as general members of the Internet\
    \ Society,\n   will take the time to share their thoughts in the proposed working\n\
    \   group forum. It is vital to the future of the Internet that these key\n  \
    \ groups work together well. Certainly, the Internet Society Trustees\n   are\
    \ committed to doing everything possible to facilitate effective\n   procedures\
    \ and to preserve and enhance the special spirit of the\n   Internet Community\
    \ which has created and maintains the health and\n   growth of the global Internet.\n\
