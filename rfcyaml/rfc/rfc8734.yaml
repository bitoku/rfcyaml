  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5639] specifies a new set of elliptic curve groups over\
    \ finite\n   prime fields for use in cryptographic applications.  These groups,\n\
    \   denoted as ECC Brainpool curves, were generated in a verifiably\n   pseudorandom\
    \ way and comply with the security requirements of\n   relevant standards from\
    \ ISO [ISO1][ISO2], ANSI [ANSI1], NIST [FIPS],\n   and SECG [SEC2].\n   [RFC8422]\
    \ defines the usage of elliptic curves for authentication and\n   key agreement\
    \ in TLS 1.2 and earlier versions, and [RFC7027] defines\n   the usage of the\
    \ ECC Brainpool curves for authentication and key\n   exchange in TLS.  The latter\
    \ is applicable to TLS 1.2 and earlier\n   versions but not to TLS 1.3, which\
    \ deprecates the ECC Brainpool curve\n   IDs defined in [RFC7027] due to the lack\
    \ of widespread deployment.\n   However, there is some interest in using these\
    \ curves in TLS 1.3.\n   The negotiation of ECC Brainpool curves for key exchange\
    \ in TLS 1.3,\n   according to [RFC8446], requires the definition and assignment\
    \ of\n   additional NamedGroup IDs.  This document provides the necessary\n  \
    \ definition and assignment of additional SignatureScheme IDs for using\n   three\
    \ ECC Brainpool curves from [RFC5639].\n   This approach is not endorsed by the\
    \ IETF.  Implementers and\n   deployers need to be aware of the strengths and\
    \ weaknesses of all\n   security mechanisms that they use.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC8446] apply\
    \ accordingly.\n   The confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the TLS\n\
    \   communication is limited by the weakest cryptographic primitive\n   applied.\
    \  In order to achieve a maximum security level when using one\n   of the elliptic\
    \ curves from Table 1 for key exchange and/or one of\n   the signature algorithms\
    \ from Table 2 for authentication in TLS,\n   parameters of other deployed cryptographic\
    \ schemes should be chosen\n   at commensurate strengths, for example, according\
    \ to the\n   recommendations of [NIST800-57] and [RFC5639].  In particular, this\n\
    \   applies to (a) the key derivation function, (b) the algorithms and\n   key\
    \ length of symmetric encryption and message authentication, and\n   (c) the algorithm,\
    \ bit length, and hash function for signature\n   generation.  Furthermore, the\
    \ private Diffie-Hellman keys should be\n   generated from a random keystream\
    \ with a length equal to the length\n   of the order of the group E(GF(p)) defined\
    \ in [RFC5639].  The value\n   of the private Diffie-Hellman keys should be less\
    \ than the order of\n   the group E(GF(p)).\n   When using ECDHE key agreement\
    \ with the curves brainpoolP256r1tls13,\n   brainpoolP384r1tls13, or brainpoolP512r1tls13,\
    \ the peers MUST\n   validate each other's public value Q by ensuring that the\
    \ point is a\n   valid point on the elliptic curve.  If this check is not conducted,\n\
    \   an attacker can force the key exchange into a small subgroup, and the\n  \
    \ resulting shared secret can be guessed with significantly less\n   effort.\n\
    \   Implementations of elliptic curve cryptography for TLS may be\n   susceptible\
    \ to side-channel attacks.  Particular care should be taken\n   for implementations\
    \ that internally transform curve points to points\n   on the corresponding \"\
    twisted curve\", using the map (x',y') = (x*Z^2,\n   y*Z^3) with the coefficient\
    \ Z specified for that curve in [RFC5639],\n   in order to take advantage of an\
    \ efficient arithmetic based on the\n   twisted curve's special parameters (A\
    \ = -3).  Although the twisted\n   curve itself offers the same level of security\
    \ as the corresponding\n   random curve (through mathematical equivalence), arithmetic\
    \ based on\n   small curve parameters may be harder to protect against side-channel\n\
    \   attacks.  General guidance on resistance of elliptic curve\n   cryptography\
    \ implementations against side-channel attacks is given in\n   [BSI1] and [HMV].\n"
