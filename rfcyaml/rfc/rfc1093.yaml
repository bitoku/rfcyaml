- title: 1. Routing Overview
  contents:
  - "1. Routing Overview\n   The new NSFNET backbone forms the core of the overall\
    \ NSFNET, which\n   connects to regional networks (or regional backbones) as well\
    \ as to\n   peer networks (other backbones like the NASA Science Network or the\n\
    \   ARPANET).  The NSFNET core uses a SPF based internal routing\n   protocol,\
    \ adapted from the IS-IS protocol submitted by ANSI for\n   standardization to\
    \ the ISO.  The ANSI IS-IS protocol is based upon\n   work done at Digital Equipment\
    \ Corporation.  Its adaptation to the\n   Internet environment requires additional\
    \ definitions, most notably to\n   the addressing structure, which will be described\
    \ in a later\n   document.  This adaptation was largely done by Jacob Rekhter\
    \ of IBM\n   Research in Yorktown, NY. The RCP/PSP routing architecture was\n\
    \   largely implemented by Rick Boivie and his colleagues at IBM TCS in\n   Milford,\
    \ CT.  The adaptation of EGP to the NSS routing code and the\n   new requirements\
    \ was done jointly by Jeff Honig (who spent about a\n   week to work on this at\
    \ IBM Research) and Jacob Rekhter.  Jeff is\n   integrating the changes done for\
    \ the new EGP requirements into the\n   \"gated\" distributions.\n   The IGP derives\
    \ routing tables from Internet address information.\n   This information is flooded\
    \ throughout the NSFNET core, and the\n   individual NSS nodes create or update\
    \ their routing information after\n   running the SPF algorithm over the flooded\
    \ information.  A detailed\n   description of the NSFNET backbone IGP will be\
    \ documented in a future\n   document.\n   The routing interface between the NSFNET\
    \ core and regional backbones\n   as well as peer networks utilizes the Exterior\
    \ Gateway Protocol\n   (EGP).  The EGP/IGP consistency and integrity at the interface\
    \ points\n   is ensured by filtering mechanisms according to individual nodal\n\
    \   routing policy data bases [1].  EGP is selected as the routing\n   interface\
    \ of choice between the NSFNET backbone and its regional\n   attachments due to\
    \ its widespread implementation as well its ability\n   to utilize autonomous\
    \ system designators and to allow for effective\n   firewalls between systems.\
    \  In the longer run the hope is to replace\n   the EGP interface with a new inter\
    \ Autonomous System protocol. Such a\n   new protocol should also allow to move\
    \ the filtering of network\n   numbers or Autonomous Network number groups to\
    \ the regional gateways\n   in order for the regional gateways to decide as to\
    \ what routing\n   information they wish to receive.\n   A general model is to\
    \ ensure consistent routing information between\n   peer networks.  This means\
    \ that, e.g., the NSFNET core will have the\n   same sets of Internet network\
    \ numbers in its routing tables as are\n   present in the ARPANET core.  However,\
    \ the redistribution of this\n   routing information is tightly controlled and\
    \ based on Autonomous\n   System numbers.  For example, ARPANET routes with the\
    \ ARPANET\n   Autonomous System number will not be redistributed into regional\
    \ or\n   other peer networks.  If an NSFNET internal path exists to such a\n \
    \  network known to the ARPANET it may be redistributed into regional\n   networks,\
    \ subject to further policy verification. Generally it may be\n   necessary to\
    \ have different trust models for peer and subordinate\n   networks, while giving\
    \ a greater level of trust to peer networks.\n   The described use of EGP, which\
    \ is further elaborated on in [1]\n   requires bidirectional translation of network\
    \ information between the\n   IGP in use and EGP.\n"
- title: 2. Conclusions reached during the discussions
  contents:
  - "2. Conclusions reached during the discussions\n   The following conclusions were\
    \ reached during the meeting and in\n   subsequent discussions:\n      No DDN-only\
    \ routes (ARPANET/MILNET) shall be announced into the\n      regional backbones.\
    \  This is a specific case of the ability to\n      suppress information from\
    \ specific Autonomous Systems, as\n      described later.\n      Regional backbones\
    \ are required to use an unique Autonomous System\n      number.  Announcements\
    \ from non-sanctioned autonomous systems,\n      relative to a particular site,\
    \ will not be believed and will\n      instead trigger an alarm to the Network\
    \ Operations Center.\n      Regional backbone attachments must not require routes\
    \ to local\n      subnets.  This means that the locally attached network needs\
    \ to\n      use a flat space, without subnet bits, at least from the NSS point\n\
    \      of view.  The reason for this is that the EGP information\n      exchanged\
    \ between the regional gateway and the NSS cannot include\n      subnet information.\
    \ Therefore the NSS has no knowledge of remote\n      subnets.  The safest way\
    \ to get around this limitation is to use a\n      non-subnetted network (like\
    \ a separate Class-C network) at the\n      interface between a regional backbone\
    \ and the NSFNET backbone.\n      The other way is to use Proxy-ARP while having\
    \ just the NSS think\n      that the network is not subnetted. In the latter case\
    \ care must be\n      taken so that the E-PSP uses the proper local IP broadcast\n\
    \      address.\n      Routing information received by the NSS from regional gateways\n\
    \      will be verified on both network number and autonomous system\n      number.\n\
    \      Metric reconstitution is done on a per-network basis.  The NSS\n      will\
    \ construct the fixed metric it will use for a given network\n      number from\
    \ its internal data base.  Network metrics given to the\n      NSS via EGP will\
    \ be ignored.  The metrics used are a result of an\n      ordered list of preferred\
    \ paths as supplied by the regional\n      backbones and the attached campuses.\
    \  This metric is of relevance\n      only to the NSFNET core itself.  The mechanisms\
    \ are further\n      explained in [1].\n      Global metric reconstitution by\
    \ Autonomous System numbers is\n      necessary in specific cases, such as peer\
    \ networks.  An example is\n      that ARPANET routes will be reconstituted to\
    \ a global metric, as\n      determined by the NSS.\n      EGP announcements into\
    \ regional networks will use a fixed metric.\n      The metric used shall be \"\
    128.\"  The 128-metric is somewhat\n      arbitrarily chosen to be high enough\
    \ so that a regional backbone\n      will get a metric high enough from the NSFNET\
    \ Core AS to allow a\n      comparison against other (most likely internal) routes.\
    \ \"128\" is\n      also consistent with [2].\n      Peer network routes (e.g.,\
    \ ARPANET routes) are propagated through\n      the NSS structure.\n      No DEFAULT\
    \ routing information is distributed within the NSFNET\n      backbone, as the\
    \ NSFNET core has the combined routing knowledge of\n      the attached regional\
    \ and peer networks.\n      We do not expect the requirement for damping of routing\
    \ update\n      frequencies, at least initially.  The frequency of net up/down\n\
    \      changes combined with the available bandwidth and CPU capacity do\n   \
    \   not let the frequency of SPF floodings appear as being a major\n      problem.\
    \  Simple metric changes as heard by a NSS via EGP will not\n      trigger updates.\n\
    \      An allowed list of Source Autonomous System information will be\n     \
    \ used to convert from the IGP to EGP, on a Destination Autonomous\n      System\
    \ number basis, to allow for specific exclusion of definable\n      remote Autonomous\
    \ System information.\n      EGP must only announce networks for which the preferred\
    \ path is\n      via the IGP.  This means in particular that the EGP peer will\n\
    \      never announce via EGP what it learned via EGP on the same\n      interface,\
    \ not even if the information was received from a third\n      EGP peer.  This\
    \ will avoid the back-distribution of information\n      learned via that same\
    \ interface.  The EGP peers of regional\n      gateways must only announce information\
    \ belonging to their own\n      Autonomous System.\n      EGP will be used in\
    \ interior mode only.\n      The regional backbones are responsible for generating\
    \ DEFAULT\n      routing information at their option.  One possibility is to\n\
    \      generate an IGP default on a peer base as long as the NSS EGP\n      connection\
    \ is working.  The EGP information will not include a\n      special indication\
    \ for DEFAULT.\n      It is highly desirable to have direct peer-peer connections,\
    \ to\n      ease the implementation of a consistent routing data base.\n     \
    \ A single Autonomous System number may not be used with two E-PSPs\n      at\
    \ the same time as long as the two E-PSP's belong to the same\n      NSS.  Otherwise\
    \ the same Autonomous System number can be used from\n      multiple points of\
    \ attachment to the backbone and therefore can\n      talk to more than one E-PSP.\
    \  However, this may result in\n      suboptimal routing unless multiple announcements\
    \ are properly\n      engineered according to [1].\n      The administrator of\
    \ the regional networks should be warned that\n      improper routing implementations\
    \ within the region may create\n      suboptimal regional routing by using this\
    \ restriction if no care\n      is taken in that:\n         Only networks belonging\
    \ to their own Autonomous System get\n         preferred over NSFNET backbone\
    \ paths; this may extend to a\n         larger virtual Autonomous System if backdoor\
    \ paths are\n         effectively implemented.\n         IGP implementations should\
    \ not echo back routing information\n         heard via the same path.\n     \
    \    If two regional networks decide to implement a backdoor\n         connection\
    \ between themselves, then the backdoor must have a\n         firewall in so that\
    \ information about their own Autonomous\n         System cannot flow in from\
    \ the other Autonomous System.  That\n         is, a regional network must not\
    \ allow information about\n         networks that are interior to its Autonomous\
    \ System to enter\n         via exterior routes.  Likewise, if a regional network\
    \ is\n         connected to the NSFNET via two NSS connections, the NSS cannot\n\
    \         send back information about the Autonomous System into the\n       \
    \  Autonomous System where it originated.  The end effect is that\n         partitions\
    \ within an Autonomous System will not be healed by\n         using the NSS system.\
    \  In addition, if three or more regionals\n         connect to each other via\
    \ multiple back-door paths, it is\n         imperative that all back-door paths\
    \ have firewalls that ensure\n         that the above restrictions are imposed.\
    \  These actions are\n         necessary to prevent routing loops that involve\
    \ the NSS system.\n         Furthermore routing information should only be accepted\
    \ from\n         another regional backbone via backdoor paths for networks which\n\
    \         are positively desired to be reached via this same backdoor\n      \
    \   path.\n"
- title: 3. EGP requirements for attached gateways
  contents:
  - "3. EGP requirements for attached gateways\n   The following EGP requirements\
    \ are necessary for attached gateways;\n   they may require changes in existing\
    \ vendor products:\n      IGP to EGP routing exchanges need to be bidirectional.\
    \  This\n      feature should be selectable by the gateway administrator, and\
    \ by\n      default be configured OFF.\n      The metric used when translating\
    \ from EGP to IGP should be\n      configurable.\n      It must be possible for\
    \ IGP information to override EGP\n      information, so that the internal paths\
    \ are preferred over\n      external paths.  Overriding EGP information on an\
    \ absolute basis,\n      where an external path would never be used as long as\
    \ there is an\n      internal one, is acceptable.\n      The ability to do route\
    \ filtering in the regional gateways on a\n      per net basis is highly desirable\
    \ to allow the regional gateways\n      to do a further selection as to what routes\
    \ they would want to\n      redistribute into their network.\n      The existence\
    \ of an EGP connection should optionally lead to the\n      generation of a DEFAULT\
    \ announcement for propagation via the IGP.\n      The DEFAULT metric should be\
    \ independently configurable.\n      EGP routes with a metric of \"128\" should\
    \ be acceptable.  In most\n      cases the regional backbone should ignore the\
    \ EGP metric.\n      The regional gateways must only announce networks known to\
    \ their\n      own Autonomous System.  At the very least they must not\n     \
    \ redistribute routing information via EGP for routes previously\n      learned\
    \ via EGP.\n      It would be beneficial if the regional IGPs would tag routes\
    \ as\n      being EGP derived.\n      If the EGP peer (e.g., a NSS) terminates\
    \ the EGP exchange the\n      previously learned routes should expire in a timely\
    \ fashion.\n"
