    \ the\n   currently used conventions for encoding Vietnamese characters into\n\
    \   7-bit US ASCII and in an 8-bit form.  These conventions are widely\n   used\
    \ by the overseas Vietnamese who are on the Internet and are\n   active in USENET.\

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   In this paper we describe two conventions for representing\
    \ Vietnamese\n   characters.  VISCII (pronounced \"visky\") is an 8-bit character\n\
    \   encoding that is similar to that used with ISO-8859.  VIQR\n   (pronounced\
    \ \"vicker\") is a mnemonic encoding of Vietnamese characters\n   into US ASCII\
    \ for use on 7-bit systems.  There is substantial\n   existing online freely distributable\
    \ software that implements these\n   conventions for UNIX and personal computers.\
    \  These encodings enable\n   Vietnamese-language users to take full advantage\
    \ of powerful tools\n   already developed for the English-speaking world, eliminating\n\
    \   unnecessary reinvention.  This paper describes these conventions in\n   part\
    \ so that MIME-compliant software might also support the\n   Vietnamese language.\n\
    \   NOTE: The accented Vietnamese letters are herein represented by their\n  \
    \ VIQR equivalents, offset by enclosing angle brackets.  For example,\n   the\
    \ single letter \"a acute\" is written as <a'>, where the apostrophe\n   is the\
    \ mnemonic symbol for the acute.\n"
- title: 2. LINGUISTIC OVERVIEW
  contents:
  - "2. LINGUISTIC OVERVIEW\n   As a romanized language, Vietnamese appears to lend\
    \ itself readily to\n   integration into existing English-based systems.  To cite\
    \ a simple\n   example, consider implementing support for French in such systems.\n\
    \   One can allocate code positions in the 8-bit space necessary for\n   accented\
    \ letters such as <e^> or <e'>, then provide a means for users\n   to access these\
    \ codes through the keyboard.  The required number of\n   \"extra\" code positions\
    \ is small (see, e.g., ISO-8859/Latin-1 [1]),\n   and the relatively low frequency\
    \ of occurrence of accented letters\n   does not place heavy demand on efficient\
    \ keyboard input schemes.  The\n   same things cannot be said for Vietnamese,\
    \ where both the number and\n   occurrence frequency of accented letters are large.\
    \  Apart from the\n   alphabetics already available in ASCII, Vietnamese requires\
    \ an\n   additional 134 combinations of a letter and diacritical symbols.\n  \
    \ Note that one can resort to a composite encoding scheme to reduce\n   this requirement,\
    \ but that would mean giving up on integration into\n   today's computing platforms\
    \ which for the most part do not support\n   such schemes.  In addition, the heavy\
    \ use of diacritical marks in\n   Vietnamese text calls for a keyboard input scheme\
    \ that does not\n   require extra keystrokes such as a special \"compose\" key\
    \ to generate\n   accented letters.  Because of the large number of possible\n\
    \   combinations, the scheme should also be easily learned and memorized.\n  \
    \ Finally, to integrate Vietnamese into current electronic mail systems\n   which\
    \ are still limited to 7 bits, there should be a representation\n   for Vietnamese\
    \ text that is readily readable in its 7-bit form.\n   The Viet-Std group, an\
    \ electronic standardization roundtable, has\n   worked over the past few years\
    \ to draft proposals addressing these\n   issues.  This has culminated in the\
    \ conventions to be described\n   briefly in the next two sections.  The detailed\
    \ technical\n   considerations have been reported elsewhere [2].  In this memo\
    \ we\n   give a brief outline of the working standards and describe supporting\n\
    \   software availability.\n"
- title: 3. SPECIFICATION OF VISCII
  contents:
  - "3. SPECIFICATION OF VISCII\n   VISCII stands for VIetnamese Standard Code for\
    \ Information\n   Interchange, an 8-bit encoding specification.  Its salient features\n\
    \   are:\n    1.  Encoding of all Vietnamese letters as single units\n       \
    \ rather than separating base vowels and diacritical\n        marks.\n    2. \
    \ Retention of the complete ASCII graphics repertoire\n        in order to facilitate\
    \ integration.\n    3.  Encoding the 6 least-often-used upper-case letters into\n\
    \        6 least problematic C0 (control) characters.\n    4.  Character placement\
    \ have been designed with\n        consideration for Unix/X integration, ISO-8859/Latin-1\n\
    \        compatibility, coexistence with a wide array of\n        existing software,\
    \ including provisions for single-\n        and double-line drawing characters\
    \ in the IBM graphic\n        character set.\n   The 8-bit VISCII encoding is\
    \ shown below.  Because of the limitations\n   of the 7-bit US ASCII character\
    \ set, here we use the mnemonic form to\n   represent Vietnamese glyphs.  See\
    \ the VIQR specification below for\n   clarification of how diacritical marks\
    \ are applied.  The online\n   PostScript version of reference [2] may also be\
    \ useful as it does\n   display each character correctly.\n               Table\

- title: 4. SPECIFICATION OF VIQR MNEMONICS
  contents:
  - "4. SPECIFICATION OF VIQR MNEMONICS\n   VIQR, VIetnamese Quoted-Readable specification,\
    \ is not an encoding\n   convention but is rather a convention for typing, reading,\
    \ and\n   transferring Vietnamese data using only the 7-bit ASCII character\n\
    \   set.  With VIQR, accented Vietnamese letters are represented by the\n   vowel\
    \ followed by ASCII characters whose appearances resemble those\n   of the corresponding\
    \ Vietnamese diacritical marks.  For example, the\n   phrase \"N<u+><o+'>c Vi<e^.>t\
    \ Nam\" is represented in 7-bits by\n   \"Nu+o+'c Vie^.t Nam\".  The complete\
    \ list of diacritical mark\n   equivalents is given in Table 2.  There is also\
    \ provision in the VIQR\n   specification to prevent undesirable composition,\
    \ for example, to\n   avoid getting \"How are you?\" composed into \"How are yo<u?>\"\
    .  For\n   details, please see [2].  VIQR therefore serves the following\n   purposes:\n\
    \  1.  It provides for a mnemonic, readable representation of\n      Vietnamese\
    \ in 7-bit form, which makes it easy to\n      transfer Vietnamese electronic\
    \ mail without special\n      conversion.  The originator and recipient can\n\
    \      communicate in Vietnamese without the need for an\n      8-bit environment\
    \ at any point in the data chain.\n  2.  It provides a bridge for translation\
    \ between 7- and 8-bit\n      environments.  In this context, typing in both 7-bit\n\
    \      and 8-bit systems requires exactly the same keystrokes,\n      the only\
    \ difference is that the 8-bit user gets to see\n      actual Vietnamese on-screen,\
    \ whereas the 7-bit user\n      sees a mnemonic representation thereof.  The same\n\
    \      options are available for the 7-bit and 8-bit recipients\n      of Vietnamese\
    \ text.\n   Because of its mnemonic nature, the VIQR typing method is easy to\n\
    \   learn and remember.  In pure 8-bit environments, special-purpose\n   software\
    \ developers may wish to devise more efficient input schemes,\n   but the intent\
    \ is for all Vietnamese keyboard software to support the\n   basic VIQR method\
    \ to minimize learning time for Vietnamese who will\n   already be familiar with\
    \ the mnemonic method described here.\n             Table 2.  VIQR Mnemonics for\
