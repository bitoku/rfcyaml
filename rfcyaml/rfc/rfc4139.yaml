- title: 4.  Requirements for Extending Applicability of GMPLS to ASON
  contents:
  - "4.  Requirements for Extending Applicability of GMPLS to ASON\n   The following\
    \ sections detail the signaling protocol requirements for\n   GMPLS to support\
    \ the ASON functions listed in Section 3.  ASON\n   defines a reference model\
    \ and functions (information elements) to\n   enable end-to-end call and connection\
    \ support by a protocol across\n   the respective interfaces, regardless of the\
    \ particular choice of\n   protocol(s) used in a network.  ASON does not restrict\
    \ the use of\n   other protocols or the protocol-specific messages used to support\
    \ the\n   ASON functions.  Therefore, the support of these ASON functions by a\n\
    \   protocol shall not be restricted by (i.e., must be strictly\n   independent\
    \ of and agnostic to) any particular choice of UNI, I-NNI,\n   or E-NNI used elsewhere\
    \ in the network.  To allow for interworking\n   between different protocol implementations,\
    \ [ITU-T-G.7713] recognizes\n   that an interworking function may be needed.\n\
    \   In support of the G.8080 end-to-end call model across different\n   control\
    \ domains, end-to-end signaling should be facilitated\n   regardless of the administrative\
    \ boundaries, protocols within the\n   network, or the method of realization of\
    \ connections within any part\n   of the network.  This implies the need for a\
    \ clear mapping of ASON\n   signaling requests between GMPLS control domains and\
    \ non-GMPLS\n   control domains.  This document provides signaling requirements\
    \ for\n   G.8080 distributed call and connection management based on GMPLS,\n\
    \   within a GMPLS based control domain (I-NNI), and between GMPLS based\n   control\
    \ domains (E-NNI).  It does not restrict use of other (non\n   GMPLS) protocols\
    \ to be used within a control domain or as an E-NNI or\n   UNI.  Interworking\
    \ aspects related to the use of non-GMPLS protocols,\n   such as UNI, E-NNI, or\
    \ I-NNI -- including mapping of non-GMPLS\n   protocol signaling requests to corresponding\
    \ ASON signaling\n   functionality and support of non-GMPLS address formats --\
    \ is not\n   within the scope of the GMPLS signaling protocol.  Interworking\n\
    \   aspects are implementation-specific and strictly under the\n   responsibility\
    \ of the interworking function and, thus, outside the\n   scope of this document.\n\
    \   By definition, any User-Network Interface (UNI) that is compliant\n   with\
    \ [RFC3473] (e.g., [GMPLS-OVERLAY] and [GMPLS-VPN]) is considered\n   to be included\
    \ within the GMPLS suite of protocols and MUST be\n   supported by the ASON GMPLS\
    \ signaling functionality.\n   Compatibility aspects of non-GMPLS systems (nodes)\
    \ within a GMPLS\n   control domain (i.e., the support of GMPLS systems and other\
    \ systems\n   that utilize other signaling protocols or some that may not support\n\
    \   any signaling protocols) is described.  For example, Section 4.5,\n   'Support\
    \ for Extended Label Association', covers the requirements for\n   when a non-GMPLS\
    \ capable sub-network is introduced or when nodes do\n   not support any signaling\
    \ protocols.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Support for Soft Permanent Connection (SPC) Capability
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Support for Soft Permanent Connection (SPC) Capability\n   A Soft Permanent\
    \ Connection (SPC) is a combination of a permanent\n   connection at the source\
    \ user-to-network side, a permanent connection\n   at the destination user-to-network\
    \ side, and a switched connection\n   within the network.  An Element Management\
    \ System (EMS) or a Network\n   Management System (NMS) typically initiates the\
    \ establishment of the\n   switched connection by communicating with the node\
    \ that initiates the\n   switched connection (also known as the ingress node).\
    \  The latter\n   then sets the connection using the distributed GMPLS signaling\n\
    \   protocol.  For the SPC, the communication method between the EMS/NMS\n   and\
    \ the ingress node is beyond the scope of this document (as it is\n   for any\
    \ other function described in this document).\n   The end-to-end connection is\
    \ thus created by associating the incoming\n   interface of the ingress node with\
    \ the switched connection within the\n   network, along with the outgoing interface\
    \ of the switched connection\n   terminating network node (also referred to as\
    \ egress node).  An SPC\n   connection is illustrated in the following figure.\
    \  This shows the\n   user's node A connected to a provider's node B via link\
    \ #1, the\n   user's node Z connected to a provider's node Y via link #3, and\
    \ an\n   abstract link #2 connecting the provider's node B and node Y.  Nodes\n\
    \   B and Y are referred to as the ingress and egress (respectively) of\n   the\
    \ network switched connection.\n       ---       ---                 ---     \
    \  ---\n      | A |--1--| B |-----2-//------| Y |--3--| Z |\n       ---      \
    \ ---                 ---       ---\n   In this instance, the connection on link\
    \ #1 and link #3 are both\n   provisioned (permanent connections that may be simple\
    \ links).  In\n   contrast, the connection over link #2 is set up using the distributed\n\
    \   control plane.  Thus, the SPC is composed of the stitching of link\n   #1,\
    \ #2, and #3.\n   Thus, to support the capability of requesting an SPC connection:\n\
    \   -  The GMPLS signaling protocol MUST be capable of supporting the\n      ability\
    \ to indicate the outgoing link and label information used\n      when setting\
    \ up the destination provisioned connection.\n   -  In addition, due to the inter-domain\
    \ applicability of ASON\n      networks, the GMPLS signaling protocol SHOULD also\
    \ support\n      indication of the service level requested for the SPC.  In cases\n\
    \      where an SPC spans multiple domains, indication of both source and\n  \
    \    destination endpoints controlling the SPC request MAY be needed.\n      These\
    \ MAY be done via the source and destination signaling\n      controller addresses.\n\
    \   Note that the association at the ingress node, between the permanent\n   connection\
    \ and the switched connection, is an implementation matter\n   that may be under\
    \ the control of the EMS/NMS and is not within the\n   scope of the signaling\
    \ protocol.  Therefore, it is outside the scope\n   of this document.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Support for Call and Connection Separation
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Support for Call and Connection Separation\n   A call may be simply described\
    \ as \"An association between endpoints\n   that supports an instance of a service\"\
    \ [ITU-T-G.8080].  Thus, it can\n   be considered a service provided between two\
    \ end-points, wherein\n   several calls may exist between them.  Multiple connections\
    \ may be\n   associated with each call.  The call concept provides an abstract\n\
    \   relationship between two users.  This relationship describes (or\n   verifies)\
    \ the extent to which users are willing to offer (or accept)\n   service to/from\
    \ each other.  Therefore, a call does not provide the\n   actual connectivity\
    \ for transmitting user traffic; it only builds a\n   relationship by which subsequent\
    \ connections may be made.\n   A call MAY be associated with zero, one, or multiple\
    \ connections.\n   For the same call, connections MAY be of different types and\
    \ each\n   connection MAY exist independently of other connections (i.e., each\n\
    \   connection is setup and released with separate signaling messages).\n   The\
    \ concept of the call allows for a better flexibility in how end-\n   points set\
    \ up connections and how networks offer services to users.\n   For example, a\
    \ call allows:\n   -  An upgrade strategy for control plane operations, where\
    \ a call\n      control component (service provisioning) may be separate from\
    \ the\n      actual nodes hosting the connections (where the connection control\n\
    \      component may reside).\n   -  Identification of the call initiator (with\
    \ both network call\n      controller, as well as destination user) prior to connection,\n\
    \      which may result in decreasing contention during resource\n      reservation.\n\
    \   -  General treatment of multiple connections, which may be associated\n  \
    \    for several purposes; for example, a pair of working and recovery\n     \
    \ connections may belong to the same call.\n   To support the introduction of\
    \ the call concept, GMPLS signaling\n   SHOULD include a call identification mechanism\
    \ and SHOULD allow for\n   end-to-end call capability exchange.\n   For instance,\
    \ a feasible structure for the call identifier (to\n   guarantee global uniqueness)\
    \ MAY concatenate a globally unique fixed\n   ID (e.g., may be composed of country\
    \ code or carrier code) with an\n   operator specific ID (where the operator specific\
    \ ID may be composed\n   of a unique access point code - such as source node address\
    \ - and a\n   local identifier).  Other formats SHALL also be possible, depending\n\
    \   on the call identification conventions between the parties involved\n   in\
    \ the call setup process.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Support for Call Segments
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Support for Call Segments\n   As described in [ITU-T-G.8080], call segmentation\
    \ MAY be applied when\n   a call crosses several control domains.  As such, when\
    \ the call\n   traverses multiple control domains, an end-to-end call MAY consist\
    \ of\n   multiple call segments.  For a given end-to-end call, each call\n   segment\
    \ MAY have one or more associated connections, and the number\n   of connections\
    \ associated with each call segment MAY be different.\n   The initiating caller\
    \ interacts with the called party by means of one\n   or more intermediate network\
    \ call controllers, located at control\n   domain boundaries (i.e., at inter-domain\
    \ reference points, UNI or\n   E-NNI).  Call segment capabilities are defined\
    \ by the policies\n   associated at these reference points.\n   This capability\
    \ allows for independent (policy based) choices of\n   signaling, concatenation,\
    \ data plane protection, and control plane\n   driven recovery paradigms in different\
    \ control domains.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Support for Extended Restart Capabilities
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Support for Extended Restart Capabilities\n   Various types of failures\
    \ may occur, affecting the ASON control\n   plane.  Requirements placed on control\
    \ plane failure recovery by\n   [ITU-T-G.8080] include:\n   -  Any control plane\

- title: 4.5.  Support for Extended Label Association
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Support for Extended Label Association\n   It is an ASON requirement to\
    \ enable support for G.805 [ITU-T-G.805]\n   serial compound links.  The text\
    \ below provides an illustrative\n   example of such a scenario, and the associated\
    \ requirements.\n   Labels are defined in GMPLS (see [RFC3471]) to provide information\
    \ on\n   the resources used on a link local basis for a particular connection.\n\
    \   The labels may range from specifying a particular timeslot,\n   indicating\
    \ a particular wavelength, or to identifying a particular\n   port/fiber.  In\
    \ the ASON context, the value of a label may not be\n   consistent across a link.\
    \  For example, the figure below illustrates\n   the case where two GMPLS capable\
    \ nodes (A and Z) are interconnected\n   across two non-GMPLS capable nodes (B\
    \ and C), where all of these\n   nodes are SONET/SDH nodes, providing, for example,\
    \ a VC-4 service.\n       -----                     -----\n      |     |    ---\
    \     ---    |     |\n      |  A  |---| B |---| C |---|  Z  |\n      |     | \
    \   ---     ---    |     |\n       -----                     -----\n   Labels\
    \ have an associated implicit imposed structure based on\n   [GMPLS-SONET] and\
    \ [GMPLS-OTN].  Thus, once the local label is\n   exchanged with its neighboring\
    \ control plane node, the structure of\n   the local label may not be significant\
    \ to the neighbor node, as the\n   association between the local and the remote\
    \ label may not\n   necessarily be the same.  This issue does not present a problem\
    \ in\n   simple point-to-point connections between two control plane-enabled\n\
    \   nodes in which the timeslots are mapped 1:1 across the interface.\n   However,\
    \ if a non-GMPLS capable sub-network is introduced between\n   these nodes (as\
    \ in the above figure, where the sub-network provides\n   re-arrangement capability\
    \ for the timeslots), label scoping may\n   become an issue.\n   In this context,\
    \ there is an implicit assumption that the data plane\n   connections between\
    \ the GMPLS capable edges already exist prior to\n   any connection request. \
    \ For instance, node A's outgoing VC-4's\n   timeslot #1 (with SUKLM label=[1,0,0,0,0]),\
    \ as defined in\n   [GMPLS-SONET]), may be mapped onto node B's outgoing VC-4's\
    \ timeslot\n   #6 (label=[6,0,0,0,0]), or may be mapped onto node C's outgoing\
    \ VC-\n   4's timeslot #4 (label=[4,0,0,0,0]).  Thus, by the time node Z\n   receives\
    \ the request from node A with label=[1,0,0,0,0], node Z's\n   local label and\
    \ timeslot no longer correspond to the received label\n   and timeslot information.\n\
    \   As such, to support this capability, a label association mechanism\n   SHOULD\
    \ be used by the control plane node to map the received (remote)\n   label into\
    \ a locally significant label.  The information necessary to\n   allow mapping\
    \ from a received label value to a locally significant\n   label value can be\
    \ derived in several ways including:\n   -  Manual provisioning of the label association\n\
    \   -  Discovery of the label association\n   Either method MAY be used.  In case\
    \ of dynamic association, the\n   discovery mechanism operates at the timeslot/label\
    \ level before the\n   connection request is processed at the ingress node.  Note\
    \ that in\n   the case where two nodes are directly connected, no association\
    \ is\n   required.  In particular, for directly connected TDM interfaces, no\n\
    \   mapping function (at all) is required due to the implicit label\n   structure\
    \ (see [GMPLS-SONET] and [GMPLS-OTN]).  In these instances,\n   the label association\
    \ function provides a one-to-one mapping of the\n   received to local label values.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Support for Crankback
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Support for Crankback\n   Crankback has been identified as an important\
    \ requirement for ASON\n   networks.  Upon a setup failure, it allows a connection\
    \ setup request\n   to be retried on an alternate path that detours around a blocked\
    \ link\n   or node (e.g., because a link or a node along the selected path has\n\
    \   insufficient resources).\n   Crankback mechanisms MAY also be applied during\
    \ connection recovery\n   by indicating the location of the failed link or node.\
    \  This would\n   significantly improve the successful recovery ratio for failed\n\
    \   connections, especially in situations where a large number of setup\n   requests\
    \ are simultaneously triggered.\n   The following mechanisms are assumed during\
    \ crankback signaling:\n   -  The blocking resource (link or node) MUST be identified\
    \ and\n      returned in the error response message to the repair node (that\n\
    \      may or may not be the ingress node); it is also assumed that this\n   \
    \   process will occur within a limited period of time.\n   -  The computation\
    \ (from the repair node) of an alternate path around\n      the blocking link\
    \ or node that satisfies the initial connection\n      constraints.\n   -  The\
    \ re-initiation of the connection setup request from the repair\n      node (i.e.,\
    \ the node that has intercepted and processed the error\n      response message).\n\
    \   The following properties are expected for crankback signaling:\n   -  Error\
    \ information persistence: the entity that computes the\n      alternate (re-routing)\
    \ path SHOULD store the identifiers of the\n      blocking resources, as indicated\
    \ in the error message, until the\n      connection is successfully established\
    \ or until the node abandons\n      rerouting attempts.  Since crankback may happen\
    \ more than once\n      while establishing a specific connection, the history\
    \ of all\n      experienced blockages for this connection SHOULD be maintained\
    \ (at\n      least until the routing protocol updates the state of this\n    \
    \  information) to perform an accurate path computation that will\n      avoid\
    \ all blockages.\n   -  Rerouting attempts limitation: to prevent an endless repetition\
    \ of\n      connection setup attempts (using crankback information), the\n   \
    \   number of retries SHOULD be strictly limited.  The maximum number\n      of\
    \ crankback rerouting attempts allowed MAY be limited per\n      connection or\
    \ per node:\n      -  When the number of retries at a particular node is exceeded,\n\
    \         the node that is currently handling the failure reports the\n      \
    \   error message upstream to the next repair node, where further\n         rerouting\
    \ attempts MAY be performed.  It is important that the\n         crankback information\
    \ provided indicate that re-routing through\n         this node will not succeed.\n\
    \      -  When the maximum number of retries for a specific connection\n     \
    \    has been exceeded, the repair node that is handling the current\n       \
    \  failure SHOULD send an error message upstream to indicate the\n         \"\
    Maximum number of re-routings exceeded\".  This error message\n         will be\
    \ sent back to the ingress node with no further rerouting\n         attempts.\
    \  Then, the ingress node MAY choose to retry the\n         connection setup according\
    \ to local policy, using its original\n         path, or computing a path that\
    \ avoids the blocking resources.\n      Note: After several retries, a given repair\
    \ point MAY be unable to\n      compute a path to the destination node that avoids\
    \ all of the\n      blockages.  In this case, it MUST pass the error message upstream\n\
    \      to the next repair point.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Support for Additional Error Cases
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Support for Additional Error Cases\n   To support the ASON network, the\
    \ following additional category of\n   error cases are defined:\n   -  Errors\
    \ associated with basic call and soft permanent connection\n      support.  For\
    \ example, these MAY include incorrect assignment of\n      IDs for the Call or\
    \ an invalid interface ID for the soft permanent\n      connection.\n   -  Errors\
    \ associated with policy failure during processing of the new\n      call and\
    \ soft permanent connection capabilities.  These MAY\n      include unauthorized\
    \ requests for the particular capability.\n   -  Errors associated with incorrect\
    \ specification of the service\n      level.\n"
- title: 5.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "5.  Backward Compatibility\n   As noted above, in support of GMPLS protocol requirements,\
    \ any\n   extensions to the GMPLS signaling protocol, in support of the\n   requirements\
    \ described in this document, MUST be backward compatible.\n   Backward compatibility\
    \ means that in a network of nodes, where some\n   support GMPLS signaling extensions\
    \ to facilitate the functions\n   described in this document, and some do not,\
    \ it MUST be possible to\n   set up conventional connections (as described by\
    \ [RFC3473]) between\n   any arbitrary pair of nodes and to traverse any arbitrary\
    \ set of\n   nodes.  Further, the use of any GMPLS signaling extensions to set\
    \ up\n   calls or connections that support the functions described in this\n \
    \  document MUST not perturb existing conventional connections.\n   Additionally,\
    \ when transit nodes that do not need to participate in\n   the new functions\
    \ described in this document lie on the path of a\n   call or connection, the\
    \ GMPLS signaling extensions MUST be such that\n   those transit nodes are able\
    \ to participate in the establishment of a\n   call or connection by passing the\
    \ setup information onwards,\n   unmodified.\n   Lastly, when a transit or egress\
    \ node is called upon to support a\n   function described in this document, but\
    \ does not support the\n   function, the GMPLS signaling extensions MUST be such\
    \ that they can\n   be rejected by pre-existing GMPLS signaling mechanisms in\
    \ a way that\n   is not detrimental to the network as a whole.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Per [ITU-T-G.8080], it is not possible to establish\
    \ a connection in\n   advance of call setup completion.  Also, policy and authentication\n\
    \   procedures are applied prior to the establishment of the call (and\n   can\
    \ then also be restricted to connection establishment in the\n   context of this\
    \ call).\n   This document introduces no new security requirements to GMPLS\n\
    \   signaling (see [RFC3471]).\n"

- title: Appendix - Terminology
  contents:
  - "Appendix - Terminology\n   This document makes use of the following terms:\n\
    \   Administrative domain: See Recommendation G.805 [ITU-T-G.805].\n   Call: Association\
    \ between endpoints that supports an instance of a\n   service.\n   Connection:\
    \ Concatenation of link connections and sub-network\n   connections that allows\
    \ the transport of user information between the\n   ingress and egress points\
    \ of a sub-network.\n   Control Plane: Performs the call control and connection\
    \ control\n   functions.  The control plane sets up and releases connections\n\
    \   through signaling, and may restore a connection in case of a failure.\n  \
    \ (Control) Domain: Represents a collection of entities that are\n   grouped for\
    \ a particular purpose.  G.8080 applies this G.805\n   recommendation concept\
    \ (that defines two particular forms: the\n   administrative domain and the management\
    \ domain) to the control plane\n   in the form of a control domain.  Entities\
    \ grouped in a control\n   domain are components of the control plane.\n   External\
    \ NNI (E-NNI): Interfaces are located between protocol\n   controllers that are\
    \ situated between control domains.\n   Internal NNI (I-NNI): Interfaces are located\
    \ between protocol\n   controllers within control domains.\n   Link: See Recommendation\
    \ G.805 [ITU-T-G.805].\n   Management Plane: Performs management functions for\
    \ the Transport\n   Plane, the control plane, and the system as a whole.  It also\n\
    \   provides coordination between all the planes.  The following\n   management\
    \ functional areas are performed in the management plane:\n   performance, fault,\
    \ configuration, accounting, and security\n   management.\n   Management Domain:\
    \ See Recommendation G.805 [ITU-T-G.805].\n   Transport Plane: Provides bi-directional\
    \ or unidirectional transfer\n   of user information, from one location to another.\
    \  It can also\n   provide transfer of some control and network management information.\n\
    \   The Transport Plane is layered and is equivalent to the Transport\n   Network\
    \ defined in G.805 [ITU-T-G.805].\n   User Network Interface (UNI): Interfaces\
    \ are located between protocol\n   controllers, between a user and a control domain.\n"
