    \ hypothetical computer, MIX,\n   together with an assemble for the MIX assembly\
    \ language, MIXAL,\n   available on any ARPA Network Host? If not, will not some\
    \ Network\n   Host make them available (cheaply)?--it would be considerable service\n\
    \   to all of us who are students of the \"Art of Computer Programming.\"\n  \
