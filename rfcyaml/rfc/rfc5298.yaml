  - "1.  Introduction\n   Protection and recovery in Multiprotocol Label Switching\
    \ (MPLS) and\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks are described in [RFC4428].\
    \  These\n   are important features for service delivery in MPLS and GMPLS\n \
    \  networks.\n   MPLS and GMPLS networks were originally limited to single domain\n\
    \   environments.  Increasingly, multi-domain MPLS and GMPLS networks are\n  \
    \ being considered, where a domain is considered to be any collection\n   of network\
    \ elements within a common sphere of address management or\n   path computational\
    \ responsibility.  Examples of such domains include\n   Interior Gateway Protocol\
    \ (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASes).\n   [RFC4726] provides a framework\
    \ for inter-domain MPLS and GMPLS\n   traffic engineering.  It introduces and\
    \ discusses the various schemes\n   and processes to establish Label Switched\
    \ Paths (LSPs) in multi-\n   domain environments.\n   However, protection and\
    \ recovery introduce additional complexities to\n   LSP establishment.  Protection\
    \ LSPs are generally required to be path\n   diverse from the working LSPs that\
    \ they protect.  Achieving this is\n   particularly challenging in multi-domain\
    \ environments because no\n   single path computation or planning point is capable\
    \ of determining\n   path diversity for both paths from one end to the other.\n\
    \   This document analyzes various schemes to realize MPLS and GMPLS LSP\n   recovery\
    \ in multi-domain networks.  The main focus for this document\n   is on establishing\
    \ end-to-end diverse Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs\n   in multi-domain networks.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology\
    \ for LSP\n   recovery set out in [RFC4427], and with the terms introduced in\n\
    \   [RFC4726] that provides a framework for inter-domain Label Switched\n   Path\
    \ (LSP) setup.  Key terminology may also be found in [RFC4216]\n   that sets out\
    \ requirements for inter-AS MPLS traffic engineering.\n   The following key terms\
    \ from those sources are used within this\n   document.\n   - Domain: See [RFC4726].\
    \  A domain is considered to be any collection\n     of network elements within\
    \ a common sphere of address management or\n     path computational responsibility.\
    \  Note that nested domains\n     continue to be out of scope.  Section 1.2 provides\
    \ additional\n     details.\n   - Working LSP: See [RFC4427].  The working LSP\
    \ transports normal user\n     traffic.  Note that the term LSP and TE LSP will\
    \ be used\n     interchangeably.\n   - Recovery LSP: See [RFC4427].  The recovery\
    \ LSP transports normal\n     user traffic when the working LSP fails.  The recovery\
    \ LSP may also\n     carry user traffic even when the working LSP is operating\
    \ normally\n     and transporting the user traffic (e.g., 1+1 protection).  The\n\
    \     recovery LSP is sometimes referred to as a protecting LSP.\n   - Diversity:\
    \ See [RFC4726].  Diversity means the relationship of\n     multiple LSPs, where\
    \ those LSPs do not share some specific type of\n     resource (e.g., link, node,\
    \ or shared risk link group (SRLG)).\n     Diversity is also referred to as disjointness.\n\
    \     Diverse LSPs may be used for various purposes, such as load-\n     balancing\
    \ and recovery.  In this document, the recovery aspect of\n     diversity, specifically\
    \ the end-to-end diversity of two traffic\n     engineering (TE) LSPs, is the\
    \ focus.  The two diverse LSPs are\n     referred to as the working LSP and recovery\
    \ LSP.\n   - Confidentiality: See [RFC4216].  Confidentiality refers to the\n\
    \     protection of information about the topology and resources of one\n    \
    \ domain from visibility by people or applications outside that\n     domain.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Domain
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Domain\n   In order to fully understand the issues addressed in this document,\n\
    \   it is necessary to carefully define and scope the term \"domain\".\n   As\
    \ defined in [RFC4726], a domain is considered to be any collection\n   of network\
    \ elements within a common sphere of address management or\n   path computational\
    \ responsibility.  Examples of such domains include\n   IGP areas and Autonomous\
    \ Systems.  Networks accessed over the GMPLS\n   User-to-Network Interface (UNI)\
    \ [RFC4208], and Layer One Virtual\n   Private Networks (L1VPNs) [RFC4847] are\
    \ special cases of multi-domain\n   networks.\n   Example motivations for using\
    \ more than one domain include\n   administrative separation, scalability, and\
    \ the construction of\n   domains for the purpose of providing protection.  These\
    \ latter\n   \"protection domains\" offer edge-to-edge protection facilities for\n\
    \   spans or segments of end-to-end LSPs.\n   As described in [RFC4726], there\
    \ could be TE parameters (such as\n   color and priority) whose meanings are specific\
    \ to each domain.  In\n   such scenarios, in order to set up inter-domain LSPs,\
    \ mapping\n   functions may be needed to transform the TE parameters based on\n\
    \   policy agreements between domain administrators.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Document Scope
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Document Scope\n   This document analyzes various schemes to realize MPLS\
    \ and GMPLS LSP\n   recovery in multi-domain networks.  It is based on the existing\n\
    \   framework for multi-domain LSP setup [RFC4726].  Note that this\n   document\
    \ does not prevent the development of additional techniques\n   where appropriate\
    \ (i.e., additional to the ones described in this\n   document).  In other words,\
    \ this document shows how the existing\n   techniques can be applied.\n   There\
    \ are various recovery techniques for LSPs.  For TE LSPs, the\n   major techniques\
    \ are end-to-end recovery [RFC4872], local protection\n   such as Fast Reroute\
    \ (FRR) [RFC4090] (in packet switching\n   environments), and segment recovery\
    \ [RFC4873] (in GMPLS).\n   The main focus of this document is the analysis of\
    \ diverse TE LSP\n   setup schemes that can be used in the context of end-to-end\
    \ recovery.\n   The methodology is to show different combinations of functional\n\
    \   elements such as path computation and signaling techniques.\n   [RFC4105]\
    \ and [RFC4216] describe requirements for diverse LSPs.\n   There are various\
    \ types of diversity, and this document focuses on\n   node, link, and shared\
    \ risk link group (SRLG) diversity.\n   Recovery LSPs may be used for 1+1 protection,\
    \ 1:1 protection, or\n   shared mesh restoration.  However, the requirements for\
    \ path\n   diversity, the ways to compute diverse paths, and the signaling of\n\
    \   these TE LSPs are common across all uses.  These topics are the main\n   scope\
    \ of this document.\n   Note that diverse LSPs may be used for various purposes\
    \ in addition\n   to recovery.  An example is for load-balancing, so as to limit\
    \ the\n   traffic disruption to a portion of the traffic flow in case of a\n \
    \  single node failure.  This document does not preclude use of diverse\n   LSP\
    \ setup schemes for other purposes.\n   The following are beyond the scope of\
    \ this document.\n   - Analysis of recovery techniques other than the use of link,\
    \ node,\n     or SRLG diverse LSPs (see Section 1.4).\n   - Details of maintenance\
    \ of diverse LSPs, such as re-optimization and\n     Operations and Maintenance\
    \ (OAM).\n   - Comparative evaluation of LSP setup schemes.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Note on Other Recovery Techniques
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Note on Other Recovery Techniques\n   Fast Reroute and segment recovery\
    \ in multi-domain networks are\n   described in Section 5.4 of [RFC4726], and\
    \ a more detailed analysis\n   is provided in Section 5 of [RFC5151].  This document\
    \ does not cover\n   any additional analysis for Fast Reroute and segment recovery\
    \ in\n   multi-domain networks.\n   The recovery type of an LSP or service may\
    \ change at a domain\n   boundary.  That is, the recovery type could remain the\
    \ same within\n   one domain, but might be different in the next domain or on\
    \ the\n   connections between domains.  This may be due to the capabilities of\n\
    \   each domain, administrative policies, or to topology limitations.  An\n  \
    \ example is where protection at the domain boundary is provided by\n   link protection\
    \ on the inter-domain links, but where protection\n   within each domain is achieved\
    \ through segment recovery.  This\n   mixture of protection techniques is beyond\
    \ the scope of this\n   document.\n   Domain diversity (that is, the selection\
    \ of paths that have only the\n   ingress and egress domains in common) may be\
    \ considered as one form\n   of diversity in multi-domain networks, but this is\
    \ beyond the scope\n   of this document (see Section 2.2).\n"
- title: 1.5.  Signaling Options
  contents:
  - "1.5.  Signaling Options\n   There are three signaling options for establishing\
    \ inter-domain TE\n   LSPs: nesting, contiguous LSPs, and stitching [RFC4726].\
    \  The\n   description in this document of diverse LSP setup is agnostic in\n\
    \   relation to the signaling option used, unless otherwise specified.\n   Note\
    \ that signaling option considerations for Fast Reroute and\n   segment recovery\
    \ are described in [RFC5151].\n"

    \ Connectivity\n   In Figure 2, domains are connected in a mesh topology.  There\
    \ are\n   multiple paths between nodes A and D, and these paths do not cross\n\
    \   the same domains.  If inter-domain connectivity forms a mesh,\n   domain-level\
    \ routing is required (even for the unprotected case).\n   This is tightly coupled\
    \ with the next-hop domain resolution/discovery\n   mechanisms used in IP networks.\n\
    \   In this document, we assume that domain-level routing is given via\n   configuration,\
    \ policy, or some external mechanism, and that this is\n   not part of the path\
    \ computation process described later in this\n   document.\n   Domain-level routing\
    \ may also allow \"domain re-entry\" where a path\n   re-enters a domain that\
    \ it has previously exited (e.g., domain#X-\n   domain#Y-domain#X).  This requires\
    \ specific considerations when\n   confidentiality (described in Section 3.2)\
    \ is required, and is beyond\n   the scope of this document.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the working LSP and the recovery LSP may or may not be\n   routed along the\
    \ same set of domains in the same order.  In this\n   document, we assume that\
    \ the working LSP and recovery LSP follow the\n   same set of domains in the same\
    \ order (via configuration, policy or\n   some external mechanism).  That is,\
    \ we assume that the domain mesh\n   topology is reduced to a linear domain topology\
    \ for each pair of\n   working and recovery LSPs.\n   In summary,\n   - There\
    \ is no assumption about the multi-domain network topology.\n     For example,\
    \ there could be more than two domain boundary nodes or\n     inter-domain links\
    \ (links connecting a pair of domain boundary\n     nodes belonging to different\
    \ domains).\n   - It is assumed that in a multi-domain topology, the sequence\
    \ of\n     domains that the working LSP and the recovery LSP follow must be\n\
    \     the same and is pre-configured.\n   - Domain re-entry is out of scope and\
    \ is not considered further.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Note on Domain Diversity
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Note on Domain Diversity\n   As described in Section 1.4, domain diversity\
    \ means the selection of\n   paths that have only the ingress and egress domains\
    \ in common.  This\n   may provide enhanced resilience against failures, and is\
    \ a way to\n   ensure path diversity for most of the path of the LSP.\n   In Section\
    \ 2.1, we assumed that the working LSP and the recovery LSP\n   follow the same\
    \ set of domains in the same order.  Under this\n   assumption, domain diversity\
    \ cannot be achieved.  However, by\n   relaxing this assumption, domain diversity\
    \ could be achieved, e.g.,\n   by either of the following schemes.\n   - Consider\
    \ domain diversity as a special case of SRLG diversity\n     (i.e., assign an\
    \ SRLG ID to each domain).\n   - Configure domain-level routing to provide domain-diverse\

- title: 3.1.  Scalability versus Optimality
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Scalability versus Optimality\n   As described in [RFC4726], scalability\
    \ and optimality are two\n   conflicting objectives.  Note that the meaning of\
    \ optimality differs\n   depending on each network operation.  Some examples of\
    \ optimality in\n   the context of diverse LSPs are:\n   - Minimizing the sum\
    \ of their cost while maintaining diversity.\n   - Restricting the difference\
    \ of their costs (for example, so as to\n     minimize the delay difference after\
    \ switch-over) while maintaining\n     diversity.\n   By restricting TE information\
    \ distribution to only within each domain\n   (and not across domain boundaries)\
    \ as required by [RFC4105] and\n   [RFC4216], it may not be possible to compute\
    \ an optimal path.  As\n   such, it might not be possible to compute diverse paths,\
    \ even if they\n   exist.  However, if we assume domain-level routing is given\
    \ (as\n   discussed in Section 2), it would be possible to compute diverse\n \
    \  paths using specific computation schemes, if such paths exist.  This\n   is\
    \ discussed further in Section 4.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Key Concepts
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Key Concepts\n   Three key concepts to classify various diverse LSP computation\
    \ and\n   setup schemes are presented below.\n   o With or without confidentiality\n\
    \     - Without confidentiality\n       It is possible to specify a path across\
    \ multiple domains in\n       signaling (by means of the Resource Reservation\
    \ Protocol-TE\n       (RSVP-TE) Explicit Route Object (ERO)), and to obtain record\
    \ of\n       the inter-domain path used (by means of the RSVP-TE Record Route\n\
    \       Object (RRO)).  In this case, it is clear that one domain has\n      \
    \ control over the path followed in another domain, and that the\n       path\
    \ actually used in one domain is visible from within another\n       domain.\n\
    \       Examples of this configuration are multi-area networks, and some\n   \
    \    forms of multi-AS networks (especially within the same provider).\n     \
    \  In these cases, there is no requirement for confidentiality.\n     - With confidentiality\n\
    \       Where confidentiality of domain topology and operational policy\n    \
    \   is required, it is not possible to specify or obtain a full path\n       across\
    \ other domains.  Partial paths may be specified and\n       reported using domain\
    \ identifiers or the addresses of domain\n       border routers in the EROs and\
    \ RROs.\n       Examples of this configuration are some forms of multi-AS\n  \
    \     networks (especially inter-provider networks), GMPLS-UNI\n       networks,\
    \ and L1VPNs.\n   o Multi-domain path computation, per-domain path computation,\
    \ and\n     inter-domain collaborative path computation\n     - Multi-domain path\
    \ computation\n       If a single network element can see the topology of all\
    \ domains\n       along the path, it is able to compute a full end-to-end path.\n\
    \       Clearly, this is only possible where confidentiality is not\n       required.\n\
    \       Such a network element might be the head-end Label Switching\n       Router\
    \ (LSR), a Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655], or a\n       Network Management\
    \ System (NMS).  This mode of path computation\n       is discussed in Sections\
    \ 4 and 5.\n     - Per-domain path computation\n       The path of an LSP may\
    \ be computed domain-by-domain as LSP\n       signaling progresses through the\
    \ network.  This scheme requires\n       ERO expansion in each domain to construct\
    \ the next segment of the\n       path toward the destination.  The establishment\
    \ of unprotected\n       LSPs in this way is covered in [RFC5152].\n     - Inter-domain\
    \ collaborative path computation\n       In this scheme, path computation is typically\
    \ done before\n       signaling and uses communication between cooperating PCEs.\
    \  An\n       example of such a scheme is Backward Recursive Path Computation\n\
    \       (BRPC) [BRPC].\n       It is possible to combine multiple path computation\
    \ techniques\n       (including using a different technique for the working and\n\
    \       recovery LSPs), but details are beyond the scope of this\n       document.\n\
    \   o Sequential path computation or simultaneous path computation\n     - Sequential\
    \ path computation\n       The path of the working LSP is computed without considering\
    \ the\n       recovery LSP, and then the path of the recovery LSP is computed.\n\
    \       This scheme is applicable when the recovery LSP is added later as\n  \
    \     a change to the service grade, but may also be used when both the\n    \
    \   working and recovery LSPs are established from the start.\n       Using this\
    \ approach, it may not be possible to find diverse paths\n       for the LSPs\
    \ in \"trap\" topologies.  Furthermore, such sequential\n       path computation\
    \ approaches reduce the likelihood of selecting an\n       \"optimal\" solution\
    \ with regards to a specific objective function.\n     - Simultaneous path computation\n\
    \       The path of the working LSP and the path of the recovery LSP are\n   \
    \    computed simultaneously.  In this scheme, it is possible to avoid\n     \
    \  trap conditions and it may be more possible to achieve an optimal\n       result.\n\
    \   Note that LSP setup, with or without confidentiality, depends on per-\n  \
    \ domain configuration.  The choice of per-domain path computation or\n   inter-domain\
    \ collaborative path computation, and the choice between\n   sequential path computation\
    \ or simultaneous path computation can be\n   determined for each individual pair\
    \ of working/recovery LSPs.\n   The analysis of various diverse LSP setup schemes\
    \ is described in\n   Sections 4 and 5, based on the concepts set out above.\n\
    \   Some other considerations, such as network topology-specific\n   considerations,\
    \ addressing considerations, and SRLG diversity are\n   described in Sections\

  - "5.  Diverse LSP Setup Schemes with Confidentiality\n   In the context of this\
    \ section, the term confidentiality applies to\n   the protection of information\
    \ about the topology and resources\n   present within one domain from visibility\
    \ by people or applications\n   outside that domain.  This includes, but is not\
    \ limited to, recording\n   of LSP routes, and the advertisements of TE information.\
    \  The\n   confidentiality does not apply to the protection of user traffic.\n\
    \   Diverse LSP setup schemes with confidentiality are similar to ones\n   without\
    \ confidentiality.  However, several additional mechanisms are\n   needed to preserve\
    \ confidentiality.  Examples of such mechanisms are:\n     - Path key: A path\
    \ key is used in place of a segment of the path of\n       an LSP when the LSP\
    \ is signaled, when the path of the LSP is\n       reported by signaling, or when\
    \ the LSP's path is generated by a\n       PCE.  This allows the exact path of\
    \ the LSP to remain\n       confidential through the substitution of \"confidential\
    \ path\n       segments\" (CPSs) by these path keys.\n       [PCE-PATH-KEY] describes\
    \ how path keys can be used by PCEs to\n       preserve path confidentiality,\
    \ and [RSVP-PATH-KEY] explains how\n       path keys are used in signaling.  Note\
    \ that if path keys are\n       signaled in RSVP-TE EROs they must be expanded\
    \ so that the\n       signaling can proceed.  This expansion normally takes place\
    \ when\n       the first node in the CPS is reached.  The expansion of the path\n\
    \       key would normally be carried out by the PCE that generated the\n    \
    \   key, and for that reason, the path key contains an identifier of\n       the\
    \ PCE (the PCE-ID).\n     - LSP segment: LSP segments can be pre-established across\
    \ domains\n       according to some management policy.  The LSP segments can be\n\
    \       used to support end-to-end LSPs as hierarchical LSPs [RFC4206] or\n  \
    \     as LSP stitching segments [RFC5150].\n       The end-to-end LSPs are signaled\
    \ indicating just the series of\n       domains or domain border routers.  Upon\
    \ entry to each domain, an\n       existing trans-domain LSP is selected and used\
    \ to carry the end-\n       to-end LSP across the domain.\n       Note that although\

    \ be set up on demand on receipt of the\n       request for the end-to-end LSP\

    \ is applied at domain boundaries and that the path of\n       the LSP is not\
    \ reported in the RSVP-TE RRO.\n   These techniques may be applied directly or\
    \ may require protocol\n   extensions depending on the specific diverse LSP setup\

    \  To compute a disjoint path for the recovery LSP, each domain border\n   node\

    \ of path keys.\n       When the recovery LSP is signaled, the path keys can be\
    \ included\n       in the ERO as exclusions.  Each domain border router in turn\
    \ can\n       expand the path key for its domain and know which resources must\n\

    \     the expansion of the path key from the domain border router used\n     \
    \  by the working LSP, or from some third party such as a PCE.\n     - Instead\
    \ of using path keys, each confidential path segment in the\n       RRO of the\

    \ encrypted segments would appear as exclusions in\n       the ERO for the recovery\
    \ LSP and could be decrypted by the domain\n       border routers.\n       No\
    \ mechanism currently exists in RSVP-TE for this function, which\n       would\

    \ LSP\n       can be signaled with the identifier of the working LSP using the\n\
    \       Association Object [RFC4872] enabling the correct LSP segments to\n  \
    \     be selected.\n     - Path key: The path of the recovery LSP can be determined\
    \ and\n       returned to the head-end LSR just described in Section 4.4.2, but\n\
    \       each CPS is replaced by a path key.  As the recovery path is\n       signaled\
    \ each path key is expanded, domain-by-domain to achieve\n       the correct path.\
    \  This requires that the entity that computes\n       the path of the recovery\
    \ LSP (domain border LSR or PCE) is\n       stateful.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.4.1.  Sequential Path Computation\n   In sequential cooperative path computation,\
    \ the path of the working\n   LSP is determined first using a mechanism such as\
    \ BRPC.  Since domain\n   confidentiality is in use, the path returned may contain\
    \ path keys.\n   When the path of the recovery LSP is computed (which may be before\
    \ or\n   after the working LSP is signaled) the path exclusions supplied to\n\
    \   the PCE and exchanged between PCEs must use path keys as described in\n  \
    \ [PCEP-XRO].\n"

    \ path computation can be\n   requested using the PCEP SVEC Object [PCEP], and\
    \ BRPC could be\n   extended for inter-domain diverse path computation.  However,\
    \ to\n   conform to domain confidentiality requirements, path keys must be\n \
    \  used in the paths returned by the PCEs and signaled by RSVP-TE.\n   Note that\
    \ the LSP segment approach may not be applicable here because\n   a path cannot\
    \ be determined until BRPC procedures are completed.\n"
- title: 6.  Network Topology Specific Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Network Topology Specific Considerations\n   In some specific network topologies\
    \ the schemes for setting up\n   diverse LSPs could be significantly simplified.\n\
    \   For example, consider the L1VPN or GMPLS UNI case.  This may be\n   viewed\
    \ as a linear sequence of three domains where the first and last\n   domains contain\
    \ only a single node each.  In such a scenario, no BRPC\n   procedures are needed,\
    \ because there is no need for path computation\n   in the first and last domains\
    \ even if the source and destination\n   nodes are multi-homed.\n"
- title: 7.  Addressing Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Addressing Considerations\n   All of the schemes described in this document\
    \ are applicable when a\n   single address space is used across all domains.\n\
    \   There may also be cases where private address spaces are used within\n   some\
    \ of the domains.  This problem is similar to the use of domain\n   confidentiality\
    \ since the ERO and RRO are meaningless outside a\n   domain even if they are\
    \ available, and the problem can be solved\n   using the same techniques.\n"
- title: 8.  Note on SRLG Diversity
  contents:
  - "8.  Note on SRLG Diversity\n   The schemes described in this document are applicable\
    \ when the nodes\n   and links in different domains belong to different SRLGs,\
    \ which is\n   normally the case.\n   However, it is possible that nodes or links\
    \ in different domains\n   belong to the same SRLG.  That is, an SRLG may span\
    \ domain\n   boundaries.  In such cases, in order to establish SRLG diverse LSPs,\n\
    \   several considerations are needed:\n     - Record of the SRLGs used by the\
    \ working LSP.\n     - Indication of a set of SRLGs to exclude in the computation\
    \ of the\n       recovery LSP's path.\n   In this case, there is a conflict between\
    \ any requirement for domain\n   confidentiality, and the requirement for SRLG\
    \ diversity.  One of the\n   requirements must be compromised.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ SRLG IDs may be assigned independently in each domain,\n   and might not have\
    \ global meaning.  In such a scenario, some mapping\n   functions are necessary,\
    \ similar to the mapping of other TE\n   parameters mentioned in Section 1.2.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The core protocols used to achieve the procedures\
    \ described in this\n   document are RSVP-TE and PCEP.  These protocols include\
    \ policy and\n   authentication capabilities as described in [RFC3209] and [PCEP].\n\
    \   Furthermore, these protocols may be operated using more advanced\n   security\
    \ features such as IPsec [RFC4301] and TLS [RFC4346].\n   Security may be regarded\
    \ as particularly important in inter-domain\n   deployments and serious consideration\
    \ should be given to applying the\n   available security techniques, as described\
    \ in the documents\n   referenced above and as set out in [RFC4726].\n   Additional\
    \ discussion of security considerations for MPLG/GMPLS\n   networks can be found\
    \ in [SECURITY-FW].\n   This document does not of itself require additional security\
    \ measures\n   and does not modify the trust model implicit in the protocols used.\n\
    \   Note, however, that domain confidentiality (that is the\n   confidentiality\
    \ of the topology and path information from within any\n   one domain) is an important\
    \ consideration in this document, and a\n   significant number of the mechanisms\
    \ described in this document are\n   designed to preserve domain confidentiality.\n"
