  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path\n\
    \   computation in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled\n   by\
    \ Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS\n   (GMPLS).\n  \
    \ MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed from layered client/server\n   networks.\
    \  It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to\n   provide end-to-end\
    \ traffic engineering across multiple network\n   layers.  PCE is a candidate\
    \ solution for such requirements.\n   Generic requirements for a communication\
    \ protocol between Path\n   Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented\
    \ in RFC 4657, \"Path\n   Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic\n\
    \   Requirements\".  Generic requirements for a PCE discovery protocol are\n \
    \  presented in RFC 4674, \"Requirements for Path Computation Element\n   (PCE)\
    \ Discovery\".\n   This document complements the generic requirements and presents\n\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655]\
    \ is an entity\n   that is capable of computing a network path or route based\
    \ on a\n   network graph and applying computational constraints.\n   A network\
    \ may comprise multiple layers.  These layers may represent\n   the separation\
    \ of technologies (e.g., Packet Switch Capable (PSC),\n   Time Division Multiplex\
    \ (TDM), lambda switch capable (LSC)) into\n   GMPLS regions [RFC3945], the separation\
    \ of data plane switching\n   granularity levels (e.g., PSC-1 and PSC-2 or Virtual\
    \ Circuit 4 (VC4)\n   and VC12) into GMPLS layers [RFC5212], or a distinction\
    \ between\n   client and server networking roles (e.g., commercial or\n   administrative\
    \ separation of client and server networks).  In this\n   multi-layer network,\
    \ Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in lower layers are\n   used to carry upper-layer\
    \ LSPs.  The network topology formed by\n   lower-layer LSPs and advertised to\
    \ the higher layer is called a\n   \"Virtual Network Topology (VNT)\" [RFC5212].\n\
    \   In layered networks under the operation of Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching\
    \ Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\n   protocols, it\
    \ is important to provide mechanisms to allow global\n   optimization of network\
    \ resources.  That is, to take into account all\n   layers, rather than optimizing\
    \ resource utilization at each layer\n   independently.  This allows better network\
    \ efficiency to be achieved.\n   This is what we call \"inter-layer traffic engineering\"\
    .  This\n   includes mechanisms allowing computation of end-to-end paths across\n\
    \   layers (known as \"inter-layer path computation\") and mechanisms for\n  \
    \ control and management of the VNT by setting up and releasing LSPs in\n   the\
    \ lower layers [RFC5212].\n   Inter-layer traffic engineering is included in the\
    \ scope of the PCE\n   architecture [RFC4655], and PCE can provide a suitable\
    \ mechanism for\n   resolving inter-layer path computation issues.  The applicability\
    \ of\n   the PCE-based path computation architecture to inter-layer traffic\n\
    \   engineering is described in [RFC5623].\n   This document presents sets of\
    \ requirements for communication between\n   Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and\
    \ PCEs using the PCE Communication\n   Protocol (PCEP) and for PCE discovery for\
    \ inter-layer traffic\n   engineering.  It supplements the generic requirements\
    \ documented in\n   [RFC4657], [RFC4674], and the framework provided in [RFC5623].\n"

- title: 2.  Motivation for PCE-Based Inter-Layer Path Computation
  contents:
  - "2.  Motivation for PCE-Based Inter-Layer Path Computation\n   [RFC4206] defines\
    \ a way to signal an MPLS or a GMPLS LSP with an\n   explicit route in a higher\
    \ layer of a network that includes hops\n   traversed by LSPs in lower layers\
    \ of the network.  The computation of\n   end-to-end paths across layers is called\
    \ \"inter-layer path\n   computation\".\n   An LSR in the higher layer might not\
    \ have information on the topology\n   of lower layers, particularly in an overlay\
    \ or augmented model;\n   hence, it might not be able to compute an end-to-end\
    \ path across\n   layers.\n   PCE-based inter-layer path computation consists\
    \ of relying on one or\n   more PCEs to compute an end-to-end path across layers.\
    \  This could\n   rely on a single PCE path computation where the PCE has topology\n\
    \   information about multiple layers and can directly compute an end-to-\n  \
    \ end path across layers considering the topology of all of the layers.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ the inter-layer path computation could be performed as\n   a multiple PCE computation,\
    \ where each member of a set of PCEs has\n   information about the topology of\
    \ one or more layers, but not all\n   layers, and they collaborate to compute\
    \ an end-to-end path.\n   Consider a two-layer network where the higher-layer\
    \ network is a\n   packet-based IP/MPLS or GMPLS network and the lower-layer network\
    \ is\n   a GMPLS-controlled optical network.  An ingress LSR in the higher-\n\
    \   layer network tries to set up an LSP to an egress LSR also in the\n   higher-layer\
    \ network across the lower-layer network, and it needs a\n   path in the higher-layer\
    \ network.  However, suppose that there is no\n   TE link between border LSRs,\
    \ which are located on the boundary\n   between the higher-layer and lower-layer\
    \ networks, and that the\n   ingress LSR does not have topology visibility in\
    \ the lower layer.  If\n   a single-layer path computation is applied for the\
    \ higher layer, the\n   path computation fails.  On the other hand, inter-layer\
    \ path\n   computation is able to provide a route in the higher layer and a\n\
    \   suggestion that a lower-layer LSP be set up between border LSRs,\n   considering\
    \ both layers as TE topologies.\n   Further discussion of the application of PCE\
    \ to inter-layer path\n   computation can be found in [RFC5623].\n"

    \ default is that\n   inter-layer path computation is not allowed.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Control of the Type of Path to Be Computed
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Control of the Type of Path to Be Computed\n   The PCE computes and returns\
    \ a path to the PCC that the PCC can use\n   to build a higher-layer or lower-layer\
    \ LSP once converted to an\n   Explicit Route Object (ERO) for use in RSVP - Traffic\
    \ Engineering\n   (RSVP-TE) signaling.  There are two options [RFC5623].\n   -\
    \  Option 1: Mono-Layer Path.  The PCE computes a \"mono-layer\" path,\n     \
    \ i.e., a path that includes only TE links from the same layer.\n   -  Option\
    \ 2: Multi-Layer Path.  The PCE computes a \"multi-layer\"\n      path, i.e.,\
    \ a path that includes TE links from distinct layers\n      [RFC4206].\n   It\
    \ may be necessary or desirable for a PCC to control the type of\n   path that\
    \ is produced by a PCE.  For example, a PCC may know that it\n   is not possible,\
    \ for technological or policy reasons, to signal a\n   multi-layer path and that\
    \ a mono-layer path is required, or the PCC\n   may know that it does not wish\
    \ the layer border node to have control\n   of path computation.  In order to\
    \ make this level of control\n   possible, PCEP MUST allow the PCC to select the\
    \ path types to be\n   computed, and that may be returned, by choosing one or\
    \ more from the\n   following list:\n   -  A mono-layer path that is specified\
    \ by strict hop(s).  The path\n      may include virtual TE link(s).\n   -  A\
    \ mono-layer path that includes loose hop(s).\n   -  A multi-layer path that can\
    \ include the path (as strict or loose\n      hops) of one or more lower-layer\
    \ LSPs not yet established.\n   The path computation response from a PCE to a\
    \ PCC MUST report the\n   type of path computed, and where a multi-layer path\
    \ is returned, PCEP\n   MUST support the inclusion, as part of end-to-end path,\
    \ of the path\n   of the lower-layer LSPs to be established.\n   If a response\
    \ message from a PCE to PCC carries a mono-layer path\n   that is specified by\
    \ strict hops but includes virtual TE link(s),\n   includes loose hop(s), or carries\
    \ a multi-layer path that can include\n   the complete path of one or more lower-layer\
    \ LSPs not yet\n   established, the signaling of the higher-layer LSP may trigger\
    \ the\n   establishment of the lower-layer LSPs (triggered signaling).  The\n\
    \   triggered signaling may increase the higher-layer connection setup\n   latency.\
    \  An ingress LSR for the higher-layer LSP, or a PCC, needs to\n   know whether\
    \ or not triggered signaling is required.\n   A request from a PCC to a PCE MUST\
    \ allow indicating whether or not\n   triggered signaling is acceptable.\n   A\
    \ response from a PCE to a PCC MUST allow indicating whether or not\n   the computed\
    \ path requires triggered signaling.\n   Note that a PCE may not be able to distinguish\
    \ virtual TE links from\n   regular TE links.  In such cases, even if a request\
    \ from a PCC to a\n   PCE indicates that triggered signaling is not acceptable,\
    \ a PCE may\n   choose virtual TE links in path computation.  Therefore, when\
    \ a\n   network uses virtual TE links and a PCE is not able to distinguish\n \
    \  virtual TE links from regular TE links, a PCE MAY choose virtual TE\n   links\
    \ even if a request from a PCC to a PCE indicates triggered\n   signaling is not\
    \ acceptable.\n   Also, note that an ingress LSR of a higher-layer or lower-layer\
    \ LSP\n   may be present in multiple layers.  Thus, even when a mono-layer path\n\
    \   is requested or supplied, PCEP MUST be able to indicate the\n   required/provided\
    \ path layer.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Communication of Inter-Layer Constraints
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Communication of Inter-Layer Constraints\n   A request from a PCC to\
    \ a PCE MUST support the inclusion of\n   constraints for a multi-layer path.\
    \  This includes control over which\n   network layers may, must, or must not\
    \ be included in the computed\n   path.  Such control may be expressed in terms\
    \ of the switching types\n   of the layer networks.\n   Furthermore, it may be\
    \ desirable to constrain the number of layer\n   boundaries crossed (i.e., the\
    \ number of adaptations in the sense used\n   in [RFC5212] performed on the end-to-end\
    \ path), so PCEP SHOULD\n   include a constraint or objective function to minimize\
    \ or cap the\n   number of adaptations on a path and a mechanism to report that\
    \ number\n   when a path is supplied.\n   The path computation request MUST also\
    \ allow for different objective\n   functions to be applied within different network\
    \ layers.  For\n   example, the path in a packet-network may need to be optimized\

    \   that is being computed.  This will be particularly important where\n   the\

- title: 4.6.  Impact on Network Operation
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Impact on Network Operation\n   This section examines the impact on network\
    \ operations of the use of\n   a PCE for inter-layer traffic engineering.  It\
    \ does not present any\n   further requirements on the PCE or PCC, for the PCEP\
    \ or for\n   deployment.\n   The use of a PCE to compute inter-layer paths is\
    \ not expected to have\n   significant impact on network operations if the upper-layer\
    \ traffic\n   engineering practices are aware of the frequent changes that might\n\
    \   occur in the VNT.  It should also be noted that the introduction of\n   inter-layer\
    \ support to a PCE that already provides mono-layer path\n   computation might\
    \ change the loading of the PCE and that might have\n   an impact on the network\
    \ behavior especially during recovery periods\n   immediately after a network\
    \ failure.\n   On the other hand, it is envisioned that the use of inter-layer\
    \ path\n   computation will have significant benefits to the operation of a\n\
    \   multi-layer network including improving the network resource usage\n   and\
    \ enabling a greater number of higher-layer LSPs to be supported.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Inter-layer traffic engineering with PCE may\
    \ raise new security\n   issues when PCE-PCE communication is used between different\
    \ layer\n   networks for inter-layer path computation.  Security issues may also\n\
    \   exist when a single PCE is granted full visibility of TE information\n   that\
    \ applies to multiple layers.\n   The formal introduction of a VNT Manager component,\
    \ as described in\n   [RFC5623], provides the basis for the application of inter-layer\n\
    \   security and policy.\n   It is expected that solutions for inter-layer protocol\
    \ extensions\n   will address these issues in detail.\n"
