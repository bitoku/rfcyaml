Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a set of managed objects for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
based management of the Baseline Privacy Plus features of DOCSIS 1.1 and DOCSIS 2.0
(Data over Cable Service Interface Specification) compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This MIB module (BPI  MIB) provides a set of objects required for the management of the Baseline Privacy Interface Plus features of DOCSIS 1.1 and DOCSIS 2.0 Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS).
The specification is derived from the operational model described in the DOCSIS
Baseline Privacy Interface Plus Specification
DOCSIS Baseline Privacy Plus is composed of four distinct functional and manageable areas:  Key exchange and data encryption
Authentication of downloaded software images
This MIB module is an extension of the DOCSIS 1.0 Baseline Privacy MIB module [RFC3083] (BPI MIB), which is derived from the Operational model described in the DOCSIS Baseline Privacy Interface Specification [DOCSIS 1.0].
The original Baseline Privacy MIB structure has mostly been preserved in the Baseline Privacy Plus MIB.
Please note that the referenced DOCSIS specifications only require that Cable Modems process IPv4 customer traffic.
Design choices in this MIB module reflect those requirements.
Future versions of the DOCSIS specifications are expected to require support for IPv6 as well.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
This MIB module is structured into several tables and objects.
The docsBpi2CmBaseTable contains authorization key exchange information for one CM MAC interface.
The docsBpi2CmTEKTable contains traffic key exchange and data encryption information for a particular security association ID of the cable modem.
Multicast Encryption information is maintained under Docsbpi2CmMulticastObjects.
There is currently one multicast table object that manages IP multicast encryption, docsBpi2CmIpMulticastMapTable.
Digital certificates used for cable modem authentication are accessible via docsBpi2CmDeviceCertTable.
Cryptographic suite capabilities for a CM MAC are maintained in the docsBpi2CmCryptoSuiteTable.
The docsBpi2CmtsBaseTable contains default settings and summary counters for the cable modem termination system.
The DocsBpi2CmtsAuthTable contains Authorization Key Exchange information for each CM MAC interface, as well as data from CM certificates used in cable modem authentication.
The docsBpi2CmtsTEKTable contains traffic key exchange and data encryption information for a particular security association ID.
Multicast Encryption information is maintained under Docsbpi2CmtsMulticastObjects.
There are currently two multicast table objects.
The Table docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMapTable is specifically designed for IP multicast encryption, whereas docsBpi2CmtsMulticastAuthTable is meant to manage all multicast security associations.
In particular, the table docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMapTable defines the object docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMask, which could be a non contiguous netmask; this is why the object syntax is based on the INET ADDRESS MIB MIB Module [RFC4001] Textual Convention InetAddress instead of InetAddressPrefixLength.
This is to facilitate the assignment of same DOCSIS Security Association ID (SAID) to one or more IPv6 multicast group IDs matching one or more IPv6 multicast scope types within an entry in this table.
For example, multicast scopes labeled "unassigned" [RFC3513]
may be allocated by administrators to a particular SAID, regardless of their multicast scope; such mapping transient multicast group 'Y' to SAID 'z' for ANY multicast scope.
The non contiguous netmask will be FF10:Y. See [RFC3513] for details on IPv6 multicast addressing.
DocsBpi2CmtsCertObjects contains 2 manageable tables: one for provisioned cable modem certificates and one for certification authority certificates.
The docsBpi2CodeDownloadControl objects manage the authenticated software download process for a given device.
Relationship of BPI  and BPI MIB Modules
This section describes the relationship between the BPI
MIB module defined in this document and the BPI MIB module defined in RFC 3083 [RFC3083].
The BPI  protocol interface is an enhancement to the BPI protocol, and it is a distinct protocol from BPI.
The associated BPI  managed objects should be considered separate from the BPI MIB objects defined in RFC 3083.
1.1 and 2.0 systems implement both the BPI  and BPI protocols to be backward compatible with 1.0 systems.
For more information regarding the interoperability between BPI and BPI  compliant systems, refer to appendix C of the DOCSIS BPI  specification [DOCSIS].
For MIB modules requirements, refer to section 4.6.1, Figure 9, of the DOCSIS 1.1 OSSI specification [DOCSIS 1.1] and to section 7.6.1, Tables 7 9, of the DOCSIS 2.0 OSSI specification [DOCSIS 2.0].
BPI  MIB Module Relationship with the Interfaces Group MIB
The BPI  MIB module is the management framework of Baseline Privacy Plus Interface Specification [DOCSIS], which provides the MAC layer (Media Access Control) security services of DOCSIS through the Baseline Privacy Key Management (BPKM) protocol.
The BPI  MIB module objects are organized as extensions of the Radio Frequency (RF)
The MIB table structures of this MIB Module are extensions of the DOCSIS CATV (Community Antenna Television) MAC layer interface (DocsCableMaclayer by [IANA]).
In particular, the provisions of the Interface Group MIB [RFC2863] for counter discontinuities and system re
initialization apply to CM and CMTS to validate the difference between two consecutive counter polls.
All BPI  MIB module counters are 32 bits and are based on the minimum time to wrap up considerations of [RFC2863] and their possible frequency occurrence as BPI  FSM (Finite State Machine) event counters.
See [DOCSIS] for BPI  FSM parameter guidelines.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The following objects, if SNMP SET maliciously, could constitute denial of service or theft of service attacks or compromise the intended data privacy of users:
Objects related to the Baseline Privacy Key Management (BPKM) docsBpi2CmAuthReset, docsBpi2CmtsAuthCmReset, docsBpi2CmtsTEKReset:
These objects are used for initiating a re key process.
A malicious massive SET attack may cause CMTS processing overload and may compromise the service.
docsBpi2CmtsDefaultAuthLifetime, docsBpi2CmtsDefaultTEKLifetime, docsBpi2CmtsAuthCmLifetime, docsBpi2CmtsTEKLifetime: To minimize the risk of malicious or unintended short periods of time when key updates may lead to degradation or denial of service, implementers are encouraged to follow these objects' range constraints, as defined in the docsBpi2CmtsCompliance MODULE COMPLIANCE clause for operational deployments.
A malicious SET in a self signed certificate as reject message, which may constitute denial of service.
This object is designed for testing purposes; therefore, it is not RECOMMENDED for use in commercial deployments [DOCSIS].
Administrators can make use of View based Access Control (VACM) introduced in section 7.9 of [RFC3410] to restrict write access to this object.
A malicious SET in this object that enables the period validity and a wrong clock time in the CMTS could cause denial of service, as CM authorization requests will be rejected.
For more details in the validation of CM certificates, refer to section 9 of [DOCSIS] .
Objects related to the CM only: Objects in docsBpi2CmDeviceCertTable docsBpi2CmDeviceCmCert:
This object is not harmful, considering that a CM received a Certificate during the manufacturing process.
Therefore, the object access becomes read only.
See the object DESCRIPTION clause in section 3 for details.
Objects for Secure Software Download in table docsBpi2CodeDownloadControl:
A malicious SET on this object may not constitute a risk, since the CM holds the DOCSIS root key to verify the CVC authenticity.
The operator, if configured, could receive a notification for event occurrences, which may lead to detecting the source of the attack.
Moreover, [DOCSIS] recommends that CMs CVC be regularly updated to minimize the risk of potential code signing keys being compromised (e.g., by configuration file).
Objects related to the CMTS only: Objects in docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCertTable and docsBpi2CmtsCACertTable containing CM Certificates and Certificate Authority information, respectively: docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCertTrust, docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCertStatus, docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCert, docsBpi2CmtsCACertStatus, docsBpi2CmtsCACert:
A malicious SET on these objects may constitute a denial of service attack that will be experienced after the CMs perform authorization requests.
It does not affect CMs in the authorized state.
Objects in multicast tables docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMapTable and docsBpi2CmtsMulticastAuthTable: docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastAddressType, docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastAddress, docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMaskType, docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastMask, docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastSAId, docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastSAType: Malicious SET on these objects may cause misconfiguration, causing interruption of the users' active multicast applications.
docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastDataEncryptAlg, docsBpi2CmtsIpMulticastDataAuthentAlg: Malicious SETs on these objects may create service misconfiguration, causing service interruption or theft of service if encryption algorithms are removed for the multicast groups.
Malicious SETs on these objects may remove and/or disable customers and/or multicast groups, causing service disruption.
This may also constitute theft of service by authorizing non  subscribed users to multicast groups or by adding other multicast groups in the forward path.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
Objects in docsBpi2CmBaseTable, docsBpi2CmTEKTable, docsBpi2CmtsBaseTable, docsBpi2CmtsAuthTable, docsBpi2CmtsTEKTable, docsBpi2CmtsProvisionedCmCertTable, and docsBpi2CmtsCACertTable: If this information is accessible, attackers may use it to distinguish users configured to work without data encryption (e.g., docsBpi2CmPrivacyEnable) and to know current Baseline Privacy parameters in the network.
Objects in docsBpi2CmIpMulticastMapTable and docsBpi2CmtsMulticastAuthTable: In addition to the vulnerabilities around BPI plus multicast objects described in the previous part, the read only objects of this table may help attackers monitor the status of the intrusion.
In addition to the vulnerability of the read write object docsBpi2CodeCvcUpdate, attackers may be able to monitor the status of a denial of service using Secure Software Download.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The BPI  Traffic Encryption Keys (TEK) defined in the DOCSIS BPI  specification [DOCSIS] use 40 bit or 56 bit DES for encryption
Currently, there is no mechanism or algorithm defined for data integrity.
Due to the DES cryptographic weaknesses, future revisions of the DOCSIS BPI  specification should introduce more advanced encryption algorithms, as proposed in the DocsBpkmDataEncryptAlg textual convention, to overcome the progress in cheaper and faster hardware or software decryption tools.
Future revisions of the DOCSIS BPI  specification [DOCSIS] should also adopt authentication algorithms, as described in the DocsBpkmDataAuthentAlg textual convention.
It is important to note that frequent key changes do not necessarily help in mitigating or reducing the risks of a DES attack.
Indeed, the traffic encryption keys, which are configured on a per cable modem basis and per BPI  multicast group, can be utilized to decrypt old traffic, even when they are no longer in active use.
Note that, not exempt to the same recommendations above,
the CM BPI  authorization protocol uses triple DES encryption, which offers improved robustness in comparison to DES for CM authorization and TEK
