  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   While the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP),\
    \ as\n   specified in [XMPP-CORE] and [XMPP-IM], provides basic messaging and\n\
    \   presence functionality, the fact that XMPP is at root a technology\n   for\
    \ streaming Extensible Markup Language [XML] data makes it possible\n   to include\
    \ virtually any structured information within XMPP, as long\n   as such information\
    \ is qualified by appropriate XML namespaces\n   [XML-NAMES].  When sent over\
    \ XMPP, such structured data formats and\n   protocols are generally referred\
    \ to as \"XMPP extensions\".\n   A large number of such XMPP extensions exist.\
    \  The main standards\n   development organization in which such extensions are\
    \ defined is the\n   XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) (formerly the Jabber Software\n\
    \   Foundation), which contributed XMPP to the Internet Standards\n   process.\
    \  Typically, such extensions are defined within the XSF's\n   XMPP Extension\
    \ Protocol (XEP) specification series.  To date, the XML\n   namespaces defined\
    \ within the Jabber/XMPP community have used names\n   of the form \"jabber:*\"\
    \ (deprecated since early 2002) and\n   \"http://jabber.org/protocol/*\" (not\
    \ including names of the form\n   \"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-*\" specified\
    \ in the XMPP RFCs).\n   However, it is desirable that names associated with future\
    \ XMPP\n   extensions be both unique and persistent, which is not necessarily\n\
    \   the case with names that are also HTTP URLs.  Therefore, in\n   accordance\
    \ with the process defined in [MECHANISMS], this document\n   registers a formal\
    \ namespace identifier (NID) for Uniform Resource\n   Names [URN] associated with\
    \ XMPP extensions published in the XSF's\n   XEP series and for XML namespaces\
    \ registered with the XSF's XMPP\n   Registrar function [REGISTRAR].\n"

    \ is requested.\n   Registration Information:\n      Version 1\n      Date: 2007-04-27\n\

    \       Organization: XMPP Standards Foundation\n         Address: P.O. Box 1641,\
    \ Denver, CO 80201 USA\n      Designated contact\n         Role: XMPP Registrar\n\
    \         Email: registrar@xmpp.org\n   Declaration of Syntactic Structure:\n\
    \      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the\n      \"\
    xmpp\" NID shall have the following structure:\n         urn:xmpp:{ShortName}:{SubName}\n\
    \      The keywords have the following meaning:\n         (1) the \"ShortName\"\
    \ is a required US-ASCII string that\n         conforms to the URN syntax requirements\
    \ (see RFC 2141)\n         and defines a particular protocol or format that is\
    \ used\n         as an XMPP extension.\n         (2) the \"SubName\" is an optional\
    \ US-ASCII string that\n         conforms to the URN syntax requirements (see\
    \ RFC 2141)\n         and defines a particular subset of the relevant protocol\n\
    \         or format.\n      The XSF's XMPP Registrar function shall be responsible\
    \ for\n      managing the assignment of both \"ShortName\" and \"SubName\"\n \
    \     strings and maintaining a registry of resulting namespaces\n      at <http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/namespaces.html>.\
    \  The\n      XMPP Registrar may also assign URNs in sub-trees below the\n   \
    \   level of the ShortName or SubName as needed for use in various\n      XMPP\
    \ extensions.\n   Relevant Ancillary Documentation:\n      Information about the\
    \ XSF's XMPP Registrar function can be\n      found at <http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0053.html>\n\
    \      and <http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/>.\n   Identifier Uniqueness Considerations:\n\
    \      The XMPP Registrar is already responsible for managing\n      the assignment\
    \ of XML namespace names of the form\n      \"http://jabber.org/protocol/{ShortName}\"\
    \ and\n      \"http://jabber.org/protocol/{ShortName}#{SubName}\"\n      (e.g.,\
    \ \"http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub\" and\n      \"http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info\"\
    ).  In order to\n      assign namespace names in the context of the \"xmpp\"\n\
    \      NID, the XMPP Registrar shall simply modify the syntax\n      of the namespace\
    \ names it assigns from\n      \"http://jabber.org/protocol/{ShortName}\" and\n\
    \      \"http://jabber.org/protocol/{ShortName}#{SubName}\" to\n      \"urn:xmpp:{ShortName}\"\
    \ and \"urn:xmpp:{ShortName}:{SubName}\".\n      The XMPP Registrar shall ensure\
    \ the uniqueness of all\n      XMPP URNs by checking such names against the list\
    \ of\n      existing namespace names, as documented in XEP-0053\n      (the controlling\
    \ specification for the XMPP Registrar\n      function).  The XMPP Registrar shall,\
    \ in all cases, directly\n      ensure the uniqueness of the assigned strings\
    \ and shall\n      not assign secondary responsibility for management of any\n\
    \      sub-trees.  However, the XMPP Registrar may assign URNs\n      in sub-trees\
    \ below the level of the ShortName or SubName\n      as needed for use in various\
    \ XMPP extensions.  The\n      resulting URNs shall not be re-assigned.\n   Identifier\
    \ Persistence Considerations:\n      The XMPP Registrar shall provide clear documentation\
    \ of\n      the registered uses of the \"xmpp\" NID in the form of\n      XMPP\
    \ Extension Protocol (XEP) specifications published\n      at <http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/>,\
    \ as well as a\n      registry of the namespace names themselves at\n      <http://www.xmpp.org/registrar/namespaces.html>.\n\
    \   Process of Identifier Assignment:\n      The XMPP Registrar's processes and\
    \ procedures for\n      identifier assignment are documented in XEP-0053,\n  \
    \    which is the controlling specification for the XMPP\n      Registrar function.\
    \  In particular, identifiers shall\n      be issued only upon advancement of\
    \ the relevant protocol\n      specification to a status of Draft within the standards\n\
    \      process, followed by the XMPP Standards Foundation (as\n      specified\
    \ in XEP-0001).  The XMPP Registrar shall check\n      all identifiers against\
    \ the list of existing namespace\n      names to ensure uniqueness and to encourage\
    \ relevance\n      and memorability.  Assignment of URNs within the \"xmpp\"\n\
    \      tree is reserved to the XMPP Standards Foundation,\n      specifically\
    \ to its XMPP Registrar function.\n   Process for Identifier Resolution:\n   \
    \   The namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution\n      Discovery System\
    \ (RDS), but nothing about the namespace\n      prohibits the future definition\
    \ of appropriate resolution\n      methods or listing with an RDS.\n   Rules for\
    \ Lexical Equivalence:\n      No special considerations; the rules for lexical\n\
    \      equivalence specified in RFC 2141 apply.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n\
    \      No special considerations.\n   Validation Mechanism:\n      None specified.\n\
    \   Scope:\n      Global.\n"
- title: 3.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Namespace Considerations\n   The XMPP Standards Foundation has been developing\
    \ Internet protocols\n   since August 2001 and that work is expected to continue\
    \ for the\n   foreseeable future.  The old-style \"jabber:*\" namespace names\n\
    \   originally used in the Jabber open-source community were not proper\n   URNs\
    \ or URIs and thus were deprecated in early 2002.  Since then, the\n   namespace\
    \ names assigned by the XMPP Registrar function of the XMPP\n   Standards Foundation\
    \ have been (equivalent to) specialized HTTP URLs\n   whose authority component\
    \ is \"jabber.org\".  While that domain is\n   currently under the control of\
    \ the XMPP Standards Foundation, there\n   is no guarantee that it will always\
    \ remain so, thus potentially\n   threatening the reliability and permanence of\
    \ the assigned namespace\n   names.  The use of Uniform Resource Names with an\
    \ appropriate\n   Namespace ID will enable the XMPP Standards Foundation to assign\n\
    \   cleaner, more general, more permanent, more reliable, and more\n   controllable\
    \ namespace names related to the XMPP extensions it\n   defines, while keeping\
    \ the tree of XMPP extensions produced by the\n   XMPP Standards Foundation properly\
    \ separate from the IETF tree used\n   to define some of the core XMPP namespaces\
    \ as well as namespaces\n   related to XMPP extensions that may be produced in\
    \ the future by the\n   IETF.\n"
- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   The XMPP standards development community will\
    \ benefit from\n   publication of this namespace by having more permanent and\
    \ reliable\n   names for the XML namespaces defined in XMPP Extension Protocol\n\
    \   specifications produced by the XMPP Standards Foundation.\n   The standards\
    \ process followed by the XSF is open to contributions\n   from any interested\
    \ individual; such a contribution takes the form of\n   a proposal submitted to\
    \ the XMPP Extensions Editor\n   <mailto:editor@xmpp.org>, accepted by the XMPP\
    \ Council\n   <http://www.xmpp.org/council/>, and published in the XSF's XMPP\n\
    \   Extension Protocol (XEP) series at <http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/>.\n  \
    \ Use of the proposed space for a particular XML format or protocol\n   extension\
    \ will be contingent upon advancement of the appropriate\n   specification within\
    \ the XSF's standards process (as documented in\n   [XEP]) and issuance of a namespace\
    \ name within the \"xmpp\" tree by the\n   XMPP Registrar (as documented in [REGISTRAR]).\n"
