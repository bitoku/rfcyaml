  - "Abstract\n   To allow connectivity between the general switched telephone network\n\
    \   facsimile service (GSTN fax) and the e-mail-based Internet Fax\n   service\
    \ (i-fax), an \"Internet Fax Gateway\" is required.  This\n   document provides\
    \ guidelines for the optional functionality of\n   Internet Fax Gateways.  In\
    \ this context, an \"offramp gateway\"\n   provides facsimile data transmission\
    \ from i-fax to GSTN fax; vice\n   versa, an \"onramp gateway\" provides data\
    \ transmission from GSTN fax\n   to i-fax.  The recommendations in this document\
    \ apply to the\n   integrated service including Internet Fax terminals, computers\
    \ with\n   i-fax software on the Internet, and GSTN fax terminals on the GSTN.\n\
    \   This document supplements the recommendation for minimal features of\n   an\
    \ Internet Fax Gateway.  In particular, it covers techniques for\n   dropping\
    \ duplicated fax messages, automatic fax re-transmission,\n   error, return notice,\
    \ and log handling, and possible authorization\n   methods by DTMF (Dual Tone\
    \ Multi-Frequency) for onramp gateways.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   An Internet Fax Gateway can be classified as either an offramp\n\
    \   gateway or an onramp gateway.  This document provides guidelines for\n   optional\
    \ services and examples of Internet Fax Gateway operations.\n   In particular,\
    \ it covers techniques for dropping duplicated fax\n   messages, automatic fax\
    \ re-transmission, error, return notice, and\n   log handling, and possible authorization\
    \ methods by DTMF (Dual Tone\n   Multi-Frequency) for onramp gateways.\n   A more\
    \ detailed definition of onramps and offramps is provided in\n   [1].  Recommended\
    \ behaviors for Internet Fax Gateway functions are\n   defined in [15].\n   This\
    \ document provides recommendations only for the specific cases\n   hereunder:\n\
    \   1) the operational mode of the Internet Fax is \"store and forward\",\n  \
    \    as defined in Section 2.5 of [1].\n   2) The format of image data is the\
    \ data format defined by \"simple\n      mode\" in [16].\n   This document does\
    \ not apply to the gateway functions for \"real-time\n   Internet Fax\", as described\
    \ and defined in [18].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Drop Duplicated GSTN Fax Transmission\n   Electronic mail transport agents\
    \ (MTA) deliver an Internet Fax\n   message into either the recipient's mailbox\
    \ or an offramp gateway\n   mailbox.  Hence, the message is retrieved for further\
    \ action, which\n   in the case of the offramp gateway, will result in its delivery\
    \ to\n   the GSTN fax service.\n   The offramp gateway mailbox will thus receive\
    \ all messages which the\n   gateway will process, regardless of their final,\
    \ distinct GSTN\n   destinations.  As such, addresses like\n      Fax=+12224567654@example.com\n\
    \      Fax=+38155234578@example.com\n      Fax=+3904567437777@example.com\n  \
    \ will all end up in the offramp gateway mailbox corresponding to the\n   \"example.com\"\
    \ domain.\n   However, the handling of e-mail messages (including those of Internet\n\
    \   Faxes) that contain more than one recipient, but are directed to the\n   same\
    \ final MTA, can be different, depending on the MTA configuration\n   or features.\
    \  A single message with multiple recipients in the SMTP\n   envelope [19] is\
    \ likely to be the most common case on the mail\n   transport system, but it may\
    \ happen that multiple copies of the same\n   message are transmitted, one per\
    \ recipient.  Or it may happen that\n   the final MTA is set to deliver a separate\
    \ copy of the message per\n   recipient into the final mailbox, supposing it is\
    \ delivering messages\n   to real mailboxes of distinct endusers.\n   Thus, it\
    \ may happen that the offramp gateway receives multiple copies\n   of the same\
    \ Internet Fax message that is to be delivered to different\n   GSTN destinations,\
    \ which are listed together and repeatedly in the\n   e-mail message headers [20]\
    \ of the Internet Fax.  In such cases, the\n   offramp gateway SHOULD implement\
    \ techniques to avoid duplicate or\n   multiple transmission over GSTN of the\
    \ same fax message to the same\n   recipient.\n   Here are some possible, but\
    \ non-exclusive, examples of these\n   techniques.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  SMTP Envelope Addresses Check
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  SMTP Envelope Addresses Check\n   Using the SMTP [19] envelope destination\
    \ address given in the \"RCPT\n   TO\" field is usually the best technique to\
    \ ensure that a received\n   message is delivered to that address, and to avoid\
    \ duplicate\n   deliveries.\n   If the offramp gateway has the \"RCPT TO\" information\
    \ still available\n   during processing, then it MUST use it to determine the\
    \ recipients\n   over GSTN fax service.\n"
- title: 2.1.2 Message-ID Check
  contents:
  - "2.1.2 Message-ID Check\n   If the SMTP \"RCPT TO\" information is not available\
    \ (for example, in\n   the case where the offramp gateway retrieves messages from\
    \ its\n   mailbox using either POP [21] or IMAP [22]), the message header\n  \
    \ \"Message-ID\" (see [20]) MAY be used to check if a message has already\n  \
    \ been processed, and hence avoid retransmission to all its GSTN\n   recipients\
    \ handled by the offramp gateway.\n"

    '
- title: 2.2.1.  Recoverable Errors
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Recoverable Errors\n   Recoverable errors that happen during GSTN transmission\
    \ are those\n   where there is good chance that the error may not occur at the\
    \ next\n   attempt.  This category includes \"busy signal\", \"no line/carrier\n\
    \   signal\", etc.\n   For all these errors, the offramp gateway SHOULD re-queue\
    \ the message\n   and perform a retransmission attempt later on, as specified\
    \ in\n   Section 2.3.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Non-Recoverable Errors
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Non-Recoverable Errors\n   If the error that occurs during GSTN transmission\
    \ is likely non-\n   recoverable, the offramp gateway SHOULD NOT attempt retransmission,\n\
    \   and an error Message Delivery Notification (MDN) with appropriate\n   error\
    \ codes MUST be generated for the Internet Fax message sender.\n   Examples of\
    \ non-recoverable errors include paper-related errors (such\n   as a jam, an empty\
    \ tray, etc.) at a remote device, no response from a\n   remote destination, voice\
    \ response errors, data modem response\n   errors, and stop event errors.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Automatic Re-Transmission Handling
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Automatic Re-Transmission Handling\n   An offramp gateway SHOULD implement\
    \ a function that automatically\n   tries to send facsimile data again if recoverable\
    \ delivery failure\n   occurs.  If this function is implemented, then:\n   - the\
    \ retry times and retry interval MAY be specified as options by\n     the administrator\
    \ of the offramp gateway;\n   - any error return notice SHOULD be sent only when\
    \ the maximum number\n     of retries has been completed without success;\n  \
    \ - if transmission is suspended due to an error, then the subsequent\n     transmission\
    \ attempt SHOULD avoid retransmitting the pages already\n     delivered successfully,\
    \ if any.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Multiple Return Notice Handling
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Multiple Return Notice Handling\n   An offramp gateway can receive an Internet\
    \ Fax for delivery to\n   multiple GSTN recipients.  If errors occur, which require\
    \ the\n   Internet Fax sender to be informed about them, or if the Internet Fax\n\
    \   sender requested delivery notifications, then the offramp gateway has\n  \
    \ various ways to handle these multiple return notices:\n   1) An offramp gateway\
    \ sends a return notice as soon as an error or a\n      successful delivery occurs,\
    \ per single GSTN recipient.\n   2) An offramp gateway gathers all information\
    \ about the message, but\n      sends a return notice only after all or a number\
    \ of GSTN\n      recipients have been handled (successfully or not).\n   If Case\
    \ 2 is implemented, then the offramp gateway MAY also choose to\n   send separate\
    \ success and failure notices, or to limit the number of\n   GSTN recipients handled\
    \ per single return note (for example, no more\n   than 10 recipients per return\
    \ note).\n"
- title: 2.5.  Handling Transmission Errors for a Return Notice
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Handling Transmission Errors for a Return Notice\n   When an offramp gateway\
    \ fails in the transmission of a return notice,\n   the Internet Fax Gateway SHOULD\
    \ process the notice in either of the\n   following ways:\n   1) The return notices\
    \ SHOULD be re-queued, and delivery retried\n      later.  The number of retry\
    \ attempts and the time interval between\n      them MAY be a feature configured\
    \ by the offramp gateway\n      administrator.  This is the preferred method to\
    \ implement;\n      however, if all the retransmission attempts fail, processing\n\
    \      SHOULD continue as in Case 2.\n   2) If the gateway does not have enough\
    \ capabilities to handle notice\n      re-queuing, but has a log information preservation\
    \ function, the\n      error information SHOULD be recorded to a log, and processing\n\
    \      SHOULD end.  At this time, the administrator of the gateway system\n  \
    \    SHOULD be notified of these errors using a specific method (for\n      example,\
    \ by an e-mail message).\n   3) If the gateway does not even have a log information\
    \ preservation\n      function, the administrator SHOULD be notified about the\
    \ failure\n      (for example, via an e-mail message), and processing SHOULD end.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.6.  Offramp Gateway Log\n   An offramp gateway SHOULD have a function that\
    \ keeps information\n   listed as a log, either specific to the fax gateway or\
    \ in a log file\n   that exists locally on the gateway or remotely.  If the fax\
    \ gateway\n   or the remote system are equipped with recording media, the log\n\
    \   information SHOULD be saved as a log file.  As a last resort, if no\n   recording\
    \ media are available, the log MAY be printed.\n   The information listed in the\
    \ log MAY be the following:\n   - Date and time when the Internet Fax is received\n\
    \   - Sender address\n   - Recipient address(es)\n   - Start date and time of\

- title: 3.1.  Examples of User Authorization
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Examples of User Authorization\n   An onramp gateway MAY have a user authorization\
    \ function to confirm\n   that the user is authorized to transmit a facsimile\
    \ into the Internet\n   fax service.  For example, user authorization may be accomplished\
    \ by\n   getting a user ID and password received by DTMF, or via a local\n   authorization\
    \ table based on the GSTN caller-ID.  The following\n   subsections give some\
    \ possible examples, but other methods are also\n   possible.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Authorization via GSTN Caller-ID
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Authorization via GSTN Caller-ID\n   The most simple method to authenticate\
    \ and authorize a GSTN fax\n   service user is to use the GSTN caller-ID.  If\
    \ available, in fact,\n   the caller-ID is generated by the GSTN network service\
    \ itself, and it\n   is quite difficult to produce fake caller-IDs.  In other\
    \ words, the\n   security related to this authentication method relies on the\n\
    \   confidence that the GSTN caller-ID service is secure by itself.\n   The GSTN\
    \ sender MAY be authorized via a lookup into a table managed\n   by the onramp\
    \ gateway administrator, via complete or partial\n   (wildcard) matches.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Authorization via GSTN Fax "Station ID"
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Authorization via GSTN Fax \"Station ID\"\n   During the initial GSTN\
    \ fax service negotiation, the sender fax can\n   send various information to\
    \ the onramp gateway, including the\n   \"station ID\" alphanumeric string.  This\
    \ string MAY be used to\n   transmit authentication and authorization information\
    \ for subsequent\n   lookup by the onramp gateway.  Thus, user ID and an eventual\
    \ password\n   MAY be sent inside this string.\n   However, if used as the only\
    \ authentication, this method is much less\n   secure than the caller-ID one because\
    \ the user of the calling GSTN\n   station can decide which string to send, and\
    \ the string travels in\n   clear form over the GSTN.  Given this security warning,\
    \ this method\n   allows more flexibility to the GSTN user: in fact, it is not\
    \ tied to\n   a single GSTN fax terminal, and authorization can be obtained from\n\
    \   anywhere, provided the sender has the possibility to configure the\n   \"\
    station ID\" on the device being used.\n   A combination of caller-ID and station\
    \ ID checks MAY, on the other\n   hand, result in a greatly improved level of\
    \ security.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Authorization via DTMF
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Authorization via DTMF\n   An onramp gateway MAY implement the Authorization\
    \ function by\n   requesting that a user ID and password information are sent\
    \ over GSTN\n   via DTMF.  For example, this function MAY be accomplished by\n\
    \   requesting that the DTMF information is sent immediately after the\n   connection\
    \ over GSTN is established, before starting the GSTN fax\n   negotiation; but\
    \ other methods are also possible.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Refer to Section 3.1 (\"User Authorization\"\
    ) for authentication for an\n   onramp gateway.  In particular, sending user IDs\
    \ and passwords in\n   clear, as described in Section 3.1.2, can pose high security\
    \ risks,\n   and thus is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   S/MIME [2][11][12][13][14] and OpenPGP\
    \ [3][10] can also be used to\n   encrypt an Internet Fax message.  A signed or\
    \ encrypted message is\n   protected while transported along the network; however,\
    \ when a\n   message reaches an Internet Fax Gateway, either onramp or offramp,\n\
    \   this kind of protection cannot be applied anymore.  In this\n   situation,\
    \ security must rely on trusted operations of the gateway\n   itself.  A gateway\
    \ might have its own certificate/key to improve\n   security operations when sending\
    \ Internet Faxes, but, as with any\n   gateway, it breaks the end-to-end security\
    \ pattern of both S/MIME and\n   OpenPGP.\n   Other security mechanisms, like\
    \ IPsec [4][5][6][7][8] or TLS [9] also\n   do not ensure a secure gateway operation.\n\
