  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an application of Segment Routing to scale\n\
    \   the network to support hundreds of thousands of network nodes, and\n   tens\
    \ of millions of physical underlay endpoints.  This use case can\n   be applied\
    \ to the interconnection of massive-scale Data Centers (DCs)\n   and/or large\
    \ aggregation networks.  Forwarding tables of midpoint and\n   leaf nodes only\
    \ require a few tens of thousands of entries.  This may\n   be achieved by the\
    \ inherently scaleable nature of Segment Routing and\n   the design proposed in\
    \ this document.\n"

    \ Global Block (SRGB) is used\n      throughout the domains (e.g., 16000-23999).\n\
    \   o  Unique SRGB sub-ranges are allocated to each metro (M) and core\n     \

- title: 4.  Control Plane
  contents:
  - "4.  Control Plane\n   This section provides a high-level description of how a\
    \ control plane\n   could be implemented using protocol components already defined\
    \ in\n   other RFCs.\n   The mechanism through which SRTE Policies are defined,\
    \ computed, and\n   programmed in the source nodes is outside the scope of this\
    \ document.\n   Typically, a controller or a service orchestration system programs\n\
    \   node A with a PW to a remote next-hop node Z with a given SLA\n   contract\
    \ (e.g., low-latency path, disjointness from a specific core\n   plane, disjointness\
    \ from a different PW service).\n   Node A automatically detects that node Z is\
    \ not reachable.  It then\n   automatically sends a PCEP request to an SR PCE\
    \ for an SRTE policy\n   that provides reachability information for node Z with\
    \ the\n   requested SLA.\n   The SR PCE [RFC4655] is made of two components: a\
    \ multi-domain\n   topology and a computation engine.  The multi-domain topology\
    \ is\n   continuously refreshed through BGP - Link State (BGP-LS) feeds\n   [RFC7752]\
    \ from each domain.  The computation engine is designed to\n   implement TE algorithms\
    \ and provide output in SR Path format.  Upon\n   receiving the PCEP request [RFC5440],\
    \ the SR PCE computes the\n   requested path.  The path is expressed through a\
    \ list of segments\n   (e.g., {16003, 18006, 20001}) and provided to node A.\n\
    \   The SR PCE logs the request as a stateful query and hence is able to\n   recompute\
    \ the path at each network topology change.\n   Node A receives the PCEP reply\
    \ with the path (expressed as a segment\n   list).  Node A installs the received\
    \ SRTE policy in the data plane.\n   Node A then automatically steers the PW into\
    \ that SRTE policy.\n"
- title: 5.  Illustration of the Scale
  contents:
  - "5.  Illustration of the Scale\n   According to the reference topology shown in\
    \ Figure 1, the following\n   assumptions are made:\n   o  There is one core domain,\
    \ and there are 100 leaf (metro) domains.\n   o  The core domain includes 200\
    \ nodes.\n   o  Two nodes connect each leaf (metro) domain.  Each node connecting\n\
    \      a leaf domain has a SID allocated.  Each pair of nodes connecting\n   \
    \   a leaf domain also has a common anycast SID.  This yields up to\n      300\
    \ prefix segments in total.\n   o  A core node connects only one leaf domain.\n\
    \   o  Each leaf domain has 6,000 leaf-node segments.  Each leaf node has\n  \
    \    500 endpoints attached and thus 500 adjacency segments.  This\n      yields\
    \ a total of 3 million endpoints for a leaf domain.\n   Based on the above, the\
    \ network scaling numbers are as follows:\n   o  6,000 leaf-node segments multiplied\
    \ by 100 leaf domains:\n      600,000 nodes.\n   o  600,000 nodes multiplied by\
    \ 500 endpoints: 300 million endpoints.\n   The node scaling numbers are as follows:\n\
    \   o  Leaf-node segment scale: 6,000 leaf-node segments + 300 core-node\n   \
    \   segments + 500 adjacency segments = 6,800 segments.\n   o  Core-node segment\
    \ scale: 6,000 leaf-domain segments +\n      300 core-domain segments = 6,300\
    \ segments.\n   In the above calculations, the link-adjacency segments are not\
    \ taken\n   into account.  These are local segments and, typically, less than\
    \ 100\n   per node.\n   It has to be noted that, depending on leaf-node FIB capabilities,\n\
    \   leaf domains could be split into multiple smaller domains.  In the\n   above\
    \ example, the leaf domains could be split into six smaller\n   domains so that\
    \ each leaf node only needs to learn 1,000 leaf-node\n   segments + 300 core-node\
    \ segments + 500 adjacency segments, yielding\n   a total of 1,800 segments.\n"
- title: 6.  Design Options
  contents:
  - "6.  Design Options\n   This section describes multiple design options to illustrate\
    \ scale as\n   described in the previous section.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB) Size
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB) Size\n   In the simplified illustrations\
    \ in this document, we picked a small\n   homogeneous SRGB range of 16000-23999.\
    \  In practice, a large-scale\n   design would use a bigger range, such as 16000-80000\
    \ or even larger.\n   A larger range provides allocations for various TE applications\n\
    \   within a given domain.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Redistribution of Routes for Agg Nodes
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Redistribution of Routes for Agg Nodes\n   The operator might choose to\
    \ not redistribute the routes for Agg\n   nodes into the Metro/DC domains.  In\
    \ that case, more segments are\n   required in order to express an inter-domain\
    \ path.\n   For example, node A would use an SRTE Policy {DCI1, Agg1, Agg3,\n\
    \   DCI3, Z} in order to reach Z instead of {Agg3, DCI3, Z} in the\n   reference\
    \ design.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Sizing and Hierarchy
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Sizing and Hierarchy\n   The operator is free to choose among a small number\
    \ of larger leaf\n   domains, a large number of small leaf domains, or a mix of\
    \ small and\n   large core/leaf domains.\n   The operator is free to use a two-tier\
    \ (Core/Metro) or three-tier\n   (Core/Metro/DC) design.\n"
- title: 6.4.  Local Segments to Hosts/Servers
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Local Segments to Hosts/Servers\n   Local segments can be programmed at\
    \ any leaf node (e.g., node Z) in\n   order to identify locally attached hosts\
    \ (or Virtual Machines (VMs)).\n   For example, if node Z has bound a local segment\
    \ 40001 to a local\n   host ZH1, then node A uses the following SRTE Policy in\
    \ order to\n   reach that host: {16006, 18006, 20001, 40001}.  Such a local segment\n\
    \   could represent the NID (Network Interface Device) in the context of\n   the\
    \ service provider access network, or a VM in the context of the DC\n   network.\n"
- title: 6.5.  Compressed SRTE Policies
  contents:
  - "6.5.  Compressed SRTE Policies\n   As an example and according to Section 3,\
    \ we assume that node A can\n   reach node Z (e.g., with a low-latency SLA contract)\
    \ via the SRTE\n   policy that consists of the path Agg1, Agg2, Agg3, DCI3/4(anycast),\n\
    \   Z.  The path is represented by the segment list {16001, 16002, 16003,\n  \
    \ 18006, 20001}.\n   It is clear that the control-plane solution can install an\
    \ SRTE\n   Policy {16002, 16003, 18006} at Agg1, collect the binding SID\n   allocated\
    \ by Agg1 to that policy (e.g., 4001), and hence program\n   node A with the compressed\
    \ SRTE Policy {16001, 4001, 20001}.\n   From node A, 16001 leads to Agg1.  Once\
    \ at Agg1, 4001 leads to the\n   DCI pair (DCI3, DCI4) via a specific low-latency\
    \ path {16002, 16003,\n   18006}.  Once at that DCI pair, 20001 leads to Z.\n\
    \   Binding SIDs allocated to \"intermediate\" SRTE Policies achieve the\n   compression\
    \ of end-to-end SRTE Policies.\n   The segment list {16001, 4001, 20001} expresses\
    \ the same path as\n   {16001, 16002, 16003, 18006, 20001} but with two less segments.\n\
    \   The binding SID also provides for inherent churn protection.\n   When the\
    \ core topology changes, the control plane can update the\n   low-latency SRTE\
    \ Policy from Agg1 to the DCI pair to DC2 without\n   updating the SRTE Policy\
    \ from A to Z.\n"

- title: 8.1.  Simplified Operations
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Simplified Operations\n   Two control-plane protocols not needed in this\
    \ design are LDP and\n   RSVP-TE.  No new protocol has been introduced.  The design\

  contents:
  - "8.2.  Inter-domain SLAs\n   Fast reroute and resiliency are provided by TI-LFA\

    \ Link Group\n   (SRLG).  TI-LFA is described in [SR-TI-LFA].\n   The use of anycast\
    \ SIDs also provides improved availability and\n   resiliency.\n   Inter-domain\
    \ SLAs can be delivered (e.g., latency vs. cost-optimized\n   paths, disjointness\
    \ from backbone planes, disjointness from other\n   services, disjointness between\
    \ primary and backup paths).\n   Existing inter-domain solutions do not provide\
    \ any support for SLA\n   contracts.  They just provide best-effort reachability\
    \ across\n   domains.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Scale
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Scale\n   In addition to having eliminated the need for LDP and RSVP-TE,\n\

  contents:

    \ load-shares across any gateway from the M1 leaf domain\n   to the Core and 16002\
    \ load-shares across any gateway from the Core to\n   the M1 leaf domain).\n"
