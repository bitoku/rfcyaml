Abstract This document registers those Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods that have been defined in RFCs before the IANA HTTP Method Registry was established.
This document registers those Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods that have been defined in RFCs other than [RFC7231] before the IANA HTTP Method Registry was established.
There are no security considerations related to the registration itself.
Security considerations applicable to the individual HTTP methods ought to be discussed in the specifications that define them.
The table below provides registrations of HTTP method names that have been added to the IANA "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Method Registry" at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http methods
(see Section 8.1 of [RFC7231]).
