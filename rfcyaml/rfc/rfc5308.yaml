  title: Status of This Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a method for exchanging IPv6 routing\n   information
    using the IS-IS routing protocol.  The described method\n   utilizes two new TLVs:
    a reachability TLV and an interface address\n   TLV to distribute the necessary
    IPv6 information throughout a routing\n   domain.  Using this method, one can
    route IPv6 along with IPv4 and\n   OSI using a single intra-domain routing protocol.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   IS-IS is an extendible intra-domain routing protocol.  Each
    router in\n   the routing domain issues an Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP)
    that\n   contains information pertaining to that router.  The LSP contains\n   typed
    variable-length data, often referred to as TLVs (type-length-\n   values).  We
    extend the protocol with two new TLVs to carry\n   information required to perform
    IPv6 routing.\n   In [RFC1195], a method is described to route both OSI and IPv4.
    \ We\n   utilize this same method with some minor changes to allow for IPv6.\n
    \  To do so, we must define two new TLVs, namely \"IPv6 Reachability\" and\n   \"IPv6
    Interface Address\", and a new IPv6 protocol identifier.  In our\n   new TLVs,
    we utilize the extended metrics and up/down semantics of\n   [RFC5305].\n"

  - "2.  IPv6 Reachability TLV\n   The \"IPv6 Reachability\" TLV is TLV type 236 (0xEC).\n
    \  [RFC1195] defines two Reachability TLVs, \"IP Internal Reachability\n   Information\"
    and \"IP External Reachability Information\".  We provide\n   the equivalent IPv6
    data with the \"IPv6 Reachability\" TLV and an\n   \"external\" bit.\n   The \"IPv6
    Reachability\" TLV describes network reachability through\n   the specification
    of a routing prefix, metric information, a bit to\n   indicate if the prefix is
    being advertised down from a higher level,\n   a bit to indicate if the prefix
    is being distributed from another\n   routing protocol, and OPTIONALLY the existence
    of Sub-TLVs to allow\n   for later extension.  This data is represented by the
    following\n   structure:\n   0                   1                   2                   3\n

    \  |  Prefix ...\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  |Sub-TLV Len(*) | Sub-TLVs(*) ...\n   * - if present\n   U - up/down bit\n
    \  X - external original bit\n   S - subtlv present bit\n   The above IPv6 Reachability
    TLV MAY appear any number of times\n   (including none) within an LSP.  Link-local
    prefixes MUST NOT be\n   advertised using this TLV.\n   As is described in [RFC5305]:
    \"The up/down bit SHALL be set to 0 when\n   a prefix is first injected into IS-IS.
    \ If a prefix is advertised\n   from a higher level to a lower level (e.g. level
    2 to level 1), the\n   bit SHALL be set to 1, indicating that the prefix has traveled
    down\n   the hierarchy.  Prefixes that have the up/down bit set to 1 may only\n
    \  be advertised down the hierarchy, i.e., to lower levels\".\n   If the prefix
    was distributed into IS-IS from another routing\n   protocol, the external bit
    SHALL be set to 1.  This information is\n   useful when distributing prefixes
    from IS-IS to other protocols.\n   If the Sub-TLV bit is set to 0, then the octets
    of Sub-TLVs are not\n   present.  Otherwise, the bit is 1 and the octet following
    the prefix\n   will contain the length of the Sub-TLV portion of the structure.\n
    \  The prefix is \"packed\" in the data structure.  That is, only the\n   required
    number of octets of prefix are present.  This number can be\n   computed from
    the prefix length octet as follows:\n   prefix octets = integer of ((prefix length
    + 7) / 8)\n   Just as in [RFC5305], if a prefix is advertised with a metric larger\n
    \  than MAX_V6_PATH_METRIC (0xFE000000), this prefix MUST not be\n   considered
    during the normal Shortest Path First (SPF) computation.\n   This will allow advertisement
    of a prefix for purposes other than\n   building the normal IPv6 routing table.\n
    \  If Sub-TLVs are present, they have the same form as normal TLVs, as\n   shown
    below.\n   0                   1                   2                   3\n   0

    \  |      Type     |    Length     |         Value(*) ..\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  * - if present\n   Length indicates how many octets of value are present and
    can be 0.\n"

  - "5.  Operation\n   We utilize the same changes to [RFC1195] as made in [RFC5305]
    for the\n   processing of prefix information.  These changes are both related
    to\n   the SPF calculation.\n   Since the metric space has been extended, we need
    to redefine the\n   MAX_PATH_METRIC (1023) from the original specification in
    [RFC1195].\n   This new value MAX_V6_PATH_METRIC is the same as in [RFC5305]\n
    \  (0xFE000000).  If, during the SPF, a path metric would exceed\n   MAX_V6_PATH_METRIC,
    it SHALL be considered to be MAX_V6_PATH_METRIC.\n   The order of preference between
    paths for a given prefix MUST be\n   modified to consider the up/down bit.  The
    new order of preference is\n   as follows (from best to worst).\n      1.  Level
    1 up prefix\n      2.  Level 2 up prefix\n      3.  Level 2 down prefix\n      4.
    \ Level 1 down prefix\n   If multiple paths have the same best preference, then
    selection\n   occurs based on metric.  Any remaining multiple paths SHOULD be\n
    \  considered for equal-cost multi-path routing if the router supports\n   this;
    otherwise, the router can select any one of the multiple paths.\n"

    following new codepoint registry for Sub-\n   TLVs of TLV 236.  The range of values
    for Type is 0-255.  Allocations\n   within the registry require documentation
    of the use and requires\n   approval by the Designated Expert assigned by the
