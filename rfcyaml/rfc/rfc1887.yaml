- title: 1.   Scope
  contents:
  - "1.   Scope\n   The global internet can be modeled as a collection of hosts\n\
    \   interconnected via transmission and switching facilities.  Control\n   over\
    \ the collection of hosts and the transmission and switching\n   facilities that\
    \ compose the networking resources of the global\n   internet is not homogeneous,\
    \ but is distributed among multiple\n   administrative authorities. Resources\
    \ under control of a single\n   administration within a contiguous segment of\
    \ network topology form a\n   domain.  For the rest of this paper, `domain' and\
    \ `routing domain'\n   will be used interchangeably.\n   Domains that share their\
    \ resources with other domains are called\n   network service providers (or just\
    \ providers). Domains that utilize\n   other domain's resources are called network\
    \ service subscribers (or\n   just subscribers).  A given domain may act as a\
    \ provider and a\n   subscriber simultaneously.\n   There are two aspects of interest\
    \ when discussing IPv6 unicast\n   address allocation within the Internet. The\
    \ first is the set of\n   administrative requirements for obtaining and allocating\
    \ IPv6\n   addresses; the second is the technical aspect of such assignments,\n\
    \   having largely to do with routing, both within a routing domain\n   (intra-domain\
    \ routing) and between routing domains (inter-domain\n   routing). This paper\
    \ focuses on the technical issues.\n   In the current Internet many routing domains\
    \ (such as corporate and\n   campus networks) attach to transit networks (such\
    \ as regionals) in\n   only one or a small number of carefully controlled access\
    \ points.\n   The former act as subscribers, while the latter act as providers.\n\
    \   Addressing solutions which require substantial changes or constraints\n  \
    \ on the current topology are not considered.\n   The architecture and recommendations\
    \ in this paper are oriented\n   primarily toward the large-scale division of\
    \ IPv6 address allocation\n   in the Internet.  Topics covered include:\n    \
    \  - Benefits of encoding some topological information in IPv6\n        addresses\
    \ to significantly reduce routing protocol overhead;\n      - The anticipated\
    \ need for additional levels of hierarchy in\n        Internet addressing to support\
    \ network growth;\n      - The recommended mapping between Internet topological\
    \ entities\n        (i.e., service providers, and service subscribers) and IPv6\n\
    \        addressing and routing components;\n      - The recommended division\
    \ of IPv6 address assignment among\n        service providers (e.g., backbones,\
    \ regionals), and service\n        subscribers (e.g., sites);\n      - Allocation\
    \ of the IPv6 addresses by the Internet Registry;\n      - Choice of the high-order\
    \ portion of the IPv6 addresses in leaf\n        routing domains that are connected\
    \ to more than one service\n        provider (e.g., backbone or a regional network).\n\
    \   It is noted that there are other aspects of IPv6 address allocation,\n   both\
    \ technical and administrative, that are not covered in this\n   paper.  Topics\
    \ not covered or mentioned only superficially include:\n      - A specific plan\
    \ for address assignment;\n      - Embedding address spaces from other network\
    \ layer protocols\n        (including IPv4) in the IPv6 address space and the\
    \ addressing\n        architecture for such embedded addresses;\n      - Multicast\
    \ addressing;\n      - Address allocation for mobile hosts;\n      - Identification\
    \ of specific administrative domains in the\n        Internet;\n      - Policy\
    \ or mechanisms for making registered information known to\n        third parties\
    \ (such as the entity to which a specific IPv6\n        address or a potion of\
    \ the IPv6 address space has been\n        allocated);\n      - How a routing\
    \ domain (especially a site) should organize its\n        internal topology or\
    \ allocate portions of its IPv6 address\n        space; the relationship between\
    \ topology and addresses is\n        discussed, but the method of deciding on\
    \ a particular topology\n        or internal addressing plan is not; and,\n  \

- title: 3.   IPv6 Addresses and Routing
  contents:
  - "3.   IPv6 Addresses and Routing\n   For the purposes of this paper, an IPv6 address\
    \ prefix is defined as\n   an IPv6 address and some indication of the leftmost\
    \ contiguous\n   significant bits within this address portion.  Throughout this\
    \ paper\n   IPv6 address prefixes will be represented as X/Y, where X is a prefix\n\
    \   of an IPv6 address in length greater than or equal to that specified\n   by\
    \ Y and Y is the (decimal) number of the leftmost contiguous\n   significant bits\
    \ within this address.  In the notation, X, the prefix\n   of an IPv6 address\
    \ [2] will have trailing insignificant digits\n   removed.  Thus, an IPv6 prefix\
    \ might appear to be 43DC:0A21:76/40.\n   When determining an administrative policy\
    \ for IPv6 address\n   assignment, it is important to understand the technical\
    \ consequences.\n   The objective behind the use of hierarchical routing is to\
    \ achieve\n   some level of routing data abstraction, or summarization, to reduce\n\
    \   the cpu, memory, and transmission bandwidth consumed in support of\n   routing.\n\
    \   While the notion of routing data abstraction may be applied to\n   various\
    \ types of routing information, this paper focuses on one\n   particular type,\
    \ namely reachability information. Reachability\n   information describes the\
    \ set of reachable destinations.  Abstraction\n   of reachability information\
    \ dictates that IPv6 addresses be assigned\n   according to topological routing\
    \ structures. However in practice\n   administrative assignment falls along organizational\
    \ or political\n   boundaries. These may not be congruent to topological boundaries\
    \ and\n   therefore the requirements of the two may collide. It is necessary to\n\
    \   find a balance between these two needs.\n   Reachability information abstraction\
    \ occurs at the boundary between\n   hierarchically arranged topological routing\
    \ structures. An element\n   lower in the hierarchy reports summary reachability\
    \ information to\n   its parent(s).\n   At routing domain boundaries, IPv6 address\
    \ information is exchanged\n   (statically or dynamically) with other routing\
    \ domains. If IPv6\n   addresses within a routing domain are all drawn from non-contiguous\n\
    \   IPv6 address spaces (allowing no abstraction), then the address\n   information\
    \ exchanged at the boundary consists of an enumerated list\n   of all the IPv6\
    \ addresses.\n   Alternatively, should the routing domain draw IPv6 addresses\
    \ for all\n   the hosts within the domain from a single IPv6 address prefix,\n\
    \   boundary routing information can be summarized into the single IPv6\n   address\
    \ prefix.  This permits substantial data reduction and allows\n   better scaling\
    \ (as compared to the uncoordinated addressing discussed\n   in the previous paragraph).\n\
    \   If routing domains are interconnected in a more-or-less random (i.e.,\n  \
    \ non-hierarchical) scheme, it is quite likely that no further\n   abstraction\
    \ of routing data can occur. Since routing domains would\n   have no defined hierarchical\
    \ relationship, administrators would not\n   be able to assign IPv6 addresses\
    \ within the domains out of some\n   common prefix for the purpose of data abstraction.\
    \ The result would\n   be flat inter-domain routing; all routing domains would\
    \ need explicit\n   knowledge of all other routing domains that they route to.\
    \  This can\n   work well in small and medium sized internets.  However, this\
    \ does\n   not scale to very large internets.  For example, we expect IPv6 to\n\
    \   grow to hundreds of thousands of routing domains in North America\n   alone.\
    \  This requires a greater degree of the reachability\n   information abstraction\
    \ beyond that which can be achieved at the\n   `routing domain' level.\n   In\
    \ the Internet, it should be possible to significantly constrain the\n   volume\
    \ and the complexity of routing information by taking advantage\n   of the existing\
    \ hierarchical interconnectivity. This is discussed\n   further in Section 5.\
    \ Thus, there is the opportunity for a group of\n   routing domains each to be\
    \ assigned an address prefix from a shorter\n   prefix assigned to another routing\
    \ domain whose function is to\n   interconnect the group of routing domains. Each\
    \ member of the group\n   of routing domains now has its (somewhat longer) prefix,\
    \ from which\n   it assigns its addresses.\n   The most straightforward case of\
    \ this occurs when there is a set of\n   routing domains which are all attached\
    \ to a single service provider\n   domain (e.g., regional network), and which\
    \ use that provider for all\n   external (inter-domain) traffic.  A short prefix\
    \ may be given to the\n   provider, which then gives slightly longer prefixes\
    \ (based on the\n   provider's prefix) to each of the routing domains that it\n\
    \   interconnects. This allows the provider, when informing other routing\n  \
    \ domains of the addresses that it can reach, to abstract the\n   reachability\
    \ information for a large number of routing domains into a\n   single prefix.\
    \ This approach therefore can allow a great deal of\n   reduction of routing information,\
    \ and thereby can greatly improve the\n   scalability of inter-domain routing.\n\
    \   Clearly, this approach is recursive and can be carried through\n   several\
    \ iterations. Routing domains at any `level' in the hierarchy\n   may use their\
    \ prefix as the basis for subsequent suballocations,\n   assuming that the IPv6\
    \ addresses remain within the overall length and\n   structure constraints.\n\
    \   At this point, we observe that the number of nodes at each lower\n   level\
    \ of a hierarchy tends to grow exponentially. Thus the greatest\n   gains in the\
    \ reachability information abstraction (for the benefit of\n   all higher levels\
    \ of the hierarchy) occur when the reachability\n   information aggregation occurs\
    \ near the leaves of the hierarchy; the\n   gains drop significantly at each higher\
    \ level. Therefore, the law of\n   diminishing returns suggests that at some point\
    \ data abstraction\n   ceases to produce significant benefits.  Determination\
    \ of the point\n   at which data abstraction ceases to be of benefit requires\
    \ a careful\n   consideration of the number of routing domains that are expected\
    \ to\n   occur at each level of the hierarchy (over a given period of time),\n\
    \   compared to the number of routing domains and address prefixes that\n   can\
    \ conveniently and efficiently be handled via dynamic inter-domain\n   routing\
    \ protocols.\n"

  - "3.1 Efficiency versus Decentralized Control.\n   If the Internet plans to support\
    \ a decentralized address\n   administration, then there is a balance that must\
    \ be sought between\n   the requirements on IPv6 addresses for efficient routing\
    \ and the need\n   for decentralized address administration.  A coherent addressing\
    \ plan\n   at any level within the Internet must take the alternatives into\n\
    \   careful consideration.\n   As an example of administrative decentralization,\
    \ suppose the IPv6\n   address prefix 43/8 identifies part of the IPv6 address\
    \ space\n   allocated for North America. All addresses within this prefix may\
    \ be\n   allocated along topological boundaries in support of increased data\n\
    \   abstraction.  Within this prefix, addresses may be allocated on a\n   per-provider\
    \ bases, based on geography or some other topologically\n   significant criteria.\
    \  For the purposes of this example, suppose that\n   this prefix is allocated\
    \ on a per-provider basis.  Subscribers within\n   North America use parts of\
    \ the IPv6 address space that is underneath\n   the IPv6 address space of their\
    \ service providers.  Within a routing\n   domain addresses for subnetworks and\
    \ hosts are allocated from the\n   unique IPv6 prefix assigned to the domain according\
    \ to the addressing\n   plan for that domain.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.   IPv6 Address Administration and Routing in the Internet\n   Internet routing\
    \ components -- service providers (e.g., backbones,\n   regional networks), and\
    \ service subscribers (e.g., sites or campuses)\n   -- are arranged hierarchically\
    \ for the most part. A natural mapping\n   from these components to IPv6 routing\
    \ components is for providers and\n   subscribers to act as routing domains.\n\
    \   Alternatively, a subscriber (e.g., a site) may choose to operate as a\n  \
    \ part of a domain formed by a service provider. We assume that some,\n   if not\
    \ most, sites will prefer to operate as part of their provider's\n   routing domain,\
    \ exchanging routing information directly with the\n   provider.  The site is\
    \ still allocated a prefix from the provider's\n   address space, and the provider\
    \ will advertise its own prefix into\n   inter-domain routing.\n   Given such\
    \ a mapping, where should address administration and\n   allocation be performed\
    \ to satisfy both administrative\n   decentralization and data abstraction? The\
    \ following possibilities\n   are considered:\n     1) At some part within a routing\
    \ domain,\n     2) At the leaf routing domain,\n     3) At the transit routing\
    \ domain (TRD), and\n     4) At some other, more general boundaries, such as at\
    \ the\n        continental boundary.\n   A part within a routing domain corresponds\
    \ to any arbitrary connected\n   set of subnetworks. If a domain is composed of\
    \ multiple subnetworks,\n   they are interconnected via routers.  Leaf routing\
    \ domains correspond\n   to sites, where the primary purpose is to provide intra-domain\n\
    \   routing services.  Transit routing domains are deployed to carry\n   transit\
    \ (i.e., inter-domain) traffic; backbones and providers are\n   TRDs.  More general\
    \ boundaries can be seen as topologically\n   significant collections of TRDs.\n\
    \   The greatest burden in transmitting and operating on reachability\n   information\
    \ is at the top of the routing hierarchy, where\n   reachability information tends\
    \ to accumulate. In the Internet, for\n   example, providers must manage reachability\
    \ information for all\n   subscribers directly connected to the provider. Traffic\
    \ destined for\n   other providers is generally routed to the backbones (which\
    \ act as\n   providers as well).  The backbones, however, must be cognizant of\
    \ the\n   reachability information for all attached providers and their\n   associated\
    \ subscribers.\n   In general, the advantage of abstracting routing information\
    \ at a\n   given level of the routing hierarchy is greater at the higher levels\n\
    \   of the hierarchy. There is relatively little direct benefit to the\n   administration\
    \ that performs the abstraction, since it must maintain\n   routing information\
    \ individually on each attached topological routing\n   structure.\n   For example,\
    \ suppose that a given site is trying to decide whether to\n   obtain an IPv6\
    \ address prefix directly from the IPv6 address space\n   allocated for North\
    \ America, or from the IPv6 address space allocated\n   to its service provider.\
    \ If considering only their own self-interest,\n   the site itself and the attached\
    \ provider have little reason to\n   choose one approach or the other. The site\
    \ must use one prefix or\n   another; the source of the prefix has little effect\
    \ on routing\n   efficiency within the site. The provider must maintain information\n\
    \   about each attached site in order to route, regardless of any\n   commonality\
    \ in the prefixes of the sites.\n   However, there is a difference when the provider\
    \ distributes routing\n   information to other providers (e.g., backbones or TRDs).\
    \  In the\n   first case, the provider cannot aggregate the site's address into\
    \ its\n   own prefix; the address must be explicitly listed in routing\n   exchanges,\
    \ resulting in an additional burden to other providers which\n   must exchange\
    \ and maintain this information.\n   In the second case, each other provider (e.g.,\
    \ backbone or TRD) sees\n   a single address prefix for the provider, which encompasses\
    \ the new\n   site. This avoids the exchange of additional routing information\
    \ to\n   identify the new site's address prefix. Thus, the advantages\n   primarily\
    \ accrue to other providers which maintain routing\n   information about this\
    \ site and provider.\n   One might apply a supplier/consumer model to this problem:\
    \ the higher\n   level (e.g., a backbone) is a supplier of routing services, while\
    \ the\n   lower level (e.g., a TRD) is the consumer of these services. The\n \
    \  price charged for services is based upon the cost of providing them.\n   The\
    \ overhead of managing a large table of addresses for routing to an\n   attached\
    \ topological entity contributes to this cost.\n   At present the Internet, however,\
    \ is not a market economy.  Rather,\n   efficient operation is based on cooperation.\
    \  The recommendations\n   discussed below describe simple and tractable ways\
    \ of managing the\n   IPv6 address space that benefit the entire community.\n"

- title: 4.2   Administration at the Leaf Routing Domain
  contents:
  - "4.2   Administration at the Leaf Routing Domain\n   As mentioned previously,\
    \ the greatest degree of data abstraction\n   comes at the lowest levels of the\
    \ hierarchy. Providing each leaf\n   routing domain (that is, site) with a contiguous\
    \ block of addresses\n   from its provider's address block results in the biggest\
    \ single\n   increase in abstraction. From outside the leaf routing domain, the\n\
    \   set of all addresses reachable in the domain can then be represented\n   by\
    \ a single prefix.  Further, all destinations reachable within the\n   provider's\
    \ prefix can be represented by a single prefix.\n   For example, consider a single\
    \ campus which is a leaf routing domain\n   which would currently require 4 different\
    \ IPv6 prefixes.  Instead,\n   they may be given a single prefix which provides\
    \ the same number of\n   destination addresses.  Further, since the prefix is\
    \ a subset of the\n   provider's prefix, they impose no additional burden on the\

    \ below.\n"
- title: 4.3.1   Direct Service Providers
  contents:
  - "4.3.1   Direct Service Providers\n   In a provider-based addressing plan, direct\
    \ service providers should\n   use their IPv6 address space for assigning IPv6\
    \ addresses from a\n   unique prefix to the leaf routing domains that they serve.\
    \ The\n   benefits derived from data abstraction are greater than in the case\n\
    \   of leaf routing domains, and the additional degree of data\n   abstraction\
    \ provided by this may be necessary in the short term.\n   As an illustration\
    \ consider an example of a direct provider that\n   serves 100 clients. If each\
    \ client takes its addresses from 4\n   independent address spaces then the total\
    \ number of entries that are\n   needed to handle routing to these clients is\
    \ 400 (100 clients times 4\n   providers).  If each client takes its addresses\
    \ from a single address\n   space then the total number of entries would be only\
    \ 100. Finally, if\n   all the clients take their addresses from the same address\
    \ space then\n   the total number of entries would be only 1.\n   We expect that\
    \ in the near term the number of routing domains in the\n   Internet will grow\
    \ to the point that it will be infeasible to route\n   on the basis of a flat\
    \ field of routing domains. It will therefore be\n   essential to provide a greater\
    \ degree of information abstraction with\n   IPv6.\n   Direct providers may give\
    \ part of their address space (prefixes) to\n   leaf domains, based on an address\
    \ prefix given to the provider.  This\n   results in direct providers advertising\
    \ to other providers a small\n   fraction of the number of address prefixes that\
    \ would be necessary if\n   they enumerated the individual prefixes of the leaf\
    \ routing domains.\n   This represents a significant savings given the expected\
    \ scale of\n   global internetworking.\n   The efficiencies gained in inter-domain\
    \ routing clearly warrant the\n   adoption of IPv6 address prefixes derived from\
    \ the IPv6 address space\n   of the providers.\n   The mechanics of this scenario\
    \ are straightforward. Each direct\n   provider is given a unique small set of\
    \ IPv6 address prefixes, from\n   which its attached leaf routing domains can\
    \ allocate slightly longer\n   IPv6 address prefixes.  For example assume that\
    \ NIST is a leaf\n   routing domain whose inter-domain link is via SURANet. If\
    \ SURANet is\n   assigned an unique IPv6 address prefix 43DC:0A21/32, NIST could\
    \ use a\n   unique IPv6 prefix of 43DC:0A21:7652:34/56.\n   If a direct service\
    \ provider is connected to another provider(s)\n   (either direct or indirect)\
    \ via multiple attachment points, then in\n   certain cases it may be advantageous\
    \ to the direct provider to exert\n   a certain degree of control over the coupling\
    \ between the attachment\n   points and flow of the traffic destined to a particular\
    \ subscriber.\n   Such control can be facilitated by first partitioning all the\n\
    \   subscribers into groups, such that traffic destined to all the\n   subscribers\
    \ within a group should flow through a particular\n   attachment point. Once the\
    \ partitioning is done, the address space of\n   the provider is subdivided along\
    \ the group boundaries. A leaf routing\n   domain that is willing to accept prefixes\
    \ derived from its direct\n   provider gets a prefix from the provider's address\
    \ space subdivision\n   associated with the group the domain belongs to.\n   At\
    \ the attachment point (between the direct and indirect providers)\n   the direct\
    \ provider advertises both an address prefix that\n   corresponds to the address\
    \ space of the provider, and one or more\n   address prefixes that correspond\
    \ to the address space associated with\n   each subdivision.  The latter prefixes\
    \ match the former prefix, but\n   are longer than the former prefix. Use of the\
    \ \"longest match\"\n   forwarding algorithm by the recipients of these prefixes\
    \ (e.g., a\n   router within the indirect provider) results in forcing the flow\
    \ of\n   the traffic to destinations depicted by the longer address prefixes\n\
    \   through the attachment point where these prefixes are advertised to\n   the\
    \ indirect provider.\n   For example, assume that SURANet is connected to another\
    \ regional\n   provider, NEARNet, at two attachment points, A1 and A2. SURANet\
    \ is\n   assigned a unique IPv6 address prefix 43DC:0A21/32. To exert control\n\
    \   over the traffic flow destined to a particular subscriber within\n   SURANet,\
    \ SURANet may subdivide the address space assigned to it into\n   two groups,\
    \ 43DC:0A21:8/34 and 43DC:0A21:C/34. The former group may\n   be used for sites\
    \ attached to SURANet that are closer (as determined\n   by the topology within\
    \ SURANet) to A1, while the latter group may be\n   used for sites that are closer\
    \ to A2.  The SURANet router at A1\n   advertises both 43DC:0A21/32 and 43DC:0A21:8/34\
    \ address prefixes to\n   the router in NEARNet. Likewise, the SURANet router\
    \ at A2 advertises\n   both 43DC:0A21/32 and 43DC:0A21:C/34 address prefixes to\
    \ the router\n   in NEARNet. Traffic that flows through NEARNet to destinations\
    \ that\n   match 43DC:0A21:8/34 address prefix would enter SURANet at A1, while\n\
    \   traffic to destinations that match 43DC:0A21:C/34 address prefix\n   would\
    \ enter SURANet at A2.\n   Note that the advertisement by the direct provider\
    \ of the routing\n   information associated with each subdivision must be done\
    \ with care\n   to ensure that such an advertisement would not result in a global\n\
    \   distribution of separate reachability information associated with\n   each\
    \ subdivision, unless such distribution is warranted for some\n   other purposes\

    \ for those\n   routing domains which are attached to a single TRD. In particular,\n\

- title: 4.4.1 Solution 1
  contents:
  - "4.4.1 Solution 1\n   One possible solution is for each multi-homed organization\
    \ to obtain\n   its IPv6 address space independently of the providers to which\
    \ it is\n   attached.  This allows each multi-homed organization to base its IPv6\n\
    \   assignments on a single prefix, and to thereby summarize the set of\n   all\
    \ IPv6 addresses reachable within that organization via a single\n   prefix. \
    \ The disadvantage of this approach is that since the IPv6\n   address for that\
    \ organization has no relationship to the addresses of\n   any particular TRD,\
    \ the TRDs to which this organization is attached\n   will need to advertise the\
    \ prefix for this organization to other\n   providers.  Other providers (potentially\
    \ worldwide) will need to\n   maintain an explicit entry for that organization\
    \ in their routing\n   tables.\n   For example, suppose that a very large North\
    \ American company `Mega\n   Big International Incorporated' (MBII) has a fully\
    \ interconnected\n   internal network and is assigned a single prefix as part\
    \ of the North\n   American prefix.  It is likely that outside of North America,\
    \ a\n   single entry may be maintained in routing tables for all North\n   American\
    \ Destinations.  However, within North America, every provider\n   will need to\
    \ maintain a separate address entry for MBII. If MBII is\n   in fact an international\
    \ corporation, then it may be necessary for\n   every provider worldwide to maintain\
    \ a separate entry for MBII\n   (including backbones to which MBII is not attached).\
    \ Clearly this may\n   be acceptable if there are a small number of such multi-homed\
    \ routing\n   domains, but would place an unacceptable load on routers within\n\
    \   backbones if all organizations were to choose such address\n   assignments.\
    \  This solution may not scale to internets where there\n   are many hundreds\
    \ of thousands of multi-homed organizations.\n"
- title: 4.4.2 Solution 2
  contents:
  - "4.4.2 Solution 2\n   A second possible approach would be for multi-homed organizations\
    \ to\n   be assigned a separate IPv6 address space for each connection to a\n\
    \   TRD, and to assign a single prefix to some subset of its domain(s)\n   based\
    \ on the closest interconnection point. For example, if MBII had\n   connections\
    \ to two providers in the U.S. (one east coast, and one\n   west coast), as well\
    \ as three connections to national backbones in\n   Europe, and one in the far\
    \ east, then MBII may make use of six\n   different address prefixes.  Each part\
    \ of MBII would be assigned a\n   single address prefix based on the nearest connection.\n\
    \   For purposes of external routing of traffic from outside MBII to a\n   destination\
    \ inside of MBII, this approach works similarly to treating\n   MBII as six separate\
    \ organizations. For purposes of internal routing,\n   or for routing traffic\
    \ from inside of MBII to a destination outside\n   of MBII, this approach works\
    \ the same as the first solution.\n   If we assume that incoming traffic (coming\
    \ from outside of MBII, with\n   a destination within MBII) is always to enter\
    \ via the nearest point\n   to the destination, then each TRD which has a connection\
    \ to MBII\n   needs to announce to other TRDs the ability to reach only those\
    \ parts\n   of MBII whose address is taken from its own address space. This\n\
    \   implies that no additional routing information needs to be exchanged\n   between\
    \ TRDs, resulting in a smaller load on the inter-domain routing\n   tables maintained\
    \ by TRDs when compared to the first solution. This\n   solution therefore scales\
    \ better to extremely large internets\n   containing very large numbers of multi-homed\
    \ organizations.\n   One problem with the second solution is that backup routes\
    \ to multi-\n   homed organizations are not automatically maintained. With the\
    \ first\n   solution, each TRD, in announcing the ability to reach MBII,\n   specifies\
    \ that it is able to reach all of the hosts within MBII. With\n   the second solution,\
    \ each TRD announces that it can reach all of the\n   hosts based on its own address\
    \ prefix, which only includes some of\n   the hosts within MBII. If the connection\
    \ between MBII and one\n   particular TRD were severed, then the hosts within\
    \ MBII with\n   addresses based on that TRD would become unreachable via inter-domain\n\
    \   routing. The impact of this problem can be reduced somewhat by\n   maintenance\
    \ of additional information within routing tables, but this\n   reduces the scaling\
    \ advantage of the second approach.\n   The second solution also requires that\
    \ when external connectivity\n   changes, internal addresses also change.\n  \
    \ Also note that this and the previous approach will tend to cause\n   packets\
    \ to take different routes. With the first approach, packets\n   from outside\
    \ of MBII destined for within MBII will tend to enter via\n   the point which\
    \ is closest to the source (which will therefore tend\n   to maximize the load\
    \ on the networks internal to MBII). With the\n   second solution, packets from\
    \ outside destined for within MBII will\n   tend to enter via the point which\
    \ is closest to the destination\n   (which will tend to minimize the load on the\
    \ networks within MBII,\n   and maximize the load on the TRDs).\n   These solutions\
    \ also have different effects on policies. For example,\n   suppose that country\
    \ `X' has a law that traffic from a source within\n   country X to a destination\
    \ within country X must at all times stay\n   entirely within the country. With\
    \ the first solution, it is not\n   possible to determine from the destination\
    \ address whether or not the\n   destination is within the country. With the second\
    \ solution, a\n   separate address may be assigned to those hosts which are within\n\
    \   country X, thereby allowing routing policies to be followed.\n   Similarly,\
    \ suppose that `Little Small Company' (LSC) has a policy\n   that its packets\
    \ may never be sent to a destination that is within\n   MBII. With either solution,\
    \ the routers within LSC may be configured\n   to discard any traffic that has\
    \ a destination within MBII's address\n   space. However, with the first solution\
    \ this requires one entry; with\n   the second it requires many entries and may\
    \ be impossible as a\n   practical matter.\n"

  - "4.4.3 Solution 3\n   There are other possible solutions as well. A third approach\
    \ is to\n   assign each multi-homed organization a single address prefix, based\n\
    \   on one of its connections to a TRD. Other TRDs to which the multi-\n   homed\
    \ organization are attached maintain a routing table entry for\n   the organization,\
    \ but are extremely selective in terms of which other\n   TRDs are told of this\

    \   There is at least one situation in which this third approach is\n   particularly\
    \ appropriate. Suppose that a special interest group of\n   organizations have\

    \ various\n   organizations which are in the widget group will run their internal\n\
    \   networks as separate routing domains, and most of them will also be\n   attached\
    \ to other TRDs (since most of the organizations involved in\n   widget manufacture\
    \ and research will also be involved in other\n   activities). We can therefore\
    \ expect that many or most of the\n   organizations in the widget group are dual-homed,\
    \ with one attachment\n   for widget-associated communications and the other attachment\
    \ for\n   other types of communications. Let's also assume that the total\n  \
    \ number of organizations involved in the widget group is small enough\n   that\
    \ it is reasonable to maintain a routing table containing one\n   entry per organization,\
    \ but that they are distributed throughout a\n   larger internet with many millions\
    \ of (mostly not widget-associated)\n   routing domains.\n   With the third approach,\
    \ each multi-homed organization in the widget\n   group would make use of an address\
    \ assignment based on its other\n   attachment(s) to TRDs (the attachments not\
    \ associated with the widget\n   group). The widget provider would need to maintain\
    \ routes to the\n   routing domains associated with the various member organizations.\n\
    \   Similarly, all members of the widget group would need to maintain a\n   table\
    \ of routes to the other members via the widget provider.\n   However, since the\
    \ widget provider does not inform other general\n   worldwide TRDs of what addresses\
    \ it can reach (since the provider is\n   not intended for use by other outside\
    \ organizations), the relatively\n   large set of routing prefixes needs to be\
    \ maintained only in a\n   limited number of places. The addresses assigned to\
    \ the various\n   organizations which are members of the widget group would provide\
    \ a\n   `default route' via each members other attachments to TRDs, while\n  \
    \ allowing communications within the widget group to use the preferred\n   path.\n"

    \ `SouthNorthNet' and `NorthSouthNet' which have a very large\n   number of customers\

- title: 4.5   Private Links
  contents:
  - "4.5   Private Links\n   The discussion up to this point concentrates on the relationship\n\
    \   between IPv6 addresses and routing between various routing domains\n   over\
    \ transit routing domains, where each transit routing domain\n   interconnects\
    \ a large number of routing domains and offers a more-\n   or-less public service.\n\
    \   However, there may also exist a number of links which interconnect\n   two\
    \ routing domains in such a way, that usage of these links may be\n   limited\
    \ to carrying traffic only between the two routing domains.\n   We'll refer to\
    \ such links as \"private\".\n   For example, let's suppose that the XYZ corporation\
    \ does a lot of\n   business with MBII. In this case, XYZ and MBII may contract\
    \ with a\n   carrier to provide a private link between the two corporations, where\n\
    \   this link may only be used for packets whose source is within one of\n   the\
    \ two corporations, and whose destination is within the other of\n   the two corporations.\
    \ Finally, suppose that the point-to-point link\n   is connected between a single\
    \ router (router X) within XYZ\n   corporation and a single router (router M)\
    \ within MBII. It is\n   therefore necessary to configure router X to know which\
    \ addresses can\n   be reached over this link (specifically, all addresses reachable\
    \ in\n   MBII). Similarly, it is necessary to configure router M to know which\n\
    \   addresses can be reached over this link (specifically, all addresses\n   reachable\
    \ in XYZ Corporation).\n   The important observation to be made here is that the\
    \ additional\n   connectivity due to such private links may be ignored for the\
    \ purpose\n   of IPv6 address allocation, and do not pose a problem for routing\
    \ on\n   a larger scale. This is because the routing information associated\n\
    \   with such connectivity is not propagated throughout the internet, and\n  \
    \ therefore does not need to be collapsed into a TRD's prefix.\n   In our example,\
    \ let's suppose that the XYZ corporation has a single\n   connection to a regional,\
    \ and has therefore uses the IPv6 address\n   space from the space given to that\
    \ regional.  Similarly, let's\n   suppose that MBII, as an international corporation\
    \ with connections\n   to six different providers, has chosen the second solution\
    \ from\n   Section 4.4, and therefore has obtained six different address\n   allocations.\
    \ In this case, all addresses reachable in the XYZ\n   Corporation can be described\
    \ by a single address prefix (implying\n   that router M only needs to be configured\
    \ with a single address\n   prefix to represent the addresses reachable over this\
    \ link). All\n   addresses reachable in MBII can be described by six address prefixes\n\
    \   (implying that router X needs to be configured with six address\n   prefixes\
    \ to represent the addresses reachable over the link).\n   In some cases, such\
    \ private links may be permitted to forward traffic\n   for a small number of\
    \ other routing domains, such as closely\n   affiliated organizations. This will\
    \ increase the configuration\n   requirements slightly. However, provided that\
    \ the number of\n   organizations using the link is relatively small, then this\
    \ still\n   does not represent a significant problem.\n   Note that the relationship\
    \ between routing and IPv6 addressing\n   described in other sections of this\
    \ paper is concerned with problems\n   in scaling caused by large, essentially\
    \ public transit routing\n   domains which interconnect a large number of routing\
    \ domains.\n   However, for the purpose of IPv6 address allocation, private links\n\
    \   which interconnect only a small number of private routing domains do\n   not\
    \ pose a problem, and may be ignored. For example, this implies\n   that a single\
    \ leaf routing domain which has a single connection to a\n   `public' provider\
    \ (e.g., the Alternet), plus a number of private\n   links to other leaf routing\
    \ domains, can be treated as if it were\n   single-homed to the provider for the\
    \ purpose of IPv6 address\n   allocation.  We expect that this is also another\
    \ way of dealing with\n   multi-homed domains.\n"

    \   providers.  Such organizations may, however, have a number of private\n  \
    \ links that they use for communications with other organizations. Such\n   organizations\
    \ do not participate in global routing, but are satisfied\n   with reachability\
    \ to those organizations with which they have\n   established private links. These\
    \ are referred to as zero-homed\n   routing domains.\n   Zero-homed routing domains\
    \ can be considered as the degenerate case\n   of routing domains with private\
    \ links, as discussed in the previous\n   section, and do not pose a problem for\
    \ inter-domain routing. As\n   above, the routing information exchanged across\
    \ the private links\n   sees very limited distribution, usually only to the routing\
    \ domain at\n   the other end of the link. Thus, there are no address abstraction\n\
    \   requirements beyond those inherent in the address prefixes exchanged\n   across\
    \ the private link.\n   However, it is important that zero-homed routing domains\
    \ use valid\n   globally unique IPv6 addresses. Suppose that the zero-homed routing\n\
    \   domain is connected through a private link to a routing domain.\n   Further,\
    \ this routing domain participates in an internet that\n   subscribes to the global\
    \ IPv6 addressing plan. This domain must be\n   able to distinguish between the\
    \ zero-homed routing domain's IPv6\n   addresses and any other IPv6 addresses\
    \ that it may need to route to.\n   The only way this can be guaranteed is if\
    \ the zero-homed routing\n   domain uses globally unique IPv6 addresses.\n   Whereas\
    \ globally unique addresses are necessary to differentiate\n   between destinations\
    \ in the Internet, globally unique addresses may\n   not be sufficient to guarantee\
    \ global connectivity.  If a zero-homed\n   routing domain gets connected to the\
    \ Internet, the block of addresses\n   used within the domain may not be related\
    \ to the block of addresses\n   allocated to the domain's direct provider. In\
    \ order to maintain the\n   gains given by hierarchical routing and address assignment\

    \   direct or indirect) spans a continental division.  These exceptions\n   can\
    \ be handled similarly to multi-homed routing domains, as discussed\n   above.\n\
    \   The benefit of continental aggregation is that it helps to absorb the\n  \
    \ entropy introduced within continental routing caused by the cases\n   where\
    \ an organization must use an address prefix which must be\n   advertised beyond\
    \ its direct provider.  In such cases, if the address\n   is taken from the continental\
    \ prefix, the additional cost of the\n   route is not propagated past the point\
    \ where continental aggregation\n   takes place.\n   Note that, in contrast to\
    \ the case of providers, the aggregation of\n   continental routing information\
    \ may not be done on the continent to\n   which the prefix is allocated.  The\
    \ cost of inter-continental links\n   (and especially trans-oceanic links) is\
    \ very high.  If aggregation is\n   performed on the `near' side of the link,\
    \ then routing information\n   about unreachable destinations within that continent\
    \ can only reside\n   on that continent.  Alternatively, if continental aggregation\
    \ is done\n   on the `far' side of an inter-continental link, the `far' end can\n\
    \   perform the aggregation and inject it into continental routing.  This\n  \
    \ means that destinations which are part of the continental\n   aggregation, but\
    \ for which there is not a corresponding more specific\n   prefix can be rejected\
    \ before leaving the continent on which they\n   originated.\n   For example,\
    \ suppose that Europe is assigned a prefix of 46/8, such\n   that European routing\
    \ also contains the longer prefixes 46DC:0A01/32\n   and 46DC:0A02/32 .  All of\
    \ the longer European prefixes may be\n   advertised across a trans-Atlantic link\
    \ to North America.  The router\n   in North America would then aggregate these\
    \ routes, and only\n   advertise the prefix 46/8 into North American routing.\
    \  Packets which\n   are destined for 46DC:0A01:1234:5678:ABCD:8765:4321:AABB\
    \ would\n   traverse North American routing, but would encounter the North\n \
    \  American router which performed the European aggregation.  If the\n   prefix\
    \ 46DC:0A01/32 is unreachable, the router would drop the packet\n   and send an\
    \ unreachable message without using the trans-Atlantic\n   link.\n"

  - "4.8   Private (Local Use) Addresses\n   Many domains will have hosts which, for\
    \ one reason or another, will\n   not require globally unique IPv6 addresses.\
    \  A domain which decides\n   to use IPv6 addresses out of the private address\
    \ space is able to do\n   so without address allocation from any authority.  Conversely,\
    \ the\n   private address prefix need not be advertised throughout the public\n\
    \   portion of the Internet.\n   In order to use private address space, a domain\
    \ needs to determine\n   which hosts do not need to have network layer connectivity\
    \ outside\n   the domain in the foreseeable future.  Such hosts will be called\n\
    \   private hosts, and may use the private addresses described above if\n   it\
    \ is topologically convenient.  Private hosts can communicate with\n   all other\
    \ hosts inside the domain, both public and private.  However,\n   they cannot\
    \ have IPv6 connectivity to any external host.  While not\n   having external\
    \ network layer connectivity, a private host can still\n   have access to external\
    \ services via application layer relays.\n   Public hosts do not have connectivity\
    \ to private hosts outside of\n   their own domain.\n   Because private addresses\
    \ have no global meaning, reachability\n   information associated with the private\
    \ address space shall not be\n   propagated on inter-domain links, and packets\
    \ with private source or\n   destination addresses should not be forwarded across\
    \ such links.\n   Routers in domains not using private address space, especially\
    \ those\n   of Internet service providers, are expected to be configured to\n\
    \   reject (filter out) routing information that carries reachability\n   information\
    \ associated with private addresses.  If such a router\n   receives such information\
    \ the rejection shall not be treated as a\n   routing protocol error.\n   In addition,\
    \ indirect references to private addresses should be\n   contained within the\
    \ enterprise that uses these addresses. Prominent\n   example of such references\
    \ are DNS Resource Records.  A possible\n   approach to avoid leaking of DNS RRs\
    \ is to run two nameservers, one\n   external server authoritative for all globally\
    \ unique IP addresses of\n   the enterprise and one internal nameserver authoritative\
    \ for all IP\n   addresses of the enterprise, both public and private.  In order\
    \ to\n   ensure consistency both these servers should be configured from the\n\
    \   same data of which the external nameserver only receives a filtered\n   version.\
    \  The resolvers on all internal hosts, both public and\n   private, query only\
    \ the internal nameserver.  The external server\n   resolves queries from resolvers\
    \ outside the enterprise and is linked\n   into the global DNS.  The internal\
    \ server forwards all queries for\n   information outside the enterprise to the\
    \ external nameserver, so all\n   internal hosts can access the global DNS.  This\
    \ ensures that\n   information about private hosts does not reach resolvers and\n\
    \   nameservers outside the enterprise.\n"

  - "5.   Recommendations\n   We anticipate that the current exponential growth of\
    \ the Internet\n   will continue or accelerate for the foreseeable future. In\
    \ addition,\n   we anticipate a rapid internationalization of the Internet. The\n\
    \   ability of routing to scale is dependent upon the use of data\n   abstraction\
    \ based on hierarchical IPv6 addresses.  It is therefore\n   essential to choose\
    \ a hierarchical structure for IPv6 addresses with\n   great care.\n   Great attention\
    \ must be paid to the definition of addressing\n   structures to balance the conflicting\
    \ goals of:\n     - Route optimality\n     - Routing algorithm efficiency\n  \
    \   - Ease and administrative efficiency of address registration\n     - Considerations\
    \ for what addresses are assigned by what addressing\n        authority\n   It\
    \ is in the best interests of the internetworking community that the\n   cost\
    \ of operations be kept to a minimum where possible. In the case\n   of IPv6 address\
    \ allocation, this again means that routing data\n   abstraction must be encouraged.\n\
    \   In order for data abstraction to be possible, the assignment of IPv6\n   addresses\
    \ must be accomplished in a manner which is consistent with\n   the actual physical\
    \ topology of the Internet. For example, in those\n   cases where organizational\
    \ and administrative boundaries are not\n   related to actual network topology,\
    \ address assignment based on such\n   organization boundaries is not recommended.\n\
    \   The intra-domain routing protocols allow for information abstraction\n   to\
    \ be maintained within a domain.  For zero-homed and single-homed\n   routing\
    \ domains (which are expected to remain zero-homed or single-\n   homed), we recommend\
    \ that the IPv6 addresses assigned within a single\n   routing domain use a single\
    \ address prefix assigned to that domain.\n   Specifically, this allows the set\
    \ of all IPv6 addresses reachable\n   within a single domain to be fully described\
    \ via a single prefix.\n   We anticipate that the total number of routing domains\
    \ existing on a\n   worldwide Internet to be great enough that additional levels\
    \ of\n   hierarchical data abstraction beyond the routing domain level will be\n\
    \   necessary.\n   In most cases, network topology will have a close relationship\
    \ with\n   national boundaries. For example, the degree of network connectivity\n\
    \   will often be greater within a single country than between countries.\n  \
    \ It is therefore appropriate to make specific recommendations based on\n   national\
    \ boundaries, with the understanding that there may be\n   specific situations\
    \ where these general recommendations need to be\n   modified.\n   Further, from\
    \ experience with IPv4, we feel that continental\n   aggregation is beneficial\
    \ and should be supported where possible as a\n   means of limiting the unwarranted\
    \ spread of routing exceptions.\n"
- title: 5.1   Recommendations for an address allocation plan
  contents:
  - "5.1   Recommendations for an address allocation plan\n   We anticipate that public\
    \ interconnectivity between private routing\n   domains will be provided by a\
    \ diverse set of TRDs, including (but not\n   necessarily limited to):\n     -\
    \ Backbone networks;\n     - A number of regional or national networks; and,\n\
    \     - A number of commercial Public Data Networks.\n   These networks will not\
    \ be interconnected in a strictly hierarchical\n   manner (for example, there\
    \ is expected to be direct connectivity\n   between regionals, and all of these\
    \ types of networks may have direct\n   international connections).  These TRDs\
    \ will be used to interconnect\n   a wide variety of routing domains, each of\
    \ which may comprise a\n   single corporation, part of a corporation, a university\
    \ campus, a\n   government agency, or other organizational unit.\n   In addition,\
    \ some private corporations may be expected to make use of\n   dedicated private\
    \ TRDs for communication within their own\n   corporation.\n   We anticipate that\
    \ the great majority of routing domains will be\n   attached to only one of the\
    \ TRDs. This will permit hierarchical\n   address aggregation based on TRD. We\
    \ therefore strongly recommend\n   that addresses be assigned hierarchically,\
    \ based on address prefixes\n   assigned to individual TRDs.\n   To support continental\
    \ aggregation of routes, we recommend that all\n   addresses for TRDs which are\
    \ wholly within a continent be taken from\n   the continental prefix.\n   For\
    \ the proposed address allocation scheme, this implies that\n   portions of IPv6\
    \ address space should be assigned to each TRD\n   (explicitly including the backbones\
    \ and regionals). For those leaf\n   routing domains which are connected to a\
    \ single TRD, they should be\n   assigned a prefix value from the address space\
    \ assigned to that TRD.\n   For routing domains which are not attached to any\
    \ publically\n   available TRD, there is not the same urgent need for hierarchical\n\
    \   address aggregation. We do not, therefore, make any additional\n   recommendations\
    \ for such `isolated' routing domains.  Where such\n   domains are connected to\
    \ other domains by private point-to-point\n   links, and where such links are\
    \ used solely for routing between the\n   two domains that they interconnect,\
    \ again no additional technical\n   problems relating to address abbreviation\
    \ is caused by such a link,\n   and no specific additional recommendations are\
    \ necessary.  We do\n   recommend that since such domains may wish to use a private\
    \ address\n   space, that the addressing plan specify a specific prefix for private\n\
    \   addressing.\n   Further, in order to allow aggregation of IPv6 addresses at\
    \ national\n   and continental boundaries into as few prefixes as possible, we\n\
    \   further recommend that IPv6 addresses allocated to routing domains\n   should\
    \ be assigned based on each routing domain's connectivity to\n   national and\
    \ continental Internet backbones.\n"
- title: 5.2   Recommendations for Multi-Homed Routing Domains
  contents:
  - "5.2   Recommendations for Multi-Homed Routing Domains\n   Some routing domains\
    \ will be attached to multiple TRDs within the\n   same country, or to TRDs within\
    \ multiple different countries. We\n   refer to these as `multi-homed' routing\
    \ domains. Clearly the strict\n   hierarchical model discussed above does not\
    \ neatly handle such\n   routing domains.\n   There are several possible ways\
    \ that these multi-homed routing\n   domains may be handled, as described in Section\
    \ 4.4.  Each of these\n   methods vary with respect to the amount of information\
    \ that must be\n   maintained for inter-domain routing and also with respect to\
    \ the\n   inter-domain routes. In addition, the organization that will bear the\n\
    \   brunt of this cost varies with the possible solutions. For example,\n   the\
    \ solutions vary with respect to:\n     - Resources used within routers within\
    \ the TRDs;\n     - Administrative cost on TRD personnel; and,\n     - Difficulty\

    \ the\n   primary route fails.\n   For these reasons it is not possible to mandate\
    \ a single solution for\n   all situations. Rather, economic considerations will\
