- title: Status of this Memo
  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo defines a standard way of converting IP addresses\
    \ to CCITT\n   X.121 addresses and is the recommended standard for use on the\n\
    \   Internet, specifically for the Defense Data Network (DDN).  This memo\n  \
    \ provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify\n   an\
    \ Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   The Defense Communication Agency (DCA) has stated that \"DDN\
    \ specifies\n   a standard for mapping Class A addresses to X.121 addresses.\"\
    \n   Additionally DCA has stated that Class B and C IP to X.121 address\n   mapping\
    \ \"standards are the responsibility of the administration of\n   the Class B\
    \ or C network in question\".  Therefore, there is NO\n   defined single standard\
    \ way of converting Class B and Class C IP\n   addresses to X.121 addresses.\n\
    \   This is an important issue because currently there is no way for\n   administrators\
    \ to define IP to X.121 address mapping.  Without a\n   single standard, in a\
    \ multi-vendor network environment, there is no\n   assurance that devices using\
    \ IP and DDN X.25 will communicate with\n   each other.\n   The IP to X.121 address\
    \ mapping of Class B and Class C IP addresses\n   shall be implemented as described\
    \ below.  This translation method is\n   a direct expansion of the algorithm described\
    \ in the \"MIL-STD:  X.25,\n   DDN X.25 Host Interface Specification\" [1].  The\
    \ translation method\n   described below is TOTALLY independent of IP subnetting\
    \ and of any\n   masking that may be used in support of IP subnetting.\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   All Internet hosts are assigned a four octet (32 bit) address\n\
    \   composed of a network field and a local address field also known as\n   the\
    \ REST field [2] (see Figure 1 thru 3).  Two basic forms of\n   addresses are\
    \ provided:  (1) Physical addresses, correspond to the\n   node number and DCE\
    \ port number of the node to which the DTE is\n   connected.  (2) Logical addresses,\
    \ are mapped transparently by DCE\n   software into a corresponding physical network\
    \ address.\n   To provide flexibility, Internet addresses are divided into 3 primary\n\
    \   classes:  Class A, Class B, and Class C.  These classes allow for a\n   large\
    \ number of small and medium sized networks.  The network\n   addresses used within\
    \ the Internet in Class A, B, and C networks are\n   divided between Research,\
    \ Defense, Government, (Non-Defense) and\n   Commercial uses.\n   As described\
    \ in the MIL-STD:  X25, an IP address consists of the\n   ASCII text string representation\
    \ of four decimal numbers separated by\n   periods, corresponding to the four\
    \ octets of a thirty-two bit\n   Internet address.  The four decimal numbers are\
    \ referred to in this\n   memo as network (n), host (h), logical address (l),\
    \ and Interface\n   Message Processor (IMP) or Packet Switch Node (PSN) (i). \
    \ Thus, an\n   Internet address maybe represented as \"n.h.l.i\" (Class A), \"\
    n.n.h.i\"\n   (Class B), or \"n.n.n.hi\" (Class C), depending on the Internet\
    \ address\n   class.  Each of these four numbers will have either one, two, or\n\
    \   three decimal digits and will never have a value greater than 255.\n   For\
    \ example, in the Class A IP address \"26.9.0.122\", n=26 h=9, l=0,\n   and i=122.\n\
    \   The different classes of Internet addresses [3] are illustrated\n   below:\n\
    \   Class A:\n   The highest-order bit is set to 0.\n   7-bits define the network\
    \ number.\n   24-bits define the local address.\n   This allows  up to 126 class\
    \ A networks.\n   Networks 0 and 127 are reserved.\n      |       n       |  \

    \            Figure 1\n   Class B:\n   The two highest-order bits are set to 1-0.\n\
    \   14-bits define the network number.\n   16-bits define the local address.\n\

    \                           Figure 3\n   The fourth type of address, class D,\
    \ is used as a multicast address.\n   The four highest-order bits are set to 1-1-1-0.\
    \  Note:  No addresses\n   are allowed with the four highest-order bits set to\
    \ 1-1-1-1.  These\n   addresses, called \"class E\", are reserved.\n   The \"\
    MIL-STD:  X.25\" states \"All DDN addresses are either twelve or\n   fourteen\
    \ BCD (binary-coded decimal) digits in length.\".  The last two\n   digits are\
    \ referred to as the Sub-Address and are not used on the\n   DDN.  The Sub-Address\
    \ is carried across the network without\n   modification.  Its presence is optional.\
    \  Therefore, a DTE may\n   generate EITHER a twelve or fourteen BCD X.121 address,\
    \ but must\n   accept both twelve and fourteen BCD X.121 addresses.\n"

    \   not make use of the PSN's logical addressing feature, which allows\n   hosts\
