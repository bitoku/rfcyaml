- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [CBOR] is a\
    \ compact self-\n   describing binary encoding formation that is starting to be\
    \ used in\n   many different applications.  One of the primary uses of CBOR is\
    \ in\n   the Internet of Things, the constrained nature of which means that\n\
    \   having minimal size of encodings becomes very important.  The\n   Cryptographic\
    \ Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS] is still one of the most\n   common methods for providing\
    \ message-based security, although in many\n   cases, the CBOR Object Signing\
    \ and Encryption (COSE) [COSE] message-\n   based security system is starting\
    \ to be used.  Given that CBOR is\n   going to be transported using CMS, it makes\
    \ sense to define CMS\n   content types for the purpose of denoting that the embedded\
    \ content\n   is CBOR.  This document defines two new content types: CBOR content\n\
    \   type and CBOR Sequence content type [CBOR-SEQ].\n"
- title: 2.  CBOR Content Type
  contents:
  - "2.  CBOR Content Type\n   [CBOR] defines an encoded CBOR item.  This section\
    \ defines a new\n   content type for wrapping an encoded CBOR item in a CMS object.\n\
    \   The following object identifier identifies the CBOR content type:\n   id-ct-cbor\
    \ OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) usa(840)\n           rsadsi(113549)\
    \ pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) smime(16) ct(1) 44 }\n   The CBOR content type is intended\
    \ to refer to a single object encoded\n   using the CBOR encoding format [CBOR].\
    \  Nothing is stated about the\n   specific CBOR object that is included.  CBOR\
    \ can always be decoded to\n   a tree, as the encoding is self descriptive.\n\
    \   The CBOR content type is intended to be encapsulated in the signed\n   data\
    \ and auth-enveloped data, but it can be included in any CMS\n   wrapper.  It\
    \ cannot be predicted whether the compressed CMS\n   encapsulation will provide\
    \ compression, because the content may be\n   binary rather than text.\n   [RFC7193]\
    \ defined an optional parameter, \"innerContent\", to allow for\n   identification\
    \ of what the inner content is for an application/cms\n   media type.  This document\
    \ defines the string \"cbor\" as a new value\n   that can be placed in this parameter\
    \ when a CBOR content type is\n   used.\n"
- title: 3.  CBOR Sequence Content Type
  contents:
  - "3.  CBOR Sequence Content Type\n   [CBOR-SEQ] defines a CBOR Sequence as a concatenation\
    \ of zero or more\n   CBOR objects.  This section defines a new content type for\
    \ wrapping a\n   CBOR Sequence in a CMS object.\n   The following object identifier\
    \ identifies the CBOR Sequence content\n   type:\n   id-ct-cborSequence OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)\n           usa(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)\

    \ is intended to refer to a sequence of\n   objects encoded using the CBOR encoding\
    \ format.  The objects are\n   concatenated without any markers delimiting the\
    \ individual CBOR\n   objects.  Nothing is stated about the specific CBOR objects\
    \ that are\n   included.  CBOR can always be decoded to a tree, because the encoding\n\
    \   is self descriptive.\n   The CBOR Sequence content type is intended to be\

    , to allow for\n   identification of what the inner content is for an application/cms\n\
