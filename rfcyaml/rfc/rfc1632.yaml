    \  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 1994\n\t  A Revised\
    \ Catalog of Available X.500 Implementations\nStatus of this Memo\n   This\tmemo\
    \ provides information for the Internet community.  This memo\n   does\tnot specify\
    \ an Internet\tstandard of any\tkind.  Distribution of\n   this\tmemo is\tunlimited.\n\
    Abstract\n   This\tdocument is the\tresult of a survey that\tgathered new or\t\
    updated\n   descriptions\tof currently available implementations of X.500,\n \
    \  including commercial\tproducts and openly available offerings. This\n   document\
    \ is a revision of RFC 1292. We contacted each contributor in\n   RFC 1292 and\t\
    requested an update and\tpublished the survey template in\n   several mailing\
    \ lists and obtained new product descriptions.\n   This\tdocument contains detailed\
    \ description of twenty six (26) X.500\n   implementations - DSAs, DUAs, and DUA\
    \ interfaces.\n1.  Introduction\n   This\tdocument catalogs currently available\
    \ implementations of X.500,\n   including commercial\tproducts and openly available\
    \ offerings.  For\n   the purposes\tof this\tsurvey,\twe classify X.500 products\
    \ as,\n   DSA\n\tA DSA is an OSI\tapplication process that provides the Directory\n\
    \tfunctionality,\n   DUA\n\tA DUA is an OSI\tapplication process that represents\
    \ a user in\n\taccessing the Directory\tand uses the DAP to communicate\twith\
    \ a\n\tDSA, and\n   DUA Interface\n\tA DUA Interface\tis an application process\
    \ that represents a user\n\tin accessing the Directory using either\tDAP but\t\
    supporting only\n\ta subset of the\tDAP functionality or a protocol\tdifferent\
    \ from\n\tDAP to communicate with\ta DSA or DUA.\n   Section 2 of\tthis document\
    \ contains a listing of implementations\n   cross referenced by keyword.\t This\
    \ list should aid in identifying\n   implementations that\tmeet your criteria.\n\
    \   To compile this catalog, the\tIDS Working Group solicited input from\n   the\
    \ X.500 community by surveying several Internet mailing lists,\n   including:\
    \  iso@nic.ddn.mil,\tisode@nic.ddn.mil, osi-ds@cs.ucl.ac.uk,\n   and ietf-ids@umich.edu.\
    \ We also contacted many people by telephone\n   and sent the\ttemplate to several\
    \ individuals\tand mailed a floppy disk\n   containing the survey template to\
    \ a person who did not have Internet\n   access.\n   Readers are encouraged to\
    \ submit comments regarding both the\tform and\n   content  of\tthis  memo.  New\
    \ submissions are welcome.  Please direct\n   input to  the  Integrated  Directory\t\
    \ Services  (IDS)  Working  Group\n   (ietf-ids@umich.edu)\t or  to\t the editors.\
    \  IDS will\tproduce\tnew ver-\n   sions of this document when a sufficient number\
    \ of changes have  been\n   received.  This will\tbe determined by the IDS chairpersons.\n\
    1.1  Purpose\n   The Internet\thas experienced\ta steady growth\tin X.500 piloting\n\
    \   activities.\tThis document hopes to provide an easily accessible\n   source\
    \ of information on X.500 implementations for those who\twish to\n   consider\
    \ X.500 technology for deploying a Directory service.\n1.2  Scope\n   This\tdocument\
    \ contains descriptions of both free and\tcommercial X.500\n   implementations.\
    \  It\tdoes not provide instructions on how to\tinstall,\n   run,\tor manage these\t\
    implementations.  The descriptions and indices\n   are provided\tto make\tthe\
    \ readers aware of available options and thus\n   enable more informed\tchoices.\n\
    1.3 Disclaimer\n   Implementation descriptions were written by implementors and\t\
    vendors,\n   and not by the editors. We worked with the description authors to\n\
    \   ensure uniformity and readability, but can not guarantee the\taccuracy\n \
    \  or completeness of the descriptions,\tor the stability of the\n   implementations.\n\
    1.4  Overview\n   Section 1 contains introductory information.\n   Section 2 contains\
    \ a\tlist of\tkeywords, their\tdefinitions, and a cross\n   reference of\tthe\
    \ X.500 implementations by these keywords.\n   Section 3 contains the X.500\t\
    implementation descriptions.\n   Section 4 has a list\tof references.\n   Section\
    \ 6 lists the editors'\taddresses.\n1.5  Acknowledgments\n   The creation\tof\
    \ this\tcatalog\twould not have been possible without the\n   efforts of the description\
    \ authors and the members of the IDS Working\n   Group.  Our special thanks to\
    \ the editors of\tRFC 1292, Ruth Lang and\n   Russ\tWright who helped us get started\
    \ and made key suggestions that\n   enabled us to learn from their experience.\
    \ We also acknowledge and\n   appreciate the efforts of Ken Rossen\tin obtaining\
    \ six descriptions.\n2.  Keywords\n   Keywords are\tabbreviated attributes of\
    \ the X.500 implementations.\n   The list of keywords\tdefined\tbelow was derived\
    \ from the\n   implementation descriptions themselves.  Implementations were indexed\n\
    \   by a\tkeyword\teither as a result of: (1) explicit, not implied,\n   reference\
    \ to\ta particular capability\tin the implementation\n   description text, or\t\
    (2) input from the implementation description\n   author(s).\n2.1  Keyword Definitions\n\
    \   This\tsection\tcontains keyword definitions.  They have been organized\n \

    \ OSI Transport, RFC-1006, Sun,\n   UNIX\nABSTRACT\n   The implementation consists\
    \ of a set\tDUA library routines, a\tterminal\n   interface, and a DSA. The implementation\
    \ was\tdeveloped in C on Sun\n   SPARCstations under SunOS 4.1.1. All\tunderlying\
    \ services are\tprovided\n   by the ISODE\tdevelopment package. The development\
    \ package is\talso\n   used\tfor encoding and decoding ASN.1\tdata as\twell as\t\
    for other data\n   manipulation\tservices. Using\tthe ISODE package the implementation\
    \ can\n   be run over both TCP/IP and OSI protocols.\n   The DSA provides full\
    \ support for both DAP and DSP protocols,\n   conformant with ISO 9594 / CCITT\
    \ X.500 standards. The DIB is\n   maintained using a locally developed\trelational\
    \ database system. The\n   interface to\tthe database system consists of\ta set\
    \ of sql-like C\n   functions.  These are designed to allow straightforward replacement\n\
    \   of the local\tdatabase system\twith a more powerful commercial\tsystem.\n\
    \   To achieve better performance several options are supported that\n   permit\
    \ loading of selected portions of the database in core.\tWhen\n   these options\
    \ are selected data can be retrieved more quickly from in\n   core\ttables;\t\
    all modifications to the DIB are directly reflected in\n   the in core tables\
    \ and the database.\nCOMPLIANCE (applicable only for\tDSAs and DUAs)\n   Custos\

    \ (Directory Enquiries) is intended\tto be a\tsimple-to-use DUA\n   interface,\
    \ suitable for the naive user, and suitable\tfor running as a\n   public access\

    \ of (verbose)\tprompts\tasking for person's\n   name; department; organization;\
    \ country.  There is extensive\ton-line\n   help.  The matching algorithms are\
    \ such that\tnear matches are\n   presented to\tthe user before\tless good matches.\n\
    \   A lot of development\thas been done on the interface since it\twas\n   first\
    \ described in RFC1292.\tThe most significant enhancement has\n   been\tto add\
    \ power searching - this allows a user to search for an\n   entry even when they\t\
    do not know the\tname of\tthe organisation in\n   which the person works - you\t\
    still have to specify the country.  DE\n   now provides\tUFN style searching.\
    \  It is now\tpossible to search\n   locality entries.  DE now uses slightly different\
    \ search algorithms\n   depending on\twhether\tit is accessing\tpart of\tthe Directory\
    \ mastered\n   by a\tQuipu DSA - Quipu DSAs tend to use lots\tof replication and\
    \ so\n   encourage searching.\t An experimental feature is intended to\tgive the\n\
    \   user\tmore feedback on the likely response time to a query - DE\n   maintains\
    \ a database\tof past\tinformation availability and DSA\n   responsiveness.  Translations\
    \ exist into at least 4 different\n   languages.\n   DE runs over\tISODE DAP and\

    \ When forwarding user's requests to\tthe OSI\n   Directory, the protocol used\t\
    is known as the\tDirectory Access\n   Protocol (DAP).\n   The DSA will\tnegotiate\
    \ with other, remote DSAs to obtain requested\n   information or to update remote\

    \   LDAP\tis the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.  It gives\tX.500\n   access\
    \ to platforms that have only TCP/IP access, using simplified\n   BER encoding\t\
    of many\tX.500 data elements.  LDAP is currently\ta\n   proposed Internet Standard.\t\
    The LDAP server\tis an intermediate\n   protocol server that\tcommunicates with\
    \ Internet clients on one side\n   using the simple TCP-based LDAP protocol and\t\
    an X.500 DSA on\tthe\n   other side using the\tDirectory Access Protocol (DAP).\
    \  A subset of\n   the X.500 DAP is exported to\tthe clients through the\tLDAP\
    \ protocol.\n   The U-M LDAP\tdistribution contains the following components:\n\
    \   - LDAP server\n   - LDAP client library, including both synchronous and asynchronous\
    \ APIs\n   - Lightweight BER library, including\tan API that supports\n     a\
    \ printf/scanf-like interface\n   - Various LDAP client programs, including a\
    \ finger daemon (xfingerd),\n     gopher to X.500 gateway (go500gw),\tcommand-line\
    \ DUA (ud), e-mail\n     query server (rcpt500), and an X.500 mailer (mail500)\n\
    COMPLIANCE (applicable only for\tDSAs and DUAs)\n   The U-M LDAP\tdistribution\
    \ is\ta complete implementation of the LDAP\n   protocol.  The LDAP protocol\t\
    does not support access\tto all X.500\n   features and\toperations.  The operations\
    \ supported are bind,\tsearch,\n   compare, add, delete, modify, modify\tRDN,\
    \ and abandon.  Note\tthat\n   read\tand list operations can\tbe emulated using\
    \ the search operation.\n   Size\tand time limits\tmay be specified, as may alias\
    \ dereferencing and\n   searching, but all X.500 service controls are not supported.\n\

    \ 1487], and [RFC 1274].\nCONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL\tRFCs\n\
    \   Preliminary support is included for [RFC 1484].\nINTEROPERABILITY\n   The\
    \ current implementation of the LDAP server is known to work with\n   the QUIPU\
    \ DSA and DAP library.\nPILOT CONNECTIVITY\n   DUA connectivity should be possible\
    \ to all pilots, though only\n   AARNET, PARADISE, and PSI White Pages Project\
    \ have actually been\n   tried.\nBUGS\n   Bug reports should be sent to bug-ldap@umich.edu.\n\

    completeness.\nINTERNETWORKING\tENVIRONMENT\n   LDAP\tclients\tuse TCP\tto communicate\
    \ with the\tLDAP server.  The LDAP\n   server normally uses\tRFC 1006 with TCP/IP\
    \ to\tcommunicate with the\n   DSA,\tthough any other transport mechanism for\
    \ DSA communication\n   supported by\tISODE should be\tpossible.\nHARDWARE PLATFORMS\n\
    \   The LDAP server is known to run on Sun 3 and\tSun 4 platforms\tDEC's,\n  \
    \ HP's, and RS\t6000's.\t The LDAP client libraries and some clients have\n  \

    \ derived from\tthe earlier\n   openly available version of QUIPU, and will be\
    \ used as base\n   technology for products by a\tnumber of vendors. The release\
    \ comprises\n   of a\tDSA, and a number of sample DUAs which may be used in\n\
    \   conjunction with the\tDSA.\nCOMPLIANCE (applicable only for\tDSAs and DUAs)\n\
    \   The DSA is aligned to the 1988 ISO IS and the NIST OIW Directory\n   Implementors\t\
    Guide Version 1, with the following exceptions:\n   - Strong authentication is\
    \ not implemented (but hooks are\n     provided for use with two packages).\n\
    \   - QUIPU does\tnot enforce the\tbounds constraints on attributes,\n     filters\
    \ or\tAPDU size.\n   - T.61 string formatting characters are not rejected.\n \
    \  - If\ta DN is\tsupplied with no password in an\tunprotected simple bind,\n\
    \     QUIPU does\tnot always check to see\tif the DN exists. If the DSA\n    \
    \ connected to can say authoritatively the DN does not exist, the\n     association\
    \ is rejected. However, if a chain operation is required\n     to\tcheck the DN,\
    \ the bind IS allowed.\n   - When comparing attributes of UTCtime syntax, if the\
    \ seconds field\n     is\tomitted, QUIPU does not\tperform\tthe match correctly\
    \ (i.e., the\n     seconds field in the attribute values should be ignored, but\
    \ are\n     not).\n   - QUIPU always supplies the optional\tChaining argument\n\
    \     \"originator\" even if the CommonArgument \"requestor\" is used.\n   - QUIPU\
    \ always supplies the optional\tChaining argument \"target\"\n     even if the\
    \ base object in\tthe DAP\targuments is the same.\n   - The object\tclass \"without\
    \ an assigned object identifier\" is\n     not recognised unless the \"alias\"\
    \ object class is also present.\n   - Non Specific Subordinate References are\
    \ never followed by a QUIPU\n     DSA, but they are passed on correctly to the\
    \ client if generated.\n   Compliance with X.500(1993) standards is planned. DAP\
    \ and replication\n   (DISP) will be available in March 1994. Other 1993 features,\t\

    a VALUE\tproject\twith aim to pilot a\n     European security infrastructure for\
    \ network applications.\n   - Access control: private mechanisms\tare provided\
    \ to\tallow access\n     control lists to be specified for parts of\tthe DIT,\
    \ to control\n     modifications, and\tto specify access restrictions on attributes.\n\
    \   - Management: a UCOM.X DSA object has been defined to allow\n     operational\
    \ parameters of the DSA to be managed via DAP.\n     Administration utilities\
    \ are provided to, e.g., generate usage\n     statistics\tand periodically update\t\

    \   The product offers a\tC language API conformant to X/Open's X/DS\n   specification,\
    \ and a\tC++ API\t(for release 10/93).\n   The DUAs include a graphical\tdirectory\
    \ browser with powerful\tsearch\n   functionality for OpenLook and Motif, and\
    \ a full-screen curses-based\n   interface with full DAP functionality.\n   TS-E3X's\
    \ strategy for UCOM.X500 is three-fold: Firstly, to use it as\n   the directory\
    \ service for Spheris, France Telecom's range of\n   electronic mail products\
    \ based on X.400 (88)\t(release mid '94).\n   Secondly, to\toffer it to third\
    \ parties developing specific\n   applications\tusing X.500: current applications\
    \ include a distributed\n   application to control document transfer in a large\
    \ French hospital\n   and distributed applications\tmanagement in the French Post\
    \ Office;\n   planned uses\tinclude\toffice applications for\tcontrol\tof document\n\
    \   circulation (workflow) and cooperative document editing. Thirdly, to\n   offer\
    \ it to telecomms operators such\tas France Telecom for\n   application in network\
    \ management. UCOM.X 500 is used extensively by\n   French research centers involved\
    \ in PARADISE.\nCOMPLIANCE (applicable only for\tDSAs and DUAs)\n   UCOM.X 500\
    \ conforms to X.500\t(88) as\tspecified in paragraph 9 of\n   X.519.\n   Development\
    \ of the product based on X.500 (93) is planned for '94\n   with\trelease\tof\
    \ a product conformant\tto the principal extensions at\n   the end of '94. Emphasis\
    \ is being placed on the shadowing protocol,\n   the schema and access control.\n\
    CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS\n   The COSINE and Internet Schema\
    \ (RFC 1274) is\tsupported with minor\n   exceptions.\n   The string representation\
    \ of\tPSAPs and their\tinternal encoding\n   conforms to RFC 1277.\n   The string\
    \ representation of\tDNs will migrate to the\tInternet RFC\n   1485\tdefinition.\n\
    CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL\tRFCs\n   RFC 1279 (X.500 and\
    \ Domains)\tis supported. The string representation\n   of PSAPs and\ttheir internal\
    \ encoding\tconforms to RFC\t1278.\n   AFRO\t(algorithme francais de\trecherche\
    \ optimise), the search\t/ name\n   resolution algorithm\tproposed by UCOM.X 500,\t\
    differs\tfrom the UFN\n   algorithm principally in that it attempts to\toptimize\
    \ by performing\n   read\toperations before resorting to searches\tin order to\
    \ exploit the\n   name\terror information.\nINTEROPERABILITY\n   Through UCOM.X\
    \ 500's\tuse in the French PARADISE pilot,\n   interoperability has\tbeen informally\t\
    but extensively\ttested with\n   Quipu and other implementations.\n   Detailed\
    \ interoperability tests  with Quipu,\tMarben and  Siemens/Bull\n   DIR/X are\
    \ being conducted by\t the PARADISE OIFP (Operational\n   Interworking) team at\
    \ INRIA Rocquencourt, France.\n   The product\tis currently also undergoing  formal\
    \ tests for\n   conformance to the CTS2  DSA/DAP and\t ACSE/Presentation/Session\n\
    \   specifications  at the  French OSI conformance test centre.\nPILOT CONNECTIVITY\n\
    \   DSA and DUA connectivity to the PARADISE pilot.\nBUGS\n   UCOM.X 500 is a\
    \ commercial product. As such,\tit is supported\tand bugs\n   are fixed when detected.\
    \ Bug\treports\tcan be sent to our support team\n   via electronic mail.\nCAVEATS\t\
    AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS\n   The DIT structure and inverted attribute tables are\
    \ stored in main\n   memory. The recommended main\tmemory size for\ta DSA is 1\
    \ kb per node,\n   i.e., 10 Mb for a database of 10,000\tobjects. The current\
    \ recommended\n   maximum is a\tdatabase size of the order of 100,000 objects.\n\
    \   Of the selected attribute types defined in X.500 (88), the\n   searchGuide\
    \ attribute is not\tsupported ; neither are\tthe following\n   attributes from\
    \ the Cosine and Internet Schema (RFC 1274):\n   OtherMailbox, MailPreferenceOption\
    \ and the various quality\n   attributes.\n   The X/DS API\tsupports the Basic\
    \ Directory Contents (BDCP), the MHS\n   Directory User (MDUP) and the Strong\t\
    Authentication (SAP) packages\n   with\tminor limitations. A proprietary mechanism\
    \ for defining\tnew\n   classes and attributes is offered. Asynchronous operations\
    \ and\n   multiple concurrent sessions\tare not\tsupported. Whilst referral may\n\
    \   be handled automatically, continuation references are not.\nINTERNETWORKING\t\
