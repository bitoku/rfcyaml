- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In an MPLS network, it is possible to carry the Protocol\
    \ Data Units\n   (PDUs) of layer 2 protocols by prepending an MPLS label stack\
    \ to\n   these PDUs.  This document specifies the necessary label distribution\n\
    \   procedures for accomplishing this using the encapsulation methods in\n   [RFC4905].\
    \  We restrict discussion to the case of point-to-point\n   transport.  Quality\
    \ of service (QoS)-related issues are not discussed\n   in this document.  This\
    \ document describes methods for transporting a\n   number of protocols; in some\
    \ cases, transporting a particular\n   protocol may have several modes of operation.\
    \  Each of these\n   protocols and/or modes may be implemented independently.\n\
    \   An accompanying document [CEM] also describes a method for\n   transporting\
    \ time division multiplexed (TDM) digital signals (TDM\n   circuit emulation)\
    \ over a packet-oriented MPLS network.  The\n   transmission system for circuit-oriented\
    \ TDM signals is the\n   Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) [ANSI.T1.105] / Synchronous\n\
    \   Digital Hierarchy (SDH) [ITU.G.707].  To support TDM traffic, which\n   includes\
    \ voice, data, and private leased line service, the MPLS\n   network must emulate\
    \ the circuit characteristics of SONET/SDH\n   payloads.  MPLS labels and a new\
    \ circuit emulation header are used to\n   encapsulate TDM signals and provide\
    \ the Circuit Emulation Service\n   over MPLS (CEM).\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Special Note\n   This document describes the so-called \"draft-martini\"\
    \ protocol, which\n   is used in many deployed implementations.  This document\
    \ and its\n   contents have since been superseded by the Pseudowire Emulation\

    \  This document serves as a documentation of\n   current implementations, and\
    \ MUST NOT be used for new\n   implementations.  The PWE3 Label Distribution Protocol\
    \ (LDP) control\n   document [RFC4447], which is backward compatible with this\
    \ document,\n   MUST be used for all new implementations of this protocol.\n"
- title: 4.  Tunnel Labels and Virtual Circuit (VC) Labels
  contents:
  - "4.  Tunnel Labels and Virtual Circuit (VC) Labels\n   Suppose it is desired to\
    \ transport layer 2 PDUs from ingress Label\n   Switching Router (LSR) R1 to egress\
    \ LSR R2, across an intervening\n   MPLS network.  We assume that there is a Label\
    \ Switched Path (LSP)\n   from R1 to R2.  That is, we assume that R1 can cause\
    \ a packet to be\n   delivered to R2 by pushing some label onto the packet and\
    \ sending the\n   result to one of its adjacencies.  Call this label the \"tunnel\n\
    \   label\", and the corresponding LSP the \"tunnel LSP\".\n   The tunnel LSP\
    \ merely gets packets from R1 to R2; the corresponding\n   label doesn't tell\
    \ R2 what to do with the payload.  In fact, if\n   penultimate hop popping is\
    \ used, R2 may never even see the\n   corresponding label.  (If R1 itself is the\
    \ penultimate hop, a tunnel\n   label may not even get pushed on.)  Thus, if the\
    \ payload is not an IP\n   packet, there must be a label, which becomes visible\
    \ to R2, that\n   tells R2 how to treat the received packet.  Call this label\
    \ the \"VC\n   label\".\n   So when R1 sends a layer 2 PDU to R2, it first pushes\
    \ a VC label on\n   its label stack, and then (if R1 is not adjacent to R2) pushes\
    \ on a\n   tunnel label.  The tunnel label gets the MPLS packet from R1 to R2;\n\
    \   the VC label is not visible until the MPLS packet reaches R2.  R2's\n   disposition\
    \ of the packet is based on the VC label.\n   Note that the tunnel could be a\
    \ Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)-\n   encapsulated MPLS tunnel between R1\
    \ and R2.  In this case, R1 would\n   be adjacent to R2, and only the VC label\
    \ would be used, and the\n   intervening network need only carry IP packets.\n\
    \   If the payload of the MPLS packet is, for example, an ATM AAL5 PDU,\n   the\
    \ VC label will generally correspond to a particular ATM VC at R2.\n   That is,\
    \ R2 needs to be able to infer from the VC label the outgoing\n   interface and\
    \ the VPI/VCI (Virtual Path Identifier / Virtual Circuit\n   Identifier) value\
    \ for the AAL5 PDU.  If the payload is a Frame Relay\n   PDU, then R2 needs to\
    \ be able to infer from the VC label the outgoing\n   interface and the DLCI (Data\
    \ Link Connection Identifier) value.  If\n   the payload is an Ethernet frame,\
    \ then R2 needs to be able to infer\n   from the VC label the outgoing interface,\
    \ and perhaps the VLAN\n   identifier.  This process is unidirectional, and will\
    \ be repeated\n   independently for bidirectional operation.  It is REQUIRED to\
    \ assign\n   the same VC ID, and VC type for a given circuit in both directions.\n\
    \   The group ID (see below) MUST NOT be required to match in both\n   directions.\
    \  The transported frame MAY be modified when it reaches\n   the egress router.\
    \  If the header of the transported layer 2 frame is\n   modified, this MUST be\
    \ done at the egress LSR only.\n   Note that the VC label must always be at the\
    \ bottom of the label\n   stack, and the tunnel label, if present, must be immediately\
    \ above\n   the VC label.  Of course, as the packet is transported across the\n\
    \   MPLS network, additional labels may be pushed on (and then popped\n   off)\
    \ as needed.  Even R1 itself may push on additional labels above\n   the tunnel\
    \ label.  If R1 and R2 are directly adjacent LSRs, then it\n   may not be necessary\
    \ to use a tunnel label at all.\n   This document does not specify a method for\
    \ distributing the tunnel\n   label or any other labels that may appear above\
    \ the VC label on the\n   stack.  Any acceptable method of MPLS label distribution\
    \ will do.\n   This document does specify a method for assigning and distributing\n\
    \   the VC label.  Static label assignment MAY be used, and\n   implementations\
    \ SHOULD provide support for this.  When signaling is\n   used, the VC label MUST\
    \ be distributed from R2 to R1 using LDP in the\n   downstream unsolicited mode;\
    \ this requires that an LDP session be\n   created between R1 and R2.  It should\
    \ be noted that this LDP session\n   is not necessarily transported along the\
    \ same path as the Layer 2\n   PDUs [RFC3036].  In addition, when using LDP to\
    \ distribute the VC\n   label, liberal label retention mode SHOULD be used.  However,\
    \ as\n   required in [RFC3036], the label request operation (mainly used by\n\
    \   conservative label retention mode) MUST be implemented.  VC labels\n   MUST\
    \ be allocated from the per-platform label space.\n   Note that this technique\
    \ allows an unbounded number of layer 2 \"VCs\"\n   to be carried together in\
    \ a single \"tunnel\".  Thus, it scales quite\n   well in the network backbone.\n\
    \   While this document currently defines the emulation of Frame Relay\n   and\
    \ ATM Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC) services, it specifically\n   does not preclude\
    \ future enhancements to support switched service\n   (Switched Virtual Circuit\
    \ (SVC) and Switched Permanent Virtual\n   Circuit (SPVC)) emulation.\n"

    \ of the VC ID field and the interface parameters field in\n        octets.  If\

    \ ID, and there is no VC ID present, nor any\n        interface parameters.\n\
    \      - Group ID\n        An arbitrary 32-bit value, which represents a group\
    \ of VCs that\n        is used to create groups in the VC space.  The group ID\
    \ is\n        intended to be used as a port index, or a virtual tunnel index.\n\
    \        To simplify configuration, a particular VC ID at ingress could\n    \
    \    be part of the virtual tunnel for transport to the egress\n        router.\
    \  The group ID is very useful to send wild card label\n        withdrawals to\
    \ remote LSRs upon physical port failure.\n      - VC ID\n        A non-zero 32-bit\
    \ connection ID that, together with the VC type,\n        identifies a particular\
    \ VC.\n      - Interface parameters\n        This variable length field is used\

  contents:
  - "6.2.2.  VC Types for Which the Control Word is NOT Mandatory\n   If a system\
    \ is capable of sending and receiving the control word on\n   VC types for which\
    \ the control word is not mandatory, then each such\n   VC endpoint MUST be configurable\
    \ with a parameter that specifies\n   whether the use of the control word is PREFERRED\
    \ or NOT PREFERRED.\n   For each VC, there MUST be a default value of this parameter.\
    \  This\n   specification does NOT state what the default value should be.\n \
    \  If a system is NOT capable of sending and receiving the control word\n   on\
    \ VC types for which the control word is not mandatory, then it\n   behaves exactly\
    \ as if it were configured for the use of the control\n   word to be NOT PREFERRED.\n\
    \   If a Label Mapping message for the VC has already been received, but\n   no\
    \ Label Mapping message for the VC has yet been sent, then the\n   procedure is\
    \ the following:\n     -i. If the received Label Mapping message has c=0, send\
    \ a Label\n         Mapping message with c=0, and the control word is not used.\n\
    \    -ii. If the received Label Mapping message has c=1, and the VC is\n     \
    \    locally configured such that the use of the control word is\n         preferred,\
    \ then send a Label Mapping message with c=1, and the\n         control word is\
    \ used.\n   -iii. If the received Label Mapping message has c=1, and the VC is\n\
    \         locally configured such that the use of the control word is not\n  \
    \       preferred or the control word is not supported, then act as if\n     \
    \    no Label Mapping message for the VC had been received (i.e.,\n         proceed\
    \ to the next paragraph).\n   If a Label Mapping message for the VC has not already\
    \ been received\n   (or if the received Label Mapping message had c=1, and either\
    \ local\n   configuration says that the use of the control word is not preferred\n\
    \   or the control word is not supported), then send a Label Mapping\n   message\
    \ in which the c bit is set to correspond to the locally\n   configured preference\
    \ for use of the control word.  (That is, set c=1\n   if locally configured to\
    \ prefer the control word, set c=0 if locally\n   configured to prefer not to\
    \ use the control word or if the control\n   word is not supported).\n   The next\
    \ action depends on what control message is next received for\n   that VC.  The\
    \ possibilities are:\n     -i. A Label Mapping message with the same c bit value\
    \ as specified\n         in the Label Mapping message that was sent.  VC setup\
    \ is now\n         complete, and the control word is used if c=1 but not used\
    \ if\n         c=0.\n    -ii. A Label Mapping message with c=1, but the Label\
    \ Mapping message\n         that was sent has c=0.  In this case, ignore the received\
    \ Label\n         Mapping message, and continue to wait for the next control\n\
    \         message for the VC.\n   -iii. A Label Mapping message with c=0, but\
    \ the Label Mapping message\n         that was sent has c=1.  In this case, send\
    \ a Label Withdraw\n         message with a \"Wrong C-bit\" status code, followed\
    \ by a Label\n         Mapping message that has c=0.  VC setup is now complete,\
    \ and\n         the control word is not used.\n    -iv. A Label Withdraw message\
    \ with the \"Wrong C-bit\" status code.\n         Treat as a normal Label Withdraw,\
    \ but do not respond.  Continue\n         to wait for the next control message\
    \ for the VC.\n   If, at any time after a Label Mapping message has been received,\
    \ a\n   corresponding Label Withdraw or Release is received, the action taken\n\
    \   is the same as for any Label Withdraw or Release that might be\n   received\
    \ at any time.\n   If both endpoints prefer the use of the control word, this\
    \ procedure\n   will cause it to be used.  If either endpoint prefers not to use\
    \ the\n   control word, or does not support the control word, this procedure\n\
    \   will cause it not to be used.  If one endpoint prefers to use the\n   control\
    \ word but the other does not, the one that prefers not to use\n   it is has no\
    \ extra protocol to execute; it just waits for a Label\n   Mapping message that\
    \ has c=0.\n   The following diagram illustrates the above procedures:\n     \

- title: 6.4.1.  Label Mapping Advertisements
  contents:
  - "6.4.1.  Label Mapping Advertisements\n   After a label has been withdrawn by\
    \ the disposition router and/or\n   released by the imposition router, care must\
    \ be taken to not re-\n   advertise (reuse) the released label until the disposition\
    \ router can\n   be reasonably certain that old packets containing the released\
    \ label\n   no longer persist in the MPLS network.\n   This precaution is required\
    \ to prevent the imposition router from\n   restarting packet forwarding with\
    \ sequence number of 1 when it\n   receives the same label mapping if there are\
    \ still older packets\n   persisting in the network with sequence number between\
    \ 1 and 32768.\n   For example, if there is a packet with sequence number=n where\
    \ n is\n   in the interval[1,32768] traveling through the network, it would be\n\
    \   possible for the disposition router to receive that packet after it\n   re-advertises\
    \ the label.  Since the label has been released by the\n   imposition router,\
    \ the disposition router SHOULD be expecting the\n   next packet to arrive with\
    \ sequence number of 1.  Receipt of a packet\n   with sequence number equal to\
    \ n will result in n packets potentially\n   being rejected by the disposition\
    \ router until the imposition router\n   imposes a sequence number of n+1 into\
    \ a packet.  Possible methods to\n   avoid this are for the disposition router\
    \ to always advertise a\n   different VC label, or for the disposition router\
    \ to wait for a\n   sufficient time before attempting to re-advertise a recently\
    \ released\n   label.  This is only an issue when sequence number processing at\
    \ the\n   disposition router is enabled.\n"

    \ label\n   mapping request to the disposition router.  When sequencing is\n \
