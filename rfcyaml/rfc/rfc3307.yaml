  title: 1. Terminology
- contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   This document specifies guidelines that MUST be implemented
    by any\n   entity responsible for allocating IPv6 multicast addresses.  This\n
    \  includes, but is not limited to, any documents or entities wishing to\n   assign
    permanent IPv6 multicast addresses, allocate dynamic IPv6\n   multicast addresses,
    and define permanent IPv6 multicast group\n   identifiers.  The purpose of these
    guidelines is to reduce the\n   probability of IPv6 multicast address collision,
    not only at the IPv6\n   layer, but also at the link-layer of media that encode
    portions of\n   the IP layer address into the link-layer address.\n   With the
    current IPv6 address architecture [ADDRARCH] and the\n   extension to the multicast
    address architecture specified in\n   [UNIMCAST], a set of guidelines is needed
    for entities assigning any\n   flavor of IPv6 multicast addresses.\n   The current
    approach of several physical media [RFC 2464][RFC 2467]\n   is to map a portion
    of the IPv6 multicast address into a link-layer\n   destination address.  This
    is accomplished by taking the low order 32\n   bits (henceforth called the group
    ID) of the IPv6 multicast address\n   and including them in the link-layer destination
    address.  Group IDs,\n   less than or equal to, 32 bits long will generate unique
    link-layer\n   addresses within a given multicast scope.\n   These guidelines
    specify how the group ID of the IPv6 multicast\n   address are chosen and assigned.
    \ The guidelines specify several\n   mechanisms that can be used to determine
    the group ID of the\n   multicast address, based on the type of allocation being
    done.\n"
  title: 2. Introduction
- contents:
  - "3. Applicability\n   These guidelines are designed to be used in any environment
    in which\n   IPv6 multicast addresses are delegated, assigned, or selected.  These\n
    \  guidelines are not limited to use by MADCAP [RFC 2730] servers.  The\n   following
    is a non-exhaustive list of applications of these\n   guidelines:\n      -  Source-specific
    multicast application servers can generate an\n         SSM group address by generating
    a 96-bit multicast prefix, as\n         defined in [UNIMCAST] (i.e. FF3x::/96)
    and concatenating that\n         with a group ID, as defined in this document.\n
    \     -  A MADCAP server allocates IPv6 multicast addresses conforming\n         to
    section 2.7 of [ADDRARCH], creating the group ID using the\n         rules defined
    in this document.\n      -  Nodes supplying multicast services in a zeroconf environment\n
    \        generate multicast addresses without the need of centralized\n         control.\n
    \     -  IANA can assign permanent multicast addresses to fulfill\n         requests
    via the protocol standardization process.\n"
  title: 3. Applicability
- contents:
  - "4. Group ID Selection Guidelines\n   The Group ID selection process allows for
    three types of multicast\n   address assignments.  These are permanent IPv6 multicast
    addresses,\n   dynamic IPv6 multicast addresses, and permanent IPv6 multicast
    group\n   IDs.  The following guidelines assume that the prefix of the\n   multicast
    address has been initialized according to [ADDRARCH] or\n   [UNIMCAST].\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1  Permanent IPv6 Multicast Addresses\n   Permanent multicast addresses,
      like those defined in [RFC 2375], are\n   allocated by IANA.  These addresses
      will be assigned with group ID's,\n   in the range of 0x00000001 to 0x3FFFFFFF,
      on an Expert Review basis.\n   Multicast addresses assigned by IANA MUST have
      the T bit set to 0 and\n   the P bit set to 0.\n"
    title: 4.1  Permanent IPv6 Multicast Addresses
  - contents:
    - "4.2  Permanent IPv6 Multicast Group Identifiers\n   Permanent group IDs allow
      for a global identifier of a particular\n   service (e.g. Network Time Protocol
      (NTP) being assigned the group ID\n   0x40404040).  The use of permanent group
      IDs differs from permanent\n   multicast addresses in that a permanent group
      ID offers a global\n   identifier for a service being offered by numerous servers.\n
      \  As an example, consider the NTP example group ID of 0x40404040.  An\n   NTP
      client would be able to access multiple servers and multiple\n   scopes.  That
      is, the NTP client will know that the group ID\n   0x40404040 identifies an
      NTP multicast stream regardless of the upper\n   96 bits of the multicast address.\n
      \  Permanent group IDs are allocated on an Expert Review basis, in the\n   range
      0x40000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF.  These permanent group IDs are meant\n   to be used
      in IPv6 multicast addresses, defined in [UNIMCAST].\n"
    title: 4.2  Permanent IPv6 Multicast Group Identifiers
  - contents:
    - "4.3  Dynamic IPv6 Multicast Addresses\n   Dynamic IPv6 multicast addresses
      can be allocated by an allocation\n   server or by an end-host.  Regardless
      of the allocation mechanism,\n   all dynamically allocated IPv6 multicast addresses
      MUST have the T\n   bit set to 1.  This will distinguish the dynamically allocated\n
      \  addresses from the permanently assigned multicast addresses, defined\n   in
      [RFC 2375], at the link-layer on any media that maps the lower\n   portion of
      the IPv6 multicast address into a link-layer address.  It\n   should be noted
      that the high-order bit of the Group ID will be the\n   same value as the T
      flag.\n   As an example, the permanent IPv6 multicast address FF02::9 maps to\n
      \  an Ethernet group address of 33-33-00-00-00-09.  A dynamically\n   allocated
      IPv6 multicast address of FF32::8000:9 would map to the\n   Ethernet group address
      33-33-80-00-00-09.\n"
    - contents:
      - "4.3.1 Server Allocation\n   The allocation of IPv6 multicast addresses, by
        a server, is defined\n   in [RFC 2730].  Address management is the responsibility
        of the\n   allocation protocol and outside the scope of this document.\n   Allocation
        servers MUST use the group ID range 0x80000000 to\n   0xFFFFFFFF.\n"
      title: 4.3.1 Server Allocation
    - contents:
      - "4.3.2 Host Allocation\n   Host-based allocation allows hosts to self-select
        IPv6 multicast\n   addresses.  One example of host-based allocation is the
        Zeroconf\n   Multicast Address Allocation Protocol [ZMAAPDOC].  Issues with\n
        \  collision detection, claim notification, etc. are outside the scope\n   of
        this document and the responsibility of the protocol being used,\n   such
        as [ZMAAPDOC].\n   The group ID portion of the address is created using either
        a\n   pseudo-random 32-bit number or a 32-bit number created using the\n   guidelines
        in [RFC 1750].  The generated group ID MUST fall in the\n   range 0x80000000
        to 0xFFFFFFFF.  This can be accomplished by setting\n   the high-order bit
        of the generated number to 1.\n"

  - "5. IANA Considerations\n   This document requests the creation of a new registry
    maintained by\n   IANA.  This new registry will maintain permanent group ID values.
    The\n   premise of this new registry is to allow for permanent group IDs to\n
    \  be used across multiple domains utilizing the multicast address\n   architecture
    defined in [UNIMCAST].  The permanent group IDs will\n   fall in the range 0x40000000
    to 0x7FFFFFFF.\n   In addition, this document also defines rules for the allocation
    of\n   permanent IPv6 multicast addresses by IANA.  These rules specify\n   different
    ranges for multicast addresses that are IPv6-only and for\n   IPv6 multicast addresses
    that have corresponding IPv4 multicast\n   addresses.\n   Following the policies
    outlined in [RFC 2434]:\n      -  Permanent IPv6 multicast addresses with corresponding
    IPv4\n         multicast addresses, like those defined in [RFC 2375], are\n         allocated
    with group ID's in the range of 1 to 0x3FFFFFFF on an\n         Expert Review
    basis, see Section 4.1.\n      -  Permanent IPv6-only multicast addresses are
    allocated with\n         group ID's in the range 0x100 to 0x3FFFFFFF on an Expert
    Review\n         basis.\n      -  Permanent group ID's are allocated on an Expert
    Review basis in\n         the range 0x40000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF, see Section 4.2.\n
    \     -  The range 0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF is reserved for use by\n         dynamic
    multicast address allocation mechanisms, see Section\n         4.3.\n   All approved
    requests for a permanent IPv6 multicast address will\n   result in the assignment
    of a unique group ID which shall be reserved\n   in all valid IPv6 multicast scopes.\n"
  title: 5. IANA Considerations

  - "6. Security Considerations\n   The allocation mechanisms described in this document
    do not alter the\n   security properties of either the Any Source or Source Specific\n
    \  multicast service models of IPv4 and IPv6.\n   The potential to allocate large
    blocks of addresses can lead to\n   Denial-of-Service attacks.  A more in-depth
    discussion of the\n   security issues surrounding dynamic allocation of multicast
    addresses\n   can be found in [RFC 2908].\n"
