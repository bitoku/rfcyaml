- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A tag is a type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [1]\
    \ designed to\n   meet the following requirements:\n   1.  Identifiers are likely\
    \ to be unique across space and time, and\n       come from a practically inexhaustible\
    \ supply.\n   2.  Identifiers are relatively convenient for humans to mint\n \
    \      (create), read, type, remember etc.\n   3.  No central registration is\
    \ necessary, at least for holders of\n       domain names or email addresses;\
    \ and there is negligible cost to\n       mint each new identifier.\n   4.  The\
    \ identifiers are independent of any particular resolution\n       scheme.\n \
    \  For example, the above requirements may apply in the case of a user\n   who\
    \ wants to place identifiers on their documents:\n   a.  The user wants to be\
    \ reasonably sure that the identifier is\n       unique.  Global uniqueness is\
    \ valuable because it prevents\n       identifiers from becoming unintentionally\
    \ ambiguous.\n   b.  The identifiers should be tractable to the user, who should,\
    \ for\n       example, be able to mint new identifiers conveniently, to\n    \
    \   memorise them, and to type them into emails and forms.\n   c.  The user does\
    \ not want to have to communicate with anyone else in\n       order to mint identifiers\
    \ for their documents.\n   d.  The user wants to avoid identifiers that might\
    \ be taken to imply\n       the existence of an electronic resource accessible\
    \ via a default\n       resolution mechanism, when no such electronic resource\
    \ exists.\n   Existing identification schemes satisfy some, but not all, of the\n\
    \   requirements above.  For example:\n   UUIDs [5], [6] are hard for humans to\
    \ read.\n   OIDs [7], [8] and Digital Object Identifiers [9] require entities\
    \ to\n   register as naming authorities, even in cases where the entity\n   already\
    \ holds a domain name registration.\n   URLs (in particular, \"http\" URLs) are\
    \ sometimes used as identifiers\n   that satisfy most of the above requirements.\
    \  Many users and\n   organisations have already registered a domain name, and\
    \ the use of\n   the domain name to mint identifiers comes at no additional cost.\
    \  But\n   there are drawbacks to URLs-as-identifiers:\n   o  An attempt may be\
    \ made to resolve a URL-as-identifier, even though\n      there is no resource\
    \ accessible at the \"location\".\n   o  Domain names change hands and the new\
    \ assignee of a domain name\n      can't be sure that they are minting new names.\
    \  For example, if\n      example.org is assigned first to a user Smith and then\
    \ to a user\n      Jones, there is no systematic way for Jones to tell whether\
    \ Smith\n      has already used a particular identifier such as\n      http://example.org/9999.\n\
    \   o  Entities could rely on purl.org or a similar service as a\n      (first-come,\
    \ first-served) assigner of unique URIs; but a solution\n      without reliance\
    \ upon another entity such as the Online Computer\n      Library Center (OCLC,\
    \ which runs purl.org) may be preferable.\n   Lastly, many entities -- especially\
    \ individuals -- are assignees of\n   email addresses but not domain names.  It\
    \ would be preferable to\n   enable those entities to mint unique identifiers.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Tag Syntax and Rules\n   This section first specifies the syntax of tag URIs\
    \ and gives\n   examples.  It then describes a set of rules for minting tags that\
    \ is\n   designed to make them unique.  Finally, it discusses the resolution\n\
    \   and comparison of tags.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Tag Syntax and Examples
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Tag Syntax and Examples\n   The general syntax of a tag URI, in ABNF [2],\
    \ is:\n      tagURI = \"tag:\" taggingEntity \":\" specific [ \"#\" fragment ]\n\
    \   Where:\n      taggingEntity = authorityName \",\" date\n      authorityName\
    \ = DNSname / emailAddress\n      date = year [\"-\" month [\"-\" day]]\n    \
    \  year = 4DIGIT\n      month = 2DIGIT\n      day = 2DIGIT\n      DNSname = DNScomp\
    \ *( \".\"  DNScomp ) ; see RFC 1035 [3]\n      DNScomp = alphaNum [*(alphaNum\
    \ /\"-\") alphaNum]\n      emailAddress = 1*(alphaNum /\"-\"/\".\"/\"_\") \"@\"\
    \ DNSname\n      alphaNum = DIGIT / ALPHA\n      specific = *( pchar / \"/\" /\
    \ \"?\" ) ; pchar from RFC 3986 [1]\n      fragment = *( pchar / \"/\" / \"?\"\
    \ ) ; same as RFC 3986 [1]\n   The component \"taggingEntity\" is the name space\
    \ part of the URI.  To\n   avoid ambiguity, the domain name in \"authorityName\"\
    \ (whether an email\n   address or a simple domain name) MUST be fully qualified.\
    \  It is\n   RECOMMENDED that the domain name should be in lowercase form.\n \
    \  Alternative formulations of the same authority name will be counted\n   as\
    \ distinct and, hence, tags containing them will be unequal (see\n   Section 2.4).\
    \  For example, tags beginning \"tag:EXAMPLE.com,2000:\"\n   are never equal to\
    \ those beginning \"tag:example.com,2000:\", even\n   though they refer to the\
    \ same domain name.\n   Authority names could, in principle, belong to any syntactically\n\
    \   distinct namespaces whose names are assigned to a unique entity at a\n   time.\
    \  Those include, for example, certain IP addresses, certain MAC\n   addresses,\
    \ and telephone numbers.  However, to simplify the tag\n   scheme, we restrict\
    \ authority names to domain names and email\n   addresses.  Future standards efforts\
    \ may allow use of other authority\n   names following syntax that is disjoint\
    \ from this syntax.  To allow\n   for such developments, software that processes\
    \ tags MUST NOT reject\n   them on the grounds that they are outside the syntax\
    \ defined above.\n   The component \"specific\" is the name-space-specific part\
    \ of the URI:\n   it is a string of URI characters (see restrictions in syntax\n\
    \   specification) chosen by the minter of the URI.  Note that the\n   \"specific\"\
    \ component allows for \"query\" subcomponents as defined in\n   RFC 3986 [1].\
    \  It is RECOMMENDED that specific identifiers should be\n   human-friendly.\n\
    \   Tag URIs may optionally end in a fragment identifier, in accordance\n   with\
    \ the general syntax of RFC 3986 [1].\n   In the interests of tractability to\
    \ humans, tags SHOULD NOT be minted\n   with percent-encoded parts.  However,\
    \ the tag syntax does allow\n   percent-encoded characters in the \"pchar\" elements\
    \ (defined in RFC\n   3986 [1]).\n   Examples of tag URIs are:\n     tag:timothy@hpl.hp.com,2001:web/externalHome\n\
    \     tag:sandro@w3.org,2004-05:Sandro\n     tag:my-ids.com,2001-09-15:TimKindberg:presentations:UBath2004-05-19\n\

- title: 2.2.  Rules for Minting Tags
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Rules for Minting Tags\n   As Section 2.1 has specified, each tag includes\
    \ a \"tagging entity\"\n   followed, optionally, by a specific identifier.  The\
    \ tagging entity\n   is designated by an \"authority name\" -- a fully qualified\
    \ domain name\n   or an email address containing a fully qualified domain name\
    \ --\n   followed by a date.  The date is chosen to make the tagging entity\n\
    \   globally unique, exploiting the fact that domain names and email\n   addresses\
    \ are assigned to at most one entity at a time.  That entity\n   then ensures\
    \ that it mints unique identifiers.\n   The date specifies, according to the Gregorian\
    \ calendar and UTC, any\n   particular day on which the authority name was assigned\
    \ to the\n   tagging entity at 00:00 UTC (the start of the day).  The date MAY\
    \ be\n   a past or present date on which the authority name was assigned at\n\
    \   that moment.  The date is specified using one of the \"YYYY\",\n   \"YYYY-MM\"\
    \ and \"YYYY-MM-DD\" formats allowed by the ISO 8601 standard\n   [4] (see also\
    \ RFC 3339 [10]).  The tag specification permits no other\n   formats.  Tagging\
    \ entities MUST ascertain the date with sufficient\n   accuracy to avoid accidentally\
    \ using a date on which the authority\n   name was not, in fact, assigned (many\
    \ computers and mobile devices\n   have poorly synchronised clocks).  The date\
    \ MUST be reckoned from\n   UTC, which may differ from the date in the tagging\
    \ entity's local\n   timezone at 00:00 UTC.  That distinction can generally be\
    \ safely\n   ignored in practice, but not on the day of the authority name's\n\
    \   assignment.  In principle it would otherwise be possible on that day\n   for\
    \ the previous assignee and the new assignee to use the same date\n   and, thus,\
    \ mint the same tags.\n   In the interests of brevity, the month and day default\
    \ to \"01\".  A\n   day value of \"01\" MAY be omitted; a month value of \"01\"\
    \ MAY be\n   omitted unless it is followed by a day value other than \"01\". \
    \ For\n   example, \"2001-07\" is the date 2001-07-01 and \"2000\" is the date\n\
    \   2000-01-01.  All date formulations specify a moment (00:00 UTC) of a\n   single\
    \ day, and not a period of a day or more such as \"the whole of\n   July 2001\"\
    \ or \"the whole of 2000\".  Assignment at that moment is all\n   that is required\
    \ to use a given date.\n   Tagging entities should be aware that alternative formulations\
    \ of the\n   same date will be counted as distinct and, hence, tags containing\n\
    \   them will be unequal.  For example, tags beginning\n   \"tag:example.com,2000:\"\
    \ are never equal to those beginning\n   \"tag:example.com,2000-01-01:\", even\
    \ though they refer to the same\n   date (see Section 2.4).\n   An entity MUST\
    \ NOT mint tags under an authority name that was\n   assigned to a different entity\
    \ at 00:00 UTC on the given date, and it\n   MUST NOT mint tags under a future\
    \ date.\n   An entity that acquires an authority name immediately after a period\n\
    \   during which the name was unassigned MAY mint tags as if the entity\n   were\
    \ assigned the name during the unassigned period.  This practice\n   has considerable\
    \ potential for error and MUST NOT be used unless the\n   entity has substantial\
    \ evidence that the name was unassigned during\n   that period.  The authors are\
    \ currently unaware of any mechanism that\n   would count as evidence, other than\
    \ daily polling of the \"whois\"\n   registry.\n   For example, Hewlett-Packard\
    \ holds the domain registration for hp.com\n   and may mint any tags rooted at\
    \ that name with a current or past date\n   when it held the registration.  It\
    \ must not mint tags, such as\n   \"tag:champignon.net,2001:\", under domain names\
    \ not registered to it.\n   It must not mint tags dated in the future, such as\n\
    \   \"tag:hp.com,2999:\".  If it obtains assignment of\n   \"extremelyunlikelytobeassigned.org\"\
    \ on 2001-05-01, then it must not\n   mint tags under \"extremelyunlikelytobeassigned.org,2001-04-01\"\
    \ unless\n   it has evidence proving that name was continuously unassigned between\n\
    \   2001-04-01 and 2001-05-01.\n   A tagging entity mints specific identifiers\
    \ that are unique within\n   its context, in accordance with any internal scheme\
    \ that uses only\n   URI characters.  Tagging entities SHOULD use record-keeping\n\
    \   procedures to achieve uniqueness.  Some tagging entities (e.g.,\n   corporations,\
    \ mailing lists) consist of many people, in which case\n   group decision-making\
    \ SHOULD also be used to achieve uniqueness.  The\n   outcome of such decision-making\
    \ could be to delegate control over\n   parts of the namespace.  For example,\
    \ the assignees of example.com\n   could delegate control over all tags with the\
    \ prefixes\n   \"tag:example.com,2004:fred:\" and \"tag:example.com,2004:bill:\"\
    ,\n   respectively, to the individuals with internal names \"fred\" and\n   \"\
    bill\" on 2004-01-01.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Resolution of Tags
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Resolution of Tags\n   There is no authoritative resolution mechanism for\
    \ tags.  Unlike most\n   other URIs, tags can only be used as identifiers, and\
    \ are not\n   designed to support resolution.  If authoritative resolution is\
    \ a\n   desired feature, a different URI scheme should be used.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Equality of Tags
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Equality of Tags\n   Tags are simply strings of characters and are considered\
    \ equal if and\n   only if they are completely indistinguishable in their machine\n\
    \   representations when using the same character encoding.  That is, one\n  \
    \ can compare tags for equality by comparing the numeric codes of their\n   characters,\
    \ in sequence, for numeric equality.  This criterion for\n   equality allows for\
    \ simplification of tag-handling software, which\n   does not have to transform\
    \ tags in any way to compare them.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Minting a tag, by itself, is an operation internal\
    \ to the tagging\n   entity, and has no external consequences.  The consequences\
    \ of using\n   an improperly minted tag (due to malice or error) in an application\n\
    \   depends on the application, and must be considered in the design of\n   any\
    \ application that uses tags.\n   There is a significant possibility of minting\
    \ errors by people who\n   fail to apply the rules governing dates, or who use\
    \ a shared\n   (organizational) authority-name without prior organization-wide\n\
    \   agreement.  Tag-aware software MAY help catch and warn against these\n   errors.\
    \  As stated in Section 2, however, to allow for future\n   expansion, software\
    \ MUST NOT reject tags which do not conform to the\n   syntax specified in Section\
    \ 2.\n   A malicious party could make it appear that the same domain name or\n\
    \   email address was assigned to each of two or more entities.  Tagging\n   entities\
    \ SHOULD use reputable assigning authorities and verify\n   assignment wherever\
    \ possible.\n   Entities SHOULD also avoid the potential for malicious exploitation\n\
    \   of clock skew, by using authority names that were assigned\n   continuously\
    \ from well before to well after 00:00 UTC on the date\n   chosen for the tagging\
    \ entity -- preferably by intervals in the order\n   of days.\n"
