    \ a\n   media type for SBML, the Systems Biology Markup Language.  SBML is\n \

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   SBML is an XML format for representing and exchanging models\
    \ of\n   biochemical reaction networks used in systems biology.  SBML:\n   o \
    \ enables researchers in systems biology to use multiple tools, such\n      as\
    \ simulators, editors, differential-equation solvers, and\n      visualizers,\
    \ on a single model without rewriting the model for\n      each tool;\n   o  enables\
    \ researchers and publishers to make models available on-\n      line to other\
    \ researchers even if they use a different software\n      environment;\n   o\
    \  enables models, and the intellectual effort put into them, to\n      survive\
    \ beyond the lifetime of the software tools used to create\n      them.\n   Currently,\
    \ about 60 software applications use SBML, and researchers\n   are using these\
    \ applications to develop quantitative and qualitative\n   computational models,\
    \ mostly in cell biology.  In addition, several\n   consortia and alliances have\
    \ standardized SBML as their model\n   definition language.  The SBML community\
    \ hopes that a standardized\n   MIME media type will help researchers share models\
    \ on a larger scale,\n   drawing more heavily on the capabilities of the world-wide\
    \ web.\n   A detailed exposition of SBML and its uses within the systems biology\n\
    \   community is available in references [HUCKA2003], [FINNEY2003], and\n   [HUCKA2004].\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Registration
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Registration\n   This section registers application/sbml+xml as a MIME\
    \ media type\n   according to the parameters set forth in [RFC2048].\n   MIME\
    \ media type name: application\n   MIME subtype name: sbml+xml\n   Required parameters:\
    \ none.\n   Optional parameters: none.\n      There is no charset parameter. \
    \ Character handling has identical\n      semantics to the case where the charset\
    \ parameter of the\n      \"application/xml\" media type is omitted, as described\
    \ in section\n      3.2 of [RFC3023].  Note that SBML level 2 is defined to have\
    \ UTF-8\n      encoding [SBML2-1, section 4.1].\n   Encoding considerations:\n\
    \      Same as described in section 3.2 of [RFC3023].\n   Security considerations:\n\
    \      The security considerations described in section 7 of [RFC3470]\n     \
    \ all potentially apply to sbml+xml documents.  In particular,\n      sbml+xml\
    \ documents might contain the results of proprietary\n      biological research\
    \ that their owner may wish to keep private.\n   The XML schema for sbml+xml provides\
    \ for no active or executable\n   content.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n\
    \      The information in an sbml+xml document describes an abstract\n      model\
    \ of biochemical reactions.  It is not tied to any particular\n      software\
    \ application, and indeed the primary purpose of SBML is to\n      make these\
    \ models readable and writable by many different software\n      applications.\n\
    \      This might seem to make sbml+xml more appropriate for the \"Model\"\n \
    \     primary content type [RFC2077], but SBML models are not guaranteed\n   \
    \   to have the required three orthogonal dimensions.  SBML models,\n      rather,\
    \ involve interacting entities that exist within\n      compartments.  However,\
    \ ideally, browsers and other software that\n      reads sbml+xml would give a\
    \ human reader multiple choices of how\n      to view the document: in a data-visualization\
    \ tool, in a model\n      editor, in a differential-equation analyzer, etc.\n\
    \      The systems biology community has and will continue to release new\n  \
    \    levels and versions of the SBML schema and semantics.  New\n      versions\
    \ attempt to be backward compatible with old versions, but\n      sometimes small\
    \ incompatibilities are introduced.  Every sbml+xml\n      document contains its\
    \ level and version; programs that read\n      sbml+xml should read this information\
    \ to be sure they correctly\n      interpret the remainder of the document.\n\
    \   Published specification:\n      A list of all current SBML specifications\
    \ and related documents is\n      maintained at:\n      http://sbml.org/documents\n\

    \ below for mailing information).\n   Applications which use this media type:\n\
    \      The following application and database projects read and/or write\n   \
    \   models in sbml+xml format.  Currently, most do not encode or\n      decode\
    \ MIME-format messages.  Hopefully the registration of\n      sbml+xml will make\
    \ it easier for these projects to connect through\n      a broader infrastructure,\
    \ such as the creation of repositories of\n      models on the world-wide web.\n\
