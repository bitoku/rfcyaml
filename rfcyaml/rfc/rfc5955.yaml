- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a new media type for TimeStampedData\
    \ envelopes.\n   A TimeStampedData envelope, described in [RFC5544], binds a file\
    \ with\n   one or more time-stamp tokens obtained for that file.  A media type\n\
    \   registration, lacking in [RFC5544], enhances shareability.\n"
