  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the clearance sponsor attribute.\
    \  It is\n   included in public key certificates [RFC5280] and attribute\n   certificates\
    \ [RFC5755].  This attribute is only meaningful as a\n   companion of the clearance\
    \ attribute [RFC5755] [RFC5912].  The\n   clearance sponsor is the entity (e.g.,\
    \ agency, department, or\n   organization) that granted the clearance to the subject\
    \ named in the\n   certificate.  For example, the clearance sponsor for a subject\n\
    \   asserting the Amoco clearance values [RFC3114] could be\n   \"Engineering\"\
    .\n   This attribute may be used in automated authorization decisions.  For\n\
    \   example, a web server deciding whether to allow a user access could\n   check\
    \ that the clearance sponsor present in the user's certificate is\n   on an \"\
    approved\" list.  This check is performed in addition to\n   certification path\
    \ validation [RFC5280].  The mechanism for managing\n   the \"approved\" list\
    \ is beyond the scope of this document.\n   NOTE: This document does not provide\
    \ an equivalent Lightweight\n   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) schema specification\
    \ as this\n   attribute is initially targeted at public key certificates [RFC5280]\n\
    \   and attribute certificates [RFC5755].  Definition of an equivalent\n   LDAP\
    \ schema is left to a future specification.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.  ASN.1 Syntax Notation\n   The attribute is defined using ASN.1 [X.680],\

- title: 2.  Clearance Sponsor
  contents:
  - "2.  Clearance Sponsor\n   The clearance sponsor attribute, which is only meaningful\
    \ if the\n   clearance attribute [RFC5755] [RFC5912] is also present, indicates\n\
    \   the sponsor of the clearance of the subject with which this attribute\n  \
    \ is associated.  The clearance sponsor attribute is a DirectoryString\n   [RFC5280],\
    \ which MUST use the UTF8String CHOICE, with a minimum size\n   of 1 character\
    \ and a maximum of 64 characters.\n   The following object identifier identifies\
    \ the sponsor attribute:\n   id-clearanceSponsor OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {\n   \
    \  joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101)\n     dod(2)\
    \ infosec(1) attributes(5) 68\n   }\n   The ASN.1 syntax for the clearance sponsor\
    \ attribute is as follows:\n   at-clearanceSponsor ATTRIBUTE ::= {\n     TYPE\
    \                   DirectoryString { ub-clearance-sponsor }\n               \
    \             ( WITH COMPONENTS { utf8String PRESENT } )\n     EQUALITY MATCHING\
    \ RULE caseIgnoreMatch\n     IDENTIFIED BY          id-clearanceSponsor\n   }\n\
    \   ub-clearance-sponsor INTEGER ::= 64\n   There MUST only be one value of clearanceSponsor\
    \ associated with a\n   particular certificate.  Distinct sponsors MUST be represented\
    \ in\n   separate certificates.\n   When an environment uses the Clearance Sponsor\
    \ attribute, it is\n   important that the same representation of the sponsor be\
    \ used\n   throughout the environment (e.g., using the same acronym).  Further,\n\
    \   the value in this attribute is not meant to be globally unique.  When\n  \
    \ included in certificates, it is unique within the scope of the\n   issuer.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   If this attribute is used as part of an authorization\
    \ process, the\n   procedures employed by the entity that assigns each clearance\
    \ sponsor\n   value must ensure that the correct value is applied.  Including\
    \ this\n   attribute in a public key certificate or attribute certificate\n  \
    \ ensures that the value for the clearance sponsor is integrity\n   protected.\n\
    \   The certificate issuer and clearance sponsor are not necessarily the\n   same\
    \ entity.  If they are separate entities, then the mechanism used\n   by the clearance\
    \ sponsor to convey to the certificate issuer that the\n   clearance sponsor did\
    \ in fact grant the clearance to the subject\n   needs to be protected from unauthorized\
    \ modification.\n   If two entities are verifying each other's certificates, they\
    \ do not\n   share the same issuer, and they use the same clearance sponsor value\n\
    \   (e.g., a United Kingdom PKI includes \"MoD\" and a New Zealand PKI also\n\
    \   includes \"MoD\"), then the relying party has two choices: 1) accept\n   the\
    \ two strings as equivalent, or 2) indicate the sponsor as well as\n   the trust\
    \ anchor.  To solve this problem, a mechanism, which is\n   outside the scope\
    \ of this specification, could be developed to allow\n   a relying party to group\
    \ together issuers that share a same context\n   within which sponsor names have\
    \ a unique significance.\n   While values of DirectoryString can include the NUL\
    \ (U+0000) code\n   point, values used to represent clearance sponsors typically\
    \ would\n   not.  Implementations of the caseIgnoreMatch rule must, per X.501,\n\
    \   consider all of the assertion value and attribute value in matching\n   and\
    \ hence protect against truncation attacks.\n"
