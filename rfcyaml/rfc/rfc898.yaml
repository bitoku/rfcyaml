  - "INTRODUCTION\n   This memo is a report on the Gateway Special Interest Group\
    \ Meeting\n   that was held at ISI in Marina del Rey, California on 28 and 29\n\
    \   February 1984.  Robert Hinden of BBNCC chaired, and Jon Postel of ISI\n  \
    \ hosted the conference.  Approximately 35 gateway designers and\n   implementors\
    \ attended.  These notes are based on the recollections of\n   Jon Postel and\
    \ Mike Muuss.  Under each topic area are Jon Postel's\n   brief notes, and additional\
    \ details from Mike Muuss.\n   The rest of this memo has three sections: the agenda,\
    \ notes on the\n   talks, and the attendees list.\n"

    \ description of the gateway implemented at MIT.  The\n      gateway was first\
    \ developed by Noel Chiappa.  It is written in C.\n      The MIT environment has\
    \ 32 internal networks which are treated as\n      subnets of the MITNET on the\
    \ Internet.  The MIT gateways then do\n      subnet routing in their interior\
    \ protocol.  The subnet routing\n      scheme is similar to GGP.  Liza has added\
    \ an EGP implementation to\n      this gateway.\n      Muuss:\n      Campus network/project\

    \ was a description of the UCI dumb gateway. This one\n      is made up of two\
    \ hosts (VAX 750s) 50 miles apart.  The VAXs are\n      connected via a 9.6 Kbs\
    \ leased line.  One is interfaced to the\n      ISI-NET (an Ethernet) and the\
    \ other to UCIICS net (also an\n      Ethernet).  The VAXs run Berkeley Unix 4.1.\
    \  These VAXs run as\n      regular hosts too.\n      Muuss:\n      MTU is 512.\

    \   FACC Gateway -- FACC - Holkenbrink\n      Postel:  A description of a gateway\
    \ designed by Ford.  The gateway\n      is based on a MC68000 multiprocessor and\
    \ a VME bus.  An\n      interesting question that came up during this presentation\
    \  was\n      \"What is the least information a host (or gateway) must have when\n\
    \      it comes up, and how can it acquire the rest of what it needs to\n    \
    \  go into full operation from the environment?\"\n      Muuss:\n      Inter-segment\

    \ Ethernet IOP. 1 cpu does IP, routing.\n      Multi-cpu version of MOS\n   Lincoln\
    \ IP/ST Gateway -- LL - Forgie/Kantrowitz\n      Postel:  This was a discussion\
    \ of the design of the Lincoln\n      gateways used primarily in the WBCNET for\
    \ speech transmission\n      research.  This gateway uses special I/O interfaces\
    \ to promote a\n      high packet processing rate.  The gateway implements both\
    \ the\n      regular IP, and the ST protocol which permits resource\n      reservations\
    \ to minimize the variation in transmission delay.\n      These gateways can,\
    \ of course, act as regular internet gateways,\n      and have achieved very good\
    \ performance in terms of datagrams per\n      second.\n      Muuss:\n      Packet\
    \ voice experiments, wideband SATNET. Concentrate traffic\n      from local nets\

    \      on how it is tailored to the Internet gateway situation.  One\n      point\
    \ that was impressed on me was that when using SPF in a set of\n      gateways\
    \ (say, the core autonomous system) the procedure will do\n      routing to an\
    \ \"exit\" gateway.  Somehow I had not thought about it\n      in those terms\
    \ before, but (obviously) just as there is a source\n      and a destination IMP\

    \ This was a clear presentation of some of the consequences\n      of the idea\
    \ of type of service routing.  The level of complexity\n      of the routing procedure\
    \ is determined to depend on how many\n      catagories of service there are and\
    \ how many selections there are\n      in each catagory.  A few examples were\
    \ discussed including the\n      current type of service parameters of IP.\n \
    \     Muuss:\n      Both current and proposed ARPANET algorithms provide \"best\"\
    \ path\n      under single constraint (number of hops, delay).\n      Internet\
    \ will have diverse characteristics, it would be nice to\n      consider more\

    \ of measure of length.\n             sum (delay, cost)\n             min/capacity,\
    \ length, security)\n      If just one cost is used, then SPF (or whatever) can\
    \ be used for\n      each cost.  However, under multiple constraints there is\
    \ a more\n      difficult problem. e.g.:  minimum delay with packet size of at\n\
    \      least 1000 bytes.\n      RUMC has been shown to be in the NP complete family.\n\
    \      RUMC needs bigger tables, more processing and routing overhead.\n     \
    \ Its not awful for 2-choice TOS, like in IP.\n      Table size is random, we\

    \ though. Good only for\n      virtual circuit. Weighted sum (VC only) works only\
    \ with some\n      probability.\n      TOS is needed for Internet, but the algorithms\
    \ are costly.\n      Complexity for providing TOS IP style is not too high.\n\
    \   FACC Multinet Gateway Routing -- FACC - Cook\n      Postel:  This approach\
    \ considered hop count to be an inadequate\n      metric for routing decsions\
    \ in a system of different types of\n      networks (e.g., Ethernets, ARPANETs,\
    \ 2.4Kb lines).  Delay was\n      selected as the metric to use.  There are some\
    \ interesting issues\n      in the measurement of delay for some types of networks.\
    \  Also, the\n      design considers the use of multiple paths when they are avaiable,\n\
    \      and routing to provide connectivty between the parts of\n      partitioned\

    \      Postel:  This is a project to invent several new addressing\n      features\
    \ for gateways.  In particular, there is a scheme to use an\n      option much\
    \ like the source route option to do multi-addressing of\n      IP datagrams.\
    \  It seems as if the gateways that implement this\n      option will have to\
    \ know which other gateways do and don't\n      implement it.  Also, there was\
    \ discussion of a gateway to a\n      network that is in radio silence, and how\
    \ to keep TCP connections\n      going with hosts that can't talk.  This project\
    \ is also concerned\n      about network reconstitution, security, survivability,\
    \ congestion\n      control, and supporting multimedia data (voice, bitmaps, etc.)\
    \ in\n      applications.  A gateway is being developed in ADA for a MC68000\n\

  - "Gateway SIG Meeting Notes\n   SAC Gateway -- SRI - Su/Lewis\n      Postel:  This\
    \ was a presentation of the design for the gateways to\n      be used in the advanced\
    \ SAC demo experiments on network\n      partitioning and reconstitution, and\
    \ communication between\n      intermingiling mobile networks.  Much of these\
    \ demonstrations will\n      be done with packet radio units and networks.  Some\
    \ of the ideas\n      are to use a gateway-centered type of addressing and double\n\
    \      encapsulation (i.e., an extra IP header) to route datagrams.\n      Muuss:\n\

    \ than network.\n        Gw host instead of net.host.\n      Double encapsulation:\
    \  additional IP header.\n        TCP uses addr as an ID, IP uses it as an ADDRESS\
    \ (-> route)\n        Need to separate these dual uses of this address field.\n\

    \      Postel:  A presentation of the EGP design.  EGP has three major\n     \
    \ aspects, neighbor acquisition, neighbor reachability, and network\n      reachability.\
    \  The autonomous system concept was discussed.\n      Muuss:\n      Background,\

    \ control:\n         DON'T DROP PACKETS (unless absolutely necessary)\n      Second\
    \ principle:\n         Hosts must behave themselves (or else)\n         Enemies\
    \ list -\n            1.  TOPS-20 TCP from DEC\n            2.  VAX/UNIX 4.2 from\
    \ Berkeley\n      Third principle:\n         Memory won't help (beyond a certain\
    \ point).\n         The small packet problem: Big packets are good, small are\
    \ bad\n         (big = 576).\n      Suggested fix: Rule: When the user writes\
    \ to TCP, initiate a send\n      only if there are NO outstanding packets on the\
    \ connection. [good\n      for TELNET, at least] (or if you fill a segment). No\
    \ change when\n      Acks come back. Assumption is that there is a pipe-like buffer\n\
    \      between the user and the TCP.\n      The source quench problem Rule: When\
    \ a TCP gets an ICMP Source\n      Quench, it must reduce the number of outstanding\
    \ datagrams on\n      relevant TCP connections.\n      Rule: When a gateway nears\
    \ overload, before starting to drop\n      packets, send a Source Quench.\n  \
    \    Node capacity: Each node ought to have one buffer for each TCP\n      connection,\
    \ plus some for overload.\n      Both fixes really need to be done together, although\
    \ the first one\n      is often helpful by itself. Side effect: FTPs start off\
    \ \"slowly,\"\n      until the first Ack comes back Dave Mills thinks this will\n\
    \      increase the mean delay for medium-size interactions. This\n      probably\
    \ will not work so well for SATNET.\n      Problems about propagation time of\
    \ links biasing the validity of\n      this result!!\n"

    \ - Niznik\n      Postel:  This talk was (for Postel) hard to follow.  There were\
    \ a\n      number of references to well known results in queuing theory etc,\n\
    \      but I could not follow how they were being used.\n      Muuss:\n      Replacements\

    \ delay.\n      Cubic structure of table.\n   DISCUSSION (Postel's personal comments)\n\
    \      There was very little organized discussion during the meeting and\n   \
    \   not really very much question and answer interaction during the\n      presentation.\
    \  There was a lot of discussion during the breaks,\n      and at lunch time,\
    \ and at the end of each day.\n      Some things that occured to me during the\
    \ meeting that may have\n      been triggered by something someone said (or maybe\
    \ by the view out\n      the window):\n         Don't design a protocol where\
    \ you expect to get a lot of\n         messages from a lot of sources at the same\
    \ time.  For example,\n         don't ask all the hosts on an Ethernet to send\
    \ you an ack to a\n         broadcast packet.\n         Has anyone worked out\
    \ in detail the routing traffic costs for\n         the GGP vs the SPF procedures\
    \ for the actual case of the\n         Internet?\n         How will the fact that\
    \ thinking of the routing in the core\n         autonomous system is cast in terms\
    \ of an entry and an exit\n         gateway effect other things?  Will there be\
    \ special\n"

    \  Will an\n         autonomous system become a circuit switch connecting pairs\
