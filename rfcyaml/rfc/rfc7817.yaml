  - "1.  Introduction\n   Use of TLS by SMTP Submission, IMAP, POP, and ManageSieve
    clients is\n   described in [RFC3207], [RFC3501], [RFC2595], and [RFC5804],\n
    \  respectively.  Each of the documents describes slightly different\n   rules
    for server certificate identity verification (or doesn't define\n   any rules
    at all).  In reality, email client and server developers\n   implement many of
    these protocols at the same time, so it would be\n   good to define modern and
    consistent rules for verifying email server\n   identities using TLS.\n   This
    document describes the updated TLS server identity verification\n   procedure
    for SMTP Submission [RFC6409] [RFC3207], IMAP [RFC3501],\n   POP [RFC1939], and
    ManageSieve [RFC5804] clients.  Section 3 of this\n   document replaces Section
    2.4 of [RFC2595].\n   Note that this document doesn't apply to use of TLS in MTA-to-MTA\n
    \  SMTP.\n   This document provides a consistent TLS server identity verification\n
    \  procedure across multiple email-related protocols.  This should make\n   it
    easier for Certification Authorities (CAs) and ISPs to deploy TLS\n   for email
    use and would enable email client developers to write more\n   secure code.\n"

  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC2119].\n   The following terms or concepts are used through the document:\n
    \  reference identifier:  One of the domain names that the email client\n      (an
    SMTP, IMAP, POP3, or ManageSieve client) associates with the\n      target email
    server.  For some identifier types, the identifier\n      also includes an application
    service type.  Reference identifiers\n      are used for performing name checks
    on server certificates.  (This\n      term is formally defined in [RFC6125].)\n
    \  CN-ID, DNS-ID, SRV-ID, and URI-ID are identifier types (see [RFC6125]\n   for
    details).  For convenience, their short definitions from\n   [RFC6125] are listed
    below:\n   CN-ID:  A Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) in the certificate\n      subject
    field that contains one and only one attribute-type-and-\n      value pair of
    type Common Name (CN), where the value matches the\n      overall form of a domain
    name (informally, dot-separated, letter-\n      digit-hyphen labels).\n   DNS-ID:
    \ A subjectAltName entry of type dNSName\n   SRV-ID:  A subjectAltName entry of
    type otherName whose name form is\n      SRVName\n   URI-ID:  A subjectAltName
    entry of type uniformResourceIdentifier\n      whose value includes both (i) a
    \"scheme\" and (ii) a \"host\"\n      component (or its equivalent) that matches
    the \"reg-name\" rule\n      (where the quoted terms represent the associated
    [RFC5234]\n      productions from [RFC3986]).\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  Email Server Certificate Verification Rules\n   During a TLS negotiation,
    an email client (i.e., an SMTP, IMAP, POP3,\n   or ManageSieve client) MUST check
    its understanding of the server\n   identity (client's reference identifiers)
    against the server's\n   identity as presented in the server Certificate message
    in order to\n   prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  This check is only performed\n
    \  after the server certificate passes certification path validation as\n   described
    in Section 6 of [RFC5280].  Matching is performed according\n   to the rules specified
    in Section 6 of [RFC6125], including the\n   relative order of matching of different
    identifier types,\n   \"certificate pinning\", and the procedure on failure to
    match.  The\n   following inputs are used by the verification procedure used in\n
    \  [RFC6125]:\n   1.  For DNS-ID and CN-ID identifier types, the client MUST use
    one or\n       more of the following as \"reference identifiers\": (a) the domain\n
    \      portion of the user's email address, (b) the hostname it used to\n       open
    the connection (without CNAME canonicalization).  The client\n       MAY also
    use (c) a value securely derived from (a) or (b), such\n       as using \"secure\"
    DNSSEC [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] validated\n       lookup.\n   2.  When using
    email service discovery procedure specified in\n       [RFC6186], the client MUST
    also use the domain portion of the\n       user's email address as another \"reference
    identifier\" to compare\n       against an SRV-ID identifier in the server certificate.\n
    \  The rules and guidelines defined in [RFC6125] apply to an email\n   server
    certificate with the following supplemental rules:\n   1.  Support for the DNS-ID
    identifier type (subjectAltName of dNSName\n       type [RFC5280]) is REQUIRED
    in email client software\n       implementations.\n   2.  Support for the SRV-ID
    identifier type (subjectAltName of SRVName\n       type [RFC4985]) is REQUIRED
    for email client software\n       implementations that support [RFC6186].  A list
    of SRV-ID types\n       for email services is specified in [RFC6186].  For the\n
    \      ManageSieve protocol, the service name \"sieve\" is used.\n   3.  A URI-ID
    identifier type (subjectAltName of\n       uniformResourceIdentifier type [RFC5280])
    MUST NOT be used by\n       clients for server verification, as URI-IDs were not
    historically\n       used for email.\n   4.  For backward compatibility with deployed
    software, a CN-ID\n       identifier type (CN attribute from the subject name,
    see\n       [RFC6125]) MAY be used for server identity verification.\n   5.  Email
    protocols allow use of certain wildcards in identifiers\n       presented by email
    servers.  The \"*\" wildcard character MAY be\n       used as the left-most name
    component of a DNS-ID or CN-ID in the\n       certificate.  For example, a DNS-ID
    of \"*.example.com\" would\n       match \"a.example.com\", \"foo.example.com\",
    etc., but would not\n       match \"example.com\".  Note that the wildcard character
    MUST NOT\n       be used as a fragment of the left-most name component (e.g.,\n
    \      \"*oo.example.com\", \"f*o.example.com\", or \"foo*.example.com\").\n"

    - "4.1.  Notes on Handling of Delegated Email Services by Certification\n      Authorities\n
      \  [RFC6186] provides an easy way for organizations to autoconfigure\n   email
      clients.  It also allows for delegation of email services to an\n   email hosting
      provider.  When connecting to such delegated hosting\n   service, an email client
      that attempts to verify TLS server identity\n   needs to know that if it connects
      to \"imap.hosting.example.net\", such\n   server is authorized to provide email
      access for an email such as\n   alice@example.org.  In absence of SRV-IDs, users
      of compliant email\n   clients would be forced to manually confirm exceptions
      because the\n   TLS server certificate verification procedures specified in
      this\n   document would result in failure to match the TLS server certificate\n
      \  against the expected domain(s).  One way to provide such\n   authorization
      is for the TLS certificate for\n   \"imap.hosting.example.net\" to include SRV-ID(s)
      (or a DNS-ID) for the\n   \"example.org\" domain.  Note that another way is
      for DNS Service\n   Record (SRV) lookups to be protected by DNSSEC, but this
      solution\n   depends on ubiquitous use of DNSSEC and availability of DNSSEC-aware\n
      \  APIs and thus is not discussed in this document.  A future update to\n   this
      document might rectify this.\n   A CA that receives a Certificate Signing Request
      containing multiple\n   unrelated DNS-IDs and/or SRV-IDs (e.g., a DNS-ID of
      \"example.org\" and\n   a DNS-ID of \"example.com\") needs to verify that the
      entity that\n   supplied such Certificate Signing Request is authorized to provide\n
      \  email service for all requested domains.\n   The ability to issue certificates
      that contain an SRV-ID (or a DNS-ID\n   for the domain part of email addresses)
      implies the ability to verify\n   that entities requesting them are authorized
      to run email service for\n   these SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs.  In particular, CAs that
      can't verify such\n   authorization (whether for a particular domain or in general)
      MUST\n   NOT include such email SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs in certificates they issue.\n
      \  This document doesn't specify exact mechanism(s) that can be used to\n   achieve
      this.  However, a few special case recommendations are listed\n   below.\n   A
      CA willing to sign a certificate containing a particular DNS-ID\n   SHOULD also
      support signing a certificate containing one or more of\n   the email SRV-IDs
      for the same domain because the SRV-ID effectively\n   provides more restricted
      access to an email service for the domain\n   (as opposed to unrestricted use
      of any services for the same domain,\n   as specified by the DNS-ID).\n   A
      CA that also provides DNS service for a domain can use DNS\n   information to
      validate SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs for the domain.\n   A CA that is also a Mail Service
      Provider for a hosted domain can use\n   that knowledge to validate SRV-IDs/DNS-IDs
      for the domain.\n"

    - "5.1.  Notes on Hosting Multiple Domains\n   A server that hosts multiple domains
      needs to do one of the following\n   (or some combination thereof):\n   1.  Use
      DNS SRV records to redirect each hosted email service to a\n       fixed domain,
      deploy TLS certificate(s) for that single domain,\n       and instruct users
      to configure their clients with appropriate\n       pinning (unless the SRV
      records can always be obtained via\n       DNSSEC).  Some email clients come
      with preloaded lists of pinned\n       certificates for some popular domains;
      this can avoid the need\n       for manual confirmation.\n   2.  Use a single
      TLS certificate that includes a complete list of all\n       the domains it
      is serving.\n   3.  Serve each domain on its own IP/port, using separate TLS\n
      \      certificates on each IP/port.\n   4.  Use the Server Name Indication
      (SNI) TLS extension [RFC6066] to\n       select the right certificate to return
      during TLS negotiation.\n       Each domain has its own TLS certificate in this
      case.\n   Each of these deployment choices have their scaling disadvantages\n
      \  when the list of domains changes.  Use of DNS SRV without an SRV-ID\n   requires
      manual confirmation from users.  While preloading pinned\n   certificates avoids
      the need for manual confirmation, this\n   information can get stale quickly
      or would require support for a new\n   mechanism for distributing preloaded
      pinned certificates.  A single\n   certificate (the second choice) requires
      that when a domain is added,\n   then a new Certificate Signing Request that
      includes a complete list\n   of all the domains needs to be issued and passed
      to a CA in order to\n   generate a new certificate.  A separate IP/port can
      avoid\n   regenerating the certificate but requires more transport layer\n   resources.
      \ Use of TLS SNI requires each email client to use it.\n   Several Mail Service
      Providers host hundreds and even thousands of\n   domains.  This document, as
      well as its predecessors, RFCs 2595,\n   3207, 3501, and 5804, don't address
      scaling issues caused by use of\n   TLS in multi-tenanted environments.  Further
      work is needed to\n   address this issue, possibly using DNSSEC or something
      like PKIX over\n   Secure HTTP (POSH) [RFC7711].\n"

  - "6.  Examples\n   Consider an IMAP-accessible email server that supports both
    IMAP and\n   IMAP-over-TLS (IMAPS) at the host \"mail.example.net\" servicing
    email\n   addresses of the form \"user@example.net\".  A certificate for this\n
    \  service needs to include DNS-IDs of \"example.net\" (because it is the\n   domain
    portion of emails) and \"mail.example.net\" (this is what a user\n   of this server
    enters manually if not using [RFC6186]).  It might\n   also include a CN-ID of
    \"mail.example.net\" for backward compatibility\n   with deployed infrastructure.\n
    \  Consider the IMAP-accessible email server from the previous paragraph\n   that
    is additionally discoverable via DNS SRV lookups in domain\n   \"example.net\"
    (using DNS SRV records \"_imap._tcp.example.net\" and\n   \"_imaps._tcp.example.net\").
    \ In addition to the DNS-ID/CN-ID identity\n   types specified above, a certificate
    for this service also needs to\n   include SRV-IDs of \"_imap.example.net\" (when
    STARTTLS is used on the\n   IMAP port) and \"_imaps.example.net\" (when TLS is
    used on IMAPS port).\n   See [RFC6186] for more details.  (Note that unlike DNS
    SRV there is\n   no \"_tcp\" component in SRV-IDs).\n   Consider the IMAP-accessible
    email server from the first paragraph\n   that is running on a host also known
    as \"mycompany.example.com\".  In\n   addition to the DNS-ID identity types specified
    above, a certificate\n   for this service also needs to include a DNS-ID of\n
    \  \"mycompany.example.com\" (this is what a user of this server enters\n   manually
    if not using [RFC6186]).  It might also include a CN-ID of\n   \"mycompany.example.com\"
    instead of the CN-ID \"mail.example.net\" for\n   backward compatibility with
    deployed infrastructure.  (This is so,\n   because a certificate can only include
    a single CN-ID)\n   Consider an SMTP Submission server at the host \"submit.example.net\"\n
    \  servicing email addresses of the form \"user@example.net\" and\n   discoverable
    via DNS SRV lookups in domain \"example.net\" (using DNS\n   SRV record \"_submission._tcp.example.net\").
    \ A certificate for this\n   service needs to include SRV-IDs of \"_submission.example.net\"
    (see\n   [RFC6186]) along with DNS-IDs of \"example.net\" and\n   \"submit.example.net\".
    \ It might also include a CN-ID of\n   \"submit.example.net\" for backward compatibility
    with deployed\n   infrastructure.\n   Consider a host \"mail.example.net\" servicing
    email addresses of the\n   form \"user@example.net\" and discoverable via DNS
    SRV lookups in\n   domain \"example.net\", which runs SMTP Submission, IMAPS and
    POP3S\n   (POP3-over-TLS), and ManageSieve services.  Each of the servers can\n
    \  use their own certificate specific to their service (see examples\n   above).
    \ Alternatively, they can all share a single certificate that\n   would include
    SRV-IDs of \"_submission.example.net\",\n   \"_imaps.example.net\", \"_pop3s.example.net\",
    and \"_sieve.example.net\"\n   along with DNS-IDs of \"example.net\" and \"mail.example.net\".

    detailed changes this document applies to RFCs\n   2595, 3207, 3501, and 5804.\n
    \  The entire Section 2.4 of RFC 2595 is replaced with the following\n   text:\n
    \     During the TLS negotiation, the client checks its understanding of\n      the
    server identity against the provided server's identity as\n      specified in
    Section 3 of [RFC7817].\n   The 3rd paragraph (and its subparagraphs) in Section
    11.1 of RFC 3501\n   is replaced with the following text:\n      During the TLS
    negotiation, the IMAP client checks its\n      understanding of the server identity
    against the provided server's\n      identity as specified in Section 3 of [RFC7817].\n
    \  The 3rd paragraph (and its subparagraphs) in Section 4.1 of RFC 3207\n   is
    replaced with the following text:\n      During the TLS negotiation, the Submission
    client checks its\n      understanding of the server identity against the provided
    server's\n      identity as specified in Section 3 of [RFC7817].\n   Sections
    2.2.1 and 2.2.1.1 of RFC 5804 are replaced with the\n   following text:\n      During
    the TLS negotiation, the ManageSieve client checks its\n      understanding of
    the server identity against the server's identity\n      as specified in Section
    3 of [RFC7817].  When the reference\n      identity is an IP address, the iPAddress
    subjectAltName SHOULD be\n      used by the client for comparison.  The comparison
    is performed as\n      described in Section 2.2.1.2 of RFC 5804.\n"
