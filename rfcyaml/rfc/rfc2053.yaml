  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo provides information for the Internet community.\
    \  This memo\n   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution\
    \ of\n   this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: The AM Domain
  contents:
  - "The AM Domain\n   The AM Domain is an official Internet top-level domain of Armenia.\n\
    \   AM is the ISO-3166 2-letter country code for the Republic of Armenia\n   and\
    \ thus the AM Domain is established as a top-level domain and\n   registered with\
    \ the InterNIC the same way other country domains are.\n"
- title: Naming Structure
  contents:
  - "Naming Structure\n   The AM Domain hierarchy is flat. This means that any organization\
    \ may\n   be registered directly under the AM TLD. Example: arminco.am.\n   However,\
    \ subdomains are allowed, such as ORG and MIL, as well as CO\n   and AC.\n   Please\
    \ note that MIL.AM and GOV.AM domains are reserved by the\n   Ministry of Defense\
    \ and The Government of Armenia, respectively.\n   Other domains may be reserved\
    \ for appropriate organizations by\n   contacting AM Network Information Center\
    \ at HOSTMASTER@AMNIC.NET.\n"
- title: Registration
  contents:
  - "Registration\n   There are two types of registrations (1) Delegation, where a\
    \ branch\n   of the AM Domain is delegated to an organization running name servers\n\
    \   to support that branch; or (2) Direct Registration, in which the\n   information\
    \ is put directly into the main database.\n   In Direct Registration there are\
    \ two cases: (a) an IP-host (with an\n   IP address), and (b) non-IP host (for\
    \ example, a UUCP host).  Any\n   particular registration will involve any one\
    \ of these three\n   situations.\n   The registration is performed by the AM Network\
    \ Information Center,\n   national Internet registry of Armenia. For more information\
    \ about AM\n   Network Information Center, please visit:\n                   \
    \        http://www.amnic.net\n"
- title: Requirements
  contents:
  - "Requirements\n   Anyone requesting to register a host in the AM Domain is sent\
    \ a copy\n   of the \"AM second-level domain registration template\". It is\n\
    \   necessary to fill out this template and send via Internet e-mail to\n   HOSTMASTER@AMNIC.NET\
    \ for consideration.\n   The AM Domain template, is similar to the InterNIC Domain\
    \ template,\n   but it is not the same.  To request a copy of the AM Domain template,\n\
    \   send a message to HOSTMASTER@AMNIC.NET.\n"
