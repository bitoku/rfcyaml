  - "                      A MAIL BOX PROTOCOL\nThe purpose of this protocol is to\
    \ provide at each site a\nstandard mechanism to receive sequential files for immediate\
    \ or\ndeferred printing or other uses.  The files for deferred printing\nwould\
    \ probably be stored on intermediate disk files, although\ndetails of how a file\
    \ is handled, stored, manipulated, or printed\nat a site are not the concern of\
    \ this protocol.\nIt is also assumed that there would be a program at the sending\n\
    site which sends the file in the format given below with the\noptional control\
    \ codes when appropriate.  This program could\nprobably be accessed as a subcommand\
    \ of the Telnet program.\nThe motivation for developing this protocol is the Network\n\
    Information Center's (NIC) need to be able to deliver messages\nand documents\
    \ to remote sites, and to be able to receive\ndocuments for cataloging, redistribution,\
    \ and other purposes from\nremote site without having to know the details of path\
    \ name\nconventions and file system commands at each site.  Multiple mail\nboxes\
    \ (128) are allowed at each site and are identified as\ndescribed below.  The\
    \ default is mail box number 0 for use with\nthe standard mail printer defined\
    \ below.\nA mail box, as we see it, is simply a sequential file to which\nmessages\
    \ and documents are appended, separated by an appropriate\nsite dependent code.\n\
    Although this protocol will enable people to transmit messages\ndirectly without\
    \ going through the NIC, we want to encourage\npeople to use the NIC as much as\
    \ possible, so that dialogue will\nbe recorded, cataloged and available for viewing\
    \ online at NIC,\nusing the powerful facilities of the ARC on Line System (NLS).\n\
    The Mail Box Protocol will use established network conventions,\nspecifically\
    \ the Network Control Program, Initial Connection\nProtocol, and Data Transfer\
    \ Protocol, NIC 7104.\nThe normal transmission is to be full 7-bit ASCII in 8-bit\
    \ bytes,\nthe high order bit set to zero.\nThe standard receiving mail printer\
    \ for mail box number 0 is\nassumed to have a print line 72 characters wide, and\
    \ a page of 66\nlines.  The new line convention will be carriage return (X'OD')\n\
    followed by line feed (X'OA') as per the Telnet Protocol RFC 158,\nNIC 6768. \
    \ The standard printer will accept form feed (X'OC') as\nmeaning move paper to\
    \ the top of a new page.\nIt is the senders responsibility to control the length\
    \ of the\nprint line and page. If more than 72 characters per line are sent\n\
    or if more than 66 lines are sent without a form feed, than the\nreceiving site\
    \ can handle these situations as appropriate for\nthem.  These conventions can\
    \ be changed by control codes as\ndescribed below.\nA message or document being\
    \ sent to any mail box is a string of 8\nbit bytes.\nAt the head of the message\
    \ or document sent to mail box number 0\nthere is to be an initial address string\
    \ terminated by a form\nfeed.  This address string is to contain the sender's\
    \ name and\naddress, and the receiver's name and address formatted in some\nreasonable,\
    \ easy-to-read form for a clerk to read and distribute.\nComments could also be\
    \ included in the address string.\nThe format of information in mail boxes other\
    \ than mail box\nnumber 0 is not explicitly defined by this protocol.\nInitial\
    \ Connection\n   Initial Connection will be as per the Official Initial\n   Connection\
    \ Protocol, Documents #2, NIC 7101, to a standard\n   socket not yet assigned.\
    \  A candidate socket number would be\n   socket #5.\nData Transmission\n   Data\
    \ Transmission will be as per the Data Transfer Protocol,\n   RFC 171, NIC 6793.\
    \  That is, there will be a Modes Available\n   handshake, and then transmission\
    \ of special control\n   information and data. A message or document is defined\
    \ to be a\n   block of data.  Control information is to be global.  That is,\n\
    \   once a control mode is set it is assumed to apply during the\n   life of the\
    \ connection unless explicitly changed. More than\n   one document may be sent\
    \ during the life of the connection\n   unless the infinite bit stream mode is\
    \ used.  In the latter\n   case there will be one message or document per connection.\
    \  A\n   reasonable convention for control information sent using the\n   infinite\
    \ bit stream mode seems to be to assume that is applies\n   only to the next data\
    \ stream connection from the host which\n   sent the control stream.\nControl\
    \ Information\n   The sending process should be capable of allowing the user to\n\
    \   indicate the control codes associated with the transmission of\n   a mail\
    \ item.  The control codes can be used with any mail box\n   number.\n   Mail\
    \ Box Number\n      A site may find, as is the case at NIC, that it is useful\n\
    \      to have more than one receiving mail box, each to be\n      associated\
    \ with a different process.\n      The mail box number for material to be printed\
    \ by the\n      standard mail printer is mail box number 0 and is used by\n  \
    \    default.\n      Code X'DO'\n         Meaning: A seven bit binary number in\
    \ an eight bit field\n         with the high order bit set to zero is to follow\n\
    \         indicating the receiving mail box number.\n   Transmission Code Type\n\
    \      The default code type is 7-bit ASCII in an 8 bit field,\n      high order\
    \ bit to zero.\n      'Code X'AO'\n         Meaning: A Data Type signal indicating\
    \ that the\n         transmission code is 7-bit ASCII in an 8-bit field, high\n\
    \         order set to zero.\n      Code X'A1'\n         Meaning: Transparency,\
    \ i.e. a stream of 8 bit bytes.\n      Code X'A2'\n         Meaning:  EBCDIC\n\
    \      Other character codes could be added in the future.\n   Printer Control\
    \ Codes\n      The default settings are a print line of 72 characters and\n  \
    \    a print page of 66 lines.\n      Code X'D1\n         Meaning:  Set line width\
    \ to 72 characters.\n      Code X'D2'\n         Meaning:  Use the full width of\
    \ your printer.\n      Code X'D3'\n         Meaning:  Set page size to 66 lines.\n\
    \      Code X'D4'\n         Meaning:  Set page size to infinite.\n      Other\
    \ virtual printer control codes can be added in the\n      future.\n      Other\
    \ classes of control codes can be added as the need\n      arises.\n       [ This\
