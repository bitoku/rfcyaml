  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is currently
    involved\n   in the development of a multicast and broadcast service, the\n   Multimedia
    Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS), and its security\n   architecture [MBMS].\n
    \  [MBMS] requires the use of the Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)\n   Protocol
    [RFC3830] to convey the keys and related security parameters\n   needed to secure
    multimedia that is multicast or broadcast.\n   One of the requirements that MBMS
    puts on security is the ability to\n   perform frequent updates of the keys.  The
    rationale behind this is\n   that it will be costly for subscribers to re-distribute
    the\n   decryption keys to non-subscribers.  The cost for re-distributing the\n
    \  keys using the unicast channel should be higher than the cost of\n   purchasing
    the keys for this scheme to have an effect.  To implement\n   this, MBMS uses
    a three-level key management, to distribute group\n   keys to the clients, and
    be able to re-key by pushing down a new\n   group key.  As illustrated in the
    section below, MBMS has the need to\n   identify which types of keys are involved
    in the MIKEY message and\n   their identity.\n   This memo specifies a new Type
    for the General Extension Payload in\n   MIKEY, to identify the type and identity
    of keys involved.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Rationale\n   An application where this extension is used is MBMS key management.\n
    \  The key management solution adopted by MBMS uses three-level key\n   management.
    \ The keys are used in the way described below.  \"Clients\"\n   refers to the
    clients who have subscribed to a given\n   multicast/broadcast service.\n   *
    The MBMS User Key (MUK), a point-to-point key between the multicast\n     server
    and each client.\n   * The MBMS Service Key (MSK), a group key between the multicast\n
    \    server and all the clients.\n   * The MBMS Traffic Key (MTK), a group traffic
    key between the\n     multicast server and all clients.\n   The Traffic Keys are
    the keys that are regularly updated.\n   The point-to-point MUK (first-level key)
    is shared between the\n   multicast server and the client via means defined by
    MBMS [MBMS].\n   The MUK is used as a pre-shared key to run MIKEY with the pre-shared\n
    \  key method [RFC3830], and to deliver (point-to-point) the MSK.  The\n   same
    MSK is pushed to all the clients, to be used as a (second-level)\n   group key.\n
    \  Then, the MSK is used to push to all the clients an MTK (third-level\n   key),
    the actual group key that is used for the protection of the\n   media traffic.
    \ For example, the MTK could be the master key for the\n   Secure Real-time Transport
    Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] in the streaming\n   case.\n   A Key Domain identifier
    defines the domain where the group keys are\n   valid or applicable.  For example,
    it may define a specific service\n   provider.\n   To allow the key distribution
    described above, an indication of the\n   type and identity of keys being carried
    in a MIKEY message is needed.\n   This indication is carried in a new Type of
    the General Extension\n   Payload in MIKEY.\n   It is necessary to specify what
    Crypto Session ID (CS ID) map type is\n   associated with a given key.  There
    are cases (for example, the\n   download case in MBMS) where the required parameters
    are signalled\n   in-band (each downloaded Digital Rights Management Content Format\n
    \  object [DCF] contains the necessary parameters needed by the receiver\n   to
    process it).  Since the parameters are not transported by MIKEY,\n   this implies
    that a CS ID map type needs to be registered to the\n   \"empty map\", as defined
    in Table 3, which is to be used when the\n   map/policy information is conveyed
    outside of MIKEY.\n"
  title: 2.  Rationale
- contents:
  - "3.  Relations to MIKEY and GKMARCH\n   According to [RFC3830], MIKEY is a registration
    protocol that\n   supports re-keying for unicast in the terms of the MSEC Group
    Key\n   Management Architecture [RFC4046].  MBMS uses MIKEY both as a\n   registration
    protocol and a re-key protocol, and the specified\n   extension implements the
    necessary additions to [RFC3830] that allows\n   MIKEY to function both as a unicast
    and multicast re-key protocol in\n   the MBMS setting.\n"

  - "4.  The Key ID Information Type for the General Extension Payload\n   The General
    Extension payload in MIKEY is defined in Section 6.15 of\n   [RFC3830].  The General
    Extension payload type (Key ID Information)\n   defined in the present document
    is not restricted to MBMS.\n   Applications using this General Extension payload
    type may define new\n   Key ID types, and these applications MUST define the semantics
    and\n   usage of the Key ID Type sub-payloads according to Section 8.  The\n   MBMS
    use of the Key ID Type sub-payloads, defined in Table 2, is\n   specified in [MBMS].\n
    \  The Key ID Information Type (Type 3) formats the General Extension\n   payload
    as follows:\n                        1                   2                   3\n

  - "6.  Transport Considerations\n   As specified in Section 7 of [RFC3830], the
    underlying transport of\n   the MIKEY protocol has to be defined for each type
    of transport.\n   When the Key-ID payload is used with MBMS, the transport is
    UDP, and\n   the usage of MIKEY over UDP in the MBMS setting is defined in [MBMS].\n"
  title: 6.  Transport Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The usage of MIKEY for updating the traffic encryption
    key (MTK) in\n   the broadcast manner, described in Section 2, deviates from the
    way\n   MIKEY [RFC3830] was originally designed.  There are two main points\n
    \  that are related to the security of the described usage.\n   First, the delivery
    of the MTK is not source origin authenticated,\n   but rather protected by a group
    MAC, keyed by the group key (MSK).\n   The threat this raises is that users that
    are part of the group are\n   able to send fake MTK messages to other group members.
    \ The origin of\n   the MTK messages is a node inside the core network, and the
    trust\n   model used in MBMS is that only trusted traffic is allowed to be sent\n
    \  (from within the operator's network) on the MBMS bearers.  However,\n   there
    is always the risk that traffic is injected on the air\n   interface between the
    base stations and the user equipment.  It is\n   possible for members of the group
    (i.e., with access to the MSK) to\n   spoof MTK updates to other members of the
    group.  3GPP decided that\n   the technical difficulties and costs involved in
    performing such an\n   attack are large enough compared to the expected gain for
    the\n   attacker, that the risk was deemed acceptable.  Note that, since the\n
    \  delivery of the MTK is not source origin authenticated, there is\n   nothing
    gained by adding source origin authentication to the RTP\n   streams (e.g., using
    SRTP-TESLA [RFC4383]).  Hence, the current use\n   of the specified extension
    is not compatible with SRTP-TESLA, which\n   requires source origin authentication
    of the integrity key.\n   Note that in MBMS the MSK is protected end-to-end, from
    the multicast\n   server to the clients, using a client-unique key MUK, but the
    MTK is\n   delivered under protection by the group key MSK, so source origin\n
    \  authentication is not achieved.\n   Secondly, the delivery of the MTK is separated
    from the delivery of\n   the security policy.  The security policy is delivered
    with the MSK.\n   The delivery of the MTKs is assumed to be frequent (some scenarios\n
    \  require the delivery of MTKs to be as frequent as a few seconds\n   apart).
    \ This would imply that the cost (in terms of bandwidth) would\n   be very high
    if the security policy was delivered together with each\n   MTK.  Furthermore,
    the security policy parameters of the streaming\n   session are not anticipated
    to change during the session, even though\n   there would be an update of the
    MTK.  It was decided in 3GPP that\n   there was no need for updating the policy
    during an ongoing session,\n   and that the cost of allowing such a feature, only
    to be on the safe\n   side, would be too high.  On the other hand, updating the
    security\n   policy during an ongoing session would be possible by updating the\n
    \  MSK.\n   The Empty map type used when the security policy is delivered in band\n
    \  relies on the security provided by DCF [DCF], and MIKEY is, in this\n   case,
    only used to provide the master key for the DCF processing.\n"

  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   According to Section 10 of RFC 3830, IETF consensus
    is required to\n   register values in the range 0-240 in the Type namespace of
    the MIKEY\n   General Extension Payload and the CS ID map type namespace of the\n
    \  Common Header Payload.\n   A new value in the MIKEY General Extension Payload
    Type name space\n   has been registered for this purpose.  The registered value
    for Key\n   ID is 3 according to Section 4.\n   Also, the value 1 has been registered
    for the Empty map in the\n   existing CS ID map namespace of the Common Header
    Payload, as\n   specified in Table 3, in Section 5.\n   The new name space for
    the following field in the Key ID information\n   sub-payload (from Sections 4
    and 5) has been established and will be\n   managed by IANA:\n   * Key ID Type\n
    \  The IANA has registered the pre-defined types of Table 2 for this\n   namespace.
    \ IANA will also manage the definition of additional values\n   in the future.
    \ Values in the range 0-240 for each name space SHOULD\n   be approved by the
    process of IETF consensus, and values in the range\n   241-255 are reserved for
    Private Use, according to [RFC2434].\n"
