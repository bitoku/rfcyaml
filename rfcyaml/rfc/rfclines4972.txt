Abstract The setup of a full mesh of Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Label Switched Paths (LSP) among a set of Label Switch Routers (LSR) is a common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute.
Such deployment may require the configuration of a potentially large number of TE LSPs (on the order of the square of the number of LSRs).
This document specifies Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh in order to automate the creation of such mesh of TE LSPs.
There are two well known approaches in deploying MPLS Traffic Engineering: (1)
The so called "strategic" approach that consists of setting up a full mesh of TE LSPs between a set of LSRs.
The so called "tactical" approach, where a set of TE LSPs are provisioned on well identified "hot spots" in order to alleviate a congestion resulting, for instance, from an unexpected traffic growth in some parts of the network.
The setup of a full mesh of TE LSPs among a set of LSRs is a common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees, or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute.
Setting up a full mesh of TE LSPs between N LSRs requires the configuration of a potentially large number of TE LSPs (O(N^2)).
Furthermore, the addition of any new LSR in the mesh requires the configuration of N additional TE LSPs on the new LSR and one new TE LSP on every LSR of the existing mesh destined to this new LSR, which gives a total of 2 N TE LSPs to be configured.
Such an operation is not only time consuming but also risky (prone to misconfiguration) for Service Providers.
Hence, an automatic mechanism for setting up TE LSPs meshes is desirable and requires the ability to automatically discover the set of LSRs that belong to the mesh.
This document specifies routing extensions so as to automatically discover the members of a mesh, also referred to as a "TE mesh group".
that the mechanism(s) needed for the dynamic creation of TE LSPs is implementation specific and outside the scope of this document.
Routing extensions have been defined in [RFC4970] and [RFC4971] in order to advertise router capabilities.
This document specifies IGP (OSPF and IS IS)
TE Mesh Group (Type Length Value) TLVs allowing for the automatic discovery of a TE mesh group members, to be carried in the OSPF Router Information (Link State Advertisement)
LSA [RFC4970] and IS IS Router Capability TLV [RFC4971].
The routing extensions specified in this document provide the ability to signal multiple TE mesh groups.
An LSR may belong to more than one TE mesh group(s).
There are relatively tight real time constraints on the operation of IGPs (such as OSPF and IS IS).
For this reason, some care needs to be applied when proposing to carry additional information in an IGP.
The information described in this document is both relatively small in total volume (compared with other information already carried in IGPs), and also relatively stable (i.e., changes are based on configuration changes, but not on dynamic events within the network, or on dynamic triggers, such as the leaking of information from other routing protocols or routing protocol instances).

Description of a TE Mesh Group A TE mesh group is defined as a group of LSRs that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs.
Routing extensions are specified in this document, allowing for dynamic discovery of the TE mesh group members.
Procedures are also specified for a member to join and leave a TE mesh group.
For each TE mesh group membership announced by an LSR, the following information is advertised:  A mesh group number identifying the TE mesh group that the LSR belongs to,  A tail end address (used as the TE LSP Tail end address by other LSRs belonging to the same mesh group),  A tail end name: a display string that is allocated to the tail  end used to ease the TE LSP naming.
TE MESH GROUP TLV Formats 4.1.
OSPF TE MESH GROUP TLV Format
The TE MESH GROUP TLV is used to advertise the desire of an LSR to join/leave a given TE mesh group.
No sub TLV is currently defined for the TE MESH GROUP TLV.
The OSPF TE MESH GROUP TLV (advertised in an OSPF router information LSA defined in [RFC4970]) has the following format:
OSPF TE MESH GROUP TLV format Where Type: identifies the TLV type Length: the length of the value field in octets
The format of the OSPF TE MESH GROUP TLV is the same as the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF (see[RFC3630]).
The TLV is padded to a four octet alignment; padding is not included in the length field (so a three octet value would have a length of three, but the total size of the TLV would be eight octets).
Nested TLVs are also 32 bit aligned.
All types between 32768 and 65535 are reserved for vendor specific extensions.
All other undefined type codes are reserved for future assignment by IANA.
The OSPF TE MESH GROUP TLV format for IPv4 (Figure 2) and IPv6 (Figure 3) is as follows:
Tail end IPv6 address 1
The OSPF TE MESH GROUP TLV may contain one or more mesh group entries, where each entry corresponds to a TE mesh group and is made of the following fields:  A mesh group number that identifies the mesh group number.
A Tail end address: an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address to be used as a tail end TE LSP address by other LSRs belonging to the same mesh  group.
An integer, expressed in octets, that indicates the length of the Tail end name before padding.
A Tail end name: A display string that is allocated to the Tail  end.
The field is of variable length field and is used to facilitate the TE LSP identification.
The TE MESH GROUP sub TLV is used to advertise the desire of an LSR to join/leave a given TE mesh group.
No sub TLV is currently defined for the TE MESH GROUP
The IS IS TE MESH GROUP sub TLV (advertised in the IS
CAPABILITY TLV defined in [RFC4971]) is composed of 1 octet for the type, 1 octet specifying the TLV length and a value field.
The format of the TE MESH GROUP sub
TLV is identical to the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions for IS
The IS IS TE MESH GROUP sub TLV format for IPv4 (Figure 4) and IPv6 (Figure 5) is as follows:
TE MESH GROUP sub TLV format (IPv4 Address)
Tail end IPv6 address 1
TE MESH GROUP sub TLV format (IPv6 Address)
The IS IS TE MESH GROUP sub TLV may contain one or more mesh group entries where each entry correspond to a TE mesh group and is made of the following fields:  A mesh group number that identifies the mesh group number.
A Tail end address: an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address to be used as a tail end TE LSP address by other LSRs belonging to the same mesh  group.
An integer, expressed in octets, that indicates the length of the Tail end name before padding.
A Tail end name: A display string that is allocated to the Tail  end.
The field is of variable length and is used to facilitate the TE LSP identification.
The OSPF TE MESH GROUP TLV is carried within the OSPF Routing Information LSA and the IS IS
TLV is carried within the IS IS Router capability TLV.
As such, elements of procedure are inherited from those defined in [RFC4970] and [RFC4971] for OSPF and IS IS respectively.
Specifically, a router MUST originate a new LSA/LSP whenever the content of this information changes, or whenever required by regular routing procedure (e.g., updates).
The TE MESH GROUP TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST NOT include more than one of each of the IPv4 instances or the IPv6 instance.
If either the IPv4 or the IPv6
OSPF TE MESH GROUP TLV occurs more than once within the OSPF Router Information LSA, only the first instance is processed, subsequent TLV(s)
Similarly, if either the IPv4 or the IPv6 IS IS TE MESH GROUP sub TLV occurs more than once within the IS
IS Router capability TLV, only the first instance is processed, subsequent TLV(s)
The TE MESH GROUP TLV is advertised within an OSPF Router Information opaque LSA (opaque type of 4, opaque ID of 0) for OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and within a new LSA (Router Information LSA) for OSPFv3 [RFC2740].
The Router Information LSAs for OSPFv2
and OSPFv3 are defined in [RFC4970].
A router MUST originate a new OSPF router information LSA whenever the content of any of the advertised TLV changes or whenever required by the regular OSPF procedure (LSA update (every LSRefreshTime)).
If an LSR desires to join or leave a particular TE mesh group, it MUST originate a new OSPF Router Information LSA comprising the updated TE MESH GROUP TLV.
In the case of a join, a new entry will be added to the TE MESH GROUP TLV; conversely, if the LSR leaves, a mesh group the corresponding entry will be removed from the TE MESH GROUP TLV.
Note that both operations can be performed in the context of a single LSA update.
An implementation SHOULD be able to detect any change to a previously received TE MESH GROUP TLV from a specific LSR.
As defined in [RFC2370] for OSPVv2 and in [RFC2740] for OSPFv3, the flooding scope of the Router Information LSA is determined by the LSA Opaque type for OSPFv2 and the values of the S1/S2 bits for OSPFv3.
For OSPFv2 Router Information opaque LSA:  Link local scope: type 9;
Area local scope: type 10;  Routing domain scope: type 11.
In this case, the flooding scope is equivalent to the Type 5 LSA flooding scope.
For OSPFv3 Router Information LSA:
OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the S1 and S2 bits cleared;  Area local scope: OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the S1 bit set and the S2 bit cleared;  Routing domain scope: OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with S1 bit cleared and the S2 bit set.
A router may generate multiple OSPF Router Information LSAs with different flooding scopes.
The TE MESH GROUP TLV may be advertised within an Area local or Routing domain scope Router Information LSA, depending on the MPLS TE mesh group profile:
If the MPLS TE mesh group is contained within a single area (all the LSRs of the mesh group are contained within a single area), the TE MESH GROUP TLV MUST be generated within an Area local Router Information LSA.
If the MPLS TE mesh group spans multiple OSPF areas, the TE mesh  group TLV MUST be generated within a Routing domain scope router information LSA.
The TE MESH GROUP sub
TLV is advertised within the IS
Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in [RFC4971].
MUST originate a new IS IS LSP whenever the content of any of the advertised sub TLV changes or whenever required by regular IS IS procedure (LSP updates).
If an LSR desires to join or leave a particular TE mesh group, it MUST originate a new LSP comprising the refreshed IS IS Router capability TLV comprising the updated TE MESH GROUP sub TLV.
In the case of a join, a new entry will be added to the TE MESH GROUP sub TLV; conversely, if the LSR leaves a mesh group, the corresponding entry will be deleted from the TE MESH GROUP sub TLV.
Note that both operations can be performed in the context of a single update.
An implementation SHOULD be able to detect any change to a previously received TE MESH GROUP sub TLV from a specific LSR.
If the flooding scope of a TE MESH GROUP sub TLV is limited to an IS IS level/area, the sub TLV MUST not be leaked across level/area and the S flag of the Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST be cleared.
Conversely, if the flooding scope of a TE MESH GROUP sub TLV is the entire routing domain, the TLV MUST be leaked across IS IS levels/areas, and the S flag of the Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST be set.
In both cases, the flooding rules specified in [RFC4971] apply.
As specified in [RFC4971], a router may generate multiple IS IS Router CAPABILITY TLVs within an IS IS LSP with different flooding scopes.
The TE MESH GROUP TLVs defined in this document
do not introduce any interoperability issue.
For OSPF, a router not supporting the TE  MESH GROUP
TLV SHOULD just silently ignore the TLV as specified in [RFC2370].
For an IS IS, a router not supporting the TE MESH GROUP sub
TLV SHOULD just silently ignore the sub TLV.
The registry for the Router Information LSA is defined in [RFC4970].
IANA assigned a new OSPF TLV code point for the TE MESH GROUP TLVs carried within the Router Information LSA.

TE MESH GROUP TLV (IPv6)
RFC 4972 (this doc) 7.2.
IS IS The registry for the Router Capability TLV is defined in [RFC4971].
IANA assigned a new IS IS sub TLV code point for the TE MESH GROUP
sub TLVs carried within the IS

The function described in this document does not create any new security issues for the OSPF and IS IS protocols.
Security considerations are covered in [RFC2328] and [RFC2740] for the base OSPF protocol and in [RFC1195] for IS IS.
It must be noted that the advertisement of "fake" TE Mesh Group membership(s) by a mis  configured or malicious LSR Y would not have any major impact on the network (other than overloading the IGP), such as triggering the set up of new MPLS TE LSP: indeed, for a new TE LSP originated by another LSR X destined to LSR Y to be set up, the same TE Mesh group membership must be configured on both LSRs.
Thus such fake advertisement could not amplify any Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
