  - "1. Introduction\n   This document specifies payload formats for encapsulating\
    \ both\n   consumer- and professional-use DV format data streams into the Real-\n\
    \   time Transport Protocol (RTP), version 2 [6].  DV compression audio\n   and\
    \ video formats were designed for helical-scan magnetic tape media.\n   The DV\
    \ standards for consumer-market devices, the IEC 61883 and 61834\n   series, cover\
    \ many aspects of consumer-use digital video, including\n   mechanical specifications\
    \ of a cassette, magnetic recording format,\n   error correction on the magnetic\
    \ tape, DCT video encoding format, and\n   audio encoding format [1].  The digital\
    \ interface part of IEC 61883\n   defines an interface on an IEEE 1394 network\
    \ [2,3].  This\n   specification set supports several video formats: SD-VCR (Standard\n\
    \   Definition), HD-VCR (High Definition), SDL-VCR (Standard Definition -\n  \
    \ Long), PALPlus, DVB (Digital Video Broadcast) and ATV (Advanced\n   Television).\
    \  North American formats are indicated with a number of\n   lines and \"/60\"\
    , while European formats use \"/50\".  DV standards\n   extended for professional\
    \ use were published by SMPTE as 306M and\n   314M, for different sampling systems,\
    \ higher color resolution, and\n   faster bit rates [4,5].\n   There are two kinds\
    \ of DV, one for consumer use and the other for\n   professional.  The original\
    \ \"DV\" specification designed for\n   consumer-use digital VCRs is approved\
    \ as the IEC 61834 standard set.\n   The specifications for professional DV are\
    \ published as SMPTE 306M\n   and 314M.  Both encoding formats are based on consumer\
    \ DV and used in\n   SMPTE D-7 and D-9 video systems.  The RTP payload format\
    \ specified in\n   this document supports IEC 61834 consumer DV and professional\
    \ SMPTE\n   306M and 314M (DV-Based) formats.\n   IEC 61834 also includes magnetic\
    \ tape recording for digital TV\n   broadcasting systems (such as DVB and ATV)\
    \ that use MPEG2 encoding.\n   The payload format for encapsulating MPEG2 into\
    \ RTP has already been\n   defined in RFC 2250 [7] and others.\n   Consequently,\
    \ the payload specified in this document will support six\n   video formats of\
    \ the IEC standard: SD-VCR (525/60, 625/50), HD-VCR\n   (1125/60, 1250/50) and\
    \ SDL-VCR (525/60, 625/50), and six of the SMPTE\n   standards: 306M (525/60,\
    \ 625/50), 314M 25Mbps (525/60, 625/50) and\n   314M 50Mbps (525/60, 625/50).\
    \  In the future it can be extended into\n   other high-definition formats.\n\
    \   Throughout this specification, we make extensive use of the\n   terminology\
    \ of IEC and SMPTE standards.  The reader should consult\n   the original references\
    \ for definitions of these terms.\n"

- title: 2. DV format encoding
  contents:
  - "2. DV format encoding\n   The DV format only uses the DCT compression technique\
    \ within each\n   frame, contrasted with the interframe compression of the MPEG\
    \ video\n   standards [9,10].  All video data, including audio and other system\n\
    \   data, are managed within the picture frame unit of video.\n   The DV video\
    \ encoding is composed of a three-level hierarchical\n   structure.  A picture\
    \ frame is divided into rectangle- or clipped-\n   rectangle-shaped DCT super\
    \ blocks.  DCT super blocks are divided into\n   27 rectangle- or square-shaped\
    \ DCT macro blocks.\n   Audio data is encoded with PCM format.  The sampling frequency\
    \ is 32\n   kHz, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz and the quantization is 12-bit non-linear,\n\
    \   16-bit linear or 20-bit linear.  The number of channels may be up to\n   8.\
    \  Only certain combinations of these parameters are allowed\n   depending upon\
    \ the video format; the restrictions are specified in\n   each document.\n   A\
    \ frame of data in the DV format stream is divided into several \"DIF\n   sequences\"\
    .  A DIF sequence is composed of an integral number of 80-\n   byte DIF blocks.\
    \  A DIF block is the primitive unit for all treatment\n   of DV streams.  Each\
    \ DIF block contains a 3-byte ID header that\n   specifies the type of the DIF\
    \ block and its position in the DIF\n   sequence.  Five types of DIF blocks are\
    \ defined: DIF sequence header,\n   Subcode, Video Auxiliary information (VAUX),\
    \ Audio, and Video.  Audio\n   DIF blocks are composed of 5 bytes of Audio Auxiliary\
    \ data (AAUX) and\n   72 bytes of audio data.\n   Each RTP packet starts with\
    \ the RTP header as defined in RFC 1889\n   [6].  No additional payload-format-specific\
    \ header is required for\n   this payload format.\n"
- title: 2.1 RTP header usage
  contents:
  - "2.1 RTP header usage\n   The RTP header fields that have a meaning specific to\
    \ the DV format\n   are described as follows:\n   Payload type (PT): The payload\
    \ type is dynamically assigned by means\n   outside the scope of this document.\
    \  If multiple DV encoding formats\n   are to be used within one RTP session,\
    \ then multiple dynamic payload\n   types MUST be assigned, one for each DV encoding\
    \ format.  The sender\n   MUST change to the corresponding payload type whenever\
    \ the encoding\n   format is changed.\n   Timestamp: 32-bit 90 kHz timestamp representing\
    \ the time at which the\n   first data in the frame was sampled.  All RTP packets\
    \ within the same\n   video frame MUST have the same timestamp.  The timestamp\
    \ SHOULD\n   increment by a multiple of the nominal interval for one frame time,\n\
    \   as given in the following table:\n       Mode        Frame rate (Hz)     \
    \ Increase of one frame\n                                        in 90kHz timestamp\n\
    \      525-60         29.97                   3003\n      625-50         25  \
    \                    3600\n      1125-60        30                      3000\n\
    \      1250-50        25                      3600\n   When the DV stream is obtained\
    \ from an IEEE 1394 interface, the\n   progress of video frame times MAY be monitored\
    \ using the SYT\n   timestamp carried in the CIP header as specified in IEC 61883\
    \ [2].\n   Marker bit (M): The marker bit of the RTP fixed header is set to one\n\
    \   on the last packet of a video frame, and otherwise, must be zero.\n   The\
    \ M bit allows the receiver to know that it has received the last\n   packet of\
    \ a frame so it can display the image without waiting for the\n   first packet\
    \ of the next frame to arrive to detect the frame change.\n   However, detection\
    \ of a frame change MUST NOT rely on the marker bit\n   since the last packet\
    \ of the frame might be lost.  Detection of a\n   frame change MUST be based on\
    \ a difference in the RTP timestamp.\n"
- title: 2.2 DV data encapsulation into RTP payload
  contents:
  - "2.2 DV data encapsulation into RTP payload\n   Integral DIF blocks are placed\
    \ into the RTP payload beginning\n   immediately after the RTP header.  Any number\
    \ of DIF blocks may be\n   packed into one RTP packet, except that all DIF blocks\
    \ in one RTP\n   packet must be from the same video frame.  DIF blocks from the\
    \ next\n   video frame MUST NOT be packed into the same RTP packet even if more\n\
    \   payload space remains.  This requirement stems from the fact that the\n  \
    \ transition from one video frame to the next is indicated by a change\n   in\
    \ the RTP timestamp.  It also reduces the processing complexity on\n   the receiver.\
    \  Since the RTP payload contains an integral number of\n   DIF blocks, the length\
    \ of the RTP payload will be a multiple of 80\n   bytes.\n   Audio and video data\
    \ may be transmitted as one bundled RTP stream or\n   in separate RTP streams\
    \ (unbundled).  The choice MUST be indicated as\n   part of the assignment of\
    \ the dynamic payload type and MUST remain\n   unchanged for the duration of the\
    \ RTP session to avoid complicated\n   procedures of sequence number synchronization.\
    \  The RTP sender MAY\n   omit DIF-sequence header and subcode DIF blocks from\
    \ a stream since\n   the information is either known out-of-band or may not be\
    \ required\n   for RTP transport.  When sending DIF-sequence header and subcode\
    \ DIF\n   blocks, both types of blocks MUST be included in the video stream.\n\
    \   DV streams include \"source\" and \"source control\" packs that carry\n  \
    \ information indispensable for proper decoding, such as aspect ratio,\n   picture\
    \ position, quantization of audio sampling, number of audio\n   channels, audio\
    \ channel assignment, and language of the audio.\n   However, describing all of\
    \ these attributes with a signaling protocol\n   would require large descriptions\
    \ to enumerate all the combinations.\n   Therefore, no Session Description Protocol\
    \ (SDP) [13] parameters for\n   these attributes are defined in this document.\
    \  Instead, the RTP\n   sender MUST transmit at least those VAUX DIF blocks and/or\
    \ audio DIF\n   blocks with AAUX information bytes that include \"source\" and\
    \ \"source\n   control\" packs containing the indispensable information for decoding.\n\
    \   In the case of one bundled stream, DIF blocks for both audio and\n   video\
    \ are packed into RTP packets in the same order as they were\n   encoded.\n  \
    \ In the case of an unbundled stream, only the header, subcode, video\n   and\
    \ VAUX DIF blocks are sent within the video stream.  Audio is sent\n   in a different\
    \ stream if desired, using a different RTP payload type.\n   It is also possible\
    \ to send audio duplicated in a separate stream, in\n   addition to bundling it\
    \ in with the video stream.\n   When using unbundled mode, it is RECOMMENDED that\
    \ the audio stream\n   data be extracted from the DIF blocks and repackaged into\
    \ the\n   corresponding RTP payload format for the audio encoding (DAT12, L16,\n\
    \   L20) [11,12] in order to maximize interoperability with non-DV-\n   capable\
    \ receivers while maintaining the original source quality.\n   In the case of\
    \ unbundled transmission where both audio and video are\n   sent in the DV format,\
    \ the same timestamp SHOULD be used for both\n   audio and video data within the\
    \ same frame to simplify the lip\n   synchronization effort on the receiver. \
    \ Lip synchronization may also\n   be achieved using reference timestamps passed\
    \ in RTCP as described in\n   RFC 1889 [6].\n   The sender MAY reduce the video\
    \ frame rate by discarding the video\n   data and VAUX DIF blocks for some of\
    \ the video frames.  The RTP\n   timestamp must still be incremented to account\
    \ for the discarded\n   frames.  The sender MAY alternatively reduce bandwidth\
    \ by discarding\n   video data DIF blocks for portions of the image which are\
    \ unchanged\n   from the previous image.  To enable this bandwidth reduction,\n\
    \   receivers SHOULD implement an error concealment strategy to\n   accommodate\
    \ lost or missing DIF blocks, e.g., repeating the\n   corresponding DIF block\
    \ from the previous image.\n"

- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   RTP packets using the payload format defined in\
    \ this specification\n   are subject to the security considerations discussed\
    \ in the RTP\n   specification [6], and any appropriate RTP profile.  This implies\n\
    \   that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption.\n   Because\
    \ the data compression used with this payload format is applied\n   to end-to-end,\
    \ encryption may be performed after compression so there\n   is no conflict between\
    \ the two operations.\n   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data\
    \ encodings using\n   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end\n\
    \   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams\n   into\
    \ the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to\n   be overloaded.\
    \  However, this encoding does not exhibit any\n   significant non-uniformity.\n\
    \   As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may\n   be\
    \ overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either\n   desired or\
    \ undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to\n   discard packets\
    \ from undesired sources, but the processing cost of\n   the authentication itself\
    \ may be too high.  In a multicast\n   environment, pruning of specific sources\
    \ may be implemented in future\n   versions of IGMP [14] and in multicast routing\
    \ protocols to allow a\n   receiver to select which sources are allowed to reach\
