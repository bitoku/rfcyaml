  - "1.  Scope and Introduction\n   As Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is becoming\
    \ a more widespread\n   technology for providing IP virtual private network (VPN)\
    \ services,\n   the security of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture is of increasing\n\
    \   concern to service providers and VPN customers.  This document gives\n   an\
    \ overview of the security of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture that\n   is described\
    \ in RFC 4364 [1], and compares it with the security of\n   traditional layer-2\
    \ services such as ATM or Frame Relay.\n   The term \"MPLS core\" is defined for\
    \ this document as the set of\n   Provider Edge (PE) and provider (P) routers\
    \ that provide a BGP/MPLS\n   IP VPN service, typically under the control of a\
    \ single service\n   provider (SP).  This document assumes that the MPLS core\
    \ network is\n   trusted and secure.  Thus, it does not address basic security\n\
    \   concerns such as securing the network elements against unauthorised\n   access,\
    \ misconfigurations of the core, or attacks internal to the\n   core.  A customer\
    \ that does not wish to trust the service provider\n   network must use additional\
    \ security mechanisms such as IPsec over\n   the MPLS infrastructure.\n   This\
    \ document analyses only the security features of BGP/MPLS IP\n   VPNs, not the\
    \ security of routing protocols in general.  IPsec\n   technology is also not\
    \ covered, except to highlight the combination\n   of MPLS VPNs with IPsec.\n\
    \   The overall security of a system has three aspects: the architecture,\n  \
    \ the implementation, and the operation of the system.  Security issues\n   can\
    \ exist in any of these aspects.  This document analyses only the\n   architectural\
    \ security of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, not implementation or\n   operational security\
    \ issues.\n   This document is targeted at technical staff of service providers\
    \ and\n   enterprises.  Knowledge of the basic BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture as\n\
    \   described in RFC 4364 [1] is required to understand this document.\n   For\
    \ specific Layer 3 VPN terminology and reference models refer to\n   [11].\n \
    \  Section 2 of this document specifies the typical VPN requirements a\n   VPN\
    \ user might have, and section 3 analyses how RFC 4364 [1]\n   addresses these\
    \ requirements.  Section 4 discusses specific security\n   issues of multi-AS\
    \ (Autonomous System) MPLS architectures, and\n   section 5 lists security features\
    \ that are not covered by this\n   architecture and therefore need to be addressed\
    \ separately.  Section\n   6 highlights potential security issues on layer 2 that\
    \ might impact\n   the overall security of a BGP/MPLS IP VPN service.  The findings\
    \ of\n   this document are summarized in section 7.\n"
- title: 2.  Security Requirements of VPN Networks
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Requirements of VPN Networks\n   Both service providers offering\
    \ any type of VPN services and\n   customers using them have specific demands\
    \ for security.  Mostly,\n   they compare MPLS-based solutions with traditional\
    \ layer 2-based VPN\n   solutions such as Frame Relay and ATM, since these are\
    \ widely\n   deployed and accepted.  This section outlines the typical security\n\
    \   requirements for VPN networks.  The following section discusses if\n   and\
    \ how BGP/MPLS IP VPNs address these requirements, for both the\n   MPLS core\
    \ and the connected VPNs.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Address Space, Routing, and Traffic Separation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Address Space, Routing, and Traffic Separation\n   Non-intersecting layer\
    \ 3 VPNs of the same VPN service are assumed to\n   have independent address spaces.\
    \  For example, two non-intersecting\n   VPNs may each use the same 10/8 network\
    \ addresses without conflict.\n   In addition, traffic from one VPN must never\
    \ enter another VPN.  This\n   implies separation of routing protocol information,\
    \ so that routing\n   tables must also be separate per VPN.  Specifically:\n \
    \  o  Any VPN must be able to use the same address space as any other\n      VPN.\n\
    \   o  Any VPN must be able to use the same address space as the MPLS\n      core.\n\
    \   o  Traffic, including routing traffic, from one VPN must never flow\n    \
    \  to another VPN.\n   o  Routing information, as well as distribution and processing\
    \ of\n      that information, for one VPN instance must be independent from\n\
    \      any other VPN instance.\n   o  Routing information, as well as distribution\
    \ and processing of\n      that information, for one VPN instance must be independent\
    \ from\n      the core.\n   From a security point of view, the basic requirement\
    \ is to prevent\n   packets destined to a host a.b.c.d within a given VPN reaching\
    \ a host\n   with the same address in another VPN or in the core, and to prevent\n\
    \   routing packets to another VPN even if it does not contain that\n   destination\
    \ address.\n   Confidentiality, as defined in the L3VPN Security Framework [11],\
    \ is\n   a requirement that goes beyond simple isolation of VPNs and provides\n\
    \   protection against eavesdropping on any transmission medium.\n   Encryption\
    \ is the mechanism used to provide confidentiality.  This\n   document considers\
    \ confidentiality an optional VPN requirement, since\n   many existing VPN deployments\
    \ do not encrypt transit traffic.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Hiding the Core Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Hiding the Core Infrastructure\n   The internal structure of the core network\
    \ (MPLS PE and P elements)\n   should not be externally visible.  Whilst breaking\
    \ this requirement\n   is not a security problem in itself, many service providers\
    \ believe\n   it is advantageous if the internal addresses and network structure\n\
    \   are hidden from the outside world.  An argument is that denial-of-\n   service\
    \ (DoS) attacks against a core router are much easier to carry\n   out if an attacker\
    \ knows the router addresses.  Addresses can always\n   be guessed, but attacks\
    \ are more difficult if addresses are not\n   known.  The core should be as invisible\
    \ to the outside world as a\n   comparable layer 2 infrastructure (e.g., Frame\
    \ Relay, ATM).  Core\n   network elements should also not be accessible from within\
    \ a VPN.\n   Security should never rely entirely on obscurity, i.e., the hiding\
    \ of\n   information.  Services should be equally secure if the implementation\n\
    \   is known.  However, there is a strong market perception that hiding\n   of\
    \ details is advantageous.  This point addresses that market\n   perception.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Resistance to Attacks
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Resistance to Attacks\n   There are two basic types of attacks: DoS attacks,\
    \ where resources\n   become unavailable to authorised users, and intrusions,\
    \ where\n   resources become available to unauthorised users.  BGP/MPLS IP VPN\n\
    \   networks must provide at least the same level of protection against\n   both\
    \ forms of attack as current layer 2 networks.\n   For intrusions, there are two\
    \ fundamental ways to protect the\n   network: first, to harden protocols that\
    \ could be abused (e.g.,\n   Telnet into a router), and second, to make the network\
    \ as\n   inaccessible as possible.  This is achieved by a combination of\n   packet\
    \ filtering / firewalling and address hiding, as discussed\n   above.\n   DoS\
    \ attacks are easier to execute, since a single known IP address\n   might be\
    \ enough information to attack a machine.  This can be done\n   using normal \"\
    permitted\" traffic, but using higher than normal packet\n   rates, so that other\
    \ users cannot access the targeted machine.  The\n   only way to be invulnerable\
    \ to this kind of attack is to make sure\n   that machines are not reachable,\
    \ again by packet filtering and\n   optionally by address hiding.\n   This document\
    \ concentrates on protecting the core network against\n   attacks from the \"\
    outside\", i.e., the Internet and connected VPNs.\n   Protection against attacks\
    \ from the \"inside\", i.e., an attacker who\n   has logical or physical access\
    \ to the core network, is not discussed\n   here.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Impossibility of Label Spoofing
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Impossibility of Label Spoofing\n   Assuming the address and traffic separation\
    \ discussed above, an\n   attacker might try to access other VPNs by inserting\
    \ packets with a\n   label that he does not \"own\".  This could be done from\
    \ the outside,\n   i.e., another Customer Edge (CE) router or from the Internet,\
    \ or from\n   within the MPLS core.  The latter case (from within the core) will\n\
    \   not be discussed, since we assume that the core network is provided\n   securely.\
    \  Should protection against an insecure core be required, it\n   is necessary\
    \ to use security protocols such as IPsec across the MPLS\n   infrastructure,\
    \ at least from CE to CE, since the PEs belong to the\n   core.\n   Depending\
    \ on the way that CE routers are connected to PE routers, it\n   might be possible\
    \ to intrude into a VPN that is connected to the same\n   PE, using layer 2 attack\
    \ mechanisms such as 802.1Q-label spoofing or\n   ATM VPI/VCI spoofing.  Layer\
    \ 2 security issues will be discussed in\n   section 6.\n   It is required that\
    \ VPNs cannot abuse the MPLS label mechanisms or\n   protocols to gain unauthorised\
    \ access to other VPNs or the core.\n"

    \ VPN architecture is analysed with\n   respect to the security requirements listed\
    \ above.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Address Space, Routing, and Traffic Separation
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Address Space, Routing, and Traffic Separation\n   BGP/MPLS allows distinct\
    \ IP VPNs to use the same address space, which\n   can also be private address\
    \ space (RFC 1918 [2]).  This is achieved\n   by adding a 64-bit Route Distinguisher\
    \ (RD) to each IPv4 route,\n   making VPN-unique addresses also unique in the\
    \ MPLS core.  This\n   \"extended\" address is also called a \"VPN-IPv4 address\"\
    .  Thus,\n   customers of a BGP/MPLS IP VPN service do not need to change their\n\
    \   current addressing plan.\n   Each PE router maintains a separate Virtual Routing\
    \ and Forwarding\n   instance (VRF) for each connected VPN.  A VRF includes the\
    \ addresses\n   of that VPN as well as the addresses of the PE routers with which\
    \ the\n   CE routers are peering.  All addresses of a VRF, including these PE\n\
    \   addresses, belong logically to the VPN and are accessible from the\n   VPN.\
    \  The fact that PE addresses are accessible to the VPN is not an\n   issue if\
    \ static routing is used between the PE and CE routers, since\n   packet filters\
    \ can be deployed to block access to all addresses of\n   the VRF on the PE router.\
    \  If dynamic routing protocols are used, the\n   CE routers need to have the\
    \ address of the peer PE router in the core\n   configured.  In an environment\
    \ where the service provider manages the\n   CE routers as CPE, this can be invisible\
    \ to the customer.  The\n   address space on the CE-PE link (including the peering\
    \ PE address) is\n   considered part of the VPN address space.  Since address\
    \ space can\n   overlap between VPNs, the CE-PE link addresses can overlap between\n\
    \   VPNs.  For practical management considerations, SPs typically address\n  \
    \ CE-PE links from a global pool, maintaining uniqueness across the\n   core.\n\
    \   Routing separation between VPNs can also be achieved.  Each VRF is\n   populated\
    \ with routes from one VPN through statically configured\n   routes or through\
    \ routing protocols that run between the PE and CE\n   router.  Since each VPN\
    \ is associated with a separate VRF there is no\n   interference between VPNs\
    \ on the PE router.\n   Across the core to the other PE routers separation is\
    \ maintained with\n   unique VPN identifiers in multiprotocol BGP, the Route Distinguishers\n\
    \   (RDs).  VPN routes including the RD are exclusively exchanged between\n  \
    \ PE routers by Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP, RFC 2858 [8]) across the\n   core.\
    \  These BGP routing updates are not re-distributed into the\n   core, but only\
    \ to the other PE routers, where the information is kept\n   again in VPN-specific\
    \ VRFs.  Thus, routing across a BGP/MPLS network\n   is separate per VPN.\n  \
    \ On the data plane, traffic separation is achieved by the ingress PE\n   pre-pending\
    \ a VPN-specific label to the packets.  The packets with\n   the VPN labels are\
    \ sent through the core to the egress PE, where the\n   VPN label is used to select\
    \ the egress VRF.\n   Given the addressing, routing, and traffic separation across\
    \ an BGP/\n   MPLS IP VPN core network, it can be assumed that this architecture\n\
    \   offers in this respect the same security as a layer-2 VPN.  It is not\n  \
    \ possible to intrude from a VPN or the core into another VPN unless\n   this\
    \ has been explicitly configured.\n   If and when confidentiality is required,\
    \ it can be achieved in BGP/\n   MPLS IP VPNs by overlaying encryption services\
    \ over the network.\n   However, encryption is not a standard service on BGP/MPLS\
    \ IP VPNs.\n   See also section 5.2.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Hiding of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN Core Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Hiding of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN Core Infrastructure\n   Service providers\
    \ and end-customers do not normally want their\n   network topology revealed to\
    \ the outside.  This makes attacks more\n   difficult to execute: If an attacker\
    \ doesn't know the address of a\n   victim, he can only guess the IP addresses\
    \ to attack.  Since most DoS\n   attacks don't provide direct feedback to the\
    \ attacker it would be\n   difficult to attack the network.  It has to be mentioned\
    \ specifically\n   that information hiding as such does not provide security.\
    \  However,\n   in the market this is a perceived requirement.\n   With a known\
    \ IP address, a potential attacker can launch a DoS attack\n   more easily against\
    \ that device.  Therefore, the ideal is to not\n   reveal any information about\
    \ the internal network to the outside\n   world.  This applies to the customer\
    \ network and the core.  A number\n   of additional security measures also have\
    \ to be taken: most of all,\n   extensive packet filtering.\n   For security reasons,\
    \ it is recommended for any core network to\n   filter packets from the \"outside\"\
    \ (Internet or connected VPNs)\n   destined to the core infrastructure.  This\
    \ makes it very hard to\n   attack the core, although some functionality such\
    \ as pinging core\n   routers will be lost.  Traceroute across the core will still\
    \ work,\n   since it addresses a destination outside the core.\n   MPLS does not\
    \ reveal unnecessary information to the outside, not even\n   to customer VPNs.\
    \  The addressing of the core can be done with\n   private addresses (RFC 1918\
    \ [2]) or public addresses.  Since the\n   interface to the VPNs as well as the\
    \ Internet is BGP, there is no\n   need to reveal any internal information.  The\
    \ only information\n   required in the case of a routing protocol between PE and\
    \ CE is the\n   address of the PE router.  If no dynamic routing is required,\
    \ static\n   routing on unnumbered interfaces can be configured between the PE\
    \ and\n   CE.  With this measure, the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core can be kept\n   completely\
    \ hidden.\n   Customer VPNs must advertise their routes to the BGP/MPLS IP VPN\
    \ core\n   (dynamically or statically), to ensure reachability across their VPN.\n\
    \   In some cases, VPN users prefer that the service provider have no\n   visibility\
    \ of the addressing plan of the VPN.  The following has to\n   be noted: First,\
    \ the information known to the core is not about\n   specific hosts, but networks\
    \ (routes); this offers a degree of\n   abstraction.  Second, in a VPN-only BGP/MPLS\
    \ IP VPN network (no\n   Internet access) this is equal to existing layer-2 models,\
    \ where the\n   customer has to trust the service provider.  Also, in a Frame\
    \ Relay\n   or ATM network, routing and addressing information about the VPNs\
    \ can\n   be seen on the core network.\n   In a VPN service with shared Internet\
    \ access, the service provider\n   will typically announce the routes of customers\
    \ who wish to use the\n   Internet to his upstream or peer providers.  This can\
    \ be done\n   directly if the VPN customer uses public address space, or via\n\
    \   Network Address Translation (NAT) to obscure the addressing\n   information\
    \ of the customers' networks.  In either case, the customer\n   does not reveal\
    \ more information than would be revealed by a general\n   Internet service. \
    \ Core information will not be revealed, except for\n   the peering address(es)\
    \ of the PE router(s) that hold(s) the peering\n   with the Internet.  These addresses\
    \ must be secured as in a\n   traditional IP backbone.\n   In summary, in a pure\
    \ MPLS-VPN service, where no Internet access is\n   provided, information hiding\
    \ is as good as on a comparable FR or ATM\n   network.  No addressing information\
    \ is revealed to third parties or\n   the Internet.  If a customer chooses to\
    \ access the Internet via the\n   BGP/MPLS IP VPN core, he will have to reveal\
    \ the same information as\n   required for a normal Internet service.  NAT can\
    \ be used for further\n   obscurity.  Being reachable from the Internet automatically\
    \ exposes a\n   customer network to additional security threats.  Appropriate\n\
    \   security mechanisms have to be deployed such as firewalls and\n   intrusion\
    \ detection systems.  This is true for any Internet access,\n   over MPLS or direct.\n\
    \   A BGP/MPLS IP VPN network with no interconnections to the Internet\n   has\
    \ security equal to that of FR or ATM VPN networks.  With an\n   Internet access\
    \ from the MPLS cloud, the service provider has to\n   reveal at least one IP\
    \ address (of the peering PE router) to the next\n   provider, and thus to the\
    \ outside world.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Resistance to Attacks
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Resistance to Attacks\n   Section 3.1 shows that it is impossible to directly\
    \ intrude into\n   other VPNs.  Another possibility is to attack the MPLS core\
    \ and try\n   to attack other VPNs from there.  As shown above, it is impossible\
    \ to\n   address a P router directly.  The only addresses reachable from a VPN\n\
    \   or the Internet are the peering addresses of the PE routers.  Thus,\n   there\
    \ are two basic ways that the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core can be\n   attacked:\n   1.\
    \  By attacking the PE routers directly.\n   2.  By attacking the signaling mechanisms\
    \ of MPLS (mostly routing).\n   To attack an element of a BGP/MPLS IP VPN network,\
    \ it is first\n   necessary to know the address of the element.  As discussed\
    \ in\n   section 3.2, the addressing structure of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core is\n\
    \   hidden from the outside world.  Thus, an attacker cannot know the IP\n   address\
    \ of any router in the core to attack.  The attacker could\n   guess addresses\
    \ and send packets to these addresses.  However, due to\n   the address separation\
    \ of MPLS each incoming packet will be treated\n   as belonging to the address\
    \ space of the customer.  Thus, it is\n   impossible to reach an internal router,\
    \ even by guessing IP\n   addresses.  There is only one exception to this rule,\
    \ which is the\n   peer interface of the PE router.  This address of the PE is\
    \ the only\n   attack point from the outside (a VPN or Internet).\n   The routing\
    \ between a VPN and the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core can be\n   configured two ways:\n\
    \   1.  Static: In this case, the PE routers are configured with static\n    \
    \   routes to the networks behind each CE, and the CEs are configured\n      \
    \ to statically point to the PE router for any network in other\n       parts\
    \ of the VPN (mostly a default route).  There are two sub-\n       cases: The\
    \ static route can point to the IP address of the PE\n       router or to an interface\
    \ of the CE router (e.g., serial0).\n   2.  Dynamic: A routing protocol (e.g.,\
    \ Routing Information Protocol\n       (RIP), OSPF, BGP) is used to exchange routing\
    \ information between\n       the CE and PE at each peering point.\n   In the\
    \ case of a static route that points to an interface, the CE\n   router doesn't\
    \ need to know any IP addresses of the core network or\n   even of the PE router.\
    \  This has the disadvantage of needing a more\n   extensive (static) configuration,\
    \ but is the most secure option.  In\n   this case, it is also possible to configure\
    \ packet filters on the PE\n   interface to deny any packet to the PE interface.\
    \  This protects the\n   router and the whole core from attack.\n   In all other\
    \ cases, each CE router needs to know at least the router\n   ID (RID, i.e., peer\
    \ IP address) of the PE router in the core, and\n   thus has a potential destination\
    \ for an attack.  One could imagine\n   various attacks on various services running\
    \ on a router.  In\n   practice, access to the PE router over the CE-PE interface\
    \ can be\n   limited to the required routing protocol by using access control\n\
    \   lists (ACLs).  This limits the point of attack to one routing\n   protocol,\
    \ for example, BGP.  A potential attack could be to send an\n   extensive number\
    \ of routes, or to flood the PE router with routing\n   updates.  Both could lead\
    \ to a DoS, however, not to unauthorised\n   access.\n   To reduce this risk,\
    \ it is necessary to configure the routing\n   protocol on the PE router to operate\
    \ as securely as possible.  This\n   can be done in various ways:\n   o  By accepting\
    \ only routing protocol packets, and only from the CE\n      router.  The inbound\
    \ ACL on each CE interface of the PE router\n      should allow only routing protocol\
    \ packets from the CE to the PE.\n   o  By configuring MD5 authentication for\
    \ routing protocols.  This is\n      available for BGP (RFC 2385 [6]), OSPF (RFC\
    \ 2154 [4]), and RIP2\n      (RFC 2082 [3]), for example.  This avoids packets\
    \ being spoofed\n      from other parts of the customer network than the CE router.\
    \  It\n      requires the service provider and customer to agree on a shared\n\
    \      secret between all CE and PE routers.  It is necessary to do this\n   \
    \   for all VPN customers.  It is not sufficient to do this only for\n      the\
    \ customer with the highest security requirements.\n   o  By configuring parameters\
    \ of the routing protocol to further\n      secure this communication.  For example,\
    \ the rate of routing\n      updates should be restricted where possible (in BGP\
    \ through\n      damping); a maximum number of routes accepted per VRF and per\n\
    \      routing neighbor should be configured where possible; and the\n      Generalized\
    \ TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM; RFC 3682 [10]) should be\n      used for all supported\
    \ protocols.\n   In summary, it is not possible to intrude from one VPN into other\n\
    \   VPNs, or the core.  However, it is theoretically possible to attack\n   the\
    \ routing protocol port to execute a DoS attack against the PE\n   router.  This\
    \ in turn might have a negative impact on other VPNs on\n   this PE router.  For\
    \ this reason, PE routers must be extremely well\n   secured, especially on their\
    \ interfaces to CE routers.  ACLs must be\n   configured to limit access only\
    \ to the port(s) of the routing\n   protocol, and only from the CE router.  Further\
    \ routing protocols'\n   security mechanisms such as MD5 authentication, maximum\
    \ prefix\n   limits, and Time to Live (TTL) security mechanisms should be used\
    \ on\n   all PE-CE peerings.  With all these security measures, the only\n   possible\
    \ attack is a DoS attack against the routing protocol itself.\n   BGP has a number\
    \ of countermeasures such as prefix filtering and\n   damping built into the protocol,\
    \ to assist with stability.  It is\n   also easy to track the source of such a\
    \ potential DoS attack.\n   Without dynamic routing between CEs and PEs, the security\
    \ is\n   equivalent to the security of ATM or Frame Relay networks.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Label Spoofing
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Label Spoofing\n   Similar to IP spoofing attacks, where an attacker fakes\
    \ the source IP\n   address of a packet, it is also theoretically possible to\
    \ spoof the\n   label of an MPLS packet.  In the first section, the assumption\
    \ was\n   made that the core network is trusted.  If this assumption cannot be\n\
    \   made, IPsec must be run over the MPLS cloud.  Thus in this section\n   the\
    \ emphasis is on whether it is possible to insert packets with\n   spoofed labels\
    \ into the MPLS network from the outside, i.e., from a\n   VPN (CE router) or\
    \ from the Internet.\n   The interface between a CE router and its peering PE\
    \ router is an IP\n   interface, i.e., without labels.  The CE router is unaware\
    \ of the\n   MPLS core, and thinks it is sending IP packets to another router.\n\
    \   The \"intelligence\" is done in the PE device, where, based on the\n   configuration,\
    \ the label is chosen and pre-pended to the packet.\n   This is the case for all\
    \ PE routers, towards CE routers as well as\n   the upstream service provider.\
    \  All interfaces into the MPLS cloud\n   only require IP packets, without labels.\n\
    \   For security reasons, a PE router should never accept a packet with a\n  \
    \ label from a CE router.  RFC 3031 [9] specifies: \"Therefore, when a\n   labeled\
    \ packet is received with an invalid incoming label, it MUST be\n   discarded,\
    \ UNLESS it is determined by some means (not within the\n   scope of the current\
    \ document) that forwarding it unlabeled cannot\n   cause any harm.\"  Since accepting\
    \ labels on the CE interface would\n   potentially allow passing packets to other\
    \ VPNs it is not permitted\n   by the RFC.\n   Thus, it is impossible for an outside\
    \ attacker to send labeled\n   packets into the BGP/MPLS IP VPN core.\n   There\
    \ remains the possibility to spoof the IP address of a packet\n   being sent to\
    \ the MPLS core.  Since there is strict address\n   separation within the PE router,\
    \ and each VPN has its own VRF, this\n   can only harm the VPN the spoofed packet\
    \ originated from; that is, a\n   VPN customer can attack only himself.  MPLS\
    \ doesn't add any security\n   risk here.\n   The Inter-AS and Carrier's Carrier\
    \ cases are special cases, since on\n   the interfaces between providers typically\
    \ packets with labels are\n   exchanged.  See section 4 for an analysis of these\
    \ architectures.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Security of Advanced BGP/MPLS IP VPN Architectures\n   The BGP/MPLS IP VPN\
    \ architecture described in RFC 2547 [7] defines\n   the PE-CE interface as the\
    \ only external interface seen from the\n   service provider network.  In this\

- title: 4.1.  Carriers' Carrier
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Carriers' Carrier\n   In the Carriers' Carrier (CsC) architecture, the\
    \ CE is linked to a\n   VRF on the PE.  The CE may send labeled packets to the\
    \ PE.  The label\n   has been previously assigned by the PE to the CE, and represents\
    \ the\n   label switched path (LSP) from this CE to the remote CE via the\n  \
    \ carrier's network.\n   RFC 4364 [1] specifies for this case: \"When the PE receives\
    \ a labeled\n   packet from a CE, it must verify that the top label is one that\
    \ was\n   distributed to that CE.\"  This ensures that the CE can only use\n \
    \  labels that the PE correctly associates with the corresponding VPN.\n   Packets\
    \ with incorrect labels will be discarded, and thus label\n   spoofing is impossible.\n\
    \   The use of label maps on the PE leaves the control of the label\n   information\
    \ entirely with the PE, so that this has no impact on the\n   security of the\
    \ solution.\n   The packet underneath the top label will -- as in standard RFC\
    \ 2547\n   [7] networks -- remain local to the customer carrier's VPN and not\
    \ be\n   inspected in the carriers' carrier core.  Potential spoofing of\n   subsequent\
    \ labels or IP addresses remains local to the carrier's VPN;\n   it has no implication\
    \ on the carriers' carrier core nor on other VPNs\n   in that core.  This is specifically\
    \ stated in section 6 of RFC 4364\n   [1].\n   Note that if the PE and CE are\
    \ interconnected using a shared layer 2\n   infrastructure such as a switch, attacks\
    \ are possible on layer 2,\n   which might enable a third party on the shared\
    \ layer 2 network to\n   intrude into a VPN on that PE router.  RFC 4364 [1] specifies\n\
    \   therefore that either all devices on a shared layer 2 network have to\n  \
    \ be part of the same VPN, or the layer 2 network must be split\n   logically\
    \ to avoid this issue.  This will be discussed in more detail\n   in section 6.\n\
    \   In the CsC architecture, the customer carrier needs to trust the\n   carriers'\
    \ carrier for correct configuration and operation.  The\n   customer of the carrier\
    \ thus implicitly needs to trust both his\n   carrier and the carriers' carrier.\n\
    \   In summary, a correctly configured carriers' carrier network provides\n  \
    \ the same level of security as comparable layer 2 networks or\n   traditional\
    \ RFC 2547 [7] networks.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Inter-Provider Backbones
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Inter-Provider Backbones\n   RFC 4364 [1] specifies three sub-cases for\
    \ the inter-provider\n   backbone (Inter-AS) case.\n   a) VRF-to-VRF connections\
    \ at the autonomous system border routers\n   (ASBRs).\n   In this case, each\
    \ PE sees and treats the other PE as a CE; each will\n   not accept labeled packets,\
    \ and there is no signaling between the PEs\n   other than inside the VRFs on\
    \ both sides.  Thus, the separation of\n   the VPNs on both sides and the security\
    \ of those are the same as on a\n   single AS RFC 2547 [7] network.  This has\
    \ already been shown to have\n   the same security properties as traditional layer\
    \ 2 VPNs.\n   This solution has potential scalability issues in that the ASBRs\
    \ need\n   to maintain a VRF per VPN, and all of the VRFs need to hold all\n \
    \  routes of the specific VPNs.  Thus, an ASBR can run into memory\n   problems\
    \ affecting all VPNs if one single VRF contains too many\n   routes.  Thus, the\
    \ service providers needs to ensure that the ASBRs\n   are properly dimensioned\
    \ and apply appropriate security measures such\n   as limiting the number of prefixes\
    \ per VRF.\n   The two service providers connecting their VPNs in this way must\n\
    \   trust each other.  Since the VPNs are separated on different\n   (sub-)interfaces,\
    \ all signaling between ASBRs remains within a given\n   VPN.  This means that\
    \ dynamic cross-VPN security breaches are\n   impossible.  It is conceivable that\
    \ a service provider connects a\n   specific VPN to the wrong interface, thus\
    \ interconnecting two VPNs\n   that should not be connected.  This must be controlled\
    \ operationally.\n   b) EBGP redistribution of labeled VPN-IPv4 routes from AS\
    \ to\n   neighboring AS.\n   In this case, ASBRs on both sides hold full routing\
    \ information for\n   all shared VPNs on both sides.  This is not held in separate\
    \ VRFs,\n   but in the BGP database.  (This is typically limited to the Inter-AS\n\
    \   VPNs through filtering.)  The separation inside the PE is maintained\n   through\
    \ the use of VPN-IPv4 addresses.  The control plane between the\n   ASBRs uses\
    \ Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP, RFC 2858 [8]).  It exchanges\n   VPN routes as VPN-IPv4\
    \ addresses, the ASBR addresses as BGP next-hop\n   IPv4 addresses, and labels\
    \ to be used in the data plane.\n   The data plane is separated through the use\
    \ of a single label,\n   representing a VRF or a subset thereof.  RFC 4364 [1]\
    \ states that an\n   ASBR should only accept packets with a label that it has\
    \ assigned to\n   this router.  This prevents the insertion of packets with unknown\n\
    \   labels, but it is possible for a service provider to use any label\n   that\
    \ the ASBR of the other provider has passed on.  This allows one\n   provider\
    \ to insert packets into any VPN of the other provider for\n   which it has a\
    \ label.\n   This solution also needs to consider the security on layer 2 at the\n\
    \   interconnection.  The RFC states that this type of interconnection\n   should\
    \ only be implemented on private interconnection points.  See\n   section 6 for\
    \ more details.\n   RFC 4364 [1] states that a trust relationship between the\
    \ two\n   connecting ASes must exist for this model to work securely.\n   Effectively,\
    \ all ASes interconnected in this way form a single zone\n   of trust.  The VPN\
    \ customer needs to trust all the service providers\n   involved in the provisioning\
    \ of his VPN on this architecture.\n   c) PEs exchange labeled VPN-IPv4 routes,\
    \ ASBRs only exchange\n   loopbacks of PEs with labels.\n   In this solution,\
    \ there are effectively two control connections\n   between ASes.  The route reflectors\
    \ (RRs) exchange the VPN-IPv4\n   routes via multihop eBGP.  The ASBRs only exchange\
    \ the labeled\n   addresses of those PE routers that hold VPN routes that are\
    \ shared\n   between those ASes.  This maintains scalability for the ASBRs, since\n\
    \   they do not need to know the VPN-IPv4 routes.\n   In this solution, the top\
    \ label specifies an LSP to an egress PE\n   router, and the second label specifies\
    \ a VPN connected to this egress\n   PE.  The security of the ASBR connection\
    \ has the same constraints as\n   in solution b): An ASBR should only accept packets\
    \ with top labels\n   that it has assigned to the other router, thus verifying\
    \ that the\n   packet is addressed to a valid PE router.  Any label, which was\n\
    \   assigned to the other ASBR, will be accepted.  It is impossible for\n   an\
    \ ASBR to distinguish between different egress PEs or between\n   different VPNs\
    \ on those PEs.  A malicious service provider of one AS\n   could introduce packets\
    \ into any VPN on a PE of the other AS; it only\n   needs a valid LSP on its ASBR\
    \ and PEs to the corresponding PE on the\n   other AS.  The VPN label can be statistically\
    \ guessed from the\n   theoretical label space, which allows unidirectional traffic\
    \ into a\n   VPN.\n   This means that such an ASBR-ASBR connection can only be\
    \ made with a\n   trusted party over a private interface, as described in b).\n\
    \   In addition, this solution exchanges labeled VPN-IPv4 addresses\n   between\
    \ route reflectors (RRs) via MP-eBGP.  The control plane itself\n   can be protected\
    \ via routing authentication (RFC 2385 [6]), which\n   ensures that the routing\
    \ information has been originated by the\n   expected RR and has not been modified\
    \ in transit.  The received VPN\n   information cannot be verified, as in the\
    \ previous case.  Thus, a\n   service provider can introduce bogus routes for\
    \ any shared VPN.  The\n   ASes need to trust each other to configure their respective\
    \ networks\n   correctly.  All ASes involved in this design form one trusted zone.\n\
    \   The customer needs to trust all service providers involved.\n   The difference\
    \ between case b) and case c) is that in b) the ASBRs\n   act as iBGP next-hops\
    \ for their AS; thus, each SP needs to know of\n   the other SP's core only the\
    \ addresses of the ASBRs.  In case c), the\n   SPs exchange the loopback addresses\
    \ of their PE routers; thus, each\n   SP reveals information to the other about\
    \ its PE routers, and these\n   routers must be accessible from the other AS.\
    \  As stated above,\n   accessibility does not necessarily mean insecurity, and\
    \ networks\n   should never rely on \"security through obscurity\".  This should\
    \ not\n   be an issue if the PE routers are appropriately secured.  However,\n\
    \   there is an increasing perception that network devices should\n   generally\
    \ not be accessible.\n   In addition, there are scalability considerations for\
    \ case c).  A\n   number of BGP peerings have to be made for the overall network\n\
    \   including all ASes linked this way.  SPs on both sides need to work\n   together\
    \ in defining a scalable architecture, probably with route\n   reflectors.\n \
    \  In summary, all of these Inter-AS solutions logically merge several\n   provider\
    \ networks.  For all cases of Inter-AS configuration, all ASes\n   form a single\
    \ zone of trust and service providers need to trust each\n   other.  For the VPN\
    \ customer, the security of the overall solution is\n   equal to the security\
    \ of traditional RFC 2547 [7] networks, but the\n   customer needs to trust all\
    \ service providers involved in the\n   provisioning of this Inter-AS solution.\n"

    \ or inadvertent misconfiguration may result in severe\n   security leaks.\n \
    \  Note that this paragraph specifically refers to the core network,\n   i.e.,\
    \ the PE and P elements.  Misconfigurations of any of the\n   customer side elements\
    \ such as the CE router are covered by the\n   security mechanisms above.  This\
    \ means that a potential attacker must\n   have access to either PE or P routers\

    \ core elements, or is\n   able to insert into the core additional equipment,\
    \ he will be able to\n   attack both the core network and the connected VPNs.\
    \  Thus, the\n   following is important:\n   o  To avoid the risk of misconfigurations,\

    \      Proper tools are required to configure the core network.\n   o  To minimise\
    \ the risk of \"internal\" attacks, the core network must\n      be properly secured.\
    \  This includes network element security,\n      management security, physical\
    \ security of the service provider\n      infrastructure, access control to service\
    \ provider installations,\n      and other standard SP security mechanisms.\n\
    \   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs can only provide a secure service if the core\n   network\
    \ is provided in a secure fashion.  This document assumes this\n   to be the case.\n\
    \   There are various approaches to control the security of a core if the\n  \

    \ scheme using tokens, aimed at detecting\n   misconfigurations in the MPLS core.\
    \  The document \"MPLS VPN\n   Import/Export Verification\" [12] proposes a similar\

- title: 6.  Layer 2 Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Layer 2 Security Considerations\n   In most cases of Inter-AS or Carrier's\
    \ Carrier solutions, a network\n   will be interconnected to other networks via\
    \ a point-to-point private\n   connection.  This connection cannot be interfered\
    \ with by third\n   parties.  It is important to understand that the use of any\n\
    \   shared-medium layer 2 technology for such interconnections, such as\n   Ethernet\
    \ switches, may carry additional security risks.\n   There are two types of risks\
    \ with layer 2 infrastructure:\n   a) Attacks against layer 2 protocols or mechanisms\n\
    \   Risks in a layer 2 environment include many different forms of\n   Address\
    \ Resolution Protocol (ARP) attacks, VLAN trunking attacks, or\n   Content Addressable\
    \ Memory (CAM) overflow attacks.  For example, ARP\n   spoofing allows an attacker\
    \ to redirect traffic between two routers\n   through his device, gaining access\
    \ to all packets between those two\n   routers.\n   These attacks can be prevented\
    \ by appropriate security measures, but\n   often these security concerns are\
    \ overlooked.  It is of the utmost\n   importance that if a shared medium (such\
    \ as a switch) is used in the\n   above scenarios, that all available layer 2\
    \ security mechanisms are\n   used to prevent layer 2 based attacks.\n   b) Traffic\
    \ insertion attacks\n   Where many routers share a common layer 2 network (for\
    \ example, at an\n   Internet exchange point), it is possible for a third party\
    \ to\n   introduce packets into a network.  This has been abused in the past\n\
    \   on traditional exchange points when some service providers have\n   defaulted\
    \ to another provider on this exchange point.  In effect,\n   they are sending\
    \ all their traffic into the other SP's network even\n   though the control plane\
    \ (routing) might not allow that.\n   For this reason, routers on exchange points\
    \ (or other shared layer 2\n   connections) should only accept non-labeled IP\
    \ packets into the\n   global routing table.  Any labeled packet must be discarded.\
    \  This\n   maintains the security of connected networks.\n   Some of the above\
    \ designs require the exchange of labeled packets.\n   This would make it possible\
    \ for a third party to introduce labeled\n   packets, which if correctly crafted\
    \ might be associated with certain\n   VPNs on an BGP/MPLS IP VPN network, effectively\
    \ introducing false\n   packets into a VPN.\n   The current recommendation is\

  - "7.  Summary and Conclusions\n   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs provide full address and traffic\
    \ separation as in\n   traditional layer-2 VPN services.  It hides addressing\
    \ structures of\n   the core and other VPNs, and it is not possible to intrude\
    \ into other\n   VPNs abusing the BGP/MPLS mechanisms.  It is also impossible\
    \ to\n   intrude into the MPLS core if this is properly secured.  However,\n \
    \  there is a significant difference between BGP/MPLS-based IP VPNs and,\n   for\
    \ example, FR- or ATM-based VPNs: The control structure of the core\n   is layer\
    \ 3 in the case of MPLS.  This caused significant skepticism\n   in the industry\
    \ towards MPLS, since this might open the architecture\n   to DoS attacks from\
    \ other VPNs or the Internet (if connected).\n   As shown in this document, it\
    \ is possible to secure a BGP/MPLS IP VPN\n   infrastructure to the same level\
    \ of security as a comparable ATM or\n   FR service.  It is also possible to offer\
    \ Internet connectivity to\n   MPLS VPNs in a secure manner, and to interconnect\
    \ different VPNs via\n   firewalls.  Although ATM and FR services have a strong\
    \ reputation\n   with regard to security, it has been shown that also in these\n\
    \   networks security problems can exist [14].\n   As far as attacks from within\
    \ the MPLS core are concerned, all VPN\n   classes (BGP/MPLS, FR, ATM) have the\
    \ same problem: If an attacker can\n   install a sniffer, he can read information\
    \ in all VPNs, and if the\n   attacker has access to the core devices, he can\
    \ execute a large\n   number of attacks, from packet spoofing to introducing new\
    \ peer\n   routers.  There are a number of precautionary measures outlined above\n\
    \   that a service provider can use to tighten security of the core, but\n   the\
    \ security of the BGP/MPLS IP VPN architecture depends on the\n   security of\
    \ the service provider.  If the service provider is not\n   trusted, the only\
    \ way to fully secure a VPN against attacks from the\n   \"inside\" of the VPN\
    \ service is to run IPsec on top, from the CE\n   devices or beyond.\n   This\
    \ document discussed many aspects of BGP/MPLS IP VPN security.  It\n   has to\
    \ be noted that the overall security of this architecture\n   depends on all components\
    \ and is determined by the security of the\n   weakest part of the solution. \
    \ For example, a perfectly secured\n   static BGP/MPLS IP VPN network with secured\
    \ Internet access and\n   secure management is still open to many attacks if there\
    \ is a weak\n   remote access solution in place.\n"
