- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The intended audience for this document are mainly data managers\n\
    \   using X.500 Directory Services. With the help of these guidelines it\n   should\
    \ be easier for them to define the structure for the part of the\n   Directory\
    \ Information Tree they want to model, e.g., the\n   representation of their organisation\
    \ in the Directory. In addition,\n   decisions like which data elements to store\
    \ for each kind of entry\n   shall be supported.\n   These guidelines concentrate\
    \ mainly on the White Pages use of the\n   Directory, the X.500 application with\
    \ most operational experience\n   today, nonetheless many recommendations are\
    \ also valid for other\n   applications of the Directory.\n   As a pre-requisite\
    \ to this document, it is assumed that the COSINE\n   and Internet X.500 Schema\
    \ is followed [1].\n"
- title: 2. DIT Structure
  contents:
  - "2. DIT Structure\n   The majority of this document is concerned with DIT structure,\
    \ naming\n   and the usage of attributes for organisations, organisational units\n\
    \   and personal entries.\n   This section briefly notes five other key issues.\n"
- title: 2.1 Structure Rules
  contents:
  - "2.1 Structure Rules\n   A DIT structure is suggested in Annex B of X.521 [2],\
    \ and it is\n   recommended that Directory Pilots for White Pages services should\n\
    \   follow these guidelines. Some simple restrictions should be applied,\n   as\
    \ described below. For further usage of the Directory like e-mail\n   routing\
    \ with the Directory or storage of network information in the\n   Directory it\
    \ will be necessary to follow the guidelines specified in\n   the respective documents.\n\
    \   One of the few exceptions to the basic DIT structure is, that\n   international\
    \ organisations will be stored immediately under the root\n   of the tree. Multi-national\
    \ organisations will be stored within the\n   framework outlined, but with some\
    \ use of aliases and attributes such\n   as seeAlso to help bind together the\
    \ constituent parts of these\n   organisations. This is discussed in more detail\
    \ in section 2.5.\n   A general rule for the depth of a subtree is as follows:\
    \ When a\n   subtree is mainly accessed via searching, it should be as flat as\n\
    \   possible to improve the performance, when the access will be mainly\n   through\
    \ read operations, the depth of the subtree is not a\n   significant parameter\
    \ for performance.\n"
- title: 2.2 The Top Level of the DIT
  contents:
  - "2.2 The Top Level of the DIT\n   The following information will be present at\
    \ the top level of the\n   DIT:\n   Participating Countries\n      According to\
    \ the standard the RDN is the ISO 3166 country code. In\n      addition, the entries\
    \ should contain suitable values of the\n      friendlyCountryName attribute specified\
    \ in RFC 1274. Use of this\n      attribute is described in more detail in section\
    \ 4.4.4.\n   International Organisations\n      An international organisation\
    \ is an organisation, such as the\n      United Nations, which inherently has\
    \ a brief and scope covering\n      many nations.  Such organisations might be\
    \ considered to be\n      supra-national and this, indeed, is the raison-d'etre\
    \ of such\n      organisations. Such organisations will almost all be governmental\n\
    \      or quasi-governmental. A multi-national organisation is an\n      organisation\
    \ which operates in more than one country, but is not\n      supra-national. This\
    \ classification includes the large commercial\n      organisations whose production\
    \ and sales are spread throughout a\n      large number of countries.\n      International\
    \ organisations may be registered at the top level.\n      This will not be done\
    \ for multi-national organisations. Currently\n      three organisations are registered\
    \ so far: Inmarsat, Internet and\n      North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\
    \   Localities\n      A few localities will be registered under the root. The\
    \ chief\n      purpose of these locality entries is to provide a \"natural\" parent\n\
    \      node for organisations which are supra-national, and yet which do\n   \
    \   not have global authority in their particular field. Such\n      organisations\
    \ will usually be governmental or quasi-governmental.\n      Example localities\
    \ might include: Europe, Africa, West Indies.\n      Example organisations within\
    \ Europe might include: European Court\n      of Justice, European Space Agency,\
    \ European Commission.\n   DSA Information\n      Some information on DSAs may\
    \ be needed at the top level.  This\n      should be kept to a minimum.\n   The\
    \ only directory information for which there is a recognised top\n   level registration\
    \ authority is countries. Registration of other\n   information at the top level\
    \ may potentially cause problems. At this\n   stage, it is argued that the benefit\
    \ of limiting additional top level\n   registrations outweighs these problems.\
    \ However, this potential\n   problem should be noted by anyone making use of\
    \ such a registration.\n"
- title: 2.3 Countries
  contents:
  - "2.3 Countries\n   The national standardisation bodies will define national guidelines\n\
    \   for the structure of the national part of the DIT. In the interim,\n   the\
    \ following simple structure should suffice. The country entry will\n   appear\
    \ immediately beneath the root of the tree. Organisations which\n   have national\
    \ significance should have entries immediately beneath\n   their respective country\
    \ entries. Smaller organisations which are\n   only known in a particular locality\
    \ should be placed underneath\n   locality entries representing states or similar\
    \ geographical\n   divisions. Entry for private persons will be listed under the\n\
    \   locality entries. An example plan evolving for the US is the work of\n   the\
    \ North American Directory Forum [3]. Another example is the\n   organisation\
    \ of the X.500 namespace as standardized in Australia [4].\n"
- title: 2.4 Organisations
  contents:
  - "2.4 Organisations\n   Large organisations will probably need to be sub-divided\
    \ by\n   organisational units to help in the disambiguation of entries for\n \
    \  people with common names. Entries for people and roles will be stored\n   beneath\
    \ organisations or organisational units.\n   The organisation entry itself shall\
    \ contain the information necessary\n   to contact the organisation: for example,\
    \ postal address, telephone\n   and fax numbers.\n   Although the structure of\
    \ organisations often changes considerably\n   over time, the aim should be to\
    \ minimise the number of changes to the\n   DIT. Note that renaming a superior,\
    \ department entry has the effect\n   of changing the DN of all subordinate entries.\
    \ This has an\n   undesirable impact on the service for several reasons. Alias\
    \ entries\n   and certain attributes or ordinary entries such as seeAlso, secretary\n\
    \   and roleOccupant use DNs to maintain links with other entries. These\n   references\
    \ are one-way only and the Directory standard offers no\n   support to automatically\
    \ update all references to an entry once its\n   DN changes.\n"
- title: 2.4.1 Directory Manager, Postmaster & Secretary
  contents:
  - "2.4.1 Directory Manager, Postmaster & Secretary\n   Similar to messaging, where\
    \ every domain has its postmaster address\n   it is highly recommended that each\
    \ organisation in the X.500\n   Directory has two entries: Postmaster and Directory\
    \ Manager. In\n   addition, Secretary entries for an organisation and its units\
    \ should\n   be listed. If this guidance is followed, users will benefit because\n\
    \   it will be straightforward to find the right contacts for questions\n   or\
    \ problems with the service.\n   These entries should use the object class organizationalRole\
    \ with the\n   roleOccupant attributes containing the distinguished names of the\n\
    \   persons in charge of this role. The values\n      CN=Directory Manager\n \
    \     CN=Postmaster\n      CN=Secretary\n   should be added as additional values\
    \ whenever another language than\n   English is used for the name of the entries.\n"
- title: 2.4.2 Depth of tree
  contents:
  - "2.4.2 Depth of tree\n   The broad recommendation for White Pages is that the\
    \ DIT should be as\n   flat as possible. A flat tree means that Directory names\
    \ will be\n   relatively short, and probably somewhat similar in length and\n\
    \   component structure to paper mail addresses. A deep DIT would imply\n   long\
    \ Directory names, with somewhat arbitrary component parts, with a\n   result\
    \ which it is argued seems less natural. Any artificiality in\n   the choice of\
    \ names militates against successful querying.\n   A presumption behind this style\
    \ of naming is that most querying will\n   be supported by the user specifying\
    \ convenient strings of characters\n   which will be mapped onto powerful search\
    \ operations.  The\n   alternative approach of the user browsing their way down\
    \ the tree and\n   selecting names from large numbers of possibilities may be\
    \ more\n   appropriate in some cases, and a deeper tree facilitates this.\n  \
    \ However, these guidelines recommend a shallow tree, and implicitly a\n   search\
    \ oriented approach.\n   It may be considered that there are two determinants\
    \ of DIT depth:\n   first, how far down the DIT an organisation is placed; second,\
    \ the\n   structure of the DIT within organisations.\n   The structure of the\
    \ upper levels of the tree will be determined in\n   due course by various registration\
    \ authorities, and the pilot will\n   have to work within the given structure.\
    \ However, it is important\n   that the various pilots are cognisant of what the\
    \ structures are\n   likely to be, and move early to adopt these structures.\n\
    \   The other principal determinant of DIT depth is whether an\n   organisation\
    \ splits its entries over a number of organisational\n   units, and if so, the\
    \ number of levels. The recommendation here is\n   that this sub-division of organisations\
    \ is kept to a minimum. A\n   maximum of two levels of organisational unit should\
    \ suffice even for\n   large organisations. Organisations with only a few tens\
    \ or hundreds\n   of employees should strongly consider not using organisational\
    \ units\n   at all. It is noted that there may be some problems with choice of\n\
    \   unique RDNs when using a flat DIT structure. Multi-component RDNs can\n  \
    \ alleviate this problem: see section 3.1. The standard X.521\n   recommends that\
    \ an organizationalUnitName attribute can also be used\n   as a naming attribute\
    \ to disambiguate entries [2]. Further\n   disambiguation may be achieved by the\
    \ use of a personalTitle or\n   userId attribute in the RDN.\n"
- title: 2.4.3 Real World Organisational Structure
  contents:
  - "2.4.3 Real World Organisational Structure\n   Another aspect on designing the\
    \ DIT structure for an organisation is\n   the administrative structure within\
    \ a company. Using the same\n   structure in the DIT might help in distributing\
    \ maintenance authority\n   to the different units. Please note comments on the\
    \ stability of the\n   DIT structure in section 2.4.\n"
- title: 2.5 Multi-National Organisations
  contents:
  - "2.5 Multi-National Organisations\n   The standard says that only international\
    \ organisations may be placed\n   under the root of the DIT. This implies that\
    \ multi-national\n   organisations must be represented as a number of separate\
    \ entries\n   underneath country or locality entries. This structure makes it\
    \ more\n   awkward to use X.500 within a multi-national to provide an internal\n\
    \   organisational directory, as the data is now spread widely throughout\n  \
    \ the DIT, rather than all being grouped within a single sub-tree.\n   Many people\
    \ have expressed the view that this restriction is a severe\n   limitation of\
    \ X.500, and argue that the intentions of the standard\n   should be ignored in\
    \ this respect. This note argues, though, that the\n   standard should be followed.\n\
    \   No attempt to precisely define multinational organisation is essayed\n   here.\
    \ Instead, the observation is made that the term is applied to a\n   variety of\
    \ organisational structures, where an organisation operates\n   in more than one\
    \ country. This suggests that a variety of DIT\n   structures may be appropriate\
    \ to accommodate these different\n   organisational structures. This document\
    \ suggests three approaches,\n   and notes some of the characteristics associated\
    \ with each of these\n   approaches.\n   Before considering the approaches, it\
    \ is worth bearing in mind again\n   that a major aim in the choice of a DIT structure\
    \ is to facilitate\n   querying, and that approaches which militate against this\
    \ should be\n   avoided wherever possible.\n"
- title: 2.5.1 The Multi-National as a Single Entity
  contents:
  - "2.5.1 The Multi-National as a Single Entity\n   In many cases, a multi-national\
    \ organisation will operate with a\n   highly centralised structure. While the\
    \ organisation may have large\n   operations in a number of countries, the organisation\

    \ is desirable. Other considerations, such as accurately\n   reflecting the organisational\

    \ effect on normal querying. Early\n   experience in the pilot has shown that\

- title: 3.3 Naming Organisation and Organisational Unit Names
  contents:
  - "3.3 Naming Organisation and Organisational Unit Names\n   The naming of organisations\
    \ in the Directory will ultimately come\n   under the jurisdiction of official\
    \ naming authorities. In the\n   interim, it is recommended that pilots and organisations\
    \ follow these\n   guidelines. An organisation's RDN should usually be the full\
    \ name of\n   the organisation, rather than just a set of initials. This means\
    \ that\n   University College London should be preferred over UCL.  An example\n\
    \   of the problems which a short name might cause is given by the\n   proposed\
    \ registration of AA for the Automobile Association.  This\n   seems reasonable\
    \ at first glance, as the Automobile Association is\n   well known by this acronym.\
    \ However, it seems less reasonable in a\n   broader perspective when you consider\
    \ that organisations such as\n   Alcoholics Anonymous and American Airlines use\
    \ the same acronym.\n   Just as initials should usually be avoided for organisational\
    \ RDNs,\n   so should formal names which, for example, exist only on official\n\
    \   charters and are not generally well known. There are two reasons for\n   this\
    \ approach:\n      1.   The names should be meaningful.\n      2.   The names\
    \ should uniquely identify the organisation, and be\n           a name which is\
    \ unlikely to be challenged in an open\n           registration process. For example,\
    \ UCL might well be\n           challenged by United Carriers Ltd.\n   The same\
    \ arguments on naming style can be applied with even greater\n   force to the\
    \ choice of RDNs for organisational units. While\n   abbreviated names will be\
    \ in common parlance within an organisation,\n   they will almost always be meaningless\
    \ outside of that organisation.\n   While many people in academic computing habitually\
    \ refer to CS when\n   thinking of Computer Science, CS may be given several different\n\
    \   interpretations. It could equally be interpreted as Computing\n   Services,\
    \ Cognitive Science, Clinical Science or even Counselling\n   Services.\n   For\
    \ both organisations and organisational units, extra naming\n   information should\
    \ be stored in the directory as alternative values\n   of the naming attribute.\
    \ Thus, for University College London, UCL\n   should be stored as an alternative\
    \ organizationName attribute value.\n   Similarly CS could be stored as an alternative\
    \ organizationalUnitName\n   value for Computer Science and any of the other departments\
    \ cited\n   earlier. In general, entries will be located by searching, and so\
    \ it\n   is not essential to have RDNs which are either the most memorable or\n\
    \   guessable, although names should be recognisable. The need for users\n   not\
    \ to type long names may be achieved by use of carefully selected\n   alternative\
    \ values.\n"
- title: 3.4 Naming Human Users
  contents:
  - "3.4 Naming Human Users\n   A reasonably consistent approach to naming people\
    \ is particularly\n   critical as a large percentage of directory usage will be\
    \ looking up\n   information about people. User interfaces will be better able\
    \ to\n   assist users if entries have names conforming to a common format, or\n\
    \   small group of formats. It is suggested that the RDN should follow\n   such\
    \ a format. Alternative values of the common name attribute should\n   be used\
    \ to store extra naming information. It seems sensible to try\n   to ensure that\
    \ the RDN commonName value is genuinely the most common\n   name for a person\
    \ as it is likely that user interfaces may choose to\n   place greater weight\
    \ on matches on the RDN than on matches on one of\n   the alternative names.\n\
    \   The choice of RDN for humans will be influenced by cultural\n   considerations.\
    \ In many countries the best choice will be of the form\n   familiar-first-name\
    \ surname. Thus, Steve Kille is preferred as the\n   RDN choice for one of this\
    \ document's co-authors, while Stephen E.\n   Kille is stored as an alternative\
    \ commonName value. Pragmatic choices\n   will have to be made for other cultures.\
    \ The common name attribute\n   should not be used to hold other attribute information\
    \ such as\n   telephone numbers, room numbers, or local codes. Such information\n\
    \   should be stored within the appropriate attributes as defined in the\n   COSINE\
    \ and Internet X.500 Schema. Section 3.1 on multi-component RDNs\n   shows how\
    \ clashing names can be made unique.\n   The choice of a naming strategy should\
    \ not be made on the basis of\n   the possibilities of the currently available\
    \ user interface\n   implementations. For example, it is inappropriate to use\
    \ common names\n   of the form 'surname firstname' merely because a user interface\n\
    \   presents results in a more satisfactory order by so doing. Use the\n   best\

    \ uses a u-law encoded sound file as used by the\n      \"play\" utility on a\
    \ Sun 4. According to RFC 1274 it is an interim\n      format. It may be useful\

    \   description [X.520]\n      A short informal explanation of special interests\
    \ of a person or\n      organisation. Overlap with businessCategory, organizationalStatus\n\

    \ included as additional\n      values to help foreign users.\n   jpegPhoto [RFC\
    \ 1488] [8]\n      A colour or grayscale picture encoded according to JPEG File\n\
    \      Interchange Format (JFIF). Thanks to compression the size of the\n    \
    \  pictures is moderate. For persons it may show a portrait, for\n      organisations\
    \ the company logo or a map on how to get there.\n   photo [RFC 1274]\n      The\
    \ photo attribute is a b/w G3 fax encoded picture of an object.\n      The size\
    \ of the photo should be in a sensible relation to the\n      informational value\

- title: 4.4.5 MHS Attributes
  contents:
  - "4.4.5 MHS Attributes\n   mhsORAddresses [X.411]\n      The attribute uses internally\
    \ an ASN.1 structure. The string\n      notation used for display purposes is\
    \ implementation dependent.\n      This attribute is especially useful for an\
    \ integrated X.400 user\n      agent since it gets the address in a directly usable\

    \ This attribute shall disappear once the majority of the\n      DUAs support\

    \ Distinguished Name of the alias should use an\n           attribute type normally\
    \ used for naming entries of the\n           object class of the main entry.\n\

    \   organisation may be an independent national organisation and also an\n   organisational\
    \ unit of a parent organisation. To achieve this, it is\n   important to allow\
    \ an entry to be of both object class organisation\n   and of object class organisational\
