- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The canonical link relation specifies the preferred IRI\
    \ from\n   resources with duplicative content.  Common implementations of the\n\
    \   canonical link relation are to specify the preferred version of an\n   IRI\
    \ from duplicate pages created with the addition of IRI parameters\n   (e.g.,\
    \ session IDs) or to specify the single-page version as\n   preferred over the\
    \ same content separated on multiple component\n   pages.\n   In regard to the\
    \ link relation type, \"canonical\" can be described\n   informally as the author's\
    \ preferred version of a resource.  More\n   formally, the canonical link relation\
    \ specifies the preferred IRI\n   from a set of resources that return the context\
    \ IRI's content in\n   duplicated form.  Once specified, applications such as\
    \ search engines\n   can focus processing on the canonical, and references to\
    \ the context\n   (referring) IRI can be updated to reference the target (canonical)\n\
    \   IRI.\n"

- title: 3.  The Canonical Link Relation
  contents:
  - "3.  The Canonical Link Relation\n   The target (canonical) IRI MUST identify\
    \ content that is either\n   duplicative or a superset of the content at the context\
    \ (referring)\n   IRI.  Authors who declare the canonical link relation ought\
    \ to\n   anticipate that applications such as search engines can:\n   o  Index\
    \ content only from the target IRI (i.e., content from the\n      context IRIs\
    \ will be likely disregarded as duplicative).\n   o  Consolidate IRI properties,\
    \ such as link popularity, to the target\n      IRI.\n   o  Display the target\
    \ IRI as the representative IRI.\n   The target (canonical) IRI MAY:\n   o  Specify\
    \ a relative IRI (see [RFC3986], Section 4.2).\n   o  Be self-referential (context\
    \ IRI identical to target IRI).\n   o  Exist on a different hostname or domain.\n\
    \   o  Have different scheme names, such as \"http\" to \"https\" or \"gopher\"\
    \n      to \"ftp\".\n   o  Be a superset of the content at the context IRI.\n\
    \      *  As an example, each component page (e.g., page-1.html, page-\n     \
    \    2.html) of a multi-page article MAY specify the \"view-all\"\n         version\
    \ (e.g., page-all.html), the superset of their content,\n         as the target\
    \ IRI.  This is because the content from each\n         component page is contained\
    \ within the view-all version.  Given\n         this implementation, applications\
    \ can mark page-1.html and\n         page-2.html as duplicates of page-all.html,\
    \ process content\n         only from page-all.html, and disregard the component\
    \ pages.\n         All references can then be made to the view-all version (page-\n\
    \         all.html, the target IRI), and no content will have been lost\n    \
    \     in this process.\n      *  Using the same example above, page-2.html SHOULD\
    \ NOT designate\n         page-1.html as the target (canonical) IRI because this\
    \ may\n         cause a loss of data.  When page-2.html designates page-1.html\n\
    \         as the canonical, only content from the target IRI, page-\n        \
    \ 1.html, will be processed. page-2.html may be marked as a\n         duplicate\
    \ of page-1.html and its content disregarded.\n   o  Be the source IRI of a temporary\
    \ redirect.  For HTTP, this refers\n      to status codes 302, 303, or 307 (Sections\
    \ 10.3.3, 10.3.4, and\n      10.3.8, respectively, of [RFC2616]).\n   To better\
    \ ensure that applications properly handle the canonical link\n   relation, administrators\
    \ ought to consider the following guidelines:\n   o  Specify only one canonical\
    \ link relation for a resource.  (It\n      would be confusing to consider/label/designate\
    \ more than one IRI\n      as authoritative.)\n   o  Avoid designating the target\
    \ (canonical) as:\n      *  The source IRI of a permanent redirect (for HTTP,\
    \ this refers\n         to 300 and 301 response codes, defined in Sections 10.3.1\
    \ and\n         10.3.2 of [RFC2616]).\n      *  An IRI that also specifies a canonical\
    \ link relation to an IRI\n         other than itself.\n      *  An IRI that returns\
    \ an error code, such as a 4xx response in\n         HTTP (Section 10.4 of [RFC2616]).\n\
    \      *  The first page of a multi-page article or multi-page listing of\n  \
    \       items (since the first page is not duplicative or a superset of\n    \
    \     the context IRI).  For example, page-2.html and page-3.html of\n       \
    \  an article SHOULD NOT specify page-1.html as the canonical.\n         This\
    \ may cause a loss of data from page-2.html and page-3.html\n         as they\
    \ will be marked duplicative of page-1.html with only\n         content from page-1.html\
    \ being processed.\n   When the canonical link relation is declared improperly,\
    \ such as\n   creating chained canonicals (i.e., target IRI specifies the source\n\
    \   IRI of a permanent redirect) or designating a target IRI that returns\n  \
    \ a 4xx response, applications can use their own heuristics when\n   processing\
    \ the resource.  For instance, an application can choose to\n   ignore any improper\
    \ canonical designation and continue to process the\n   remaining content on a\
    \ page.\n"
- title: 4.  Examples
  contents:
  - "4.  Examples\n   The following example illustrates:\n   o  Three IRIs that serve\
    \ duplicate content.\n   o  One IRI that is the canonical or \"preferred version\"\
    .\n   o  Two IRIs with additional query parameters, making them the non-\n   \
    \   preferred version of the content (duplicates).  The canonical link\n     \
    \ relation is therefore specified on these duplicates.\n   If the preferred version\
    \ of a IRI and its content exists at:\n   http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse\n\
    \   Then duplicate content IRIs such as:\n   http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse&category=bags\n\
    \   http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse&category=bags&sid=1234\n   may\
    \ designate the canonical link relation in HTML as specified in\n   [REC-html401-19991224]:\n\
    \   <link rel=\"canonical\"\n           href=\"http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse\"\
    >\n   or as a relative IRI:\n   <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"page.php?item=purse\"\
    >\n   or alternatively, in the HTTP header field as specified in Section 5\n \
    \  of [RFC5988]:\n   Link: <http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse>; rel=\"\
    canonical\"\n   This signals to applications, such as search engines, that these\
    \ are\n   duplicates of the target (canonical) IRI:\n   http://www.example.com/page.php?item=purse.\n\
    \   Applications may then select the canonical value as the display IRI\n   (such\
    \ as in search results), and additional IRI properties such as\n   indexing and\
    \ ranking signals can be transferred as well.\n"
- title: 5.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "5.  Recommendations\n   Before adding the canonical link relation, verification\
    \ of the\n   following is RECOMMENDED:\n   1.  The content of the context IRI\
    \ is duplicated within the content\n       of the target (canonical) IRI.\n  \
    \ 2.  For HTTP, permanent HTTP redirects (Section 10.3.2 of [RFC2616]),\n    \
    \   the traditional strong indicator that a IRI's content has been\n       permanently\
    \ moved, could not be implemented in place of the\n       canonical link relation.\n\
    \   3.  In the case where the target (canonical) IRI is a superset of\n      \
    \ content from the context IRI (i.e., the case where page-1.html\n       and page-2.html\
    \ designate page-all.html as the canonical), that\n       the user experience\
    \ is strongly taken into consideration, both in\n       regard to possible increased\
    \ load time and potential complexity\n       in navigation.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   When a site is compromised, the canonical link\
    \ relation can be\n   implemented with malicious intent to designate the attacker's\
    \ IRI as\n   the preferred version of the content.  While this technique is\n\
    \   largely unnoticeable to humans, automated programs may cluster the\n   compromised\
    \ resource as duplicative of the attacker's target IRI,\n   transferring properties\
    \ such as link popularity away from the\n   compromised resource to the attacker's\
    \ designated canonical.\n   (Naturally, even a site that is not compromised could\
    \ provide\n   inaccurate or misleading information about which URI is canonical.)\n"
