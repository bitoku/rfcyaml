This memo is in response to (and support of) one of the points raised by Bob Braden (RTB) of UCLA CCN in RFC #430, "COMMENTS ON FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL" (see   13299,), namely that raised in Section D., "Site  Dependent FTP Parameters".
The NIC has been confronted with similar problems (and tentatively decided upon similar solutions) in designing mechanisms which would enable a user to use FTP to retrieve from the NIC, in sequential form, a VIEW of some portion for an NLS tree structured file.
To be done without modification to FTP, this task requires the user to communicate information   a filename, a statement address, viewspecs, and the name of a conversion algorithm   to SRI ARC's server FTP process in a manner that is transparent to the user's user FTP process.
<parameters> is optional and, if present, is also passed to the program.
To store and retrieve NLS files in sequential form, we will require that <program> be 'NLS' and <parameters> be of the form.
[ T: <conversion algorithm> ]
[ S: <statement address> ]
[ V: <viewspecs> ] where each of the three items is optional, and any that appear are separated by commas.
