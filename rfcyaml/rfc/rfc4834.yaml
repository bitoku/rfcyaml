  - "1.  Introduction\n   Virtual Private Network (VPN) services satisfying the requirements\n\
    \   defined in [RFC4031] are now being offered by many service providers\n   throughout\
    \ the world.  VPN services are popular because customers\n   need not be aware\
    \ of the VPN technologies deployed in the provider\n   network.  They scale well\
    \ for the following reasons:\n   o  because P routers (Provider Routers) need\
    \ not be aware of VPN\n      service details\n   o  because the addition of a\
    \ new VPN member requires only limited\n      configuration effort\n   There is\
    \ also a growing need for support of IP multicast-based\n   services.  Efforts\
    \ to provide efficient IP multicast routing\n   protocols and multicast group\
    \ management have been made in\n   standardization bodies which has led, in particular,\
    \ to the\n   definition of Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) and Internet Group\n\
    \   Management Protocol (IGMP).\n   However, multicast traffic is not natively\
    \ supported within existing\n   L3 PPVPN solutions.  Deploying multicast over\
    \ an L3VPN today, with\n   only currently standardized solutions, requires designing\
    \ customized\n   solutions which will be inherently limited in terms of scalability,\n\
    \   operational efficiency, and bandwidth usage.\n   This document complements\
    \ the generic L3VPN requirements [RFC4031]\n   document, by specifying additional\
    \ requirements specific to the\n   deployment within PPVPNs of services based\
    \ on IP multicast.  It\n   clarifies the needs of both VPN clients and providers\
    \ and formulates\n   the problems that should be addressed by technical solutions\
    \ with the\n   key objective being to remain solution agnostic.  There is no intent\n\
    \   in this document to specify either solution-specific details or\n   application-specific\
    \ requirements.  Also, this document does NOT aim\n   at expressing multicast-related\
    \ requirements that are not specific to\n   L3 PPVPNs.\n   It is expected that\
    \ solutions that specify procedures and protocol\n   extensions for multicast\
    \ in L3 PPVPNs SHOULD satisfy these\n   requirements.\n"

  - "2.1.  Terminology\n   Although the reader is assumed to be familiar with the\
    \ terminology\n   defined in [RFC4031], [RFC4364], [RFC4601], and [RFC4607], the\n\
    \   following glossary of terms may be worthwhile.\n   We also propose here generic\
    \ terms for concepts that naturally appear\n   when multicast in VPNs is discussed.\n\
    \   ASM:\n      Any Source Multicast.  One of the two multicast service models,\
    \ in\n      which a terminal subscribes to a multicast group to receive data\n\
    \      sent to the group by any source.\n   Multicast-enabled VPN, multicast VPN,\
    \ or             mVPN:\n      A VPN that supports IP multicast capabilities, i.e.,\
    \ for which\n      some PE devices (if not all) are multicast-enabled and whose\
    \ core\n      architecture supports multicast VPN routing and forwarding.\n  \
    \ PPVPN:\n      Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Network.\n   PE, CE:\n  \
    \    \"Provider Edge\", \"Customer Edge\" (as defined in [RFC4026]).  As\n   \
    \   suggested in [RFC4026], we will use these notations to refer to\n      the\
    \ equipments/routers/devices themselves.  Thus, \"PE\" will refer\n      to the\
    \ router on the provider's edge, which faces the \"CE\", the\n      router on\
    \ the customer's edge.\n   VRF or VR:\n      By these terms, we refer to the entity\
    \ defined in a PE dedicated\n      to a specific VPN instance.  \"VRF\" refers\
    \ to \"VPN Routing and\n      Forwarding table\" as defined in [RFC4364], and\
    \ \"VR\" to \"Virtual\n      Router\" as defined in [VRs] terminology.\n   MDTunnel:\n\
    \      Multicast Distribution Tunnel.  The means by which the customer's\n   \
    \   multicast traffic will be transported across the SP network.  This\n     \
    \ is meant in a generic way: such tunnels can be either point-to-\n      point\
    \ or point-to-multipoint.  Although this definition may seem\n      to assume\
    \ that distribution tunnels are unidirectional, the\n      wording also encompasses\
    \ bidirectional tunnels.\n   S:\n      Denotes a multicast source.\n   G:\n  \
    \    Denotes a multicast group.\n   Multicast channel:\n      In the multicast\
    \ SSM model [RFC4607], a \"multicast channel\"\n      designates traffic from\
    \ a specific source S to a multicast group\n      G. Also denominated as \"(S,G)\"\
    .\n   SP:\n      Service provider.\n   SSM:\n      Source Specific Multicast.\
    \  One of the two multicast service\n      models, where a terminal subscribes\
    \ to a multicast group to\n      receive data sent to the group by a specific\
    \ source.\n   RP:\n      Rendezvous Point (Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse\
    \ Mode\n      (PIM-SM) [RFC4601]).\n   P2MP, MP2MP:\n      Designate \"Point-to-Multipoint\"\
    \ and \"Multipoint-to-Multipoint\"\n      replication trees.\n   L3VPN, VPN:\n\
    \      Throughout this document, \"L3VPN\" or even just \"VPN\" will refer to\n\
    \      \"Provider-Provisioned Layer 3 Virtual Private Network\" (PP\n      L3VPNs),\
    \ and will be preferred for readability.\n   Please refer to [RFC4026] for details\
    \ about terminology specifically\n   relevant to VPN aspects, and to [RFC2432]\
    \ for multicast performance\n   or quality of service (QoS)-related terms.\n"

  - '3.  Problem Statement

    '
- title: 3.1.  Motivations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Motivations\n   More and more L3VPN customers use IP multicast services\
    \ within their\n   private infrastructures.  Naturally, they want to extend these\n\
    \   multicast services to remote sites that are connected via a VPN.\n   For instance,\
    \ the customer could be a national TV channel with\n   several geographical locations\
    \ that wants to broadcast a TV program\n   from a central point to several regional\
    \ locations within its VPN.\n   A solution to support multicast traffic could\
    \ consist of point-to-\n   point tunnels across the provider network and requires\
    \ the PEs\n   (Provider Edge routers) to replicate traffic.  This would obviously\n\
    \   be sub-optimal as it would place the replication burden on the PE and\n  \
    \ hence would have very poor scaling characteristics.  It would also\n   probably\
    \ waste bandwidth and control plane resources in the\n   provider's network.\n\
    \   Thus, to provide multicast services for L3VPN networks in an\n   efficient\
    \ manner (that is, with a scalable impact on signaling and\n   protocol state\
    \ as well as bandwidth usage), in a large-scale\n   environment, new mechanisms\
    \ are required to enhance existing L3VPN\n   solutions for proper support of multicast-based\
    \ services.\n"
- title: 3.2.  General Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.2.  General Requirements\n   This document sets out requirements for L3 provider-provisioned\
    \ VPN\n   solutions designed to carry customers' multicast traffic.  The main\n\
    \   requirement is that a solution SHOULD first satisfy the requirements\n   documented\
    \ in [RFC4031]: as far as possible, a multicast service\n   should have the same\
    \ characteristics as the unicast equivalent,\n   including the same simplicity\
    \ (technology unaware), the same quality\n   of service (if any), the same management\
    \ (e.g., performance\n   monitoring), etc.\n   Moreover, it also has to be clear\
    \ that a multicast VPN solution MUST\n   interoperate seamlessly with current\
    \ unicast VPN solutions.  It would\n   also make sense that multicast VPN solutions\
    \ define themselves as\n   extensions to existing L3 provider-provisioned VPN\
    \ solutions (such as\n   for instance, [RFC4364] or [VRs]) and retain consistency\
    \ with those,\n   although this is not a core requirement.\n   The requirements\
    \ in this document are equally applicable to IPv4 and\n   IPv6, for both customer-\
    \ and provider-related matters.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Scaling vs. Optimizing Resource Utilization
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Scaling vs. Optimizing Resource Utilization\n   When transporting multicast\
    \ VPN traffic over a service provider\n   network, there intrinsically is tension\
    \ between scalability and\n   resource optimization, since the latter is likely\
    \ to require the\n   maintenance of control plane states related to replication\
    \ trees in\n   the core network [RFC3353].\n   Consequently, any deployment will\
    \ require a trade-off to be made.\n   This document will express some requirements\
    \ related to this trade-\n   off.\n"
- title: 4.  Use Cases
  contents:
  - "4.  Use Cases\n   The goal of this section is to highlight how different applications\n\
    \   and network contexts may have a different impact on how a multicast\n   VPN\
    \ solution is designed, deployed, and tuned.  For this purpose, we\n   describe\
    \ some typical use case scenarios and express expectations in\n   terms of deployment\
    \ orders of magnitude.\n   Most of the content of these sections originates from\
    \ a survey done\n   in summer 2005, among institutions and providers that expect\
    \ to\n   deploy such solutions.  The full survey text and raw results (13\n  \
    \ responses) were published separately, and we only present here the\n   most\
    \ relevant facts and expectations that the survey exposed.\n   For scalability\
    \ figures, we considered that it was relevant to\n   highlight the highest expectations,\
    \ those that are expected to have\n   the greatest impact on solution design.\
    \  For balance, we do also\n   mention cases where such high expectations were\

    \ a multicast VPN.\n   Hence, we only give here a short list of scenarios that\
    \ are expected\n   to have a large impact on the design of a multicast VPN solution.\n"

    \ the relatively high number of streams that\n   they can produce, which has a\
    \ direct impact on scalability\n   expectations.\n   A sub-case of this scenario\

- title: 4.1.4.  Generic Multicast VPN Offer
  contents:
  - "4.1.4.  Generic Multicast VPN Offer\n   This ISP scenario is a deployment scenario\
    \ where IP-multicast\n   connectivity is proposed for every VPN: if a customer\
    \ requests a VPN,\n   then this VPN will support IP multicast by default.  In\
    \ this case,\n   the number of multicast VPNs equals the number of VPNs.  This\
    \ implies\n   a quite important scalability requirement (e.g., hundreds of PEs,\n\
    \   hundreds of VPNs per PE, with a potential increase by one order of\n   magnitude\
    \ in the future).\n   The per-mVPN traffic behavior is not predictable because\
    \ how the\n   service is used is completely up to the customer.  This results\
    \ in a\n   traffic mix of the scenarios mentioned in Section 4.1.  QoS\n   requirements\
    \ are similar to typical unicast scenarios, with the need\n   for different classes.\
    \  Also, in such a context, a reasonably large\n   range of protocols should be\
    \ made available to the customer for use\n   at the PE-CE level.\n   Also, in\

    \ two or more multicast VPNs as well as access to\n   Internet Multicast.\n"

- title: 5.1.3.  Quality of Service (QoS)
  contents:
  - "5.1.3.  Quality of Service (QoS)\n   Firstly, general considerations regarding\
    \ QoS in L3VPNs expressed in\n   Section 5.5 of [RFC4031] are also relevant to\
    \ this section.\n   QoS is measured in terms of delay, jitter, packet loss, and\n\
    \   availability.  These metrics are already defined for the current\n   unicast\
    \ PPVPN services and are included in Service Level Agreements\n   (SLAs).  In\
    \ some cases, the agreed SLA may be different between\n   unicast and multicast,\
    \ and that will require differentiation\n   mechanisms in order to monitor both\
    \ SLAs.\n   The level of availability for the multicast service SHOULD be on par\n\
    \   with what exists for unicast traffic.  For instance, comparable\n   traffic\
    \ protection mechanisms SHOULD be available for customer\n   multicast traffic\
    \ when it is carried over the service provider's\n   network.\n   A multicast\
    \ VPN solution SHALL allow a service provider to define at\n   least the same\
    \ level of quality of service as exists for unicast, and\n   as exists for multicast\
    \ in a non-VPN context.  From this perspective,\n   the deployment of multicast-based\
    \ services within an L3VPN\n   environment SHALL benefit from Diffserv [RFC2475]\
    \ mechanisms that\n   include multicast traffic identification, classification,\
    \ and marking\n   capabilities, as well as multicast traffic policing, scheduling,\
    \ and\n   conditioning capabilities.  Such capabilities MUST therefore be\n  \
    \ supported by any participating device in the establishment and the\n   maintenance\
    \ of the multicast distribution tunnel within the VPN.\n   As multicast is often\
    \ used to deliver high-quality services such as\n   TV broadcast, a multicast\
    \ VPN solution MAY provide additional\n   features to support high QoS such as\
    \ bandwidth reservation and\n   admission control.\n   Also, considering that\
    \ multicast reception is receiver-triggered,\n   group join delay (as defined\
    \ in [RFC2432]) is also considered one\n   important QoS parameter.  It is thus\
    \ RECOMMENDED that a multicast VPN\n   solution be designed appropriately in this\
    \ regard.\n   The group leave delay (as defined in [RFC2432]) may also be important\n\
    \   on the CE-PE link for some usage scenarios: in cases where the\n   typical\
    \ bandwidth of multicast streams is close to the bandwidth of a\n   PE-CE link,\
    \ it will be important to have the ability to stop the\n   emission of a stream\
    \ on the PE-CE link as soon as it stops being\n   requested by the CE, to allow\
    \ for fast switching between two\n   different high-throughput multicast streams.\
    \  This implies that it\n   SHOULD be possible to tune the multicast routing or\
    \ group management\n   protocols (e.g., IGMP/MLD or PIM) used on the PE-CE adjacency\
    \ to\n   reduce the group leave delay to the minimum.\n   Lastly, a multicast\
    \ VPN solution SHOULD as much as possible ensure\n   that client multicast traffic\
    \ packets are neither lost nor\n   duplicated, even when changes occur in the\
    \ way a client multicast\n   data stream is carried over the provider network.\
    \  Packet loss issues\n   also have to be considered when a new source starts\
    \ to send traffic\n   to a group: any receiver interested in receiving such traffic\
    \ SHOULD\n   be serviced accordingly.\n"

    \ SLA-\n   related metrics SHOULD be available through means similar to the ones\n\
    \   already used for unicast-related monitoring, such as Simple Network\n   Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3411] or IPFIX [IPFIX-PROT].\n   Multicast-specific characteristics\

    \ delay, and group join/\n   leave delay (time to start/stop receiving a multicast\
    \ group's traffic\n   across the VPN, as defined in [RFC2432], Section 3).\n \
    \  The monitoring of multicast-specific parameters and statistics MUST\n   include\

    \ information includes the one-way packet\n   delay, the inter-packet delay variation,\
    \ etc.  See [MULTIMETRICS].\n   A generic discussion of SLAs is provided in [RFC3809].\n\
    \   Apart from statistics on multicast traffic, customers of a multicast\n   VPN\
    \ will need information concerning the status of their multicast\n   resource\
    \ usage (multicast routing states and bandwidth).  Indeed, as\n   mentioned in\
    \ Section 5.2.5, for scalability purposes, a service\n   provider may limit the\
    \ number (and/or throughput) of multicast\n   streams that are received/sent to/from\
    \ a client site.  In such a\n   case, a multicast VPN solution SHOULD allow customers\
    \ to find out\n   their current resource usage (multicast routing states and\n\
    \   throughput), and to receive some kind of feedback if their usage\n   exceeds\
    \ the agreed bounds.  Whether this issue will be better handled\n   at the protocol\
    \ level at the PE-CE interface or at the Service\n   Management Level interface\
    \ [RFC4176] is left for further discussion.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that any OAM\
    \ mechanism designed to trigger alarms\n   in relation to performance or resource\
    \ usage metrics integrate the\n   ability to limit the rate at which such alarms\
    \ are generated (e.g.,\n   some form of a hysteresis mechanism based on low/high\

    \  part of more than one VPN.\n   A multicast VPN solution MUST support such deployments.\n\
    \   For instance, it must be possible to configure a VRF so that an\n   enterprise\

  contents:
  - "5.2.2.  Scalability\n   Some currently standardized and deployed L3VPN solutions\
    \ have the\n   major advantage of being scalable in the core regarding the number\
    \ of\n   customers and the number of customer routes.  For instance, in the\n\
    \   [RFC4364] and Virtual Router [VRs] models, a P router sees a number\n   of\
    \ MPLS tunnels that is only linked to the number of PEs and not to\n   the number\
    \ of VPNs, or customer sites.\n   As far as possible, this independence in the\
    \ core, with respect to\n   the number of customers and to customer activity,\
    \ is recommended.\n   Yet, it is recognized that in our context scalability and\
    \ resource\n   usage optimality are competing goals, so this requirement may be\n\
    \   reduced to giving the possibility of bounding the quantity of states\n   that\
    \ the service provider needs to maintain in the core for\n   MDTunnels, with a\
    \ bound being independent of the multicast activity\n   of VPN customers.\n  \
    \ It is expected that multicast VPN solutions will use some kind of\n   point-to-multipoint\
    \ technology to efficiently carry multicast VPN\n   traffic, and because such\
    \ technologies require maintaining state\n   information, this will use resources\
    \ in the control plane of P and PE\n   routers (memory and processing, and possibly\
    \ address space).\n   Scalability is a key requirement for multicast VPN solutions.\n\
    \   Solutions MUST be designed to scale well with an increase in any of\n   the\
    \ following:\n   o  the number of PEs\n   o  the number of customer VPNs (total\
    \ and per PE)\n   o  the number of PEs and sites in any VPN\n   o  the number\
    \ of client multicast channels (groups or source-groups)\n   Please consult Section\
    \ 4.2 for typical orders of magnitude up to\n   which a multicast VPN solution\
    \ is expected to scale.\n   Scalability of both performance and operation MUST\
    \ be considered.\n   Key considerations SHOULD include:\n   o  the processing\
    \ resources required by the control plane\n      (neighborhood or session maintenance\
    \ messages, keep-alives,\n      timers, etc.)\n   o  the memory resources needed\
    \ for the control plane\n   o  the amount of protocol information transmitted\
    \ to manage a\n      multicast VPN (e.g., signaling throughput)\n   o  the amount\
    \ of control plane processing required on PE and P\n      routers to add or remove\
    \ a customer site (or a customer from a\n      multicast session)\n   o  the number\
    \ of multicast IP addresses used (if IP multicast in ASM\n      mode is proposed\
    \ as a multicast distribution tunnel)\n   o  other particular elements inherent\
    \ to each solution that impact\n      scalability (e.g., if a solution uses some\
    \ distribution tree\n      inside the core, topology of the tree and number of\
    \ leaf nodes may\n      be some of them)\n   It is expected that the applicability\
    \ of each solution will be\n   evaluated with regards to the aforementioned scalability\
    \ criteria.\n   These considerations naturally lead us to believe that proposed\n\
    \   solutions SHOULD offer the possibility of sharing such resources\n   between\
    \ different multicast streams (between different VPNs, between\n   different multicast\
    \ streams of the same or of different VPNs).  This\n   means, for instance, if\
    \ MDTunnels are trees, being able to share an\n   MDTunnel between several customers.\n\
    \   Those scalability issues are expected to be more significant on P\n   routers,\
    \ but a multicast VPN solution SHOULD address both P and PE\n   routers as far\
    \ as scalability is concerned.\n"

    \ it\n   addresses the resource optimization issue while taking into account\n\
    \   the fact that some trade-off has to be made.\n   Moreover, it seems that a\

    \ core MDTunnels whose\n      topology (PIM or P2MP LSP trees, etc.) precisely\

    \   advantageous in terms of bandwidth, but it is poor in terms of\n      state\
    \ management.\n   State optimization:  setting up MDTunnels that aggregate multiple\n\
    \      customer multicast streams (all or some of them, across different\n   \
    \   VPNs or not).  This will have better scalability properties, but\n      at\
    \ the expense of bandwidth since some MDTunnel leaves will very\n      likely\

    \ unicast L3 PPVPN solution,\n   consistency in the tunneling technology has to\
    \ be favored: such a\n   solution SHOULD allow the use of the same tunneling technology\
    \ for\n   multicast as for unicast.  Deployment consistency, ease of operation,\n\
