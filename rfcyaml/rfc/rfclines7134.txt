Abstract RFC 4412 defines the "Resource Priority Namespaces" and "Resource  Priority Priority values" registries.
The management policy of these registries is "Standards Action".
This document normatively updates RFC 4412 to change the management policy of these registries to "IETF Review".
Introduction [RFC4412] defines the "Resource Priority Namespaces" and "Resource  Priority Priority values" registries.
The management policy of these registries is "Standards Action" [RFC5226].
Experience suggests that a document that only defines a new namespace with its priorities, and does not create new protocol semantics, should not be a Standards  Track document.
Therefore, this document updates [RFC4412] to change the management policy of the registries to "IETF Review".
This document does not introduce any security considerations beyond those discussed in [RFC4412].
IANA Considerations IANA has changed the management policy of the "Resource Priority Namespaces" and "Resource Priority Priority values" registries to "IETF Review" [RFC5226].
