  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently
    consists of five major\n   components:\n   o     An overall architecture, described
    in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].\n   o     Mechanisms for describing and naming objects
    and events for the\n         purpose of management.  The first version of this
    Structure of\n         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described
    in\n         STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC\n
    \        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described\n         in
    STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and\n         STD 58, RFC
    2580 [RFC2580].\n   o     Message protocols for transferring management information.
    \ The\n         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n
    \        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of\n         the
    SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards\n         track protocol,
    is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901\n         [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].
    \ The third version of the\n         message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described
    in RFC 1906\n         [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].\n
    \  o     Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The\n         first
    set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n         described in
    STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of\n         protocol operations and
    associated PDU formats is described in\n         RFC 1905 [RFC1905].\n   o     A
    set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573\n         [RFC2573] and
    the view-based access control mechanism described\n         in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].\n
    \  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework\n   can
    be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
    information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects
    in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo
    specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to
    the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n   translations.  The resulting
    translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events
    are omitted because no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine
    readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions
    in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine\n
    \  readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"

  - "3. Overview\n   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON
    MIB\n   [RFC2819] and extended by the SMON MIB [RFC2613] by providing a\n   method
    of ordering the interfaces of a device according to the value\n   of a specific
    parameter that characterizes the interfaces.\n   The need for such a technique
    derives from the evolution of the\n   network devices - bridges, routers, etc.,
    into complex entities with\n   a large number of interfaces and with many parameters
    that need to be\n   monitored on each interface.  It is common for certain classes
    of\n   switching devices to contain hundred of ports, and for each port to\n   instrument
    and support tens of parameters - usually expressed as\n   counters - for each
    interface.  As a result, it becomes impossible\n   for applications that monitor
    these devices to provide a view that\n   would allow the user to understand easily
    what is the status of the\n   device, whether the behavior of a port or interface
    is in normal\n   boundaries or not, and which are the most congested or problematic\n
    \  interfaces of the device.\n   This document tries to answer this problem by
    proposing a method of\n   providing a sorted list of interfaces according to programmable\n
    \  criteria.  The result of applying this method will be a shorter list,\n   that
    includes the most significant interfaces sorted according to the\n   selected
    criteria.  One possible action that can be taken by a\n   network manager could
    be applying to this interface a copy port\n   operation to a destination port
    that has a dedicated monitoring\n   device (e.g., a network analyzer) connected
    to it.  A standard MIB\n   interface for performing this operation is described
    in [RFC2613].\n"
  title: 3. Overview
- contents:
  - "4. MIB Structure\n   This MIB contains one MIB group:\n      -  The interfaceTopNObjects\n
    \  The interfaceTopNObjects includes one capability object and two\n   tables:\n
    \     - The interfaceControlTable\n      - The interfaceTopNTable\n   The interfaceControlTable
    is an RMON-style control table, allowing\n   for the creation of interfaceTopN
    reports.  The parameters specific\n   for each report, like the duration of the
    report, the number of\n   reports, start time and the characteristics of the variables
    that are\n   sorted (absolute, 'deltas' or percentage of the total bandwidth)
    are\n   set in this table.  An optional operation that is controlled from\n   this
    table is the normalization of values of the variables, which\n   allows for sorting
    of variables on the interfaces, despite the basic\n   speed of the interfaces
    being different on different interfaces.\n"
  title: 4. MIB Structure
- contents:
  - "5. Evolution of the Document, Limitations and Future Work\n   The RMON MIB Working
    Group included in its Charter a MIB document\n   that would offer a solution to
    the problem of quickly determining the\n   most congested (highest utilized) physical
    ports and links in an\n   RMON-capable device with multiple interfaces.\n   An
    initial solution, proposed in the first version of this document\n   included
    a limited approach.  The objects whose values are used as\n   criteria for sorting
    are elements in tables indexed by an\n   InterfaceIndex type of object, as defined
    in [RFC2863].  This\n   approach simplifies the search algorithm and the result
    table, but\n   restricts the method to interface parameters.  A more generic '\n
    \  usrTopN' function was initially considered out of the scope of this\n   work.\n
    \  At the Working Group meeting in Adelaide in March 2000, it was\n   decided
    to try to define the more generic function of usrTopN.  Under\n   this approach,
    variables belonging to tables with any type of index\n   can be sorted, but at
    expense of extra processing and sanity checking\n   by the agent.\n   At the interim
    meeting of the RMON Working Group in San Francisco, in\n   May 2000, it was decided
    that the usrTopN solution would not be\n   continued in this phase of the work.
    \ One of the reasons is that it\n   is difficult to achieve a normalization factor
    for a generic\n   approach.  The group agreed it is not desirable to require the\n
    \  application to plug-in the scaling factor for every instance that\n   might
    be included in a TopN report.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n
    \  There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain\n   sensitive
    information. These are:\n      interfaceTopNDataSourceIndex\n      interfaceTopNValue\n
    \  It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and\n   possibly
    to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them\n   over the network
    via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features\n   for such a secure environment.\n
    \  SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself
    is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as
    to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects in this MIB.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementers consider
    the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,
    the use\n   of the User-based Security Model [RFC2274] and the View-based Access\n
    \  Control Model [RFC2275] is RECOMMENDED.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility
    to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is
    properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals\n
    \  (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete)
    them.\n"
