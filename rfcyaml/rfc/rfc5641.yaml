  - "1.  Introduction\n   Currently, the L2TPv3 Circuit Status AVP [RFC3931] is able
    to convey\n   the UP/DOWN status of an access circuit.  However, a finer\n   granularity
    is often useful to determine the direction of the fault,\n   as has been added
    for MPLS-based pseudowires and is used in the\n   pseudowire control protocol
    using the Label Distribution Protocol\n   (LDP); see Section 3.5 of [RFC4446]
    and Section 5.4.2 of [RFC4447].\n   Additionally, it is useful (in session-level
    redundancy scenarios) to\n   be able to indicate if a pseudowire is in a standby
    state, where it\n   is fully established by signaling and allows Operations,\n
    \  Administration, and Maintenance, but is not switching data.  Again,\n   such
    functionality is available for MPLS-based pseudowires using LDP,\n   see [PREF-FWD].\n
    \  This document provides extended circuit status bit values for L2TPv3\n   and
    adds them in a manner such that it is backwards compatible with\n   the current
    Circuit Status AVP.  These new bits are applicable to all\n   pseudowire types
    that use the Circuit Status AVP.\n"

  - "2.  L2TPv3 Extended Circuit Status Values\n   The Circuit Status AVP (ICRQ, ICRP,
    ICCN, OCRQ, OCRP, OCCN, SLI),\n   Attribute Type 71, indicates the initial status
    of, or a status\n   change in, the circuit to which the session is bound.\n   The
    Attribute Value field for this AVP, currently defined in\n   [RFC3931], has the
    following format:\n      0                   1\n      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    \    (A)  15  0x0001  Active\n     (N)  14  0x0002  New\n   As currently defined
    in [RFC3931] and replicated in [RFC4349],\n   [RFC4454], [RFC4591], and [RFC4719],
    the two bits have the following\n   meanings:\n   o  The A (Active) bit indicates
    whether the circuit is up/active/\n      ready (1) or down/inactive/not-ready
    (0).\n   o  The N (New) bit indicates whether the circuit status indication is\n
    \     for a new circuit (1) or an existing circuit (0).\n   This document updates
    the semantics of the A and N bits as follows\n   (see also Section 4):\n   The
    A (Active) bit indicates whether the local pseudowire endpoint\n   (including
    the local Attachment Circuit (AC) and local Packet\n   Switched Network (PSN)-facing
    pseudowire termination) has no faults\n   present and is up/active/ready (1) or
    has faults present and is down/\n   inactive/not-ready (0).\n   The N (New) bit
    indicates if the notification is for a new circuit\n   (1) or an existing circuit
    (0), and is provided to emulate Network-\n   Network Interface (NNI) signaling
    between Provider Edge (PE) routers,\n   e.g., Frame Relay NNI.  It MAY be used
    to convey that a circuit has\n   been re-provisioned or newly provisioned at the
    PE, which can already\n   be inferred from the L2TP control message type.  It
    is therefore\n   uncertain as to what use the receiving PE can make of this bit,\n
    \  although it MAY include logging.  This document deprecates this bit\n   as
    it is of little or no use, hence this bit SHOULD be ignored on\n   receipt and
    is OPTIONAL to set on sending.  For reference, see\n   Section 3.4 of [RFC4591],
    which does not specify any additional usage\n   beyond the setting of the N bit
    in the ICRQ, ICRP (and OCRQ, OCRP)\n   and the clearing of it in all other control
    messages.\n   This document also extends this bitmap of values to allow for finer\n
    \  granularity of local pseudowire (i.e., Attachment Circuit or PSN-\n   facing
    endpoint) status reporting.\n   The Attribute Value field for the Circuit Status
    AVP, including the\n   new values, has the following format:\n      0                   1\n

  - "3.  Circuit Status Usage and Clarifications\n   In implementations prior to this
    specification, bits 0-13 MUST be set\n   to zero (see Section 5.4.5 of [RFC3931]).
    \ This allows for legacy\n   implementations to interwork properly with new implementations.\n
    \  The following are clarifications regarding the usage of the Circuit\n   Status
    AVP bits as defined in this specification:\n   o  The (R), (T), (I), and (E) bits
    are collectively referred to as\n      \"fault status bits\".\n   o  [RFC3931]
    defined the (A) bit as pertaining to local access\n      circuit state only.  This
    document redefines it as meaning that\n      \"no faults are present on the local
    pseudowire endpoint.\"\n   o  If multiple faults occur, all the fault status bits
    corresponding\n      to each fault MUST be set (i.e., they MUST be bitwise ORed\n
    \     together).\n   o  The (A) bit MUST NOT be set until all fault status bits
    are\n      cleared.  This behavior allows an endpoint to be backwards\n      compatible
    with a remote endpoint that does not understand these\n      new status bits.\n
    \  o  If any of the fault status bits are set, then the (A) bit MUST be\n      cleared.
    \ That is, the fault status bits (R, T, I, E) are a more\n      granular definition
    of (A), such that ORing the bits provides an\n      inverted (A).\n   o  If (A)
    is clear and the fault status bits (R, T, I, E) are clear,\n      it means that
    there is no extended circuit status.  That is, the\n      circuit is down/inactive/not-ready
    (from the (A) bit), without a\n      more granular (extended) indication.\n   o
    \ The (S) bit can be set in conjunction with any other bit,\n      including (A).
    \ A pseudowire endpoint in Standby (S bit set) can\n      be up/active/ready (A
    bit set) or experiencing a fault (A bit\n      cleared and one or more of the
    fault status bits (R, T, I, E) set.\n   o  Leaving Standby mode is indicated by
    the clearing of the (S) bit.\n   o  The usage of the (N) bit has been deprecated.\n"

  - "4.  Updates to Existing RFCs\n   This document updates existing RFCs that define
    (either generically\n   or in the context of a specific set of PW Types) the Active
    and New\n   bits of the Circuit Status AVP.  The Active and New bits of the\n
    \  Circuit Status AVP are specified in Section 5.4.5 of [RFC3931].\n   Those definitions
    are adapted to specific Attachment Circuits and\n   replicated in Section 3.4
    of [RFC4349] (High-Level Data Link Control\n   Frames over L2TPv3), Section 8
    of [RFC4454] (Asynchronous Transfer\n   Mode over L2TPv3), Section 3.4 of [RFC4591]
    (Frame Relay over\n   L2TPv3), and Section 2.3.3 of [RFC4719] (Ethernet Frames
    over\n   L2TPv3).  This document updates the definitions in all five of these\n
    \  references to say:\n      The A (Active) bit indicates whether the local pseudowire
    endpoint\n      (including the local Attachment Circuit and local PSN-facing\n
    \     pseudowire termination) has no faults present and is up/active/\n      ready
    (1) or has faults present and is down/inactive/not-ready\n      (0).\n      The
    N (New) bit usage is deprecated; it SHOULD be ignored on\n      receipt and is
    OPTIONAL to set on sending.\n   This document also updates Section 2.2 (bullet
    c) of [RFC4719],\n   removing the following two sentences:\n      For ICRQ and
    ICRP, the Circuit Status AVP MUST indicate that the\n      circuit status is for
    a new circuit (refer to N bit in Section\n      2.3.3).\n      For ICCN and SLI
    (refer to Section 2.3.2), the Circuit Status AVP\n      MUST indicate that the
    circuit status is for an existing circuit\n      (refer to N bit in Section 2.3.3)
    and reflect the current status\n      of the link (refer to A bit in Section 2.3.3).\n
    \  And finally, this document updates Section 3.1 of [RFC4349], Section\n   3.1
    of [RFC4454], Section 3.1 of [RFC4591], and Section 2.2 of\n   [RFC4719] with
    the following paragraph addition:\n      The usage of the N bit in the Circuit
    Status AVP is deprecated.\n      Therefore, for ICRQ and ICRP, the Circuit Status
    AVP need not\n      indicate on sending (nor check on receipt) that the circuit
    status\n      is for a new circuit, and for ICCN and SLI, the Circuit Status AVP\n
    \     need not indicate on sending (nor check on receipt) that the\n      circuit
    status is for an existing circuit.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for the Circuit Status
    AVP are covered in the\n   base L2TPv3 specification (see Section 8 of [RFC3931]).
    \ No\n   additional security considerations exist with extending this\n   attribute.\n"

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   The Circuit Status Bits number space [IANA-l2tp]
    is managed by IANA\n   as per Section 10.7 of [RFC3931].  Five new bits (bits
    9 through 13)\n   and one updated bit (bit 14) have been assigned as follows:\n
    \  Circuit Status Bits - per [RFC3931]\n   -------------------\n   Bit  9 - S
    (Standby) bit\n   Bit 10 - E (Local PSN-facing PW (egress) Tx Fault) bit\n   Bit
    11 - I (Local PSN-facing PW (ingress) Rx Fault) bit\n   Bit 12 - T (Local AC (egress)
    Tx Fault) bit\n   Bit 13 - R (Local AC (ingress) Rx Fault) bit\n   Bit 14 - N
    (New) bit [use deprecated]\n"
