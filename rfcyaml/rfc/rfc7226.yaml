  - "1.  Introduction\n   There is often a need to provide large aggregates of bandwidth\
    \ that\n   are best provided using parallel links between routers or carrying\n\
    \   traffic over multiple MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  In core\n   networks,\
    \ there is often no alternative since the aggregate\n   capacities of core networks\
    \ today far exceed the capacity of a single\n   physical link or a single packet-processing\
    \ element.\n   The presence of parallel links, with each link potentially comprised\n\
    \   of multiple layers, has resulted in additional requirements.  Certain\n  \
    \ services may benefit from being restricted to a subset of the\n   component\
    \ links or a specific component link, where component link\n   characteristics,\
    \ such as latency, differ.  Certain services require\n   that an LSP be treated\
    \ as atomic and avoid reordering.  Other\n   services will continue to require\
    \ only that reordering not occur\n   within a flow as is current practice.\n \
    \  Numerous forms of multipath exist today, including MPLS Link Bundling\n   [RFC4201],\
    \ Ethernet Link Aggregation [IEEE-802.1AX], and various\n   forms of Equal Cost\
    \ Multipath (ECMP) such as for OSPF ECMP, IS-IS\n   ECMP, and BGP ECMP.  Refer\
    \ to the appendices in [USE-CASES] for a\n   description of existing techniques\
    \ and a set of references.\n   The purpose of this document is to clearly enumerate\
    \ a set of\n   requirements related to the protocols and mechanisms that provide\n\
    \   MPLS-based Advanced Multipath.  The intent is to first provide a set\n   of\
    \ functional requirements, in Section 3, that are as independent as\n   possible\
    \ of protocol specifications.  A set of general protocol\n   requirements are\
    \ defined in Section 4.  A set of network management\n   requirements are defined\
    \ in Section 5.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n   Any statement that requires the solution to support some new\n\
    \   functionality through use of [RFC2119] keywords should be interpreted\n  \
    \ as follows.  The implementation either MUST or SHOULD support the new\n   functionality,\
    \ depending on the use of either MUST or SHOULD in the\n   requirements statement.\
    \  The implementation SHOULD, in most or all\n   cases, allow any new functionality\
    \ to be individually enabled or\n   disabled through configuration.  A service\
    \ provider or other\n   deployment MAY enable or disable any feature in their\
    \ network,\n   subject to implementation limitations on sets of features that\
    \ can be\n   disabled.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions

  - "2.  Definitions\n   Multipath\n       The term \"multipath\" includes all techniques\
    \ in which:\n       1.  Traffic can take more than one path from one node to a\n\
    \           destination.\n       2.  Individual packets take one path only.  Packets\
    \ are not\n           subdivided and reassembled at the receiving end.\n     \
    \  3.  Packets are not resequenced at the receiving end.\n       4.  The paths\
    \ may be:\n           a.  parallel links between two nodes,\n           b.  specific\
    \ paths across a network to a destination node, or\n           c.  links or paths\
    \ to an intermediate node used to reach a\n               common destination.\n\
    \       The paths need not have equal capacity.  The paths may or may not\n  \
    \     have equal cost in a routing protocol.\n   Advanced Multipath\n       Advanced\
    \ Multipath is a formalization of multipath techniques\n       that meets the\
    \ requirements defined in this document.  A key\n       capability of Advanced\
    \ Multipath is the support of non-\n       homogeneous component links.\n   Advanced\
    \ Multipath Group (AMG)\n       An AMG is a collection of component links where\
    \ Advanced\n       Multipath techniques are applied.\n   Composite Link\n    \
    \   The term \"composite link\" had been a registered trademark of\n       Avici\
    \ Systems, but it was abandoned in 2007.  The term \"composite\n       link\"\
    \ is now defined by the ITU-T in [ITU-T.G.800].  The ITU-T\n       definition\
    \ includes multipath as defined here, plus inverse\n       multiplexing, which\
    \ is explicitly excluded from the definition of\n       multipath.\n   Inverse\
    \ Multiplexing\n       Inverse multiplexing is another method of sending traffic\
    \ over\n       multiple links.  Inverse multiplexing either transmits whole\n\
    \       packets and resequences the packets at the receiving end or\n       subdivides\
    \ packets and reassembles the packets at the receiving\n       end.  Inverse multiplexing\
    \ requires that all packets be handled\n       by a common egress packet processing\
    \ element and is, therefore,\n       not useful for very high-bandwidth applications.\n\
    \   Component Link\n       The ITU-T definition of composite link in [ITU-T.G.800]\
    \ and the\n       IETF definition of link bundling in [RFC4201] both refer to\
    \ an\n       individual link in the composite link or link bundle as a\n     \
    \  component link.  The term \"component link\" is applicable to all\n       forms\
    \ of multipath.  The IEEE uses the term \"member\" rather than\n       \"component\
    \ link\" in Ethernet Link Aggregation [IEEE-802.1AX].\n   Client Layer\n     \
    \  A client layer is the layer immediately above a server layer.\n   Server Layer\n\
    \       A server layer is the layer immediately below a client layer.\n   Higher\
    \ Layers\n       Relative to a particular layer, a client layer and any layer\n\
    \       above that is considered a higher layer.  Upper layer is\n       synonymous\
    \ with higher layer.\n   Lower Layers\n       Relative to a particular layer,\
    \ a server layer and any layer\n       below that is considered a lower layer.\n\
    \   Client LSP\n       A client LSP is an LSP that has been set up over one or\
    \ more\n       lower layers.  In the context of this discussion, one type of\n\
    \       client LSP is an LSP that has been set up over an AMG.\n   Flow\n    \
    \   A sequence of packets that should be transferred in order on one\n       component\
    \ link of a multipath.\n   Flow Identification\n       The label stack and other\
    \ information that uniquely identifies a\n       flow.  Other information in flow\
    \ identification may include an IP\n       header, pseudowire (PW) control word,\
    \ Ethernet Media Access\n       Control (MAC) address, etc.  Note that a client\
    \ LSP may contain\n       one or more flows, or a client LSP may be equivalent\
    \ to a flow.\n       Flow identification is used to locally select a component\
    \ link or\n       a path through the network toward the destination.\n   Load\
    \ Balance\n       Load split, load balance, or load distribution refers to\n \
    \      subdividing traffic over a set of component links such that load\n    \
    \   is fairly evenly distributed over the set of component links and\n       certain\
    \ packet ordering requirements are met.  Some existing\n       techniques better\
    \ achieve these objectives than others.\n   Performance Objective\n       Numerical\
    \ values for performance measures: principally\n       availability, latency,\
    \ and delay variation.  Performance\n       objectives may be related to Service\
    \ Level Agreements (SLAs) as\n       defined in [RFC2475] or may be strictly internal.\
    \  Performance\n       objectives may span links from edge to edge or from end\
    \ to end.\n       Performance objectives may span one provider or multiple\n \
    \      providers.\n   A component link may be a point-to-point physical link (where\
    \ a\n   \"physical link\" includes one or more link layers, plus a physical\n\
    \   layer) or a logical link that preserves ordering in the steady state.\n  \
    \ A component link may have transient out-of-order events, but such\n   events\
    \ must not exceed the network's performance objectives.  For\n   example, a component\
    \ link may be comprised of any supportable\n   combination of link layers over\
    \ a physical layer or over logical sub-\n   layers -- including those providing\
    \ physical-layer emulation -- or\n   over MPLS server-layer LSP.\n   The ingress\
    \ and egress of a multipath may be midpoint LSRs with\n   respect to a given client\
    \ LSP.  A midpoint LSR does not participate\n   in the signaling of any clients\
    \ of the client LSP.  Therefore, in\n   general, multipath endpoints cannot determine\
    \ requirements of clients\n   of a client LSP through participation in the signaling\
    \ of the clients\n   of the client LSP.\n   This document makes no statement on\
    \ whether Advanced Multipath is\n   itself a layer or whether an instance of AMG\
    \ is itself a layer.  This\n   is to avoid engaging in long and pointless discussions\
    \ about what\n   constitutes a proper layer.\n   The term \"Advanced Multipath\"\
    \ is intended to be used within the\n   context described in this document and\
    \ related documents, for\n   example, [USE-CASES] and [FRAMEWORK].  Other Advanced\
    \ Multipath\n   techniques may arise in the future.  If the capabilities defined\
    \ in\n   this document become commonplace, they would no longer be considered\n\
    \   \"advanced\".  Use of the term \"advanced multipath\" outside this\n   document,\
    \ if referring to the term as defined here, should indicate\n   Advanced Multipath\
    \ as defined by this document, citing the current\n   document name.  If using\
    \ another definition of \"advanced multipath\",\n   documents may optionally clarify\
    \ that they are not using the term\n   \"advanced multipath\" as defined by this\
    \ document if clarification is\n   deemed helpful.\n"

    \   are carried or in any other case where symmetric delay is highly\n   desirable.\
    \  There may be other uses of this capability.\n   Other client LSPs may only\
    \ require that the LSP serve the same set of\n   nodes in both directions.  This\

  - "3.5.  Multipath Load-Balancing Dynamics\n   Multipath load balancing attempts\
    \ to keep traffic levels on all\n   component links below congestion levels if\
    \ possible and preferably\n   well balanced.  Load balancing is minimally disruptive\
    \ (see the\n   discussion below this section's list of requirements).  The\n \
    \  sensitivity to these minimal disruptions of traffic flows within a\n   specific\
    \ client LSP needs to be considered.\n   FR#18 The solution SHALL provide a means\
    \ for the client layer to\n         indicate a requirement that a specific client\
    \ LSP MUST NOT be\n         split across multiple component links.\n   FR#19 The\
    \ solution SHALL provide a means local to a node that\n         automatically\
    \ distributes flows across the component links in\n         the AMG such that\
    \ performance objectives are met, as described\n         in the prior requirements\
    \ in Section 3.3.\n   FR#20 The solution SHALL measure traffic flows or groups\
    \ of traffic\n         flows and dynamically select the component link on which\
    \ to\n         place this traffic in order to balance the load so that no\n  \
    \       component link in the AMG between a pair of nodes is\n         overloaded.\n\
    \   FR#21 When a traffic flow is moved from one component link to another\n  \
    \       in the same AMG between a set of nodes, it MUST be done so in a\n    \
    \     minimally disruptive manner.\n   FR#22 Load balancing MAY be used during\
    \ sustained low-traffic periods\n         to reduce the number of active component\
    \ links for the purpose\n         of power reduction.\n   FR#23 The solution SHALL\
    \ provide a means for the client layer to\n         indicate a requirement that\
    \ a specific client LSP contains\n         traffic whose frequency of component\
    \ link change due to load\n         balancing needs to be bounded by a specific\
    \ value.  The\n         solution MUST provide a means to bound the frequency of\
    \ a\n         component link change due to load balancing for subsets of\n   \
    \      traffic flow on AMGs.\n   FR#24 The solution SHALL provide a means to distribute\
    \ traffic flows\n         from a single client LSP across multiple component links\
    \ to\n         handle at least the case where the traffic carried in a client\n\
    \         LSP exceeds that of any component link in the AMG.\n   FR#25 The solution\
    \ SHOULD support the use case where an AMG itself is\n         a component link\
    \ for a higher order AMG.  For example, an AMG\n         comprised of MPLS-TP\
    \ bidirectional tunnels viewed as logical\n         links could then be used as\
    \ a component link in yet another AMG\n         that connects MPLS routers.\n\
    \   FR#26 If the total demand offered by traffic flows exceeds the\n         capacity\
    \ of the AMG, the solution SHOULD define a means to\n         cause some client\
    \ LSPs to move to an alternate set of paths\n         that are not congested.\
    \  These \"preempted LSPs\" may not be\n         restored if there is no uncongested\
    \ path in the network.\n   A minimally disruptive change implies that as little\
    \ disruption as is\n   practical occurs.  Such a change can be achieved with zero\
    \ packet\n   loss.  A delay discontinuity may occur, which is considered to be\
    \ a\n   minimally disruptive event for most services if this type of event is\n\
    \   sufficiently rare.  A delay discontinuity is an example of a\n   minimally\
    \ disruptive behavior corresponding to current techniques.\n   A delay discontinuity\
    \ is an isolated event that may greatly exceed\n   the normal delay variation\
    \ (jitter).  A delay discontinuity has the\n   following effect.  When a flow\
    \ is moved from a current link to a\n   target link with lower latency, reordering\
    \ can occur.  When a flow is\n   moved from a current link to a target link with\
    \ a higher latency, a\n   time gap can occur.  Some flows (e.g., timing distribution\
    \ and PW\n   circuit emulation) are quite sensitive to these effects.  A delay\n\
    \   discontinuity can also cause a jitter buffer underrun or overrun,\n   affecting\
    \ user experience in real-time voice services (causing an\n   audible click).\
    \  These sensitivities may be specified in a\n   performance objective.\n   As\
    \ with any load-balancing change, a change initiated for the purpose\n   of power\
    \ reduction may be minimally disruptive.  Typically, the\n   disruption is limited\
    \ to a change in delay characteristics and the\n   potential for a very brief\
    \ period with traffic reordering.  When\n   configuring a network for power reduction,\
    \ the network operator\n   should weigh the benefit of power reduction against\
    \ the disadvantage\n   of a minimal disruption.\n"

  - "4.  General Requirements for Protocol Solutions\n   This section defines requirements\
    \ for protocol specifications used to\n   meet the functional requirements specified\
    \ in Section 3.\n   GR#1  The solution SHOULD extend existing protocols wherever\n\
    \         possible, developing a new protocol only where doing so adds a\n   \
    \      significant set of capabilities.\n   GR#2  A solution SHOULD extend LDP\
    \ capabilities to meet functional\n         requirements.  This MUST be accomplished\
    \ without defining LDP\n         Traffic Engineering (TE) methods as decided in\
    \ [RFC3468].\n   GR#3  Coexistence of LDP- and RSVP-TE-signaled LSPs MUST be supported\n\
    \         on an AMG.  Function requirements SHOULD, where possible, be\n     \
    \    accommodated in a manner that supports LDP-signaled LSP, RSVP-\n        \
    \ signaled LSP, and LSP setup using management plane mechanisms.\n   GR#4  When\
    \ the nodes connected via an AMG are in the same routing\n         domain, the\
    \ solution MAY define extensions to the IGP.\n   GR#5  When the nodes are connected\
    \ via an AMG are in different MPLS\n         network topologies, the solution\
    \ SHALL NOT rely on extensions\n         to the IGP.\n   GR#6  The solution SHOULD\
    \ support AMG IGP advertisement that results\n         in convergence time better\
    \ than that of advertising the\n         individual component links.  The solution\
    \ SHALL be designed so\n         that it represents the range of capabilities\
    \ of the individual\n         component links such that functional requirements\
    \ are met, and\n         it also minimizes the frequency of advertisement updates\
    \ that\n         may cause IGP convergence to occur.\n         Examples of advertisement-update-triggering\
    \ events to be\n         considered include: client LSP establishment/release,\
    \ changes\n         in component-link characteristics (e.g., latency and up/down\n\
    \         state), and/or bandwidth utilization.\n   GR#7  When a worst-case failure\
    \ scenario occurs, the number of\n         RSVP-TE client LSPs to be resignaled\
    \ will cause a period of\n         unavailability as perceived by users.  The\
    \ resignaling time of\n         the solution MUST support protocol mechanisms\
    \ meeting existing\n         provider performance objectives for the duration\
    \ of\n         unavailability without significantly relaxing those existing\n\
    \         performance objectives for the same network or for networks\n      \
    \   with similar topology.  For example, the processing load due to\n        \
    \ IGP readvertisement MUST NOT increase significantly, and the\n         resignaling\
    \ time of the solution MUST NOT increase\n         significantly as compared with\
    \ current methods.\n"
