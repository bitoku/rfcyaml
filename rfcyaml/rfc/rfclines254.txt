SCENARIOS FOR USING ARPANET COMPUTERS
This scenario booklet is provided to facilitate the use of ARPANET host computer systems via the ARPANET.
The objective of these scenarios is to aid a user in sampling host computers on the ARPANET, thereby stimulating this interest in using ARPANET.
The scenarios describe the login procedure, the use of some simple or interesting facilities, and obtaining on line help facilities such as on line documentation and interactive dialog with experienced users via "link" or "message" type mechanisms.
The use of TELNETS for "piggy back login" is included to help system programmers in debugging and testing their protocol implementations.
An exercise of editing and running a very simple program is also included, where appropriate.
The scenarios assume the environment of the MIT DMCG PDP 10 computer system, but are readily adaptable to use from other systems.
The annotated script is provided to assist you in the use of a particular host computer.
Comments are enclosed in parenthesis, and user input is underlined.
In the scripts, a carriage return is indicated by '<CR>', and a space by blank (i.e., no type).
Escape to local user TELNET is indicated by backslash, the default escape character in the MIT DMCG system.
Additional blank lines have been introduced in many instances to improve readability of the script.
The author wishes to acknowledge the help of Bob Bressler, Rich Guida, Bob Metcalfe, Jim Michener, and Neal Ryan in preparing this Scenarios booklet.
Your comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
Please direct all comments to Abhay Bhushan, Room 208, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, Mass 02139.

SEX treats network interaction as being half duplex and line at a  time, and assumes local echo.
Sex does not accept commands in lower case alphabetics (hit <BRK> on the MIT DMCG IMLAC if you are not in upper case mode.)

CCN also offers a Remote Job Service.
Their TELNET service is currently by arrangement only.
We have not used it yet.

SRI (NIC) PDP 10 TENEX Network address 2.
NIC is best used in character at a time mode with remote echo.
After connection is completed you should change your mode to full duplex at NIC (their default is half duplex).
NIC can also be used in half  duplex (with local echo), line at a time mode, but use is not as convenient.
Although NIC commands are similar to BBN TENEX, the NLS subsystem is different.

(The SRI (AI) computer uses the TENEX operating system, and is similar to the system at BBN.
We have not been able to log into SRI (AI) system as they are currently not functioning as a server.
Hence no scenario is provided.
This section will be updated as soon as SRI (AI) is able to accept login over the ARPANET.)

(The Utah computer uses the TENEX Operating System, and is similar to the system at BBN.
The password for Network users will be: THISISANINTENTIONALLYLONGPASSWORD
As yet, their logger is unavailable, and we have been unable to login on their system hence, no scenario script is provided.)
TENEX is best used in character at a time mode with remote echo.
However, as TENEX treats network users as half duplex by default, you should either change your mode to FULLDUPLEX, or escape into NETWRK and request local echo.
At command level TENEX does not distinguish between upper and lower case alphabetics.
The programs "DOCTOR" and "LIFE" may not be available to you in the BBN PDP 10(A) system, but can still be used from the BBN PDP 10(B) system.

The BBN PDP 10(B) is an experimental TENEX system similar to the BBN PDP 10(A) TENEX system (network address 69.).
Because of the similarities of the two TENEX systems, no scenario is given here.
Please refer to the BBN PDP 10(A) system (page12) for the scenario.
The account number to be used for the system is "1" instead of the "site name" used in the BBN PDP 10(A) system.
MIT H 645 MULTICS Network address 6.
Multics interacts line at a time and assumes local echo.
