  - "1.  Overview\n   The Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing\n
    \  protocol [RFC1195] [ISO10589] is a link state intra-domain routing\n   protocol.
    \ Normally, when an IS-IS router is restarted, temporary\n   disruption of routing
    occurs due to events in both the restarting\n   router and the neighbors of the
    restarting router.\n   The router that has been restarted computes its own routes
    before\n   achieving database synchronization with its neighbors.  The results\n
    \  of this computation are likely to be non-convergent with the routes\n   computed
    by other routers in the area/domain.\n   Neighbors of the restarting router detect
    the restart event and cycle\n   their adjacencies with the restarting router through
    the DOWN state.\n   The cycling of the adjacency state causes the neighbors to
    regenerate\n   their LSPs describing the adjacency concerned.  This in turn causes
    a\n   temporary disruption of routes passing through the restarting router.\n
    \  In certain scenarios, the temporary disruption of the routes is\n   highly
    undesirable.  This document describes mechanisms to avoid or\n   minimize the
    disruption due to both of these causes.\n   When an adjacency is reinitialized
    as a result of a neighbor\n   restarting, a router does three things:\n   1.  It
    causes its own LSP(s) to be regenerated, thus triggering\n       Shortest Path
    First (SPF) runs throughout the area (or in the\n       case of Level 2, throughout
    the domain).\n   2.  It sets SRMflags on its own LSP database on the adjacency\n
    \      concerned.\n   3.  In the case of a Point-to-Point link, it transmits a
    complete set\n       of Complete Sequence Number PDUs (CSNPs), over the adjacency.\n
    \  In the case of a restarting router process, the first of these is\n   highly
    undesirable, but the second is essential in order to ensure\n   synchronization
    of the LSP database.\n   The third action above minimizes the number of LSPs that
    must be\n   exchanged and, if made reliable, provides a means of determining when\n
    \  the LSP databases of the neighboring routers have been synchronized.\n   This
    is desirable whether or not the router is being restarted (so\n   that the overload
    bit can be cleared in the router's own LSP, for\n   example).\n   This document
    describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal\n   to its neighbors that
    it is restarting.  The mechanism further allows\n   the neighbors to reestablish
    their adjacencies with the restarting\n   router without cycling through the DOWN
    state while still correctly\n   initiating database synchronization.\n   This
    document additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting\n   router to determine
    when it has achieved LSP database synchronization\n   with its neighbors and a
    mechanism to optimize LSP database\n   synchronization and minimize transient
    routing disruption when a\n   router starts.\n   It is assumed that the three-way
    handshake [RFC5303] is being used on\n   Point-to-Point circuits.\n"

    in a router can be maintained\n   independently, it is possible for the forwarding
    function state to be\n   maintained across a resumption of control function operations.
    \ This\n   functionality is assumed when the terms \"restart/restarting\" are
    used\n   in this document.\n   The terms \"start/starting\" are used to refer
    to a router in which the\n   control function has either commenced operations
    for the first time\n   or has resumed operations, but the forwarding functions
    have not been\n   maintained in a prior state.\n   The terms \"(re)start/(re)starting\"
    are used when the text is\n   applicable to both a \"starting\" and a \"restarting\"
    router.\n   The terms \"normal IIH\" or \"IIH normal\" refer to IS-IS Hellos (IIHs)\n

      the\n   mechanisms defined in this document.  Timers T1 and T2 are used both\n
      \  by a restarting router and a starting router.  Timer T3 is used only\n   by
      a restarting router.\n   NOTE: These timers are NOT applicable to a router that
      is preparing\n   to do a planned restart.\n   An instance of the timer T1 is
      maintained per interface and indicates\n   the time after which an unacknowledged
      (re)start attempt will be\n   repeated.  A typical value is 3 seconds.\n   An
      instance of the timer T2 is maintained for each LSP database\n   (LSPDB) present
      in the system.  For example, for a Level 1/2 system,\n   there will be an instance
      of the timer T2 for Level 1 and an instance\n   for Level 2.  This is the maximum
      time that the system will wait for\n   LSPDB synchronization.  A typical value
      is 60 seconds.\n   A single instance of the timer T3 is maintained for the entire\n

      - "3.2.1.  Use of RR and RA Bits\n   The RR bit is used by a (re)starting router
        to signal to its\n   neighbors that a (re)start is in progress, that an existing
        adjacency\n   SHOULD be maintained even under circumstances when the normal\n
        \  operation of the adjacency state machine would require the adjacency\n
        \  to be reinitialized, to request a set of CSNPs, and to request\n   setting
        of the SRMflags.\n   The RA bit is sent by the neighbor of a (re)starting
        router to\n   acknowledge the receipt of a Restart TLV with the RR bit set.\n
        \  When the neighbor of a (re)starting router receives an IIH with the\n   Restart
        TLV having the RR bit set, if there exists on this interface\n   an adjacency
        in the UP state with the same System ID and, in the case\n   of a LAN circuit,

        of the \"Intermediate System Neighbors\" option\n   (LAN circuits) or the
        \"Point-to-Point Three-Way Adjacency\" option\n   (Point-to-Point circuits):\n
        \  a.  the state of the adjacency is not changed.  If this is the first\n
        \      IIH with the RR bit set that this system has received associated\n
        \      with this adjacency, then the adjacency is marked as being in\n       \"Restart
        mode\" and the adjacency Holding Time is refreshed --\n       otherwise, the
        Holding Time is not refreshed.  The Remaining Time\n       transmitted according
        to (b) below MUST reflect the actual time\n       after which the adjacency
        will now expire.  Receipt of an IIH\n       with the RR bit reset will clear
        the \"Restart mode\" state.  This\n       procedure allows the restarting
        router to cause the neighbor to\n       maintain the adjacency long enough
        for restart to successfully\n       complete while also preventing repetitive
        restarts from\n       maintaining an adjacency indefinitely.  Whether or not
        an\n       adjacency is marked as being in \"Restart mode\" has no effect
        on\n       adjacency state transitions.\n   b.  immediately (i.e., without
        waiting for any currently running\n       timer interval to expire but with
        a small random delay of a few\n       tens of milliseconds on LANs to avoid
        \"storms\") transmit over the\n       corresponding interface an IIH including

        of Point-to-Point\n       adjacencies having updated the \"Point-to-Point
        Three-Way\n       Adjacency\" option to reflect any new values received from
        the\n       (re)starting router.  (This allows a restarting router to quickly\n
        \      acquire the correct information to place in its hellos.)  The\n       Remaining
        Time MUST be set to the current time (in seconds)\n       before the holding
        timer on this adjacency is due to expire.  If\n       the corresponding interface
        is a LAN interface, then the\n       Restarting Neighbor System ID SHOULD
        be set to the System ID of\n       the router from which the IIH with the
        RR bit set was received.\n       This is required to correctly associate the
        acknowledgement and\n       Holding Time in the case where multiple systems
        on a LAN restart\n       at approximately the same time.  This IIH SHOULD
        be transmitted\n       before any LSPs or SNPs are transmitted as a result
        of the\n       receipt of the original IIH.\n   c.  if the corresponding interface
        is a Point-to-Point interface, or\n       if the receiving router has the

        (MAC) address breaking\n       ties) among those routers to which the receiving
        router has an\n       adjacency in the UP state on this interface whose IIHs

    - contents:
      - "3.2.2.  Use of the SA Bit\n   The SA bit is used by a starting router to
        request that its neighbor\n   suppress advertisement of the adjacency to the
        starting router in the\n   neighbor's LSPs.\n   A router that is starting
        has no maintained forwarding function\n   state.  This may or may not be the
        first time the router has started.\n   If this is not the first time the router
        has started, copies of LSPs\n   generated by this router in its previous incarnation
        may exist in the\n   LSP databases of other routers in the network.  These
        copies are\n   likely to appear \"newer\" than LSPs initially generated by
        the\n   starting router due to the reinitialization of LSP fragment sequence\n
        \  numbers by the starting router.  This may cause temporary blackholes\n
        \  to occur until the normal operation of the update process causes the\n
        \  starting router to regenerate and flood copies of its own LSPs with\n   higher
        sequence numbers.  The temporary blackholes can be avoided if\n   the starting
        router's neighbors suppress advertising an adjacency to\n   the starting router
        until the starting router has been able to\n   propagate newer versions of
        LSPs generated by previous incarnations.\n   When a router receives an IIH
        with the Restart TLV having the SA bit\n   set, if there exists on this interface
        an adjacency in the UP state\n   with the same System ID and, in the case
        of a LAN circuit, with the\n   same source LAN address, then the router MUST
        suppress advertisement\n   of the adjacency to the neighbor in its own LSPs.
        \ Until an IIH with\n   the SA bit clear has been received, the neighbor advertisement
        MUST\n   continue to be suppressed.  If the adjacency transitions to the UP\n
        \  state, the new adjacency MUST NOT be advertised until an IIH with the\n
        \  SA bit clear has been received.\n   Note that a router that suppresses
        advertisement of an adjacency MUST\n   NOT use this adjacency when performing
        its SPF calculation.  In\n   particular, if an implementation follows the
        example guidelines\n   presented in [ISO10589], Annex C.2.5, Step 0:b) \"pre-load
        TENT with\n   the local adjacency database\", the suppressed adjacency MUST

        Remaining Time to a\n   value greater than the expected control-plane restart
        time.  The PR\n   bit SHOULD remain set in IIHs until the restart is initiated.\n
        \  The PA bit is sent by the neighbor of a router planning to restart to\n

        neighbor is aware of the planned restart\n   and -- in the absence of topology
        changes as described below -- will\n   maintain the adjacency for the Remaining
        Time included in the IIH\n   with PA set.\n   By definition, a restarting
        router maintains forwarding state across\n   the control-plane restart (see
        Section 2).  But while a control-plane\n   restart is in progress, it is expected
        that the restarting router\n   will be unable to respond to topology changes.
        \ It is therefore\n   useful to signal a planned restart so that the neighbors
        of the\n   restarting router can determine whether it is safe to maintain
        the\n   adjacency if other topology changes occur prior to the completion
        of\n   the restart.  Signaling a planned restart in the absence of\n   maintained
        forwarding-plane state is likely to lead to significant\n   traffic loss and
        MUST NOT be done.\n   Neighbors of the router that have signaled planned restart
        SHOULD\n   maintain the adjacency in a Planned Restart State until it receives\n
        \  an IIH with the RR bit set, it receives an IIH with both PR and RR\n   bits
        clear, or the adjacency Holding Time expires -- whichever occurs\n   first.
        \ Neighbors that choose not to follow the recommended behavior\n   need to
        consider the impact on traffic delivery of not using the\n   restarting router
        for forwarding traffic during the restart period.\n   While the adjacency
        is in Planned Restart State, some or all of the\n   following actions MAY
        be taken:\n   a.  If additional topology changes occur, the adjacency that
        is in\n       Planned Restart State MAY be brought down even though the Holding\n
        \      Time has not yet expired.  Given that the neighbor that has\n       signaled
        a planned restart is not expected to update its\n       forwarding plane in
        response to signaling of the topology changes\n       (since it is restarting)
        traffic that transits that node is at\n       risk of being improperly forwarded.
        \ On a LAN circuit, if the\n       router in Planned Restart State is the
        DIS at any supported\n       level, the adjacency or adjacencies SHOULD be
        brought down\n       whenever any LSP update is either generated or received
        so as to\n       trigger a new DIS election.  Failure to do so will compromise
        the\n       reliability of the update process on that circuit.  What other\n
        \      criteria are used to determine what topology changes will trigger\n
        \      bringing the adjacency down is a local implementation decision.\n   b.
        \ If a Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] Session\n       to
        the neighbor that signals a planned restart is in the UP state\n       and
        subsequently goes down, the event MAY be ignored since it is\n       possible
        this is an expected side effect of the restart.  Use of\n       the Control-Plane
        Independent state as signaled in BFD control\n       packets SHOULD be considered
        in the decision to ignore a BFD\n       Session DOWN event.\n   c.  On a Point-to-Point
        circuit, transmission of LSPs, CSNPs, and\n       Partial Sequence Number
        PDU (PSNPs) MAY be suppressed.  It is\n       expected that the PDUs will
        not be received.\n   Use of the PR bit provides a means to safely support
        restart periods\n   that are significantly longer than standard Holding Times.\n"

      - "3.3.1.  Adjacency Reacquisition during Restart\n   The restarting router
        explicitly notifies its neighbor that the\n   adjacency is being reacquired
        and, hence, that it SHOULD NOT\n   reinitialize the adjacency.  This is achieved
        by setting the RR bit\n   in the Restart TLV.  When the neighbor of a restarting
        router\n   receives an IIH with the Restart TLV having the RR bit set, if
        there\n   exists on this interface an adjacency in the UP state with the same\n
        \  System ID and, in the case of a LAN circuit, with the same source LAN\n
        \  address, then the procedures described in Section 3.2.1 are followed.\n
        \  A router that does not support the restart capability will ignore the\n
        \  Restart TLV and reinitialize the adjacency as normal, returning an\n   IIH
        without the Restart TLV.\n   On restarting, a router initializes the timer
        T3, starts the timer T2\n   for each LSPDB, and for each interface (and in
        the case of a LAN\n   circuit, for each level) starts the timer T1 and transmits
        an IIH\n   containing the Restart TLV with the RR bit set.\n   On a Point-to-Point
        circuit, the restarting router SHOULD set the\n   \"Adjacency Three-Way State\"
        to \"Init\", because the receipt of the\n   acknowledging IIH (with RA set)
        MUST cause the adjacency to enter the\n   UP state immediately.\n   On a LAN
        circuit, the LAN-ID assigned to the circuit SHOULD be the\n   same as that
        used prior to the restart.  In particular, for any\n   circuits for which
        the restarting router was previously DIS, the use\n   of a different LAN-ID
        would necessitate the generation of a new set\n   of pseudonode LSPs and corresponding
        changes in all the LSPs\n   referencing them from other routers on the LAN.
        \ By preserving the\n   LAN-ID across the restart, this churn can be prevented.
        \ To enable a\n   restarting router to learn the LAN-ID used prior to restart,
        the LAN-\n   ID specified in an IIH with RR set MUST be ignored.\n   Transmission
        of \"normal IIHs\" is inhibited until the conditions\n   described below are
        met (in order to avoid causing an unnecessary\n   adjacency initialization).
        \ Upon expiry of the timer T1, it is\n   restarted and the IIH is retransmitted
        as above.\n   When a restarting router receives an IIH a local adjacency is\n
        \  established as usual, and if the IIH contains a Restart TLV with the\n
        \  RA bit set (and on LAN circuits with a Restart Neighbor System ID\n   that
        matches that of the local system), the receipt of the\n   acknowledgement
        over that interface is noted.  When the RA bit is set\n   and the state of
        the remote adjacency is UP, then the timer T3 is set\n   to the minimum of
        its current value and the value of the Remaining\n   Time field in the received
        IIH.\n   On a Point-to-Point link, receipt of an IIH not containing the\n
        \  Restart TLV is also treated as an acknowledgement, since it indicates\n
        \  that the neighbor is not restart capable.  However, since no CSNP is\n
        \  guaranteed to be received over this interface, the timer T1 is\n   canceled
        immediately without waiting for a complete set of CSNPs.\n   Synchronization
        may therefore be deemed complete even though there\n   are some LSPs that
        are held (only) by this neighbor (see\n   Section 3.4).  In this case, we
        also want to be certain that the\n   neighbor will reinitialize the adjacency
        in order to guarantee that\n   the SRMflags have been set on its database,
        thus ensuring eventual\n   LSPDB synchronization.  This is guaranteed to happen
        except in the\n   case where the Adjacency Three-Way State in the received
        IIH is UP\n   and the Neighbor Extended Local Circuit ID matches the Extended
        Local\n   Circuit ID assigned by the restarting router.  In this case, the\n
        \  restarting router MUST force the adjacency to reinitialize by setting\n
        \  the local Adjacency Three-Way State to DOWN and sending a normal IIH.\n
        \  In the case of a LAN interface, receipt of an IIH not containing the\n
        \  Restart TLV is unremarkable since synchronization can still occur so\n
        \  long as at least one of the non-restarting neighboring routers on the\n
        \  LAN supports restart.  Therefore, T1 continues to run in this case.\n   If
        none of the neighbors on the LAN are restart capable, T1 will\n   eventually
        expire after the locally defined number of retries.\n   In the case of a Point-to-Point
        circuit, the LocalCircuitID and\n   Extended Local Circuit ID information
        contained in the IIH can be\n   used immediately to generate an IIH containing
        the correct three-way\n   handshake information.  The presence of Neighbor
        Extended Local\n   Circuit ID information that does not match the value currently
        in use\n   by the local system is ignored (since the IIH may have been\n   transmitted
        before the neighbor had received the new value from the\n   restarting router),
        but the adjacency remains in the initializing\n   state until the correct
        information is received.\n   In the case of a LAN circuit, the source neighbor
        information (e.g.,\n   SNPAAddress) is recorded and used for adjacency establishment
        and\n   maintenance as normal.\n   When BOTH a complete set of CSNPs (for
        each active level, in the case\n   of a Point-to-Point circuit) and an acknowledgement
        have been\n   received over the interface, the timer T1 is canceled.\n   Once
        the timer T1 has been canceled, subsequent IIHs are transmitted\n   according
        to the normal algorithms but including the Restart TLV with\n   both RR and
        RA clear.\n   If a LAN contains a mixture of systems, only some of which support\n
        \  the new algorithm, database synchronization is still guaranteed, but\n
        \  the \"old\" systems will have reinitialized their adjacencies.\n   If an
        interface is active but does not have any neighboring router\n   reachable
        over that interface, the timer T1 would never be canceled,\n   and according
        to Section 3.4.1.1, the SPF would never be run.\n   Therefore, timer T1 is
        canceled after some predetermined number of\n   expirations (which MAY be
        1).\n"

      - "3.3.2.  Adjacency Acquisition during Start\n   The starting router wants
        to ensure that in the event that a\n   neighboring router has an adjacency
        to the starting router in the UP\n   state (from a previous incarnation of
        the starting router), this\n   adjacency is reinitialized.  The starting router
        also wants\n   neighboring routers to suppress advertisement of an adjacency
        to the\n   starting router until LSP database synchronization is achieved.
        \ This\n   is achieved by sending IIHs with the RR bit clear and the SA bit
        set\n   in the Restart TLV.  The RR bit remains clear and the SA bit remains\n

      - contents:
        - "3.4.1.1.  Restarting\n   In order to avoid causing unnecessary routing
          churn in other routers,\n   it is highly desirable that the router's own
          LSPs generated by the\n   restarting system are the same as those previously
          present in the\n   network (assuming no other changes have taken place).
          \ It is\n   important therefore not to regenerate and flood the LSPs until
          all\n   the adjacencies have been reestablished and any information required\n
          \  for propagation into the local LSPs is fully available.  Ideally, the\n
          \  information is loaded into the LSPs in a deterministic way, such that\n
          \  the same information occurs in the same place in the same LSP (and\n
          \  hence the LSPs are identical to their previous versions).  If this\n
          \  can be achieved, the new versions may not even cause SPF to be run in\n
          \  other systems.  However, provided the same information is included in\n
          \  the set of LSPs (albeit in a different order, and possibly different\n
          \  LSPs), the result of running the SPF will be the same and will not\n
          \  cause churn to the forwarding tables.\n   In the case of a restarting
          router, none of the router's own LSPs are\n   transmitted, nor are the router's
          own forwarding tables updated while\n   the timer T3 is running.\n   Redistribution
          of inter-level information MUST be regenerated before\n   this router's
          LSP is flooded to other nodes.  Therefore, the Level-n\n   non-pseudonode
          LSP(s) MUST NOT be flooded until the other level's T2\n   timer has expired
          and its SPF has been run.  This ensures that any\n   inter-level information
          that is to be propagated can be included in\n   the Level-n LSP(s).\n   During
          this period, if one of the router's own (including\n   pseudonodes) LSPs
          is received, which the local router does not\n   currently have in its own
          database, it is NOT purged.  Under normal\n   operation, such an LSP would
          be purged, since the LSP clearly should\n   not be present in the global
          LSP database.  However, in the present\n   circumstances, this would be
          highly undesirable, because it could\n   cause premature removal of a router's
          own LSP -- and hence churn in\n   remote routers.  Even if the local system
          has one or more of the\n   router's own LSPs (which it has generated but
          not yet transmitted),\n   it is still not valid to compare the received
          LSP against this set,\n   since it may be that as a result of propagation
          between Level 1 and\n   Level 2 (or vice versa), a further router's own
          LSP will need to be\n   generated when the LSP databases have synchronized.\n
          \  During this period, a restarting router SHOULD send CSNPs as it\n   normally
          would.  Information about the router's own LSPs MAY be\n   included, but
          if it is included, it MUST be based on LSPs that have\n   been received,
          not on versions that have been generated (but not yet\n   transmitted).
          \ This restriction is necessary to prevent premature\n   removal of an LSP
          from the global LSP database.\n   When the timer T2 expires or is canceled,
          indicating that\n   synchronization for that level is complete, the SPF
          for that level is\n   run in order to derive any information that is required
          to be\n   propagated to another level, but the forwarding tables are not
          yet\n   updated.\n   Once the other level's SPF has run and any inter-level
          propagation\n   has been resolved, the router's own LSPs can be generated
          and\n   flooded.  Any own LSPs that were previously ignored, but that are
          not\n   part of the current set of own LSPs (including pseudonodes), MUST\n
          \  then be purged.  Note that it is possible that a Designated Router\n
          \  change may have taken place and, consequently, the router SHOULD\n   purge
          those pseudonode LSPs that it previously owned but that are now\n   no longer
          part of its set of pseudonode LSPs.\n   When all the T2 timers have expired
          or been canceled, the timer T3 is\n   canceled, and the local forwarding
          tables are updated.\n   If the timer T3 expires before all the T2 timers
          have expired or been\n   canceled, this indicates that the synchronization
          process is taking\n   longer than the minimum Holding Time of the neighbors.
          \ The router's\n   own LSP(s) for levels that have not yet completed their
          first SPF\n   computation are then flooded with the overload bit set to
          indicate\n   that the router's LSPDB is not yet synchronized (and therefore
          other\n   routers MUST NOT compute routes through this router).  Normal\n
          \  operation of the update process resumes, and the local forwarding\n   tables
          are updated.  In order to prevent the neighbor's adjacencies\n   from expiring,
          IIHs with the normal interface value for the Holding\n   Time are transmitted
          over all interfaces with neither RR nor RA set\n   in the Restart TLV.  This
          will cause the neighbors to refresh their\n   adjacencies.  The router's
          own LSP(s) will continue to have the\n   overload bit set until timer T2
          has expired or been canceled.\n"

        - "3.4.1.2.  Starting\n   In the case of a starting router, as soon as each
          adjacency is\n   established, and before any CSNP exchanges, the router's
          own zeroth\n   LSP is transmitted with the overload bit set.  This prevents
          other\n   routers from computing routes through the router until it has\n
          \  reliably acquired the complete set of LSPs.  The overload bit remains\n
          \  set in subsequent transmissions of the zeroth LSP (such as will occur\n
          \  if a previous copy of the router's own zeroth LSP is still present in\n
          \  the network) while any timer T2 is running.\n   When all the T2 timers
          have been canceled, the router's own LSP(s)\n   MAY be regenerated with
          the overload bit clear (assuming the router\n   is not in fact overloaded,
          and there is no other reason, such as\n   incomplete BGP convergence, to
          keep the overload bit set) and flooded\n   as normal.\n   Other LSPs owned
          by this router (including pseudonodes) are generated\n   and flooded as
          normal, irrespective of the timer T2.  The SPF is also\n   run as normal
          and the Routing Information Base (RIB) and Forwarding\n   Information Base
          (FIB) updated as routes become available.\n   To avoid the possible formation
          of temporary blackholes, the starting\n   router sets the SA bit in the
          Restart TLV (as described in\n   Section 3.3.2) in all IIHs that it sends.\n
          \  When all T2 timers have been canceled, the starting router MUST\n   transmit
          IIHs with the SA bit clear.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Any new security issues raised by the procedures
    in this document\n   depend upon the ability of an attacker to inject a false
    but\n   apparently valid IIH, the ease/difficulty of which has not been\n   altered.\n
    \  If the RR bit is set in a false IIH, neighbors who receive such an\n   IIH
    will continue to maintain an existing adjacency in the UP state\n   and may (re)send
    a complete set of CSNPs.  While the latter action is\n   wasteful, neither action
    causes any disruption in correct protocol\n   operation.\n   If the RA bit is
    set in a false IIH, a (re)starting router that\n   receives such an IIH may falsely
    believe that there is a neighbor on\n   the corresponding interface that supports
    the procedures described in\n   this document.  In the absence of receipt of a
    complete set of CSNPs\n   on that interface, this could delay the completion of
    (re)start\n   procedures by requiring the timer T1 to time out the locally defined\n
    \  maximum number of retries.  This behavior is the same as would occur\n   on
    a LAN where none of the (re)starting router's neighbors support\n   the procedures
    in this document and is covered in Sections 3.3.1 and\n   3.3.2.\n   If the SA
    bit is set in a false IIH, this could cause suppression of\n   the advertisement
    of an IS neighbor, which could either continue for\n   an indefinite period or
    occur intermittently with the result being a\n   possible loss of reachability
    to some destinations in the network\n   and/or increased frequency of LSP flooding
    and SPF calculation.\n   If the PR bit is set in a false IIH, neighbors who receive
    such an\n   IIH could modify the Holding Time of an existing adjacency\n   inappropriately.
    \ In the event of topology changes, the neighbor\n   might also choose to not
    flood the topology updates and/or bring the\n   adjacency down in the false belief
    that the forwarding plane of the\n   router identified as the source of the false
    IIH is not currently\n   processing announced topology changes.  This would result
    in\n   unnecessary forwarding disruption.\n   If the PA bit is set in a false
    IIH, a router that receives such an\n   IIH may falsely believe that the neighbor
    on the corresponding\n   interface supports the planned restart procedures defined
    in this\n   document.  If such a router is planning to restart, it might then\n
    \  proceed to initiate a restart in the false expectation that the\n   neighbor
    has updated its Holding Time as requested.  This may result\n   in the neighbor
    bringing down the adjacency while the receiving\n   router is restarting, causing
    unnecessary disruption to forwarding.\n   The possibility of IS-IS PDU spoofing
    can be reduced by the use of\n   authentication, as described in [RFC1195] and
    [ISO10589], and\n   especially by the use of cryptographic authentication, as
    described\n   in [RFC5304] and [RFC5310].\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Summary of Changes from RFC 5306\n   This document extends RFC 5306
    by introducing support for signaling\n   the neighbors of a restarting router
    that a planned restart is about\n   to occur.  This allows the neighbors to be
    aware of the state of the\n   restarting router so that appropriate action may
    be taken if other\n   topology changes occur while the planned restart is in progress.\n
    \  Since the forwarding plane of the restarting router is maintained\n   based
    upon the pre-restart state of the network, additional topology\n   changes introduce
    the possibility that traffic may be lost if paths\n   via the restarting router
    continue to be used while the restart is in\n   progress.\n   In support of this
    new functionality, two new flags have been\n   introduced:\n   PR -  Restart is
    planned\n   PA -  Planned restart acknowledgement\n   No changes to the post-restart
    exchange between the restarting router\n   and its neighbors have been introduced.\n"
