  - "3. Overview\n   To evaluate the methods and models for policy based routing,\
    \ it is\n   necessary to investigate the context into which the model is to be\n\
    \   used, as there are a variety of different methods to introduce\n   policies.\
    \  Most frequently the following three models are referenced:\n       Policy based\
    \ distribution of routing information\n       Policy based packet filtering/forwarding\n\
    \       Policy based dynamic allocation of network resources (e.g.,\n       bandwidth,\
    \ buffers, etc.)\n   The relative properties of those methods need to be evaluated\
    \ to find\n   their merits for a specific application.  In some cases, more than\n\
    \   one method needs to be implemented.\n   While comparing different models for\
    \ policy based routing, it is\n   important to realize that specific models have\
    \ been designed to\n   satisfy a certain set of requirements.  For different models\
    \ these\n   requirements may or may not overlap.  Even if they overlap, they may\n\
    \   have a different degree of granularity.  In the first model, the\n   requirements\
    \ can be formulated at the Administrative Domain or\n   network number level.\
    \  In the second model, the requirements can be\n   formulated at the end system\
    \ level or probably even at the level of\n   individual users.  In the third model,\
    \ the requirements need to be\n   formulated at both the end system and local\
    \ router level, as well as\n   at the level of Routing Domains and Administrative\
    \ Domains.\n   Each of these models looks at the power of policy based routing\
    \ in a\n   different way.  They may be implemented separately or in combination\n\
    \   with other methods.  The model to describe policy based dynamic\n   allocation\
    \ of network resources is orthogonal to the model of policy\n   based distribution\
    \ of routing information.  However, in an actual\n   implementation each of these\
    \ models may interact.\n   It is important to realize that the use of a policy\
    \ based scheme for\n   individual network applications requires that the actual\
    \ effects as\n   well as the interaction of multiple methods need to be determined\n\
    \   ahead of time by policy.\n   While uncontrolled dynamic routing and allocation\
    \ of resources may\n   have a better real time behavior, the use of policy based\
    \ routing\n   will provide a predictable, stable result based on the desires of\
    \ the\n   administrator.  In a production network, it is imperative to provide\n\
    \   continuously consistent and acceptable services.\n"
- title: 4. Policy based distribution of routing information

  - "4. Policy based distribution of routing information\n   Goals:\n      The goal\
    \ of this model is to enforce certain flows by means of\n      policy based distribution\
    \ of routing information.  This\n      enforcement allows control over who can\
    \ and who can not use\n      specific network resources.\n      Enforcement is\
    \ done at the network or Administrative Domain (AD)\n      level - macroscopic\
    \ policies.\n   Description:\n      A good example of policy based routing based\
    \ on the distribution\n      of routing information is the NSFNET with its interfaces\
    \ to mid-\n      level networks [1], [2].  At the interface into the NSFNET, the\n\
    \      routing information is authenticated and controlled by four means:\n  \
    \       1. Routing peer authentication based on the source address.\n        \
    \ 2. Verification of the Administrative Domain identification\n            (currently\
    \ EGP Autonomous System numbers).\n         3. Verification of Internet network\
    \ numbers which are\n            advertised via the routing peer.\n         4.\
    \ Control of metrics via a Routing Policy Data Base for the\n            announced\
    \ Internet network numbers to allow for primary\n            paths to the NSFNET\
    \ as well as for paths of a lesser\n            degree.\n      At the interfaces\
    \ that pass routing traffic out of the NSFNET, the\n      NSS routing code authenticates\
    \ the router acting as an EGP peer by\n      its address as well as the Administrative\
    \ Domain identification\n      (Autonomous System Number).\n      Outbound announcements\
    \ of network numbers via the EGP protocol are\n      controlled on the basis of\
    \ Administrative Domains or individual\n      network numbers by the NSFNET Routing\
    \ Policy Data Base.\n      The NSFNET routing policy implementation has been in\
    \ place since\n      July 1988 and the NSFNET community has significant experience\
    \ with\n      its application.\n      Another example of policy controlled dissimination\
    \ of routing\n      information is a method proposed for ESNET in [3].\n   Benefits:\n\
    \      A major merit of the control of routing information flow is that\n    \
    \  it enables the engineering of large wide area networks and allows\n      for\
    \ a more meshed environment than would be possible without tight\n      control.\
    \  Resource allocation in a non-hostile environment is\n      possible by filtering\
    \ specific network numbers or Administrative\n      Domains on a per need basis.\
    \  Another important benefit of this\n      scheme is that it allows for network\
    \ policy control with virtually\n      no performance degradation, as only the\
    \ routing packets themselves\n      are relevant for policy control.  Routing\
    \ tables are generated as\n      a result of these interactions.  This means that\
    \ this scheme\n      imposes only very little impact on packet switching performance\
    \ at\n      large.\n   Concerns:\n      Policy based routing information distribution\
    \ does not address\n      packet based filtering.  An example is the inability\
    \ to prevent\n      malicious attacks by introduced source routed IP packets.\
    \  While\n      resource allocation is possible, it extends largely to filtering\n\
    \      on network numbers or whole Administrative Domains, but it would\n    \
    \  not extend to end systems or individual users.\n   Costs:\n      Policy based\
    \ routing in the NSFNET is implemented in a series of\n      configuration files.\
    \  These configuration files are in turn\n      generated from a routing information\
    \ database.  The careful\n      creation of this routing information database\
    \ requires knowledge\n      of the Internet at large.  Because the Internet is\
    \ changing\n      constantly, the upkeep of this routing information database\
    \ is a\n      continuous requirement.  However, the effort of collecting and\n\
    \      maintaining an accurate view of the Internet at large can be\n      distributed.\n\
    \      Since policy controlled distribution of routing information allows\n  \
    \    for filtering on the basis of network numbers or Administrative\n      Domains,\
    \ the routing information database only needs to collect\n      information for\
    \ the more than 1300 networks within the Internet\n      today.\n"
- title: 5. Policy based packet filtering/forwarding
  contents:
  - "5. Policy based packet filtering/forwarding\n   Goals:\n      The goal of the\
    \ model of policy based packet filtering/forwarding\n      is to allow the enforcement\
    \ of certain flows of network traffic on\n      a per packet basis.  This enforcement\
    \ allows the network\n      administrator to control who can and who can not use\
    \ specific\n      network resources.\n      Enforcement may be done at the end\
    \ system or even individual user\n      level - microscopic policies.\n   Description:\n\
    \      An example of packet/flow based policies is outlined in [4].  In a\n  \
    \    generic sense, policy based packet filtering/forwarding allows\n      very\
    \ tight control of the distribution of packet traffic.  An\n      implemented\
    \ example of policy based filtering/forwarding is a\n      protection mechanism\
    \ built into the NSFNET NSS structure, whereby\n      the nodes can protect themselves\
    \ against packets targeted at the\n      NSFNET itself by filtering according\
    \ to IP destination. While this\n      feature has so far not been enabled, it\
    \ is fully implemented and\n      can be turned on within a matter of seconds.\n\
    \   Benefits:\n      The principal merit of this scheme is that it allows the\n\
    \      enforcement of packet policies and resource allocation down to\n      individual\
    \ end systems and perhaps even individual end users.  It\n      does not address\
    \ a sane distribution of routing information.  If\n      policies are contained\
    \ in the packets themselves it could identify\n      users, resulting in the ability\
    \ of users to move between\n      locations.\n   Concerns:\n      The major concern\
    \ would be the potentially significant impact on\n      the performance of the\
    \ routers, as, at least for tight policy\n      enforcements, each packet to be\
    \ forwarded would need to be\n      verified against a policy data base.  This\
    \ limitation makes the\n      application of this scheme questionable using current\
    \ Internet\n      technology, but it may be very applicable to circuit switched\n\
    \      environments (with source-routed IP packets being similar to a\n      circuit\
    \ switched environment).  Another difficulty could be the\n      sheer number\
    \ of potential policies to be enforced, which could\n      result in a very high\
    \ administrative effort.  This could result\n      from the creation of policies\
    \ at the per-user level.  Furthermore,\n      the overhead of carrying policy\
    \ information in potentially every\n      packet could result in additional burdens\
    \ on resource\n      availabilities.  This again is more applicable to connection-\n\
    \      oriented networks, such as public data networks, where the policy\n   \
    \   would only need to be verified at the call setup time.  It is an\n      open\
    \ question how well packet based policies will scale in a large\n      and non\
    \ homogeneous Internet environment, where policies may be\n      created by all\
    \ of the participants.  These creations of policy\n      types of services may\
    \ have to be doable in real time.\n      Scaling may require hierarchy.  Hierarchy\
    \ may conflict with\n      arbitrary Type of Service (TOS) routing, which is one\
    \ of the\n      benefits of this model.\n   Costs of implementation:\n      A\
    \ large scale implemention of packet based policy routing would\n      require\
    \ a routing information base that would contain information\n      down to the\
    \ end system level and possibly end users.  If one would\n      assume that for\
    \ each of the 1300 networks there is an average of\n      200 end systems, this\
    \ would result in over 260000 end systems\n      Internet wide.  Each end system\
    \ in turn could further contribute\n      some information on the type of traffic\
    \ desired, including types\n      of service (issues like agency network selection),\
    \ potentially on\n      a per-user basis.  The effort for the routing policy data\
    \ base\n      could be immense, in particular if there is a scaling requirement\n\
    \      towards a variety of policies for backbones, mid-level networks,\n    \
    \  campus networks, subnets, hosts, and users.  The administration of\n      this\
    \ \"packet routing\" database could be distributed.  However,\n      with a fully\
    \ distributed database of this size several consistency\n      checks would have\
    \ to be built into the system.\n"

  - "6. Policy based dynamic allocation of network resources (e.g.,\n      bandwidth,\
    \ buffers, etc.).\n   Goals:\n      Flexible and economical allocation of network\
    \ resources based on\n      current needs and certain policies.  Policies may\
    \ be formulated at\n      the network or Administrative Domain (AD) levels.  It\
    \ is also\n      possible to formulate policies which will regulate resource\n\
    \      allocation for different types of traffic (e.g., Telnet, FTP,\n      precedence\
    \ indicators, network control traffic).\n      Enforcement of policy based allocation\
    \ of network resources might\n      be implemented within the following parts\
    \ of the network:\n          routers for networks and Administrative Domain (AD)\
    \ levels\n          circuit switches for networks\n          end systems establishing\
    \ network connections\n   Description:\n      Policy based allocation of bandwidth\
    \ could allow the modulation of\n      the circuits of the networking infrastructure\
    \ according to real\n      time needs.  Assuming that available resources are\
    \ limited towards\n      an upper bound, the allocation of bandwidth would need\
    \ to be\n      controlled by policy.  One example might be a single end system\n\
    \      that may or may not be allowed to, perhaps even automatically,\n      take\
    \ resources away from other end systems or users.  An example\n      of dynamic\
    \ bandwidth allocation is the currently implemented\n      circuit switched IDNX\
    \ component of the NSFNET, as well as the MCI\n      Digital Reconfiguration Service\
    \ (DRS) which is planned for the\n      NSFNET later this year.\n      Another\
    \ model for resource allocation occurs at the packet level,\n      where the allocation\
    \ is controlled by multiple packet queues.\n      This could allow for precedence\
    \ queuing, with preferences based on\n      some type of service and preferred\
    \ forwarding of recognized\n      critical data, such as network monitoring, control\
    \ and routing.\n      An example can be found in the NSFNET, where the NSFNET\
    \ nodes\n      prefer traffic affiliated with the NSFNET backbone network number\n\
    \      over all other traffic, to allow for predictable passing of\n      routing\
    \ information as well as effective network monitoring and\n      control.  At\
    \ the other end of the spectrum, an implementation\n      could also allow for\
    \ queues of most deferrable traffic (such as\n      large background file transfers).\n\
    \   Benefits:\n      Dynamic allocation of bandwidth could allow for a truly flexible\n\
    \      environment where the networking infrastructure could create\n      bandwidth\
    \ on a per need basis.  This could result in significant\n      cost reductions\
    \ during times when little bandwidth is needed.\n      This method could potentially\
    \ accommodate real time transient high\n      bandwidth requirements, potentially\
    \ by reducing the bandwidth\n      available to other parts of the infrastructure.\
    \  A positive aspect\n      is that the bandwidth allocation could be protocol\
    \ independent,\n      with no impact on routing protocols or packet forwarding\n\
    \      performance.\n      Policy based allocation of bandwidth can provide a\
    \ predictable\n      dynamic environment.  The rules about allocation of bandwidth\
    \ at\n      the circuit level or at the packet level need to be determined by\n\
    \      a consistent and predictable policy, so that other networks or\n      Administrative\
    \ Domains can tune their allocation of networking\n      resources at the same\
    \ time.\n   Concerns:\n      The policies involved in making dynamic bandwidth\
    \ allocation in a\n      largely packet switching environment possible are still\
    \ in the\n      development phase.  Even the technical implications of\n     \
    \ infrastructure reconfiguration in result of events happening on a\n      higher\
    \ level still requires additional research.\n      A policy based allocation of\
    \ bandwidth could tune the network to\n      good performance, but could cause\
    \ networks located in other\n      Administrative Domains to pass traffic poorly.\
    \  It is important\n      that network resource policy information for a network\
    \ be\n      discussed within the context of its Administrative Domain.\n     \
    \ Administrative Domains need to discuss their network resource\n      allocation\
    \ policies with other Administrative Domains.\n      The technical problem of\

    \ a \"network resource policy\n      information\" database available to all administrators\

- title: 7. Discussion
  contents:
  - "7. Discussion\n   Both the first and the second model of policy based routing\
    \ are\n   similar in the sense that their goal is to enforce certain flows.\n\
    \   This enforcement allows the control of access to scarce network\n   resources\
    \ (if the resource is not scarce, there is no performance\n   reason to control\
    \ access to it).  The major difference is the level\n   of enforcement: macroscopic\
    \ level versus microscopic level control.\n   Associated with the enforcement\
    \ for a certain network resource is the\n   cost.  If this cost is higher than\
    \ the cost required to make a\n   particular resource less scarce, then the feasibility\
    \ of enforcement\n   may be questionable.\n   If portions of the Internet find\
    \ that microscopic enforcement of\n   policy is necessary, then this will need\
    \ to be implementable without\n   significant performance degradation to the networking\
    \ environment at\n   large.  Local policies within specific Routing Domains or\n\
    \   Administrative Domains should not affect global Internet traffic or\n   routing.\
    \  Policies within Administrative Domains which act as traffic\n   transit systems\
    \ (such as the NSFNET) should not be affected by\n   policies a single network\
    \ imposes for its local benefit.\n   Some models of policy routing are trying\
    \ to deal with cases where\n   network resources require rather complex usage\
    \ policies.  One of\n   scenarios in [4] is one in which a specific agency may\
    \ have some\n   network resource (in the example it is a link) which is sometimes\n\
    \   underutilized.  The goal is to sell this resource to other agencies\n   during\
    \ the underutilization period to recover expenses.  This\n   situation is equivalent\
    \ to the problem of finding optimum routes,\n   with respect to a certain TOS,\
    \ in the presence of network resources\n   (e.g., links) with variable characteristics.\
    \  Any proposed solution\n   to this problem should address such issues as network\
    \ and route\n   stability.  More feasibility study is necessary for the whole\n\
    \   approach where links used for global communication are also subject\n   to\
    \ arbitrary local policies.  An alternative approach would be to\n   reconfigure\
    \ the network topology so that underutilized links will be\n   dropped and possibly\
    \ returned to the phone company.  This is\n   comparable to what the NSFNET is\
    \ planning on doing with the MCI\n   Digital Reconfiguration Service (DRS).  A\
    \ DRS model may appear\n   cleaner and more easy to implement than a complicated\
    \ model like the\n   one outlined in [4].\n   The models for policy based routing\
    \ emphasize that careful\n   engineering of the Internet needs to decided upon\
    \ the profile of\n   traffic during normal times, outage periods, and peak loads.\
    \  This\n   type of engineering is not a new requirement.  However, there could\n\
    \   potentially be a significant benefit in deciding these policies ahead\n  \
    \ of time and using policy based routing to implement specific routing\n   policies.\n"
- title: 8. Accounting vs. Policy Based Routing
  contents:
  - "8. Accounting vs. Policy Based Routing\n   Quite often Accounting and Policy\
    \ Based Routing are discussed\n   together.  While the application of both Accounting\
    \ and Policy Based\n   Routing is to control access to scarce network resources,\
    \ these are\n   separate (but related) issues.\n   The chief difference between\
    \ Accounting and Policy Based Routing is\n   that Accounting combines history\
    \ information with policy information\n   to track network usage for various purposes.\
    \  Accounting information\n   may in turn drive policy mechanisms (for instance,\
    \ one could imagine\n   a policy limiting a certain organization to a fixed aggregate\n\
    \   percentage of dynamically shared bandwidth).  Conversely, policy\n   information\
    \ may affect accounting issues.  Network accounting\n   typically involves route\
    \ information (at any level from AD to end\n   system) and volume information\
    \ (packet, octet counts).\n   Accounting may be implemented in conjunction with\
    \ any of the policy\n   models mentioned above.  Similar to the microscopic versus\n\
    \   macroscopic policies, accounting may be classified into different\n   levels.\
    \  One may collect accounting data at the AD level, network\n   level, host level,\
    \ or even at the individual user level.  However,\n   since accounting may be\
    \ organized hierarchically, microscopic\n   accounting may be supported at the\
    \ network or host level, while\n   macroscopic accounting may be supported at\
    \ the network or AD level.\n   An example might be the amount of traffic passed\
    \ at the interface\n   between the NSFNET and a mid-level network or between a\
    \ mid-level\n   network and a campus.  Furthermore, the NSFNET has facilities\n\
    \   implemented to allow for accounting of traffic trends from individual\n  \
    \ network numbers as well as application-specific information.\n   Full-blown\
    \ accounting schemes suffer the same types of concerns\n   previously discussed,\
    \ with the added complication of potentially\n   large amounts of additional data\
    \ gathered that must be reliably\n   retrieved.  As pointed out in [4], policy\
    \ issues may impact the way\n   accounting data is collected (one administration\
    \ billing for packets\n   that were then dropped in the network of another administration).\n\
    \   Microscopic accounting may not scale well in a large internet.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ from the standpoint of billing, it is not clear that the\n   services provided\
    \ at the network layer map well to the sorts of\n   services that network consumers\
    \ are willing to pay for.  In the\n   telephone network (as well as public data\
    \ networks), users pay for\n   end-to-end service and expect good quality service\
    \ in terms of error\n   rate and delay (and may be unwilling to pay for service\
    \ that is\n   viewed as unacceptable).  In an internetworking environment, the\n\
    \   heterogeneous administrative environment combined with the lack of\n   end-to-end\
    \ control may make this approach infeasible.\n   Lightweight approaches to accounting\
    \ can be used (with less impact)\n   when specific, limited goals are set.  One\
    \ suggested approach\n   involves monitoring traffic patterns.  If a pattern of\
    \ abuse (e.g.,\n   unauthorized use) develops, an accounting system could track\
    \ this and\n   allow corrective action to be taken, by changing routing policy\
    \ or\n   imposing access control (blocking hosts or nets).  Note that this is\n\
    \   much less intrusive into the packet forwarding aspects of the\n   routers,\
    \ but requires distribution of a policy database that the\n   accounting system\
    \ can use to reduce the raw information.  Because\n   this approach is statistical\
    \ in nature, it may be slow to react.\n"
