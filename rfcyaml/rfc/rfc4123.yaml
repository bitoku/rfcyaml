  - "2.  Definitions\n   H.323 gatekeeper (GK): An H.323 gatekeeper is an optional\
    \ component\n      in an H.323 network.  If it is present, it performs address\n\
    \      translation, bandwidth control, admission control, and zone\n      management.\n\
    \   H.323 network: In this document, we refer to the collection of all\n     \
    \ H.323-speaking components as the H.323 network.\n   SIP network: In this document,\
    \ we refer to the collection of all SIP\n      servers and user agents as the\
    \ SIP network.\n   Interworking Function (IWF): This function performs interworking\n\
    \      between H.323 and SIP.  It belongs to both the H.323 and SIP\n      networks.\n\
    \   SIP server: A SIP server can be a SIP proxy, redirect server, or\n      registrar\

    \ (MSF): This is an optional logical entity\n      within the IWF.  The MSF switches\
    \ media such as voice, video, or\n      fax from one network association to another.\n"
- title: 3.  Functionality within the SIP-H.323 IWF
  contents:
  - "3.  Functionality within the SIP-H.323 IWF\n   This section summarizes the functional\
    \ requirements of the SIP-H.323\n   interworking function (IWF).\n   A SIP-H.323\
    \ IWF may be integrated into an H.323 gatekeeper or SIP\n   server.  Interworking\
    \ should not require any optional components in\n   either the SIP or H.323 network,\
    \ such as H.323 gatekeepers.  IWF\n   redundancy in the network is beyond the\
    \ scope of this document.\n   An IWF contains functions from the following list,\
    \ inter alia:\n   o  Mapping of the call setup and teardown sequences;\n   o \
    \ Registering H.323 and SIP endpoints with SIP registrars and H.323\n      gatekeepers;\n\
    \   o  Resolving H.323 and SIP addresses;\n   o  Maintaining the H.323 and SIP\
    \ state machines;\n   o  Negotiating terminal capabilities;\n   o  Opening and\
    \ closing media channels;\n   o  Mapping media-coding algorithms for H.323 and\
    \ SIP networks;\n   o  Reserving and releasing call-related resources;\n   o \
    \ Processing of mid-call signaling messages;\n   o  Handling of services and features.\n\
    \   The IWF should not process media.  We assume that the same media\n   transport\
    \ protocols, such as RTP, are used in both the SIP and H.323\n   networks.  Thus,\
    \ media packets are exchanged directly between the\n   endpoints.  If a particular\
    \ service requires the IWF to handle media,\n   we assume that the IWF simply\
    \ forwards media packets without\n   modification from one network to the other,\
    \ using a media-switching\n   fabric (MSF).  The conversion of media from one\
    \ encoding or format to\n   another is out of scope for SIP-H.323 protocol translation.\n"
- title: 4.  Pre-Call Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Pre-Call Requirements\n   The IWF function may use a translation table to\
    \ resolve the H.323 and\n   SIP addresses to IP addresses.  This translation table\
    \ can be updated\n   by using an H.323 gatekeeper, a SIP proxy server, or a locally-\n\
    \   maintained database.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Registration with H.323 Gatekeeper
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Registration with H.323 Gatekeeper\n   An IWF may provide and update the\
    \ H.323 gatekeeper with the addresses\n   of SIP UAs.  A SIP user agent can make\
    \ itself known to the H.323\n   network by registering with an IWF serving as\
    \ a registrar.  The IWF\n   creates an H.323 alias address and registers this\
    \ alias, together\n   with its own network address, with the appropriate GK.\n\
    \   The gatekeeper can then use this information to route calls to SIP\n   UAs\
    \ via the IWF, without being aware that the endpoint is not a\n   \"native\" H.323\
    \ endpoint.\n   The IWF can register SIP UAs with one or more H.323 gatekeepers.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Registration with SIP Server
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Registration with SIP Server\n   The IWF can provide information about\
    \ H.323 endpoints to a SIP\n   registrar.  This allows the SIP proxy using this\
    \ SIP registrar to\n   direct calls to the H.323 endpoints via the IWF.\n   The\
    \ IWF can easily obtain information about H.323 endpoints if it\n   also serves\
    \ as a gatekeeper.  Other architectures require further\n   study.\n   If the\
    \ H.323 endpoints are known through E.164 (telephone number)\n   addresses, the\
    \ IWF can use IGREP [TGREP] or SLP [GWLOC] to inform the\n   SIP proxy server\
    \ of these endpoints.\n   The IWF only needs to register with multiple SIP registrars\
    \ if the\n   H.323 terminal is to appear under multiple, different addresses-of-\n\
    \   record.\n"
- title: 5.  General Interworking Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  General Interworking Requirements\n   The IWF should use H.323 Version 2\
    \ or later and SIP according to RFC\n   3261 [RFC3261].  The protocol translation\
    \ function must not require\n   modifications or additions to either H.323 or\
    \ SIP.  However, it may\n   not be possible to support certain features of each\
    \ protocol across\n   the IWF.\n"

- title: 5.1.1.  General Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  General Requirements\n   The IWF should provide default settings for\
    \ translation parameters.\n   The IWF specification must identify these defaults.\n\
    \   The IWF must release any call-related resource at the end of a call.\n   SIP\
    \ session timers [RFC4028] may be used on the SIP side.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Address Resolution
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Address Resolution\n   The IWF should support all the addressing schemes\
    \ in H.323, including\n   the H.323 URI [RFC3508], and the \"sip\", \"sips\",\
    \ and \"tel\" URI schemes\n   in SIP.  It should support the DNS-based SIP server\
    \ location\n   mechanisms described in [RFC3263] and H.323 Annex O, which details\n\
    \   how H.323 uses DNS and, in particular, DNS SRV records.\n   The IWF should\
    \ register with the H.323 Gatekeeper and the SIP\n   registrar when available.\n\
    \   The IWF may use any means to translate between SIP and H.323\n   addresses.\
    \  Examples include translation tables populated by the\n   gatekeeper, SIP registrar\
    \ or other database, LDAP, DNS or TRIP.\n"
- title: 5.1.3.  Call with H.323 Gatekeeper
  contents:
  - "5.1.3.  Call with H.323 Gatekeeper\n   When an H.323 GK is present in the network,\
    \ the IWF should resolve\n   addresses with the help of the GK.\n"
- title: 5.1.4.  Call with SIP Registrar
  contents:
  - "5.1.4.  Call with SIP Registrar\n   The IWF applies normal SIP call routing and\
    \ does not need to be aware\n   whether there is a proxy server.\n"
- title: 5.1.5.  Capability Negotiation
  contents:
  - "5.1.5.  Capability Negotiation\n   The IWF should not make any assumptions about\
    \ the capabilities of\n   either the SIP user agent or the H.323 terminal.  However,\
    \ it may\n   indicate a guaranteed-to-be-supported list of codecs of the H.323\n\
    \   terminal or SIP user agent before exchanging capabilities with H.323\n   (using\
    \ H.245) and SIP (using SDP [RFC2327]).  H.323 defines mandatory\n   capabilities,\
    \ whereas SIP currently does not.  For example, the G.711\n   audio codec is mandatory\
    \ for higher bandwidth H.323 networks.\n   The IWF should attempt to map the capability\
    \ descriptors of H.323 and\n   SDP in the best possible fashion.  The algorithm\
    \ for finding the best\n   mapping between H.245 capability descriptors and the\
    \ corresponding\n   SDP is left for further study.\n   The IWF should be able\
    \ to map the common audio, video, and\n   application format names supported in\
    \ H.323 to and from the\n   equivalent RTP/AVP [RFC3550] names.\n   The IWF may\
    \ use the SIP OPTIONS message to derive SIP UA\n   capabilities.  It may support\
    \ mid-call renegotiation of media\n   capabilities.\n"
- title: 5.1.6.  Opening of Logical Channels
  contents:
  - "5.1.6.  Opening of Logical Channels\n   The IWF should support the seamless exchange\
    \ of messages for opening,\n   reopening, changing, and closing of media channels\
    \ during a call.\n   The procedures for opening, reopening, closing, and changing\
    \ the\n   existing media sessions during a call are for further study.\n   The\
    \ IWF should open media channels between the endpoints whenever\n   possible.\
    \  If this is not possible, then the channel can be opened at\n   the MSF of the\
    \ IWF.\n   The IWF should support unidirectional, symmetric bi-directional, and\n\
    \   asymmetric bi-directional opening of channels.\n   The IWF may respond to\
    \ the mode request and to the request for\n   reopening and changing an existing\
    \ logical channel and may support\n   the flow control mechanism in H.323.\n"
- title: 5.2.  IWF H.323 Features
  contents:
  - "5.2.  IWF H.323 Features\n   The IWF should support Fast Connect; i.e., H.245\
    \ tunneling in H.323\n   Setup messages.  If IWF and GK are the same device, pre-granted\
    \ ARQ\n   should be supported.  If pre-granted ARQ is supported, the IWF may\n\
    \   perform the address resolution from H.323 GK using the LRQ/LCF\n   exchange.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Overlapped Sending
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Overlapped Sending\n   An IWF should follow the recommendations outlined\
    \ in [RFC3578] when\n   receiving overlapped digits from the H.323 side.  If the\
    \ IWF receives\n   overlapped dialed digits from the SIP network, it may use the\
    \ Q.931\n   Setup, Setup Ack, and Information Message in H.323.\n   The IWF may\
    \ support the transfer of digits during a call by using the\n   appropriate SIP\
    \ mechanism and UserInputIndication in H.245 (H.323).\n"
- title: 5.3.1.  DTMF Support
  contents:
  - "5.3.1.  DTMF Support\n   An IWF should support the mapping between DTMF and possibly\
    \ other\n   telephony tones carried in signaling messages.\n"
- title: 6.  Transport
  contents:
  - "6.  Transport\n   The H.323 and SIP systems do not have to be in close proximity.\
    \  The\n   IP networks hosting the H.323 and SIP systems do not need to assure\n\
    \   quality of service (QoS).  In particular, the IWF should not assume\n   that\
    \ signaling messages have priority over packets from other\n   applications. \
    \ H.323 signaling over UDP (H.323 Annex E) is optional.\n"

- title: 7.1.  General Requirements
  contents:
  - "7.1.  General Requirements\n   o  The call message sequence of both protocols\
    \ must be maintained.\n   o  The IWF must not set up or tear down calls on its\

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Because the IWF whose requirements have been\
    \ described in this\n   document combines both SIP and H.323 functionality, security\n\
    \   considerations for both of these protocols apply.\n   The eventual security\
    \ solution for interworking must rely on the\n   standard mechanisms in RFC3261\
    \ [RFC3261] and H.323, without extending\n   them for the interworking function.\
    \  Signaling security for H.323 is\n   described in H.235 [H.235].\n   Because\
    \ all data elements in SIP or H.323 have to terminate at the\n   IWF, the resulting\
    \ security cannot be expected to be end-to-end.\n   Thus, the IWF terminates not\
    \ only the signalling protocols but also\n   the security in each domain.  Therefore,\
    \ users at the SIP or H.323\n   endpoint have to trust the IWF, like they would\
    \ any other gateway, to\n   authenticate the other side correctly.  Similarly,\
    \ they have to trust\n   the gateway to respect the integrity of data elements\
    \ and to apply\n   appropriate security mechanisms on the other side of the IWF.\n\
    \   The IWF must not indicate the identity of a user on one side without\n   first\
    \ performing authentication.  For example, if the SIP user was\n   not authenticated,\
    \ it would be inappropriate to use mechanisms on the\n   H.323 side, such as H.323\
    \ Annex D, to indicate that the user identity\n   had been authenticated.\n  \
    \ An IWF must not accept 'sips' requests unless it can guarantee that\n   the\
    \ H.323 side uses equivalent H.235 [H.235] security mechanisms.\n   Similarly,\
    \ the IWF must not accept H.235 sessions unless it succeeds\n   in using SIP-over-TLS\
    \ (sips) on the SIP side of the IWF.\n"
