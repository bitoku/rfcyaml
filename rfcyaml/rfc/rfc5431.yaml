- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document summarizes the use of Diameter codes in a\
    \ newly defined\n   realization of a specification for authorizing network QoS\
    \ resources\n   and policy enforcement [Q.3303.3].  A new pair of Command Codes\
    \ have\n   been assigned by IANA.  This document summarizes the uses of newly\n\
    \   defined Diameter codes (Command Codes, AVP, vendor-specific\n   application\
    \ id).  When combined with the Diameter Base protocol, this\n   application's\
    \ specification [Q.3303.3] satisfies the requirements of\n   [Y.2111] of the International\
    \ Telecommunication Union -\n   Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)\
    \ to send a request\n   and receive a response for controlling the policy enforcement.\n\
    \   The Diameter realization of this application assumes the use of the\n   Diameter\
    \ Base protocol, as per RFC 3588, and extends it only for a\n   specific application\
    \ using a vendor-id (ITU-T), a vendor-specific\n   application ID (16777256),\
    \ a new Command Code (315), and new\n   attribute-value pairs (AVPs), which are\
    \ defined in the vendor-\n   specific namespace.\n   This application is used\
    \ to authorize network QoS resources and\n   policy enforcement (including the\
    \ amount of bandwidth, QoS class, and\n   traffic flow processing) as an extension\
    \ of the Diameter application\n   [RFC4006].  The request is based on the Diameter\
    \ extensibility\n   discussions in the DIME WG that led to the conclusion that\
    \ it is\n   better to define new Command Codes whenever the ABNF of a command\
    \ is\n   modified by adding, removing, or semantically changing a required AVP\n\
    \   in order to avoid interoperability problems.  The document is\n   utilizing\
    \ authorization and accounting functionality, and the entire\n   exchange is related\
    \ to users utilizing applications that require QoS\n   treatment.  This approach\
    \ is consistent with the practice and\n   experience gained since the publication\
    \ of [RFC3588] (see for example\n   [RFC5224]), which is now under revision by\
    \ the DIME Working Group who\n   will provide a revised set of recommendations\
    \ and procedures for IANA\n   considerations [DIME].\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   In the base Diameter specification [RFC3588], Section 1.4\
    \ defines\n   most of the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the\n\
    \   terms and acronyms defined in Section 3 and Section 4 of [Q.3303.3]\n   are\
    \ used in this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Diameter ITU-T Rw Policy Enforcement Interface
  contents:
  - "3.  Diameter ITU-T Rw Policy Enforcement Interface\n   The Rw interface is used\
    \ for information exchange to apply policy\n   decisions between the Policy Decision\
    \ Point (PDP, i.e., in the ITU-T\n   term, Policy Decision Functional Entity (PD-FE))\
    \ and the Policy\n   Enforcement Point (PEP, i.e., in the ITU-T term, Policy Enforcement\n\
    \   Functional Entity (PE-FE)).\n   The interface allows the PDP to push the authorized\
    \ admission\n   decisions to the PEP.  It also allows the PEP to request the\n\
    \   authorization of admission decisions from the PDP when path-coupled\n   resource\
    \ reservation mechanisms are in use.  The main information\n   conveyed by the\
    \ Rw interface is:\n   o  Resources reservation and/or allocation requests for\
    \ media flows;\n   o  QoS handling requests such as packet marking and policing;\n\
    \   o  Gate control (opening/closing) requests for a media flow;\n   o  NAPT and\
    \ NAT traversal requests for the necessary address mapping\n      information;\n\
    \   o  Resource usage information requests and reports for media flows.\n   The\
    \ detailed descriptions of the Diameter Policy Enforcement\n   interface ITU-T\
    \ Rw can be found in Section 5 of [Q.3303.3].\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers\n   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the\n\
    \   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].\n   This document\
    \ defines values in the namespaces that have been created\n   and defined in [RFC3588].\
    \  The IANA Considerations section of that\n   document details the assignment\
    \ criteria.  Values assigned in this\n   document, or by future IANA action, must\
    \ be coordinated within this\n   shared namespace.\n"
