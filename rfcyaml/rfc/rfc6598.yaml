  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPv4 address space is nearly exhausted.  However, ISPs must\
    \ continue\n   to support IPv4 growth until IPv6 is fully deployed.  To that end,\n\
    \   many ISPs will deploy a Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) device, such as that\n   described\
    \ in [RFC6264].  Because CGNs are used on networks where\n   public address space\
    \ is expected, and currently available private\n   address space causes operational\
    \ issues when used in this context,\n   ISPs require a new IPv4 /10 address block.\
    \  This address block will\n   be called the \"Shared Address Space\" and will\
    \ be used to number the\n   interfaces that connect CGN devices to Customer Premises\
    \ Equipment\n   (CPE).\n   Shared Address Space is similar to [RFC1918] private\
    \ address space in\n   that it is not globally routable address space and can\
    \ be used by\n   multiple pieces of equipment.  However, Shared Address Space\
    \ has\n   limitations in its use that the current [RFC1918] private address\n\
    \   space does not have.  In particular, Shared Address Space can only be\n  \
    \ used in Service Provider networks or on routing equipment that is\n   able to\
    \ do address translation across router interfaces when the\n   addresses are identical\
    \ on two different interfaces.\n   This document requests the allocation of an\
    \ IPv4 /10 address block to\n   be used as Shared Address Space.  In conversations\
    \ with many ISPs, a\n   /10 is the smallest block that will allow them to deploy\
    \ CGNs on a\n   regional basis without requiring nested CGNs.  For instance, as\n\
    \   described in [ISP-SHARED-ADDR], a /10 is sufficient to service Points\n  \
    \ of Presence in the Tokyo area.\n   This document details the allocation of an\
    \ additional special-use\n   IPv4 address block and updates [RFC5735].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Alternatives to Shared Address Space
  contents:
  - "3.  Alternatives to Shared Address Space\n   The interfaces that connect CGN\
    \ devices to CPE might conceivably be\n   numbered from any of the following address\
    \ spaces:\n   o  legitimately assigned globally unique address space\n   o  usurped\
    \ globally unique address space (i.e., squat space)\n   o  [RFC1918] space\n \
    \  o  Shared Address Space\n   A Service Provider can number the interfaces in\
    \ question from\n   legitimately assigned globally unique address space.  While\
    \ this\n   solution poses the fewest problems, it is impractical because\n   globally\
    \ unique IPv4 address space is in short supply.  While the\n   Regional Internet\
    \ Registries (RIRs) have enough address space to\n   allocate a single /10 to\
    \ be shared by all Service Providers, they do\n   not have enough address space\
    \ to make a unique assignment to each\n   Service Provider.\n   Service Providers\
    \ MUST NOT number the interfaces in question from\n   usurped globally unique\
    \ address space (i.e., squat space).  If a\n   Service Provider leaks advertisements\
    \ for squat space into the global\n   Internet, the legitimate holders of that\
    \ address space may be\n   adversely impacted, as would those wishing to communicate\
    \ with them.\n   Even if the Service Provider did not leak advertisements for\
    \ squat\n   space, the Service Provider and its subscribers might lose\n   connectivity\
    \ to the legitimate holders of that address space.\n   A Service Provider can\
    \ number the interfaces in question from\n   [RFC1918] space if at least one of\
    \ the following conditions is true:\n   o  The Service Provider knows that the\
    \ CPE/NAT works correctly when\n      the same [RFC1918] address block is used\
    \ on both its inside and\n      outside interfaces.\n   o  The Service Provider\
    \ knows that the [RFC1918] address block that\n      it uses to number interfaces\
    \ between the CGN and CPE is not used\n      on the subscriber side of the CPE.\n\
    \   Unless at least one of the conditions above is true, the Service\n   Provider\
    \ cannot safely use [RFC1918] address space and must resort to\n   Shared Address\
    \ Space.  This is typically the case in an unmanaged\n   service, where subscribers\
    \ provide their own CPE and number their own\n   internal network.\n"
- title: 4.  Use of Shared CGN Space
  contents:
  - "4.  Use of Shared CGN Space\n   Shared Address Space is IPv4 address space designated\
    \ for Service\n   Provider use with the purpose of facilitating CGN deployment.\
    \  Also,\n   Shared Address Space can be used as additional non-globally routable\n\
    \   space on routing equipment that is able to do address translation\n   across\
    \ router interfaces when the addresses are identical on two\n   different interfaces.\n\
    \   Devices MUST be capable of performing address translation when\n   identical\
    \ Shared Address Space ranges are used on two different\n   interfaces.\n   Packets\
    \ with Shared Address Space source or destination addresses\n   MUST NOT be forwarded\
    \ across Service Provider boundaries.  Service\n   Providers MUST filter such\
    \ packets on ingress links.  One exception\n   to this paragraph's proscription\
    \ is in the case of business\n   relationships, such as hosted CGN services.\n\
    \   When running a single DNS infrastructure, Service Providers MUST NOT\n   include\
    \ Shared Address Space in zone files.  When running a split DNS\n   infrastructure,\
    \ Service Providers MUST NOT include Shared Address\n   Space in external-facing\
    \ zone files.\n   Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space addresses MUST\
    \ NOT be\n   forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure.  DNS Providers SHOULD\n\
    \   filter requests for Shared Address Space reverse DNS queries on\n   recursive\
    \ nameservers.  This is done to avoid having to set up\n   something similar to\
    \ AS112.net for [RFC1918] private address space\n   that a host has incorrectly\
    \ sent for a DNS that reverse-maps queries\n   on the public Internet [RFC6304].\n\
    \   Because CGN service requires non-overlapping address space on each\n   side\
    \ of the home NAT and CGN, entities using Shared Address Space for\n   purposes\
    \ other than for CGN service, as described in this document,\n   are likely to\
    \ experience problems implementing or connecting to CGN\n   service at such time\
    \ as they exhaust their supply of public IPv4\n   addresses.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Analysis
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Analysis\n   Some existing applications discover the outside address of\
    \ their\n   local CPE, determine whether the address is reserved for special use,\n\
    \   and behave differently based on that determination.  If a new IPv4\n   address\
    \ block is reserved for special use and that block is used to\n   number CPE outside\
    \ interfaces, some of the above-mentioned\n   applications may fail.\n   For example,\
    \ assume that an application requires its peer (or some\n   other device) to initiate\
    \ an incoming connection directly with its\n   CPE's outside address.  That application\
    \ discovers the outside\n   address of its CPE and determines whether that address\
    \ is reserved\n   for special use.  If the address is reserved for special use,\
    \ the\n   application rightly concludes that the address is not reachable from\n\
    \   the global Internet and behaves in one manner.  If the address is not\n  \
    \ reserved for special use, the application assumes that the address is\n   reachable\
    \ from the global Internet and behaves in another manner.\n   While the assumption\
    \ that a non-special-use address is reachable from\n   the global Internet is\
    \ generally safe, it is not always true (e.g.,\n   when the CPE outside interface\
    \ is numbered from globally unique\n   address space but that address is not advertised\
    \ to the global\n   Internet as when it is behind a CGN).  Such an assumption\
    \ could cause\n   certain applications to behave incorrectly in those cases.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Empirical Data
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Empirical Data\n   The primary motivation for the allocation of Shared\
    \ Address Space is\n   as address space for CGNs; the use and impact of CGNs has\
    \ been\n   previously described in [RFC6269] and [NAT444-IMPACTS].  Some of the\n\
    \   services adversely impacted by CGNs are as follows:\n   1.  Console gaming\
    \ -- some games fail when two subscribers using the\n       same outside public\
    \ IPv4 address try to connect to each other.\n   2.  Video streaming -- performance\
    \ is impacted when using one of\n       several popular video-streaming technologies\
    \ to deliver multiple\n       video streams to users behind particular CPE routers.\n\
    \   3.  Peer-to-peer -- some peer-to-peer applications cannot seed\n       content\
    \ due to the inability to open incoming ports through the\n       CGN.  Likewise,\
    \ some SIP client implementations cannot receive\n       incoming calls unless\
    \ they first initiate outgoing traffic or\n       open an incoming port through\
    \ the CGN using the Port Control\n       Protocol (PCP) [PCP-BASE] or a similar\
    \ mechanism.\n   4.  Geo-location -- geo-location systems identify the location\
    \ of the\n       CGN server, not the end host.\n   5.  Simultaneous logins --\
    \ some websites (particularly banking and\n       social-networking websites)\
    \ restrict the number of simultaneous\n       logins per outside public IPv4 address.\n\
    \   6.  6to4 -- 6to4 requires globally reachable addresses and will not\n    \
    \   work in networks that employ addresses with limited topological\n       span,\
    \ such as those employing CGNs.\n   Based on testing documented in [NAT444-IMPACTS],\
    \ the CGN impacts on\n   items 1-5 above are comparable regardless of whether\
    \ globally unique,\n   Shared Address Space, or [RFC1918] addresses are used.\
    \  There is,\n   however, a difference between the three alternatives in the treatment\n\
    \   of 6to4.\n   As described in [RFC6343], CPE routers do not attempt to initialize\n\
    \   6to4 tunnels when they are configured with [RFC1918] or [RFC5735] WAN\n  \
    \ addresses.  When configured with globally unique or Shared Address\n   Space\
    \ addresses, such devices may attempt to initiate 6to4, which\n   would fail.\
    \  Service Providers can mitigate this issue using 6to4\n   Provider Managed Tunnels\
    \ [6to4-PMT] or blocking the route to\n   192.88.99.1 and generating an IPv4 'destination\
    \ unreachable' message\n   [RFC6343].  When the address range is well-defined,\
    \ as with Shared\n   Address Space, CPE router vendors can include Shared Address\
    \ Space in\n   their list of special-use addresses (e.g., [RFC5735]) and treat\n\
    \   Shared Address Space similarly to [RFC1918] space.  When the CGN-CPE\n   address\
    \ range is not well-defined, as in the case of globally unique\n   space, it will\
    \ be more difficult for CPE router vendors to mitigate\n   this issue.\n   Thus,\
    \ when comparing the use of [RFC1918] and Shared Address Space,\n   Shared Address\
    \ Space poses an additional impact on 6to4 connectivity,\n   which can be mitigated\
    \ by Service Provider or CPE router vendor\n   action.  On the other hand, the\
    \ use of [RFC1918] address space poses\n   more of a challenge vis-a-vis Shared\
    \ Address Space when the\n   subscriber and Service Provider use overlapping [RFC1918]\
    \ space,\n   which will be outside the Service Provider's control in the case\
    \ of\n   unmanaged service.  Service Providers have indicated that it is more\n\
    \   challenging to mitigate the possibility of overlapping [RFC1918]\n   address\
    \ space on both sides of the CPE router than it is to mitigate\n   the 6to4 impacts\
    \ of Shared Address Space.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Similar to other [RFC5735] special-use IPv4 addresses,\
    \ Shared Address\n   Space does not directly raise security issues.  However,\
    \ the Internet\n   does not inherently protect against abuse of these addresses.\n\
    \   Attacks have been mounted that depend on the unexpected use of\n   similar\
    \ special-use addresses.  Network operators are encouraged to\n   review this\
    \ document and determine what security policies should be\n   associated with\
    \ this address block within their specific operating\n   environments.  They should\
    \ consider including Shared Address Space in\n   Ingress Filter lists [RFC3704],\
    \ unless their Internet service\n   incorporates a CGN.\n   To mitigate potential\
    \ misuse of Shared Address Space, except where\n   required for hosted CGN service\
    \ or a similar business relationship,\n   o  routing information about Shared\
    \ Address Space networks MUST NOT\n      be propagated across Service Provider\
    \ boundaries.  Service\n      Providers MUST filter incoming advertisements regarding\
    \ Shared\n      Address Space.\n   o  packets with Shared Address Space source\
    \ or destination addresses\n      MUST NOT be forwarded across Service Provider\
    \ boundaries.  Service\n      Providers MUST filter such packets on ingress links.\n\
    \   o  Service Providers MUST NOT include Shared Address Space in\n      external-facing\
    \ DNS zone files.\n   o  reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space addresses\
    \ MUST NOT be\n      forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure.\n   o  DNS Providers\
    \ SHOULD filter requests for Shared Address Space\n      reverse DNS queries on\
    \ recursive nameservers.\n"
