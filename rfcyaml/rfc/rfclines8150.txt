In particular, it defines objects for managing Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS TP) linear protection.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.
In particular, it defines objects for managing Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS TP) linear protection.
This MIB module should be used for configuring and managing MPLS TP linear protection for MPLS TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs).
At the time of this writing, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) SET is no longer recommended as a way to configure MPLS networks as described in RFC 3812 [RFC3812].
However, since the MIB module specified in this document is intended to work in parallel with the MIB module for MPLS
specified in [RFC3812] and the MIB module for MPLS TP Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) identifiers in RFC 7697
[RFC7697], certain objects defined here are specified with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write or read create so that specifications of the base tables in [RFC3812] and [RFC7697] and the new MIB module in this document are consistent.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
[RFC6378] defines the protocol to provide a linear protection switching mechanism for MPLS TP for a point to point LSP within the protection domain bounded by the endpoints of the LSP.
[RFC7271] describes alternative mechanisms to perform some of the functions defined in [RFC6378] and also defines additional mechanisms to provide operator control and experience that more closely model the behavior of linear protection seen in other transport networks.
Two modes are defined for MPLS TP linear protection switching: the Protection State Coordination (PSC) mode and the Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mode, as specified in [RFC6378] and [RFC7271], respectively.
The detailed protocol specification of MPLS TP linear protection is described in [RFC6378] and [RFC7271].
This document specifies a MIB module for Label Edge Routers (LERs) that support MPLS TP linear protection as described in [RFC6378] and [RFC7271].
Objects defined in this document are generally applied to both the PSC mode and the APS mode.
If an object is valid for a particular mode only, it is noted in the description for the object.
Structure of the MIB Module 5.1.
The following new textual conventions are defined in this document:
MplsLpsReq: This textual convention describes an object that stores the PSC Request field of the PSC control packet.
MplsLpsFpathPath: This textual convention describes an object that stores the Fault Path (FPath) field and Data Path (Path) field of the PSC control packet.
MplsLpsCommand: This textual convention describes an object that allows a user to perform any action over a protection domain.
MplsLpsState: This textual convention describes an object that stores the current state of the PSC state machine.
The MPLS TP Linear Protection Switching Subtree MPLS LPS MIB is the MIB module defined in this document.
It is rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree per [RFC3811].
"LPS" as used in this document means "Linear Protection Switching".
The Notifications Subtree Notifications are defined to inform the management station about switchovers, provisioning mismatches, and protocol failures of the linear protection domain.
The following notifications are defined for this purpose:
The notification mplsLpsEventSwitchover informs the management station about the switchover of the active path.
The notification mplsLpsEventRevertiveMismatch informs the management station about a provisioning mismatch in the revertive mode across the endpoint of the protection domain.
The notification mplsLpsEventProtecTypeMismatch informs the management station about a provisioning mismatch in the protection type, representing both the bridge type and the switching type, across the endpoint of the protection domain.
The notification mplsLpsEventCapabilitiesMismatch informs the management station about a provisioning mismatch in Capabilities TLVs across the endpoint of the protection domain.
The notification mplsLpsEventPathConfigMismatch informs the management station about a provisioning mismatch in the protection path configuration for PSC communication.
The notification mplsLpsEventFopNoResponse informs the management station that protocol failure has occurred due to a lack of response to a traffic switchover request in 50 ms.
The notification mplsLpsEventFopTimeout informs the management station that protocol failure has occurred because no protocol message was received during at least 3.5 times the long PSC message interval [RFC7271].
The MPLS TP linear protection MIB module has four tables.
The tables are as follows:
This table is used to configure MPLS TP linear protection domains.
An MPLS TP linear protection domain (or a protection domain) is identified by mplsLpsConfigDomainIndex.
A protection domain consists of two LERs, as well as the working path and protection path that connect the two LERs.
The objects in this table are used to configure properties that are specific to the protection domain.
Two Maintenance Entities (MEs) MUST be defined for each protection domain: one for the working path and the other for the protection path.
Therefore, two entries in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable, which is for configuring the MEs used in protection switching, are associated to one entry in this table.
This table provides the current status information of MPLS TP linear protection domains that have been configured on the system.
The entries in the mplsLpsStatusTable have an AUGMENTS relationship with the entries in the mplsLpsConfigTable.
When a protection domain is configured or deleted in the mplsLpsConfigTable, then the corresponding row of that session in the mplsLpsStatusTable is automatically created or deleted, respectively.
This table is used to associate MEs to the protection domain.
Each protection domain requires two MEs.
One entry in the mplsLpsConfigTable is associated with two entries in this table: one for the working path and the other for the protection path of the protection domain.
The mplsLpsMeConfigPath object in this table indicates that the path is either the working path or the protection path.
The ME is identified by mplsOamIdMegIndex, mplsOamIdMeIndex, and mplsOamIdMeMpIndex, which are the same index values as the entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable defined in [RFC7697].
The relationship to the mplsOamIdMeTable is described in Section 6.1.
This table provides current information about the protection status of MEs that have been configured on the system.
When an ME is configured or deleted in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable, then the corresponding row of that session in the mplsLpsMeStatusTable is automatically created or deleted, respectively.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules 6.1.
Relationship to the MPLS OAM Identifiers
MIB Module Entries in the mplsOamIdMeTable [RFC7697] are extended by entries in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable.
Note that the nature of the "extends" relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable has the same index values as the entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable.
Each time that an entry is created in the mplsOamIdMeTable for which the LER supports MPLS TP linear protection, a row is created automatically in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable.
When a point to point transport path needs to be monitored, one ME is needed for the path and one entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable will be created.
But the ME entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable may or may not participate in protection switching.
If an ME participates in protection switching, an entry in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable MUST be created, and the objects in the entry indicate which protection domain this ME belongs to and whether this ME is for the working path or the protection path.
If the ME does not participate in protection switching, an entry in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable does not need to be created.
Example of Protection Switching Configuration
This example considers the protection domain configuration on an LER to provide protection for a co routed bidirectional MPLS tunnel.
For the working path and protection path of the protection domain, two Maintenance Entity Groups (MEGs) need to be configured, and each MEG contains one ME for a point to point transport path.
For more information on the mplsOamIdMegTable and the mplsOamIdMeTable, see [RFC7697].
Although the example described in this section shows a way to configure linear protection for MPLS TP tunnels, this also indicates how the MIB values would be returned if they had been configured by alternative means.
The following table configures a protection domain.
mplsLpsConfigDomainIndex    3,   Protection domain name mplsLpsConfigDomainName
} The following table associates the MEs with the protection domain.

If this value is changed at one LER during operation, the LER will generate PSC packets with a new Capabilities TLV value.
This will result in mplsLpsEventCapabilitiesMismatch notifications at both LERs."
OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX INTEGER { onePlusOneUnidirectional(1), oneColonOneBidirectional(2), onePlusOneBidirectional(3) }
"The protection architecture type of the protection domain.
This object represents both the bridge type, which can be either a permanent bridge (1 1) or a selector bridge (1:1); and the switching scheme, which can be either unidirectional or bidirectional.
In the 1 1 protection scheme, a fully dedicated protection path is allocated.
Data traffic is copied and fed at the source to both the working path and the protection path.
The traffic on the working path and protection path is transmitted simultaneously to the sink of the protection domain, where selection between the working path and the protection path is performed.
In the 1:1 protection scheme, a protection path is allocated to protect against a defect, failure, or degradation on the working path.
In normal conditions, data traffic is transmitted over the working path, while the protection path functions in the idle state.
If there is a defect on the working path or a specific administrative request, traffic is switched to the protection path.
In the bidirectional protection scheme, both directions will be switched simultaneously even if the fault applies to only one direction of the path.
In the unidirectional protection scheme, protection switching will be performed independently for each direction of a bidirectional transport path.
This object may not be modified if the associated mplsLpsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"This object represents the reversion mode of the linear protection domain.
The reversion mode of the protection mechanism may be either revertive or non revertive.
nonrevertive In the non revertive mode, after a service has been recovered, traffic will be forwarded on the protection path.
In the revertive mode, after a service has been recovered, traffic will be redirected back onto the original working path.
This object may not be modified if the associated mplsLpsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"This object holds the threshold value of the Signal Degrade (SD) defect in percent.
In order to detect the SD defect, the MPLS TP packet loss measurement (LM) is performed every second.
If either the packet loss is negative (i.e., there are more packets received than transmitted) or the packet loss ratio (lost packets/transmitted packets) in percent is greater than this threshold value, a Bad Second is declared.
Otherwise, a Good Second is declared.
The SD defect is detected if there are mplsLpsConfigSdBadSeconds consecutive Bad Seconds and cleared if there are mplsLpsConfigSdGoodSeconds consecutive Good Seconds.
This object may be modified if the associated mplsLpsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"This object holds the number of Bad Seconds to detect the SD.
If the number of consecutive Bad Seconds reaches this value, the SD defect is detected and used as an input to the protection switching process.
This object may be modified if the associated mplsLpsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"This object holds the number of Good Seconds to declare the clearance of an SD defect.
After an SD defect occurs on a path, if the number of consecutive Good Seconds reaches this value for the degraded path, the clearance of the SD defect is declared and used as an input to the protection switching process.
This object may be modified if the associated mplsLpsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
mplsLpsConfigEntry 8 } mplsLpsConfigWaitToRestore OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"This object holds the Wait to Restore timer value in minutes and can be configured in 1 minute intervals between 5 and 12 minutes.
The WTR timer is used to delay the reversion of the PSC state to the Normal state when recovering from a failure condition on the working path when the protection domain is configured for revertive behavior.
This object may not be modified if the associated mplsLpsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
"The hold off time in deciseconds.
Represents the time between SF/SD condition detection and declaration of an SF/SD request to the protection switching logic.
It is intended to avoid unnecessary switching when a lower layer protection mechanism is in place.
Can be configured in intervals of 100 milliseconds.
When a new defect or a more severe defect occurs on the active path (the path from which the selector selects the user data traffic) and this value is non zero,
the hold off timer will be started.
A defect on the standby path (the path from which the selector does not select the user data traffic) does not trigger the start of the hold off timer, as there is no need for a traffic switchover.
This object may not be modified if the associated mplsLpsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).
Represents the time interval to send the continual PSC packet to the other end, based on the current state.
This object may not be modified if the associated mplsLpsConfigRowStatus object is equal to active(1).

When there is a traffic switchover due to a local request, a 50 ms timer is started to detect protocol failure due to no response.
If there is no PSC message received with the same Path value as the Path value in the transmitted PSC message until the 50 ms timer expires, protocol failure due to no response occurs.
"This object holds the number of occurrences of protocol failure due to no PSC message being received during at least 3.5 times the long PSC message interval.
When no PSC message is received on the protection path during at least 3.5 times the long PSC message interval and there is no defect on the protection path, protocol failure due to no PSC message occurs.

current DESCRIPTION "Collection of objects needed to implement notifications."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The mplsLpsConfigTable is used to configure MPLS TP linear protection domains.
Improper manipulation of the objects in this table may result in different behaviors than what network operators originally intended, such as delaying traffic switching or causing a race condition with server layer protection after network failure (mplsLpsConfigHoldOff), delaying or speeding up reversion after recovering from network failure (mplsLpsConfigWaitToRestore), unexpected traffic switching (mplsLpsConfigCommand), or the discontinuance of the operation of a protection switching control process (mplsLpsConfigMode, mplsLpsConfigProtectionType).
The mplsLpsMeConfigTable is used to assign each ME to either the working path or the protection path.
Improper manipulation of this object may result in the discontinuance of the operation of a protection switching control process.
The notification is controlled by the mplsLpsNotificationEnable object.
In the case of the discontinuance of a protection switching control process, network operators may not be notified if the mplsLpsNotificationEnable object is compromised.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The mplsLpsStatusTable and the mplsLpsMeStatusTable collectively show the history and current status of the MPLS TP linear protection domains.
They can be used to estimate the performance and qualities of networks configured to use MPLS TP linear protection.
If an administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned an OID of decimal 22 for the MPLS Linear Protection MIB module (MPLS LPS MIB) specified in this document in the "MIB Transmission Group MPLS STD MIB" subregistry of the "Internet standard MIB Transmission Group" registry.
