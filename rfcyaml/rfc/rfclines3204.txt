Abstract This document describes MIME types for application/ISUP and application/QSIG objects for use in SIP applications, according to the rules defined in RFC 2048.
These types can be used to identify ISUP and QSIG objects within a SIP message such as INVITE or INFO, as might be implemented when using SIP in an environment where part of the call involves interworking to the PSTN.
Introduction ISUP (ISDN User part) defined in the ITU T recommendations
Q.761 4 is a signaling protocol used between telephony switches.
There are configurations in which ISUP encoded signaling information needs to be transported between SIP entities as part of the payload of SIP messages, where the preservation of ISUP data is necessary for the proper operation of PSTN features.
QSIG is the analogous signaling protocol used between private branch exchanges to support calls within private telephony networks.
There is a similar need to transport QSIG encoded signaling information between SIP entities in some environments.
This document is specific to this usage and would not apply to the transportation of ISUP or QSIG messages in other applications.
These media types are intended for ISUP or QSIG application information that is used within the context of a SIP session, and not as general purpose transport of SCN signaling.
The definition of media types for ISUP and QSIG application information does not address fully how the non SIP and SIP entities exchanging messages determine or negotiate compatibility.
It is assumed that this is addressed by alternative means such as the configuration of the interworking functions.
This is intended to be an IETF approved MIME type, and to be defined through an RFC.
usage of Q.SIG within SIP is neither endorsed nor recommended as a result of this MIME registration.
Proposed new media types ISUP and QSIG messages are composed of arbitrary binary data that is transparent to SIP processing.
The best way to encode these is to use binary encoding.
This is in conformance with the restrictions imposed on the use of binary data for MIME (RFC 2045 [3]).
It should be noted that the rules mentioned in the RFC 2045 apply to Internet mail messages and not to SIP  messages.
Binary has been preferred over Base64 encoding because the latter would only result in adding bulk to the encoded messages and possibly be more costly in terms of processing power.
This media type is defined by the following information:
ISUP Required parameters: version Optional parameters: base Encoding scheme: binary Security considerations: See section 5.
The ISUP message is encapsulated beginning with the Message Type Code (i.e., omitting Routing Label and Circuit ID Code).
The use of the 'version' parameter allows network administrators to identify specific versions of ISUP that will be exchanged on a bilateral basis.
This enables a particular client such as a SoftSwitch/Media Gateway Controller to recognize and parse the message correctly,  or (possibly) to reject the message if the specified ISUP version is not supported.
This specification places no constraints on the values that may be used in 'version'; these are left to the discretion of the network administrator.
This 'version' could, for example, be used to identify a network  specific implementation of ISUP, e.g.,
X NetxProprietaryISUPv3, or to identify a well known standard version of ISUP, e.g., itu t or ansi.
A 'base' parameter can optionally be included in some cases (e.g., if the receiver may not recognize the 'version' string) to specify that the encapsulated ISUP can also be processed using the identified 'base' specification.
Table 1 provides a list of 'base' values supported by the 'application/ISUP' media type, including whether or not the forward compatibility mechanism defined in ITU T
ITU T Q.761 4 (1988)
ITU T Q.761 4 (1992)
yes The Content Disposition header [5] may be included to describe how the encapsulated ISUP is to be processed, and in particular what the handling should be if the received Content Type is not recognized.
The default disposition type for an ISUP message body is "signal".
This type indicates that the body part contains signaling information associated with the session, but does not describe the session.
Supplementing the description of the Content Disposition header in [5], as well as any characterization of the Content Disposition header in the SIP standard, is the following BNF describing disposition types and disposition params that may be used in the header of ISUP and QSIG MIME bodies.
A full definition of the use of the "handling" parameter is given in the IANA Considerations section below.
The following is how a typical header would look ('base' may be omitted):
Content Type: application/ISUP; version nxv3; base etsi121 Content Disposition: signal; handling optional 3.2 QSIG Media Type
The application/QSIG media type is defined by the following information:
QSIG Required parameters: none Optional parameters: version Encoding scheme: binary Security considerations:
The use of the 'version' parameter allows identification of different QSIG variants.
This enables the terminating Connection Server to recognize and parse the message correctly, or (possibly) to reject the message if the particular QSIG variant is not supported.
Table 2 is a list of protocol versions supported by the 'application/QSIG' media type.
The following is how a typical header would look (Content Disposition not included in this instance):
The default Content Disposition disposition type is "signal" as in an ISUP body part.
The "handling" parameter described above can also be used for QSIG bodies.
4.1 ISUP SIP message format requires a Request line followed by Header lines followed by a CRLF separator followed by the message body.
To illustrate the use of the 'application/ISUP' media type, below is an INVITE message which has the originating SDP information and an encapsulated ISUP IAM.
Note that the two payloads are demarcated by the boundary parameter (specified in RFC 2046 [4]) which in the example has the value "unique boundary 1".

Note: Since binary encoding is used for the ISUP payload, each byte is encoded as a byte, and not as a  two character hex representation.
Hex digits were used in the document because a literal encoding of those bytes would have been confusing and unreadable.
To illustrate the use of the 'application/QSIG' media type, below is an INVITE message which has the originating SDP information and an encapsulated QSIG SETUP message.
Note that the two payloads are demarcated by the boundary parameter (specified in RFC 2046 [4]) which in the example has the value "unique  boundary 1".
This is part of the specification of MIME multipart and is not related to the 'application/QSIG' media type.

Security considerations Information contained in ISUP and QSIG bodies may include sensitive customer information, potentially requiring use of encryption.
Security mechanisms are provided in RFC 2543 (SIP Session Initiation Protocol) and should be used as appropriate for both the SIP message and the encapsulated ISUP or QSIG body.
This document registers the "application/ISUP" and "application/QSIG" MIME media types.
Registrations for the 'version' symbols used within the ISUP and QSIG MIME types must specify a definitive specification reference, identifying a particular issue of the specification, to which the new symbol shall refer.
Identifying a definite specification reference requires a review process; the authors recommend that a subject matter expert be designated as described in RFC 2434 [6] under Expert Review.
Note that where a specification is fully peer to peer backwards compatible with a previous issue (i.e., the compatibility mechanism is supported by both), then there is no need for separate symbols to be registered.
The symbol for the original specification should be used to identify backwards compatible upgrades of that specification as well.
Symbols beginning with the characters 'X ' are reserved for non  standard usage (e.g., cases in which a token other than a string representing an issue of an ISUP specification is appropriate for characterizing ISUP within an administrative domain).
Such non  standard version can only be transmitted between administrative domains in accordance with a bilateral agreement.
These symbols should be administered under the Private Use policy described in RFC 2434.
This document registers a new disposition type for the Content  Disposition header, 'signal', to be used when a MIME body contains supplemental signaling information (ISUP and QSIG as MIME bodies being examples of this).
This document also defines a Content Disposition parameter, "handling".
The handling parameter, handling parm, describes how the UAS should react if it receives a message body whose content type or disposition type it does not understand.
If the parameter has the value "optional", the UAS MUST ignore the message body; if it has the value "required", the UAS MUST return 415 (Unsupported Media Type).
If the handling parameter is missing, the value "required" is to be assumed.
