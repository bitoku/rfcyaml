- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This framework relies on the management terminology from\
    \ the ITU-T to\n   describe the management architecture that could be used for\
    \ an\n   MPLS-TP management network.  The terminology listed below are taken\n\
    \   from/based on the definitions found in ITU-T G.7710 [6], ITU-T G.7712\n  \
    \ [7], and ITU-T M.3013 [13].\n   o  Communication Channel (CCh): A logical channel\
    \ between network\n      elements (NEs) that can be used in (for example) management\
    \ plane\n      applications or control plane applications.  For MPLS-TP, the\n\
    \      physical channel supporting the CCh is the MPLS-TP Management\n      Communication\
    \ Channel (MCC).\n   o  Data Communication Network (DCN): A network that supports\
    \ Layer 1\n      (physical), Layer 2 (data-link), and Layer 3 (network)\n    \
    \  functionality for distributed management communications related to\n      the\
    \ management plane, for distributed signaling communications\n      related to\
    \ the control plane, and other operations communications\n      (e.g., order-wire/voice\
    \ communications, software downloads, etc.).\n      See ITU-T G.7712 [7].\n  \
    \ o  Equipment Management Function (EMF): The management functions\n      within\
    \ an NE.  See ITU-T G.7710 [6].\n   o  Local Craft Terminal (LCT): An out-of-band\
    \ device that connects to\n      an NE for management purposes.  See ITU-T G.7710\
    \ [6].\n   o  Label Switched Path (LSP): An MPLS-TP LSP is an LSP that uses a\n\
    \      subset of the capabilities of an MPLS LSP in order to meet the\n      requirements\
    \ of an MPLS transport network as described in the\n      MPLS-TP framework [4].\n\
    \   o  Management Application Function (MAF): An application process that\n  \
    \    participates in system management.  See ITU-T G.7710 [6].\n   o  Management\
    \ Communication Channel (MCC): A CCh dedicated for\n      management plane communications.\
    \  See ITU-T G.7712 [7].\n   o  Message Communication Function (MCF): The communications\
    \ process\n      that performs functions such as information interchange and relay.\n\
    \      See ITU-T M.3013 [13].\n   o  Management Communication Network (MCN): A\
    \ DCN supporting\n      management plane communication is referred to as a Management\n\
    \      Communication Network (MCN).  See ITU-T G.7712 [7].\n   o  MPLS-TP NE:\
    \ A network element (NE) that supports MPLS-TP\n      functions.  Another term\
    \ that is used for a network element is\n      node.  In terms of this document,\
    \ the term node is equivalent to\n      NE.\n   o  MPLS-TP network: A network\
    \ in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed.\n   o  Network Element Function (NEF): The\
    \ set of functions necessary to\n      manage a network element.  See ITU-T M.3010\
    \ [11].\n   o  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM): For the MPLS-TP\n\
    \      effort the term OAM means the set of tools that consist of\n      \"operation\"\
    \ activities that are undertaken to keep the network up\n      and running, \"\
    administration\" activities that keep track of\n      resources in the network\
    \ and how they are used, and \"maintenance\"\n      activities that facilitate\
    \ repairs and upgrades.  For a complete\n      expansion of the acronym, see \"\
    The OAM Acronym Soup\" [15].\n   o  Operations System (OS): A system that performs\
    \ the functions that\n      support processing of information related to operations,\n\
    \      administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) (see \"The\n    \
    \  OAM Acronym Soup\" [15]) for the networks, including surveillance\n      and\
    \ testing functions to support customer access maintenance.  See\n      ITU-T\
    \ M.3010 [11].\n   o  Signaling Communication Network (SCN): A DCN supporting\
    \ control\n      plane communication is referred to as a Signaling Communication\n\
    \      Network (SCN).  See ITU-T G.7712 [7].\n   o  Signaling Communication Channel\
    \ (SCC): A CCh dedicated for control\n      plane communications.  The SCC may\
    \ be used for GMPLS/ASON\n      signaling and/or other control plane messages\
    \ (e.g., routing\n      messages).  See ITU-T G.7712 [7].\n"
- title: 2.  Management Architecture
  contents:
  - "2.  Management Architecture\n   The management of the MPLS-TP network could be\
    \ based on a multi-\n   tiered distributed management systems, for example as\
    \ described in\n   ITU-T M.3010 [11] and ITU-T M.3060/Y.2401 [12].  Each tier\
    \ provides a\n   predefined level of network management capabilities.  The lowest\
    \ tier\n   of this organization model includes the MPLS-TP network element that\n\
    \   provides the transport service and the Operations System (OS) at the\n   Element\
    \ Management Level.  The Management Application Function (MAF)\n   within the\
    \ NEs and OSs provides the management support.  The MAF at\n   each entity can\
    \ include agents only, managers only, or both agents\n   and managers.  The MAF\
    \ that includes managers is capable of managing\n   an agent included in other\
    \ MAF.\n   The management communication to peer NEs and/or OSs is provided via\n\
    \   the Message Communication Function (MCF) within each entity (e.g., NE\n  \
    \ and OS).  The user can access the management of the MPLS-TP transport\n   network\
    \ via a Local Craft Terminal (LCT) attached to the NE or via a\n   Work Station\
    \ (WS) attached to the OS.\n"

  - "2.1.  Network Management Architecture\n   A transport Management Network (MN)\
    \ may consist of several transport-\n   technology-specific Management Networks.\
    \  Management network\n   partitioning (Figure 1) below (based on ITU-T G.7710\
    \ [6]) shows the\n   management network partitioning.  Notation used in G.7710\
    \ for a\n   transport-technology-specific MN is x.MN, where x is the transport-\n\
    \   specific technology.  An MPLS-TP-specific MN is abbreviated as MT.MN.\n  \
    \ Where there is no ambiguity, we will use \"MN\" for an MPLS-TP-specific\n  \

    \ Network Partitioning\n                                 Figure 1\n   The management\
    \ of the MPLS-TP network is separable from the\n   management of the other technology-specific\
    \ networks, and it operates\n   independently of any particular client- or server-layer\
    \ management\n   plane.\n   An MPLS-TP Management Network (MT.MN) could be partitioned\
    \ into\n   MPLS-TP Management SubNetworks (\"MT.MSN\" or \"MPLS-TP MSN\", or just\n\
    \   \"MSN\" where usage is unambiguous) for consideration of scalability\n   (e.g.,\
    \ geographic or load balancing) or administration (e.g.,\n   operation or ownership).\n\
    \   The MPLS-TP MSN could be connected to other parts of the MN through\n   one\
    \ or more LCTs and/or OSs.  The Message Communication Function\n   (MCF) of an\
    \ MPLS-TP NE initiates/terminates, routes, or otherwise\n   processes management\
    \ messages over CChs or via an external interface.\n   Multiple addressable MPLS-TP\
    \ NEs could be present at a single\n   physical location (i.e., site or office).\
    \  The inter-site\n   communications link between the MPLS-TP NEs will normally\
    \ be provided\n   by the CChs.  Within a particular site, the NEs could communicate\
    \ via\n   an intra-site CCh or via a LAN.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Element Management Architecture\n   The Equipment Management Function (EMF)\
    \ of an MPLS-TP NE provides the\n   means through which a management system manages\
    \ the NE.\n   The EMF interacts with the NE's transport functions by exchanging\n\
    \   Management Information (MI) across the Management Point (MP)\n   Reference\
    \ Points.  The EMF may contain a number of functions that\n   provide a data reduction\
    \ mechanism on the information received across\n   the MP Reference Points.\n\
    \   The EMF includes functions such as Date and Time, FCAPS (Fault,\n   Configuration,\
    \ Accounting, Performance, and Security) management, and\n   Control Plane functions.\
    \  The EMF provides event message processing,\n   data storage, and logging. \
    \ The management Agent, a component of the\n   EMF, converts internal management\
    \ information (MI signals) into\n   Management Application messages and vice versa.\
    \  The Agent responds\n   to Management Application messages from the Message\
    \ Communication\n   Function (MCF) by performing the appropriate operations on\
    \ (for\n   example) the Managed Objects in a Management Information Base (MIB),\n\
    \   as necessary.  The MCF contains communications functions related to\n   the\
    \ world outside of the NE (i.e., Date and Time source, Management\n   Plane, Control\
    \ Plane, Local Craft Terminal, and Local Alarms).\n   The Date and Time functions\
    \ keep track of the NE's date/time, which\n   is used by the FCAPS management\
    \ functions to e.g., time stamp event\n   reports.\n   Below are diagrams that\
    \ illustrate the components of the Equipment\n   Management Function (EMF) of\
    \ a Network Element (NE).  The high-level\n   decomposition of the Network Element\
    \ Function (NEF) picture\n   (Figure 2) provides the breakdown of the NEF, then\
    \ the EMF picture\n   (Figure 3) provides the details of Equipment Management\

- title: 4.1.  LSP Ownership Handover
  contents:
  - "4.1.  LSP Ownership Handover\n   MPLS-TP networks can be managed not only by\
    \ Network Management\n   Systems (i.e., Management Plane (MP)), but also by Control\
    \ Plane (CP)\n   protocols.  The utilization of the control plane is not a mandatory\n\
    \   requirement (see MPLS-TP Requirements [2]), but it is often used by\n   network\
    \ operators in order to make network configuration and Label\n   Switched Path\
    \ (LSP) recovery both faster and simpler.\n   In networks where both CP and MP\
    \ are provided, an LSP could be\n   created by either (CP or MP).  The entity\
    \ creating an LSP owns the\n   data plane resources comprising that LSP.  Only\
    \ the owner of an LSP\n   is typically able to modify/delete it.  This results\
    \ in a need for\n   interaction between the MP and CP to allow either to manage\
    \ all the\n   resources of a network.\n   Network operators might prefer to have\
    \ full control of the network\n   resources during the set-up phase and then allow\
    \ the network to be\n   automatically maintained by the Control Plane.  This can\
    \ be achieved\n   by creating LSPs via the Management Plane and subsequently\n\
    \   transferring LSP ownership to the Control Plane.  This is referred to\n  \
    \ as \"ownership handover\" RFC 5493 [10].  MP to CP ownership handover\n   is\
    \ then considered a requirement where a Control Plane is in use that\n   supports\
    \ it.  The converse (CP to MP ownership handover) is a feature\n   that is recommended\
    \ -- but not required -- for (G)MPLS networks\n   because it has only minor applications\
    \ (for example, moving LSPs from\n   one path to another as a maintenance operation).\n\
    \   The LSP handover procedure has already been standardized for GMPLS\n   networks,\
    \ where the signaling protocol used is RSVP-TE (RFC 3209\n   [1]).  The utilization\
    \ of RSVP-TE enhancements are defined in [5].\n   MP and CP interworking also\
    \ includes the exchange of information that\n   is either requested by the MP,\
    \ or a notification by the CP as a\n   consequence of a request from the MP or\
    \ an automatic action (for\n   example, a failure occurs or an operation is performed).\
    \  The CP is\n   asked to notify the MP in a reliable manner about the status\
    \ of the\n   operations it performs and to provide a mechanism to monitor the\n\
    \   status of Control Plane objects (e.g., TE Link status, available\n   resources),\
    \ and to log operations related to Control Plane LSP.\n   Logging is one of the\
    \ most critical aspects because the MP always\n   needs to have an accurate history\
    \ and status of each LSP and all Data\n   Plane resources involved in it.\n"
- title: 5.  Performance Management
  contents:
  - "5.  Performance Management\n   Performance statistics could overwhelm a Management\
    \ Network, so it is\n   important to provide flexible instrumentation that enables\
    \ control\n   over the amount of performance data to be collected.  Mechanisms\
    \ for\n   limiting the quantity of information collected are well known and\n\
    \   deployed in IETF standards (see RFC 2819 (RMON) [8] and RFC 4502\n   (RMON2)\
    \ [9]).  The details of the performance data collected\n   (including loss and\
    \ delay measurement data) are found in the \"Network\n   Management Requirements\
    \ for MPLS-based Transport Networks\" document\n   [3].\n   A distinction is made\
    \ between performance data that is collected on-\n   demand and data that is collected\
    \ proactively.  The definitions of\n   on-demand and proactive measurement are\
    \ provided for OAM in the\n   \"Network Management Requirements for MPLS-based\
    \ Transport Networks\"\n   document [3].\n   On-demand measurement provides the\
    \ operator with the ability to do\n   performance measurement for maintenance\
    \ purpose, such as diagnosis or\n   to provide detailed verification of proactive\
    \ measurement.  It is\n   used typically on specific LSP service instances for\
    \ a limited time,\n   thus limiting its impact on network performance under normal\n\
    \   operations.  Therefore, on-demand measurement does not result in\n   scaling\
    \ issues.\n   Proactive measurement is used continuously over time after being\n\
    \   configured with periodicity and storage information.  Data collected\n   from\
    \ proactive measurement are usually used for verifying the\n   performance of\
    \ the service.  Proactive performance monitoring has the\n   potential to overwhelm\
    \ both the process of collecting performance\n   data at a network element (for\
    \ some arbitrary number of service\n   instances traversing the NE), and the process\
    \ of reporting this\n   information to the OS.  As a consequence of these considerations,\n\
    \   operators would typically limit the services to which proactive\n   performance\
    \ measurement would be applied to a very selective subset\n   of the services\
    \ being provided and would limit the reporting of this\n   information to statistical\
    \ summaries (as opposed to raw or detailed\n   performance statistics).\n"

    \   service conditions or attack.  The EMF interfaces that use or access\n   private\
    \ information should be protected from eavesdropping, mis-\n   configuration,\
    \ and/or mal-configuration by unauthorized network\n   elements, systems, or users.\n\
    \   Performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization\n   involves\

    \ that the network operator considers private.\n   Section 4.3 of the \"Security\
