Abstract Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) is a framework to provide reliable server pooling.
The RSerPool framework consists of two protocols: ASAP (Aggregate Server Access Protocol) and ENRP (Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol).
This document defines an SMIv2  compliant (Structure of Management Information Version 2)
(MIB) module providing access to managed objects in an RSerPool implementation.
This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module that describes managed objects for RSerPool implementations.
The Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) Framework For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) framework, please refer to [RFC3237], [RFC5351], [RFC5352], [RFC5353], [RFC5354], [RFC5355], and [RFC5356].
A more informal introduction can be found at [RSerPoolPage] as well as in [Dre2006], [LCN2005], and [IJHIT2008].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The textual conventions are compliant to RFC 4001
The following diagram illustrates the structure of the MIB.
As the figure shows, the MIB consists of three main branches: "rserpoolENRPServers", "rserpoolPoolElements", and "rserpoolPoolUsers".
The first branch, "rserpoolENRPServers", is used to access managed objects in the set of ENRP servers running on a given host.
While it is assumed that it does not make much sense to run multiple ENRP servers for the same operation scope on one host, running multiple ENRP servers for different operation scopes is very likely when the ENRP server processes run on routers.
Therefore, the MIB has to be able to manage multiple ENRP servers on the same host. "
rserpoolPoolElements" is used to access managed objects in the set of pool elements that are running on a given host.
The third branch, "rserpoolPoolUsers", is used to access managed objects in the set of pool users that are running on a given host.
Note: "rserpoolENRPServers" is filled on hosts running ENRP server instances, "rserpoolPoolElements" is filled on hosts running pool element instances, and "rserpoolPoolUsers" is filled on hosts running pool user instances.
Of course, multiple different components may run on the same host, which leads to filling of multiple different branches.
In fact, the structure of the three branches is very similar.
Because the other two branches are so similar, we describe only the first branch in detail, and provide a summary description of the second and third branch.
We now proceed with a description of the branches.
Access to Managed Objects on ENRP Servers
The first branch describes managed objects at a set of ENRP servers.
Any given ENRP server of this set will, at a certain moment in time, have registration information for a set of active pools.
Each of these pools in turn may have a list of pool elements that are registered under that pool.
To allow this information to be retrieved via SNMP, the ERNP server branch of the RSerPool MIB uses the table in table technique described in [SNMPMIBS].
Specifically, the ENRP servers branch creates four levels of nesting, as indicated in the following diagram:
Nesting of the ENRP Server Branch Nesting Structure: Level 1: rserpoolENRPTable
Access to Managed Objects on Pool Elements
The construction of the Pool Elements branch is very similar to the pool elements table of the ENRP servers branch.
But instead of grouping the pool elements into pools (which does not make sense here), the pool elements table is the top of the hierarchy, and each pool element entry specifies its operation scope and pool handle.
That is, the nesting structure is as follows:
Nesting of the Pool Elements Branch Level 1:
Access to Managed Objects on Pool Users For the Pool Users branch, it is only necessary to list the pool user instances, including their operation scope and pool handle.
Upon changes of writable objects, an implementation SHOULD store the new values in a persistent manner if it has the capability to do this.
An implementation SHOULD use these stored values upon reset or reinitialization.

The RSerPool MIB is an Experimental track MIB module, since the RSerPool documents are Experimental RFCs.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
rserpoolPEPoolHandle (pool handle of pool element change, similar to ASAP)
rserpoolPEPolicyID (pool element ID change, similar to ASAP) rserpoolPEPolicyDescription (textual description change)
(policy weight change, similar to ASAP)
(policy load degradation change, similar to ASAP)
rserpoolPERegistrationLife (registration lifetime change, similar to ASAP)
rserpoolPUPoolHandle (pool handle of accessed pool change, similar to ASAP) rserpoolPUDescription (textual description change)
The security implications of changing these items are similar to changes via ASAP; the corresponding security implications are described in the threats document [RFC5355].
Modifying the textual descriptions of components may result in wrong administrator decisions upon malicious information.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
Read access reveals the same information which is also available by ASAP and ENRP access.
The security implications of these two protocols are explained in detail by the threats document [RFC5355].
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
