- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The \"Tao of the IETF\" (\"Tao\") describes the inner workings\
    \ of IETF\n   meetings and Working Groups, discusses organizations related to\
    \ the\n   IETF, and introduces the standards process.  It is not a formal IETF\n\
    \   process document but instead an informational overview.  The Tao has\n   traditionally\
    \ been published as an RFC.  It has been published as\n   RFCs 1391, 1539, 1718,\
    \ and 3160; it is currently [RFC4677].\n   At the time this document is published,\
    \ there is a strong desire in\n   the IETF community to turn the Tao into a web\
    \ page that can be\n   updated more easily.  This document describes that process.\
    \  At the\n   same time, this document formally obsoletes the last version of\
    \ the\n   Tao that was published as an RFC because the last version, RFC 4677,\n\
    \   is no longer considered the \"latest\" version of the Tao: the new web\n \
    \  page is.\n   This document contains the procedure agreed to by the IESG.  The\
    \ Tao\n   has traditionally been an IETF consensus document, which means that\n\
    \   the IESG has had the final say about what the Tao contained before it\n  \
    \ was sent to the RFC Editor.  Thus, the IESG should have final say\n   regarding\
    \ what the Tao says when it is a web page.\n"
- title: 2.  Procedure for Publishing and Editing the Tao
  contents:
  - "2.  Procedure for Publishing and Editing the Tao\n   The Tao is published at\
    \ <http://www.ietf.org/tao.html> and\n   <https://www.ietf.org/tao.html>.  The\
    \ initial content for the Tao web\n   page is based on a draft document that was\
    \ meant to replace RFC 4677.\n   The Tao is edited by one or more people as designated\
    \ by the IESG.\n   Suggestions for changes to the Tao are discussed on the\n \
    \  tao-discuss@ietf.org mailing list.\n   The editor of the Tao decides which\
    \ proposed changes should be\n   submitted to the IESG for approval.  The editor\
    \ publishes the\n   proposed changes in a version at\n   <http://www.ietf.org/tao-possible-revision.html>.\
    \  The IESG may\n   accept as many of the proposed changes as it wishes.  The\
    \ IESG then\n   submits the changed version to the IETF Secretariat for publication\n\
    \   on the IETF web page at the URLs given above.  The Tao editor and the\n  \
    \ IESG should confirm that the page appears on the web site as\n   intended.\n\
    \   Each version of the Tao has a visible timestamp near the beginning of\n  \
    \ the document.  All published versions are archived using URLs of the\n   form\
    \ <http://www.ietf.org/tao-archive/tao-YYYYMMDD.html>, and a list\n   of the revisions\
    \ is available at <http://www.ietf.org/tao-archive/>.\n   From time to time, versions\
    \ of the Tao are translated into other\n   languages.  These translations do not\
    \ represent IETF consensus and\n   may be provided on an \"as is\" basis.  The\
    \ issues of how translations\n   are recorded, made available, cross-referenced\
    \ to versions of the\n   Tao, and archived are outside the scope of this document\
    \ and are for\n   future study.\n"
- title: 3.  Proposals for How the Tao Web Page Should Be Developed
  contents:
  - "3.  Proposals for How the Tao Web Page Should Be Developed\n   During the discussion\
    \ that led to this document, there were many\n   proposals for how the Tao, as\
    \ a web page, should be published and\n   edited.  Some wanted just a web page;\
    \ some wanted a web page and\n   periodic snapshots as RFCs.  Some wanted a wiki\
    \ that could be easily\n   edited by anyone in the IETF community, with a master\
    \ editor who\n   would revert bad edits; some wanted a wiki with a more limited\
    \ group\n   of contributors.  The procedure in Section 2 above was the rough\n\
    \   consensus of the discussion.\n"
