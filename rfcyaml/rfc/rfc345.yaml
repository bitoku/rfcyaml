    \ IN MIXED INTEGER PROGRAMMING (MPSX ON 360/91 AT CCN)\n     MPSX is a newer version\
    \ of the IBM project MPS, used for integer\nprogramming.  From what I've been\
    \ told, MPSX outperforms the previous\npackage.  In addition, it has available\
    \ a feature of mixed integer\nprogramming.\n     Since MPSX is an IBM product,\
    \ an installation which uses it is\ncharged a fixed rental fee per month.  At\
    \ the present time, CCN does\nnot have this processor with its system.  We are\
    \ anticipating asking\nthem to install it, with the mixed integer programming\
    \ option.  We\nare looking for any other users from the Network who may need this\n\
    software in order to prorate the cost between several installations.\nThe initial\
    \ estimate of the cost is $130/month, plus $225 for the\nmixed integer programming\
    \ feature.  A share of this cost would be\nassigned to each user of the system.\
    \  I am told by Robert Bell of CCN\nthat they could take care of those details\
    \ for us.\n     If you have an interest in this, I urge you to contact me within\n\
    the month.  If you have questions about the mixed integer programming\nfeature\
    \ of the MPSX system itself, you could contact:\n                     Stewart\
