    is that these textual conventions will be\n   imported and used in GMPLS-related

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a MIB module that contains textual
    conventions\n   (TCs) for Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks.\n
    \  These textual conventions should be imported by MIB modules that\n   manage
    GMPLS networks.\n   This MIB module supplements the MIB module in [RFC3811] that
    defines\n   textual conventions for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\n   management.
    \ [RFC3811] may continue to be used without this MIB\n   module in networks that
    support only MPLS.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n
    \  [RFC2119].\n   For an introduction to the concepts of GMPLS, see [RFC3945].\n"

    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
