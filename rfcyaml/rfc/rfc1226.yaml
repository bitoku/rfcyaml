  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo describes a method for the encapsulation of\
    \ AX.25 (the\n   Amateur Packet-Radio Link-Layer Protocol) frames within IP packets.\n\
    \   This technique is an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\n   community.\
    \  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.\n   Please refer\
    \ to the current edition of the \"IAB Official Protocol\n   Standards\" for the\
    \ standardization state and status of this protocol.\n   Distribution of this\
    \ memo is unlimited.\n"

  - "The AX.25 Amateur Packet-Radio Link-Layer Protocol\n   The AX.25 Amateur Packet-Radio\
    \ Link-Layer Protocol is described in\n   the publication by that name [1], incorporated\
    \ here by reference.\n   Each AX.25 packet (\"frame\") is encapsulated in one\
    \ IP datagram.\n   Normally no AX.25 frame will exceed 330 octets, so fragmentation\
    \ at\n   the IP layer should not be necessary.  However, experiments with\n  \
    \ larger AX.25 frame sizes may require the use of standard IP\n   fragmentation\
    \ and reassembly procedures.\n   When an AX.25 frame is encapsulated within an\
    \ IP packet, HDLC framing\n   elements (flags and zero-stuffing) are omitted,\
    \ as the IP datagram\n   adequately delimits the beginning and end of each AX.25\
    \ frame.  The\n   16-bit CRC-CCITT frame check sequence (normally generated by\
    \ the HDLC\n   transmission hardware) is included.  In all other respects, AX.25\n\
    \   frames are encapsulated unaltered.\n   Each such IP datagram shall have a\
    \ protocol number of 93.\n"
