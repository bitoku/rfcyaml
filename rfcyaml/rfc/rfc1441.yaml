    \ 1441            Introduction to SNMPv2          April 1993\n          1.  Introduction\n\
    \          The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of\n       \
    \   version 2 of the Internet-standard Network Management\n          Framework,\
    \ termed the SNMP version 2 framework (SNMPv2).  This\n          framework is\
    \ derived from the original Internet-standard\n          Network Management Framework\
    \ (SNMPv1), which consists of these\n          three documents:\n            \
    \   RFC 1155 [1] which defines the Structure of Management\n               Information\
    \ (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and\n               naming objects\
    \ for the purpose of management.\n               RFC 1212 [2] which defines a\
    \ more concise description\n               mechanism, which is wholly consistent\
    \ with the SMI.\n               RFC 1157 [3] which defines the Simple Network\
    \ Management\n               Protocol (SNMP), the protocol used for network access\
    \ to\n               managed objects.\n          For information on coexistence\
    \ between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2,\n          consult [4].\n          RFC 1441     \
    \       Introduction to SNMPv2          April 1993\n          2.  Components of\
    \ the SNMPv2 Framework\n          A network management system contains: several\
    \ (potentially\n          many) nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an\
    \ agent,\n          which has access to management instrumentation; at least one\n\
    \          management station; and, a management protocol, used to convey\n  \
    \        management information between the agents and management\n          stations.\
    \  Operations of the protocol are carried out under an\n          administrative\
    \ framework which defines both authentication and\n          authorization policies.\n\
    \          Network management stations execute management applications\n     \
    \     which monitor and control network elements.  Network elements\n        \
    \  are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc.,\n          which\
    \ are monitored and controlled through access to their\n          management information.\n\
    \          2.1.  Structure of Management Information\n          Management information\
    \ is viewed as a collection of managed\n          objects, residing in a virtual\
    \ information store, termed the\n          Management Information Base (MIB).\
    \  Collections of related\n          objects are defined in MIB modules.  These\
    \ modules are written\n          using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation\
    \ One (ASN.1)\n          [5].  It is the purpose of the Structure of Management\n\
    \          Information for SNMPv2 document [6] to define that subset.\n      \
    \    The SMI is divided into three parts: module definitions,\n          object\
    \ definitions, and, trap definitions.\n          (1)  Module definitions are used\
    \ when describing information\n               modules.  An ASN.1 macro, MODULE-IDENTITY,\
    \ is used to\n               concisely convey the semantics of an information\
    \ module.\n          (2)  Object definitions are used when describing managed\n\
    \               objects.  An ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-TYPE, is used to\n          \
    \     concisely convey the syntax and semantics of a managed\n               object.\n\
    \          (3)  Notification definitions are used when describing\n          \
    \     unsolicited transmissions of management information.  An\n             \
    \  ASN.1 macro, NOTIFICATION-TYPE, is used to concisely\n               convey\
    \ the syntax and semantics of a notification.\n          RFC 1441            Introduction\
    \ to SNMPv2          April 1993\n          2.2.  Textual Conventions\n       \
    \   When designing a MIB module, it is often useful to new define\n          types\
    \ similar to those defined in the SMI.  In comparison to a\n          type defined\
    \ in the SMI, each of these new types has a\n          different name, a similar\
    \ syntax, but a more precise\n          semantics.  These newly defined types\
    \ are termed textual\n          conventions, and are used for the convenience\
    \ of humans\n          reading the MIB module.  It is the purpose of the Textual\n\
    \          Conventions for SNMPv2 document [7] to define the initial set\n   \
    \       of textual conventions available to all MIB modules.\n          Objects\
    \ defined using a textual convention are always encoded\n          by means of\
    \ the rules that define their primitive type.\n          However, textual conventions\
    \ often have special semantics\n          associated with them.  As such, an ASN.1\
    \ macro, TEXTUAL-\n          CONVENTION, is used to concisely convey the syntax\
    \ and\n          semantics of a textual convention.\n          2.3.  Protocol\
    \ Operations\n          The management protocol provides for the exchange of messages\n\
    \          which convey management information between the agents and the\n  \
    \        management stations.  The form of these messages is a message\n     \
    \     \"wrapper\" which encapsulates a Protocol Data Unit (PDU).  The\n      \
    \    form and meaning of the \"wrapper\" is determined by an\n          administrative\
    \ framework which defines both authentication and\n          authorization policies.\n\
    \          It is the purpose of the Protocol Operations for SNMPv2\n         \
    \ document [8] to define the operations of the protocol with\n          respect\
    \ to the sending and receiving of the PDUs.\n          2.4.  Transport Mappings\n\
    \          The management protocol, version 2 of the Simple Network\n        \
    \  Management Protocol, may be used over a variety of protocol\n          suites.\
    \  It is the purpose of the Transport Mappings for\n          SNMPv2 document\
    \ [9] to define how the SNMPv2 maps onto an\n          initial set of transport\
    \ domains.  Other mappings may be\n          defined in the future.\n        \
    \  RFC 1441            Introduction to SNMPv2          April 1993\n          Although\
    \ several mappings are defined, the mapping onto UDP is\n          the preferred\
    \ mapping.  As such, to provide for the greatest\n          level of interoperability,\
    \ systems which choose to deploy\n          other mappings should also provide\
    \ for proxy service to the\n          UDP mapping.\n          2.5.  Protocol Instrumentation\n\
    \          It is the purpose of the Management Information Base for\n        \
    \  SNMPv2 document [10] to define managed objects which describe\n          the\
    \ behavior of a SNMPv2 entity.  The Manager-to-Manager MIB\n          document\
    \ [11] defines an initial set of managed objects which\n          describe the\
    \ behavior of a SNMPv2 entity which acts in a\n          manager role.  It is\
    \ expected that extensions to this MIB will\n          be defined in the future.\n\
    \          2.6.  Administrative Framework\n          It is the purpose of the\
    \ Administrative Model for SNMPv2\n          document [12] to define the behavior\
    \ of a SNMPv2 party - a\n          conceptual, virtual execution context whose\
    \ operation is\n          restricted (for security or other purposes) to an\n\
    \          administratively defined subset of all possible operations of\n   \
    \       a particular SNMPv2 entity.\n          Associated with each SNMPv2 party\
    \ is a single authentication\n          protocol and a single privacy protocol.\
    \  It is the purpose of\n          the Security Protocols for SNMPv2 document\
    \ [13] to define\n          those protocols.\n          The Party MIB for SNMPv2\
    \ document [14] defines managed objects\n          which correspond to the properties\
    \ associated with a SNMPv2\n          party.\n          2.7.  Conformance Statements\n\
    \          It may be useful to define the acceptable lower-bounds of\n       \
    \   implementation, along with the actual level of implementation\n          achieved.\
    \  It is the purpose of the Conformance Statements for\n          SNMPv2 document\
    \ [15] to define the notation used for these\n          purposes.  There are two\
    \ kinds of notations:\n          RFC 1441            Introduction to SNMPv2  \
    \        April 1993\n          (1)  Compliance statements are used when describing\n\
    \               requirements for agents with respect to object\n             \
    \  definitions.  An ASN.1 macro, MODULE-COMPLIANCE, is used\n               to\
    \ concisely convey such requirements.\n          (2)  Capability statements are\
    \ used when describing\n               capabilities of agents with respect to\
    \ object\n               definitions.  An ASN.1 macro, AGENT-CAPABILITIES, is\
    \ used\n               to concisely convey such capabilities.\n          Finally,\
    \ collections of related objects are grouped together\n          to form a unit\
    \ of conformance.  An ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-GROUP,\n          is used to concisely\
    \ convey the syntax and semantics of a\n          group.\n          RFC 1441 \
    \           Introduction to SNMPv2          April 1993\n          3.  Acknowledgements\n\
    \          The SNMPv2 framework is based on the outstanding technical\n      \
    \    direction pioneered by the original authors of the SGMP: James\n        \
    \  R. (Chuck) Davin, of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science,\n          Mark\
    \ S. Fedor, of Performance Systems International, Inc.,\n          Martin L. Schoffstall,\
    \ also of PSI, and Jeffrey D. Case.\n          Since the invention of the SGMP\
    \ in 1987, many individuals have\n          devoted much energy toward creating\
    \ the unprecedented success\n          of the Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework.  As\n          such, the list of people worthy of acknowledgement\
    \ is too\n          great to enumerate here.\n          However, in retrospect,\
    \ it seems clear that the concepts in\n          the original architecture, as\
    \ envisioned by Chuck Davin, have\n          provided the basis for the success\
    \ of the current framework.\n          We hope that the SNMPv2 framework will\
    \ be able to successfully\n          build on this work.\n          Finally, the\
    \ comments of the SNMP version 2 working group are\n          gratefully acknowledged:\n\
