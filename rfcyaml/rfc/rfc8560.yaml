  - "1.  Introduction\n   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and Provider Backbone
    Bridging\n   VPLS (PBB-VPLS) are widely deployed Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) technologies.\n
    \  Many service providers who are looking at adopting Ethernet VPN\n   (EVPN)
    and Provider Backbone Bridging EVPN (PBB-EVPN) want to\n   preserve their investments
    in the VPLS and PBB-VPLS networks.  Hence,\n   they require mechanisms by which
    EVPN and PBB-EVPN technologies can\n   be introduced into their brownfield VPLS
    and PBB-VPLS networks\n   without requiring any upgrades (software or hardware)
    to these\n   networks.  This document specifies procedures for the seamless\n
    \  integration of the two technologies in the same MPLS/IP network.\n   Throughout
    this document, we use the term \"(PBB-)EVPN\" to correspond\n   to both EVPN and
    PBB-EVPN, and we use the term \"(PBB-)VPLS\" to\n   correspond to both VPLS and
    PBB-VPLS.  This document specifies the\n   control-plane and forwarding behavior
    needed for 1) auto-discovery of\n   a VPN instance, 2) multicast and unicast operations,
    and 3) a MAC\n   mobility operation.  This enables seamless integration between\n

    \       Figure 1: Seamless Integration of (PBB-)EVPN and (PBB-)VPLS\n   Section
    2 provides the details of the requirements.  Section 3\n   specifies procedures
    for the seamless integration of VPLS and EVPN\n   networks.  Section 4 specifies
    procedures for the seamless\n   integration of PBB-VPLS and PBB-EVPN networks.\n
    \  It should be noted that the scenarios for both PBB-VPLS integration\n   with
    EVPN and VPLS integration with PBB-EVPN are not covered in this\n   document because
    there haven't been any requirements from service\n   providers for these scenarios;
    deployments that employ PBB-VPLS\n   typically require PBB encapsulation for various
    reasons.  Hence, it\n   is expected that for those deployments, the evolution
    path would move\n   from PBB-VPLS towards PBB-EVPN.  Furthermore, the evolution
    path from\n   VPLS is expected to move towards EVPN.\n   The seamless integration
    solution described in this document has the\n   following attributes:\n   -  When
    ingress replication is used for multi-destination traffic\n      delivery, the
    solution reduces the scope of MMRP (which is a soft-\n      state protocol defined
    in Clause 10 of [IEEE.802.1Q]) to only that\n      of existing VPLS PEs and uses
    the more robust BGP-based mechanism\n      for multicast pruning among new EVPN
    PEs.\n   -  It is completely backward compatible.\n   -  New PEs can leverage
    the extensive multihoming mechanisms and\n      provisioning simplifications of
    (PBB-)EVPN:\n      (a)  Auto-sensing of Multihomed Networks (MHNs) / Multihomed\n
    \          Devices (MHDs)\n      (b)  Auto-discovery of redundancy groups\n      (c)

  - "2.  Requirements\n   The following are the key requirements for backward compatibility\n
    \  between (PBB-)EVPN and (PBB-)VPLS:\n   1.  The solution must allow for staged
    migration towards (PBB-)EVPN\n       on a site-by-site basis per VPN instance,
    e.g., new EVPN sites to\n       be provisioned on (PBB-)EVPN Provider Edge devices
    (PEs).\n   2.  The solution must not require any changes to existing VPLS or\n
    \      PBB-VPLS PEs, not even a software upgrade.\n   3.  The solution must allow
    for the coexistence of PE devices running\n       (PBB-)EVPN and (PBB-)VPLS for
    the same VPN instance and single-\n       homed segments.\n   4.  The solution
    must support single-active redundancy of multihomed\n       networks and multihomed
    devices for (PBB-)EVPN PEs.\n   5.  In cases of single-active redundancy, the
    participant VPN\n       instances may span across both (PBB-)EVPN PEs and (PBB-)VPLS
    PEs\n       as long as the MHD or MHN is connected to (PBB-)EVPN PEs.\n   6.  Support
    of the All-Active redundancy mode across both (PBB-)EVPN\n       PEs and (PBB-)VPLS
    PEs is outside the scope of this document.\n       All-Active redundancy is not
    applicable to VPLS and PBB-VPLS.\n       Therefore, when EVPN (or PBB-EVPN) PEs
    need to operate seamlessly\n       with VPLS (or PBB-VPLS) PEs, they MUST use
    a redundancy mode that\n       is applicable to VPLS (or PBB-VPLS).  This redundancy
    mode is\n       Single-Active.\n   These requirements collectively allow for the
    seamless insertion of\n   (PBB-)EVPN technology into brownfield (PBB-)VPLS deployments.\n"
  title: 2.  Requirements
- contents:
  - "3.  VPLS Integration with EVPN\n   In order to support seamless integration with
    VPLS PEs, this document\n   requires that VPLS PEs support VPLS A-D per [RFC6074],
    and it\n   requires EVPN PEs to support both BGP EVPN routes per [RFC7432] and\n
    \  VPLS A-D per [RFC6074].  All the logic for seamless integration shall\n   reside
    on the EVPN PEs.  If a VPLS instance is set up without the use\n   of VPLS A-D,
    it is still possible (but cumbersome) for EVPN PEs to\n   integrate that VPLS
    instance by manually configuring pseudowires\n   (PWs) to all the VPLS PEs in
    that instance (i.e., the integration is\n   no longer seamless).\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Capability Discovery\n   The EVPN PEs MUST advertise both the BGP VPLS
      auto-discovery (A-D)\n   route as well as the BGP EVPN Inclusive Multicast Ethernet
      Tag (IMET)\n   route for a given VPN instance.  The VPLS PEs only advertise
      the BGP\n   VPLS A-D route, per the procedures specified in [RFC4761], [RFC4762]\n
      \  and [RFC6074].  The operator may decide to use the same Route Target\n   (RT)
      to identify a VPN on both EVPN and VPLS networks.  In this case,\n   when a
      VPLS PE receives the EVPN IMET route, it MUST ignore it on the\n   basis that
      it belongs to an unknown Subsequent Address Family\n   Identifier (SAFI).  However,
      the operator may choose to use two RTs\n   -- one to identify the VPN on the
      VPLS network and another for the\n   EVPN network -- and employ RT Constrain
      mechanisms [RFC4684] in order\n   to prevent BGP EVPN routes from reaching the
      VPLS PEs.\n   When an EVPN PE receives both a VPLS A-D route as well as an EVPN\n
      \  IMET route from a given remote PE for the same VPN instance, it MUST\n   give
      preference to the EVPN route for the purpose of discovery.  This\n   ensures
      that, at the end of the route exchanges, all EVPN-capable PEs\n   discover other
      EVPN-capable PEs in addition to the VPLS-only PEs for\n   that VPN instance.
      \ Furthermore, all the VPLS-only PEs will discover\n   the EVPN PEs as if they
      were standard VPLS PEs.  In other words, when\n   the discovery phase is complete,
      the EVPN PEs will have discovered\n   all the PEs in the VPN instance along
      with their associated\n   capability (EVPN or VPLS-only), whereas the VPLS PEs
      will have\n   discovered all the PEs in the VPN instance as if they were all
      VPLS-\n   only PEs.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Capability Discovery
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Forwarding Setup and Unicast Operation\n   The procedures for the forwarding
      state setup and unicast operation\n   on the VPLS PE are per [RFC8077], [RFC4761],
      and [RFC4762].\n   The procedures for forwarding state setup and unicast operation
      on\n   the EVPN PE are as follows:\n   -  The EVPN PE MUST establish a PW to
      each remote PE from which it\n      has received only a VPLS A-D route for the
      corresponding VPN\n      instance and MUST set up the label stack corresponding
      to the PW\n      FEC.  For seamless integration between EVPN and VPLS PEs, the
      PW\n      that is set up between a pair of VPLS and EVPN PEs is between the\n
      \     VSI of the VPLS PE and the MAC-VRF of the EVPN PE.\n   -  The EVPN PE
      MUST set up the label stack corresponding to the MP2P\n      VPN unicast FEC
      to any remote PE that has advertised an EVPN IMET\n      route.\n   -  If an
      EVPN PE receives a VPLS A-D route from a given PE, it sets\n      up a PW to
      that PE.  If it then receives an EVPN IMET route from\n      the same PE, the
      EVPN PE MUST bring that PW operationally down.\n   -  If an EVPN PE receives
      an EVPN IMET route followed by a VPLS A-D\n      route from the same PE, then
      the EVPN PE will set up the PW but\n      MUST keep it operationally down.\n
      \  -  In case VPLS A-D is not used in some VPLS PEs, the EVPN PEs need\n      to
      be provisioned manually with PWs to those remote VPLS PEs for\n      each VPN
      instance.  In that case, if an EVPN PE receives an EVPN\n      IMET route from
      a PE to which a PW exists, the EVPN PE MUST bring\n      the PW operationally
      down.\n   When the EVPN PE receives traffic over the VPLS PWs, it learns the\n
      \  associated C-MAC addresses in the data plane.  The C-MAC addresses\n   learned
      over these PWs MUST be injected into the bridge table of the\n   associated
      MAC-VRF on that EVPN PE.  The learned C-MAC addresses MAY\n   also be injected
      into the RIB/FIB tables of the associated MAC-VRF on\n   that EVPN PE.  For
      seamless integration between EVPN and VPLS PEs,\n   because these PWs belong
      to the same split-horizon group (see\n   [RFC4761] and [RFC4762]) as the MP2P
      EVPN service tunnels, the C-MAC\n   addresses learned and associated with the
      PWs MUST NOT be advertised\n   in the control plane to any remote EVPN PEs.
      \ This is because every\n   EVPN PE can send and receive traffic directly to/from
      every VPLS PE\n   belonging to the same VPN instance; thus, every EVPN PE can
      learn the\n   C-MAC addresses over the corresponding PWs directly.\n   The C-MAC
      addresses learned over local Attachment Circuits (ACs) by\n   an EVPN PE are
      learned in the data plane.  For EVPN PEs, these C-MAC\n   addresses MUST be
      injected into the corresponding MAC-VRF and\n   advertised in the control plane
      using BGP EVPN routes.  Furthermore,\n   the C-MAC addresses learned in the
      control plane via the BGP EVPN\n   routes sent by remote EVPN PEs are injected
      into the corresponding\n   MAC-VRF table.\n   In case of a link failure in a
      single-active Ethernet segment, the\n   EVPN PEs MUST perform both of the following
      tasks:\n   1.  send a BGP mass withdraw to the EVPN peers\n   2.  follow existing
      VPLS MAC Flush procedures with the VPLS peers\n"

      and Multicast (BUM) traffic is initiated\n   from that MAC address, it is flooded
      to all other PEs (both VPLS and\n   EVPN PEs), and the receiving PEs update
      their MAC tables (VSI or\n   MAC-VRF).  The EVPN PEs do not advertise the C-MAC
      addresses learned\n   over the PW to each other because every EVPN PE learns
      them directly\n   over its associated PW to that VPLS PE.  If only known unicast\n
      \  traffic is initiated from the moved C-MAC address toward a known\n   C-MAC,
      the result can be the black-holing of traffic destined to the\n   C-MAC that
      has moved until there is BUM traffic that has been\n   originated with the moved
      C-MAC address as the source MAC address\n   (e.g., as a result of the MAC age-out
      timer expiring).  Such\n   black-holing happens for traffic destined to the
      moved C-MAC from\n   both EVPN and VPLS PEs and is typical for VPLS PEs.\n   When
      a C-MAC address moves from a VPLS PE to an EVPN PE, then as soon\n   as any
      traffic is initiated from that C-MAC address, the C-MAC is\n   learned and advertised
      in the BGP to other EVPN PEs, and the MAC\n   mobility procedure is performed
      among EVPN PEs.  For BUM traffic,\n   both EVPN and VPLS PEs learn the new location
      of the moved C-MAC\n   address; however, if there is only known unicast traffic,
      then only\n   EVPN PEs learn the new location of the C-MAC that has moved and
      not\n   VPLS PEs.  This can result in the black-holing of traffic sent from\n
      \  VPLS PEs destined to the C-MAC that has moved until there is BUM\n   traffic
      originated with the moved C-MAC address as the source MAC\n   address (e.g.,
      as a result of the MAC age-out timer expiring).  Such\n   black-holing happens
      for traffic destined to the moved C-MAC for only\n   VPLS PEs but not for EVPN
      PEs and is typical for VPLS PEs.\n"

      state setup and unicast operation on\n   the PBB-VPLS PE are per [RFC8077] and
      [RFC7080].\n   The procedures for forwarding state setup and unicast operation
      on\n   the PBB-EVPN PE are as follows:\n   -  The PBB-EVPN PE MUST establish
      a PW to each remote PBB-VPLS PE\n      from which it has received only a VPLS
      A-D route for the\n      corresponding VPN instance and MUST set up the label
      stack\n      corresponding to the PW FEC.  For seamless integration between\n
      \     PBB-EVPN and PBB-VPLS PEs, the PW that is set up between a pair of\n      PBB-VPLS
      and PBB-EVPN PEs is between the B-components of PBB-EVPN\n      PE and PBB-VPLS
      PE per Section 4 of [RFC7041].\n   -  The PBB-EVPN PE MUST set up the label
      stack corresponding to the\n      MP2P VPN unicast FEC to any remote PBB-EVPN
      PE that has advertised\n      an EVPN IMET route.\n   -  If a PBB-EVPN PE receives
      a VPLS A-D route from a given PE, it\n      sets up a PW to that PE.  If it
      then receives an EVPN IMET route\n      from the same PE, the PBB-EVPN PE MUST
      bring that PW operationally\n      down.\n   -  If a PBB-EVPN PE receives an
      EVPN IMET route followed by a VPLS\n      A-D route from the same PE, then the
      PBB-EVPN PE will set up the\n      PW but MUST keep it operationally down.\n
      \  -  In case VPLS A-D is not used in some PBB-VPLS PEs, the PBB-EVPN\n      PEs
      need to be provisioned manually with PWs to those remote\n      PBB-VPLS PEs
      for each VPN instance.  In that case, if a PBB-EVPN\n      PE receives an EVPN
      IMET route from a PE to which a PW exists, the\n      PBB-EVPN PE MUST bring
      the PW operationally down.\n   -  When the PBB-EVPN PE receives traffic over
      the PBB-VPLS PWs, it\n      learns the associated B-MAC addresses in the data
      plane.  The\n      B-MAC addresses learned over these PWs MUST be injected into
      the\n      bridge table of the associated MAC-VRF on that PBB-EVPN PE.  The\n
      \     learned B-MAC addresses MAY also be injected into the RIB/FIB\n      tables
      of the associated MAC-VRF on that BPP-EVPN PE.  For\n      seamless integration
      between PBB-EVPN and PBB-VPLS PEs, since\n      these PWs belong to the same
      split-horizon group as the MP2P EVPN\n      service tunnels, the B-MAC addresses
      learned and associated with\n      the PWs MUST NOT be advertised in the control
      plane to any remote\n      PBB-EVPN PEs.  This is because every PBB-EVPN PE
      can send and\n      receive traffic directly to/from every PBB-VPLS PE belonging
      to\n      the same VPN instance.\n   -  The C-MAC addresses learned over local
      Attachment Circuits (ACs)\n      by a PBB-EVPN PE are learned in the data plane.
      \ For PBB-EVPN PEs,\n      these C-MAC addresses are learned in the I-component
      of PBB-EVPN\n      PEs and are not advertised in the control plane, per [RFC7623].\n
      \  -  The B-MAC addresses learned in the control plane via the BGP EVPN\n      routes
      sent by remote PBB-EVPN PEs are injected into the\n      corresponding MAC-VRF
      table.\n   In case of a link failure in a single-active Ethernet segment, the\n
      \  PBB-EVPN PEs MUST perform both of the following tasks:\n   1.  send a BGP
      B-MAC withdraw message to the PBB-EVPN peers *or* MAC\n       advertisement
      with the MAC Mobility extended community\n   2.  follow existing VPLS MAC Flush
      procedures with the PBB-VPLS peers\n"
