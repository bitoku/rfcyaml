  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document reflects the experience gained with \"RFC\
    \ Editor Model\n   (Version 1)\", documented in [RFC5620], and updates the RFC\
    \ Editor\n   Model (Version 2) to be aligned with the new IASA 2.0 Model [RFC8711]\n\
    \   that creates the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF\n   LLC)\
    \ managed by a board of directors (IETF LLC Board).  As part of\n   the IASA 2.0\
    \ Model, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee\n   (IAOC) is eliminated,\
    \ and its oversight and advising functions\n   transferred to the new IETF LLC.\
    \  This document obsoletes [RFC6635]\n   to replace all references to the IASA\
    \ and related structures with\n   those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.\n   The\
    \ IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is concerned\n   with ensuring\
    \ the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC Editor\n   succession, RFC quality,\
    \ and RFC document accessibility.  The IAB is\n   also sensitive to the concerns\
    \ of the IETF LLC about providing the\n   necessary services in a cost-effective\
    \ and efficient manner.\n   The previous RFC Editor model [RFC5620] was first\
    \ approved by the IAB\n   in October 2008, and our understanding of the model\
    \ has evolved with\n   our experience since.  During the implementation of version\
    \ 1 of the\n   model [RFC5620], it was quickly realized that the role of the RFC\n\
    \   Series Editor (RSE) and the oversight responsibilities needed to be\n   structured\
    \ differently.  In order to gain experience with \"running\n   code\", a transitional\
    \ RSE was hired who analyzed the managerial\n   environment and provided recommendations.\
    \  This was followed by the\n   appointment of an acting RSE, who ably managed\
    \ the series while work\n   was undertaken to select and hire a permanent RSE.\
    \  This version of\n   the model is based on the recommendations of both temporary\
    \ RFC\n   Series Editors and the extensive discussion in the IETF community, on\n\
    \   the rfc-interest list, and within the IAB.\n   This document, and the resulting\
    \ structures, will be modified as\n   needed through normal procedures.  The RSE,\
    \ and the IAB, through the\n   RFC Series Oversight Committee (see Section 3.1),\
    \ will continue to\n   monitor discussions within the community about potential\
    \ adjustments\n   to the RFC Editor model and recognize that the process described\
    \ in\n   this document may need to be adjusted to align with any changes that\n\
    \   result from such discussions; hence, the version number in the title.\n  \
    \ The IAB maintains its responsibilities as defined in [RFC2850].\n"
- title: 1.1.  The RFC Editor Function
  contents:
  - "1.1.  The RFC Editor Function\n   The RFC Series is described in [RFC8729]. \
    \ Its Section 3.1 defines\n   \"RFC Editor\":\n   |  Originally, there was a single\
    \ person acting as editor of the RFC\n   |  Series (the RFC Editor).  The task\
    \ has grown, and the work now\n   |  requires the organized activity of several\
    \ experts, so there are\n   |  RFC Editors, or an RFC Editor organization.  In\
    \ time, there may be\n   |  multiple organizations working together to undertake\
    \ the work\n   |  required by the RFC Series.  For simplicity's sake, and without\n\
    \   |  attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,\n  \
    \ |  this document refers to this collection of experts and\n   |  organizations\
    \ as the \"RFC Editor\".\n   |  \n   |  The RFC Editor is an expert technical\
    \ editor and series editor,\n   |  acting to support the mission of the RFC Series.\
    \  As such, the RFC\n   |  Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management\
    \ of the\n   |  RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes.  In\n  \
    \ |  addition, the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime\n   |  mover\
    \ in discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and\n   |  archiving\
    \ RFCs.\n   RFC 8729 does not explore the internal organization of the RFC\n \
    \  Editor.  However, RFC 8729 envisions changes in the RFC Editor\n   organizational\
    \ structure.  There have been several iterations on\n   efforts to improve and\
    \ clarify this structure.  These have been led\n   by the IAB, in consultation\
    \ with the community and many leadership\n   bodies within the community.  This\
    \ first resulted in the publication\n   of [RFC5620] and then in further discussions\
    \ leading to the\n   publication of [RFC6635].  Some of the details on this evolution\
    \ can\n   be found below.  In undertaking this evolution, the IAB considered\n\
    \   changes that increase flexibility and operational support options,\n   provide\
    \ for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the\n   continuity\
    \ of the RFC Series, while maintaining RFC quality,\n   maintaining timely processing,\
    \ ensuring document accessibility,\n   reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency.\
    \  The model set\n   forth below describes the internal organization of the RFC\
    \ Editor,\n   while remaining consistent with RFC 8729.\n   Note that RFC 8729\
    \ uses the term \"RFC Editor function\" or \"RFC\n   Editor\" as the collective\
    \ set of responsibilities for which this memo\n   provides a model for internal\
    \ organization.  This memo defines the\n   term \"RFC Series Editor\" or \"Series\
    \ Editor\" for one of the\n   organizational components.\n"

    \      Figure 1: Structure of RFC Series Production and Process\n   In this model,\
    \ documents are produced and approved through multiple\n   document streams. \
    \ The stream manager for each stream is responsible\n   for the content of that\
    \ stream.  The four streams that now exist are\n   described in [RFC8729].  The\
    \ RFC Editor function is responsible for\n   the packaging and distribution of\
    \ the documents.  As such, documents\n   from these streams are edited and processed\
    \ by the Production Center\n   and published by the Publisher.  The RFC Series\
    \ Editor will exercise\n   strategic leadership and management over the activities\
    \ of the RFC\n   Publisher and the RFC Production Center (both of which can be\
    \ seen as\n   back-office functions) and will be the entity that:\n   *  Represents\
    \ the RFC Series and the RFC Editor function within the\n      IETF and externally.\n\
    \   *  Leads the community in the design of improvements to the RFC\n      Series.\n\
    \   *  Is responsible for planning and seeing to the execution of\n      improvements\

    \ by the RFC Publisher.\n   *  Is responsible for developing consensus versions\
    \ of vision and\n      policy documents.  These documents will be reviewed by\
    \ the RFC\n      Series Oversight Committee (Section 3.1) and subject to its\n\
    \      approval before final publication.\n   These responsibilities are defined\
    \ below, although the specific work\n   items under them are a matter for the\
    \ actual employment contract and\n   its Statement of Work (SOW).\n   The IAB\
    \ maintain its chartered responsibility as defined in\n   [RFC2850].  More details\
    \ on the oversight by the IAB via the RFC\n   Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)\
    \ can be found in Section 3.1.  For\n   example, the RSE does not have the direct\
    \ authority to hire or fire\n   RFC Editor contractors or personnel.\n"

    \ reports to the community at large,\n   providing email contact for policy questions\
    \ and inputs, and enabling\n   and participating in suitable on-line forums for\
    \ discussion of issues\n   related to the RFC Series.\n   Due to the history and\
    \ nature of the interaction between the RSE and\n   the IETF, certain principles,\
    \ described in the following subsections,\n   must be understood and adhered to\
    \ by the RSE in his or her\n   interactions with the community.  These apply to\

    \ identifying\n   materially concerned interest groups within the Internet community\n\
    \   and reaching out to them.  Those interest groups include at least the\n  \
    \ IETF community, the IRTF community, the network research community,\n   and\
    \ the network operations community.  Other interest groups might\n   also be materially\
    \ interested.\n   The RSE must consult with the community on policy issues.  The\

  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  Development of the RFC Series\n   In order to develop the RFC Series,\
    \ the RSE is expected to develop a\n   relationship with the Internet technical\
    \ community.  The Editor is\n   expected to engage with the Internet technical\
    \ community in a process\n   of articulating and refining a vision for the series\
    \ and its\n   continuous evolution.  The RSE is also expected to engage other\
    \ users\n   of the RFC Series, in particular, the consumers of these documents,\n\
    \   such as those people who use them to specify products, write code,\n   test\
    \ behaviors, or other related activities.\n   Concretely:\n      The RSE is responsible\
    \ for the coordination of discussion on\n      series evolution among the series'\
    \ stream participants and the\n      broader Internet technical community.\n \
    \     In time, the RSE is expected to develop and refine a vision for\n      the\

    \ best ways to evolve the\n         series for the benefit of the entire Internet\
    \ community.  As\n         such, the RSE may even consider evolution beyond the\
    \ historical\n         'by engineers for engineers' emphasis; and\n      -  Its\
    \ publication-technical environment, by looking at whether it\n         should\
    \ be slowly changing in terms of publishing and archiving\n         techniques\
    \ -- particularly to better serve the communities that\n         produce and depend\
    \ on the RFC Series.  For example, all of\n         those communities have been\
    \ slowly changing to include a\n         significant population of multi-lingual\
    \ individuals or non-\n         native speakers of English.  Another example is\
    \ that some of\n         these constituencies also have shifted to include significant\n\
    \         groups whose primary focus is on the constraints and\n         consequences\
    \ of network engineering, rather than a primary\n         interest in the engineering\
    \ issues themselves.\n   For this type of responsibility, the RSE cooperates closely\
    \ with the\n   community, and operates under oversight of the RSOC: thus,\n  \
    \ ultimately, under oversight of the IAB.\n"

  - "3.1.  RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)\n   The IAB is responsible for the\
    \ oversight of the RFC Series and acts\n   as a body for final conflict resolution,\
    \ including the process\n   described in Section 4.3.\n   In order to provide\
    \ continuity over periods longer than the NomCom\n   appointment cycle [RFC8713]\
    \ and assure that oversight includes\n   suitable subject matter expertise, the\
    \ IAB will establish a group\n   that implements oversight for the IAB, the RFC\
    \ Series Oversight\n   Committee (RSOC).\n   The RSOC will act with authority\
    \ delegated from the IAB: in general,\n   it will be the RSOC that will approve\
    \ consensus policy and vision\n   documents as developed by the RSE in collaboration\
    \ with the\n   community.  While it is expected that the IAB will exercise due\n\
    \   diligence in its supervision of the RSOC, the RSOC should be allowed\n   the\
    \ latitude to do its job without undue interference from the IAB.\n   Therefore,\
    \ it is expected that the IAB will accord RSOC reports and\n   recommendations\
    \ the benefit of the doubt.\n   For all decisions that affect the RSE individually\
    \ (e.g., hiring and\n   firing), the RSOC prepares recommendations for the IAB.\
    \  The final\n   recommendation to the IETF LLC is the responsibility of the IAB,\n\
    \   after discussion with RSOC on the recommendations.  For instance the\n   RSOC\
    \ would do the following:\n   *  perform annual reviews of the RSE and report\
    \ the result of these\n      reviews to the IAB.\n   *  manage RSE candidate selection\
    \ and advise the IAB on candidate\n      appointment (in other words, select the\
    \ RSE subject to IAB\n      approval).\n   RSOC members are expected to recognize\
    \ potential conflicts of\n   interest and behave accordingly.\n   For the actual\
    \ recruitment and selection of the RSE, the RSOC will\n   propose a budget for\
    \ the search process.  It will work with the IETF\n   LLC to refine that budget\
    \ and develop remuneration criteria and an\n   employment agreement or contracting\
    \ plans, as appropriate.\n   The RSOC will be responsible for ensuring that the\
    \ RFC Series is run\n   in a transparent and accountable manner.\n   The RSOC\
    \ shall develop and publish its own rules of order.\n   The initial RSOC was charged\
    \ with designing and executing a\n   solicitation, search, and selection process\
    \ for the first actual (not\n   transitional or \"acting\") RSE appointment. \
    \ That process involved\n   iteration on this and related documents and evaluation\
    \ of various\n   strategies and options.  During the creation of what became\n\
    \   [RFC6635], it was expected that the RSOC would describe the process\n   it\
    \ ultimately selected to the community.  The RSOC did involve the\n   community\
    \ in interim considerations when that was likely to be of\n   value.  Following\
    \ completion of the selection process, the RSOC will\n   determine the best way\
    \ to share information learned and experience\n   gained with the community and\
    \ determine how to best preserve that\n   information for future use.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  RSOC Composition\n   The RSOC will operate under the authority of the\

    \ RSE\n   relationships evolve.  The RSOC will include people who are not\n  \
    \ current IAB members.  Currently, this is aligned with the IAB program\n   structure.\
    \  The IAB will designate the membership of the RSOC with\n   the following goals:\
    \ preserving effective stability; keeping it small\n   enough to be effective,\
    \ and keeping it large enough to provide\n   general Internet community expertise,\
    \ specific IETF expertise,\n   publication expertise, and stream expertise.  Members\
    \ serve at the\n   pleasure of the IAB and are expected to bring a balance between\n\
    \   short- and long-term perspectives.  Specific input about, and\n   recommendations\
    \ of, members will be sought from the streams, the IETF\n   LLC, and the RSE.\n\
    \   In addition to the members from outside of the IAB appointed to the\n   RSOC,\
    \ IAB members may participate as full members of the RSOC.  Under\n   most circumstances,\
    \ there will be a specific individual IAB member\n   appointed by the IAB as the\
    \ program lead, who will be a full member\n   of the RSOC.  This member's role\
    \ is distinct from any RSOC-internal\n   organizational roles, such as would be\
    \ created by the RSOC choosing\n   to appoint a chair from among its members.\
    \  Other IAB members may\n   choose to be full members of the RSOC, with the consent\
    \ of the IAB.\n   This consent is primarily concerned with avoiding overpopulating\
    \ the\n   RSOC and providing it with relatively stable membership, which will\n\
    \   work best if it is not too large a committee.\n   The IETF LLC will appoint\
    \ an individual to serve as its liaison to\n   the RSOC.  The RSE and the IETF\

    \ the various streams to produce RFCs.\n   Disagreements may arise between these\
    \ entities during the execution\n   of the RFC Editor operations.  In particular,\
    \ different streams may\n   disagree with each other, or disagree with the RFC\
    \ Editor function.\n   Potentially, even the RSOC or the IETF LLC could find themselves\
    \ in\n   disagreement with some aspect of the RFC Editor operations.  Note\n \
    \  that disagreements between an author and the RFC Production Center\n   are\
    \ not cross-entity issues, and they are to be resolved by the RSE,\n   in accordance\
    \ with the rest of this document.\n   If such cross-entity disagreements arise,\
    \ the community would\n   generally hope that they can be resolved politely and\
    \ directly.\n   However, this is not always possible.  At that point, any relevant\n\
    \   party would first formally request a review and reconsideration of\n   the\
    \ decision.  If the party still disagrees after the\n   reconsideration, that\
    \ party may ask the RSE to decide or, especially\n   if the RSE is involved, the\
    \ party may ask the IAB Chair (for a\n   technical or procedural matter) to mediate\
    \ or appoint a mediator to\n   aid in the discussions, although he or she not\

    \ to reach a\n   mutually agreeable conclusion.  As noted below, any such issues\
    \ that\n   involve contractual matters must be brought to the attention of the\n\
    \   IETF LLC.  If the IAB Chair is asked to assist in resolving the\n   matter,\
    \ the Chair may ask for advice or seek assistance from anyone\n   the Chair deems\
    \ helpful.  The Chair may also alert any appropriate\n   individuals or organizations\
    \ to the existence of the issue.\n   If such a conclusion is not possible through\
    \ the above less formal\n   processes, then the matter must be registered with\
    \ the RFC Series\n   Oversight Committee.  The RSOC may choose to offer advice\
    \ to the RSE\n   or more general advice to the parties involved and may ask the\
    \ RSE to\n   defer a decision until it formulates its advice.  However, if a\n\
    \   timely decision cannot be reached through discussion, mediation, and\n   mutual\
    \ agreement, the RSE is expected to make whatever decisions are\n   needed to\
    \ ensure the smooth operation of the RFC Editor function;\n   those decisions\
    \ are final.\n   The RSE may make final decisions unilaterally only to assure\
    \ the\n   functioning of the process, and only while there is an evaluation of\n\
    \   current policies to determine whether they are appropriately\n   implemented\
    \ in the decision or need adjustment.  In particular, it\n   should be noted that\
    \ final decisions about the technical content of\n   individual documents are\
    \ the exclusive responsibility of the stream\n   approvers from which those documents\
    \ originate, as shown in the\n   illustration in Figure 1.\n   If informal agreements\
    \ cannot be reached, then formal RSOC review and\n   decision making may be required.\
    \  If so, the RSE must present the\n   issues involved to the community so that\
    \ the community is aware of\n   the situation.  The RSE will then report the issue\
    \ to the RSOC for\n   formal resolution by the RSOC with confirmation by the IAB\
    \ in its\n   oversight capacity.\n   IAB and community discussion of any patterns\
