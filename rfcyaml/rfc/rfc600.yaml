  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The PLATO IV System based at the University of Illinois at Urbana\
    \ is\n   a highly sophisticated and very powerful approach to Computer Aided\n\
    \   Instruction.  The PLATO IV system makes use of a plasma display\n   terminal\
    \ that is a unique device with capabilities not presently\n   found on computer\
    \ terminals.  A number of ARPA supported projects\n   intend to use the plasma\
    \ terminal on local connection to computer\n   resources or by long-distance connection\
    \ to the PLATO IV System.\n   One problem in using the PLATO System from any appreciable\
    \ distance,\n   is the communication costs involved (i.e. long-distance telephone\n\
    \   rates for many consecutive hours).  Also, use of the plasma terminal\n   in\
    \ other applications is hampered since the communications scheme\n   employed\
    \ in the PLATO System in non-standard.\n   One approach to reducing the communications\
    \ cost is to use the\n   ARPANET for the long-distance connection, since the Network\
    \ is\n   potentially one of the most reliable and cost effective means of\n  \
    \ transmitting computer data.  This approach is reasonable the is a\n   Network\
    \ node near the PLATO System, (the PDP-11/ANTS system at the\n   Center for Advanced\
    \ Computation at the University of Illinois at\n   Urbana) and with the increasing\
    \ number of TIPS and IMPS on the\n   ARPANET access is becomming easier ad more\
    \ widespread.\n   The plasma terminals are designed to be connected directly to\n\
    \   telephone lines using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation.  Using\n  \
    \ dedicated telephone lines, the plasma terminal may be run at a data\n   rate\
    \ of 1200 bits/sec in full-duplex operation.  Using dial-up lines,\n   the terminal\
    \ may be run with display information being received at\n   1200 bits/sec and\
    \ data to the computer being transmitted at 120\n   bits/sec using a reverse chanel\
    \ scheme.\n   The data and command words used by the plasma terminal differ for\n\
    \   input and output.  Input received from the computer arrives in 20-bit\n  \
    \ words plus one start bit.  Data transmitted to the computer is sent\n   in 11-bit\
    \ words plus one start bit.\n   In order to make the plasma terminal more generally\
    \ applicable for\n   standard communication, and specifically adapted to the ARPANET\n\
    \   connection by way of a TIP, the terminal must be interfaced in such a\n  \
    \ way as to communicate using Teletype-like codes.  In addition, if the\n   PLATO\
    \ System is to be linked by way of the Network with no changes to\n   the system,\
    \ then a special interface must be provided to allow the\n   Network to communicate\
    \ with the PLATO System using the FSK\n   communication scheme.\n"

  - "APPROACH\n   So that the plasma terminal would communicate like a Teletype when\n\
    \   tied to a TIP, and still be able to work with the PLATO System\n   through\
    \ the Network, it was decided to build an interface that could\n   be operated\
    \ in two modes.  There would be an \"ASCII\" mode to send and\n   receive Network\
    \ oriented data (such as TIP log-on or running at some\n   arbitrary Network site);\
    \ and a \"PLATO System\" mode to allow data,\n   imbedded in 8-bit codes, to pass\
    \ transparently through the Network.\n   Since there is a possibility that when\
    \ in the PLATO mode, re-\n   formatted codes can appear to be standard ACSII characters\
    \ that will\n   be seized upon by intervening TIPs or HOSTs, the interface must\n\
    \   insure that no recognizable codes be sent.  For example, the @ is\n   recognized\
    \ by a TIP as the beginning of a TIP command string.\n   Therefore the interface\
    \ must either \"double-up\" this code (@@) or not\n   send it at all.\n   With\
    \ the above requirement, and with other limitations, the proto-\n   type interface,\
    \ now in use at UCSB, operates as follows:\n   1. In ASCII mode, the plasma terminal\
    \ has been made to send and\n      receive 8-bit ASCII code.  In this mode, there\
    \ is no graphics\n      capability.  The keyboard that is provided can only send\
    \ 124\n      codes, therefore 4 seldom used ASCII codes have been excluded, and\n\
    \      certain ASCII characters cannot be displayed.\n   2. In PLATO mode, PLATO\
    \ data is embedded in 8-bit codes.  The\n      capability of running the keyboard\
    \ in ASCII mode while the display\n      remains in PLATO mode has also been provided.\n"

  - "SUBSEQUENT WORK\n      After discusion, it became clear that the flexability\
    \ of the\n      interface to do such things as emulate standard graphics\n   \
    \   terminals, implement a cursor, and to respond to Network Graphics\n      Protocols,\
    \ will be highly desirable.  So it has been decided that\n      the original hardware\
    \ will be re-packaged using a micro-computer\n      with a ROM for the control\
    \ program.  With the addition of more RAM\n      and/or ROM, the micro-computer\
    \ will have the capability of being\n      programmed to allow the plasma terminal\
    \ to do a wide variety of\n      tasks.  Work on developing this interface has\
    \ begun at UCSB.\n      Figure 1 shows the planned version of plasma data format\
