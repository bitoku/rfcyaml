  - "Abstract\n   This document presents use cases for diverse industries that have\
    \ in\n   common a need for \"deterministic flows\".  \"Deterministic\" in this\n\
    \   context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded\n   latency,\
    \ and other properties germane to the transport of time-\n   sensitive data. \
    \ These use cases differ notably in their network\n   topologies and specific\
    \ desired behavior, providing as a group broad\n   industry context for Deterministic\
    \ Networking (DetNet).  For each use\n   case, this document will identify the\
    \ use case, identify\n   representative solutions used today, and describe potential\n\
    \   improvements that DetNet can enable.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo documents use cases for diverse industries that\
    \ require\n   deterministic flows over multi-hop paths.  Deterministic Networking\n\
    \   (DetNet) flows can be established from either a Layer 2 or Layer 3\n   (IP)\
    \ interface, and such flows can coexist on an IP network with\n   best-effort\
    \ traffic.  DetNet also provides for highly reliable flows\n   through provision\
    \ for redundant paths.\n   The DetNet use cases explicitly do not suggest any\
    \ specific design\n   for DetNet architecture or protocols; these are topics for\
    \ other\n   DetNet documents.\n   The DetNet use cases, as originally submitted,\
    \ explicitly were not\n   considered by the DetNet Working Group (WG) to be concrete\n\
    \   requirements.  The DetNet WG and Design Team considered these use\n   cases,\
    \ identifying which of their elements could be feasibly\n   implemented within\
    \ the charter of DetNet; as a result, certain\n   originally submitted use cases\
    \ (or elements thereof) were moved to\n   Appendix A (\"Use Cases Explicitly Out\
    \ of Scope for DetNet\") of this\n   document.\n   This document provides context\
    \ regarding DetNet design decisions.  It\n   also serves a long-lived purpose\
    \ of helping those learning (or new\n   to) DetNet understand the types of applications\
    \ that can be supported\n   by DetNet.  It also allows those WG contributors who\
    \ are users to\n   ensure that their concerns are addressed by the WG; for them,\
    \ this\n   document (1) covers their contributions and (2) provides a long-term\n\
    \   reference regarding the problems that they expect will be served by\n   the\
    \ technology, in terms of the short-term deliverables and also as\n   the technology\
    \ evolves in the future.\n   This document has served as a \"yardstick\" against\
    \ which proposed\n   DetNet designs can be measured, answering the question \"\
    To what\n   extent does a proposed design satisfy these various use cases?\"\n\
    \   The industries covered by the use cases in this document are\n   o  professional\
    \ audio and video (Section 2)\n   o  electrical utilities (Section 3)\n   o  building\
    \ automation systems (BASs) (Section 4)\n   o  wireless for industrial applications\
    \ (Section 5)\n   o  cellular radio (Section 6)\n   o  industrial machine to machine\
    \ (M2M) (Section 7)\n   o  mining (Section 8)\n   o  private blockchain (Section\
    \ 9)\n   o  network slicing (Section 10)\n   For each use case, the following\
    \ questions are answered:\n   o  What is the use case?\n   o  How is it addressed\
    \ today?\n   o  How should it be addressed in the future?\n   o  What should the\
    \ IETF deliver to enable this use case?\n   The level of detail in each use case\
    \ is intended to be sufficient to\n   express the relevant elements of the use\
    \ case but no more than that.\n   DetNet does not directly address clock distribution\
    \ or time\n   synchronization; these are considered to be part of the overall\n\
    \   design and implementation of a time-sensitive network, using existing\n  \
    \ (or future) time-specific protocols (such as [IEEE-8021AS] and/or\n   [RFC5905]).\n\
    \   Section 11 enumerates the set of common properties implied by these\n   use\
    \ cases.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Use Case Description
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Use Case Description\n   The professional audio and video industry (\"\
    ProAV\") includes:\n   o  Music and film content creation\n   o  Broadcast\n \
    \  o  Cinema\n   o  Live sound\n   o  Public address, media, and emergency systems\
    \ at large venues\n      (e.g., airports, stadiums, churches, theme parks)\n \
    \  These industries have already transitioned audio and video signals\n   from\
    \ analog to digital.  However, the digital interconnect systems\n   remain primarily\
    \ point to point, with a single signal or a small\n   number of signals per link,\
    \ interconnected with purpose-built\n   hardware.\n   These industries are now\
    \ transitioning to packet-based\n   infrastructures to reduce cost, increase routing\
    \ flexibility, and\n   integrate with existing IT infrastructures.\n   Today,\
    \ ProAV applications have no way to establish deterministic\n   flows from a standards-based\
    \ Layer 3 (IP) interface; this is a\n   fundamental limitation of the use cases\
    \ described here.  Today,\n   deterministic flows can be created within standards-based\
    \ Layer 2\n   LANs (e.g., using IEEE 802.1 TSN (\"TSN\" stands for \"Time-Sensitive\n\
    \   Networking\")); however, these flows are not routable via IP and thus\n  \
    \ are not effective for distribution over wider areas (for example,\n   broadcast\
    \ events that span wide geographical areas).\n   It would be highly desirable\
    \ if such flows could be routed over the\n   open Internet; however, solutions\
    \ of more-limited scope (e.g.,\n   enterprise networks) would still provide substantial\
    \ improvements.\n   The following sections describe specific ProAV use cases.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Uninterrupted Stream Playback
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Uninterrupted Stream Playback\n   Transmitting audio and video streams\
    \ for live playback is unlike\n   common file transfer in that uninterrupted stream\
    \ playback in the\n   presence of network errors cannot be achieved by retrying\
    \ the\n   transmission; by the time the missing or corrupt packet has been\n \
    \  identified, it is too late to execute a retry operation.  Buffering\n   can\
    \ be used to provide enough delay to allow time for one or more\n   retries; however,\
    \ this is not an effective solution in applications\n   where large delays (latencies)\
    \ are not acceptable (as discussed\n   below).\n   Streams with guaranteed bandwidth\
    \ can eliminate congestion on the\n   network as a cause of transmission errors\
    \ that would lead to playback\n   interruption.  The use of redundant paths can\
    \ further mitigate\n   transmission errors and thereby provide greater stream\
    \ reliability.\n   Additional techniques, such as Forward Error Correction (FEC),\
    \ can\n   also be used to improve stream reliability.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Synchronized Stream Playback
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Synchronized Stream Playback\n   Latency in this context is the time\
    \ between when a signal is\n   initially sent over a stream and when it is received.\
    \  A common\n   example in ProAV is time-synchronizing audio and video when they\
    \ take\n   separate paths through the playback system.  In this case, the\n  \
    \ latency of both the audio stream and the video stream must be bounded\n   and\
    \ consistent if the sound is to remain matched to the movement in\n   the video.\
    \  A common tolerance for audio/video synchronization is one\n   National Television\
    \ System Committee (NTSC) video frame (about\n   33 ms); to maintain the audience's\

  - "3.1.1.1.6.  Current Differential Protection Scheme\n   Current differential protection\
    \ is commonly used for line protection\n   and is typically used to protect parallel\
    \ circuits.  At both ends of\n   the lines, the current is measured by the differential\
    \ relays; both\n   relays will trip the circuit breaker if the current going into\
    \ the\n   line does not equal the current going out of the line.  This type of\n\
    \   protection scheme assumes that some form of communication is present\n   between\
    \ the relays at both ends of the line, to allow both relays to\n   compare measured\
    \ current values.  Line differential protection\n   schemes assume that the telecommunications\
    \ delay between both relays\n   is very low -- often as low as 5 ms.  Moreover,\
    \ as those systems are\n   often not time-synchronized, they also assume that\
    \ the delay over\n   symmetric telecommunications paths is constant; this allows\
    \ the\n   comparison of current measurement values taken at exactly the\n   same\

  - "3.1.1.3.  Wide-Area Monitoring and Control Systems\n   The application of synchrophasor\
    \ measurement data from Phasor\n   Measurement Units (PMUs) to wide-area monitoring\
    \ and control systems\n   promises to provide important new capabilities for improving\
    \ system\n   stability.  Access to PMU data enables more-timely situational\n\
    \   awareness over larger portions of the grid than what has been\n   possible\
    \ historically with normal SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data\n   Acquisition)\
    \ data.  Handling the volume and the real-time nature of\n   synchrophasor data\
    \ presents unique challenges for existing\n   application architectures.  The\
    \ Wide-Area Management System (WAMS)\n   makes it possible for the condition of\
    \ the bulk power system to be\n   observed and understood in real time so that\
    \ protective,\n   preventative, or corrective action can be taken.  Because of\
    \ the very\n   high sampling rate of measurements and the strict requirement for\n\

  - "3.1.2.2.1.  Intra-domain Network Considerations\n   A wind turbine is composed\
    \ of a large set of subsystems, including\n   sensors and actuators that require\
    \ time-critical operation.  The\n   reliability and latency constraints of these\
    \ different subsystems are\n   shown in Table 11.  These subsystems are connected\
    \ to an intra-domain\n   network that is used to monitor and control the operation\
    \ of the\n   turbine and connect it to the SCADA subsystems.  The different\n\
    \   components are interconnected using fiber optics, industrial buses,\n   industrial\
    \ Ethernet, EtherCAT [EtherCAT], or a combination thereof.\n   Industrial signaling\
    \ and control protocols such as Modbus [MODBUS],\n   PROFIBUS [PROFIBUS], PROFINET\
    \ [PROFINET], and EtherCAT are used\n   directly on top of the Layer 2 transport\
    \ or encapsulated over TCP/IP.\n   The data collected from the sensors and condition-monitoring\
    \ systems\n   is multiplexed onto fiber cables for transmission to the base of\
    \ the\n   tower and to remote control centers.  The turbine controller\n   continuously\
    \ monitors the condition of the wind turbine and collects\n   statistics on its\
    \ operation.  This controller also manages a large\n   number of switches, hydraulic\
    \ pumps, valves, and motors within the\n   wind turbine.\n   There is usually\
    \ a controller at the bottom of the tower and also in\n   the nacelle.  The communication\
    \ between these two controllers usually\n   takes place using fiber optics instead\
    \ of copper links.  Sometimes, a\n   third controller is installed in the hub\
    \ of the rotor and manages the\n   pitch of the blades.  That unit usually communicates\
    \ with the nacelle\n   unit using serial communications.\n"

    \ via firewalls at\n   both ends.  The Autonomous System (AS) path between the\
    \ local control\n   center and the wind park typically involves several ISPs at\

    \                Figure 2: Wind Turbine Control via Internet\n   The remote control\
    \ center is part of the SCADA system, setting the\n   desired power output to\
    \ the wind park and reading back the result\n   once the new power output level\
    \ has been set.  Traffic between the\n   remote control center and the wind park\
    \ typically consists of\n   protocols like IEC 60870-5-104 [IEC-60870-5-104],\
    \ OPC XML-Data Access\n   (XML-DA) [OPCXML], Modbus [MODBUS], and SNMP [RFC3411].\
    \  At the time\n   of this writing, traffic flows between the remote control center\
    \ and\n   the wind park are best effort.  QoS requirements are not strict, so\n\
    \   no Service Level Agreements (SLAs) or service-provisioning mechanisms\n  \
    \ (e.g., VPNs) are employed.  In the case of such events as equipment\n   failure,\
    \ tolerance for alarm delay is on the order of minutes, due to\n   redundant systems\
    \ already in place.\n   Future use cases will require bounded latency, bounded\
    \ jitter, and\n   extraordinarily low packet loss for inter-domain traffic flows\
    \ due to\n   the softwarization and virtualization of core wind-park equipment\n\
    \   (e.g., switches, firewalls, and SCADA server components).  These\n   factors\
    \ will create opportunities for service providers to install\n   new services\
    \ and dynamically manage them from remote locations.  For\n   example, to enable\
    \ failover of a local SCADA server, a SCADA server\n   in another wind-park site\
    \ (under the administrative control of the\n   same operator) could be utilized\
    \ temporarily (Figure 3).  In that\n   case, local traffic would be forwarded\
    \ to the remote SCADA server,\n   and existing intra-domain QoS and timing parameters\
    \ would have to be\n   met for inter-domain traffic flows.\n   +--------------+\n\

  - "3.1.3.1.  Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration (FLISR)\n   \"Fault\
    \ Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration (FLISR)\" refers\n   to the ability\
    \ to automatically locate the fault, isolate the fault,\n   and restore service\
    \ in the distribution network.  This will likely\n   be the first widespread application\
    \ of distributed intelligence in\n   the grid.\n   The static power-switch status\
    \ (open/closed) in the network dictates\n   the power flow to secondary substations.\
    \  Reconfiguring the network\n   in the event of a fault is typically done manually\
    \ on site to\n   energize/de-energize alternate paths.  Automating the operation\
    \ of\n   substation switchgear allows the flow of power to be altered\n   automatically\
    \ under fault conditions.\n   FLISR can be managed centrally from a Distribution\

    \ and control devices are already targets for cyber\n   attacks, and legacy telecommunications\
    \ protocols have many intrinsic\n   network-related vulnerabilities.  For example,\
    \ the Distributed\n   Network Protocol (DNP3) [IEEE-1815], Modbus, PROFIBUS/PROFINET,\
    \ and\n   other protocols are designed around a common paradigm of \"request and\n\
    \   respond\".  Each protocol is designed for a master device such as an\n   HMI\
    \ (Human-Machine Interface) system to send commands to subordinate\n   slave devices\
    \ to perform data retrieval (reading inputs) or control\n   functions (writing\
    \ to outputs).  Because many of these protocols lack\n   authentication, encryption,\
    \ or other basic security measures, they\n   are prone to network-based attacks,\
    \ allowing a malicious actor or\n   attacker to utilize the request-and-respond\
    \ system as a mechanism for\n   functionality similar to command and control.\
    \  Specific security\n   concerns common to most industrial-control protocols\
    \ (including\n   utility telecommunications protocols) include the following:\n\
    \   o  Network or transport errors (e.g., malformed packets or excessive\n   \
    \   latency) can cause protocol failure.\n   o  Protocol commands may be available\
    \ that are capable of forcing\n      slave devices into inoperable states, including\
    \ powering devices\n      off, forcing them into a listen-only state, or disabling\
    \ alarming.\n   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of\n  \
    \    interrupting processes (e.g., restarting communications).\n   o  Protocol\
    \ commands may be available that are capable of clearing,\n      erasing, or resetting\
    \ diagnostic information such as counters and\n      diagnostic registers.\n \
    \  o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of requesting\n    \
    \  sensitive information about the controllers, their configurations,\n      or\
    \ other need-to-know information.\n   o  Most protocols are application-layer\
    \ protocols transported over\n      TCP; it is therefore easy to transport commands\
    \ over non-standard\n      ports or inject commands into authorized traffic flows.\n\
    \   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of\n      broadcasting\
    \ messages to many devices at once (i.e., a\n      potential DoS).\n   o  Protocol\
    \ commands may be available that will query the device\n      network to obtain\
    \ defined points and their values (i.e., perform a\n      configuration scan).\n\
    \   o  Protocol commands may be available that will list all available\n     \
    \ function codes (i.e., perform a function scan).\n   These inherent vulnerabilities,\
    \ along with increasing connectivity\n   between IT and OT networks, make network-based\
    \ attacks very feasible.\n   By injecting malicious protocol commands, an attacker\
    \ could take\n   control over the target process.  Altering legitimate protocol\n\
    \   traffic can also alter information about a process and disrupt the\n   legitimate\
    \ controls that are in place over that process.  A\n   man-in-the-middle attack\
    \ could result in (1) improper control over a\n   process and (2) misrepresentation\
    \ of data that is sent back to\n   operator consoles.\n"

    \ often have very large private telecommunications networks\n   that can cover\
    \ an entire territory/country.  Until now, the main\n   purposes of these networks\
    \ have been to (1) support transmission\n   network monitoring, control, and automation,\
    \ (2) support remote\n   control of generation sites, and (3) provide FCAPS (Fault,\n\
    \   Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security) services from\n   centralized\

    \   voice and data services for tens of thousands of employees and for\n   exchanges\
    \ with neighboring interconnections, and administrative\n   services.  To meet\

  contents:
  - "3.3.2.3.  Precision Time Protocol\n   Some utilities do not use GPS clocks in\
    \ generation substations.  One\n   of the main reasons is that some of the generation\
    \ plants are 30 to\n   50 meters deep underground and the GPS signal can be weak\
    \ and\n   unreliable.  Instead, atomic clocks are used.  Clocks are\n   synchronized\
    \ amongst each other.  Rubidium clocks provide clock and\n   1 ms timestamps for\
    \ IRIG-B.\n   Some companies plan to transition to PTP [IEEE-1588], distributing\n\
    \   the synchronization signal over the IP/MPLS network.  PTP provides a\n   mechanism\
    \ for synchronizing the clocks of participating nodes to a\n   high degree of\
    \ accuracy and precision.\n   PTP operates based on the following assumptions:\n\
    \   o  The network eliminates cyclic forwarding of PTP messages within\n     \
    \ each communication path (e.g., by using a spanning tree protocol).\n   o  PTP\
    \ is tolerant of an occasional missed message, duplicated\n      message, or message\
    \ that arrived out of order.  However, PTP\n      assumes that such impairments\
    \ are relatively rare.\n   o  As designed, PTP expects a multicast communication\
    \ model; however,\n      PTP also supports a unicast communication model as long\
    \ as the\n      behavior of the protocol is preserved.\n   o  Like all message-based\
    \ time transfer protocols, PTP time accuracy\n      is degraded by delay asymmetry\
    \ in the paths taken by event\n      messages.  PTP cannot detect asymmetry, but\
    \ if such delays are\n      known a priori, time values can be adjusted to correct\
    \ for\n      asymmetry.\n   The use of PTP for power automation is defined in\n\
    \   IEC/IEEE 61850-9-3:2016 [IEC-IEEE-61850-9-3:2016].  It is based on\n   Annex\
    \ B of IEC 62439-3:2016 [IEC-62439-3:2016], which offers the\n   support of redundant\
    \ attachment of clocks to Parallel Redundancy\n   Protocol (PRP) and High-availability\

    \   o  Integration of distributed energy resources\n   o  Proliferation of digital\

    \ devices is driving the need for a converged\n   security infrastructure for\
    \ all participants in the smart grid,\n   including utilities, energy service\
    \ providers, large commercial and\n   industrial customers, and residential customers.\
    \  Securing the assets\n   of electric power delivery systems (from the control\
    \ center to the\n   substation, to the feeders and down to customer meters) requires\
    \ an\n   end-to-end security infrastructure that protects the myriad of\n   telecommunications\
    \ assets used to operate, monitor, and control power\n   flow and measurement.\n\
    \   \"Cybersecurity\" refers to all the security issues in automation and\n  \
    \ telecommunications that affect any functions related to the operation\n   of\
    \ the electric power systems.  Specifically, it involves the\n   concepts of:\n\
    \   o  Integrity: data cannot be altered undetectably\n   o  Authenticity (data\
    \ origin authentication): the telecommunications\n      parties involved must\
    \ be validated as genuine\n   o  Authorization: only requests and commands from\
    \ authorized users\n      can be accepted by the system\n   o  Confidentiality:\
    \ data must not be accessible to any\n      unauthenticated users\n   When designing\
    \ and deploying new smart-grid devices and\n   telecommunications systems, it\
    \ is imperative to understand the\n   various impacts of these new components\
    \ under a variety of attack\n   situations on the power grid.  The consequences\
    \ of a cyber attack on\n   the grid telecommunications network can be catastrophic.\
    \  This is why\n   security for the smart grid is not just an ad hoc feature or\
    \ product;\n   it's a complete framework integrating both physical and cybersecurity\n\
    \   requirements and covering the entire smart-grid networks from\n   generation\
    \ to distribution.  Security has therefore become one of the\n   main foundations\
    \ of the utility telecom network architecture and must\n   be considered at every\
    \ layer with a defense-in-depth approach.\n   Migrating to IP-based protocols\
    \ is key to addressing these challenges\n   for two reasons:\n   o  IP enables\
    \ a rich set of features and capabilities to enhance the\n      security posture.\n\
    \   o  IP is based on open standards; this allows interoperability\n      between\
    \ different vendors and products, driving down the costs\n      associated with\
    \ implementing security solutions in OT networks.\n   Securing OT telecommunications\
    \ over packet-switched IP networks\n   follows the same principles that are foundational\
    \ for securing the IT\n   infrastructure, i.e., consideration must be given to\
    \ (1) enforcing\n   electronic access control for both person-to-machine and machine-to-\n\

    \ can be best\n   effort.\n   An HMI is typically a desktop PC used by operators\
    \ to monitor and\n   display device states, send device control commands to Local\n\

    \  Figure 5: BAS Deployment Model for Medium/Large Buildings\n   Each LC is connected\
    \ to the monitoring room via the management\n   network, and the management functions\
    \ are performed within the\n   building.  In most cases, Fast Ethernet (e.g.,\
    \ 100BASE-T) is used for\n   the management network.  Since the management network\
    \ is not a\n   real-time network, the use of Ethernet without QoS is sufficient\
    \ for\n   today's deployments.\n   Many physical interfaces used in field networks\
    \ have specific timing\n   requirements -- for example, RS232C and RS485.  Thus,\
    \ if a field\n   network is to be replaced with an Ethernet or wireless network,\
    \ such\n   networks must support time-critical deterministic flows.\n   Figure\

  - "5.1.  Use Case Description\n   Wireless networks are useful for industrial applications\
    \ -- for\n   example, (1) when portable, fast-moving, or rotating objects are\n\
    \   involved and (2) for the resource-constrained devices found in the\n   Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT).\n   Such network-connected sensors, actuators, control loops,\
    \ etc.\n   typically require that the underlying network support real-time QoS,\n\
    \   as well as such specific network properties as reliability,\n   redundancy,\
    \ and security.\n   These networks may also contain very large numbers of devices\
    \ -- for\n   example, for factories, \"big data\" acquisition, and the IoT.  Given\n\
    \   the large numbers of devices installed and the potential\n   pervasiveness\
    \ of the IoT, this is a huge and very cost-sensitive\n   market such that small\
    \ cost reductions can save large amounts of\n   money.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Network Convergence Using 6TiSCH\n   Some wireless network technologies\
    \ support real-time QoS and are thus\n   useful for these kinds of networks, but\
    \ others do not.\n   This use case focuses on one specific wireless network technology\n\
    \   that provides the required deterministic QoS: \"IPv6 over the TSCH\n   mode\
    \ of IEEE 802.15.4e\" (6TiSCH, where \"TSCH\" stands for\n   \"Time-Slotted Channel\
    \ Hopping\"; see [Arch-for-6TiSCH], [IEEE-802154],\n   and [RFC7554]).\n   There\
    \ are other deterministic wireless buses and networks available\n   today; however,\
    \ they are incompatible with each other and with IP\n   traffic (for example,\
    \ see [ISA100] and [WirelessHART]).\n   Thus, the primary goal of this use case\
    \ is to apply 6TiSCH as a\n   converged IP-based and standards-based wireless\
    \ network for\n   industrial applications, i.e., to replace multiple proprietary\
    \ and/or\n   incompatible wireless networking and wireless network management\n\
    \   standards.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Common Protocol Development for 6TiSCH
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Common Protocol Development for 6TiSCH\n   Today, there are a number\
    \ of protocols required by 6TiSCH that are\n   still in development.  Another\
    \ goal of this use case is to highlight\n   the ways in which these \"missing\"\
    \ protocols share goals in common\n   with DetNet.  Thus, it is possible that\
    \ some of the protocol\n   technology developed for DetNet will also be applicable\
    \ to 6TiSCH.\n   These protocol goals are identified here, along with their\n\
    \   relationship to DetNet.  It is likely that ultimately the resulting\n   protocols\
    \ will not be identical but will share design principles that\n   contribute to\
    \ the efficiency of enabling both DetNet and 6TiSCH.\n   One such commonality\
    \ is that -- although on a different time scale --\n   in both TSN [IEEE-8021TSNTG]\
    \ and TSCH, a packet that crosses the\n   network from node to node follows a\
    \ precise schedule, as does a train\n   that leaves intermediate stations at precise\
    \ times along its path.\n   This kind of operation reduces collisions, saves energy,\
    \ and enables\n   engineering of the network for deterministic properties.\n \
    \  Another commonality is remote monitoring and scheduling management of\n   a\
    \ TSCH network by a Path Computation Element (PCE) and Network\n   Management\
    \ Entity (NME).  The PCE and NME manage timeslots and device\n   resources in\
    \ a manner that minimizes the interaction with, and the\n   load placed on, resource-constrained\
    \ devices.  For example, a tiny\n   IoT device may have just enough buffers to\
    \ store one or a few IPv6\n   packets; it will have limited bandwidth between\
    \ peers such that it\n   can maintain only a small amount of peer information,\
    \ and it will not\n   be able to store many packets waiting to be forwarded. \
    \ It is\n   advantageous, then, for the IoT device to only be required to carry\n\
    \   out the specific behavior assigned to it by the PCE and NME (as\n   opposed\
    \ to maintaining its own IP stack, for example).\n   It is possible that there\
    \ will be some peer-to-peer communication;\n   for example, the PCE may communicate\
    \ only indirectly with some\n   devices in order to enable hierarchical configuration\
    \ of the system.\n   6TiSCH depends on [PCE] and [DetNet-Arch].\n   6TiSCH also\
    \ depends on the fact that DetNet will maintain consistency\n   with [IEEE-8021TSNTG].\n"

  contents:
  - "5.3.2.1.  PCE Commands and 6TiSCH CoAP Requests\n   The 6TiSCH device does not\
    \ expect to place the request for bandwidth\n   between itself and another device\
    \ in the network.  Rather, an\n   operation control system invoked through a human\
    \ interface specifies\n   the traffic requirements and the end nodes (in terms\
    \ of latency and\n   reliability).  Based on this information, the PCE must compute\
    \ a path\n   between the end nodes and provision the network with per-flow state\n\
    \   that describes the per-hop operation for a given packet, the\n   corresponding\
    \ timeslots, the flow identification that enables\n   recognizing that a certain\
    \ packet belongs to a certain path, etc.\n   For a static configuration that serves\
    \ a certain purpose for a long\n   period of time, it is expected that a node\
    \ will be provisioned in one\n   shot with a full schedule, i.e., a schedule that\
    \ defines the behavior\n   of the node with respect to all data flows through\
    \ that node. 6TiSCH\n   expects that the programming of the schedule will be done\
    \ over the\n   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as discussed in\n   [CoAP-6TiSCH].\n\
    \   6TiSCH expects that the PCE commands will be mapped back and forth\n   into\
    \ CoAP by a gateway function at the edge of the 6TiSCH network.\n   For instance,\
    \ it is possible that a mapping entity on the backbone\n   transforms a non-CoAP\
    \ protocol such as the Path Computation Element\n   Communication Protocol (PCEP)\
    \ into the RESTful interfaces that the\n   6TiSCH devices support.  This architecture\
    \ will be refined to comply\n   with DetNet [DetNet-Arch] when the work is formalized.\
    \  Related\n   information about 6TiSCH can be found in [Interface-6TiSCH-6top]\
    \ and\n   [RFC6550] (\"RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy\n  \
    \ Networks\").\n   A protocol may be used to update the state in the devices during\n\
    \   runtime -- for example, if it appears that a path through the network\n  \
    \ has ceased to perform as expected, but in 6TiSCH that flow was not\n   designed\
    \ and no protocol was selected.  DetNet should define the\n   appropriate end-to-end\
    \ protocols to be used in that case.  The\n   implication is that these state\
    \ updates take place once the system is\n   configured and running, i.e., they\
    \ are not limited to the initial\n   communication of the configuration of the\
    \ system.\n   A \"slotFrame\" is the base object that a PCE would manipulate to\n\
    \   program a schedule into an LLN node [Arch-for-6TiSCH].\n   The PCE should\
    \ read energy data from devices and compute paths that\n   will implement policies\
    \ on how energy in devices is consumed -- for\n   instance, to ensure that the\
    \ spent energy does not exceed the\n   available energy over a period of time.\
    \  Note that this statement\n   implies that an extensible protocol for communicating\
    \ device\n   information to the PCE and enabling the PCE to act on it will be\
    \ part\n   of the DetNet architecture; however, for subnets with specific\n  \
    \ protocols (e.g., CoAP), a gateway may be required.\n   6TiSCH devices can discover\
    \ their neighbors over the radio using a\n   mechanism such as beacons, but even\
    \ though the neighbor information\n   is available in the 6TiSCH interface data\
    \ model, 6TiSCH does not\n   describe a protocol to proactively push the neighbor\
    \ information to a\n   PCE.  DetNet should define such a protocol; one possible\
    \ design\n   alternative is that it could operate over CoAP.  Alternatively, it\n\
    \   could be converted to/from CoAP by a gateway.  Such a protocol could\n   carry\
    \ multiple metrics -- for example, metrics similar to those used\n   for RPL operations\

- title: 6.1.2.  Delay Constraints
  contents:
  - "6.1.2.  Delay Constraints\n   The available processing time for Fronthaul networking\
    \ overhead is\n   limited to the available time after the baseband processing\
    \ of the\n   radio frame has completed.  For example, in Long Term Evolution (LTE)\n\
    \   radio, 3 ms is allocated for the processing of a radio frame, but\n   typically\
    \ the baseband processing uses most of it, allowing only a\n   small fraction\
    \ to be used by the Fronthaul network.  In this example,\n   out of 3 ms, the\
    \ maximum time allocated to the Fronthaul network for\n   one-way delay is 250\
    \ us, and the existing specification [NGMN-Fronth]\n   specifies a maximum delay\
    \ of only 100 us.  This ultimately determines\n   the distance the RRHs can be\
    \ located from the base stations (e.g.,\n   100 us equals roughly 20 km of optical\
    \ fiber-based transport).\n   Allocation options regarding the available time\
    \ budget between\n   processing and transport are currently undergoing heavy discussion\
    \ in\n   the mobile industry.\n   For packet-based transport, the allocated transport\
    \ time between the\n   RRH and the BBU is consumed by node processing, buffering,\
    \ and\n   distance-incurred delay.  An example of the allocated transport time\n\
    \   is 100 us (from the Common Public Radio Interface [CPRI]).\n   The baseband\
    \ processing time and the available \"delay budget\" for the\n   Fronthaul is\
    \ likely to change in the forthcoming \"5G\" due to reduced\n   radio round-trip\
    \ times and other architectural and service\n   requirements [NGMN].\n   The transport\
    \ time budget, as noted above, places limitations on the\n   distance that RRHs\
    \ can be located from base stations (i.e., the link\n   length).  In the above\
    \ analysis, it is assumed that the entire\n   transport time budget is available\
    \ for link propagation delay.\n   However, the transport time budget can be broken\
    \ down into three\n   components: scheduling/queuing delay, transmission delay,\
    \ and link\n   propagation delay.  Using today's Fronthaul networking technology,\n\
    \   the queuing, scheduling, and transmission components might become the\n  \
    \ dominant factors in the total transport time, rather than the link\n   propagation\
    \ delay.  This is especially true in cases where the\n   Fronthaul link is relatively\
    \ short and is shared among multiple\n   Fronthaul flows -- for example, in indoor\
    \ and small-cell networks,\n   massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna\
    \ networks, and\n   split Fronthaul architectures.\n   DetNet technology can improve\
    \ Fronthaul networks by controlling and\n   reducing the time required for the\
    \ queuing, scheduling, and\n   transmission operations by properly assigning network\
    \ resources, thus\n   (1) leaving more of the transport time budget available\
    \ for link\n   propagation and (2) enabling longer link lengths.  However, link\n\
    \   length is usually a predetermined parameter and is not a controllable\n  \
    \ network parameter, since RRH and BBU sites are usually located in\n   predetermined\
    \ locations.  However, the number of antennas in an RRH\n   site might increase\
    \ -- for example, by adding more antennas,\n   increasing the MIMO capability\
    \ of the network, or adding support for\n   massive MIMO.  This means increasing\
    \ the number of Fronthaul flows\n   sharing the same Fronthaul link.  DetNet can\
    \ now control the\n   bandwidth assignment of the Fronthaul link and the scheduling\
    \ of\n   Fronthaul packets over this link and can provide adequate buffer\n  \
    \ provisioning for each flow to reduce the packet loss rate.\n   Another way in\
    \ which DetNet technology can aid Fronthaul networks is\n   by providing effective\
    \ isolation between flows -- for example,\n   between flows originating in different\
    \ slices within a network-sliced\n   5G network.  Note, however, that this isolation\
    \ applies to DetNet\n   flows for which resources have been preallocated, i.e.,\
    \ it does not\n   apply to best-effort flows within a DetNet.  DetNet technology\
    \ can\n   also dynamically control the bandwidth-assignment, scheduling, and\n\
    \   packet-forwarding decisions, as well as the buffer provisioning of\n   the\
    \ Fronthaul flows to guarantee the end-to-end delay of the\n   Fronthaul packets\
    \ and minimize the packet loss rate.\n   [METIS] documents the fundamental challenges\
    \ as well as overall\n   technical goals of the future 5G mobile and wireless\
    \ systems as the\n   starting point.  These future systems should support much\
    \ higher data\n   volumes and rates and significantly lower end-to-end latency\
    \ for 100x\n   more connected devices (at cost and energy-consumption levels similar\n\
    \   to today's systems).\n   For Midhaul connections, delay constraints are driven\
    \ by inter-site\n   radio functions such as Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) processing\n\
    \   (see [CoMP]).  CoMP reception and transmission constitute a framework\n  \
    \ in which multiple geographically distributed antenna nodes cooperate\n   to\
    \ improve performance for the users served in the common cooperation\n   area.\
    \  The design principle of CoMP is to extend single-cell-to-\n   multi-UE (User\
    \ Equipment) transmission to a multi-cell-to-multi-UE\n   transmission via cooperation\
    \ among base stations.\n   CoMP has delay-sensitive performance parameters: \"\
    Midhaul latency\"\n   and \"CSI (Channel State Information) reporting and accuracy\"\
    .  The\n   essential feature of CoMP is signaling between eNBs, so Midhaul\n \
    \  latency is the dominating limitation of CoMP performance.  Generally,\n   CoMP\
    \ can benefit from coordinated scheduling (either distributed or\n   centralized)\
    \ of different cells if the signaling delay between eNBs\n   is within 1-10 ms.\
    \  This delay requirement is both rigid and\n   absolute, because any uncertainty\
    \ in delay will degrade performance\n   significantly.\n   Inter-site CoMP is\
    \ one of the key requirements for 5G and is also a\n   goal for 4.5G network architectures.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.1.3.  Time-Synchronization Constraints\n   Fronthaul time-synchronization requirements\
    \ are given by [TS25104],\n   [TS36104], [TS36211], and [TS36133].  These can\
    \ be summarized for the\n   3GPP LTE-based networks as:\n   Delay accuracy:\n\
    \      +-8 ns (i.e., +-1/32 Tc, where Tc is the Universal Mobile\n      Telecommunications\
    \ System (UMTS) Chip time of 1/3.84 MHz),\n      resulting in a round-trip accuracy\
    \ of +-16 ns.  The value is this\n      low in order to meet the 3GPP Timing Alignment\
    \ Error (TAE)\n      measurement requirements.  Note that performance guarantees\
    \ of\n      low-nanosecond values such as these are considered to be below the\n\
    \      DetNet layer -- it is assumed that the underlying implementation\n    \
    \  (e.g., the hardware) will provide sufficient support (e.g.,\n      buffering)\
    \ to enable this level of accuracy.  These values are\n      maintained in the\
    \ use case to give an indication of the overall\n      application.\n   TAE:\n\
    \      TAE is problematic for Fronthaul networks and must be minimized.\n    \
    \  If the transport network cannot guarantee TAE levels that are low\n      enough,\
    \ then additional buffering has to be introduced at the\n      edges of the network\
    \ to buffer out the jitter.  Buffering is not\n      desirable, as it reduces\
    \ the total available delay budget.\n      Packet Delay Variation (PDV) requirements\
    \ can be derived from TAE\n      measurements for packet-based Fronthaul networks.\n\
    \      *  For MIMO or TX diversity transmissions, at each carrier\n         frequency,\
    \ TAE measurements shall not exceed 65 ns (i.e.,\n         1/4 Tc).\n      * \
    \ For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without\n         MIMO\
    \ or TX diversity, TAE measurements shall not exceed 130 ns\n         (i.e., 1/2\
    \ Tc).\n      *  For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, with or\n\
    \         without MIMO or TX diversity, TAE measurements shall not exceed\n  \
    \       260 ns (i.e., 1 Tc).\n      *  For inter-band carrier aggregation, with\
    \ or without MIMO or TX\n         diversity, TAE measurements shall not exceed\
    \ 260 ns.\n   Transport link contribution to radio frequency errors:\n      +-2\
    \ PPB.  This value is considered to be \"available\" for the\n      Fronthaul\
    \ link out of the total 50 PPB budget reserved for the\n      radio interface.\
    \  Note that the transport link contributes to\n      radio frequency errors for\
    \ the following reason: at the time of\n      this writing, Fronthaul communication\
    \ is direct communication from\n      the radio unit to the RRH.  The RRH is essentially\
    \ a passive\n      device (e.g., without buffering).  The transport drives the\n\
    \      antenna directly by feeding it with samples, and everything the\n     \
    \ transport adds will be introduced to the radio \"as is\".  So, if\n      the\
    \ transport causes any additional frequency errors, the errors\n      will show\
    \ up immediately on the radio as well.  Note that\n      performance guarantees\
    \ of low-nanosecond values such as these are\n      considered to be below the\
    \ DetNet layer -- it is assumed that the\n      underlying implementation (e.g.,\
    \ the hardware) will provide\n      sufficient support to enable this level of\
    \ performance.  These\n      values are maintained in the use case to give an\
    \ indication of the\n      overall application.\n   The above-listed time-synchronization\
    \ requirements are difficult to\n   meet with point-to-point connected networks\
    \ and are more difficult to\n   meet when the network includes multiple hops.\
    \  It is expected that\n   networks must include buffering at the ends of the\
    \ connections as\n   imposed by the jitter requirements, since trying to meet\
    \ the jitter\n   requirements in every intermediate node is likely to be too costly.\n\
    \   However, every measure to reduce jitter and delay on the path makes\n   it\
    \ easier to meet the end-to-end requirements.\n   In order to meet the timing\
    \ requirements, both senders and receivers\n   must remain time synchronized,\
    \ demanding very accurate clock\n   distribution -- for example, support for IEEE\
    \ 1588 transparent clocks\n   or boundary clocks in every intermediate node.\n\
    \   In cellular networks from the LTE radio era onward, phase\n   synchronization\
    \ is needed in addition to frequency synchronization\n   [TS36300] [TS23401].\
    \  Time constraints are also important due to\n   their impact on packet loss.\

    \ extreme for packet-based\n   technologies -- for example, on the order of a\
    \ PDV of +-20 ns or less\n   and frequency accuracy of +-0.002 PPM [Fronthaul].\n\
    \   The actual transport protocols and/or solutions for establishing\n   required\

    \ over Ethernet (RoE) are ongoing.\n   As mentioned in Section 6.1.2, 5G communications\
    \ will provide one of\n   the most challenging cases for delay-sensitive networking.\
    \  In order\n   to meet the challenges of ultra-low latency and ultra-high\n \
    \  throughput, 3GPP has studied various functional splits for 5G, i.e.,\n   physical\
    \ decomposition of the 5G \"gNodeB\" base station and deployment\n   of its functional\
    \ blocks in different locations [TR38801].\n   These splits are numbered from\
    \ split option 1 (dual connectivity, a\n   split in which the radio resource control\
    \ is centralized and other\n   radio stack layers are in distributed units) to\
    \ split option 8 (a\n   PHY-RF split in which RF functionality is in a distributed\
    \ unit and\n   the rest of the radio stack is in the centralized unit), with each\n\
    \   intermediate split having its own data-rate and delay requirements.\n   Packetized\
    \ versions of different splits have been proposed, including\n   enhanced CPRI\
    \ (eCPRI) [eCPRI] and RoE (as previously noted).  Both\n   provide Ethernet encapsulations,\
    \ and eCPRI is also capable of IP\n   encapsulation.\n   All-IP RANs and xHaul\
    \ networks would benefit from time\n   synchronization and time-sensitive transport\
    \ services.  Although\n   Ethernet appears to be the unifying technology for the\
    \ transport,\n   there is still a disconnect when it comes to providing Layer\
    \ 3\n   services.  The protocol stack typically has a number of layers below\n\
    \   Ethernet Layer 2 that might be \"visible\" to Layer 3.  In a fairly\n   common\
    \ scenario, on top of the lowest-layer (optical) transport is\n   the first (lowest)\
    \ Ethernet layer, then one or more layers of MPLS,\n   pseudowires, and/or other\
    \ tunneling protocols, and finally one or\n   more Ethernet layers that are visible\
    \ to Layer 3.\n   Although there exist technologies for establishing circuits\
    \ through\n   the routed and switched networks (especially in the MPLS/PWE space),\n\
    \   there is still no way to signal the time-synchronization and\n   time-sensitive\
    \ stream requirements/reservations for Layer 3 flows in\n   a way that addresses\
    \ the entire transport stack, including the\n   Ethernet layers that need to be\
    \ configured.\n   Furthermore, not all \"user-plane\" traffic will be IP.  Therefore,\
    \ the\n   solution in question also must address the use cases where the\n   user-plane\

    \   The bandwidth requirements of control/data streams are usually\n   calculated\

    \ communication, one can expect 2-32 streams with\n   packet sizes in the range\

    \ converging towards a combination\n   of autonomous operation and teleoperation\
    \ of transport and extraction\n   machines.  This means that video, audio, monitoring,\
    \ and process-\n   control traffic will increase dramatically.  Ideally, all activities\n\
    \   at the mine will rely on network infrastructure.\n   Wireless for open-pit\
    \ mining is already a reality with LPWAN\n   technologies; it is expected to evolve\
    \ to more-advanced LPWAN\n   technologies, such as those based on LTE, to increase\
    \ last-hop\n   reliability or novel LPWAN flavors with deterministic access.\n\
    \   One area in which DetNet can improve this use case is in the wired\n   networks\
    \ that make up the \"backbone network\" of the system.  These\n   networks connect\
    \ many wireless Access Points (APs) together.  The\n   mobile machines (which\
    \ are connected to the network via wireless)\n   transition from one AP to the\
    \ next as they move about.  A\n   deterministic, reliable, low-latency backbone\
    \ can enable these\n   transitions to be more reliable.\n   Connections that extend\

    \ wireless hops would also be\n   beneficial -- for example, to improve the responsiveness\
    \ of digging\n   machines to remote control.  However, to guarantee deterministic\n\
    \   performance of a DetNet, the end-to-end underlying network must be\n   deterministic.\

    \ the\n   items and the blocks to the other nodes.  For example, consider the\n\
    \   following implementation.\n   When a node is initiated, it first requests\
    \ the other nodes'\n   addresses from a specific entity, such as DNS.  The node\
    \ then creates\n   persistent connections with each of the other nodes.  If a\
    \ node\n   confirms an item, it sends the item to the other nodes via these\n\
    \   persistent connections.\n   As a new block in a node is completed and is proven\

    \ with a wide variety\n   of characteristics such as high data rate, low latency,\
    \ low loss\n   rate, security, and many other parameters.  Ideally, every service\n\
    \   would have its own physical network satisfying its particular\n   performance\
    \ requirements; however, that would be prohibitively\n   expensive.  Network slicing\
    \ can provide a customized slice for a\n   single service, and multiple slices\
    \ can share the same physical\n   network.  This method can optimize performance\
    \ for the service at\n   lower cost, and the flexibility of setting up and releasing\
    \ the\n   slices also allows the user to allocate network resources\n   dynamically.\n\

    \ control system should reply that the requested\n   services are not available\
    \ (as opposed to accepting the parameter but\n   then not delivering the desired\
    \ behavior).\n"

  contents:
  - "11.3.2.  Low Latency\n   Various applications may state that they require \"\
    extremely low\n   latency\"; however, depending on the application, \"extremely\
    \ low\" may\n   imply very different latency bounds.  For example, \"low latency\"\
    \n   across a utility-grid network is a different order of magnitude of\n   latency\
    \ values compared to \"low latency\" in a motor control loop in a\n   small machine.\
    \  It is intended that the mechanisms for specifying\n   desired latency include\
    \ wide ranges and that architecturally there is\n   nothing to prevent arbitrarily\
    \ low latencies from being implemented\n   in a given network.\n"

  - "11.3.3.  Bounded Jitter (Latency Variation)\n   As with the other latency-related\
    \ elements noted above, parameters\n   that can determine or request permitted\
    \ variations in latency should\n   be available.\n"

    \ the return path.\n"
- title: 11.4.  High Reliability and Availability
  contents:
  - "11.4.  High Reliability and Availability\n   Reliability is of critical importance\
    \ to many DetNet applications,\n   because the consequences of failure can be\
    \ extraordinarily high in\n   terms of cost and even human life.  DetNet-based\
    \ systems are expected\n   to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high\
    \ availability --\n   for example, 99.9999% uptime (where 99.9999 means \"six\
    \ nines\") or\n   even 12 nines.  DetNet designs should not make any assumptions\
    \ about\n   the level of reliability and availability that may be required of\
    \ a\n   given system and should define parameters for communicating these\n  \
    \ kinds of metrics within the network.\n   A strategy used by DetNet for providing\
    \ such extraordinarily high\n   levels of reliability is to provide redundant\
    \ paths so that a system\n   can seamlessly switch between the paths while maintaining\
    \ its\n   required level of performance.\n"
- title: 11.5.  Security
  contents:
  - "11.5.  Security\n   Security is of critical importance to many DetNet applications.\
    \  A\n   DetNet network must have the ability to be made secure against device\n\
    \   failures, attackers, misbehaving devices, and so on.  In a DetNet\n   network,\
    \ the data traffic is expected to be time sensitive; thus, in\n   addition to\
    \ arriving with the data content as intended, the data must\n   also arrive at\
    \ the expected time.  This may present \"new\" security\n   challenges to implementers\
    \ and must be addressed accordingly.  There\n   are other security implications,\
    \ including (but not limited to) the\n   change in attack surface presented by\
    \ PRE.\n"
- title: 11.6.  Deterministic Flows
  contents:
  - "11.6.  Deterministic Flows\n   Reserved-bandwidth data flows must be isolated\
    \ from each other and\n   from best-effort traffic, so that even if the network\
    \ is saturated\n   with best-effort (and/or reserved-bandwidth) traffic, the configured\n\
    \   flows are not adversely affected.\n"
- title: 12.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "12.  Security Considerations\n   This document covers a number of representative\
    \ applications and\n   network scenarios that are expected to make use of DetNet\n\
    \   technologies.  Each of the potential DetNet use cases will have\n   security\
    \ considerations from both the use-specific perspective and\n   the DetNet technology\
    \ perspective.  While some use-specific security\n   considerations are discussed\
    \ above, a more comprehensive discussion\n   of such considerations is captured\
    \ in [DetNet-Security]\n   (\"Deterministic Networking (DetNet) Security Considerations\"\
    ).\n   Readers are encouraged to review [DetNet-Security] to gain a more\n   complete\
    \ understanding of DetNet-related security considerations.\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Use Cases Explicitly Out of Scope for DetNet\n   This appendix contains\
    \ text regarding use cases that have been\n   determined to be outside the scope\
    \ of the present DetNet work.\n"
- title: A.1.  DetNet Scope Limitations
  contents:
  - "A.1.  DetNet Scope Limitations\n   The scope of DetNet is deliberately limited\
    \ to specific use cases\n   that are consistent with the WG charter, subject to\
    \ the\n   interpretation of the WG.  At the time that the DetNet use cases were\n\
    \   solicited and provided by the authors, the scope of DetNet was not\n   clearly\
    \ defined.  As the scope has been clarified, certain use cases\n   have been determined\
    \ to be outside the scope of the present DetNet\n   work.  Text regarding these\
    \ use cases was moved to this appendix to\n   clarify that they will not be supported\
    \ by the DetNet work.\n   The text was moved to this appendix based on the following\n\
    \   \"exclusion\" principles.  Please note that as an alternative to moving\n\
    \   all such text to this appendix some text has been modified in situ to\n  \
    \ reflect these same principles.\n   The following principles have been established\
    \ to clarify the scope\n   of the present DetNet work.\n   o  The scope of networks\
    \ addressed by DetNet is limited to networks\n      that can be centrally controlled,\
    \ i.e., an \"enterprise\" (aka\n      \"corporate\") network.  This explicitly\
    \ excludes \"the open\n      Internet\".\n   o  Maintaining time synchronization\
    \ across a DetNet network is\n      crucial to its operation; however, DetNet\
    \ assumes that time is to\n      be maintained using other means.  One example\
    \ would be PTP\n      [IEEE-1588].  A use case may state the accuracy and reliability\n\
    \      that it expects from the DetNet network as part of a whole system;\n  \
    \    however, it is understood that such timing properties are not\n      guaranteed\
    \ by DetNet itself.  At the time of this writing, two\n      open questions remain:\
    \ (1) whether DetNet protocols will include a\n      way for an application to\
    \ communicate expectations regarding such\n      timing properties to the network\
    \ and (2) if so, whether those\n      properties would likely have a material\
    \ effect on network\n      performance as a result.\n"

  contents:
  - "A.2.  Internet-Based Applications\n   There are many applications that communicate\
    \ over the open Internet\n   that could benefit from guaranteed delivery and bounded\

    \   open Internet, are out of scope for DetNet.  These same applications\n   may\
    \ be in scope when run in constrained environments, i.e., within a\n   centrally\

    \   For online gaming, the desired maximum allowance for round-trip delay\n  \
    \ is typically 100 ms.  However, it may be less for specific types of\n   games;\
    \ for example, for FPS games, the maximum delay should be 50 ms.\n   Transport\
    \ delay is the dominant part, with a budget of 5-20 ms.\n   For VR, a maximum\
    \ delay of 1-10 ms is needed; if doing remote VR, the\n   total network delay\
    \ budget is 1-5 ms.\n   Flow identification can be used for gaming and VR, i.e.,\

- title: A.3.  Pro Audio and Video - Digital Rights Management (DRM)
  contents:
  - "A.3.  Pro Audio and Video - Digital Rights Management (DRM)\n   The following\
    \ text was moved to this appendix because this\n   information is considered a\
    \ link-layer topic for which DetNet is not\n   directly responsible.\n   Digital\
    \ Rights Management (DRM) is very important to the audio and\n   video industries.\
    \  Whenever protected content is introduced into a\n   network, there are DRM\
    \ concerns that must be taken into account (see\n   [Content_Protection]).  Many\
    \ aspects of DRM are outside the scope of\n   network technology; however, there\
    \ are cases when a secure link\n   supporting authentication and encryption is\
    \ required by content\n   owners to carry their audio or video content when it\
    \ is outside their\n   own secure environment (for example, see [DCI]).\n   As\
    \ an example, two such techniques are Digital Transmission Content\n   Protection\
    \ (DTCP) and High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection\n   (HDCP).  HDCP content\
    \ is not approved for retransmission within any\n   other type of DRM, while DTCP\
    \ content may be retransmitted under\n   HDCP.  Therefore, if the source of a\
    \ stream is outside of the network\n   and it uses HDCP, it is only allowed to\
    \ be placed on the network with\n   that same type of protection (i.e., HDCP).\n"
- title: A.4.  Pro Audio and Video - Link Aggregation
  contents:
  - "A.4.  Pro Audio and Video - Link Aggregation\n   Note: The term \"link aggregation\"\
    \ is used here as defined by the text\n   in the following paragraph, i.e., not\
    \ following a more common\n   network-industry definition.\n   For transmitting\
    \ streams that require more bandwidth than a single\n   link in the target network\
    \ can support, link aggregation is a\n   technique for combining (aggregating)\
    \ the bandwidth available on\n   multiple physical links to create a single logical\
    \ link that provides\n   the required bandwidth.  However, if aggregation is to\
    \ be used, the\n   network controller (or equivalent) must be able to determine\
    \ the\n   maximum latency of any path through the aggregate link.\n"
- title: A.5.  Pro Audio and Video - Deterministic Time to Establish Streaming
  contents:
  - "A.5.  Pro Audio and Video - Deterministic Time to Establish Streaming\n   The\
    \ DetNet WG decided that guidelines for establishing a\n   deterministic time\
    \ to establish stream startup are not within the\n   scope of DetNet.  If the\
    \ bounded timing for establishing or\n   re-establishing streams is required in\
    \ a given use case, it is up to\n   the application/system to achieve it.\n"
