    \ in effect generalize the concept of core system to\n   include multiple communities\
    \ of autonomous systems, called autonomous\n   confederations. Autonomous confederations\
    \ maintain a higher degree of\n   mutual trust than that assumed between autonomous\

    \ or distance field of the EGP\n   Update message, the interpretation of which\
    \ is not covered by the\n   current EGP model.  This field is given a special\
    \ interpretation\n   within each autonomous confederation to support up to three\

    \ routing\n   algorithms began with a rather rigid and restricted topological\
    \ model\n   which emphasized robustness and stability at the expense of routing\n\
    \   dynamics and flexibility.  Evolution of robust and dynamic routing\n   algorithms\
    \ has since proved extraordinarily difficult, probably due\n   more to varying\
    \ perceptions of service requirements than to\n   engineering problems.\n   The\
    \ original exterior-gateway model suggested in RFC-827 [1] and\n   subsequently\
    \ refined in RFC-888 [2] severely restricted the Internet\n   topology essentially\
    \ to a tree structure with root represented by the\n   BBN-developed \"core\"\

    \  However, the\n   administrative and enforcement difficulties involved, not\
    \ to mention\n   the performance liabilities, made widespread implementation\n\
    \   impractical.\n   1.1.  The Exterior Gateway Protocol\n      Requirements for\
    \ near-term interoperability between the BBN core\n      gateways and the remainder\
    \ of the gateway population implemented\n      by other organizations required\
    \ that an interim protocol be\n      developed with the capability of exchanging\
    \ reachability\n      information, but not necessarily the capability to function\
    \ as a\n      true routing algorithm. This protocol is called the Exterior\n \
    \     Gateway Protocol (EGP) and is documented in RFC-904 [3].\n      EGP was\
    \ not designed as a routing algorithm, since no agreement\n      could be reached\
    \ on a trusted, common metric.  However, EGP was\n      designed to provide high-quality\
    \ reachability information, both\n      about neighbor gateways and about routes\
    \ to non-neighbor gateways.\n      At the present state of development, dynamic\
    \ routes are computed\n      only by the core system and provided to non-core\
    \ gateways using\n      EGP only as an interface mechanism.  Non-core gateways\
    \ can provide\n      routes to the core system and even to other non-core gateways,\
    \ but\n      cannot pass on \"third-party\" routes computed using data received\n\
    \      from other gateways.\n      As operational experience with EGP has accumulated,\
    \ it has become\n      clear that a more decentralized dynamic routing capability\
    \ is\n      needed in order to avoid resource-consuming suboptimal routes.  In\n\
    \      addition, there has long been resistance to the a-priori\n      assumption\
    \ of a single core system, with implications of\n      suboptimal performance,\
    \ administrative problems, impossible\n      enforcement and possible subversion.\
    \  Whether or not this\n      resistance is real or justified, the important technical\
    \ question\n      remains whether a more dynamic, distributed approach is possible\n\
    \      without significantly diluting stability and robustness.\n      This document\
    \ proposes certain enhancements of EGP which\n      generalize the concept of\
    \ core system to include multiple\n      communities of autonomous systems, called\
    \ autonomous\n      confederations.  Autonomous confederations maintain a higher\n\

    \ as described\n      later.  Note that the interpretation of this field is not\n\
    \      specified in RFC-904, but is left as a matter for further study.\n    \
    \  The interpretation of the distance field involves three levels of\n      metrics,\
    \ in which the lowest level is available to the interior\n      gateway protocol\
    \ (IGP) of the autonomous system itself to extend\n      the interior routes to\
    \ the autonomous system boundary.  The next\n      higher level selects preferred\
    \ routes within the autonomous system\n      to those outside, while the third\
    \ and highest selects preferred\n      routes within the autonomous confederation\
    \ to those outside.\n      The proposed model is believed compatible with the\
    \ current\n      specifications and practices used in the Internet.  In fact,\
    \ the\n      entire present conglomeration of autonomous systems, including the\n\
    \      core system, can be represented as a single autonomous\n      confederation,\
    \ with new confederations being formed from existing\n      and new systems as\
    \ necessary.\n   1.2.  Routing Restrictions\n      It was the intent in RFC-904\
    \ that the stipulated routing\n      restrictions superceded all previous documents,\
    \ including RFC-827\n      and RFC-888.  The notion that a non-core gateway must\
    \ not pass on\n      third-party information was suggested in planning meetings\
    \ that\n      occured after the previous documents had been published and before\n\
    \      RFC-904 was finalized.  This effectively obsoletes prior notions\n    \
    \  of \"stub\" or any other asymmetry other than the third-party rule.\n     \
    \ Thus, the only restrictions placed on a non-core gateway is that\n      in its\
    \ EGP messages (a) a gateway can be listed only if it belongs\n      to the same\
    \ autonomous system (internal neighbor) and (b) a net\n      can be listed only\
    \ if it is reachable via gateways belonging to\n      that system.  There are\
    \ no other restrictions, overt or implied.\n      The specification does not address\
    \ the design of the core system\n      or its gateways.\n      The restrictions\
    \ imply that, to insure full connectivity, every\n      non-core gateway must\
    \ run EGP with a core gateway.  Since the\n      present core-gateway implementation\
    \ disallows other gateways on\n      EGP-neighbor paths, this further implies\
    \ that every non-core\n      gateway must share a net in common with at least\
    \ one core gateway.\n      Note that there is no a-priori prohibition on using\
    \ EGP as an IGP,\n      or even on using EGP with a gateway of another non-core\
    \ system,\n"

    \  If a gateway in\n      each system ran EGP with a gateway in every other system,\
    \ the\n      notion of core system would be unneccessary and superflous.\n   \
    \   At one time during the evolution of the EGP model a strict\n      hierarchical\
    \ topology (tree structure) of autonomous systems was\n      required, but this\
    \ is not the case now.  At one time it was\n      forbidden for two nets to be\
    \ connected by gateways of two or more\n      systems, but this is not the case\
    \ now.  Autonomous systems are\n      sets of gateways, not nets or hosts, so\
    \ that a given net or host\n      can be reachable via more than one system; \
    \ however, every gateway\n      belongs to exactly one system.\n   1.3.  Examples\
    \ and Problems\n      Consider the common case of two local-area nets A and B\
    \ connected\n      to the ARPANET by gateways of different systems.  Now assume\
    \ A and\n      B are connected to each other by a gateway A-B belonging to the\n\
    \      same system as the A-ARPANET gateway, which could then list itself\n  \
    \    and both the A and B nets in EGP messages sent to any other\n      gateway,\
    \ since both are now reachable in its system.  However, the\n      B-ARPANET gateway\
    \ could list itself and only the B net, since the\n      A-B gateway is not in\
    \ its system.\n      In principle, we could assume the existence of a second gateway\n\
    \      B-A belonging to the same system as the B-ARPANET gateway, which\n    \
    \  would entitle it to list the A net as well;  however, it may be\n      easier\
    \ for both systems to sign a treaty and consider the A-B\n      gateway under\
    \ joint administration.  The implementation of the\n      treaty may not be trivial,\
    \ however, since the joint gateway must\n      appear to other gateways as two\
    \ distinct gateways, each with its\n      own autonomous-system number.\n    \
    \  Another case occurs when for some reason or other a system has no\n      path\
    \ to a core gateway other than via another non-core system.\n      Consider a\
    \ third local-are net C, together with gateway C-A\n      belonging to a system\
    \ other than the A-ARPANET and B-ARPANET\n      gateways.  According to the restrictions\
    \ above, gateway C-A could\n      list net C in EGP messages sent to A-ARPANET,\
    \ while A-ARPANET\n      could list ARPANET in messages sent to C-A, but not other\
    \ nets\n      which it may learn about from the core.  Thus, gateway C-A cannot\n\
    \      acquire full routing information unless it runs EGP directly with\n   \
    \   a core gateway.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Autonomous Systems and Confederations\n   The second example above illustrates\
    \ the need for a mechanism in\n   which arbitrary routing information can be exchanged\
    \ between non-core\n   gateways without degrading the degree of robustness relative\
    \ to a\n   mutually agreed security model.  One way of doing this is is to\n \
    \  extend the existing single-core autonomous-system model to include\n   multiple\
    \ core systems.  This requires both a topological model which\n   can be used\
    \ to define the scope of these systems together with a\n   global, trusted metric\
    \ that can be used to drive the routing\n   computations.  An appropriate topological\
    \ model is described in the\n   next section, while an appropriate metric is suggested\
    \ in the\n   following section.\n   2.1.  Topological Models\n      An \"autonomous\
    \ system\" consists of a set of gateways, each of\n      which can reach any other\
    \ gateway in the same system using paths\n      via gateways only in that system.\
    \  The gateways of a system\n      cooperatively maintain a routing data base\
    \ using an interior\n      gateway protocol (IGP) and a intra-system trusted routing\n\
    \      mechanism of no further concern here.  The IGP is expected to\n      include\
    \ security mechanisms to insure that only gateways of the\n      same system can\
    \ acquire each other as neighbors.\n      One or more gateways in an autonomous\
    \ system can run EGP with one\n      or more gateways in a neighboring system.\
    \  There is no restriction\n      on the number or configuration of EGP neighbor\
    \ paths, other than\n      the requirement that each path involve only gateways\
    \ of one system\n      or the other and not intrude on a third system.  It is\n\
    \      specifically not required that EGP neighbors share a common\n      network,\
    \ although most probably will.\n      An \"autonomous confederation\" consists\
    \ of a set of autonomous\n      systems sharing a common security model;  that\
    \ is, they trust each\n      other to compute routes to other systems in the same\n\
    \      confederation.  Each gateway in a confederation can reach any\n      other\
    \ gateway in the same confederation using paths only in that\n      confederation.\
    \  Although there is no restriction on the number or\n      configuration of EGP\
    \ paths other than the above, it is expected\n      that some mechanism be available\
    \ so that potential EGP neighbors\n      can discover whether they are in the\
    \ same confederation.  This\n      could be done by access-control lists, for\
    \ example, or by\n      partitioning the set of system numbers.\n      A network\
    \ is \"directly reachable\" from an autonomous system if a\n      gateway in that\
    \ system has an interface to it.  Every gateway in\n"

    \ manage the data base.\n      The routing table is updated each time an EGP Update\
    \ message is\n      received from a neighbor and possibly by other means, such\
    \ as the\n      system IGP.  The message is first decoded into a list of quads\n\
    \      consisting of a network number, gateway address, system number and\n  \
    \    distance.  If the gateway address is internal to the neighbor\n      system,\
    \ as determined from the EGP message, the system number of\n      the quad is\
    \ set to that system; while, if not, the system number\n      is set to zero,\
    \ indicating \"external.\"\n      Next, a new value of distance is computed from\
    \ the old value\n      provided in the message and subject to the following constraints:\n\
    \      If the system number matches the local system number, the new\n      value\
    \ is determined by the rules for the system IGP but must be\n      less than 128.\
    \ If not and either the system number belongs to the\n      same confederation\
    \ or the system number is zero and the old\n      distance is less than 192, the\
    \ value is determined by the rules\n      for the confederation EGP, but must\
    \ be at least 128 and less than\n      192.  Otherwise, the value is determined\
    \ by the rules for the\n      (global) universe-of-federations EGP, but must be\
    \ at least 192.\n      For each quad in the list the routing table is first searched\
    \ for\n      matching net number and a new entry made if not already there.\n\
    \      Next, the list of items for that net number is searched for\n      matching\
    \ gateway address and system number and a new entry made if\n      not already\
    \ there. Finally, the distance field is recomputed, the\n      time-to-live field\
    \ reset and local routing information inserted.\n"

  - "Autonomous Confederations\n      The time-to-live fields of all items in each\
    \ list are incremented\n      on a regular basis.  If a field exceeds a preset\
    \ maximum, the item\n      is discarded;  while, if all items on a list are discarded,\
    \ the\n      entire entry including net number is discarded.\n      When a gateway\
    \ sends an EGP Update message to a neighbor, it must\n      invert the data base\
    \ in order by gateway address, rather than net\n      number.  As part of this\
    \ process the routing table is scanned and\n      the gateway with minimum distance\
    \ selected for each net number.\n      The resulting list is sorted by gateway\
    \ address and partitioned on\n      the basis of internal/external system number.\n\
    \   3.2.  Routing Functions\n      A gateway encountering a datagram (service\
    \ unit) searches the\n      routing table for matching destination net number\
    \ and then selects\n      the gateway on that list with minimum distance.  As\
    \ the result of\n      the value assignments above, it should be clear that routes\
    \ at a\n      higher level will never be chosen if routes at a lower level\n \
    \     exist.  It should also be clear that route selection within a\n      system\
    \ cannot affect route selection outside that system, except\n      through the\
    \ intervention of the intra-confederation routing\n      algorithm.  If a simple\
    \ min-system-hop algorithm is used for the\n      confederation EGP, the IGP of\
    \ each system can influence it only to\n      the extent of reachability.\n  \
    \ 3.3.  Compatibility Issues\n      The proposed interpretation is backwards-compatibile\
    \ with known\n      EGP implementations which do not interpret the distance field\
    \ and\n      with several known EGP implementations that take private liberties\n\
    \      with this field.  Perhaps the simplest way to evolve the present\n    \
    \  system is to collect the existing implementations that do not\n      interpet\
    \ the distance field at all as a single confederation with\n      the present\
    \ core system and routing restrictions.  All distances\n      provided by this\
    \ confederation would be assumed equal to 192,\n      which would provide at least\
    \ a rudimentary capability for routing\n      within the universe of confederations.\n\
    \      One or more existing or proposed systems in which the distance\n      field\
    \ has a uniform interpretation throughout the system can be\n      organized as\
    \ autonomous confederations.  This might include the\n      Butterfly gateways\
    \ now now being deployed, as well as clones\n      elsewhere. These systems provide\
    \ the capability to select routes\n      into the system based on the distance\
    \ fields for the different\n      gateways.  It is anticipated that the distance\
    \ fields for the\n      Butterfly system can be set to at least 128 if the routing\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Summary and Conclusions\n   Taken at face value, this document represents\
    \ a proposal for an\n   interpretation of the distance field of the EGP Update\
    \ message, which\n   has previously been assigned no architected interpretation,\
    \ but has\n   been often used informally.  The proposal amounts to ordering the\n\
    \   autonomous systems in a hierarchy of systems and confederations,\n   together\
    \ with an interpretation of the distance field as a\n   three-level metric.  The\
    \ result is to create a corresponding\n   three-level routing community, one prefering\
    \ routes inside a system,\n   a second preferring routes inside a confederation\
    \ and the third with\n   no preference.\n   While the proposed three-level hierarchy\
    \ can readily be extended to\n   any number of levels, this would create strain\
    \ on the distance field,\n   which is limited to eight bits in the current EGP\
    \ model.\n   The concept of distance can easily be generalized to \"administrative\n\
    \   distance\" as suggested by John Nagle and others.\n"
