  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IS-IS protocol is specified in ISO 10589 [ISO-10589],
    with\n   extensions for supporting IPv4 specified in [RFC1195].  Each\n   Intermediate
    System (IS) (router) advertises one or more IS-IS Link\n   State Protocol Data
    Units (LSPs) with routing information.  Each LSP\n   is composed of a fixed header
    and a number of tuples, each consisting\n   of a Type, a Length, and a Value.
    \ Such tuples are commonly known as\n   TLVs, and are a good way of encoding information
    in a flexible and\n   extensible format.\n   This document contains the design
    of new TLVs to replace the existing\n   IS Neighbor TLV and IP Reachability TLV,
    and to include additional\n   information about the characteristics of a particular
    link to an IS-\n   IS LSP.  The characteristics described in this document are
    needed\n   for traffic engineering [RFC2702].  Secondary goals include\n   increasing
    the dynamic range of the IS-IS metric and improving the\n   encoding of IP prefixes.\n
    \  The router ID is useful for traffic engineering purposes because it\n   describes
    a single address that can always be used to reference a\n   particular router.\n
    \  Mechanisms and procedures to migrate to the new TLVs are not\n   discussed
    in this document.\n   A prior version of this document was published as [RFC3784]
    with\n   Informational status.  This version is on the standards track.\n"

  - "2.  Introducing Sub-TLVs\n   This document introduces a new way to encode routing
    information in\n   IS-IS.  The new object is called a sub-TLV.  Sub-TLVs are similar
    to\n   regular TLVs.  They use the same concepts as regular TLVs.  The\n   difference
    is that TLVs exist inside IS-IS packets, while sub-TLVs\n   exist inside TLVs.
    \ TLVs are used to add extra information to IS-IS\n   packets.  Sub-TLVs are used
    to add extra information to particular\n   TLVs.  Each sub-TLV consists of three
    fields, a one-octet Type field,\n   a one-octet Length field, and zero or more
    octets of Value.  The Type\n   field indicates the type of items in the Value
    field.  The Length\n   field indicates the length of the Value field in octets.
    \ Each sub-\n   TLV can potentially hold multiple items.  The number of items
    in a\n   sub-TLV can be computed from the length of the whole sub-TLV, when\n
    \  the length of each item is known.  Unknown sub-TLVs are to be ignored\n   and
    skipped upon receipt.\n   The Sub-TLV type space is managed by the IETF IS-IS
    WG [ISIS-WG].\n   New type values are allocated following review on the IETF IS-IS\n
    \  mailing list.  This will normally require publication of additional\n   documentation
    describing how the new type is used.  In the event that\n   the IS-IS working
    group has disbanded, the review shall be performed\n   by a Designated Expert
    assigned by the responsible Area Director.\n"
  title: 2.  Introducing Sub-TLVs

  - "3.  The Extended IS Reachability TLV\n   The extended IS reachability TLV is
    TLV type 22.\n   The existing IS reachability (TLV type 2, defined in ISO 10589\n
    \  [ISO-10589]) contains information about a series of IS neighbors.\n   For each
    neighbor, there is a structure that contains the default\n   metric, the delay,
    the monetary cost, the reliability, and the\n   7-octet ID of the adjacent neighbor.
    \ Of this information, the\n   default metric is commonly used.  The default metric
    is currently one\n   octet, with one bit used to indicate whether the metric is
    internal\n   or external, and one bit that was originally unused, but which was\n
    \  later defined by [RFC5302] to be the up/down bit.  The remaining 6\n   bits
    are used to store the actual metric, resulting in a possible\n   metric range
    of 0-63.  This limitation is one of the restrictions\n   that we would like to
    lift.\n   The remaining three metrics (delay, monetary cost, and reliability)\n
    \  are not commonly implemented and reflect unused overhead in the TLV.\n   The
    neighbor is identified by its system ID, typically 6 octets, plus\n   one octet
    indicating the pseudonode number.  Thus, the existing TLV\n   consumes 11 octets
    per neighbor, with 4 octets for metric and 7\n   octets for neighbor identification.
    \ To indicate multiple\n   adjacencies, this structure is repeated within the
    IS reachability\n   TLV.  Because the TLV is limited to 255 octets of content,
    a single\n   TLV can describe up to 23 neighbors.  The IS reachability TLV can
    be\n   repeated within the LSP fragments to describe further neighbors.\n   The
    proposed extended IS reachability TLV contains a new data\n   structure, consisting
    of:\n      7 octets of system ID and pseudonode number\n      3 octets of default
    metric\n      1 octet of length of sub-TLVs\n      0-244 octets of sub-TLVs, where
    each sub-TLV consists of a\n      sequence of\n         1 octet of sub-type\n
    \        1 octet of length of the Value field of the sub-TLV\n         0-242 octets
    of value\n   Thus, if no sub-TLVs are used, the new encoding requires 11 octets\n
    \  and can contain up to 23 neighbors.  Please note that while the\n   encoding
    allows for 255 octets of sub-TLVs, the maximum value cannot\n   fit in the overall
    IS reachability TLV.  The practical maximum is 255\n   octets minus the 11 octets
    described above, or 244 octets.  There is\n   no defined mechanism for extending
    the sub-TLV space.  Thus, wasting\n   sub-TLV space is discouraged.\n   The metric
    octets are encoded as a 24-bit unsigned integer.  Note\n   that the Metric field
    in the new extended IP reachability TLV is\n   encoded as a 32-bit unsigned integer.
    \ These different sizes were\n   chosen so that it is very unlikely that the cost
    of an intra-area\n   route has to be chopped off to fit in the Metric field of
    an inter-\n   area route.\n   To preclude overflow within a traffic engineering
    Shortest Path First\n   (SPF) implementation, all metrics greater than or equal
    to\n   MAX_PATH_METRIC SHALL be considered to have a metric of\n   MAX_PATH_METRIC.
    \ It is easiest to select MAX_PATH_METRIC such that\n   MAX_PATH_METRIC plus a
    single link metric does not overflow the\n   number of bits for internal metric
    calculation.  We assume that this\n   is 32 bits.  Therefore, we have chosen MAX_PATH_METRIC
    to be\n   4,261,412,864 (0xFE000000, 2^32 - 2^25).\n   If a link is advertised
    with the maximum link metric (2^24 - 1), this\n   link MUST NOT be considered
    during the normal SPF computation.  This\n   will allow advertisement of a link
    for purposes other than building\n   the normal Shortest Path Tree.  An example
    is a link that is\n   available for traffic engineering, but not for hop-by-hop
    routing.\n   Certain sub-TLVs are established here:\n   +------------+----------------+-------------------------------------+\n

- contents:
  - "4.  The Extended IP Reachability TLV\n   The extended IP reachability TLV is
    TLV type 135.\n   The existing IP reachability TLVs (TLV type 128 and TLV type
    130,\n   defined in [RFC1195]) carry IP prefixes in a format that is analogous\n
    \  to the IS neighbor TLV from ISO 10589 [ISO-10589].  They carry four\n   metrics,
    of which only the default metric is commonly used.  The\n   default metric has
    a possible range of 0-63.  We would like to remove\n   this restriction.\n   In
    addition, route redistribution (a.k.a. route leaking) has a key\n   problem that
    was not fully addressed by the existing IP reachability\n   TLVs.  [RFC1195] allows
    a router to advertise prefixes upwards in the\n   level hierarchy.  Unfortunately,
    there were no mechanisms defined to\n   advertise prefixes downwards in the level
    hierarchy.\n   To address these two issues, the proposed extended IP reachability\n
    \  TLV provides for a 32-bit metric and adds one bit to indicate that a\n   prefix
    has been redistributed 'down' in the hierarchy.\n   The proposed extended IP reachability
    TLV contains a new data\n   structure, consisting of:\n   4 octets of metric information\n

    consisting of\n      1 octet of length of sub-TLVs\n      0-249 octets of sub-TLVs,

    \        1 octet of length of the Value field of the sub-TLV\n         0-247 octets
    of value\n   This data structure can be replicated within the TLV, as long as
    the\n   maximum length of the TLV is not exceeded.\n   The 6 bits of prefix length
    can have the values 0-32 and indicate the\n   number of significant bits in the

    3.0), this prefix MUST NOT be considered\n   during the normal SPF computation.
    \ This allows advertisement of a\n   prefix for purposes other than building the
    normal IP routing table.\n"

    - "4.1.  The up/down Bit\n   If routers were allowed to redistribute IP prefixes
      freely in both\n   directions between level 1 and level 2 without any additional\n
      \  mechanisms, those routers would not be able to determine looping of\n   routing
      information.  A problem occurs when a router learns a prefix\n   via level 2
      routing and advertises that prefix down into a level 1\n   area, where another
      router might pick up the route and advertise the\n   prefix back up into the
      level 2 backbone.  If the original source\n   withdraws the prefix, those two
      routers might end up having a routing\n   loop between them, where part of the
      looped path is via level 1\n   routing and the other part of the looped path
      is via level 2 routing.\n   The solution that [RFC1195] poses is to allow only
      advertising\n   prefixes upward in the level hierarchy, and to disallow the\n
      \  advertising of prefixes downward in the hierarchy.\n   To prevent this looping
      of prefixes between levels, a new bit of\n   information is defined in the new
      extended IP reachability TLV.  This\n   bit is called the up/down bit.  The
      up/down bit SHALL be set to 0\n   when a prefix is first injected into IS-IS.
      \ If a prefix is\n   advertised from a higher level to a lower level (e.g.,
      level 2 to\n   level 1), the bit MUST be set to 1, indicating that the prefix
      has\n   traveled down the hierarchy.  Prefixes that have the up/down bit set\n
      \  to 1 may only be advertised down the hierarchy, i.e., to lower\n   levels.\n
      \  These semantics apply even if IS-IS is extended in the future to have\n   additional
      levels.  By ensuring that prefixes follow only the IS-IS\n   hierarchy, we have
      ensured that the information does not loop,\n   thereby ensuring that there
      are no persistent forwarding loops.\n   If a prefix is advertised from one area
      to another at the same level,\n   then the up/down bit SHALL be set to 1.  This
      situation can arise\n   when a router implements multiple virtual routers at
      the same level,\n   but in different areas.\n   The semantics of the up/down
      bit in the new extended IP reachability\n   TLV are identical to the semantics
      of the up/down bit defined in\n   [RFC5302].\n"

    - "4.2.  Expandability of the Extended IP Reachability TLV with Sub-TLVs\n   The
      extended IP reachability TLV can hold sub-TLVs that apply to a\n   particular
      prefix.  This allows for easy future extensions.  If there\n   are no sub-TLVs
      associated with a prefix, the bit indicating the\n   presence of sub-TLVs SHALL
      be set to 0.  If this bit is set to 1, the\n   first octet after the prefix
      will be interpreted as the length of all\n   sub-TLVs associated with this IPv4
      prefix.  Please note that while\n   the encoding allows for 255 octets of sub-TLVs,
      the maximum value\n   cannot fit in the overall extended IP reachability TLV.
      \ The\n   practical maximum is 255 octets minus the 5-9 octets described above,\n
      \  or 250 octets.\n   This document does not define any sub-TLVs for the extended
      IP\n   reachability TLV.\n"

    - "4.3.  The Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV\n   The Traffic Engineering router
      ID TLV is TLV type 134.\n   The router ID TLV contains the 4-octet router ID
      of the router\n   originating the LSP.  This is useful in several regards:\n
      \     For traffic engineering, it guarantees that we have a single\n      stable
      address that can always be referenced in a path that will\n      be reachable
      from multiple hops away, regardless of the state of\n      the node's interfaces.\n
      \     If OSPF is also active in the domain, traffic engineering can\n      compute
      the mapping between the OSPF and IS-IS topologies.\n   If a router does not
      implement traffic engineering, it MAY add or\n   omit the Traffic Engineering
      router ID TLV.  If a router implements\n   traffic engineering, it MUST include
      this TLV in its LSP.  This TLV\n   SHOULD not be included more than once in
      an LSP.\n   If a router advertises the Traffic Engineering router ID TLV in
      its\n   LSP, and if it advertises prefixes via the Border Gateway Protocol\n
      \  (BGP) with the BGP next hop attribute set to the BGP router ID, the\n   Traffic
      Engineering router ID SHOULD be the same as the BGP router\n   ID.\n   Implementations
      MUST NOT inject a /32 prefix for the router ID into\n   their forwarding table
      because this can lead to forwarding loops when\n   interacting with systems
      that do not support this TLV.\n"
