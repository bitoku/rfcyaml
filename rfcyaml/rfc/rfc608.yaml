  - "                           HOST NAMES ON-LINE\nWe at the NIC agree with Peter\
    \ Deutsch's suggestion (in RFC# 606 / NIC#\n21246) that the NIC maintain an online\
    \ ASCII text file of Host names,\naddresses, and attributes.  That suggestion\
    \ corresponds to one made by\nVint Cerf recently, and evidently receives ARPA/IPT\
    \ support.\nJake Feinler at the NIC designed and maintains a source file, in NLS\n\
    format, that can be used to generate the ASCII file Peter outlined.  A\nprogram\
    \ to generate an up to date version of the ASCII file needs to be\nwritten at\
    \ the NIC, and run periodically (weekly, or as the situation\nwarrants).  Such\
    \ a mechanism would allow us, of course, to maintain one\nsource of data and use\
    \ it for this and other purposes.\nOur present data includes official Host name,\
    \ Host address, Host status\n(user, server, TIP) and certain other information\
    \ like Technical\nLiaison, Host computer, operating system, etc.\nProvisions exist\
    \ for including attributes of the type Peter suggested\n(for example FTP byte\
    \ size, TELNET duplex mode, echoing mode, and\nnicknames), but these data are\
    \ currently NOT in our source file.\nTo get things moving, therefore, we propose\
    \ to do the following things:\n    1)  We shall write a program to generate the\
    \ ASCII file in the\n        syntax described in RFC# 606, namely:\n        <host-name-file>\
    \ ::= <entry> / <host-name-file> <entry>\n        <entry> ::= <data-part> <end-of-line>\n\
    \            Note that this produces a blank line after the <data-part>.\n   \
    \     <data-part> ::= <basic-part> / <data-part> <attribute-item>\n        <basic-part>\
    \ ::= <host-name> , <host-address> <end-of-line>\n        <attribute-item> ::=\
    \ <attribute-name> = <attribute-value> <end-\n        of-line>\n    2)  We shall\
    \ initially include only the following items in each\n        <entry>:\n     \
    \   a)  <basic-part>\n            in which <host-address> will be a decimal host\
    \ address,\n            relative to the Host's own Network, and\n            in\
    \ which <host-name> will be the official Host Name, a\n            string obtained\
    \ through negotiation between the Host and the\n            NIC, governed by these\
    \ constraints:\n                up to 48 characters drawn from the alphabet (A-Z),\n\
    \                digits (0-9), and the minus sign (-) ... specifically,\n    \
    \            no blank or space characters allowed;\n                no distinction\
    \ between upper and lower case letters;\n                the first character is\
    \ a letter;\n                the last character is NOT a minus sign;\n       \
    \         no other restrictions on content or syntax.\n            Note:  The\
    \ Host Name may be prefixed with an Official\n            Network Name of up to\
    \ 24 characters enclosed in parentheses\n            ().  The Network Name designates\
    \ the Network in which the\n            Host resides.\n                (The characters\
    \ used in the Network Name are drawn from\n                the same character\
    \ set as those in the Host Name, with\n                the same constraints [except\
    \ the length] as listed\n                above.)\n                The ASCII text\
    \ file will only contain the Official\n                Network name for Hosts\
    \ NOT on the ARPANET; for ARPANET\n                Hosts there will be no Network\
    \ Name prefix.\n        b)  <attribute-item>\n            in which <attribute-name>\
    \ initially will have the single\n            possible value STATUS, and the corresponding\
    \ value of\n            <attribute-value> for STATUS will be one of these:\n \
    \               SERVER\n                USER\n                TIP\n          \
    \      UNKNOWN\n        c)  <end-of-line>\n            this will be carriage return\
    \ followed by line feed (octal\n            015  followed by  octal  12).\n  \
    \  3)  Attributes other than those for which <attribute-name> is STATUS\n    \
    \    will be added in the above format at a later date (to be\n        announced)\
    \ as the data becomes available to us.\n        We agree with Peter that the attribute\
    \ list should not be\n        construed as replacing option negotiation or any\
    \ other means by\n        which one Host discovers the properties of another,\
    \ but merely\n        as an alternative source of information that is simply and\n\
    \        easily accessible, in machine-readable form.\n        Suggestions for\
    \ attributes that are worthy of inclusion in the\n        ASCII file of Hostnames\
    \ are welcome.  Please send your\n        suggestions and/or data to Jake Feinler\n\
    \            FEINLER @ SRI-ARC,   or  NIC Ident  =  JAKE\n        For completeness,\
    \ we record here the attribute suggestions given\n        in RFC# 606:\n     \
    \       NICKNAMES -- value is a list of acceptable nicknames for the\n       \
    \     host.  Any system that provides name-to-address translation\n          \
    \  is encouraged (although of course not required) to accept\n            these\
    \ names as alternatives to the official host name.\n            FTP-BYTE-SIZES\
    \ -- value is a list of the byte sizes\n            supported by the FTP server.\
    \  The first byte size is the one\n            which leads to the least computational\
    \ overhead (e.g. 36 for\n            PDP-10's, 32 for 360's).\n            ECHOING\
    \ -- value is L or R depending on whether the host\n            expects the terminal\
    \ to echo (Remote) or expects to do its\n            own echoing (Local).\nThe\
    \ ASCII file generated by the NIC will reside at Host OFFICE-1 (Host\nAddress\
    \ = 43 decimal), and will have the pathname\n    <NETINFO>HOSTS.TXT\nUsing this\
    \ pathname with an FTP process will enable anyone, of course,\nto retrieve the\
    \ file for use at any Network Host.\n    The login username for FTP can be GUEST,\n\
    \    password ARPA,\n    account 1.\nThe file will be in alphanumeric sequence\
    \ by Host Name.\nThe date after which the file will be available at OFFICE-l will\
    \ be\nannounced via RFC as soon as the file is ready.\nWe welcome comments on\
    \ this RFC, on RFC# 606, or on any other aspect of\nthis problem.  And we wish\
    \ to acknowledge the contributions of Vint\nCerf, Peter Deutsch, Jake Feinler,\
    \ and Nancy Neigus in getting the\nOfficial Host Name list to happen.\n      \
