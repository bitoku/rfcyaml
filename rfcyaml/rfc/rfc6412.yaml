  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the terminology for benchmarking link-state\n\
    \   Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) route convergence.  The terminology\n   is\
    \ to be used for benchmarking IGP convergence time through\n   externally observable\
    \ (black-box) data-plane measurements.  The\n   terminology can be applied to\
    \ any link-state IGP, such as IS-IS and\n   OSPF.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction and Scope\n   This document is a companion to [Po11m], which\
    \ contains the\n   methodology to be used for benchmarking link-state Interior\
    \ Gateway\n   Protocol (IGP) convergence by observing the data plane.  The purpose\n\
    \   of this document is to introduce new terms required to complete\n   execution\
    \ of the Link-State IGP Data-Plane Route Convergence\n   methodology [Po11m].\n\
    \   IGP convergence time is measured by observing the data plane through\n   the\
    \ Device Under Test (DUT) at the Tester.  The methodology and\n   terminology\
    \ to be used for benchmarking IGP convergence can be\n   applied to IPv4 and IPv6\
    \ traffic and link-state IGPs such as\n   Intermediate System to Intermediate\
    \ System (IS-IS) [Ca90][Ho08], Open\n   Shortest Path First (OSPF) [Mo98] [Co08],\

    \ for all routes matched in the\n      Offered Load MUST be offered to the DUT\
    \ within each Packet\n      Sampling Interval.  For maximum accuracy, the value\
    \ of the Packet\n      Sampling Interval SHOULD be as small as possible, but the\
    \ presence\n      of IP Packet Delay Variation (IPDV) [De02] may require that\
    \ a\n      larger Packet Sampling Interval be used.\n      The Offered Load, IPDV,\
    \ the number of routes, and the Packet\n      Sampling Interval influence the\
    \ observations for the Rate-Derived\n      Method.  It may be difficult to identify\
    \ the different convergence\n      time instants in the Rate-Derived Convergence\
    \ Graph.  For example,\n      it is possible that a Convergence Event causes the\
    \ Forwarding Rate\n      to drop to zero, while this may not be observed in the\
    \ Forwarding\n      Rate measurements if the Packet Sampling Interval is too large.\n\
    \      IPDV causes fluctuations in the number of received packets during\n   \
    \   each Packet Sampling Interval.  To account for the presence of\n      IPDV\
    \ in determining if a convergence instant has been reached,\n      Forwarding\
    \ Delay SHOULD be observed during each Packet Sampling\n      Interval.  The minimum\
    \ and maximum number of packets expected in a\n      Packet Sampling Interval\
    \ in presence of IPDV can be calculated\n      with Equation 1.\n    number of\
    \ packets expected in a Packet Sampling Interval\n      in presence of IP Packet\

    \                         Equation 1\n      To determine if a convergence instant\
    \ has been reached, the number\n      of packets received in a Packet Sampling\
    \ Interval is compared with\n      the range of expected number of packets calculated\
    \ in Equation 1.\n      If packets are going over multiple ECMP members and one\
    \ or more of\n      the members has failed, then the number of received packets\
    \ during\n      each Packet Sampling Interval may vary, even excluding presence\
    \ of\n      IPDV.  To prevent fluctuation of the number of received packets\n\
    \      during each Packet Sampling Interval for this reason, the Packet\n    \
    \  Sampling Interval duration SHOULD be a whole multiple of the time\n      between\
