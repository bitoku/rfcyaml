  - "1.  Introduction\n   Routing protocols are subject to threats and attacks that\
    \ can harm\n   individual users or the network operations as a whole.  The document\n\
    \   provides a summary of generic threats that affect routing protocols.\n   In\
    \ particular, this work identifies generic threats to routing\n   protocols that\
    \ include threat sources, threat actions, and threat\n   consequences.  A breakdown\
    \ of routing functions that might be\n   separately attacked is provided.\n  \
    \ This work should be considered a precursor to developing a common set\n   of\
    \ security requirements for routing protocols.  While it is well\n   known that\
    \ bad, incomplete, or poor implementations of routing\n   protocols may, in themselves,\
    \ lead to routing problems or failures or\n   may increase the risk of a network's\
    \ being attacked successfully,\n   these issues are not considered here.  This\
    \ document only considers\n   attacks against robust, well-considered implementations\
    \ of routing\n   protocols, such as those specified in Open Shortest Path First\
    \ (OSPF)\n   [4], Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) [5][8], RIP\n\
    \   [6] and BGP [7].  Attacks against implementation-specific weaknesses\n   and\
    \ vulnerabilities are out of scope for this document.\n   The document is organized\
    \ as follows: Section 2 provides a review of\n   routing functions.  Section 3\
    \ defines threats.  In Section 4, a\n   discussion on generally identifiable routing\
    \ threat actions is\n   provided.  Section 5 addresses security considerations.\n"
- title: 2.  Routing Functions Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Routing Functions Overview\n   This section provides an overview of common\
    \ functions that are shared\n   among various routing protocols.  In general,\
    \ routing protocols share\n   the following functions:\n   o  Transport Subsystem:\
    \ The routing protocol transmits messages to\n      its neighbors using some underlying\
    \ protocol.  For example, OSPF\n      uses IP, while other protocols may run over\
    \ TCP.\n   o  Neighbor State Maintenance: Neighboring relationship formation is\n\
    \      the first step for topology determination.  For this reason,\n      routing\
    \ protocols may need to maintain state information.  Each\n      routing protocol\
    \ may use a different mechanism for determining its\n      neighbors in the routing\
    \ topology.  Some protocols have distinct\n      exchanges through which they\
    \ establish neighboring relationships,\n      e.g., Hello exchanges in OSPF.\n\
    \   o  Database Maintenance: Routing protocols exchange network topology\n   \
    \   and reachability information.  The routers collect this\n      information\
    \ in routing databases with varying detail.  The\n      maintenance of these databases\
    \ is a significant portion of the\n      function of a routing protocol.\n   In\
    \ a routing protocol, there are message exchanges that are intended\n   for the\
    \ control of the state of the protocol.  For example, neighbor\n   maintenance\
    \ messages carry such information.  On the other hand,\n   there are messages\
    \ that are used to exchange information that is\n   intended to be used in the\
    \ forwarding function, for example, messages\n   that are used to maintain the\
    \ database.  These messages affect the\n   data (information) part of the routing\
    \ protocol.\n"
- title: 3.  Generic Routing Protocol Threat Model
  contents:
  - "3.  Generic Routing Protocol Threat Model\n   The model developed in this section\
    \ can be used to identify threats\n   to any routing protocol.\n   Routing protocols\
    \ are subject to threats at various levels.  For\n   example, threats can affect\
    \ the transport subsystem, where the\n   routing protocol can be subject to attacks\
    \ on its underlying\n   protocol.  An attacker may also attack messages that carry\
    \ control\n   information in a routing protocol to break a neighboring (e.g.,\n\
    \   peering, adjacency) relationship.  This type of attack can impact the\n  \
    \ network routing behavior in the affected routers and likely the\n   surrounding\
    \ neighborhood as well.  For example, in BGP, if a router\n   receives a CEASE\
    \ message, it will break its neighboring relationship\n   to its peer and potentially\
    \ send new routing information to any\n   remaining peers.\n   An attacker may\
    \ also attack messages that carry data information in\n   order to break a database\
    \ exchange between two routers or to affect\n   the database maintenance functionality.\
    \  For example, the information\n   in the database must be authentic and authorized.\
    \  An attacker who is\n   able to introduce bogus data can have a strong effect\
    \ on the behavior\n   of routing in the neighborhood.  For example, if an OSPF\
    \ router sends\n   LSAs with the wrong Advertising Router, the receivers will\
    \ compute a\n   Shortest Path First (SPF) tree that is incorrect and might not\n\
    \   forward the traffic.  If a BGP router advertises a Network Layer\n   Reachability\
    \ Information (NLRI) that it is not authorized to\n   advertise, then receivers\
    \ might forward that NLRI's traffic toward\n   that router and the traffic would\
    \ not be deliverable.  A Protocol\n   Independent Multicast (PIM) router might\
    \ transmit a JOIN message to\n   receive multicast data it would otherwise not\
    \ receive.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Threat Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Threat Definitions\n   In [1], a threat is defined as a potential for violation\
    \ of security,\n   which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action,\
    \ or\n   event that could breach security and cause harm.  Threats can be\n  \
    \ categorized as threat sources, threat actions, threat consequences,\n   threat\
    \ consequence zones, and threat consequence periods.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Threat Sources
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Threat Sources\n   In the context of deliberate attack, a threat source\
    \ is defined as a\n   motivated, capable adversary.  By modeling the motivations\
    \ (attack\n   goals) and capabilities of the adversaries who are threat sources,\n\
    \   one can better understand what classes of attacks these threats may\n   mount\
    \ and thus what types of countermeasures will be required to deal\n   with these\
    \ attacks.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.1.   Adversary Motivations
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.1.   Adversary Motivations\n   We assume that the most common goal of an\
    \ adversary deliberately\n   attacking routing is to cause inter-domain routing\
    \ to malfunction.  A\n   routing malfunction affects data transmission such that\
    \ traffic\n   follows a path (sequence of autonomous systems in the case of BGP)\n\
    \   other than one that would have been computed by the routing protocol\n   if\
    \ it were operating properly (i.e., if it were not under attack).\n   As a result\
    \ of an attack, a route may terminate at a router other\n   than the one that\
    \ legitimately represents the destination address of\n   the traffic, or it may\
    \ traverse routers other than those that it\n   would otherwise have traversed.\
    \  In either case, a routing\n   malfunction may allow an adversary to wiretap\
    \ traffic passively, or\n   to engage in man-in-the-middle (MITM) active attacks,\
    \ including\n   discarding traffic (denial of service).\n   A routing malfunction\
    \ might be effected for financial gain related to\n   traffic volume (vs. the\
    \ content of the routed traffic), e.g., to\n   affect settlements among ISPs.\n\
    \   Another possible goal for attacks against routing can be damage to\n   the\
    \ network infrastructure itself, on a targeted or wide-scale basis.\n   Thus,\
    \ for example, attacks that cause excessive transmission of\n   UPDATE or other\
    \ management messages, and attendant router processing,\n   could be motivated\
    \ by these goals.\n   Irrespective of the goals noted above, an adversary may\
    \ or may not be\n   averse to detection and identification.  This characteristic\
    \ of an\n   adversary influences some of the ways in which attacks may be\n  \
    \ accomplished.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.2.   Adversary Capabilities
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.2.   Adversary Capabilities\n   Different adversaries possess varied capabilities.\n\
    \   o  All adversaries are presumed to be capable of directing packets to\n  \
    \    routers from remote locations and can assert a false IP source\n      address\
    \ with each packet (IP address spoofing) in an effort to\n      cause the targeted\
    \ router to accept and process the packet as\n      though it emanated from the\
    \ indicated source.  Spoofing attacks\n      may be employed to trick routers\
    \ into acting on bogus messages to\n      effect misrouting, or these messages\
    \ may be used to overwhelm the\n      management processor in a router, to effect\
    \ DoS.  Protection from\n      such adversaries must not rely on the claimed identity\
    \ in routing\n      packets that the protocol receives.\n   o  Some adversaries\
    \ can monitor links over which routing traffic is\n      carried and emit packets\
    \ that mimic data contained in legitimate\n      routing traffic carried over\
    \ these links; thus, they can actively\n      participate in message exchanges\
    \ with the legitimate routers.\n      This increases the opportunities for an\
    \ adversary to generate\n      bogus routing traffic that may be accepted by a\
    \ router, to effect\n      misrouting or DoS.  Retransmission of previously delivered\n\
    \      management traffic (replay attacks) exemplify this capability.  As\n  \
    \    a result, protection from such adversaries ought not to rely on\n      the\
    \ secrecy of unencrypted data in packet headers or payloads.\n   o  Some adversaries\
    \ can effect MITM attacks against routing traffic,\n      e.g., as a result of\
    \ active wiretapping on a link between two\n      routers.  This represents the\
    \ ultimate wiretapping capability for\n      an adversary.  Protection from such\
    \ adversaries must not rely on\n      the integrity of inter-router links to authenticate\
    \ traffic,\n      unless cryptographic measures are employed to detect unauthorized\n\
    \      modification.\n   o  Some adversaries can subvert routers, or the management\n\
    \      workstations used to control these routers.  These Byzantine\n      failures\
    \ represent the most serious form of attack capability in\n      that they result\
    \ in emission of bogus traffic by legitimate\n      routers.  As a result, protection\
    \ from such adversaries must not\n      rely on the correct operation of neighbor\
    \ routers.  Protection\n      measures should adopt the principle of least privilege,\
    \ to\n      minimize the impact of attacks of this sort.  To counter Byzantine\n\
    \      attacks, routers ought not to trust management traffic (e.g.,\n      based\
    \ on its source) but rather each router should independently\n      authenticate\
    \ management traffic before acting upon it.\n   We will assume that any cryptographic\
    \ countermeasures employed to\n   secure BGP will employ algorithms and modes\
    \ that are resistant to\n   attack, even by sophisticated adversaries; thus, we\
    \ will ignore\n   cryptanalytic attacks.\n   Deliberate attacks are mimicked by\
    \ failures that are random and\n   unintentional.  In particular, a Byzantine\
    \ failure in a router may\n   occur because the router is faulty in hardware or\
    \ software or is\n   misconfigured.  As described in [3], \"A node with a Byzantine\
    \ failure\n   may corrupt messages, forge messages, delay messages, or send\n\
    \   conflicting messages to different nodes\".  Byzantine routers, whether\n \
    \  faulty, misconfigured, or subverted, have the context to provide\n   believable\
    \ and very damaging bogus routing information.  Byzantine\n   routers may also\
    \ claim another legitimate peer's identity.  Given\n   their status as peers,\
    \ they may even elude the authentication\n   protections, if those protections\
    \ can only detect that a source is\n   one of the legitimate peers (e.g., the\
    \ router uses the same\n   cryptographic key to authenticate all peers).\n   We\
    \ therefore characterize threat sources into two groups:\n   Outsiders: These\
    \ attackers may reside anywhere in the Internet, have\n      the ability to send\
    \ IP traffic to the router, may be able to\n      observe the router's replies,\
    \ and may even control the path for a\n      legitimate peer's traffic.  These\
    \ are not legitimate participants\n      in the routing protocol.\n   Byzantine:\
    \ These attackers are faulty, misconfigured, or subverted\n      routers; i.e.,\
    \ legitimate participants in the routing protocol.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Threat Consequences
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Threat Consequences\n   A threat consequence is a security violation\
    \ that results from a\n   threat action [1].  To a routing protocol, a security\
    \ violation is a\n   compromise of some aspect of the correct behavior of the\
    \ routing\n   system.  The compromise can damage the data traffic intended for\
    \ a\n   particular network or host or can damage the operation of the routing\n\
    \   infrastructure of the network as a whole.\n   There are four types of general\
    \ threat consequences: disclosure,\n   deception, disruption, and usurpation [1].\n\
    \   o  Disclosure: Disclosure of routing information happens when an\n      attacker\
    \ successfully accesses the information without being\n      authorized.  Outsiders\
    \ who can observe or monitor a link may cause\n      disclosure, if routing exchanges\
    \ lack confidentiality.  Byzantine\n      routers can cause disclosure, as long\
    \ as they are successfully\n      involved in the routing exchanges.  Although\
    \ inappropriate\n      disclosure of routing information can pose a security threat\
    \ or be\n      part of a later, larger, or higher layer attack, confidentiality\n\
    \      is not generally a design goal of routing protocols.\n   o  Deception:\
    \ This consequence happens when a legitimate router\n      receives a forged routing\
    \ message and believes it to be authentic.\n      Both outsiders and Byzantine\
    \ routers can cause this consequence if\n      the receiving router lacks the\
    \ ability to check routing message\n      integrity or origin authentication.\n\
    \   o  Disruption: This consequence occurs when a legitimate router's\n      operation\
    \ is being interrupted or prevented.  Outsiders can cause\n      this by inserting,\
    \ corrupting, replaying, delaying, or dropping\n      routing messages, or by\
    \ breaking routing sessions between\n      legitimate routers.  Byzantine routers\
    \ can cause this consequence\n      by sending false routing messages, interfering\
    \ with normal routing\n      exchanges, or flooding unnecessary routing protocol\
    \ messages.\n      (DoS is a common threat action causing disruption.)\n   o \
    \ Usurpation: This consequence happens when an attacker gains\n      control over\
    \ the services/functions a legitimate router is\n      providing to others.  Outsiders\
    \ can cause this by delaying or\n      dropping routing exchanges, or fabricating\
    \ or replaying routing\n      information.  Byzantine routers can cause this consequence\
    \ by\n      sending false routing information or interfering with routing\n  \
    \    exchanges.\n   Note: An attacker does not have to control a router directly\
    \ to\n   control its services.  For example, in Figure 1, Network 1 is dual-\n\
    \   homed through Router A and Router B, and Router A is preferred.\n   However,\
    \ Router B is compromised and advertises a better metric.\n   Consequently, devices\
    \ on the Internet choose the path through Router\n   B to reach Network 1.  In\
    \ this way, Router B steals the data traffic,\n   and Router A loses its control\
    \ of the services to Router B.  This is\n   depicted in Figure 1.\n          \

- title: 3.1.2.1.  Threat Consequence Scope
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.1.  Threat Consequence Scope\n   As mentioned above, an attack might damage\
    \ the data traffic intended\n   for a particular network or host or damage the\
    \ operation of the\n   routing infrastructure of the network as a whole.  Damage\
    \ that might\n   result from attacks against the network as a whole may include\
    \ the\n   following:\n   o  Network congestion.  More data traffic is forwarded\
    \ through some\n      portion of the network than would otherwise need to carry\
    \ the\n      traffic.\n   o  Blackhole.  Large amounts of traffic are unnecessarily\
    \ re-directed\n      to be forwarded through one router and that router drops\n\
    \      many/most/all packets.\n   o  Looping.  Data traffic is forwarded along\
    \ a route that loops, so\n      that the data is never delivered (resulting in\
    \ network\n      congestion).\n   o  Partition.  Some portion of the network believes\
    \ that it is\n      partitioned from the rest of the network when it is not.\n\
    \   o  Churn.  The forwarding in the network changes (unnecessarily) at a\n  \
    \    rapid pace, resulting in large variations in the data delivery\n      patterns\
    \ (and adversely affecting congestion control techniques).\n   o  Instability.\
    \  The protocol becomes unstable so that convergence on\n      a global forwarding\
    \ state is not achieved.\n   o  Overcontrol.  The routing protocol messages themselves\
    \ become a\n      significant portion of the traffic the network carries.\n  \
    \ o  Clog.  A router receives an excessive number of routing protocol\n      messages,\
    \ causing it to exhaust some resource (e.g., memory, CPU,\n      battery).\n \
    \  The damage that might result from attacks against a particular host\n   or\
    \ network address may include the following:\n   o  Starvation.  Data traffic\
    \ destined for the network or host is\n      forwarded to a part of the network\
    \ that cannot deliver it.\n   o  Eavesdrop.  Data traffic is forwarded through\
    \ some router or\n      network that would otherwise not see the traffic, affording\
    \ an\n      opportunity to see the data or at least the data delivery pattern.\n\
    \   o  Cut.  Some portion of the network believes that it has no route to\n  \
    \    the host or network when it is in fact connected.\n   o  Delay.  Data traffic\
    \ destined for the network or host is forwarded\n      along a route that is in\
    \ some way inferior to the route it would\n      otherwise take.\n   o  Looping.\
    \  Data traffic for the network or host is forwarded along\n      a route that\
    \ loops, so that the data is never delivered.\n   It is important to consider\
    \ all consequences, because some security\n   solutions can protect against one\
    \ consequence but not against others.\n   It might be possible to design a security\
    \ solution that protects\n   against eavesdropping on one destination's traffic\
    \ without protecting\n   against churn in the network.  Similarly, it is possible\
    \ to design a\n   security solution that prevents a starvation attack against\
    \ one host,\n   but not a clogging attack against a router.  The security\n  \
    \ requirements must be clear as to which consequences are being avoided\n   and\
    \ which consequences must be addressed by other means (e.g., by\n   administrative\
    \ means outside the protocol).\n"

    \ target of the attack.  Similar threat actions that happen at\n   different locations\
    \ may result in totally different threat\n   consequence zones.  For example,\
    \ when an outsider breaks the routing\n   session between a distribution router\
    \ and a stub router, only\n   reachability to and from the network devices attached\
    \ to the stub\n   router will be impaired.  In other words, the threat consequence\
    \ zone\n   is a single router.  In another case, if the outsider is located\n\
    \   between a customer edge router and its corresponding provider edge\n   router,\
    \ such an action might cause the whole customer site to lose\n   its connection.\
    \  In this case, the threat consequence zone might be a\n   single routing domain.\n"

  - "3.1.2.3.  Threat Consequence Periods\n   A threat consequence period is defined\
    \ as the portion of time during\n   which the network operations are impacted\
    \ by the threat consequences.\n   The threat consequence period is influenced\
    \ by, but not totally\n   dependent on, the duration of the threat action.  In\
    \ some cases, the\n   network operations will get back to normal as soon as the\
    \ threat\n   action has been stopped.  In other cases, however, threat\n   consequences\
    \ may persist longer than does the threat action.  For\n   example, in the original\
    \ Advanced Research Projects Agency Network\n   (ARPANET) link-state algorithm,\
    \ some errors in a router introduced\n   three instances of a Link-State Announcement\
    \ (LSA).  All of them\n   flooded throughout the network continuously, until the\

- title: 4.1.  Deliberate Exposure
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Deliberate Exposure\n   Deliberate exposure occurs when an attacker takes\
    \ control of a router\n   and intentionally releases routing information to other\
    \ entities\n   (e.g., the attacker, a web page, mail posting, other routers) that\n\
    \   otherwise should not receive the exposed information.\n   The consequence\
    \ of deliberate exposure is the disclosure of routing\n   information.\n   The\
    \ threat consequence zone of deliberate exposure depends on the\n   routing information\
    \ that the attackers have exposed.  The more\n   knowledge they have exposed,\
    \ the bigger the threat consequence zone.\n   The threat consequence period of\
    \ deliberate exposure might be longer\n   than the duration of the action itself.\
    \  The routing information\n   exposed will not be outdated until there is a topology\
    \ change of the\n   exposed network.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Sniffing
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Sniffing\n   Sniffing is an action whereby attackers monitor and/or record\
    \ the\n   routing exchanges between authorized routers to sniff for routing\n\
    \   information.  Attackers can also sniff data traffic information\n   (however,\
    \ this is out of scope of the current work).\n   The consequence of sniffing is\
    \ disclosure of routing information.\n   The threat consequence zone of sniffing\
    \ depends on the attacker's\n   location, the routing protocol type, and the routing\
    \ information that\n   has been recorded.  For example, if the outsider is sniffing\
    \ a link\n   that is in an OSPF totally stubby area, the threat consequence zone\n\
    \   should be limited to the whole area.  An attacker that is sniffing a\n   link\
    \ in an External Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP) session can gain\n   knowledge\
    \ of multiple routing domains.\n   The threat consequence period might be longer\
    \ than the duration of\n   the action.  If an attacker stops sniffing a link,\
    \ their acquired\n   knowledge will not be out-dated until there is a topology\
    \ change of\n   the affected network.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Traffic Analysis
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Traffic Analysis\n   Traffic analysis is an action whereby attackers gain\
    \ routing\n   information by analyzing the characteristics of the data traffic\
    \ on a\n   subverted link.  Traffic analysis threats can affect any data that\
    \ is\n   sent over a communication link.  This threat is not peculiar to\n   routing\
    \ protocols and is included here for completeness.\n   The consequence of data\
    \ traffic analysis is the disclosure of routing\n   information.  For example,\
    \ the source and destination IP addresses of\n   the data traffic and the type,\
    \ magnitude, and volume of traffic can\n   be disclosed.\n   The threat consequence\
    \ zone of the traffic analysis depends on the\n   attacker's location and what\
    \ data traffic has passed through.  An\n   attacker at the network core should\
    \ be able to gather more\n   information than its counterpart at the edge and\
    \ would therefore have\n   to be able to analyze traffic patterns in a wider area.\n\
    \   The threat consequence period might be longer than the duration of\n   the\
    \ traffic analysis.  After the attacker stops traffic analysis, its\n   knowledge\
    \ will not be outdated until there is a topology change of\n   the disclosed network.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Spoofing
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Spoofing\n   Spoofing occurs when an illegitimate device assumes the identity\
    \ of a\n   legitimate one.  Spoofing in and of itself is often not the true\n\
    \   attack.  Spoofing is special in that it can be used to carry out\n   other\
    \ threat actions causing other threat consequences.  An attacker\n   can use spoofing\
    \ as a means for launching other types of attacks.\n   For example, if an attacker\
    \ succeeds in spoofing the identity of a\n   router, the attacker can send out\
    \ unrealistic routing information\n   that might cause the disruption of network\
    \ services.\n   There are a few cases where spoofing can be an attack in and of\n\
    \   itself.  For example, messages from an attacker that spoof the\n   identity\
    \ of a legitimate router may cause a neighbor relationship to\n   form and deny\
    \ the formation of the relationship with the legitimate\n   router.\n   The consequences\
    \ of spoofing are as follows:\n   o  The disclosure of routing information.  The\
    \ spoofing router will\n      be able to gain access to the routing information.\n\
    \   o  The deception of peer relationship.  The authorized routers, which\n  \
    \    exchange routing messages with the spoofing router, do not realize\n    \
    \  that they are neighboring with a router that is faking another\n      router's\
    \ identity.\n   The threat consequence zone is as follows:\n   o  The consequence\
    \ zone of the fake peer relationship will be limited\n      to those routers trusting\
    \ the attacker's claimed identity.\n   o  The consequence zone of the disclosed\
    \ routing information depends\n      on the attacker's location, the routing protocol\
    \ type, and the\n      routing information that has been exchanged between the\
    \ attacker\n      and its deceived neighbors.\n   Note: This section focuses on\
    \ addressing spoofing as a threat on its\n   own.  However, spoofing creates conditions\
    \ for other threats actions.\n   The other threat actions are considered falsifications\
    \ and are\n   treated in the next section.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.5.  Falsification\n   Falsification is an action whereby an attacker sends\

    \        *---*\n                   Figure 3.  Overclaiming-2\n   The above figures\
    \ provide examples of overclaiming.  Router A, the\n   attacker, is connected\
    \ to the Internet through Router B.  Router C is\n   authorized to advertise its\
    \ link to Network 1.  In Figure 2, Router A\n   controls a link to Network 1 but\
    \ is not authorized to advertise it.\n   In Figure 3, Router A does not control\
    \ such a link.  But in either\n   case, Router A advertises the link to the Internet,\
    \ through Router B.\n   Both Byzantine routers and outsiders can overclaim network\
    \ resources.\n   The consequences of overclaiming include the following:\n   o\
    \  Usurpation of the overclaimed network resources.  In Figures 2 and\n      3,\
    \ usurpation of Network 1 can occur when Router B (or other\n      routers on\
    \ the Internet not shown in the figures) believes that\n      Router A provides\
    \ the best path to reach the Network 1.  As a\n      result, routers forward data\
    \ traffic destined to Network 1 to\n      Router A.  The best result is that the\
    \ data traffic uses an\n      unauthorized path, as in Figure 2.  The worst case\
    \ is that the\n      data never reaches the destination Network 1, as in Figure\
    \ 3.  The\n      ultimate consequence is that Router A gains control over Network\n\
    \      1's services, by controlling the data traffic.\n   o  Usurpation of the\
    \ legitimate advertising routers.  In Figures 2\n      and 3, Router C is the\
    \ legitimate advertiser of Network 1.  By\n      overclaiming, Router A also controls\
    \ (partially or totally) the\n      services/functions provided by the Router\
    \ C.  (This is NOT a\n      disruption, as Router C is operating in a way intended\
    \ by the\n      authoritative network administrator.)\n   o  Deception of other\
    \ routers.  In Figures 2 and 3, Router B, or\n      other routers on the Internet,\
    \ might be deceived into believing\n      that the path through Router A is the\
    \ best.\n   o  Disruption of data planes on some routers.  This might happen to\n\
    \      routers that are on the path that is used by other routers to\n      reach\
    \ the overclaimed network resources through the attacker.  In\n      Figures 2\
    \ and 3, when other routers on the Internet are deceived,\n      they will forward\
    \ the data traffic to Router B, which might be\n      overloaded.\n   The threat\
    \ consequence zone varies based on the consequence:\n   o  Where usurpation is\
    \ concerned, the consequence zone covers the\n      network resources that are\
    \ overclaimed by the attacker (Network 1\n      in Figures 2 and 3), and the routers\
    \ that are authorized to\n      advertise the network resources but lose the competition\
    \ against\n      the attacker (Router C in Figures 2 and 3).\n   o  Where deception\
    \ is concerned, the consequence zone covers the\n      routers that do believe\
    \ the attacker's advertisement and use the\n      attacker to reach the claimed\
    \ networks (Router B and other\n      deceived routers on the Internet in Figures\
    \ 2 and 3).\n   o  Where disruption is concerned, the consequence zone includes\
    \ the\n      routers that are on the path of misdirected data traffic (Router\
    \ B\n      in Figures 2 and 3 and other routers in the Internet on the path\n\
    \      of the misdirected traffic).\n   The threat consequence will not cease\
    \ when the attacker stops\n   overclaiming and will totally disappear only when\
    \ the routing tables\n   are converged.  As a result, the consequence period is\
    \ longer than\n   the duration of the overclaiming.\n"

    \   The threat consequences of misclaiming are similar to the\n   consequences\

  contents:
  - "4.5.2.  Falsifications by Forwarders\n   In each routing protocol, routers that\

    \ be\n   modified, the possible new contents of those fields and their\n   computation\
    \ from the original fields, the fields that must remain\n   unmodified, etc. are\
    \ all detailed in the protocol specification.\n   They may vary depending on the\
    \ function of the router or its network\n   environment.  For example, in RIP,\
    \ the forwarder must modify the\n   routing information by increasing the hop\
    \ count by 1.  On the other\n   hand, a forwarder must not modify any field of\
    \ the type 1 LSA in OSPF\n   except the age field.  In general, forwarders in\
    \ distance vector\n   routing protocols are authorized to and must modify the\
    \ routing\n   information, while most forwarders in link state routing protocols\n\
    \   are not authorized to and must not modify most routing information.\n   As\
