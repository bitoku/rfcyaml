  - "Abstract\n   This document discusses the use of the Domain Name System (DNS)\
    \ for\n   storage of E.164 numbers.  More specifically, how DNS can be used for\n\
    \   identifying available services connected to one E.164 number.\n   Routing\
    \ of the actual connection using the service selected using\n   these methods\
    \ is not discussed.\n"

- title: 2. E.164 numbers and DNS
  contents:
  - "2. E.164 numbers and DNS\n   The domain \"e164.arpa\" is being populated in order\
    \ to provide the\n   infrastructure in DNS for storage of E.164 numbers.  In order\
    \ to\n   facilitate distributed operations, this domain is divided into\n   subdomains.\
    \  Holders of E.164 numbers which want to be listed in DNS\n   should contact\
    \ the appropriate zone administrator in order to be\n   listed, by examining the\
    \ SOA resource record associated with the\n   zone, just like in normal DNS operations.\n\
    \   Of course, as with other domains, policies for such listings will be\n   controlled\
    \ on a subdomain basis and may differ in different parts of\n   the world.\n \
    \  To find the DNS names for a specific E.164 number, the following\n   procedure\
    \ is to be followed:\n  1.  See that the E.164 number is written in its full form,\
    \ including\n      the countrycode IDDD.  Example: +46-8-9761234\n  2.  Remove\
    \ all non-digit characters with the exception of the leading\n      '+'.  Example:\
    \ +4689761234\n  3.  Remove all characters with the exception of the digits. \
    \ Example:\n      4689761234\n  4.  Put dots (\".\") between each digit.  Example:\
    \ 4.6.8.9.7.6.1.2.3.4\n  5.  Reverse the order of the digits.  Example: 4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4\n\
    \  6.  Append the string \".e164.arpa\" to the end.  Example:\n      4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4.e164.arpa\n"
- title: 2.1 Special note about the '+'
  contents:
  - "2.1 Special note about the '+'\n   The '+' is kept in stage 2 in section 2 to\
    \ flag that the number which\n   the regular expression is operating on is a E.164\
    \ number.  Future\n   work will be needed to determine how other numbering plans\
    \ (such as\n   closed ones) might be identified.  It is possible, but not definite,\n\
    \   that they would use a similar mechanism as the one described in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 3. Fetching URIs given an E.164 number
  contents:
  - "3. Fetching URIs given an E.164 number\n   For a record in DNS, the NAPTR record\
    \ is used for identifying\n   available ways of contacting a specific node identified\
    \ by that name.\n   Specifically, it can be used for knowing what services exists\
    \ for a\n   specific domain name, including phone numbers by the use of the\n\
    \   e164.arpa domain as described above.\n   The identification is using the NAPTR\
    \ resource record defined for use\n   in the URN resolution process, but it can\
    \ be generalized in a way\n   that suits the needs specified in this document.\n\
    \   It is the string which is the result of step 2 in section 2 above\n   which\
    \ is input to the NAPTR algorithm.\n"
- title: 3.1 The NAPTR record
  contents:
  - "3.1 The NAPTR record\n   The key fields in the NAPTR RR are order, preference,\
    \ service, flags,\n   regexp, and replacement.  For a detailed description, see:\n\
    \   o  The order field specifies the order in which records MUST be\n      processed\
    \ when multiple NAPTR records are returned in response to\n      a single query.\n\
    \   o  The preference field specifies the order in which records SHOULD\n    \
    \  be processed when multiple NAPTR records have the same value of\n      \"order\"\
    .\n   o  The service field specifies the resolution protocol and resolution\n\
    \      service(s) that will be available if the rewrite specified by the\n   \
    \   regexp or replacement fields is applied.\n   o  The flags field contains modifiers\
    \ that affect what happens in the\n      next DNS lookup, typically for optimizing\
    \ the process.\n   o  The regexp field is one of two fields used for the rewrite\
    \ rules,\n      and is the core concept of the NAPTR record.\n   o  The replacement\
    \ field is the other field that may be used for the\n      rewrite rule.\n   Note\
    \ that the client applies all the substitutions and performs all\n   lookups,\
    \ they are not performed in the DNS servers.  Note that URIs\n   are stored in\
    \ the regexp field.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.1 Specification for use of NAPTR Resource Records\n   The input is an E.164\
    \ encoded telephone number.  The output is a\n   Uniform Resource Identifier in\
    \ its absolute form according to the\n   'absoluteURI' production in the Collected\
    \ ABNF found in RFC2396 [5]\n   An E.164 number, without any characters but leading\
    \ '+' and digits,\n   (result of step 2 in section 2 above) is the input to the\
    \ NAPTR\n   algorithm.\n   The service supported for a call is E2U.\n"
- title: 3.1.2 Specification of Service E2U (E.164 to URI)
  contents:
  - "3.1.2 Specification of Service E2U (E.164 to URI)\n   * Name: E.164 to URI\n\
    \   * Mnemonic: E2U\n   * Number of Operands: 1\n   * Type of Each Operand: First\
    \ operand is an E.164 number.\n   * Format of Each Operand: First operand is the\
    \ E.164 number in the\n     form as specified in step 2 in section 2 in this document.\n\
    \   * Algorithm: Opaque\n   * Output: One or more URIs\n   * Error Conditions:\n\
    \      o E.164 number not in the numbering plan\n      o E.164 number in the numbering\
    \ plan, but no URIs exist for\n        that number\n      o Service unavailable\n\
    \   * Security Considerations:\n      o Malicious Redirection\n        One of\
    \ the fundamental dangers related to any service such\n        as this is that\
    \ a malicious entry in a resolver's database\n        will cause clients to resolve\
    \ the E.164 into the wrong URI.\n        The possible intent may be to cause the\
    \ client to retrieve\n        a resource containing fraudulent or damaging material.\n\
    \      o Denial of Service\n        By removing the URI to which the E.164 maps,\
    \ a malicious\n        intruder may remove the client's ability to access the\n\
    \        resource.\n   This operation is used to map a one E.164 number to a list\
    \ of URIs.\n   The first well-known step in the resolution process is to remove\
    \ all\n   non-digits apart from the leading '+' from the E.164 number as\n   described\
    \ in step 1 and 2 in section 2 of this document.\n"

    \ Recommendation.\n   Delegations in the zone e164.arpa (not delegations in delegated\n\
    \   domains of e164.arpa) should be done after Expert Review, and the\n   IESG\
    \ will appoint a designated expert.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   As this system is built on top of DNS, one can\
    \ not be sure that the\n   information one get back from DNS is more secure than\
    \ any DNS query.\n   To solve that, the use of DNSSEC [9] for securing and verifying\
    \ zones\n   is to be recommended.\n   The caching in DNS can make the propagation\
    \ time for a change take\n   the same amount of time as the time to live for the\
    \ NAPTR records in\n   the zone that is changed. The use of this in an environment\
    \ where\n   IP-addresses are for hire (for example, when using DHCP [11]) must\n\
    \   therefore be done very carefully.\n   There are a number of countries (and\
    \ other numbering environments) in\n   which there are multiple providers of call\
    \ routing and number/name-\n   translation services.  In these areas, any system\
    \ that permits users,\n   or putative agents for users, to change routing or supplier\n\
    \   information may provide incentives for changes that are actually\n   unauthorized\
    \ (and, in some cases, for denial of legitimate change\n   requests).  Such environments\
    \ should be designed with adequate\n   mechanisms for identification and authentication\
    \ of those requesting\n   changes and for authorization of those changes.\n"

    \ has in turn given a series of 10000 numbers to the\n   telco with the name Telco-A.\
    \ The regulator because of that has in\n   his DNS.\n   $ORIGIN 6.4.e164.arpa.\n\
    \   6.7.9.8 IN NS ns.telco-a.example.se.\n   A user named Sven Svensson has from\

    \ Telco A to\n   point out Redirection Service as the authoritative source for\n\
    \   information about the number +46-8-9761234.  Telco A because of this\n   puts\

    \ NS ns.redirection-service.example.se.\n   Sven Svensson has already plain telephony\
    \ from Telco A, but also a\n   SIP service from the company Sip Service which\
    \ provides Sven with\n   the SIP URI \"sip:sven@sips.se\".  The ISP with the name\n\
    \   ISP A runs email and webpages for Sven, under the email address\n   sven@ispa.se,\
    \ and URI http://svensson.ispa.se.\n   The DNS for the redirection service because\
    \ of this contains the\n   following.\n   $ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4.e164.arpa.\n\
    \    IN NAPTR 10 10 \"u\" \"sip+E2U\"    \"!^.*$!sip:sven@sips.se!\"        .\n\

    \ how to handle the SIP protocol.  The client removes\n   the dashes, and ends\
    \ up with the E.164 number +4689761234.  That is\n   what is used in the algorithm\
    \ for NAPTR records, which is as\n   follows.\n   The client converts the E.164\
    \ number into the domain name\n   4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4.e164.arpa., and queries\
    \ for NAPTR records for\n   this domainname.  Using DNS mechanisms which includes\

    \   \"!^.*$!tel:+46-8-9761234\"       .\n   Because the client knows sip, the\
    \ first record above is selected,\n   and the regular expression \"!^.*$!sip:sven@sips.se\"\
