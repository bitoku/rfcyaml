Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) objects.
This document is a companion document with Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS1/E1 and DS3/E3 Interface Types,
RFC1406 [14] and RFC1407 [13].
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 definitions.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
They are: RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
[6] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
Reference [12] defines the evolution of the Interfaces Group of MIB II in terms of extensions and precise applications of the objects.
RFC 1445 [4] which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 [5] which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
This specification makes also use of: RFC 1443 [2] which defines textual conventions for the specification of managed objects.
RFC 1444 [3] which defines conformance statements for the specification of managed objects.
Objects Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[7] defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language is used for this purpose.
However, the SMI RFC 1442 purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is represented using the object type's syntax.
Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding
is how the object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.
The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
Format of Definitions Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in the SNMPv2 SMI.
These objects are used when the particular media being used to realize an interface is a SONET/SDH interface.
At present, this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet  standard MIB: sonet (39), sonetPath (50), sonetVT (51)
The definitions contained herein are based on the SONET/SDH specifications in ANSI T1.105 and T1.106 1988 [9, 9a, 10] and CCITT G.707, 708, 709, and G.783 [15 18].
This section specifies how the MIB II interfaces group, as defined in [12], is used for SONET/SDH interfaces.
The SONET/SDH layers support several multiplexing possibilities.
For example in SONET, an Synchronous Transport Signal 3 (STS 3) has 3 SONET Paths, and a STS 3c has 1 SONET Path.
Another example could be a STS 12 having 4 SONET STS 3c Paths.
Similarly, a SONET Synchronous Payload Envelope (SPE) can carry many Virtual Tributaries (VTs), for example, one SONET SPE can carry 28 VT1.5s.
It is important to note that an SPE and a VT in SONET is collectively referred to as a Virtual Container (VC) in SDH.
Also, an STS is called Synchronous Transport Module (STM) in SDH.
Not all SONET/SDH equipment terminate all SONET/SDH layers.
For example, an SONET/SDH STE regenerator terminates SONET/SDH Sections only, and is transparent for all layers above that.
Drop multiplexers and Digital Cross Connect Systems terminate SONET/SDH Lines.
SONET/SDH Terminal Multiplexers may also terminate SONET/SDH Paths and VTs/VCs.
MIB II [6], as extended by [12], accommodates these cases by appropriate use of the MIB II system group, and the interfaces group.
The system group can name and describe the type of managed resource.
The interfaces group defines which SONET/SDH layers apply, how these layers are configured and multiplexed.
This is achieved by proper representation of SONET/SDH Layers by ifEntries as defined in [12], as follows:
Use of ifTable for a SONET/SDH port
The exact configuration and multiplexing of the layers is maintained in the ifStackTable [12].
Use of ifTable for SONET/SDH Medium/Section/Line Layer
Only the ifGeneralGroup needs to be supported.
The value of the Circuit Identifier.
If no Circuit Identifier has been assigned this object should have an octet string with zero length.
The desired administrative status of the interface.
The value testing(3) is not used.
This object assumes the value down(2), if the objects sonetSectionCurrentStatus and sonetLineCurrentStatus have any other value than sonetSectionNoDefect(1) and sonetLineNoDefect(1), respectively.
Use of ifTable for SONET/SDH Paths
Only the ifGeneralGroup needs to be supported.
The desired administrative status of the interface.
This object assumes the value down(2), if the object sonetPathCurrentStatus has any other value than sonetPathNoDefect(1).
ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Default value is disabled(2).
Just read only access may be supported.
Use of ifTable for SONET/SDH VTs/VCs
Only the ifGeneralGroup needs to be supported.
(e.g., a VT1.5 has a rate of 1728000 bps.)
The desired administrative status of the interface.
This object assumes the value down(2), if the object sonetVTCurrentStatus has any other value than sonetVTNoDefect(1).
ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Default value is disabled(2).
Just read only access may be supported.
The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on a SONET circuit as monitored by a SONET system are from the ANSI T1M1.3/93
The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on a SDH circuit as monitored by a SDH system are from the CCITT G.783 [18].
Only the SONET Performance Monitoring terminology is defined in this document.
The definitions for SDH Performance Monitoring terms are similar but not identical, and they can be found in [18].
If the definition in this document does not match the definition in the ANSI T1M1.3/93
005R2 draft document, the implementer should follow the definition described in this document.
Section Loss Of Frame Failure (Out of Frame Event, Severely Errored Frame Defect)
An Out of Frame (OOF) event (or Severely Errored Frame defect) is the occurrence of four contiguous errored frame alignment words.
A frame alignment work occupies the A1 and A2 bytes of an STS frame, and is defined in T1.105.
The SEF defect is terminated when two contiguous error free frame words are detected.
Any implementation of the frame recovery circuitry which achieves realignment following an OOF within the 250 microsecond (two frames)
interval implied by this definition is acceptable.
An Loss of Frame (LOF) defect is declared when an OOF/SEF defect persists for a period of 3 milliseconds.
The LOF defect is terminated when the incoming signal remains continuously in frame for a period of 1 ms to 3 ms.
The Loss of Signal (LOS) defect is declared when no transitions are detected on the incoming signal (before descrambling).
The LOS defect is detected  upon observing 2.3 to 100 microseconds of no transitions.
The LOS defect is cleared after a 125 microsecond interval (one frame) during which no LOS defect is detected.
Declaration of LOS failure clears any existing LOF failure.
Clearing the LOS failure allows immediate declaration of the LOF failure if conditions warrant.
STS Path Loss of Pointer An Loss of Pointer (LOP) defect is declared when either a valid pointer is not detected in eight consecutive frames, or when eight consecutive frames are detected with the New Data Flag (NDF) set to "1001" without a valid concatenation indicator (see ANSI T1.105).
A LOP defect is terminated when either a valid pointer with a normal NDF set to "0110", or a valid concatenation indicator is detected for three contiguous frames.
Incoming STS Path AIS shall not result in the declaration of a LOP defect.
A VT LOP defect is declared when either a valid pointer is not detected in eight consecutive VT superframes, or when eight consecutive VT superframes are detected with the NDF set to "1001" without a valid concatenation indicator.
A VT LOP defect is terminated when either a valid pointer with a normal NDF set to "0110", or a valid concatenation indicator is detected for three contiguous VT superframes.
Incoming VT Path AIS shall not result in declaring a VT LOP defect.
Line Alarm Indication Signal A Line Alarm Indication Signal (L AIS) is defined in ANSI T1.105.
Line AIS defect is terminated when bits 6, 7, and 8 of the K2 byte do not contain the code "111" for five consecutive frames.
STS Path Alarm Indication Signal
The STS Path Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) is defined in ANSI T1.105 as all ones in bytes H1, H2, and H3 as well as all ones in the entire STS SPE.
The following criteria are specific to the STS Path AIS defect:
STS Path AIS defect is detected as all ones in bytes H1 and H2 in three contiguous frames.
The STS Path AIS defect is terminated when a valid STS Pointer is detected with the NDF set to "1001" (inverted) for one frame, or  "0110" (normal) for three contiguous frames.
VT Path Alarm Indication Signal
The VT Path Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) is only applicable for VTs in the floating mode of operation.
VT Path AIS is used to alert the downstream VT Path Terminating Entity (PTE) of an upstream failure.
Upon detection of a failure, Line AIS, or STS Path AIS, an STS PTE will generate downstream VT Path AIS if the STS Synchronous Payload Envelope (SPE) is carrying floating VTs.
VT Path AIS is specified in ANSI T1.105 as all ones in bytes V1, V2, V3, and V4, as well as all ones in the entire VT SPE.
The following criteria are specific to VT Path AIS defect:
VT Path AIS defect is detected by a VT PTE as all ones in bytes V1 and V2 in three contiguous VT superframes.
VT Path AIS defect is terminated when valid VT pointer with a valid VT size is detected with the NDF set to "1001" (inverted) for one VT superframe, or "0110" (normal) for three contiguous VT superframes are detected.
Line Remote Defect Indication Line Remote Defect Indication (RDI) (aka Line FERF)
signal is the occurrence of a "110" pattern in bit positions 6, 7, and 8 of the K2 byte in STS 1 #1 of the STS N signal.
Line RDI is defined in ANSI T1.105.
Line RDI defect is terminated when any code other than "110" is detected in bits 6, 7, and 8 of the K2 byte in five consecutive frames.
A Line Remote Failure Indication (RFI) failure is declared when the incoming Line RDI defects lasts for 2.5
STS Path Remote Defect Indication STS Path RDI (aka STS Path FERF)
signal shall be generated within 100 milliseconds by the STS PTE upon detection of an AIS or LOP defect.
Transmission of the STS Path RDI signal shall cease within 100 milliseconds when the STS PTE no longer detects STS Path AIS or STS
The STS Path RDI  shall accurately report the presence or absence of STS Path AIS or STS
STS Path RDI defect is defined in ANSI T1.105.
STS Path RDI is detected by the upstream STS PTE as a "1" in bit five of the Path Status byte (G1) for five contiguous frames.
Removal of STS Path Remote Defect Indication is detected by a "0" in bit 5 of the G1 byte in five contiguous frames.
A STS Path Remote Failure Indication (RFI) failure is declared when the incoming STS Path RDI defects lasts for 2.5
VT Path Remote Defect Indication VT Path RDI (aka VT Path FERF)
signal shall be generated within 100 milliseconds by the VT PTE upon detection of a VT Path AIS or LOP defect.
Transmission of the VT Path RDI signal shall cease within 100 milliseconds when the VT PTE no longer detects VT Path AIS or VT Path LOP defect.
The VT Path RDI  shall accurately report the presence or absence of VT Path AIS or VT Path LOP defects.
VT Path RDI defect is defined in ANSI T1.105.
VT Path RDI defect is terminated when a "0" is detected in bit 4 of the VT Path Overhead byte (V5) for five contiguous frames.
A VT Path Remote Failure Indication (RFI) (derived) failure is declared when the incoming VT Path RDI defects lasts for 2.5
VT Path Remote Failure Indication
The VT Path RFI signal is only required for the case of byte synch mapped DS1s where the DS1 frame bit is not mapped.
The VT Path RFI is specified in ANSI T1.105, where it is currently called VT path yellow.
When provided, the VT Path RFI signal is used to indicate the occurrence of far end failures.
When the VT Path RFI is not provided, far end failures are derived from local timing of the VT Path RDI defect.
The VT Path RFI failure is declared within 5 ms of detecting the incoming VT Path RFI Signal.
The VT Path Remote Failure Indication (RFI) failure is cleared within 50 ms of detecting the removal of the incoming VT Path RFI signal.
Coding Violation Coding Violations (CV) are Bit Interleaved Parity (BIP) errors that are detected in the incoming signal.
CV counters are incremented for each BIP error detected.
That is, each BIP 8 can detect up to eight errors per STS N frame, with each error incrementing the CV counter.
Section CVs shall be collected using the BIP 8 in the B1 byte located in the Section Overhead of STS 1 #1.
Line CVs shall be collected using the BIP 8s in B2 bytes located in the Line Overhead of each STS 1 (since all CVs on an STS N line are counted together, this is equivalent to counting each error in the BIP 8 N contained in the B2 bytes of the STS N Line Overhead).
Thus, on an STS N signal, up to 8
x N CVs may occur in each frame.
Path CVs shall be collected using the BIP 8 in the B3 byte of the STS Path Overhead of the STS SPE.
VT CVs shall be collected using the BIP 2 in the V5 overhead byte of the floating VT.
At each layer, an Errored Second (ES) is a second with one or more Coding Violations at that layer OR one or more incoming defects (e.g., SEF, LOS, AIS, LOP) at that layer has occurred.
At each layer, an Severely Errored Second (SES) is a second with x or more CVs at that layer, or a second during which at least one or more incoming defects at that layer has occurred.
Values of x vary depending on the line rate and the Bit Error Rate.
See Section 3.4 for values for x.
Framing Seconds A Severely Errored Framing Second (SEFS) is a seconds with containing one or more SEF events.
This counter is only counted at the Section Layer.
At the Line, Path, and VT layers, an unavailable second is calculated by counting the number of seconds that the interface is unavailable.
At each layer, the SONET/SDH interface is said to be unavailable at the onset of 10 contiguous SESs.
The 10 SESs are included in unavailable time.
Once unavailable, the SONET/SDH interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs.
The 10 seconds with no SESs are excluded from unavailable time.
With respect to the SONET/SDH error counts at each layer, all counters at that layer are incremented while the SONET/SDH interface is deemed available at that layer.
While the interface is deemed unavailable at that layer, the only count that is incremented is UASs at that layer.
A special case exists when the 10 or more second period crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as the foregoing description implies that the SES and UAS counters must be adjusted when the Unavailable Signal State is entered.
Clearly, successive GETs of the affected sonetPathIntervalSES and sonetPathIntervalUAS (for the Line and VT also) objects will return differing values if the first GET occurs during the first few seconds of the window.
This is viewed as an unavoidable side effect of selecting the presently defined managed objects as a basis for this memo.
If a Path or VT connection is not provisioned (idle)
the SONET equipment will signal this state by transmitting the Path or VT Signal Label as follows:
byte C2 of the STS Path Overhead equal to 0 for an unequipped Path, byte V5 of the VT Path Overhead equal to 0 for an unequipped VT.
A Path or VT connection is not correctly provisioned if a received Path or VT Signal Label mismatch occurs.
A received Signal Label is considered mismatched if it does not equal either the locally provisioned value or the value 'equipped non specific' (1 hex).
Note that any received non zero Signal Label is considered a locally provisioned value of 'equipped non specific'.
Only in  service, provisioned Path Terminating equipment can detect mismatched Signal labels.
It is considered provisioned if it has been configured for a mapping and has been assigned signals to and from which the mapping takes place.
This is a character string specified by the circuit vendor, and is useful when communicating with the vendor during the troubleshooting process.
