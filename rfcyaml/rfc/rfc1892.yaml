- title: 1. The Multipart/Report MIME content-type
  contents:
  - "1. The Multipart/Report MIME content-type\n   The Multipart/Report MIME content-type\
    \ is a general \"family\" or\n   \"container\" type for electronic mail reports\
    \ of any kind. Although\n   this memo defines only the use of the Multipart/Report\
    \ content-type\n   with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs\n\
    \   will benefit if a single content-type is used to for all kinds of\n   reports.\n\
    \   The Multipart/Report content-type is defined as follows:\n             MIME\
    \ type name: multipart\n             MIME subtype name: report\n             Required\
    \ parameters: boundary, report-type\n             Optional parameters: none\n\
    \             Encoding considerations: 7bit should always be adequate\n      \
    \       Security considerations: see section 4 of this memo.\n   The syntax of\
    \ Multipart/Report is identical to the Multipart/Mixed\n   content type defined\
    \ in [MIME].  When used to send a report, the\n   Multipart/Report content-type\
    \ must be the top-level MIME content type\n   for any report message.  The report-type\
    \ parameter identifies the\n   type of report.  The parameter is the MIME content\
    \ sub-type of the\n   second body part of the Multipart/Report.\n      User agents\
    \ and gateways must be able to automatically determine\n      that a message is\
    \ a mail system report and should be processed as\n      such.  Placing the Multipart/Report\
    \ as the outermost content\n      provides a mechanism whereby an auto-processor\
    \ may detect through\n      parsing the RFC 822 headers that the message is a\
    \ report.\n   The Multipart/Report content-type contains either two or three sub-\n\
    \   parts, in the following order:\n   (1) [required]  The first body part contains\
    \ human readable message.\n       The purpose of this message is to provide an\
    \ easily-understood\n       description of the condition(s) that caused the report\
    \ to be\n       generated, for a human reader who may not have an user agent\n\
    \       capable of interpreting the second section of the\n       Multipart/Report.\n\
    \       The text in the first section may be in any MIME standards-track\n   \
    \    content-type, charset, or language.  Where a description of the\n       error\
    \ is desired in several languages or several media, a\n       Multipart/Alternative\
    \ construct may be used.\n       This body part may also be used to send detailed\
    \ information\n       that cannot be easily formatted into a Message/Report body\
    \ part.\n   (2) [required]  A machine parsable body part containing an account\n\
    \       of the reported message handling event. The purpose of this body\n   \
    \    part is to provide a machine-readable description of the\n       condition(s)\
    \ which caused the report to be generated, along with\n       details not present\
    \ in the first body part that may be useful to\n       human experts.  An initial\
    \ body part, Message/delivery-status is\n       defined in [DSN]\n   (3) [optional]\
    \  A body part containing the returned message or a\n       portion thereof. \
    \ This information may be useful to aid human\n       experts in diagnosing problems.\
    \  (Although it may also be useful\n       to allow the sender to identify the\
    \ message which the report was\n       issued, it is hoped that the envelope-id\
    \ and original-recipient-\n       address returned in the Message/Report body\
    \ part will replace\n       the traditional use of the returned content for this\
    \ purpose.)\n   Return of content may be wasteful of network bandwidth and a variety\n\
    \   of implementation strategies can be used.  Generally the sender\n   should\
    \ choose the appropriate strategy and inform the recipient of\n   the required\
    \ level of returned content required.  In the absence of\n   an explicit request\
    \ for level of return of content such as that\n   provided in [DRPT], the agent\
    \ which generated the delivery service\n   report should return the full message\
    \ content.\n   When data not encoded in 7 bits is to be returned, and the return\n\
    \   path is not guaranteed to be 8-bit capable, two options are\n   available.\
    \  The origional message MAY be reencoded into a legal 7 bit\n   MIME message\
    \ or the Text/RFC822-Headers content-type MAY be used to\n   return only the origional\
    \ message headers.\n"
- title: 2. The Text/RFC822-Headers MIME content-type
  contents:
  - "2. The Text/RFC822-Headers MIME content-type\n   The Text/RFC822-Headers MIME\
    \ content-type provides a mechanism to\n   label and return only the RFC 822 headers\
    \ of a failed message.  These\n   headers are not the complete message and should\
    \ not be returned as a\n   Message/RFC822.  The returned headers are useful for\
    \ identifying the\n   failed message and for diagnostics based on the received:\
    \ lines.\n   The Text/RFC822-Headers content-type is defined as follows:\n   \
    \       MIME type name: Text\n          MIME subtype name: RFC822-Headers\n  \
    \        Required parameters: None\n          Optional parameters: none\n    \
    \      Encoding considerations: 7 bit is sufficient for normal RFC822\n      \
    \           headers, however, if the headers are broken and require\n        \
    \         encoding, they may be encoded in quoted-printable.\n          Security\
    \ considerations: see section 4 of this memo.\n   The Text/RFC822-headers body\
    \ part should contain all the RFC822\n   header lines from the message which caused\
    \ the report.  The RFC822\n   headers include all lines prior to the blank line\
    \ in the message.\n   They include the MIME-Version and MIME Content- headers.\n"

  - "4. Security Considerations\n   Automated use of report types without authentication\
    \ presents several\n   security issues.  Forging negative reports presents the\
    \ opportunity\n   for denial-of-service attacks when the reports are used for\
    \ automated\n   maintenance of directories or mailing lists.  Forging positive\n\
    \   reports may cause the sender to incorrectly believe a message was\n   delivered\
    \ when it was not.\n"
