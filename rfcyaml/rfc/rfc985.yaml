  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC summarizes the requirements for gateways to\
    \ be used on\n   networks supporting the DARPA Internet protocols.  While it applies\n\
    \   specifically to National Science Foundation research programs, the\n   requirements\
    \ are stated in a general context and are believed\n   applicable throughout the\
    \ Internet community.  This document was\n   prepared by the Gateway Requirements\
    \ Subcommittee of the NSF Network\n   Technical Advisory Group in cooperation\
    \ with the Internet Activities\n   Board, Internet Architecture Task Force and\
    \ Internet Engineering Task\n   Force.  It requests discussion and suggestions\
    \ for improvements.\n   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n   The purpose\
    \ of this document is to present guidance for vendors\n   offering products that\
    \ might be used or adapted for use in an\n   Internet application.  It enumerates\
    \ the protocols required and gives\n   references to RFCs and other documents\
    \ describing the current\n   specifications.  In a number of cases the specifications\
    \ are evolving\n   and may contain ambiguous or incomplete information.  In these\
    \ cases\n   further discussion giving specific guidance is included in this\n\
    \   document.  Specific policy issues relevant to the NSF scientific\n   networking\
    \ community are summarized in an Appendix.\n      This is a DRAFT edition of this\
    \ statement of gateway requirements.\n      Comments are sought on this document\
    \ for consideration and\n      possibly incorporated in the final edition.  Comments\
    \ are\n      especially sought from those actually developing gateways,\n    \
    \  particular vendors and potential vendors of gateways.  The period\n      for\
    \ comments is 90 days ending 15-Aug-86, at which time revised\n      edition will\
    \ be issued with a new RFC number.\n   Suggestions and comments on this document\
    \ can be sent to the\n   subcommittee chairman Dave Mills (mills@usc-isid.arpa),\
    \ or NTAG\n   committee chairman Dave Farber (farber@huey.udel.edu).  The\n  \

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The following sections are intended as an introduction and\
    \ background\n   for those unfamiliar with the DARPA Internet architecture and\
    \ the\n   Internet gateway model.  General background and discussion on the\n\
    \   Internet architecture and supporting protocol suite can be found in\n   the\
    \ DDN Protocol Handbook [25] and ARPANET Information Brochure [26],\n   both available\
    \ from the Network Information Center, SRI\n   International, Menlo Park, CA 94025.\
    \  Readers familiar with these\n   concepts can proceed directly to Section 2.\n\
    \   1.1.  The DARPA Internet Architecture\n      The DARPA Internet system consists\
    \ of a number of gateways and\n      networks that collectively provide packet\
    \ transport for hosts\n      subscribing to the DARPA Internet protocol architecture.\
    \  These\n      protocols include the Internet Protocol (IP), Internet Control\n\
    \      Message Protocol (ICMP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and\n    \
    \  application protocols depending upon them.  All protocols use IP\n      as\
    \ the basic packet-transport mechanism.  IP is a datagram, or\n      connectionless,\
    \ service and includes provision for service\n      specification, fragmentation/reassembly\
    \ and security information.\n      ICMP is considered an integral part of IP,\
    \ although it is\n"

    \ it.  ICMP provides error reporting,\n      flow control and first-hop gateway\
    \ redirection.  Reliable data\n      delivery is provided in the protocol suite\
    \ by TCP, which provides\n      end-end retransmission, resequencing and connection\
    \ control.\n      Connectionless service is provided by the User Datagram Protocol\n\
    \      (UDP).\n      The Internet community presently includes several thousand\
    \ hosts\n      connected to over 400 networks with about 120 gateways.  There\
    \ are\n      now well over 2400 hosts registered in the ARPA domain alone and\n\
    \      an unknown number registered in other domains, with the total\n      increasing\
    \ at about ten percent each month.  Many of the hosts,\n      gateways and networks\
    \ in the Internet community are administered\n      by civil organizations, including\
    \ universities, research\n      laboratories and equipment manufacturers.  Most\
    \ of the remainder\n      are administered by the US DoD and considered part of\
    \ the DDN\n      Internet, which presently consists of three sets of networks:\
    \ the\n      experimental segment, or ARPANET, the unclassified segment, or\n\
    \      MILNET, and the classified segment, which does not yet have a\n      collective\
    \ name.\n      The Internet model includes constituent networks, called local\n\
    \      networks to distinguish them from the Internet system as a whole,\n   \
    \   which are required only to provide datagram (connectionless)\n      transport.\
    \  This requires only best-effort delivery of individual\n      packets, or datagrams.\
    \  Each datagram carries 32-bit source and\n      destination addresses, which\
    \ are encoded in three formats\n      providing a two-part address, one of which\
    \ is the local-network\n      number and the other the host number on that local\
    \ net.  According\n      to the Internet service specification, datagrams can\
    \ be delivered\n      out of order, be lost or duplicated and/or contain errors.\
    \  In\n      those networks providing connection-oriented service the extra\n\
    \      reliability provided by virtual circuits enhances the end-end\n      robustness\
    \ of the system, but is not strictly necessary.\n      Local networks are connected\
    \ together in the Internet model by\n      means of Internet gateways.  These\
    \ gateways provide datagram\n      transport only and normally seek to minimize\
    \ the state information\n      necessary to sustain this service in the interest\
    \ of routing\n      flexibility and robustness.  In the conventional model the\
    \ gateway\n      has a physical interface and address on each of the local nets\n\
    \      between which it provides forwarding services.  The gateway also\n    \
    \  participates in one or more distributed routing or reachability\n      algorithm\
    \ such as the Gateway-Gateway Protocol (GGP) or Exterior\n      Gateway Protocol\
    \ (EGP) in order to maintain its routing tables.\n"

  - "Requirements for Internet Gateways -- DRAFT\n   1.2.  The Internet Gateway Model\n\
    \      An Internet gateway is a self-contained, stand-alone packet switch\n  \
    \    that performs the following functions:\n         1.  Interfaces to two or\
    \ more packet-switching networks,\n             including encapsulation, address\
    \ transformation and flow\n             control.\n         2.  Conforms to specific\
    \ DARPA Internet protocols specified in\n             this document, including\
    \ the Internet Protocol (IP),\n             Internet Control Message Protocol\
    \ (ICMP), Exterior Gateway\n             Protocol (EGP) and others as necessary.\n\
    \         3.  Supports an interior gateway protocol (IGP) reachability or\n  \
    \           routing algorithm in cases of multiple gateways operating\n      \
    \       as a system.  Supports the EGP reachability algorithm to\n           \
    \  exchange routes between systems, in particular the DARPA\n             \"core\"\
    \ system operated by BBN.\n         4.  Receives and forwards Internet datagrams\
    \ consistent with\n             good engineering practice in the management of\
    \ resources,\n             congestion control and fairness.  Recognizes various\
    \ error\n             conditions and generates ICMP error and information\n  \
    \           messages as required.\n         5.  Provides system support facilities,\
    \ including loading,\n             debugging, status reporting, exception reporting\
    \ and\n             control.\n      In some configurations gateways may be connected\
    \ to\n      packet-switching local nets that provide generic local-net\n     \
    \ routing, error-control and resource-management functions.  In\n      others\
    \ gateways may be directly connected via serial lines, so\n      that these functions\
    \ must be provided by the gateways themselves.\n      There are three typical\
    \ scenarios that should be addressed by\n      gateway vendors:\n         1. \
    \ National or regional network.  Gateways of this class\n             should be\
    \ capable of switching multiple continuous flows in\n             the 1.5-Mbps\
    \ range at rates to several thousand packets per\n             second.  They will\
    \ be high-performance, possibly redundant,\n             multiple-processor devices,\
    \ probably procured as a system\n             and operated remotely from a regional\
    \ or national\n             monitoring center.  The design of these gateways should\n\
    \             emphasize high aggregate throughput, throughput-sensitive\n"

    \ and very high reliability.  The typical\n             application would be an\
    \ NSF backbone net or one of the\n             consortium or regional nets.\n\
    \         2.  Campus network.  Gateways of this class should be capable\n    \
    \         of switching some burst flows at 10-Mbps (Ethernets, etc.),\n      \
    \       together with some flows in the 64-Kbps range or lower, at\n         \
    \    rates to perhaps several thousand packets per second.  They\n           \
    \  will be medium-performance devices, probably competitively\n             procured\
    \ from different vendors for each campus and\n             operated from a campus\
    \ computing center.  The design of\n             these gateways should emphasize\
    \ low average delay and good\n             burst performance, together with delay\
    \ and type-of-service\n             sensitive resource management.  Their chief\
    \ function might\n             be to interconnect various LANs and campus computing\n\
    \             resources, including a high-speed interconnect to a\n          \
    \   national or regional net.  An important factor will be a\n             very\
    \ flexible routing mechanism, since these gateways may\n             have to select\
    \ among several backbone nets based on\n             cost/performance considerations.\n\
    \         3.  Department network.  Gateways of this class should be\n        \
    \     capable of switching a small number of burst flows at\n             10-Mbps\
    \ (Ethernets, etc.), together with a small number of\n             flows in the\
    \ range 64-Kbps or lower, at rates of a few\n             hundred packets per\
    \ second.  They will be\n             medium-performance devices procured from\
    \ a variety of\n             vendors and used for protocol-matching, LAN repeaters\
    \ and\n             as general utility packet switches.  They will probably be\n\
    \             locally maintained by the various users and not be used as\n   \
    \          transit switches.\n      It is important to realize that Internet gateways\
    \ normally operate\n      in an unattended mode, but that equipment and software\
    \ faults can\n      affect the entire Internet.  While some of the above scenarios\n\
    \      involve positive control of some gateways from a monitoring\n      center,\
    \ usually via a path involving other networks and Internet\n      gateways, others\
    \ may involve much less formal control procedures.\n      Thus the gateways must\
    \ be highly robust and be expected to\n      operate, possibly in a degraded state,\
    \ under conditions of extreme\n      congestion or failure of network resources.\n"

- title: 2.  Protocols Required
  contents:
  - "2.  Protocols Required\n   The Internet architecture uses datagram gateways to\
    \ interconnect\n   networks and subnetworks.  These gateways function as intermediate\n\
    \   systems (IS) with respect to the ISO connectionless network model and\n  \
    \ incorporate defined packet formats, routing algorithms and related\n   procedures.\
    \  In the following it is assumed the protocol\n   implementation supports the\
    \ full protocol, including all required\n   options, with exceptions only as noted.\n\
    \   2.1.  Internet Protocol (IP)\n      This is the basic datagram protocol used\
    \ in the Internet system.\n      It is described in RFC-791 [1] and also MIL-STD-1777\
    \ [5], both of\n      which are intended to describe the same standard, but in\
    \ quite\n      different words.\n      With respect to current gateway requirements\
    \ the following can be\n      ignored, although they may be required in future:\
    \  Type of Service\n      field, Security option, Stream ID option and Timestamp\
    \ option.\n      However, if recognized, the interpretation of these quantities\n\
    \      must conform to the standard specification.\n      Note that the Internet\
    \ gateway model does not require that the\n      gateway reassemble IP datagrams\
    \ with destination address other\n      than the gateway itself.  However, in\
    \ the case of those protocols\n      in which the gateway directly participates\
    \ as a peer, including\n      routing and monitor/control protocols, the gateway\
    \ may have to\n      reassemble datagrams addressed to it.  This consideration\
    \ is most\n      pertinent to EGP.\n      Note that, of the five classes of IP\
    \ addresses.  Class-A through\n      Class-E, Class-D and Class-E addresses are\
    \ reserved for\n      experimental use.  A gateway which is not participating\
    \ in these\n      experiments should ignore all packets with a Class-D or Class-E\n\
    \      destination IP address.  No ICMP Destination Unreachable or ICMP\n    \
    \  Redirect messages should result from receiving such packets.\n   2.2.  Internet\
    \ Control Message Protocol (ICMP)\n      This is an auxiliary protocol used to\
    \ convey advice and error\n      messages and is described in RFC-792 [2].\n \
    \     The distinction between subnets of a subnetted network, which\n      depends\
    \ on an arbitrary mask as described in RFC-950 [21], is in\n      general not\
    \ visible outside that network.  This distinction is\n      important in the case\
    \ of certain ICMP messages, including the ICMP\n"

    \ ICMP Redirect messages.  The ICMP\n      Destination Unreachable message is\
    \ sent by a gateway in response\n      to a datagram which cannot be forwarded\
    \ because the destination is\n      unreachable or down.  A choice of several\
    \ types of these messages\n      is available, including one designating the destination\
    \ network\n      and another the destination host. However, the span of addresses\n\
    \      implied by the former is ill-defined unless the subnet mask is\n      known\
    \ to the sender, which is in general not the case.  It is\n      recommended that\
    \ use of the ICMP Destination Network Unreachable\n      messages be avoided.\
    \  Instead, an ICMP Destination Host\n      Unreachable message should be sent\
    \ for each distinct unreachable\n      IP address.\n      The ICMP Redirect message\
    \ is sent by a gateway to a host in order\n      to change the address used by\
    \ the host for a designated host or\n      net.  A choice of four types of messages\
    \ is available, depending\n      on whether it applies to a particular host, network\
    \ or service.\n      As in the previous case, these distinctions may depend upon\
    \ the\n      subnet mask.  As in the above case, it is recommended that the use\n\
    \      of ICMP messages implying a span of addresses (e.g.  net\n      unreachable,\
    \ net redirect) be avoided in favor of those implying\n      specific addresses\
    \ (e.g.  host unreachable, host redirect).\n      The ICMP Source Quench message\
    \ has been the subject of much\n      controversy.  It is not considered realistic\
    \ at this time to\n      specify in detail the conditions under which this message\
    \ is to be\n      generated or interpreted by a host or gateway.\n      New host\
    \ and gateway implementations are expected to support the\n      ICMP Address\
    \ Mask messages described in RFC-950.  It is highly\n      desirable, although\
    \ not required, to provide correct data for ICMP\n      Timestamp messages, which\
    \ have been found useful in network\n      debugging and maintenance.\n   2.3.\
    \  Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)\n      This is the basic protocol used to exchange\
    \ information between\n      gateway systems of the Internet and is described\
    \ in RFC-904 [11].\n      However, EGP as presently specified is an asymmetric\
    \ protocol with\n      only the \"non-core\" procedures defined in RFC-904.  There\
    \ are at\n      present no \"core\" procedures specified, which would be necessary\n\
    \      for a stand-alone Internet.  RFC-975 [27] suggests certain\n      modifications\
    \ leading to a symmetric model;  however, this is not\n      an official specification.\n\

    \ the use of EGP in this way as a\n      routing algorithm is discouraged, since\

  contents:
  - "6.  Subnetwork Architecture\n   It is recognized that gateways may also function\
    \ as general packet\n   switches to build networks of modest size.  This requires\
    \ additional\n   functionality in order to manage network routing, control and\n\
    \   configuration.  While it is beyond the scope of this document to\n   specify\
    \ the details of the mechanisms used in any particular, perhaps\n   proprietary,\
    \ architecture, there are a number of basic requirements\n   which must be provided\
    \ by any acceptable architecture.\n   6.1.  Reachability Procedures\n      The\
    \ architecture must provide a robust mechanism to establish the\n      operational\
    \ status of each link and node in the network, including\n      the gateways,\
    \ the links connecting them and, where appropriate,\n      the hosts as well.\
    \  Ordinarily, this requires at least a\n      link-level reachability protocol\
    \ involving a periodic exchange of\n      hello messages across each link.  This\
    \ function might be intrinsic\n      to the link-level protocols used (e.g.  LAPB,\
    \ DDCMP).  However, it\n      is in general ill-advised to assume a host or gateway\
    \ is operating\n      correctly if its link-level reachability protocol is operating\n\
    \      correctly.  Additional confirmation is required in the form of an\n   \
    \   operating routing algorithm or peer-level reachability protocol,\n      such\
    \ as used in EGP.\n      Failure and restoration of a link and/or gateway are\
    \ considered\n      network events and must be reported to the control center.\
    \  It is\n      desirable, although not required, that reporting paths not require\n\
    \      correct functioning of the routing algorithm itself.\n   6.2.  Routing\
    \ Algorithm\n      It has been the repeated experience of the Internet community\n\
    \      participants that the routing mechanism, whether static or\n      dynamic,\
    \ is the single most important engineering issue in network\n      design.  In\
    \ all but trivial network topologies it is necessary\n      that some degree of\
    \ routing dynamics is vital to successful\n      operation, whether it be affected\
    \ by manual or automatic means or\n      some combination of both.  In particular,\
    \ if routing changes are\n      made manually, the changes must be possible without\
    \ taking down\n      the gateways for reconfiguration and, preferably, be possible\
    \ from\n      a remote site such as a control center.\n      It is not likely\
    \ that all nets can be maintained from a\n      full-service control center, so\

    \ would normally be expected to have a\n      routing algorithm with the capability\
    \ of reacting to link and\n      other gateway failures and changing the routing\
    \ automatically.\n      Following is a list of features considered necessary:\n\
    \         1.  The algorithm must sense the failure or restoration of a\n     \
    \        link or other gateway and switch to appropriate paths\n             within\
    \ an interval less than the typical TCP user timeout\n             (one minute\
    \ is a safe assumption).\n         2.  The algorithm must never form routing loops\
    \ between\n             neighbor gateways and must contain provisions to avoid\
    \ and\n             suppress routing loops that may form between non-neighbor\n\
    \             gateways.  In no case should a loop persist for longer than\n  \
    \           an interval greater than the typical TCP user timeout.\n         3.\
    \  The control traffic necessary to operate the routing\n             algorithm\
    \ must not significantly degrade or disrupt normal\n             network operation.\
    \ Changes in state which might momentarily\n             disrupt normal operation\
    \ in a local area must not cause\n             disruption in remote areas of the\
    \ network.\n         4.  As the size of the network increases, the demand on\n\
    \             resources must be controlled in an efficient way.  Table\n     \
    \        lookups should be hashed, for example, and data-base\n             updates\
    \ handled piecemeal, with only the changes broadcast\n             over a wide\
    \ area.  Reachability and delay metrics, if used,\n             must not depend\
    \ on direct connectivity to all other\n             gateways or the use of network-specific\
    \ broadcast\n             mechanisms. Polling procedures (e.g.  for consistency\n\
    \             checking) should be used only sparingly and in no case\n       \
    \      introduce an overhead exceeding a constant independent of\n           \
    \  network topology times the longest non-looping path.\n         5.  The use\
    \ of a default gateway as a means to reduce the size\n             of the routing\
    \ data base is strongly discouraged in view of\n             the many problems\
    \ with multiple paths, loops and\n             mis-configuration vulnerabilities.\

    \ with operational\n             routes cached from external or internal data\
    \ bases via\n             either the routing algorithm or EGP.\n         6.  This\
    \ document places no restriction on the type of routing\n             algorithm,\
    \ such as node-based, link-based or any other\n             algorithm, or metric,\
    \ such as delay or hop-count.  However,\n             the size of the routing\

- title: 7.  Operation and Maintenance
  contents:
  - "7.  Operation and Maintenance\n   Gateways and packets switches are often operated\
    \ as a system by some\n   organization who agrees to operate and maintain the\
    \ gateways, as well\n   as to resolve link problems with the respective common\
    \ carriers. It\n   is important to note that the network control site may not\
    \ be\n   physically attached to the network being monitored.  In general, the\n\
    \   following requirements apply:\n      1.  Each gateway must operate as a stand-alone\
    \ device for the\n          purposes of local hardware maintenance.  Means must\
    \ be\n          available to run diagnostic programs at the gateway site using\n\
    \          only on-site tools, which might be only a diskette or tape and\n  \
    \        local terminal.  It is desirable, although not required, to\n       \
    \   run diagnostics via the network and to automatically reboot\n          and\
    \ dump the gateway via the net in case of fault.  In\n          general, this\
    \ requires special hardware.\n          The use of full-blown transport services\
    \ such as TCP is in\n          general ill-advised if required just to reboot\
    \ and dump the\n          gateway. Consideration should be given simple\n    \
    \      retransmission-overlay protocols based on UDP or specific\n          monitoring\
    \ protocols such as HMP described in RFC-869 [7].\n      2.  It must be possible\
    \ to reboot and dump the gateway manually\n          from the control site.  Every\
    \ gateway must include a watchdog\n          timer that either initiates a reboot\
    \ or signals a remote\n          control site if not reset periodically by the\
    \ software.  It is\n          desirable that the data involved reside at the control\
    \ site\n          and be transmitted via the net; however, the use of local\n\
    \          devices at the gateway site is acceptable. Nevertheless, the\n    \

  - "Requirements for Internet Gateways -- DRAFT\n          The use of full-blown\
    \ transport services such as TCP is in\n          general ill-advised if required\
    \ just to collect statistics\n          from the gateway. Consideration should\
    \ be given simple\n          retransmission-overlay protocols based on UDP or\
    \ HMP.\n      4.  Exception reports (\"traps\") occuring as the result of hardware\n\
    \          or software malfunctions should be transmitted immediately\n      \
    \    (batched to reduce packet overheads when possible) to the\n          control\
    \ site using a standard datagram protocol based on UDP\n          or HMP.\n  \
    \    5.  A mechanism must be provided to display link and node status\n      \
    \    on a continuous basis at the control site.  While it is\n          desirable\
    \ that a complete map of all links and nodes be\n          available, it is acceptable\
    \ that only those components in use\n          by the routing algorithm be displayed.\
    \  This information is\n          usually available locally at the control site,\
    \ assuming that\n          site is a participant in the routing algorithm.\n \
    \  The above functions require in general the participation of a control\n   site\
    \ or agent.  The preferred way to provide this is as a user\n   program suitable\
    \ for operation in a standard software environment\n   such as Unix.  The program\
    \ would use standard IP protocols such as\n   TCP, UDP, and HMP to control and\
    \ monitor the gateways.  The use of\n   specialized host hardware and software\
    \ requiring significant\n   additional investment is strongly discouraged;  nevertheless,\
    \ some\n   vendors may elect to provide the control agent as an integrated part\n\
    \   of the network in which the gateways are a part.  If this is the\n   case,\
    \ it is required that a means be available to operate the control\n   agent from\
    \ a remote site using Internet protocols and paths and with\n   equivalent functionality\
    \ with respect to a local agent terminal.\n   Remote control of a gateway via\
    \ Internet paths can involve either a\n   direct approach, in which the gateway\
    \ supports TCP and/or UDP\n   directly, or an indirect approach, in which the\
    \ control agent\n   supports these protocols and controls the gateway itself using\n\
    \   proprietary protocols. The former approach is preferred, although\n   either\
    \ approach is acceptable.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Ethernet Management\n   Following is a summary of procedures specified\
    \ for use by hosts and\n   gateways on an Ethernet.\n   A.1.  Hardware\n     \
    \ A packet is accepted from the cable only if its destination\n      Ethernet\
    \ address matches either the assigned interface address or\n      a broadcast/multicast\
    \ address.  Presumably, this filtering is done\n      by the interface hardware;\
    \  however, the software driver is\n      expected to do this if the hardware\
    \ does not.  Some hosts\n      incorporate an optional feature that associates\
    \ an assigned\n      multicast address with a specific subnet in order to restrict\n\
    \      access for testing, etc.  When this feature is activated, the\n      assigned\
    \ multicast address replaces the broadcast address.\n   A.2.  IP datagram\n  \
    \    In case of broadcast/multicast (as determined from the destination\n    \
    \  Ethernet address) an IP datagram is discarded if the source IP\n      address\
    \ is not in the same subnet, as determined by the assigned\n      host IP address\
    \ and subnet mask.  It is desirable that this test\n      be overridden by a configuration\
    \ parameter, in order to support\n      the infrequent cases where more than one\
    \ subnet may coexist on the\n      same cable.\n   A.3.  ARP datagram\n      An\
    \ ARP reply is discarded if the destination IP address does not\n      match the\
    \ local host address.  An ARP request is discarded if the\n      source IP address\
    \ is not in the same subnet.  It is desirable that\n      this test be overridden\
    \ by a configuration parameter, in order to\n      support the infrequent cases\
    \ where more than one subnet may\n      coexist on the same cable (see RFC-925\
    \ for examples).  An ARP\n      reply is generated only if the destination protocol\
    \ IP address is\n      reachable from the local host (as determined by the routing\n\
    \      algorithm) and the next hop is not via the same interface.  If the\n  \
    \    local host functions as a gateway, this may result in ARP replies\n     \
    \ for destinations not in the same subnet.\n   A.4.  ICMP redirect\n      An ICMP\
    \ redirect is discarded if the destination IP address does\n      not match the\
    \ local host address or the new target address is not\n      on the same subnet.\
    \  An accepted redirect updates the routing data\n      base for the old target\
    \ address.  If there is no route or\n"

    \ address, the redirect is ignored.\n      If the old route is associated with\
    \ a default gateway, a new route\n      associated with the new target address\
    \ is inserted in the data\n      base.  Note that it is not possible to send a\
    \ gratuitous redirect\n      unless the sender is possessed of considerable imagination.\n\
    \      When subnets are in use there is some ambiguity as to the scope of\n  \
    \    a redirect, unless all hosts and gateways involved have prior\n      knowledge\
    \ of the subnet masks.  It is recommended that the use of\n      ICMP network-redirect\
    \ messages be avoided in favor of ICMP\n      host-redirect messages instead.\
    \  This requires the original sender\n      (i.e.  redirect recipient) to support\
    \ a general IP\n      address-translation cache, rather than the usual network\
    \ table.\n      However, this is normally done anyway in the case of ARP.\n  \
    \    An ICMP redirect is generated only if the destination IP address\n      is\
    \ reachable from the local host (as determined by the routing\n      algorithm)\
    \ and the next hop is via the same interface and the\n      target address is\
    \ defined in the routing data base.  Redirects\n      should never be sent in\
    \ response to an IP net or subnet broadcast\n      address or in response to a\
    \ Class-D or Class-E IP address.\n      ICMP redirects are never forwarded, regardless\
    \ of destination\n      address.  The source IP address of the ICMP redirect itself\
    \ is not\n      checked, since the sending gateway may use one of its addresses\n\
    \      not on the common net.  The source IP address of the encapsulated\n   \
    \   IP datagram is not checked on the assumption the host or gateway\n      sending\
    \ the original IP datagram knows what it is doing.\n"

  - "Appendix B.  Policy Issues\n   The following sections discuss certain issues\
    \ of special concern to\n   the NSF scientific networking community.  These issues\
    \ have primary\n   relevance in the policy area, but also have ramifications in\
    \ the\n   technical area.\n   B.1.  Interconnection Technology\n      Currently\
    \ the most important common interconnection technology\n      between Internet\
    \ systems of different vendors is Ethernet.  Among\n      the reasons for this\
    \ are the following:\n         1.  Ethernet specifications are well-understood\
    \ and mature.\n         2.  Ethernet technology is in almost all aspects vendor\n\
    \             independent.\n         3.  Ethernet-compatible systems are common\
    \ and becoming more\n             so.\n      These advantages combined favor the\
    \ use of Ethernet technology as\n      the common point of demarcation between\
    \ NSF network systems\n      supplied by different vendors, regardless of technology.\
    \  It is a\n      requirement of NSF gateways that, regardless of the possibly\n\
    \      proprietary switching technology used to implement a given\n      vendor-supplied\
    \ network, its gateways must support an Ethernet\n      attachment to gateways\
    \ of other vendors.\n      It is expected that future NSF gateway requirements\
    \ will specify\n      other interconnection technologies.  The most likely candidates\n\
    \      are those based on X.25 or IEEE 802, but other technologies\n      including\
    \ broadband cable, fiber-optic or other protocols such as\n      DDCMP may also\
    \ be considered.\n   B.2.  Proprietary and Extensible Issues\n      Internet technology\
    \ is a growing, adaptable technology.  Although\n      hosts, gateways and networks\
    \ supporting this technology have been\n      in continuous operation for several\
    \ years, vendors users and\n      operators should understand that not all networking\
    \ issues are\n      fully understood. As a result, when new needs or better solutions\n\
    \      are developed for use in the NSF networking community, it may be\n    \
    \  necessary to field new protocols.  Normally, these new protocols\n      will\
    \ be designed to interoperate in all practical respects with\n      existing protocols;\
    \ however, occasionally it may happen that\n      existing systems must be upgraded\
    \ to support these protocols.\n"

    \ understand that they also undertake a\n      commitment to remain aware of current\
    \ Internet technology and be\n      prepared to upgrade their products from time\
    \ to time as\n      appropriate.  As a result, these vendors are strongly urged\
    \ to\n      consider extensibility and periodic upgrades as fundamental\n    \
    \  characteristics of their products.  One of the most productive and\n      rewarding\
    \ ways to do this on a long-term basis is to participate\n      in ongoing Internet\
    \ research and development programs in\n      partnership with the academic community.\n\
    \   B.3.  Multi-Protocol Gateways\n      Although the present requirements for\
    \ an NSF gateway specify only\n      the Internet protocol suite, it is highly\
    \ desirable that gateway\n      designs allow future extensions to support additional\
    \ suites and\n      allow simultaneous operation with more than a single one.\n\
    \      Clearly, the ISO protocol suite is a prime candidate for one of\n     \
    \ these suites.  Other candidates include XNS and DECnet.\n      Future requirements\
    \ for NSF gateways may include provisions for\n      other protocol suites in\
    \ addition to Internet, as well as models\n      and specifications to interwork\
    \ between them, should that be\n      appropriate.  For instance, it is expected\
    \ that the ISO suite will\n      eventually become the dominant one;  however,\
    \ it is also expected\n      that requirements to support other suites will continue,\
    \ perhaps\n      indefinitely.\n      Present NSF gateway requirements do not\
    \ include protocols above\n      the network layer, such as TCP, unless necessary\
    \ for network\n      monitoring or control.  Vendors should recognize that future\n\
    \      requirements to interwork between Internet and ISO applications,\n    \
    \  for example, may result in an opportunity to market gateways\n      supporting\
    \ multiple protocols at all levels through the\n      application level.  It is\
    \ expected that the network-level NSF\n      gateway requirements summarized in\
    \ this document will be\n      incorporated in the requirements document for these\n\
    \      application-level gateways.\n   B.4.  Access Control and Accounting\n \
    \     There are no requirements for NSF gateways at this time to\n      incorporate\
    \ specific access-control and accounting mechanisms in\n      the design;  however,\
    \ these important issues are currently under\n      study and will be incorporated\
    \ into a redraft of this document at\n      an early date.  Vendors are encouraged\
    \ to plan for the early\n      introduction of these mechanisms in their products.\

  - "Requirements for Internet Gateways -- DRAFT\n      time no definitive common\
    \ model for access control and accounting\n      has emerged, it is possible to\
    \ outline some general features such\n      a model is likely to have, among them\
    \ the following:\n         1.  The primary access control and accounting executive\n\
    \             mechanisms will be in the service hosts themselves, not the\n  \
    \           gateways, packet switches or workstations.\n         2.  Agents acting\
    \ on behalf of access control and accounting\n             executive mechanisms\
    \ may be necessary in the gateways,\n             packet switches or workstations.\
    \  These may be used to\n             collect data, enforce password protection\
    \ or mitigate\n             resource priority and fairness.  However, the architecture\n\
    \             and protocols used by these agents may be a local matter\n     \
    \        and not possible to specify in advance.\n         3.  NSF gateways may\
    \ be required to incorporate access control\n             and accounting mechanisms\
    \ based on packet\n             source/destination address, as well as other fields\
    \ in the\n             IP header, internal priority and fairness.  However, it\
    \ is\n             extremely unlikely that these mechanisms would involve a\n\
    \             user-level login to the gateway itself.\n"
