  - "1.  Introduction\n   Conveying location information encapsulated with a Presence\n
    \  Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) [RFC4119] document\n   within
    SIP is described in [SIP-LOC].  An alternative signaling\n   approach to location
    conveyance, which uses asynchronous\n   communication, is available with the SIP
    event notification\n   mechanisms (see RFC 3265 [RFC3265]).  This approach conveys
    location\n   information in PIDF-LO format using the presence event package\n
    \  [RFC3856].  This document focuses on the event notification paradigm.\n   Determining
    when to send event notifications with location\n   information is technically
    more challenging than deciding when to\n   send other categories of notifications,
    since location may be\n   measured as a continuous gradient.  Unlike notifications
    using\n   discrete-valued quantities, it is difficult to know when a change in\n
    \  location is sufficiently large to warrant a notification.  Event\n   notifications
    [RFC3265] can be used with filters (see RFC 4661\n   [RFC4661]) that allow the
    number of notifications to be reduced.  The\n   mechanism described in this document
    defines an extension to RFC 4661\n   [RFC4661], which limits location notification
    to events that are of\n   relevance to the subscriber.  These filters persist
    until they are\n   replaced with a newer filter or until the subscription itself
    is\n   terminated.\n   The frequency of notifications necessary for various geographic\n
    \  location applications varies dramatically.  The subscriber should be\n   able
    to get asynchronous notifications with appropriate frequency and\n   granularity,
    without being flooded with a large number of\n   notifications that are not important
    to the application.\n   This document defines new event filters and describes
    others using\n   existing mechanisms that may be relevant to a subscriber in the\n
    \  context of location filtering.  Based on the functionality defined in\n   this
    document, notifications can be provided in the following cases:\n   1.  the Target
    moves more than a specified distance since the last\n       notification (see
    Section 3.1).\n   2.  the Target exceeds a specified speed (see Section 3.2).\n
    \  3.  the Target enters or exits a 2-dimensional region, described by a\n       circle
    or a polygon (see Section 3.4).\n   4.  one or more of the values of the specified
    civic location have\n       changed for the location of the Target (see Section
    3.3).  For\n       example, the value of the civic address '<A1>' element has\n
    \      changed from 'California' to 'Nevada'.\n   5.  the type of location information
    requested (see Section 3.5)\n       changes, for example, from civic to geodetic
    location or vice\n       versa.\n   6.  a certain amount of time passes (see Section
    3.6).\n"

    as\n   noted in Section 1.  In order to reduce the number of options (and\n   thereby
    decrease the chance of interoperability problems), the\n   functionality described
    in the following sub-sections of [RFC4661]\n   MUST be implemented: the <ns-bindings>

      5: Element Value Change Example\n   Note: The civic address tokens country,
      A1, A2, ..., A6 are\n   hierarchical.  It is likely that a change in one civic
      address token\n   therefore leads to changes of tokens lower in the hierarchy,
      e.g., a\n   change in A3 ('city or town') may cause a change in A4, A5, and
      A6.\n   An implementation MUST support <ns-bindings> to replace the namespace\n
      \  prefix.  The XPath expression MUST start with a '//' followed by a\n   single
      element.  No other form of XPath expression is supported.  No\n   other variant
      is supported.  The <changed> element comes with a few\n   attributes and the
      'by', 'to', and 'from' attribute MUST be\n   implemented to support this specification.\n"

    - "3.4.  Entering or Exiting a Region\n   The <enterOrExit> condition is satisfied
      when the Target enters or\n   exits a 2-dimensional region described by a polygon
      (as defined in\n   Section 5.2.2 of [RFC5491]) or a circle (as defined in Section
      5.2.3\n   of [RFC5491]).  The <enterOrExit> element MUST contain either a\n
      \  polygon or a circle as a child element.  The <enterOrExit> element\n   MUST
      NOT have more than one polygon and/or circle.\n   If the Target was previously
      outside the region, the notifier sends a\n   notification when the Target's
      location is within the region with at\n   least 50% confidence.  Similarly,
      when a Target starts within the\n   region, a notification is sent when the
      Target's location moves\n   outside the region with at least 50% confidence.\n
      \  Note that having 50% confidence that the Target is inside the area\n   does
      not correspond to 50% outside.  The confidence that the location\n   is within
      the region, plus the confidence that the location is\n   outside the region
      is limited to the confidence of the location.  The\n   total confidence depends
      on the confidence in the location, which is\n   always less than 100% (95% is
      recommended in [RFC5491]).  The benefit\n   of this is that notifications are
      naturally limited: small movements\n   (relative to the uncertainty of the location)
      at the borders of the\n   region do not trigger notifications.\n   Figure 6
      shows filter examples whereby a notification is sent when\n   the Target enters
      or exits an area described by a circle, and\n   Figure 7 describes an area using

      SHOULD return a location by value in the form\n      of a geodetic location.\n
      \  civic:  The Notifier SHOULD return a location by value in the form of\n      a
      civic address.\n   The Notifier SHOULD return the requested location type or
      types.  The\n   location types the Notifier returns also depends on the setting
      of\n   the optional 'exact' attribute.  If the 'exact' attribute is set to\n
      \  \"true\", then the Notifier MUST return either the requested location\n   type
      or no location information.  The 'exact' attribute does not\n   apply (is ignored)
      for a request for a location type of \"any\".\n   In the case of a request for
      specific locationType(s) and the 'exact'\n   attribute is \"false\", the Notifier
      MAY provide additional location\n   types, or it MAY provide alternative types
      if the request cannot be\n   satisfied for a requested location type.\n   If
      the <locationType> element is absent, a value of \"any\" MUST be\n   assumed
      as the default.\n   The Notifier SHOULD provide civic and geodetic location
      information\n   in the response in the same order in which they were included
      in the\n   \"locationType\" element in the request, if both were explicitly\n
      \  requested.  Indeed, the primary advantage of including specific\n   location
      types in a request when the 'exact' attribute is set to\n   \"false\" is to
      ensure that one receives the available locations in a\n   specific order.  For
      example, a subscription for \"civic\" (with the\n   'exact' attribute set to
      \"false\") could yield any of the following\n   location types in the response:\n
      \  o  civic\n   o  civic, geodetic\n   o  geodetic (only if civic is not available)\n
      \  The default value of \"false\" for the 'exact' attribute allows the\n   Notifier
      the option of returning something beyond what is specified,\n   such as a set
      of location URIs when only a civic location was\n   requested.\n   An example
      is shown in Figure 8 that utilizes the <locationType>\n   element with the 'exact'
      attribute.\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n   <filter-set\n

    - "3.6.  Rate Control\n   [RFC6446] extends the SIP events framework by defining
      three Event\n   header field parameters that allow a subscriber to set a minimum,
      a\n   maximum, and an adaptive minimum of event notifications generated by\n
      \  the notifier.  This allows a subscriber to have overall control over\n   the
      stream of notifications, for example to avoid being flooded.  Two\n   of the
      parameters, namely \"min-rate\" (which specifies a minimum\n   notification
      rate per second) and \"max-rate\" (which specifies a\n   maximum notification
      rate per second) are used by this document.\n   Only the implementation of these
      two attributes is required from the\n   attributes defined in [RFC6446].  Whenever
      the time since the most\n   recent notification exceeds the interval corresponding
      to 1 / \"min-\n   rate\", the current state would be sent in its entirety, just
      like\n   after a subscription refresh.\n   A notifier is required to send a
      NOTIFY request immediately after\n   creation of a subscription.  If state is
      not available at that time,\n   then the NOTIFY request may be sent with no
      content.  A separate\n   NOTIFY containing location is subsequently generated
      so that the rate\n   of notification since the last NOTIFY falls between \"min-rate\"
      and\n   \"max-rate\".  An important use case for location-based applications\n
      \  focuses on the behavior of the initial NOTIFY message(s) and the\n   information
      it returns, for example in case of emergency call\n   routing.  When an initial
      NOTIFY is transmitted, it might not include\n   complete state.\n      Subscriber
      \         Notifier\n          |---SUBSCRIBE(1)--->|  Create subscription (w/large
      value\n          |<-------200--------|    for min-rate and max-rate)\n          |<-----NOTIFY(2)----|
      \ Return initial notify with no state\n          |--------200------->|\n          |
      \       ...        |\n          |<-----NOTIFY(3)----|  Return full state (between
      min-rate\n          |--------200------->|    and max-rate)\n          |---SUBSCRIBE(4)--->|
      \ Update subscription (to update\n          |<-------200--------|    min-rate
      and max-rate)\n               Figure 9: SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY with Rate Control\n
      \  Figure 9 shows a SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY exchange.  The initial SUBSCRIBE\n   message
      (1) has filters attached and contains a \"min-rate\" rate\n   control parameter.
      \ In certain situations, it is important to obtain\n   some amount of location
      information within a relatively short and\n   pre-defined period of time, even
      if the obtained location information\n   contains a high amount of uncertainty
      and location information with\n   less uncertainty could be available at a later
      point in time.  An\n   example is emergency call routing where an emergency
      services routing\n   proxy may need to obtain location information suitable
      for routing\n   rather quickly and subsequently a Public Safety Answering Point\n
      \  requests location information for dispatch.\n   To obtain location information
      in a timely fashion using the\n   SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY mechanism, it is RECOMMENDED
      that the initial\n   SUBSCRIBE contain a \"min-rate\" rate control parameter
      (with a large\n   value, corresponding to a very short delay before the next\n
      \  notification) that is updated in a later message to a more sensible\n   value.
      \ This provides equivalent functionality to the 'responseTime'\n   attribute
      in Section 6.1 of [RFC5985].  The \"min-rate\" for this first\n   request is
      therefore much larger (much more rapid) than the updated\n   \"min-rate\" value.
      \ Depending on the value in the \"min-rate\"\n   parameter, the Notifier may
      immediately send the initial NOTIFY\n   message (see message 2) without a body
      if no location information is\n   available at this point in time.  The desired
      location information\n   may then arrive in the subsequent NOTIFY message (see
      message 3).\n   Updating the \"min-rate\" for the subscription can be performed
      in the\n   200 response (see message 3) to the NOTIFY that contains location\n
      \  state, or in a subsequent SUBSCRIBE request (as in message 4).\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies one element, namely filters,
    utilized in\n   larger systems.  As such, this document builds on a number of\n
    \  specifications for the security of the complete solution, namely\n   o  the
    SIP event notification mechanism, described in RFC 3265\n      [RFC3265], defining
    the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages.\n   o  the presence event package, described in
    RFC 3856 [RFC3856], which\n      is a concrete instantiation of the general event
    notification\n      framework.\n   o  the filter framework, described in RFC 4661
    [RFC4661], to offer\n      the ability to reduce the amount of notifications being
    sent.\n   Finally, this document indirectly (via the SIP presence event\n   package)
    relies on PIDF-LO, described in RFC 4119 [RFC4119], as the\n   XML container that
    carries location information.\n   Each of the documents listed above comes with
    a Security\n   Considerations section but the security and privacy aspects are
    best\n   covered by the SIP presence event package; see Section 9 of\n   [RFC3856],
    and with the GEOPRIV architectural description found in\n   [RFC6280].\n   The
    functionality offered by authorization policies to limit access\n   to location
    information is provided by other protocols, such as\n   Common Policy [RFC4745],
    Geolocation Policy [GEO-POLICY], or more\n   recent work around HTTP-Enabled Location
    Delivery (HELD) context\n   [HELD].  Although [GEO-POLICY] defines a standardized
    format for\n   geolocation authorization policies, it does not define specific\n
    \  policies for controlling filters.\n   The functionality described in this document
    extends the filter\n   framework with location-specific filters.  Local policies
    might be\n   associated with the usage of certain filter constructs and with the\n
    \  amount of notifications that specific filter settings might cause.\n   Uploading
    filters have a significant effect on the ways in which the\n   request is handled
    at a server.  As a result, it is especially\n   important that messages containing
    this extension be authenticated\n   and authorized.  RFC 4661 [RFC4661] discusses
    this security threat\n   and proposes authentication and authorization solutions
    applicable to\n   this specification.\n"
