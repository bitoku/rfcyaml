Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes additional managed objects used for managing Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) interfaces not covered by the ADSL Line MIB (RFC 2662).
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The purpose of this memo is to define a supplemental set of managed objects that is not covered by the ADSL Line MIB as defined in [RFC2662].
This memo addresses the additional objects defined in ITU G.997.1 [ITU G.997.1].
Relationship of ADSL Line Extension MIB with standard MIBs
This section outlines the relationship of the ADSL Line Extension MIB with other MIBs described in RFCs and in their various degrees of standardization.
In regards to these relationships, the ADSL Line Extension MIB follows conventions as used by the ADSL Line MIB with one exception.
The value of the RFC 2863 object, ifOperstatus, SHALL be down(2) when the ADSL line interface is in power state L3, as defined in ITU G.992.1 [ITU G.992.1], which means no power.
Its value shall be up(1) if the ADSL line interface is in power state L0 (power on)
[ITU G.992.1] or L1 (reduced power).
Power Status L2 [ITU G.992.1] is not applicable.
Conventions used in the MIB 4.1  Structure
The MIB is organized to follow the same structure of the ADSL Line MIB [RFC2662].
Additional Managed Objects Objects specific to the management of ADSL G.Lite as defined in ITU
ADSL Transceiver Unit Central Office End (ATU C)
Transmission System and Line Mode Power Management Counters for Fast Retrains and Failed Fast Retrains Counters for Severe Error Second line and Unavailable Second Alternative profile configuration for the Dual line mode interface Besides the management of G.Lite, another object has been added in order to manage the ADSL line profile.
The object is the line mode configuration.
4.2.1 ATU C ADSL Transmission System Parameters and Line Mode
The adslLineConfigTable needs to be extended to cover control of the ATU C ADSL Transmission system.
Three objects are defined to monitor and configure the transmission mode as well as the actual line mode:
Capability Configuration Actual Status Transmission modes can further determine the line mode of the ADSL interface.
For example, if g9921PotsNonOverlapped(2) is the actual value of the ADSL interface, the interface is operating in Full rate ADSL.
If the interface is set to g9922PotsOverlapped(9), the interface is operating in G.Lite mode.
Transmission Mode and Line Mode
In case more than one bit is configured for an ADSL interface and
both Full and G.Lite modes are selected, the interface is said to be configured in the dual mode.
Only one bit can be set in the Actual object that reflects the actual mode of transmission as well as the line mode.
There are three possible power states for each managed ADSL interface operating in the G.Lite mode.
L0 is power on, L1 is power on but reduced and L3 is power off.
Power state cannot be configured by an operator
but it can be viewed via the ifOperStatus object for the managed ADSL interface.
The value of the object ifOperStatus is set to down(2) if the ADSL interface is in power state L3 and is set to up(1) if the ADSL line interface is in power state L0 or L1.
An ADSL line power state, if the interface is operating in the G.Lite mode, can also be monitored by the adslLineGlitePowerState object defined in the ADSL Line Extension table.
The value of the object enumerates the three power states attainable by the managed interface.
4.2.3 Fast Retrain Parameters Section 7.4.15
[ITU G.997.1] specifies fast retrain parameters.
Fast retrain parameters include two counters: fast retrain count and failed fast retrain count.
These two counters have been added to all performance tables.
4.2.4 Counters for Severely Errored Second line and Unavailable Seconds line ITU G.997.1 sections
6.2.1.1.7 and 6.2.1.1.9 specify two counters that are not covered by the ADSL Line MIB [RFC2662].
These two counters (severely errored seconds line and unavailable seconds line) are added to all the performance tables.
Unavailable seconds counts the cumulative number of seconds in which the interface was unavailable during the measured period.
This counter does not include the seconds in which unavailability was caused solely by fast retrains and failed fast retrains.
Fast retrains and failed fast retrains are considered to be part of the normal network operation and thus are not counted as unavailable errors.
4.2.5  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds For physical level events, there are counters, current 15 minute and one (up to 96) 15 minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and previous 1 day interval counters.
Threshold notification can be configured for each physical layer current 15  minute bucket.
There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship between the start of a fifteen minute and any wall clock; however some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals with quarter hours.
Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one day intervals with start of a day.
Separate tables are provided for the 96 interval counters.
They are indexed by {ifIndex, AdslAtu IntervalNumber}.
Counters are not reset when an ATU C or ATU R is reinitialized, only when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside the scope of this MIB).
The 15 minute event counters are of the type PerfCurrentCount and PerfIntervalCount.
The 1 day event counters are of the type AdslPerfCurrDayCount and AdslPerfPrevDayCount.
Both 15 minute and 1  day time elapsed counters are of the type AdslPerfTimeElapsed.
4.2.6 Alternative profile configuration for the dual line mode interface
The object, adslLineConfProfileDualLite, is used only when the interface (the ADSL line and, if applicable, channel) is configured as dual mode, that is, the object adslLineTransAtucConfig is configured with one or more full rate modes and one or more G.Lite modes.
The object adslLineConfProfile defined in ADSL MIB [RFC2662] is used as the primary full rate profile.
The newly added object in this MIB module, adslLineConfProfileDualLite, is used to describe and configure the G.Lite profile.
Note that if one or more full rate modes are configured, or only G.Lite modes are configured, only the original full rate profile is needed.
The dual mode profile object is only needed when both full rate and G.Lite profiles are needed.
In this case, it will be set to the value of adslLineConfProfile when 'dynamic' profiles are implemented.
When 'static' profiles are implemented, however, similar to the case of the object, adslLineConfProfileName [RFC2662], this object's value will need to algorithmically represent the line.
In this case, the value of the line's ifIndex plus a value indicating the line mode type (e.g., G.Lite, Full rate) will be used.
Therefore, the profile's name is a string of the concatenation of the ifIndex and one of the following values:
This string will be fixed length (i.e., 14) with leading zero(s).
For example, the profile name for ifIndex that equals '15' and is a full rate line will be '0000000015Full'.

read write STATUS current DESCRIPTION
"This object extends the definition an ADSL line and associated channels (when applicable) for cases when it is configured in dual mode, and operating in a G.Lite type mode as denoted by adslLineTransAtucActual.
Dual mode exists when the object, adslLineTransAtucConfig, is configured with one or more full rate modes and one or more G.Lite modes simultaneously.
When 'dynamic' profiles are implemented, the value of object is equal to the index of the applicable row in the ADSL Line Configuration Profile Table, AdslLineConfProfileTable
defined in ADSL MIB [RFC2662].
In the case when dual mode has not been enabled, the value of the object will be equal to the value of the object adslLineConfProfile [RFC2662].
When `static' profiles are implemented, in much like the case of the object, adslLineConfProfileName [RFC2662], this object's value will need to algorithmically represent the characteristics of the line.
In this case, the value of the line's ifIndex plus a value indicating the line mode type (e.g., G.Lite, Full rate) will be used.
Therefore, the profile's name is a string concatenating the ifIndex and one of the follow values:
This string will be fixed length (i.e., 14) with leading zero(s).
For example, the profile name for ifIndex that equals '15' and is a full rate line, it will be '0000000015Full'.

"Read only access is applicable only when static profiles as defined in ADSL Line MIB [RFC2662] are implemented."
"A collection of objects providing raw performance counts on an ADSL Line (ATU C end)."
The following security matters should be considered when implementing this MIB.
1) Blocking unauthorized access to the ADSL MIB via the element management system is outside the scope of this document.
It should be noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity to modify the profiles (section 6.4) such that both subscriber service and network operations can be interfered with.
Subscriber service can be altered by modifying any of a number of service characteristics such as rate partitioning and maximum transmission rates.
Network operations can be impacted by modifying notification thresholds such as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) margins.
2) SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control over who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET (read)
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the View based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to only those objects, and to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
The profile mechanism presented in this document requires specific attention.
The implementor of this MIB has a choice of implementing either 'static' or 'dynamic' profiles.
This decision must be consistent with the implementation of RFC 2662.
In the case of 'static' profiles, the elements of the profile are read write, as opposed to read create when 'dynamic' profiles are implemented: adslConfProfileLineType, adslAtucThreshold15MinFailedFastR, adslAtucThreshold15MinSesL, adslAtucThreshold15MinUasL, adslAturThreshold15MinSesL, and adslAturThreshold15MinUasL.
This decision also impacts the mechanics of the index, adslLineConfProfileDualLite.
When 'static' profiles are implemented, its value is algorithmically set by the system and its value is based on the ifIndex.
Hence it is not guaranteed across system reboots.
Similar to the handling of adslLineConfProfile [RFC2662], the implementor of this MIB must ensure that the profile object values associated with these indices are maintained across system reboots.
In the case of dynamic profiles, this object is set by the SNMP manager.
The implementor of this MIB may want to provide a view of the profile on a customer by customer standpoint, but should be cautious of the dynamic nature of these objects.
ADSL layer connectivity from the ATU R will permit the subscriber to manipulate both the ADSL link directly and the ADSL overhead control channel(AOC)/embedded operations channel (EOC) for their own loop.
For example,  unchecked or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either the management interface to the network or the element manager.
Other attacks affecting the ATU R portions of the MIB may also be possible.
