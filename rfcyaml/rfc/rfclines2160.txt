This document describes methods for carrying PostScript information in the two standard mail systems MIME and X.400, and the conversion between them.
It uses the notational conventions of [BODYMAP], and the conversion is further described in [MIXER].
Two ways of carrying PostScript in X.400 are described.
One is using the FTAM Body Part, and one uses the Extended Body Part originally described in RFC 1494.
The FTAM method is recommended.
The PostScript body part Carrying PostScript in X.400 as an Extended Body Part was originally defined in RFC 1494.
This specification carries that work forward now that RFC 1494 is obsoleted by [BODYMAP].
The following Extended Body Part is defined for PostScript data streams.
postscript body part EXTENDED BODY PART TYPE DATA
The PostScript FTBP is identified by having the FileTransferParameters.environment.application reference set to id  mime ftbp postscript.
The Application/PostScript content type In MIME
, PostScript is carried in the body part "application/PostScript", which is defined in RFC 1521.
Extended Body Part, OID mime postscript body MIME Content Type: application/postscript
The two representations of PostScript both contain a single stream of octets.
This stream of octets can be copied with no problems between the representations.
No other data needs to be converted.
X.400 Body Part: FTBP, OID mime ftbp postscript body MIME Content
The two representations of PostScript both contain a single stream of octets.
This stream of octets can be copied with no problems between the representations.
No other data needs to be converted.
The first OID is also defined in [BODYMAP].

The issues concerning PostScript and security are well discussed in RFC 2046.
No additional security issues are identified by this memo.
