  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Experience with the 6to4 transition mechanism defined in RFC 3056\n\
    \   (\"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds\") has shown that the\n   mechanism\
    \ is unsuitable for widespread deployment and use in the\n   Internet when used\
    \ in its anycast mode.  Therefore, this document\n   requests that RFC 3068 (\"\
    An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers\")\n   and RFC 6732 (\"6to4 Provider\
    \ Managed Tunnels\") be made obsolete and\n   moved to Historic status.  It recommends\
    \ that future products should\n   not support 6to4 anycast and that existing deployments\
    \ should be\n   reviewed.  This complements the guidelines in RFC 6343.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The original form of the 6to4 transition mechanism [RFC3056]\
    \ relies\n   on unicast addressing.  However, its extension specified in \"An\n\
    \   Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers\" [RFC3068] has been shown to\n   have\
    \ severe practical problems when used in the Internet.  This\n   document requests\
    \ that RFCs 3068 and 6732 be moved to Historic\n   status, as defined in Section\
    \ 4.2.4 of [RFC2026].  It complements the\n   deployment guidelines in [RFC6343].\n\
    \   6to4 was designed to help transition the Internet from IPv4 to IPv6.\n   It\
    \ has been a good mechanism for experimenting with IPv6, but because\n   of the\
    \ high failure rates seen with anycast 6to4 [HUSTON], end users\n   may end up\
    \ disabling IPv6 on hosts; this has resulted in some content\n   providers being\
    \ reluctant to make content available over IPv6 in the\n   past.\n   [RFC6343]\
    \ analyzes the known operational issues in detail and\n   describes a set of suggestions\
    \ to improve 6to4 reliability, given the\n   widespread presence of hosts and\
    \ customer premises equipment that\n   support it.  The advice to disable 6to4\
    \ by default has been widely\n   adopted in recent operating systems, and the\
    \ failure modes have been\n   widely hidden from users by many browsers adopting\
    \ the \"Happy\n   Eyeballs\" approach [RFC6555].\n   Nevertheless, a measurable\
    \ amount of 6to4 traffic is still observed\n   by IPv6 content providers.  The\
    \ remaining successful users of anycast\n   6to4 are likely to be on hosts using\
    \ the obsolete policy table\n   [RFC3484] (which prefers 6to4 above IPv4) and\
    \ running without Happy\n   Eyeballs.  Furthermore, they must have a route to\
    \ an operational\n   anycast relay and they must be accessing an IPv6 host that\
    \ has a\n   route to an operational return relay.\n   However, experience shows\
    \ that operational failures caused by anycast\n   6to4 have continued despite\
    \ the advice in RFC 6343 being available.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Related Work\n   \"IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd)\
    \ -- Protocol\n   Specification\" [RFC5969] explicitly builds on the 6to4 mechanism,\n\
    \   using a service provider prefix instead of 2002::/16.  However, the\n   deployment\
    \ model is based on service provider support such that 6rd\n   avoids the problems\
    \ observed with anycast 6to4.\n   The framework for \"6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels\"\
    \ [RFC6732] is\n   intended to help a service provider manage 6to4 anycast tunnels.\n\
    \   This framework only exists because of the problems observed with\n   anycast\
    \ 6to4.\n"

- title: 3.  6to4 Operational Problems
  contents:
  - "3.  6to4 Operational Problems\n   6to4 is a mechanism designed to allow isolated\
    \ IPv6 islands to reach\n   each other using IPv6-over-IPv4 automatic tunneling.\
    \  To reach the\n   native IPv6 Internet, the mechanism uses relay routers in\
    \ both the\n   forward and reverse direction.  The mechanism is supported in many\n\
    \   IPv6 implementations.  With the increased deployment of IPv6, the\n   mechanism\
    \ has been shown to have a number of shortcomings.\n   In the forward direction,\
    \ a 6to4 node will send IPv4-encapsulated\n   IPv6 traffic to a 6to4 relay that\
    \ is connected to both the 6to4 cloud\n   and native IPv6.  In the reverse direction,\
    \ a 2002::/16 route is\n   injected into the native IPv6 routing domain to attract\
    \ traffic from\n   native IPv6 nodes to a 6to4 relay router.  It is expected that\n\
    \   traffic will use different relays in the forward and reverse\n   direction.\n\
    \   One model of 6to4 deployment, described in Section 5.2 of RFC 3056,\n   suggests\
    \ that a 6to4 router should have a set of managed connections\n   (via BGP connections)\
    \ to a set of 6to4 relay routers.  While this\n   makes the forward path more\
    \ controlled, it does not guarantee a\n   functional reverse path.  In any case,\
    \ this model has the same\n   operational burden as manually configured tunnels\
    \ and has seen no\n   deployment in the public Internet.\n   RFC 3068 adds an\
    \ extension that allows the use of a well-known IPv4\n   anycast address to reach\
    \ the nearest 6to4 relay in the forward\n   direction.  However, this anycast\
    \ mechanism has a number of\n   operational issues and problems, which are described\
    \ in detail in\n   Section 3 of [RFC6343].  This document is intended to deprecate\
    \ the\n   anycast mechanism.\n   Peer-to-peer usage of the 6to4 mechanism exists\
    \ in the Internet,\n   likely unknown to many operators.  This usage is harmless\
    \ to third\n   parties and is not dependent on the anycast 6to4 mechanism that\
    \ this\n   document deprecates.\n"
- title: 4.  Deprecation
  contents:
  - "4.  Deprecation\n   This document formally deprecates the anycast 6to4 transition\n\
    \   mechanism defined in [RFC3068] and the associated anycast IPv4\n   address\
    \ 192.88.99.1.  It is no longer considered to be a useful\n   service of last\
    \ resort.\n   The prefix 192.88.99.0/24 MUST NOT be reassigned for other use except\n\
    \   by a future IETF Standards Action.\n   The basic unicast 6to4 mechanism defined\
    \ in [RFC3056] and the\n   associated 6to4 IPv6 prefix 2002::/16 are not deprecated.\
    \  The\n   default address selection rules specified in [RFC6724] are not\n  \
    \ modified.\n   In the absence of 6to4 anycast, \"6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels\"\
    \n   [RFC6732] will no longer be necessary, so they are also deprecated by\n \
    \  this document.\n   Incidental references to 6to4 should be reviewed and possibly\
    \ removed\n   from other IETF documents if and when they are updated.  These\n\
    \   documents include RFC 3162, RFC 3178, RFC 3790, RFC 4191, RFC 4213,\n   RFC\
    \ 4389, RFC 4779, RFC 4852, RFC 4891, RFC 4903, RFC 5157, RFC 5245,\n   RFC 5375,\

- title: 5.  Implementation Recommendations
  contents:
  - "5.  Implementation Recommendations\n   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to include the anycast\
    \ 6to4 transition\n   mechanism in new implementations.  If included in any\n\
    \   implementations, the anycast 6to4 mechanism MUST be disabled by\n   default.\n\
    \   In host implementations, unicast 6to4 MUST also be disabled by\n   default.\
    \  All hosts using 6to4 MUST support the IPv6-address-\n   selection policy described\
    \ in [RFC6724].\n   In router implementations, 6to4 MUST be disabled by default.\
    \  In\n   particular, enabling IPv6 forwarding on a device MUST NOT\n   automatically\
    \ enable 6to4.\n"
- title: 6.  Operational Recommendations
  contents:
  - "6.  Operational Recommendations\n   This document does not imply a recommendation\
    \ for the generalized\n   filtering of traffic or routes for 6to4 or even anycast\
    \ 6to4.  It\n   simply recommends against further deployment of the anycast 6to4\n\
    \   mechanism, calls for current 6to4 deployments to evaluate the\n   efficacy\
    \ of continued use of the anycast 6to4 mechanism, and makes\n   recommendations\
    \ intended to prevent any use of 6to4 from hampering\n   broader deployment and\
    \ use of native IPv6 on the Internet as a whole.\n   Networks SHOULD NOT filter\
    \ out packets whose source address is\n   192.88.99.1, because this is normal\
    \ 6to4 traffic from a 6to4 return\n   relay somewhere in the Internet.  This includes\
    \ ensuring that traffic\n   from a local 6to4 return relay with a source address\
    \ of 192.88.99.1\n   is allowed through anti-spoofing filters (such as those described\
    \ in\n   [RFC2827] and [RFC3704]) or through Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding\n\
    \   (uRPF) checks [RFC5635].\n   The guidelines in Section 4 of [RFC6343] remain\
    \ valid for those who\n   choose to continue operating anycast 6to4 despite its\
    \ deprecation.\n   Current operators of an anycast 6to4 relay with the IPv4 address\n\
    \   192.88.99.1 SHOULD review the information in [RFC6343] and the\n   present\
    \ document, and then consider carefully whether the anycast\n   relay can be discontinued\
    \ as traffic diminishes.  Internet service\n   providers that do not operate an\
    \ anycast relay but do provide their\n   customers with a route to 192.88.99.1\
    \ SHOULD verify that it does in\n   fact lead to an operational anycast relay,\
    \ as discussed in\n   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6343].  Furthermore, Internet service\
    \ providers\n   and other network providers MUST NOT originate a route to\n  \
    \ 192.88.99.1, unless they actively operate and monitor an anycast 6to4\n   relay\
    \ service as detailed in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6343].\n   Operators of a 6to4 return\
    \ relay responding to the IPv6 prefix\n   2002::/16 SHOULD review the information\
    \ in [RFC6343] and the present\n   document, and then consider carefully whether\
    \ the return relay can be\n   discontinued as traffic diminishes.  To avoid confusion,\
    \ note that\n   nothing in the design of 6to4 assumes or requires that return\
    \ packets\n   are handled by the same relay as outbound packets.  As discussed\
    \ in\n   Section 4.5 of RFC 6343, content providers might choose to continue\n\
    \   operating a return relay for the benefit of their own residual 6to4\n   clients.\
    \  Internet service providers SHOULD announce the IPv6 prefix\n   2002::/16 to\
    \ their own customers if and only if it leads to a\n   correctly operating return\
    \ relay as described in RFC 6343.  IPv6-only\n   service providers, including\
    \ those operating a NAT64 service\n   [RFC6146], are advised that their own customers\
    \ need a route to such\n   a relay in case a residual 6to4 user served by a different\
    \ service\n   provider attempts to communicate with them.\n   Operators of \"\
    6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels\" [RFC6732] SHOULD\n   carefully consider when this\
    \ service can be discontinued as traffic\n   diminishes.\n"

    \ and added a reference to this RFC.\n   The Boolean values for the address block\
