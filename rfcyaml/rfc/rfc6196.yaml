  - "1.  Introduction and Overview\n   RFC 1738 [RFC1738] registers the mailserver:
    URI scheme as\n   provisional in the IANA URI registry defined by [RFC4395], defining\n
    \  it as \"Access to data available from mail servers\" with no further\n   details
    provided.  The author of this document is not aware of any\n   other more detailed
    definition of the mailserver: URI scheme.  The\n   mailserver: URI scheme as currently
    specified is not interoperable.\n   There is a small risk that somebody would
    decide to implement this\n   scheme by looking at IANA's URI scheme registry,
    possibly inventing\n   some undocumented syntax for it.  In order to minimize
    such risk,\n   this document discourages any future implementations of this URI\n
    \  scheme and asks IANA to mark it as Historic in the URI scheme\n   registry.\n
    \  There were some previous attempts to provide detailed documentation\n   of
    the mailserver: URI scheme, but those efforts were not successful.\n   Implementors
    interested in providing instructions for generating an\n   email [RFC5322] message
    can instead use the mailto: URI scheme\n   [RFC6068].  Implementors interested
    in referencing a message or a set\n   of messages available from a mailstore over
    IMAP [RFC3501], POP\n   [RFC1939], or web [RFC2616] can instead use the imap:
    [RFC5092], pop:\n   [RFC2384] or http: [RFC2616] URIs, respectively.\n"

  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   In the past, the mailserver: URI scheme was never
    properly documented\n   and thus doesn't interoperate.  There are no known implementations
    of\n   this URI scheme.\n"
  title: 2.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has re-registered the mailserver: URI scheme
    as Historic in the\n   URI scheme registry and updated the reference to point
    to this\n   document.\n"
