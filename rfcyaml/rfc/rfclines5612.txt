Abstract This document describes an Enterprise Number (also known as SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code) for use in documentation.
[RFC1065] (later superceded by [RFC1155] and [RFC2578])
created a subtree (arc) of object identifiers (OIDs) for identifying management objects that are defined unilaterally by a single party, such as an enterprise.
The subtree for a particular enterprise consists of the prefix "1.3.6.1.4.1.", followed by the Enterprise Number assigned for that enterprise.
Enterprise Numbers are allocated by IANA, and are also known as "Private Enterprise Numbers", "Enterprise Codes", and "SMI (Structure of Management Information)
Network Management Private Enterprise Codes".
See the "Private Enterprise Number Application Form" [Application] for more information on how to request an Enterprise Number from IANA, and [Numbers] for the list of currently assigned numbers.
Enterprise Numbers have also been used for many other purposes than OIDs in various protocols; for example:  "STRUCTURED DATA" identifiers in Syslog [RFC5424]  "Vendor Specific" RADIUS attributes [RFC2865]
Mobile IPv4 vendor/organization specific extensions [RFC3115]  User defined error information in RSVP [RFC5284]
Vendor options in DHCPv4 [RFC3925]  Enterprise specific information elements in the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol [RFC5101] Documents related to these protocols may include examples that contain Enterprise Numbers.
To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, this document specifies an Enterprise Number for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.
This Enterprise Number is not intended to be implemented.
It is not expected that any implementation would send it, or that any implementation would treat it specially when receiving it.
The Enterprise Number 32473 has been allocated for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.
IANA Considerations IANA has updated the registration for Enterprise Number 32473 to point to this RFC. 4.
Security Considerations Allocating an enterprise number for documentation use does not have any direct impact on security.
