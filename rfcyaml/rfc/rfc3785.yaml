    \ to the Traffic Engineering (TE) metric for Constraint Based\n   Routing of MultiProtocol\
    \ Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering\n   tunnels.  This effectively results\
    \ in the ability to perform\n   Constraint Based Routing with optimization of\
    \ one metric (e.g., link\n   bandwidth) for some Traffic Engineering tunnels (e.g.,\
    \ Data Trunks)\n   while optimizing another metric (e.g., propagation delay) for\
    \ some\n   other tunnels with different requirements (e.g., Voice Trunks).  No\n\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing protocols (OSPF\
    \ and IS-IS) as\n   well as MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) signaling protocols\n\
    \   (RSVP-TE and CR-LDP) have been extended (as specified in [ISIS-TE],\n   [OSPF-TE],\
    \ [RSVP-TE] and [CR-LDP]) in order to support the Traffic\n   Engineering (TE)\
    \ functionality as defined in [TE-REQ].\n   These IGP routing protocol extensions\
    \ currently include advertisement\n   of a single additional MPLS TE metric to\
    \ be used for Constraint Based\n   Routing of TE tunnels.\n   However, the objective\
    \ of traffic engineering is to optimize the use\n   and the performance of the\
    \ network.  So it seems relevant that TE\n   tunnel placement may be optimized\
    \ according to different optimization\n   criteria.  For example, some Service\
    \ Providers want to perform\n   traffic engineering of different classes of service\
    \ separately so\n   that each class of Service is transported on a different TE\
    \ tunnel.\n   One example motivation for doing so is to apply different fast\n\
    \   restoration policies to the different classes of service.  Another\n   example\
    \ motivation is to take advantage of separate Constraint Based\n   Routing in\
    \ order to meet the different Quality of Service (QoS)\n   objectives of each\
    \ Class of Service.  Depending on QoS objectives one\n   may require either (a)\
    \ enforcement by Constraint Based Routing of\n   different bandwidth constraints\
    \ for the different classes of service\n   as defined in [DS-TE], or (b) optimizing\
    \ on a different metric during\n   Constraint Based Routing or (c) both.  This\
    \ document discusses how\n   optimizing on a different metric can be achieved\
    \ during Constraint\n   Based Routing.\n   The most common scenario for a different\
    \ metric calls for\n   optimization of a metric reflecting delay (mainly propagation\
    \ delay)\n   when Constraint Based Routing TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that\n\
    \   will be transporting voice, while optimizing a more usual metric\n   (e.g.,\
    \ reflecting link bandwidth) when Constraint Based Routing TE\n   LSPs that will\
    \ be transporting data.\n   Additional IGP protocol extensions could be defined\
    \ so that multiple\n   TE metrics could be advertised in the IGP (as proposed\
    \ for example in\n   [METRICS]) and would thus be available to Constraint Based\
    \ Routing in\n   order to optimize on a different metric.  However this document\n\
    \   describes how optimizing on a different metric can be achieved today\n   by\
    \ existing implementations and deployments, without any additional\n   IGP extensions\
    \ beyond [ISIS-TE] and [OSPF-TE], by effectively using\n   the IGP metric as a\
    \ \"second\" TE metric.\n"
- title: 2.  Common Practice
  contents:
  - "2.  Common Practice\n   In current MPLS TE deployments, network administrators\
    \ often want\n   Constraint Based Routing of TE LSPs carrying data traffic to\
    \ be based\n   on the same metric as the metric used for Shortest Path Routing.\n\
    \   Where this is the case, this practice allows the Constraint Based\n   Routing\
    \ algorithm running on the Head-End LSR to use the IGP metric\n   advertised in\
    \ the IGP to compute paths for data TE LSPs instead of\n   the advertised TE metric.\
    \  The TE metric can then be used to convey\n   another metric (e.g., a delay-based\
    \ metric) which can be used by the\n   Constraint Based Routing algorithm on the\
    \ Head-End LSR to compute\n   path for the TE LSPs with different requirements\
    \ (e.g., Voice TE\n   LSP).\n   In some networks, network administrators configure\
    \ the IGP metric to\n   a value factoring the link propagation delay.  In that\
    \ case, this\n   practice allows the Constraint Based Routing algorithm running\
    \ on the\n   Head-End LSR to use the IGP metric advertised in the IGP to compute\n\
    \   paths for delay-sensitive TE LSPs (e.g., Voice TE LSPs) instead of\n   the\
    \ advertised TE metric.  The TE metric can then be used to convey\n   another\
    \ metric (e.g., bandwidth based metric) which can be used by\n   the Constraint\
    \ Based Routing algorithm to compute paths for the data\n   TE LSPs.\n   More\
    \ generally, the TE metric can be used to carry any arbitrary\n   metric that\
    \ may be useful for Constraint Based Routing of the set of\n   LSPs which need\
    \ optimization on another metric than the IGP metric.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Head-End LSR Implementation Practice\n   A Head-End LSR implements the\
    \ current practice by:\n   (i)   Allowing configuration, for each TE LSP to be\
    \ routed, of\n         whether the IGP metric or the TE metric is to be used by\
    \ the\n         Constraint Based Routing algorithm.\n   (ii)  Enabling the Constraint\
    \ Based Routing algorithm to make use of\n         either the TE metric or the\

    \      Constraint Based Routing of some LSPs as an alternative metric\n      \
    \   to the IGP metric\n   (ii)  Configuring, for every TE LSP, whether this LSP\
    \ is to be\n         constraint based routed according to the TE metric or IGP\n\
    \         metric\n"
- title: 2.3.  Constraints
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Constraints\n   The practice described in this document has the following\n\
    \   constraints:\n   (i)   it only allows TE tunnels to be routed on either of\
    \ two metrics\n         (i.e., it cannot allow TE tunnels to be routed on one\
    \ of three,\n         or more, metrics).  Extensions (for example such as those\n\
    \         proposed in [METRICS]) could be defined in the future if\n         necessary\
    \ to relax this constraints, but this is outside the\n         scope of this document.\n\
    \   (ii)  it can only be used where the IGP metric is appropriate as one\n   \
    \      of the two metrics to be used for constraint based routing\n         (i.e.,\
    \ it cannot allow TE tunnels to be routed on either of two\n         metrics while\
    \ allowing IGP SPF to be based on a third metric).\n         Extensions (for example\
    \ such as those proposed in [METRICS])\n         could be defined in the future\
    \ if necessary to relax this\n         constraints, but this is outside the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   (iii) it can only be used on links which support an IGP\
    \ adjacency so\n         that an IGP metric is indeed advertised for the link.\
    \  For\n         example, this practice can not be used on Forwarding\n      \
    \   Adjacencies (see [LSP-HIER]).\n   Note that, as with [METRICS], this practice\
    \ does not recommend that\n   the TE metric and the IGP metric be used simultaneously\
    \ during path\n   computation for a given LSP.  This is known to be an NP-complete\n\
    \   problem.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Interoperability
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Interoperability\n   Where path computation is entirely performed by the\
    \ Head-End (e.g.,\n   intra-area operations with path computation on Head-end),\
    \ this\n   practice does not raise any interoperability issue among LSRs since\n\
    \   the use of one metric or the other is a matter purely local to the\n   Head-End\
    \ LSR.\n   Where path computation involves another component than the Head-End\n\
    \   (e.g., with inter-area operations where path computation is shared\n   between\
    \ the Head-End and Area Boundary Routers or a Path Computation\n   Server), this\
    \ practice requires that which metric to optimize on, be\n   signaled along with\
    \ the other constraints (bandwidth, affinity) for\n   the LSP.  See [PATH-COMP]\
    \ for an example proposal on how to signal\n   which metric to optimize, to another\
    \ component involved in path\n   computation when RSVP-TE is used as the protocol\
    \ to signal path\n   computation information.\n"
- title: 3.  Migration Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Migration Considerations\n   Service Providers need to consider how to migrate\
    \ from the current\n   implementation to the new one supporting this practice.\n\
    \   Although the head-end routers act independently from each other, some\n  \
    \ migration scenarios may require that all head-end routers be upgraded\n   to\
    \ the new implementation to avoid any disruption on existing TE-LSPs\n   before\
    \ two metrics can effectively be used by TE.  The reason is that\n   routers with\
    \ current implementation are expected to always use the TE\n   metric for Constraint\
    \ Based Routing of all tunnels; so when the TE\n   metric is reconfigured to reflect\
    \ the \"second metric\" (say to a\n   delay-based metric) on links in the network,\
    \ then all TE-LSPs would\n   get routed based on the \"second metric\" metric,\
    \ while the intent may\n   be that only the TE-LSPs explicitly configured so should\
    \ be routed\n   based on the \"second metric\".\n   A possible migration scenario\
    \ would look like this:\n   1) upgrade software on all head-end routers in the\
    \ network to support\n      this practice.\n   2) change the TE-LSPs configuration\
    \ on the head-end routers to use\n      the IGP metric (e.g., bandwidth-based)\
    \ for Constraint Based\n      Routing rather than the TE metric.\n   3) configure\
    \ TE metric on the links to reflect the \"second metric\"\n      (e.g., delay-based).\n\
    \   4) modify the LSP configuration of the subset of TE-LSPs which need\n    \
    \  to be Constraint Based routed using the \"second metric\" (e.g.,\n      delay-based),\
    \ and/or create new TE-LSPs with such a configuration.\n   It is desirable that\
    \ step 2 is non-disruptive (i.e., the routing of a\n   LSP will not be affected\
    \ in any way, and the data transmission will\n   not be interrupted) by the change\
    \ of LSP configuration to use \"IGP\n   metric\" as long as the actual value of\
    \ the \"IGP metric\" and \"TE\n   metric\" are equal on every link at the time\
    \ of LSP reconfiguration\n   (as would be the case at step 2 in migration scenario\
    \ above which\n   assumed that TE metric was initially equal to IGP metric).\n"
