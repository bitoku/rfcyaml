  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multihoming support on IP hosts can greatly improve the
    user\n   experience.  With the simultaneous use of multiple access networks,\n
    \  multihoming brings better network connectivity, reliability, and\n   improved
    quality of communication.  The following are some of the\n   goals and benefits
    of multihoming support:\n   o  Redundancy/Fault-Recovery\n   o  Load balancing\n
    \  o  Load sharing\n   o  Preference settings\n   According to [RFC4908], users
    of small-scale networks can benefit\n   from a mobile and fixed multihomed architecture
    using mobile IP\n   [RFC6275] and Network Mobility (NEMO) [RFC3963].\n   The motivation
    for this work is to extend the PMIPv6 protocol with\n   multihoming extensions
    [RFC4908] for realizing the following\n   capabilities:\n   o  Using GRE as mobile
    tunneling, possibly with its key extension\n      [RFC5845].\n   o  Using UDP
    encapsulation [RFC5844] in order to support NAT\n      traversal in an IPv4 networking
    environment.\n   o  Using the prefix delegation mechanism [RFC7148].\n   o  Using
    the Vendor Specific Mobility Option [RFC5094], for example,\n      to allow the
    MAG and LMA to exchange information (e.g., WAN\n      interface QoS metrics),
    which allows the appropriate traffic-\n      steering decisions to be made.\n
    \  PMIPv6 relies on two mobility entities: the MAG, which acts as the\n   default
    gateway for the end node (either a mobile or a fixed node)\n   attached to the
    MAG's access links, and the LMA, which acts as the\n   topological anchor point.
    \ IP tunnel is created with any one of the\n   supported encapsulation mode between
    the MAG and the LMA.  Then, the\n   MAG and LMA distribute the end node's traffic
    over these tunnels.\n   All PMIPv6 operations are performed on behalf of the end
    node and its\n   correspondent node.  Thus, it makes PMIPv6 well adapted to multihomed\n
    \  architecture as considered in [RFC4908].  Taking the LTE and WLAN\n   networking
    environments as examples, the PMIPv6-based multihomed\n   architecture is depicted
    in Figure 1.  In this example, IP flows,\n   Flow-1 and Flow-3 are routed over
    Tunnel-1 and Flow-2 is routed over\n   Tunnel-2.  However, IP traffic belonging
    to Flow-4 is distributed on\n   both Tunnel-1 and Tunnel-2 paths.\n     Flow-1\n

      support with PMIPv6.\n   The MAG in this example scenario is equipped with both
      WLAN and LTE\n   interfaces and is also configured with the multihoming functionality.\n
      \  The steps of the call flow are as follows:\n   Steps (1) and (2): The MAG
      attaches to both WLAN and LTE networks.\n   Then, the MAG obtains two different
      pCoAs, respectfully.\n   Step (3): The MAG sends, over the LTE access, a Proxy
      Binding Update\n   (PBU) message with the new MAG Multipath Binding (MMB) and
      MAG\n   Network Access Identifier (MAG-NAI) options to the LMA.  The request\n
      \  can be for a physical mobile node attached to the MAG or for a\n   logical
      mobile node configured on the mobile access gateway.  A\n   logical mobile node
      is a logical representation of a mobile node in\n   the form of a configuration
      that is always enabled on the MAG.  The\n   mobility session that is created
      (i.e., create a Binding Cache Entry\n   (BCE)) on the LMA will be marked with
      multipath support.\n   Step (4): The LMA sends back a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
      (PBA)\n   including the Home Network Prefix (HNP) and other session parameters\n
      \  allocated for that mobility session.\n   Step (5): IP tunnel is created between
      the MAG and the LMA over LTE\n   access with any one of the supported encapsulation
      modes.\n   Steps (6) to (8): The MAG repeats steps (3) to (5) on the WLAN\n
      \  access.  The MAG includes the HNP, received on step (4) in the PBU.\n   The
      LMA updates its binding cache by creating a new mobility session\n   for this
      MAG.\n   Steps (9) and (10): The IP hosts MN_1 and MN_2 are assigned IP\n   addresses
      from the mobile network prefix delegated to the MAG by the\n   LMA.\n   +=====+

    - "3.2.  Traffic Distribution Schemes\n   When the MAG has registered a multipath
      binding with the LMA, there\n   will be multiple established overlay tunnels
      between them.  The MAG\n   and the LMA can use any one, or more, of the available
      tunnel paths\n   for routing the mobile node's IP traffic.  This specification
      does\n   not recommend or define any specific traffic distribution scheme.\n
      \  However, it identifies two well-known approaches that implementations\n   can
      potentially use.  These approaches are per-flow and per-packet\n   traffic distribution
      schemes.\n   Per-Flow Traffic Distribution:\n   o  In this approach, the MAG
      and the LMA associate each of the IP\n      flows (upstream and downstream)
      with a specific tunnel path.  The\n      packets in a given IP flow are always
      routed on the same overlay\n      tunnel path; they are never split and routed
      concurrently on more\n      than one tunnel path.  It is possible for a given
      flow to be moved\n      from one tunnel path to another, but the flow is never
      split.  The\n      decision to bind a given IP flow to a specific tunnel path
      is\n      based on the traffic distribution policy.  This traffic\n      distribution
      policy is either statically configured on both the\n      MAG and the LMA or
      dynamically negotiated over PMIPv6 signaling.\n      The Flow Binding extension
      [RFC6089] and Traffic Selectors for\n      Flow Bindings [RFC6088] define the
      mechanism and the semantics for\n      exchanging the traffic policy between
      two tunnel peers; the same\n      mechanism and the mobility options are used
      here.\n   Per-Packet Traffic Distribution:\n   o  In this approach, packets
      belonging to a given IP flow will be\n      split and routed across more than
      one tunnel path.  The exact\n      approach for traffic distribution or the
      distribution weights is\n      outside the scope of this specification.  In
      a very simplistic\n      approach, assuming that the established tunnel paths
      have\n      symmetric characteristics, the packets can be equally distributed\n
      \     on all the available tunnel paths.  In a different scenario, when\n      the
      links have different speeds, the chosen approach can be based\n      on weighted
      distribution (e.g., n:m ratio).  However, in any of\n      these chosen approaches,
      implementations have to be sensitive to\n      issues related to asymmetric
      link characteristics and the\n      resulting issues such as reordering, buffering,
      and the impact on\n      application performance.  Care must be taken to ensure
      that there\n      is no negative impact on the application performance due to
      the\n      use of this approach.\n"

      LTE interface\n      with a label \"11\".  Furthermore, the same label may be
      configured\n      on two WAN interfaces of similar characteristics (e.g., two\n
      \     Ethernet interfaces with the same label).\n      Interface labels are
      signaled from the MAG to the LMA in the PBU\n      messages and both the LMA
      and MAG will be able to mark each of the\n      dynamically created Binding/Tunnel
      with the associated label.\n      These labels are used in generating consistent
      application-routing\n      rules on the both the LMA and the MAG.  For example,
      there can be\n      a policy requiring HTTP packets to be routed over an interface\n
      \     that has the interface label of \"9\", and if any of the interfaces\n
      \     with interface label \"9\" are not available, the traffic needs to\n      be
      routed over the interface with the interface label \"11\".  The\n      MAG and
      the LMA will be able to apply this routing rule with the\n      exchange of
      interface labels in PBU messages and by associating\n      the application flows
      to tunnels with the matching interface\n      labels.\n   Binding Identifier
      (BID)\n      This 8-bit unsigned integer is used for identifying the binding.\n
      \     The permitted values are 1 through 254.  The values 0 and 255 are\n      reserved.\n
      \     The MAG identifies each of the mobile node's bindings with a\n      unique
      identifier.  The MAG includes the identifier in the PBU\n      message; when
      the PBU request is accepted by the LMA, the\n      resulting binding is associated
      with this BID in the mobile node's\n      Binding Cache entry.\n   Bulk Re-registration
      Flag (B)\n      If set to a value of (1), this flag notifies the LMA to consider\n
      \     this as a request to update the binding lifetime of all the mobile\n      node's
      bindings upon accepting this specific request.  The (B)\n      flag MUST NOT
      be set to a value of (1) if the value of the\n      Registration Overwrite (O)
      flag is set to a value of (1).\n   Registration Overwrite (O)\n      This flag,
      if set to a value of (1), notifies the LMA that upon\n      accepting this request,
      it should replace all of the mobile node's\n      existing bindings with this
      binding.  This flag MUST NOT be set to\n      a value of (1) if the value of
      the Bulk Re-registration Flag (B)\n      is set to a value of (1).  This flag
      MUST be set to a value of (0)\n      in De-Registration requests.\n   Reserved\n

      MUST include the MAG\n      Multipath Binding option (Section 4.1) in each of
      the PBU messages\n      that it sends through the different WAN interfaces.
      \ The inclusion\n      of this option serves as a hint that the MAG is requesting\n
      \     multipath support.  Furthermore, the MAG Identifier option MUST\n      also
      be present in the PBU message.\n   o  If the MAG is aware that the LMA supports
      the multipath binding\n      option defined in this specification and if it
      chooses to use\n      multiple paths, then it can send the PBU packets for each
      of the\n      paths, either sequentially or concurrently.  However, if the MAG\n
      \     is not aware of the LMA capability, then it SHOULD first discover\n      the
      LMA capability by sending PBU packets with multipath on only\n      one path
      first.  This will ensure that the LMA will not be\n      overwriting the binding
      of one path with the other path.\n   o  If the LMA supports multipath capability
      as defined in this\n      specification and if it enables the same for a mobile
      node's\n      session per the MAG's request, then the LMA MUST include the\n
      \     Multipath Binding option (Section 4.1) without the MAG-NAI option\n      (Section
      4.2) in the corresponding PBA reply.\n   o  If the LMA is a legacy LMA that
      does not support this\n      specification, the LMA will skip the MAG Multipath
      Binding option\n      (and MAG-NAI option) and process the rest of the message
      as\n      specified in the base PMIPv6 specification ([RFC5213]).\n      Furthermore,
      the LMA will not include the MAG Multipath Binding\n      option (or the MAG-NAI
      option) in the PBA message.  The MAG, upon\n      receiving the PBA message
      without the MAG Multipath Binding\n      option, SHOULD disable multipath support
      for the mobile node.\n   o  If the mobile node is not authorized for multipath
      support, then\n      the LMA will reject the request by sending a PBA message
      with the\n      Status field value set to CANNOT_SUPPORT_MULTIPATH_BINDING\n
      \     (Section 4.3).  The LMA MUST echo the MAG Multipath Binding option\n      (without
      the MAG-NAI option) in the PBA message.  The MAG, upon\n      receiving this

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This specification allows a MAG to establish
    multiple PMIPv6 tunnels\n   with an LMA by registering a care-of address for each
    of its\n   connected access networks.  This essentially allows the mobile node's\n
    \  IP traffic to be routed through any of the tunnel paths based on the\n   negotiated
    flow policy.  This new capability has no impact on the\n   protocol security.
    \ Furthermore, this specification defines two new\n   mobility header options:
    the MAG Multipath Binding option and the MAG\n   Identifier option.  These options
    are carried like any other mobility\n   header option as specified in [RFC5213].
    \ Therefore, it inherits\n   security guidelines from [RFC5213].  Thus, this specification
    does\n   not weaken the security of the PMIPv6 Protocol and does not introduce\n
    \  any new security vulnerabilities.\n"
