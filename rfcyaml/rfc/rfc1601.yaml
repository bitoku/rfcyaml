  contents:
  - "1.  IAB Membership\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) shall consist of\
    \ 13 voting\n   members, composed of the IETF chair and 12 full members.  The\
    \ IETF\n   chair, who is also the chair of the IESG, may vote on all official\n\
    \   IAB actions except the approval of IESG members.  Ex-officio members\n   and\
    \ a liaison from the IESG may also attend IAB meetings but shall\n   have no vote\
    \ on official actions.\n   Voting IAB members shall serve for a term of two years,\
    \ but may serve\n   any number of terms.\n   Members of the IAB shall serve as\
    \ individuals, and not as\n   representatives of any company, agency, or other\
    \ organization.\n   1.1  Selection of voting IAB members\n      Voting IAB members\
    \ shall be nominated by the nominating committee\n      of the IETF and appointed\
    \ by an appropriate group.  The 12 full\n      members shall be approved by vote\
    \ of the Board of Trustees of the\n      Internet Society (ISOC), while the IETF\
    \ chair shall be approved by\n      vote of the 12 full IAB members then sitting.\
    \  Normally, six new\n      full members are nominated each year.\n      The IETF\
    \ nomination committee is formed every year and consists of\n      a non-voting\
    \ chair designated by the Internet Society and seven\n      members picked at\
    \ random from a pool of volunteers.  Any person\n      who took part in two IETF\
    \ meetings in the last two years may\n      volunteer for this pool.  The nomination\
    \ committee also includes\n      four non-voting liaison members, one designated\
    \ by each of the\n      Board of Trustees of the Internet Society, the IAB, the\
    \ IESG, and\n      the IRSG.\n      New IAB members shall be selected each year\
    \ to replace those whose\n      terms have expired or been vacated.  The nomination\
    \ committee\n      shall prepare a list containing at least one candidate for\
    \ each\n      open position, and present this list to the ISOC Board of\n    \
    \  Trustees.  The Board of Trustees will by a vote appoint IAB\n      members\
    \ from the list of nominees to fill the open positions.\n      There is no limit\
    \ to the number of terms that a member of the IAB\n      may serve.  A member\
    \ that wishes to be re-nominated at the end of\n      a term simply notifies the\
    \ nomination committee.  However, there\n      is no obligation for renomination.\n\
    \   1.2 Ex-Officio Members\n      The IRSG chair and the RFC Editor shall be Ex-officio\
    \ members of\n      the IAB, with no vote in official actions.  An ex-officio\
    \ position\n      may be held by a voting member.\n"
- title: '2.  The Role of the IAB:'
  contents:
  - "2.  The Role of the IAB:\n   The IAB was chartered as a component of the Internet\
    \ Society in June\n   of 1992.  Its responsibilities under this charter include:\n\
    \   (a) IESG Selection\n      The IAB appoints a new IETF chair and all other\
    \ IESG candidates,\n      from a list provided by the IETF nominating committee.\n\
    \   (b) Architectural Oversight\n      The IAB provides oversight of the architecture\
    \ for the protocols\n      and procedures used by the Internet.\n   (c) Standards\
    \ Process Oversight and Appeal\n      The IAB provides oversight of the process\
    \ used to create Internet\n      Standards.\n      The IAB serves as an appeal\
    \ board for complaints of improper\n      execution of the standards process.\n\
    \   (d) RFC Series and IANA\n      The IAB is responsible for editorial management\
    \ and publication of\n      the Request for Comments (RFC) document series, and\
    \ for\n      administration of the various Internet assigned numbers.\n   (e)\
    \ External Liaison\n      The IAB acts as representative of the interests of the\
    \ Internet\n      Society in liaison relationships with other organizations\n\
    \      concerned with standards and other technical and organizational\n     \
    \ issues relevant to the world-wide Internet.\n   (f) Advice to ISOC\n      The\
    \ IAB acts as a source of advice and guidance to the Board of\n      Trustees\
    \ and Officers of the Internet Society concerning\n      technical, architectural,\
    \ procedural, and (where appropriate)\n      policy matters pertaining to the\
    \ Internet and its enabling\n      technologies.\n   The following is an expanded\
    \ discussion of these IAB functions.\n   2.1 IESG Selection\n      Members of\
    \ the IESG are nominated for a period of two years by the\n      IETF nomination\
    \ committee, and are appointed by approval from the\n      IAB.  The committee\
    \ shall select at least one nominee for each\n      vacant IESG position, i.e.,\
    \ chair of the IESG or chair of a\n      specific area.  The nomination committee\
    \ may present several\n      candidates for an available position, in which case\
    \ the IAB will\n      select one of the nominees for that position.\n      The\
    \ nominating committee shall present the IESG nomination list to\n      the IAB\
    \ for approval.  Within two weeks of receiving the list, the\n      IAB shall\
    \ approve or disapprove of the nominations, by voting\n      among the full members\
    \ of the IAB.  At least 8 affirmative votes,\n      and no more than one negative\
    \ vote, are required to approve an\n      IESG appointment.\n      Should the\
    \ IAB fail to approve a particular nomination, the\n      nomination committee\
    \ shall present a new nomination for that\n      position.  Should this process\
    \ fail to converge rapidly, the\n      sitting IESG is permitted to make a temporary\
    \ appointment to one\n      of their own positions whenever there is no IAB-selected\
    \ person\n      with an unexpired term filling that slot.\n   2.2 Architectural\
    \ oversight\n      A major role of the IAB is long range planning.  The IAB is\n\
    \      expected to \"pay attention\" to important long-term issues in the\n  \
    \    Internet, and to make sure that these issues are brought to the\n      attention\
    \ of the group(s) that are in a position to address them.\n      It is also expected\
    \ to play a role in assuring that the people\n      responsible for evolving the\
    \ Internet and its technology are aware\n      of the essential elements of the\
    \ Internet architecture.\n      When a new IETF working group is proposed, the\
    \ IESG will forward a\n      preliminary version of the charter to the IAB for\
    \ review of\n      architectural consistency and integrity.  The IAB shall review\n\
    \      these proposed charters and give feedback to the IESG as\n      appropriate.\n\
    \      Pursuant to the architectural oversight function, the IAB sponsors\n  \
    \    and organizes the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).\n      On occasion,\
    \ the IAB will convene panels to perform in-depth\n      reviews of particular\
    \ architectural issue.  Such reviews may\n      include consideration of relevant\
    \ IETF Working Group activities,\n      and for this purpose the panel may invite\
    \ presentations by\n      qualified parties on the design goals and decisions,\
    \ technology\n      choices, and other pertinent aspects of these IETF activities.\n\
    \      The results of such a review will be a report which may give\n      advice\
    \ to the community and the IESG.\n      The IAB may organize ad hoc bodies of\
    \ independent technical\n      experts to adjudicate technical disputes.\n   2.3\
    \ Standards Process Oversight and Appeal\n      The development, review, and approval\
    \ of Internet Standards is the\n      responsibility of the Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG)\n      of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).\
    \  The standards\n      process executed by the IESG is established and documented\
    \ by the\n      IAB, in consultation with the IESG and with the concurrence of\
    \ the\n      IETF.\n   2.4 RFC Series and Assigned Numbers\n      The RFC series\
    \ constitutes the archival publication channel for\n      Internet Standards and\
    \ for other contributions by the Internet\n      research and engineering community.\
    \  The IAB shall select an RFC\n      Editor, who shall be responsible for the\
    \ editorial management and\n      publication of the RFC series.\n      The IAB\
    \ shall also designate an Internet Assigned Numbers\n      Authority (IANA) to\
    \ administer the assignment of Internet protocol\n      numbers.\n   2.5 External\
    \ Liaison\n      The IAB is responsible for relationships between the Internet\n\
    \      technical groups working under the auspices of ISOC and other\n      interested\
    \ parties such as the US Federal Networking Council\n      (FNC); various organs\
    \ of the European Commission (EC); the\n      Coordinating Committee for Intercontinental\
    \ Research Networking\n      (CCIRN); standards bodies such as the International\
    \ Organization\n      for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical\n\
    \      Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunication Union\n     \
    \ (ITU); and other professional societies such as the Institute of\n      Electrical\
    \ and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for\n      Computing Machinery\
    \ (ACM).\n   2.6 Advice to ISOC\n      The IAB may convene panels of knowledgeable\
    \ people, hold hearings,\n      and otherwise pursue the investigation of specific\
    \ questions or\n      topics presented to it by the Internet Society.\n"
