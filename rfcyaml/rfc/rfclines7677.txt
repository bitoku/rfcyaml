Abstract This document registers the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms SCRAM SHA 256 and SCRAM SHA 256 PLUS, provides guidance for secure implementation of the original SCRAM SHA 1 PLUS mechanism, and updates the SCRAM registration procedures of RFC 5802.
This document registers the SASL mechanisms SCRAM SHA 256 and SCRAM  SHA 256 PLUS.
SHA 256 has stronger security properties than SHA 1, and it is expected that SCRAM mechanisms based on it will have greater predicted longevity than the SCRAM mechanisms based on SHA 1.
The registration form for the SCRAM family of algorithms is also updated from [RFC5802].
After publication of [RFC5802], it was discovered that Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] does not have the expected properties for the "tls unique" channel binding to be secure
Therefore, this document contains normative text that applies to both the original SCRAM SHA 1 PLUS and the newly introduced SCRAM SHA  256 PLUS mechanism.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
SCRAM SHA 256 and SCRAM SHA 256
The SCRAM SHA 256 and SCRAM SHA 256 PLUS SASL mechanisms are defined in the same way that SCRAM SHA 1 and SCRAM SHA 1 PLUS are defined in [RFC5802], except that the hash function for HMAC() and H() uses SHA 256 instead of SHA 1 [RFC6234].
For the SCRAM SHA 256 and SCRAM SHA 256 PLUS SASL mechanisms, the hash iteration count announced by a server SHOULD be at least 4096.
The GSS API mechanism OID for SCRAM SHA 256 is 1.3.6.1.5.5.18 (see Section 5).
This is a simple example of a SCRAM SHA 256 authentication exchange when the client doesn't support channel bindings.
The username 'user' and password 'pencil' are being used.

The security considerations from [RFC5802] still apply.
To be secure, either SCRAM SHA 256 PLUS and SCRAM SHA
1 PLUS MUST be used over a TLS channel that has had the session hash extension [RFC7627] negotiated, or session resumption MUST NOT have been used.
See [RFC4270] and [RFC6194] for reasons to move from SHA 1 to a strong security mechanism like SHA 256.
The strength of this mechanism is dependent in part on the hash iteration count, as denoted by "i" in [RFC5802].
As a rule of thumb, the hash iteration count should be such that a modern machine will take 0.1 seconds to perform the complete algorithm; however, this is unlikely to be practical on mobile devices and other relatively low  performance systems.
At the time this was written, the rule of thumb gives around 15,000 iterations required; however, a hash iteration  count of 4096 takes around 0.5 seconds on current mobile handsets.
This computational cost can be avoided by caching the ClientKey (assuming the Salt and hash iteration count is stable).
Therefore, the recommendation of this specification is that the hash iteration  count SHOULD be at least 4096, but careful consideration ought to be given to using a significantly higher value, particularly where mobile use is less important.
The IANA registry for SCRAM
(the SCRAM family of SASL mechanisms) in the SASL mechanism registry ([RFC4422]) has been updated as follows.
The email address for reviews has been updated, and the note at the end changed.
Registration of a new SASL family SCRAM SASL mechanism name (or prefix for the family):
SCRAM   Security considerations: Section 7 of [RFC5802] Published specification (optional, recommended): RFC 7677 Person & email address to contact for further information: IETF KITTEN WG
COMMON Owner/Change controller: IESG <iesg@ietf.org
Members of this family MUST be explicitly registered using the "IETF Review" [RFC5226] registration procedure.
Reviews MUST be requested on the KITTEN mailing list kitten@ietf.org (or a successor designated by the responsible Security AD).
Note to future SCRAM mechanism designers: each new SASL SCRAM mechanism MUST be explicitly registered with IANA within the SASL SCRAM Family Mechanisms registry.
SASL SCRAM Family Mechanisms Registration Procedure
A new IANA registry has been added for members of the SCRAM family of SASL mechanisms, named "SASL SCRAM Family Mechanisms".
It adds two new fields to the existing SCRAM mechanism registry: Minimum iteration count and Associated OID.
Below is the template for registration of a new SASL family SCRAM.
(Note that the string "TBD BY IANA" should be left as is, so that it may be filled in at registration time by IANA.)
Registration of a new SASL SCRAM family mechanism SASL mechanism name (or prefix for the family):
SCRAM <NAME> Security considerations: Section 7 of [RFC5802] Published specification (optional, recommended): RFC 7677 Minimum iteration count:
The minimum hash iteration count that servers SHOULD announce Associated OID: TBD BY IANA Person & email address to contact for further information:
COMMON Owner/Change controller: IESG <iesg@ietf.org
Members of this family MUST be explicitly registered using the "IETF Review" [RFC5226] registration procedure.
Reviews MUST be requested on the KITTEN mailing list kitten@ietf.org (or a successor designated by the responsible Security Area Director).
At publication of a new SASL SCRAM Family Mechanism, IANA SHOULD assign a GSS API mechanism OID for this mechanism from the iso.org.dod.internet.security.mechanisms prefix (see the "SMI Security for Mechanism Codes" registry) and fill in the value for "TBD BY IANA" above.
Only one OID needs to be assigned for a SCRAM <NAME> and SCRAM <NAME> PLUS pair.
The same OID should be assigned to both entries in the registry.
Note to future SASL SCRAM mechanism designers: each new SASL SCRAM mechanism MUST be explicitly registered with IANA and MUST comply with the SCRAM mechanism
naming convention defined in Section 4 of [RFC5802].
The existing entries for SASL SCRAM SHA 1 and SCRAM SHA 1
PLUS have been moved from the existing SASL mechanism registry to the "SASL SCRAM Family Mechanisms" registry.
At that time, the following values were added: Minimum iteration count: 4096 OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.14 (from [RFC5802])
The following new SASL SCRAM mechanisms have been added to the "SASL SCRAM Family Mechanisms" registry:
Registration of a new SASL SCRAM Family mechanism SCRAM SHA 256 SASL mechanism name (or prefix for the family):
SCRAM SHA 256 Security considerations: Section 4 of RFC 7677 Published specification (optional, recommended):
RFC 7677 Minimum iteration count: 4096 OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.18 Person & email address to contact for further information:

Registration of a new SASL SCRAM Family mechanism SCRAM SHA 256 PLUS SASL mechanism name (or prefix for the family):
SCRAM SHA 256 PLUS Security considerations:
Section 4 of RFC 7677 Published specification (optional, recommended):
