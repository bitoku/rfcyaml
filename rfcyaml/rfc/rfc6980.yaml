  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is specified in RFC
    4861\n   [RFC4861].  It is used by both hosts and routers.  Its functions\n   include
    Neighbor Discovery (ND), Router Discovery (RD), address\n   autoconfiguration,
    address resolution, Neighbor Unreachability\n   Detection (NUD), Duplicate Address
    Detection (DAD), and redirection.\n   Many of the possible attacks against the
    Neighbor Discovery Protocol\n   are discussed in detail in [RFC3756].  In order
    to mitigate the\n   aforementioned possible attacks, SEcure Neighbor Discovery
    (SEND) was\n   standardized.  SEND employs a number of mechanisms to certify the\n
    \  origin of Neighbor Discovery packets and the authority of routers,\n   and
    to protect Neighbor Discovery packets from being the subject of\n   modification
    or replay attacks.\n   However, a number of factors, such as the high administrative\n
    \  overhead of deploying trust anchors and the unavailability of SEND\n   implementations
    for many widely deployed operating systems, make SEND\n   hard to deploy [Gont-DPSC].
    \ Thus, in many general scenarios, it may\n   be necessary and/or convenient to
    use other mitigation techniques for\n   NDP-based attacks.  The following mitigations
    are currently available\n   for NDP attacks:\n   o  Static Access Control Lists
    (ACLs) in switches\n   o  Layer-2 filtering of Neighbor Discovery packets (such
    as RA-Guard\n      [RFC6105])\n   o  Neighbor Discovery monitoring tools (e.g.,
    NDPMon [NDPMon] and\n      ramond [ramond])\n   o  Intrusion Prevention Systems
    (IPS)\n   IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) is a mitigation technique\n
    \  for attack vectors based on ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)\n   messages.
    \ It is meant to block attack packets at a layer-2 device\n   before the attack
    packets actually reach the target nodes.  [RFC6104]\n   describes the problem
    statement of \"Rogue IPv6 Router\n   Advertisements\", and [RFC6105] specifies
    the \"IPv6 Router\n   Advertisement Guard\" functionality.\n   Tools such as NDPMon
    [NDPMon] and ramond [ramond] aim to monitor\n   Neighbor Discovery traffic in
    the hopes of detecting possible attacks\n   when there are discrepancies between
    the information advertised in\n   Neighbor Discovery packets and the information
    stored on a local\n   database.\n   Some Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can
    mitigate Neighbor\n   Discovery attacks.  We recommend that Intrusion Prevention
    Systems\n   implement mitigations for NDP attacks.\n   IPv6 fragmentation introduces
    a key challenge for these mitigation or\n   monitoring techniques, since it is
    trivial for an attacker to conceal\n   his attack by fragmenting his packets into
    multiple fragments.  This\n   may limit or even eliminate the effectiveness of
    the aforementioned\n   mitigation or monitoring techniques.  Recent work [CPNI-IPv6]\n
    \  indicates that current implementations of the aforementioned\n   mitigations
    for NDP attacks can be trivially evaded.  For example, as\n   noted in [RA-GUARD],
    current RA-Guard implementations can be\n   trivially evaded by fragmenting the
    attack packets into multiple\n   fragments, such that the layer-2 device cannot
    find all the necessary\n   information to perform packet filtering in the same
    packet.  While\n   Neighbor Discovery monitoring tools could (in theory) implement
    IPv6\n   fragment reassembly, this is usually an arms-race with the attacker\n
    \  (an attacker can generate lots of forged fragments to \"confuse\" the\n   monitoring
    tools), and therefore the aforementioned tools are\n   unreliable for the detection
    of such attacks.\n   Section 2 analyzes the use of IPv6 fragmentation in traditional\n
    \  Neighbor Discovery.  Section 3 analyzes the use of IPv6 fragmentation\n   in
    SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND).  Section 4 provides the\n   rationale for forbidding
    the use of IPv6 fragmentation with Neighbor\n   Discovery.  Section 5 formally
    updates RFC 4861 such that the use of\n   the IPv6 Fragment Header with traditional
    Neighbor Discovery is\n   forbidden, and also formally updates RFC 3971 by providing
    advice on\n   the use of IPv6 fragmentation with SEND.  Section 6 provides\n   operational
    advice about interoperability problems arising from the\n   use of IPv6 fragmentation
    with Neighbor Discovery.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
    2119 [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Traditional Neighbor Discovery and IPv6 Fragmentation\n   The only potential
    use case for IPv6 fragmentation with traditional\n   (i.e., non-SEND) IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery would be that in which a\n   Router Advertisement must include a large
    number of options (Prefix\n   Information Options, Route Information Options,
    etc.).  However, this\n   could still be achieved without employing fragmentation,
    by splitting\n   the aforementioned information into multiple Router Advertisement\n
    \  messages.\n      Some Neighbor Discovery implementations are known to silently\n
    \     ignore Router Advertisement messages that employ fragmentation.\n      Therefore,
    splitting the necessary information into multiple RA\n      messages (rather than
    sending a large RA message that is\n      fragmented into multiple IPv6 fragments)
    is probably desirable\n      even from an interoperability point of view.\n   Thus,
    avoiding the use of IPv6 fragmentation in traditional Neighbor\n   Discovery would
    greatly simplify and improve the effectiveness of\n   monitoring and filtering
    Neighbor Discovery traffic and would also\n   prevent interoperability problems
    with those implementations that do\n   not support fragmentation in Neighbor Discovery
    messages.\n"
  title: 2.  Traditional Neighbor Discovery and IPv6 Fragmentation
- contents:
  - "3.  SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) and IPv6 Fragmentation\n   SEND packets
    typically carry more information than traditional\n   Neighbor Discovery packets:
    for example, they include additional\n   options such as the Cryptographically
    Generated Address (CGA) option\n   and the RSA signature option.\n   When SEND
    nodes employ any of the Neighbor Discovery messages\n   specified in [RFC4861],
    the situation is roughly the same: if more\n   information than would fit in a
    non-fragmented Neighbor Discovery\n   packet needs to be sent, it should be split
    into multiple Neighbor\n   Discovery messages (such that IPv6 fragmentation is
    avoided).\n   However, Certification Path Advertisement (CPA) messages (specified\n
    \  in [RFC3971]) pose a different situation, since the Certificate\n   Option
    they include typically contains much more information than any\n   other Neighbor
    Discovery option.  For example, Appendix C of\n   [RFC3971] reports Certification
    Path Advertisement messages from 1050\n   to 1066 bytes on an Ethernet link layer.
    \ Since the size of CPA\n   messages could potentially exceed the MTU of the local
    link,\n   Section 5 recommends that fragmented CPA messages be processed\n   normally,
    but discourages the use of keys that would result in\n   fragmented CPA messages.\n
    \  It should be noted that relying on fragmentation opens the door to a\n   variety
    of IPv6 fragmentation-based attacks against SEND.  In\n   particular, if an attacker
    is located on the same broadcast domain as\n   the victim host and Certification
    Path Advertisement messages employ\n   IPv6 fragmentation, it would be trivial
    for the attacker to forge\n   IPv6 fragments such that they result in \"Fragment
    ID collisions\",\n   causing both the attack fragments and the legitimate fragments
    to be\n   discarded by the victim node.  This would eventually cause\n   Authorization
    Delegation Discovery (Section 6 of [RFC3971]) to fail,\n   thus leading the host
    to (depending on local configuration) either\n   fall back to unsecured mode or
    reject the corresponding Router\n   Advertisement messages (possibly resulting
    in a denial of service).\n"
  title: 3.  SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) and IPv6 Fragmentation
- contents:
  - "4.  Rationale for Forbidding IPv6 Fragmentation in Neighbor Discovery\n   A number
    of considerations should be made regarding the use of IPv6\n   fragmentation with
    Neighbor Discovery:\n   o  A significant number of existing implementations already
    silently\n      drop fragmented ND messages, so the use of IPv6 fragmentation
    may\n      hamper interoperability among IPv6 implementations.\n   o  Although
    it is possible to build an ND message that needs to be\n      fragmented, such
    packets are unlikely to exist in the real world\n      because of the large number
    of options that would be required for\n      the resulting packet to exceed the
    minimum IPv6 MTU of\n      1280 octets.\n   o  If an ND message was so large as
    to need fragmentation, there is\n      an option to distribute the same information
    amongst more than one\n      message, each of which is small enough to not need
    fragmentation.\n   Thus, forbidding the use of IPv6 fragmentation with Neighbor\n
    \  Discovery normalizes existing behavior and sets the expectations of\n   all
    implementations to the existing lowest common denominator.\n"
  title: 4.  Rationale for Forbidding IPv6 Fragmentation in Neighbor Discovery
- contents:
  - "5.  Specification\n   Nodes MUST NOT employ IPv6 fragmentation for sending any
    of the\n   following Neighbor Discovery and SEcure Neighbor Discovery messages:\n
    \  o  Neighbor Solicitation\n   o  Neighbor Advertisement\n   o  Router Solicitation\n
    \  o  Router Advertisement\n   o  Redirect\n   o  Certification Path Solicitation\n
    \  Nodes SHOULD NOT employ IPv6 fragmentation for sending the following\n   messages
    (see Section 6.4.2 of [RFC3971]):\n   o  Certification Path Advertisement\n   Nodes
    MUST silently ignore the following Neighbor Discovery and\n   SEcure Neighbor
    Discovery messages if the packets carrying them\n   include an IPv6 Fragmentation
    Header:\n   o  Neighbor Solicitation\n   o  Neighbor Advertisement\n   o  Router
    Solicitation\n   o  Router Advertisement\n   o  Redirect\n   o  Certification
    Path Solicitation\n   Nodes SHOULD normally process the following messages when
    the packets\n   carrying them include an IPv6 Fragmentation Header:\n   o  Certification
    Path Advertisement\n   SEND nodes SHOULD NOT employ keys that would result in
    fragmented CPA\n   messages.\n"
  title: 5.  Specification
- contents:
  - "6.  Operational Advice\n   An operator detecting that Neighbor Discovery traffic
    is being\n   silently dropped should find whether the corresponding Neighbor\n
    \  Discovery messages are employing IPv6 fragmentation.  If they are, it\n   is
    likely that the devices receiving such packets are silently\n   dropping them
    merely because they employ IPv6 fragmentation.  In such\n   a case, an operator
    should check whether the sending device has an\n   option to prevent fragmentation
    of ND messages, and/or see whether it\n   is possible to reduce the options carried
    on such messages.  We note\n   that solving this (unlikely) problem might require
    a software upgrade\n   to a version that does not employ IPv6 fragmentation with
    Neighbor\n   Discovery.\n"
  title: 6.  Operational Advice
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The IPv6 Fragmentation Header can be leveraged
    to circumvent network\n   monitoring tools and current implementations of mechanisms
    such as\n   RA-Guard [RA-GUARD].  By updating the relevant specifications such\n
    \  that the IPv6 Fragment Header is not allowed in any Neighbor\n   Discovery
    messages except Certification Path Advertisement messages,\n   protection of local
    nodes against Neighbor Discovery attacks, as well\n   as the monitoring of Neighbor
    Discovery traffic, are greatly\n   simplified.\n   As noted in Section 3, the
    use of SEND could potentially result in\n   fragmented Certification Path Advertisement
    messages, thus allowing\n   an attacker to employ IPv6 fragmentation-based attacks
    against such\n   messages.  Therefore, to the extent that is possible, such use
    of\n   fragmentation should be avoided.\n"
