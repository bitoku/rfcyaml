- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The OpenPGP protocol [RFC4880] can support many different\
    \ symmetric\n   ciphers.  This document presents the necessary information to\
    \ use the\n   Camellia [RFC3713] symmetric cipher in the OpenPGP protocol.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Camellia
  contents:
  - "3.  Camellia\n   Camellia is specified in [RFC3713].  It is a 128-bit symmetric\
    \ block\n   cipher (as are AES and Twofish in OpenPGP) that supports 128-bit,\n\
    \   192-bit, and 256-bit keys.  This document defines the use of Camellia\n  \
    \ in OpenPGP.\n     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+\n\
    \     | Camellia Key Length | OpenPGP Symmetric-Key Algorithm Number |\n     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+\n\
    \     |         128         |                   11                   |\n     |\
    \         192         |                   12                   |\n     |     \
    \    256         |                   13                   |\n     +---------------------+----------------------------------------+\n\
    \   OpenPGP applications MAY implement Camellia.  If implemented,\n   Camellia\
    \ may be used in any place in OpenPGP where a symmetric cipher\n   is usable,\
    \ and it is subject to the same usage requirements (such as\n   its presence in\
    \ the Preferred Symmetric Algorithms signature\n   subpacket) as the other symmetric\
    \ ciphers in OpenPGP.\n   While the OpenPGP algorithm preferences system prevents\n\
    \   interoperability problems with public key encrypted messages, if\n   Camellia\
    \ (or any other optional cipher) is used for encrypting\n   private keys, there\
    \ could be interoperability problems when migrating\n   a private key from one\
    \ system to another.  A similar issue can arise\n   when using an optional cipher\
    \ for symmetrically encrypted messages,\n   as this OpenPGP message type does\
    \ not use the algorithm preferences\n   system.  Those using optional ciphers\
    \ in this manner should take care\n   they are using a cipher that their intended\
    \ recipient can decrypt.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   At publication time, there are no known weak\
    \ keys for Camellia, and\n   the Camellia algorithm is believed to be strong.\
    \  However, as with\n   any technology involving cryptography, implementers should\
    \ check the\n   current literature, as well as the Camellia home page at\n   http://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/camellia/\
    \ to determine if Camellia has been\n   found to be vulnerable to attack.\n"

    \ of OpenPGP\n   Symmetric-Key Algorithms that was created by [RFC4880].\n"
