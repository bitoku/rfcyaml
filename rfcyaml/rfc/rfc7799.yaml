- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The adjectives \"Active\" and \"Passive\" have been used\
    \ for many years\n   to distinguish between two different classes of Internet\
    \ performance\n   assessment.  The first Passive and Active Measurement (PAM)\n\
    \   Conference was held in 2000, but the earliest proceedings available\n   online\
    \ are from the second PAM conference in 2001\n   <https://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings/pam-2001>.\n\
    \   The notions of \"Active\" and \"Passive\" are well-established.  In\n   general:\n\
    \   o  An Active Metric or Method depends on a dedicated measurement\n      packet\
    \ stream and observations of the stream.\n   o  A Passive Metric or Method depends\
    \ *solely* on observation of one\n      or more existing packet streams.  The\
    \ streams only serve\n      measurement when they are observed for that purpose,\
    \ and are\n      present whether or not measurements take place.\n   As new techniques\
    \ for assessment emerge, it is helpful to have clear\n   definitions of these\
    \ notions.  This memo provides more-detailed\n   definitions, defines a new category\
    \ for combinations of traditional\n   Active and Passive techniques, and discusses\
    \ dimensions to evaluate\n   new techniques as they emerge.\n   This memo provides\
    \ definitions for Active and Passive Metrics and\n   Methods based on long usage\
    \ in the Internet measurement community,\n   and especially the Internet Engineering\
    \ Task Force (IETF).  This memo\n   also describes the combination of fundamental\
    \ Active and Passive\n   categories that are called Hybrid Methods and Metrics.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Purpose and Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Purpose and Scope\n   The scope of this memo is to define and describe Active\
    \ and Passive\n   versions of metrics and methods that are consistent with the\
    \ long-\n   time usage of these adjectives in the Internet measurement community\n\
    \   and especially the IETF.  Since the science of measurement is\n   expanding,\
    \ we provide a category for combinations of the traditional\n   extremes, treating\
    \ Active and Passive as a continuum and designating\n   combinations of their\
    \ attributes as Hybrid Methods.\n   Further, this memo's purpose includes describing\
    \ multiple dimensions\n   to evaluate new methods as they emerge.\n"
- title: 3.  Terms and Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.  Terms and Definitions\n   This section defines the key terms of the memo.\
    \  Some definitions use\n   the notion of \"stream of interest\", which is synonymous\
    \ with\n   \"population of interest\" defined in clause 6.1.1 of ITU-T\n   Recommendation\
    \ Y.1540 [Y.1540].  These definitions will be useful for\n   any work in progress,\
    \ such as [PASSIVE] (with which there is already\n   good consistency).\n"
- title: 3.1.  Performance Metric
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Performance Metric\n   The standard definition of a quantity, produced\
    \ in an assessment of\n   performance and/or reliability of the network, which\
    \ has an intended\n   utility and is carefully specified to convey the exact meaning\
    \ of a\n   measured value.  (This definition is consistent with that of\n   Performance\
    \ Metric in [RFC2330] and [RFC6390]).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Method of Measurement
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Method of Measurement\n   The procedure or set of operations having the\
    \ object of determining a\n   Measured Value or Measurement Result.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Observation Point
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Observation Point\n   See Section 2 of [RFC7011] for the definition of\
    \ Observation Point (a\n   location in the network where packets can be observed),\
    \ and related\n   definitions.  The comparable term defined in IETF literature\
    \ on\n   Active measurement is \"Measurement Point\" (see Section 4.1 of\n   [RFC5835]).\
    \  Both of these terms have come into use describing\n   similar actions at the\
    \ identified point in the network path.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Active Methods
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Active Methods\n   Active Methods of Measurement have the following attributes:\n\
    \   o  Active Methods generate packet streams.  Commonly, the packet\n      stream\
    \ of interest is generated as the basis of measurement.\n      Sometimes, the\
    \ adjective \"synthetic\" is used to categorize Active\n      measurement streams\
    \ [Y.1731].  An accompanying packet stream or\n      streams may be generated\
    \ to increase overall traffic load, though\n      the loading stream(s) may not\
    \ be measured.\n   o  The packets in the stream of interest have fields or field\
    \ values\n      (or are augmented or modified to include fields or field values)\n\
    \      that are dedicated to measurement.  Since measurement usually\n      requires\
    \ determining the corresponding packets at multiple\n      measurement points,\
    \ a sequence number is the most common\n      information dedicated to measurement,\
    \ and it is often combined\n      with a timestamp.\n   o  The Source and Destination\
    \ of the packet stream of interest are\n      usually known a priori.\n   o  The\
    \ characteristics of the packet stream of interest are known at\n      the Source\
    \ (at least), and may be communicated to the Destination\n      as part of the\
    \ method.  Note that some packet characteristics will\n      normally change during\
    \ packet forwarding.  Other changes along the\n      path are possible, see [STDFORM].\n\
    \   When adding traffic to the network for measurement, Active Methods\n   influence\
    \ the quantities measured to some degree, and those\n   performing tests should\
    \ take steps to quantify the effect(s) and/or\n   minimize such effects.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Active Metric
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Active Metric\n   An Active Metric incorporates one or more of the aspects\
    \ of Active\n   Methods in the metric definition.\n   For example, IETF metrics\
    \ for IP performance (developed according to\n   the framework described in [RFC2330])\
    \ include the Source-packet\n   stream characteristics as metric-input parameters,\
    \ and also specify\n   the packet characteristics (Type-P) and Source and Destination\
    \ IP\n   addresses (with their implications on both stream treatment and\n   interfaces\
    \ associated with measurement points).\n"
- title: 3.6.  Passive Methods
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Passive Methods\n   Passive Methods of Measurement are:\n   o  based solely\
    \ on observations of an undisturbed and unmodified\n      packet stream of interest\
    \ (in other words, the method of\n      measurement MUST NOT add, change, or remove\
    \ packets or fields or\n      change field values anywhere along the path).\n\
    \   o  dependent on the existence of one or more packet streams to supply\n  \
    \    the stream of interest.\n   o  dependent on the presence of the packet stream\
    \ of interest at one\n      or more designated Observation Points.\n   Some Passive\
    \ Methods simply observe and collect information on all\n   packets that pass\
    \ Observation Point(s), while others filter the\n   packets as a first step and\
    \ only collect information on packets that\n   match the filter criteria, and\
    \ thereby narrow the stream of interest.\n   It is common that Passive Methods\
    \ are conducted at one or more\n   Observation Points.  Passive Methods to assess\
    \ Performance Metrics\n   often require multiple Observation Points, e.g., to\
    \ assess the\n   latency of packet transfer across a network path between two\n\
    \   Observation Points.  In this case, the observed packets must include\n   enough\
    \ information to determine the corresponding packets at\n   different Observation\
    \ Points.\n   Communication of the observations (in some form) to a collector\
    \ is an\n   essential aspect of Passive Methods.  In some configurations, the\n\
    \   traffic load generated when communicating (or exporting) the Passive\n   Method\
    \ results to a collector may itself influence the measured\n   network's performance.\
    \  However, the collection of results is not\n   unique to Passive Methods, and\
    \ the load from management and\n   operations of measurement systems must always\
    \ be considered for\n   potential effects on the measured values.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Passive Metric
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Passive Metric\n   Passive Metrics apply to observations of packet traffic\
    \ (traffic\n   flows in [RFC7011]).\n   Passive performance metrics are assessed\
    \ independently of the packets\n   or traffic flows, and solely through observation.\
    \  Some refer to such\n   assessments as \"out of band\".\n   One example of Passive\
    \ Performance Metrics for IP packet transfer can\n   be found in ITU-T Recommendation\
    \ Y.1540 [Y.1540], where the metrics\n   are defined on the basis of reference\
    \ events generated as packets\n   pass reference points.  The metrics are agnostic\
    \ to the distinction\n   between Active and Passive when the necessary packet\
    \ correspondence\n   can be derived from the observed stream of interest as required.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Hybrid Methods and Metrics
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Hybrid Methods and Metrics\n   Hybrid Methods are Methods of Measurement\
    \ that use a combination of\n   Active Methods and Passive Methods, to assess\
    \ Active Metrics, Passive\n   Metrics, or new metrics derived from the a priori\
    \ knowledge and\n   observations of the stream of interest.  ITU-T Recommendation\
    \ Y.1540\n   [Y.1540] defines metrics that are also applicable to the hybrid\n\
    \   categories, since packet correspondence at different observation/\n   reference\
    \ points could be derived from \"fields or field values which\n   are dedicated\
    \ to measurement\", but otherwise the methods are Passive.\n   There are several\
    \ types of Hybrid Methods, as categorized below.\n   With respect to a *single*\
    \ stream of interest, Hybrid Type I methods\n   fit in the continuum as follows,\
    \ in terms of what happens at the\n   Source (or Observation Point nearby):\n\
    \   o  Generation of the stream of interest => Active\n   o  Augmentation or modification\
    \ of the stream of interest, or\n      employment of methods that modify the treatment\
    \ of the stream =>\n      Hybrid Type I\n   o  Observation of a stream of interest\
    \ => Passive\n   As an example, consider the case where the method generates traffic\n\
    \   load stream(s), and observes an existing stream of interest according\n  \
    \ to the criteria for Passive Methods.  Since loading streams are an\n   aspect\
    \ of Active Methods, the stream of interest is not \"solely\n   observed\", and\
    \ the measurements involve a single stream of interest\n   whose treatment has\
    \ been modified by the presence of the load.\n   Therefore, this is a Hybrid Type\
    \ I method.\n   We define Hybrid Type II as follows: Methods that employ two or\
    \ more\n   different streams of interest with some degree of mutual coordination\n\
    \   (e.g., one or more Active streams and one or more undisturbed and\n   unmodified\
    \ packet streams) to collect both Active and Passive Metrics\n   and enable enhanced\
    \ characterization from additional joint analysis.\n   [HYBRID] presents a problem\
    \ statement for Hybrid Type II Methods and\n   Metrics.  Note that one or more\
    \ Hybrid Type I streams could be\n   substituted for the Active streams or undisturbed\
    \ streams in the\n   mutually coordinated set.  It is the Type II Methods where\
    \ unique\n   Hybrid Metrics are anticipated to emerge.\n   Methods based on a\
    \ combination of a single (generated) Active stream\n   and Passive observations\
    \ applied to the stream of interest at\n   intermediate Observation Points are\
    \ also Hybrid Methods.  However,\n   [RFC5644] already defines these as Spatial\
    \ Metrics and Methods.  It\n   is possible to replace the Active stream of [RFC5644]\
    \ with a Hybrid\n   Type I stream and measure Spatial Metrics (but this was unanticipated\n\
    \   when [RFC5644] was developed).\n   The table below illustrates the categorization\
    \ of methods (where\n   \"Synthesis\" refers to a combination of Active and Passive\
    \ Method\n   attributes).\n                       | Single Stream          | Multiple\

- title: 4.1.  Graphical Representation
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Graphical Representation\n   If we compare the Active and Passive Methods,\
    \ there are at least two\n   dimensions on which methods can be evaluated.  This\
    \ evaluation space\n   may be useful when a method is a combination of the two\
    \ alternative\n   methods.\n   The two dimensions (initially chosen) are:\n  \
    \ Y-Axis:  \"Effect of the measured stream on network conditions\".  The\n   \
    \   degree to which the stream of interest biases overall network\n      conditions\
    \ experienced by that stream and other streams.  This is\n      a key dimension\
    \ for Active measurement error analysis.  (Comment:\n      There is also the notion\
    \ of time averages -- a measurement stream\n      may have significant effect\
    \ while it is present, but the stream is\n      only generated 0.1% of the time.\
    \  On the other hand, observations\n      alone have no effect on network performance.\
    \  To keep these\n      dimensions simple, we consider the stream effect only\
    \ when it is\n      present, but note that reactive networks defined in [RFC7312]\
    \ may\n      exhibit bias for some time beyond the life of a stream.)\n   X-Axis:\
    \  \"a priori Stream Knowledge\".  The degree to which stream\n      characteristics\
    \ are known a priori.  There are methodological\n      advantages of knowing the\
    \ source stream characteristics, and\n      having complete control of the stream\
    \ characteristics.  For\n      example, knowing the number of packets in a stream\
    \ allows more-\n      efficient operation of the measurement receiver, and so\
    \ is an\n      asset for Active Methods of Measurement.  Passive Methods (with\
    \ no\n      sample filter) have few clues available to anticipate what\n     \
    \ protocol the first packet observed will use or how many packets\n      will\
    \ comprise the flow; once the standard protocol of a flow is\n      known, the\
    \ possibilities narrow (for some compliant flows).\n      Therefore, this is a\
    \ key dimension for Passive measurement error\n      analysis.\n   There are a\
    \ few examples we can plot on a two-dimensional space.  We\n   can anchor the\
    \ dimensions with reference point descriptions.\n   Y-Axis:Effect of the measured\

    \ \"PDM\" refers to [PDMOPTION], an IPv6 Option\n   Header for Performance and\
    \ Diagnostic Measurements, described in\n   Section 4.2.)\n   We recognize that\
    \ method categorization could be based on additional\n   dimensions, but this\
    \ would require a different graphical approach.\n   For example, \"effect of stream\
    \ of interest on network conditions\"\n   could easily be further qualified into:\n\
    \   1.  effect on the performance of the stream of interest itself: for\n    \
    \   example, choosing a packet marking or Differentiated Services\n       Code\
    \ Point (DSCP) resulting in domain treatment as a real-time\n       stream (as\
    \ opposed to default/best-effort marking).\n   2.  effect on unmeasured streams\
    \ that share the path and/or\n       bottlenecks: for example, an extremely sparse\
    \ measured stream of\n       minimal size packets typically has little effect\
    \ on other flows\n       (and itself), while a stream designed to characterize\
    \ path\n       capacity may affect all other flows passing through the capacity\n\
    \       bottleneck (including itself).\n   3.  effect on network conditions resulting\
    \ in network adaptation: for\n       example, a network monitoring load and congestion\
    \ conditions\n       might change routing, placing some flows on alternate paths\
    \ to\n       mitigate the congestion.\n   We have combined 1 and 2 on the Y-axis,\
    \ as examination of examples\n   indicates strong correlation of the effects in\
    \ this pair, and network\n   adaptation is not addressed.\n   It is apparent that\
    \ different methods of IP network measurement can\n   produce different results,\
    \ even when measuring the same path at the\n   same time.  The two dimensions\
    \ of the graph help us to understand how\n   the results might change with the\
    \ method chosen.  For example, an\n   Active Method to assess throughput adds\
    \ some amount of traffic to the\n   network, which might result in lower throughput\
    \ for all streams.\n   However, a Passive Method to assess throughput can also\
    \ err on the\n   low side due to unknown limitations of the hosts providing traffic,\n\
    \   competition for host resources, limitations of the network interface,\n  \
    \ or private sub-networks that are not an intentional part of the path,\n   etc.\
    \  Hybrid Methods could easily suffer from both forms of error.\n   Another example\
    \ of potential errors stems from the pitfalls of using\n   an Active stream with\
    \ known a bias, such as a periodic stream defined\n   in [RFC3432].  The strength\
    \ of modeling periodic streams (like Voice\n   over IP (VoIP)) is a potential\
    \ weakness when extending the measured\n   results to other application whose\
    \ streams are non-periodic.  The\n   solutions are to model the application streams\
    \ more exactly with an\n   Active Method or to accept the risks and potential\
    \ errors with the\n   Passive Method discussed above.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Discussion of PDM
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Discussion of PDM\n   In [PDMOPTION], an IPv6 Option Header for Performance\
    \ and Diagnostic\n   Measurements (PDM) is described which, when added to the\
    \ stream of\n   interest at strategic interfaces, supports performance measurements.\n\
    \   This method processes a user traffic stream and adds \"fields which\n   are\
    \ dedicated to measurement\" (the measurement intent is made clear\n   in the\
    \ title of this option).  Thus:\n   o  The method intends to have a minor effect\
    \ on the measured stream\n      and other streams in the network.  There are conditions\
    \ where this\n      intent may not be realized.\n   o  The measured stream has\
    \ unknown characteristics until it is\n      processed to add the PDM Option header.\
    \  Note that if the packet\n      MTU is exceeded after adding the header, the\
    \ intent to have a\n      minor effect will not be realized.\n   We conclude that\
    \ this is a Hybrid Type I method, having at least one\n   characteristic of both\
    \ Active and Passive Methods for a single stream\n   of interest.\n"

  - "4.3.  Discussion of \"Coloring\" Method\n   [OPSAWG], proposed to color packets\
    \ by re-writing a field of the\n   stream at strategic interfaces to support performance\
    \ measurements\n   (noting that this is a difficult operation at an intermediate\
    \ point\n   on an encrypted Virtual Private Network).  This method processes a\n\
    \   user traffic stream and inserts \"fields or values which are dedicated\n \
    \  to measurement\".  Thus:\n   o  The method intends to have a minor effect on\
    \ the measured stream\n      and other streams in the network (less than PDM above).\
    \  There are\n      conditions where this intent may not be realized.\n   o  The\
    \ measured stream has unknown characteristics until it is\n      processed to\
    \ add the coloring in the header, and the stream could\n      be measured and\
    \ time-stamped during that process.\n   We note that [COLORING] proposes a method\
    \ similar to [OPSAWG], as\n   discussion on the IPPM mailing list revealed.\n\
    \   We conclude that this is a Hybrid Type I method, having at least one\n   characteristic\

- title: 4.4.  Brief Discussion of OAM Methods
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Brief Discussion of OAM Methods\n   Many Operations, Administration, and\
    \ Management (OAM) methods exist\n   beyond the IP layer.  For example, [Y.1731]\
    \ defines several different\n   measurement methods that we would classify as\
    \ follows:\n   o  Loss Measurement (LM) occasionally injects frames with a count\
    \ of\n      previous frames since the last LM message.  We conclude LM is\n  \
    \    Hybrid Type I, because this method processes a user traffic stream\n    \
    \  and augments the stream of interest with frames having \"fields\n      which\
    \ are dedicated to measurement\".\n   o  Synthetic Loss Measurement (SLM) and\
    \ Delay Measurement (DM)\n      methods both inject dedicated measurement frames,\
    \ so the \"stream\n      of interest is generated as the basis of measurement\"\
    .  We\n      conclude that SLM and DM methods are Active Methods.\n   We also\
    \ recognize the existence of alternate terminology used in OAM\n   at layers other\
    \ than IP.  Readers are encouraged to consult [RFC6374]\n   for MPLS Loss and\
    \ Delay measurement terminology, for example.\n"
