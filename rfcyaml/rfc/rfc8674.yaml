- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many web sites have a \"safe\" mode to assist those who\
    \ don't want to\n   be exposed (or have their children exposed) to content to\
    \ which they\n   might object.\n   However, that goal is often difficult to achieve\
    \ because of the need\n   to go to every web site that might be used and navigate\
    \ to the\n   appropriate page (possibly creating an account along the way) to\
    \ get\n   a cookie [RFC6265] set in the browser, for each browser on every\n \
    \  device used.\n   A more manageable approach is for the browser to proactively\
    \ indicate\n   a preference for safe content.  A user agent that supports doing\
    \ so\n   (whether it be an individual browser or through an operating system\n\
    \   HTTP library) need only be configured once to ensure that the\n   preference\
    \ is advertised to a set of sites, or even all sites.\n   This specification defines\
    \ how to declare this desire in requests as\n   an HTTP Preference [RFC7240].\n\
    \   Note that this specification does not define what content might be\n   considered\
    \ objectionable, so the concept of \"safe\" is not precisely\n   defined.  Rather,\
    \ the term is interpreted by the server and within\n   the scope of each web site\
    \ that chooses to act upon this information.\n   That said, the intent is to allow\
    \ end users (or those acting on their\n   behalf) to express a desire to avoid\
    \ content that is considered\n   objectionable within the cultural context of\
    \ that site; usually (but\n   not always), the objectionable content is content\
    \ unsuitable for\n   minors.  The safe preference is not intended to be used for\
    \ other\n   purposes.\n   Furthermore, sending the preference does not guarantee\
    \ that the web\n   site will use it or that it will apply a concept of \"objectionable\"\
    \n   that is consistent with the requester's views.  As such, its effect\n   can\
    \ be described as \"best effort\" and not to be relied upon.  In\n   other words,\
    \ sending the preference is no more reliable than going to\n   each web site and\
    \ manually selecting a safe mode, but it is\n   considerably easier.\n   It is\
    \ also important to note that the safe preference is not a\n   reliable indicator\
    \ that the end user is a child; other users might\n   have a desire for unobjectionable\
    \ content, and some children might\n   browse without the preference being set.\n\
    \   Note also that the cultural context applies to the hosting location\n   of\
    \ a site, the content provider, and the source of the content.  It\n   cannot\
    \ be guaranteed that a user agent and origin server will have\n   the same view\
    \ of the concept of what is objectionable.\n   Simply put, it is a statement by\
    \ (or on behalf of) the end user\n   indicating that \"if your site has a safe\
    \ setting, this user is hereby\n   opting into that, according to your definition\
    \ of the term.\"\n   The mechanism described in this document does not have IETF\
    \ consensus\n   and is not a standard.  It is a widely deployed approach that\
    \ has\n   turned out to be useful and is presented here so that server and\n \
    \  browser implementations can have a common understanding of how it\n   operates.\n\
    \   This mechanism was presented for publication as an IETF Proposed\n   Standard\
    \ but was not approved for publication by the IESG because of\n   concerns that\
    \ included the vagueness of the meaning of \"safe\", the\n   ability of a proxy\
    \ to insert the hint outside of a user's control,\n   the fact that there was\
    \ no way to know whether the hint was or was\n   not applied to the response returned\
    \ by the server, and the\n   possibility that the use of this preference may incentivize\
    \ increased\n   censorship and/or targeting of minors.\n   The specification was\
    \ updated to address those concerns, but the IESG\n   did not approve progressing\
    \ this document as an IETF Proposed\n   Standard.  As a result, it has been published\
    \ in the Independent\n   Stream.\n"

- title: 2.  The "safe" Preference
  contents:
  - "2.  The \"safe\" Preference\n   When present in a request, the safe preference\
    \ indicates that the\n   user prefers that the origin server not respond with\
    \ content that is\n   designated as objectionable, according to the origin server's\n\
    \   definition of the concept.\n   For example, this is a request that includes\
    \ the safe preference:\n   GET /foo.html HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.example.org\n\
    \   User-Agent: ExampleBrowser/1.0\n   Prefer: safe\n   Typically, user agents\
    \ that emit the safe preference will include it\n   in all requests with the \"\
    https\" URI scheme, although some might\n   expose finer-grained controls over\
    \ when it is sent; this ensures that\n   the preference is available to the applicable\
    \ resources.  User agents\n   MUST NOT emit the safe preference on requests with\
    \ the \"http\" URI\n   scheme (see Section 3).  See Appendix A for more information\
    \ about\n   configuring the set of resources the safe preference is sent to.\n\
    \   The safe preference MAY be implemented in common HTTP libraries\n   (e.g.,\
    \ an operating system might choose to insert the preference in\n   requests based\
    \ upon system-wide configuration).\n   Origin servers that utilize the safe preference\
    \ ought to document\n   that they do so, along with the criteria that they use\
    \ to denote\n   objectionable content.  If a server has more fine-grained degrees\
    \ of\n   safety, it SHOULD select a reasonable default to use and document\n \
    \  that; it MAY use additional mechanisms (e.g., cookies [RFC6265]) to\n   fine-tune.\n\
    \   A response corresponding to the request above might have headers that\n  \
    \ look like this:\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n   Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n   Content-Type:\
    \ text/html\n   Preference-Applied: safe\n   Server: ExampleServer/2.0\n   Vary:\
    \ Prefer\n   Here, the Preference-Applied response header [RFC7240] indicates\
    \ that\n   the site has applied the preference.  Servers are not required to\n\
    \   send Preference-Applied (even when they have applied the preference)\n   but\
    \ are encouraged to where possible.\n   Note that the Vary response header needs\
    \ to be sent if the response\n   is cacheable and might change depending on the\
    \ value of the Prefer\n   header.  This is not only true for those responses that\
    \ are safe but\n   also the default unsafe response.\n   See Section 4.1 of [RFC7234]\
    \ for more information about the\n   interaction between the Vary header field\
    \ and web caching.\n   See Appendix B for additional advice specific to web servers\
    \ wishing\n   to use the safe preference.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The safe preference is not a secure mechanism;\
    \ it can be inserted or\n   removed by intermediaries with access to the request\
    \ stream (e.g.,\n   for \"http\" URLs).  Therefore, it is prohibited from being\
    \ included in\n   requests with the \"http\" scheme.\n   Its presence reveals\
    \ information about the user, which may be of\n   assistance in fingerprinting\
    \ the user by sites and other entities in\n   the network.  This information provides\
    \ insight into the preferences\n   of the user and might be used to make assumptions\
    \ about user; thus,\n   it could be used to identify categories of users for purposes\
    \ such as\n   targeting (including advertising and identification of minors).\n\
    \   Therefore, user agents SHOULD NOT include it in requests when the\n   user\
    \ has expressed a desire to avoid such attacks (e.g., some forms\n   of private\
    \ mode browsing).\n   By its nature, including the safe preference in requests\
    \ does not\n   ensure that all content will actually be safe; content is safe\
    \ only\n   when servers elect to honor it.\n   Even then, a malicious server might\
    \ adapt content so that it is even\n   less safe (by some definition of the word).\
    \  As such, this mechanism\n   on its own is not enough to ensure that only safe\
    \ content is seen;\n   those who wish to ensure that will need to combine its\
    \ use with other\n   techniques (e.g., content filtering).\n   Furthermore, the\
    \ server and user may have differing ideas regarding\n   the semantics of \"safe\"\
    .  As such, the safety of the user's\n   experience when browsing from site to\
    \ site, as well as over time,\n   might (and probably will) change.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Sending the "safe" Preference from Web Browsers
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Sending the \"safe\" Preference from Web Browsers\n   As discussed\
    \ in Section 2, there are many possible ways for the safe\n   preference to be\
    \ generated.  One possibility is for a web browser to\n   allow its users to configure\
    \ the preference to be sent.\n   When doing so, it is important not to misrepresent\
    \ the preference as\n   binding to web sites.  For example, an appropriate setting\
    \ might be a\n   checkbox with wording such as:\n      [] Request safe content\
    \ from web sites\n   along with further information available upon request.\n\
    \   Browsers might also allow the safe preference to be locked to prevent\n  \
    \ modification without administrative access or a passcode.\n   Note that this\
    \ specification does not require browsers to send the\n   safe preference on all\
    \ requests, although that is one possible\n   implementation; alternate implementation\
    \ strategies include\n   blacklists and whitelists.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  Supporting the "safe" Preference on Web Sites
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Supporting the \"safe\" Preference on Web Sites\n   Web sites that\
    \ allow configuration of a safe mode (for example, using\n   a cookie) can add\
    \ support for the safe preference incrementally;\n   since the preference will\
    \ not be supported by all clients\n   immediately, it is necessary to have another\
    \ way to configure it.\n   When honoring the safe preference, it is important\
    \ that it not be\n   possible to disable it through the web site's interface,\
    \ since the\n   safe preference may be configured and locked down by the browser\
    \ or\n   computer's administrator (e.g., a parent).  If the site has such a\n\
    \   means of configuration (e.g., stored user preferences) and the safe\n   preference\
    \ is received in a request, the \"safer\" interpretation ought\n   to be used.\n\
    \   The appropriate level of safety is a site-specific decision.  When\n   selecting\
    \ it, sites ought to bear in mind that disabling the\n   preference might be considerably\
    \ more onerous than using other means,\n   especially if the preference is generated\
    \ based upon the operating\n   system configuration.\n   Sites might offer different\
    \ levels of safety through web\n   configuration; they will need to either inform\
    \ their users of what\n   level the safe hint corresponds to or provide them with\
    \ some means of\n   adjusting it.\n   If users express a wish to disable safe\
    \ mode, the site can remind\n   them that the safe preference is being sent and\
    \ ask them to consult\n   their administrator (since the safe preference might\
    \ be set by a\n   locked-down operating system configuration).\n   As explained\
    \ in Section 2, responses that change based upon the\n   presence of the safe\
    \ preference need to either carry the \"Vary:\n   Prefer\" response header field\
    \ or be uncacheable by shared caches\n   (e.g., with a \"Cache-Control: private\"\
    \ response header field).  This\n   is to avoid an unsafe cached response being\
    \ served to a client that\n   prefers safe content (or vice versa).\n"
