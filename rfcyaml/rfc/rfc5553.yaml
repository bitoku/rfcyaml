  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
    (GMPLS)\n   Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) are signaled\n
    \  using the TE extensions to the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP-\n   TE)
    [RFC3209], [RFC3473].  The routes followed by MPLS and GMPLS TE\n   LSPs may be
    computed by Path Computation Elements (PCEs) [RFC4655].\n   Where the TE LSP crosses
    multiple domains [RFC4726], such as\n   Autonomous Systems (ASes), the path may
    be computed by multiple PCEs\n   that cooperate, with each responsible for computing
    a segment of the\n   path.  To preserve confidentiality of topology with each
    AS, the PCE\n   Communications Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] supports a mechanism
    to hide\n   the contents of a segment of a path, called the Confidential Path\n
    \  Segment (CPS), by encoding the contents as a Path Key Subobject (PKS)\n   [RFC5520].\n
    \  This document defines RSVP-TE protocol extensions necessary to\n   support

    - "1.2.  Usage Scenario\n   Figure 1 shows a simple network constructed of two
      ASes.  An LSP is\n   desired from the ingress in AS-1 to the egress in AS-2.
      \ As described\n   in [RFC4655], the ingress Label Switching Router (LSR) acts
      as a Path\n   Computation Client (PCC) and sends a request to its PCE (PCE-1).\n
      \  PCE-1 can compute the path within AS-1 but has no visibility into\n   AS-2.
      \ So PCE-1 cooperates with PCE-2 to complete the path\n   computation.\n   However,
      PCE-2 does not want to share the information about the path\n   across AS-2
      with nodes outside the AS.  So, as described in\n   [RFC5520], PCE-2 reports
      the AS-2 path segment using a PKS rather\n   than the explicit details of the
      path.\n   PCE-1 can now return the path to be signaled to the ingress LSR in
      a\n   path computation response with the AS-2 segment still hidden as a\n   PKS.\n
      \  In order to set up the LSP, the ingress LSR signals using RSVP-TE and\n   encodes
      the path reported by PCE-1 in the Explicit Route Object\n   (ERO).  This process
      is as normal for RSVP-TE but requires that the\n   PKS is also included in the
      ERO, using the mechanisms defined in this\n   document.\n   When the signaling
      message (the RSVP-TE Path message) reaches ASBR-2\n   (Autonomous System Border
      Router), it consults PCE-2 to 'decode' the\n   PKS and return the expanded explicit
      path segment to ASBR-2.  (The\n   information that PCE-2 uses to decode the
      PKS is encoded within the\n   PKS itself.) The PKS is replaced in the ERO with
      the expanded\n   information about the path.\n    -----------------------------

    - "3.1.  Explicit Route Object Processing Rules\n   The basic processing rules
      of an ERO are not altered.  Refer to\n   [RFC3209] for details.  In particular,
      an LSR is not required to\n   \"look ahead\" in the ERO beyond the first subobject
      that is non-local.\n   [RFC5520] requires that any path fragment generated by
      a PCE that\n   contains a PKS be such that the PKS is immediately preceded by
      a\n   subobject that identifies the head end of the PKS (for example, an\n   incoming
      interface or a node ID).  This rule is extended to the PKS\n   in the ERO so
      that the following rules are defined.\n   - If an LSR receives a Path message
      where the first subobject of the\n     ERO is a PKS, it MUST respond with a
      PathErr message carrying the\n     error code/value combination \"Routing Problem\"
      / \"Bad initial\n     subobject\".\n   - If an LSR strips all local subobjects
      from an ERO carried in a Path\n     message (according to the procedures in
      [RFC3209]) and finds that\n     the next subobject is a PKS, it MUST attempt
      to resolve the PKS to\n     a CPS.\n     Resolution of the PKS MAY take any
      of the following forms or use\n     some other technique subject to local policy
      and network\n     implementation.\n     o The LSR can use the PCE-ID contained
      in the PKS to contact the\n       identified PCE using PCEP [RFC5440] and request
      that the PKS be\n       expanded.\n     o The LSR can contact any PCE using
      PCEP [RFC5440] to request that\n       the PKS be expanded, relying on cooperation
      between the PCEs.\n     o The LSR can use the information in the PKS to index
      a CPS\n       previously supplied to it by the PCE that originated the PKS.\n
      \    If a CPS is derived, the path fragment SHOULD be inserted into the\n     ERO
      of the Path message as a direct replacement for the PKS.  Other\n     processing
      of the CPS and ERO are permitted as described in\n     [RFC3209].\n     This
      processing can give rise to the following error cases:\n     o PCE-ID cannot
      be matched to a PCE to decode the PKS.\n       The LSR sends a PathErr message
      with the error code \"Routing\n       Problem\" and the new error value \"Unknown
      PCE-ID for PKS\n       expansion\" (see Section 6.3).\n     o PCE identified
      by the PCE-ID cannot be reached.\n       The LSR sends a PathErr message with
      the error code \"Routing\n       Problem\" and the new error value \"Unreachable
      PCE for PKS\n       expansion\" (see Section 6.3).\n     o The PCE is unable
      to decode the PKS, perhaps because the Path Key\n       has expired.\n       The
      LSR sends a PathErr message with the error code \"Routing\n       Problem\"
      and the new error value \"Unknown Path Key for PKS\n       expansion\" (see
      Section 6.3).\n     o PKS cannot be decoded for policy reasons.\n       The
      LSR sends a PathErr message with the error code \"Policy\n       Control Failure\"
      and the error value \"Inter-domain policy\n       failure\".\n     o Addition
      of CPS to ERO causes Path message to become too large.\n       The LSR MAY replace
      part of the ERO with loose hops [RFC3209] or\n       with a further PKS, according
      to local policy, if the loss of\n       specifics within the explicit path is
      acceptable.  If the LSR is\n       unable to take steps to reduce the size of
      the ERO, it MUST send\n       a PathErr message with the error code \"Routing
      Problem\" and the\n       new error value \"ERO too large for MTU\" (see Section
      6.3).\n   - An LSR that is called on to process a PKS within an ERO but that\n
      \    does not recognize the subobject, will react according to [RFC3209]\n     and
      send a PathErr message with the error code/value combination\n     \"Routing
      Problem\" / \"Bad Explicit Route Object\".\n"

    - "3.2.  Reporting Path Key Segments in Record Route Objects\n   The Record Route
      Object (RRO) is used in RSVP-TE to record the route\n   traversed by an LSP.
      \ The RRO may be present on a Path message and on\n   a Resv message.  The intention
      of [RFC3209] is that an RRO on a Resv\n   message that is received by an ingress
      LSR is suitable for use as an\n   ERO on a Path message sent by that LSR to
      achieve an identical LSP.\n   The PKS offers an alternative that can be more
      useful to diagnostics.\n   When the signaling message crosses a domain boundary,

      in\n   the RRO with a PKS.  In the case of an RRO on a Resv message, the PKS\n

      that performs the substitution for at\n   least the lifetime of the LSP.  In

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The protocol interactions required by the mechanisms
    described in\n   this document are point-to-point and can be authenticated and
    made\n   secure as described in [RFC5440] and [RFC3209].  The protocol\n   interactions
    for PCEP are listed in [RFC5520], while general\n   considerations for securing
    RSVP-TE in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks can\n   be found in [MPLS-SEC].\n   Thus,
    security issues can be dealt with using standard techniques for\n   securing and
    authenticating point-to-point communications.  In\n   addition, it is RECOMMENDED
    that the PCE providing a PKS expansion\n   check that the LSR that issued the
    request for PKS expansion is the\n   head end of the resulting CPS.\n   Further
    protection can be provided by using a PCE-ID to identify the\n   decoding PCE
    that is only meaningful within the domain that contains\n   the LSR at the head
    of the CPS.  This may be either an IP address\n   that is only reachable from
    within the domain or some non-address\n   value.  The former requires configuration
    of policy on the PCEs; the\n   latter requires domain-wide policy.\n   The following
    specific security issues need to be considered.\n   - Confidentiality of the CPS.
    \ The question to be answered is whether\n     other network elements can probe
    a PCE for the expansion of PKSs,\n     possibly generating Path Keys at random.
    \ This can be protected\n     against by only allowing PKS expansion to be successfully
    completed\n     if requested by the LSR that is at the head end of the resulting\n
    \    CPS.  Under specific circumstances, PKS expansion might also be\n     allowed
    by configured management stations.\n     The CPS itself may be kept confidential
    as it is exchanged in the\n     PCEP and RSVP-TE protocols using standard security
    mechanisms\n     defined for those protocols.\n   - Determination of information
    by probing.  In addition to the\n     probing described above, a node might deduce
    information from the\n     error responses that are generated when PKS expansion
    fails as\n     described in Section 3.1.  Any LSR that determines that supplying\n
    \    one of the detailed error codes described in Section 3.1 might\n     provide
    too much information that could be used as part of a\n     systematic attack MAY
    simply use the error code/value \"Policy\n     Control Failure\" / \"Inter-domain
    policy failure\" in all cases.\n   - Authenticity of the Path Key.  A concern
    is that the Path Key in\n     the PKS will be altered or faked, leading to erroneous
    Path Key\n     expansion and use of the wrong CPS.  The consequence would be a
    bad\n     ERO in a Path message, causing the LSP to be set up incorrectly and\n
    \    resulting in incorrect network resource usage, diversion of traffic\n     to
    where it can be intercepted, or failure to set up the LSP.\n     These problems
    can be prevented by protecting the protocol\n     exchanges in PCEP and RSVP-TE
    using the security techniques\n     described in [RFC5440], [RFC3209], and [MPLS-SEC].\n
    \  - Resilience to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  A PCE can be\n     attacked
    through a flood of Path Key expansion requests -- this\n     issue is addressed
    in [RFC5520] and is out of scope for this\n     document.  A further attack might
    consist of sending a flood of\n     RSVP-TE Path messages with deliberately spurious
    PKSs.  This attack\n     is prevented by ensuring the integrity of the Path messages
    using\n     standard RSVP-TE security mechanisms and by enforcing the RSVP-TE\n
    \    chain-of-trust security model.\n"

      an important part of the use of PKSs in EROs and RROs.\n   There are local and
      domain-wide policies that SHOULD be available for\n   configuration in an implementation.\n
      \  - Handling of an ERO containing a PKS.  As described in Section 3.1,\n     an
      LSR that receives a Path message containing a PKS can be\n     configured to
      reject the Path message according to policy.\n   - Handling of PKS requests
      at a PCE.  As described in Section 3.1, in\n     [RFC5520], and in [RFC5394],
      a PCE can be configured with policy\n     regarding how it should handle requests
      for PKS expansion.\n   - PKS expansion.  Section 3.1 explains that the PKS can
      be expanded\n     by the local LSR, the specific PCE identified in the PKS,
      any PCE\n     acting as a proxy, or by some other method.  The behavior of the\n
      \    LSR needs to be locally configurable but is subject to the domain-\n     wide
      policy.\n   - Interpretation of PCE-ID.  The interpretation of the PCE-ID\n
      \    component of PKSs is subject to domain-local policy and needs to be\n     configurable
      as such.  See Section 3 and Section 4 for the options.\n   - ERO too large.
      \ The behavior of an LSR when it finds that adding a\n     CPS to the ERO causes
      the Path message to be too large is an\n     implementation choice.  However,
      implementations may choose to\n     provide configuration of behavior as described
      in Section 3.1.\n   - Masking of RRO.  As described in Section 3.2, a border
      router can\n     choose to mask segments of the path by replacing them with
      PKSs.\n     This behavior needs to be configurable, with the default being to\n
      \    not hide any part of the RRO.\n   - Inspection / decoding of PKS by diagnostic
      tools.  A PCE can allow\n     access from management or diagnostic tools to
      request the expansion\n     of a PKS.  Note that this must be regulated with
      the security and\n     confidentiality behavior described in Section 4.\n   -
      Hiding of reason codes.  An LSR can support the configuration of\n     local
      policy to hide reason codes associated with the failure to\n     expand a PKS
      and, as described in Section 4, report all errors as\n     policy failures.\n
      \  The treatment of a path segment as a CPS, and its substitution in a\n   PCRep
      ERO with a PKS, is a PCE function and is described in\n   [RFC5520].\n"
