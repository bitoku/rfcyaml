349 INTERNET NUMBERS STATUS OF THIS MEMO
This memo is an official status report on the network numbers used in the Internet community.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
Introduction This Network Working Group Request for Comments
documents the currently assigned network numbers and gateway autonomous systems.
This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case current information can be obtained from Hostmaster at the DDN Network Information Center (NIC).

Most of the protocols used in the Internet are documented in the RFC series of notes.
Some of the items listed are undocumented.
Further information on protocols can be found in the memo "Official Internet Protocols" [32].
The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the "DDN Protocol Handbook" [12] prepared by the NIC.
Other collections of older or obsolete protocols are contained in the "Internet Protocol Transition Workbook" [13], or in the "ARPANET Protocol Transition Handbook" [14].
For further information on ordering the complete 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook, contact the Hostmaster.
The lists below contain the name and network mailbox of the individuals responsible for each registered network or autonomous system.
The bracketed entry, e.g., [nn,iii], at the right hand margin of the page indicates a reference for the listed network or autonomous system, where the number ("nn") cites the document and the letters ("iii") cite the NIC Handle of the responsible person.
The NIC Handle is a unique identifier that is used in the NIC WHOIS/NICNAME service.
People occasionally change electronic mailboxes.
To find out the current network mailbox or phone number for an individual, or to get information about a registered network, use the NIC WHOIS/NICNAME service or contact HOSTMASTER@SRI NIC.ARPA.
The convention used for the documentation of Internet Protocols is to express numbers in decimal and to picture data in "big endian" order [8].
That is, fields are described left to right, with the most significant octet on the left and the least significant octet on the right.
The order of transmission of the header and data described in this document is resolved to the octet level.
Whenever a diagram shows a group of octets, the order of transmission of those octets is the normal order in which they are read in English.
For example, in the following diagram the octets are transmitted in the order they are numbered. 0
Whenever an octet represents a numeric quantity the left most bit in the diagram is the high order or most significant bit.
That is, the bit labeled 0 is the most significant bit.
For example, the following diagram represents the value 170 (decimal).
1 2 3 4 5 6 7    1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0    Significance of Bits Similarly, whenever a multi octet field represents a numeric quantity the left most bit of the whole field is the most significant bit.
When a multi octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is transmitted first.
The network numbers listed here are used as internet addresses by the Internet Protocol (IP) [12,27].
The IP uses a 32 bit address field and divides that address into a network part and a "rest" or local address part.
The division takes 4 forms or classes.
The first type of address, or class A, has a 7 bit network number and a 24 bit local address.
The highest order bit is set to 0.
This allows 128 class A networks.
The second type of address, class B, has a 14 bit network number and a 16 bit local address.
The two highest order bits are set to 1 0.
This allows 16,384 class B networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
The third type of address, class C, has a 21 bit network number and a 8 bit local address.
The three highest order bits are set to 1 1 0.
This allows 2,097,152 class C networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
The fourth type of address, class D, is used as a multicast address [11].
The four highest order bits are set to 1 1 1 0.
No addresses are allowed with the four highest order bits set to 1 1 1 1.
These addresses, called "class E", are reserved.
One commonly used notation for internet host addresses divides the 32 bit address into four 8 bit fields and specifies the value of each field as a decimal number with the fields separated by periods.
This is called the "dotted decimal" notation.
For example, the internet address of VENERA.ISI.EDU in dotted decimal is 010.001.000.052, or 10.1.0.52.
The dotted decimal notation will be used in the listing of assigned network numbers.
A networks will have nnn.rrr.rrr.rrr, the class B networks will have nnn.nnn.rrr.rrr, and the class C networks will have nnn.nnn.nnn.rrr, where nnn represents part or all of a network number and rrr represents part or all of a local address.
There are four catagories of users of Internet Addresses: Research, Defense, Government (Non Defense), and Commercial.
To reflect the allocation of network identifiers among the categories, a one  character code is placed to the left of the network number: R for Research, D for Defense, G for Government, and C for Commercial (see Appendix A for further details on this division of the network identification).
Network numbers are assigned for networks that are connected to the research Internet and operational Internet, and for independent networks that use the IP family protocols (these are usually commercial).
These independent networks are marked with an asterisk preceding the number.
The administrators of independent networks must apply separately for permission to interconnect their network with the Internet.
Independent networks should not be listed in the working tables of the Internet hosts or gateways.
For various reasons, the assigned numbers of networks are sometimes changed.
To ease the transition the old number will be listed for a transition period as well.
These "old number" entries will be marked with a "T" following the number and preceding the name, and the network name will be suffixed " TEMP".
: In certain contexts, it is useful to have fixed addresses with functional significance rather than as identifiers of specific hosts.
The address zero is to be interpreted as meaning "this", as in "this network".
For example, the address 0.0.0.37 could be interpreted as meaning host 37 on this network.
The address of all ones are to be interpreted as meaning "all", as in "all hosts".
For example, the address 128.9.255.255 could be interpreted as meaning all hosts on the network 128.9.
The class A network number 127 is assigned the "loopback" function, that is, a datagram sent by a higher level protocol to a network 127 address should loop back inside the host.
No datagram "sent" to a network 127 address should ever appear on any network anywhere.

The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) [33,35] specifies that groups of gateways may form autonomous systems.
The EGP provides a 16 bit field for identifying such systems.
The values of this field are registered here.

The network numbers in class A, B, and C network addresses are allocated among Research, Defense, Government (Non Defense) and Commercial uses.
Class A (highest order bit 0)
12286 Reserved Addresses: (0, 16383)
1572862 Reserved Addresses: (0, 2097151)
All addresses in this class are allocated for multicast use.
Class E (highest order bits 1 1 1 1)
All addresses in this class are reserved for future use.
Experimental networks which later become operational need not be renumbered.
Rather, the identifiers could be moved from Research to Defense, Government or Commercial status.
Thus, network identifiers may change state among Research, Defense, Government and Commercial, but the number of identifiers allocated to each use must remain within the limits indicated above.
To make possible this fluid assignment, the network identifier spaces are not allocated by simple partition, but rather by specific assignment.
Also, organizations not currently affiliated with the Internet may be assigned numbers for networks for non connected service.
If at some later time such networks are connecteed to the Internet (with appropriate prermissions and approvals)
the networks need not be renumbered.
