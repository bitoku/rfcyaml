  - "1.1.  Background\n   In general, a public-key certificate (hereinafter \"certificate\"\
    )\n   binds a public key held by an entity (such as person, organization,\n  \
    \ account, device, or site) to a set of information that identifies the\n   entity\
    \ associated with use of the corresponding private key.  In most\n   cases involving\
    \ identity certificates, this entity is known as the\n   \"subject\" or \"subscriber\"\
    \ of the certificate.  Two exceptions,\n   however, include devices (in which\
    \ the subscriber is usually the\n   individual or organization controlling the\
    \ device) and anonymous\n   certificates (in which the identity of the individual\
    \ or organization\n   is not available from the certificate itself).  Other types\
    \ of\n   certificates bind public keys to attributes of an entity other than\n\
    \   the entity's identity, such as a role, a title, or creditworthiness\n   information.\n\
    \   A certificate is used by a \"certificate user\" or \"relying party\" that\n\
    \   needs to use, and rely upon the accuracy of, the binding between the\n   subject\
    \ public key distributed via that certificate and the identity\n   and/or other\
    \ attributes of the subject contained in that certificate.\n   A relying party\
    \ is frequently an entity that verifies a digital\n   signature from the certificate's\
    \ subject where the digital signature\n   is associated with an email, web form,\
    \ electronic document, or other\n   data.  Other examples of relying parties can\
    \ include a sender of\n   encrypted email to the subscriber, a user of a web browser\
    \ relying on\n   a server certificate during a secure sockets layer (SSL) session,\
    \ and\n   an entity operating a server that controls access to online\n   information\
    \ using client certificates as an access control mechanism.\n   In summary, a\
    \ relying party is an entity that uses a public key in a\n   certificate (for\
    \ signature verification and/or encryption).  The\n   degree to which a relying\
    \ party can trust the binding embodied in a\n   certificate depends on several\
    \ factors.  These factors can include\n   the practices followed by the certification\
    \ authority (CA) in\n   authenticating the subject; the CA's operating policy,\
    \ procedures,\n   and security controls; the scope of the subscriber's responsibilities\n\
    \   (for example, in protecting the private key); and the stated\n   responsibilities\
    \ and liability terms and conditions of the CA (for\n   example, warranties, disclaimers\
    \ of warranties, and limitations of\n   liability).\n   A Version 3 X.509 certificate\
    \ may contain a field declaring that one\n   or more specific certificate policies\
    \ apply to that certificate\n   [ISO1].  According to X.509, a certificate policy\
    \ (CP) is \"a named\n   set of rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate\
    \ to a\n   particular community and/or class of applications with common\n   security\
    \ requirements.\"  A CP may be used by a relying party to help\n   in deciding\
    \ whether a certificate, and the binding therein, are\n   sufficiently trustworthy\
    \ and otherwise appropriate for a particular\n   application.  The CP concept\
    \ is an outgrowth of the policy statement\n   concept developed for Internet Privacy\
    \ Enhanced Mail [PEM1] and\n   expanded upon in [BAU1].  The legal and liability\
    \ aspects presented\n   in Section 4.9 are outcomes of a collaborative effort\
    \ between IETF\n   PKIX working group and the American Bar Association (ABA) members\
    \ who\n   have worked on legal acceptance of digital signature and role of PKI\n\
    \   in that acceptance.\n   A more detailed description of the practices followed\
    \ by a CA in\n   issuing and otherwise managing certificates may be contained\
    \ in a\n   certification practice statement (CPS) published by or referenced by\n\
    \   the CA.  According to the American Bar Association Information\n   Security\
    \ Committee's Digital Signature Guidelines (hereinafter\n   \"DSG\")(1) and the\
    \ Information Security Committee's PKI Assessment\n   Guidelines (hereinafter\
    \ \"PAG\")(2), \"a CPS is a statement of the\n   practices which a certification\
    \ authority employs in issuing\n   certificates.\" [ABA1, ABA2]  In general, CPSs\
    \ also describe practices\n   relating to all certificate lifecycle services (e.g.,\
    \ issuance,\n   management, revocation, and renewal or re-keying), and CPSs provide\n\
    \   details concerning other business, legal, and technical matters.  The\n  \
    \ terms contained in a CP or CPS may or may not be binding upon a PKI's\n   participants\
    \ as a contract.  A CP or CPS may itself purport to be a\n   contract.  More commonly,\
    \ however, an agreement may incorporate a CP\n   or CPS by reference and therefore\
    \ attempt to bind the parties of the\n   agreement to some or all of its terms.\
    \  For example, some PKIs may\n   utilize a CP or (more commonly) a CPS that is\
    \ incorporated by\n   reference in the agreement between a subscriber and a CA\
    \ or RA\n   (called a \"subscriber agreement\") or the agreement between a relying\n\
    \   party and a CA (called a \"relying party agreement\" or \"RPA\").  In\n  \
    \ other cases, however, a CP or CPS has no contractual significance at\n   all.\
    \  A PKI may intend these CPs and CPSs to be strictly\n   informational or disclosure\
    \ documents.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Purpose
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Purpose\n   The purpose of this document is twofold.  First, the document\
    \ aims to\n   explain the concepts of a CP and a CPS, describe the differences\n\
    \   between these two concepts, and describe their relationship to\n   subscriber\
    \ and relying party agreements.  Second, this document aims\n   to present a framework\
    \ to assist the writers and users of certificate\n   policies or CPSs in drafting\
    \ and understanding these documents.  In\n   particular, the framework identifies\
    \ the elements that may need to be\n   considered in formulating a CP or a CPS.\
    \  The purpose is not to\n   define particular certificate policies or CPSs, per\
    \ se.  Moreover,\n   this document does not aim to provide legal advice or recommendations\n\
    \   as to particular requirements or practices that should be contained\n   within\
    \ CPs or CPSs.  (Such recommendations, however, appear in\n   [ABA2].)\n"
- title: 1.3.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Scope\n   The scope of this document is limited to discussion of the topics\n\
    \   that can be covered in a CP (as defined in X.509) or CPS (as defined\n   in\
    \ the DSG and PAG).  In particular, this document describes the\n   types of information\
    \ that should be considered for inclusion in a CP\n   or a CPS.  While the framework\
    \ as presented generally assumes use of\n   the X.509 version 3 certificate format\
    \ for the purpose of providing\n   assurances of identity, it is not intended\
    \ that the material be\n   restricted to use of that certificate format or identity\n\
    \   certificates.  Rather, it is intended that this framework be\n   adaptable\
    \ to other certificate formats and to certificates providing\n   assurances other\
    \ than identity that may come into use.\n   The scope does not extend to defining\
    \ security policies generally\n   (such as organization security policy, system\
    \ security policy, or\n   data labeling policy).  Further, this document does\
    \ not define a\n   specific CP or CPS.  Moreover, in presenting a framework, this\n\
    \   document should be viewed and used as a flexible tool presenting\n   topics\
    \ that should be considered of particular relevance to CPs or\n   CPSs, and not\
    \ as a rigid formula for producing CPs or CPSs.\n   This document assumes that\
    \ the reader is familiar with the general\n   concepts of digital signatures,\
    \ certificates, and public-key\n   infrastructure (PKI), as used in X.509, the\
    \ DSG, and the PAG.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   This document makes use of the following defined terms:\n\
    \   Activation data - Data values, other than keys, that are required to\n   operate\
    \ cryptographic modules and that need to be protected (e.g., a\n   PIN, a passphrase,\
    \ or a manually-held key share).\n   Authentication - The process of establishing\
    \ that individuals,\n   organizations, or things are who or what they claim to\
    \ be.  In the\n   context of a PKI, authentication can be the process of establishing\n\
    \   that an individual or organization applying for or seeking access to\n   something\
    \ under a certain name is, in fact, the proper individual or\n   organization.\
    \  This corresponds to the second process involved with\n   identification, as\
    \ shown in the definition of \"identification\" below.\n   Authentication can\
    \ also refer to a security service that provides\n   assurances that individuals,\
    \ organizations, or things are who or what\n   they claim to be or that a message\
    \ or other data originated from a\n   specific individual, organization, or device.\
    \  Thus, it is said that\n   a digital signature of a message authenticates the\
    \ message's sender.\n   CA-certificate - A certificate for one CA's public key\
    \ issued by\n   another CA.\n   Certificate policy (CP) - A named set of rules\
    \ that indicates the\n   applicability of a certificate to a particular community\
    \ and/or class\n   of application with common security requirements.  For example,\
    \ a\n   particular CP might indicate applicability of a type of certificate\n\
    \   to the authentication of parties engaging in business-to-business\n   transactions\
    \ for the trading of goods or services within a given\n   price range.\n   Certification\
    \ path - An ordered sequence of certificates that,\n   together with the public\
    \ key of the initial object in the path, can\n   be processed to obtain that of\
    \ the final object in the path.\n   Certification Practice Statement (CPS) - A\
    \ statement of the practices\n   that a certification authority employs in issuing,\
    \ managing,\n   revoking, and renewing or re-keying certificates.\n   CPS Summary\
    \ (or CPS Abstract) - A subset of the provisions of a\n   complete CPS that is\
    \ made public by a CA.\n   Identification - The process of establishing the identity\
    \ of an\n   individual or organization, i.e., to show that an individual or\n\
    \   organization is a specific individual or organization.  In the\n   context\
    \ of a PKI, identification refers to two processes:\n   (1) establishing that\
    \ a given name of an individual or organization\n       corresponds to a real-world\
    \ identity of an individual or\n       organization, and\n   (2) establishing\
    \ that an individual or organization applying for or\n       seeking access to\
    \ something under that name is, in fact, the\n       named individual or organization.\
    \  A person seeking\n       identification may be a certificate applicant, an\
    \ applicant for\n       employment in a trusted position within a PKI participant,\
    \ or a\n       person seeking access to a network or software application, such\n\

- title: 3.1.  Certificate Policy
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Certificate Policy\n   When a certification authority issues a certificate,\
    \ it is providing\n   a statement to a certificate user (i.e., a relying party)\
    \ that a\n   particular public key is bound to the identity and/or other\n   attributes\
    \ of a particular entity (the certificate subject, which is\n   usually also the\
    \ subscriber).  The extent to which the relying party\n   should rely on that\
    \ statement by the CA, however, needs to be\n   assessed by the relying party\
    \ or entity controlling or coordinating\n   the way relying parties or relying\
    \ party applications use\n   certificates.  Different certificates are issued\
    \ following different\n   practices and procedures, and may be suitable for different\n\
    \   applications and/or purposes.\n   The X.509 standard defines a CP as \"a named\
    \ set of rules that\n   indicates the applicability of a certificate to a particular\n\
    \   community and/or class of application with common security\n   requirements\"\
    \ [ISO1].  An X.509 Version 3 certificate may identify a\n   specific applicable\
    \ CP, which may be used by a relying party to\n   decide whether or not to trust\
    \ a certificate, associated public key,\n   or any digital signatures verified\
    \ using the public key for a\n   particular purpose.\n   CPs typically fall into\
    \ two major categories.  First, some CPs\n   \"indicate the applicability of a\
    \ certificate to a particular\n   community\" [ISO1].  These CPs set forth requirements\
    \ for certificate\n   usage and requirements on members of a community.  For instance,\
    \ a CP\n   may focus on the needs of a geographical community, such as the ETSI\n\
    \   policy requirements for CAs issuing qualified certificates [ETS].\n   Also,\
    \ a CP of this kind may focus on the needs of a specific\n   vertical-market community,\
    \ such as financial services [IDT].\n   The second category of typical CPs \"\
    indicate the applicability of a\n   certificate to a . . . class of application\
    \ with common security\n   requirements.\"  These CPs identify a set of applications\
    \ or uses for\n   certificates and say that these applications or uses require\
    \ a\n   certain level of security.  They then set forth PKI requirements that\n\
    \   are appropriate for these applications or uses.  A CP within this\n   category\
    \ often makes sets requirements appropriate for a certain\n   \"level of assurance\"\
    \ provided by certificates, relative to\n   certificates issued pursuant to related\
    \ CPs.  These levels of\n   assurance may correspond to \"classes\" or \"types\"\
    \ of certificates.\n   For instance, the Government of Canada PKI Policy Management\n\
    \   Authority (GOC PMA) has established eight certificate policies in a\n   single\
    \ document [GOC], four policies for certificates used for\n   digital signatures\
    \ and four policies for certificates used for\n   confidentiality encryption.\
    \  For each of these applications, the\n   document establishes four levels of\
    \ assurances:  rudimentary, basic,\n   medium, and high.  The GOC PMA described\
    \ certain types of digital\n   signature and confidentiality uses in the document,\
    \ each with a\n   certain set of security requirements, and grouped them into\
    \ eight\n   categories.  The GOC PMA then established PKI requirements for each\n\
    \   of these categories, thereby creating eight types of certificates,\n   each\
    \ providing rudimentary, basic, medium, or high levels of\n   assurance.  The\
    \ progression from rudimentary to high levels\n   corresponds to increasing security\
    \ requirements and corresponding\n   increasing levels of assurance.\n   A CP\
    \ is represented in a certificate by a unique number called an\n   \"Object Identifier\"\
    \ (OID).  That OID, or at least an \"arc\", can be\n   registered.  An \"arc\"\
    \ is the beginning of the numerical sequence of\n   an OID and is assigned to\
    \ a particular organization.  The\n   registration process follows the procedures\
    \ specified in ISO/IEC and\n   ITU standards.  The party that registers the OID\
    \ or arc also can\n   publish the text of the CP, for examination by relying parties.\
    \  Any\n   one certificate will typically declare a single CP or, possibly, be\n\
    \   issued consistent with a small number of different policies.  Such\n   declaration\
    \ appears in the Certificate Policies extension of a X.509\n   Version 3 certificate.\
    \  When a CA places multiple CPs within a\n   certificate's Certificate Policies\
    \ extension, the CA is asserting\n   that the certificate is appropriate for use\
    \ in accordance with any of\n   the listed CPs.\n   CPs also constitute a basis\
    \ for an audit, accreditation, or another\n   assessment of a CA.  Each CA can\
    \ be assessed against one or more\n   certificate policies or CPSs that it is\
    \ recognized as implementing.\n   When one CA issues a CA-certificate for another\
    \ CA, the issuing CA\n   must assess the set of certificate policies for which\
    \ it trusts the\n   subject CA (such assessment may be based upon an assessment\
    \ with\n   respect to the certificate policies involved).  The assessed set of\n\
    \   certificate policies is then indicated by the issuing CA in the CA-\n   certificate.\
    \  The X.509 certification path processing logic employs\n   these CP indications\
    \ in its well-defined trust model.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Certificate Policy Examples\n   For example purposes, suppose that the\
    \ International Air Transport\n   Association (IATA) undertakes to define some\
    \ certificate policies for\n   use throughout the airline industry, in a PKI operated\
    \ by IATA in\n   combination with PKIs operated by individual airlines.  Two CPs\
    \ might\n   be defined - the IATA General-Purpose CP, and the IATA Commercial-\n\
    \   Grade CP.\n   The IATA General-Purpose CP could be used by industry personnel\
    \ for\n   protecting routine information (e.g., casual electronic mail) and for\n\
    \   authenticating connections from World Wide Web browsers to servers\n   for\
    \ general information retrieval purposes. The key pairs may be\n   generated,\
    \ stored, and managed using low-cost, software-based\n   systems, such as commercial\
    \ browsers.  Under this policy, a\n   certificate may be automatically issued\
    \ to anybody listed as an\n   employee in the corporate directory of IATA or any\
    \ member airline who\n   submits a signed certificate request form to a network\
    \ administrator\n   in his or her organization.\n   The IATA Commercial-Grade\
    \ CP could be used to protect financial\n   transactions or binding contractual\
    \ exchanges between airlines.\n   Under this policy, IATA could require that certified\
    \ key pairs be\n   generated and stored in approved cryptographic hardware tokens.\n\
    \   Certificates and tokens could be provided to airline employees with\n   disbursement\
    \ authority.  These authorized individuals might then be\n   required to present\
    \ themselves to the corporate security office, show\n   a valid identification\
    \ badge, and sign a subscriber agreement\n   requiring them to protect the token\
    \ and use it only for authorized\n   purposes, as a condition of being issued\
    \ a token and a certificate.\n"

    \   *  Policy Mappings extension; and\n   *  Policy Constraints extension.\n"
- title: 3.3.1.  Certificate Policies Extension
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Certificate Policies Extension\n   A Certificate Policies field lists\
    \ CPs that the certification\n   authority declares are applicable.  Using the\
    \ example of the IATA\n   General-Purpose and Commercial-Grade policies defined\
    \ in Section 3.2,\n   the certificates issued to regular airline employees would\
    \ contain\n   the object identifier for General-Purpose policy.  The certificates\n\
    \   issued to the employees with disbursement authority would contain the\n  \
    \ object identifiers for both the General-Purpose policy and the\n   Commercial-Grade\
    \ policy.  The inclusion of both object identifiers in\n   the certificates means\
    \ that they would be appropriate for either the\n   General-Purpose or Commercial-Grade\
    \ policies.  The Certificate\n   Policies field may also optionally convey qualifier\
    \ values for each\n   identified policy; the use of qualifiers is discussed in\
    \ Section 3.4.\n   When processing a certification path, a CP that is acceptable\
    \ to the\n   relying party application must be present in every certificate in\
    \ the\n   path, i.e., in CA-certificates as well as end entity certificates.\n\
    \   If the Certificate Policies field is flagged critical, it serves the\n   same\
    \ purpose as described above but also has an additional role.\n   Specifically,\
    \ it indicates that the use of the certificate is\n   restricted to one of the\
    \ identified policies, i.e., the certification\n   authority is declaring that\
    \ the certificate must only be used in\n   accordance with the provisions of at\
    \ least one of the listed CPs.\n   This field is intended to protect the certification\
    \ authority against\n   claims for damages asserted by a relying party who has\
    \ used the\n   certificate for an inappropriate purpose or in an inappropriate\n\
    \   manner, as stipulated in the applicable CP.\n   For example, the Internal\
    \ Revenue Service might issue certificates to\n   taxpayers for the purpose of\
    \ protecting tax filings.  The Internal\n   Revenue Service understands and can\
    \ accommodate the risks of\n   erroneously issuing a bad certificate, e.g., to\
    \ an imposter.\n   Suppose, however, that someone used an Internal Revenue Service\
    \ tax-\n   filing certificate as the basis for encrypting multi-million-dollar-\n\
    \   value proprietary trade secrets, which subsequently fell into the\n   wrong\
    \ hands because of a cryptanalytic attack by an attacker who is\n   able to decrypt\
    \ the message.  The Internal Revenue Service may want\n   to defend itself against\
    \ claims for damages in such circumstances by\n   pointing to the criticality\
    \ of the Certificate Policies extension to\n   show that the subscriber and relying\
    \ party misused the certificate.\n   The critical-flagged Certificate Policies\
    \ extension is intended to\n   mitigate the risk to the CA in such situations.\n"
- title: 3.3.2.  Policy Mappings Extension
  contents:
  - "3.3.2.  Policy Mappings Extension\n   The Policy Mappings extension may only\
    \ be used in CA-certificates.\n   This field allows a certification authority\
    \ to indicate that certain\n   policies in its own domain can be considered equivalent\
    \ to certain\n   other policies in the subject certification authority's domain.\n\
    \   For example, suppose that for purposes of facilitating\n   interoperability,\
    \ the ACE Corporation establishes an agreement with\n   the ABC Corporation to\
    \ cross-certify the public keys of each others'\n   certification authorities\
    \ for the purposes of mutually securing their\n   respective business-to-business\
    \ exchanges.  Further, suppose that\n   both companies have pre-existing financial\
    \ transaction protection\n   policies called ace-e-commerce and abc-e-commerce,\
    \ respectively.  One\n   can see that simply generating cross-certificates between\
    \ the two\n   domains will not provide the necessary interoperability, as the\
    \ two\n   companies' applications are configured with, and employee\n   certificates\
    \ are populated with, their respective certificate\n   policies.  One possible\
    \ solution is to reconfigure all of the\n   financial applications to require\
    \ either policy and to reissue all\n   the certificates with both policies appearing\
    \ in their Certificate\n   Policies extensions.  Another solution, which may be\
    \ easier to\n   administer, uses the Policy Mapping field.  If this field is included\n\
    \   in a cross-certificate for the ABC Corporation certification\n   authority\
    \ issued by the ACE Corporation certification authority, it\n   can provide a\
    \ statement that the ABC's financial transaction\n   protection policy (i.e.,\
    \ abc-e-commerce) can be considered equivalent\n   to that of the ACE Corporation\
    \ (i.e., ace-e-commerce).  With such a\n   statement included in the cross-certificate\
    \ issued to ABC, relying\n   party applications in the ACE domain requiring the\
    \ presence of the\n   object identifier for the ace-e-commerce CP can also accept,\
    \ process,\n   and rely upon certificates issued within the ABC domain containing\n\
    \   the object identifier for the abc-e-commerce CP.\n"
- title: 3.3.3.  Policy Constraints Extension
  contents:
  - "3.3.3.  Policy Constraints Extension\n   The Policy Constraints extension supports\
    \ two optional features.  The\n   first is the ability for a certification authority\
    \ to require that\n   explicit CP indications be present in all subsequent certificates\
    \ in\n   a certification path.  Certificates at the start of a certification\n\
    \   path may be considered by a relying party to be part of a trusted\n   domain,\
    \ i.e., certification authorities are trusted for all purposes\n   so no particular\
    \ CP is needed in the Certificate Policies extension.\n   Such certificates need\
    \ not contain explicit indications of CP.  When\n   a certification authority\
    \ in the trusted domain, however, certifies\n   outside the domain, it can activate\
    \ the requirement that a specific\n   CP's object identifier appear in subsequent\
    \ certificates in the\n   certification path.\n   The other optional feature in\
    \ the Policy Constraints field is the\n   ability for a certification authority\
    \ to disable policy mapping by\n   subsequent certification authorities in a certification\
    \ path.  It may\n   be prudent to disable policy mapping when certifying outside\
    \ the\n   domain.  This can assist in controlling risks due to transitive\n  \
    \ trust, e.g., a domain A trusts domain B, domain B trusts domain C,\n   but domain\
    \ A does not want to be forced to trust domain C.\n"
- title: 3.3.4.  Policy Qualifiers
  contents:
  - "3.3.4.  Policy Qualifiers\n   The Certificate Policies extension field has a\
    \ provision for\n   conveying, along with each CP identifier, additional policy-dependent\n\
    \   information in a qualifier field.  The X.509 standard does not\n   mandate\
    \ the purpose for which this field is to be used, nor does it\n   prescribe the\
    \ syntax for this field.  Policy qualifier types can be\n   registered by any\
    \ organization.\n   The following policy qualifier types are defined in PKIX RFC\
    \ 3280\n   [PKI1]:\n   (a) The CPS Pointer qualifier contains a pointer to a CPS,\
    \ CPS\n       Summary, RPA, or PDS published by the CA.  The pointer is in the\n\
    \       form of a uniform resource identifier (URI).\n   (b) The User Notice qualifier\
    \ contains a text string that is to be\n       displayed to subscribers and relying\
    \ parties prior to the use of\n       the certificate.  The text string may be\
    \ an IA5String or a\n       BMPString - a subset of the ISO 100646-1 multiple\
    \ octet coded\n       character set.  A CA may invoke a procedure that requires\
    \ that\n       the relying party acknowledge that the applicable terms and\n \
    \      conditions have been disclosed and/or accepted.\n   Policy qualifiers can\
    \ be used to support the definition of generic,\n   or parameterized, CPs.  Provided\
    \ the base CP so provides, policy\n   qualifier types can be defined to convey,\
    \ on a per-certificate basis,\n   additional specific policy details that fill\
    \ in the generic\n   definition.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Certification Practice Statement
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Certification Practice Statement\n   The term certification practice statement\
    \ (CPS) is defined by the DSG\n   and PAG as:  \"A statement of the practices\
    \ which a certification\n   authority employs in issuing certificates.\" [ABA1,\
    \ ABA2]  As stated\n   above, a CPS establishes practices concerning lifecycle\
    \ services in\n   addition to issuance, such as certificate management (including\n\
    \   publication and archiving), revocation, and renewal or re-keying.  In\n  \
    \ the DSG, the ABA expands this definition with the following comments:\n   \"\
    A certification practice statement may take the form of a\n   declaration by the\
    \ certification authority of the details of its\n   trustworthy system and the\
    \ practices it employs in its operations and\n   in support of issuance of a certificate\
    \ . . . .\"  This form of CPS is\n   the most common type, and can vary in length\
    \ and level of detail.\n   Some PKIs may not have the need to create a thorough\
    \ and detailed\n   statement of practices.  For example, the CA may itself be\
    \ the\n   relying party and would already be aware of the nature and\n   trustworthiness\
    \ of its services.  In other cases, a PKI may provide\n   certificates providing\
    \ only a very low level of assurances where the\n   applications being secured\
    \ may pose only marginal risks if\n   compromised.  In these cases, an organization\
    \ establishing a PKI may\n   only want to write or have CAs use a subscriber agreement,\
    \ relying\n   party agreement, or agreement combining subscriber and relying party\n\
    \   terms, depending on the role of the different PKI participants.  In\n   such\
    \ a PKI, that agreement may serve as the only \"statement of\n   practices\" used\
    \ by one or more CAs within that PKI.  Consequently,\n   that agreement may also\
    \ be considered a CPS and can be entitled or\n   subtitled as such.\n   Likewise,\
    \ since a detailed CPS may contain sensitive details of its\n   system, a CA may\
    \ elect not to publish its entire CPS.  It may instead\n   opt to publish a CPS\
    \ Summary (or CPS Abstract).  The CPS Summary\n   would contain only those provisions\
    \ from the CPS that the CA\n   considers to be relevant to the participants in\
    \ the PKI (such as the\n   responsibilities of the parties or the stages of the\
    \ certificate\n   lifecycle).  A CPS Summary, however, would not contain those\n\
    \   sensitive provisions of the full CPS that might provide an attacker\n   with\
    \ useful information about the CA's operations.  Throughout this\n   document,\
    \ the use of \"CPS\" includes both a detailed CPS and a CPS\n   Summary (unless\
    \ otherwise specified).\n   CPSs do not automatically constitute contracts and\
    \ do not\n   automatically bind PKI participants as a contract would.  Where a\n\
    \   document serves the dual purpose of being a subscriber or relying\n   party\
    \ agreement and CPS, the document is intended to be a contract\n   and constitutes\
    \ a binding contract to the extent that a subscriber or\n   relying party agreement\
    \ would ordinarily be considered as such.  Most\n   CPSs, however, do not serve\
    \ such a dual purpose.  Therefore, in most\n   cases, a CPS's terms have a binding\
    \ effect as contract terms only if\n   a separate document creates a contractual\
    \ relationship between the\n   parties and that document incorporates part or\
    \ all of the CPS by\n   reference.  Further, if a particular PKI employs a CPS\
    \ Summary (as\n   opposed to the entire CPS), the CPS Summary could be incorporated\n\
    \   into any applicable subscriber or relying party agreement.\n   In the future,\
    \ a court or applicable statutory or regulatory law may\n   declare that a certificate\
    \ itself is a document that is capable of\n   creating a contractual relationship,\
    \ to the extent its mechanisms\n   designed for incorporation by reference (such\
    \ as the Certificate\n   Policies extension and its qualifiers) indicate that\
    \ terms of its use\n   appear in certain documents.  In the meantime, however,\
    \ some\n   subscriber agreements and relying party agreements may incorporate\
    \ a\n   CPS by reference and therefore make its terms binding on the parties\n\
    \   to such agreements.\n"

    \ for communicating minimum\n   operating guidelines that must be met by interoperating\
    \ PKIs.  Thus,\n   a CP generally applies to multiple CAs, multiple organizations,\
    \ or\n   multiple domains.  By contrast, a CPS applies only to a single CA or\n\
    \   single organization and is not generally a vehicle to facilitate\n   interoperation.\n\
    \   A CA with a single CPS may support multiple CPs (used for different\n   application\
    \ purposes and/or by different relying party communities).\n   Also, multiple\
    \ CAs, with non-identical CPSs, may support the same CP.\n   For example, the\
    \ Federal Government might define a government-wide CP\n   for handling confidential\
    \ human resources information.  The CP will\n   be a broad statement of the general\
    \ requirements for participants\n   within the Government's PKI, and an indication\
    \ of the types of\n   applications for which it is suitable for use.  Each department\
    \ or\n   agency wishing to operate a certification authority in this PKI may\n\
    \   be required to write its own certification practice statement to\n   support\
    \ this CP by explaining how it meets the requirements of the\n   CP.  At the same\
    \ time, a department's or agency's CPS may support\n   other certificate policies.\n\
    \   An additional difference between a CP and CPS concerns the level of\n   detail\
    \ of the provisions in each.  Although the level of detail may\n   vary among\
    \ CPSs, a CPS will generally be more detailed than a CP.  A\n   CPS provides a\
    \ detailed description of procedures and controls in\n   place to meet the CP\
    \ requirements, while a CP is more general.\n   The main differences between CPs\
    \ and CPSs can therefore be summarized\n   as follows:\n   (a) A PKI uses a CP\
    \ to establish requirements that state what\n       participants within it must\
    \ do.  A single CA or organization can\n       use a CPS to disclose how it meets\
    \ the requirements of a CP or\n       how it implements its practices and controls.\n\
    \   (b) A CP facilitates interoperation through cross-certification,\n       unilateral\
    \ certification, or other means.  Therefore, it is\n       intended to cover multiple\
    \ CAs.  By contrast, a CPS is a\n       statement of a single CA or organization.\
    \  Its purpose is not to\n       facilitate interoperation (since doing so is\
    \ the function of a\n       CP).\n   (c) A CPS is generally more detailed than\
    \ a CP and specifies how the\n       CA meets the requirements specified in the\
    \ one or more CPs under\n       which it issues certificates.\n   In addition\
    \ to populating the certificate policies extension with the\n   applicable CP\
    \ object identifier, a certification authority may\n   include, in certificates\
    \ it issues, a reference to its certification\n   practice statement.  A standard\
    \ way to do this, using a CP qualifier,\n   is described in Section 3.4.\n"

  - "3.6.  Relationship Among CPs, CPSs, Agreements, and Other Documents\n   CPs and\
    \ CPSs play a central role in documenting the requirements and\n   practices of\
    \ a PKI.  Nonetheless, they are not the only documents\n   relevant to a PKI.\
    \  For instance, subscriber agreements and relying\n   party agreements play a\
    \ critical role in allocating responsibilities\n   to subscribers and relying\
    \ parties relating to the use of\n   certificates and key pairs.  They establish\
    \ the terms and conditions\n   under which certificates are issued, managed, and\
    \ used.  The term\n   subscriber agreement is defined by the PAG as:  \"An agreement\
    \ between\n   a CA and a subscriber that establishes the right and obligations\
    \ of\n   the parties regarding the issuance and management of certificates.\"\n\
    \   [ABA2]  The PAG defines a relying party agreement as: \"An agreement\n   between\
    \ a certification authority and relying party that typically\n   establishes the\
    \ rights and obligations between those parties\n   regarding the verification\
    \ of digital signatures or other uses of\n   certificates.\" [ABA2]\n   As mentioned\
    \ in Section 3.5, a subscriber agreement, relying party\n   agreement, or an agreement\
    \ that combines subscriber and relying party\n   terms may also serve as a CPS.\
    \  In other PKIs, however, a subscriber\n   or relying party agreement may incorporate\
    \ some or all of the terms\n   of a CP or CPS by reference.  Yet other PKIs may\
    \ distill from a CP\n   and/or CPS the terms that are applicable to a subscriber\
    \ and place\n   such terms in a self-contained subscriber agreement, without\n\
    \   incorporating a CP or CPS by reference.  They may use the same method\n  \
    \ to distill relying party terms from a CP and/or CPS and place such\n   terms\
    \ in a self-contained relying party agreement.  Creating such\n   self-contained\
    \ agreements has the advantage of creating documents\n   that are easier for consumers\
    \ to review.  In some cases, subscribers\n   or relying parties may be deemed\
    \ to be \"consumers\" under applicable\n   law, who are subject to certain statutory\
    \ or regulatory protections.\n   Under the legal systems of civil law countries,\
    \ incorporating a CP or\n   CPS by reference may not be effective to bind consumers\
    \ to the terms\n   of an incorporated CP or CPS.\n   CPs and CPSs may be incorporated\
    \ by reference in other documents,\n   including:\n   *  Interoperability agreements\
    \ (including agreements between CAs for\n      cross-certification, unilateral\
    \ certification, or other forms of\n      interoperation),\n   *  Vendor agreements\
    \ (under which a PKI vendor agrees to meet\n      standards set forth in a CP\
    \ or CPS), or\n   *  A PDS.  See [ABA2]\n   A PDS serves a similar function to\
    \ a CPS Summary.  It is a relatively\n   short document containing only a subset\
    \ of critical details about a\n   PKI or CA.  It may differ from a CPS Summary,\
    \ however, in that its\n   purpose is to act as a summary of information about\
    \ the overall\n   nature of the PKI, as opposed to simply a condensed form of\
    \ the CPS.\n   Moreover, its purpose is to distill information about the PKI,\
    \ as\n   opposed to protecting security sensitive information contained in an\n\
    \   unpublished CPS, although a PDS could also serve that function.\n   Just as\
    \ writers may wish to refer to a CP or CPS or incorporate it by\n   reference\
    \ in an agreement or PDS, a CP or CPS may refer to other\n   documents when establishing\
    \ requirements or making disclosures.  For\n   instance, a CP may set requirements\
    \ for certificate content by\n   referring to an external document setting forth\
    \ a standard\n   certificate profile.  Referencing external documents permits\
    \ a CP or\n   CPS to impose detailed requirements or make detailed disclosures\n\
    \   without having to reprint lengthy provisions from other documents\n   within\
    \ the CP or CPS.  Moreover, referencing a document in a CP or\n   CPS is another\
    \ useful way of dividing disclosures between public\n   information and security\
    \ sensitive confidential information (in\n   addition to or as an alternative\
    \ to publishing a CPS Summary).  For\n   example, a PKI may want to publish a\
    \ CP or CPS, but maintain site\n   construction parameters for CA high security\
    \ zones as confidential\n   information.  In that case, the CP or CPS could reference\
    \ an external\n   manual or document containing the detailed site construction\n\
    \   parameters.\n   Documents that a PKI may wish to refer to in a CP or CPS include:\n\
    \   *  A security policy,\n   *  Training, operational, installation, and user\
    \ manuals (which may\n      contain operational requirements),\n   *  Standards\
    \ documents that apply to particular aspects of the PKI\n      (such as standards\
    \ specifying the level of protection offered by\n      any hardware tokens used\
    \ in the PKI or standards applicable to the\n      site construction),\n   * \
    \ Key management plans,\n   *  Human resource guides and employment manuals (which\
    \ may describe\n      some aspects of personnel security practices), and\n   *\
    \  E-mail policies (which may discuss subscriber and relying party\n      responsibilities,\
    \ as well as the implications of key management,\n      if applicable).  See [ABA2]\n"
- title: 3.7.  Set of Provisions
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Set of Provisions\n   A set of provisions is a collection of practice and/or\
    \ policy\n   statements, spanning a range of standard topics for use in expressing\n\
    \   a CP or CPS employing the approach described in this framework by\n   covering\
    \ the topic appearing in Section 5 below.  They are also\n   described in detail\
    \ in Section 4 below.\n   A CP can be expressed as a single set of provisions.\n\
    \   A CPS can be expressed as a single set of provisions with each\n   component\
    \ addressing the requirements of one or more certificate\n   policies, or, alternatively,\
    \ as an organized collection of sets of\n   provisions.  For example, a CPS could\
    \ be expressed as a combination\n   of the following:\n   (a) a list of certificate\
    \ policies supported by the CPS;\n   (b) for each CP in (a), a set of provisions\
    \ that contains statements\n       responding to that CP by filling in details\
    \ not stipulated in\n       that policy or expressly left to the discretion of\
    \ the CA (in its\n       CPS) ; such statements serve to state how this particular\
    \ CPS\n       implements the requirements of the particular CP; or\n   (c) a set\
    \ of provisions that contains statements regarding the\n       certification practices\
    \ on the CA, regardless of CP.\n   The statements provided in (b) and (c) may\
    \ augment or refine the\n   stipulations of the applicable CP, but generally must\
    \ not conflict\n   with any of the stipulations of such CP.  In certain cases,\
    \ however,\n   a policy authority may permit exceptions to the requirements in\
    \ a CP,\n   because certain compensating controls of the CA are disclosed in its\n\
    \   CPS that allow the CA to provide assurances that are equivalent to\n   the\
    \ assurances provided by CAs that are in full compliance with the\n   CP.\n  \
    \ This framework outlines the contents of a set of provisions, in terms\n   of\
    \ nine primary components, as follows:\n   1.  Introduction\n   2.  Publication\
    \ and Repository\n   3.  Identification and Authentication\n   4.  Certificate\
    \ Life-Cycle Operational Requirements\n   5.  Facilities, Management, and Operational\
    \ Controls\n   6.  Technical Security Controls\n   7.  Certificate, CRL, and OCSP\
    \ Profile\n   8.  Compliance audit\n   9.  Other Business and Legal Matters\n\
    \   PKIs can use this simple framework of nine primary components to\n   write\
    \ a simple CP or CPS.  Moreover, a CA can use this same framework\n   to write\
    \ a subscriber agreement, relying party agreement, or\n   agreement containing\
    \ subscriber and relying party terms.  If a CA\n   uses this simple framework\
    \ to construct an agreement, it can use\n   paragraph 1 as an introduction or\
    \ recitals, it can set forth the\n   responsibilities of the parties in paragraphs\
    \ 2-8, and it can use\n   paragraph 9 to cover the business and legal issues described\
    \ in more\n   detail, using the ordering of Section 4.9 below (such as\n   representations\
    \ and warranties, disclaimers, and liability\n   limitations).  The ordering of\
    \ topics in this simple framework and\n   the business and legal matters Section\
    \ 4.9 is the same as (or similar\n   to) the ordering of topics in a typical software\
    \ or other technology\n   agreement.  Therefore, a PKI can establish a set of\
    \ core documents\n   (with a CP, CPS, subscriber agreement, and relying party\
    \ agreement)\n   all having the same structure and ordering of topics, thereby\n\
    \   facilitating comparisons and mappings among these documents and among\n  \
    \ the corresponding documents of other PKIs.\n   This simple framework may also\
    \ be useful for agreements other than\n   subscriber agreements and relying party\
    \ agreements.  For instance, a\n   CA wishing to outsource certain services to\
    \ an RA or certificate\n   manufacturing authority (CMA) may find it useful to\
    \ use this\n   framework as a checklist to write a registration authority agreement\n\
    \   or outsourcing agreement.  Similarly, two CAs may wish to use this\n   simple\
    \ framework for the purpose of drafting a cross-certification,\n   unilateral\
    \ certification, or other interoperability agreement.\n   In short, the primary\
    \ components of the simple framework (specified\n   above) may meet the needs\
    \ of drafters of short CPs, CPSs, subscriber\n   agreements, and relying party\
    \ agreements.  Nonetheless, this\n   framework is extensible, and its coverage\
    \ of the nine components is\n   flexible enough to meet the needs of drafters\
    \ of comprehensive CPs\n   and CPSs.  Specifically, components appearing above\
    \ can be further\n   divided into subcomponents, and a subcomponent may comprise\
    \ multiple\n   elements.  Section 4 provides a more detailed description of the\n\
    \   contents of the above components, and their subcomponents.  Drafters\n   of\
    \ CPs and CPSs are permitted to add additional levels of\n   subcomponents below\
    \ the subcomponents described in Section 4 for the\n   purpose of meeting the\
    \ needs of the drafter's particular PKI.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Contents of a Set of Provisions\n   This section expands upon the contents\
    \ of the simple framework of\n   provisions, as introduced in Section 3.7.  The\
    \ topics identified in\n   this section are, consequently, candidate topics for\
    \ inclusion in a\n   detailed CP or CPS.\n   While many topics are identified,\
    \ it is not necessary for a CP or a\n   CPS to include a concrete statement for\
    \ every such topic.  Rather, a\n   particular CP or CPS may state \"no stipulation\"\
    \ for a component,\n   subcomponent, or element on which the particular CP or\
    \ CPS imposes no\n   requirements or makes no disclosure.  In this sense, the\
    \ list of\n   topics can be considered a checklist of topics for consideration\
    \ by\n   the CP or CPS writer.\n   It is recommended that each and every component\
    \ and subcomponent be\n   included in a CP or CPS, even if there is \"no stipulation\"\
    ; this will\n   indicate to the reader that a conscious decision was made to include\n\
    \   or exclude a provision concerning that topic.  This drafting style\n   protects\
    \ against inadvertent omission of a topic, while facilitating\n   comparison of\
    \ different certificate policies or CPSs, e.g., when\n   making policy mapping\
    \ decisions.\n   In a CP, it is possible to leave certain components, subcomponents,\n\
    \   and/or elements unspecified, and to stipulate that the required\n   information\
    \ will be indicated in a policy qualifier, or the document\n   to which a policy\
    \ qualifier points.  Such CPs can be considered\n   parameterized definitions.\
    \  The set of provisions should reference or\n   define the required policy qualifier\

  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  PKI Participants\n   This subcomponent describes the identity or types\
    \ of entities that\n   fill the roles of participants within a PKI, namely:\n\
    \   *  Certification authorities, i.e., the entities that issue\n      certificates.\
    \  A CA is the issuing CA with respect to the\n      certificates it issues and\
    \ is the subject CA with respect to the\n      CA certificate issued to it.  CAs\
    \ may be organized in a hierarchy\n      in which an organization's CA issues\
    \ certificates to CAs operated\n      by subordinate organizations, such as a\
    \ branch, division, or\n      department within a larger organization.\n   * \
    \ Registration authorities, i.e., the entities that establish\n      enrollment\
    \ procedures for end-user certificate applicants, perform\n      identification\
    \ and authentication of certificate applicants,\n      initiate or pass along\
    \ revocation requests for certificates, and\n      approve applications for renewal\
    \ or re-keying certificates on\n      behalf of a CA.  Subordinate organizations\
    \ within a larger\n      organization can act as RAs for the CA serving the entire\n\
    \      organization, but RAs may also be external to the CA.\n   *  Subscribers.\
    \  Examples of subscribers who receive certificates\n      from a CA include employees\
    \ of an organization with its own CA,\n      banking or brokerage customers, organizations\
    \ hosting e-commerce\n      sites, organizations participating in a business-to-business\n\
    \      exchange, and members of the public receiving certificates from a\n   \
    \   CA issuing certificates to the public at large.\n   *  Relying parties.  Examples\
    \ of relying parties include employees of\n      an organization having its own\
    \ CA who receive digitally signed e-\n      mails from other employees, persons\
    \ buying goods and services from\n      e-commerce sites, organizations participating\
    \ in a business-to-\n      business exchange who receive bids or orders from other\n\
    \      participating organizations, and individuals and organizations\n      doing\
    \ business with subscribers who have received their\n      certificates from a\
    \ CA issuing certificates to the public.\n      Relying parties may or may not\
    \ also be subscribers within a given\n      PKI.\n   *  Other participants, such\

    \   Starting with Section 9.3 of the framework, the ordering of topics is\n  \
    \ the same as or similar to the ordering of topics in a typical\n   software licensing\
    \ agreement or other technology agreement.\n   Consequently, this framework may\
    \ not only be used for CPs and CPSs,\n   but also associated PKI-related agreements,\
    \ especially subscriber\n   agreements, and relying party agreements.  This ordering\
    \ is intended\n   help lawyers review CPs, CPSs, and other documents adhering\
    \ to this\n   framework.\n   With respect to many of the legal subcomponents within\
    \ this\n   component, a CP or CPS drafter may choose to include in the document\n\
    \   terms and conditions that apply directly to subscribers or relying\n   parties.\
    \  For instance, a CP or CPS may set forth limitations of\n   liability that apply\
    \ to subscribers and relying parties.  The\n   inclusion of terms and conditions\
    \ is likely to be appropriate where\n   the CP or CPS is itself a contract or\
    \ part of a contract.\n   In other cases, however, the CP or CPS is not a contract\
    \ or part of a\n   contract; instead, it is configured so that its terms and conditions\n\
    \   are applied to the parties by separate documents, which may include\n   associated\
    \ agreements, such as subscriber or relying party\n   agreements.  In that event,\
    \ a CP drafter may write a CP so as to\n   require that certain legal terms and\
    \ conditions appear (or not\n   appear) in such associated agreements.  For example,\
    \ a CP might\n   include a subcomponent stating that a certain limitation of liability\n\
    \   term must appear in a CA's subscriber and relying party agreements.\n   Another\
    \ example is a CP that contains a subcomponent prohibiting the\n   use of a subscriber\
    \ or relying party agreement containing a\n   limitation upon CA liability inconsistent\
    \ with the provisions of the\n   CP.  A CPS drafter may use legal subcomponents\
    \ to disclose that\n   certain terms and conditions appear in associated subscriber,\
    \ relying\n   party, or other agreements in use by the CA.  A CPS might explain,\n\
    \   for instance, that the CA writing it uses an associated subscriber or\n  \

- title: 4.9.6.  Representations and Warranties
  contents:
  - "4.9.6.  Representations and Warranties\n   This subcomponent can include representations\
    \ and warranties of\n   various entities that are being made pursuant to the CP\
    \ or CPS.  For\n   example, a CPS that serves as a contract might contain a CA's\n\
    \   warranty that information contained in the certificate is accurate.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ a CPS might contain a less extensive warranty to the\n   effect that the information\
    \ in the certificate is true to the best of\n   the CA's knowledge after performing\
    \ certain identity authentication\n   procedures with due diligence.  This subcomponent\
    \ can also include\n   requirements that representations and warranties appear\
    \ in certain\n   agreements, such as subscriber or relying party agreements. \
    \ For\n   instance, a CP may contain a requirement that all CAs utilize a\n  \
    \ subscriber agreement, and that a subscriber agreement must contain a\n   warranty\
    \ by the CA that information in the certificate is accurate.\n   Participants\
    \ that may make representations and warranties include\n   CAs, RAs, subscribers,\

- title: 4.9.8.  Limitations of Liability
  contents:
  - "4.9.8.  Limitations of Liability\n   This subcomponent can include limitations\
    \ of liability in a CP or CPS\n   or limitations that appear or must appear in\
    \ an agreement associated\n   with the CP or CPS, such as a subscriber or relying\
    \ party agreement.\n   These limitations may fall into one of two categories:\
    \  limitations\n   on the elements of damages recoverable and limitations on the\
    \ amount\n   of damages recoverable, also known as liability caps.  Often,\n \
    \  contracts contain clauses preventing the recovery of elements of\n   damages\
    \ such as incidental and consequential damages, and sometimes\n   punitive damages.\
    \  Frequently, contracts contain clauses that limit\n   the possible recovery\
    \ of one party or the other to an amount certain\n   or to an amount corresponding\
    \ to a benchmark, such as the amount a\n   vendor was paid under the contract.\n"
- title: 4.9.9.  Indemnities
  contents:
  - "4.9.9.  Indemnities\n   This subcomponent includes provisions by which one party\
    \ makes a\n   second party whole for losses or damage incurred by the second party,\n\
    \   typically arising out of the first party's conduct.  They may appear\n   in\
    \ a CP, CPS, or agreement.  For example, a CP may require that\n   subscriber\
    \ agreements contain a term under which a subscriber is\n   responsible for indemnifying\
    \ a CA for losses the CA sustains arising\n   out of a subscriber's fraudulent\
    \ misrepresentations on the\n   certificate application under which the CA issued\
    \ the subscriber an\n   inaccurate certificate.   Similarly, a CPS may say that\
    \ a CA uses a\n   relying party agreement, under which relying parties are responsible\n\
    \   for indemnifying a CA for losses the CA sustains arising out of use\n   of\
    \ a certificate without properly checking revocation information or\n   use of\
    \ a certificate for purposes beyond what the CA permits.\n"
- title: 4.9.10.  Term and Termination
  contents:
  - "4.9.10.  Term and Termination\n   This subcomponent can include the time period\
    \ in which a CP or a CPS\n   remains in force and the circumstances under which\
    \ the document,\n   portions of the document, or its applicability to a particular\n\
    \   participant can be terminated.  In addition or alternatively, the CP\n   or\
    \ CPS may include requirements that certain term and termination\n   clauses appear\
    \ in agreements, such as subscriber or relying party\n   agreements.  In particular,\
    \ such terms can include:\n   *  The term of a document or agreement, that is,\
    \ when the document\n      becomes effective and when it expires if it is not\
    \ terminated\n      earlier.\n   *  Termination provisions stating circumstances\
    \ under which the\n      document, certain portions of it, or its application\
    \ to a\n      particular participant ceases to remain in effect.\n   *  Any consequences\
    \ of termination of the document.  For example,\n      certain provisions of an\
    \ agreement may survive its termination and\n      remain in force.  Examples\
    \ include acknowledgements of\n      intellectual property rights and confidentiality\
    \ provisions.\n      Also, termination may trigger a responsibility of parties\

    \ discusses the way in which one participant can or\n   must communicate with\
    \ another participant on a one-to-one basis in\n   order for such communications\
    \ to be legally effective.  For example,\n   an RA may wish to inform the CA that\
    \ it wishes to terminate its\n   agreement with the CA.  This subcomponent is\
    \ different from\n   publication and repository functions, because unlike individual\n\
    \   communications described in this subcomponent, publication and\n   posting\

  contents:
  - "4.9.12.  Amendments\n   It will occasionally be necessary to amend a CP or CPS.\

    \ or\n   its implementation provides, and will be judged by the policy\n   administrator\
    \ to have an insignificant effect on the acceptability of\n   certificates.  Such\
    \ changes to a CP or CPS need not require a change\n   in the CP OID or the CPS\
    \ pointer (URL).  On the other hand, some\n   changes to a specification will\
    \ materially change the acceptability\n   of certificates for specific purposes,\
    \ and these changes may require\n   corresponding changes to the CP OID or CPS\
    \ pointer qualifier (URL).\n   This subcomponent may also contain the following\
    \ information:\n   *  The procedures by which the CP or CPS and/or other documents\

  contents:
  - "4.9.16.  Miscellaneous Provisions\n   This subcomponent contains miscellaneous\
    \ provisions, sometimes called\n   \"boilerplate provisions,\" in contracts. The\
    \ clauses covered in this\n   subcomponent may appear in a CP, CPS, or agreements\
    \ and include:\n   *  An entire agreement clause, which typically identifies the\n\
    \      document or documents comprising the entire agreement between the\n   \
    \   parties and states that such agreements supersede all prior and\n      contemporaneous\
    \ written or oral understandings relating to the\n      same subject matter;\n\
    \   *  An assignment clause, which may act to limit the ability of a\n      party\
    \ in an agreement, assigning its rights under the agreement to\n      another\
    \ party (such as the right to receive a stream of payments\n      in the future)\
    \ or limiting the ability of a party to delegate its\n      obligations under\
    \ the agreement;\n   *  A severability clause, which sets forth the intentions\
    \ of the\n      parties in the event that a court or other tribunal determines\n\
    \      that a clause within an agreement is, for some reason, invalid or\n   \
    \   unenforceable, and whose purpose is frequently to prevent the\n      unenforceability\
    \ of one clause from causing the whole agreement to\n      be unenforceable; and\n\
    \   *  An enforcement clause, which may state that a party prevailing in\n   \
    \   any dispute arising out of an agreement is entitled to attorneys'\n      fees\
    \ as part of its recovery, or may state that a party's waiver\n      of one breach\
    \ of contract does not constitute a continuing waiver\n      or a future waiver\
    \ of other breaches of contract.\n   *  A force majeure clause, commonly used\
    \ to excuse the performance of\n      one or more parties to an agreement due\
    \ to an event outside the\n      reasonable control of the affected party or parties.\
    \  Typically,\n      the duration of the excused performance is commensurate with\
    \ the\n      duration of the delay caused by the event.  The clause may also\n\
    \      provide for the termination of the agreement under specified\n      circumstances\
    \ and conditions.  Events considered to constitute a\n      \"force majeure\"\
    \ may include so-called \"Acts of God,\" wars,\n      terrorism, strikes, natural\
    \ disasters, failures of suppliers or\n      vendors to perform, or failures of\
    \ the Internet or other\n      infrastructure.  Force majeure clauses should be\
    \ drafted so as to\n      be consistent with other portions of the framework and\
    \ applicable\n      service level agreements.  For instance, responsibilities\
    \ and\n      capabilities for business continuity and disaster recovery may\n\
    \      place some events within the reasonable control of the parties,\n     \
    \ such as an obligation to maintain backup electrical power in the\n      face\
    \ of power outages.\n"

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   According to X.509, a certificate policy (CP)\
    \ is \"a named set of\n   rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate\
    \ to a\n   particular community and/or class of applications with common\n   security\
    \ requirements.\"  A CP may be used by a relying party to help\n   in deciding\
    \ whether a certificate, and the binding therein, are\n   sufficiently trustworthy\
    \ and otherwise appropriate for a particular\n   application.\n   The degree to\
    \ which a relying party can trust the binding embodied in\n   a certificate depends\
    \ on several factors.  These factors can include\n   the practices followed by\
    \ the certification authority (CA) in\n   authenticating the subject; the CA's\
    \ operating policy, procedures,\n   and technical security controls, including\
    \ the scope of the\n   subscriber's responsibilities (for example, in protecting\
    \ the private\n   key), and the stated responsibilities and liability terms and\n\
    \   conditions of the CA (for example, warranties, disclaimers of\n   warranties,\
    \ and limitations of liability).\n   This document provides a framework to address\
    \ technical, procedural,\n   personnel, and physical security aspects of Certification\n\
    \   Authorities, Registration Authorities, repositories, subscribers, and\n  \
    \ relying party cryptographic modules, in order to ensure that the\n   certificate\
    \ generation, publication, renewal, re-key, usage, and\n   revocation is done\
    \ in a secure manner.  Specifically, Section 4.3\n   Identification and Authentication\
    \ (I&A); Section 4.4 Certificate\n   Life-Cycle Operational Requirements; Section\
    \ 4.5 Facility Management,\n   and Operational Controls; Section 4.6 Technical\
    \ Security Controls;\n   Section 4.7 Certificate CRL, and OCSP Profiles; and Section\
    \ 4.8\n   Compliance Audit and Other Assessment, are oriented towards ensuring\n\
    \   secure operation of the PKI entities such as CA, RA, repository,\n   subscriber\
    \ systems, and relying party systems.\n"

  - "7.  Comparison to RFC 2527\n   This framework represents an incremental improvement\
    \ over RFC 2527.\n   The new framework benefits from the experience gained in\
    \ the course\n   of deploying CP and CPS documents under RFC 2527.  Further, this\
    \ new\n   framework is based on coordination with the American Bar Association\n\
    \   Information Security Committee within the Section of Science and\n   Technology\
    \ Law.  The ISC wrote the PKI Assessment Guidelines [ABA2],\n   which embodies\
    \ a great deal of technical, business, and legal\n   experience in PKI operations.\
    \  In particular, representatives of the\n   ISC made changes to the framework\
    \ to better suite it to the legal\n   environment and make it more accessible\
    \ to lawyers.\n   >From a technical perspective, the changes to the RFC 2527 framework\n\
    \   were minimal and incremental, rather than revolutionary.  Sections\n   3-7\
    \ have largely been preserved, with modest reorganization and new\n   topics.\
    \  For example, the new framework includes a revision of\n   Section 4 of the\
    \ framework to include a full treatment of the\n   certificate life-cycle, the\
    \ addition of key escrow, key\n   encapsulation, and key recovery policies and\
    \ practices, and OCSP.\n   Section 2 audit functions now appear alone in Section\
    \ 8, and Section\n   2 focuses exclusively on repository functions.  The business\
    \ and\n   legal matters in RFC 2527's Section 2 now appear in a new Section 9.\n\
    \   From a legal perspective, the new Section 9 is useful because it\n   places\
    \ topics in the framework in an ordering that is similar to\n   software licensing\
    \ and other technology agreements and thus is\n   familiar to technology lawyers.\
    \  Moreover, the framework as a whole\n   can double as a framework for a subscriber,\
    \ relying party, or other\n   PKI-related agreement.  The changes are intended\
    \ to make legal review\n   of, and input into, CP and CPS documents more efficient.\
    \  Section 9\n   also adds new legal topics, such as the privacy of personal\n\
    \   information, liability terms, and duration of the effectiveness of\n   the\
    \ document.\n   Section 1 of the new framework is largely the same as RFC 2527,\n\
    \   although it increases coverage of PKI participants by breaking out\n   subscribers\
    \ from relying parties and adding a section for other\n   participants.  It changes\
    \ the \"applicability\" section to one covering\n   appropriate and prohibited\
    \ uses of certificates.  Also, it moves CPS\n   approval procedures from RFC 2527's\
    \ Section 8.3 into a collected\n   policy administration section.  Finally, Section\
    \ 1.6 adds a place to\n   list definitions and acronyms.\n   Section 2 of the\
    \ new framework is a reorganization of Section 2.6 of\n   the old framework. \
    \ Section 3 of the new framework is based on a\n   division of the old Section\
    \ 3.1 into two parts for naming and\n   identification and authentication issues.\
    \  It adds new issues, such\n   as the permissibility of pseudonyms and anonymity.\
    \  Old Section 4\n   topics on audit logging, record archives, key changeover,\
    \ compromise\n   and disaster recovery, and CA termination have moved to Section\
    \ 5.\n   The remaining Section 4 topics have been expanded and reorganized to\n\
    \   cover a complete certificate lifecycle.  New topics include items\n   implicit\
    \ in the RFC 2527 Section 4, but now explicit, such as\n   certificate application\
    \ processing, certificate modification, and the\n   end of subscription.\n   New\
    \ Sections 5.1 through 5.3 are almost identical to their\n   counterparts in RFC\
    \ 2527.  The remainder of the new Section 5 is the\n   topics moved from RFC 2527's\
    \ Section 4, in the order that they\n   appeared in Section 4.  Section 6 of the\
    \ new framework is almost the\n   same as the old Section 6, with some exceptions,\
    \ such as the\n   consolidation of old Section 6.8 (cryptographic module engineering\n\
    \   controls) into Section 6.2.1 (now called \"cryptographic module\n   standards\
    \ and controls\") and the addition of time-stamping in a new\n   Section 6.8.\
    \  Section 7 is almost identical to the old Section 7, the\n   major change being\
    \ the addition of a section covering OCSP profile.\n   Section 8 is almost identical\
    \ to RFC 2527's Section 2.7.\n   New Section 9 contains business and legal topics\
    \ that were covered in\n   RFC 2527's Section 2, including fees, financial responsibility,\n\
    \   confidentiality, and intellectual property.  It adds a section on the\n  \
    \ privacy of personal information, which has become a significant\n   policy issue.\
    \  The \"liability\" Section 2.2 in RFC 2527 now appears in\n   Sections 9.6 through\
    \ 9.9, covering representations and warranties,\n   disclaimers, limitations of\
    \ liability, and indemnities.  Section 9.10\n   adds a section concerning the\
    \ duration of the effectiveness of\n   documentation.  Section 9.12 collects terms\
    \ concerning the way in\n   which a document (CP, CPS, agreement, or other document)\
    \ may be\n   amended, formerly appearing in Section 8.1.  Section 9 includes\n\
    \   \"legal boilerplate\" topics, some of which were in the old Section 2.\n \
    \  Finally, Section 9.17 is a catch-all \"other provisions\" section where\n \
    \  drafters can place information that does not fit well into any other\n   section\
    \ of the framework.\n   The following matrix shows the sections in the old RFC\
    \ 2527 framework\n   and their successor sections in the new framework.\n   ORIGINAL\

  - "10.  Notes\n   1.  A paper copy of the ABA Digital Signature Guidelines can be\n\
    \       purchased from the ABA.  See http://www.abanet.com for ordering\n    \
    \   details.  The DSG may also be downloaded without charge from the\n       ABA\
    \ website at\n       http://www.abanet.org/scitech/ec/isc/digital_signature.html.\n\
    \   2.  A draft of the PKI Assessment Guidelines may be downloaded\n       without\
    \ charge from the ABA website at\n       http://www.abanet.org/scitech/ec/isc/pag/pag.html.\n\
    \   3.  The term \"meaningful\" means that the name form has commonly\n      \
    \ understood semantics to determine the identity of a person and/or\n       organization.\
    \  Directory names and RFC 822 names may be more or\n       less meaningful.\n\
    \   4.  The subject may not need to prove to the CA that the subject has\n   \
    \    possession of the private key corresponding to the public key\n       being\
    \ registered if the CA generates the subject's key pair on\n       the subject's\
    \ behalf.\n   5.  Examples of means to identify and authenticate individuals\n\
    \       include biometric means (such as thumb print, ten finger print,\n    \
    \   and scan of the face, palm, or retina), a driver's license, a\n       credit\
    \ card, a company badge, and a government badge.\n   6.  Certificate \"modification\"\
    \ does not refer to making a change to\n       an existing certificate, since\
    \ this would prevent the\n       verification of any digital signatures on the\
    \ certificate and\n       cause the certificate to be invalid.  Rather, the concept\
    \ of\n       \"modification\" refers to a situation where the information\n  \
    \     referred to in the certificate has changed or should be changed,\n     \
    \  and the CA issues a new certificate containing the modified\n       information.\
    \  One example is a subscriber that changes his or her\n       name, which would\
    \ necessitate the issuance of a new certificate\n       containing the new name.\n\
    \   7.  The n out of m rule allows a private key to be split in m parts.\n   \
    \    The m parts may be given to m different individuals.  Any n parts\n     \
    \  out of the m parts may be used to fully reconstitute the private\n       key,\
    \ but having any n-1 parts provides one with no information\n       about the\
    \ private key.\n   8.  A private key may be escrowed, backed up, or archived.\
    \  Each of\n       these functions has a different purpose.  Thus, a private key\
    \ may\n       go through any subset of these functions depending on the\n    \
    \   requirements.  The purpose of escrow is to allow a third party\n       (such\
    \ as an organization or government) to obtain the private key\n       without\
    \ the cooperation of the subscriber.  The purpose of back\n       up is to allow\
    \ the subscriber to reconstitute the key in case of\n       the destruction or\
    \ corruption of the key for business continuity\n       purposes.  The purpose\
    \ of archives is to provide for reuse of the\n       private key in the future,\
    \ e.g., use to decrypt a document.\n   9.  WebTrust refers to the \"WebTrust Program\
    \ for Certification\n       Authorities,\" from the American Institute of Certified\
    \ Public\n       Accountants, Inc., and the Canadian Institute of Chartered\n\
    \       Accountants.\n   10. See <http://www.aicpa.org>.\n   11. All or some of\
    \ the following items may be different for the\n       various types of entities,\
    \ i.e., CA, RA, and end entities.\n"
