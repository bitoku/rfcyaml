  - "1.  Introduction\n   Server virtualization has changed the Information Technology\
    \ (IT)\n   industry in terms of the efficiency, cost, and speed of providing new\n\
    \   applications and/or services such as cloud applications.  However,\n   traditional\
    \ data center (DC) networks have limits in supporting cloud\n   applications and\
    \ multi-tenant networks [RFC7364].  The goal of data\n   center Network Virtualization\
    \ over Layer 3 (NVO3) networks is to\n   decouple the communication among tenant\
    \ systems from DC physical\n   infrastructure networks and to allow one physical\
    \ network\n   infrastructure to:\n   o  carry many NVO3 virtual networks and isolate\
    \ the traffic of\n      different NVO3 virtual networks on a physical network.\n\
    \   o  provide independent address space in individual NVO3 virtual\n      network\
    \ such as Media Access Control (MAC) and IP.\n   o  Support flexible Virtual Machines\
    \ (VMs) and/or workload placement\n      including the ability to move them from\
    \ one server to another\n      without requiring VM address changes and physical\
    \ infrastructure\n      network configuration changes, and the ability to perform\
    \ a \"hot\n      move\" with no disruption to the live application running on\
    \ those\n      VMs.\n   These characteristics of NVO3 virtual networks (VNs) help\
    \ address the\n   issues that cloud applications face in data centers [RFC7364].\n\
    \   Hosts in one NVO3 VN may communicate with hosts in another NVO3 VN\n   that\
    \ is carried by the same physical network, or different physical\n   network,\
    \ via a gateway.  The use-case examples for the latter are as\n   follows:\n \
    \  1) DCs that migrate toward an NVO3 solution will be done in steps,\n      where\
    \ a portion of tenant systems in a VN are on virtualized\n      servers while\
    \ others exist on a LAN.\n   2) many DC applications serve Internet users who\
    \ are on different\n      physical networks;\n   3) some applications are CPU\
    \ bound, such as Big Data analytics, and\n      may not run on virtualized resources.\n\
    \   The inter-VN policies are usually enforced by the gateway.\n   This document\
    \ describes general NVO3 VN use cases that apply to\n   various data centers.\
    \  The use cases described here represent the DC\n   provider's interests and\
    \ vision for their cloud services.  The\n   document groups the use cases into\
    \ three categories from simple to\n   sophisticated in terms of implementation.\
    \  However, the\n   implementation details of these use cases are outside the\
    \ scope of\n   this document.  These three categories are described below:\n \
    \  o  Basic NVO3 VNs (Section 2).  All Tenant Systems (TSs) in the\n      network\
    \ are located within the same DC.  The individual networks\n      can be either\
    \ Layer 2 (L2) or Layer 3 (L3).  The number of NVO3\n      VNs in a DC is much\
    \ larger than the number that traditional VLAN-\n      based virtual networks\
    \ [IEEE802.1Q] can support.\n   o  A virtual network that spans across multiple\
    \ DCs and/or to\n      customer premises where NVO3 virtual networks are constructed\
    \ and\n      interconnect other virtual or physical networks outside the DC.\n\
    \      An enterprise customer may use a traditional carrier-grade VPN or\n   \
    \   an IPsec tunnel over the Internet to communicate with its systems\n      in\
    \ the DC.  This is described in Section 3.\n   o  DC applications or services\
    \ require an advanced network that\n      contains several NVO3 virtual networks\
    \ that are interconnected by\n      gateways.  Three scenarios are described in\
    \ Section 4:\n      (1) supporting multiple technologies;\n      (2) constructing\
    \ several virtual networks as a tenant network; and\n      (3) applying NVO3 to\
    \ a virtual Data Center (vDC).\n   The document uses the architecture reference\
    \ model defined in\n   [RFC7365] to describe the use cases.\n"

- title: 1.2.  NVO3 Background
  contents:
  - "1.2.  NVO3 Background\n   An NVO3 virtual network is in a DC that is implemented\
    \ based on the\n   NVO3 architecture [RFC8014].  This architecture is often referred\
    \ to\n   as an overlay architecture.  The traffic carried by an NVO3 virtual\n\
    \   network is encapsulated at a Network Virtualization Edge (NVE)\n   [RFC8014]\
    \ and carried by a tunnel to another NVE where the traffic is\n   decapsulated\
    \ and sent to a destination Tenant System (TS).  The NVO3\n   architecture decouples\
    \ NVO3 virtual networks from the DC physical\n   network configuration.  The architecture\
    \ uses common tunnels to carry\n   NVO3 traffic that belongs to multiple NVO3\
    \ virtual networks.\n   An NVO3 virtual network may be an L2 or L3 domain.  The\
    \ network\n   provides switching (L2) or routing (L3) capability to support host\n\
    \   (i.e., TS) communications.  An NVO3 virtual network may be required\n   to\
    \ carry unicast traffic and/or multicast or broadcast/unknown-\n   unicast (for\
    \ L2 only) traffic to/from TSs.  There are several ways to\n   transport NVO3\
    \ virtual network Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and\n   Multicast (BUM) traffic\
    \ [NVO3MCAST].\n   An NVO3 virtual network provides communications among TSs in\
    \ a DC.  A\n   TS can be a physical server/device or a VM on a server end-device\n\
    \   [RFC7365].\n"
- title: 2.  DC with a Large Number of Virtual Networks
  contents:
  - "2.  DC with a Large Number of Virtual Networks\n   A DC provider often uses NVO3\
    \ virtual networks for internal\n   applications where each application runs on\
    \ many VMs or physical\n   servers and the provider requires applications to be\
    \ segregated from\n   each other.  A DC may run a larger number of NVO3 virtual\
    \ networks to\n   support many applications concurrently, where a traditional\
    \ VLAN\n   solution based on IEEE 802.1Q is limited to 4094 VLANs.\n   Applications\
    \ running on VMs may require a different quantity of\n   computing resources,\
    \ which may result in a computing-resource\n   shortage on some servers and other\
    \ servers being nearly idle.  A\n   shortage of computing resources may impact\
    \ application performance.\n   DC operators desire VM or workload movement for\
    \ resource-usage\n   optimization.  VM dynamic placement and mobility results\
    \ in frequent\n   changes of the binding between a TS and an NVE.  The TS reachability\n\
    \   update mechanisms should take significantly less time than the\n   typical\
    \ retransmission Timeout window of a reliable transport\n   protocol such as TCP\
    \ and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP),\n   so that endpoints' transport\
    \ connections won't be impacted by a TS\n   becoming bound to a different NVE.\
    \  The capability of supporting many\n   TSs in a virtual network and many virtual\
    \ networks in a DC is\n   critical for an NVO3 solution.\n   When NVO3 virtual\
    \ networks segregate VMs belonging to different\n   applications, DC operators\
    \ can independently assign MAC and/or IP\n   address space to each virtual network.\
    \  This addressing is more\n   flexible than requiring all hosts in all NVO3 virtual\
    \ networks to\n   share one address space.  In contrast, typical use of IEEE 802.1Q\n\
    \   VLANs requires a single common MAC address space.\n"
- title: 3.  DC NVO3 Virtual Network and External Network Interconnection
  contents:
  - "3.  DC NVO3 Virtual Network and External Network Interconnection\n   Many customers\
    \ (enterprises or individuals) who utilize a DC\n   provider's compute and storage\
    \ resources to run their applications\n   need to access their systems hosted\
    \ in a DC through Internet or\n   Service Providers' Wide Area Networks (WAN).\
    \  A DC provider can\n   construct a NVO3 virtual network that provides connectivity\
    \ to all\n   the resources designated for a customer, and it allows the customer\n\
    \   to access the resources via a virtual GateWay (vGW).  WAN\n   connectivity\
    \ to the vGW can be provided by VPN technologies such as\n   IPsec VPNs [RFC4301]\
    \ and BGP/MPLS IP VPNs [RFC4364].\n   If a virtual network spans multiple DC sites,\
    \ one design using NVO3\n   is to allow the network to seamlessly span the sites\
    \ without DC\n   gateway routers' termination.  In this case, the tunnel between\
    \ a\n   pair of NVEs can be carried within other intermediate tunnels over\n \
    \  the Internet or other WANs, or an intra-DC tunnel and inter-DC\n   tunnel(s)\
    \ can be stitched together to form an end-to-end tunnel\n   between the pair of\
    \ NVEs that are in different DC sites.  Both cases\n   will form one NVO3 virtual\
    \ network across multiple DC sites.\n   Two use cases are described in the following\
    \ sections.\n"
- title: 3.1.  DC NVO3 Virtual Network Access via the Internet
  contents:
  - "3.1.  DC NVO3 Virtual Network Access via the Internet\n   A customer can connect\
    \ to an NVO3 virtual network via the Internet in\n   a secure way.  Figure 1 illustrates\
    \ an example of this case.  The\n   NVO3 virtual network has an instance at NVE1\
    \ and NVE2, and the two\n   NVEs are connected via an IP tunnel in the DC.  A\
    \ set of TSs are\n   attached to NVE1 on a server.  NVE2 resides on a DC Gateway\
    \ device.\n   NVE2 terminates the tunnel and uses the VN Identifier (VNID) on\
    \ the\n   packet to pass the packet to the corresponding vGW entity on the DC\n\
    \   GW (the vGW is the default gateway for the virtual network).  A\n   customer\
    \ can access their systems, i.e., TS1 or TSn, in the DC via\n   the Internet by\
    \ using an IPsec tunnel [RFC4301].  The IPsec tunnel is\n   configured between\
    \ the vGW and the customer gateway at the customer\n   site.  Either a static\
    \ route or Internal Border Gateway Protocol\n   (IBGP) may be used for prefix\
    \ advertisement.  The vGW provides IPsec\n   functionality such as authentication\
    \ scheme and encryption; IBGP\n   traffic is carried within the IPsec tunnel.\
    \  Some vGW features are\n   listed below:\n   o  The vGW maintains the TS/NVE\
    \ mappings and advertises the TS prefix\n      to the customer via static route\
    \ or IBGP.\n   o  Some vGW functions such as the firewall and load-balancer (LB)\
    \ can\n      be performed by locally attached network appliance devices.\n   o\
    \  If the NVO3 virtual network uses different address space than\n      external\
    \ users, then the vGW needs to provide the NAT function.\n   o  More than one\
    \ IPsec tunnel can be configured for redundancy.\n   o  The vGW can be implemented\
    \ on a server or VM.  In this case, IP\n      tunnels or IPsec tunnels can be\

- title: 3.2.  DC NVO3 Virtual Network and SP WAN VPN Interconnection
  contents:
  - "3.2.  DC NVO3 Virtual Network and SP WAN VPN Interconnection\n   In this case,\
    \ an enterprise customer wants to use a Service Provider\n   (SP) WAN VPN [RFC4364]\
    \ [RFC7432] to interconnect its sites with an\n   NVO3 virtual network in a DC\
    \ site.  The SP constructs a VPN for the\n   enterprise customer.  Each enterprise\
    \ site peers with an SP PE.  The\n   DC provider and VPN SP can build an NVO3\
    \ virtual network and a WAN\n   VPN independently, and then interconnect them\
    \ via a local link or a\n   tunnel between the DC GW and WAN PE devices.  The\
    \ control plane\n   interconnection options between the DC and WAN are described\
    \ in\n   [RFC4364].  Using the option \"a\" specified in [RFC4364] with VRF-LITE\n\
    \   [VRF-LITE], both ASBRs, i.e., DC GW and SP PE, maintain a\n   routing/forwarding\
    \ table (VRF).  Using the option \"b\" specified in\n   [RFC4364], the DC ASBR\
    \ and SP ASBR do not maintain the VRF table;\n   they only maintain the NVO3 virtual\
    \ network and VPN identifier\n   mappings, i.e., label mapping, and swap the label\
    \ on the packets in\n   the forwarding process.  Both option \"a\" and option\
    \ \"b\" allow the se\n   of NVO3 VNs and VPNs using their own identifiers, and\
    \ two identifiers\n   are mapped at the DC GW.  With the option \"c\" in [RFC4364],\
    \ the VN\n   and VPN use the same identifier and both ASBRs perform the tunnel\n\
    \   stitching, i.e., tunnel segment mapping.  Each option has pros and\n   cons\
    \ [RFC4364] and has been deployed in SP networks depending on the\n   application\
    \ requirements.  BGP is used in these options for route\n   distribution between\
    \ DCs and SP WANs.  Note that if the DC is the\n   SP's DC, the DC GW and SP PE\
    \ can be merged into one device that\n   performs the interworking of the VN and\
    \ VPN within an Autonomous\n   System.\n   These solutions allow the enterprise\
    \ networks to communicate with the\n   tenant systems attached to the NVO3 virtual\
    \ network in the DC without\n   interfering with the DC provider's underlying\
    \ physical networks and\n   other NVO3 virtual networks in the DC.  The enterprise\
    \ can use its\n   own address space in the NVO3 virtual network.  The DC provider\
    \ can\n   manage which VM and storage elements attach to the NVO3 virtual\n  \
    \ network.  The enterprise customer manages which applications run on\n   the\
    \ VMs without knowing the location of the VMs in the DC.  (See\n   Section 4 for\
    \ more information.)\n   Furthermore, in this use case, the DC operator can move\
    \ the VMs\n   assigned to the enterprise from one sever to another in the DC\n\
    \   without the enterprise customer being aware, i.e., with no impact on\n   the\
    \ enterprise's \"live\" applications.  Such advanced technologies\n   bring DC\
    \ providers great benefits in offering cloud services, but add\n   some requirements\
    \ for NVO3 [RFC7364] as well.\n"

    \ equipped with virtual switches, while others may not.  For the\n   servers equipped\

    \ and running different\n   applications.  For example, a three-tier zone design\
    \ has a front zone\n   (Web tier) with Web applications, a mid zone (application\
    \ tier) where\n   service applications such as credit payment or ticket booking\
    \ run,\n   and a back zone (database tier) with Data.  External users are only\n\
    \   able to communicate with the Web application in the front zone; the\n   back\
    \ zone can only receive traffic from the application zone.  In\n   this case,\
    \ communications between the zones must pass through one or\n   more security\
    \ functions in a physical DMZ zone.  Each zone can be\n   implemented by one NVO3\
    \ virtual network and the security functions in\n   DMZ zone can be used to between\
    \ two NVO3 virtual networks, i.e., two\n   zones.  If network functions (NFs),\
    \ especially the security functions\n   in the physical DMZ, can't process encapsulated\
    \ NVO3 traffic, the\n   NVO3 tunnels have to be terminated for the NF to perform\
    \ its\n   processing on the application traffic.\n"

  - "4.3.  Virtual Data Center (vDC)\n   An enterprise DC may deploy routers, switches,\
    \ and network appliance\n   devices to construct its internal network, DMZ, and\
    \ external network\n   access; it may have many servers and storage running various\n\
    \   applications.  With NVO3 technology, a DC provider can construct a\n   vDC\
    \ over its physical DC infrastructure and offer a vDC service to\n   enterprise\
    \ customers.  A vDC at the DC provider site provides the\n   same capability as\
    \ the physical DC at a customer site.  A customer\n   manages its own applications\
    \ running in its vDC.  A DC provider can\n   further offer different network service\
    \ functions to the customer.\n   The network service functions may include a firewall,\
    \ DNS, LB,\n   gateway, etc.\n   Figure 2 illustrates one such scenario at the\
    \ service-abstraction\n   level.  In this example, the vDC contains several L2\
    \ VNs (L2VNx,\n   L2VNy, L2VNz) to group the tenant systems together on a per-\n\
    \   application basis, and one L3 VN (L3VNa) for the internal routing.  A\n  \
    \ network firewall and gateway runs on a VM or server that connects to\n   L3VNa\
    \ and is used for inbound and outbound traffic processing.  An LB\n   is used\
    \ in L2VNx.  A VPN is also built between the gateway and\n   enterprise router.\
    \  An Enterprise customer runs Web/Mail/Voice\n   applications on VMs within the\
    \ vDC.  The users at the Enterprise site\n   access the applications running in\
    \ the vDC via the VPN; Internet\n   users access these applications via the gateway/firewall\
    \ at the DC\n   provider site.\n                Internet                    ^\

    \ View\n   The enterprise customer decides which applications should be\n   accessible\
    \ only via the intranet and which should be assessable via\n   both the intranet\
    \ and Internet, and it configures the proper security\n   policy and gateway function\
    \ at the firewall/gateway.  Furthermore, an\n   enterprise customer may want multi-zones\
    \ in a vDC (see Section 4.2)\n   for the security and/or the ability to set different\
    \ QoS levels for\n   the different applications.\n   The vDC use case requires\
    \ an NVO3 solution to provide DC operators\n   with an easy and quick way to create\
    \ an NVO3 virtual network and NVEs\n   for any vDC design, to allocate TSs and\
    \ assign TSs to the\n   corresponding NVO3 virtual network and to illustrate vDC\
    \ topology and\n   manage/configure individual elements in the vDC in a secure\
    \ way.\n"
- title: 5.  Summary
  contents:
  - "5.  Summary\n   This document describes some general NVO3 use cases in DCs. \
    \ The\n   combination of these cases will give operators the flexibility and\n\
    \   capability to design more sophisticated support for various cloud\n   applications.\n\
    \   DC services may vary, NVO3 virtual networks make it possible to scale\n  \
    \ a large number of virtual networks in a DC and ensure the network\n   infrastructure\
    \ not impacted by the number of VMs and dynamic workload\n   changes in a DC.\n\
    \   NVO3 uses tunnel techniques to deliver NVO3 traffic over DC physical\n   infrastructure\
    \ network.  A tunnel encapsulation protocol is\n   necessary.  An NVO3 tunnel\
    \ may, in turn, be tunneled over other\n   intermediate tunnels over the Internet\
    \ or other WANs.\n   An NVO3 virtual network in a DC may be accessed by external\
    \ users in\n   a secure way.  Many existing technologies can help achieve this.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Security is a concern.  DC operators need to\
    \ provide a tenant with a\n   secured virtual network, which means one tenant's\
    \ traffic is isolated\n   from other tenants' traffic and is not leaked to the\
    \ underlay\n   networks.  Tenants are vulnerable to observation and data\n   modification/injection\
    \ by the operator of the underlay and should\n   only use operators they trust.\
    \  DC operators also need to prevent a\n   tenant application attacking their\
    \ underlay DC networks; further,\n   they need to protect a tenant application\
    \ attacking another tenant\n   application via the DC infrastructure network.\
    \  For example, a tenant\n   application attempts to generate a large volume of\
    \ traffic to\n   overload the DC's underlying network.  This can be done by limiting\n\
    \   the bandwidth of such communications.\n"
