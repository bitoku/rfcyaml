  - "1. Abstract\n   When dealing with large amounts of users and many IMAP4 [RFC-2060]\n
    \  servers, it is often necessary to move users from one IMAP4 server to\n   another.
    \ For example, hardware failures or organizational changes\n   may dictate such
    a move.\n   Login referrals allow clients to transparently connect to an\n   alternate
    IMAP4 server, if their home IMAP4 server has changed.\n   A referral mechanism
    can provide efficiencies over the alternative\n   'proxy method', in which the
    local IMAP4 server contacts the remote\n   server on behalf of the client, and
    then transfers the data from the\n   remote server to itself, and then on to the
    client.  The referral\n   mechanism's direct client connection to the remote server
    is often a\n   more efficient use of bandwidth, and does not require the local\n
    \  server to impersonate the client when authenticating to the remote\n   server.\n"

    lines sent by the client and\n   server respectively.\n   A home server, is an
    IMAP4 server that contains the user's inbox.\n   A remote server is a server that

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\",

  - "3. Introduction and Overview\n   IMAP4 servers that support this extension MUST
    list the keyword\n   LOGIN-REFERRALS in their CAPABILITY response.  No client
    action is\n   needed to invoke the LOGIN-REFERRALS capability in a server.\n   A
    LOGIN-REFERRALS capable IMAP4 server SHOULD NOT return a referral\n   to a server
    that will return a referral. A client MUST NOT follow\n   more than 10 levels
    of referral without consulting the user.\n   A LOGIN-REFERRALS response code MUST
    contain as an argument a valid\n   IMAP server URL as defined in [IMAP-URL].\n
    \  A home server referral consists of either a tagged NO or OK, or an\n   untagged
    BYE response that contains a LOGIN-REFERRALS response code.\n   Example: A001
    NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/] Remote Server\n   NOTE: user;AUTH=*
    is specified as required by [IMAP-URL] to avoid a\n   client falling back to anonymous
    login.\n"

  - "4. Home Server Referrals\n   A home server referral may be returned in response
    to an AUTHENTICATE\n   or LOGIN command, or it may appear in the connection startup
    banner.\n   If a server returns a home server referral in a tagged NO response,\n
    \  that server does not contain any mailboxes that are accessible to the\n   user.
    \ If a server returns a home server referral in a tagged OK\n   response, it indicates
    that the user's personal mailboxes are\n   elsewhere, but the server contains
    public mailboxes which are\n   readable by the user.  After receiving a home server
    referral, the\n   client can not make any assumptions as to whether this was a\n
    \  permanent or temporary move of the user.\n"

    - "4.1.  LOGIN and AUTHENTICATE Referrals\n   An IMAP4 server MAY respond to a
      LOGIN or AUTHENTICATE command with a\n   home server referral if it wishes to
      direct the user to another IMAP4\n   server.\n   Example:  C: A001 LOGIN MIKE
      PASSWORD\n             S: A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://MIKE@SERVER2/] Specified
      user\n                     is invalid on this server. Try SERVER2.\n   Example:
      \ C: A001 LOGIN MATTHEW PASSWORD\n             S: A001 OK [REFERRAL IMAP://MATTHEW@SERVER2/]
      Specified\n                     user's personal mailboxes located on Server2,
      but\n                     public mailboxes are available.\n   Example:  C: A001
      AUTHENTICATE GSSAPI\n             <authentication exchange>\n             S:
      A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=GSSAPI@SERVER2/]\n                     Specified
      user is invalid on this server. Try\n                     SERVER2.\n"

      an untagged BYE and a REFERRAL\n   response code that contains an IMAP URL to
      a home server if it is not\n   willing to accept connections and wishes to direct
      the client to\n   another IMAP4 server.\n   Example:  S: * BYE [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/]
      Server not\n                  accepting connections.  Try SERVER2\n"

    \  Form (BNF) as described in [ABNF].\n   This amends the \"resp_text_code\" element
    of the IMAP4 grammar\n   described in [RFC-2060]\n   resp_text_code =/ \"REFERRAL\"
    SPACE <imapurl>\n      ; See [IMAP-URL] for definition of <imapurl>\n      ; See
    [RFC-2060] for base definition of resp_text_code\n"

  - "6. Security Considerations\n   The IMAP4 login referral mechanism makes use of
    IMAP URLs, and as\n   such, have the same security considerations as general internet
    URLs\n   [RFC-1738], and in particular IMAP URLs [IMAP-URL].\n   A server MUST
    NOT give a login referral if authentication for that\n   user fails. This is to
    avoid revealing information about the user's\n   account to an unauthorized user.\n
    \  With the LOGIN-REFERRALS capability, it is potentially easier to\n   write
    a rogue 'password catching' server that collects login data and\n   then refers
    the client to their actual IMAP4 server.  Although\n   referrals reduce the effort
    to write such a server, the referral\n   response makes detection of the intrusion
    easier.\n"
