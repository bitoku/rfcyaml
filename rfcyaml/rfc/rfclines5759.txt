Abstract This document specifies a base profile for X.509 v3 Certificates and X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for use with the United States National Security Agency's Suite B Cryptography.
The reader is assumed to have familiarity with RFC 5280,
"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile".
This document specifies a base profile for X.509 v3 Certificates and X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for use by applications that support the United States National Security Agency's Suite B Cryptography.
The reader is assumed to have familiarity with [RFC5280].
This Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile is a profile of RFC 5280.
MUST  level requirements of RFC 5280 apply throughout this profile and are generally not repeated here.
In cases where a MUST level requirement is repeated for emphasis, the text notes the requirement is "in adherence with [RFC5280]".
This profile contains changes that elevate some MAY level options in RFC 5280 to SHOULD level and MUST  level in this profile; this profile also contains changes that elevate some SHOULD level options in RFC 5280 to MUST level for this profile.
All options from RFC 5280 that are not listed in this profile remain at the requirement level of RFC 5280.
The reader is also assumed to have familiarity with [RFC5480], which specifies the syntax and semantics for the Subject Public Key Information field in certificates that support Elliptic Curve Cryptography and [RFC5758], which specifies algorithm identifiers for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The goal of this document is to define a base set of certificate and CRL formats to support interoperability among Suite B solutions.
Specific communities, such as the US National Security Systems, may define community profiles that further restrict certificate and CRL formats by mandating the presence of extensions that are optional in this base profile, defining new optional or critical extension types, or restricting the values and/or presence of fields within existing extensions.
However, communications between distinct communities MUST use the formats specified in this document when interoperability is desired.
(Applications may add additional non critical extensions to these formats but they MUST NOT assume that a remote peer will be able to process them.)
Every Suite B certificate MUST use the X.509 v3 format, and contain either:   An ECDSA capable signing key, using curve P 256 or P 384; or   An ECDH capable (Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman)
key establishment key, using curve P 256 or P 384.
Every Suite B certificate and CRL MUST be signed using ECDSA.
The signing Certification Authority's  (CA's) key MUST be on the curve P 256 or P 384 if the certificate contains a key on the curve P 256.
If the certificate contains a key on the curve P 384, the signing CA's key MUST be on the curve P 384.
Any certificate and CRL MUST be hashed using SHA 256 or SHA 384, matched to the size of the signing CA's key.
The primary OID structure for Suite B is as follows per [X9.62], [SEC2], [RFC5480], and [RFC5758].

Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile This Suite B certificate profile is a profile of [RFC5280].
The changes in the requirements from RFC 5280 are listed here.
Note that RFC 5280 has varying mandates for marking extensions as critical or non critical.
This profile changes some of those mandates for extensions that are included in Suite B certificates.
The two algorithm identifiers used by Suite B are: 1.2.840.10045.4.3.2 for ecdsa with SHA256 and 1.2.840.10045.4.3.3 for ecdsa with SHA384, as described in [RFC5758] AND [X9.62].
The parameters MUST be absent as per [RFC5758].
signatureValue ECDSA digital signature generation is described in [FIPS186 3].
An ECDSA signature value is comprised of two unsigned integers, denoted as r and s.  r and s MUST be represented as ASN.1 INTEGERs.
If the high order bit of the unsigned integer is a 1, an octet with the value 0x00 MUST be prepended to the binary representation before encoding it as an ASN.1 INTEGER.
Unsigned integers for the P 256 and P 384 curves can be a maximum of 32 and 48 bytes, respectively.
Therefore, converting each r and s to an ASN.1 INTEGER will result in a maximum of 33 bytes for the P 256 curve and 49 bytes for the P 384 curve.
The ECDSA signatureValue in an X.509 certificate is encoded as a BIT STRING value of a DER encoded SEQUENCE of the two INTEGERS.
As per [RFC5480], the structure, included for convenience, is as follows:
SEQUENCE { r  INTEGER, s  INTEGER }
For example, in a signature using P 256 and hex notation: r
3eb0af34 0456aef4 r represented as a DER encoded INTEGER: 022052e3 f7b727fb a9e8eddb
8661 s represented as a DER encoded INTEGER: 022100b8
Representation of SEQUENCE of r
45dc8661 022100b8 930438de 8d33bdab 12c3a2bd
Representation of resulting signatureValue: 03480030 45022052
979592a1 fd6576d1 734c3eb0 af340456 aef4 4.3.
, Version MUST be 3, which means the value MUST be set to 2.
SubjectPublicKeyInfo For ECDSA signing keys and ECDH key agreement keys, the algorithm ID, id ecPublicKey, MUST be used.
The parameters of the AlgorithmIdentifier in this field MUST use the namedCurve option.
The specifiedCurve and implicitCurve options described in [RFC5480] MUST NOT be used.
The namedCurve MUST be either the OID for secp256r1
(curve P 256) or secp384r1
The elliptic curve public key, ECPoint, SHALL be the OCTET STRING representation of an elliptic curve point following the conversion routine in section 2.2 of [RFC5480] and sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 of [SEC1].
Suite B implementations MAY use either the uncompressed form or the compressed form of the elliptic curve point [RFC5480].
For interoperability purposes, all relying parties MUST be prepared to process the uncompressed form.
The elliptic curve public key (an ECPoint that is an OCTET STRING) is mapped to a subjectPublicKey (a BIT STRING) as follows:  the most significant bit of the OCTET STRING becomes the most significant bit of the BIT STRING and the least significant bit of the OCTET STRING becomes the least significant bit of the BIT STRING [RFC5480].
An octet string representation of a P 256 uncompressed elliptic curve point: 046cc93a
A DER encoded bit string representation of the subject public key: 03420004

Certificate Extensions for Particular Types of Certificates
Different types of certificates in this profile have different required and recommended extensions.
Those are listed in this section.
Those extensions from RFC 5280 not explicitly listed in this profile remain at the requirement levels of RFC 5280.
Suite B Self Signed CA Certificates
In adherence with [RFC5280], self signed CA certificates in this profile MUST contain the subjectKeyIdentifier, keyUsage, and basicConstraints extensions.
The keyUsage extension MUST be marked as critical.
The keyCertSign and cRLSign bits MUST be set.
The digitalSignature and nonRepudiation bits MAY be set.
All other bits MUST NOT be set.
In adherence with [RFC5280], the basicConstraints extension MUST be marked as critical.
The cA boolean MUST be set to indicate that the subject is a CA and the
pathLenConstraint MUST NOT be present.
Certificates Non self signed CA Certificates in this profile
MUST contain the authorityKeyIdentifier, keyUsage, and basicConstraints extensions.
If there is a policy to be asserted, then the certificatePolicies extension MUST be included.
The keyUsage extension MUST be marked as critical.
The keyCertSign and CRLSign bits MUST be set.
The digitalSignature and nonRepudiation bits MAY be set.
All other bits MUST NOT be set.
In adherence with [RFC5280], the basicConstraints extension MUST be marked as critical.
The cA boolean MUST be set to indicate that the subject is a CA and the pathLenConstraint subfield is OPTIONAL.
If a policy is asserted, the certificatePolicies extension MUST be marked as non critical, MUST contain the OIDs for the applicable certificate policies and SHOULD NOT use the policyQualifiers option.
If a policy is not asserted, the certificatePolicies extension MUST be omitted.
Relying party applications conforming to this profile MUST be prepared to process the policyMappings, policyConstraints, and
inhibitAnyPolicy extensions, regardless of criticality, following the guidance in [RFC5280] when they appear in non self signed CA certificates.
Suite B End Entity Signature and Key Establishment Certificates
In adherence with [RFC5280], end entity certificates in this profile MUST contain the authorityKeyIdentifier and keyUsage extensions.
If there is a policy to be asserted, then the certificatePolicies extension MUST be included.
End entity certificates SHOULD contain the subjectKeyIdentifier extension.
The keyUsage extension MUST be marked as critical.
For end entity digital signature certificates, the keyUsage extension MUST be set for digitalSignature.
The nonRepudiation bit MAY be set.
All other bits in the keyUsage extension MUST NOT be set.
For end entity key establishment certificates, the keyUsage extension MUST BE set for keyAgreement.
The encipherOnly or decipherOnly bit MAY be set.
All other bits in the keyUsage extension MUST NOT be set.
If a policy is asserted, the certificatePolicies extension MUST be marked as non critical, MUST contain the OIDs for the applicable certificate policies and SHOULD NOT use the policyQualifiers option.
If a policy is not asserted, the certificatePolicies extension MUST be omitted.
Suite B CRL and CRL Extensions Profile This Suite B CRL profile is a profile of [RFC5280].
There are changes in the requirements from [RFC5280] for the signatures on CRLs of this profile.
The signatures on CRLs in this profile MUST follow the same rules from this profile that apply to signatures in the certificates, see section 4.
The security considerations in [RFC5280], [RFC5480], and [RFC5758] apply.
A single key pair SHOULD NOT be used for both signature and key establishment per [SP 800 57].
The Suite B algorithms provide significantly improved performance when compared to equivalent strength cryptography that does not employ elliptic curve cryptography.
Where performance has previously been an impediment, use of Suite B may permit employment of PKI based cryptographic security mechanisms.
This document makes extensive use of object identifiers to register public key types, elliptic curves, and algorithms.
Most of them are registered in the ANSI X9.62 arc with the exception of some of the curves, which are in the Certicom,
Inc. arc (these curves have been adopted by ANSI and NIST).
Extensions in certificates and CRLs are identified using the object identifiers defined in an arc delegated by IANA to the PKIX working group.
No further action by IANA is necessary for this document or any anticipated updates.
