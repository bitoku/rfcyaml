  - "Abstract\n   Voice messaging is traditionally addressed using telephone number\n
    \  addressing.  This document describes two techniques for routing voice\n   messages
    based on a telephone number.  The complete service uses the\n   Voice Profile
    for Internet Mail (VPIM) Directory service to lookup a\n   VPIM email address
    with a telephone number and confirm that the\n   address is both valid and associated
    with the intended recipient.\n   However, this service will take time to become
    widely deployed in the\n   near term.  This document also describes a basic send-and-pray\n
    \  service that routes and delivers messages using only the ENUM\n   telephone
    number resolution service and the existing DNS mail routing\n   facilities.\n"

  - "1.  Design Goals\n   This profile is intended to provide a range of functional\n
    \  capabilities for message routing based on one of two mechanisms.  The\n   most
    complete service should use the ENUM address resolution service\n   to determine
    the VPIM directory, and then use LDAP to retrieve the\n   VPIM-specific email
    address that will be used for message routing.\n   The more basic send-and-pray
    message service uses only the ENUM\n   service and MX records to route the message
    to the intended\n   recipient's domain.  The intelligence to further route the
    message to\n   the intended recipient is placed within the message routing system
    of\n   the recipient's domain.\n   The basic mechanism may be used even when there
    is a VPIM directory\n   service available.  The basic service is useful when LDAP
    queries are\n   not available, such as may be the case for disconnected mobile\n
    \  terminals or because of firewall or information security policies.\n   The
    basic mechanism should facilitate the routing of VPIM messages to\n   a suitable
    internal destination with a minimum of configuration.  It\n   is an important
    goal to avoid any content-processing to determine the\n   nature of the message
    and its internal destination.  At a minimum, it\n   should be possible to establish
    a simple mail forwarding rule that\n   sends all inbound VPIM messages to a designated
    system, while\n   facilitating the routing of FAX, SMS, or other telephone-addressed\n
    \  messages to other potentially different systems.\n   It is a goal that the
    mechanisms outlined in this document be\n   extensible for all store-and-forward,
    telephone-number addressed\n   messaging services.\n   It is a goal that the VPIM
    directory discovery and VPIM directory\n   query steps occur within the timing
    constraints for user interfaces\n   in PSTN networks.  95% of the time, that constraint
    can be a two-\n   second response.\n"

  - "2.  The Complete Service\n   For the complete VPIM message routing service, the
    sending client\n   SHOULD query the VPIM directory for the VPIM-specific email
    address.\n   The client SHOULD use the ENUM service to retrieve the identity of\n
    \  the VPIM Directory to query.  The client should then query that\n   server
    for the email address and any additional attributes desired.\n"

      in a resolver's database will\n         cause clients to resolve the E.164 into

      the ENUM protocol and\n   querying for the VPIMDIR service associated with the
      telephone number\n   of the recipient.\n   The DNS query name is created as
      described by [ENUM].  The telephone\n   number used for the directory location
      MAY contain additional sub-\n   address information as additional digits.\n

    mechanically\n   construct a valid VPIM-specific email address.  In the recipient's\n
    \  domain, the constructed address may be further routed using\n   intradomain
    mail routing techniques.\n   To facilitate a full range of intradomain routing
    options, the\n   constructed email address indicates that the message is a VPIM\n
    \  message.  For ease of processing in the recipient's intradomain mail\n   routing
    system, the indication that the message is a VPIM message\n   SHOULD be in the
    domain name portion.\n   Note that there is no assurance the constructed address
    is valid, nor\n   that the constructed address corresponds to the intended recipient.\n
    \  Because no capabilities information is provided about the recipient,\n   messages
    sent with this mechanism SHOULD be sent using only the media\n   and content types
    of the VPIM V2 profile.\n"

    - "4.2.  DNS-based Attacks\n   Both the complete and basic services rely upon
      the DNS to provide the\n   information necessary to validate a recipient or
      send a message.  The\n   message sender is a casual, unauthenticated use of
      the indicated\n   servers, and relies upon the DNS for accurate information.
      \ If the\n   DNS is compromised, an attacker can redirect messages by providing
      a\n   malicious email address or indicating a rogue directory with\n   malicious
      LDAP URL's.  Use of DNS Security protocols [DNSSEC]\n   substantially reduces
      the risk of a domain being hijacked.  If the\n   E.164 zone is secured with
      DNSSEC, then the attack is precluded if\n   the client can trust the key used
      to sign the zone.  DNS security\n   does not protect against the LDAP service
      being independently\n   compromised.  Further discussion on the risk to this
      LDAP service is\n   provided in [VPIMDIR].\n"
