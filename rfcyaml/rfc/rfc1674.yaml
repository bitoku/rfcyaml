    \   White Paper Solicitation\".  The statements in this paper are intended\n \

    \ Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) consortium of\n   service providers or any\
    \ of its constituent companies.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This is a draft of the requirements for IPng as envisioned by\n\
    \   representatives of the Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) consortium\n  \
    \ of service providers.  As the leading service providers for this\n   nascent\
    \ technology, which will provide the capability for mobility of\n   native mainstream\
    \ connectionless network layer-based applications it\n   is our intention to support\
    \ whatever form IPng takes.  However, there\n   are several requirements which\
    \ we feel IPng must meet.\n"
- title: Mobility
  contents:
  - "Mobility\n   Since we will offer mobile services, our primary requirement is\
    \ that\n   IPng not inhibit our support of mobility.  IPng must not impede\n \
    \  devices from being able to operate anywhere anytime.  Applications on\n   these\
    \ mobile devices must look and feel the same to the user\n   regardless of location.\
    \  NPDUs should be self-contained and not\n   disallow the redirection inherent\
    \ to our mobility solution, i.e.,\n   IPng must be connectionless.\n   Further,\
    \ since IPng provides an opportunity for design enhancements\n   above and beyond\
    \ IPv4, we propose that native support for mobility be\n   regarded as an explicit\
    \ IPng requirement.  Local area and wide area\n   wireless technology creates\
    \ new opportunities for both TCP/IP and the\n   Internet.  Although the capability\
    \ for mobility is orthogonal to the\n   wired or wireless nature of the data link\
    \ in use, the rapid\n   deployment wireless technology amplifies the requirement\
    \ for\n   topological flexibility.\n   As a by-product of mobility, the significance\
    \ of \"occasionally-\n   connected hosts\" increases.  The ability to accommodate\n\
    \   occasionally-connected hosts in IPng is a requirement.\n"
- title: Scale
  contents:
  - "Scale\n   In terms of scale, we envision some 20 to 40 million users by the\n\
    \   year 2007.  In this context a \"user\" can be anything from a vending\n  \
    \ machine to a \"road warrior\".  These numbers are for North America\n   alone.\
    \  Worldwide, we anticipate that IPng should be able to support\n   billions of\
    \ \"users\".  Of course, the sparseness of network address\n   assignments which\
    \ is necessary for subnetting, etc., dictates that\n   IPng should support at\
    \ least tens or hundreds of billions of\n   addresses.\n"
- title: Addressing
  contents:
  - "Addressing\n   In terms of addressing, we would expect addresses to be hierarchical.\n\
    \   In addition, a node with multiple links should require only a single\n   address\
    \ although more than one address should also be possible.  The\n   mapping of\
    \ names to addresses should be independent of location; an\n   address should\
    \ be an address, not a route.  Variable-length\n   addressing is also required\
    \ to ensure continued protocol (IPng)\n   extensibility.  Administration of address\
    \ assignments should be\n   distributed and not centralized as it is now.\n"
- title: Security
  contents:
  - "Security\n   IPng should also support security mechanisms which will grow\n \
    \  increasingly important on the proverbial \"information highway\" for\n   commercial\
    \ users.  Security services which may optionally be expected\n   from a Layer\
    \ 3 entity such as IPng include peer entity\n   authentication, data confidentiality,\
    \ traffic flow confidentiality,\n   data integrity and location confidentiality.\n"
- title: Accounting
  contents:
  - "Accounting\n   The ability to do accounting at Layer 3 is a requirement.  The\
    \ CDPD\n   specification can be used as a model of the type of accounting\n  \
    \ services that we need.\n"
- title: Route Selection
  contents:
  - "Route Selection\n   In the voice communications arena, \"equal access\" and choice\
    \ of an\n   \"interexchange carrier (IXC)\" are issues that must be addressed.\n\
    \   Similar requirements for data may also exist.\n   Source- and policy-based\
    \ routing for inter-domain traffic can address\n   this requirement.  IPng must\
    \ allow the selection of at least the\n   first transient network service provider\
    \ based on the source host.\n"
- title: Data Efficiency
  contents:
  - "Data Efficiency\n   The bandwidth of wide area wireless networks is a precious\
    \ resource,\n   the use of which must be optimized.  IPng must allow optimal use\
    \ of\n   the underlying Layer 2 medium.  Layer 3 Protocol Control Information\n\
    \   (PCI) should be as condensed as possible.  The protocol should be\n   optimized\
    \ for data efficiency.\n   Packet prioritization must also be supported by IPng\
    \ in order to\n   optimize the use of low speed networks.  This requirement includes\n\
    \   both class and grade of service definitions for flexibility.\n"
- title: Transition
  contents:
  - "Transition\n   The final requirement for IPng is that it must interoperate with\
    \ IP\n   for the foreseeable future.  Bridging mechanisms must be supported\n\
    \   and a strategy for the transition from IPv4 to IPng must be defined.\n   Use\
    \ of options fields, etc., are one mechanism to support the\n   requirement for\
    \ IPng protocols to support IP addresses and headers.\n"
