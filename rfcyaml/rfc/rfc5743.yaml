- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   From time to time the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)\
    \ [RFC2014]\n   will wish to publish a document in the Internet RFC series.  This\n\
    \   memo defines the steps required to publish a document in the IRTF RFC\n  \
    \ stream.  Document streams are described in Section 5 of [RFC4844].\n   Most\
    \ documents undergoing this process will come from IRTF Research\n   Groups and\
    \ it is expected that they will be published as\n   Informational or Experimental\
    \ RFCs by the RFC Editor.\n   The IRTF RFC stream provides an avenue for research\
    \ groups to publish\n   their findings with an IRTF label.  Pre-publication editorial\
    \ review\n   by the Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG) increases the\n  \
    \ readability of documents and ensures proper caveats (described in\n   Section\
    \ 2.1) are applied.\n   The IRTF RFC approval process may be summarized as:\n\
    \   o  The Research Group (RG) performs a thorough technical and\n      editorial\
    \ review of the document and agrees it should be\n      published.\n   o  The\
    \ Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG) reviews the document\n      and approves\
    \ it for publication.\n   o  The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) reviews\
    \ the\n      document to assure that there are no conflicts with current or\n\
    \      expected standardization activities.\n   o  The document is submitted to\
    \ the RFC Editor for publication.\n   This document has been updated based on\
    \ over a year of experience and\n   processing of roughly a dozen documents. \
    \ The IRTF concludes that\n   there has been sufficient experience to justify\
    \ that the benefits and\n   process are sound.\n"
- title: 2.  Approval Process
  contents:
  - "2.  Approval Process\n   The following sections describe the steps for IRTF-stream\
    \ document\n   review and publication process.  There are fundamentally two steps:\n\
    \   IRSG review and IESG review.  The document shepherd is responsible\n   for\
    \ making sure reviews are responded to and documented and that the\n   process\
    \ moves along.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Research Group Preparation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Research Group Preparation\n   If an IRTF Research Group desires to publish\
    \ a document as an IRTF\n   RFC, the process in this document must be followed.\
    \  First, the RG\n   must review the document for editorial and technical quality.\n\
    \   The following guidelines should be adhered to:\n   o  There must be a statement\
    \ in the abstract identifying it as the\n      product of the RG.\n   o  There\
    \ must be a paragraph near the beginning (for example, in the\n      introduction)\
    \ describing the level of support for publication.\n      Example text might read:\
    \ \"this document represents the consensus\n      of the FOOBAR RG\" or \"the\
    \ views in this document were considered\n      controversial by the FOOBAR RG\
    \ but the RG reached a consensus that\n      the document should still be published\"\
    .\n   o  The breadth of review the document has received must also be\n      noted.\
    \  For example, was this document read by all the active\n      research group\
    \ members, only three people, or folks who are not\n      \"in\" the RG but are\
    \ expert in the area?\n   o  It must also be very clear throughout the document\
    \ that it is not\n      an IETF product and is not a standard.\n   o  If an experimental\
    \ protocol is described, appropriate usage\n      caveats must be present.\n \
    \  o  If the protocol has been considered in an IETF working group in\n      the\
    \ past, this must be noted in the introduction as well.\n   o  There should be\
    \ citations and references to relevant research\n      publications.\n   The Research\
    \ Group identifies a document shepherd whose\n   responsibility is to track and\
    \ facilitate document progression\n   through RFC publication.  The shepherd should\
    \ be copied on all\n   correspondence relating to the document.\n"
- title: 2.2.  IRSG Review and Approval
  contents:
  - "2.2.  IRSG Review and Approval\n   The IRSG functions similar to an editorial\
    \ review board.  It is the\n   IRSG's responsibility to ensure high technical\
    \ and editorial quality.\n   The IRSG will review and approve all documents intended\
    \ for RFC\n   publication from the IRTF stream.\n   The purpose of the IRSG review\
    \ is to ensure consistent technical\n   clarity and editorial quality for IRTF\
    \ publications.  The IRSG review\n   is not a deep technical review (this should\
    \ take place within the\n   RG).  At least one IRSG member who is not a chair\
    \ of that research\n   group must review the document and the RG's editorial process.\n\
    \   IRSG reviewers should look for clear, cogent, and consistent writing.\n  \
    \ An important aspect of the review is to gain a critical reading from\n   reviewers\
    \ who are not subject matter experts and, in the process,\n   assure the document\
    \ will be accessible to those beyond the authoring\n   research group.  Also,\
    \ reviewers should assess whether sufficient\n   editorial and technical review\
    \ has been conducted within the RG and\n   the requirements of this process document\
    \ have been met, for example,\n   reviewers should evaluate whether the breadth\
    \ of review the document\n   has received is adequate for the material at hand.\
    \  Finally,\n   reviewers should check that appropriate citations to related research\n\
    \   literature have been made.\n   Reviews should be written to be public.  Review\
    \ comments should be\n   sent to the IRSG and RG mailing lists and entered into\
    \ the IRTF's\n   document tracker.  All IRSG review comments must be addressed.\n\
    \   However, the RG need not accept every comment.  It is the\n   responsibility\
    \ of the shepherd to understand the comments and ensure\n   that the RG considers\
    \ them, including adequate dialog between the\n   reviewer and the author and/or\
    \ RG.\n   Following resolution of the editorial review, the IRSG will make a\n\
    \   decision as to whether to approve the document for publication.  If\n   the\
    \ IRSG does not approve the document, it returns to the research\n   group with\
    \ feedback on what would need to be fixed for publication.\n   In rare cases,\
    \ the IRSG may determine that a document is not suitable\n   for publication as\
    \ an IRTF RFC.  (For example, members of the RG may\n   assert to the IRSG that\
    \ there was no RG consensus to publish the\n   document.)  Other publication streams\
    \ would still be available to\n   those authors.\n"
- title: 2.3.  IESG Review
  contents:
  - "2.3.  IESG Review\n   The IRTF Chair will then extend the Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering\n   Group (IESG) an opportunity to review the document according to\
    \ the\n   process and scope described in [RFC5742].  The scope of this review\n\
    \   is confined to that described in Section 4.2.3 of [RFC2026] for non-\n   IETF\
    \ documents, specifically it is \"to ensure that the non-standards\n   track Experimental\
    \ and Informational designations are not misused to\n   circumvent the Internet\
    \ Standards Process.\"\n   The IESG (via the IETF Secretariat) is expected to\
    \ provide the IRTF\n   chair and document shepherd with a response, normally within\
    \ four\n   weeks, as to whether publication of the draft is perceived to be at\n\
    \   odds with the Internet Standards Process.\n"
- title: 2.4.  RFC Editor Handling
  contents:
  - "2.4.  RFC Editor Handling\n   The IRTF Chair will then ask the RFC Editor to\
    \ publish the document,\n   after which it will be enqueued for publication.\n\
    \   The document enters the RFC Editor queue at the same priority as non-\n  \
    \ standard IETF-stream and IAB-stream documents.  The document shepherd\n   is\
    \ responsible for ensuring that the document authors are responsive\n   to the\
    \ RFC Editor and that the RFC editing process goes smoothly.\n   The AUTH48 review\
    \ stage of RFC publication is an area where the\n   shepherd may be of particular\
    \ assistance, ensuring a) authors respond\n   promptly in reviewing about-to-be-published\
    \ RFCs and b) authors don't\n   inject changes into the document at the last minute\
    \ which would not\n   be supported by the research group or other reviewers.\n\
    \   If not already present, the RFC Editor will insert labels and text\n   for\
    \ the \"Status of this Memo\" section that identify the document as\n   the product\
    \ of the IRTF.  The current text is defined in [RFC5741].\n"
- title: 3.  Rules for Submission and Use of Material
  contents:
  - "3.  Rules for Submission and Use of Material\n   The goals of the IRTF Stream\
    \ are based on a desire that research\n   within the IRTF have broad impact and\
    \ the publication rights should,\n   in general, not restrict republication (with\
    \ appropriate citations).\n   However, in uncommon cases, it may be desirable\
    \ to publish a document\n   that does not permit derivative works.  This section,\
    \ adapted from\n   [RFC5744], describes rules and procedures supporting these\
    \ goals.\n   See [RFC5744] for a discussion of the background and rationale for\n\
    \   the specific language.  (From a historical perspective, the goal has\n   been\
    \ to preserve the rights that IRTF authors have previously had\n   when publishing\
    \ documents as RFC Editor Independent Submissions.\n   [RFC5744] defines those\
    \ rights.)\n   IRTF Stream authors will submit their material as Internet-Drafts.\n\
    \   These drafts will be submitted to, and stored in, the IETF Internet-\n   Drafts\
    \ repository in the same fashion as IETF Internet-Drafts.\n   During Internet-Draft\
    \ submission, authors who intend to submit their\n   document for publication\
    \ in the IRTF Stream will grant rights as\n   described in [RFC5378].  To request\
    \ that the contribution be\n   published as an RFC that permits no derivative\
    \ works, an author may\n   use the form specified for use with RFC 5378.  The\
    \ IETF Trust will\n   indicate that, in cooperation with the IRTF, the Trust grants\
    \ to\n   readers and users of material from IRTF Stream RFCs the right to make\n\
    \   unlimited derivative works, unless the RFC specifies that no\n   derivative\
    \ works are permitted.  This will permit anyone to copy,\n   extract, modify,\
    \ or otherwise use material from IRTF Stream RFCs as\n   long as suitable attribution\
    \ is given.  Contributors of Internet-\n   Drafts intended for the IRTF Stream\
    \ will include suitable boilerplate\n   defined by the IETF Trust.  This boilerplate\
    \ shall indicate\n   compliance with RFC 5378 and shall explicitly indicate either\
    \ that no\n   derivative works can be based on the contribution, or, as is\n \
    \  preferred, that unlimited derivative works may be crafted from the\n   contribution.\
    \  It should be understood that the final publication\n   decision for the IRTF\
    \ Stream rests with the IRTF Chair.  Compliance\n   with these terms is not a\
    \ guarantee of publication.  In particular,\n   the IRTF Chair may question the\
    \ appropriateness of a \"no derivative\n   works\" restriction requested by an\
    \ author.  The appropriateness of\n   such usage must be negotiated among the\
    \ authors and the IRTF Chair.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Procedures Requested of the IETF Trust
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Procedures Requested of the IETF Trust\n   The IRTF requests that the IETF\
    \ Trust and its Trustees assist in\n   meeting the goals and procedures set forth\
    \ in this document.  The\n   Trustees are requested to publicly confirm their\
    \ willingness and\n   ability to accept responsibility for the Intellectual Property\
    \ Rights\n   for the IRTF Stream.  They are also requested to indicate their\n\
    \   willingness and intent to work according to the procedures and goals\n   defined\
    \ by the IRTF.  Specifically, the Trustees are asked to develop\n   the necessary\
    \ boilerplate to enable the suitable marking of documents\n   so that the IETF\
    \ Trust receives the rights as specified in RFC 5378.\n   These procedures need\
    \ to also allow documents to grant either no\n   rights to make derivative works,\
    \ or preferentially, the right to make\n   unlimited derivative works from the\
    \ documents.  It is left to the\n   Trust to specify exactly how this shall be\
    \ clearly indicated in each\n   document.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Patent and Trademark Rules for the IRTF Stream
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Patent and Trademark Rules for the IRTF Stream\n   As specified above,\
    \ contributors of documents for the IRTF stream are\n   expected to use the IETF\
    \ Internet-Draft process, complying therein\n   with the rules specified in the\
    \ latest version of BCP 9, whose\n   version at the time of writing was [RFC2026].\
    \  This includes the\n   disclosure of Patent and Trademark issues that are known,\
    \ or can be\n   reasonably expected to be known, to the contributor.  Disclosure\
    \ of\n   license terms for patents is also requested, as specified in the most\n\
    \   recent version of BCP 79.  The version of BCP 79 at the time of this\n   writing\
    \ was RFC 3979 [RFC3979], which is updated by [RFC4879].  The\n   IRTF Stream\
    \ has chosen to use the IETF's IPR disclosure mechanism,\n   www.ietf.org/ipr/,\
    \ for this purpose.  The IRTF would prefer that the\n   most liberal terms possible\
    \ be made available for specifications\n   published as IRTF Stream documents.\
    \  Terms that do not require fees\n   or licensing are preferable.  Non-discriminatory\
    \ terms are strongly\n   preferred over those which discriminate among users.\
    \  However,\n   although disclosure is required, there are no specific requirements\n\
    \   on the licensing terms for intellectual property related to IRTF\n   Stream\
    \ publication.\n"
