  - "2. Cable Television Industry Overview\n   Cable television networks and the Internet\
    \ are discovering each\n   other. It looks like a great match for a number of\
    \ reasons, the\n   available bandwidth being the primary driver. Nonetheless,\
    \ it seems\n   that the impact of the cable television industry in the deployment\
    \ of\n   broadband networks and services is still not fully appreciated. This\n\
    \   section will provide a quick (and simplified) overview of cable\n   television\
    \ networks, and explain the trends that are driving future\n   network architectures\
    \ and services.\n   Cable television networks  in the U.S. pass by approximately\
    \ 90\n   million homes, and have about 56 million subscribers, of a total of\n\
    \   about 94 million homes (U.S. TV CENSUS figures, 9/30/93). There are\n   more\
    \ than 11,000 headends, and the cable TV industry has installed\n   more than\
    \ 1,000,000 network-miles. Installation of optical fiber\n   proceeds at a brisk\
    \ pace, the fiber plant in the U.S. going from\n   13,000 miles in 1991 to 23,000\
    \ miles in 1992. Construction spending\n   by the cable industry in 1992 was estimated\
    \ to be about $2.4 billion,\n   of which $1.4 billion was for rebuilds and upgrades.\
    \ Cable industry\n   revenue from subscriber services in 1992 was estimated to\
    \ be more\n   than $21 billion, corresponding to an average subscriber rate of\n\
    \   about $30 per month (source:  Paul Kagan Associates, Inc.). These\n   figures\
    \ are based on \"conventional\" cable television services, and\n   are expected\
    \ to grow as the cable industry moves into new interactive\n   digital services\
    \ and telecommunications.\n   The cable industry's broadband integrated services\
    \ network\n   architecture is based on a hierarchical deployment of network\n\
    \   elements interconnected by broadband fiber optics and coaxial cable\n   links.\
    \ In a very simplified manner, the following is a view of this\n   architecture.\
    \ Starting at the home, a coaxial cable tree-and-branch\n   plant provides broadband\
    \ two-way access to the network.  The local\n   access coaxial cable plant is\
    \ aggregated at a fiber node, which marks\n   the point in the network where fiber\
    \ optics becomes the broadband\n   transmission medium. Current deployment is\
    \ for  approximately 500\n   homes passed by the coaxial cable plant for every\
    \ fiber node, with\n   variations (from as low as 100 to as many as 3000) that\
    \ depend on the\n   density of homes and the degree of penetration of broadband\
    \ services.\n   The multiple links from the fiber nodes reach the headend, which\
    \ is\n   where existing cable systems have installed equipment for\n   origination,\
    \ reception and distribution of television programming.\n   The headends are in\
    \ buildings that can accommodate weather protection\n   and powering facilities,\
    \ and hence represent the first natural place\n   into the network where complex\
    \ switching, routing and processing\n   equipment can be conveniently located.\
    \ Traffic from multiple headends\n   can be routed over fiber optics to regional\
    \ hub nodes deeper into the\n   network, where capital-intensive functions can\
    \ be shared in an\n   efficient way.\n   The cable networks are evolving quite\
    \ rapidly to become effective\n   two-way digital broadband networks. Cable networks\
    \ will continue to\n   be asymmetric,  and they will continue to deliver analog\
    \ video. But\n   digital capabilities are being installed very aggressively and\
    \ a\n   significant upstream bandwidth is rapidly being activated. The\n   deployment\
    \ of optical fiber deeper into the network is making the\n   shared coaxial plant\
    \ more effective in carrying broadband traffic in\n   both directions. For instance,\
    \ with fiber nodes down to where only\n   about 100 to 500 homes are passed by\
    \ the coaxial drops (down from\n   tens of thousands of homes passed in the past),\
    \ an upstream bandwidth\n   of several MHz represents a considerable capacity.\
    \ The recent\n   announcement by Continental Cablevision and PSI to provide Internet\n\
    \   access services is but one example of the many uses that these two-\n   way\
    \ broadband capabilities can provide.\n   The cable networks are also rapidly\
    \ evolving into regional networks.\n   The deployment of fiber optic trunking\
    \ facilities (many based on\n   SONET) will provide gigabit links that interconnect\
    \ regional hub\n   nodes in regional networks spanning multiple cable systems.\
    \ These\n   gigabit networks carry digitized video programming, but will also\n\
    \   carry voice (telephone) traffic, and, of course, data traffic. There\n   are\
    \ instances in various parts of the country where these regional\n   networks\
    \ have been in successful trials. And given that compressed\n   digital video\
    \ is the way to deliver future video programs (including\n   interactive video,\
    \ video on demand, and a whole menu of other\n   applications like computer supported\
    \ collaborative work, multiparty\n   remote games, home shopping, customized advertisement,\
    \ multimedia\n   information services, etc.), one can be guaranteed that gigabit\n\
    \   regional networks will be put in place at an accelerated pace.\n   The cable\
    \ networks are evolving to provide broadband networking\n   capabilities in support\
    \  of a complete suite of communication\n   services. The Orlando network being\
    \ built by Time Warner is an\n   example of a Full Service Network(TM) that provides\
    \ video, audio and\n   data services to the homes. For the trial, ATM is brought\
    \ to the\n   homes at DS3 rates, and it is expected to go up to OC-3 rates when\n\
    \   switch interfaces will be available. This trial in Orlando represents\n  \
    \ a peek into the way of future cable networks. The Full Service\n   Network uses\
    \ a \"set-top\" box in every home to provide the network\n   interface. This \"\
    set-top\" box, in addition to some specialized\n   modules for video processing,\
    \ is really a powerful computer in\n   disguise, with a computational power comparable\
    \ to high-end desktop\n   workstations. The conventional analog cable video channels\
    \ will be\n   available, but a significant part of the network's RF bandwidth\
    \ will\n   be devoted to digital services. There are broadband ATM switches in\n\
    \   the network (as well as 5E-type switches for telephony), and video\n   servers\
    \ that include all kinds of movies and information services. An\n   important\
    \ point to notice is that the architecture of future cable\n   networks maps directly\
    \ to the way networked computing has developed.\n   General purpose hosts (i.e.,\
    \ the set-top boxes)  are interconnected\n   through a broadband network to other\
    \ hosts and to servers.\n   The deployment of the future broadband information\
    \ superhighway will\n   require architectures for both the network infrastructure\
    \ and the\n   service support environment that truly integrate the numerous\n\
    \   applications that will be offered to the users. Applications will\n   cover\
    \ a very wide range of scenarios.  Entertainment video delivery\n   will evolve\
    \ from the current core services of the cable industry to\n   enhanced offerings\
    \ like interactive video, near-video-on-demand and\n   complete video-on-demand\
    \ functions. Communication services will\n   evolve from the current telephony\
    \ and low-speed data to include\n   interactive multimedia applications, information\
    \ access services,\n   distance learning, remote medical diagnostics and evaluations,\n\
    \   computer supported collaborative work,  multiparty remote games,\n   electronic\
    \ shopping, etc. In addition to the complexity and diversity\n   of the applications,\
    \ the future broadband information infrastructure\n   will combine a number of\
    \ different networks that will have to work in\n   a coherent manner. Not only\
    \ will the users be connected to different\n   regional networks, but the sources\
    \ of information - in the many forms\n   that they will take - will also belong\
    \ to different enterprises and\n   may be located in remote networks. It is important\
    \ to realize from\n   the start that the two most important attributes of the\
    \ architecture\n   for the future broadband information superhighway are integration\
    \ and\n   interoperability. The Internet community has important  expertise and\n\
    \   technology that could contribute to the definition and development of\n  \
    \ these future broadband networks.\n"
- title: 3. Engineering Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Engineering Considerations\n   The following comments represent expected requirements\
    \ of future\n   cable networks, based on the vision of an integrated broadband\n\
    \   network that will support a complete suite of interactive video,\n   voice\
    \ and data services.\n   3.1  Scaling\n      The current common wisdom is that\
    \ IPng should be able to deal with\n      10 to the 12th nodes. Given that there\
    \ are of the order of 10 to\n      the 8th households in the US, we estimate a\
    \ worldwide  number of\n      households of about 100 times as many, giving a\
    \ total of about 10\n      to the 10th global households. This number represents\
    \ about 1\n      percent of the 10 to the 12th nodes, which indicates that there\n\
    \      should be enough space left for business, educational, research,\n    \
    \  government, military and other nodes connected to the future\n      Internet.\n\
    \      One should be cautious, however, not to underestimate the\n      possibility\
    \ of multiple addresses that will be used at each node\n      to specify different\
    \ devices, processes, services, etc. For\n      instance, it is very likely that\
    \ more than one address will  be\n      used at each household for different devices\
    \ such as the\n      entertainment system (i.e., interactive multimedia \"next\n\
    \      generation\" television(s)), the data system (i.e., the home\n      personal\
    \ computer(s)), and other new terminal devices that will\n      emerge in the\
    \ future (such as networked games, PDAs, etc.).\n      Finally, the administration\
    \ of the address space is of importance.\n      If there are large blocks of assigned\
    \ but unused addresses, the\n      total number of available addresses will be\
    \ effectively reduced\n      from the 10 to the 12th nodes that have been originally\n\
    \      considered.\n   3.2  Timescale\n      The cable industry is already making\
    \ significant investments in\n      plant upgrades, and the current estimates\
    \ for the commercial\n      deployment indicate that by the year 1998 tens of\
    \ millions of\n      homes will be served by interactive and integrated cable\
    \ networks\n      and services. This implies that during 1994 various trials will\
    \ be\n      conducted and evaluated, and the choices of technologies and\n   \
    \   products will be well under way by the year 1995. That is to say,\n      critical\
    \ investment and technological decisions by many of the\n      cable operators,\
    \ and their partners, will be made over the next 12\n      to 24 months.\n   \
    \   These time estimates are tentative, of course, and subject to\n      variations\
    \ depending on economic, technical and public policy\n      factors. Nonetheless,\
    \ the definition of the IPng capabilities and\n      the availability of implementations\
    \ should not be delayed beyond\n      the next year, in order to meet the period\
    \ during which many of\n      the early technological choices for the future deployment\
    \ of cable\n      networks and services will be made. The full  development and\n\
    \      deployment of IPng will be, of course, a long period that will be\n   \
    \   projected beyond the next year. Availability of early\n      implementations\
    \ will allow experimentation in trials to validate\n      IPng choices and to\
    \ provide early buy-in from the developers of\n      networking products that\
    \ will support the planned roll out.\n      It is my opinion that the effective\
    \ support for high quality video\n      and audio streams is one of the critical\
    \ capabilities that should\n      be demonstrated by IPng in order to capture\
    \ the attention of\n      network operators and information providers of interactive\n\
    \      broadband services (e.g., cable television industry and partners).\n  \
    \    The currently accepted view is that IP is a great  networking\n      environment\
    \ for the control side of an interactive broadband\n      system. It is a challenge\
    \ for IPng to demonstrate that it can be\n      effective in transporting the\
    \ broadband video and audio data\n      streams, in addition to providing the\
    \ networking support for the\n      distributed control system.\n   3.3  Transition\
    \ and deployment\n      The transition from the current version to IPng has to\
    \ consider\n      two aspects: support for existing applications and availability\
    \ of\n      new capabilities. The delivery of digital video and audio programs\n\
    \      requires the capability to do broadcasting and selective\n      multicasting\
    \ efficiently. The interactive applications that the\n      future cable networks\
    \ will provide will be based on multimedia\n      information streams that will\
    \ have real-time constraints. That is\n      to say, both the end-to-end delays\
    \ and the jitter associated with\n      the delivery across the network have to\
    \ be bound. In addition, the\n      commercial nature of these large private investments\
    \ will require\n      enhanced network capabilities for routing choices, resource\n\
    \      allocation, quality of service controls, security, privacy, etc.\n    \
    \  Network management will be an increasingly important issue in the\n      future.\
    \ The extent to which the current IP fails to provide the\n      needed capabilities\
    \ will provide additional incentive for the\n      transition to occur, since\
    \ there will be no choice but to use IPng\n      in future applications.\n   \
    \   It is very important, however, to maintain backwards compatibility\n     \
    \ with the current IP. There is the obvious argument that the\n      installed\
    \ technological base developed around IP cannot be\n      neglected under any\
    \ reasonable evolution scenario. But in\n      addition, one has to keep in mind\
    \ that a global Internet will be\n      composed of many interconnected heterogeneous\
    \ networks, and that\n      not all subnetworks, or user communities, will provide\
    \ the full\n      suite of interactive multimedia services. Interworking between\n\
    \      IPng and IP will have to continue for a very long time in the\n      future.\n\
    \   3.4  Security\n      The security needed in future networks falls into two\
    \ general\n      categories: protection of the users and protection of the network\n\
    \      resources. The users of the future global Internet will include\n     \
    \ many communities that will likely expect a higher level of\n      security than\
    \ is currently available. These users include\n      business, government, research,\
    \ military, as well as private\n      subscribers. The protection of the users'\
    \ privacy is likely to\n      become a hot issue as new commercial services are\
    \ rolled out. The\n      possibility of illicitly monitoring traffic patterns\
    \ by looking at\n      the headers in IPng packets, for instance, could be disturbing\
    \ to\n      most users that subscribe to new information and entertainment\n \
    \     services.\n      The network operators and the information providers will\
    \ also\n      expect effective protection of their resources. One would expect\n\
    \      that most of the security will be dealt at higher levels than\n      IPng,\
    \ but some issues might have to be considered in defining IPng\n      as well.\
    \ One issue relates, again, to the possibility of illicitly\n      monitoring\
    \ addresses and traffic patterns by looking at the IPng\n      packet headers.\
    \ Another issue of importance will be the capability\n      of effective network\
    \ management under the presence of benign or\n      malicious bugs, especially\
    \ if both source routing and resource\n      reservation functionality is made\
    \ available.\n   3.5  Configuration, administration and operation\n      The operations\
    \ of these future integrated broadband networks will\n      indeed become more\
    \ difficult, and not only because the networks\n      themselves will be larger\
    \ and more complex, but also because of\n      the number and diversity of applications\
    \ running on or through the\n      networks. It is expected that most of the issues\
    \ that need to be\n      addressed for effective operations support systems will\
    \ belong to\n      higher layers than IPng, but some aspects should be considered\n\
    \      when defining IPng.\n      The area where IPng would have most impact would\
    \ be in the\n      interrelated issues of resource reservation, source routing\
    \ and\n      quality of service control. There will be tension to maintain high\n\
    \      quality of service and low network resource usage simultaneously,\n   \
    \   especially if the users can specify preferred routes through the\n      network.\
    \ Useful capabilities at the IPng level would enable the\n      network operator,\
    \ or the user, to effectively monitor and direct\n      traffic in order to meet\
    \ quality and cost parameters. Similarly,\n      it will be important to dynamically\
    \ reconfigure the connectivity\n      among end points or the location of specific\
    \ processes (e.g., to\n      support mobile computing terminals), and the design\
    \ of IPng should\n      either support, or at least not get in the way of, this\n\
    \      capability. Under normal conditions, one would expect that\n      resources\
    \ for the new routing will be established before the old\n      route is released\
    \ in order to minimize service interruption. In\n      cases where reconfiguration\
    \ is in response to abnormal (i.e.,\n      failure) conditions, then one would\
    \ expect longer interruptions in\n      the service, or even loss of service.\n\
    \      The need to support heterogeneous multiple administrative domains\n   \
    \   will also have important implications on the available addressing\n      schemes\
    \ that IPng should support. It will be both a technical and\n      a business\
    \ issue to have effective means to address nodes,\n      processes and users,\
    \ as well as choosing schemes based on fair and\n      open processes for allocation\
    \ and administration of the address\n      space.\n   3.6  Mobile hosts\n    \
    \  The proliferation of personal and mobile communication services is\n      a\
    \ well established trend by now. Similarly, mobile computing\n      devices are\
    \ being introduced to the market at an accelerated pace.\n      It would not be\
    \ wise to disregard the issue of host mobility when\n      evaluating proposals\
    \ for IPng.  Mobility will have impact on\n      network addressing and routing,\
    \ adaptive resource reservation,\n      security and privacy, among other issues.\n\
    \   3.7  Flows and resource reservation\n      The largest fraction of the future\
    \ broadband traffic will be due\n      to real-time voice and video streams. It\
    \ will be necessary to\n      provide performance bounds for bandwidth, jitter,\
    \ latency and loss\n      parameters, as well as synchronization between media\
    \ streams\n      related by an application in a given session. In addition, there\n\
    \      will be alternative network providers that will compete for the\n     \
    \ users and that will provide connectivity to a given choice of many\n      available\
    \ service providers. There is no question that IPng, if it\n      aims to be a\
    \ general protocol useful for interactive multimedia\n      applications, will\
    \ need to support some form of resource\n      reservation or flows.\n      Two\
    \ aspects are worth mentioning. First, the quality of service\n      parameters\
    \ are not known ahead of time, and hence the network will\n      have to include\
    \ flexible capabilities for defining these\n      parameters. For instance, MPEG-II\
    \ packetized video might have to\n      be described differently than G.721 PCM\
    \ packetized voice, although\n      both data streams represent real-time traffic\
    \ channels. In some\n      cases, it might be appropriate to provide soft guarantees\
    \ in the\n      quality parameters, whereas in other cases hard guarantees might\n\
    \      be required. The tradeoff between cost and quality could be an\n      important\
    \ capability of future IPng-based networks, but much work\n      needs to be advanced\
    \ on this.\n      A second important issue related to resource reservations is\
    \ the\n      need to deal with broken or lost end-to-end state information. In\n\
    \      traditional circuit-switched networks, a considerable effort is\n     \
    \ expended by the intelligence of the switching system to detect and\n      recover\
    \ resources that have been lost due to misallocation. Future\n      IPng networks\
    \ will provide resource reservation capabilities by\n      distributing the state\
    \ information of a given session in several\n      nodes of the network. A significant\
    \ effort will be needed to find\n      effective methods to maintain consistency\
    \ and recover from errors\n      in such a distributed environment. For example,\
    \ keep-alive\n      messages to each node where a queuing policy change has been\
    \ made\n      to establish the flow could be a strategy to make sure that\n  \
    \    network resources do not remain stuck in some corrupted session\n      state.\
    \ One should be careful, however, to assume that complex\n      distributed algorithms\
    \ can be made robust by using time-outs. This\n      is a problem that might require\
    \ innovation beyond the reuse of\n      existing solutions.\n      It should be\
    \ noted that some aspects of the requirements for\n      recoverability are less\
    \ stringent in this networking environment\n      than in traditional distributed\
    \ data processing systems. In most\n      cases it is not needed (or even desirable)\
    \ to recover the exact\n      session state after failures, but only to guarantee\
    \ that the\n      system returns to some safe state. The goal would be to guarantee\n\
    \      that no network resource is reserved that has not been correctly\n    \
    \  assigned to a valid session. The more stringent requirement of\n      returning\
    \ to old session state is not meaningful since the value\n      of a session disappears,\
    \ in most cases, as time progresses. One\n      should keep in mind, however,\
    \ that administrative and management\n      state, such as usage measurement,\
    \ is subject to the same\n      conventional requirements of recoverability that\
    \ database systems\n      currently offer.\n   3.8  Policy based routing\n   \
    \   In future broadband networks, there will be multiple network\n      operators\
    \ and information providers competing for customers and\n      network traffic.\
    \  An important capability of IPng will be to\n      specify, at the source, the\
    \ specific network for the traffic to\n      follow. The users will be able to\
    \ select specific networks that\n      provide performance, feature or cost advantages.\
    \ From the user's\n      perspective, source routing is a feature that would enable\
    \ a wider\n      selection of network access options, enhancing their ability\
    \ to\n      obtain features, performance or cost advantages. From the network\n\
    \      operator and service provider perspective, source routing would\n     \
    \ enable the offering of targeted bundled services that will cater\n      to specific\
    \ users and achieve some degree of customer lock-in. The\n      information providers\
    \ will be able to optimize the placement and\n      distribution of their servers,\
    \ based on either point-to-point\n      streams or on multicasting to selected\
    \ subgroups. The ability of\n      IPng to dynamically specify the network routing\
    \ would be an\n      attractive feature that will facilitate the flexible offering\
    \ of\n      network services.\n   3.9  Topological flexibility\n      It is hard\
    \ to predict what the topology of the future Internet\n      will be. The current\
    \ model developed in response to a specific set\n      of technological drivers,\
    \ as well as an open administrative\n      process reflecting the non-commercial\
    \ nature of the sector. The\n      future Internet will continue to integrate\
    \ multiple administrative\n      domains that will be deployed by a variety of\
    \ network operators.\n      It is likely that there will be more \"gateway\" nodes\
    \ (at the\n      headends or even at the fiber nodes, for instance) as local and\n\
    \      regional broadband networks will provide connectivity for their\n     \
    \ users to the global Internet.\n   3.10 Applicability\n      The future broadband\
    \ networks that will be deployed, by both the\n      cable industry and other\
    \ companies, will integrate a diversity of\n      applications. The strategies\
    \ of the cable industry are to reach\n      the homes, as well as schools, business,\
    \ government and other\n      campuses. The applications will focus on entertainment,\
    \ remote\n      education, telecommuting, medical, community services, news\n\
    \      delivery and the whole spectrum of future information networking\n    \
    \  services. The traffic carried by the broadband networks will be\n      dominated\
    \ by real-time video and audio streams, even though there\n      will also be\
    \ an important component of traffic associated with\n      non-time-critical services\
    \ such messaging, file transfers, remote\n      computing, etc. The value of IPng\
    \ will be measured as a general\n      internetworking technology for all these\
    \ classes of applications.\n      The future market for IPng could be much wider\
    \ and larger than the\n      current market for IP, provided that the capabilities\
    \ to support\n      these diverse interactive multimedia applications are available.\n\
    \      It is difficult to predict how pervasive the use of IPng and its\n    \
    \  related technologies might be in future broadband networks. There\n      will\
    \ be extensive deployment of distributed computing\n      capabilities, both for\
    \ the user applications and for the network\n      management and operation support\
    \ systems that will be required.\n      This is the area where IPng could find\
    \ a firm stronghold,\n      especially as it can leverage on the extensive IP\
    \ technology\n      available. The extension of IPng to support video and audio\
    \ real-\n      time applications, with the required performance, quality and cost\n\
    \      to be competitive, remains a question to be answered.\n   3.11 Datagram\
    \ service\n      The \"best-effort\", hop-by-hop paradigm of the existing IP service\n\
    \      will have to be reexamined if IPng is to provide capabilities for\n   \
    \   resource reservation or flows. The datagram paradigm could still\n      be\
    \ the basic service provided by IPng for many applications, but\n      careful\
    \ thought should be given to the need to support real-time\n      traffic with\
    \ (soft and/or hard) quality of service requirements.\n   3.12 Accounting\n  \
    \    The ability to do accounting should be an important consideration\n     \
    \ in the selection of IPng. The future broadband networks will be\n      commercially\
    \ motivated, and measurement of resource usage by the\n      various users will\
    \ be required. The actual billing may or may not\n      be based on session-by-session\
    \ usage, and accounting will have\n      many other useful purposes besides billing.\
    \ The efficient\n      operation of networks depends on maintaining availability\
    \ and\n      performance goals, including both on-line actions and long term\n\
    \      planning and design. Accounting information will be important on\n    \
    \  both scores. On the other hand, the choice of providing accounting\n      capabilities\
    \ at the IPng level should be examined with a general\n      criterion to introduce\
    \ as little overhead as possible. Since\n      fields for \"to\", \"from\" and\
    \ time stamp will be available for any\n      IPng choice, careful examination\
    \ of what other parameters in IPng\n      could be useful to both accounting and\
    \ other network functions so\n      as to keep IPng as lean as possible.\n   3.13\
    \ Support of communication media\n      The generality of IP should be carried\
    \ over to IPng. It would not\n      be an advantage to design a general internetworking\
    \ technology\n      that cannot be supported over as wide a class of communications\n\
    \      media as possible. It is reasonable to expect that IPng will start\n  \
    \    with support over a few select transport technologies, and rely on\n    \
    \  the backwards compatibility with IP to work through a transition\n      period.\
    \ Ultimately, however, one would expect IPng to be carried\n      over any available\
    \ communications medium.\n   3.14 Robustness and fault tolerance\n      Service\
    \ availability, end-to-end and at expected performance\n      levels, is the true\
    \ measure of robustness and fault-tolerance. In\n      this sense, IPng is but\
    \ one piece of a complex puzzle. There are,\n      however, some vulnerability\
    \ aspects of IPng that could decrease\n      robustness. One general class of\
    \ bugs will be associated with the\n      change itself, regardless of any possible\
    \ enhancement in\n      capabilities. The design, implementation and testing process\
    \ will\n      have to be managed very carefully. Networks and distributed\n  \
    \    systems are tricky. There are plenty of horror stories from the\n      Internet\
    \ community itself to make us cautious, not to mention the\n      brief but dramatic\
    \ outages over the last couple of years\n      associated with relatively small\
    \ software bugs in the control\n      networks (i.e., CCS/SS7 signaling) of the\
    \ telephone industry, both\n      local and long distance.\n      A second general\
    \ class of bugs will be associated with the\n      implementation of new capabilities.\
    \ IPng will likely support a\n      whole set of new functions, such as larger\
    \ (multiple?) address\n      space(s), source routing and flows, just to mention\
    \ a few.\n      Providing these new capabilities will require in most cases\n\
    \      designing new distributed algorithms and testing implementation\n     \
    \ parameters very carefully. In addition, the future Internet will\n      be even\
    \ larger, have more diverse applications and have higher\n      bandwidth. These\
    \ are all factors that could have a multiplying\n      effect on bugs that in\
    \ the current network might be easily\n      contained. The designers and implementers\
    \ of IPng should be\n      careful. It will be very important to provide the best\
    \ possible\n      transition process from IP to IPng. The need to maintain\n \
    \     robustness and fault-tolerance is paramount.\n   3.15 Technology pull\n\
    \      The strongest \"technology pull\" factors that will influence the\n   \
    \   Internet are the same that are dictating the accelerated pace of\n      the\
    \ cable, telephone and computer networking world. The following\n      is a partial\
    \ list: higher network bandwidth, more powerful CPUs,\n      larger and faster\
    \ (static and dynamic) memory, improved signal\n      processing and compression\
    \ methods, advanced distributed computing\n      technologies, open and extensible\
    \ network operating systems, large\n      distributed database management and\
    \ directory systems, high\n      performance and high capacity real-time servers,\
    \ friendly\n      graphical user interfaces, efficient application development\n\
    \      environments. These technology developments, coupled with the\n      current\
    \ aggressive business strategies in our industry and\n      favorable public policies,\
    \ are powerful forces that will clearly\n      have an impact on the evolution\
    \ and acceptance of IPng. The\n      current deployment strategies of the cable\
    \ industry and their\n      partners do not rely on the existence of commercial\
    \ IPng\n      capabilities, but the availability of new effective networking\n\
    \      technology could become a unifying force to facilitate the\n      interworking\
    \ of networks and services.\n   3.16 Action items\n      We have no suggestions\
    \ at this time for changes to the\n      directorate, working groups or others\
    \ to support the concerns or\n      gather more information needed for a decision.\
    \ We remain available\n      to provide input to the IPng process.\n"

  - "5.  Conclusions\n   The potential for IPng to provide a universal internetworking\n\
    \   solution is a very attractive possibility, but there are many hurdles\n  \
    \ to be overcome. The general acceptance of IPng to support future\n   broadband\
    \ services will depend on more than the IPng itself. There is\n   need for IPng\
    \ to be backed by the whole suite of Internet technology\n   that will support\
    \ the future networks and applications. These\n   technologies must include the\
    \ adequate support for commercial\n   operation of a global Internet that will\
    \ be built, financed and\n   administered by many different private and public\
    \ organizations.\n   The Internet community has taken pride in following a nimble\
    \ and\n   efficient path in the development and deployment of network\n   technology.\
    \ And the Internet has been very successful up to now. The\n   challenge is to\
    \ show that the Internet model can be a preferred\n   technical solution for the\
    \ future. Broadband networks and services\n   will become widely available in\
    \ a relatively short future, and this\n   puts the Internet community in a fast\
    \ track race. The current process\n   to define IPng can be seen as a test of\
    \ the ability of the Internet\n   to evolve from its initial development - very\
    \ successful but also\n   protected and limited in scope  - to a general technology\
    \ for the\n   support of a commercially viable broadband marketplace.  If the\n\
    \   Internet model is to become the preferred general solution for\n   broadband\
    \ networking,  the current IPng process seems to be a\n   critical starting point.\n"
