  - "1.0.  Introduction\n   This document is the introduction to a document set aiming\
    \ to\n   document all usage of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards.  In an effort\n\
    \   to have the information in a manageable form, it has been broken into\n  \
    \ 7 documents, conforming to the current IETF areas (Application [1],\n   Internet\
    \ [2], Operations and Management [3], Routing [4], Security\n   [5], Sub-IP [6],\
    \ and Transport [7]).  It also describes the\n   methodology used during documentation,\
    \ which types of RFCs that have\n   been documented, and provides a concatenated\
    \ summary of results.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Short Historical Perspective
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Short Historical Perspective\n   There are many challenges that face the\
    \ Internet Engineering\n   community.  The foremost of these challenges has been\
    \ the scaling\n   issue: how to grow a network that was envisioned to handle thousands\n\
    \   of hosts to one that will handle tens of millions of networks with\n   billions\
    \ of hosts.  Over the years, this scaling problem has been\n   managed, with varying\
    \ degrees of success, by changes to the network\n   layer and to routing protocols.\
    \  (Although largely ignored in the\n   changes to network layer and routing protocols,\
    \ the tremendous\n   advances in computational hardware during the past two decades\
    \ have\n   been of significant benefit in management of scaling problems\n   encountered\
    \ thus far.)\n   The first \"modern\" transition to the network layer occurred\
    \ during\n   the early 1980's, moving from the Network Control Protocol (NCP)\
    \ to\n   IPv4.  This culminated in the famous \"flag day\" of January 1, 1983.\n\
    \   IP Version 4 originally specified an 8 bit network and 24 bit host\n   addresses,\
    \ as documented in RFC 760.  A year later, IPv4 was updated\n   in RFC 791 to\
    \ include the famous A, B, C, D, and E class system.\n   Networks were growing\
    \ in such a way that it was clear that a\n   convention for breaking networks\
    \ into smaller pieces was needed.  In\n   October of 1984 RFC 917 was published\
    \ formalizing the practice of\n   subnetting.\n   By the late 1980's, it was clear\
    \ that the current exterior routing\n   protocol used by the Internet (EGP) was\
    \ insufficiently robust to\n   scale with the growth of the Internet.  The first\
    \ version of BGP was\n   documented in 1989 in RFC 1105.\n   Yet another scaling\
    \ issue, exhaustion of the class B address space\n   became apparent in the early\
    \ 1990s.  The growth and commercialization\n   of the Internet stimulated organisations\
    \ requesting IP addresses in\n   alarming numbers.  By May of 1992, over 45% of\
    \ the Class B space had\n   been allocated.  In early 1993 RFC 1466 was published,\
    \ directing\n   assignment of blocks of Class C's be given out instead of Class\
    \ B's.\n   This temporarily circumvented the problem of address space\n   exhaustion,\
    \ but had a significant impact of the routing\n   infrastructure.\n   The number\
    \ of entries in the \"core\" routing tables began to grow\n   exponentially as\
    \ a result of RFC 1466.  This led to the\n   implementation of BGP4 and CIDR prefix\
    \ addressing.  This may have\n   circumvented the problem for the present, but\
    \ they continue to pose\n   potential scaling issues.\n   Growth in the population\
    \ of Internet hosts since the mid-1980s would\n   have long overwhelmed the IPv4\
    \ address space if industry had not\n   supplied a circumvention in the form of\
    \ Network Address Translators\n   (NATs).  To do this, the Internet has watered\
    \ down the underlying\n   \"End-to-End\" principle.\n   In the early 1990's, the\
    \ IETF was aware of these potential problems\n   and began a long design process\
    \ to create a successor to IPv4 that\n   would address these issues.  The outcome\
    \ of that process was IPv6.\n   The purpose of this document is not to discuss\
    \ the merits or problems\n   of IPv6.  That debate is still ongoing and will eventually\
    \ be decided\n   on how well the IETF defines transition mechanisms and how industry\n\
    \   accepts the solution.  The question is not \"should,\" but \"when.\"\n"
- title: 1.2.  An Observation on the Classification of Standards
  contents:
  - "1.2.  An Observation on the Classification of Standards\n   It has become clear\
    \ during the course of this investigation that\n   there has been little management\
    \ of the status of standards over the\n   years.  Some attempt has been made by\
    \ the introduction of the\n   classification of standards into Full, Draft, Proposed,\
    \ Experimental,\n   and Historic.  However, there has not been a concerted effort\
    \ to\n   actively manage the classification for older standards.  Standards\n\
    \   are only classified as Historic when either a newer version of the\n   protocol\
    \ is deployed and it is randomly noticed that an RFC describes\n   a long dead\
    \ protocol, or a serious flaw is discovered in a protocol.\n   Another issue is\
    \ the status of Proposed Standards.  Since this is the\n   entry level position\
    \ for protocols entering the standards process,\n   many old protocols or non-implemented\
    \ protocols linger in this status\n   indefinitely.  This problem also exists\
    \ for Experimental RFCs.\n   Similarly, the problem exists for the Best Current\
    \ Practices (BCP)\n   and For You Information (FYI) series of documents.\n   To\
    \ exemplify this point, there are 61 Full Standards, only 4 of which\n   have\
    \ been reclassified to Historic.  There are 65 Draft Standards,\n   611 Proposed\
    \ Standards, and 150 Experimental RFCs, of which only 66\n   have been reclassified\
    \ as Historic.  That is a rate of less than 8%.\n   It should be obvious that\
    \ in the more that 30 years of protocol\n   development and documentation, there\
    \ should be at least as many (if\n   not a majority of) protocols that have been\
    \ retired compared to the\n   ones that are currently active.\n   Please note\
    \ that there is occasionally some confusion of the meaning\n   of a \"Historic\"\
    \ classification.  It does NOT necessarily mean that\n   the protocol is not being\
    \ used.  A good example of this concept is\n   the Routing Information Protocol(RIP)\
    \ version 1.  There are many\n   thousands of sites using this protocol even though\
    \ it has Historic\n   status.  There are potentially hundreds of otherwise classified\
    \ RFC's\n   that should be reclassified.\n"
- title: 2.0.  Methodology
  contents:
  - "2.0.  Methodology\n   To perform this study, each class of IETF standards are\
    \ investigated\n   in order of maturity:  Full, Draft, and Proposed, as well as\n\
    \   Experimental.  Informational and BCP RFCs are not addressed.  RFCs\n   that\
    \ have been obsoleted by either newer versions or because they\n   have transitioned\
    \ through the standards process are not covered.\n   RFCs which have been classified\
    \ as Historic are also not included.\n   Please note that a side effect of this\
    \ choice of methodology is that\n   some protocols that are defined by a series\
    \ of RFC's that are of\n   different levels of standards maturity are covered\
    \ in different spots\n   in the document.  Likewise, other natural groupings (i.e.,\
    \ MIBs, SMTP\n   extensions, IP over FOO, PPP, DNS, etc.) could easily be imagined.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Scope\n   The procedure used in this investigation is an exhaustive reading\
    \ of\n   the applicable RFC's.  This task involves reading approximately\n   25,000\
    \ pages of protocol specifications.  To compound this, it was\n   more than a\
    \ process of simple reading.  It was necessary to attempt\n   to understand the\
    \ purpose and functionality of each protocol in order\n   to make a proper determination\
    \ of IPv4 reliability.  The author has\n   made every effort to produce as complete\
    \ a document set as possible,\n   but it is likely that some subtle (or perhaps\
    \ not so subtle)\n   dependence was missed.  The author encourages those familiar\n\
    \   (designers, implementers or anyone who has an intimate knowledge)\n   with\
    \ any protocol to review the appropriate sections and make\n   comments.\n"

- title: 4.0.  Discussion of "Long Term" Stability of Addresses on Protocols
  contents:
  - "4.0.  Discussion of \"Long Term\" Stability of Addresses on Protocols\n   In\
    \ attempting this analysis, it was determined that a full scale\n   analysis is\
    \ well beyond the scope of this document.  Instead, a short\n   discussion is\
    \ presented on how such a framework might be established.\n   A suggested approach\
    \ would be to do an analysis of protocols based on\n   their overall function,\
    \ similar (but not strictly) to the OSI network\n   reference model.  It might\
    \ be more appropriate to frame the\n   discussion in terms of the different Areas\
    \ of the IETF.\n   The problem is fundamental to the overall architecture of the\n\
    \   Internet and its future.  One of the stated goals of the IPng (now\n   IPv6)\
    \ was \"automatic\" and \"easy\" address renumbering.  An additional\n   goal\
    \ is \"stateless autoconfiguration.\"  To these ends, a substantial\n   amount\
    \ of work has gone into the development of such protocols as\n   DHCP and Dynamic\
    \ DNS.  This goes against the Internet age-old \"end-\n   to-end principle.\"\n\
    \   Most protocol designs implicitly count on certain underlying\n   principles\
    \ that currently exist in the network.  For example, the\n   design of packet\
    \ switched networks allows upper level protocols to\n   ignore the underlying\
    \ stability of packet routes.  When paths change\n   in the network, the higher\
    \ level protocols are typically unaware and\n   uncaring.  This works well since\
    \ whether the packet goes A-B-C-D-E-F\n   or A-B-X-Y-Z-E-F is of little consequence.\n\
    \   In a world where endpoints (i.e., A and F in the example above)\n   change\
    \ at a \"rapid\" rate, a new model for protocol developers should\n   be considered.\
    \  It seems that a logical development would be a change\n   in the operation\
    \ of the Transport layer protocols.  The current model\n   is essentially a choice\
    \ between TCP and UDP, neither of which\n   provides any mechanism for an orderly\
    \ handoff of the connection if\n   and when the network endpoint (IP) addresses\
    \ change.  Perhaps a third\n   major transport layer protocol should be developed,\
    \ or perhaps\n   updated TCP and UDP specifications that include this function\
    \ might\n   be a better solution.\n   There are many, many variables that would\
    \ need to go into a\n   successful development of such a protocol.  Some issues\
    \ to consider\n   are: timing principles; overlap periods as an endpoint moves\
    \ from\n   address A, to addresses A and B (answers to both), to only B; delays\n\
    \   due to the recalculation of routing paths, etc...\n"
