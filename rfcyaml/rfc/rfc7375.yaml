- title: 1.  Introduction and Scope
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Scope\n   As is discussed in the STIR problem statement\
    \ [RFC7340] (where \"STIR\"\n   refers to the Secure Telephone Identity Revisited\
    \ working group), the\n   primary enabler of robocalling, vishing, swatting, and\
    \ related\n   attacks is the capability to impersonate a calling party number.\
    \  The\n   starkest examples of these attacks are cases where automated callees\n\
    \   on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) rely on the calling\n   number\
    \ as a security measure, for example, to access a voicemail\n   system.  Robocallers\
    \ use impersonation as a means of obscuring\n   identity.  While robocallers can,\
    \ in the ordinary PSTN, block (that\n   is, withhold) their calling number from\
    \ presentation, callees are\n   less likely to pick up calls from blocked identities;\
    \ therefore,\n   appearing to call from some number, any number, is preferable.\n\
    \   However, robocallers prefer not to call from a number that can trace\n   back\
    \ to the them, so they impersonate numbers that are not assigned\n   to them.\n\
    \   The scope of impersonation in this threat model pertains solely to\n   the\
    \ rendering of a calling telephone number to a callee (human user\n   or automaton)\
    \ at the time of call setup.  The primary attack vector\n   is therefore one where\
    \ the attacker contrives for the calling\n   telephone number in signaling to\
    \ be a chosen number.  In this attack,\n   the number is one that the attacker\
    \ is not authorized to use (as a\n   caller) but gives in order for that number\
    \ to be consumed or rendered\n   on the terminating side.  The threat model assumes\
    \ that this attack\n   simply cannot be prevented: there is no way to stop the\
    \ attacker from\n   creating call setup messages that contain attacker-chosen\
    \ calling\n   telephone numbers.  The solution space therefore focuses on ways\
    \ that\n   terminating or intermediary elements might differentiate authorized\n\
    \   from unauthorized calling party numbers in order that policies, human\n  \
    \ or automatic, might act on that information.\n   Securing an authenticated calling\
    \ party number at call setup time\n   does not entail any assertions about the\
    \ entity or entities that will\n   send and receive media during the call itself.\
    \  In call paths with\n   intermediaries and gateways (as described below), there\
    \ may be no way\n   to provide any assurance in the signaling about participants\
    \ in the\n   media of a call.  In those end-to-end IP environments where such\n\
    \   assurance is possible, it is highly desirable.  However, in the\n   threat\
    \ model described in this document, \"impersonation\" does not\n   consider impersonating\
    \ an authorized listener after a call has been\n   established (e.g., as a third\
    \ party attempting to eavesdrop on a\n   conversation).  Attackers that could\
    \ impersonate an authorized\n   listener require capabilities that robocallers\
    \ and voicemail hackers\n   are unlikely to possess, and historically, such attacks\
    \ have not\n   played a role in enabling robocalling or related problems.\n  \
    \ In SIP, and even many traditional telephone protocols, call signaling\n   can\
    \ be renegotiated after the call has been established.  Using\n   various transfer\
    \ mechanisms common in telephone systems, a callee can\n   easily be connected\
    \ to, or conferenced in with, telephone numbers\n   other than the original calling\
    \ number once a call has been\n   established.  These post-setup changes to the\
    \ call are outside the\n   scope of impersonation considered in this model: the\
    \ motivating use\n   cases of defeating robocalling, voicemail hacking, and swatting\
    \ all\n   rely on impersonation during the initial call setup.  Furthermore,\n\
    \   this threat model does not include in its scope the verification of\n   the\
    \ reached party's telephone number back to the originator of the\n   call.  There\
    \ is no assurance to the originator that they are reaching\n   the correct number,\
    \ nor any indication when call forwarding has taken\n   place.  This threat model\
    \ is focused only on verifying the calling\n   party number to the callee.\n \
    \  In much of the PSTN, there exists a supplemental service that\n   translates\
    \ calling party numbers into names, including the proper\n   names of people and\
    \ businesses, for rendering to the called user.\n   These services (frequently\
    \ marketed as part of 'Caller ID') provide a\n   further attack surface for impersonation.\
    \  The threat model described\n   in this document addresses only the calling\
    \ party number, even though\n   presenting a forged calling party number may cause\
    \ a chosen calling\n   party name to be rendered to the user as well.  Providing\
    \ a\n   verifiable calling party number therefore improves the security of\n \
    \  calling party name systems, but this threat model does not consider\n   attacks\
    \ specific to names.  Such attacks may be carried out against\n   the databases\
    \ consulted by the terminating side of a call to provide\n   calling party names\
    \ or by impersonators forging a particular calling\n   party number in order to\
    \ present a misleading name to the user.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Endpoints
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Endpoints\n   There are two main categories of end-user terminals relevant\
    \ to this\n   discussion, a dumb device (such as a 'black phone') or a smart\n\
    \   device:\n   o  Dumb devices comprise a simple dial pad, handset, and ringer,\n\
    \      optionally accompanied by a display that can render a limited\n      number\
    \ of characters.  Typically, the display renders enough\n      characters for\
    \ a telephone number and an accompanying name, but\n      sometimes fewer are\
    \ rendered.  Although users interface with these\n      devices, the intelligence\
    \ that drives them lives in the service\n      provider network.\n   o  Smart\
    \ devices are general-purpose computers with some degree of\n      programmability\
    \ and with the capacity to access the Internet and\n      to render text, audio,\
    \ and/or images.  This category includes\n      smart phones, telephone applications\
    \ on desktop and laptop\n      computers, IP private branch exchanges, etc.\n\
    \   There is a further category of automated terminals without an end\n   user.\
    \  These include systems like voicemail services, which may\n   provide a different\
    \ set of services to a caller based solely on the\n   calling party's number,\
    \ for example, granting the (purported) mailbox\n   owner access to a menu while\
    \ giving other callers only the ability to\n   leave a message.  Though the capability\
    \ of voicemail services varies\n   widely, many today have Internet access and\
    \ advanced application\n   interfaces (to render 'visual voicemail' [OMTP-VV],\
    \ to automatically\n   transcribe voicemail to email, etc.).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Intermediaries
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Intermediaries\n   The endpoints of a traditional telephone call connect\
    \ through\n   numerous intermediary devices in the network.  The set of\n   intermediary\
    \ devices traversed during call setup between two\n   endpoints is referred to\
    \ as a call path.  The length of the call path\n   can vary considerably: it is\
    \ possible in Voice over IP (VoIP)\n   deployments for two endpoint entities to\
    \ send traffic to one another\n   directly, but, more commonly, several intermediaries\
    \ exist in a VoIP\n   call path.  One or more gateways also may appear on a call\
    \ path.\n   o  Intermediaries forward call signaling to the next device in the\n\
    \      path.  These intermediaries may also modify the signaling in order\n  \
    \    to improve interoperability, to enable proper network-layer media\n     \
    \ connections, or to enforce operator policy.  This threat model\n      assumes\
    \ there are no restrictions on the modifications to\n      signaling that an intermediary\
    \ can introduce (which is consistent\n      with the observed behavior of such\
    \ devices).\n   o  A gateway is a subtype of intermediary that translates call\n\
    \      signaling from one protocol into another.  In the process, they\n     \
    \ tend to consume any signaling specific to the original protocol\n      (elements\
    \ like transaction-matching identifiers) and may need to\n      transcode or otherwise\
    \ alter identifiers as they are rendered in\n      the destination protocol.\n\
    \   This threat model assumes that intermediaries and gateways can\n   forward\
    \ and retarget calls as necessary, which can result in a call\n   terminating\
    \ at a place the originator did not expect; this is a\n   common condition in\
    \ call routing.  This observation is significant to\n   the solution space because\
    \ it limits the ability of the originator to\n   anticipate what the telephone\
    \ number of the respondent will be (for\n   more on the \"unanticipated respondent\"\
    \ problem, see [SIP-SECURITY]).\n   Furthermore, we assume that some intermediaries\
    \ or gateways may, due\n   to their capabilities or policies, discard calling\
    \ party number\n   information in whole or in part.  Today, many IP-PSTN gateways\
    \ simply\n   ignore any information available about the caller in the IP leg of\n\
    \   the call and allow the telephone number of the Primary Rate Interface\n  \
    \ (PRI) line used by the gateway to be sent as the calling party number\n   for\
    \ the PSTN leg of the call.  For example, a call might also gateway\n   to a multi-frequency\
    \ network where only a limited number of digits of\n   automatic numbering identification\
    \ (ANI) data are signaled.  Some\n   protocols may render telephone numbers in\
    \ a way that makes it\n   impossible for a terminating side to parse or canonicalize\
    \ a number.\n   In these cases, providing authenticated calling number data may\
    \ be\n   impossible, but this is not indicative of an attack or other security\n\
    \   failure.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Attackers
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Attackers\n   We assume that an attacker has the following capabilities:\n\
    \   o  An attacker can create telephone calls at will, originating them\n    \
    \  either on the PSTN or over IP, and can supply an arbitrary calling\n      party\
    \ number.\n   o  An attacker can capture and replay signaling previously observed\n\
    \      by it.\n   o  An attacker has access to the Internet and thus the ability\
    \ to\n      inject arbitrary traffic over the Internet, to access public\n   \
    \   directories, etc.\n   There are attack scenarios in which an attacker compromises\n\
    \   intermediaries in the call path or captures credentials that allow\n   the\
    \ attacker to impersonate a caller.  Those system-level attacks are\n   not considered\
    \ in this threat model, though secure design and\n   operation of systems to prevent\
    \ these sorts of attacks are necessary\n   for envisioned countermeasures to work.\
    \  To date, robocallers and\n   other impersonators do not resort to compromising\
    \ systems but rather\n   exploit the intrinsic lack of secure identity in existing\
    \ mechanisms;\n   remedying this problem lies within the scope of this threat\
    \ model.\n   This threat model also does not consider scenarios in which the\n\
    \   operators of intermediaries or gateways are themselves adversaries\n   who\
    \ intentionally discard valid identity information (without a user\n   requesting\
    \ anonymity) or who send falsified identity; see\n   Section 4.1.\n"
- title: 3.  Attacks
  contents:
  - "3.  Attacks\n   The uses of impersonation described in this section are broadly\n\
    \   divided into two categories: those where an attack will not succeed\n   unless\
    \ the attacker impersonates a specific identity and those where\n   an attacker\
    \ impersonates an arbitrary identity in order to disguise\n   its own.  At a high\
    \ level, impersonation encourages targets to answer\n   attackers' calls and makes\
    \ identifying attackers more difficult.\n   This section shows how concrete attacks\
    \ based on those different\n   techniques might be launched.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Voicemail Hacking via Impersonation
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Voicemail Hacking via Impersonation\n   A voicemail service may allow users\
    \ calling from their phones access\n   to their voicemail boxes on the basis of\
    \ the calling party number.\n   If an attacker wants to access the voicemail of\
    \ a particular target,\n   the attacker may try to impersonate the calling party\
    \ number using\n   one of the scenarios described in Section 4.\n   This attack\
    \ is closely related to attacks on similar automated\n   systems, potentially\
    \ including banks, airlines, calling-card\n   services, conferencing providers,\
    \ ISPs, and other businesses that\n   fully or partly grant access to resources\
    \ on the basis of the calling\n   party number alone (rather than any shared secret\
    \ or further identity\n   check).  It is analogous to an attack in which a human\
    \ is encouraged\n   to answer a phone or to divulge information once a call is\
    \ in\n   progress, by seeing a familiar calling party number.\n   The envisioned\
    \ countermeasures for this attack involve the voicemail\n   system treating calls\
    \ that supply authenticated calling number data\n   differently from other calls.\
    \  In the absence of that identity\n   information, for example, a voicemail service\
    \ might enforce some\n   other caller authentication policy (perhaps requiring\
    \ a PIN for\n   caller authentication).  Asserted caller identity alone provides\
    \ an\n   authenticated basis for granting access to a voicemail box only when\n\
    \   an identity is claimed legitimately; the absence of a verifiably\n   legitimate\
    \ calling identity here may not be evidence of malice, just\n   of uncertainty\
    \ or a limitation imposed by the set of intermediaries\n   traversed for a specific\
    \ call path.\n   If the voicemail service could learn ahead of time that it should\n\
    \   expect authenticated calling number data from a particular number,\n   that\
    \ would enable the voicemail service to adopt stricter policies\n   for handling\
    \ a request without authentication data.  Since users\n   typically contact a\
    \ voicemail service repeatedly, the service could,\n   for example, remember which\
    \ requests contain authenticated calling\n   number data and require further authentication\
    \ mechanisms when\n   identity is absent.  The deployment of such a feature would\
    \ be\n   facilitated in many environments by the fact that the voicemail\n   service\
    \ is often operated by an organization that would be in a\n   position to enable\
    \ or require authentication of calling party\n   identity (for example, carriers\
    \ or enterprises).  Even if the\n   voicemail service is decoupled from the number\
    \ assignee, issuers of\n   credentials or other authorities could provide a service\
    \ that informs\n   verifiers that they should expect identity in calls from particular\n\
    \   numbers.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Unsolicited Commercial Calling from Impersonated Numbers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Unsolicited Commercial Calling from Impersonated Numbers\n   The unsolicited\
    \ commercial calling, or 'robocalling' for short,\n   attack is similar to the\
    \ voicemail attack except that the robocaller\n   does not need to impersonate\
    \ the particular number controlled by the\n   target, merely some \"plausible\"\
    \ number.  A robocaller may impersonate\n   a number that is not an assignable\
    \ number (for example, in the United\n   States, a number beginning with 0) or\
    \ an unassigned number.  This\n   behavior is seen in the wild today.  A robocaller\
    \ may change numbers\n   every time a new call is placed, e.g., selecting numbers\
    \ randomly.\n   A closely related attack is sending unsolicited bulk commercial\n\
    \   messages via text messaging services.  These messages usually\n   originate\
    \ on the Internet, though they may ultimately reach endpoints\n   over traditional\
    \ telephone network protocols or the Internet.  While\n   most text messaging\
    \ endpoints are mobile phones, broadband\n   residential services are increasingly\
    \ supporting text messaging as\n   well.  The originators of these messages typically\
    \ impersonate a\n   calling party number, in some cases, a \"short code\" specific\
    \ to text\n   messaging services.\n   The envisioned countermeasures to robocalling\
    \ are similar to those in\n   the voicemail example, but there are significant\
    \ differences.  One\n   important potential countermeasure is simply to verify\
    \ that the\n   calling party number is in fact assignable and assigned.  Unlike\n\
    \   voicemail services, end users typically have never been contacted by\n   the\
    \ number used by a robocaller before.  Thus, they can't rely on\n   past association\
    \ to anticipate whether or not the calling party\n   number should supply authenticated\
    \ calling number data.  If there\n   were a service that could inform the terminating\
    \ side that it should\n   expect this data for calls or texts from that number,\
    \ however, that\n   would also help in the robocalling case.\n   When a human\
    \ callee is to be alerted at call setup time, the time\n   frame for executing\
    \ any countermeasures is necessarily limited.\n   Ideally, a user would not be\
    \ alerted that a call has been received\n   until any necessary identity checks\
    \ have been performed.  This could,\n   however, result in inordinate post-dial\
    \ delay from the perspective of\n   legitimate callers.  Cryptographic and network\
    \ operations must be\n   minimized for these countermeasures to be practical.\
    \  For text\n   messages, a delay for executing anti-impersonation countermeasures\
    \ is\n   much less likely to degrade perceptible service.\n   The eventual effect\
    \ of these countermeasures would be to force\n   robocallers to either (a) block\
    \ their caller identity, in which case\n   end users could opt not to receive\
    \ such calls or messages, or (b) use\n   authenticated calling numbers traceable\
    \ to them, which would then\n   allow for other forms of redress.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Telephony Denial-of-Service Attacks
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Telephony Denial-of-Service Attacks\n   In the case of telephony denial-of-service\
    \ (TDoS) attacks, the attack\n   relies on impersonation in order to obscure the\
    \ origin of an attack\n   that is intended to tie up telephone resources.  By\
    \ placing incessant\n   telephone calls, an attacker renders a target number unreachable\
    \ by\n   legitimate callers.  These attacks might target a business, an\n   individual,\
    \ or a public resource like emergency responders; the\n   attacker may intend\
    \ to extort the target.  Attack calls may be placed\n   from a single endpoint\
    \ or from multiple endpoints under the control\n   of the attacker, and the attacker\
    \ may control endpoints in different\n   administrative domains.  Impersonation,\
    \ in this case, allows the\n   attack to evade policies that would block based\
    \ on the originating\n   number and furthermore prevents the victim from learning\
    \ the\n   perpetrator of the attack or even the originating service provider of\n\
    \   the attacker.\n   As is the case with robocalling, the attacker typically\
    \ does not have\n   to impersonate a specific number in order to launch a denial-of-\n\
    \   service attack.  The number simply has to vary enough to prevent\n   simple\
    \ policies from blocking the attack calls.  An attacker may,\n   however, have\
    \ a further intention to create the appearance that a\n   particular party is\
    \ to blame for an attack; in that case, the\n   attacker might want to impersonate\
    \ a secondary target in the attack.\n   The envisioned countermeasures are twofold.\
    \  First, as with\n   robocalling, ensuring that calling party numbers are assignable\
    \ or\n   assigned will help mitigate unsophisticated attacks.  Second, if\n  \
    \ authenticated calling number data is supplied for legitimate calls,\n   then\
    \ Internet endpoints or intermediaries can make effective policy\n   decisions\
    \ in the middle of an attack by deprioritizing unsigned calls\n   when congestion\
    \ conditions exist; signed calls, if accepted, have the\n   necessary accountability\
    \ should it turn out they are malicious.  This\n   could extend to include, for\
    \ example, an originating network\n   observing a congestion condition for a destination\
    \ number and perhaps\n   dropping unsigned calls that are clearly part of a TDoS\
    \ attack.  As\n   with robocalling, all of these countermeasures must execute\
    \ in a\n   timely manner to be effective.\n   There are certain flavors of TDoS\
    \ attacks, including those against\n   emergency responders, against which authenticated\
    \ calling number data\n   is unlikely to be a successful countermeasure.  These\
    \ entities are\n   effectively obligated to attempt to respond to every call they\n\
    \   receive, and the absence of authenticated calling number data in many\n  \
    \ cases will not remove that obligation.\n"

    \    An attacker on the Internet uses a commercial WebRTC service to\n      send\
    \ a call to the PSTN with a chosen calling party number.  The\n      service contacts\
    \ an Internet-to-PSTN gateway, which inserts the\n      attacker's chosen calling\
    \ party number into the SS7 [Q764] call\n      setup message (the CgPN field of\
    \ an IAM).  When the call setup\n      message reaches the terminating telephone\
    \ switch, the terminal\n      renders the attacker's chosen calling party number\
    \ as the calling\n      identity.\n   Impersonation, IP-PSTN-IP\n      An attacker\
    \ with an IP phone sends a SIP request to the telephone\n      number of a voicemail\
    \ service, perhaps without even knowing that\n      the voicemail service is IP-based.\
    \  The attacker puts a chosen\n      calling party number into the From header\
    \ field value of the\n      INVITE.  The attacker's INVITE reaches an Internet-to-PSTN\n\
    \      gateway, which inserts the attacker's chosen calling party number\n   \
    \   into the CgPN of an IAM.  That IAM then traverses the PSTN until\n      (perhaps\
    \ after a call forwarding) it reaches another gateway, this\n      time back to\
    \ the IP realm, to an H.323 network.  The PSTN-IP\n      gateway takes the calling\
    \ party number in the IAM CgPN field and\n      puts it into the SETUP request.\
    \  When the SETUP reaches the\n      endpoint terminal, the terminal renders the\
    \ attacker's chosen\n      calling party number as the calling identity.\n"

  - "4.1.  Solution-Specific Attacks\n   Solution-specific attacks are outside the\
    \ scope of this document,\n   though two sorts of solutions are anticipated by\
    \ the STIR problem\n   statement: in-band and out-of-band solutions (see [RFC7340]).\
    \  There\n   are a few points that future work on solution-specific threats must\n\
    \   acknowledge.  The design of the credential system envisioned as a\n   solution\
    \ to these threats must, for example, limit the scope of the\n   credentials issued\
    \ to carriers or national authorities to those\n   numbers that fall under their\
    \ purview.  This will impose limits on\n   what (verifiable) assertions can be\
    \ made by intermediaries.\n   Some of the attacks that should be considered in\
    \ the future include\n   the following:\n   o  Attacks against in-band solutions\n\
    \      *  Replaying parts of messages used by the solution\n      *  Using a SIP\
    \ REFER request to induce a party with access to\n         credentials to place\
    \ a call to a chosen number\n      *  Removing parts of messages used by the solution\n\
    \   o  Attacks against out-of-band solutions\n      *  Provisioning false or malformed\
    \ data reflecting a placed call\n         into any datastores that are part of\
    \ the out-of-band mechanism\n      *  Mining any datastores that are part of the\
    \ out-of-band\n         mechanism\n   o  Attacks against either approach\n   \
    \   *  Attack on any directories/services that report whether you\n         should\
    \ expect authenticated calling number data or not\n      *  Canonicalization attacks\n"
