    \ working groups and other designated subordinates.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction and Community Considerations\n   The Internet2 Middleware Architecture\
    \ Committee for Education (MACE)\n   produces many kinds of documents: specifications,\
    \ working drafts,\n   object classes, schemas, stylesheets, etc.  It also defines\
    \ directory\n   attributes and controlled vocabularies for the values of some\
    \ of\n   those attributes.\n   MACE wishes to provide global, distributed, persistent,\
    \ location-\n   independent names for these resources.  The Uniform Resource Name\n\
    \   (URN) variant of URIs meets these requirements.\n   MACE working groups and\
    \ other MACE-affiliated groups will benefit\n   from the MACE URN namespace by\
    \ having an easy, efficient way to\n   assign globally unique, persistent identifiers\
    \ to resources that they\n   create.  The nature of MACE work is that serves the\
    \ needs of one or\n   more communities of interest.  A namespace managed so as\
    \ to\n   facilitate the creation, registration and resolution of unique,\n   persistent\
    \ identifiers will be of great value for MACE, its\n   affiliates and the higher\
    \ education community generally.\n   This URN namespace specification is for a\
    \ formal namespace.\n"

    \ 0771\n      hazelton@doit.wisc.edu\n   Syntactic structure:\n      The Namespace\
    \ Specific Strings (NSS) of all URNs assigned by MACE\n      will conform to the\
    \ syntax defined in section 2.2 of RFC 2141,\n      \"URN Syntax\" [1].  In addition,\
    \ all MACE URN NSSs will consist of\n      a left-to-right series of tokens delimited\
    \ by colons.  The left-\n      to-right sequence of colon-delimited tokens corresponds\
    \ to\n      descending nodes in a tree.  To the right of the lowest naming\n \
    \     authority node there may be zero, one or more levels of\n      hierarchical\
    \ naming nodes terminating in a rightmost leaf node.\n      See the section entitled\
    \ \"Identifier assignment\" below for more on\n      the semantics of NSSs.  This\
    \ syntax convention is captured in the\n      following normative ABNF rules for\
    \ MACE NSSs (see RFC 2234) [2]:\n      MACE-NSS        =   1*(subStChar) 0*(\"\
    :\" 1*(subStChar))\n      subStChar       =   trans / \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\n  \
    \    trans           =   ALPHA / DIGIT / other / reserved\n      other       \
    \    =   \"(\" / \")\" / \"+\" / \",\" / \"-\" / \".\" /\n                   \
    \        \"=\" / \"@\" / \";\" / \"$\" /\n                           \"_\" / \"\
    !\" / \"*\" / \"'\"\n      reserved        =   \"%\" / \"/\" / \"?\" / \"#\"\n\
    \      The exclusion of the colon from the list of \"other\" characters\n    \
    \  means that the colon can only occur as a delimiter between string\n      tokens.\
    \  Note that this ABNF rule set guarantees that any valid\n      MACE NSS is also\
    \ a valid RFC 2141 NSS.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      None.\n \
    \  Identifier uniqueness:\n      It is the responsibility of MACE directors to\
    \ guarantee uniqueness\n      of the names of immediately subordinate naming authorities.\
    \  Each\n      lower-level naming authority in turn inherits the responsibility\n\
    \      of guaranteeing uniqueness of names in their branch of the naming\n   \
    \   tree.\n   Identifier persistence:\n      MACE directors bear ultimate responsibility\
    \ for maintaining the\n      usability of MACE URNs over time.  This responsibility\
    \ may be\n      delegated to subordinate naming authorities per the discussion\
    \ in\n      the section below on identifier assignment.  That section provides\n\
    \      a mechanism for the delegation to be revoked in case a subordinate\n  \
    \    naming authority ceases to function.\n   Identifier assignment:\n      MACE\
    \ directors will create an initial series of immediately\n      subordinate naming\
    \ authorities, and will define a process for\n      adding to that list of authorities.\
    \  Each top-level working group\n      of MACE will be invited to designate a\
    \ naming authority and to\n      suggest one or more candidate names for that\
    \ authority.  The\n      MACE-Shibboleth group, for example, might propose creating\
    \ a\n      naming authority under \"urn:mace:shib,\" \"urn:mace:shibboleth\" or\n\
    \      some other name.\n      Institutions and communities affiliated with MACE\
    \ may request,\n      through their designated MACE liaison, that they be granted\
    \ MACE-\n      subordinate naming authority status.  They may propose candidate\n\
    \      names for that authority.  One way for such entities to guarantee\n   \
    \   uniqueness of their proposed name is to base it on a DNS name.\n      That\
    \ is, if Georgetown University wished to be designated a\n      subordinate naming\
    \ authority under MACE, the institutional MACE\n      liaison could propose to\
    \ MACE directors that they be delegated\n      control over names beginning with\
    \ \"urn:mace:georgetown.edu\".\n      Institutions seeking affiliation with MACE\
    \ should send email to\n      mace-submit@internet2.edu, nominating an institutional\
    \ liaison and\n      providing contact information for that person.\n      On\
    \ at least an annual basis, MACE directors will contact the\n      liaisons or\
    \ directors of each immediately subordinate naming\n      authority.  If there\
    \ is no response, or if the respondent\n      indicates that they wish to relinquish\
    \ naming authority, the\n      authority over that branch of the tree reverts\
    \ to MACE.  This\n      process will be enforced recursively by each naming authority\
    \ on\n      its subordinates.  This process guarantees that responsibility for\n\
    \      each branch of the tree will lapse for less than one year at worst\n  \
    \    before being reclaimed by a superior authority.\n      Lexical equivalence\
    \ of two MACE namespace specific strings (NSSs)\n      is defined below as an\
    \ exact, case-sensitive string match.  MACE\n      will assign names of immediately\
    \ subordinate naming authorities in\n      a case-insensitive fashion, so that\
    \ there will not be two MACE-\n      subordinate naming authorities whose names\
    \ differ only in case.\n   Identifier resolution:\n      MACE directors will maintain\
    \ an index of all MACE and MACE\n      workgroup assigned URNs at the web site\n\
    \      http://middleware.internet2.edu/urn-mace/urn-mace.html.  That\n      index\
    \ will map URNs to resource identifiers or resource\n      specifications (e.g.,\
    \ protocol parameters).  MACE-affiliated\n      naming authorities will specify\
    \ how to resolve the URNs they\n      assign if they are resolvable.\n   Lexical\
    \ equivalence:\n      Lexical equivalence of two MACE namespace specific strings\
    \ (NSSs)\n      is defined as an exact, case-sensitive string match.\n   Conformance\
    \ with URN syntax:\n      All MACE NSSs fully conform to RFC 2141 syntax rules\
    \ for NSSs.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      As specified in the \"Identifier\
    \ resolution\" section above, MACE\n      directors will maintain an index of\
    \ all MACE and MACE workgroup\n      assigned URNs on its web site,\n      http://middleware.internet2.edu/urn-mace/urn-mace.html.\
    \  Presence\n      in that index implies that a given URN is valid.  MACE-affiliated\n\
    \      naming authorities will specify how to validate the URNs they\n      assign.\n\
    \   Scope:\n      Global.\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   Registration of an NID specific to MACE is reasonable\
    \ given the\n   following considerations:\n   1. MACE would like to assign URNs\
    \ to some very fine-grained objects\n      (such as specific controlled vocabulary\
    \ values of an attribute in\n      MACE-defined LDAP object classes).  This does\
    \ not seem to be the\n      primary intended use of the XMLORG namespace (RFC\
    \ 3120) [3], let\n      alone the more tightly controlled OASIS namespace (RFC\
    \ 3121) [4].\n   2. MACE seeks naming autonomy.  We understand that the XMLORG\n\
    \      registrants left the door open to subordinate naming authorities,\n   \
    \   \"OASIS may assign portions of its XMLORG namespace for assignment\n     \
    \ by other parties\" (RFC 3120) [3], but there is no specified\n      process\
    \ for such assignment.  That would in any case mean having a\n      fixed XMLORG-assigned\
    \ prefix on every single object to which we\n      assign a URN.  MACE has a number\
    \ of active work groups that may\n      well generate a growing number of subordinate\
    \ naming authorities.\n      Moreover, MACE is not a member of OASIS, so becoming\
    \ a subordinate\n      naming authority under the OASIS URN space is currently\
    \ not an\n      option.\n   3. MACE will want to assign URNs to non-XML objects\
    \ as well.  That is\n      another reason that XMLORG may not be an appropriate\
    \ higher-level\n      naming authority for MACE.\n   Some MACE-developed schema\
    \ and namespaces may be good candidates for\n   inclusion in the XMLORG registry.\
    \  The fact that such an object might\n   already have a MACE-assigned URN shouldn't\
    \ be a hindrance.  Work is\n   in progress to update RFC 2611 [5], which includes\
    \ an explicit\n   statement that two or more URNs may point to the same resource.\
    \  A\n   resource with a MACE-assigned namespace-specific-string would, of\n \
    \  course, be given an XMLORG namespace-specific-string at the time it\n   enters\
    \ the XMLORG registry.\n"
