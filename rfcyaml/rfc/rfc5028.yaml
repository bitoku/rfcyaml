  - "Abstract\n   This document registers a Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) service
    for\n   Instant Messaging (IM).  Specifically, this document focuses on\n   provisioning
    'im:' URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) in ENUM.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that
    uses DNS\n   (Domain Name Service, RFC 1034 [2]) to translate telephone numbers,\n
    \  such as '+12025550100', into URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers, RFC\n   3986
    [3]), such as 'im:user@example.com'.  ENUM exists primarily to\n   facilitate
    the interconnection of systems that rely on telephone\n   numbers with those that
    use URIs to identify resources.\n   Instant Messaging (IM) is a service defined
    in RFC 2778 [6] that\n   allows users to send and receive typically short, often
    textual\n   messages in near real-time.  The IETF has defined a generic URI used\n
    \  to identify an IM service for a particular resource: the 'im:' URI\n   scheme
    (defined in RFC 3861 [4]).  RFC 3861 [4] also defines rules\n   for discovering
    service running specific protocols, such as SIP (the\n   Session Initiation Protocol,
    RFC 3261 [8]) and XMPP (the eXtensible\n   Messaging and Presence Protocol, RFC
    3921 [9]) from a specific 'im:'\n   URI.\n   RFC 3953 [10] already defines an
    enumservice for presence services,\n   which returns 'pres:' URIs (also defined
    in RFC 3861 [4]).  This\n   document registers an enumservice for advertising
    IM information\n   associated with an E.164 number.\n"

  - "2.  ENUM Service Registration - im\n   As defined in RFC 3761 [1], the following
    is a template covering\n   information needed for the registration of the enumservice
    specified\n   in this document:\n   Enumservice Name:\n      \"im\"\n   Enumservice
    Type:\n      \"im\"\n   Enumservice Subtypes:\n      N/A\n   URI scheme(s):\n
    \     \"im:\"\n   Functional Specification:\n      This Enumservice indicates
    that the resource identified is an\n      'im:' URI.  The 'im:' URI scheme does
    not identify any particular\n      protocol that will be used to handle instant
    messaging receipt or\n      delivery, rather the mechanism in RFC 3861 [4] is
    used to discover\n      whether an IM protocol supported by the party querying
    ENUM is\n      also supported by the target resource.\n   Security considerations:\n
    \     See section 3.\n   Intended usage:\n      COMMON\n   Author:\n      Rohan

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) does not make policy
    decisions about\n   which records it provides to a DNS resolver.  All DNS records
    must be\n   assumed to be available to all inquirers at all times.  The\n   information
    provided within an ENUM record set must therefore be\n   considered open to the
    public -- which is a cause for some privacy\n   considerations.\n   Revealing
    an 'im:' URI by itself is unlikely to introduce many\n   privacy concerns, although,
    depending on the structure of the URI, it\n   might reveal the full name or employer
    of the target.  The use of\n   anonymous URIs mitigates this risk.\n   As ENUM
    uses DNS, which in its current form is an insecure protocol,\n   there is no mechanism
    for ensuring that the answer returned to a\n   query is authentic.  An analysis
    of threats specific to the\n   dependence of ENUM on the DNS is provided in RFC
    3761, and a thorough\n   analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in RFC
    3833 [11].\n   Many of these problems are prevented when the resolver verifies
    the\n   authenticity of answers to its ENUM queries via DNSSEC [5] in zones\n
    \  where it is available.\n   More serious security concerns are associated with
    potential attacks\n   against an underlying Instant Messaging system (for example,
    message\n   forgery and tampering).  For this reason, IM protocols have a number\n
    \  of security requirements (detailed in RFC 2779 [7]) that call for\n   authentication,
    integrity and confidentiality properties, and similar\n   measures to prevent
    such attacks.  Any instant messaging protocol\n   used in conjunction with the
    'im:' URI scheme is required to meet\n   these requirements.\n   Unlike a traditional
    telephone number, the resource identified by an\n   'im:' URI may require that
    callers provide cryptographic credentials\n   for authentication and authorization
    before instant messages are\n   exchanged.  In concert with instant messaging
    protocols, ENUM can\n   actually provide far greater protection from unwanted
    callers than\n   does the existing PSTN, despite the public availability of ENUM\n
    \  records.\n"
