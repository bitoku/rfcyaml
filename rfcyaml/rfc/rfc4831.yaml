  - "1.  Introduction\n   In [1], the basic problems that occur when a global mobility\
    \ protocol\n   is used for managing local mobility are described, and two currently\n\
    \   used approaches to localized mobility management -- the host-based\n   approach\
    \ that is used by most IETF protocols, and the proprietary\n   Wireless LAN (WLAN)\
    \ switch approach used between WLAN switches in\n   different subnets -- are examined.\
    \  The conclusion from the problem\n   statement document is that none of the\
    \ approaches has a complete\n   solution to the problem.  While the WLAN switch\
    \ approach is most\n   convenient for network operators and users because it requires\
    \ no\n   software on the mobile node other than the standard drivers for WiFi,\n\
    \   the proprietary nature limits interoperability, and the restriction\n   to\
    \ a single last-hop link type and wired backhaul link type restricts\n   scalability.\
    \  The IETF host-based protocols require host software\n   stack changes that\
    \ may not be compatible with all global mobility\n   protocols.  They also require\
    \ specialized and complex security\n   transactions with the network that may\
    \ limit deployability.  The\n   conclusion is that a localized mobility management\
    \ protocol that is\n   network based and requires no software on the host for\
    \ localized\n   mobility management is desirable.\n   This document develops a\
    \ brief functional architecture and detailed\n   goals for a network-based localized\
    \ mobility management protocol\n   (NETLMM).  Section 2 describes the functional\
    \ architecture of NETLMM.\n   In Section 3, a list of goals that is desirable\
    \ in the NETLMM\n   protocol is presented.  Section 4 briefly outlines Security\n\
    \   Considerations.  More discussion of security can be found in the\n   threat\
    \ analysis document [2].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   Mobility terminology in this document follows that in RFC\
    \ 3753 [10]\n   and in [1].  In addition, the following terms are related to the\n\
    \   functional architecture described in Section 2:\n   Localized Mobility Management\
    \ Domain\n      An Access Network in the sense defined in [1] in which mobility\
    \ is\n      handled by the NETLMM protocol.\n   Mobile Access Gateway\n      A\
    \ Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) is a functional network element that\n      terminates\
    \ a specific edge link and tracks mobile node IP-level\n      mobility between\
    \ edge links, through NETLMM signaling with the\n      Localized Mobility Anchor.\
    \  The MAG also terminates host routed\n      data traffic from the Localized\
    \ Mobility Anchor for mobile nodes\n      currently located within the edge link\
    \ under the MAG's control,\n      and forwards data traffic from mobile nodes\
    \ on the edge link under\n      its control to the Localized Mobility Anchor.\n\
    \   Local Mobility Anchor\n      A Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) is a router that\
    \ maintains a\n      collection of host routes and associated forwarding information\n\
    \      for mobile nodes within a localized mobility management domain\n      under\
    \ its control.  Together with the MAGs associated with it, the\n      LMA uses\
    \ the NETLMM protocol to manage IP node mobility within the\n      localized mobility\
    \ management domain.  Routing of mobile node data\n      traffic is anchored at\
    \ the LMA as the mobile node moves around\n      within the localized mobility\
    \ management domain.\n"
- title: 2.  NETLMM Functional Architecture
  contents:
  - "2.  NETLMM Functional Architecture\n   The NETLMM architecture consists of the\
    \ following components.\n   Localized Mobility Anchors (LMAs) within the backbone\
    \ network\n   maintain a collection of routes for individual mobile nodes within\n\
    \   the localized mobility management domain.  The routes point to the\n   Mobile\
    \ Access Gateways (MAGs) managing the links on which the mobile\n   nodes currently\
    \ are located.  Packets for a mobile node are routed to\n   and from the mobile\
    \ node through tunnels between the LMA and MAG.\n   When a mobile node moves from\
    \ one link to another, the MAG sends a\n   route update to the LMA.  While some\
    \ mobile node involvement is\n   necessary and expected for generic mobility functions\
    \ such as\n   movement detection and to inform the MAG about mobile node movement,\n\
    \   no specific mobile-node-to-network protocol will be required for\n   localized\
    \ mobility management itself.  Host stack involvement in\n   mobility management\
    \ is thereby limited to generic mobility functions\n   at the IP layer, and no\
    \ specialized localized mobility management\n   software is required.\n"
- title: 3.  Goals for the NETLMM Protocol
  contents:
  - "3.  Goals for the NETLMM Protocol\n   Section 2 of [1] describes three problems\
    \ with using a global\n   mobility management protocol for localized mobility\
    \ management.  Any\n   localized mobility management protocol must naturally address\
    \ these\n   three problems.  In addition, the side effects of introducing such\
    \ a\n   solution into the network need to be limited.  In this section, we\n \
    \  address goals for NETLMM, including both solving the basic problems\n   (Goals\
    \ 1, 2, and 3) and limiting the side effects (Goals 4+).\n   Some basic goals\
    \ of all IETF protocols are not discussed in detail\n   here, but any solution\
    \ is expected to satisfy them.  These goals are\n   fault tolerance, robustness,\
    \ interoperability, scalability, and\n   minimal specialized network equipment.\
    \  A good discussion of their\n   applicability to IETF protocols can be found\
    \ in [4].\n   Out of scope for the initial goals discussion are Quality of Service\n\
    \   (QoS) and dormant mode/paging.  While these are important functions\n   for\
    \ mobile nodes, they are not part of the base localized mobility\n   management\
    \ problem.  In addition, mobility between localized mobility\n   management domains\
    \ is not covered here.  It is assumed that this is\n   covered by the global mobility\
    \ management protocols.\n"
- title: '3.1.  Goal 1: Handover Performance Improvement'
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Goal 1: Handover Performance Improvement\n   Handover packet loss occurs\
    \ because there is usually latency between\n   when the link handover starts and\
    \ when the IP subnet configuration\n   and global mobility management signaling\
    \ completes.  During this\n   time, the mobile node is unreachable at its former\
    \ topological\n   location on the old link where correspondents are sending packets.\n\
    \   Such misrouted packets are dropped.  This aspect of handover\n   performance\
    \ optimization has been the subject of much work, both in\n   other Standards\
    \ Development Organizations (SDOs) and in the IETF, in\n   order to reduce the\
    \ latency in IP handover.  Many solutions to this\n   problem have been proposed\
    \ at the link layer and at the IP layer.\n   One aspect of this goal for localized\
    \ mobility management is that the\n   processing delay for changing the forwarding\
    \ after handover must\n   approach as closely as possible the sum of the delay\
    \ associated with\n   link-layer handover and the delay required for active IP-layer\n\
    \   movement detection, in order to avoid excessive packet loss.\n   Ideally,\
    \ if network-side link-layer support is available for handling\n   movement detection\
    \ prior to link handover or as part of the link\n   handover process, the routing\
    \ update should complete within the time\n   required for link handover.  This\
    \ delay is difficult to quantify, but\n   for voice traffic, the entire handover\
    \ delay, including Layer 2\n   handover time and IP handover time should be between\
    \ 40-70 ms to\n   avoid any degradation in call quality.  Of course, if the link-layer\n\
    \   handover latency is too high, sufficient IP-layer handover\n   performance\
    \ for good real-time service cannot be matched.\n   A goal of the NETLMM protocol\
    \ -- in networks where the link-layer\n   handover latency allows it -- is to\
    \ reduce the amount of latency in\n   IP handover, so that the combined IP-layer\
    \ and link-layer handover\n   latency is less than 70 ms.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Goal 2: Reduction in Handover-Related Signaling Volume\n   Considering\
    \ Mobile IPv6 [9] as the global mobility protocol (other\n   mobility protocols\
    \ require about the same or somewhat less), if a\n   mobile node using address\
    \ autoconfiguration is required to\n   reconfigure on every move between links,\
    \ the following signaling must\n   be performed:\n   1) Link-layer signaling required\
    \ for handover and reauthentication.\n      For example, in 802.11 [7], this is\
    \ the Reassociate message\n      together with 802.1x [8] reauthentication using\
    \ EAP.\n   2) Active IP-level movement detection, including router reachability.\n\
    \      The Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) protocol [5] uses Router\n     \
    \ Solicitation/Router Advertisement for this purpose.  In addition,\n      if\
    \ SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [3] is used and the mobile\n      node does\
    \ not have a certificate cached for the router, the mobile\n      node must use\
    \ Certification Path Solicitation/Certification Path\n      Advertisement to obtain\
    \ a certification path.\n   3) Two Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [14] REPORT\
    \ messages, one\n      for each of the solicited node multicast addresses corresponding\n\
    \      to the link local address and the global address.\n   4) Two Neighbor Solicitation\
    \ (NS) messages for duplicate address\n      detection, one for the link local\
    \ address and one for the global\n      address.  If the addresses are unique,\
    \ no response will be\n      forthcoming.\n   5) Two NS messages from the router\
    \ for address resolution of the link\n      local and global addresses, and two\
    \ Neighbor Advertisement\n      messages in response from the mobile node.\n \
    \  6) Binding Update/Binding Acknowledgement between the mobile node and\n   \
    \   home agent to update the care of address binding.\n   7) Return routability\
    \ signaling between the correspondent node and\n      mobile node to establish\
    \ the binding key, consisting of one Home\n      Test Init/Home Test and Care\
    \ of Test Init/Care of Test.\n   8) Binding Update/Binding Acknowledgement between\
    \ the correspondent\n      node and mobile node for route optimization.\n   Note\
    \ that Steps 1-2 may be necessary, even for intra-link mobility,\n   if the last-hop\
    \ link protocol doesn't provide much help for IP\n   handover.  Steps 3-5 will\
    \ be different if stateful address\n   configuration is used, since additional\
    \ messages are required to\n   obtain the address.  Steps 6-8 are only necessary\
    \ when Mobile IPv6 is\n   used.  The result is approximately 18 messages at the\
    \ IP level, where\n   the exact number depends on various specific factors, such\
    \ as whether\n   or not the mobile node has a router certificate cached before\
    \ a\n   mobile node can be ensured that it is established on a link and has\n\
    \   full IP connectivity.  In addition to handover related signaling, if\n   the\
    \ mobile node performs Mobile IPv6 route optimization, it may be\n   required\
    \ to renew its return routability key periodically (on the\n   order of every\
    \ 7 minutes), even if it is not moving, resulting in\n   additional signaling.\n\
    \   The signaling required has a large impact on the performance of\n   handover,\
    \ impacting Goal 1.  Perhaps more importantly, the aggregate\n   impact from many\
    \ mobile nodes of such signaling on expensive shared\n   links (such as wireless\
    \ where the capacity of the link cannot easily\n   be expanded) can result in\
    \ reduced last-hop link capacity for data\n   traffic.  Additionally, in links\
    \ where the end user is charged for IP\n   traffic, IP signaling is not without\
    \ cost.\n   To address the issue of signaling impact described above, the goal\
    \ is\n   that handover signaling volume from the mobile node to the network\n\
    \   should be no more than what is needed for the mobile node to perform\n   secure\
    \ IP-level movement detection, in cases where no link-layer\n   support exists.\
    \  Furthermore, NETLMM should not introduce any\n   additional signaling during\
    \ handover beyond what is required for IP-\n   level movement detection.  If link-layer\
    \ support exists for IP-level\n   movement detection, the mobile node may not\
    \ need to perform any\n   additional IP-level signaling after link-layer handover.\n"

  - "3.3.  Goal 3: Location Privacy\n   In any IP network, there is a threat that\
    \ an attacker can determine\n   the physical location of a network node from the\
    \ node's topological\n   location.  Depending on how an operator deploys their\
    \ network, an\n   operator may choose to assign subnet coverage in a way that\
    \ is\n   tightly bound to geography at some timescale, or it may choose to\n \
    \  assign it in ways in which the threat of someone finding a node\n   physically\
    \ based on its IP address is smaller.  Allowing the L2\n   attachment and L3 address\
    \ to be less tightly bound is one tool for\n   reducing this threat to location\
    \ privacy.\n   Mobility introduces an additional threat.  An attacker can track\
    \ a\n   mobile node's geographical location in real-time, if the victim\n   mobile\
    \ node must change its IP address as it moves from one subnet to\n   another through\
    \ the covered geographical area.  If the granularity of\n   the mapping between\
    \ the IP subnets and geographical area is small for\n   the particular link type\

    \ the victim in real time.\n   In order to reduce the risk from location privacy\
    \ compromises as a\n   result of IP address changes, the goal for NETLMM is to\
    \ remove the\n   need to change IP address as a mobile node moves across links\
    \ in an\n   access network.  Keeping the IP address fixed over a large\n   geographical\
    \ region fuzzes out the resolution of the mapping between\n   the IP subnets and\
    \ geographical area, regardless of how small the\n   natural deployment granularity\
    \ may be.  This reduces the chance that\n   the attacker can deduce the precise\
    \ geographic location of the mobile\n   node.\n"

  - "3.5.  Goal 5: Simplify Mobile Node Mobility Management Security by\n      Deriving\
    \ from IP Network Access and/or IP Movement Detection\n      Security\n   Localized\
    \ mobility management protocols that have host involvement\n   may require an\
    \ additional security association between the mobile\n   node and the mobility\
    \ anchor, and establishing this security\n   association may require additional\
    \ signaling between the mobile node\n   and the mobility anchor (see [13] for\
    \ an example).  The additional\n   security association requires extra signaling\
    \ and therefore extra\n   time to negotiate.  Reducing the complexity of mobile-node-to-network\n\
    \   security for localized mobility management can therefore reduce\n   barriers\
    \ to deployment and improve responsiveness.  Naturally, such\n   simplification\
    \ must not come at the expense of maintaining strong\n   security guarantees for\
    \ both the network and mobile node.\n   In NETLMM, the network (specifically,\
    \ the MAG) derives the occurrence\n   of a mobility event, requiring a routing\
    \ update for a mobile node\n   from link-layer handover signaling, or IP-layer\
    \ movement detection\n   signaling from the mobile node.  This information is\
    \ used to update\n   routing for the mobile node at the LMA.  The handover, or\
    \ movement\n   detection signaling, must provide the network with proper\n   authentication\
    \ and authorization so that the network can definitively\n   identify the mobile\
    \ node and determine its authorization.  The\n   authorization may be at the IP\
    \ level -- for example, using something\n   like SEND [3] to secure IP movement\
    \ detection signaling -- or it at\n   the link level.  Proper authentication and\
    \ authorization must be\n   implemented on link-layer handover signaling and/or\
    \ IP-level movement\n   detection signaling in order for the MAG to securely deduce\
    \ mobile\n   node movement events.  Security threats to the NETLMM protocol are\n\
    \   discussed in [2].\n   The goal is that security for NETLMM mobile node mobility\
    \ management\n   should derive from IP network access and/or IP movement detection\n\
    \   security, such as SEND or network access authentication, and not\n   require\

  - "3.7.  Goal 7: Support for Unmodified Mobile Nodes\n   In the WLAN switching market,\
    \ no modification of the software on the\n   mobile node is required to achieve\
    \ localized mobility management.\n   Being able to accommodate unmodified mobile\
    \ nodes enables a service\n   provider to offer service to as many customers as\
    \ possible, the only\n   constraint being that the customer is authorized for\
    \ network access.\n   Another advantage of minimizing mobile node software for\
    \ localized\n   mobility management is that multiple global mobility management\n\
    \   protocols can be supported.  There are a variety of global mobility\n   management\
    \ protocols that might also need support, including\n   proprietary or link technology-specific\
    \ protocols needing support for\n   backward compatibility reasons.  Within the\
    \ Internet, both Host\n   Identity Protocol (HIP) [11] and IKEv2 Mobility and\
    \ Multihoming\n   (MOBIKE) [6] are likely to need support in addition to Mobile\
    \ IPv6\n   [9], and Mobile IPv4 [12] support may also be necessary.\n   Note that\
    \ this goal does NOT mean that the mobile node has no\n   software at all associated\

    \ if it is to move from one\n   domain of edge mobility support to another and\
    \ maintain session\n   continuity, although no global mobility protocol is required\
    \ if the\n   mobile node only moves within the coverage area of the localized\n\
    \   mobility management protocol or no session continuity is required\n   during\
    \ global movement.  Also, if the last-hop link is a wireless\n   link, every wireless\
    \ link protocol requires handover support on the\n   mobile node in the physical\
    \ and medium access control layers,\n   typically in the wireless interface driver.\
    \  Information passed from\n   the medium access control layer to the IP layer\
    \ on the mobile node\n   may be necessary to trigger IP signaling for IP handover.\
    \  Such\n   movement detection support at the IP level may be required in order\n\
    \   to determine whether the mobile node's default router is still\n   reachable\
    \ after the move to a new access point has occurred at the\n   medium access control\
    \ layer.  Whether or not such support is required\n   depends on whether the medium\
    \ access control layer can completely\n   hide link movement from the IP layer.\
    \  For cellular type wireless\n   link protocols, the mobile node and network\
    \ undergo an extensive\n   negotiation at the medium access control layer prior\
    \ to handover, so\n   it may be possible to trigger a routing update without any\
    \ IP\n   protocol involvement.  However, for a wireless link protocol such as\n\
    \   IEEE 802.11 [7] in which the decision for handover is entirely in the\n  \
    \ hands of the mobile node, IP-layer movement detection signaling from\n   the\
    \ mobile node may be required to trigger a routing update.\n   The goal is that\
    \ the localized mobility management solution should be\n   able to support any\
    \ mobile node that joins the link and that has an\n   interface that can communicate\
    \ with the network, without requiring\n   localized mobility management software\

    \ that ideally no IP version-specific changes should be required\n   on the mobile\
    \ node for localized mobility, and that global mobility\n   protocols for both\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 should be supported.  Any IP\n   version-specific features should\
    \ be confined to the network protocol.\n"

  - "3.9.  Goal 9: Reuse of Existing Protocols Where Sensible\n   Many existing protocols\
    \ are available as Internet Standards upon\n   which the NETLMM protocol can be\
    \ built.  The design of the protocol\n   should have a goal to reuse existing\
    \ protocols where it makes\n   architectural and engineering sense to do so. \
    \ However, the design\n   should not attempt to reuse existing protocols where\
    \ there is no real\n   architectural or engineering reason.  For example, the\
    \ suite of\n   Internet Standards contains several good candidate protocols for\
    \ the\n   transport layer, so there is no real need to develop a new transport\n\
    \   protocol specifically for NETLMM.  Reuse is clearly a good\n   engineering\
    \ decision in this case, since backward compatibility with\n   existing protocol\
    \ stacks is important.  On the other hand, the\n   network-based, localized mobility\
    \ management functionality being\n   introduced by NETLMM is a new piece of functionality,\
    \ and therefore\n   any decision about whether to reuse an existing global mobility\n\
    \   management protocol should carefully consider whether reusing such a\n   protocol\
    \ really meets the needs of the functional architecture for\n   network-based\
    \ localized mobility management.  The case for reuse is\n   not so clear in this\
    \ case, since there is no compelling backward\n   compatibility argument.\n"

  - "3.10.  Goal 10: Localized Mobility Management Independent of Global\n       Mobility\
    \ Management\n   Localized mobility management should be implementable and deployable\n\
    \   independently of any global mobility management protocol.  This\n   enables\
    \ the choice of local and global mobility management to be made\n   independently\
    \ of particular protocols that are implemented and\n   deployed to solve the two\
    \ different sorts of mobility management\n   problems.  The operator can choose\
    \ a particular localized mobility\n   management protocol according to the specific\
    \ features of their\n   access network.  It can subsequently upgrade the localized\
    \ mobility\n   management protocol on its own, without even informing the mobile\n\
    \   nodes.  Similarly, the mobile nodes can use a global mobility\n   management\
    \ protocol that best suits their requirements, or not use\n   one at all.  Also,\
    \ a mobile node can move into a new access network\n   without having to check\
    \ that it understands the localized mobility\n   management protocol being used\
    \ there.\n   The goal is that the implementation and deployment of the localized\n\
    \   mobility management protocol should not restrict, or be restricted\n   by,\
    \ the choice of global mobility management protocol.\n"

  - "3.11.  Goal 11: Configurable Data Plane Forwarding between Local\n       Mobility\
    \ Anchor and Mobile Access Gateway\n   Different network operators may require\
    \ different types of forwarding\n   options between the LMA and the MAGs for mobile\
    \ node data plane\n   traffic.  An obvious forwarding option that has been used\
    \ in past\n   IETF localized mobility management protocols is IP-IP encapsulation\n\
    \   for bidirectional tunneling.  The tunnel endpoints are the LMA and\n   the\
    \ MAGs.  But other options are possible.  Some network deployments\n   may prefer\
    \ routing-based solutions.  Others may require security\n   tunnels using IPsec\
    \ Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)\n   encapsulation if part of the localized\
    \ mobility management domain\n   runs over a public access network and the network\
    \ operator wants to\n   protect the traffic.\n   A goal of the NETLMM protocol\
    \ is to allow the forwarding between the\n   LMA and MAGs to be configurable depending\
    \ on the particulars of the\n   network deployment.  Configurability is not expected\
    \ to be dynamic,\n   as in controlled by the arrival of a mobile node; but rather,\n\
    \   configuration is expected to be similar in timescale to configuration\n  \
    \ for routing.  The NETLMM protocol may designate a default forwarding\n   mechanism.\
    \  It is also possible that additional work may be required\n   to specify the\
    \ interaction between a particular forwarding mechanism\n   and the NETLMM protocol,\
    \ but this work is not in scope of the NETLMM\n   base protocol.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   There are two kinds of security issues involved\
    \ in network-based\n   localized mobility management: security between the mobile\
    \ node and\n   the network, and security between network elements that participate\n\
    \   in the NETLMM protocol.  The security-related goals in this document,\n  \
    \ described in Section 3.3 and 3.5, focus on the former, because those\n   are\
    \ unique to network-based mobility management. The threat analysis\n   document\
    \ [2] contains a more detailed discussion of both kinds of\n   threats, which\
    \ the protocol design must address.\n"
