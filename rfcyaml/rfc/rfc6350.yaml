  - "3.  vCard Format Specification\n   The text/vcard MIME content type (hereafter
    known as \"vCard\"; see\n   Section 10.1) contains contact information, typically
    pertaining to a\n   single contact or group of contacts.  The content consists
    of one or\n   more lines in the format given below.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Charset\n   The charset (see [RFC3536] for internationalization terminology)
      for\n   vCard is UTF-8 as defined in [RFC3629].  There is no way to override\n
      \  this.  It is invalid to specify a value other than \"UTF-8\" in the\n   \"charset\"
      MIME parameter (see Section 10.1).\n"
    title: 3.1.  Charset
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Line Delimiting and Folding\n   Individual lines within vCard are delimited
      by the [RFC5322] line\n   break, which is a CRLF sequence (U+000D followed by
      U+000A).  Long\n   logical lines of text can be split into a multiple-physical-line\n
      \  representation using the following folding technique.  Content lines\n   SHOULD
      be folded to a maximum width of 75 octets, excluding the line\n   break.  Multi-octet
      characters MUST remain contiguous.  The rationale\n   for this folding process
      can be found in [RFC5322], Section 2.1.1.\n   A logical line MAY be continued
      on the next physical line anywhere\n   between two characters by inserting a
      CRLF immediately followed by a\n   single white space character (space (U+0020)
      or horizontal tab\n   (U+0009)).  The folded line MUST contain at least one
      character.  Any\n   sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single white
      space\n   character is ignored (removed) when processing the content type.  For\n
      \  example, the line:\n     NOTE:This is a long description that exists on a
      long line.\n   can be represented as:\n     NOTE:This is a long description\n
      \      that exists on a long line.\n   It could also be represented as:\n     NOTE:This
      is a long descrip\n      tion that exists o\n      n a long line.\n   The process
      of moving from this folded multiple-line representation\n   of a property definition
      to its single-line representation is called\n   unfolding.  Unfolding is accomplished
      by regarding CRLF immediately\n   followed by a white space character (namely,
      HTAB (U+0009) or SPACE\n   (U+0020)) as equivalent to no characters at all (i.e.,
      the CRLF and\n   single white space character are removed).\n      Note: It
      is possible for very simple implementations to generate\n      improperly folded
      lines in the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet\n      sequence.  For this reason,
      implementations SHOULD unfold lines in\n      such a way as to properly restore
      the original sequence.\n      Note: Unfolding is done differently than in [RFC5322].
      \ Unfolding\n      in [RFC5322] only removes the CRLF, not the space following
      it.\n   Folding is done after any content encoding of a type value.\n   Unfolding
      is done before any decoding of a type value in a content\n   line.\n"

      \ Parameter values that are not explicitly defined as\n   being case-sensitive
      are case-insensitive.  Based on experience with\n   vCard 3 interoperability,
      it is RECOMMENDED that property and\n   parameter names be upper-case on output.\n

      group name is a syntactic convention used to indicate that all\n   property
      names prefaced with the same group name SHOULD be grouped\n   together when
      displayed by an application.  It has no other\n   significance.  Implementations
      that do not understand or support\n   grouping MAY simply strip off any text
      before a \".\" to the left of\n   the type name and present the types and values
      as normal.\n   Property cardinalities are indicated using the following notation,\n
      \  which is based on ABNF (see [RFC5234], Section 3.6):\n    +-------------+--------------------------------------------------+\n
      \   | Cardinality | Meaning                                          |\n    +-------------+--------------------------------------------------+\n

      One or more instances per vCard MAY be present.  |\n    +-------------+--------------------------------------------------+\n
      \  Properties defined in a vCard instance may have multiple values\n   depending
      on the property cardinality.  The general rule for encoding\n   multi-valued
      properties is to simply create a new content line for\n   each value (including
      the property name).  However, it should be\n   noted that some value types support
      encoding multiple values in a\n   single content line by separating the values
      with a comma \",\".  This\n   approach has been taken for several of the content
      types defined\n   below (date, time, integer, float).\n"

    - "3.4.  Property Value Escaping\n   Some properties may contain one or more values
      delimited by a COMMA\n   character (U+002C).  Therefore, a COMMA character in
      a value MUST be\n   escaped with a BACKSLASH character (U+005C), even for properties
      that\n   don't allow multiple instances (for consistency).\n   Some properties
      (e.g., N and ADR) comprise multiple fields delimited\n   by a SEMICOLON character
      (U+003B).  Therefore, a SEMICOLON in a field\n   of such a \"compound\" property
      MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH\n   character.  SEMICOLON characters in non-compound
      properties MAY be\n   escaped.  On input, an escaped SEMICOLON character is
      never a field\n   separator.  An unescaped SEMICOLON character may be a field\n
      \  separator, depending on the property in which it appears.\n   Furthermore,
      some fields of compound properties may contain a list of\n   values delimited
      by a COMMA character.  Therefore, a COMMA character\n   in one of a field's
      values MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH\n   character, even for fields that
      don't allow multiple values (for\n   consistency).  Compound properties allowing
      multiple instances MUST\n   NOT be encoded in a single content line.\n   Finally,
      BACKSLASH characters in values MUST be escaped with a\n   BACKSLASH character.
      \ NEWLINE (U+000A) characters in values MUST be\n   encoded by two characters:
      a BACKSLASH followed by either an 'n'\n   (U+006E) or an 'N' (U+004E).\n   In

        of vCard.\n      \"group\"  for a vCard representing a group of persons or
        entities.\n         The group's member entities can be other vCards or other
        types\n         of entities, such as email addresses or web sites.  A group\n
        \        vCard will usually contain MEMBER properties to specify the\n         members
        of the group, but it is not required to.  A group vCard\n         without
        MEMBER properties can be considered an abstract\n         grouping, or one
        whose members are known empirically (perhaps\n         \"IETF Participants\"
        or \"Republican U.S. Senators\").\n         All properties in a group vCard
        apply to the group as a whole,\n         and not to any particular MEMBER.
        \ For example, an EMAIL\n         property might specify the address of a
        mailing list associated\n         with the group, and an IMPP property might
        refer to a group\n         chat room.\n      \"org\"  for a vCard representing
        an organization.  An organization\n         vCard will not (in fact, MUST
        NOT) contain MEMBER properties,\n         and so these are something of a
        cross between \"individual\" and\n         \"group\".  An organization is
        a single entity, but not a person.\n         It might represent a business
        or government, a department or\n         division within a business or government,
        a club, an\n         association, or the like.\n         All properties in
        an organization vCard apply to the\n         organization as a whole, as is
        the case with a group vCard.\n         For example, an EMAIL property might
        specify the address of a\n         contact point for the organization.\n      \"location\"
        \ for a named geographical place.  A location vCard will\n         usually
        contain a GEO property, but it is not required to.  A\n         location vCard
        without a GEO property can be considered an\n         abstract location, or
        one whose definition is known empirically\n         (perhaps \"New England\"
        or \"The Seashore\").\n         All properties in a location vCard apply to
        the location\n         itself, and not with any entity that might exist at
        that\n         location.  For example, in a vCard for an office building,
        an\n         ADR property might give the mailing address for the building,\n
        \        and a TEL property might specify the telephone number of the\n         receptionist.\n
        \     An x-name.  vCards MAY include private or experimental values for\n

        \        use and are unlikely to interoperate.\n      An iana-token.  Additional
        values may be registered with IANA (see\n         Section 10.3.4).  A new
        value's specification document MUST\n         specify which properties make
        sense for that new kind of vCard\n         and which do not.\n      Implementations
        MUST support the specific string values defined\n      above.  If this property
        is absent, \"individual\" MUST be assumed\n      as the default.  If this
        property is present but the\n      implementation does not understand its
        value (the value is an\n      x-name or iana-token that the implementation
        does not support),\n      the implementation SHOULD act in a neutral way,
        which usually\n      means treating the vCard as though its kind were \"individual\".\n
        \     The presence of MEMBER properties MAY, however, be taken as an\n      indication
        that the unknown kind is an extension of \"group\".\n      Clients often need
        to visually distinguish contacts based on what\n      they represent, and
        the KIND property provides a direct way for\n      them to do so.  For example,
        when displaying contacts in a list,\n      an icon could be displayed next
        to each one, using distinctive\n      icons for the different kinds; a client
        might use an outline of a\n      single person to represent an \"individual\",
        an outline of multiple\n      people to represent a \"group\", and so on.
        \ Alternatively, or in\n      addition, a client might choose to segregate
        different kinds of\n      vCards to different panes, tabs, or selections in
        the user\n      interface.\n      Some clients might also make functional
        distinctions among the\n      kinds, ignoring \"location\" vCards for some
        purposes and\n      considering only \"location\" vCards for others.\n      When
        designing those sorts of visual and functional distinctions,\n      client
        implementations have to decide how to fit unsupported kinds\n      into the
        scheme.  What icon is used for them?  The one for\n      \"individual\"?  A
        unique one, such as an icon of a question mark?\n      Which tab do they go
        into?  It is beyond the scope of this\n      specification to answer these
        questions, but these are things\n      implementers need to consider.\n   ABNF:\n
        \    KIND-param = \"VALUE=text\" / any-param\n     KIND-value = \"individual\"
        / \"group\" / \"org\" / \"location\"\n                / iana-token / x-name\n

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   o  Internet mail is often used to transport vCards
    and is subject to\n      many well-known security attacks, including monitoring,
    replay,\n      and forgery.  Care should be taken by any directory service in\n
    \     allowing information to leave the scope of the service itself,\n      where
    any access controls or confidentiality can no longer be\n      guaranteed.  Applications
    should also take care to display\n      directory data in a \"safe\" environment.\n
    \  o  vCards can carry cryptographic keys or certificates, as described\n      in
    Section 6.8.1.\n   o  vCards often carry information that can be sensitive (e.g.,\n
    \     birthday, address, and phone information).  Although vCards have\n      no
    inherent authentication or confidentiality provisions, they can\n      easily
    be carried by any security mechanism that transfers MIME\n      objects to address
    authentication or confidentiality (e.g., S/MIME\n      [RFC5751], OpenPGP [RFC4880]).
    \ In cases where the confidentiality\n      or authenticity of information contained
    in vCard is a concern,\n      the vCard SHOULD be transported using one of these
    secure\n      mechanisms.  The KEY property (Section 6.8.1) can be used to\n      transport
    the public key used by these mechanisms.\n   o  The information in a vCard may
    become out of date.  In cases where\n      the vitality of data is important to
    an originator of a vCard, the\n      SOURCE property (Section 6.1.3) SHOULD be
    specified.  In addition,\n      the \"REV\" type described in Section 6.7.4 can
    be specified to\n      indicate the last time that the vCard data was updated.\n
    \  o  Many vCard properties may be used to transport URIs.  Please refer\n      to
    [RFC3986], Section 7, for considerations related to URIs.\n"

    - "10.2.  Registering New vCard Elements\n   This section defines the process
      for registering new or modified\n   vCard elements (i.e., properties, parameters,
      value data types, and\n   values) with IANA.\n"
    - contents:
      - "10.2.1.  Registration Procedure\n   The IETF has created a mailing list,
        vcarddav@ietf.org, which can be\n   used for public discussion of vCard element
        proposals prior to\n   registration.  Use of the mailing list is strongly
        encouraged.  The\n   IESG has appointed a designated expert who will monitor
        the\n   vcarddav@ietf.org mailing list and review registrations.\n   Registration
        of new vCard elements MUST be reviewed by the designated\n   expert and published
        in an RFC.  A Standards Track RFC is REQUIRED\n   for the registration of
        new value data types that modify existing\n   properties.  A Standards Track
        RFC is also REQUIRED for registration\n   of vCard elements that modify vCard
        elements previously documented in\n   a Standards Track RFC.\n   The registration
        procedure begins when a completed registration\n   template, defined in the
        sections below, is sent to vcarddav@ietf.org\n   and iana@iana.org.  Within
        two weeks, the designated expert is\n   expected to tell IANA and the submitter
        of the registration whether\n   the registration is approved, approved with
        minor changes, or\n   rejected with cause.  When a registration is rejected
        with cause, it\n   can be re-submitted if the concerns listed in the cause
        are\n   addressed.  Decisions made by the designated expert can be appealed\n
        \  to the IESG Applications Area Director, then to the IESG.  They\n   follow
        the normal appeals procedure for IESG decisions.\n   Once the registration
        procedure concludes successfully, IANA creates\n   or modifies the corresponding
        record in the vCard registry.  The\n   completed registration template is
        discarded.\n   An RFC specifying new vCard elements MUST include the completed\n
        \  registration templates, which MAY be expanded with additional\n   information.
        \ These completed templates are intended to go in the\n   body of the document,
        not in the IANA Considerations section.\n   Finally, note that there is an
        XML representation for vCard defined\n   in [RFC6351].  An XML representation
        SHOULD be defined for new vCard\n   elements.\n"

      - "10.2.2.  Vendor Namespace\n   The vendor namespace is used for vCard elements
        associated with\n   commercially available products.  \"Vendor\" or \"producer\"
        are\n   construed as equivalent and very broadly in this context.\n   A registration
        may be placed in the vendor namespace by anyone who\n   needs to interchange
        files associated with the particular product.\n   However, the registration
        formally belongs to the vendor or\n   organization handling the vCard elements
        in the namespace being\n   registered.  Changes to the specification will
        be made at their\n   request, as discussed in subsequent sections.\n   vCard
        elements belonging to the vendor namespace will be\n   distinguished by the
        \"VND-\" prefix.  This is followed by an IANA-\n   registered Private Enterprise
        Number (PEN), a dash, and a vCard\n   element designation of the vendor's
        choosing (e.g., \"VND-123456-\n   MUDPIE\").\n   While public exposure and
        review of vCard elements to be registered\n   in the vendor namespace are
        not required, using the vcarddav@ietf.org\n   mailing list for review is strongly
        encouraged to improve the quality\n   of those specifications.  Registrations
        in the vendor namespace may\n   be submitted directly to the IANA.\n"
