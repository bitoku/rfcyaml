- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   One of the many checks that mail servers carry out is to\
    \ query DNS\n   whitelists (DNSWLs).  That method is fully discussed in [RFC5782].\n\
    \   The DNS [RFC1034] lookup is based on the connecting client's IP\n   address,\
    \ IPv4 or IPv6, and returns zero or more A records.  The\n   latter are IPv4 IP\
    \ addresses in the range 127.0.0.0/8.  Depending on\n   the query, TXT records\
    \ with varying content can also be retrieved.\n   Query examples are given in\
    \ Appendix A.\n   Since the IP address is known as soon as the connection is accepted,\n\
    \   this check can occur very early in an SMTP transaction.  Its result\n   can\
    \ be used to counterweight policies that typically occur at early\n   stages too,\
    \ such as the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) (the last\n   paragraph of Appendix\
    \ D.3 of [RFC7208] is also illustrated in\n   Appendix A).  In addition, the result\
    \ of a DNSWL lookup can be used\n   at later stages; for example, a delivery agent\
    \ can use it to learn\n   the trustworthiness of a mail relay in order to estimate\
    \ the\n   spamminess of an email message.  The latter possibility needs a place\n\
    \   to collect query results for downstream use, which is precisely what\n   the\
    \ Authentication-Results header field aims to provide.\n   Results often contain\
    \ additional data, encoded according to DNSWL-\n   specific criteria.  The method\
    \ described in this document considers\n   only whitelists -- one of the major\
    \ branches described by [RFC5782].\n   There are also blacklists/blocklists (DNSBLs)\
    \ and combined lists.\n   Since they all have the same structure, the abbreviation\
    \ DNSxL is\n   used to mean any.  The core procedures of a Mail Transfer Agent\
    \ (MTA)\n   tend to be quite general, leaving particular cases to be handled by\n\
    \   add-on modules.  In the case of combined lists, the boundary MTA (see\n  \
    \ [RFC5598]), which carries out the check and possibly stores the\n   result,\
    \ has to be able to discern at least the color of each entry,\n   as that is required\
    \ to make accept/reject decisions.  This document\n   provides for storing the\
    \ result when the DNSxL record to be reported\n   is a whitelisting one.\n   Data\
    \ conveyed in A and TXT records can be stored as properties of the\n   method.\
    \  The meaning of such data varies widely at the mercy of the\n   list operator;\
    \ hence, the queried zone has to be stored as well.\n   Mail site operators who\
    \ configure their MTAs to query specific DNWSLs\n   marry the policies of those\
    \ lists, as, in effect, they become\n   tantamount to local policies, albeit outsourced.\
    \  Downstream agents\n   who know DNSWL-specific encoding and understand the meaning\
    \ of that\n   data can use it to make delivery or display decisions.  For example,\n\
    \   a mail filter that detects heuristic evidence of a scam can\n   counterweight\
    \ such information with the trustworthiness score encoded\n   in the A response\
    \ so as to protect against false positives.  Mail\n   User Agents (MUAs) can display\
    \ those results or use them to decide\n   how to report abusive messages, if configured\
    \ to do so.\n   This document describes a usage of TXT fields consistent with\
    \ other\n   authentication methods, namely to serve the domain name in the TXT\n\
    \   record.  That way, a downstream filter could also consider whether\n   the\
    \ sending agent is aligned with the author domain, with semantics\n   similar\
    \ to [RFC7489].\n   At the time of this writing, this method is implemented by\
    \ Courier-\n   MTA [Courier-MTA].  An outline of the implementation is given in\n\
    \   Appendix B.\n"
- title: 2.  Method Details
  contents:
  - "2.  Method Details\n   The result of the method states how the query did, up\
    \ to the\n   interpretation of the returned data.\n   The method has four possible\
    \ results:\n   pass:        The query successfully returned applicable records.\n\
    \                This result is usually accompanied by one or both of the\n  \
    \              policy properties described below.  Since the list is\n       \
    \         configured as a DNSWL, agents unable to interpret list-\n          \
    \      specific properties can still derive a positive value\n               \
    \ from the fact that the sender is whitelisted.\n   none:        The query worked\
    \ but yielded no A record or returned\n                NXDOMAIN, so the sender\
    \ is not whitelisted.\n   temperror:   The DNS evaluation could not be completed\
    \ due to some\n                error that is likely transient in nature, such\
    \ as a\n                temporary DNS error (e.g., a DNS RCODE of 2, commonly\n\
    \                known as SERVFAIL) or other error condition.  A later\n     \
    \           attempt may produce a final result.\n   permerror:   The DNS evaluation\
    \ cannot work because test entries\n                don't work (that is, DNSWL\
    \ is broken) or because queries\n                are over quota (reported by a\
    \ DNS RCODE of 5, commonly\n                known as REFUSED, or by a DNSWL-specific\
    \ property\n                (policy.ip, defined below) with the same meaning).\
    \  A\n                later attempt is unlikely to produce a final result.\n \
    \               Human intervention is required.\n   Note that there is no \"fail\"\
    \ result.\n   The following ptype.property items define how the data provided\
    \ by\n   the whitelist lookup can be saved.\n   dns.zone:    DNSWL query root\
    \ domain, which defines the meaning of\n                the policy.ip property\
    \ below.  Note that an MTA can use\n                a local mirror with a different\
    \ name.  The name stored\n                here has to be the best available reference\
    \ for all\n                foreseeable downstream consumers.  Setting dns.zone\
    \ to\n                the global zone makes the result intelligible even if\n\
    \                the message is handed outside of the internal network.\n   policy.ip:\
    \   The bit mask value received in type A response, in\n                dotted\
    \ quad notation.  Multiple entries can be arranged\n                in a quoted,\
    \ comma-separated list (quotes are necessary\n                because commas are\
    \ not allowed in a token).\n   policy.txt:  The TXT record, if any.  Multiple\
    \ records are\n                concatenated in the usual way (explained, for example,\n\
    \                in Section 3.3 of [RFC7208]).  See Section 3 for the\n      \
    \          resulting content and query options.\n   dns.sec:     This is a generic\
    \ property stating whether the relevant\n                data was validated using\
    \ DNSSEC [RFC4033].  For the\n                present method, the relevant data\
    \ consists of the\n                reported policy properties above or, if the\
    \ method\n                result is \"none\", its nonexistence.  This property\
    \ has\n                three possible values:\n                yes:  DNSSEC validation\
    \ confirms the integrity of data.\n                      Section 5.2 considers\
    \ how that is related to the\n                      DNS response.\n          \
    \      no:   The data is not signed.  See Section 5.2.\n                na:  \
    \ Not applicable.  No DNSSEC validation can be\n                      performed,\
    \ possibly because the lookup is run\n                      through a different\
    \ means than a security-aware\n                      DNS resolver.  This does\
    \ not necessarily imply\n                      less security.  In particular,\
    \ \"na\" is used if the\n                      data was downloaded in bulk and\
    \ then loaded on a\n                      local nameserver, which is the case\
    \ of an MTA\n                      querying a local zone different from the reported\n\
    \                      dns.zone.  DNS errors, including validation\n         \
    \             errors, can also report \"na\".  This is also the\n            \
    \          value assumed by default.\n"
- title: 3.  TXT Record Contents
  contents:
  - "3.  TXT Record Contents\n   According to [RFC5782], TXT records describe the\
    \ reason why IP\n   addresses are listed in a DNSWL.  An example of a DNSWL whose\
    \ TXT\n   records contain the domain name of the organization assignee of the\n\
    \   sending IP is given in Appendix B.  The domain name would correspond\n   to\
    \ the DNS domain name used by or within the Administrative\n   Management Domain\
    \ (ADMD) operating the relevant MTA, sometimes called\n   the \"organizational\
    \ domain\".  In that case, the authentication\n   provided by this method is equivalent\
    \ to a DomainKeys Identified Mail\n   (DKIM) signature [RFC6376] or an SPF check\
    \ host [RFC7208], if the\n   DNSWL is trusted.\n   According to a DNSWL's policy,\
    \ attributing responsibility of an IP\n   address to an organization may require\
    \ something more than a mere PTR\n   record consistency.  If no domain names can\
    \ be responsibly associated\n   to a given IP address, for example, because the\
    \ IP address was added\n   without direct involvement of the organization concerned,\
    \ DNSWLs can\n   use a subdomain of .INVALID [RFC2606] where the leftmost label\
    \ hints\n   at why an address is whitelisted.  For example, if the address\n \
    \  192.0.2.38 was added by the list managers solely based on their\n   knowledge,\
    \ the corresponding TXT record might be AUTOPROMOTED.INVALID\n   so as to avoid\
    \ explicitly identifying an entity that didn't opt in.\n   Following the example\
    \ of Multicast DNS (see the second paragraph of\n   Section 16 of [RFC6762]),\
    \ names containing non-ASCII characters can\n   be encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629]\
    \ using the Normalization Form C [NFC],\n   as described in \"Unicode Format for\
    \ Network Interchange\" [RFC5198].\n   Inclusion of unaltered UTF-8 TXT values\
    \ in the header entails an\n   environment compatible with Email Address Internationalization\
    \ (EAI)\n   [RFC6530].\n   DNS queries with a QTYPE of ANY may lead to inconsistent\
    \ replies,\n   depending on the cache status.  In addition, ANY is not \"all\"\
    , and\n   the provisions for queries that have QTYPE=ANY [RFC8482] don't cover\n\
    \   DNSxLs.  A mail server can issue two simultaneous queries, A and TXT.\n  \
    \ Otherwise, a downstream filter can issue a TXT query on its own, if\n   it knows\
    \ that an A query was successful and that the DNSWL serves\n   useful TXT records.\
    \  It is unlikely that TXT records exist if a query\n   for QTYPE A brought a\
    \ result of \"none\".\n"

- title: 5.1.  Over-Quota Signaling
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Over-Quota Signaling\n   Some DNSWLs that provide for free access below\
    \ a given quota are\n   known to return special codes to signal that the quota\
    \ has been\n   exceeded (for example, 127.0.0.255).  If the MTA cannot interpret\n\
    \   that value, that case results in a false positive.  It can accept\n   messages\
    \ that it would otherwise reject.  A DNSWL-specific module\n   would realize this\
    \ fact and call for human intervention.\n   Returning an RCODE 5 (REFUSED) conveys\
    \ the concept that the query is\n   \"unauthorized\" and human intervention required.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Security of DNSSEC Validation
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Security of DNSSEC Validation\n   The dns.sec property is meant to be as\
    \ secure as DNSSEC results.  It\n   makes sense to use it in an environment where\
    \ the DNSSEC validation\n   can succeed.\n   Section 7 of [RFC4033] examines various\
    \ ways of setting up a stub\n   resolver that either validates DNSSEC locally\
    \ or trusts the\n   validation provided through a secure channel.  For a different\
    \ class,\n   it is possible to set up a dedicated, caching, DNSSEC-enabled\n \
    \  resolver reachable by the mail server through interprocess\n   communication\
    \ on 127.0.0.1.  In such cases, the property dns.sec=yes\n   corresponds to the\
    \ Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the DNS response\n   header.\n   When the response\
    \ contains no DNSSEC data, a security-aware resolver\n   seeks a signed proof\
    \ of the nonexistence of a DS record at some\n   delegation point.  If no error\
    \ is returned, the zone is unsigned and\n   dns.sec=no can be set.  The Security\
    \ Considerations section of\n   [RFC3225] states:\n   |  The absence of DNSSEC\
    \ data in response to a query with the DO bit\n   |  set MUST NOT be taken to\
    \ mean no security information is available\n   |  for that zone as the response\
    \ may be forged or a non-forged\n   |  response of an altered (DO bit cleared)\
    \ query.\n   If the application verifies the DNSSEC signatures on its own, it\n\
    \   effectively behaves like a validating resolver and hence can set\n   dns.sec\
    \ correspondingly.\n   When the data is downloaded in bulk and made available\
    \ on a trusted\n   channel without using DNSSEC, the application sets dns.sec=na\
    \ or not\n   at all.  For example, consider DNSWLs that publish bulk versions\
    \ of\n   their data duly signed using OpenPGP [RFC4880].  It is the\n   responsibility\
    \ of system administrators to authenticate the data by\n   downloading and validating\
    \ the signature.  The result of such\n   validation is not reported using dns.sec.\n"

    \ after the\n   production of the Authentication-Results header field.\n   In\
    \ addition, the usual caveats apply about importing text from\n   external online\
    \ sources.  Although queried DNSWLs are well-known,\n   trusted entities, it is\

    \ which forwarded\n   it to the final MTA.  The mail path was not arranged beforehand\
    \ with\n   the involved MTAs; it emerged spontaneously.  This message would not\n\
    \   have made it to the target without whitelisting, because:\n   *  the author\
    \ domain published a strict SPF policy (-all),\n   *  the forwarder did not alter\
    \ the bounce address, and\n   *  the target usually honors reject on fail, according\
    \ to Section 8.4\n      of [RFC7208].\n   However, the target also implemented\
    \ the last paragraph of\n   Appendix D.3 of [RFC7208].  Its behavior hinges on\
    \ the following DNS\n   entries:\n     1.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.d.b.8.2.0.0.1.\n\

    \                          editorial reasons)\n   If mail.fwd.example had connected\
    \ from address 192.0.2.1, then the\n   query name would have been \"1.2.0.192.list.dnswl.example\"\
    .  See full\n   description in [RFC5782].\n   At connection time, because the\
    \ remote IP address is whitelisted, the\n   target MTA did not reject the message\
    \ before DATA.  Instead, it\n   recorded the SPF fail result and indicated the\
    \ local policy mechanism\n   that was applied in order to override that result.\
    \  Subsequent\n   filtering verified DKIM [RFC6376].\n   At later stages, mail\
    \ filters can reject or quarantine the message\n   based on its content.  A deeper\
    \ knowledge of the policy values\n   obtained from dnswl.example allows interpreting\
    \ the values of\n   policy.ip and weighing them against other factors so as to\
    \ make\n   better decisions.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  Known Implementation
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Known Implementation\n   Implementation details mentioned in this\
    \ section have been stable for\n   several years.  Yet, this description is necessarily\
    \ superficial,\n   version dependent, and subject to change.\n   Courier-MTA [Courier-MTA]\
    \ can be configured to look up DNSBLs and\n   DNSWLs, with similar command-line\
    \ switches:\n   -block=zone[=displayzone][,var[/n.n.n.n][,msg]]\n   -allow=zone[=displayzone][,var[/n.n.n.n[,]]]\n\
    \   \"zone\" is the zone to be queried.\n   \"displayzone\" is only used for -allow;\
    \ it is the value to be set in\n   the dns.zone property.\n   \"var\" stands for\
    \ the environment variable whose existence triggers a\n   special action.  The\
    \ default variable names result in a conventional\n   behavior implemented by\
    \ Courier-MTA.  By setting different\n   environment variables, users can customize\
    \ the behavior.\n   Conventional behavior differs widely between -block and -allow.\
    \  The\n   former rejects the message; the latter produces Authentication-\n \
    \  Results header fields.\n   The n.n.n.n IP address requires a precise A record\
    \ response.  If not\n   given, any response results in setting the corresponding\
    \ variable.\n   If given, variables are set only if the response matches exactly.\n\
    \   Such syntax provides for a very limited interpretation of the\n   information\
    \ encoded in A records.  However, it is considered to be\n   too complicated already.\
    \  Even specifying a range, an enumeration of\n   values, or a regular expression\
    \ would require something beyond what a\n   normal user would be willing to manage.\n\
    \   Finally, the trailing message, which overrides the 5xx SMTP reply for\n  \
    \ -block, is not used for -allow, except that its mere presence\n   requires querying\
    \ TXT records to be registered in policy.txt.\n   SPF is part of Courier-MTA's\
    \ core.  It is configured separately and\n   provides for an \"allowok\" keyword\
    \ to indicate the choice to override\n   rejection in case of SPF failure and\
    \ -allow whitelisting.\n   A customary whitelist is defined by DNSWL.org [DNSWL].\
    \  It serves A\n   records encoded as follows:\n   1st octet:  127.\n   2nd octet:\
    \  0.\n   3rd octet:  Category of business, 15 values.\n   4th octet:  Trustworthiness/score,\
    \ 4 values.\n   They also serve TXT records containing the domain name followed\
    \ by a\n   URL pointing to further information about the relevant organization,\n\
    \   such as what other IP addresses of theirs are being whitelisted.\n   They\
    \ don't use UTF-8.\n   DNSWL.org provides for free registration and free access\
    \ below\n   100,000 queries per day.  They use a special return code, 127.0.0.255\n\
    \   as exemplified above, to signal that the quota has been exceeded.\n   Although\
    \ Courier-MTA itself does not recognize this return code, it\n   has a mail filter\
    \ (zdkimfilter, named after its main usage) that hard\n   codes recognition of\
    \ this code and the code for trustworthiness in\n   the 4th octet.\n"
- title: Appendix C.  Future Possibilities of the 'dns' ptype
  contents:
  - "Appendix C.  Future Possibilities of the 'dns' ptype\n   The description of the\
    \ new ptype proposed in Section 4.2 says, \"The\n   property being reported belongs\
    \ to the Domain Name System.\"  That\n   definition can broadly include any tag\
    \ found in a domain's TXT\n   record.  For example, designers of authentication\
    \ methods can agree\n   that within a resinfo of a given method, any dns ptype\
    \ refers to tags\n   in the relevant DNS record, unless otherwise specified. \
    \ So one could\n   have, say:\n   Authentication-Results: example.com;\n     spf=pass\
    \ smtp.mailfrom=example.net dns.sec=y;\n     dkim=pass header.i=@example.org header.b=jIvx30NG\
    \ dns.s=tlsrpt\n   While dns.sec is defined above, albeit not for the spf method,\
    \ the\n   use of tlsrpt in the DKIM record is exemplified in Section 3 of\n  \
    \ [RFC8460].  The tag s= is part of the DKIM TXT record, not to be\n   confused\
    \ with the selector s=, which is part of a DKIM signature.\n   Just like the latter\
    \ can be reported as header.s because the DKIM\n   header field is in the message\
    \ header, it may make sense to report\n   the former as dns.s because the DKIM\
    \ DNS record is in the DNS.\n   NOTE: This is only a hint at what may become a\
    \ consistent naming\n   convention around the new ptype.  In any case, any new\
    \ property using\n   this ptype requires its own formal definition.  This document\
    \ does\n   NOT define the property dns.s=, let alone the service tlsrpt.\n"
