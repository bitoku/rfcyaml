  - "1.  Introduction\n   In BGPsec, a key rollover (or re-key) is the process of\
    \ changing a\n   router's BGPsec key pair (or key pairs), issuing the corresponding\n\
    \   new BGPsec router certificate, and (if the old certificate is still\n   valid)\
    \ revoking the old certificate.  This process will need to\n   happen at regular\
    \ intervals, normally due to policies of the local\n   network.  This document\
    \ describes a safe rollover process that\n   results in a BGPsec receiver always\
    \ having the needed verification\n   keys.  Certification Practice Statement (CPS)\
    \ documents may reference\n   this memo.  This memo only addresses changing of\
    \ a router's BGPsec\n   key pair within the RPKI.  Refer to [RFC6489] for a procedure\
    \ to roll\n   over RPKI Certification Authority key pairs.\n   When a router receives\
    \ or creates a new key pair (using a key\n   provisioning mechanism), this key\
    \ pair will be used to sign new\n   BGPsec UPDATE messages [RFC8205] that are\
    \ originated at or that\n   transit through the BGP speaker.  Additionally, the\
    \ BGP speaker will\n   refresh its outbound BGPsec UPDATE messages to include\
    \ a signature\n   using the new key (replacing the old key).  When the rollover\
    \ process\n   finishes, the old BGPsec router certificate (and its key) will no\n\
    \   longer be valid; thus, any BGPsec UPDATE message that includes a\n   signature\
    \ performed by the old key will be invalid.  Consequently, if\n   the router does\
    \ not refresh its outbound BGPsec UPDATE messages,\n   previously sent routing\
    \ information may be treated as unauthenticated\n   after the rollover process\
    \ is finished.  Therefore, it is extremely\n   important that new BGPsec router\
    \ certificates have been distributed\n   throughout the RPKI before the router\
    \ begins signing BGPsec UPDATE\n   messages with a new private key.\n   It is\
    \ also important for an AS to minimize the BGPsec router key-\n   rollover interval\
    \ (i.e., the period between the time when an AS\n   distributes a BGPsec router\
    \ certificate with a new public key and the\n   time a BGPsec router begins to\
    \ use its new private key).  This can be\n   due to a need for a BGPsec router\
    \ to distribute BGPsec UPDATE\n   messages signed with a new private key in order\
    \ to invalidate BGPsec\n   UPDATE messages signed with the old private key.  In\
    \ particular, if\n   the AS suspects that a stale BGPsec UPDATE message is being\n\
    \   distributed instead of the most recently signed attribute, it can\n   cause\
    \ the stale BGPsec UPDATE messages to be invalidated by\n   completing a key-rollover\
    \ procedure.  The BGPsec router rollover\n   interval can be minimized when an\
    \ automated certificate provisioning\n   process such as Enrollment over Secure\
    \ Transport (EST) [RFC7030] is\n   used.\n   \"Security Requirements for BGP Path\
    \ Validation\" [RFC7353] also\n   describes the need for protecting against suppression\
    \ of BGP UPDATE\n   messages with Withdrawn Routes or replay of BGP UPDATE messages,\
    \ such\n   as controlling BGPsec's window of exposure to such attacks.  The\n\
    \   BGPsec router certificate rollover method in this document can be\n   used\
    \ to achieve this goal.\n   In [RFC8635], the \"operator-driven\" method is introduced,\
    \ in which a\n   key pair can be shared among multiple BGP speakers.  In this\n\
    \   scenario, the rollover of the corresponding BGPsec router certificate\n  \
    \ will impact all the BGP speakers sharing the same private key.\n"

- title: 3.  Key Rollover in BGPsec
  contents:
  - "3.  Key Rollover in BGPsec\n   A BGPsec router certificate SHOULD be replaced\
    \ when the following\n   events occur, and it can be replaced for any other reason\
    \ at the\n   discretion of the AS responsible for the BGPsec router certificate.\n\
    \   Scheduled rollover:  BGPsec router certificates have an expiration\n     \
    \    date (NotValidAfter) that requires a frequent rollover process\n        \
    \ to refresh certificates or issue new certificates.  The\n         validity period\
    \ for these certificates is typically expressed\n         in the CA's CPS document.\n\
    \   Router certificate field changes:  Information contained in a BGPsec\n   \
    \      router certificate (such as the Autonomous System Number (ASN)\n      \
    \   or the Subject) may need to be changed.\n   Emergency router key rollover:\
    \  Some special circumstances (such as a\n         compromised key) may require\
    \ the replacement of a BGPsec router\n         certificate.\n   Protection against\
    \ withdrawal suppression and replay attacks:  An AS\n         may determine that\
    \ withdrawn BGPsec UPDATE messages are being\n         propagated instead of the\
    \ most recently propagated BGPsec\n         UPDATE messages.  Changing the BGPsec\
    \ router signing key,\n         distributing a new BGPsec router certificate,\
    \ and revoking the\n         old BGPsec router certificate will invalidate the\
    \ replayed\n         BGPsec UPDATE messages.\n   In some of these cases, it is\
    \ possible to generate a new certificate\n   without changing the key pair.  This\
    \ practice simplifies the rollover\n   process as the BGP speakers receiving BGPsec\
    \ UPDATE messages do not\n   even need to be aware of the change of certificate.\
    \  However, not\n   replacing the certificate key for a long period of time increases\
    \ the\n   risk that a compromised router private key may be used by an attacker\n\
    \   to deliver unauthorized or false BGPsec UPDATE messages.\n   Distributing\
    \ the old public key in a new certificate is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED when the rollover\
    \ event is due to a compromised key or\n   when it is suspected that withdrawn\
    \ BGPsec UPDATE messages are being\n   distributed.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Rollover Process
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Rollover Process\n   The key-rollover process is dependent on the key provisioning\n\
    \   mechanisms adopted by an AS [RFC8635].  An automatic provisioning\n   mechanism\
    \ such as EST will allow procedures for router key management\n   to include automatic\
    \ re-keying methods with minimum development cost.\n   A safe BGPsec router key-rollover\
    \ process is as follows.\n   1.  New Certificate Publication: The first step in\
    \ the rollover\n       mechanism is to publish the new certificate.  If required,\
    \ a new\n       key pair will be generated for the BGPsec router.  A new\n   \
    \    certificate will be generated and the certificate will be\n       published\
    \ at the appropriate RPKI repository publication point.\n       The details of\
    \ this process will vary as they depend on 1)\n       whether the keys are assigned\
    \ per-BGPsec speaker or shared among\n       multiple BGPsec speakers, 2) whether\
    \ the keys are generated on\n       each BGPsec speaker or in a central location,\
    \ and 3) whether the\n       RPKI repository is locally or externally hosted.\n\
    \   2.  Staging Period: A staging period will be required from the time a\n  \
    \     new certificate is published in the global RPKI repository until\n     \
    \  the time it is fetched by RPKI caches around the globe.  The\n       exact\
    \ minimum staging time will be dictated by the conventional\n       interval chosen\
    \ between repository fetches.  If rollovers will be\n       done more frequently,\
    \ an administrator can provision two\n       certificates for every router concurrently\
    \ with different valid\n       start times.  In this case, when the rollover operation\
    \ is\n       needed, the relying parties around the globe would already have\n\
    \       the new router public keys.  However, if an administrator has not\n  \
    \     previously provisioned the next certificate, implementing a\n       staging\
    \ period may not be possible during emergency key rollover.\n       If there is\
    \ no staging period, routing may be disrupted due to\n       the inability of\
    \ a BGPsec router to validate BGPsec UPDATE\n       messages signed with a new\
    \ private key.\n   3.  Twilight: In this step, the BGPsec speaker holding the\
    \ rolled-\n       over private key will stop using the old key for signing and\
    \ will\n       start using the new key.  Also, the router will generate\n    \
    \   appropriate refreshed BGPsec UPDATE messages, just as in the\n       typical\
    \ operation of refreshing outbound BGP polices.  This\n       operation may generate\
    \ a great number of BGPsec UPDATE messages.\n       A BGPsec speaker may vary\
    \ the distribution of BGPsec UPDATE\n       messages in this step for every peer\
    \ in order to distribute the\n       system load (e.g., skewing the rollover for\
    \ different peers by a\n       few minutes each would be sufficient and effective).\n\
    \   4.  Certificate Revocation: This is an optional step, but it SHOULD\n    \
    \   be taken when the goal is to invalidate BGPsec UPDATE messages\n       signed\
    \ with the old key.  Reasons to invalidate old BGPsec UPDATE\n       messages\
    \ include (a) the AS has reason to believe that the router\n       signing key\
    \ has been compromised, and (b) the AS needs to\n       invalidate already-propagated\
    \ BGPsec UPDATE messages signed with\n       the old key.  As part of the rollover\
    \ process, a CA MAY decide to\n       revoke the old certificate by publishing\
    \ its serial number on the\n       CA's Certificate Revocation List (CRL).  Alternatively,\
    \ the CA\n       will just let the old certificate expire and not revoke it. \
    \ This\n       choice will depend on the reasons that motivated the rollover\n\
    \       process.\n   5.  RPKI-Router Protocol Withdrawals: At the expiration of\
    \ the old\n       certificate's validation, the RPKI relying parties around the\n\
    \       globe will need to communicate to their router peers that the old\n  \
    \     certificate's public key is no longer valid (e.g., using the\n       RPKI-Router\
    \ Protocol described in [RFC8210]).  A router's\n       reaction to a message\
    \ indicating withdrawal of a router key in\n       the RPKI-Router Protocol SHOULD\
    \ include the removal of any RIB\n       entries (i.e., BGPsec updates) signed\
    \ with that key and the\n       generation of the corresponding BGP UPDATE message\
    \ with Withdrawn\n       Routes (either implicit or explicit).\n   This rollover\
    \ mechanism depends on the existence of an automatic\n   provisioning process\
    \ for BGPsec router certificates.  It requires a\n   staging mechanism based on\
    \ the RPKI propagation time (at the time of\n   writing, this is typically a 24-hour\
    \ period), and an AS is REQUIRED\n   to re-sign all originated and transited BGPsec\
    \ UPDATE messages that\n   were previously signed with the old key.\n   The first\
    \ two steps (New Certificate Publication and Staging Period)\n   may happen in\
    \ advance of the rest of the process.  This will allow a\n   network operator\
    \ to perform its subsequent key rollover in an\n   efficient and timely manner.\n\
    \   When a new BGPsec router certificate is generated without changing\n   its\
    \ key, steps 3 (Twilight) and 5 (RPKI-Router Protocol Withdrawals)\n   SHOULD\
    \ NOT be executed.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  BGPsec Router Key Rollover as a Measure against Replay Attacks\n   There\
    \ are two typical generic measures to mitigate replay attacks in\n   any protocol:\
    \ the addition of a timestamp or the addition of a serial\n   number.  However,\
    \ neither BGP nor BGPsec provides these measures.\n   The timestamp approach was\
    \ originally proposed for BGPsec\n   [PROTECTION-DESIGN-DISCUSSION] but was later\
    \ dropped in favor of the\n   key-rollover approach.  This section discusses the\
    \ use of key\n   rollover as a measure to mitigate replay attacks.\n"
- title: 4.1.  BGP UPDATE Window of Exposure Requirement
  contents:
  - "4.1.  BGP UPDATE Window of Exposure Requirement\n   The need to limit the vulnerability\
    \ to replay attacks is described in\n   Section 4.3 of [RFC7353].  One important\
    \ comment is that during a\n   window of exposure, a replay attack is effective\
    \ only in very\n   specific circumstances: there is a downstream topology change\
    \ that\n   makes the signed AS path no longer current, and the topology change\n\
    \   makes the replayed route preferable to the route associated with the\n   new\
    \ update.  In particular, if there is no topology change at all,\n   then no security\
    \ threat comes from a replay of a BGPsec UPDATE\n   message because the signed\
    \ information is still valid.\n   \"BGPsec Operational Considerations\" [RFC8207]\
    \ gives some idea of\n   requirements for the size of the window of exposure to\

    \ a\n   day or longer.\n"
- title: 4.2.  BGPsec Key Rollover as a Mechanism to Protect against Replay
  contents:
  - "4.2.  BGPsec Key Rollover as a Mechanism to Protect against Replay\n      Attacks\n\
    \   Since the window requirement is on the order of a day (as documented\n   in\
    \ [RFC8207]) and the BGP speaker performing re-keying is the edge\n   router of\
    \ the origin AS, it is feasible to use key rollover to\n   mitigate replays. \
    \ In this case, it is important to complete the full\n   process (i.e., the old\
    \ and new certificates do not share the same\n   key).  By re-keying, an AS is\
    \ letting the BGPsec router certificate\n   validation time be a type of \"timestamp\"\
    \ to mitigate replay attacks.\n   However, the use of frequent key rollovers comes\
    \ with an additional\n   administrative cost and risks if the process fails. \
    \ As documented in\n   [RFC8207], re-keying should be supported by automatic tools,\
    \ and for\n   the great majority of the Internet, it will be done with good lead\n\
    \   time to ensure that the public key corresponding to the new router\n   certificate\
    \ will be available to validate the corresponding BGPsec\n   UPDATE messages when\
    \ received.\n   If a transit AS also originates BGPsec UPDATE messages for its\
    \ own\n   prefixes and it wishes to mitigate replay attacks on those prefixes,\n\
    \   then the transit AS SHOULD be provisioned with two unique key pairs\n   and\
    \ certificates.  One of the key pairs is used to sign BGPsec UPDATE\n   messages\
    \ for prefixes originated from the transit AS, and it can have\n   a replay protection\
    \ policy applied to it.  The other key pair is used\n   to sign BGPsec UPDATE\
    \ messages in transit and SHOULD NOT have a\n   replay protection policy applied\
    \ to it.  Because the transit AS is\n   not likely to know or care about the policy\
    \ of origin ASes elsewhere,\n   there is no value gained by the transit AS performing\
    \ key rollovers\n   to mitigate replay attacks against prefixes originated elsewhere.\
    \  If\n   the transit AS were instead to perform replay protection for all\n \
    \  updates that it signs, its process for key rollovers would generate a\n   large\
    \ number of BGPsec UPDATE messages, even in the complete Default-\n   Free Zone\
    \ (DFZ).  Therefore, it is best to let each AS independently\n   manage the replay\
    \ attack vulnerability window for the prefixes it\n   originates.\n   Advantages\
    \ to re-keying as a replay attack protection mechanism are\n   as follows:\n \
    \  1.  All expiration policies are maintained in the RPKI.\n   2.  Much of the\
    \ additional administrative cost is paid by the\n       provider that wants to\
    \ protect its infrastructure, as it bears\n       the cost of creating and initiating\
    \ distribution of new router\n       key pairs and BGPsec router certificates.\
    \  (It is true that the\n       cost of relying parties will be affected by the\
    \ new objects, but\n       their responses should be completely automated or otherwise\n\
    \       routine.)\n   3.  The re-keying can be implemented in coordination with\
    \ planned\n       topology changes by either origin ASes or transit ASes (e.g.,\
    \ if\n       an AS changes providers, it completes a key rollover).\n   Disadvantages\
    \ to re-keying as replay attack protection mechanism are\n   as follows:\n   1.\
    \  Frequent rollovers add administrative and BGP processing loads,\n       although\
    \ the required frequency is not clear.  Some initial ideas\n       are found in\
    \ [RFC8207].\n   2.  The minimum replay vulnerability is bounded by the propagation\n\
    \       time for RPKI caches to obtain the new certificate and CRL (2x\n     \
    \  propagation time because first the new certificate and then the\n       CRL\
    \ need to propagate through the RPKI system).  If provisioning\n       is done\
    \ ahead of time, the minimum replay vulnerability window\n       size is reduced\
    \ to 1x propagation time (i.e., propagation of the\n       CRL).  However, these\
    \ bounds will be better understood when the\n       RPKI and RPKI relying party\
    \ software are well deployed; this will\n       also contribute to the propagation\
    \ time for objects in the RPKI\n       being better understood.\n   3.  Re-keying\
    \ increases the dynamics and size of the RPKI repository.\n"
