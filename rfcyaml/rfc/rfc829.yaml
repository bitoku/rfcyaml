    \ Agency\nABSTRACT\nThis paper describes briefly the packet satellite technology\
    \ developed\nby the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and several other\n\
    participating organizations in the U.K. and Norway and provides a\nbiblography\
    \ of relevant papers for researchers interested in\nexperimental and operational\
    \ experience with this dynamic\nsatellite-sharing technique.\nINTRODUCTION\nPacket\
    \ Satellite technology was an outgrowth of early work in packet\nswitching on\
    \ multiaccess radio channels carried out at the University of\nHawaii with the\
    \ support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n(DARPA).  The primary\
    \ difference between the earlier packet-switched\nARPANET [1, 2] and the ALOHA\
    \ system developed at the University of\nHawaii [3] was the concept of multiple\
    \ transmitters dynamically sharing\na common and directly-accessible radio channel.\
    \  In the ARPANET, sources\nof traffic inserted packets of data into the network\
    \ through packet\nswitches called Interface Message Processors (IMPs).  The IMPs\
    \ used high\nspeed point-to-point full-duplex telephone circuits [4] on a\nstore-and-forward\
    \ basis.  All packet traffic for a given telephone\ncircuit was queued, if necessary,\
    \ in the IMP and transmitted as soon as\nthe packet reached the head of the queue.\
    \  On such full duplex circuits\nthere is exactly one transmitter and one receiver\
    \ in each direction.\nThe ALOHA system, on the other hand, assigned a common transmit\
    \ channel\nfrequency to ALL radio terminals.  A computer at the University of\n\
    Hawaii received packet bursts from the remote terminals which shared the\n\"multi-access\"\
    \ channel.  Under the control of a small processor, each\nterminal would transmit\
    \ whenever it had traffic, and would await an\nacknowledgement, on another frequency,\
    \ dedicated to the service host. If\nno acknowledgement was received, the terminal\
    \ processor would transmit\nagain at a randomly chosen time.  The system operated\
    \ on the assumption\nthat no store-and-forward or radio relay was needed.  The\
    \ University of\nHawaii researchers later demonstrated that the ALOHA concept\
    \ worked on a\nsatellite channel linking Hawaii and Nasa-Ames via NASA's ATS-1\n\
    satellite [5, 6].  A variety of more elaborate satellite channel\nassignment strategies\
    \ were developed and analyzed in the early 1970's\n[7-13, 31].\n             \
    \                                 Remote User Telnet Service\nTHE ATLANTIC PACKET\
    \ SATELLITE EXPERIMENT (SATNET)\nIn 1973, DARPA began the development of a packet\
    \ satellite system which\nwould support the sharing of a common, high speed channel\
    \ among many\nground stations.  Using an INTELSAT-IV satellite, the Atlantic Packet\n\
    Satellite experiment was carried out with the cooperation and support of\nthe\
    \ British Post Office, COMSAT Corporation, Linkabit Corporation, and\nBolt Beranek\
    \ and Newman Corporation, later joined by the Norwegian\nTelecommunication Administration\
    \ and the Norwegian Defense Research\nEstablishment (NDRE).  Along with University\
    \ College London and COMSAT\nLaboratories, NDRE became one of the major users\
    \ of the SATNET system.\nDuring 1975-1978, SATNET underwent a broad range of performance\n\
    evaluations and tests.  Since 1979, it has served as a stable support\nfor international\
    \ experiments and demonstrations of command and control\ntechnology of interest\
    \ to DARPA, NDRE and the U.K. Royal Signals and\nRadar Establishment (RSRE). \
    \ Late in 1982, a ground station was added to\nconnect the German Aeronautics\
    \ and Space Research Establishment (DFVLR)\ninto the system.\nThe early development\
    \ of SATNET is outlined in [14].  The system design\nis documented in [15-22].\
    \  Experience with the operation of the SATNET\nis reported in [23-24] and experimental\
    \ results in [25-26].  Potential\nservices which might be supported by this technology\
    \ are discussed in\n[27].\nThe integration of the packet satellite technology\
    \ into a larger,\nmultiple packet network context is discussed in [28-29].  The\
    \ system is\nexpected to continue in use to support joint research by DARPA, RSRE,\n\
    NDRE, DFVLR and UCL.  DARPA and the U.S. Defense Communications Agency\nare experimenting\
    \ with a 3 megabit/second domestic packet satellite\nsystem to determine whether\
    \ packetized voice and data services can be\nintegrated economically using this\
    \ technology.  DARPA and the U.S. Naval\nElectronic Systems Command recently demonstrated\
    \ a Mobile Access\nTerminal Network (MATNET) which uses packet satellite techniques\
    \ to\nsupport ship-ship and ship-shore communication over a shared FLTSATCOM\n\
    satellite channel [30].\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe development of Packet Satellite\
    \ technology has involved many\ninstitutions and individuals, but special credit\
    \ for the successful\nrealization of the SATNET and its successor systems must\
    \ be given to Dr.\nRobert E. Kahn, Director, Information Processing Techniques\
    \ Office,\nDARPA, for his continuous support and technical contributions throughout\n\
    the development and maturation of this technology.\n                         \
