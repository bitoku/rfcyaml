  - "A SPECIFICATION OF THE INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP) TIMESTAMP OPTION\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\
    \     Packet switching is store-and-forward by nature.  Network delay is a\ntherefore\
    \ a critical performance measure for packet-switching communications.\nA catenet\
    \ is a system of packet-switched communication networks interconnected\nvia gateways\
    \ [Cerf 78].  The catenet \"link\" delays are thus variable.  Their\nmeasurement,\
    \ the measurement of delays across member networks of a catenet,\nbecomes important\
    \ for catenet investigations.\n     An effective way to measure catenet delays\
    \ is by means of packet header\ntimestamping.  Header timestamping allows monitoring\
    \ of catenet delays for\nuser traffic, such as the case of Ft. Bragg users accessing\
    \ ISID across the\ncatenet.  Packet header timestamping is also compatible with\
    \ the use of test\npackets for catenet delay measurement.  Another advantage of\
    \ header\ntimestamping is that since it is an IP option, the gateway imposes little\n\
    difference in the treatment of such a packet.  In this note, a specification\n\
    of the timestamp option format for IP is presented.\n     Measurement of one-way\
    \ delay, either end-to-end or across an individual\nnetwork, requires that device\
    \ clocks be synchronized, using such facilities as\nWWVB clocks [Mills 81].  This\
    \ specification assumes this capability in the\ngateways and involved network\
    \ hosts.\nII.  FORMAT SPECIFICATION\n     As an IP option, the contents of the\
    \ first two octets are dictated by the\nIP header format to be option type and\
    \ option length in octets [Postel 80].\nThe next two octets are used to control\
    \ this option.\n     0               7               15              23      \
    \        31\n     |     type      |    length     |    offset     |overflw| flags\
    \ |\n     option type = 68 decimal (i.e., option class = 2 and option number =\
    \ 4);\n     option length = the number of octets with a maximum of 40 (limited\
    \ by\n\t\t IHL = 15);\n     offset =    the number of octets from the beginning\
    \ of this option to the\n\t\t end of timestamps (i.e., the beginning of space\
    \ for next\n\t\t timestamp).  It is set to one, an odd number, when no more\n\t\
    \t space remains in the header for timestamps;\n     overflow =  the number of\
    \ IP modules that cannot register timestamps due\n\t\t to lack of space;\n   \
    \  flag = 0 -- time stamps only\n\t    1 -- each timestamp is preceded with internet\
    \ ID of the\n\t\t registering entity\n\t    3 -- the internet ID fields are prespecified.\
    \  An IP module only\n\t\t registers its timestamp if it matches its own ID with\
    \ the\n\t\t next specified internet ID;\n     internet ID = ID for the timestamping\
    \ device;\n     timestamp = a right-justified, 32-bit timestamp in milliseconds\
    \ modulo\n\t\t 24 hours from midnight UT.\n     The timestamp option is not copied\
    \ upon fragmentation.  It is carried in\nthe first fragment.\nREFERENCES\n[Cerf\
