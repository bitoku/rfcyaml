  - "                   TENEX Load Averages for July 1973\n   This RFC presents utilization\
    \ data for the BBN and ISI TENEX systems\n   which may be of interest to the network\
    \ community.\n   The graph on page 4 summarizes the load at the BBN-TENEX and\
    \ USC-ISI\n   Hosts during the work week for the month of July 1973.  The weekday\n\
    \   hourly load average [1] for each site is plotted versus the time of\n   day;\
    \ the time of day is Eastern Daylight Time.\n   Interpreting data such as this\
    \ is tricky business.  However, it is\n   difficult to resist making the following\
    \ observations:\n   1. The shapes of the BBN and ISI curves are approximately\
    \ the same;\n      furthermore, there is no skew between the curves.  This suggests\n\
    \      that the user populations for the two systems have similar working\n  \
    \    habits and are acclimated to the same time zone.\n   2. The significant features\
    \ of both curves appear to be strongly\n      correlated with \"normal events\"\
    \ in the day of a user living on\n      East Coast time,suggesting that the load\
    \ at both sites is\n      influenced most strongly by such users:\n      a. the\
    \ load begins to increase between 7-8 a.m. EDT as users begin\n         their\
    \ daily computing;\n      b. it dips between 10-11 a.m. EDT (smoothed to a smaller\
    \ rate of\n         increase in the ISI curve) as users take their coffee break;\n\
    \      c. the load peaks sharply between 1-2 p.m. EDT as users return\n      \
    \   from lunch to resume their computing;\n      d. it decreases as the afternoon\
    \ continues and as users go home\n         from work;\n      e. it reaches a local\
    \ minimum between 6-7 p.m. EDT (minimum not\n         present in ISI curve) when\
    \ most people eat dinner;\n      f. it increases to an evening peak between 9-10\
    \ p.m. EDT as some\n         users come back from dinner and after dinner activities\
    \ to\n         resume their computing.\n   3. The curve for ISI is smoother than\
    \ the one for BBN: the \"coffee\n      break\" dip appears only as a decrease\
    \ in slope; the dinner break\n      and evening peak are completely smoothed \
    \ out.  This smoothing is\n      probably due to the influence of the West Coast\
    \ users of the ISI\n      machine.\n   4.  During July the BBN system was more\
    \ heavily loaded than the ISI\n      system.  Since the data collected did not\
    \ include the number of\n      active jobs it is not possible to determine from\
    \ the data whether\n      BBN had more users or just more demanding users.\n \
    \  The data presented on the graph is available as a side effect of the\n   RSEXEC\
    \ system.  The server programs for the RSEXEC system (RSSER\n   programs) communicate\
    \ regularly with one another exchanging status\n   information.   The RSSER program\
    \ at each site maintains a (dynamic)\n   data base of the information it collects\
    \ from the RSSER programs at\n   other sites.  The NETLOAD command of the TENEX\
    \ EXEC, as well as many\n   RSEXEC commands, makes use of information in that\
    \ database.\n   The raw data for BBN and ISI [2] load curves (as well as data\
    \ for the\n   other TENEX sites that run RSSER) was collected by a program which\n\
    \   creates daily load information files by periodically (every 3\n   minutes)\
    \ reading load average data from the data base maintained by\n   RSSER.  The monthly\
    \ summary was produced by a program that analyzes\n   daily data files.\n   [The\
    \ following graph is also available in .PS and .PDF format.]\n       Weekday Hourly\

    \   average is an average of the number of runable processes over a given\n  \
    \ time period.  For example, an hourly load average of 10 would mean\n   that\
    \ (for a single CPU system) at any time during that hour one could\n   expect\
    \ to see 1 process running and 9 others ready to run (i.e., not\n   blocked for\
    \ I/O) waiting for the CPU.\n   [2] The data for BBN and ISI was chosen for presentation\
    \ in this RFC\n   because the BBN and ISI TENEXs are two of the major time-sharing\n\
    \   service hosts on the network.\n         [ This RFC was put into machine readable\
