  - "Abstract\n   The concept of Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and\n   Multicast
    Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping requires the ability to\n   identify the location
    of multicast routers.  Since snooping is not\n   standardized, there are many
    mechanisms in use to identify the\n   multicast routers.  However, this can lead
    to interoperability issues\n   between multicast routers and snooping switches
    from different\n   vendors.\n   This document introduces a general mechanism that
    allows for the\n   discovery of multicast routers.  This new mechanism, Multicast
    Router\n   Discovery (MRD), introduces a standardized means of identifying\n   multicast
    routers without a dependency on particular multicast\n   routing protocols.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multicast Router Discovery (MRD) messages are useful for
    determining\n   which nodes attached to a switch have multicast routing enabled.\n
    \  This capability is useful in a layer-2 bridging domain with snooping\n   switches.
    \ By utilizing MRD messages, layer-2 switches can determine\n   where to send
    multicast source data and group membership messages [1]\n   [2].  Multicast source
    data and group membership reports must be\n   received by all multicast routers
    on a segment.  Using the group\n   membership protocol Query messages to discover
    multicast routers is\n   insufficient due to query suppression.\n   Although MRD
    messages could be sent as ICMP messages, the group\n   management protocols were
    chosen since this functionality is\n   multicast specific.  The addition of this
    functionality to the group\n   membership protocol also allows operators to have
    congruence between\n   MRD problems and data forwarding issues.\n   The key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document
    are to be interpreted as described in [3].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  Protocol Overview\n   Multicast Router Discovery consists of three messages
    for discovering\n   multicast routers.  The Multicast Router Advertisement is
    sent by\n   routers to advertise that IP multicast forwarding is enabled.\n   Devices
    may send Multicast Router Solicitation messages in order to\n   solicit Advertisement
    messages from multicast routers.  The Multicast\n   Router Termination messages
    are sent when a router stops IP multicast\n   routing functions on an interface.\n
    \  Multicast routers send unsolicited Advertisements periodically on all\n   interfaces
    on which multicast forwarding is enabled.  Advertisement\n   messages are also
    sent in response to Solicitations.  In addition to\n   advertising the location
    of multicast routers, Advertisements also\n   convey useful information concerning
    group management protocol\n   variables.  This information can be used for consistency
    checking on\n   the subnet.\n   A device sends Solicitation messages whenever
    it wishes to discover\n   multicast routers on a directly attached link.\n   A
    router sends Termination messages when it terminates multicast\n   routing functionality
    on an interface.\n   All MRD messages are sent with an IPv4 Time to Live (TTL)
    or IPv6 Hop\n   Limit of 1 and contain the Router Alert Option [4] [5].  All MRD\n
    \  messages SHOULD be rate-limited as per the MaxMessageRate variable.\n   Advertisement
    and Termination messages are sent to the All-Snoopers\n   multicast address.\n
    \  Solicitation messages are sent to the All-Routers multicast address.\n   Any
    data beyond the fixed message format MUST be ignored.\n"

  - "3.  Multicast Router Advertisement\n   Multicast Router Advertisements are sent
    unsolicited periodically on\n   all router interfaces on which multicast forwarding
    is enabled.  They\n   are also sent in response to Multicast Router Solicitation
    messages.\n   Advertisements are sent\n   1.  Upon the expiration of a periodic
    (modulo randomization) timer\n   2.  As part of a router's start-up procedure\n
    \  3.  During the restart of a multicast forwarding interface\n   4.  On receipt
    of a Solicitation message\n   All Advertisements are sent as Internet Group Management
    Protocol\n   (for IPv4) or Multicast Listener Discovery (for IPv6) messages to
    the\n   All-Snoopers multicast address.  These messages SHOULD be rate-\n   limited
    as per the MaxMessageRate variable.\n"

        \ Note that the purpose of this jitter is to avoid\n   synchronization of
        multiple routers on a network, hence choosing a\n   value of zero is discouraged.
        \ This value MUST be an integer no less\n   than 0 seconds and no greater

        \ This variable\n   is maintained per neighbor.  An MRD receiver should set
        the\n   NeighborDeadInterval to 3 times the sum of Advertisement Interval\n
        \  Field received plus the AdvertisementJitter calculated from the\n   received
        Advertisement Interval Field.  This ensures consistent\n   behavior between

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   As MRD is a link-local protocol, there is no
    circumstance in which it\n   would be correct for an MRD receiver to receive MRD
    traffic from an\n   off-network source.  For IPv6, MRD messages MUST have a valid
    link-\n   local source address.  Any messages received without a valid link-\n
    \  local source address MUST be discarded.  Similarly, for IPv4, the MRD\n   receiver
    MUST determine if the source address is local to the\n   receiving interface,
    and MUST discard any messages that have a non-\n   local source.  Determining
    what networks are local may be\n   accomplished through configuration information
    or operational\n   capabilities.\n   Rogue nodes may attempt to attack a network
    running MRD by sending\n   spoofed Advertisement, Solicitation, or Termination
    messages.  Each\n   type of spoofed message can be dealt with using existing technology.\n
    \  A rogue node may attempt to interrupt multicast service by sending\n   spoofed
    Termination messages.  As described in Section 5.4, all\n   Termination messages
    are validated by sending a Solicitation message.\n   By sending a Solicitation,
    the node will force the transmission of an\n   Advertisement by an active router.\n
    \  Spoofed Solicitation messages do not cause any operational harm.\n   They may
    be used as a flooding mechanism to attack a multicast\n   router.  This attack
    can be mitigated through the rate-limiting\n   recommendation for all MRD messages.\n
    \  The Multicast Router Advertisement message may allow rogue machines\n   to
    masquerade as multicast routers.  This could allow those machines\n   to eavesdrop
    on multicast data transmissions.  Additionally, it could\n   constitute a denial
    of service attack to other hosts in the same\n   snooping domain or sharing the
    same device port in the presence of\n   high-rate multicast flows.\n   The technology
    available in SEND [10] can be utilized to address\n   spoofed Advertisement messages
    in IPv6 networks.  IPv6 Multicast\n   routers in an MRD-enabled network can use
    SEND-based link-local\n   addresses as the IPv6 source address for MRD messages.
    \ When a switch\n   receives an initial Advertisement, it can use the information
    in the\n   SEND-based address to challenge the router to authenticate itself.\n
    \  It should be noted that this approach only applies to IPv6 networks.\n   Another
    solution that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 is to use IPsec in\n   Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP) mode [11] to protect against\n   attacks by ensuring that
    messages came from a system with the proper\n   key.  When using IPsec, the messages
    sent to the All-Snoopers address\n   should be authenticated using ESP.  Should
    encryption not be desired,\n   ESP with a null encryption algorithm and a symmetric
    authentication\n   algorithm, such as HMAC-SHA-1, is viable.  For keying, a symmetric\n
    \  signature algorithm with a single manually configured key is used for\n   routers
    sending Advertisements.  This allows validation that the MRD\n   message was sent
    by a system with the key.  It should be noted that\n   this does not prevent a
    system with the key from forging a message\n   and it requires the disabling of
    IPsec's Replay Protection.  It is\n   the responsibility of the network administrator
    to ensure that the\n   same key is present on all possible MRD participants.\n"

    \  This document also introduces three new MLD messages.  Each of these\n   messages
    requires a new ICMPv6 Type value.  The IANA has assigned\n   three new ICMPv6

    \ Section 5.1.1  | Multicast Router Termination   |\n   +-------------+-----------------+--------------------------------+\n
    \  This document also requires the assignment of an All-Snoopers\n   multicast
    address for IPv4.  This multicast address is in the\n   224.0.0/24 range since
    it is used for link-local, control messages.\n   The IPv4 multicast address for
    All-Snoopers is 224.0.0.106.\n   A corresponding IPv6 multicast address has also
    been assigned.\n   Following the guidelines in [12], the IPv6 multicast address
    is a\n   link-local in scope and has a group-ID value equal to the low-order 8\n
    \  bits of the requested IPv4 multicast address.  The IPv6 multicast\n   address
    is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:6A.\n"
