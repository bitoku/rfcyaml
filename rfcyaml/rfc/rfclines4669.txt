Abstract This memo defines a set of extensions that instrument RADIUS authentication server functions.
These extensions represent a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
Using these extensions, IP based management stations can manage RADIUS authentication servers.
This memo obsoletes RFC 2619 by deprecating the MIB table containing IPv4 only address formats and defining a new table to add support for version neutral IP address formats.
The remaining MIB objects from RFC 2619 are carried forward into this document.
This memo also adds UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
The objects defined within this memo relate to the Remote Authentication Dial
Authentication Server as defined in RFC 2865
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This document uses terminology from RFC 2865
This document uses the word "malformed" with respect to RADIUS packets, particularly in the context of counters of "malformed packets".
While RFC 2865 does not provide an explicit definition of "malformed", malformed generally means that the implementation has determined the packet does not match the format defined in RFC 2865.
Some implementations may determine that packets are malformed when the Vendor Specific Attribute (VSA) format does not follow the RFC 2865 recommendations for VSAs.
Those implementations are used in deployments today, and thus set the de facto definition of "malformed".
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
[RFC2619], RADIUS Authentication Server MIB, by deprecating the radiusAuthClientTable table and adding a new table, radiusAuthClientExtTable, containing radiusAuthClientInetAddressType and radiusAuthClientInetAddress.
The purpose of these added MIB objects is to support version neutral IP addressing formats.
The existing table containing radiusAuthClientAddress is deprecated.
The remaining MIB objects from RFC 2619 are carried forward into this document.
This memo also adds UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.
[RFC4001], which defines the SMI Textual Conventions for version neutral IP addresses, contains the following recommendation. '
In particular, when revising a MIB module that contains IPv4 specific tables, it is suggested to define new tables using the textual conventions defined in this memo [RFC4001] that support all versions of IP.
The status of the new tables SHOULD be "current", whereas the status of the old IP version specific tables SHOULD be changed to "deprecated".
The other approach, of having multiple similar tables for different IP versions, is strongly discouraged.'
Structure of the MIB Module
The RADIUS authentication protocol, described in RFC 2865
[RFC2865], distinguishes between the client function and the server function.
In RADIUS authentication, clients send Access Requests, and servers reply with Access Accepts, Access Rejects, and Access Challenges.
Typically, NAS devices implement the client function, and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS authentication client MIB, while RADIUS authentication servers implement the server function, and thus would be expected to implement the RADIUS authentication server MIB.
However, it is possible for a RADIUS authentication entity to perform both client and server functions.
For example, a RADIUS proxy may act as a server to one or more RADIUS authentication clients, while simultaneously acting as an authentication client to one or more authentication servers.
In such situations, it is expected that RADIUS entities combining client and server functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.
The server MIB is defined in this document, and the client MIB is defined in [RFC4668].
This MIB module contains fourteen scalars as well as a single table, the RADIUS Authentication Client Table, which contains one row for each RADIUS authentication client with which the server shares a secret.
Each entry in the RADIUS Authentication Client Table includes thirteen columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS authentication server.
This MIB imports from [RFC2578], [RFC2580], [RFC3411], and [RFC4001].
The deprecated table in this MIB is carried forward from RFC 2619
There are two conditions under which it MAY be desirable for managed entities to continue to support the deprecated table: 1.
The managed entity only supports IPv4 address formats.
The managed entity supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats, and the deprecated table is supported for backwards compatibility with older management stations.
This option SHOULD only be used when the IP addresses in the new table are in IPv4 format and can accurately be represented in both the new table and the deprecated table.
Managed entities SHOULD NOT instantiate row entries in the deprecated table, containing IPv4 only address objects, when the RADIUS client address represented in such a table row is not an IPv4 address.
Managed entities SHOULD NOT return inaccurate values of IP address or SNMP object access errors for IPv4 only address objects in otherwise populated tables.
When row entries exist in both the deprecated IPv4 only table and the new IP version neutral table that describe the same RADIUS client, the row indexes SHOULD be the same for the corresponding rows in each table, to facilitate correlation of these related rows by management applications.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
This object can be used to reinitialize the persistent state of any server.
When set to reset(2), any persistent server state (such as a process) is reinitialized as if the server had just been started.
Depending on the server implementation details, this action may or may not interrupt the processing of pending request in the server.
Abuse of this object may lead to a Denial of Service attack on the server.
There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain sensitive information.
These are: radiusAuthClientIPAddress This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS authentication client with which the server is communicating.
This information could be useful in mounting an attack on the authentication client.
This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS authentication client with which the server is communicating.
This information could be useful in mounting an attack on the authentication client.
It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.
Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 do not provide a secure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
