  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo references three annotated templates for IETF\
    \ documents\n   that contain the definition of MIB modules.  It is intended to\
    \ reduce\n   the work of the editors of such documents, making these more uniform\n\
    \   and easier to read and review, thus furthering the quality of such\n   documents\

- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   The MIB Doctors directorate has produced three templates specifically\n\
    \   aimed at Internet-Drafts containing MIB modules.  The templates are\n   available\
    \ at the IETF Tools web site, listed as \"Templates for MIB\n   Documents\".\n\
    \   o  The first is an XML template for editors that use XML2RFC.  Some\n    \
    \  advice echoing guidelines from RFC 4181 is embedded in comments.\n   o  A second\
    \ template is a text template for MIB documents with advice\n      embedded in\
    \ the document.\n   o  A third template is a plain text template with no advice\
    \ included.\n   The templates were developed to make IETF documents that contain\
    \ MIB\n   modules more consistent.  This makes it easier for a MIB Doctor and\n\
    \   other IETF participants to review the document.  There are a number\n   of\
    \ MUSTs in the templates, especially in the advice; these usually\n   refer to\
    \ IESG requirements for Internet-Drafts, and MIB Doctors are\n   likely to check\
    \ for these requirements.\n   The templates contain boilerplates that are required\
    \ for IETF MIB\n   module documents.  It has been common practice for editors\
    \ to use\n   existing MIB module documents as templates.  This approach has\n\
    \   problems because boilerplates and other required elements change over\n  \
    \ time.  The templates referenced by this document will be made\n   available\
    \ on the IETF Tools web site, and occasionally updated to\n   reflect the latest\
    \ requirements.  The most up-to-date revisions of\n   the templates are available\
    \ at http://www.tools.ietf.org.\n   The templates contain sections that describe\
    \ the purpose and\n   organization of the MIB module, and the relationship between\
    \ this MIB\n   module and other MIB modules.  This makes it easier for MIB Doctors\n\
    \   to understand the MIB module, which speeds the review process.\n   Editors\
    \ should read RFC 4181 \"Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers of\n   MIB Documents\"\
    \ [RFC4181], which describes best current practices for\n   MIB module document\
    \ editing.\n   The document templates do not include a template for the MIB module\n\
    \   itself.  Tools to validate MIB modules typically require that the MIB\n  \
    \ module be separated from the surrounding document.  The MIB Doctors\n   feel\
    \ that the simplest approach is to develop the MIB module outside\n   the document\
    \ that contains the surrounding text, and then include the\n   MIB module into\
    \ the surrounding document written using the templates.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This memo recommends templates for editing; it\
    \ has no direct impact\n   on network security.  The templates include boilerplates\
    \ and\n   associated advice for writing the Security Considerations section of\n\
    \   an Internet-Draft that documents a MIB module.\n"
- title: 4.  Contributors
  contents:
  - "4.  Contributors\n   These templates are based on contributions from the MIB\
    \ Doctors,\n   especially Juergen Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M. Heard, and\
    \ Randy\n   Presuhn.\n"
