    \ AS1,\n   AS2, and AS3 messages were designed specifically for the transport\
    \ of\n   EDI documents.  Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a\n\
    \   single EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI\n   documents\
    \ in a single message.  As adoption of EDIINT grew, other\n   uses developed aside\
    \ from single EDI document transport.  Some\n   transactions required multiple\
    \ attachments to be interpreted together\n   and stored in a single message. \
    \ This Informational RFC describes how\n   multiple documents, including non-EDI\
    \ payloads, can be attached and\n   transmitted in a single EDIINT transport message.\
    \  The attachments\n   are stored within the MIME multipart/related structure.\
    \  A minimal\n   list of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The primary work of the EDIINT working group (WG) was to\
    \ develop a\n   secure means of transporting EDI documents over the Internet.\
    \  This\n   was described in the three WG-developed standards for secure\n   transport\
    \ over SMTP AS1 [RFC3335], HTTP AS2 [RFC4130], and FTP AS3\n   [RFC4823].  For\
    \ most uses of EDI, all relevant information to\n   complete a single business\
    \ transaction could be stored in a single\n   document.  As adoption of EDIINT\
    \ grew, new industries and businesses\n   began using AS2 and also needed to include\
    \ multiple documents in a\n   single message to complete a trading-partner transaction.\
    \  These\n   documents were a variety of MIME media types.  This Informational\
    \ RFC\n   describes how to use the MIME multipart/related body structure within\n\
    \   EDIINT messages to store multiple document attachments.  Details of\n   computing\
    \ the message integrity check (MIC) value over this body are\n   covered.  A minimum\
    \ listing of MIME media types to support within the\n   multipart/related body\
    \ is given along with information on extracting\n   these documents.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\

- title: 2.1.  Multipart/Related Structure
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Multipart/Related Structure\n   Multiple payload attachments for EDIINT\
    \ messages are stored within a\n   multipart/related MIME body [RFC2387].  The\
    \ multipart/related\n   structure allows multiple MIME attachments or message\
    \ payloads to be\n   communicated in a single structure and message.\n   The attached\
    \ payloads can be of any MIME content-type depending on\n   the trading-partner\
    \ agreement, but Section 2.5 lists the\n   content-types that MUST be supported.\
    \  The use and format of the\n   multipart/ related body follows the rules in\
    \ RFC 2387 [RFC2387],\n   including the required type parameter to determine the\
    \ root body\n   part.  The use of the optional start parameter is RECOMMENDED.\n"
- title: 2.2.  EDIINT-Features Header
  contents:
  - "2.2.  EDIINT-Features Header\n   To indicate support for multiple attachments\
    \ (MAs), an EDIINT\n   application MUST use the EDIINT-Features header [RFC6017].\
    \  The\n   EDIINT-Features header indicates that the instance application can\n\
    \   support various features, such as certification exchange.  The header\n  \
    \ is present in all messages from the instance application, not just\n   those\
    \ that feature certification exchange.\n   For applications implementing multiple\
    \ attachments, the\n   MA-Feature-Name MUST be used within the EDIINT-Features\
    \ header as\n   listed in this ABNF [RFC5234] syntax:\n      MA-Feature-Name =\
    \ \"multiple-attachments\"\n   An example of the EDIINT-Features header in a message\
    \ from an\n   application supporting MA:\n      EDIINT-Features: multiple-attachments\n"
- title: 2.3.  MIC Calculation
  contents:
  - "2.3.  MIC Calculation\n   MIC calculation in an EDIINT message with multiple\
    \ attachments is\n   performed in the same manner as for a single EDI payload.\
    \  The only\n   difference is calculating the message integrity check (MIC) over\
    \ the\n   whole multipart/related body rather than a single EDI payload.\n   Section\
    \ 5.2.1 of AS1 [RFC3335] and Section 4 of EDIINT COMPRESSION\n   [RFC5402] describe\
    \ the MIC calculations used for a single payload\n   document within an EDIINT\
    \ message.  The approach is summarized below\n   for the multipart/related body.\
    \  Refer to stated sections above for\n   more details.\n   For a compressed but\
    \ unsigned message, regardless of encryption, the\n   MIC is calculated over the\
    \ uncompressed multipart/related body\n   including any applied Content-Transfer-Encoding.\
    \  The body MUST be\n   canonicalized according to the procedure described in\
    \ the underlying\n   transport protocol (e.g., HTTP AS2 [RFC4130]) before the\
    \ MIC is\n   calculated.\n   For an encrypted but unsigned and uncompressed message,\
    \ the MIC is\n   calculated on the decrypted multipart/related body, including\
    \ the\n   header and all attached documents.  The body MUST be canonicalized\n\
    \   according to the procedure described in the underlying transport\n   protocol\
    \ (e.g., HTTP AS2 [RFC4130]) before the MIC is calculated.\n   For an unsigned\
    \ and unencrypted message, the MIC is calculated over\n   the data inside the\
    \ multipart/related boundaries prior to\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding.  However,\
    \ unsigned and unencrypted\n   messages SHOULD NOT be sent due to lack of security.\n\
    \   If the expected MIC value differs from the calculated MIC value, all\n   attachments\
    \ MUST be considered invalid and retransmitted.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Document Processing
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Document Processing\n   Upon receipt of an EDIINT message with multiple\
    \ attachments, the\n   receiving user agent MUST be able to extract the attached\
    \ payloads\n   from the message rather than only removing the multipart/related\
    \ body\n   from the message.  The storing or processing of the documents as they\n\
    \   relate to the pending transaction is implementation dependent.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Content-Types to Support
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Content-Types to Support\n   Documents of the following MIME media types\
    \ MAY be found in a\n   multipart/related body and MUST be accepted by the user\
    \ agent.\n   However, any media type can be used depending upon industry need,\
    \ and\n   other media types MAY be accepted depending upon the trading-partner\n\
    \   agreement.  Please see [MIMEREG] for the definitions of the media\n   types\
    \ listed below.\n      application/xml\n      application/pdf\n      application/msword\n\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Multiple attachments have security concerns that\
    \ are very similar to\n   those described in the three EDIINT transport standards.\
    \  These\n   include the importance of using strong cryptography and the necessity\n\
    \   of using valid certificates and chaining to a trusted certification\n   authority\
    \ (CA).  Please refer to these standards -- SMTP AS1\n   [RFC3335], HTTP AS2 [RFC4130],\
    \ and FTP AS3 [RFC4823] -- for details\n   of their security considerations.\n\
    \   The only additional security consideration is that if the MIC\n   calculation\
    \ by the user agent differs from the expected MIC\n   calculation, all the attached\
    \ documents MUST be considered invalid.\n   Because the MIC calculation is over\
    \ the multipart/related body, the\n   MIC validates the content integrity of all\
    \ the documents.\n"
