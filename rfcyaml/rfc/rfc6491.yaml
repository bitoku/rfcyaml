  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet Routing\"
    [RFC6480]\n   directs IANA [RFC2860] to issue Resource Public Key Infrastructure\n
    \  (RPKI) objects for which it is authoritative.  This document\n   describes
    the objects IANA will issue.  If IANA is directed to issue\n   additional RPKI
    objects in future, this document will be revised and\n   a new version issued.\n
    \  The signed objects described here that IANA will issue are the\n   unallocated,
    reserved, special use IPv4 and IPv6 address blocks, and\n   the unallocated and
    reserved Autonomous System numbers.  These number\n   resources are managed by
    IANA for the IETF; thus, IANA bears the\n   responsibility of issuing the corresponding
    RPKI objects.  The reader\n   is encouraged to consider the technical effects
    on the public routing\n   system of the signed object issuance proposed for IANA
    in this\n   document.\n   This document does not deal with BGP [RFC4271] routing
    systems, as\n   those are under the policy controls of the organizations that
    operate\n   them.  Readers are directed to \"Local Trust Anchor Management for
    the\n   Resource Public Key Infrastructure\" [TA-MGMT] for a description of\n
    \  how to locally override IANA issued objects, e.g., to enable use of\n   unallocated,
    reserved, and special use IPv4 and IPv6 address blocks\n   in a local context.\n
    \  The direction to IANA contained herein follows the ideal that it\n   should
    represent the ideal technical behavior for registry and\n   related registry actions.\n"

  title: 2.  Requirements Notation
- contents:
  - "3.  Required Reading\n   Readers should be familiar with the RPKI, the RPKI repository\n
    \  structure, and the various RPKI objects, uses, and interpretations\n   described
    in the following: [RFC6480], [RFC6487], [RFC6482],\n   [RFC6493], [TA-MGMT], [RFC6483],
    [RPKI-USE], [RFC6484], and\n   [RFC6486].\n   Note: The addresses used in this
    document are not example addresses;\n   therefore, they are not compliant with
    [RFC3849], [RFC5735], and\n   [RFC5771].  This is intentional, as the practices
    described in this\n   document are directed to specific instances of real world
    addresses.\n"
  title: 3.  Required Reading
- contents:
  - "4.  Definitions\n   Internet Number Resources (INR): The number identifiers for
    IPv4\n   [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC2460] addresses, and for Autonomous Systems\n
    \  (ASes).\n   IANA: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (a traditional name,
    used\n   here to refer to the technical team making and publishing the\n   assignments
    of Internet protocol technical parameters).  The\n   technical team of IANA is
    currently a part of ICANN [RFC2860].\n   RPKI: Resource Public Key Infrastructure.
    \ A Public Key\n   Infrastructure designed to provide a secure basis for assertions\n
    \  about holdings of Internet number resources.  Certificates issued\n   under
    the RPKI contain additional attributes that identify IPv4,\n   IPv6, and Autonomous
    System number resources [RFC6480].\n   ROA: Route Origination Authorization.  A
    ROA is an RPKI object that\n   enables the holder of the address prefix to specify
    an AS that is\n   permitted to originate (in BGP) routes for that prefix [RFC6482].\n
    \  AS 0 ROA: A ROA containing a value of 0 in the ASID field.\n   \"Validation
    of Route Origination Using the Resource Certificate\n   Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) and Route Origination Authorizations\n   (ROAs)\" [RFC6483] states \"A ROA
    with a subject of AS 0 (AS 0 ROA) is\n   an attestation by the holder of a prefix
    that the prefix described in\n   the ROA, and any more specific prefix, should
    not be used in a\n   routing context.\"\n   \"Not intended to be (publicly) routed\":
    This phrase refers to\n   prefixes that are not meant to be represented in the
    global Internet\n   routing table (for example 192.168/16 [RFC1918]).\n"
  title: 4.  Definitions
- contents:
  - "5.  Reserved Resources\n   Reserved IPv4 and IPv6 resources are held back for
    various reasons by\n   IETF action.  Generally, such resources are not intended
    to be\n   globally routed.  An example of such a reservation is 127.0.0.0/8\n
    \  [RFC5735].  See Appendixes A and B for IANA reserved resources.\n   IANA SHOULD
    issue an AS 0 ROA for all reserved IPv4 and IPv6\n   resources not intended to
    be routed.  The selection of the [RFC2119]\n   terminology is intentional as there
    may be situations where the AS 0\n   ROA is removed or not issued prior to an
    IANA registry action.  It is\n   not appropriate to place IANA into a situation
    where, through normal\n   internal operations, its behavior contradicts IETF standards.\n
    \  There are a small number of reserved resources that are intended to\n   be
    routed, for example 192.88.99.0/24 [RFC3068].  See Appendixes A\n   and B for
    IANA reserved resources.\n   IANA MUST NOT issue any ROAs (AS 0 or otherwise)
    for reserved\n   resources that are expected to be globally routed.\n"

  - "6.  Unallocated Resources\n   Internet Number Resources that have not yet been
    allocated for\n   special purposes [RFC5736], to Regional Internet Registries
    (RIRs),\n   or to others are considered as not intended to be globally routed.\n
    \  IANA SHOULD issue an AS 0 ROA for all Unallocated Resources.  The\n   selection
    of the [RFC2119] terminology is intentional as there may be\n   situations where
    the AS 0 ROA is removed or not issued prior to an\n   IANA registry action.  It
    is not appropriate to place IANA into a\n   situation where, through normal internal
    operations, its behavior\n   contradicts IETF standards.\n"
  title: 6.  Unallocated Resources
- contents:
  - "7.  Special Purpose Registry Resources\n   Special Registry Resources [RFC5736]
    fall into one of two categories\n   in terms of routing.  Either the resource
    is intended to be seen in\n   the global Internet routing table in some fashion,
    or it isn't.  An\n   example of a Special Registry Resources INR that is intended
    for\n   global routing is 2001::/32 [RFC4380].  An example of an INR not\n   intended
    to be seen would be 2001:002::/48 [RFC5180].\n   IANA MUST NOT issue any ROAs
    (AS 0 or otherwise) for Special Purpose\n   Registry Resources that are intended
    to be globally routed.\n   IANA SHOULD issue an AS 0 ROA for Special Purpose Registry
    Resources\n   that are not intended to be globally routed.\n"

  - "8.  Multicast\n   Within the IPv4 multicast [RFC5771] and IPv6 multicast [RFC4291]\n
    \  registries there are a number of Multicast registrations that are not\n   intended
    to be globally routed.\n   IANA MUST issue an AS 0 ROA covering the following
    IPv4 and IPv6\n   multicast INRs:\n   IPv4:\n           - Local Network Control
    Block\n              224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255 (224.0.0/24)\n           - IANA Reserved

    Link-Local Scope Multicast Addresses\n   IANA MUST NOT issue any ROAs (AS 0 or
    otherwise) for any other\n   multicast addresses unless directed by an IESG-approved
    Standards\n   Track document with an appropriate IANA Considerations section.\n"

  - "9.  Informational Objects\n   One informational object that can exist at a publication
    point of an\n   RPKI repository is the Ghostbusters Record [RFC6493].\n   IANA
    MUST issue a ghostbusters object appropriate in content for the\n   resources
    IANA maintains.\n"
  title: 9.  Informational Objects
- contents:
  - "10.  Certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)\n   Before IANA can
    issue a ROA, it MUST first establish an RPKI\n   Certification Authority (CA)
    that covers unallocated, reserved, and\n   special use INRs.  A CA that covers
    these INRs MUST contain RFC 3379\n   extensions [RFC3779] for those corresponding
    number resources in its\n   certificate.  This CA MUST issue single-use end-entity
    (EE)\n   certificates for each ROA that it generates.  The EE certificate will\n
    \  conform to the Resource Certificate Profile [RFC6487] and the\n   additional
    constraints specified in [RFC6482].  IANA MUST maintain a\n   publication point
    for this CA's use and MUST publish manifests\n   [RFC6486] (with its corresponding
    EE certificate) for this\n   publication point.  IANA MUST issue a CRL under this
    CA certificate\n   for the EE certificates noted above.  All objects issued by
    this CA\n   will conform to the RPKI Certificate Policy [RFC6484].\n"

    from issuing, the\n   specific RPKI objects described here for the current set
    of reserved,\n   unallocated, and special registry Internet Number Resources.\n
    \  Further, IANA MUST notify all other INR registries that RPKI objects\n   have
    been issued for the Internet Number Resources described in this\n   document to
    avoid the potential for issuance of duplicate objects\n   that might confuse relying
    parties.\n"
