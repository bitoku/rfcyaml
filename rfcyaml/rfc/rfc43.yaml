  - "                         Proposed Meeting\n      On Friday, 8 May 1970, at 9:30\
    \ AM a meeting at M.I.T. Lincoln\nLaboratory is proposed. A description of LIL\
    \ (Local Interaction\nLanguage) for the TSP (Terminal Support Processor) system\
    \ will be\npresented.\n      The purpose of the TSP system is to provide a flexible\
    \ I/O\ncapability for network users. In order to achieve maximum flexibility,\n\
    the system is user-programmable in an interpretable language called\nLIL.\n  \
    \    LIL has the appropriate primitives for manipulating tree\nstructures (for\
    \ interactive graphics) as well as message-oriented\nI/O. The general purpose\
    \ portion of the language is used to specify\nthe I/O handlers and the display\
    \ structures.\n      A discussion of the problems of handling interactive programs\n\
    over the ARPA network will follow.\n      This conference is intended as a working\
    \ group and each host\nshould send as few or as many individuals as are actively\n\
    interested. A working document on LIL will be mailed about a week in\nadvance\
    \ to interested individuals.\n      Anyone interested in attending and/or receiving\
    \ the documents\nshould contact A. G. Nemeth (x7354) or J. Forgie (x7173) at\n\
    M.I.T. Lincoln Labs, Lexington, Mass. 02173, (617) 862-5500.\n[This RFC was put\
    \ into machine readable form for entry into the RFC\narchives by Glenn Forbes\
    \ Fleming Larratt]\n"
