1.  Abstract The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
[1] defines a network representation of a search filter transmitted to an LDAP server.
Some applications may find it useful to have a common way of representing these search filters in a human readable form.
This document defines a human readable string format for representing LDAP search filters.
An LDAP search filter is defined in [1] as follows:
OCTET STRING where the LDAPString above is limited to the IA5 character set.
The AttributeType is a string representation of the attribute type name and is defined in [1].
OCTET STRING has the form defined in [2].
The Filter is encoded for transmission over a network using the Basic Encoding Rules defined in [3], with simplifications described in [1].
The string representation of an LDAP search filter is defined by the following grammar.
It uses a prefix format.
> <attr> is a string representing an AttributeType, and has the format defined in [1].
<value> is a string representing an AttributeValue, or part of one, and has the form defined in [2].
that although both the <substring> and <present> productions can produce the 'attr  ' construct, this construct is used only to denote a presence filter.
This section gives a few examples of search filters written using this notation.
Security Considerations Security considerations are not discussed in this memo.
