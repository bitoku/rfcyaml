This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for information related to a Fibre Channel network's Fabric Address Manager.
Fabric Address Manager refers to the functionality of acquiring DomainID(s) as specified in [FC SW 3], and managing Fibre Channel Identifiers as specified in [FC FS].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Short Overview of Fibre Channel
The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point to point serial data channel, structured for high performance.
Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
command sets, the High  Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.
Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple communication points, called N Ports, interconnected either by a switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point to point link.
A Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N Ports.
A Fabric may consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are switches.
An N Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch called an F Port.
When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port is called an FL Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL Ports.
Nx Port is used to refer to either an N Port or an NL Port.
Fx Port is used to refer to either an F Port or an FL Port.
A switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an Inter Switch Link (ISL), is called an E Port.
A B Port connects a bridge device with an E Port on a switch; a B Port provides a subset of E Port functionality.
Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and most ports, have globally unique names.
These globally unique names are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).
More information on WWNs can be found in [FC FS].
WWNs are expected to be persistent across agent and unit resets.
Fibre Channel frames contain 24 bit address identifiers, which identify the frame's source and destination ports.
Each FC port has both an address identifier and a WWN.
When a Fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamically assigned by a switch.
Each octet of a 24 bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy, with a Domain ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.
Each switch in a Fabric is assigned one (or more) unique Domain IDs using a two step process.
First, one switch, called Principal Switch, is selected from the switches of a Fabric.
Then, the Principal Switch assigns Domain IDs to the other switches of the Fabric.
Address assignment within a domain is performed by the switch to which that Domain ID is granted.
The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focused on Fibre Channel switches.
It is being replaced by the more generic Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC MGMT], which defines basic information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to the standard IF MIB [IF MIB] for Fibre Channel interfaces.
[FC MGMT] includes the specification of how the generic objects defined in [IF MIB] apply to Fibre Channel interfaces.
Note that an interface's ifIndex value must be unique within an SNMP context, irrespective of how many Fibre Channel management instances (see below) and how many Fibre Channel switches are instrumented within that SNMP context.
This document defines the T11 FC FABRIC ADDR MGR MIB module, which extends beyond [FC MGMT] to cover the functionality, in Fibre Channel switches, which is used to manage Fabric configuration, domains, and addresses within a domain.
This document also contains a MIB module, T11 TC MIB, to define textual conventions that might also be useful in other MIBs defined by T11.
This section explains the use of a Fibre Channel management instance, a Switch Index, and a Fabric Index.
It also describes the six MIB groups contained in the MIB.
Fibre Channel Management Instance A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC MGMT] as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.
Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for the implementation(s).
For example, one such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX sub agents, with each sub  agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.
The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB [FC MGMT]
as the index value to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel management instance.
The FC MGMT MIB [FC MGMT] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by Fibre Channel management instances.
Each Fibre Channel management instance can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.
The Switch Index, fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB as the index value to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.
The [FC SW 3] standard for an interconnecting Fabric consisting of multiple Fabric Switch elements describes the operation of a single Fabric in a physical infrastructure.
The current [FC SW 4] standard also supports the operation of multiple Virtual Fabrics operating within one (or more) physical infrastructures.
In such a scenario, each Fabric has, of course, its own management instrumentation.
In order to accommodate this scenario, this MIB module defines all Fabric related information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index".
In a Fabric that is conformant to [FC SW 3], the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.
It is quite possible, and may even become likely, that (a port of) a Fibre Channel switch will be connected to multiple such Fabrics.
Thus, in order to simplify a query concerning all the Fabrics to which a single switch is connected, fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FamFabricIndex when they both appear in the same INDEX clause.
This group contains basic information about the Fabric Address Manager functionality within a switch, including its configuration parameters that are per interface (i.e., specified for a particular Fibre Channel interface identified by an ifIndex value).
This group contains information about which switches are assigned to which domains.
This group contains information about which Port IDs have been assigned within the areas of the local domain.
This conditional mandatory group contains information about all the FC address identifier assignments that have been recently released.
This cache is kept to support the concept of Preferred Domain ID via a best effort attempt for (short term) re assignment of the same FC address identifiers.
This optional group contains objects used for initiating an operation on a Fabric.
This group contains notifications of significant events concerning the Fabric Address management functionality within a switch.
Use of RCF and BF Included in [FC SW 3] is the specification of Reconfigure Fabric (RCF) and Build Fabric (BF), both of which are command codes of the Switch Fabric Internal Link Service (SW ILS).
[FC SW 3] includes the warning: NOTE 13
Since the RCF causes a complete reconfiguration of the Fabric, and may cause addresses allocated to a Switch to change, this SW ILS should be used with caution.
The BF SW ILS allows the Fabric to attempt reconfiguration without loss of or change of address and therefore should be attempted before an RCF.
Examples of situations in which RCF may be appropriate include resolution of overlapped Domains, or the failure of a Fabric Reconfiguration initiated by a BF.
A Fabric is prohibited from autonomously generating an RCF, but an outside administrative function may request a switch to generate an RCF.
Such an administrative function is outside the scope of this technical report.
The T11 FC FABRIC ADDR MGR MIB defined in this document is consistent with both of the above quotes since it defines two objects, t11FamAutoReconfigure and t11FamRestart, which are defined with a MAX ACCESS of read write, and setting them to the appropriate value is a means by which "an outside administrative function may request a switch to generate an RCF" [FC MI].
Note, however, the MIB specifies in its compliance section that the minimum required level of support for these two objects is read only.
Further, for both t11FamAutoReconfigure and t11FamRestart, the MIB serves only as a request to generate; it does not represent the action of the RCF or BF.
That is, a successful SNMP SetRequest on these objects will cause an RCF (or BF) to be sent, but SNMP does not/cannot ensure the successful operation of the SW ILS operation.

"The configured Domain ID of the particular switch on this Fabric, or zero if no Domain ID has been configured.
The meaning of this object depends on t11FamConfigDomainIdType object.
If t11FamConfigDomainIdType is 'preferred', then the configured Domain ID is called the 'preferred Domain ID'.
Valid values are between 0 and 239.
In a situation where this Domain ID cannot be assigned, any other Domain ID will be acceptable.
A value of zero means any Domain ID.
If t11FamConfigDomainIdType is 'insistent', then the configured Domain ID is called the 'insistent Domain ID' and valid values are between 1 and 239.
In a situation where this Domain ID cannot be assigned, no other Domain ID is acceptable.
In both of the above cases, the switch sends an RDI (Request Domain ID) to request this Domain ID to the Principal Switch.
If no Domain ID is able to be granted in the case of 'preferred', or if an 'insistent' Domain ID is configured but not able to be granted, then it is an error condition.
When this error occurs, the switch will continue as if it receives a SW RJT with a reason/explanation of 'Unable to perform command request'/'Domain ID not available'.
That is, its E Ports on that Fabric will be isolated and
the administrator informed via a 't11FamDomainIdNotAssigned' notification.
If t11FamConfigDomainIdType is 'static', then the configured Domain ID is called the 'static Domain ID' and valid values are between 1 and 239.
In this situation, there is no Principal Switch in the Fabric and the Domain ID
is simply assigned by configuration, together with the Fabric Name.
A switch configured with a static Domain ID, on receiving an EFP, BF, RCF, DIA, or RDI SW ILS, shall reply with an SW RJT having
Reason Code Explanation 'E Port is Isolated' and shall isolate the receiving E Port.

IANA Considerations IANA has made two MIB OID assignments, one for the T11 TC MIB module and one for the T11 FC FABRIC ADDR MGR MIB module, under the appropriate subtree(s). 11.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
ability to change the address allocation policy.
ability to cause a fabric reconfiguration, e.g., on certain error conditions.
ability to affect which switch becomes the Principal Switch.
t11FamRcFabricNotifyEnable   ability to enable/disable a notification.
t11FamIfRcfReject   ability to change the switch's behavior on receipt of an RCF.
t11FamIfRowStatus   ability to change an interface configuration parameter.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may also be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
t11FamTable and t11FamIfTable   contain the configuration, status, and statistics of the Fabric Address Manager.
contain information on currently assigned or recently  released addresses.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
