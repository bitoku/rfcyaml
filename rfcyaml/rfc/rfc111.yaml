  - "                       Pressure from the Chairman\n RFC's obsoleted:  none;\n\
    \ RFC's updated:  107]\nIt is time to set serious schedules for the implementation\
    \ of NCP's  and\nTelnets.   To  facilitate  matters,  John  Heafner of Rand has\
    \ agreed to\nmonitor each site's progress and test its implementation.\nNetwork\
    \ Liaison Contacts are hereby responsible for preparing a schedule\nfor  implementation\
    \  and  informing  John.  Such a schedule must include\ndates of\n   (a)  implementation\
    \ of an NCP according to the specifications\n        in Document #1 as modified\
    \ by RFC #107;\n   (b)  implementation of a user-Telnet which enables local users\
    \ to\n        login to foreign Hosts;\n   (c)  implementation of a server-Telnet\
    \ which enables foreign users to\n        login on your Host;\n   (d)  documentation\
    \ of the mechanism for connecting to and logging in\n        to your Host;\n \
    \  (e)  documentation of the mechanism for obtaining job numbers,\n        passwords,\
    \ etc. to your Host;\n   (f)  documentation of the services available on your\
    \ Host; and\n   (e) regular operation at advertised hours.\nJohn is hereby responsible\
    \  for  prodding  Host  teams  to  prodcue  the\nrequisite  schedule,  software\
    \  and  documentation;  for testing out the\nadvertised  implementations;  and\
    \  for  probing  and  understanding  the\nreasons  for  unseemly  delays.   Concomitantly,\
    \  John  is now the right\nperson  to  complain   to   about   ambiguities,  \
    \ insufficiencies   and\nmisunderstandings of the protocols.\n   Thank you for\
    \ your cooperation.\n               Steve Crocker\n       [ This RFC was put into\
    \ machine readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by\
    \ Josh Elliott 1/98 ]\n"
