Abstract This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Line Code Specific parameters of Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL)
interfaces using Single Carrier Modulation (SCM) Line Coding.
It is an optional extension to the VDSL LINE MIB, RFC 3728, which handles line code independent objects.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This document describes an SNMP MIB module for managing the Line Code Dependent, Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) Layer of SCM VDSL Lines.
These definitions are based upon the specifications for VDSL as defined in T1E1, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) documentation [T1E1311, T1E1011, T1E1013, ETSI2701, ETSI2702, ITU9931, ITU9971].
Additionally the protocol dependent (and line code dependent) management framework for VDSL lines specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [DSLFTR57] and [DSLFWT96].
The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "SHOULD" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Relationship of this MIB Module to Other MIB Modules
The relationship of the VDSL Line MIB module to other MIB modules, in particular to the IF MIB presented in RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is discussed in the VDSL LINE MIB, RFC 3728 [RFC3728].
This section outlines the relationship of this VDSL Line Extension MIB to the VDSL LINE MIB, RFC 3728 [RFC3728].

The SCM VDSL Line Extension MIB contains the following MIB group:
: This group supports MIB objects for defining configuration profiles and for monitoring individual bands of Single Carrier Modulation (SCM)
It contains the following tables: vdslLineSCMConfProfileTxBandTable vdslSCMPhysBandTable
If the SCM VDSL Line Extension MIB is implemented then all objects in this group MUST be implemented.
Figure 1 below displays the relationship of the tables in the vdslSCMGroup to the vdslGroup and to the ifEntry: ifEntry(ifType 97)
When the object vdslLineCoding is set to SCM, vdslLineConfProfileName is used as the index to vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTable.
The existence of an entry in any of the tables of the vdslSCMGroup is optional.
Persistence All read create objects defined in this MIB module SHOULD be stored persistently.
Following is an exhaustive list of these persistent objects: vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandId vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandUsage vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandCenterFrequency vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandSymbolRate vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandConstellationSize vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTransmitPSDLevel vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandRowStatus
vdslLineSCMPhysBandPerformanceBandSnrMgn vdslLineSCMPhysBandPerformanceBandAtn Note also that the interface indices in this MIB are maintained persistently.
Access Control Model (VACM) data relating to these SHOULD be stored persistently as well [RFC3415].
3.  Conformance and Compliance An SCM based VDSL agent does not have to implement this MIB to be compliant with RFC 3728
If the SCM VDSL Line Extension MIB is implemented then the following group is mandatory:  vdslSCMGroup 4.

The VDSL LINE MIB found in RFC 3728 defines objects for the management of a pair of VDSL transceivers at each end of the VDSL line.
The VDSL LINE MIB configures and monitors the line code independent parameters (TC layer) of the VDSL line.
This MIB module is an optional extension of the VDSL LINE MIB and defines objects for configuration and monitoring of the line code specific (LCS) elements (PMD layer) for VDSL lines using SCM coding.
The objects in this extension MIB MUST NOT be used for VDSL lines using Multiple Carrier Modulation (MCM) line coding.
If an object in this extension MIB is referenced by a line which does not use SCM, it has no effect on the operation of that line.
Naming Conventions: Vtuc   VDSL transceiver at near (Central) end of line Vtur   VDSL transceiver at Remote end of line Vtu    One of either Vtuc or Vtur Curr

This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4069: see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
Attributes with this syntax identify the SCM Band referred to.
"This table contains transmit band descriptor configuration information for a VDSL line.
Each entry in this table reflects the configuration for one of possibly many bands of a single carrier modulation (SCM) VDSL line.
For each profile which is associated with a VDSL line using SCM line coding, five entries in this table will exist, one for each of the five bands.
Bands which are not in use will be marked as unused.
These entries are defined by a manager and can be used to configure the VDSL line.
If an entry in this table is referenced by a line which does not use SCM, it has no effect on the operation of that line."
"Each entry consists of a list of parameters that represents the configuration of a single carrier modulation VDSL modem transmit band.
A default profile with an index of 'DEFVAL', will always exist and its parameters will be set to vendor specific values, unless otherwise specified in this document.
All read create objects defined in this MIB module SHOULD be stored persistently.
current DESCRIPTION "The BandId for this entry, which specifies which band is being referred to."
"Indicates whether this band is in use.
If set to True this band is in use."
"The requested symbol rate in baud.
"The requested transmit power spectral density for the VDSL modem.
The Actual value in  0.25 dBm/Hz."
"This object is used to create a new row or modify or delete an existing row in this table.
A profile activated by setting this object to `active'.
When `active' is set, the system will validate the profile.
None of the columns in this row may be modified while the row is in the `active' state.
Before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service, (by setting this object to `destroy' or `notInService')
it must be first unreferenced from all associated lines."
"This table provides one row for each SCM Vtu band.
This table is read only as it reflects the current physical parameters of each band.
For each ifIndex which is associated with a VDSL line using SCM line coding, five entries in this table will exist, one for each of the five bands.
Bands which are not in use will be marked as unused."
An entry in the vdslLineSCMPhysBandTable.
current DESCRIPTION "The BandId for this entry, which specifies which band is being referred to."

"Indicates whether this band is in use.
If set to True this band is in use."
The current center frequency in Hz for this band.
The current value of the symbol rate in baud for this band.

{ vdslLineExtSCMConformance 2 } vdslLineExtSCMMibCompliance MODULE COMPLIANCE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"The compliance statement for SNMP entities which manage VDSL interfaces."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTable vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandInUse, vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTransmitPSDLevel, vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandSymbolRate, vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandConstellationSize, vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandCenterFrequency, vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandRowStatus VDSL layer connectivity from the Vtur will permit the subscriber to manipulate both the VDSL link directly and the VDSL embedded operations channel (EOC) for their own loop.
For example, unchecked or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either the management interface to the network or the element manager.
Additionally, allowing write access to configuration data may allow an end user to increase their service levels or affect other end  users in either a positive or negative manner.
For this reason, the tables and objects listed above should be considered to contain sensitive information.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: vdslLineSCMPhysBandInUse, vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrPSDLevel, vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrSymbolRate, vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrConstellationSize, vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrCenterFrequency, vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrSnrMgn
access of the physical band parameters may provide knowledge to an end user that would allow malicious behavior, for example the application of an intentional interference on one or all of the physical bands in use.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of a MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The IANA has assigned the transmission value 228 to VDSL LINE EXT  SCM MIB.
