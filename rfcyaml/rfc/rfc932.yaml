- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   Several recent RFCs have discussed the need for a \"subnet\"\
    \ structure\n   within the internet addressing scheme, and have proposed strategies\n\
    \   for \"subnetwork\" addressing and routing.  In particular, Jeff Mogul\n  \
    \ in his RFC-917, \"Internet Subnets\", describes an addressing scheme in\n  \
    \ which a variable number of the leading bits of the host portion of\n   the address\
    \ are used to identify the subnet.  The drawback to this\n   scheme is that it\
    \ is necessary to modify the host implementation in\n   order to implement it.\
    \  While the modification is a simple one, it is\n   necessary to retrofit it\
    \ into all implementations, including those\n   which are already in the field.\
    \ (See RFC-917 by Mogul for various\n   alternative approaches to this problem,\
    \ such as using Address\n   Resolution Protocol.)\n   This RFC proposes an alternative\
    \ addressing scheme for subnets which,\n   in most cases, requires no modification\
    \ to host software whatsoever.\n   The drawbacks of this scheme are that the total\
    \ number of subnets in\n   any one network are limited, and that modification\
    \ is required to all\n   gateways.\n"
- title: THE PROPOSAL
  contents:
  - "THE PROPOSAL\n   In this scheme, the individual subnets of a network are numbered\n\
    \   using Class C addresses.  Since it is necessary with this scheme that\n  \
    \ a Class C address used to number a subnet be distinguishable from a\n   Class\
    \ C address used to number an isolated network, we will reserve\n   for subnetworks\
    \ the upper half of the Class C address space, in other\n   words all those Class\
    \ C addresses for which the high order bit is on.\n   When a network is to be\
    \ organized as a series of subnetworks, a block\n   of these reserved Class C\
    \ addresses will be assigned to that network,\n   specifically a block of 256\
    \ addresses having the two first bytes\n   identical.  Thus, the various subnetworks\
    \ of a network are\n   distinguished by the third byte of the Internet address.\
    \  (This\n   addressing scheme implies the limitation that there can only be 256\n\
    \   subnetworks in a net.  If more networks are required, two blocks will\n  \
    \ have to be allocated, and the total viewed as two separate networks.)\n"

- title: A Subnetwork Addressing Scheme
  contents:
  - "A Subnetwork Addressing Scheme\n   The gateways and hosts attached to this subnetted\
    \ network use these\n   addresses as ordinary Class C addresses.  Thus, no modification\
    \ to\n   any host software is required for hosts attached to a subnetwork.\n \
    \  For gateways not directly attached to the subnetted network, it is an\n   unacceptable\
    \ burden to separately store the routing information to\n   each of the subnets.\
    \ The goal of any subnet addressing scheme is to\n   provide a strategy by which\
    \ distant gateways can store routing\n   information for the network as a whole.\
    \  In this scheme, since the\n   first two bytes of the address is the same for\
    \ every subnet in the\n   network, those first two bytes can be stored and manipulated\
    \ as if\n   they are a single Class B address by a distant gateway. These\n  \
    \ addresses, which can be used either as a Class B or Class C address\n   as appropriate,\
    \ have been informally called Class \"B 1/2\" addresses.\n   In more detail, a\
    \ gateway would treat Class C addresses as follows\n   under the scheme.  First,\
    \ test to see whether the high order bit of\n   the address is on.  If not, the\
    \ address is an ordinary Class C\n   address and should be treated as such.\n\
    \   If the bit is on, this Class C address identifies a subnet of a\n   network.\
    \  Test to see if this gateway is attached to that network.\n   If so, treat the\
    \ address as an ordinary Class C address.\n   If the gateway is not attached to\
    \ the network containing that\n   subnetwork, discard the third byte of the Class\
    \ C address and treat\n   the resulting two bytes as a Class B address.  Note\
    \ that there can be\n   no conflict between this two-byte pattern and an ordinary\
    \ Class B\n   address, because the first bits of this address are not those of\
    \ a\n   valid Class B address, but rather those of a Class C address.\n"
- title: OPTIMIZATIONS
  contents:
  - "OPTIMIZATIONS\n   If a network grows to more than 256 subnetworks, it will be\
    \ necessary\n   to design two distinct blocks of special Class C addresses, and\
    \ to\n   view this aggregate as two separate networks.  However, the gateways\n\
    \   of these two networks can, by proper design, run a joint routing\n   algorithm\
    \ which maintains optimal routes between the two halves, even\n   if they are\
    \ connected together by a number of gateways.\n   Indeed, in general it is possible\
    \ for gateways that are not directly\n   attached to a subnetworked network to\
    \ be specially programmed to\n   remember the individual Class C addresses, if\
    \ doing so provides\n   greatly improved network efficiency in some particular\
    \ case.\n   It was stated earlier that no modification to the host software is\n\
    \   necessary to implement this scheme.  There is one case in which a\n"

- title: A Subnetwork Addressing Scheme
  contents:
  - "A Subnetwork Addressing Scheme\n   minor modification may prove helpful.  Consider\
    \ the case of a distant\n   host, not immediately attached to this subnetworked\
    \ network.  That\n   host, even though at a distance, will nonetheless maintain\
    \ separate\n   routing entries for each of the distinct subnetwork addresses about\n\
    \   which it has any knowledge.  For most hosts, storing this information\n  \
    \ for each subnet represents no problem, because most implementations\n   do not\
    \ try to remember routing information about every network\n   address in the Internet,\
    \ but only those addresses that are of current\n   interest.  If, however, for\
    \ some reason the host has a table which\n   attempts to remember routing information\
    \ about every Internet address\n   it has ever seen, than that host should be\
    \ programmed to understand\n   the gateway's algorithm for collapsing the addresses\
    \ of distant\n   subnets from three bytes to two.  However, it is not a recommended\n\
    \   implementation strategy for the host to maintain this degree of\n   routing\
    \ information, so under normal circumstances, the host need not\n   be concerned\
    \ with the C to B conversion.\n"
- title: DRAWBACK
  contents:
  - "DRAWBACK\n   The major drawback of this scheme is that any implementation storing\n\
    \   large tables of addresses must be changed to know the \"B 1/2\"\n   conversion\
    \ rule. Most importantly, all gateways must be programmed to\n   know this rule.\
    \  Thus, adoption of this scheme will require a\n   scheduled mandatory change\
    \ by every gateway implementation.  The\n   difficulty of organizing this is unknown.\n"
- title: OTHER VARIATIONS
  contents:
  - "OTHER VARIATIONS\n   It is possible to imagine other variations on the patterns\
    \ of\n   collapsing addresses.  For example, 256 Class B addresses could be\n\
    \   gathered together and collapsed into one Class A address.  However,\n   since\
    \ the first three bits of the resulting Class A address would be\n   constrained,\
    \ this would permit only 32 such subnetted networks to\n   exist.  A more interesting\
    \ alternative would be to permit the\n   collapse of Class C addresses into a\
    \ single Class A address.  It is\n   not entirely obvious the best way of organizing\
    \ the sub-fields of\n   this address, but this combination would permit a few\
    \ very large nets\n   of subnets to be assembled within the Internet.\n   The\
    \ most interesting variation of \"B 1/2\" addresses is to increase\n   the number\
    \ of bits used to identify the subnet by taking bits from\n   the resulting Class\
    \ B address.  For example, if 10 bits were used to\n   identify the subnet (providing\
    \ 1024 subnets per network), then the\n   gateway, when forming the equivalent\
    \ address, would not only drop the\n   third byte but also mask the last two bits\
    \ of the B address.  Since\n   the first three bits of the address are constrained,\
    \ this would leave\n   13 bits for the network number, or 8192 possible subnetworked\n"
