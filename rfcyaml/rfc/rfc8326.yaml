  - "1.  Introduction\n   Routing changes in BGP can be caused by planned maintenance\n
    \  operations.  This document defines a well-known community [RFC1997],\n   called
    GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN, for the purpose of reducing the management\n   overhead of
    gracefully shutting down BGP sessions.  The well-known\n   community allows implementers
    to provide an automated graceful\n   shutdown mechanism that does not require
    any router reconfiguration\n   at maintenance time.\n   This document discusses
    operational procedures to be applied in order\n   to reduce or eliminate loss
    of packets during a maintenance\n   operation.  Loss comes from transient lack
    of reachability during BGP\n   convergence that follows the shutdown of an EBGP
    peering session\n   between two Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs).\n   This
    document presents procedures for the cases where the forwarding\n   plane is impacted
    by the maintenance, hence for when the use of\n   Graceful Restart does not apply.\n
    \  The procedures described in this document can be applied to reduce or\n   avoid
    packet loss for outbound and inbound traffic flows initially\n   forwarded along
    the peering link to be shut down.  In both Autonomous\n   Systems (ASes), these
    procedures trigger rerouting to alternate paths\n   if they exist within the AS
    while allowing the use of the old path\n   until alternate ones are learned.  This
    ensures that routers always\n   have a valid route available during the convergence
    process.\n   The goal of the document is to meet the requirements described in\n
    \  [RFC6198] as best possible without changing BGP.\n   Other maintenance cases,
    such as the shutdown of an IBGP session or\n   the establishment of an EBGP session,
    are out of scope for this\n   document.  For informational purposes, they are
    briefly discussed in\n   Appendix C.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when,
    they appear in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   graceful shutdown initiator\n      A router on which the
    session shutdown is performed for the\n      maintenance.\n   graceful shutdown

  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Packet Loss upon Manual EBGP Session Shutdown\n   Packets can be lost during
    the BGP convergence following a manual\n   shut down of an EBGP session for two
    reasons.\n   First, some routers can have no path toward an affected prefix and\n
    \  drop traffic destined to this prefix.  This is because alternate\n   paths
    can be hidden by nodes of an AS.  This happens when the\n   extension defined
    in [RFC7911] is not used and a) the paths are not\n   selected as best by the
    ASBRs that receive them on an EBGP session or\n   b) Route Reflectors do not propagate
    the paths further in the IBGP\n   topology because they do not select them as
    best.\n   Second, the FIB can be inconsistent between routers within the AS,\n
    \  and packets toward affected prefixes can loop and be dropped unless\n   encapsulation
    is used within the AS.\n   This document only addresses the first reason.\n"

  - "4.  Procedure for EBGP Graceful Shutdown\n   This section describes configurations
    and actions to be performed for\n   the graceful shutdown of EBGP peering links.\n
    \  The goal of this procedure is to retain the paths to be shut down\n   between
    the peers, but with a lower LOCAL_PREF value, allowing the\n   paths to remain
    in use while alternate paths are selected and\n   propagated, rather than simply
    withdrawing the paths.  The LOCAL_PREF\n   value SHOULD be lower than any of the
    alternative paths.  The\n   RECOMMENDED value is 0.\n   Note that some alternative
    techniques with limited applicability are\n   discussed in Appendix A for informational
    purposes.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Pre-configuration\n   On each ASBR supporting the graceful shutdown receiver
      procedure, an\n   inbound BGP route policy is applied on all EBGP sessions of
      the ASBR.\n   That policy:\n   o  matches the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community.\n
      \  o  sets the LOCAL_PREF attribute of the paths tagged with the\n      GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN
      community to a low value.\n   For informational purposes, examples of configurations
      are provided\n   in Appendix B.\n"

  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Operations at Maintenance Time\n   On the graceful shutdown initiator,
      at maintenance time, the\n   operator:\n   o  applies an outbound BGP route
      policy on the EBGP session to be\n      shutdown.  This policy tags the paths
      propagated over the session\n      with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community.  This
      will trigger the BGP\n      implementation to re-advertise all active routes
      previously\n      advertised and tag them with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community.\n
      \  o  applies an inbound BGP route policy on the EBGP session to be\n      shutdown.
      \ This policy tags the paths received over the session\n      with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN
      community and sets LOCAL_PREF to a low\n      value.\n   o  waits for route
      re-advertisement over the EBGP session and for BGP\n      routing convergence
      on both ASBRs.\n   o  shuts down the EBGP session, optionally using [RFC8203]
      to\n      communicate the reason for the shutdown.\n   In the case of a shutdown
      of the whole router, in addition to the\n   graceful shutdown of all EBGP sessions,
      there is a need to gracefully\n   shut down the routes originated by this router
      (e.g., BGP aggregates\n   redistributed from other protocols, including static
      routes).  This\n   can be performed by tagging these routes with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN\n
      \  community and setting LOCAL_PREF to a low value.\n"

      - "C.2.2.  IBGP Convergence\n   During the establishment of an EBGP session,
        in some corner cases, a\n   router may have no path toward an affected prefix,
        leading to loss of\n   connectivity.\n   A typical example for such transient
        unreachability for a given\n   prefix is the following:\n      Consider three
        Route Reflectors (RR): RR1, RR2, RR3.  There is a\n      full mesh of IBGP
        sessions between them.\n      1.  RR1 is initially advertising the current
        best path to the\n          members of its IBGP RR full mesh.  It propagated
        that path\n          within its RR full-mesh.  RR2 knows only that path toward
        the\n          prefix.\n      2.  RR3 receives a new best path originated
        by the startup\n          initiator, which is one of its RR clients.  RR3
        selects it as\n          best and propagates an UPDATE within its RR full
        mesh, i.e.,\n          to RR1 and RR2.\n      3.  RR1 receives that path,
        reruns its decision process, and picks\n          this new path as best.  As
        a result, RR1 withdraws its\n          previously announced best path on the
        IBGP sessions of its RR\n          full mesh.\n      4.  If, for any reason,
        RR3 processes the withdraw generated in\n          step 3 before processing
        the update generated in step 2, RR3\n          transiently suffers from unreachability
        for the affected\n          prefix.\n   The use of [RFC7911] or [BEST-EXTERNAL]
        among the RR of the IBGP full\n   mesh can solve these corner cases by ensuring
        that within an AS, the\n   advertisement of a new route is not translated
        into the withdraw of a\n   former route.\n   Indeed, advertising the best
        external route ensures that an ASBR does\n   not withdraw a previously advertised
        (EBGP) path when it receives an\n   additional, preferred path over an IBGP
        session.  Also, advertising\n   the best intra-cluster route ensures that
        an RR does not withdraw a\n   previously advertised (IBGP) path to its non-clients
