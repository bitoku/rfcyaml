  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a method to split the control plane (CP)
    and\n   user plane (UP) for a network infrastructure based on Proxy Mobile\n   IPv6
    (PMIPv6).  Existing specifications allow a mobile access gateway\n   (MAG) to
    separate its control and user plane using the Alternate\n   Care-of Address mobility
    option for IPv6 or Alternate IPv4 Care-of\n   Address option for IPv4.  However,
    the current specification does not\n   provide any mechanism allowing the local
    mobility anchor (LMA) to\n   perform an analogous functional split.  To remedy
    that shortcoming,\n   this document specifies a mobility option enabling an LMA
    to provide\n   an alternate LMA address to be used for the bidirectional user-plane\n
    \  traffic between the MAG and LMA.  With this new option, an LMA will\n   be
    able to use an IP address for its user plane that is different\n   than the IP
    address used for the control plane.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) infrastructure comprises two
    primary\n   entities: LMA (local mobility anchor) and MAG (mobile access\n   gateway).
    \ The interface between the MAG and LMA consists of the\n   control plane and
    user plane.  The control plane is responsible for\n   signaling messages between
    the MAG and LMA, such as the Proxy Binding\n   Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding
    Acknowledgement (PBA) messages to\n   establish a mobility binding.  In addition,
    the control-plane\n   components in the MAG and LMA are also responsible for setting
    up and\n   tearing down a bidirectional tunnel between the MAG and LMA.  The\n
    \  user plane is used for carrying the mobile node's IP traffic between\n   the
    MAG and the LMA over the bidirectional tunnel.\n   Widely deployed mobility management
    systems for wireless\n   communications require separation of IP transport for
    forwarding\n   user-plane and control-plane traffic.  This separation offers more\n
    \  flexible deployment options for LMA and MAG entities in Proxy Mobile\n   IPv6,
    as described in [MOBILE-SEPARATION].  To meet this requirement\n   would also
    require that the control-plane functions of the LMA be\n   addressable at a different
    IP address than the IP address assigned\n   for the user plane.  However, PMIPv6
    does not currently specify a\n   mechanism for allowing the LMA to separate the
    control plane from the\n   user plane.  The LMA is currently required to associate
    the IP\n   address of the tunnel source with the target IP address for the\n   control
    messages received from the MAG.\n   The control-plane and user-plane components
    of a MAG or LMA are\n   typically co-located in the same physical entity.  However,
    there are\n   situations where it is desirable to have the control and user plane\n
    \  of a MAG or LMA in separate physical entities.  For example, in a\n   WLAN
    (Wireless LAN) network, it may be desirable to have the control-\n   plane component
    of the MAG reside on the Access Controller (also\n   sometimes referred to as
    Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)) while the\n   user-plane component of the MAG resides
    on the WLAN Access Point.\n   This enables all the control-plane messages to the
    LMA to be\n   centralized while the user plane would be distributed across the\n
    \  multiple Access Points.  Similarly, there is a need for either the\n   control-plane
    or user-plane component of the LMA to be separated\n   according to different
    scaling requirements or, in other cases, the\n   need to centralize the control
    plane in one geographical location\n   while distributing the user-plane component
    across multiple\n   locations.  For example, as illustrated in Figure 1, the LMA
    and MAG\n   could have one control session established for PMIPv6 control\n   signaling
    while maintaining separate connectivity via Generic Routing\n   Encapsulation
    (GRE) or IP-in-IP tunneling for forwarding user-plane\n   traffic.\n                     MAG

    \  MN: Mobile Node\n   CP: Control Plane\n   UP: User Plane\n       Figure 1:
    Functional Separation of the Control and User Plane\n   [RFC6463] and [RFC6275]
    enable separating the control and user plane\n   in the MAG.  In particular, [RFC6463]
    defines the Alternate IPv4\n   Care-of Address option, and [RFC6275] defines an
    Alternate Care-of\n   Address option for IPv6.  The MAG may provide an Alternate
    Care-of\n   Address in the PBU, and if the LMA supports this option, then a\n
    \  bidirectional tunnel is set up between the LMA address and the MAG's\n   Alternate
    Care-of Address.  However, these documents do not specify a\n   corresponding
    option for the LMA to provide an alternate tunnel\n   endpoint address to the
    MAG.\n   This specification therefore defines a new mobility option that\n   enables
    a local mobility anchor to provide an alternate LMA address\n   to be used for
    the bidirectional tunnel between the MAG and LMA, as\n   shown in Figure 1.\n
    \  The LMA control-plane and the LMA user-plane functions are typically\n   deployed
    on the same IP node, and in such a scenario, the interface\n   between these functions
    is internal to the implementation.\n   Deployments may also choose to deploy the
    LMA control-plane and the\n   LMA user-plane functions on separate IP nodes.  In
    such deployment\n   models, there needs to be a protocol interface between these
    two\n   functions, but that is outside the scope of this document.  Possible\n
    \  options for such an interface include OpenFlow\n   [OpenFlow-Spec-v1.4.0],
    Forwarding and Control Element Separation\n   (ForCES) [RFC5810], use of routing
    infrastructure [STATELESS-UPLANE],\n   and vendor-specific approaches.  This specification
    does not mandate\n   a specific protocol interface and views this interface as
    a generic\n   interface relevant more broadly for many other protocol systems
    in\n   addition to Proxy Mobile IPv6.  When the LMA control-plane and the\n   LMA
    user-plane functions are deployed on separate IP nodes, the\n   requirement related
    to user-plane address anchoring (specified in\n   Section 5.6.2 of [RFC5213] and
    Section 3.1.3 of [RFC5844]) must be\n   met by the node hosting the LMA user-plane
    functionality.  The LMA\n   user-plane node must be a topological anchor point
    for the IP\n   address/prefixes allocated to the mobile node.\n"

  - "5.  Protocol Configuration Variable\n   This specification defines the following
    configuration variable,\n   which must be configurable (e.g., by the system management)
    on the\n   LMA and MAG mobility entities.  The configured value for this\n   protocol
    variable MUST survive server reboots and service restarts\n   and MUST be the
    same for every LMA and MAG in the network domain\n   supporting PMIPv6.\n   Domain-wide-LMA-UPA-Support\n
    \        This variable indicates whether or not all the mobility\n         entities
    in the PMIPv6 domain support the LMA User-Plane\n         Address mobility option.\n
    \        When this variable on the MAG is set to zero (0), the MAG MUST\n         indicate
    whether or not it supports this feature by including\n         the LMA User-Plane
    Address mobility option in the PBU.  If the\n         option is not present in
    the PBU, the LMA SHALL disable this\n         feature for the mobility session
    corresponding to the PBU.\n         Setting this variable to one (1) on the MAG
    indicates that\n         there is domain-wide support for this feature and the
    MAG is\n         not required to include the LMA User-Plane Address mobility\n
    \        option in the PBA.  In this case, the MAG MAY choose not to\n         include
    the LMA User-Plane Address mobility option in the PBU.\n         When this variable
    on the LMA is set to zero (0), the LMA MUST\n         NOT include the LMA User-Plane
    Address mobility option in the\n         PBA unless the MAG has indicated support
    for this feature by\n         including the LMA User-Plane Address mobility option
    in the PBU\n         message.\n         Setting this variable to one (1) on the
    LMA indicates that\n         there is domain-wide support for this feature and
    the LMA\n         SHOULD choose to include this LMA User-Plane Address mobility\n
    \        option in the PBA even if the option is not present in the PBU\n         message.\n

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213]
    requires the signaling\n   messages between the MAG and the LMA to be protected
    using end-to-end\n   security association(s) offering integrity and data origin\n
    \  authentication.  The Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification also requires\n   IPsec
    [RFC4301] to be a mandatory-to-implement security mechanism.\n   This document
    specifies an approach where the control-plane and user-\n   plane functions of
    the MAG and LMA are separated and hosted on\n   different IP nodes.  In such deployment
    models, the nodes hosting\n   those respective control-plane functions still have
    to meet the\n   [RFC5213] security requirement listed above; specifically, the
    Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 signaling messages exchanged between these entities MUST\n
    \  be protected using end-to-end security association(s) offering\n   integrity
    and data origin authentication.  Furthermore, IPsec is a\n   mandatory-to-implement
    security mechanism for the nodes hosting the\n   control-plane function of the
    MAG and LMA.  Additional documents may\n   specify alternative security mechanisms
    for securing Proxy Mobile\n   IPv6 signaling messages.  The mobility entities
    in a Proxy Mobile\n   IPv6 domain can enable a specific security mechanism based
    on either\n   (1) static configuration or (2) dynamic negotiation (using any\n
    \  standard security negotiation protocols).\n   As per the Proxy Mobile IPv6
    specification, the use of IPsec for\n   protecting the mobile node's user-plane
    traffic is optional.  This\n   specification keeps the same requirement and therefore
    requires the\n   nodes hosting the user-plane functions of the MAG and the LMA
    to have\n   IPsec as a mandatory-to-implement security mechanism but make the
    use\n   of IPsec optional for user-plane traffic protection.\n   The LMA User-Plane
    Address mobility option defined in this\n   specification is for use in PBU and
    PBA messages.  This option is\n   carried like any other mobility header option
    as specified in\n   [RFC5213].  Therefore, it inherits security guidelines from\n
    \  [RFC5213].\n   The IP address of the LMA user plane (the LMA-UPA), provided
    within\n   the LMA User-Plane Address mobility option, MUST be a valid address\n
    \  under the administrative control associated with the LMA functional\n   block.\n
    \  If the LMA user-plane and the LMA control-plane functions are hosted\n   in
    different entities, any control messages between these two\n   entities containing
    the LMA User-Plane Address mobility option MUST\n   be protected using end-to-end
    security association(s) offering\n   integrity and data origin authentication.\n"
