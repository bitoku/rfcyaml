  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"A URN Namespace for IETF Documents\" [RFC2648] defines\
    \ the \"ietf\" URN\n   namespace and a number of sub-namespaces.  \"An IETF URN\
    \ Sub-namespace\n   for Registered Protocol Parameters\" [RFC3553] defines an\
    \ additional\n   sub-namespace, \"params\", and creates a registry to document\n\
    \   allocations under that.  But there is no registry that lists, in one\n   place,\

- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   There is currently a top-level registry group called\
    \ \"IETF Protocol\n   Parameter Identifiers\", which contains one registry, \"\
    IETF URN Sub-\n   namespace for Registered Protocol Parameters\".  IANA has taken\
    \ the\n   following three actions:\n   Action 1: Renamed the group \"IETF Protocol\
    \ Parameter Identifiers\",\n   giving it the new name \"Uniform Resource Name\
    \ (URN) Namespace for\n   IETF Use\".  The existing registry in that group remains,\
    \ and its name\n   is unchanged.  Its registration procedure has been updated\
    \ to \"IETF\n   Review\" (formerly called \"IETF Consensus\").\n   Action 2: Added\
    \ a new registry to the renamed group.  The new\n   registry is called \"IETF\
    \ URN Sub-namespaces\", and new registrations\n   will use the IETF Review policy\
    \ [RFC5226], which provides for IETF\n   consensus in order to add a new URN namespace\
    \ under \"ietf\".  The new\n   registry appears first in the group, to provide\
    \ a human-friendly,\n   top-down resolution of the namespace hierarchy.\n   Action\
    \ 3: Populated the new registry as follows:\n   IETF URN Sub-namespaces\n   Registration\
    \ Procedures: IETF Review\n   Reference: [RFC6924]\n   Note: This is the Official\
    \ Registry for sub-namespaces of the 'IETF'\n   URN Namespace.\n   Sub-namespace\
