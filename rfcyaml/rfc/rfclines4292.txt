Abstract This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects related to the forwarding of Internet Protocol (IP) packets in an IP version  independent manner.
This document obsoletes RFC 2096.
This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use in managing objects related to the forwarding of Internet Protocol (IP) packets in an IP version independent manner.
It should be noted that the MIB definition described herein does not support multiple instances based on the same address family type.
However, it does support an instance of the MIB per address family.

The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The MIB consists of one current table and two current global objects.
The object inetCidrRouteNumber indicates the number of current routes.
This is primarily to avoid having to read the table in order to determine this number.
The object inetCidrRouteDiscards counts the number of valid routes that were discarded from inetCidrRouteTable for any reason.
This object replaces the ipRoutingDiscards and
The inetCidrRouteTable provides the ability to display IP version independent multipath CIDR routes.
This MIB definition contains several deprecated and obsolete tables and objects.
The following subsections describe the relationship between these objects and other MIB modules.
The ipRouteTable object was originally defined in RFC 1213 [RFC1213].
It was updated by ipForwardTable in RFC 1354 [RFC1354].
The ipForwardTable object replaced the ipRouteTable object from RFC 1213.
It was in turn obsoleted by the ipCidrRouteTable defined in RFC 2096 [RFC2096].
In addition, RFC 1354 introduced ipForwardNumber.
This object reflects the number of entries found in ipForwardTable.
It was obsoleted by ipCidrRouteNumber, defined in RFC 2096.
In RFC 2096, the ipCidrRouteTable and ipCidrRouteNumber were introduced.
The ipCidrRouteTable object supports multipath IP routes having the same network number but differing network masks.
The number of entries in that table is reflected in ipCidrRouteNumber.
These objects are deprecated by the definitions contained in this MIB definition.
RFC 2011 and 2465 RFC 2011
[RFC2011] contains the ipRoutingDiscards object, which counts the number of valid routes that have been removed from the ipCidrRouteTable object.
The corresponding ipv6DiscardedRoutes object is defined in RFC 2465
These objects are deprecated in favor of the version independent object inetCidrRouteDiscards defined in this MIB.

" DESCRIPTION "The MIB module for the management of CIDR multipath IP Routes.
This version of this MIB module is a part of RFC 4292; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
Minimal changes were made to the original RFC 2096 MIB to allow easy upgrade of existing IPv4 implementations to the version independent MIB.
These changes include: Adding inetCidrRouteDiscards as a replacement for the deprecated ipRoutingDiscards and ipv6DiscardedRoutes objects.
Adding a new conformance statement to support the implementation of the IP Forwarding MIB in a read only mode.
The inetCidrRouteTable replaces the IPv4 specific ipCidrRouteTable, its related objects, and related conformance statements.
"The number of valid route entries discarded from the inetCidrRouteTable.
Discarded route entries do not appear in the inetCidrRouteTable.
One possible reason for discarding an entry would be to free up buffer space for other route table entries."
The Inet CIDR Route Table deprecates and replaces the    ipCidrRoute Table currently in the IP Forwarding Table MIB.
It adds IP protocol independence.
SEQUENCE OF InetCidrRouteEntry MAX ACCESS
This entity's IP Routing table."
InetCidrRouteEntry MAX ACCESS not accessible
current DESCRIPTION "A particular route to a particular destination, under a particular policy (as reflected in the inetCidrRoutePolicy object).
Dynamically created rows will survive an agent reboot.
Implementers need to be aware that if the total number of elements (octets or sub identifiers) in inetCidrRouteDest, inetCidrRoutePolicy, and inetCidrRouteNextHop exceeds 111, then OIDs of column instances in this table will have more than 128 sub  identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
"The type of the inetCidrRouteDest address, as defined in the InetAddress MIB.
Only those address types that may appear in an actual routing table are allowed as values of this object.
InetAddress MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
"The destination IP address of this route.
The type of this address is determined by the value of the inetCidrRouteDestType object.
The values for the index objects inetCidrRouteDest
and inetCidrRoutePfxLen must be consistent.
When the value of inetCidrRouteDest (excluding the zone index, if one is present) is
x, then the bitwise logical AND of x with the value of the mask formed from the corresponding index object inetCidrRoutePfxLen MUST be equal to x.
If not, then the index pair is not consistent and an inconsistentName error must be returned on SET or CREATE requests."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
Indicates the number of leading one bits that form the mask to be logical ANDed with the destination address before being compared to the value in the inetCidrRouteDest field.
The values for the index objects inetCidrRouteDest
and inetCidrRoutePfxLen must be consistent.
When the value of inetCidrRouteDest (excluding the zone index, if one is present) is
x, then the bitwise logical AND of x with the value of the mask formed from the corresponding index object inetCidrRoutePfxLen MUST be equal to x.
If not, then the index pair is not consistent and an inconsistentName error must be returned on SET or CREATE requests."
"This object is an opaque object without any defined semantics.
Its purpose is to serve as an additional index that may delineate between multiple entries to the same destination.
The value { 0 0 } shall be used as the default value for this object."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
"The type of the inetCidrRouteNextHop address, as defined in the InetAddress MIB.
Value should be set to unknown(0) for non remote routes.
Only those address types that may appear in an actual routing table are allowed as values of this object.
InetAddress MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
On remote routes, the address of the next system en route.
For non remote routes, a zero length string.
The type of this address is determined by the value of the inetCidrRouteNextHopType object."
The ifIndex value that identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.
A value of 0 is valid and represents the scenario where no interface is specified."
Note that local(3) refers to a route for which the next hop is the final destination; remote(4) refers to a route for which the next hop is not the final destination.
Routes that do not result in traffic forwarding or rejection should not be displayed, even if the implementation keeps them stored internally.
reject(2) refers to a route that, if matched, discards the message as unreachable and returns a notification (e.g., ICMP error) to the message sender.
This is used in some protocols as a means of correctly aggregating routes.
blackhole(5) refers to a route that, if matched, discards the message silently."
"The routing mechanism via which this route was learned.
Inclusion of values for gateway routing protocols is not intended to imply that hosts should support those protocols."
"The number of seconds since this route was last updated or otherwise determined to be correct.
Note that no semantics of 'too old' can be implied, except through knowledge of the routing protocol by which the route was learned."
The Autonomous System Number of the Next Hop.
The semantics of this object are determined by the routing  protocol specified in the route's inetCidrRouteProto value.
When this object is unknown or not relevant, its value should be set to zero.

Note that local(3) refers to a route for which the next hop is the final destination; remote(4) refers to a route for which the next hop is not the final destination.
Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipForwardTable object.
That is, it effectively disassociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry.
It is an implementation specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use.
Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipForwardType object.

"The compliance statement for SNMP entities that implement the ipForward MIB."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 1.
The inetCidrRouteTable contains routing and forwarding information that is critical to the operation of the network node (especially routers).
Allowing unauthenticated write access to this table can compromise the validity of the forwarding information.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 1.
The inetCidrRouteTable contains routing and forwarding information that can be used to compromise a network.
Specifically, this table can be used to construct a map of the network in preparation for a denial of service attack on the network infrastructure.
The inetCidrRouteProto object identifies the routing protocols in use within a network.
This information can be used to determine how a denial of service attack should be launched.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
This document obsoletes RFC 2096 in the following ways: 1.
This applies to corresponding objects and conformance statements.
Utilizes the InetAddress TC to support IP version independent implementations of the forwarding MIB.
This gives common forwarding MIB support for IPv4 and IPv6.
Creates a read only conformance statement to support implementations that only wish to retrieve data.
Creates the inetCidrRouteDiscards object to replace the deprecated ipRoutingDiscards and ipv6DiscardedRoutes objects.
The inetCidrRouteTable retains the logical structure of the ipCidrRouteTable in order to allow the easy upgrade of existing IPv4 implementations to the version independent MIB.
