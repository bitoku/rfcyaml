  - "1.  Abstract\n   This document describes requirements for the provisioning of\
    \ \"roaming\n   capability\" for dialup Internet users.  \"Roaming capability\"\

    \  (ISPs), while maintaining a formal, customer-vendor relationship with\n   only\
    \ one.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   Operational roaming services are currently providing worldwide\n\
    \   roaming capabilities, and these services continue to grow in\n   popularity\
    \ [1].  Interested parties have included:\n      Regional Internet Service Providers\
    \ (ISPs) operating within a\n      particular state or province, looking to combine\
    \ their efforts\n      with those of other regional providers to offer services\
    \ over a\n      wider area.\n      National ISPs wishing to combine their operations\
    \ with those of\n      one or more ISPs in another nation to provide greater coverage\
    \ in\n      a group of countries or on a continent.\n      Businesses desiring\
    \ to offer their employees a comprehensive\n      package of dialup services on\
    \ a global basis.  Those services can\n      include Internet access as well as\
    \ secure access to corporate\n      intranets via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n\
    \   This document provides an architectural framework for the\n   provisioning\
    \ of roaming capabilities, as well as describing the\n   requirements that must\
    \ be met by elements of the architecture.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Requirements language
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Requirements language\n   In this document, the key words \"MAY\", \"MUST,\
    \ \"MUST NOT\", \"optional\",\n   \"recommended\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , are to be interpreted as\n   described in [4].\n   Please note that the requirements\
    \ specified in this document are to\n   be used in evaluating protocol submissions.\
    \  As such, the\n   requirements language refers to capabilities of these protocols;\
    \ the\n   protocol documents will specify whether these features are required,\n\
    \   recommended, or optional for use in roaming.  For example, requiring\n   that\
    \ a protocol support confidentiality is NOT the same thing as\n   requiring that\
    \ all protocol traffic be encrypted.\n   A protocol submission is not compliant\
    \ if it fails to satisfy one or\n   more of the must or must not requirements\
    \ for the capabilities that\n   it implements.  A protocol submission that satisfies\
    \ all the must,\n   must not, should and should not requirements for its capabilities\
    \ is\n   said to be \"unconditionally compliant\"; one that satisfies all the\n\
    \   must and must not requirements but not all the should or should not\n   requirements\
    \ for its protocols is said to be \"conditionally\n   compliant.\"\n"
- title: 2.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Terminology\n   This document frequently uses the following terms:\n  \
    \ phone book\n      This is a database or document containing data pertaining\
    \ to\n      dialup access, including phone numbers and any associated\n      attributes.\n\
    \   phone book server\n      This is a server that maintains the latest version\
    \ of the phone\n      book.  Clients communicate with phone book servers in order\
    \ to\n      keep their phone books up to date.\n   Network Access Server\n   \
    \   The Network Access Server (NAS) is the device that clients dial in\n     \
    \ order to get access to the network.\n   Authentication server\n      This is\
    \ a server which provides for authentication/authorization\n      within the roaming\
    \ architecture.\n   Accounting server\n      This is a server which provides for\
    \ accounting within the roaming\n      architecture.\n   Authentication proxy\n\
    \      Authentication proxies may be deployed within the roaming\n      architecture\
    \ for several purposes, including authentication\n      forwarding, policy implementation,\
    \ shared secret management, and\n      attribute editing.  To the NAS, the authentication\
    \ proxy appears\n      to act as an authentication server; to the authentication\
    \ server,\n      the proxy appears to act as an authentication client.\n   Accounting\
    \ proxy\n      Accounting proxies may be deployed within the roaming architecture\n\
    \      for several purposes, including accounting forwarding, reliability\n  \
    \    improvement, auditing, and \"pseudo-transactional\" capability.  To\n   \
    \   the NAS, the accounting proxy appears to act as an accounting\n      server;\
    \ to the accounting server, the proxy appears to act as an\n      accounting client.\n\
    \   Network Access Identifier\n      In order to provide for the routing of authentication\
    \ and\n      accounting packets, user name MAY contain structure.  This\n    \
    \  structure provides a means by which the authentication or\n      accounting\
    \ proxies will locate the authentication or accounting\n      server that is to\
    \ receive the request.\n"
- title: 3.  Architectural framework
  contents:
  - "3.  Architectural framework\n   The roaming architecture consists of three major\
    \ subsystems:\n      Phone book Subsystem\n      Authentication Subsystem\n  \
    \    Accounting Subsystem\n   The phone book subsystem is concerned with the maintenance\
    \ and\n   updating of the user phone book.  The phone book provides the user\n\
    \   with information on the location and phone numbers of Points of\n   Presence\
    \ (POPs) that are roaming enabled.  The function of the\n   authentication subsystem\
    \ is to provide authorized users with access\n   to the POPs in the phonebook,\
    \ and to deny access to unauthorized\n   users.  The goal of the accounting subsystem\
    \ is to provide\n   information on the resources utilized during the user's session.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Phone Book Subsystem
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Phone Book Subsystem\n   The phone book subsystem provides for the following:\n\
    \      Phone number presentation\n      Phone number exchange\n      Phone book\
    \ compilation\n      Phone book update\n   Phone number presentation\n      Phone\
    \ number presentation involves the display of available phone\n      numbers to\
    \ the user, and culminates in the choosing of a number.\n      Since the user\
    \ interface and sequence of events involved in phone\n      number presentation\
    \ is a function of the connection management\n      software being used, it is\
    \ likely that individual vendors will\n      take different approaches to the\
    \ problem.  These differences can\n      include variances in the format of the\
    \ client phone books, varying\n      approaches to presentation, etc.  There is\
    \ no inherent problem\n      with this. As a result, phone number presentation\
    \ need not be\n      standardized.\n   Phone number exchange\n      Phone number\
    \ exchange involves propagation of phone number changes\n      between providers\
    \ in a roaming association.  Current roaming\n      implementations do not provide\
    \ for complete automation of the\n      phone number exchange process [1].  As\
    \ a result, phone number\n      exchange need not be standardized at this time.\n\
    \   Phone book compilation\n      Once an ISP's phone book server has received\
    \ its updates it needs\n      to compile a new phone book and propagate this phone\
    \ book to all\n      the phone book servers operated by that ISP.  Given that\
    \ the\n      compilation process does not affect protocol interoperability, it\n\
    \      need not be standardized.\n   Phone book update\n      Once the phone book\
    \ is compiled, it needs to be propagated to\n      users.  Standardization of\
    \ the phone book update process allows\n      for providers to update user phone\
    \ books, independent of their\n      client software or operating system.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Authentication Subsystem
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Authentication Subsystem\n   The authentication subsystem provides for\
    \ the following:\n      Connection management\n      Authentication\n      NAS\
    \ Configuration/Authorization\n      Address Assignment/Routing\n      Security\n\
    \   Connection management\n      In order to be able to use the POPs of the local\
    \ provider, it is\n      first necessary to bring up a connection.\n   Identification\n\
    \      Authentication consists of two parts: the claim of identity (or\n     \
    \ identification) and the proof of the claim (or verification).  As\n      part\
    \ of the authentication process, users identify themselves to\n      the Network\
    \ Access Server (NAS) in a manner that allows the\n      authentication request\
    \ to be routed its home destination.\n   Authentication\n      Authentication\
    \ is typically required prior to allowing access to\n      the network.  CHAP\
    \ [8] and PAP [9] are the two authentication\n      protocols most commonly used\
    \ within the PPP [10] framework today.\n      Some groups of users are requiring\
    \ different forms of proof of\n      identity (e.g., token or smart cards, Kerberos\
    \ credentials, etc.)\n      for special purposes (such as acquiring access to\
    \ corporate\n      intranets).  The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [7]\
    \ was\n      created in order to provide a general mechanism for support of\n\
    \      these methods.\n   NAS configuration/authorization\n      In order to set\
    \ up the session, authorization parameters need to\n      be sent to from the\
    \ home authentication server to the local ISP's\n      NAS.\n   Address assignment/routing\n\
    \      If it is desired that the user be able to communicate with the\n      rest\
    \ of the Internet, then the session will be assigned a routable\n      IP address\
    \ by the NAS.\n   Security\n      In the process of authenticating and authorizing\
    \ the user session,\n      it may be desirable to provide protection against a\
    \ variety of\n      security threats.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Accounting Subsystem
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Accounting Subsystem\n   The function of the accounting subsystem is to\
    \ enable the\n   participants in the roaming consortium to keep track of what\n\
    \   resources are used during a session. Relevant information includes\n   how\
    \ long the user was connected to the service, connection speed,\n   port type,\

- title: 4.1.1.  Phone book update protocol
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Phone book update protocol\n   Portability\n   The update protocol MUST\
    \ allow for updating of clients on a range of\n   platforms and operating systems.\
    \ Therefore the update mechanism MUST\n   NOT impose any operating system-specific\
    \ requirements.\n   Authentication\n   The client MUST be able to determine the\
    \ authenticity of the server\n   sending the phone book update.  The server MAY\
    \ also be able to\n   authenticate the client.\n   Versioning\n   The update protocol\
    \ MUST provide for updating of the phone book from\n   an arbitrary previous version\
    \ to the latest available version.\n   Integrity Checking\n   The client MUST\
    \ be able to determine the integrity of the received\n   update before applying\
    \ it, and MUST be able to determine the\n   integrity of the newly produced phone\
    \ book after updating it.\n   Light weight transfers\n   Since the client may\
    \ be a low-end machine or internet appliance, the\n   update protocol MUST be\
    \ lightweight.\n   Language support\n   The phone book update mechanism MUST support\
    \ the ability to request\n   that the phone book be transmitted in a particular\
    \ language and\n   character set.  For example, if the customer has a Russian\
    \ language\n   software package, then the propagation and update protocols MUST\n\
    \   provide a mechanism for the user to request a Russian language phone\n   book.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Phone book format
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Phone book format\n   Phone number attributes\n   The phone book format\
    \ MUST support phone number attributes commonly\n   used by Internet service providers.\
    \  These attributes are required in\n   order to provide users with information\
    \ on the capabilities of the\n   available phone numbers.\n   Provider attributes\n\
    \   In addition to providing information relating to a given phone\n   number,\
    \ the phone book MUST provide information on the individual\n   roaming consortium\
    \ members.  These attributes are required in order\n   to provide users with information\
    \ about the individual providers in\n   the roaming consortium.\n   Service attributes\n\
    \   In addition to providing information relating to a given phone\n   number,\
    \ and service provider, the phone book MUST provide information\n   relevant to\
    \ configuration of the service.  These attributes are\n   necessary to provide\
    \ the client with information relating to the\n   operation of the service.\n\
    \   Extensibility\n   Since it will frequently be necessary to add phone book\
    \ attributes,\n   the phone book format MUST support the addition of phone number,\n\
    \   provider and service attributes without modification to the update\n   protocol.\
    \  Registration of new phone book attributes will be handled\n   by IANA.  The\
    \ attribute space MUST be sufficiently large to\n   accomodate growth.\n   Compactness\n\
    \   Since phone book will typically be frequently updated, the phone book\n  \
