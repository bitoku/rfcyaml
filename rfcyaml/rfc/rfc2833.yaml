  - "1 Introduction\n   This memo defines two payload formats, one for carrying dual-tone\n\
    \   multifrequency (DTMF) digits, other line and trunk signals (Section\n   3),\
    \ and a second one for general multi-frequency tones in RTP [1]\n   packets (Section\
    \ 4). Separate RTP payload formats are desirable since\n   low-rate voice codecs\
    \ cannot be guaranteed to reproduce these tone\n   signals accurately enough for\
    \ automatic recognition. Defining\n   separate payload formats also permits higher\
    \ redundancy while\n   maintaining a low bit rate.\n   The payload formats described\
    \ here may be useful in at least three\n   applications: DTMF handling for gateways\
    \ and end systems, as well as\n   \"RTP trunks\". In the first application, the\
    \ Internet telephony\n   gateway detects DTMF on the incoming circuits and sends\
    \ the RTP\n   payload described here instead of regular audio packets. The gateway\n\
    \   likely has the necessary digital signal processors and algorithms, as\n  \
    \ it often needs to detect DTMF, e.g., for two-stage dialing. Having\n   the gateway\
    \ detect tones relieves the receiving Internet end system\n   from having to do\
    \ this work and also avoids that low bit-rate codecs\n   like G.723.1 render DTMF\
    \ tones unintelligible. Secondly, an Internet\n   end system such as an \"Internet\
    \ phone\" can emulate DTMF functionality\n   without concerning itself with generating\
    \ precise tone pairs and\n   without imposing the burden of tone recognition on\
    \ the receiver.\n   In the \"RTP trunk\" application, RTP is used to replace a\
    \ normal\n   circuit-switched trunk between two nodes. This is particularly of\n\
    \   interest in a telephone network that is still mostly circuit-\n   switched.\
    \  In this case, each end of the RTP trunk encodes audio\n   channels into the\
    \ appropriate encoding, such as G.723.1 or G.729.\n   However, this encoding process\
    \ destroys in-band signaling information\n   which is carried using the least-significant\
    \ bit (\"robbed bit\n   signaling\") and may also interfere with in-band signaling\
    \ tones, such\n   as the MF digit tones. In addition, tone properties such as\
    \ the phase\n   reversals in the ANSam tone, will not survive speech coding. Thus,\n\
    \   the gateway needs to remove the in-band signaling information from\n   the\
    \ bit stream. It can now either carry it out-of-band in a signaling\n   transport\
    \ mechanism yet to be defined, or it can use the mechanism\n   described in this\
    \ memorandum. (If the two trunk end points are within\n   reach of the same media\
    \ gateway controller, the media gateway\n   controller can also handle the signaling.)\
    \  Carrying it in-band may\n   simplify the time synchronization between audio\
    \ packets and the tone\n   or signal information. This is particularly relevant\
    \ where duration\n   and timing matter, as in the carriage of DTMF signals.\n"

- title: 2 Events vs. Tones
  contents:
  - "2 Events vs. Tones\n   A gateway has two options for handling DTMF digits and\
    \ events. First,\n   it can simply measure the frequency components of the voice\
    \ band\n   signals and transmit this information to the RTP receiver (Section\n\
    \   4). In this mode, the gateway makes no attempt to discern the meaning\n  \
    \ of the tones, but simply distinguishes tones from speech signals.\n   All tone\
    \ signals in use in the PSTN and meant for human consumption\n   are sequences\
    \ of simple combinations of sine waves, either added or\n   modulated. (There\
    \ is at least one tone, the ANSam tone [3] used for\n   indicating data transmission\
    \ over voice lines, that makes use of\n   periodic phase reversals.)\n   As a\
    \ second option, a gateway can recognize the tones and translate\n   them into\
    \ a name, such as ringing or busy tone. The receiver then\n   produces a tone\
    \ signal or other indication appropriate to the signal.\n   Generally, since the\
    \ recognition of signals often depends on their\n   on/off pattern or the sequence\
    \ of several tones, this recognition can\n   take several seconds. On the other\
    \ hand, the gateway may have access\n   to the actual signaling information that\
    \ generates the tones and thus\n   can generate the RTP packet immediately, without\
    \ the detour through\n   acoustic signals.\n   In the phone network, tones are\
    \ generated at different places,\n   depending on the switching technology and\
    \ the nature of the tone.\n   This determines, for example, whether a person making\
    \ a call to a\n   foreign country hears her local tones she is familiar with or\
    \ the\n   tones as used in the country called.\n   For analog lines, dial tone\
    \ is always generated by the local switch.\n   ISDN terminals may generate dial\
    \ tone locally and then send a Q.931\n   SETUP message containing the dialed digits.\
    \ If the terminal just\n   sends a SETUP message without any Called Party digits,\
    \ then the\n   switch does digit collection, provided by the terminal as KEYPAD\n\
    \   messages, and provides dial tone over the B-channel. The terminal can\n  \
    \ either use the audio signal on the B-channel or can use the Q.931\n   messages\
    \ to trigger locally generated dial tone.\n   Ringing tone (also called ringback\
    \ tone) is generated by the local\n   switch at the callee, with a one-way voice\
    \ path opened up as soon as\n   the callee's phone rings. (This reduces the chance\
    \ of clipping the\n   called party's response just after answer. It also permits\
    \ pre-answer\n   announcements or in-band call-progress indications to reach the\n\
    \   caller before or in lieu of a ringing tone.) Congestion tone and\n   special\
    \ information tones can be generated by any of the switches\n   along the way,\
    \ and may be generated by the caller's switch based on\n   ISUP messages received.\
    \ Busy tone is generated by the caller's\n   switch, triggered by the appropriate\
    \ ISUP message, for analog\n   instruments, or the ISDN terminal.\n   Gateways\
    \ which send signaling events via RTP MAY send both named\n   signals (Section\
    \ 3) and the tone representation (Section 4) as a\n   single RTP session, using\
    \ the redundancy mechanism defined in Section\n   3.7 to interleave the two representations.\
    \ It is generally a good\n   idea to send both, since it allows the receiver to\
    \ choose the\n   appropriate rendering.\n   If a gateway cannot present a tone\
    \ representation, it SHOULD send the\n   audio tones as regular RTP audio packets\
    \ (e.g., as payload format\n   PCMU), in addition to the named signals.\n"

- title: 3.1 Introduction
  contents:
  - "3.1 Introduction\n   The payload format for named telephone events described\
    \ below is\n   suitable for both gateway and end-to-end scenarios. In the gateway\n\
    \   scenario, an Internet telephony gateway connecting a packet voice\n   network\
    \ to the PSTN recreates the DTMF tones or other telephony\n   events and injects\
    \ them into the PSTN. Since, for example, DTMF digit\n   recognition takes several\
    \ tens of milliseconds, the first few\n   milliseconds of a digit will arrive\
    \ as regular audio packets. Thus,\n   careful time and power (volume) alignment\
    \ between the audio samples\n   and the events is needed to avoid generating spurious\
    \ digits at the\n   receiver.\n   DTMF digits and named telephone events are carried\
    \ as part of the\n   audio stream, and MUST use the same sequence number and time-stamp\n\
    \   base as the regular audio channel to simplify the generation of audio\n  \
    \ waveforms at a gateway. The default clock frequency is 8,000 Hz, but\n   the\
    \ clock frequency can be redefined when assigning the dynamic\n   payload type.\n\
    \   The payload format described here achieves a higher redundancy even\n   in\
    \ the case of sustained packet loss than the method proposed for the\n   Voice\
    \ over Frame Relay Implementation Agreement [4].\n   If an end system is directly\
    \ connected to the Internet and does not\n   need to generate tone signals again,\
    \ time alignment and power levels\n   are not relevant. These systems rely on\
    \ PSTN gateways or Internet end\n   systems to generate DTMF events and do not\
    \ perform their own audio\n   waveform analysis. An example of such a system is\
    \ an Internet\n   interactive voice-response (IVR) system.\n   In circumstances\
    \ where exact timing alignment between the audio\n   stream and the DTMF digits\
    \ or other events is not important and data\n   is sent unicast, such as the IVR\
    \ example mentioned earlier, it may be\n   preferable to use a reliable control\
    \ protocol rather than RTP\n   packets. In those circumstances, this payload format\
    \ would not be\n   used.\n"
- title: 3.2 Simultaneous Generation of Audio and Events
  contents:
  - "3.2 Simultaneous Generation of Audio and Events\n   A source MAY send events\
    \ and coded audio packets for the same time\n   instants, using events as the\
    \ redundant encoding for the audio\n   stream, or it MAY block outgoing audio\
    \ while event tones are active\n   and only send named events as both the primary\
    \ and redundant\n   encodings.\n   Note that a period covered by an encoded tone\
    \ may overlap in time\n   with a period of audio encoded by other means. This\
    \ is likely to\n   occur at the onset of a tone and is necessary to avoid possible\n\
    \   errors in the interpretation of the reproduced tone at the remote\n   end.\
    \  Implementations supporting this payload format must be prepared\n   to handle\
    \ the overlap. It is RECOMMENDED that gateways only render\n   the encoded tone\
    \ since the audio may contain spurious tones\n   introduced by the audio compression\
    \ algorithm. However, it is\n   anticipated that these extra tones in general\
    \ should not interfere\n   with recognition at the far end.\n"
- title: 3.3 Event Types
  contents:
  - "3.3 Event Types\n   This payload format is used for five different types of signals:\n\
    \      o  DTMF tones (Section 3.10);\n      o  fax-related tones (Section 3.11);\n\
    \      o  standard subscriber line tones (Section 3.12);\n      o  country-specific\
    \ subscriber line tones (Section 3.13) and;\n      o  trunk events (Section 3.14).\n\
    \   A compliant implementation MUST support the events listed in Table 1\n   with\
    \ the exception of \"flash\". If it uses some other, out-of-band\n   mechanism\
    \ for signaling line conditions, it does not have to\n   implement the other events.\n\
    \   In some cases, an implementation may simply ignore certain events,\n   such\
    \ as fax tones, that do not make sense in a particular\n   environment.  Section\
    \ 3.9 specifies how an implementation can use the\n   SDP \"fmtp\" parameter within\
    \ an SDP description to indicate its\n   inability to understand a particular\
    \ event or range of events.\n   Depending on the available user interfaces, an\
    \ implementation MAY\n   render all tones in Table 5 the same or, preferably,\
    \ use the tones\n   conveyed by the concurrent \"tone\" payload or other RTP audio\
    \ payload.\n   Alternatively, it could provide a textual representation.\n   Note\
    \ that end systems that emulate telephones only need to support\n   the events\
    \ described in Sections 3.10 and 3.12, while systems that\n   receive trunk signaling\
    \ need to implement those in Sections 3.10,\n   3.11, 3.12 and 3.14, since MF\
    \ trunks also carry most of the \"line\"\n   signals. Systems that do not support\
    \ fax or modem functionality do\n   not need to render fax-related events described\
    \ in Section 3.11.\n   The RTP payload format is designated as \"telephone-event\"\
    , the MIME\n   type as \"audio/telephone-event\". The default timestamp rate is\
    \ 8000\n   Hz, but other rates may be defined. In accordance with current\n  \
    \ practice, this payload format does not have a static payload type\n   number,\
    \ but uses a RTP payload type number established dynamically\n   and out-of-band.\n"

    \ For DTMF digits and other events representable as tones,\n           this field\
    \ describes the power level of the tone, expressed\n           in dBm0 after dropping\
    \ the sign. Power levels range from 0 to\n           -63 dBm0. The range of valid\
    \ DTMF is from 0 to -36 dBm0 (must\n           accept); lower than -55 dBm0 must\
    \ be rejected (TR-TSY-000181,\n           ITU-T Q.24A). Thus, larger values denote\
    \ lower volume. This\n           value is defined only for DTMF digits. For other\
    \ events, it\n           is set to zero by the sender and is ignored by the receiver.\n\
    \      duration: Duration of this digit, in timestamp units. Thus, the\n     \
    \      event began at the instant identified by the RTP timestamp\n          \
    \ and has so far lasted as long as indicated by this parameter.\n           The\
    \ event may or may not have ended.\n           For a sampling rate of 8000 Hz,\
    \ this field is sufficient to\n           express event durations of up to approximately\
    \ 8 seconds.\n      E: If set to a value of one, the \"end\" bit indicates that\
    \ this\n           packet contains the end of the event. Thus, the duration\n\
    \           parameter above measures the complete duration of the event.\n   \
    \        A sender MAY delay setting the end bit until retransmitting\n       \
    \    the last packet for a tone, rather than on its first\n           transmission.\
    \ This avoids having to wait to detect whether\n           the tone has indeed\
    \ ended.\n           Receiver implementations MAY use different algorithms to\n\
    \           create tones, including the two described here. In the first,\n  \
    \         the receiver simply places a tone of the given duration in\n       \
    \    the audio playout buffer at the location indicated by the\n           timestamp.\
    \ As additional packets are received that extend the\n           same tone, the\
    \ waveform in the playout buffer is extended\n           accordingly. (Care has\
    \ to be taken if audio is mixed, i.e.,\n           summed, in the playout buffer\
    \ rather than simply copied.)\n           Thus, if a packet in a tone lasting\
    \ longer than the packet\n           interarrival time gets lost and the playout\
    \ delay is short, a\n           gap in the tone may occur.  Alternatively, the\
    \ receiver can\n           start a tone and play it until it receives a packet\
    \ with the\n           \"E\" bit set, the next tone, distinguished by a different\n\
    \           timestamp value or a given time period elapses. This is more\n   \
    \        robust against packet loss, but may extend the tone if all\n        \
    \   retransmissions of the last packet in an event are lost.\n           Limiting\
    \ the time period of extending the tone is necessary\n           to avoid that\
    \ a tone \"gets stuck\". Regardless of the\n           algorithm used, the tone\
    \ SHOULD NOT be extended by more than\n           three packet interarrival times.\
    \ A slight extension of tone\n           durations and shortening of pauses is\
    \ generally harmless.\n      R: This field is reserved for future use. The sender\
    \ MUST set it\n           to zero, the receiver MUST ignore it.\n"
- title: 3.6 Sending Event Packets
  contents:
  - "3.6 Sending Event Packets\n   An audio source SHOULD start transmitting event\
    \ packets as soon as it\n   recognizes an event and every 50 ms thereafter or\
    \ the packet interval\n   for the audio codec used for this session, if known.\
    \ (The sender does\n   not need to maintain precise time intervals between event\
    \ packets in\n   order to maintain precise inter-event times, since the timing\n\
    \   information is contained in the timestamp.)\n      Q.24 [5], Table A-1, indicates\
    \ that all administrations surveyed\n      use a minimum signal duration of 40\
    \ ms, with signaling velocity\n      (tone and pause) of no less than 93 ms.\n\

  - "3.11 Data Modem and Fax Events\n   Table 3.11 summarizes the events and tones\
    \ that can appear on a\n   subscriber line serving a fax machine or modem. The\
    \ tones are\n   described below, with additional detail in Table 7.\n      ANS:\
    \ This 2100 +/- 15 Hz tone is used to disable echo\n           suppression for\
    \ data transmission [8,9]. For fax machines,\n           Recommendation T.30 [9]\
    \ refers to this tone as called\n           terminal identification (CED) answer\
    \ tone.\n      /ANS: This is the same signal as ANS, except that it reverses\n\
    \           phase at an interval of 450 +/- 25 ms. It disables both\n        \
    \   echo cancellers and echo suppressors. (In the ITU\n           Recommendation\
    \ V.25 [8], this signal is rendered as ANS\n           with a bar on top.)\n \
    \     ANSam: The modified answer tone (ANSam) [3] is a sinewave signal\n     \
    \      at 2100 +/- 1 Hz without phase reversals, amplitude-modulated\n       \
    \    by a sinewave at 15 +/- 0.1 Hz. This tone is sent by modems\n           if\
    \ network echo canceller disabling is not required.\n      /ANSam: The modified\
    \ answer tone with phase reversals (ANSam) [3]\n           is a sinewave signal\
    \ at 2100 +/- 1 Hz with phase reversals at\n           intervals of 450 +/- 25\
    \ ms, amplitude-modulated by a sinewave\n           at 15 +/- 0.1 Hz. This tone\
    \ [10,8] is sent by modems [11] and\n           faxes to disable echo suppressors.\n\

  contents:
  - "4.1 Introduction\n   As an alternative to describing tones and events by name,\
    \ as\n   described in Section 3, it is sometimes preferable to describe them\n\
    \   by their waveform properties. In particular, recognition is faster\n   than\
    \ for naming signals since it does not depend on recognizing\n   durations or\
    \ pauses.\n   There is no single international standard for telephone tones such\
    \ as\n   dial tone, ringing (ringback), busy, congestion (\"fast-busy\"),\n  \
    \ special announcement tones or some of the other special tones, such\n   as payphone\
    \ recognition, call waiting or record tone. However, across\n   all countries,\
    \ these tones share a number of characteristics [17]:\n      o  Telephony tones\
    \ consist of either a single tone, the addition\n         of two or three tones\
    \ or the modulation of two tones. (Almost\n         all tones use two frequencies;\
    \ only the Hungarian \"special dial\n         tone\" has three.) Tones that are\
    \ mixed have the same amplitude\n         and do not decay.\n      o  Tones for\
    \ telephony events are in the range of 25 (ringing tone\n         in Angola) to\
    \ 1800 Hz. CED is the highest used tone at 2100 Hz.\n         The telephone frequency\
    \ range is limited to 3,400 Hz.  (The\n         piano has a range from 27.5 to\
    \ 4186 Hz.)\n      o  Modulation frequencies range between 15 (ANSam tone) to\
    \ 480 Hz\n         (Jamaica). Non-integer frequencies are used only for\n    \
    \     frequencies of 16 2/3 and 33 1/3 Hz. (These fractional\n         frequencies\
    \ appear to be derived from older AC power grid\n         frequencies.)\n    \
    \  o  Tones that are not continuous have durations of less than four\n       \
    \  seconds.\n      o  ITU Recommendation E.180 [18] notes that different telephone\n\
    \         companies require a tone accuracy of between 0.5 and 1.5%.  The\n  \
    \       Recommendation suggests a frequency tolerance of 1%.\n"

    \ field is a 9-bit\n           unsigned integer, allowing modulation frequencies\

    \ frequency is to be\n           divided by three. Otherwise, the modulation frequency\
    \ is\n           taken as is.\n           This bit allows frequencies accurate\
    \ to 1/3 Hz, since\n           modulation frequencies such as 16 2/3 Hz are in\
    \ practical\n           use.\n      volume: The power level of the tone, expressed\
    \ in dBm0 after\n           dropping the sign, with range from 0 to -63 dBm0.\
    \ (Note: A\n           preferred level range for digital tone generators is -8\
    \ dBm0\n           to -3 dBm0.)\n      duration: The duration of the tone, measured\
    \ in timestamp units.\n           The tone begins at the instant identified by\
    \ the RTP\n           timestamp and lasts for the duration value.\n          \

  - "5 Combining Tones and Named Events\n   The payload formats in Sections 3 and\
    \ 4 can be combined into a single\n   payload using the method specified in RFC\
    \ 2198. Fig. 4 shows an\n   example. In that example, the RTP packet combines\
    \ two \"tone\" and one\n   \"telephone-event\" payloads.  The payload types are\
    \ chosen arbitrarily\n   as 97 and 98, respectively, with a sample rate of 8000\
    \ Hz. Here, the\n   redundancy format has the dynamic payload type 96.\n   The\
    \ packet represents a snapshot of U.S. ringing tone, 1.5 seconds\n   (12,000 timestamp\
    \ units) into the second \"on\" part of the 2.0/4.0\n   second cadence, i.e.,\
    \ a total of 7.5 seconds (60,000 timestamp units)\n   into the ring cycle. The\
    \ 440 + 480 Hz tone of this second cadence\n   started at RTP timestamp 48,000.\
    \ Four seconds of silence preceded it,\n   but since RFC 2198 only has a fourteen-bit\
    \ offset, only 2.05 seconds\n   (16383 timestamp units) can be represented. Even\
    \ though the tone\n   sequence is not complete, the sender was able to determine\
    \ that this\n   is indeed ringback, and thus includes the corresponding named\
    \ event.\n"

  - "7 Security Considerations\n   RTP packets using the payload format defined in\
    \ this specification\n   are subject to the security considerations discussed\
    \ in the RTP\n   specification (RFC 1889 [1]), and any appropriate RTP profile\
    \ (for\n   example RFC 1890 [19]).This implies that confidentiality of the media\n\
    \   streams is achieved by encryption. Because the data compression used\n   with\
    \ this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be\n   performed after\
    \ compression so there is no conflict between the two\n   operations.\n   This\
    \ payload type does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity in\n   the receiver\
    \ side computational complexity for packet processing to\n   cause a potential\
    \ denial-of-service threat.\n   In older networks employing in-band signaling\
    \ and lacking appropriate\n   tone filters, the tones in Section 3.14 may be used\
    \ to commit toll\n   fraud.\n   Additional security considerations are described\
