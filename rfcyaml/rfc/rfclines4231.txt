Abstract This document provides test vectors for the HMAC SHA 224, HMAC SHA 256, HMAC SHA 384, and HMAC SHA 512 message authentication schemes.
It also provides ASN.1 object identifiers and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to identify use of these schemes in protocols.
The test vectors provided in this document may be used for conformance testing.
This document provides test vectors for the HMAC SHA 224, HMAC SHA 256, HMAC SHA 384, and HMAC SHA 512 message authentication schemes.
It also provides ASN.1 object identifiers and URIs to identify use of these schemes in protocols using ASN.1 constructs (such as those built on Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) [4]) or protocols based on XML constructs (such as those leveraging XML Digital Signatures [5]).
HMAC SHA 224 is the realization of the HMAC message authentication code
[1] using the SHA 224 hash function, HMAC SHA 256 is the realization of the HMAC message authentication code using the SHA 256 hash function, HMAC SHA 384 is the realization of the HMAC message authentication code using the SHA 384 hash function, and HMAC SHA 512 is the realization of the HMAC message authentication code using the SHA 512 hash function.
SHA 224, SHA 256, SHA 384, and SHA 512 are all described in [2].
Conventions Used in This Document
The key word "SHOULD" in this document is to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].
When the "algorithm" component in a value of ASN.1 type AlgorithmIdentifier (see, e.g., [4], Section 10) identifies one of these schemes, the "parameter" component SHOULD be present but have type NULL.
The following URIs have been allocated for these schemes:
http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/pkcs/schemas/pkcs 5#hmac sha 224 http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/pkcs/schemas/pkcs 5#hmac sha 256 http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/pkcs/schemas/pkcs 5#hmac sha 384 http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/pkcs/schemas/pkcs
As usual, when used in the context of [5], the <ds:
HMACOutputLength> element may specify the truncated length of the scheme output.
The test vectors in this document have been cross verified by three independent implementations.
An implementation that concurs with the results provided in this document should be interoperable with other similar implementations.
Keys, data, and digests are provided in hex.

This document is intended to provide the identifications and test vectors for the four identified message authentication code schemes to the Internet community.
No assertion of the security of these message authentication code schemes for any particular use is intended.
The reader is referred to [1] for a discussion of the general security of the HMAC construction.
