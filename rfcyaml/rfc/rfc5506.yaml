  - "1.  Introduction\n   In RTP [RFC3550] it is currently mandatory to send RTP Control\n
    \  Protocol (RTCP) packets as compound packets containing at least a\n   sender
    report (SR) or receiver report (RR), followed by a source\n   description (SDES)
    packet containing at least the CNAME item.  There\n   are good reasons for this,
    as discussed below (see Section 3.1);\n   however, it does result in the minimal
    RTCP packets being quite\n   large.\n   The RTP/AVPF profile [RFC4585] specifies
    new RTCP packet types for\n   feedback messages.  Some of these feedback messages
    would benefit\n   from being transmitted with minimal delay.  AVPF provides some\n
    \  mechanisms to support this; however, for environments with low-\n   bitrate
    links, these messages can still consume a large amount of\n   resources and can
    introduce extra delay in the time it takes to\n   completely send the compound
    packet in the network.  It is therefore\n   desirable to send just the feedback,
    without the other parts of a\n   compound RTCP packet.  This memo proposes such
    a mechanism for this\n   and other use cases, as discussed in Section 3.2.\n   There
    are a number of benefits with Reduced-Size RTCP; these are\n   discussed in Section
    3.3.\n   The use of Reduced-Size RTCP is not without issues.  This is\n   discussed
    in Section 3.4.  These issues need to be considered and are\n   part of the motivation
    for this document.\n   Finally, this document defines how AVPF is updated to allow
    for the\n   transmission of Reduced-Size RTCP in a way that would not\n   substantially
    affect the mechanisms that compound packets provide;\n   see Section 4 for more
    details.  The connection to AVPF (or SAVPF\n   [RFC5124]) is motivated by the
    fact that Reduced-Size RTCP is mainly\n   beneficial for event-driven feedback
    purposes and that the AVPF Early\n   RTCP and Immediate Feedback modes make this
    possible.\n   This document updates [RFC3550], [RFC3711], and [RFC4585].\n"

    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n   The
    naming convention for RTCP is often confusing.  Below is a list\n   of RTCP terms
    and what they mean.  See also Section 6.1 in [RFC3550]\n   and Section 3.1 in
    [RFC4585] for details.\n   RTCP packet:  Can be of different types, contains a
    fixed header part\n      followed by structured elements depending on RTCP packet
    type.\n   Lower layer datagram:  Can be interpreted as the UDP payload.  It may\n
    \     however, depending on the transport, be a TCP or Datagram\n      Congestion
    Control Protocol (DCCP) payload or something else.\n      Synonymous to the \"underlying
    protocol\" defined in Section 3 in\n      [RFC3550].\n   Compound RTCP packet:
    \ A collection of two or more RTCP packets.  A\n      compound RTCP packet is
    transmitted in a lower-layer datagram.  It\n      must contain at least an RTCP
    RR or SR packet and an SDES packet\n      with the CNAME item.  Often \"compound\"
    is left out, the\n      interpretation of RTCP packet is therefore dependent on
    the\n      context.\n   Minimal compound RTCP packet:  A compound RTCP packet
    that contains\n      the RTCP RR or SR packet and the SDES packet with the CNAME
    item\n      with a specified ordering.\n   (Full) compound RTCP packet:  A compound
    RTCP packet that conforms to\n      the requirements on minimal compound RTCP
    packets and contains\n      more RTCP packets.\n   Reduced-Size RTCP packet:  May
    contain one or more RTCP packets but\n      does not follow the compound RTCP
    rules defined in Section 6.1 in\n      [RFC3550] and is thus neither a minimal
    nor a full compound RTCP.\n      See Section 4.1 for a full definition.\n"

    - "3.1.  RTCP Compound Packets (Background)\n   Section 6.1 in [RFC3550] specifies
      that an RTCP packet must be sent\n   as a compound RTCP packet consisting of
      at least two individual RTCP\n   packets, first a sender report (SR) or receiver
      report (RR), followed\n   by additional packets including a mandatory SDES packet
      containing a\n   CNAME item for the transmitting source identifier.  Below is
      a short\n   description of what these RTCP packet types are used for.\n   1.
      \ The sender and receiver reports (see Section 6.4 of [RFC3550])\n       provide
      the RTP session participant with the synchronization\n       source (SSRC) identifier
      of all RTP session participants.  Having\n       all participants send these
      packets periodically allows everyone\n       to determine the current number
      of participants.  This\n       information is used in the transmission scheduling
      algorithm.\n       Thus, this is particularly important for new participants
      so that\n       they can quickly establish a good estimate of the group size.\n
      \      Failure to do this would result in RTCP senders consuming too\n       much
      bandwidth.\n   2.  Before a new session participant has sent any RTP or RTCP
      packet,\n       it can also avoid SSRC collisions with all the SSRCs it sees\n
      \      prior to that transmission.  So the possibility to see a\n       substantial
      proportion of the participating sources minimizes the\n       risk of any collision
      when selecting SSRC.\n   3.  The sender and receiver reports contain some basic
      statistics\n       usable for monitoring of the transport and thus enable\n
      \      adaptation.  These reports become more useful if sent regularly,\n       as
      the receiver of a report can perform analyses to find trends\n       between
      the individual reports.  When used for media transmission\n       adaptation,
      the information becomes more useful the more\n       frequently it is received,
      at least until one report per round-\n       trip time (RTT) is achieved.  Therefore,
      there is, in most cases,\n       no reason not to include the sender or receiver
      report in all\n       RTCP packets.\n   4.  The CNAME SDES item (see Section
      6.5.1 of [RFC3550]) exists to\n       allow receivers to determine which media
      flows should be\n       synchronized with each other, both within an RTP session
      and\n       between different RTP sessions carrying different media types.\n
      \      Thus, it is important to quickly receive this for each media\n       sender
      in the session when joining an RTP session.\n   5.  Sender reports (SR) are
      used in combination with the above SDES\n       CNAME mechanism to synchronize
      multiple RTP streams, such as\n       audio and video.  After having determined
      which media streams\n       should be synchronized using the CNAME field, the
      receiver uses\n       the sender report's NTP and RTP timestamp fields to establish\n
      \      synchronization.\n   6.  The CNAME SDES item also allows a session participant
      to detect\n       SSRC collisions and separate them from routing loops.  The
      32-\n       bit, randomly selected SSRC has some probability of collision.\n
      \      The CNAME is used as the longer canonical identifier of a\n       particular
      endpoint instance that is bound to an SSRC.  If that\n       binding isn't received
      and kept current, the receiver may not\n       detect an SSRC collision, i.e.,
      two different CNAMEs using the\n       same SSRC.  It also can't detect an RTP-level
      routing loop, with\n       the result that the same SSRC and CNAME arrive from
      multiple\n       lower-layer source addresses.\n   Reviewing the above, it is
      obvious that both SR/RR and the CNAME are\n   very important in order for new
      session participants to be able to\n   utilize any received media and to avoid
      flooding the network with\n   RTCP reports.  In addition, the dynamic nature
      of the information\n   provided would make it less useful if not sent regularly.\n
      \  The following sections will describe the cases when Reduced-Size RTCP\n   is
      beneficial and will also show the possible issues that must be\n   considered.\n"
    title: 3.1.  RTCP Compound Packets (Background)
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Use Cases for Reduced-Size RTCP\n   Below are listed a few use cases
      for Reduced-Size RTCP.\n   Control Plane Signaling:  The Open Mobile Alliance
      (OMA) Push-to-talk\n      over Cellular (PoC) [OMA-PoC] makes use of Reduced-Size
      RTCP when\n      transmitting certain events.  The OMA PoC service is primarily\n
      \     used over cellular links capable of IP transport, such as the\n      Global
      System for Mobile Connections (GSM) General Packet Radio\n      Service (GPRS).\n
      \  Codec Control Signaling:  An example that can be used with Reduced-\n      Size
      RTCP is, e.g., Temporary Maximum Media Stream Bitrate Request\n      (TMMBR)
      messages as specified in [RFC5104], which signal a request\n      for a change
      in codec bitrate.  These messages benefit from the\n      usage of Reduced-Size
      RTCP in bad channel conditions, as Reduced-\n      Size RTCP are much more likely
      to be successfully transmitted than\n      larger compound RTCP.  This is critical,
      as these messages are\n      likely to occur when channel conditions are poor.
      \ Other examples\n      of codec control usage for Reduced-Size RTCP are found
      in\n      [MTSI-3GPP].\n   Feedback:  An example of a feedback scenario that
      would benefit from\n      Reduced-Size RTCP is Video streams with generic NACK.
      \ In cases\n      where the RTT is shorter than the receiver buffer depth, generic\n
      \     NACK can be used to request retransmission of missing packets,\n      thus
      improving playout quality considerably.  If the generic NACK\n      packets
      are transmitted as Reduced-Size RTCP, the bandwidth\n      requirement for RTCP
      will be minimal, enabling more frequent\n      feedback.  As in the codec control
      case, it is important that\n      these packets can be transmitted with as little
      delay as possible.\n      Another interesting use for Reduced-Size RTCP is in
      cases when\n      regular feedback is needed, as described in Section 3.3.\n
      \  Status Reports:  One proposed idea is to transmit small measurement\n      or
      status reports in Reduced-Size RTCP, and to split the minimal\n      compound
      RTCP and transmit the individual RTCP separately.  The\n      status reports
      can be used either by the endpoints or by other\n      network monitoring boxes
      in the network.  The benefit is that,\n      with some radio access technologies,
      small packets are more robust\n      to poor radio conditions than large packets.
      \ Additionally, with\n      small (report) packets, there is a smaller risk
      that the report\n      packets will affect the channel upon which they report.
      \ Another\n      benefit is that it is possible, with Reduced-Size RTCP, to
      allow,\n      for example, anonymous status reporting to be transmitted\n      unencrypted.
      \ This is something that may be beneficial, for\n      instance, for network
      monitoring purposes.\n"
    title: 3.2.  Use Cases for Reduced-Size RTCP
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Benefits of Reduced-Size RTCP\n   As mentioned in the introduction, most
      advantages of using Reduced-\n   Size RTCP packets exist in cases when the available
      RTCP bitrate is\n   limited.  This is because they can become substantially
      smaller than\n   compound packets.  A compound packet is forced to contain both
      an RR\n   or an SR and the CNAME SDES item.  The RR containing a report block\n
      \  for a single source is 32 bytes, an SR is 52 bytes.  Both may be\n   larger
      if they contain report blocks for multiple sources.  The SDES\n   packet containing
      a CNAME item will be 10 bytes plus the CNAME string\n   length.  Here, it is
      reasonable that the CNAME string is at least 10\n   bytes to get a decent collision
      resistance.  If the recommended form\n   of user@host is used, then most strings
      will be longer than 20\n   characters.  Thus, a Reduced-Size RTCP can become
      at least 70-80\n   bytes smaller than the compound packet.\n   For low bitrate
      links, the benefits of this reduction in size are as\n   follows:\n   o  For
      links where the packet-loss rate grows with the packet size,\n      smaller
      packets are less likely to be dropped.  Radio links are an\n      example of
      such links.  In the cellular world, there exist links\n      that are optimized
      to handle RTP packets sized for carrying\n      compressed speech.  This increases
      the capacity and coverage for\n      voice services in a given wireless network.
      \ Minimal compound RTCP\n      packets are commonly 2-3 times the size of an
      RTP packet carrying\n      compressed speech.  If the speech packet over such
      a bearer has a\n      packet-loss probability of p, then the RTCP packet will
      experience\n      a loss probability of 1-(1-p)^x, where x is the number of\n
      \     fragments the compound packet will be split into on the link\n      layer,
      i.e., commonly into 2 or 3 fragments.\n   o  There is a shorter serialization
      time, i.e., the time it takes the\n      link to transmit the packet.  For slower
      links, this time can be\n      substantial.  For example, transmitting 120 bytes
      over a link\n      interface capable of 30 kbps takes 32 milliseconds (ms),
      assuming\n      uniform transmission rate.\n   In cases when Reduced-Size RTCP
      carries important and time-sensitive\n   feedback, both shorter serialization
      time and the lower loss\n   probability are important to enable the best possible
      functionality.\n   Having a packet-loss rate that is much higher for the feedback\n
      \  packets than the media packets hurts when trying to perform media\n   adaptation
      to, for example, handle the changed performance present at\n   the cell border
      in a cellular system.\n   For high-bitrate applications, there is usually no
      problem to supply\n   RTCP with sufficient bitrates.  When using AVPF, one can
      use the\n   \"trr-int\" parameter to restrict the regular reporting interval
      to\n   approximately once per RTT or less often.  As in most cases, there is\n
      \  little reason to provide regular reports of higher density than this;\n   any
      additional bandwidth can then be used for feedback messages.  The\n   benefit
      of Reduced-Size RTCP in this case is limited, but exists.\n   One typical example
      is video using generic NACK in cases where the\n   RTT is low.  Using Reduced-Size
      RTCP would reduce the total amount of\n   bits used for RTCP.  This is primarily
      applicable if the number of\n   reports is large.  This would also result in
      lower processing delay\n   and less complexity for the feedback packets, as
      they do not need to\n   query the RTCP database to construct the right messages.\n
      \  As message size is generally a smaller issue at higher bitrates, it\n   is
      also possible to transmit multiple RTCP in each lower-layer\n   datagram in
      these cases.  The motivation behind Reduced-Size RTCP in\n   this case is not
      size, rather it is to avoid the extra overhead\n   caused by inclusion of the
      SR/RR and SDES CNAME items in each\n   transmitted RTCP.\n   Independently of
      the link type, there are additional benefits with\n   sending feedback in small
      Reduced-Size RTCP.  Applications that use\n   RTCP AVPF in Early RTCP or Immediate
      Feedback mode need to send\n   frequent event-driven feedback.  Under these
      circumstances, the risk\n   is reduced that the RTCP bandwidth becomes too high
      during periods of\n   heavy feedback signaling.\n   In cases when regular feedback
      is needed, such as the profile under\n   development for TCP friendly rate control
      (TFRC) for RTP\n   [TCP-FRIEND], the size of compound RTCPs can result in very
      high\n   bandwidth requirements if the round-trip time is short.  For this\n
      \  particular application, Reduced-Size RTCP gives a very substantial\n   improvement.\n"

      - "3.4.2.  Packet Validation\n   A Reduced-Size RTCP packet will be discarded
        by the packet validation\n   code in Appendix A of [RFC3550].  This has several
        impacts:\n   Weakened Packet Validation:  The packet validation code needs
        to be\n      rewritten to accept Reduced-Size RTCP.  In particular, this\n
        \     affects Section 9.1 in [RFC3550] in the sense that the header\n      verification
        must take into account that the payload type numbers\n      for the (first)
        RTCP in the lower-layer datagram may differ from\n      200 or 201 (SR or
        RR).  One potential effect of this change is\n      much weaker validation
        that received packets actually are RTCP and\n      not packets of some other
        type being wrongly delivered.  Thus,\n      some consideration should be given
        to ensure the best possible\n      validation is available, for example, restricting
        Reduced-Size\n      RTCP to contain only some specific RTCP packet types that
        are\n      preferably signalled on a per-session basis.  However, the\n      application
        of a security mechanism for source authentication on\n      the packets will
        provide much stronger protection.\n   Old RTP Receivers:  Any RTCP receiver
        without an updated packet\n      validation code will discard the Reduced-Size
        RTCP, which means\n      that the receiver will not see e.g., the contained
        feedback\n      messages.  The effect of this depends on the type of feedback\n
        \     message and the role of the receiver.  For example, this may cause\n
        \     complete function loss in the case of attempting to send a\n      Reduced-Size
        NACK message (see Section 6.2.1 of [RFC4585]) to a\n      non-updated media
        sender in a session using the retransmission\n      scheme defined by [RFC4588].
        \ This type of discarding would also\n      affect the feedback suppression
        defined in AVPF.  The result would\n      be a partitioning of the receivers
        within the session, with the\n      old receivers only seeing the compound
        RTCP feedback messages and\n      the newer ones seeing both.  In this case,
        the old receivers may\n      send feedback messages for events already reported
        on in Reduced-\n      Size RTCP.\n   Bandwidth Considerations:  The discarding
        of Reduced-Size RTCP would\n      affect the RTCP transmission calculation
        in that the avg_rtcp_size\n      value would become larger than for RTP receivers
        that exclude the\n      Reduced-Size RTCP in this calculation (assuming that
        Reduced-Size\n      RTCP are smaller than compound ones).  Therefore, these
        senders\n      would under-utilize the available bitrate and send with a longer\n
        \     interval than updated receivers.  For most sessions, this should\n      not
        be an issue.  However, for sessions with a large portion of\n      Reduced-Size
        RTCP, the updated receivers may time out non-updated\n      senders prematurely.
        \ This is, however, not likely to occur, as\n      the time between compound
        RTCP transmissions needs to become 5\n      times that used by the Reduced-Size
        RTCP senders for it to happen.\n   Computation of avg_rtcp_size:  Long intervals
        between compound RTCP\n      with many Reduced-Size RTCP in between may lead
        to a computation\n      of a value for avg_rtcp_size that varies greatly over
        time.\n      Investigation shows that although it varies, this is not enough
        of\n      a problem to warrant further changes or complexities to the RTCP\n
        \     scheduling algorithm.\n"

        \  Upon examination of how SRTP processes packets, it becomes obvious\n   that
        SRTP has no real dependency on whether the first packet is an SR\n   or an
        RR packet.  What is needed is the common RTCP packet header,\n   which is

  - "4.  Use of Reduced-Size RTCP with AVPF\n   Based on the above analysis, it seems
    feasible to allow transmission\n   of Reduced-Size RTCP under some restrictions:\n
    \  o  First of all, it is important that compound RTCPs are transmitted\n      at
    regular intervals to ensure that the mechanisms maintained by\n      the compound
    packets, like feedback reporting, work.  The tracking\n      of session size and
    number of participants warrants mentioning\n      again, as this ensures that
    the RTCP bandwidth remains bounded\n      independent of the number of session
    participants.\n   o  Second, as the compound RTCP packets are also used to establish\n
    \     and maintain synchronization between media, any newly joining\n      participant
    in a session would need to receive compound RTCP from\n      the media sender(s).\n
    \  This implies that the regular transmission of compound RTCP MUST be\n   maintained
    throughout an RTP session.  Reduced-Size RTCP SHOULD be\n   restricted to be used
    as extra RTCP (e.g., feedback), sent in cases\n   when a regular compound RTCP
    packet would not otherwise have been\n   sent.\n   The usage of Reduced-Size RTCP
    SHALL only be done in RTP sessions\n   operating in AVPF [RFC4585] or SAVPF [RFC5124]
    Early RTCP or\n   Immediate Feedback mode.  Reduced-Size RTCP SHALL NOT be sent
    until\n   at least one compound RTCP has been sent.  In Immediate Feedback\n   mode,
    all feedback messages MAY be sent as Reduced-Size RTCP.  In\n   Early RTCP mode,
    a feedback message scheduled for transmission as an\n   Early RTCP, i.e., not
    a Regular RTCP, MAY be sent as Reduced-Size\n   RTCP.  All RTCP that are scheduled
    for transmission as Regular RTCP\n   SHALL be sent as compound RTCP as indicated
    by AVPF [RFC4585].\n"

        RTCP, it is important to\n   verify that the Reduced-Size RTCP packets actually
        reach the session\n   participants.  As outlined above in Section 3.4.1 and
        Section 3.4.2,\n   packets may be discarded along the path or in the endpoint.\n
        \  A few verification rules are RECOMMENDED to ensure robust RTCP\n   transmission
        and reception and to solve the identified issues when\n   Reduced-Size RTCP
        is used:\n   o  The endpoint issue can be solved by introducing signaling
        that\n      informs if all session participants are capable of Reduced-Size\n
        \     RTCP.  See Section 5.\n   o  The middle box issue is more difficult,
        and here one will be\n      required to use heuristics to determine whether
        or not the\n      Reduced-Size RTCP packets are delivered.  The method used
        to\n      detect successful delivery of Reduced-Size RTCP packets depends
        on\n      the packet type.  The RTCP packet types for which successful\n      delivery
        can be detected are:\n      *  Sender reports (SR): Successful transmission
        of a sender report\n         can be verified by inspection of the echoed timestamp
        in the\n         received receiver report (RR).  This can also be used as
        a\n         method to verify if Reduced-Size RTCP can be used at all.\n      *
        \ Feedback RTCP packets: In many cases, the feedback messages\n         sent
        using Reduced-Size RTCP will result in either explicit or\n         implicit
        indications that they have been received.  An example\n         of this is
        the RTP retransmission [RFC4588] that results from a\n         NACK message
        [RFC4585].  Another example is the Temporary\n         Maximum Media Stream
        Bitrate Notification (TMMBN) message\n         resulting from a Temporary
        Maximum Media Stream Bitrate Request\n         (TMMBR) [RFC5104].  A third
        example is the presence of a\n         decoder refresh point [RFC5104] in
        the video media stream\n         resulting from the Full Intra Request that
        was sent.\n      RTCP packet types for which it is not possible to detect\n
        \     successful delivery SHOULD NOT be transmitted as Reduced-Size RTCP\n
        \     packets unless they are transmitted in the same lower-layer\n      datagram
        as another RTCP packet type for which successful delivery\n      can be detected.\n
        \  o  An algorithm to detect consistent failure of delivery of Reduced-\n
        \     Size RTCP MUST be used by any application using Reduced-Size RTCP.\n
        \     The details of this algorithm are application dependent and\n      therefore
        outside the scope of this document.\n   If the verification fails, it is strongly
        RECOMMENDED that only\n   compound RTCP, according to the rules outlined in
