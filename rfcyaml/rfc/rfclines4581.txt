Abstract This document defines a Type Length Value format for Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) Extensions.
This document updates RFC 3972.
The Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) specification [1] defines Extension Fields that allow additional information to be included in the CGA Parameter Data Structure.
So far there seems to be enough interest in including additional data items into the CGA Parameter Data Structure through these Extension Fields that it seems reasonable to expect that more than one mechanism will require its usage.
In order to simplify the addition of multiple data items, this document updates RFC 3972 [1], and it defines a Type Length  Value format for the Extension Fields.
CGA Extension Field Format Data items to be included in Extension Fields of the CGA Parameter Data Structure MUST be encoded using the following Type Length Value (TLV) format:
Extension Type: 16 bit identifier of the type of the Extension Field.
Extension Data Length: 16 bit unsigned integer.
Length of the Extension Data field of this option, in octets.
Extension Data: Variable length field.
The IANA has created and will maintain a registry entitled, "CGA Extension Type".
The values in this name space are 16 bit unsigned integers.
Initial values for the CGA Extension Type field are given below; future assignments are to be made through Standards Action [2].
Assignments consist of a name and the value.
As recommended in [3], this document makes the following assignments for experimental and testing use: the value 0xFFFD, with name Exp FFFD; the value 0xFFFE, with name Exp FFFE, and the value 0xFFFF, with name Exp FFFF.
No security concerns are raised by the adoption of the CGA Extension format described in this document.
However, proper security analysis is required when new CGA Extensions are defined in order to make sure that they introduce no new vulnerabilities to the existing CGA schemes.
