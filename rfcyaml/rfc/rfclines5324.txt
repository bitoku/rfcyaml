The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base, or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and
Overview of Fibre Channel 3.1.
Introduction Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point to point serial data channel, structured for high performance.
Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
command sets, the High  Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.
Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple communication points, called N Ports, interconnected either by a switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point to point link.
A Fibre Channel "Node" consists of one or more N Ports.
A Fabric may consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are Switches.
An N Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a Switch called an F Port.
When multiple FC Nodes are connected to a single port on a Switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the Switch port is called an FL Port, and the Nodes' ports are called NL Ports.
Nx Port is used to refer to either an N Port or an NL Port.
Fx Port is used to refer to either an F Port or an FL Port.
A Switch port, which is interconnected to another Switch port via an Inter Switch Link (ISL), is called an E Port.
A B Port connects a bridge device with an E Port on a Switch; a B Port provides a subset of E Port functionality.
Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each Node, and most ports, have globally unique names.
These globally unique names are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).
More information on WWNs can be found in [FC FS 2].
WWNs are expected to be persistent across agent and unit resets.
Fibre Channel frames contain 24 bit address identifiers that identify the frame's source and destination ports.
Each FC port has both an address identifier and a WWN.
When a Fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a Switch.
Each octet of a 24 bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy, with a Domain ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.
Zoning Zones within a Fabric provide a mechanism to control frame delivery between Nx Ports ("Hard Zoning") or to expose selected views of Name Server information ("Soft Zoning").
Communication is only possible when the communicating endpoints are members of a common zone.
This technique is similar to virtual private networks in that the Fabric has the ability to group devices into Zones.
Hard zoning and soft zoning are two different means of realizing this.
Hard zoning is enforced in the Fabric (i.e., Switches), whereas soft zoning is enforced at the endpoints (e.g., Host Bus Adapters) by relying on the endpoints to not send traffic to an N Port ID not obtained from the Name Server with a few exceptions for well known Addresses (e.g., the Name Server).
Administrators create Zones to increase network security, and prevent data loss or corruption, by controlling access between devices or user groups.
The standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple Fabric Switch elements is [FC SW 4].
[FC SW 4] carries forward the earlier specification for the operation of a single Fabric in a physical infrastructure, and augments it with the definition of Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how multiple Virtual Fabrics can operate within one or more physical infrastructures.
The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in its header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that frame is being transmitted on.
All frames entering a particular "Core Switch" [FC SW 4] (i.e., a physical Switch) on the same Virtual Fabric are processed by the same "Virtual Switch" within that Core Switch.
The Fibre Channel Security Protocols (FC SP) standard [FC SP] describes the protocols used to implement security in a Fibre Channel Fabric, including the definition of: protocols to authenticate Fibre Channel entities, protocols to set up session keys, protocols to negotiate the parameters required to ensure frame  by frame integrity and confidentiality, and protocols to establish and distribute (security) policies across a Fibre Channel Fabric.
Two entities may negotiate whether authentication is required and which Authentication Protocol is to be used.
Authentication can be used in Switch to Switch, Node to Switch, and Node to Node communication.
The defined Authentication Protocols are able to perform mutual authentication with optional shared key establishment.
The shared key computed at the end of an Authentication Transaction may be used to establish Security Associations.
The Fabric security architecture is defined for several authentication infrastructures.
Secret based, certificate based, and password based authentication infrastructures are accommodated.
Specific authentication protocols that directly leverage these three authentication infrastructures are defined.
With a secret based infrastructure, entities within the Fabric environment that establish a security relationship share a common secret or centralize the secret administration in an external (e.g., RADIUS [RFC2865], Diameter [RFC3588], or Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS) [RFC1492]) server.
Entities may mutually authenticate with other entities by using the Diffie Hellman Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (DH CHAP) [FC SP].
Security Associations may be set up using the session key computed at the end of the DH CHAP transaction.
With a certificate based infrastructure, entities within the Fabric environment are certified by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
The resulting certificates bind each entity to a public private key pair that may be used to mutually authenticate with other certified entities via the Fibre Channel Certificate Authentication Protocol (FCAP) [FC SP].
Security Associations may be set up by using these entity certificates and associated keys or by using the session key computed at the end of the FCAP transaction.
With a password based infrastructure, entities within the Fabric environment that establish a security relationship have knowledge of the password based credential material of other entities.
Entities may use this credential material to mutually authenticate with other entities using the Fibre Channel Password Authentication Protocol (FCPAP)
Security Associations may be set up using the session key computed at the end of the FCPAP transaction.
In addition to DH CHAP, FCAP, and FCPAP, one other Authentication Protocol is defined: Internet Key Exchange Protocol version
2 AUTH (IKEv2 AUTH), which refers to the use of an SA Management Transaction of the Security Association Management Protocol (see below) to perform two functions: not only SA management but also authentication.
The credentials used in an IKEv2 AUTH transaction are either strong shared secrets or certificates.
A subset of the IKEv2 protocol [RFC4306] suitable for Fibre Channel is defined as the (Fibre Channel) Security Association Management protocol [RFC4595].
This protocol   which is  not  IPsec   provides the means to establish Security Associations (SAs) between Fibre Channel entities.
Traffic Selectors are defined to specify which type of traffic has to be protected by which SA, and what the characteristics of the protection are.
Two mechanisms are available to protect specific classes of traffic: ESP Header is used to protect FC 2 frames (see [FC FS 2] and the conceptually similar mechanisms in [RFC4303]), and CT Authentication is used to protect CT IUs (Common Transport Information Units)
An entity protecting specific classes of traffic maintains an internal Security Association Database (SADB) that contains the currently active Security Associations and Traffic Selectors.
Each active SA has a Security Association entry in the SADB.
Each SA entry includes the SA's SPI (the Security Parameters Index, which is included in frames transmitted on the SA), a Sequence Number counter, and the parameters for the selected transforms (e.g., encryption algorithm, integrity algorithm, mode of operation of the algorithms, keys).
Each active Traffic Selector has an entry in the SADB that indicates whether it is used for ingress traffic or for egress traffic.
These Traffic Selector entries are ordered such that they are searched (when checking for a match) in the given order.
Two types of Traffic Selector entries may be present:
Traffic Selector entries identifying FC 2 frames or CT IUs to be bypassed or discarded; and Traffic Selector entries identifying FC 2 frames or CT IUs to be protected or verified.
These entries point to the corresponding SA entry defining the parameters and the security processing to be performed.
SAs are unidirectional, but they always exist as an SA pair of the same type, one in each direction.
Two separate approaches to defining Policies are adopted in FC SP, but both approaches follow the same general concept for their Policy model.
One is the definition of a Policy Model for Fabric Policies that focus on Security.
These Security Policies specify the membership and connectivity allowed within a Fabric, and also which IP hosts are allowed to manage a Fabric.
The other approach is to define a variant of the Enhanced Zoning model defined in [FC SW 4] and
[FC GS 5], such that the variant specifies extensions for use in a secure environment.
This variant of Zoning, denoted as "FC SP Zoning", follows the same general concepts of the Policy model for Security Policies, but keeps Zoning management and enforcement completely independent from the management and enforcement of other policies.
Note that the arrows in the picture above are used to indicate the movement of "data", rather than the direction of "messages", e.g., for a "Get" (with no data) in one direction which invokes a "Response" (typically with data) in the reverse direction, the diagram has arrows only for the "with data" direction.
The Policies to be enforced by a Fabric are specified in a set of Policy Objects.
The various types of Policy Objects are: The Policy Summary Object is a list of pointers to other Policy Objects, one pointer per each other active Policy Object.
Each pointer in a Policy Summary Object is paired with a cryptographic hash of the referenced Policy Object.
The Switch Membership List Object is a Fabric wide Policy Object that defines which Switches are allowed to be part of a Fabric.
The Node Membership List Object is a Fabric wide Policy Object that defines which Nodes are allowed to be connected to a Fabric.
The IP Management List Object is a Fabric wide Policy Object that describes which IP hosts are allowed to manage a Fabric.
A Switch Connectivity Object is a per Switch Policy Object that describes the topology restrictions for a specific Switch; it specifies the other Switches or Nodes to which the particular Switch may be connected at the Node level and/or at the Port level.
Attribute Objects are Fabric wide Policy Objects that define optional attributes to be associated with Switches or Nodes.
They allow the extension of this policy model by defining new attributes as required.
Note that the administratively specified name for a Fabric is contained in the Switch Membership List Object (not in the Policy Summary Object).
When FC SP is in use, each Fabric has a set of active Policy Objects: one Policy Summary Object, one Switch Membership List Object, one Node Membership List Object, one IP Management List Object, zero or more Switch Connectivity Objects, and zero or more Attribute Objects.
The active Policy Objects specify the Policies currently being enforced.
In addition, policies not currently being enforced are contained in non active Policy Objects.
To change the active Policy Objects, the non active Policy Objects are edited as necessary and a new Policy Summary Object that includes/references the changed Policy Objects is activated.
Every Policy Object has a name.
In a Fabric's database of Policy Objects, a Policy Object Name is specified as a type/length/value (see section 7.2 of [FC SP]).
Address Range IPv4 Address Range 3.4.6.
Three Kinds of Switches For a Fabric composed of n Switches and m Nodes
, the potential complexity of Switch Connectivity Objects is O(n  2) to describe Switch to Switch connections, and O(n m) for Switch to Node connections.
To provide better scaling, the Switch Connectivity Objects are not Fabric wide information, but are distributed only to where they are needed.
To support this, the policy model supports three kinds of Switches in a Fabric:
Server Switches, which maintain the Fabric wide Policy Objects, all the Switch Connectivity Objects, and a full copy of the FC  SP Zoning Database; Autonomous Switches, which maintain the Fabric wide Policy Objects, their own Switch Connectivity Object, and a full copy of the FC SP Zoning Database; and Client Switches, which maintain the Fabric wide Policy Objects, their own Switch Connectivity Object, and a subset of the FC SP Active Zone Set (which is the configurations of zones currently being enforced by a Fabric, see section 10.4.3.3 of [FC SW 4]).
Security Policy Management Security Policy can be changed in a server session [FC GS 5] with a Security Policy Server.
All write access to a Security Policy Server
occurs within a server session.
While read access to a Security Policy Server may occur at any time, the consistency of the returned data is guaranteed only inside a server session.
The Enhanced Commit Service [FC SW 4] is used to perform Fabric operations as and when necessary (see table 144 of [FC SP]).
Many of these operations are named as if they were acronyms, e.g., SSB for Server Session Begin; SSE for Server Session End; SW ILS for Switch Fabric Internal Link Services; EACA for Enhanced Acquire Change Authorization; ERCA for Enhanced Release Change Authorization; SFC for Stage Fabric Configuration.
Each server session begins and ends, with a SSB request and a SSE request respectively, sent to a Security Policy Server.
In the Fabric, the SSB requests a lock of the Fabric via an EACA SW ILS, while the SSE requests a release of the lock via the ERCA SW ILS [FC SW 4].
Active and non active Policy Objects are persistent in that they survive after the end of a server session.
To preserve backward compatibility with existing Zoning definitions and implementations, FC SP Zoning is defined as a variant of the Enhanced Zoning model defined in [FC SW 4] and [FC GS 5] that follows the general concepts of the Policy model for Security Policy Management, but keeps Zoning management and enforcement completely independent.
FC SP Zoning allows for some Switches to retain less than a complete replicated copy of the Zoning Database, as follows:
Server Switches maintain the policies data structures for all Switches in the Fabric plus a replica of the Zoning data structures; Autonomous Switches maintain only the subset of policies data structures relevant for their operations plus a replica of the Zoning Database; and Client Switches maintain only the subset of policies data structures and the subset of the Active Zone Set relevant for their operations.
When Client Switches are deployed in a Fabric, at least one Server Switch must also be deployed in the same Fabric.
A client server protocol allows Client Switches to dynamically retrieve the Zoning information they may require from the Server Switches.
A management application manages the Fabric Zoning configuration through the Fabric Zone Server, while other policies are managed through the Security Policy Server.
A new Zoning Check Protocol replaces the Zone Merge Protocol [FC SW 4], and new command codes are defined for the SFC SW ILS to distribute the FC SP Zoning configuration on a Fabric.
The Zoning definitions are ordered to allow for the computation of a hash of the Active Zone Set and a hash of the Zone Set Database, plus other optional security data (e.g., for integrity protection of Zoning information).
This document defines five MIB modules that together provide the means for monitoring the operation of, and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of the FC SP protocols.
Fibre Channel Management Instance A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [RFC4044] as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.
Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for the implementation(s).
For example, one such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX
[RFC2741] sub agents, with each sub agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.
The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel management instance, for example, within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411] section 3.3.1).
A central capability of FC SP is the use of an Authentication Protocol.
The purpose of each of the possible Authentication Protocols is to allow a Fibre Channel entity to be assured of the identity of each entity with which it is communicating.
Examples of such entities are Fibre Channel Switches and Fibre Channel Nx Ports.
Each entity is identified by a name.
The FC MGMT MIB [RFC4044] defines MIB objects for such names: for entities that are Fibre Channel Switches, the definition of a Fibre Channel management instance
allows multiple Switches to be managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.
In this case, each entity is a Switch and has the name given by the MIB object, fcmSwitchWWN.
for entities other than Fibre Channel Switches, a Fibre Channel management instance can manage only one entity, and the name of the entity is given by the MIB object, fcmInstanceWwn.
Fabric Index With multiple Fabrics, each Fabric has its own instances of the Fabric related management instrumentation.
Thus, these MIB modules define all Fabric related information in tables that are INDEX ed by an arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index".
The syntax of a Fabric Index is T11FabricIndex, imported from T11 TC MIB [RFC4439].
When a device is connected to a single physical Fabric, without use of any virtual Fabrics, the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.
In an environment of multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics, this index provides a means to distinguish one Fabric from another.
Interface Index Several of the MIB modules defined in this document use the InterfaceIndexOrZero syntax in order to allow information to be specified/instantiated on a per port/interface basis, e.g., for: statistics, Traffic Selectors, Security Associations, etc.
This allows the same object to be used either when there is a separate row for each of multiple ports/interfaces, or when multiple interfaces are represented by a single row.
The use of a zero value supports the simpler cases of: a) when there is only one port/interface, b) where the implementation chooses to aggregate the information for multiple ports/interfaces.
The minimum (for compliance) requirement is to implement any one of the above cases.
When a Fabric Index and an object with the InterfaceIndexOrZero syntax are used together in a single INDEX clause, the InterfaceIndexOrZero object is listed before the Fabric Index in order to simplify management queries that retrieve information concerning multiple Fabrics connected to the same port/interface.
Syntax for Policy Object Names T11FcSpPolicyNameType and T11FcSpPolicyName are two Textual Conventions defined in this document (in the T11 FC SP TC MIB module) to represent the types and values of Policy Object Names (see section 3.4.5.1 above).
However, two of the nine possible types are IPv4 Address Range and IPv6 Address Range.
It is standard practice in MIB modules to represent all IP addresses using the standard Textual Conventions defined in [RFC4001] for IP addresses: specifically, InetAddressType and InetAddress.
This document adheres to such standard practice to the following extent: for MIB objects representing a Policy Object Name that can  only  be an IPv4 Address Range or an IPv6 Address Range, then those MIB objects are defined as a 3 tuple: (InetAddressType, InetAddress, InetAddress), in which the first address is the low end of the range, the second address is the high end of the range, and both addresses are of the type given by InetAddressType. for MIB objects representing a Policy Object Name that is (possibly) of a different type, i.e., it is not (necessarily)
an IPv4 or IPv6 Address Range, then those MIB objects are defined as a 2 tuple: (T11FcSpPolicyNameType, T11FcSpPolicyName), in which the first object represents the type of Policy Object Name and the second object represents the value of the Policy Object Name.
For MIB objects defined in this manner, if and when they represent a range of IP addresses: a) the value of T11FcSpPolicyNameType differentiates between an IPv4 Address Range and an IPv6 Address Range; and b) the value of T11FcSpPolicyName is one string containing the concatenation of the two addresses that are the low and high addresses of the range.
This is the same format as used within FC SP Policy Objects [FC SP].
In order to authenticate with the FCAP protocol, each entity, identified by a unique Name, is provided with: a digital certificate associated with that Name, the private/public key pair that corresponds to the certificate, and with the Root Certificate (the certificate of the signing Certification Authority).
To authenticate another entity, an entity is required to be provided with the certificate of the associated Certification Authority.
FCAP requires entities to support at least four Root Certificates against which received corresponding certificates can be validated.
Support for certificate chains and verification of certificate chains containing more than one certificate is optional.
Entities need to be able to access a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) for each configured Root Certificate, if one is available from the CA.
Certificates on the CRL are considered invalid.
The management of certificates, Certification Authorities, and Certificate Revocation Lists is the same in Fibre Channel networks as it is in other networks.
Therefore, this document does not define any MIB objects for such management.
When Traffic Selectors are compared against an ingress or egress frame in order to determine the security processing to be applied to that frame, there are circumstances in which multiple Traffic Selectors, specifying different actions, can match with the frame.
Specifically, when matching against an egress frame to decide which active Security Association to transmit on, or, against an ingress frame unprotected by FC SP, i.e., without an SPI value in it, to decide which action ('drop' or 'bypass') to apply.
For these cases, the MIB includes a unique precedence value for each Traffic Selector such that the one with the numerically lowest precedence value is determined to be the one that matches.
In contrast, ingress frames on active Security Associations (i.e., protected by FC SP) are compared against the set of traffic selectors negotiated when the Security Association was set up and identified by the SPI value contained in the frame; the action taken depends on whether any Traffic Selector matches, but not on which one.
This difference between ingress and egress Traffic Selectors on active Security Associations is reflected in having separate MIB tables defined for them: the table for Traffic Selectors on egress SAs, t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable, has a precedence value in its INDEX clause; whereas the table for Traffic Selectors on ingress SAs, t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable, has an arbitrary integer value in its INDEX clause.
For 'drop' and 'bypass' Traffic Selectors, one table, t11FcSpSaTSelDrByTable, having a precedence value in its INDEX clause, is sufficient for both ingress and egress traffic.
The T11 FC SP TC MIB Module
This MIB module defines Textual Conventions that are being, or have the potential to be, used in more than one MIB module.
The module also defines Object Identifiers to identify the Cryptographic Algorithms listed in [FC SP] so that they can be used as the value of various MIB objects that specify the algorithms being/to be used by an FC SP implementation.
The T11 FC SP AUTHENTICATION MIB Module
This MIB module specifies the management information required to manage FC SP Authentication Protocols.
It defines three tables: t11FcSpAuEntityTable   a table of Fibre Channel entities that can be authenticated using FC SP's Authentication Protocols, including the names, capabilities, and basic configuration parameters of the entities.
this table has two purposes: to be a list of the mappings of a FC SP Authentication entity onto an interface and to contain Authentication Protocol per interface statistics.
a table of FC SP Authentication Protocol transactions that were recently rejected.
It also defines two notifications: one for sending a reject in response to an AUTH message and another for receiving a reject in response to an AUTH message.
The T11 FC SP ZONING MIB Module
This MIB module specifies the extensions to the T11 FC ZONE SERVER
MIB module [RFC4936] for the management of FC SP Zoning Servers.
Specifically, it augments three tables defined in T11 FC ZONE SERVER
MIB: t11FcSpZsServerTable   to this table
, it adds FC SP Zoning information defined for Zone Servers.
, it adds FC SP Zoning statistics for Zone Servers.
t11ZsNotifyControlTable    to this table, it adds control information for FC SP Zoning notifications.
It also defines two FC SP Zoning notifications: one for success and one for failure in the joining of two Fabrics.
The T11 FC SP POLICY MIB Module
This MIB module specifies management information that is used to manage FC SP policies.
The MIB module has five parts: Active Policy Objects read only MIB objects representing the set of active Policy Objects for each Fabric; Activate/Deactivate Operations read write MIB objects for invoking operations, either 1) to activate policies that are specified as a set of non active Policy Objects, or 2) to deactivate the currently active policies; also included are objects giving the status of invoked operations; Non Active Policy Objects read create MIB objects to create and modify non active Policy Objects; Statistics for FC SP Security Policy Servers; The definition and control of notifications for the success or failure of the activation or deactivation of FC SP policies.
The T11 FC SP SA MIB Module
This MIB module specifies the management information required to manage Security Associations established via FC SP.
All of the tables in this MIB module are INDEX ed by t11FcSpSaIfIndex, with syntax InterfaceIndexOrZero, which is either non zero for a specific interface or zero for all (of the management instance's) interfaces to the particular Fabric.
The MIB module consists of six parts: a per Fabric table, t11FcSpSaIfTable, of capabilities, parameters, status information, and counters; the counters include non transient aggregates of per SA transient counters; three tables, t11FcSpSaPropTable, t11FcSpSaTSelPropTable, and t11FcSpSaTransTable, specifying the proposals for an FC SP entity acting as an SA Initiator to present to the SA Responder during the negotiation of Security Associations.
The same information is also used by an FC SP entity acting as an SA Responder to decide what to accept during the negotiation of Security Associations.
One of these tables, t11FcSpSaTransTable, is used not only for information about security transforms to propose and to accept, but also as agreed upon during the negotiation of Security Associations; a table, t11FcSpSaTSelDrByTable, of Traffic Selectors having the security action of 'drop' or 'bypass' to be applied either to ingress traffic, which is unprotected by FC SP, or to all egress traffic; four tables, t11FcSpSaPairTable, t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable, t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable, and t11FcSpSaTSelSpiTable, containing information about active bidirectional pairs of Security Associations; in particular, t11FcSpSaPairTable has one row per active bidirectional SA pair, t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable and t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable contain information on the Traffic Selectors negotiated on the SAs, and the t11FcSpSaTSelSpiTable is an alternate lookup table such that the Traffic Selector(s)
in use on a particular Security Association can be quickly determined based on its (ingress) SPI value; a table, t11FcSpSaControlTable, of control and other information concerning the generation of notifications for events related to FC SP Security Associations; one notification, t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure, generated on the occurrence of an Authentication failure for a received FC 2 or CT IU frame.
All but one of the notifications defined in the five MIB modules in this document are notifications that are generated based on events occurring in the "control plane", e.g., notifications that are generated at the frequency of operator initiated activities.
The one exception is t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure, which is generated based on an event occurring in the "data plane", and could (in a worst case scenario) occur for every received ingress frame.
Therefore, a method of rate controlling the generation of notifications is needed for t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure, but not for any of the other notifications.
For t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure, rate control is achieved by specifying that a) after the first occurrence of an Authentication failure on any particular Security Association, the SNMP notifications for second and subsequent failures are suppressed for the duration of a time window and b) that even the notification for the first occurrence is suppressed after it is sent in the same time window for a configured (in t11FcSpSaControlMaxNotifs) number of Security Associations within a Fabric.
Note that while these suppressions prevent the network from being flooded with notifications, the Authentication Failures themselves must still be detected and counted.
The length of the time window is given by t11FcSpSaControlWindow, a read write object in the t11FcSpSaControlTable.
If and when the time since the last generation of the notification is less than the value of sysUpTime (e.g., if one or more notifications have occurred since the last re initialization of the management system), then t11FcSpSaControlElapsed and t11FcSpSaControlSuppressed contain the elapsed time since the last notification and the number of notifications suppressed in the window after sending the last one, respectively.
Otherwise, t11FcSpSaControlElapsed contains the value of sysUpTime and t11FcSpSaControlSuppressed has the value zero.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
The first standardized MIB module for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focused on Fibre Channel Switches.
the more generic Fibre Channel Management MIB [RFC4044], which defines basic information for Fibre Channel Nodes and Switches, including extensions to the standard IF MIB [RFC2863] for Fibre Channel interfaces.
Several other MIB modules have since been defined to extend
[RFC4044] for various specific Fibre Channel functionality, (
e.g., [RFC4438], [RFC4439], [RFC4625], [RFC4626], [RFC4747], [RFC4936], [RFC4935], and [RFC4983]).
The MIB modules defined in this memo further extend [RFC4044] to cover the operation of Fibre Channel Security Protocols, as specified in [FC SP].
One part of the FC SP specification is "FC SP Zoning", which is an extension/variant of the Fibre Channel Zoning defined in [FC GS 5].
Management information for the latter is defined in the T11 FC ZONE  SERVER
Consequently, the T11 FC SP ZONING MIB module defined in this document defines the extensions to the T11 FC  ZONE SERVER MIB module that are needed to manage FC SP Zoning.
The MIB modules in this memo import some common Textual Conventions from T11 TC MIB, defined in [RFC4439], and from INET ADDRESS MIB, defined in [RFC4001].
If the RADIUS protocol is used for access to an external server, information about RADIUS Servers is likely to be available from the RADIUS AUTH CLIENT MIB [RFC4668].

This MIB module defines Textual Conventions for use in the multiple MIB modules, which together define the instrumentation for an implementation of the Fibre Channel Security Protocols (FC SP) specification.
This MIB module also defines Object Identities (for use as possible values of MIB objects with syntax AutonomousType), including OIDs for the Cryptographic Algorithms defined in FC SP.

"200808200000Z" DESCRIPTION "Initial version of this MIB module, published as RFC 5324."
Identifies a cryptographic hash function used to create a hash value that summarizes an FC SP Policy Object.
Each definition of an object with this TC as its syntax must be accompanied by a corresponding definition of an object with T11FcSpPolicyHashValue as its syntax, and containing the hash value.
The first two cryptographic hash functions are:

"Represents the value of the cryptographic hash function of an FC SP Policy Object.
Each definition of an object with this TC as its syntax must be accompanied by a corresponding definition of an object with T11FcSpPolicyHashFormat as its syntax.
The corresponding object identifies the cryptographic hash function used to create the hash value."
REFERENCE "  ANSI INCITS 426 2007,
T11/Project 1570 D, Fibre Channel Security Protocols (FC SP), February 2007, section 7.1.3.1 and table 106.
When some kind of 'database' is defined in a set of read write MIB objects, it is common that multiple changes in the data need to be made at the same time.
So, if hash values are maintained for that data, those hash values are only correct if and when they are re calculated after every change.
In such circumstances, the use of an object with this syntax allows the re calculation of the hash values to be deferred until all changes have been made, and therefore the calculation need only be done once after all changes, rather than repeatedly/after each individual change.
The definition of an object defined using this TC is required to specify which one or more instances of which MIB objects contain the hash values operated upon (or whose status is given) by the value of this TC.
When read, the value of an object with this syntax is either: correct

This MIB module specifies the management information required to manage Fabric Policies as defined by Fibre Channel's FC SP specification.
FC SP uses the term 'Policy Objects', sometimes abbreviated to just 'Objects', to refer to containers used to hold the data by which Fabric Policies are specified/stored.
This obviously has the potential to cause confusion between 'Policy Objects' and 'MIB objects'.
The DESCRIPTIONs in this MIB module attempt to avoid such confusion by the use of different adjectives and capitalization, even though such mechanisms are less effective when used in descriptors.
Some types of Policy Objects contain multiple items of information, each of which are held in the same format within the Policy Object.
In such cases, FC SP uses the term 'Entry' to describe each instance of the common format.
For example, FC SP defines an Attribute Policy Object as containing one or more 'Attribute Entries'.
Again, this MIB module attempts to avoid confusion by the use of adjectives and capitalization to distinguish an Entry within a Policy Object from an entry within a MIB table.
A Fabric's database of Policy Objects consists of a set of active Objects that are to be enforced by that Fabric, as well as non active Objects that are not enforced.
Operations defined (in FC SP) for
Policy Management are: Add/Get/Remove operations on individual non active Policy Objects
, Activate/Deactivate operations on a Policy Summary Object, and Get operations on the active Policy Summary Object and/or on individual active Policy Objects.
This MIB module has five parts: 1)
Active Policy Objects read only MIB objects representing the set of active Policy Objects for each Fabric, 2) Activate/Deactivate Operations a read write MIB object to invoke an Activate operation of the policies specified via a non active Policy Summary Object, and a read write
MIB object to invoke a Deactivate operation.
Non active Policy Objects read create MIB objects to allow the creation of non active Policy Summary Objects (which reference non active Policy Objects), and read create MIB objects representing non active Policy Objects.

"200808200000Z" DESCRIPTION "Initial version of this MIB module, published as RFC 5324."
A table containing top level information about active FC SP policies on various Fabrics."
"Each entry contains information about active FC SP policies for a particular Fabric, managed as part of the Fibre Channel management instance identified by fcmInstanceIndex.
The name of this Fabric's (active) Policy Summary Object.
"The administratively specified name for this Fabric, as specified in the active Switch Membership List Object.
This value is meaningful only when Static Domain IDs are in use in a Fabric (see FC SW 4).
Static Domain IDs are administratively enabled by a setting of the Switch Flags in each Switch Entry in the Switch Membership List Object.
If Static Domain IDs are not in use, this value might be '0000000000000000'h.
The t11FamEnable, t11FamFabricName, and t11FamConfigDomainIdType objects defined in the T11 FC FABRIC ADDR MGR MIB module are also concerned with the use of an administratively specified name for a Fabric and Static Domain IDs.
When FC SP Policy is in use in a Fabric, the values of t11FamEnable, t11FamFabricName, and t11FamConfigDomainIdType must be read only and reflect the active Policy Objects.
For example, the value of t11FamFabricName must reflect the value of t11FcSpPoAdminFabricName." REFERENCE "  ANSI INCITS 426 2007, T11/Project 1570 D, Fibre Channel Security Protocols (FC SP), February 2007, section 7.1.4.1 and table 108.

How many Policy Objects of a given type can be active at any one time for a given Fabric depends on the type, as specified in FC SP.
For some types, it is one per Fabric; for other types, more than one can be active per Fabric.

The membership is restricted or unrestricted based on the name type.
Restricted membership means that the Switch is not allowed to be part of the Fabric unless allowed by a specific Switch Connectivity Object.
Unrestricted membership means that the Switch is allowed to be part of the Fabric unless disallowed by a specific Switch Connectivity Object.
The values of 'wildcard' and 'restrictedWildcard' provide the means to specify whether to allow/deny membership for Switches not explicitly named in the Switch Membership List Object.

A table of IP Management Entries in active IP Management List Objects.
An IP Management List Object is a Fabric wide Policy Object that describes which IP hosts are allowed to manage a Fabric.
One IP Management List Object is represented by all of the rows of this table that have the same values of fcmInstanceIndex and t11FcSpPoFabricIndex.
"Each entry contains information about one IP Management Entry within the active IP Management List Object for the Fabric identified by t11FcSpPoFabricIndex and managed within the Fibre Channel management instance identified by fcmInstanceIndex.
The Policy Object Name of an IP Management Entry Policy Object is either an IPv6 Address Range or an IPv4 Address Range, where in each case, the range is specified as two addresses: the low and high ends of the range.
In particular, since the Policy Object Name in this situation can only be an IPv6 Address Range or an IPv4 Address Range, it is represented here by three MIB objects defined as a (InetAddressType, InetAddress, InetAddress) tuple, in which the first address is the low end of the range
, the second address is the high end of the range, and both addresses are of the type designated by InetAddressType.
In theory, the use of t11FcSpPoIpMgmtEntryNameLow and t11FcSpPoIpMgmtEntryNameHigh (which both have the syntax of InetAddress) in the INDEX could cause the need for excessively long OIDs.
In practice, this can't happen because FC SP doesn't allow these objects to be specified as DNS names.
InetAddressType   INTEGER { ipv4(1), ipv6(2) } MAX ACCESS
The combination of t11FcSpPoIpMgmtNameType, t11FcSpPoIpMgmtNameLow, and t11FcSpPoIpMgmtNameHigh specify the Internet address range of this IP Management Entry in the IP Management List Object.
The FC SP specification does not allow the use of a DNS domain name to specify the address at the lower end or at the higher end of the Internet address range, nor does it allow the specification of a zone index.
Therefore, the type of address must be one of: 'ipv4', or 'ipv6'.
The lower end of an Internet address range.
The type of this address is given by the corresponding instance of t11FcSpPoIpMgmtEntryNameType.
The higher end of an Internet address range.

"Each row contains information specific to an Attribute Entry contained within an Attribute Policy Object that is active within the Fabric identified by t11FcSpPoFabricIndex and managed within the Fibre Channel management instance identified by fcmInstanceIndex.

Non Active Policy Summary Objects Available for Activation
A table of non active Policy Summary Objects available to be activated.
The functionality of this table deviates slightly from FC SP in that FC SP specifies that the only Policy Summary Object is the Active one, i.e., FC SP does not store non active Policy Summary Objects in the Policy Database.
Instead, FC SP requires a new Policy Summary Object to be created for, and embedded within, every Activate (APS) request.
Thus, the newly created Policy Summary Object outlasts the APS request only as the new active Policy Summary Object and only if the APS succeeds.
In contrast, the Activate operation provided by this MIB module consists of two steps: 1) create a non active Policy Summary Object as a set of entries in this table describing a new configuration; 2) activate a Policy Summary Object (stored as a set of entries in this table) using t11FcSpPoOperActivate.
These two steps are only loosely connected, i.e., the result of the first operation is a non active Policy Summary Object that is retained (in this table) even if it isn't immediately activated.
Even after an attempt to activate it succeeds or fails, a non active Policy Summary Object is not deleted, but is retained and still available for subsequent modification/re use."
"Each entry contains information about one non active Policy Object within a non active Policy Summary Object defined for potential use on the Fabric identified by t11FcSpPoFabricIndex, and managed within the Fibre Channel management instance identified by fcmInstanceIndex.
A non active Policy Summary Object is described by a set of entries in this table that have the same value of t11FcSpPoNaSummaryName.
As and when a Policy Summary Object is activated using the t11FcSpPoOperActivate object, if the activation is successful, existing rows (if any) in MIB tables for active Policy Objects are deleted and replaced by the appropriate new set of rows.
Existing rows in this table and/or in other tables for non active Policy Objects are not affected by the activate operation.

In a Fabric's database of Policy Objects, every Policy Object Name, including these Internet address ranges, is represented as a (T11FcSpPolicyNameType, T11FcSpPolicyName) tuple.
In contrast, this MIB module uses the conventional MIB syntax for IP addresses, and therefore represents the Policy Object Name of an IP Management Entry Policy Object as a (InetAddressType, InetAddress, InetAddress) tuple.
In theory, the use of t11FcSpPoNaIpMgmtEntryNameLow and t11FcSpPoNaIpMgmtEntryNameHigh, which have the syntax of InetAddress, in the INDEX could cause the need for excessively long OIDs.

When the value of the corresponding instance of t11FcSpPoNaAttribExtension is not zeroDotZero, then the same underlying management data has its value contained both in this object and in the individual/broken out parts pointed to by t11FcSpPoNaAttribExtension.
Thus, after any modification of the underlying management data, e.g., after a Set operation to the value of either MIB representation, then that modification is reflected in the values of both MIB representations.

This MIB module specifies the management information required to manage Security Associations established via Fibre Channel's FC SP specification.
The MIB module consists of six parts: a per Fabric table, t11FcSpSaIfTable, of capabilities, parameters, status information, and counters; the counters include non transient aggregates of per SA transient counters; three tables, t11FcSpSaPropTable, t11FcSpSaTSelPropTable, and t11FcSpSaTransTable, specifying the proposals for an FC SP entity acting as an SA Initiator to present to the SA Responder during the negotiation of Security Associations.
The same information is also used by an FC SP entity acting as an SA Responder to decide what to accept during the negotiation of Security Associations.
One of these tables, t11FcSpSaTransTable, is used not only for information about security transforms to propose and to accept, but also as agreed upon during the negotiation of Security Associations; a table, t11FcSpSaTSelDrByTable, of Traffic Selectors having the security action of 'drop' or 'bypass' to be applied either to ingress traffic that is unprotected by FC SP, or to all egress traffic; four tables, t11FcSpSaPairTable, t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable, t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable, and t11FcSpSaTSelSpiTable, containing information about active bidirectional pairs of Security Associations; in particular, t11FcSpSaPairTable has one row per active bidirectional SA pair, t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable and t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable contain information on the Traffic Selectors negotiated on the SAs, and the t11FcSpSaTSelSpiTable is an alternate lookup table such that the Traffic Selector(s)
in use on a particular Security Association can be quickly determined based on the (ingress) SPI value; a table, t11FcSpSaControlTable, of control and other information concerning the generation of notifications for events related to FC SP Security Associations; one notification, t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure, generated on the occurrence of an Authentication failure for a received FC 2 or CT IU frame.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 5324;  see the RFC itself for full legal notices."

If any row has a non zero value of t11FcSpSaIfIndex, then all rows for the same Fibre Channel management instance must also have a non zero value of t11FcSpSaIfIndex and thereby be specific to a particular interface.
As and when zero values of t11FcSpSaIfIndex are used in this table, then they must also be used in each other table that has t11FcSpSaIfIndex in its INDEX clause."

The StorageType of a row in this table is specified by the instance of t11FcSpSaTransStorageType in that row.

IANA Considerations IANA has made one MIB OID assignment, under the appropriate subtree, for each of the five MIB modules defined in this document.
In this section, the first sub section explains why this document does not define MIB objects for particular items of (management) information.
This is followed by one sub section for each of the MIB modules defined in section 6, listing their individual Security Considerations.
The section concludes with Security Considerations common to all of these MIB modules.
The key word "RECOMMENDED" contained in this section is to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
Information Not Defined in This Document
This document doesn't define any MIB objects for the secrets that need to be known/determined by FC SP entities in order to use DH CHAP to authenticate each other.
Such secrets are "highly sensitive" and need to be "strong secrets" (e.g., randomly generated and/or from an external source, see section 5.4.8 of [FC SP]) rather than just passwords.
Thus, such secrets need to be managed by mechanisms other than the MIB modules defined here.
The T11 FC SP TC MIB Module
This MIB module defines some data types and assigns some Object Identifiers, for use as the syntax and as values of MIB objects, respectively, but it itself defines no MIB objects.
Thus, there is no direct read or write access via a management protocol, such as SNMP, to these definitions.
Nevertheless, it does include the assignment of enumerations and OIDs to represent cryptographic algorithms/transforms, and it is appropriate for such assignments to be augmented with new assignments as and when new algorithms/transforms are available.
The T11 FC SP AUTHENTICATION
There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability are: t11FcSpAuStorageType could cause changes in the configuration to be retained or not retained over restarts, against the wishes of management.
t11FcSpAuSendRejNotifyEnable t11FcSpAuRcvRejNotifyEnable could cause the suppression of SNMP notifications (e.g., of authentication failures or protocol failures), or the disruption of network operations due to the generation of unwanted notifications.
t11FcSpAuDefaultLifetime t11FcSpAuDefaultLifetimeUnits could cause the lifetimes of Security Associations to be extended longer than might be secure, or shortened to cause an increase in the overhead of using security.
t11FcSpAuRejectMaxRows could cause a smaller audit trail of Authentication rejects, thereby hiding the tracks of an attacker, or a larger audit trail of Authentication rejects causing resources to be wasted.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: t11FcSpAuEntityTable the capabilities of FC SP Authentication entities in terms of what cryptographic algorithms they support, and various configuration parameters of FC SP Authentication entities.
t11FcSpAuIfStatTable the mapping of which FC SP Authentication entities operate on which interfaces.
t11FcSpAuRejectTable an audit trail of authentication failures and other Authentication Protocol failures.
The T11 FC SP ZONING MIB Module
There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability are: t11FcSpZsServerEnabled could cause FC SP Zoning mode to be enabled or not enabled, against the wishes of management.
t11FcSpZoneSetHashStatus could cause an FC SP implementation to recalculate the values of the Active Zone Set Hash and the Zone Set Database Hash more frequently than is required by management.
t11FcSpZsNotifyJoinSuccessEnable t11FcSpZsNotifyJoinFailureEnable could cause the suppression of SNMP notifications that a Switch in one Fabric has successfully joined/failed to join with a Switch in another Fabric, or the disruption of network operations due to the generation of unwanted notifications.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: t11FcSpZsServerCapabilityObject t11FcSpZsServerEnabled the FC SP Zoning capabilities and status of the FC SP implementation.
the current values of the Active Zone Set Hash and the Zone Set Database Hash.
The T11 FC SP POLICY
There are many management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
The objects and tables and their sensitivity/vulnerability are: t11FcSpPoNaSummaryTable t11FcSpPoNaSwListTable t11FcSpPoNaSwMembTable t11FcSpPoNaNoMembTable
t11FcSpPoNaCtDescrTable t11FcSpPoNaSwConnTable t11FcSpPoNaIpMgmtTable could change the currently inactive FC SP Fabric Policies, so as to allow unauthorized connectivity of Switches and/or Nodes to the network, or between Switches in the network, or, to prohibit such connectivity even when authorized.
t11FcSpPoNaIpMgmtTable t11FcSpPoNaWkpDescrTable could change the currently inactive FC SP Fabric Policies, so as to allow unauthorized management access to Switches, or prohibit authorized management access to Switches.
t11FcSpPoNaSummaryTable t11FcSpPoNaSwMembTable t11FcSpPoNaNoMembTable t11FcSpPoNaAttribTable t11FcSpPoNaAuthProtTable could change the currently inactive FC SP Fabric Policies, so as to allow Security Associations with reduced security or require Security Associations that are unnecessarily secure.
t11FcSpPoOperActivate t11FcSpPoOperDeActivate could cause the currently active FC SP Fabric Policies to be de activated and currently inactive FC SP Fabric Policies (e.g., those modified as above) to be activated instead.
t11FcSpPoStorageType could cause changes in the configuration and/or in FC SP Fabric Policies to be retained or not retained over restarts, against the wishes of management.
t11FcSpPoNotificationEnable could cause the suppression of SNMP notifications on the successful/unsuccessful activation/deactivation of Fabric Policies, and thereby hide successful/failed attempts to make unauthorized changes, or cause the disruption of network operations due to the generation of unwanted notifications.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability are: t11FcSpSaIfStorageType t11FcSpSaTSelPropStorageType
t11FcSpSaTransStorageType could cause changes in configuration information related to FC SP Security Associations to be retained or not retained over restarts, against the wishes of management.
t11FcSpSaIfReplayPrevention t11FcSpSaIfReplayWindowSize could cause changes in the operation of anti replay protection, thereby permitting an attacker to conduct replay attacks, or requiring FC SP implementations to engage in unnecessary protection against replay.
t11FcSpSaIfTerminateAllSas t11FcSpSaPairTerminate could cause FC SP Security Associations to be aborted unnecessarily.
t11FcSpSaControlAuthFailEnable could cause the suppression of SNMP notifications on the occurrence of Authentication failures for received FC 2 or CT IU frames, thereby hiding attempts to subvert security measures, or cause the disruption of network operations due to the generation of unwanted notifications.
t11FcSpSaControlLifeExcdEnable could cause the suppression of SNMP notifications on the occurrence of an FC SP Security Association exceeding its lifetime, thereby possibly causing disruption to network usage due to a delay in determining the problem and/or re  establishing the Security Association.
t11FcSpSaControlWindow could cause the suppression of second and subsequent SNMP notifications on the occurrence of Authentication failures for received FC 2 or CT IU frames, thereby masking repeated attempts to subvert security measures, or cause the disruption of network operations due to the generation of unwanted notifications.
t11FcSpSaControlMaxNotifs could cause the suppression of all SNMP notifications on the occurrence of Authentication failures for received FC 2 or CT IU frames, thereby masking attempts to subvert security measures, or cause the disruption of network operations due to the generation of unwanted notifications.
t11FcSpSaPropTable t11FcSpSaTSelPropTable t11FcSpSaTransTable could cause an FC SP entity to propose the setup of Security Associations that apply to a different selection of traffic and/or using different security transforms, such that some traffic has a reduced level of security that might improve an attacker's chance of subverting security, or an increased level of security that would involve unnecessary security processing, or cause the negotiation of Security Associations to fail to find commonly acceptable parameters such that no Security Associations can be established.
t11FcSpSaTSelDrByTable could cause an FC SP entity to select different sets of traffic which are: a) to be sent/received without being protected by FC SP security, thereby providing an attacker with access to read authentic traffic or the ability to introduce unauthentic traffic; or b) to be dropped instead of being sent/after being received, thereby causing disruption to network usage.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
t11FcSpSaIfTable information concerning the capabilities, parameters and status of an FC SP entity's support for Security Associations.
t11FcSpSaPropTable t11FcSpSaTSelPropTable t11FcSpSaTransTable information on the proposals that will be used by an FC SP entity to negotiate Security Associations.
t11FcSpSaTSelDrByTable information on which subsets of traffic
an FC SP entity will send or receive without being protected by FC SP security, or will drop before sending/after receiving.
t11FcSpSaPairTable t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable t11FcSpSaTSelSpiTable information on which Security Associations are currently active, what subsets of traffic they are carrying, and what security protection is being given to them.
Recommendations Common to All MIB Modules SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
Because the two algorithms currently specified for T11FcSpPolicyHashFormat are SHA 1 and SHA 256, the definition of T11FcSpHashCalculationStatus expresses a concern in regard to not incrementally recomputing the hashes after each change when a series of multiple related changes are being made.
This method of reducing computation is intended as a responsiveness measure (i.e., cooperating SNMP managers and agents can get things done faster), not as a Denial of Service (DoS) countermeasure.
Nevertheless, implementations should also consider the DoS possibilities in these scenarios; potential countermeasures include: requiring authentication for SETs and the rate limiting of SET operations if they can cause significant computation.
