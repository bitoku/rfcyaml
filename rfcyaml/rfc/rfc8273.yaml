  - "1.  Introduction\n   The concepts in this document were originally developed\
    \ as part of a\n   large-scale production deployment of IPv6 support for a provider-\n\
    \   managed shared-access network service.\n   A shared-access network service\
    \ is a service offering in which a\n   particular Layer 2 (L2) access network\
    \ (e.g., Wi-Fi) is shared and\n   used by multiple visiting devices (i.e., subscribers).\
    \  Many service\n   providers offering shared-access network services have legal\n\
    \   requirements, or find it good practice, to provide isolation between\n   the\
    \ connected visitor devices to control potential abuse of the\n   shared-access\
    \ network.\n   A network implementing a unique IPv6 prefix per host can simply\n\
    \   ensure that devices cannot send packets to each other except through\n   the\
    \ first-hop router.  This will automatically provide robust\n   protection against\
    \ attacks between devices that rely on link-local\n   ICMPv6 packets, such as\
    \ Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) reply\n   spoofing, Neighbor Discovery (ND)\
    \ cache exhaustion, malicious\n   redirects, and rogue Router Advertisements (RAs).\
    \  This form of\n   protection is much more scalable and robust than alternative\n\
    \   mechanisms such as DAD proxying, forced forwarding, or ND snooping.\n   In\
    \ this document IPv6 support does not preclude support for IPv4;\n   however,\
    \ the primary objective for this work was to make it so that\n   user equipment\
    \ (UE) were capable of an IPv6-only experience from a\n   network operator's perspective.\
    \  In the context of this document, UE\n   can be 'regular' end-user equipment\
    \ as well as a server in a data\n   center, assuming a shared network (wired or\
    \ wireless) exists.\n   Details of IPv4 support are out of scope for this document.\
    \  This\n   document will also, in general, outline the requirements that must\
    \ be\n   satisfied by UE to allow for an IPv6-only experience.\n   In most current\
    \ deployments, assignment of UE IPv6 addresses is\n   commonly done using IPv6\
    \ Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)\n   [RFC4862] and/or DHCP IA_NA\
    \ (Identity Association - Non-temporary\n   Address) [RFC3315].  During the time\
    \ when this approach was developed\n   and subsequently deployed, it was observed\
    \ that some operating\n   systems did not support the use of DHCPv6 for the acquisition\
    \ of\n   IA_NA per [RFC7934].  To not exclude any known IPv6 implementations,\n\
    \   IPv6-SLAAC-based subscriber and address management is the recommended\n  \
    \ technology to reach the highest percentage of connected IPv6 devices\n   on\
    \ a provider-managed shared-access network service.  In addition, an\n   IA_NA-only\
    \ network is not recommended per Section 8 of [RFC7934].\n   This document will\
    \ detail the mechanics involved for IPv6-SLAAC-based\n   address and subscriber\
    \ management coupled with stateless DHCPv6,\n   where beneficial.\n   This document\
    \ focuses upon the process for UE to obtain a unique IPv6\n   prefix.\n"

- title: 2.  Motivation and Scope of Applicability
  contents:
  - "2.  Motivation and Scope of Applicability\n   The motivation for this work falls\
    \ into the following categories:\n   o  Give deployment advice for IPv6 that will\
    \ allow a stable and\n      secure IPv6-only experience, even if IPv4 support\
    \ is present\n   o  Ensure support for IPv6 is efficient and does not impact the\n\
    \      performance of the underlying network and, in turn, the customer\n    \
    \  experience\n   o  Allow for the greatest flexibility across host implementations\
    \ to\n      allow for the widest range of addressing and configuration\n     \
    \ mechanisms to be employed.  Ensure that the widest population of\n      UE implementations\
    \ can leverage the availability of IPv6\n   o  Lay the technological foundation\
    \ for future work related to the\n      use of IPv6 over shared media, requiring\
    \ optimized subscriber\n      management\n   o  Ensure that two devices (subscriber/hosts),\
    \ both attached to the\n      same provider-managed shared-access network, should\
    \ only be able\n      to communicate through the provider-managed first-hop router.\n\
    \      Often, service providers have legal requirements, or find it good\n   \
    \   practice, to provide isolation between the connected visitor\n      devices\
    \ in order to control potential abuse of the shared-access\n      network.\n \
    \  o  Provide guidelines regarding best common practices around IPv6 ND\n    \
    \  [RFC4861] and IPv6-address-management settings between the first-\n      hop\
    \ router and directly connected hosts/subscribers.\n"
- title: 3.  Design Principles
  contents:
  - "3.  Design Principles\n   The first-hop router discussed in this document is\
    \ the L3 Edge router\n   responsible for the communication with the devices (hosts\
    \ and\n   subscribers) directly connected to a provider-managed shared-access\n\
    \   network; it is also responsible for transporting traffic between the\n   directly\
    \ connected devices and between directly connected devices and\n   remote devices.\n\
    \   The work detailed in this document is focused on providing details\n   regarding\
    \ best common practices of the IPv6 ND and related IPv6-\n   address-management\
    \ settings between the first-hop router and directly\n   connected hosts/subscribers.\
    \  The documented best current practice\n   helps a service provider to better\
    \ manage the provider-managed\n   shared-access network on behalf of the connected\
    \ devices.\n   This document recommends providing a unique IPv6 prefix to devices\n\
    \   connected to the provider-managed shared-access network.  Each unique\n  \
    \ IPv6 prefix can function as a control-plane anchor point to make sure\n   that\
    \ each device receives expected subscriber policy and service\n   levels (throughput,\
    \ QoS, security, parental control, subscriber-\n   mobility management, etc.).\n"
- title: 4.  Assignment of IPv6 Unique Prefixes
  contents:
  - "4.  Assignment of IPv6 Unique Prefixes\n   When a UE connects to the provider-managed\
    \ shared-access network, it\n   will initiate the IP configuration phase.  During\
    \ this phase, the UE\n   will, from an IPv6 perspective, attempt to learn the\
    \ default IPv6\n   gateway, the IPv6 prefix information, the DNS information [RFC8106],\n\
    \   and the remaining information required to establish globally routable\n  \
    \ IPv6 connectivity.  For that purpose, the subscriber sends an RS\n   (Router\
    \ Solicitation) message.\n   The first-hop router receives this subscriber RS\
    \ message and starts\n   the process of composing the response to the subscriber-originated\
    \ RS\n   message.  The first-hop router will answer using a solicited RA to\n\
    \   the subscriber.\n   When the first-hop router sends a solicited RA response,\
    \ or\n   periodically sends unsolicited RAs, the RA MUST be sent only to the\n\
    \   subscriber that has been assigned the unique IPv6 prefix contained in\n  \
    \ the RA.  This is achieved by sending a solicited RA response or\n   unsolicited\
    \ RAs to the all-nodes group, as detailed in Sections 6.2.4\n   and 6.2.6 of [RFC4861];\
    \ but, instead of using the link-layer\n   multicast address associated with the\
    \ all-nodes group, the link-layer\n   unicast address of the subscriber that has\
    \ been assigned the unique\n   IPv6 prefix contained in the RA MUST be used as\
    \ the link-layer\n   destination [RFC6085].  Or, optionally in some cases, a solicited\
    \ RA\n   response could be sent (unicast) to the link-local address of the\n \
    \  subscriber as detailed in Section 6.2.6 of [RFC4861]; nevertheless,\n   unsolicited\
    \ RAs are always sent to the all-nodes group.\n   This solicited RA contains two\
    \ important parameters for the\n   subscriber to consume: a unique IPv6 prefix\
    \ (currently a /64 prefix)\n   and some flags.  The unique IPv6 prefix can be\
    \ derived from a locally\n   managed pool or aggregate IPv6 block assigned to\
    \ the first-hop router\n   or from a centrally allocated pool.  The flags indicate\
    \ that the\n   subscriber should use SLAAC and/or DHCPv6 for address assignment;\
    \ it\n   may indicate whether the autoconfigured address is on/off-link and if\n\
    \   'Other' information (e.g., DNS server address) needs to be requested.\n  \
    \ The IPv6 RA flags used for best common practice in IPv6-SLAAC-based\n   provider-managed\
    \ shared-access networks are:\n   o  M-flag = 0 (The subscriber address is not\
    \ managed through DHCPv6);\n      this flag may be set to 1 in the future if/when\
    \ DHCPv6-prefix-\n      delegation support is desired.)\n   o  O-flag = 1 (DHCPv6\
    \ is used to request configuration information,\n      i.e., DNS, NTP information,\
    \ not for IPv6 addressing.)\n   o  A-flag = 1 (The subscriber can configure itself\
    \ using SLAAC.)\n   o  L-flag = 0 (The prefix is not an on-link prefix, which\
    \ means that\n      the subscriber will never assume destination addresses that\
    \ match\n      the prefix are on-link and will always send packets to those\n\
    \      addresses to the appropriate gateway according to route selection\n   \
    \   rules.)\n   The use of a unique IPv6 prefix per subscriber adds an additional\n\
    \   level of protection and efficiency.  The protection exists because\n   all\
    \ external communication of a connected device is directed to the\n   first-hop\
    \ router as required by [RFC4861].  Best efficiency is\n   achieved because the\
    \ recommended RA flags allow the broadest support\n   on connected devices to\
    \ receive a valid IPv6 address (i.e., privacy\n   addresses [RFC4941] or SLAAC\
    \ [RFC4862]).\n   The architected result of designing the RA as documented above\
    \ is\n   that each subscriber gets its own unique IPv6 prefix.  Each host can\n\
    \   consequently use SLAAC or any other method of choice to select its\n   /128\
    \ unique address.  Either stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736] or IPv6\n   Router Advertisement\
    \ Options for DNS Configuration [RFC8106] can be\n   used to get the IPv6 address\
    \ of the DNS server.  If the subscriber\n   desires to send anything external,\
    \ including towards other subscriber\n   devices (assuming device-to-device communications\
    \ is enabled and\n   supported), then, due to the L-bit being unset, [RFC4861]\
    \ requires\n   that this traffic be sent to the first-hop router.\n   After the\
    \ subscriber received the RA and the associated flags, it\n   will assign itself\
    \ a 128-bit IPv6 address using SLAAC.  Since the\n   address is composed by the\
    \ subscriber device itself, it will need to\n   verify that the address is unique\
    \ on the shared network.  The\n   subscriber will, for that purpose, perform the\
    \ DAD algorithm.  This\n   will occur for each address the UE attempts to utilize\
    \ on the\n   provider-managed shared-access network.\n"
- title: 5.  Best Practices for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
  contents:
  - "5.  Best Practices for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\n   An operational consideration\
    \ when using IPv6-address assignment with\n   IPv6 SLAAC is that after the onboarding\
    \ procedure, the subscriber\n   will have a prefix with certain preferred and\
    \ valid lifetimes.  The\n   first-hop router extends these lifetimes by sending\
    \ an unsolicited\n   RA, the applicable MaxRtrAdvInterval on the first-hop router\
    \ MUST,\n   therefore, be lower than the preferred lifetime.  One consequence\
    \ of\n   this process is that the first-hop router never knows when a\n   subscriber\
    \ stops using addresses from a prefix, and additional\n   procedures are required\
    \ to help the first-hop router to gain this\n   information.  When using stateful\
    \ DHCPv6 IA_NA for IPv6-subscriber-\n   address assignment, this uncertainty on\
    \ the first-hop router does not\n   have an impact due to the stateful nature\
    \ of the assignment of DHCPv6\n   IA_NA addresses.\n   The following is a reference\
    \ table of the key IPv6 router and\n   neighbor discovery timers for provider-managed\
    \ shared-access\n   networks:\n   o  Maximum IPv6 Router Advertisement Interval\
    \ (MaxRtrAdvInterval) =\n      300 s (or when battery consumption is a concern\
    \ 686 s, see note\n      below)\n   o  IPv6 Router Lifetime = 3600 s (see note\
    \ below)\n   o  Reachable time = 30 s\n   o  IPv6 Valid Lifetime = 3600 s\n  \
    \ o  IPv6 Preferred Lifetime = 1800 s\n   o  Retransmit timer = 0 s\n   Note:\
    \ When servicing large numbers of battery powered devices,\n   [RFC7772] suggests\
    \ a maximum of seven RAs per hour and a 45-90 minute\n   IPv6 Router Lifetime.\
    \  To achieve a maximum of seven RAs per hour,\n   the Minimum IPv6 Router Advertisement\
    \ Interval (MinRtrAdvInterval) is\n   the important parameter, and it MUST be\
    \ greater than or equal to 514\n   seconds (1/7 of an hour).  Further, as discussed\
    \ in Section 6.2.1. of\n   [RFC4861], MinRtrAdvInterval <=0.75 * MaxRtrAdvInterval;\
    \ therefore,\n   MaxRtrAdvInterval MUST additionally be greater than or equal\
    \ to 686\n   seconds.  As for the recommended IPv6 Router Lifetime, since this\n\
    \   technique requires that RAs be sent using the link-layer unicast\n   address\
    \ of the subscriber, the concerns over multicast delivery\n   discussed in [RFC7772]\
    \ are already mitigated; therefore, the above\n   suggestion of 3600 seconds (an\
    \ hour) seems sufficient for this use\n   case.\n   IPv6 SLAAC requires the router\
    \ to maintain neighbor state, which\n   implies costs in terms of memory, power,\
    \ message exchanges, and\n   message processing.  Stale entries can prove an unnecessary\
    \ burden,\n   especially on Wi-Fi interfaces.  It is RECOMMENDED that stale\n\
    \   neighbor state be removed quickly.\n   When employing stateless IPv6 address\
    \ assignment, a number of widely\n   deployed operating systems will attempt to\
    \ utilize [RFC4941]\n   temporary 'private' addresses.\n   Similarly, when using\
    \ this technology in a data center, the UE server\n   may need to use several\
    \ addresses from the same unique IPv6 prefix,\n   for example, because is using\
    \ multiple virtual hosts, containers,\n   etc., in the bridged-virtual switch.\
    \  This can lead to the\n   consequence that a UE has multiple /128 addresses\
    \ from the same IPv6\n   prefix.  The first-hop router MUST be able to handle\
    \ the presence and\n   use of multiple globally routable IPv6 addresses.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The mechanics of IPv6 privacy extensions [RFC4941]\
    \ are compatible\n   with assignment of a unique IPv6 prefix per host.  However,\
    \ when\n   combining both IPv6 privacy extensions and a unique IPv6 prefix per\n\
    \   host, a reduced privacy experience for the subscriber is introduced.\n   This\
    \ is because a prefix may be associated with a subscriber, even\n   when the subscriber\
    \ has implemented IPv6 privacy extensions\n   [RFC4941].  If the operator assigns\
    \ the same unique prefix to the\n   same link-layer address every time a host\
    \ connects, any remote party\n   who is aware of this fact can easily track a\
    \ host simply by tracking\n   its assigned prefix.  This nullifies the benefit\
    \ provided by privacy\n   addresses [RFC4941].  If a host wishes to maintain privacy\
    \ on such\n   networks, it SHOULD ensure that its link-layer address is\n   periodically\
    \ changed or randomized.\n   No other additional security considerations are made\
