  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC4861] defines a conceptual\
    \ sending\n   algorithm for hosts.  The version of the algorithm described in\n\
    \   [RFC2461] states that if a host's default router list is empty, then\n   the\
    \ host assumes that all destinations are on-link.  This memo\n   documents the\
    \ removal of this assumption in the updated Neighbor\n   Discovery specification\
    \ [RFC4861] and describes the reasons why this\n   assumption was removed.\n \
    \  This assumption is problematic with IPv6-capable nodes that do not\n   have\
    \ off-link IPv6 connectivity.  This is typical when systems that\n   have IPv6\
    \ enabled on their network interfaces (either on by default\n   or administratively\
    \ configured that way) are attached to networks\n   that have no IPv6 services\
    \ such as off-link routing.  Such systems\n   will resolve DNS names to AAAA and\
    \ A records, and they may attempt to\n   connect to unreachable IPv6 off-link\
    \ nodes.\n   The on-link assumption creates problems for destination address\n\
    \   selection as defined in [RFC3484], and it adds connection delays\n   associated\
    \ with unnecessary address resolution and neighbor\n   unreachability detection.\
    \  The behavior associated with the\n   assumption is undefined on multi-interface\
    \ nodes and has some subtle\n   security implications.  All of these issues are\
    \ discussed in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.  Background on the On-link Assumption
  contents:
  - "2.  Background on the On-link Assumption\n   This part of Neighbor Discovery's\
    \ [RFC2461] conceptual sending\n   algorithm was created to facilitate communication\
    \ on a single link\n   between systems configured with different global prefixes\
    \ in the\n   absence of an IPv6 router.  For example, consider the case where\
    \ two\n   systems on separate links are manually configured with global\n   addresses\
    \ and are then plugged in back-to-back.  They can still\n   communicate with each\
    \ other via their global addresses because\n   they'll correctly assume that each\
    \ is on-link.\n   Without the on-link assumption, the above scenario wouldn't\
    \ work, and\n   the systems would need to be configured to share a common prefix\
    \ such\n   as the link-local prefix.  On the other hand, the on-link assumption\n\
    \   introduces several problems to various parts of the networking stack\n   described\
    \ in Section 3.  As such, this document points out that the\n   problems introduced\
    \ by the on-link assumption outweigh the benefit\n   that the assumption lends\
    \ to this scenario.  It is more beneficial to\n   the end user to remove the on-link\
    \ assumption from Neighbor Discovery\n   and declare this scenario illegitimate\
    \ (or a misconfiguration).\n"
- title: 3.  Problems
  contents:
  - "3.  Problems\n   The on-link assumption causes the following problems.\n"
- title: 3.1.  First Rule of Destination Address Selection
  contents:
  - "3.1.  First Rule of Destination Address Selection\n   Default Address Selection\
    \ for IPv6 [RFC3484] defines a destination\n   address selection algorithm that\
    \ takes an unordered list of\n   destination addresses as input and produces a\
    \ sorted list of\n   destination addresses as output.  The algorithm consists\
    \ of\n   destination address sorting rules, the first of which is \"Avoid\n  \
    \ unusable destinations\".  The idea behind this rule is to place\n   unreachable\
    \ destinations at the end of the sorted list so that\n   applications will be\
    \ least likely to try to communicate with those\n   addresses first.\n   The on-link\
    \ assumption could potentially cause false positives when\n   attempting unreachability\
    \ determination for this rule.  On a network\n   where there is no IPv6 router\
    \ (all off-link IPv6 destinations are\n   unreachable), the on-link assumption\
    \ states that destinations are\n   assumed to be on-link.  An implementation could\
    \ interpret that as, if\n   the default router list is empty, then all destinations\
    \ are reachable\n   on-link.  This may cause the rule to prefer an unreachable\
    \ IPv6\n   destination over a reachable IPv4 destination.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Delays Associated with Address Resolution
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Delays Associated with Address Resolution\n   Users expect that applications\
    \ quickly connect to a given destination\n   regardless of the number of IP addresses\
    \ assigned to that\n   destination.  If a destination name resolves to multiple\
    \ addresses\n   and the application attempts to communicate to each address until\
    \ one\n   succeeds, this process shouldn't take an unreasonable amount of time.\n\
    \   It is therefore important that the system quickly determine if IPv6\n   destinations\
    \ are unreachable so that the application can try other\n   destinations when\
    \ those IPv6 destinations are unreachable.\n   For an IPv6-enabled host deployed\
    \ on a network that has no IPv6\n   routers, the result of the on-link assumption\
    \ is that link-layer\n   address resolution must be performed on all IPv6 addresses\
    \ to which\n   the host sends packets.  The application will not receive\n   acknowledgment\
    \ of the unreachability of destinations that are not on-\n   link until at least\
    \ address resolution has failed, which is no less\n   than 3 seconds (MAX_MULTICAST_SOLICIT\
    \ * RETRANS_TIMER).  This is\n   greatly amplified by transport protocol delays.\
    \  For example,\n   [RFC1122] Section 4.2.3.5 requires that TCP retransmit for\
    \ at least 3\n   minutes before aborting the connection attempt.\n   When the\
    \ application has a large list of off-link unreachable IPv6\n   addresses followed\
    \ by at least one reachable IPv4 address, the delay\n   associated with Neighbor\
    \ Unreachability Detection (NUD) of each IPv6\n   address before successful communication\
    \ with the IPv4 address is\n   unacceptable.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Multi-interface Ambiguity
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Multi-interface Ambiguity\n   There is no defined way to implement this\
    \ aspect of the sending\n   algorithm on a node that is attached to multiple links.\n\
    \   Specifically, a problem arises when a node is faced with sending a\n   packet\
    \ to an IPv6 destination address to which it has no route, and\n   the sending\
    \ node is attached to multiple links.  With the on-link\n   assumption, this node\
    \ assumes that the destination is on-link, but on\n   which link?  From an implementor's\
    \ point of view, there are three\n   ways to handle sending an IPv6 packet to\
    \ a destination in the face of\n   the on-link assumption on a multi-interface\
    \ node:\n   1.  Attempt to send the packet on a single link (either\n       administratively\
    \ pre-defined or using some algorithm).\n   2.  Attempt to send the packet on\
    \ every link.\n   3.  Drop the packet.\n   If the destination is indeed on-link,\
    \ the first option might not\n   succeed since the wrong link could be picked.\
    \  The second option\n   might succeed in reaching the destination but is more\
    \ complex to\n   implement and isn't guaranteed to pick the correct destination.\
    \  For\n   example, there could be more than one node configured with the same\n\
    \   address, each reachable through a different link.  The address by\n   itself\
    \ does not disambiguate which destination the sender actually\n   wanted to reach,\
    \ so attempting to send the packet to every link is\n   not guaranteed to reach\
    \ the anticipated destination.  The third\n   option, dropping the packet, is\
    \ equivalent to not making the on-link\n   assumption at all.  In other words,\
    \ if there is no route to the\n   destination, don't attempt to send the packet.\
    \  An implementation\n   that behaves this way would require an administrator\
    \ to configure\n   routes to the destination in order to have reachability to\
    \ the\n   destination, thus eliminating the ambiguity.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Security-Related Issues
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Security-Related Issues\n   The on-link assumption discussed here introduces\
    \ a security\n   vulnerability to the Neighbor Discovery protocol described in\
    \ Section\n   4.2.2 of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Trust Models and Threats [RFC3756]\n\
    \   titled \"Default router is 'killed'\".  There is a threat that a host's\n\
    \   router can be maliciously killed in order to cause the host to start\n   sending\
    \ all packets on-link.  The attacker can then spoof off-link\n   nodes by sending\
    \ packets on the same link as the host.  The\n   vulnerability is discussed in\
    \ detail in [RFC3756].\n   Another security-related side-effect of the on-link\
    \ assumption has to\n   do with virtual private networks (VPNs).  It has been\
    \ observed that\n   some commercially available VPN software solutions that don't\
    \ support\n   IPv6 send IPv6 packets to the local media in the clear (their\n\
    \   security policy doesn't simply drop IPv6 packets).  Consider a\n   scenario\
    \ where a system has a single Ethernet interface with VPN\n   software that encrypts\
    \ and encapsulates certain packets.  The system\n   attempts to send a packet\
    \ to an IPv6 destination that it obtained by\n   doing a DNS lookup, and the packet\
    \ ends up going in the clear to the\n   local media.  A malicious third party\
    \ could then spoof the\n   destination on-link.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Changes to RFC 2461\n   The following changes have been made to the Neighbor\
    \ Discovery\n   specification between [RFC2461] and [RFC4861]:\n      The last\
    \ sentence of the second paragraph of Section 5.2\n      (\"Conceptual Sending\
    \ Algorithm\") was removed.  This sentence was,\n      \"If the Default Router\
    \ List is empty, the sender assumes that the\n      destination is on-link.\"\n\
    \      Bullet item 3) in Section 6.3.6 (\"Default Router Selection\") was\n  \
    \    removed.  The item read, \"If the Default Router List is empty,\n      assume\
    \ that all destinations are on-link as specified in Section\n      5.2.\"\n  \
    \    APPENDIX A was modified to remove on-link assumption related text\n     \
    \ in bullet item 1) under the discussion on what happens when a\n      multihomed\
    \ host fails to receive Router Advertisements.\n   The result of these changes\
    \ is that destinations are considered\n   unreachable when there is no routing\
    \ information for that destination\n   (through a default router or otherwise).\
    \  Instead of attempting link-\n   layer address resolution when sending to such\
    \ a destination, a node\n   should send an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message\
    \ (code 0 - no\n   route to destination) message up the stack.\n"
