  - "                        FORMAT FOR BITMAP FILES\n   This note describes a proposed\
    \ format for storing simple bitmaps (one\n   bit per pixel)  in a file.   These\
    \  files  may be very  large and the\n   intent  is to use this format for short\
    \ term storage and passing data\n   between  closely  coupled  programs.   The\
    \ data in the file should be\n   stored in 8-bit bytes (octets).  Bitmaps may\
    \ be any size.\n   The first  4 octets  of the file  gives  the width  of each\
    \  line  (x\n   direction),  and the next 4 octets should give the number of lines\
    \ of\n   the display  (length, y direction). After this is one octet for the x\n\
    \   increment  and one octet for the y  increment.   Following  these  10\n  \
    \ octets  is the bitmap  itself.     The length  and width  fields  are\n   stored\
    \ most significant octet first.\n   The x and y increment  octets  tell how much\
    \ space is between pixels.\n   For an ordinary display, both these would be one.\n\
    \   Each line of the display  should  be scanned  from left to right. The\n  \
    \ lines should start at the top and work down.  Each line in the bitmap\n   should\
    \  end on an octet boundary.  If the width of the display is not\n   divisable\
    \  by 8,  the rest of the last octet  should  be filled  with\n   zeros on the\
    \ right.\n   Below  is a representation  of a bitmap  file  (each  square  is\
    \  one\n   octet):\n      |    1     |    2     |    3     |     4     |     5\
    \     |\n      |  width   |  width   |  width   |   width   |  length   |\n  \
    \    |     6    |     7    |     8    |     9     |     10    |\n      |  length\
    \  |  length  |  length  |x-increment|y-increment|\n      |   11     |   12  \
    \   |   13     |    14     |   15\n      |  data    |  data    |  data    |  \
    \ data    |  data...\n   For example,  bitmaps  from the RAPICOM  450 can be in\
    \  Fine  Detail,\n   Quality,  or Express  Mode.   In Fine Detail mode the x-increment\
    \ and\n   y-increment  would be 1, for Quality mode, the x-increment would be\
    \ 1\n   and the y-increment would be 2, and for Express mode, the x-increment\n\
    \   would  be 1 and the y-increment  would be 3.  For these bitmaps it is\n  \
    \ intended  that each scan line be repeated y-increment times when they\n   are\
    \ displayed.\n"
