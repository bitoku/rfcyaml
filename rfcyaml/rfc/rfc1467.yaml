    \ RFC 1367, which was a schedule for the deployment of IP\n   address space management\
    \ procedures to support route aggregation.\n   Since all the milestones proposed\
    \ in RFC 1367 except for the delivery\n   and installation of CIDR software were\
    \ met, it does not seem\n   appropriate to issue an updated schedule. Rather,\

- title: 1. Background
  contents:
  - "1. Background\n   The Internet's exponential growth has led to a number of difficulties\n\
    \   relating to the management of IP network numbers.  The administrative\n  \
    \ overhead of allocating ever increasing volumes of IP network numbers\n   for\
    \ global users has stressed the organizations that perform this\n   function.\
    \  The volume of IP network numbers that are reachable\n   through the Internet\
    \ has taxed a number of routers' ability to manage\n   their forwarding tables.\
    \  The poor utilization of allocated IP\n   network numbers has threatened to\
    \ deplete the Class A and Class B\n   address space.\n   During the past few years,\
    \ a consensus has emerged among the Internet\n   community in favor of a number\
    \ of mechanisms to relieve these\n   problems for the mid-term.  These mechanisms\
    \ are expected to be put\n   into place in the short term and to provide relief\
    \ for the mid-term.\n   Fundamental changes to the Internet protocols to ensure\
    \ the\n   Internet's continued long term growth and well being are being\n   explored\
    \ and are expected to succeed the mid-term mechanisms.\n   The global Internet\
    \ community have been cooperating closely in such\n   forums as the IETF and its\
    \ working groups, the IEPG, the NSF Regional\n   Techs Meetings, INET, INTEROP,\
    \ FNC, FEPG, and other assemblies in\n   order to ensure the continued stable\
    \ operation of the Internet.\n   Recognizing the need for the mid-term mechanisms\
    \ and receiving\n   support from the Internet community, the US Federal Agencies\
    \ proposed\n   procedures to assist the deployment of these mid-term mechanisms.\n\
    \   These procedures were originally described in RFC 1366 [1], which was\n  \
    \ recently made obsolete by RFC 1466 [2].  In October 1992, a schedule\n   was\
    \ proposed for the implementation of the procedures, described in\n   RFC 1367\
    \ [3].\n"
- title: 2. Milestones that have been met
  contents:
  - "2. Milestones that have been met\n   Most of the milestones of the proposed schedule\
    \ were implemented on\n   time. These milestones are shown below, essentially\
    \ as they appear in\n   [3], but with further comment where appropriate:\n   \
    \   1) 31 October 92:\n         The following address allocation procedures were\
    \ continued:\n         a) Initial set of criteria for selecting regional address\n\
    \            registries were put into place, and requests from\n            prospective\
    \ regional registries were accepted by the\n            IANA.\n            The\
    \ Reseaux IP Europeens Network Coordination Centre\n            (RIPE NCC) requested\
    \ to become a regional registry.\n            As per the addressing plan of RFC\
    \ 1366, the RIPE NCC\n            was given the block 194.0.0.0 to 195.255.255.255\
    \ to\n            administer for the European Internet community. The RIPE\n \
    \           NCC had previously and independently obtained the block\n        \
    \    193.0.0.0 to 193.255.255.255. Although this block had been\n            allocated\
    \ before RFC 1366, the RIPE NCC was able to manage\n            it according to\
    \ the guidelines in RFC 1366.\n         b) Class A network numbers were put on\
    \ reserve for possible\n            future use. The unreserved Class A numbers\
    \ became very\n            difficult to obtain.\n         c) Class B network numbers\
    \ were issued only when\n            reasonably justified.  Whenever possible,\
    \ a block of C's\n            was issued rather than a B. The requirements for\n\
    \            allocating a Class B became progressively more constrained\n    \
    \        until the date in step (3).\n         d) Class C network numbers were\
    \ allocated according to the\n            addressing plan of [1], now obsoleted\
    \ by [2].  Allocation\n            continued to be performed by the Internet Registry\
    \ (IR)\n            for regions of the world where an appropriate regional\n \
    \           registry had not yet been designated by the IANA.\n      2) 14 February\
    \ 93:\n         The schedule in [3] was re-evaluated, and there appeared to\n\
    \         be no reason to readjust it, so it was continued as\n         originally\
    \ set out.\n      3) 15 April 93:\n         a) The IR began to allocate all networks\
    \ according to the\n            addressing plan of [1], now obsoleted by [2],\
    \ in\n            appropriately sized blocks of Class C numbers.\n         b)\
    \ Class B network numbers became difficult to obtain,\n            following the\
    \ recommendation of the addressing plan and\n            were only issued when\
    \ justified.\n   Furthermore, throughout this time period, network service providers\n\
    \   have requested blocks of network numbers from the Class C address\n   space\
    \ for the purpose of further allocating them to their clients.\n   The network\
    \ service providers were allocated such space by the RIPE\n   NCC or the IR, acting\
    \ for North America and the Pacific Rim. This\n   process has started to distribute\
    \ the function of address\n   registration to a more regional level, closer to\
    \ the end users. The\n   process has operated as hoped for, with no major problems.\n"
- title: 3. Milestone that has not been met
  contents:
  - "3. Milestone that has not been met\n   The proposed schedule of [3] stated that\
    \ 6 June 1993 was the date\n   when an address aggregation mechanism would be\
    \ generally available in\n   the Internet. Although this target date was based\
    \ on the plans as\n   stated by the router vendors and was reasonable at the time\
    \ the\n   schedule in [3] was formulated, it has slipped.  Nevertheless, the\n\
    \   continuation of that schedule has so far not added significantly to\n   the\
    \ problems of the Internet. The rest of this document looks at the\n   current\
    \ situation and what can be expected in the near future.\n"
- title: 4. Current status of address aggregation mechanisms in commercial
  contents:
  - "4. Current status of address aggregation mechanisms in commercial\n   routers\n\
    \   Although RFCs 1366, 1466, and 1367 do not depend on any specific\n   address\
    \ aggregation technology, there is consensus in the Internet\n   community to\
    \ use Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) [4]. CIDR is\n   supported by BGP-4\
    \ and IDRP. Most router vendors are working on BGP-\n   4, first, and there is\
    \ a consensus to use BGP-4 to support the\n   initial deployment of CIDR in the\
    \ Internet.\n   The following paragraphs describe the implementation status and\
    \ plans\n   of software to support CIDR in various router vendors' products,\n\
    \   listed in alphabetical order.  Some speculation is necessarily\n   involved\
    \ in deriving these projections.  See also the minutes of the\n   July 1993 meeting\
    \ of the BGP Deployment Working Group of the IETF\n   [5].\n   3Com's BGP-4 code\
    \ has been tested internally. They have code that\n   accepts, forwards and manages\
    \ aggregated routes properly, and they\n   are ready to test it for interoperability\
    \ with other vendors. They\n   have yet to implement the code that forms the route\
    \ aggregates. They\n   expect to have Beta code done by September, and full release\
    \ code\n   shortly thereafter. The initial implementation will not support de-\n\
    \   aggregation.  Their plans here are not yet formulated. They will\n   support\
    \ de-aggregation if necessary.\n   ANS has a BGP-4 implementation that is being\
    \ tested internally.  It\n   is stable enough to begin testing for interoperability\
    \ with other\n   vendors' implementations.  Depending of the results of\n   interoperability\
    \ testing, this code could be deployed into the ANSNET\n   by August.  This delay\
    \ is primarily because some routers are running\n   older code, and they all need\
    \ to be upgraded to GATED before they can\n   all support BGP-4 internally. So\
    \ the ability to support CIDR looks\n   like it is about one to two months away.\
    \ This code will not support\n   controlled de-aggregation, but de-aggregation\
    \ will be supported if\n   necessary.\n   BBN plans to complete it's development\
    \ of BGP-4 by early Summer 1994.\n   Initial plans are to implement both aggregation\
    \ and controlled de-\n   aggregation with an early release of the software.\n\
    \   Cisco's BGP-4 implementation is under development at this time.\n   There\
    \ is pre-Beta code available for people to begin testing.  It is\n   expected\
    \ that the code will be stable sometime during the summer of\n   1993 and will\
    \ be made available for limited deployment at that time.\n   This BGP-4 code will\
    \ implement aggregation. It will not be part of\n   the normal release cycle at\
    \ this time.  It will be available in a\n   special software release based on\
    \ the 9.21 release. This initial\n   BGP-4 code will not implement controlled\
    \ de-aggregation, but Cisco\n   plans on implementing de-aggregation.\n   Proteon's\
    \ BGP-4 code has been tested internally. They are ready to\n   test it for interoperability\
    \ with other vendors. If this works out\n   reasonably well, then it is reasonable\
    \ to expect that they can start\n   to deploy this as Beta code by August, with\
    \ a target of full release\n   in the fall. This initial implementation will not\
    \ support aggregation\n   or de-aggregation. Aggregation will be implemented soon\
    \ thereafter,\n   but their plans for de-aggregation are not yet formulated. \
    \ They will\n   implement de-aggregation if necessary.\n   Wellfleet is aiming\
    \ at having beta code implementing BGP-4 roughly in\n   early 1994. This code\
    \ will include controlled de-aggregation.\n"
- title: 5. Rate of growth
  contents:
  - "5. Rate of growth\n   MERIT periodically publishes the number of networks in\
    \ the\n   NSFNET/ANSNET policy routing database.  Analysis of this data\n   suggests\
    \ that the number of entries in this database is growing at\n   approximately\
    \ 8% per month, or doubling every nine or ten months [6].\n   Although there are\
    \ currently over 13K networks in the NSFNET/ANSNET\n   policy routing database,\
    \ a number of them are not active. That is,\n   they are not announced to the\
    \ NSFNET/ANSNET Backbone. The 10K active\n   network point was passed in late\
    \ June. Assuming that the number of\n   active networks continues to grow at the\
    \ same rate as in the past, it\n   can be projected that the 12K active network\
    \ point will be reached\n   sometime in approximately late September 1993 and\
    \ that the 25K active\n   network point will be reached sometime in mid-94 (two\
    \ high water\n   marks whose relevance will become apparent below).\n   The NSFNET/ANSNET\
    \ routing database includes only those networks that\n   meet the NSF Acceptable\
    \ Use Policy (AUP) or the ANSNET CO+RE AUP.\n   There are a number of networks\
    \ connected to the Internet that do not\n   meet these criteria. Although they\
    \ are not in the NSFNET/ANSNET\n   routing database, they are in the forwarding\
    \ tables of a number of\n   network providers. Currently, the number of networks\
    \ that are\n   connected to other known service providers but are not in the\n\
    \   NSFNET/ANSNET routing database is significantly smaller than (less\n   than\
    \ 25% of) the number that are in the NSFNET/ANSNET database. There\n   is no estimate\
    \ available for the rate of growth of the number of such\n   non-NSFNET/ANSNET\
    \ networks. It is assumed here that the growth rate\n   of these networks is approximately\
    \ the same as that of AUP networks\n   in the NSFNET/ANSNET routing database.\n\
    \   Analysis of the more than 13K networks in the NSFNET/ANSNET routing\n   database,\
    \ as well as the allocated but unconnected networks, suggests\n   that CIDR deployment\
    \ should have a significant impact on the number\n   of forwarding table entries\
    \ that any router needs to maintain, and\n   its rate of growth.  However, an\
    \ in-depth study was begun at the July\n   1993 meeting of the BGP Deployment\
    \ Working Group of the IETF [5] to\n   (among other goals) evaluate the impact\
    \ of CIDR on the growth rate of\n   router forwarding tables.\n"
- title: 6. Capacity of deployed networks
  contents:
  - "6. Capacity of deployed networks\n   The following paragraphs describe the current\
    \ occupancy of the\n   forwarding tables of the routers of several transit network\
    \ providers\n   and their expected capacities and an estimate of the time when\
    \ that\n   capacity would be reached if the growth rate were to continue as\n\
    \   today. This list is a subset of all relevant providers, but is\n   considered\
    \ approximately representative of the situation of other\n   network providers.\
    \ It is shown in alphabetical order.\n   ALTERNET nodes are Cisco routers, and\
    \ currently carry approximately\n   11K to 12K routes, both AUP and non-AUP. With\
    \ their current\n   configuration, they have enough memory so that they are expected\
    \ to\n   support up to approximately 35K routes.  If the rate at which the\n \
    \  number of these routes is expected to grow is approximately the same\n   as\
    \ the rate that the NSFNET/ANSNET policy routing database is\n   growing, then\
    \ this number may be reached in late 1994.  However, if\n   the growth rate continues\
    \ unchecked, it is expected that the\n   processing capacity of the routers will\
    \ be surpassed before their\n   memory is exhausted. It is expected that CIDR\
    \ will be in place long\n   before this point is reached.\n   All ANSNET routers\
    \ have recently been upgraded to AIX 3.2. This\n   version supports up to 12K\
    \ networks.  These routers currently carry\n   only the active networks in the\
    \ NSFNET/ANSNET routing database.  It\n   is anticipated that the next version\
    \ of router code will be deployed\n   before September 1993, the projected date\
    \ for when there will be 12K\n   active networks.  This version will support 25K\
    \ active networks.\n   Although there are no current plans for a version of router\
    \ code that\n   supports more than 25K networks, it is believed that CIDR will\
    \ help\n   this situation.\n   EBONE nodes are Cisco routers. They currently carry\
    \ approximately 10K\n   to 11K routes. With their current configuration, they\
    \ may be able to\n   support approximately 40K routes. However, the number of\
    \ paths may be\n   very relevant. The memory required for the BGP table (rather\
    \ than the\n   forwarding table) is a function of the number of paths.  If a new\n\
    \   transatlantic link were to be added, EBONE could receive all the\n   North\
    \ American routes through it. This would add a new set of paths.\n   Each such\
    \ transatlantic link would increase the memory required by\n   approximately 20%.\
    \ Due to the network topology between North America\n   and Europe, new transatlantic\
    \ links tend to result in new paths, and\n   therefore significant memory requirements.\
    \ It is very difficult to\n   predict the addition of future transatlantic links\
    \ because they\n   result from business or political requirements, not bandwidth\n\
    \   requirements.\n   ESNET uses Cisco routers. However, it is already in trouble,\
    \ but not\n   because of the size of the forwarding tables. The problem is its\
    \ need\n   to maintain considerable configuration information describing which\n\
    \   networks it should or should not accept from its neighbors, and the\n   fact\
    \ that this information must be stored in a non-volatile memory of\n   limited\
    \ size. CIDR aggregation is expected to help this problem.\n   Also, ESNET plans\
    \ to deploy BGP-4 and CIDR only after it is in a full\n   release, so does not\
    \ plan to participate in the initial BGP-4\n   deployment. ESNET will upgrade\
    \ their nodes to Cisco CSC-4's in the\n   meantime.\n   All SPRINTLINK and ICM\
    \ nodes have recently been upgraded to Cisco\n   CSC-4 routers with 16MB of memory.\
    \ They will carry full routing,\n   including not only the routes that the NSFNET/ANSNET\
    \ carries, but\n   also routes to networks that do not comply with the NSF or\
    \ CO+RE\n   AUPs. The SPRINT routers currently carry approximately 11K to 12K\n\
    \   routes, and it is expected that they will be able to support up to\n   approximately\
    \ 25K routes, as currently configured. The 25K announced\n   network point may\
    \ be reached in approximately mid-1994. Again, it is\n   expected that CIDR deployment\
    \ will have a significant impact on this\n   growth rate, well before this time.\n"
