Abstract This document defines a new IANA registry to keep track of the values defined for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Priority" header field.
This document defines a new IANA registry to keep track of the values defined for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Priority" header field.
This header field was defined in [RFC3261], Section 20.26.
It was clearly specified in a way that allows for the creation of new values beyond those originally specified; however, no registry has been established for it.
This document adds a new sub registry, "Priority Header Field Values", to the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters" registry page.
The policy for registration of values in this registry is "IETF Review" as that term is defined by [RFC5226].
This policy was chosen over lighter weight policies due the potential architectural impact of the semantics associated with new values.
Efforts contemplating adding a Priority value should consider whether the SIP Resource  Priority [RFC4412] or even a different protocol would be more appropriate for achieving their requirements.
This document does not have any impact on the security of the SIP protocol.
Its purpose is purely administrative in nature.
