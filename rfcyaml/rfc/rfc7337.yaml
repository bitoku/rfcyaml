- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The volume of video and multimedia content delivered over\
    \ the\n   Internet is rapidly increasing and expected to continue doing so in\n\
    \   the future.  In the face of this growth, Content Delivery Networks\n   (CDNs)\
    \ provide numerous benefits: reduced delivery cost for cacheable\n   content,\
    \ improved quality of experience for end users, and increased\n   robustness of\
    \ delivery.  For these reasons, CDNs are frequently used\n   for large-scale content\
    \ delivery.  As a result of the significant\n   growth in content delivered over\
    \ IP networks, existing CDN providers\n   are scaling up their infrastructure\
    \ and many NSPs and ESPs are\n   deploying their own CDNs.  Subject to the policy\
    \ of the Content\n   Service Provider (CSP), it is generally desirable that a\
    \ given item\n   of content can be delivered to an end user regardless of that\
    \ end\n   user's location or attachment network.  This creates a need for\n  \
    \ interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so they can interoperate\n   and\
    \ collectively behave as a single delivery infrastructure.  The\n   Content Distribution\
    \ Network Interconnection (CDNI) working group has\n   been chartered to develop\
    \ an interoperable and scalable solution for\n   such CDN interconnections.\n\
    \   The CDNI Problem Statement [RFC6707] outlines the problem area that\n   the\
    \ CDNI working group is chartered to address.  The Use Cases for\n   CDNI document\
    \ [RFC6770] discusses the use cases for CDN\n   Interconnection.  The Framework\
    \ for CDN Interconnection [RFC7336]\n   discusses the technology framework for\
    \ the CDNI solution and\n   interfaces.\n   The goal of the present document is\
    \ to document the requirements for\n   the CDNI solution and interfaces.  In order\
    \ to meet the time lines\n   defined in the working group charter, the present\
    \ document\n   categorizes the CDNI requirements as \"High Priority\", \"Medium\n\
    \   Priority\", and \"Low Priority\".\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC6707].\
    \  In\n   addition, the key words \"High Priority\", \"Medium Priority\", and\
    \ \"Low\n   Priority\" in this document are to be interpreted as follows:\n  \
    \ o  \"High Priority\": When a requirement is tagged as \"{HIGH}\", it is\n  \
    \    considered by the working group as an essential function for CDNI\n     \
    \ and necessary to a deployable solution.  This requirement has to\n      be met\
    \ even if it causes a delay in the delivery by the working\n      group of a deployable\
    \ solution.\n   o  \"Medium Priority\": When a requirement is tagged as \"{MED}\"\
    , it is\n      considered by the working group as an important function for CDNI.\n\
    \      This requirement has to be met, unless it is established that\n      attempting\
    \ to meet this requirement would cause a delay in the\n      delivery by the working\
    \ group of a deployable solution.\n   o  \"Low Priority\": When a requirement\
    \ is tagged as \"{LOW}\", it is\n      considered by the working group as a useful\
    \ function for CDNI.\n      The working group will attempt to meet this requirement\
    \ as long as\n      it does not prevent meeting the \"High Priority\" and \"Medium\n\
    \      Priority\" requirements and does not cause a delay in the delivery\n  \
    \    by the working group of a deployable solution.\n"

  - "2.  CDNI Model and CDNI Interfaces\n   The \"CDNI Expanded Model and CDNI Interfaces\"\
    \ figure and brief\n   descriptions of the CDNI interfaces in [RFC7336] are replicated\
    \ below\n   for convenience.  That document contains the definitive reference\n\
    \   model and descriptions for the CDNI interfaces.\n   o  CDNI Control interface\
    \ (CI): Operations to bootstrap and\n      parameterize the other CDNI interfaces,\
    \ as well as operations to\n      pre-position, revalidate, and purge both metadata\
    \ and content.\n      The latter subset of operations is sometimes collectively\
    \ called\n      the \"Trigger interface.\"\n   o  CDNI Request Routing interface:\
    \ Operations to determine what CDN\n      (and optionally what Surrogate within\
    \ a CDN) is to serve an end\n      user's requests.  This interface is actually\
    \ a logical bundling of\n      two separate but related interfaces:\n      * \
    \ CDNI Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI):\n         Asynchronous\
    \ operations (as defined in [RFC7336]) to exchange\n         routing information\
    \ (e.g., the network footprint and\n         capabilities served by a given CDN)\
    \ that enables CDN selection\n         for subsequent user requests; and\n   \
    \   *  CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (RI): Synchronous\n        \
    \ operations (as defined in [RFC7336]) to select a delivery CDN\n         (Surrogate)\
    \ for a given user request.\n   o  CDNI Metadata interface (MI): Operations to\
    \ communicate metadata\n      that governs how the content is delivered by interconnected\
    \ CDNs.\n      Examples of CDNI Metadata include geo-blocking directives,\n  \
    \    availability windows, access control mechanisms, and purge\n      directives.\
    \  It may include a combination of:\n      *  Asynchronous operations to exchange\
    \ metadata that govern\n         subsequent user requests for content; and\n \
    \     *  Synchronous operations that govern behavior for a given user\n      \
    \   request for content.\n   o  CDNI Logging interface (LI): Operations that allow\
    \ interconnected\n      CDNs to exchange relevant activity logs.  It may include\
    \ a\n      combination of:\n      *  Real-time exchanges, suitable for runtime\
    \ traffic monitoring;\n         and\n      *  Offline exchanges, suitable for\

- title: 3.  Generic CDNI Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Generic CDNI Requirements\n   This section identifies generic requirements\
    \ independent of the\n   individual CDNI interfaces.  Some of those are expected\
    \ to affect\n   multiple or all interfaces.  Management is an important aspect\
    \ of CDN\n   operation.  The fault and performance management is covered in CDNI\n\
    \   Logging interface requirements.  The other types of management are\n   specific\
    \ to the CDN provider and not needed for interoperability\n   between CDN providers.\n\
    \   GEN-1   {MED} Wherever possible, the CDNI interfaces should reuse or\n   \
    \        leverage existing IETF protocols.\n   GEN-2   {HIGH} The CDNI solution\
    \ shall not require a change, or an\n           upgrade, to the User Agent to\
    \ benefit from content delivery\n           through interconnected CDNs.\n   GEN-3\
    \   {HIGH} The CDNI solution shall not require a change, or an\n           upgrade,\
    \ to the Content Service Provider delivering content\n           through a single\
    \ CDN, to benefit from content delivery\n           through interconnected CDNs.\n\
    \   GEN-4   {HIGH} The CDNI solution shall not depend on intra-CDN\n         \
    \  information to be exposed to other CDNs for effective and\n           efficient\
    \ delivery of the content.  Examples of intra-CDN\n           information include\
    \ Surrogate topology, Surrogate status,\n           cached content, etc.\n   GEN-5\
    \   {HIGH} The CDNI solution shall support CDN interconnection\n           when\
    \ delivery to the User Agent is based on HTTP [RFC7230].\n           (Note that\
    \ while delivery and acquisition \"data plane\"\n           protocols are out\
    \ of the CDNI solution scope, the CDNI\n           solution \"control plane\"\
    \ protocols are expected to\n           participate in enabling, selecting or\
    \ facilitating operations\n           of such acquisition and delivery protocols.\
    \  Hence, it is\n           useful to state requirements on the CDNI solution\
    \ in terms of\n           specifying which acquisition and delivery protocols\
    \ are to be\n           supported).\n   GEN-6   {HIGH} The CDNI solution shall\
    \ support acquisition across\n           CDNs based on HTTP [RFC7230].  (The note\
    \ above applies to\n           this requirement, too.)\n   GEN-7   {LOW} The CDNI\
    \ solution may support delivery to the User\n           Agent based on protocols\
    \ other than HTTP.\n   GEN-8   {LOW} The CDNI solution may support acquisition\
    \ across CDNs\n           based on protocols other than HTTP.\n   GEN-9   {MED}\
    \ The CDNI solution should support cascaded CDN\n           redirection (CDN1\
    \ redirects to CDN2 that redirects to CDN3)\n           to an arbitrary number\
    \ of levels beyond the first level.\n   GEN-10  {MED} The CDNI solution should\
    \ support an arbitrary topology\n           of interconnected CDNs (i.e., the\
    \ topology of interconnected\n           CDNs cannot be restricted to a tree,\
    \ ring, star, etc.).\n   GEN-11  {HIGH} The CDNI solution shall prevent looping\
    \ of any CDNI\n           information exchange.\n   GEN-12  {HIGH} When making\
    \ use of third-party reference, the CDNI\n           solution shall consider the\
    \ potential issues associated with\n           the use of various format of third-party\
    \ references (e.g.,\n           NAT or IPv4/IPv6 translation potentially breaking\
    \ third-party\n           references based on an IP addresses such as URI containing\n\
    \           IPv4 or IPv6 address literals, split DNS situations\n           potentially\
    \ breaking third-party references based on DNS\n           FQDNs) and wherever\
    \ possible avoid, minimize or mitigate the\n           associated risks based\
    \ on the specifics of the environments\n           where the reference is used\
    \ (e.g., likely or unlikely\n           presence of NAT in the path).  In particular,\
    \ this applies to\n           situations where the CDNI solution needs to construct\
    \ and\n           convey uniform resource identifiers for directing/redirecting\n\
    \           a content request, as well as to situations where the CDNI\n     \
    \      solution needs to pass on a third-party reference (e.g.,\n           identify\
    \ the IP address of a User Agent) in order to allow\n           another entity\
    \ to make a more informed decision (e.g., make a\n           more informed request\
    \ routing decision by attempting to\n           derive location information from\
    \ the third-party reference).\n   GEN-13  {HIGH} The CDNI solution shall support\
    \ HTTP Adaptive\n           Streaming content.\n"

  - "4.  CDNI Control Interface Requirements\n   The primary purpose of the CDNI Control\

    \ delivery of the content for the session when\n             at least one file\
    \ in the set was delivered.\n   MI-19  {MED} The CDNI Metadata interface should\
    \ support an optional\n          mechanism allowing the Upstream CDN to indicate\
    \ to the\n          Downstream CDN which CDNI Log fields are to be provided for\n\
    \          all content items, for specific sets of content items, or for\n   \
    \       specific content items delivered using HTTP.  A CDNI\n          implementation\
    \ that does not support this optional CDNI\n          Metadata Distribution interface\
    \ mechanism shall ignore this\n          log format indication and generate CDNI\
    \ Logging format for\n          HTTP Adaptive Streaming using the default set\
    \ of CDNI Logging\n          fields.  (Note: This function may be part of the\
    \ CDNI Metadata\n          interface or the CDNI Control interface.)\n   MI-20\
    \  {MED} The CDNI Metadata interface should allow the Upstream\n          CDN\

    \ all, for specific sets of, or for specific content\n          items delivered\
    \ using HTTP.  Whenever the Downstream CDN is\n          instructed by the Upstream\
    \ CDN to report the Content\n          Collection ID field in the log records,\
    \ the Downstream CDN is\n          to use the value provided through the CDNI\
    \ Metadata interface\n          for the corresponding content.  Note the Session\
    \ ID field\n          along with Content Collection ID may be used for HTTP Adaptive\n\
    \          Streaming content.\n   MI-21  {MED} The CDNI Metadata interface should\

    \ Group ID\n          value for all the related HTTP Adaptive Streaming content\n\
    \          (i.e., manifest file and chunks).  The authorization result of\n  \
    \        a content (e.g., manifest file) is transferred over to related\n    \
    \      content (e.g., chunks).\n   MI-22  {HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall\

  - "8.  CDNI Logging Interface Requirements\n   This section identifies the requirements\
    \ related to the CDNI Logging\n   interface (LI).  We observe that while the CDNI\
    \ Logging interface is\n   currently discussed as a single \"protocol\", further\
    \ analysis will\n   determine whether the corresponding requirements are to be\
    \ realized\n   over a single interface and protocol or over multiple interfaces\
    \ and\n   protocols.\n   LI-1   {HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface and architecture\
    \ shall\n          ensure reliable transfer of CDNI logging information across\n\
    \          CDNs.\n   LI-2   {HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface shall provide logging\
    \ of\n          deliveries and incomplete deliveries to User Agents performed\n\
    \          by the Downstream CDN as a result of request redirection by\n     \
    \     the Upstream CDN.\n   LI-3   {MED} In the case of cascaded CDNs, the CDNI\
    \ Logging interface\n          should allow the Downstream CDN to report to the\
    \ Upstream CDN\n          logging for deliveries and incomplete deliveries performed\
    \ by\n          the Downstream CDN itself as well as logging for deliveries\n\
    \          and incomplete deliveries performed by cascaded CDNs on behalf\n  \
    \        of the Downstream CDN.\n   LI-4   {HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface shall\
    \ support batch/offline\n          exchange of logging records.\n   LI-5   {MED}\
    \ The CDNI Logging interface should also support an\n          additional mechanism\
    \ taking into account the timing\n          constraints for some types of logging\
    \ records (e.g., near-real\n          time for monitoring and analytics applications).\n\
    \   LI-6   {HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface shall define a log file\n       \
    \   format and a set of fields to be exported for various CDNI\n          Logging\
    \ events.\n   LI-7   {HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface shall define a transport\n\
    \          mechanism to exchange CDNI Logging files.\n   LI-8   {MED} The CDNI\
    \ Logging interface should allow a CDN to query\n          another CDN for relevant\
    \ current logging records (e.g., for\n          on-demand access to real-time\
    \ logging information).\n   LI-9   {LOW} The CDNI Logging interface may support\
    \ aggregate/\n          summarized logs (e.g., total bytes delivered for a content\n\
    \          regardless of individual User Agents to which it was\n          delivered).\n\
    \   LI-10  {LOW} The CDNI Logging interface may support logging of\n         \
    \ performance data for deliveries to User Agents performed by\n          the Downstream\
    \ CDN as a result of request redirection by the\n          Upstream CDN.  Performance\
    \ data may include various traffic\n          statistics (the specific parameters\

    \ Upstream CDN to\n          indicate the nature and contents of the performance\
    \ data to be\n          reported by the Downstream CDN.\n   LI-11  {MED} The CDNI\
    \ Logging interface should support logging of\n          consumed resources (e.g.,\
    \ storage, bandwidth) to the Upstream\n          CDN for deliveries where content\
    \ is stored by the Downstream\n          CDN for delivery to User Agents.  The\

    \ Intermediate, Edge,\n          Cache) as well as the amount of storage (e.g.,\
    \ total GB, GB\n          used, per time period, per content domain) all of which\
    \ may\n          impact the cost of the services.\n   LI-12  {MED} In the case\
    \ of cascaded CDNs, the CDNI Logging interface\n          should support the Downstream\
    \ CDN to report consumed resources\n          (e.g.  storage, bandwidth) to the\
    \ Upstream CDN where content\n          is stored by the Downstream CDN itself\

    \ performed by\n          cascaded CDNs on behalf of the Downstream CDN.\n   LI-13\
    \  {HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface shall support logging of\n          deleted\
    \ objects from the Downstream CDN to the Upstream CDN as\n          a result of\
    \ explicit delete requests on via the CDNI Control\n          interface from the\
    \ Upstream CDN.\n   LI-14  {HIGH} The CDNI Logging interface shall support the\
    \ exchange\n          of extensible log file formats to support proprietary\n\
    \          information fields.  These information fields shall be agreed\n   \
    \       upon ahead of time between the corresponding CDNs.\n   LI-15  {HIGH} The\
    \ CDNI Logging interface shall allow a CDN to notify\n          another CDN about\
    \ which CDNI Logging information is available\n          for transfer and/or no\
    \ longer available (e.g., it exceeded\n          some logging retention period\
    \ or some logging retention\n          volume).\n   LI-16  {MED} The CDNI Logging\
    \ interface should support the ability\n          for the Downstream CDN to include\
    \ the Content Collection ID\n          and Session ID fields in CDNI log entries\
    \ generated for HTTP\n          Adaptive Streaming content.\n   LI-17  {MED} The\
    \ CDNI Logging interface should provide privacy\n          protection by not disclosing\
    \ information that can be used to\n          identify the user (e.g., method that\
    \ anonymizes the IP address\n          carried in the logging field).  The use\
    \ of the privacy\n          protection mechanism is optional.\n"

  - "9.  CDNI Security Requirements\n   This section identifies the requirements related\
    \ to the CDNI\n   security.  Some of these are expected to affect multiple or\
    \ all\n   protocols.\n   SEC-1  {HIGH} All the CDNI interface shall support secure\
    \ operation\n          over unsecured IP connectivity (e.g., the Internet).  This\n\
    \          includes authentication, confidentiality, integrity protection\n  \
    \        as well as protection against spoofing and replay.\n   SEC-2  {HIGH}\
    \ The CDNI solution shall provide sufficient protection\n          against denial-of-service\
    \ attacks.  This includes protection\n          against spoofed delivery requests\
    \ sent by User Agents directly\n          to a Downstream CDN attempting to appear\
    \ as if they had been\n          redirected by a given Upstream CDN when they\
    \ have not.\n   SEC-3  {MED} The CDNI solution should be able to ensure that for\
    \ any\n          given request redirected to a Downstream CDN, the Downstream\n\
    \          CDN can determine the Upstream CDN that redirected the request\n  \
    \        directly to the Downstream CDN (leading to that request being\n     \
    \     served by that CDN, or being further redirected).\n   SEC-4  {MED} The CDNI\
    \ solution should be able to ensure that for any\n          given transaction\
    \ log generated by the Downstream CDN and\n          communicated to an Upstream\
    \ CDN, the Upstream CDN can confirm\n          the transmitted log record corresponds\
    \ to a request\n          redirection by the Upstream CDN.\n   SEC-5  {LOW} The\
    \ CDNI solution may provide a mechanism allowing an\n          Upstream CDN that\
    \ has credentials to acquire content from the\n          CSP origin server (or\
    \ another CDN), to allow establishment of\n          credentials authorizing the\
    \ Downstream CDN to acquire the\n          content from the CSP origin server\
    \ (or the other CDN) (e.g.,\n          in case the content cannot be acquired\
    \ from the Upstream CDN).\n"
