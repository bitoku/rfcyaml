  title: __initial_text__
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) sends an initialization vector\n
    \  (IV) in each packet.  The size of the IV depends on the applied\n   transform
    and is usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined at\n   the time this
    document was written.  When used with IPsec, some\n   algorithms, such as AES-GCM,
    AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305, take the\n   IV to generate a nonce that is used
    as an input parameter for\n   encrypting and decrypting.  This IV must be unique
    but can be\n   predictable.  As a result, the value provided in the ESP Sequence\n
    \  Number (SN) can be used instead to generate the nonce.  This avoids\n   sending
    the IV itself and saves 8 octets per packet in the case of\n   AES-GCM, AES-CCM,
    and ChaCha20-Poly1305.  This document describes how\n   to do this.\n"

  title: Table of Contents
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Counter-based AES modes of operation such as AES-CCM [RFC4309]
    and\n   AES-GCM [RFC4106] require the specification of a nonce for each ESP\n
    \  packet.  The same applies for ChaCha20-Poly1305 [RFC7634].\n   Currently, this
    nonce is generated thanks to the initialization\n   vector (IV) provided in each
    ESP packet [RFC4303].  This practice is\n   designated in this document as \"explicit
    IV\".\n   In some contexts, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), it may be\n
    \  preferable to avoid carrying the extra bytes associated to the IV and\n   instead
    generate it locally on each peer.  The local generation of\n   the IV is designated
    in this document as \"implicit IV\".\n   The size of this IV depends on the specific
    algorithm, but all of the\n   algorithms mentioned above take an 8-octet IV.\n
    \  This document defines how to compute the IV locally when it is\n   implicit.
    \ It also specifies how peers agree with the Internet Key\n   Exchange version
    2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296] on using an implicit IV versus\n   an explicit IV.\n   This
    document limits its scope to the algorithms mentioned above.\n   Other algorithms
    with similar properties may later be defined to use\n   similar mechanisms.\n
    \  This document does not consider AES-CBC [RFC3602], as AES-CBC\n   requires
    the IV to be unpredictable.  Deriving it directly from the\n   packet counter
    as described below is insecure, as mentioned in\n   Section 6 of [RFC3602], and
    has led to real-world chosen plaintext\n   attacks such as BEAST [BEAST].\n   This
    document does not consider AES-CTR [RFC3686], as it focuses on\n   the recommended
    Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)\n   suites provided in [RFC8221].\n"

    propose implicit IV (IIV)\n   algorithms in the Transform Type 1 (Encryption Algorithm)\n
    \  Substructure of the Proposal Substructure inside the Security\n   Association
    (SA) payload in the IKEv2 Exchange.  To facilitate\n   backward compatibility
    with non-supporting peers, the initiator\n   SHOULD also include those same algorithms
    with explicit IV as\n   separate transforms.\n"
  title: 5.  IKEv2 Initiator Behavior
- contents:
  - "6.  IKEv2 Responder Behavior\n   The rules of SA payload processing require that
    the responder pick\n   its algorithms from the proposal sent by the initiator,
    thus ensuring\n   that the responder will never send an SA payload containing
    the IIV\n   transform to an initiator that did not propose it.\n"
  title: 6.  IKEv2 Responder Behavior
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Nonce generation for these algorithms has not
    been explicitly\n   defined.  It has been left to the implementation as long as
    certain\n   security requirements are met.  Typically, for AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and\n
    \  ChaCha20-Poly1305, the IV is not allowed to be repeated for one\n   particular
    key.  This document provides an explicit and normative way\n   to generate IVs.
    \ The mechanism described in this document meets the\n   IV security requirements
    of all relevant algorithms.\n   As the IV must not repeat for one SA when Counter-Mode
    ciphers are\n   used, implicit IV as described in this document MUST NOT be used
    in\n   setups with the chance that the Sequence Number overlaps for one SA.\n
    \  The sender's counter and the receiver's counter MUST be reset (by\n   establishing
    a new SA and thus a new key) prior to the transmission\n   of the 2^32nd packet
    for an SA that does not use an Extended Sequence\n   Number and prior to the transmission
    of the 2^64th packet for an SA\n   that does use an Extended Sequence Number.
    \ This prevents Sequence\n   Number overlaps for the mundane point-to-point case.
    \ Multicast as\n   described in [RFC5374], [RFC6407], and [G-IKEv2] is a prominent\n
    \  example in which many senders share one secret and thus one SA.  As\n   such,
    implicit IV may only be used with Multicast if some mechanisms\n   are employed
    that prevent the Sequence Number from overlapping for\n   one SA; otherwise, implicit
    IV MUST NOT be used with Multicast.\n   This document defines three new encryption
    transforms that use\n   implicit IV.  Unlike most encryption transforms defined
    to date,\n   which can be used for both ESP and IKEv2, these transforms are\n
    \  defined for ESP only and cannot be used in IKEv2.  The reason for\n   this
    is that IKEv2 messages don't contain a unique per-message value\n   that can be
    used for IV generation.  The Message-ID field in the\n   IKEv2 header is similar
    to the SN field in the ESP header, but recent\n   IKEv2 extensions [RFC6311] [RFC7383]
    do allow it to repeat, so there\n   is not an easy way to derive unique IV from
    IKEv2 header fields.\n"
