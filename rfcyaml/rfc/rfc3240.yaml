  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type\n\
    \   application/dicom (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine).\n   The\
    \ baseline encoding is defined by the DICOM Standards Committee in\n   \"Digital\
    \ Imaging and Communications in Medicine\".\n"

  - "1. DICOM Definition\n   Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)\
    \ specifies\n   protocols and formats for the exchange of images, time-based\n\
    \   waveforms, reports, and associated information for medical\n   applications.\n\
    \   Individual DICOM objects (such as images) may be encapulsated in\n   files\
    \ and exchanged by e-mail using the Media Type defined herein.\n   In addition,\
    \ a set of DICOM files may be described by an index file,\n   DICOMDIR, which\
    \ may accompany the files that it references.\n"

  - "2.  IANA Registration\n   MIME media type name: Application\n   MIME subtype\
    \ name: dicom\n   Required parameters:\n      \"id\" is constructed from a DICOM\
    \ File ID (see DICOM PS3.11).  The\n      total length is limited to 71 characters.\
    \  Each component is\n      limited to 8 characters.  The delimiter is a forward\
    \ slash \"/\".\n      There is never a leading delimiter (i.e., this is not a\n\
    \      traditional path from a root directory).\n      If a DICOMDIR (which provides\
    \ an index of files) is included, then\n      it will refer to other DICOM files\
    \ in the file set by use of this\n      File ID.  The File ID is not encoded within\
    \ each DICOM file.  If a\n      DICOMDIR is not present, then the \"id\" parameter\
    \ may be absent.\n      Note that the DICOMDIR will also have a Media Type of\n\
    \      application/dicom and is distinguished from other files by its ID\n   \
    \   of \"DICOMDIR\".\n      For example:\n       \"ROOTDIR/SUBDIR1/MRSCAN/A789FD07/19991024/ST00234/S00003/I00023\"\
    \n      Each component shall be character strings made of characters from\n  \
    \    a subset of the G0 repertoire of ISO 8859.  This subset consists\n      of\
    \ uppercase alphabetic characters, numeric characters and\n      underscore. \
    \ The following characters are permissable:\n      A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I,\
    \ J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V,\n      W, X, Y, Z (uppercase)\n     \
    \ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 and _ (underscore)\n   Optional parameters:\n \
    \     none\n   Encoding considerations:\n      The DICOM information is binary,\
    \ therefore the encoding used shall\n      support lossless transfer of binary\
    \ information.  Typically, the\n      Content-Transfer-Encoding would be set to\
    \ \"Base64\".\n      Multiple DICOM parts should be included as a Multipart/related\n\
    \      entity [2387].  Receiving agents shall also support multiple parts\n  \
    \    as a Multipart/mixed entity.  When multiple DICOM parts are\n      included,\
    \ one of the parts may be a DICOMDIR, in which case, all\n      the files referred\
    \ to by the DICOMDIR shall also be present.  The\n      DICOMDIR is not required\
    \ to be the first Application/dicom part\n      encoded in the message, in which\
    \ case the optional \"start\"\n      parameter should refer to the content-id\
    \ of the part containing\n      the DICOMDIR.\n      Multiple DICOM Application/dicom\
    \ parts may be included with other\n      types of parts as a Multipart/mixed\
    \ entity.\n   Security considerations:\n      Application/dicom parts contain\
    \ medical information, including\n      individual demographic information.  Accordingly,\
    \ their exchange\n      should be restricted to a secure network or within a secure\n\
    \      wrapper that protects a patient's right to confidentiality\n      according\
    \ to local and national policy.  The specific security\n      mechanisms are outside\
    \ the scope of this proposal.  Such\n      mechanisms as Secured MIME (S/MIME)\
    \ [2633] or similar might be\n      appropriate.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n\
    \      Because DICOM information is specific to the medical (imaging)\n      domain,\
    \ generic e-mail applications may not be able to interpret\n      the information.\n\
    \      The Media Type has been designed in order to allow for\n      (i)   DICOM\
    \ aware applications to interoperate,\n      (ii)  generic applications to save\
    \ the files in a form\n            recognizable as DICOM files, that a DICOM application\
    \ may\n            subsequently use.\n   Published specification:\n      The Digital\
    \ Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)\n      Standard is a standard\
    \ of the DICOM Standards Committee, published\n      by the National Electrical\
    \ Manufacturers Association (NEMA), 1300\n      N. 17th Street, Rosslyn, Virginia\
    \ 22209 USA,\n      (http://medical.nema.org).\n   Applications which use this\
    \ media:\n      Biomedical imaging applications.\n   Additional information:\n\
