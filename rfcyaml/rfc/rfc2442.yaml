  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a MIME content type suitable for tunneling\
    \ an\n   ESMTP [RFC-821, RFC-1869] transaction through any MIME-capable\n   transport.\
    \  This type can be used for a variety of purposes,\n   including:  Extending\
    \ end-to-end MIME-based security services (e.g.,\n   [RFC-1847]) to cover message\
    \ envelope information as well as message\n   content.  Making it possible to\
    \ use specific SMTP extensions such as\n   NOTARY [RFC-1891] over unextended SMTP\
    \ transport infrastructure.\n   Enabling the transfer of multiple separate messages\
    \ in a single\n   transactional unit.\n"
- title: Requirements Notation
  contents:
  - "Requirements Notation\n   This document occasionally uses terms that appear in\
    \ capital letters.\n   When the terms \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   appear capitalized, they are being used to indicate particular\n\
    \   requirements of this specification. A discussion of the meanings of\n   the\
    \ terms \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\", and \"MAY\" appears in [RFC-1123]; the\n   terms\
    \ \"MUST NOT\" and \"SHOULD NOT\" are logical extensions of this\n   usage.\n"

- title: How application/batch-SMTP is used
  contents:
  - "How application/batch-SMTP is used\n   The following diagram illustrates how\
    \ the application/batch-SMTP type\n   is intended to be used:\n              \

    \ of MIME-capable transport. Once\n   the destination is reached the object is\
    \ presented to a batch SMTP\n   processor, which converts the application/batch-SMTP\
    \ object back into\n   a conventional SMTP message transaction.\n"
- title: Generation of application/batch-SMTP material
  contents:
  - "Generation of application/batch-SMTP material\n   Application/batch-SMTP material\
    \ is generated by a specially modified\n   SMTP client operating without a corresponding\
    \ SMTP server. The client\n   simply assumes a successful response to all commands\
    \ it issues. The\n   resulting content then consists of the collected output from\
    \ the SMTP\n   client.\n"
- title: Honoring SMTP restrictions
  contents:
  - "Honoring SMTP restrictions\n   Most batch SMTP processors will be constructed\
    \ by modifying and\n   extending existing SMTP servers. As such, all of the restrictions\
    \ on\n   SMTP constructs imposed by RFC 821, RFC 1123, and RFC 1869 MUST be\n\
    \   observed. In particular, restrictions on command and data line\n   lengths,\
    \ number of recipients, and so on still exist and apply to\n   batch SMTP.\n"
- title: Use of SMTP Extensions
  contents:
  - "Use of SMTP Extensions\n   Since no SMTP server is present the client must be\
    \ prepared to make\n   certain assumptions about which SMTP extensions can be\
    \ used. The\n   generator MAY assume that ESMTP [RFC-1869] facilities are available,\n\
    \   that is, it is acceptable to use the EHLO command and additional\n   parameters\
    \ on MAIL FROM and RCPT TO.  If EHLO is used MAY assume that\n   the 8bitMIME\
    \ [RFC-1652], SIZE [RFC-1870], and NOTARY [RFC-1891]\n   extensions are available.\
    \ In particular, NOTARY SHOULD be used.  MAY\n   create private bilateral agreements\
    \ which specify the availability of\n   additional SMTP extensions. Additional\
    \ SMTP extensions MUST NOT be\n   used in the absence of such an agreement, and,\
    \ perhaps more\n   importantly, a conformant generation of application/batch-SMTP\n\
    \   objects MUST be able to produce objects restricted to use of the\n   extensions\
    \ listed above.\n   The \"required-extensions\" content type parameter MAY be\
    \ used to\n   communicate a list of the extensions actually used, specified as\
    \ a\n   comma-separated list of EHLO responses. If absent it defaults to the\n\
    \   list \"8bitMIME,SIZE,NOTARY\".  Any use by private bilateral agreement\n \
    \  of additional or different extensions MUST be noted in the\n   \"required-extensions\"\
    \ parameter.\n   Note that many SMTP extensions simply do not make sense in the\n\
    \   context of batch SMTP. For example, the pipelining extension [RFC-\n   2197]\
    \ makes no sense in the absence of a network connection.\n"
- title: Handling Multiple Messages
  contents:
  - "Handling Multiple Messages\n   Generators SHOULD attempt to minimize the number\
    \ of messages placed\n   in a single application/batch-SMTP object. Ideally a\
    \ single\n   application/batch-SMTP object will be created for each message. Note,\n\
    \   however, that some uses of application/batch-SMTP (e.g., mail\n   bagging)\
    \ may exist solely to take advantage of the multiple messages\n   in a single\
    \ container capability of batch SMTP, so requiring one\n   message per container\
    \ is not possible.\n   DISCUSSION: The SMTP protocol provides for the transfer\
    \ of a series\n   of messages over a single connection. This extends in a natural\
    \ way\n   to batch SMTP.  However, the issues in batch SMTP are somewhat\n   different.\
    \ Suppose, for example, that a batch SMTP processor receives\n   an application/batch-SMTP\
    \ object containing two messages but is\n   unable to process the second message\
    \ because of a storage allocation\n   failure. But suppose that not only does\
    \ this failure preclude\n   processing of the second message, it also precludes\
    \ recording that\n   the first message has already been processed. Subsequent\
    \ reprocessing\n   of the application/batch-SMTP could then lead to duplication\
    \ of the\n   first message.\n   This issue is not materially different from the\
    \ well-known problems\n   with SMTP synchronization that in practice often lead\
    \ to duplicated\n   messages. Since this behavior is inherent in SMTP to begin\
    \ with it is\n   not incumbent on application/batch-SMTP to completely address\
    \ the\n   issue. Nevertheless, it seems prudent for application/batch-SMTP to\n\
    \   try and not make matters even worse.\n"
- title: Transport of application/batch-SMTP objects
  contents:
  - "Transport of application/batch-SMTP objects\n   Application/batch-SMTP objects\
    \ may be transported by any transport\n   capable of preserving their MIME labelling,\
    \ e.g., HTTP or SMTP.\n   Transports MUST remain cognizant of the special nature\
    \ of\n   application/batch-SMTP. An application/batch-SMTP object contains one\n\
    \   or more \"frozen\" SMTP message transactions. SMTP message transactions\n\
    \   typically carry with them various assumptions about quality of\n   service,\
    \ e.g., that messages will either be delivered successfully or\n   a nondelivery\
    \ notification will be returned, that a nondelivery\n   notification will be returned\
    \ if delivery cannot be accomplished in a\n   timely fashion, and so on. It is\
    \ vital that the encapsulation of\n   these objects for carriage over other forms\
    \ of transport not\n   interfere with these capabilities.\n"
- title: Processing of application/batch-SMTP material
  contents:
  - "Processing of application/batch-SMTP material\n   Processing of application/batch-SMTP\
    \ material is considerably more\n   complex than generating it. As might be expected,\
    \ a modified\n   SMTP/ESMTP processor is used.  However, since it cannot return\n\
    \   information to the client, it must handle all error conditions that\n   arise\
    \ itself. In other words, a batch SMTP processor assumes both the\n   responsibilities\
    \ of a traditional SMTP server as well as part of the\n   responsibilities of\
    \ a traditional SMTP client.\n   As such, a conforming processor:  MUST check\
    \ MIME content type\n   information to insure that the material it has been presented\
    \ with is\n   labelled as application/batch-SMTP and doesn't specify any extensions\n\
    \   the processor doesn't support in the \"required-extensions\" parameter.\n\
    \   Application/batch-SMTP objects that employ an unsupported extension\n   SHOULD\
    \ be forwarded to the local postmaster for manual inspection and\n   handling.\
    \  MUST accept any syntactically valid EHLO or HELO command.\n   MUST accept any\
    \ syntactically valid MAIL FROM command. A conforming\n   processor, MAY, if it\
    \ so desires, note the unacceptability of some\n   part of a given MAIL FROM command\
    \ and use this information to\n   subsequently generate non-delivery notifications\
    \ for any or all\n   recipients.  MUST accept any syntactically valid RCPT TO\
    \ command. A\n   conforming processor SHOULD note the unacceptability of some\
    \ part of\n   a given RCPT TO command and subsequently use this information to\n\
    \   generate a non-delivery notification for this recipient in lieu of\n   actually\
    \ delivering the message.  MUST accept any of the additional\n   parameters defined\
    \ by the 8bitMIME, SIZE, and NOTARY SMTP extensions\n   on the MAIL FROM and RCPT\
    \ TO commands.  MUST accept the DATA command\n   even when no valid recipients\
    \ are present. 8bit MIME messages MUST be\n   accepted.  MUST accept the RSET\
    \ command and handle multiple messages\n   in a single application/batch-SMTP\
    \ object. Processors MUST process\n   each message in an application/batch-SMTP\
    \ object once and SHOULD take\n   whatever steps are necessary to avoid processing\
    \ a message more than\n   once. For example, if processing of an application/batch-SMTP\
    \ object\n   containing multiple messages is interrupted at an intermediate point\n\
    \   it should subsequently be restarted at the end of the last message\n   that\
    \ was completely processed.  SHOULD forward any syntactically\n   invalid application/batch-SMTP\
    \ message to the local postmaster for\n   manual inspection and handling.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   Application/batch-SMTP implements a tunneling mechanism.\
    \ In general\n   tunneling mechanisms are prone to abuse because they may provide\
    \ a\n   means of bypassing existing security restrictions. For example, an\n \
    \  application/batch-SMTP tunnel implemented over an existing SMTP\n   transport\
    \ may allow someone to bypass relay restrictions imposed to\n   block redistribution\
    \ of spam.\n   Application/batch-SMTP processors SHOULD implement access\n   restrictions\
    \ designed to limit access to the processor to authorized\n   generators only.\
    \ (Note that this facility may be provided\n   automatically if application/batch-SMTP\
    \ is being used to secure\n   message envelope information.)\n"
- title: Acknowledgements
  contents:
  - "Acknowledgements\n   The general concept of batch SMTP has been around for a\
    \ long time.\n   One particular type of batch SMTP was defined by Alan Crosswell\
    \ and\n   used on BITNET to overcome BITNET's native 8 character limit on user\n\
    \   and host names. However, this form of batch SMTP differed from the\n   current\
    \ proposal in that it envisioned having the server return the\n   status code\
    \ responses to the client. In this case the client bore the\n   burden of correlating\
    \ responses with the original SMTP dialogue after\n   the fact.\n   Unfortunately\
    \ this approach proved not to work well in practice.\n   BITNET eventually switched\
    \ to the same basic form of batch SMTP that\n   has been defined here. Unfortunately\
    \ that definition was, to the best\n   of the present authors' knowledge, never\
    \ captured in a formal\n   specification. It should also be noted that the definition\
    \ given here\n   also differs in that it takes SMTP extensions into account.\n\
    \   Einar Stefferud had previously considered the problem of carrying\n   extended\
    \ SMTP messages over unextended SMTP transports. He proposed\n   that some form\
    \ of \"double enveloping\" technology be developed to\n   address this problem.\
    \ The mechanism presented here effectively\n   implements the type of solution\
    \ he proposed.\n"
