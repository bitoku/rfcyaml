  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement\
    \ of\n   Broadband Access Performance (LMAP) or similar measurement projects.\n\
    \   The series of IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) RFCs have developed terms\n  \
    \ that are generally useful for path description (see Section 5 of\n   [RFC2330]).\
    \  There are a limited number of additional terms defined\n   in this memo.\n\
    \   The reference path (see Section 3.1 and Figure 1 of [Y.1541],\n   including\
    \ the accompanying discussion) is usually needed when\n   attempting to communicate\
    \ precisely about the components that\n   comprise the path, and is often expressed\
    \ in terms of their number\n   (hops) and geographic location.  This memo takes\
    \ the path definition\n   further by establishing a set of measurement points\
    \ along the path\n   and ascribing a unique designation to each point.  This topic\
    \ has\n   been previously developed in Section 5.1 of [RFC3432] and as part of\n\
    \   the updated framework for composition and aggregation in Section 4 of\n  \
    \ [RFC5835].  Section 4.1 of [RFC5835] defines the term \"measurement\n   point\"\
    .\n   Measurement points and the paths they inhabit are often described in\n \
    \  general terms, like \"end-to-end\", \"user-to-user\", or \"access\".  These\n\
    \   terms alone are insufficient for the scientific method, since we need\n  \
    \ to clarify issues such as: What is an end?  Where is a user located?\n   Is\
    \ the home network included?\n   As an illustrative example, consider a measurement\
    \ agent in an LMAP\n   system.  When it reports its measurement results, rather\
    \ than\n   detailing its IP address and that of its measurement peer, it may\n\
    \   prefer to describe the measured path segment abstractly (perhaps for\n   privacy\
    \ reasons), e.g., 'from a measurement agent at a home gateway\n   to a measurement\
    \ peer at a DSLAM.'  This memo provides the definition\n   for such abstract 'measurement\
    \ points' and, therefore, the portion of\n   'reference path' between them.\n\
    \   The motivation for this memo is to provide an unambiguous framework\n   to\
    \ describe measurement coverage or scope of the reference path.\n   This is an\
    \ essential part of the metadata to describe measurement\n   results.  Measurements\
    \ conducted over different path scopes are not a\n   valid basis for performance\
    \ comparisons.  We note that additional\n   measurement context information may\
    \ be necessary to support a valid\n   comparison of results.\n"

  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Purpose and Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Purpose and Scope\n   The scope of this memo is to define a reference path\
    \ for LMAP\n   activities with a sufficient level of detail to determine the\n\
    \   location of different measurement points along a path without\n   ambiguity.\
    \  These conventions are likely to be useful in other\n   measurement projects\
    \ and to describe the applicable measurement scope\n   for some metrics.\n   The\
    \ connection between the reference path and specific network\n   technologies\
    \ (with differing underlying architectures) is within the\n   scope of this memo,\
    \ and examples are provided.  Both wired and\n   wireless technologies are in\
    \ scope.\n   The purpose is to create an efficient way to describe the location\
    \ of\n   the measurement point(s) used to conduct a particular measurement so\n\
    \   that the measurement result will be adequately described in terms of\n   scope\
    \ or coverage.  This should serve many measurement uses,\n   including:\n   o\
    \  diagnostic, where the same metric would be measured on different\n      sub-paths\
    \ bounded by measurement points (see Section 4.10 of\n      [RFC5835]), for example,\
    \ to isolate the sub-path contributing the\n      majority of impairment levels\
    \ observed on a path.\n   o  comparison, where the same metric may be measured\
    \ on equivalent\n      portions of different network infrastructures, for example,\
    \ to\n      compare the performance of wired and wireless home network\n     \
    \ technologies.\n"

    \ this memo.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Reference Path
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Reference Path\n   A reference path is a serial combination of hosts, routers,\
    \ switches,\n   links, radios, and processing elements that comprise all the network\n\
    \   elements traversed by each packet in a flow between the source and\n   destination\
    \ hosts.  A reference path also indicates the various\n   boundaries present,\
    \ such as administrative boundaries.  A reference\n   path is intended to be equally\
    \ applicable to all IP and link-layer\n   networking technologies.  Therefore,\
    \ the components are generically\n   defined, but their functions should have\
    \ a clear counterpart or be\n   obviously omitted in any network architecture.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Subscriber
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Subscriber\n   A subscriber is an entity (associated with one or more users)\
    \ that is\n   engaged in a subscription with a service provider.  The subscriber\
    \ is\n   allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe to services and to register a\n\
    \   user or a list of users authorized to enjoy these services.  [Q.1741]\n  \
    \ Both the subscriber and service provider are allowed to set the\n   limits relative\
    \ to the use that associated users make of subscribed\n   services.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Dedicated Component (Links or Nodes)
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Dedicated Component (Links or Nodes)\n   All resources of a dedicated component\
    \ (typically a link or node on\n   the reference path) are allocated to serving\
    \ the traffic of an\n   individual subscriber.  Resources include transmission\
    \ time-slots,\n   queue space, processing for encapsulation and address/port\n\
    \   translation, and others.  A dedicated component can affect the\n   performance\
    \ of the reference path or the performance of any sub-path\n   where the component\
    \ is involved.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Shared Component (Links or Nodes)
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Shared Component (Links or Nodes)\n   A component on the reference path\
    \ is designated a \"shared component\"\n   when the traffic associated with multiple\
    \ subscribers is served by\n   common resources.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Resource Transition Point
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Resource Transition Point\n   This is a point between dedicated and shared\
    \ components on a\n   reference path that may be a point of significance and is\
    \ identified\n   as a transition between two types of resources.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Service Demarcation Point
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Service Demarcation Point\n   This is the point where a service managed\
    \ by the service provider\n   begins (or ends) and varies by technology.  For\
    \ example, this point\n   is usually defined as the Ethernet interface on a residential\
    \ gateway\n   or modem where the scope of a packet transfer service begins and\n\
    \   ends.  In the case of a WiFi service, this would be an air interface\n   within\
    \ the intended service boundary (e.g., walls of the coffee\n   shop).  The demarcation\
    \ point may be within an integrated endpoint\n   using an air interface (e.g.,\
    \ Long-Term Evolution User Equipment (LTE\n   UE)).  Ownership does not necessarily\
    \ affect the demarcation point; a\n   subscriber may own all equipment on their\
    \ premises, but it is likely\n   that the service provider will certify such equipment\
    \ for connection\n   to their network or that a third-party will certify standards\n\
    \   compliance.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Managed and Unmanaged Sub-paths
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Managed and Unmanaged Sub-paths\n   Service providers are responsible for\
    \ the portion of the path they\n   manage.  However, most paths involve a sub-path\
    \ that is beyond the\n   management of the subscriber's service provider.  This\
    \ means that\n   private networks, wireless networks using unlicensed frequencies,\
    \ and\n   the networks of other service providers are designated as unmanaged\n\
    \   sub-paths.  The service demarcation point always divides managed and\n   unmanaged\
    \ sub-paths.\n"

    \ 1: Reference Path\n   The following are descriptions of reference path components\
    \ that may\n   not be clear from their name alone.\n   o  Subsc.  (Subscriber)\
    \ device - This is a host that normally\n      originates and terminates communications\
    \ conducted over the IP\n      packet transfer service.\n   o  Private Net #x\
    \ - This is a network of devices owned and operated\n      by the Internet service\
    \ subscriber.  In some configurations, one\n      or more private networks and\
    \ the device that provides the service\n      demarcation point are collapsed\
    \ in a single device (ownership may\n      shift to the service provider); this\
    \ should be noted as part of\n      the path description.\n   o  Intra IP Access\
    \ - This is the first point in the access\n      architecture, beyond the service\
    \ demarcation, where a globally\n      routable IP address is exposed and used\
    \ for routing.  In\n      architectures that use tunneling, this point may be\
    \ equivalent to\n      the Globally Routable Address Gateway (GRA GW).  This point\
    \ could\n      also collapse to the device providing the service demarcation,\
    \ in\n      principle.  Only one Intra IP Access point is shown, but they can\n\
    \      be identified in any access network.\n   o  GRA GW - This is the point\
    \ of interconnection between a service\n      provider's administrative domain\
    \ and the rest of the Internet,\n      where routing will depend on the GRAs in\
    \ the IP header.\n   o  Transit GRA GW - If one or more networks intervene between\
    \ the\n      service provider's access networks of the subscriber and of the\n\
    \      destination host, then such networks are designated \"transit\" and\n \
    \     are bounded by two transit GRA GWs.\n   Use of multiple IP address families\
    \ in the measurement path must be\n   noted, as the conversions between IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6 certainly influence\n   the visibility of a GRA for each family.\n   In\
    \ the case that a private address space is used throughout an access\n   architecture,\
    \ then the Intra IP Access points must use the same\n   address space as the service\
    \ demarcation point, and the Intra IP\n   Access points must be selected such\
    \ that a test between these points\n   produces a useful assessment of access\
    \ performance (e.g., includes\n   both shared and dedicated access link infrastructure).\n"
- title: 5.  Measurement Points
  contents:
  - "5.  Measurement Points\n   A key aspect of measurement points, beyond the definition\
    \ in\n   Section 4.1 of [RFC5835], is that the innermost IP header and higher-\n\
    \   layer information must be accessible through some means.  This is\n   essential\
    \ to measure IP metrics.  There may be tunnels and/or other\n   layers that encapsulate\
    \ the innermost IP header, even adding another\n   IP header of their own.\n \
    \  In general, measurement points cannot always be located exactly where\n   desired.\
    \  However, the definition in [RFC5835] and the discussion in\n   Section 5.1\
    \ of [RFC3432] indicate that allowances can be made; for\n   example, it is nearly\
    \ ideal when there are deterministic errors that\n   can be quantified between\
    \ desired and actual measurement points.\n   The figure below illustrates the\
    \ assignment of measurement points to\n   selected components of the reference\
    \ path.\n"

    \ Point Designations\n   Each measurement point on a specific reference path MUST\
    \ be assigned\n   a unique number.  To facilitate interpretation of the results,\
    \ the\n   measuring organization (and whoever it shares results with) MUST have\n\
    \   an unambiguous understanding of what path or point was measured.  In\n   order\
    \ to achieve this, a set of numbering recommendations follow.\n   When communicating\
    \ the results of measurements, the measuring\n   organization SHOULD supply a\
    \ diagram similar to Figure 2 (with the\n   technology-specific information in\
    \ examples that follow) and MUST\n   supply it when additional measurement point\
    \ numbers have been defined\n   and used (with sufficient detail to identify measurement\
    \ locations in\n   the path).\n   Ideally, the consumer of measurement results\
    \ would know the location\n   of a measurement point on the reference path from\
    \ the measurement\n   point number alone; the recommendations below provide a\
    \ way to\n   accomplish this goal.  Although the initial numbering may be fully\n\
    \   compliant with this system, changing circumstances could, over time,\n   lead\
    \ to gaps in network numbers or non-monotonic measurement point\n   number assignments\
    \ along the path.  Such circumstances could include\n   growth, consolidation,\
    \ re-arrangement, and change of ownership of the\n   network.  These are examples\
    \ of reasonable causes for numbering\n   deviations that must be identified on\
    \ the reference path diagram, as\n   required above.\n   While the numbering of\
    \ a measurement point is in the context of a\n   particular path, for simplicity,\
    \ the measuring organization SHOULD\n   use the same numbering for a device (playing\
    \ the same role) on all\n   the measurement paths through it.  Similarly, whilst\
    \ the measurement\n   point numbering is in the context of a particular measuring\n\
    \   organization, organizations with similar technologies and\n   architectures\
    \ are encouraged to coordinate on local numbering and\n   diagrams.\n   The measurement\
    \ point numbering system, mpXnn, has two independent\n   parts:\n   1.  The X\
    \ in mpXnn indicates the network number.  The network with\n       the subscriber's\
    \ device is network 0.  The network of a different\n       organization (administrative\
    \ or ownership domains) SHOULD be\n       assigned a different number.  Each successive\
    \ network number\n       SHOULD be one greater than the previous network's number.\
    \  Two\n       circumstances make it necessary to designate X=9 in the\n     \
    \  destination host's network and X=8 for the service provider\n       network\
    \ at the destination:\n       A.  The number of transit networks is unknown.\n\
    \       B.  The number of transit networks varies over time.\n   2.  The nn in\
    \ mpXnn indicates the measurement point and is locally\n       assigned by network\
    \ X.  The following conventions are suggested:\n       A.  00 SHOULD be used for\
    \ a measurement point at the subscriber's\n           device and at the service\
    \ demarcation point or GW nearest to\n           the subscriber's device for transit\
    \ networks.\n       B.  90 SHOULD be used for a measurement point at the GW of\
    \ a\n           network (opposite from the subscriber's device or service\n  \
    \         demarcation).\n       C.  In most networks, measurement point numbers\
    \ SHOULD\n           monotonically increase from the point nearest the\n     \
    \      subscriber's device to the opposite network boundary on the\n         \
    \  path (but see item D for an exception).\n       D.  When a destination host\
    \ is part of the path, 00 SHOULD be\n           used for a measurement point at\
    \ the destination host and at\n           the destination's service demarcation\
    \ point.  Measurement\n           point numbers SHOULD monotonically increase\
    \ from the point\n           nearest the destination's host to the opposite network\n\
    \           boundary on the path ONLY in these networks.  This\n           directional\
    \ numbering reversal allows consistent 00\n           designation for end hosts\
    \ and service demarcation.\n       E.  50 MAY be used for an intermediate measurement\
    \ point of\n           significance, such as a Network Address Translator (NAT).\n\
    \       F.  20 MAY be used for a traffic aggregation point, such as a\n      \
    \     Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) within a\n          \
    \ network.\n       G.  Any other measurement points SHOULD be assigned unused\n\
    \           integers between 01 and 99.  The assignment SHOULD be stable\n   \
    \        for at least the duration of a particular measurement study\n       \
    \    and SHOULD avoid numbers that have been assigned to other\n           locations\
    \ within network X (unless the assignment is\n           considered sufficiently\
    \ stale).  Subnetworks or domains\n           within a network are useful locations\
    \ for measurement points.\n   When supplying a diagram of the reference path and\
    \ measurement\n   points, the operator of the measurement system MUST indicate\
    \ the\n   reference path, the numbers (mpXnn) of the measurement points, and\n\
    \   the technology-specific definition of any measurement point other\n   than\
    \ X00 and X90 with sufficient detail to clearly define its\n   location (similar\
    \ to the technology-specific examples in Section 6 of\n   this document).\n  \
    \ If the number of intermediate networks (between the source and\n   destination)\
    \ is not known or is unstable, then this SHOULD be\n   indicated on the diagram,\
    \ and results from measurement points within\n   those networks need to be treated\
    \ with caution.\n   Notes:\n   o  The terminology \"on-net\" and \"off-net\" is\
    \ sometimes used when\n      referring to the subscriber's Internet Service Provider\
    \ (ISP)\n      measurement coverage.  With respect to the reference path, tests\n\
    \      between mp100 and mp190 are \"on-net\".\n   o  Widely deployed broadband\
    \ Internet access measurements have used\n      pass-through devices [SK] (at\
    \ the subscriber's location) directly\n      connected to the service demarcation\
    \ point; this would be located\n      at mp100.\n   o  The networking technology\
    \ must be indicated for the measurement\n      points used, especially the interface\
    \ standard and configured\n      speed (because the measurement connectivity itself\
    \ can be a\n      limiting factor for the results).\n   o  If it can be shown\
    \ that a link connecting to a measurement point\n      has reliably deterministic\
    \ performance or negligible impairments,\n      then the remote end of the connecting\
    \ link is an equivalent point\n      for some methods of measurement (although\
    \ those methods should\n      describe this possibility in detail, it is not in\
    \ scope to provide\n      such methods here).  In any case, the presence of a\
    \ link and\n      claimed equivalent measurement point must be reported.\n   o\
    \  Some access network architectures may have an additional traffic\n      aggregation\
    \ device between mp100 and mp150.  Use of a measurement\n      point at this location\
    \ would require a local number and diagram.\n   o  A Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) deployed\
    \ in the service provider's\n      access network would be positioned between\
    \ mp100 and mp190, and\n      the egress side of the CGN may be designated mp150.\
    \  mp150 is\n      generally an intermediate measurement point in the same address\n\
    \      space as mp190.\n   o  In the case that private address space is used in\
    \ an access\n      architecture, mp100 may need to use the same address space\
    \ as its\n      \"on-net\" measurement point counterpart so that a test between\n\
    \      these points produces a useful assessment of network performance.\n   \
    \   Tests between mp000 and mp100 could use a different private\n      address\
    \ space, and when the globally routable side of a CGN is at\n      mp150, the\
    \ private address side of the CGN could be designated\n      mp149 for tests with\
    \ mp100.\n   o  Measurement points at transit GRA GWs are numbered mpX00 and\n\
    \      mpX90, where X is the lowest positive integer not already used in\n   \
    \   the path.  The GW of the first transit network is shown with point\n     \
    \ mp200 and the last transit network GW with mpX90.\n"

    \   #2) connected to a WiFi access point (Private Net #1).  The\n      subscriber\

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Specification of a reference path and identification\
    \ of measurement\n   points on the path represent agreements among interested\
    \ parties.\n   They present no threat to the implementors of this memo, or to\
    \ the\n   Internet resulting from implementation of the guidelines provided\n\
    \   here.\n   Attacks at end hosts or identified measurement points are possible.\n\
    \   However, there is no requirement to include IP addresses of hosts or\n   other\
    \ network devices in a reference path with measurement points\n   that is compliant\
    \ with this memo.  As a result, the path diagrams\n   with measurement point designation\
    \ numbers do not aid such attacks.\n   Most network operators' diagrams of reference\
    \ paths will bear a close\n   resemblance to similar diagrams in relevant standards\
    \ or other\n   publicly available documents.  However, when an operator must include\n\
    \   atypical network details in their diagram, e.g., to explain why a\n   longer\
    \ latency measurement is expected, then the diagram reveals some\n   topological\
    \ details and should be marked as confidential and shared\n   with others under\
    \ a specific agreement.\n   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement\
    \ or those\n   whose traffic is measured, there may be sensitive information\n\
    \   communicated to recipients of the network diagrams illustrating paths\n  \
    \ and measurement points described above.  We refer the reader to the\n   privacy\
    \ considerations described in the Large Scale Measurement of\n   Broadband Performance\
    \ (LMAP) Framework [LMAP-FRAMEWORK], which covers\n   active and passive measurement\
    \ techniques and supporting material on\n   measurement context.  For example,\
    \ the value of sensitive information\n   can be further diluted by summarizing\
    \ measurement results over many\n   individuals or areas served by the provider.\
    \  There is an opportunity\n   enabled by forming anonymity sets described in\
    \ [RFC6973] based on the\n   reference path and measurement points in this memo.\
    \  For example, all\n   measurements from the subscriber device can be identified\
    \ as \"mp000\",\n   instead of using the IP address or other device information.\
    \  The\n   same anonymization applies to the Internet service provider, where\n\
    \   their Internet gateway would be referred to as \"mp190\".\n"
