  - "1. Introduction\n   Facsimile (Fax) has a long tradition as a telephony application\
    \ for\n   sending a document from one terminal device to another.\n   Many mechanisms\
    \ for sending fax documents over the Internet have been\n   demonstrated and deployed\
    \ and are currently in use. The general\n   application of using the Internet\
    \ for facsimile is called \"Internet\n   Fax\".\n   This document defines a number\
    \ of terms useful for the discussion of\n   Internet Fax. In addition, it describes\
    \ the goals for Internet Fax and\n   establishes a baseline of desired functionality\
    \ against which\n   protocols for Internet Fax can be judged. It encompasses the\
    \ goals for\n   all modes of facsimile delivery, including \"real-time\", \"session\"\
    , and\n   \"store and forward\" (terms defined in Section 2 of this document).\n\
    \   1.1 Terminology used within this document\n   Within this document, different\
    \ levels of desirability for a protocol\n   for Internet Fax are indicated by\
    \ different priorities, indicated in\n   {braces}:\n      {1} there is general\
    \ agreement that this is a critical\n          characteristic of any definition\
    \ of Internet Fax.\n      {2} most believe that this is an important characteristic\n\
    \          of Internet Fax.\n      {3} there is general belief that this is a\
    \ useful feature\n          of Internet Fax, but that other factors might override;\n\
    \          a definition that does not provide this element is\n          acceptable.\n\
    \   In addition, the following terms are used:\n   \"service\"      An operational\
    \ service offered by a service provider.\n   \"application\"  A use of systems\
    \ to perform a particular function.\n   \"terminal\"     The endpoint of a communication\
    \ application.\n   \"goal\"         An objective of the standarization process.\n"

  contents:
  - "2. Definitions and Operation Modes\n   This section defines some of the basic\
    \ terms for Internet Fax.\n"
- title: 2.1 User model of fax and basic operations
  contents:
  - "2.1 User model of fax and basic operations\n   The phrase \"traditional facsimile\"\
    \ or \"G3Fax\" is used to denote\n   implementations of [T.30]. Facsimile (fax)\
    \ is a telephony application\n   for sending a document from one terminal device\
    \ to another.\n   The telephone network is often referred to as the Public Switched\n\
    \   Telephone Network (PSTN) or Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN).\n  \
    \ Communication over the telephone network is accomplished using\n   modems. \
    \ The transmission of data end-to-end is accompanied by\n   negotiation (to ensure\
    \ that the scanned data can be rendered at the\n   recipient) and confirmation\
    \ of delivery (to give the sender assurance\n   that the final data has been received\
    \ and processed.)  Over time,\n   facsimile has been extended to allow for PCs\
    \ using fax modems to send\n   and receive fax, to send data other than scanned\
    \ facsimile images. In\n   addition, there have been many extensions to the basic\
    \ image model,\n   to allow for additional compression methods and for representation\
    \ of\n   images with grey-scale and color. Other delivery extensions have\n  \
    \ included sub-addressing (additional signals after the call is\n   established\
    \ to facilitate automated routing of faxes to desktops or\n   mailboxes), and\
    \ enhanced features such as fax-back and polling.\n   Typically, the terminal\
    \ device consists of a paper input device\n   (scanner), a paper output device\
    \ (printer), with (a limited amount\n   of) processing power. Traditional facsimile\
    \ has a simple user\n   operational model; the user\n      1) inserts paper into\
    \ a device\n      2) dials a number corresponding to the destination\n      3)\
    \ presses the 'start' button on the device\n      4) the sending device connects\
    \ to the receiving device using the\n         telephone network\n      5) the\
    \ sending device scans the paper and transmits the image of\n         the paper\n\
    \      6) simultaneously, the remote device receives the transmission and\n  \
    \       prints the image on paper\n      7) upon completion of transmission and\
    \ successful processing by\n         the recipient, the sending user is notified\
    \ of success\n   Although not usually visible to the user, the operation (5) of\n\
    \   transmission consists of\n      5a) negotiation: the capabilities of the recipient\
    \ are obtained,\n          and suitable mutually available parameters for the\n\
    \          communication are selected\n      5b) scanning: creating digitized\
    \ images of pages of a document\n      5c) compression: the image data is encoded\
    \ using a data\n          compression method\n      5d) transmission: the data\
    \ is sent from one terminal to the other\n   In addition, the terminiation of\
    \ operations (5d) and (6) may be\n   characterized as consisting of:\n      6a)\
    \ completed delivery: the message has completed transmission\n      6b) completed\
    \ receipt:  the message has been accepted by the\n          recipient\n      6c)\
    \ processing and disposition: the message has been processed\n   From a protocol\
    \ perspective, the information conveyed in the\n   transmission consists of both\
    \ \"protocol\" (control information,\n   capabilities, identification) and also\
    \ \"document content\".\n   The document content consists primarily of the \"\
    document image\" plus\n   additional metadata accompanying the image. The means\
    \ by which an\n   image of a document is encoded within the fax content is the\
    \ \"image\n   data representation\".\n   When the fax has been successfully transmitted,\
    \ the sender receives a\n   \"confirmation\": an indication that the fax content\
    \ was delivered.\n   This \"confirmation\" is an internal signal and is not normally\
    \ visible\n   to the sending user, although some error messages are visible, to\n\
    \   allow a page to be retransmitted.\n"
- title: 2.2 Definition of Internet Fax
  contents:
  - "2.2 Definition of Internet Fax\n   The phrase \"Internet Fax\" is used to denote\
    \ an application which\n   supports an approximation to the user model of fax\
    \ (Section 2.1), but\n   where Internet protocols are used instead of the telephone\
    \ network\n   for (some portion of) the transmission. The exact modes and\n  \
    \ operations of traditional facsimile need not be duplicated exactly.\n"
- title: 2.3 Internet Fax Roles
  contents:
  - "2.3 Internet Fax Roles\n   Internet Fax is a document transmission mechanism\
    \ between various\n   different devices and roles. Those devices and roles might\
    \ come in a\n   wide variety of configurations. To allow for a wide variety of\n\
    \   configurations, it is useful to separate out the roles, as they may\n   be\
    \ made available separately or in combination. These roles are:\n      * Network\
    \ scanner\n        A device that can scan a paper document and transmit the scanned\n\
    \        image via the Internet\n      * Network printer\n        A device that\
    \ can accept an image transmission via the Internet\n        and print the received\
    \ document automatically\n      * Fax onramp gateway\n        A device that can\
    \ accept a facsimile telephone call and\n        automatically forward it via\
    \ the Internet\n      * Fax offramp gateway\n        A device that can accept\
    \ a transmission from the Internet and\n        forward it to a traditional fax\
    \ terminal\n   In addition, other traditional Internet applications might also\n\
    \   participate in Internet Fax, including Internet mail users, Web\n   browsers,\
    \ Internet printing hosts.\n"
- title: 2.4 Internet Fax Devices
  contents:
  - "2.4 Internet Fax Devices\n   The Internet Fax roles may be embedded in a variety\
    \ of combinations\n   and configurations within devices and larger applications.\
    \  They may\n   be combined with other elements, e.g., a traditional T.30 fax\
    \ device.\n   Many different configurations of applications and systems should\
    \ {2}\n   be able to participate in Internet Fax; the specification should not\n\
    \   unnecessarily restrict the range of devices, applications and\n   services\
    \ that can participate.\n   A device that supports Internet Fax might support\
    \ any combination of\n   the roles defined in 2.3.\n"
- title: 2.4.1 Gateway devices
  contents:
  - "2.4.1 Gateway devices\n   A traditional fax terminal has a telephone line connection\
    \ (GSTN)\n   with a fax modem used to connect over the telephone network. To\n\
    \   connect a fax terminal to the Internet requires a service which\n   offers\
    \ connections on one side to the GSTN using standard fax\n   signals, and on the\
    \ other side to the Internet. This role might be\n   performed by a \"relay\"\
    \ (e.g., transmitting T.30 signals over real-\n   time controlled TCP connections)\
    \ or a \"gateway\" (e.g., translating\n   T.30 to TIFF/email).\n   With these\
    \ applications, the role of Internet Fax is to transport the\n   fax content across\
    \ the Internet, e.g., with\n"

    \ Fax->[offramp]-GSTNFax->[fax-term]\n   A onramp and/or offramp application may\
    \ be local to a single fax\n   terminal.  For example, the gateway application\
    \ might exist within a\n   small device which has a telephone interface on one\
    \ side and a\n   network connection on the other. To the fax machine, it looks\
    \ like a\n   telephone connection, although it might shunt some or all connections\n\
    \   to Internet Fax instead (Such devices are called \"Bump-in-cord.\")\n   An\
    \ onramp or offramp application may be a local facility serving many\n   fax terminals.\
    \ For example, outgoing telephone fax calls through a\n   company telephone PBX\
    \ could be rerouted through a local onramp. An\n   internet to telephone outbound\
    \ connection could be part of a \"LAN\n   Fax\" package.\n   Onramps and offramps\
    \ may serve a wider area or broader collection of\n   users, e.g., services run\
    \ by service bureaus, offering subscription\n   services; the telephone sender\
    \ or the recipient might subscribe to\n   the service.\n   The target of an offramp\
    \ may be a \"hunt group\": a set of telephone\n   numbers, each of which have\
    \ a possibly different fax terminal\n   attached.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.2 New \"Internet Fax\" devices\n   Manufacturers may offer new devices which\
    \ support any combination of\n   the roles defined in setion 2.3. In particular,\
    \ a device resembling a\n   traditional fax terminal, built out of similar components\
    \ (scanner,\n   processor, and printer), could offer a similar functionality to\
    \ a\n   traditional facsimile terminal, but be designed to connect to the\n  \
    \ Internet rather than, or in addition to, a telephone line connection.\n   Such\
    \ devices might have a permanent Internet connection (through a\n   LAN connection)\
    \ or might have occasional connectivity through a\n   (data) modem to an Internet\
    \ Service Provider.\n"
- title: 2.4.3 Internet hosts
  contents:
  - "2.4.3 Internet hosts\n   Internet users using Internet hosts with standard application\
    \ suites\n   must {1} be able to exchange faxes with other participants in\n \
    \  Internet Fax, with minimum required enhancements to their operating\n   environment.\n\
    \   Interoperability with Internet mail users, either as Internet Fax\n   senders\
    \ or recipients, is highly desirable {2}.\n   Internet users might receive faxes\
    \ over the Internet and display them\n   on their screens, or have them automatically\
    \ printed when received.\n   Similarly, the Internet Fax messages originating\
    \ from the user might\n   be the output of a software application which would\
    \ normally print,\n   or specially constructed fax-sending software, or may be\
    \ input\n   directly from a scanner attached to the user's terminal.\n   The Internet\
    \ Fax capability might be integrated into existing\n   fax/network fax software\
    \ or email software, e.g., by the addition of\n   printer drivers that would render\
    \ the document to the appropriate\n   content-type and cause it to be delivered\
    \ using an Internet Fax\n   protocol.\n   In some cases, the user might have a\
    \ multi-function peripheral which\n   integrated a scanner and printer and which\
    \ gave operability similar\n   to that of the stand-alone fax terminal.\n"
- title: 2.4.4 Internet messaging
  contents:
  - "2.4.4 Internet messaging\n   In Internet mail, there are a number of components\
    \ that operate in\n   the infrastructure to perform additional functions beyond\
    \ mail\n   store-and-forward. Interoperability with these components is a\n  \
    \ consideration for the store and forward profile of Internet Fax.  For\n   example,\
    \ mailing list software accepts mail to a single address and\n   forwards it to\
    \ a distribution list of many users. Mail archive\n   software creates repositories\
    \ of searchable messages. Mail firewalls\n   operate at organizational boundaries\
    \ and scan incoming messages for\n   malicious or harmful mail attachments. Vacation\
    \ programs send return\n   messages to the senders of messages when the recipient\
    \ is on vacation\n   and not available to respond.\n"

- title: 2.5 Operational Modes for Internet Fax
  contents:
  - "2.5 Operational Modes for Internet Fax\n   Facsimile over the Internet can occur\
    \ in several modes.\n   \"Store and forward\" Internet Fax entails a process of\
    \ storing the\n   entire document at a staging point, prior to transmitting it\
    \ to the\n   next staging point. Store and forward can be directly between sender\n\
    \   and recipient or can have a series of intermediary staging points.\n   The\
    \ intermediate storage may involve an intermediate agent or\n   sequence of agents\
    \ in the communication.\n   \"Session\" Internet Fax is defined such that delivery\
    \ notification is\n   provided to the transmitting terminal prior to disconnection.\
    \ Unlike\n   \"store and forward\", there is an expection that direct communication,\n\
    \   negotiation, and retransmission can take place between the two\n   endpoints.\n\
    \   \"Real-time\" Internet Fax allows for two [T.30] standard facsimile\n   terminals\
    \ to engage in a document transmission in a way that all of\n   the essential\
    \ elements of the [T.30] communication protocol are\n   preserved and there is\
    \ minimal elongation of the session as compared\n   to Group 3 fax over the GSTN.\n\
    \   These modes are different in the end-user expectation of immediacy,\n   reliability,\
    \ and in the ease of total compatibility with legacy or\n   traditional facsimile\
    \ terminals; the modes may have different\n   requirements on operational infrastructure\
    \ connecting sender and\n   recipient.\n"
- title: 3. Goals for Internet Fax
  contents:
  - "3. Goals for Internet Fax\n   Facsimile over the Internet must define the mechanisms\
    \ by which a\n   document is transmitted from a sender to a recipient, and must\
    \ {1}\n   specify the following elements:\n      - Transmission protocol: what\
    \ Internet protocol(s) and extensions\n        are used?  What options are available\
    \ in that transmission?\n      - Data formats: what image data representation(s)\
    \ are used,\n        appropriate, required, within the transmission protocol?\
    \ What\n        other data representations are supported?\n      - Addressing:\
    \ How are Internet Fax recipients identified? How may\n        recipient identification\
    \ be represented in user directories? How\n        are traditional fax terminals\
    \ addressed?\n      - Capabilities: The capabilities of the sender to generate\n\
    \        different kinds of image data representations may be known to\n     \
    \   the recipient, and the capabilities, preferences, and\n        characteristics\
    \ of the recipient may be known to the sender. How\n        are the capabilities,\
    \ preferences, and characteristics of\n        senders and recipients expressed,\
    \ and communicated to each\n        other?\n      - Security: Faxes may be authenticated\
    \ as to their origin, or\n        secured to protect the privacy of the message.\
    \  How may the\n        authenticity of a fax be determined by the recipient?\
    \  How may\n        the privacy of a message be guaranteed?\n   Specific goals\
    \ for these elements are described in section 5.\n"
- title: 4. Operational Goals for Internet Fax
  contents:
  - "4. Operational Goals for Internet Fax\n   This section lists the necessary and\
    \ desirable traits of an Internet\n   Fax protocol.\n"
- title: 4.1 Functionality
  contents:
  - "4.1 Functionality\n   Traditionally, images sent between fax machines are transmitted\
    \ over\n   the global switched telephone network. An Internet Fax protocol must\n\
    \   {1} provide for a method to accomplish the most commonly used\n   features\
    \ of traditional fax using only Internet protocols. It is\n   desirable {3} for\
    \ Internet Fax to support all standard features and\n   modes of standard facsimile.\n"
- title: 4.2 Interoperability
  contents:
  - "4.2 Interoperability\n   It is essential {1} that Internet Fax support interoperability\n\
    \   between most of the devices and applications listed in section 2, and\n  \
    \ desirable {3} to support all of them. To \"support interoperability\"\n   means\
    \ that a compliant sender attempting to send to a compliant\n   recipient will\
    \ not fail because of incompatibility.\n   Overall interoperability requires {1}\
    \ interoperability for all of the\n   protocol elements: the image data representations\
    \ must be understood,\n   the transport protocol must function, it must be possible\
    \ to address\n   all manner of terminals, the security mechanism must not require\n\
    \   manual operations in devices that are intended for unattended\n   operation,\
    \ and so forth.\n   Interoperability with Internet mail user agents is a requirement\
    \ {1}\n   only for the \"store-and-forward\" facsimile, although it would be\n\
    \   useful {3} for \"session\" and \"real-time\" modes of delivery of\n   Internet\
    \ Fax.\n   The requirement for interoperability has strong implications for the\n\
    \   protocol design. Interoperability must not {1} depend on having the\n   same\
    \ kind of networking equipment at each end.\n   As with most Internet application\
    \ protocols, interoperability must\n   {1} be independent of the nature of the\
    \ networking link, whether a\n   simple IP-based LAN, an internal private IP networks,\
    \ or the public\n   Internet.  The standard for Internet Fax must {1} be \"global\"\
    : that\n   is, a single specification which does not have or require special\n\
    \   features of the transport mechanism for local operations.\n   If Internet\
    \ Fax is to use the Internet mail transport mechanisms, it\n   must {1} interoperate\
    \ consistently with the current Internet mail\n   environment, and, in particular,\
    \ with the non-terminal devices listed\n   in section 2.4.4.  If Internet Fax\
    \ messages might arrive in user's\n   mailboxes, it is required {1} that the protocol\
    \ interoperate\n   successfully with common user practices for mail messages:\
    \ storing\n   them in databases, retransmission, forwarding, creation of mail\n\
    \   digests, replay of old messages at times long after the original\n   receipt,\
    \ and replying to messages using non-fax equipment.\n   It is desirable {3} that\
    \ the Internet Fax standard support and\n   facilitate universal messaging systems\
    \ described in section 2.4.5.\n   If Internet Fax requires additions to the operational\
    \ environment\n   (services, firewall support, gateways, quality of service, protocol\n\
    \   extensions), then it is preferable {3} if those additions are useful\n   for\
    \ other applications than Fax. Features shared with other messaging\n   applications\
    \ (voice mail, short message service, paging, etc.) are\n   desirable {3}, so\
    \ as not to require different operational changes for\n   other applications.\n"
- title: 4.3 Confirmation
  contents:
  - "4.3 Confirmation\n   In almost all applications of traditional fax, it is considered\
    \ very\n   important that the user can get an assurance that the transmitted\n\
    \   data was received by a terminal at the address dialed by the user.\n   This\
    \ goal translates to the Internet environment. The 'Internet Fax'\n   application\
    \ must {1} define the mechanisms by which a sender may\n   request notification\
    \ of the completion of transmission of the\n   message, and receive a determinate\
    \ response as to whether the message\n   was delivered, not delivered, or that\
    \ no confirmation of delivery is\n   possible.\n   Originally, fax \"confirmation\"\
    \ implied that the message was received\n   and processed, e.g., delivered to\
    \ the output paper tray of the\n   recipient fax device.  In reality, this implication\
    \ was relying upon\n   a signal produced by the receiving terminal that the incoming\
    \ page\n   had been inspected and was determined to be of reasonable (or\n   unacceptable)\
    \ quality, via an unspecified algorithm.\n   In later devices which support error\

  - "4.4 Quick Delivery\n   In many cases, fax transmission is used for delivery of\
    \ documents\n   where there is a strong user requirement for timeliness, with\
    \ some\n   guarantees that if transmission begins at all, it will complete\n \
    \  quickly. For example, it is a common practice to fax documents for\n   discussion\
    \ to other participants in a telephone conference call prior\n   to the call.\n\
    \   Internet Fax should {2} allow the sender of a document to request\n   immediate\
    \ delivery, if such delivery is possible. In such cases, it\n   should {2} be\
    \ possible for the sender of a message to avoid sending\n   the message at all,\
    \ if quick delivery is not available for a\n   particular recipient.\n   It is\
    \ desirable {3} to have the protocol for requesting quick\n   delivery be the\
    \ same as, or similar to, the protocol for delayed\n   delivery, so that two separate\
    \ mechanisms are not required.\n   For real-time fax delivery, immediate delivery\
    \ is the norm, since the\n   protocol must guarantee that when the session connecting\
    \ sender to\n   recipient has terminated, the message has been delivered to the\n\
    \   ultimate recipient.\n"
- title: '4.5 Capabilities: reliable, upgrade possible'
  contents:
  - "4.5 Capabilities: reliable, upgrade possible\n   Traditionally, facsimile has\
    \ guaranteed interworking between senders\n   and recipients by having a strict\
    \ method of negotiation of the\n   capabilities between the two devices. The image\
    \ representation of\n   facsimile originally was a relatively low resolution,\
    \ but has\n   increasingly offered additional capabilities (higher resolution,\n\
    \   color) as options.\n   The use of fax has grown in an evolving world (from\
    \ 'Group 1' and\n   'Group 2', to 'Group 3' facsimile) because of two elements:\
    \ (a) a\n   useful baseline of capabilities that all terminals implemented, and\n\
    \   (b) the use of capabilities exchange to go beyond that.\n   To accommodate\
    \ current use as well as future growth, Internet Fax\n   should {2} have a simple\
    \ minimum set of required features that will\n   guarantee interoperability, as\
    \ well as a mechanism by which higher\n   capability devices can be deployed into\
    \ a network of lower capability\n   devices while ensuring interoperability. \
    \ If recipients with minimum\n   capabilities were, for example, to merely drop\
    \ non-minimum messages\n   without warning, the result would be that no non-minimum\
    \ message\n   could be sent reliably. This situation can be avoided in a variety\
    \ of\n   ways, e.g., through communication of recipient capabilities or by\n \
    \  sending multiple renditions.\n   The exchange of capabilities in Internet Fax\
    \ should {2} be robust. To\n   accomplish this, recipients should {2} be encouraged\
    \ to provide\n   capabilities, even while senders must {1} have a way to send\
    \ messages\n   to recipients whose capabilities are unknown.\n   Even minimum-capability\
    \ recipients of messages should {2} be required\n   to provide a capability indication\
    \ in some reliable way. This might\n   be accomplished by providing an entry in\
    \ a directory service, by\n   offering automatic or semi-automatic replies, or\
    \ by sending some\n   indication of in a reply to a message with multiple renditions,\
    \ or as\n   an addition to a negative acknowledgement requiring retransmission.\n\
    \   On the other hand, for reliability, senders cannot rely on capability\n  \
    \ information of recipients before transmission. That is, for\n   reliability,\
    \ senders should {2} have an operational mode which can\n   function when capabilities\
    \ are not present, even when recipients must\n   always provide capabilities.\n"

    \ should {2} allow interoperability with recipient devices\n   which have limited\
    \ buffering capabilities and cannot buffer an entire\n   fax message prior to\
    \ printing, or cannot buffer an entire set of fax\n   pages before beginning transmission\
    \ of scanned pages.\n   Different operational modes (real-time, session, store\

  - "4.7 Security: Cause No Harm, Allow for privacy\n   The widespread introduction\
    \ of Internet Fax must {1} not cause harm,\n   either to its users or to others.\
    \ For example, an automatic mechanism\n   for returning notification of delivery\
    \ or capabilities of fax\n   recipients by email must {1} not expose the users\
    \ or others to mail\n   loops, bombs, or replicated delivery. Automatic capability\

    \   sufficient precautions, might expose users to denial of service\n   attacks,\

    \  Similar considerations apply in these areas to those\n   that have been addressed\
    \ by work on electronic mail receipt\n   acknowledgements [RFC 2298].\n   Internet\
    \ Fax should {2} not, by default, release information that the\n   users consider\
