  - "1.  Introduction\n   As a step towards improving our methodologies for evaluating\n\
    \   congestion control mechanisms, in this document we discuss some of\n   the\
    \ metrics to be considered.  We also consider the relationship\n   between metrics,\
    \ e.g., the well-known trade-off between throughput\n   and delay.  This document\
    \ doesn't attempt to specify every metric\n   that a study might consider; for\
    \ example, there are domain-specific\n   metrics that researchers might consider\
    \ that are over and above the\n   metrics laid out here.\n   We consider metrics\
    \ for aggregate traffic (taking into account the\n   effect of flows on competing\
    \ traffic in the network) as well as the\n   heterogeneous goals of different\
    \ applications or transport protocols\n   (e.g., of high throughput for bulk data\
    \ transfer, and of low delay\n   for interactive voice or video).  Different transport\
    \ protocols or\n   AQM mechanisms might have goals of optimizing different sets\
    \ of\n   metrics, with one transport protocol optimized for per-flow\n   throughput\
    \ and another optimized for robustness over wireless links,\n   and with different\
    \ degrees of attention to fairness with competing\n   traffic.  We hope this document\
    \ will be used as a step in evaluating\n   proposed congestion control mechanisms\
    \ for a wide range of metrics,\n   for example, noting that Mechanism X is good\
    \ at optimizing Metric A,\n   but pays the price with poor performance for Metric\
    \ B.  The goal\n   would be to have a broad view of both the strengths and weaknesses\
    \ of\n   newly proposed congestion control mechanisms.\n   Subsequent documents\
    \ are planned to present sets of simulation and\n   testbed scenarios for the\
    \ evaluation of transport protocols and of\n   congestion control mechanisms,\
    \ based on the best current practice of\n   the research community.  These are\
    \ not intended to be complete or\n   final benchmark test suites, but simply to\
    \ be one step of many to be\n   used by researchers in evaluating congestion control\
    \ mechanisms.\n   Subsequent documents are also planned on the methodologies in\
    \ using\n   these sets of scenarios.\n   This document is a product of the Transport\
    \ Modeling Research Group\n   (TMRG), and has received detailed feedback from\
    \ many members of the\n   Research Group (RG).  As the document tries to make\
    \ clear, there is\n   not necessarily a consensus within the research community\
    \ (or the\n   IETF community, the vendor community, the operations community,\
    \ or\n   any other community) about the metrics that congestion control\n   mechanisms\
    \ should be designed to optimize, in terms of trade-offs\n   between throughput\
    \ and delay, fairness between competing flows, and\n   the like.  However, we\
    \ believe that there is a clear consensus that\n   congestion control mechanisms\
    \ should be evaluated in terms of\n   trade-offs between a range of metrics, rather\
    \ than in terms of\n   optimizing for a single metric.\n"
- title: 2.  Metrics
  contents:
  - "2.  Metrics\n   The metrics that we discuss are the following:\n   o  Throughput;\n\
    \   o  Delay;\n   o  Packet loss rates;\n   o  Response to sudden changes or to\
    \ transient events;\n   o  Minimizing oscillations in throughput or in delay;\n\
    \   o  Fairness and convergence times;\n   o  Robustness for challenging environments;\n\
    \   o  Robustness to failures and to misbehaving users;\n   o  Deployability;\n\
    \   o  Metrics for specific types of transport;\n   o  User-based metrics.\n \
    \  We consider each of these below.  Many of the metrics have\n   network-based,\
    \ flow-based, and user-based interpretations.  For\n   example, network-based\
    \ metrics can consider aggregate bandwidth and\n   aggregate drop rates, flow-based\
    \ metrics can consider end-to-end\n   transfer times for file transfers or end-to-end\
    \ delay and packet drop\n   rates for interactive traffic, and user-based metrics\
    \ can consider\n   user wait time or user satisfaction with the multimedia experience.\n\
    \   Our main goal in this document is to explain the set of metrics that\n   can\
    \ be relevant, and not to legislate on the most appropriate\n   methodology for\
    \ using each general metric.\n   For some of the metrics, such as fairness, there\
    \ is not a clear\n   agreement in the network community about the desired goals.\
    \  In these\n   cases, the document attempts to present the range of approaches.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Throughput, Delay, and Loss Rates
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Throughput, Delay, and Loss Rates\n   Because of the clear trade-offs between\
    \ throughput, delay, and loss\n   rates, it can be useful to consider these three\
    \ metrics together.\n   The trade-offs are most clear in terms of queue management\
    \ at the\n   router; is the queue configured to maximize aggregate throughput,\
    \ to\n   minimize delay and loss rates, or some compromise between the two?\n\
    \   An alternative would be to consider a separate metric such as power,\n   defined\
    \ in this context as throughput over delay, that combines\n   throughput and delay.\
    \  However, we do not propose in this document a\n   clear target in terms of\
    \ the trade-offs between throughput and delay;\n   we are simply proposing that\
    \ the evaluation of transport protocols\n   include an exploration of the competing\
    \ metrics.\n   Using flow-based metrics instead of router-based metrics, the\n\
    \   relationship between per-flow throughput, delay, and loss rates can\n   often\
    \ be given by the transport protocol itself.  For example, in\n   TCP, the sending\
    \ rate s in packets per second is given as:\n      s = 1.2/(RTT*sqrt(p)),\n  \
    \ for the round-trip time RTT and loss rate p [FF99].\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Throughput
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Throughput\n   Throughput can be measured as a router-based metric of\
    \ aggregate link\n   utilization, as a flow-based metric of per-connection transfer\
    \ times,\n   and as user-based metrics of utility functions or user wait times.\n\
    \   It is a clear goal of most congestion control mechanisms to maximize\n   throughput,\
    \ subject to application demand and to the constraints of\n   the other metrics.\n\
    \   Throughput is sometimes distinguished from goodput, where throughput\n   is\
    \ the link utilization or flow rate in bytes per second; goodput,\n   also measured\
    \ in bytes per second, is the subset of throughput\n   consisting of useful traffic.\
    \  That is, 'goodput' excludes duplicate\n   packets, packets that will be dropped\
    \ downstream, packet fragments or\n   ATM cells that are dropped at the receiver\
    \ because they can't be\n   re-assembled into complete packets, and the like.\
    \  In general, this\n   document doesn't distinguish between throughput and goodput,\
    \ and uses\n   the general term \"throughput\".\n   We note that maximizing throughput\
    \ is of concern in a wide range of\n   environments, from highly-congested networks\
    \ to under-utilized ones,\n   and from long-lived flows to very short ones.  As\
    \ an example,\n   throughput has been used as one of the metrics for evaluating\n\
    \   Quick-Start, a proposal to allow flows to start up faster than\n   slow-start,\
    \ where throughput has been evaluated in terms of the\n   transfer times for connections\
    \ with a range of transfer sizes\n   [RFC4782] [SAF06].\n   In some contexts,\
    \ it might be sufficient to consider the aggregate\n   throughput or the mean\
    \ per-flow throughput [DM06], while in other\n   contexts it might be necessary\
    \ to consider the distribution of\n   per-flow throughput.  Some researchers evaluate\
    \ transport protocols\n   in terms of maximizing the aggregate user utility, where\
    \ a user's\n   utility is generally defined as a function of the user's throughput\n\
    \   [KMT98].\n   Individual applications can have application-specific needs in\
    \ terms\n   of throughput.  For example, real-time video traffic can have highly\n\
    \   variable bandwidth demands; Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic is sensitive\n  \
    \ to the amount of bandwidth received immediately after idle periods.\n   Thus,\
    \ user metrics for throughput can be more complex than simply the\n   per-connection\
    \ transfer time.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Delay
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Delay\n   Like throughput, delay can be measured as a router-based metric\
    \ of\n   queueing delay over time, or as a flow-based metric in terms of\n   per-packet\
    \ transfer times.  Per-packet delay can also include delay\n   at the sender waiting\
    \ for the transport protocol to send the packet.\n   For reliable transfer, the\
    \ per-packet transfer time seen by the\n   application includes the possible delay\
    \ of retransmitting a lost\n   packet.\n   Users of bulk data transfer applications\
    \ might care about per-packet\n   transfer times only in so far as they affect\
    \ the per-connection\n   transfer time.  On the other end of the spectrum, for\
    \ users of\n   streaming media, per-packet delay can be a significant concern.\
    \  Note\n   that in some cases the average delay might not capture the metric\
    \ of\n   interest to the users; for example, some users might care about the\n\
    \   worst-case delay, or about the tail of the delay distribution.\n   Note that\
    \ queueing delay at a router is shared by all flows at a FIFO\n   (First-In First-Out)\
    \ queue.  Thus, the router-based queueing delay\n   induced by bulk data transfers\
    \ can be important even if the bulk data\n   transfers themselves are not concerned\
    \ with per-packet transfer\n   times.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Packet Loss Rates
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Packet Loss Rates\n   Packet loss rates can be measured as a network-based\
    \ or as a\n   flow-based metric.\n   When evaluating the effect of packet losses\
    \ or ECN marks (Explicit\n   Congestion Notification) [RFC3168] on the performance\
    \ of a congestion\n   control mechanism for an individual flow, researchers often\
    \ use both\n   the packet loss/mark rate for that connection and the congestion\n\
    \   event rate (also called the loss event rate), where a congestion\n   event\
    \ or loss event consists of one or more lost or marked packets in\n   one round-trip\
    \ time [RFC3448].\n   Some users might care about the packet loss rate only in\
    \ so far as it\n   affects per-connection transfer times, while other users might\
    \ care\n   about packet loss rates directly.  RFC 3611, RTP Control Protocol\n\
    \   Extended Reports, describes a VoIP performance-reporting standard\n   called\
    \ RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR), which\n   includes a set of\
    \ burst metrics.  In RFC 3611, a burst is defined as\n   the maximal sequence\
    \ starting and ending with a lost packet, and not\n   including a sequence of\
    \ Gmin or more packets that are not lost\n   [RFC3611].  The burst metrics in\
    \ RFC 3611 consist of the burst\n   density (the fraction of packets in bursts),\
    \ gap density (the\n   fraction of packets in the gaps between bursts), burst\
    \ duration (the\n   mean duration of bursts in seconds), and gap duration (the\
    \ mean\n   duration of gaps in seconds).  RFC 3357 derives metrics for \"loss\n\
    \   distance\" and \"loss period\", along with statistics that capture loss\n\
    \   patterns experienced by packet streams on the Internet [RFC3357].\n   In some\
    \ cases, it is useful to distinguish between packets dropped at\n   routers due\
    \ to congestion and packets lost in the network due to\n   corruption.\n   One\
    \ network-related reason to avoid high steady-state packet loss\n   rates is to\
    \ avoid congestion collapse in environments containing\n   paths with multiple\
    \ congested links.  In such environments, high\n   packet loss rates could result\
    \ in congested links wasting scarce\n   bandwidth by carrying packets that will\
    \ only be dropped downstream\n   before being delivered to the receiver [RFC2914].\
    \  We also note that\n   in some cases, the retransmit rate can be high, and the\
    \ goodput\n   correspondingly low, even with a low packet drop rate [AEO03].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Response Times and Minimizing Oscillations\n   In this section, we consider\
    \ response times and oscillations\n   together, as there are well-known trade-offs\
    \ between improving\n   response times and minimizing oscillations.  In addition,\
    \ the\n   scenarios that illustrate the dangers of poor response times are\n \
    \  often quite different from the scenarios that illustrate the dangers\n   of\
    \ unnecessary oscillations.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Response to Changes
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Response to Changes\n   One of the key concerns in the design of congestion\
    \ control\n   mechanisms has been the response times to sudden congestion in the\n\
    \   network.  On the one hand, congestion control mechanisms should\n   respond\
    \ reasonably promptly to sudden congestion from routing or\n   bandwidth changes\
    \ or from a burst of competing traffic.  At the same\n   time, congestion control\
    \ mechanisms should not respond too severely\n   to transient changes, e.g., to\
    \ a sudden increase in delay that will\n   dissipate in less than the connection's\
    \ round-trip time.\n   Congestion control mechanisms also have to contend with\
    \ sudden\n   changes in the bandwidth-delay product due to mobility.  Such\n \
    \  bandwidth-delay product changes are expected to become more frequent\n   and\
    \ to have greater impact than path changes today.  As a result of\n   both mobility\
    \ and of the heterogeneity of wireless access types\n   (802.11b,a,g, WIMAX, WCDMA,\
    \ HS-WCDMA, E-GPRS, Bluetooth, etc.), both\n   the bandwidth and the round-trip\
    \ delay can change suddenly, sometimes\n   by several orders of magnitude.\n \
    \  Evaluating the response to sudden or transient changes can be of\n   particular\
    \ concern for slowly responding congestion control\n   mechanisms such as equation-based\
    \ congestion control [RFC3448] and\n   AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative\
    \ Decrease) or for related\n   mechanisms using parameters that make them more\
    \ slowly-responding\n   than TCP [BB01] [BBFS01].\n   In addition to the responsiveness\
    \ and smoothness of aggregate\n   traffic, one can consider the trade-offs between\
    \ responsiveness,\n   smoothness, and aggressiveness for an individual connection\
    \ [FHP00]\n   [YKL01].  In this case, smoothness can be defined by the largest\n\
    \   reduction in the sending rate in one round-trip time, in a\n   deterministic\
    \ environment with a packet drop exactly every 1/p\n   packets.  The responsiveness\
    \ is defined as the number of round-trip\n   times of sustained congestion required\
    \ for the sender to halve the\n   sending rate; aggressiveness is defined as the\
    \ maximum increase in\n   the sending rate in one round-trip time, in packets\
    \ per second, in\n   the absence of congestion.  This aggressiveness can be a\
    \ function of\n   the mode of the transport protocol; for TCP, the aggressiveness\
    \ of\n   slow-start is quite different from the aggressiveness of congestion\n\
    \   avoidance mode.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Minimizing Oscillations
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Minimizing Oscillations\n   One goal is that of stability, in terms of\
    \ minimizing oscillations of\n   queueing delay or of throughput.  In practice,\
    \ stability is\n   frequently associated with rate fluctuations or variance. \
    \ Rate\n   variations can result in fluctuations in router queue size and\n  \
    \ therefore of queue overflows.  These queue overflows can cause loss\n   synchronizations\
    \ across coexisting flows and periodic\n   under-utilization of link capacity,\
    \ both of which are considered to\n   be general signs of network instability.\
    \  Thus, measuring the rate\n   variations of flows is often used to measure the\
    \ stability of\n   transport protocols.  To measure rate variations, [JWL04],\
    \ [RX05],\n   and [FHPW00] use the coefficient of variation (CoV) of per-flow\n\
    \   transmission rates, and [WCL05] suggests the use of standard\n   deviations\
    \ of per-flow rates.  Since rate variations are a function\n   of time scales,\
    \ it makes sense to measure these rate variations over\n   various time scales.\n\
    \   Measuring per-flow rate variations, however, is only one aspect of\n   transport\
    \ protocol stability.  A realistic experimental setting\n   always involves multiple\
    \ flows of the transport protocol being\n   observed, along with a significant\
    \ amount of cross traffic, with\n   rates varying over time on both the forward\
    \ and reverse paths.  As a\n   congestion control protocol must adapt its rate\
    \ to the varying rates\n   of competing traffic, just measuring the per-flow statistics\
    \ of a\n   subset of the traffic could be misleading because it measures the\n\
    \   rate fluctuations due in part to the adaptation to competing traffic\n   on\
    \ the path.  Thus, per-flow statistics are most meaningful if they\n   are accompanied\
    \ by the statistics measured at the network level.  As\n   a complementary metric\
    \ to the per-flow statistics, [HKLRX06] uses\n   measurements of the rate variations\
    \ of the aggregate flows observed\n   in bottleneck routers over various time\
    \ scales.\n   Minimizing oscillations in queueing delay or throughput has related\n\
    \   per-flow metrics of minimizing jitter in round-trip times and loss\n   rates.\n\
    \   An orthogonal goal for some congestion control mechanisms, e.g., for\n   equation-based\
    \ congestion control, is to minimize the oscillations in\n   the sending rate\
    \ for an individual connection, given an environment\n   with a fixed, steady-state\
    \ packet drop rate.  (As is well known, TCP\n   congestion control is characterized\
    \ by a pronounced oscillation in\n   the sending rate, with the sender halving\
    \ the sending rate in\n   response to congestion.)  One metric for the level of\
    \ oscillations is\n   the smoothness metric given in Section 2.2.1 above.\n  \
    \ As discussed in [FK07], the synchronization of loss events can also\n   affect\
    \ convergence times, throughput, and delay.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  Fairness and Convergence\n   Another set of metrics is that of fairness\

    \   referring to fairness between TCP and a new transport protocol).\n   Fairness\
    \ can also be considered between sessions, between users, or\n   between other\
    \ entities.\n   There are a number of different fairness measures.  These include\n\
    \   max-min fairness [HG86], proportional fairness [KMT98] [K01], the\n   fairness\

  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Metrics for Fairness between Flows\n   This section discusses fairness\
    \ metrics that consider the fairness\n   between flows, but that don't take into\
    \ account different\n   characteristics of flows (e.g., the number of links in\
    \ the path or\n   the round-trip time).  For the discussion of fairness metrics,\
    \ let\n   x_i be the throughput for the i-th connection.\n   Jain's fairness index:\
    \ The fairness index in [JCH84] is:\n      (( sum_i x_i )^2) / (n * sum_i ( (x_i)^2\
    \ )),\n   where there are n users.  This fairness index ranges from 0 to 1, and\n\
    \   it is maximum when all users receive the same allocation.  This index\n  \
    \ is k/n when k users equally share the resource, and the other n-k\n   users\
    \ receive zero allocation.\n   The product measure: The product measure:\n   \
    \   product_i x_i ,\n   the product of the throughput of the individual connections,\
    \ is also\n   used as a measure of fairness.  (In some contexts x_i is taken as\
    \ the\n   power of the i-th connection, and the product measure is referred to\n\
    \   as network power.)  The product measure is particularly sensitive to\n   segregation;\
    \ the product measure is zero if any connection receives\n   zero throughput.\
    \  In [MS91], it is shown that for a network with many\n   connections and one\
    \ shared gateway, the product measure is maximized\n   when all connections receive\
    \ the same throughput.\n   Epsilon-fairness: A rate allocation is defined as epsilon-fair\

  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Metrics for Fairness between Flows with Different Resource\n        Requirements\n\
    \   This section discusses metrics for fairness between flows with\n   different\
    \ resource requirements, that is, with different utility\n   functions, round-trip\
    \ times, or number of links on the path.  Many of\n   these metrics can be described\
    \ as solutions to utility maximization\n   problems [K01]; the total utility quantifies\
    \ both the fairness and\n   the throughput.\n   Max-min fairness: In order to\
    \ satisfy the max-min fairness criteria,\n   the smallest throughput rate must\
    \ be as large as possible.  Given\n   this condition, the next-smallest throughput\
    \ rate must be as large as\n   possible, and so on.  Thus, the max-min fairness\
    \ gives absolute\n   priority to the smallest flows.  (Max-min fairness can be\
    \ explained\n   by the progressive filling algorithm, where all flow rates start\
    \ at\n   zero, and the rates all grow at the same pace.  Each flow rate stops\n\
    \   growing only when one or more links on the path reach link capacity.)\n  \
    \ Proportional fairness: In contrast, a feasible allocation, x, is\n   defined\
    \ as proportionally fair if, for any other feasible allocation\n   x*, the aggregate\
    \ of proportional changes is zero or negative:\n      sum_i ( (x*_i - x_i)/x_i\
    \ ) <= 0.\n   \"This criterion favours smaller flows, but less emphatically than\n\
    \   max-min fairness\" [K01].  (Using the language of utility functions,\n   proportional\
    \ fairness can be achieved by using logarithmic utility\n   functions, and maximizing\
    \ the sum of the per-flow utility functions;\n   see [KMT98] for a fuller explanation.)\n\
    \   Minimum potential delay fairness: Minimum potential delay fairness\n   has\
    \ been shown to model TCP [KS03], and is a compromise between\n   max-min fairness\
    \ and proportional fairness.  An allocation, x, is\n   defined as having minimum\
    \ potential delay fairness if:\n      sum_i (1/x_i)\n   is smaller than for any\
    \ other feasible allocation.  That is, it would\n   minimize the average download\
    \ time if each flow was an equal-sized\n   file.\n   In [CRM05], Colussi, et al.\
    \ propose a new definition of TCP fairness,\n   that \"a set of TCP fair flows\
    \ do not cause more congestion than a set\n   of TCP flows would cause\", where\
    \ congestion is defined in terms of\n   queueing delay, queueing delay variation,\
    \ the congestion event rate\n   [e.g., loss event rate], and the packet loss rate.\n\
    \   Chiu and Tan in [CT06] argue for redefining the notion of fairness\n   when\
    \ studying traffic controls for inelastic traffic, proposing that\n   inelastic\
    \ flows adopt other traffic controls such as admission\n   control.\n   The usefulness\
    \ of flow-rate fairness has been challenged in [B07] by\n   Briscoe, and defended\
    \ in [FA08] by Floyd and Allman.  In [B07],\n   Briscoe argues that flow-rate\
    \ fairness should not be a desired goal,\n   and that instead \"we should judge\
    \ fairness mechanisms on how they\n   share out the 'cost' of each user's actions\
    \ on others\".  Floyd and\n   Allman in [FA08] argue that the current system based\
    \ on TCP\n   congestion control and flow-rate fairness has been useful in the\
    \ real\n   world, posing minimal demands on network and economic infrastructure\n\
    \   and enabling users to get a share of the network resources.\n"
- title: 2.3.3.  Comments on Fairness
  contents:
  - "2.3.3.  Comments on Fairness\n   Trade-offs between fairness and throughput:\
    \ The fairness measures in\n   the section above generally measure both fairness\
    \ and throughput,\n   giving different weights to each.  Potential trade-offs\
    \ between\n   fairness and throughput are also discussed by Tang, et al. in\n\
    \   [TWL06], for a framework where max-min fairness is defined as the\n   most\
    \ fair.  In particular, [TWL06] shows that in some topologies,\n   throughput\
    \ is proportional to fairness, while in other topologies,\n   throughput is inversely\
    \ proportional to fairness.\n   Fairness and the number of congested links: Some\
    \ of these fairness\n   metrics are discussed in more detail in [F91].  We note\
    \ that there is\n   not a clear consensus for the fairness goals, in particular\
    \ for\n   fairness between flows that traverse different numbers of congested\n\
    \   links [F91].  Utility maximization provides one framework for\n   describing\
    \ this trade-off in fairness.\n   Fairness and round-trip times: One goal cited\
    \ in a number of new\n   transport protocols has been that of fairness between\
    \ flows with\n   different round-trip times [KHR02] [XHR04].  We note that there\
    \ is\n   not a consensus in the networking community about the desirability of\n\
    \   this goal, or about the implications and interactions between this\n   goal\
    \ and other metrics [FJ92] (Section 3.3).  One common argument\n   against the\
    \ goal of fairness between flows with different round-trip\n   times has been\
    \ that flows with long round-trip times consume more\n   resources; this aspect\
    \ is covered by the previous paragraph.\n   Researchers have also noted the difference\
    \ between the RTT-unfairness\n   of standard TCP, and the greater RTT-unfairness\
    \ of some proposed\n   modifications to TCP [LLS05].\n   Fairness and packet size:\
    \ One fairness issue is that of the relative\n   fairness for flows with different\
    \ packet sizes.  Many file transfer\n   applications will use the maximum packet\
    \ size possible;  in contrast,\n   low-bandwidth VoIP flows are likely to send\
    \ small packets, sending a\n   new packet every 10 to 40 ms., to limit delay.\
    \  Should a small-packet\n   VoIP connection receive the same sending rate in\
    \ *bytes* per second\n   as a large-packet TCP connection in the same environment,\
    \ or should\n   it receive the same sending rate in *packets* per second?  This\n\
    \   fairness issue has been discussed in more detail in [RFC3714], with\n   [RFC4828]\
    \ also describing the ways that packet size can affect the\n   packet drop rate\
    \ experienced by a flow.\n   Convergence times: Convergence times concern the\
    \ time for convergence\n   to fairness between an existing flow and a newly starting\
    \ one, and\n   are a special concern for environments with high-bandwidth long-delay\n\
    \   flows.  Convergence times also concern the time for convergence to\n   fairness\
    \ after a sudden change such as a change in the network path,\n   the competing\
    \ cross-traffic, or the characteristics of a wireless\n   link.  As with fairness,\
    \ convergence times can matter both between\n   flows of the same protocol, and\
    \ between flows using different\n   protocols [SLFK03].  One metric used for convergence\
    \ times is the\n   delta-fair convergence time, defined as the time taken for\
    \ two flows\n   with the same round-trip time to go from shares of 100/101-th\
    \ and\n   1/101-th of the link bandwidth, to having close to fair sharing with\n\
    \   shares of (1+delta)/2 and (1-delta)/2 of the link bandwidth [BBFS01].\n  \
    \ A similar metric for convergence times measures the convergence time\n   as\
    \ the number of round-trip times for two flows to reach epsilon-\n   fairness,\
    \ when starting from a maximally-unfair state [ZKL04].\n"

  - "2.4.  Robustness for Challenging Environments\n   While congestion control mechanisms\
    \ are generally evaluated first\n   over environments with static routing in a\
    \ network of two-way\n   point-to-point links, some environments bring up more\
    \ challenging\n   problems (e.g., corrupted packets, reordering, variable bandwidth,\n\
    \   and mobility) as well as new metrics to be considered (e.g., energy\n   consumption).\n\
    \   Robustness for challenging environments: Robustness needs to be\n   explored\
    \ for paths with reordering, corruption, variable bandwidth,\n   asymmetric routing,\
    \ router configuration changes, mobility, and the\n   like [GF04].  In general,\
    \ the Internet architecture has valued\n   robustness over efficiency, e.g., when\
    \ there are trade-offs between\n   robustness and the throughput, delay, and fairness\
    \ metrics described\n   above.\n   Energy consumption: In mobile environments,\
    \ the energy consumption\n   for the mobile end-node can be a key metric that\
    \ is affected by the\n   transport protocol [TM02].\n   The goodput ratio: For\
    \ wireless networks, the goodput ratio can be a\n   useful metric, where the goodput\
    \ ratio can be defined as the useful\n   data delivered to users as a fraction\
    \ of the total amount of data\n   transmitted on the network.  A high goodput\
    \ ratio indicates an\n   efficient use of the radio spectrum and lower interference\

  contents:
  - "2.6.  Deployability\n   One metric for congestion control mechanisms is their\

    \ include\n   the ease of failure diagnosis and the overhead in terms of packet\n\
    \   header size or added complexity at end-nodes or routers.\n   One key aspect\
    \ of deployability concerns the range of deployment\n   needed for a new congestion\
    \ control mechanism.  Consider the\n   following possible deployment requirements:\n\
    \      * Only at the sender (e.g., NewReno in TCP [RFC3782]);\n      * Only at\
    \ the receiver (e.g., delayed acknowledgements in TCP);\n      * Both the sender\
    \ and receiver (e.g., Selective Acknowledgment\n        (SACK) TCP [RFC2018]);\n\
    \      * At a single router (e.g., Random Early Detection (RED) [FJ93]);\n   \
    \   * All of the routers along the end-to-end path;\n      * Both end-nodes and\
    \ all routers along the path (e.g., Explicit\n        Control Protocol (XCP) [KHR02]).\n\
    \   Some congestion control mechanisms (e.g., XCP [KHR02], Quick-Start\n   [RFC4782])\
    \ may also have deployment issues with IPsec, IP in IP,\n   MPLS, other tunnels,\
    \ or with non-router queues such as those in\n   Ethernet switches.\n   Another\
    \ deployability issue concerns the complexity of the code.  How\n   complex is\
    \ the code required to implement the mechanism in software?\n   Is floating point\
    \ math required?  How much new state must be kept to\n   implement the new mechanism,\
    \ and who holds that state, the routers or\n   the end-nodes?  We note that we\
    \ don't suggest these questions as ways\n   to reduce the deployability metric\
    \ to a single number; we suggest\n   them as issues that could be considered in\
    \ evaluating the\n   deployability of a proposed congestion control mechanism.\n"
