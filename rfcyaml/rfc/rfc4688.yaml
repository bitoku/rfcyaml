  - "1.  Introduction\n   Specification 1000D [1] (S1000D) is an international specification\n\
    \   for the procurement and production of technical publications.  The\n   current\
    \ issue of the specification has been jointly produced by the\n   Aerospace and\
    \ Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD;\n   previously AECMA, European\
    \ Association of Aerospace Industries) and\n   the Aerospace Industries Association\
    \ of America (AIA).  The\n   specification is used worldwide by a variety of commercial\
    \ and\n   government entities for the development of technical documentation.\n\
    \   The specification adopts ISO, Computer-Aided Acquisition and Life-\n   Cycle\
    \ Support (CALS), and W3C standards to promote document\n   standardization in\
    \ which information is generated in a neutral\n   format.  Compliant documentation\
    \ generated using the specification\n   can be processed on different, and often\
    \ disparate, IT systems.  It\n   is this feature, added to the concept of modularization,\
    \ that makes\n   the specification acceptable to the wider international community.\n\
    \   Portions of S1000D define a resource coding system allowing resources\n  \
    \ created under the specification to be uniquely identified in global\n   environment.\
    \  To provide for the creation of a web-based resource\n   management system,\
    \ ASD would like to assign URNs [2][3][4] to\n   resources created under the specification\
    \ in order to retain unique,\n   permanent, location-independent names for these\
    \ resources, in\n   addition to providing a framework for resolution of these\
    \ resources.\n   For more information about ASD and S1000D, see http://www.s1000d.org.\n\
    \   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.\n"

    \   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      ASD S1000D, Issue 2.2\n      Reference:\
    \ Chap 7.4.1.2, \"IETP - Resource resolution\"\n      url: http://www.s1000d.org\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      Identifier uniqueness is guaranteed\
    \ through processes outlined\n      within ASD S1000D.  All codes defined within\
    \ the specification\n      must begin with a Model Identifier (MI) that will be\
    \ registered\n      with the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) and is\
    \ never\n      to be reused.  All project-generated codes are prefixed by the\n\
    \      assigned MI and are required by the specification to be unique\n      within\
    \ the scope of the project.  Since all project codes are\n      prefixed by a\
    \ globally unique MI, and since these codes must be\n      unique within the project,\
    \ all generated identifiers will be\n      globally unique.\n   Identifier persistence\
    \ considerations:\n      Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon suitable\
    \ delegation\n      of resolution and the fact that generated identifiers are\
    \ to be\n      persistent once published.  Existing information objects can be\n\
    \      used in new projects by referencing them through their persistent\n   \
    \   identifiers.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      Identifiers are\
    \ assigned in the following manner.  Projects are\n      assigned a Model Identifier\
    \ by the NAMSA organization.  Projects\n      then generate identifiers using\
    \ the processes outlined in ASD\n      S1000D.  The codes are prefixed with the\
    \ encoding identifier and\n      possibly postfixed by the extension status identifiers.\n\
    \   Process for identifier resolution:\n      The project identified by the Model\
    \ Identifier is responsible for\n      providing a method of resource resolution.\
    \  A suggested method of\n      resolution is outlined in ASD S1000D.\n   Rules\
    \ for Lexical Equivalence:\n      All generated identifiers are to be considered\
    \ case-insensitive.\n   Conformance with URN syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      Identifiers must conform to ASD S1000D.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global.\n"
