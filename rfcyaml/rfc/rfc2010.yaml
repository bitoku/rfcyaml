  - "1 - Rationale and Scope\n   1.1. Historically, the name servers responsible for\
    \ the root (\".\")\n   zone have also been responsible for all international top-level\n\
    \   domains (iTLD's, for example: COM, EDU, INT, ARPA).  These name\n   servers\
    \ have been operated by a cadre of highly capable volunteers,\n   and their administration\
    \ has been loosely coordinated by the NIC\n   (first SRI-NIC and now InterNIC).\
    \  Ultimate responsibility for the\n   correct operation of these servers and\
    \ for the content of the DNS\n   zones they served has always rested with the\
    \ IANA.\n   1.2. As described in [Postel96], many new TLD's may be created\n \
    \  shortly.  Servers for all new and existing iTLD's will be subject to\n   the\
    \ operational requirements given in [Postel96].  The set of servers\n   for the\
    \ root (\".\")  zone is likely to become disjoint from the set of\n   servers\
    \ for any TLD or group of TLD's, including those maintained by\n   the InterNIC.\n\
    \   1.3. In spite of the similarities in operational requirements between\n  \
    \ the servers for the iTLD's and the servers for the root (\".\") zone,\n   they\
    \ are in fact different server sets with different administrators\n   and slightly\
    \ different operational requirements. It is likely that\n   many contry code tld\
    \ servers will have even more divergent\n   operational requirements. That said,\
    \ the requirements set down in\n   this document could be successfully applied\
    \ to any name server\n   (whether root, top level, or any other level), but may\
    \ be more\n   draconian than necessary for servers other than those of the root\n\
    \   (\".\") zone.\n   Disclaimer:  The selection of name server locations and\n\
    \                administrators, and the procedures for addressing\n         \
    \       noncompliance with these stated operational\n                requirements,\
    \ are outside the scope of this document.\n   Definition:  For the purpose of\
    \ this document, the term \"zone master\"\n                shall be used to designate\
    \ the administrative owner of\n                the content of a zone.  This person\
    \ is expected to have\n                final responsibility for the selection\
    \ and correct\n                operation of all of the zone's servers.  For the\
    \ root\n                (\".\") zone, this is the IANA.\n"

  - "2 - Operational Requirements\n   2.1. Name server software.  The zone master\
    \ shall initially and\n   periodically choose a name server package to run on\
    \ all of the zone's\n   servers.  It is expected that the BIND server will be\
    \ used, at least\n   initially, and that new versions or other servers will be\
    \ specified\n   from time to time.\n     Rationale:  This requirement is based\
    \ on the wide and free\n                 availability of BIND's source code, and\
    \ the active\n                 analysis and development it constantly receives\
    \ from\n                 several members of the IETF.\n   Name server software\
    \ upgrades will be specified and scheduled by the\n   zone master, and must occur\
    \ on all of a zone's servers within a\n   specified 96 hour window.\n     Rationale:\
    \  In some cases it has proven necessary to \"cold start\" a\n               \
    \  zone's servers in order to clear out oscillating bad\n                 data.\
    \  By forcing all software upgrades to happen at\n                 about the same\
    \ time, it will be possible to coordinate\n                 a software change\
    \ with a zone content change.\n   2.2. UDP checksums.  UDP checksums must be generated\
    \ when sending\n   datagrams, and verified when receiving them.\n     Rationale:\
    \  Some vendors turn off UDP checksums for performance\n                 reasons,\
    \ citing the presence of MAC-level frame checks\n                 (CRC, for example)\
    \ as \"strong enough.\"  This has been\n                 a disaster in actual\
    \ practice.\n   2.3. Dedicated host.  A name server host should have no other\n\
    \   function, and no login accounts other than for system or network\n   administrators.\
    \  No other network protocols should be served by a\n   name server host (e.g.,\
    \ SMTP, NNTP, FTP, et al).  If login is\n   permitted from other than the system\
    \ console, then the login service\n   must be by encrypted channel (e.g., Kerberized\
    \ and encrypted\n   rlogin/telnet, the secure shell (SSH), or an equivilent).\n\
    \     Rationale:  Each additional service performed by a host makes it\n     \
    \            less reliable and potentially less secure, as well as\n         \
    \        complicating fault isolation procedures.  While name\n              \
    \   service does not consume very much in the way of system\n                \
    \ resources, it is thought best that a host do a few\n                 things\
    \ well rather than many things poorly.\n   2.4. Clock synchronization.  A name\
    \ server host should synchronize\n   its clock using the NTP protocol (currnet\
    \ version) with\n   authentication.  At least two NTP servers should be used.\
    \  As an\n   exception to section 2.3 above, a name server host can be an NTP\n\
    \   server as well.\n     Rationale:  For distributed fault isolation reasons,\
    \ synchronized\n                 time stamps in system event logs are quite helpful.\n\
    \                 NTP is easily spoofed by UDP blast attacks, thus the\n     \
    \            requirement for authentication between the name server\n        \
    \         host and its NTP servers.  A name server host is\n                 allowed\
    \ to be an NTP server because it has been\n                 observed that a single\
    \ host running both name service\n                 and stratum 1 NTP is still\
    \ quite reliable and secure.\n   2.5. Network interfaces.  Name servers must send\
    \ UDP responses with\n   an IP source address (and UDP source port number) equal\
    \ to the IP\n   destination address (and UDP destination port number) of the request.\n\
    \   Also, a name server might have multiple real interfaces, but only one\n  \
    \ will be advertised in the zone's NS RRset and associated glue A RRs.\n   The\
    \ advertised address should be that of the \"best\" interface on the\n   host,\
    \ in terms of network performance and reliability to the largest\n   number of\
    \ destinations.\n     Rationale:  While not required by [RFC1035], many extant\
    \ DNS\n                 implementations require the source address and port of\n\
    \                 a reply to match the destination address and port to\n     \
    \            which the request was sent.  The number of advertised\n         \
    \        addresses is limited to one (1) so that DNS delegation\n            \
    \     responses containing this name server can be as short\n                \
    \ as possible.\n   2.6. Physical environment.  A name server host must be located\
    \ in a\n   secure space such as a locked computer room or a data center with\n\
    \   restricted access.  The power supply should be redundant, using\n   batteries,\
    \ generators or some other means to protect against utility\n   power failures.\
    \  Network connectivity should be redundant, so that a\n   single wide area line\
    \ failure cannot completely isolate the name\n   server host from the rest of\
    \ the network.\n   2.7. Network security.  The system and network administrators\
    \ should\n   educate themselves about potential threats, and stay current on CERT\n\
    \   bulletins regarding network breakins.  The system staff should\n   periodically\
    \ audit the name server host's activity logs and be able\n   to detect breakins\
    \ during or after the fact.\n   2.8. Host performance.  As of the time of this\
    \ writing, a name server\n   must be able to answer 1,200 UDP transactions per\
    \ second with less\n   than 5 milliseconds of average latency.  Because the network\
    \ is still\n   growing at a high rate, the ability to grow to 2,000 transactions\
    \ per\n   second and still support a 5 millisecond latency is highly desirable.\n\
    \   Note that this requirement affects both the host and the network\n   infrastructure\
    \ to which that host is attached.\n   2.9. Response time.  The administrators\
    \ responsible for a name server\n   will respond to e-mail trouble reports within\
    \ 24 hours.  Personnel\n   issues such as vacations and illness will cause responsibilities\
    \ to\n   be delegated and/or reassigned rather than ignored.  After hours\n  \
    \ telephone numbers must be made available to the zone master for\n   nonpublished\
    \ use in emergencies.  An escalation contact name, e-mail\n   address, and telephone\
    \ number will also be made available to the zone\n   master in the event of nonresponse\
    \ through the normal channel.\n   2.10. Zone transfer access control.  The name\
    \ server shall be\n   configured so that outbound zone transfers are permitted\
    \ only to\n   destinations on the server's local networks, and to whichever\n\
    \   networks the zone master designates for remote debugging purposes.\n     Rationale:\
    \  Zone transfers can present a significant load on a name\n                 server,\
    \ especially if several transfers are started\n                 simultaneously\
    \ against the same server.  There is no\n                 operational reason to\
    \ allow anyone outside the name\n                 server's and zone's administrators\
    \ to transfer the\n                 entire zone.\n   2.11. Zone transfer protocol.\
    \  DNS AXFR shall be used in preference\n   to FTP or any other non-DNS transfer\
    \ protocol.  DNS NOTIFY (see\n   [NOTIFY]) and DNS IXFR (see [IXFR]) shall be\
    \ supported and enabled\n   when available.\n     Rationale:  Historically, the\
    \ common implementations of DNS\n                 (a.k.a., BIND) did not support\
    \ zone transfer of the\n                 root (\".\") zone due to programming\
    \ errors.  Thus, FTP\n                 was used.  In the future, DNS implementations\
    \ which do\n                 not support zone transfer of all zones will not be\n\
    \                 considered suitable for use as root name servers.  The\n   \
    \              benefits of [IXFR] and [NOTIFY] should be obvious.\n   2.12. Recursion\
    \ shall be disabled for queries.\n     Rationale:  Recursion is a major source\
    \ of cache pollution, and can\n                 be a major drain on name server\
    \ performance.  An\n                 organization's recursive DNS needs should\
    \ be served by\n                 some other host than its root name server(s).\
    \  An\n                 exception is made for missing glue since it's possible\n\
    \                 that glue needed for some delegations will not be\n        \
    \         within or beneath any zone for which the server is\n               \
    \  authoritative.  Such glue must be fetched via\n                 recursive lookups\
    \ to other servers.\n   2.13. Outages shall be reported.  All outages, scheduled\
    \ or not,\n   shall be reported to the zone master via e-mail.  If an outage is\n\
    \   unscheduled or if an outage is scheduled less than 24 hours in\n   advance,\
    \ then an additional notification of the zone master shall be\n   made via telephone.\
    \  Extended or repeated outages may beget special\n   handling by the zone master.\n\
    \   2.14. Inverse name lookups.  The PTR RR associated with a server's\n   primary\
    \ interface address (that is, the address shown in in the\n   zone's delegation)\
    \ shall have its target specified by the zone\n   master.\n     Rationale:  Since\
    \ each organization has local control of their\n                 network's PTR\
    \ RRs, and since it is necessary for the\n                 correct operation of\
    \ some software that the forward and\n                 reverse lookups have symmetrical\
    \ results, it is left\n                 up to the zone master to select the name\
    \ for each\n                 authority server's primary address.\n"

  - "3 - Possible Selection Criteria\n   3.1. Host population.  A server's location\
    \ on the network should be\n   such that it has a low IP hop count to a high number\
    \ of end hosts.\n   Duplication of service should be avoided, such that any given\
    \ set of\n   end hosts needs to have a low IP hop count to at most one authority\n\
    \   server for any given zone.\n   3.2. Infrastructure diversity.  A server's\
    \ location on the network\n   should be such that most failures capable of isolating\
    \ it from a\n   large number of end hosts are diverse from the failures capable\
    \ of\n   similarly isolating other authority servers for the same zone(s).\n"
