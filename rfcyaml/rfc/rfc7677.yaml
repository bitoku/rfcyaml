  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document registers the SASL mechanisms SCRAM-SHA-256
    and SCRAM-\n   SHA-256-PLUS.  SHA-256 has stronger security properties than SHA-1,\n
    \  and it is expected that SCRAM mechanisms based on it will have\n   greater
    predicted longevity than the SCRAM mechanisms based on SHA-1.\n   The registration
    form for the SCRAM family of algorithms is also\n   updated from [RFC5802].\n
    \  After publication of [RFC5802], it was discovered that Transport\n   Layer
    Security (TLS) [RFC5246] does not have the expected properties\n   for the \"tls-unique\"
    channel binding to be secure [RFC7627].\n   Therefore, this document contains
    normative text that applies to both\n   the original SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS and the
    newly introduced SCRAM-SHA-\n   256-PLUS mechanism.\n"

  - "3.  SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS\n   The SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS
    SASL mechanisms are defined\n   in the same way that SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS
    are defined in\n   [RFC5802], except that the hash function for HMAC() and H()
    uses\n   SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 [RFC6234].\n   For the SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS
    SASL mechanisms, the\n   hash iteration-count announced by a server SHOULD be
    at least 4096.\n   The GSS-API mechanism OID for SCRAM-SHA-256 is 1.3.6.1.5.5.18
    (see\n   Section 5).\n   This is a simple example of a SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication
    exchange\n   when the client doesn't support channel bindings.  The username\n
    \  'user' and password 'pencil' are being used.\n   C: n,,n=user,r=rOprNGfwEbeRWgbNEkqO\n

  title: 3.  SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations from [RFC5802] still
    apply.\n   To be secure, either SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS MUST be\n
    \  used over a TLS channel that has had the session hash extension\n   [RFC7627]
    negotiated, or session resumption MUST NOT have been used.\n   See [RFC4270] and
    [RFC6194] for reasons to move from SHA-1 to a\n   strong security mechanism like
    SHA-256.\n   The strength of this mechanism is dependent in part on the hash\n
    \  iteration-count, as denoted by \"i\" in [RFC5802].  As a rule of thumb,\n   the
    hash iteration-count should be such that a modern machine will\n   take 0.1 seconds
    to perform the complete algorithm; however, this is\n   unlikely to be practical
    on mobile devices and other relatively low-\n   performance systems.  At the time
    this was written, the rule of thumb\n   gives around 15,000 iterations required;
    however, a hash iteration-\n   count of 4096 takes around 0.5 seconds on current
    mobile handsets.\n   This computational cost can be avoided by caching the ClientKey\n
    \  (assuming the Salt and hash iteration-count is stable).  Therefore,\n   the
    recommendation of this specification is that the hash iteration-\n   count SHOULD
    be at least 4096, but careful consideration ought to be\n   given to using a significantly
    higher value, particularly where\n   mobile use is less important.\n"
