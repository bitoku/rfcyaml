  - "1. Introduction\n   There are thousands of networks in the internet.  There are\
    \ tens of\n   thousands of host machines.  There are hundreds of thousands of\n\
    \   users.  It takes a great deal of effort to manage the resources and\n   protocols\
    \ which make the Internet possible.  Sites may have people\n   who get paid to\
    \ manage their hardware and software.  But the\n   infrastructure of the Internet\
    \ is managed by volunteers who spend\n   considerable portions of their valued\
    \ time to keep the people\n   connected.\n   Hundreds of people attend the three\
    \ IETF meetings each year.  They\n   represent the government, the military, research\
    \ institutions,\n   educational institutions, and vendors from all over the world.\
    \  Most\n   of them are volunteers; people who attend the meetings to learn and\n\
    \   to contribute what they know.  There are a few very special people\n   who\
    \ deserve special notice.  These are the people who sit on the IAB,\n   IESG,\
    \ and IRSG.  Not only do they spend time at the meetings, but\n   they spend additional\
    \ time to organize them.  They are the IETF's\n   interface to other standards\
    \ bodies and to the funding institutions.\n   Without them, the IETF, indeed the\
    \ whole Internet, would not be\n   possible.\n"

  - "2. Acknowledgements\n   In addition to the people who took the time to write\
    \ their\n   biographies so that I could compile them into this FYI RFC, I would\n\
    \   like to give special thanks to Joyce K. Reynolds (whose biography is\n   in\
    \ here) for her help in creating the biography request message and\n   for being\
    \ such a good sounding board for me.\n"
- title: 3. Request for Biographies
  contents:
  - "3. Request for Biographies\n   In mid-February 1991, I sent the following message\
    \ to the members of\n   the IAB, IESG and IRSG.  It is their responses to this\
    \ message that I\n   have compiled in this FYI RFC.\n      The ARPANET is 20 years\
    \ old.  The next meeting of the IETF in St.\n      Louis this coming March will\
    \ be the 20th plenary.  It is a good\n      time to credit the people who help\
    \ make the Internet possible.  I\n      am sending this request to the current\
    \ members of the IAB, the\n      IRSG, and the IESG.  At some future time, I would\
    \ like to expand\n      the number of people to be included.  For now, however,\
    \ I am\n      limiting inclusion to members of the groups listed above.\n    \
    \  I would like to ask you to submit to me your biography.  I intend\n      to\
    \ compile the bios submitted into an FYI RFC to be published\n      before the\
    \ next IETF meeting.  In order to maintain some\n      consistency, I would like\
    \ to have the bios contain three\n      paragraphs.  The first paragraph should\
    \ contain your bio, second\n      should be your school affiliation & other interests,\
    \ and the third\n      should contain your opinion of how the Internet has grown.\
    \  Of\n      course, if there is anything else you would like to say, please\n\
    \      feel free.  The object is to let the very large user community\n      know\
    \ about the people who give them what they have.\n"

  - "4. Biographies\n   The biographies are in alphabetical order.  The contents have\
    \ not\n   been edited; only the formating has been changed.\n      4.1 Philip\
    \ Almquist, IETF Internet Area Co-director\n           Philip Almquist is an independent\
    \ consultant based in San\n           Francisco.  He has worked on a variety of\
    \ projects, but is\n           perhaps best known as the network designer for\
    \ INTEROP '88\n           and INTEROP '89.\n           His career began at Carnegie-Mellon\
    \ University in 1980, where\n           he worked on compilers and operating systems.\
    \  His initial\n           introduction to networking was analyzing crash dumps\
    \ from\n           TOPS-20 systems running beta test versions of DECNET.  He\n\
    \           later became involved in early planning for CMU's transition\n   \
    \        from DECNet to TCP/IP and for network-based software support\n      \
    \     for the hundreds of PC's that CMU was then planning to\n           acquire.\n\
    \           Philip moved to Stanford University in 1983, where he played\n   \
    \        a key role in the evolution of Stanford's network from a\n          \
    \ small system built out of donated equipment by graduate\n           students\
    \ to today's production quality network which extends\n           into virtually\
    \ every corner of the University.  As Stanford's\n           first \"hostmaster\"\
    , he invented Stanford's distributed host\n           registration system and\
    \ led Stanford's deployment of the\n           Domain Name System.  He also did\
    \ substantial work on the\n           Stanford homebrew router software (now sold\
    \ commercially by\n           cisco Systems) and oversaw some early experiments\
    \ in network\n           management.\n           Also, while with Stanford, Philip\
    \ was a primary contributor\n           to BARRNet and its short-lived predecessor,\
    \ the BayBridge\n           Network.  He brought up the first BARRNet link, and\
    \ was\n           heavily involved in the day-to-day operation of BARRNet for\n\
    \           several years.\n           In 1988, Philip gave up his responsibilities\
    \ for the Stanford\n           network in order to start his consulting business.\
    \  He\n           remained with BARRNet on a part-time basis until October\n \
    \          1991, devoting himself to BARRNet planning and to chairing\n      \
    \     its technical oversight committee.\n           Philip has been an active\
    \ participant in the IETF since about\n           1987, when he became a charter\
    \ member of the IETF's Network\n           Management Working Group.  He is one\
    \ of the authors of the\n           Host Requirements specification, and served\
    \ a brief term as\n           chair of the Domain Name System Working Group. \
    \ He is\n           currently chairs of the Router Requirements Working Group.\n\
    \      4.2  Robert Braden, IAB Executive Director, IRSG Member\n           Bob\
    \ Braden joined the networking research group at ISI in\n           1986.  Since\
    \ then, he has been supported by NSF for research\n           concerning NSFnet,\
    \ and by DARPA for protocol research.  Tasks\n           have included designing\
    \ the statspy program for collecting\n           NSFnet statistics, editing the\
    \ Host Requirements RFCs, and\n           coordinating the DARPA Research Testbed\
    \ network DARTnet.  His\n           research interests generally include end-to-end\
    \ protocols,\n           especially in the transport and network (Internet) layers.\n\
    \           Braden came to ISI from UCLA, where he had worked 16 of the\n    \
    \       preceding 18 years for the campus computing center.  There he\n      \
    \     had technical responsibility for attaching the first\n           supercomputer\
    \ (IBM 360/91) to the ARPAnet, beginning in 1970.\n           Braden was active\
    \ in the ARPAnet Network Working Group,\n           contributing to the design\
    \ of the FTP protocol in particular.\n           In 1975, he began to receive\
    \ direct DARPA funding for\n           installing the 360/91 as a \"tool-bearing\
    \ host\" in the\n           National Software Works.  In 1978, he became a member\
    \ of the\n           TCP Internet Working Group and began developing a TCP/IP\n\
    \           implementation for the IBM system.  As a result, UCLA's\n        \
    \   360/91 was one of the ARPAnet host systems that replaced NCP\n           by\
    \ TCP/IP in the big changeover of January 1983.  The UCLA\n           package\
    \ of ARPAnet host software, including Braden's TCP/IP\n           code, was distributed\
    \ to other OS/MVS sites and was later\n           sold commercially.\n       \
    \    Braden spent 1981-1982 in the Computer Science Department of\n          \
    \ University College London.  At that time, he wrote the first\n           Telnet/XXX\
    \ relay system connecting the Internet with the UK\n           academic X.25 network.\
    \  In 1981, Braden was invited to join\n           the ICCB, an organization that\
    \ became the IAB, and has been\n           an IAB member ever since.  When IAB\
    \ task forces were formed\n           in 1986, he created and still chairs the\
    \ End-to-End Task\n           Force (now Research Group).\n           Braden has\
    \ been in the computer field for 40 years this year.\n           Prior to UCLA,\
    \ he worked at Stanford and at Carnegie Tech.\n           He has taught programming\
    \ and operating systems courses at\n           Carnegie Tech, Stanford, and UCLA.\
    \  He received a Bachelor of\n           Engineering Physics from Cornell in 1957,\
    \ and an MS in\n           Physics from Stanford in 1962.\n           ------------\n\
    \           Regardless of the ancient Chinese curse, living through\n        \
    \   interesting times is not always bad.\n           For me,  participation in\
    \ the development of the ARPAnet and\n           the Internet protocols has been\
    \ very exciting.  One important\n           reason it worked, I believe, is that\
    \ there were a lot of very\n           bright people all working more or less\
    \ in the same direction,\n           led by some very wise people in the funding\
    \ agency.  The\n           result was to create a community of network researchers\
    \ who\n           believed strongly that collaboration is more powerful than\n\
    \           competition among researchers.  I don't think any other model\n  \
    \         would have gotten us where we are today.  This world view\n        \
    \   persists in the IAB, and is reflected in the informal\n           structure\
    \ of the IAB, IETF, and IRTF.\n           Nevertheless, with growth and success\
    \ (plus subtle policy\n           shifts in Washington), the prevailing mode may\
    \ be shifting\n           towards competition, both commercial and academic. \
    \ To\n           develop protocols in a commercially competitive world, you\n\
    \           need elaborate committee structures and rules.  The action\n     \
    \      then shifts to the large companies, away from small companies\n       \
    \    and universities.  In an academically competitive world, you\n          \
    \ don't develop any (useful) protocols; you get 6 different\n           protocols\
    \ for the same objective, each with its research\n           paper (which is the\
    \ \"real\" output).  This results in\n           efficient production of research\
    \ papers, but it may not\n           result in the kind of intellectual consensus\
    \ necessary to\n           create good and useful communication protocols.\n \
    \          Being a member of the IAB is sometimes very frustrating.  For\n   \
    \        some years now we have been painfully aware of the scaling\n        \
    \   problems of the Internet, and since 1982 have lived through a\n          \
    \ series of mini-disasters as various limits have been\n           exceeded. \
    \ We have been saying that \"getting big\" is probably\n           a more urgent\
    \ (and perhaps more difficult) research problem\n           than \"getting fast\"\
    , but it seems difficult to persuade\n           people of the importance of launching\
    \ the kind of research\n           program we think is necessary to learn how\
    \ to deal with\n           Internet growth.\n           It is very hard to figure\
    \ out when the exponential growth is\n           likely to stop, or when, if ever,\
    \ the fundamental\n           architectural model of the Internet will be so out\
    \ of kilter\n           with reality that it will cease be useful.  Ask me again\
    \ in\n           ten years.\n      4.3  Hans-Werner Braun, IAB Member\n      \
    \     Hans-Werner Braun joined the San Diego Supercomputer Center\n          \
    \ as a Principal Scientist in January 1991. In his initial\n           major responsibility\
    \ as Co-Principal Investigator of, and\n           Executive Committee member\
    \ on the CASA gigabit network\n           research project he is working on networking\
    \ efforts beyond\n           the problems of todays computer networking infrastructure.\n\
    \           Between April 1983 and January 1991 he worked at the\n           University\
    \ of Michigan and focused on operational\n           infrastructure for the Merit\
    \ Computer Network and the\n           University of Michigan's Information Technology\
    \ Division.\n           Starting out with the networking infrastructure within\
    \ the\n           State of Michigan he started to investigate into TCP/IP\n  \
    \         protocols and became very involved in the early stages of the\n    \
    \       NSFNET networking efforts.  He was Principal Investigator on\n       \
    \    the NSFNET backbone project since the NSFNET award went to\n           Merit\
    \ in November 1987 and managed Merit's Internet\n           Engineering group.\
    \ Between April 1978 and April 1983 Hans-\n           Werner Braun worked at the\
    \ Regional Computing Center of the\n           University of Cologne in West Germany\
    \ on network engineering\n           responsibilities for the regional and local\
    \ network.\n           In March 1978 Hans-Werner Braun graduated in West Germany\
    \ and\n           holds a Diploma in Engineering with a major in Information\n\
    \           Processing. He is a member of the Association of Computing\n     \
    \      Machinery (ACM) and its Special Interest Group on\n           Communications,\
    \ the Institute of Electrical and Electronical\n           Engineers (IEEE) as\
    \ well as the IEEE Computer Society and the\n           IEEE Communications Society\
    \ and the American Association for\n           the Advancement of Science. He\
    \ was a member of the National\n           Science Foundation's Network Program\
    \ Advisory Group (NPAG)\n           and in particular its Technical Committee\
    \ (NPAG-TC) between\n           November 1986 and late 1987, at which time the\
    \ NPAG got\n           resolved. He also chaired the Technical Committee of the\n\
    \           National Science Foundation's Network Program Advisory Group\n   \
    \        (NPAG-TC) starting in February 1987. Prior to the\n           organizational\
    \ change of the JvNCnet he participated in the\n           JvNCnet Network Technical\
    \ Advisory Committee (NTAC) of the\n           John von Neumann National Supercomputer\
    \ Center. While working\n           as Principal Investigator on the NSFNET project\
    \ at Merit, he\n           chaired the NSFNET Network Technical Committee, created\
    \ to\n           aid Merit with the NSFNET project.  Hans-Werner Braun is a\n\
    \           member of the Engineering Planning Group of the Federal\n        \
    \   Networking Council (FEPG) since its beginnings in early 1989,\n          \
    \ a member of the Internet Activities Board (IAB), the Internet\n           Engineering\
    \ Task Force. He had participated in an earlier,\n           informal, version\
    \ of the Internet Engineering Steering Group\n           and the then existing\
    \ Internet Architecture Task Force. While\n           at Merit, Hans-Werner Braun\
    \ was also Principal Investigator\n           on NSF projects for the \"Implementation\
    \ and Management of\n           Improved Connectivity Between NSFNET and CA*net\"\
    \ and for\n           \"Coordinating Routing for the NSFNET,\" the latter at the\
    \ time\n           of the old 56kbps NSFNET backbone network that he was quite\n\
    \           intimately involved with.\n           ------------\n           The\
    \ growth of the Internet can be measured in many ways and I\n           can only\
    \ try to find some examples.\n           o Network number counts\n           There\
    \ were days where being \"connected to net 10\" was the\n           Greatest Thing\
    \ Ever.  A time where the Internet just\n           consisted of a few networks\
    \ centered around the ARPAnet and\n           where growing above 100 network\
    \ numbers seemed excessive.\n           Todays number of networks in the global\
    \ infrastructure\n           exceeds 2000 connected networks, and many more if\
    \ isolated\n           network islands get included.\n           o Traffic growth\n\
    \           The Internet has undergone a dramatic increase in traffic\n      \
    \     over the last few years. The NSFNET backbone can be used as\n          \
    \ an example here, where in August 1988 about 194 million\n           packets\
    \ got injected into the network, which had increased to\n           about 396\
    \ million packets per month by the end of the year,\n           to reach about\
    \ 4.8 billion packets in December 1990. January\n           1991 yielded close\
    \ to 5.9 billion packets as sent into the\n           NSFNET backbone.\n     \
    \      o Internet Engineering Task Force participation\n           The early IETF,\
    \ after it spun off the old GADS, included\n           about 20 or so people.\
    \ I remember a meeting a few people had\n           with Mike Corrigan several\
    \ years ago. Mike then chaired the\n           IETF before Phill Gross became\
    \ chair and the discussion was\n           had about permitting the \"NSFNET crowd\"\
    \ to join the IETF.\n           Mike finally agreed and the IETF started to explode\
    \ in size,\n           now including many working groups and several hundred\n\
    \           members, including vendors and phone companies.\n           o International\
    \ infrastructure\n           At some point of time the Internet was centric around\
    \ the US\n           with very little international connectivity. The\n      \
    \     international connectivity was for network research purposes,\n        \
    \   just like the US domestic component at that point of time.\n           Today's\
    \ Internet stretches to so many countries that it can\n           be considered\
    \ close to global in scope, in particular as more\n           and more international\
    \ connections to, as well as Internet\n           infrastructure within, other\
    \ countries are happening.\n           o References in trade journals\n      \
    \     Many trade journals just a year or two ago had close to no\n           mention\
    \ of the Internet. Today references to the Internet\n           appear in many\
    \ journals and press releases from a variety of\n           places.\n        \
    \   o Articles in professional papers\n           Publications like ACM SIGCOMM\
    \ show increased interest for\n           Internet related professional papers,\
    \ compared to a few years\n           ago. Also the publication rate of the Request\
    \ For Comments\n           (RFC) series is quite impressive.\n           o Congressional\
    \ and Senatorial visibility\n           A few years ago the Internet was \"just\
    \ a research project.\"\n           Today's dramatically increased visibility\
    \ in result of the\n           Internet success allows Congress as well as Senators\
    \ to play\n           lead roles in pushing the National Research and Education\n\
    \           Network (NREN) agenda forward, which is also fostered by the\n   \
    \        executive branch. In the context of the US federal government\n     \
    \      the real credit should go to DARPA, though, for starting to\n         \
    \  prototype advanced networking, leading to the Internet about\n           twenty\
    \ years ago and over time opening it up more and more to\n           the science\
    \ and research community until more operational\n           efforts were able\
    \ to move the network to a real\n           infrastructure in support of science,\
    \ research and education\n           at large. This really allowed NSF to make\
    \ NSFNET happen.\n           o Funding\n           The Internet funding initially\
    \ consisted of DARPA efforts.\n           Agencies like NSF, NASA, DOE and others\
    \ started to make major\n           contributions later. Industrial participation\
    \ helped moving\n           the network forward as well. Very major investments\
    \ have been\n           made by campuses and research institutions to create local\n\
    \           infrastructure. Operational infrastructure comes at a high\n     \
    \      cost, especially if ubiquity, robustness and high performance\n       \
    \    are required.\n           o Research and continued development\n        \
    \   The Internet has matured from a network research oriented\n           environment\
    \ to an operational infrastructure supporting\n           research, science and\
    \ education at large. However, even\n           though for many people the Internet\
    \ is an environment\n           supporting their day-to-day work, the Internet\
    \ at its current\n           level of technology is supported by a culture of\
    \ people that\n           cooperates in a largely non-competitive environment.\
    \ Many\n           times already the size of the routing tables or the amount\
    \ of\n           traffic or the insufficiency of routing exchange protocols,\n\
    \           just to name examples, have broken connectivity with many\n      \
    \     people being interrupted in their day-to-day work. Global\n           Internet\
    \ management and problem resolution further hamper\n           fast recovery from\
    \ certain incidents. It is unproven that the\n           current technology will\
    \ survive in a competitive but\n           unregulated environment, with uncoordinated\
    \ routing policies\n           and global network management being just two of\
    \ the major\n           issues here.  Furthermore, while frequently comments are\n\
    \           being made where the publicly available monthly increases in\n   \
    \        traffic figures would not justify moving to T3 or even\n           gigabit\
    \ per second networks, it should be pointed out that\n           monthly figures\
    \ are very macroscopic views. Much of the\n           Internet traffic is very\
    \ bursty and we have frequently seen\n           an onslaught of traffic towards\
    \ backbone nodes if one looks\n           at it over fairly short intervals of\
    \ time. For example, for\n           specific applications that, perhaps in real-time,\
    \ require an\n           occasional exchange of massive amounts of data. It is\n\
    \           important that we are prepared for more widespread use of\n      \
    \     such applications, once people are able to use things more\n           sophisticated\
    \ than Telnet, FTP and SMTP. I am not sure\n           whether the amount of research\
    \ and development efforts on the\n           Internet has increased over time,\
    \ less even kept pace with\n           the general Internet growth (by whatever\
    \ definition). I do\n           not believe that the Internet is a finished product\
    \ at this\n           point of time and there is a lot of room for further\n \
    \          evolution.\n      4.4  Ross Callon\n           Ross Callon is a member\

    \         During eleven years of involvement with the Internet\n           community\
    \ it has been exciting to see the explosive growth in\n           data communications\
    \ from a relatively obscure technology to a\n           technology in widespread\
    \ everyday use. For the future, I am\n           interested in transition to a\
    \ world-wide multi-protocol\n           Internet. This requires scaling to several\
    \ orders of\n           magnitude larger than the current Internet, and also requires\n\
    \           a greater emphasis on reliability and ease of use. Probably\n    \
    \       our greatest challenge is to create a system which \"ordinary\n      \

    \           The Internet started as a focused DARPA research effort to\n     \
    \      develop a capability to link computers across multiple,\n           internally\
    \ diverse packet networks. The successful evolution\n           of this technology\
    \ through 4 versions, demonstration on\n           ARPANET, mobile packet radio\
    \ nets, the Atlantic SATNET and\n           at-sea MATNET provided the basis for\
    \ formal mandating of the\n           TCP/IP protocols for use on ARPANET and\
    \ other DoD systems in\n           1983. By the mid-1980's, a market had been\
    \ established for\n           software and hardware supporting these protocols,\
    \ largely\n           triggered by the Ethernet and other LAN phenomena, coupled\n\
    \           with the rapid proliferation of UNIX-based systems which\n       \
    \    incorporated the TCP/IP protocols as part of the standard\n           release\
    \ package.  Concurrent with the development of a market\n           and rapid\
    \ increase in vendor interest, government agencies in\n           addition to\
    \ DoD began applying the technology to their needs,\n           culminating in\
    \ the formation of the Federal Research Internet\n           Coordinating Committee\
    \ which has now evolved into the Federal\n           Networking Council, in the\
    \ U.S. At the same time, similar\n           rapid growth of TCP/IP technology\
    \ application is occurring\n           outside the US in Europe, the Middle East,\
    \ the Pacific Rim,\n           Eurasia, Australia, South and Central America and,\
    \ to a\n           limited extent, Africa.  The internationalization of the\n\
    \           Internet has spawned new organizational foci such as the\n       \
    \    Coordinating Committee for International Research Networking\n          \
    \ (CCIRN) and heightened interest in commercial provision of IP\n           services\
    \ (e.g., in Finland, the U.S., the U.K. and\n           elsewhere).\n        \
    \   The Internet has also become the basis for a proposed\n           National\
    \ Research and Education Network (NREN) in the U.S.\n           It's electronic\
    \ messaging system has been linked to the major\n           U.S.  commercial email\
    \ carriers and to other major private\n           electronic mail services such\
    \ as Bitnet (in the US, EARN in\n           Europe) as well as UUNET (in the U.S.)\
    \ and EUNET (in Europe).\n           The Bitnet and UUCP-based systems are international\
    \ in scope\n           and complement the Internet system in terms of email\n\
    \           connectivity.\n           With the introduction of OSI capability\
    \ (in the form of CLNP)\n           into important parts of the Internet (such\
    \ as the NSFNET\n           backbone and selected intermediate level networks),\
    \ a path\n           has been opened to support the use of multiple protocol\n\
    \           suites in the Internet. Many of the vendor routers/gateways\n    \
    \       support TCP/IP, OSI and a variety of vendor-specific\n           protocols\
    \ in a common network environment.\n           In the U.S., regional Bell Operating\
    \ Company carriers are\n           planning the introduction of Switched Multimegabit\
    \ Data\n           Services and Frame Relay services which can support TCP/IP\n\
    \           and other Internet protocols. On the research side, DARPA and\n  \
    \         the NSF are supporting a major initiative in gigabit speed\n       \
    \    networking, towards which the NREN is aimed.\n           The Internet is\
    \ a grand collaboration of over 5000 networks\n           involving millions of\
    \ users, hundreds of thousands of hosts\n           and dozens of countries around\
    \ the world. It may well do for\n           computers what the telephone system\
    \ has done for people:\n           provided a means for international interchange\
    \ of information\n           which is blind to nationality, proprietary interests,\
    \ and\n           hardware platform specifics.\n      4.6  Noel Chiappa, IETF\
    \ Internet Area Co-director\n           Noel Chiappa is currently an independent\
    \ inventor working in\n           the area of computer networks and system software.\
    \ His\n           principal occupation, however, is his service as the Internet\n\
    \           Area Co-director for the Internet Engineering Steering Group\n   \
    \        of the Internet Engineering Task Force.\n           His primary current\

    \ for very large scale\n           (globally ubiquitous and larger) internetworks,\
    \ but he is\n           generally interested in the problems of the packet layer\
    \ of\n           internetworking; i.e., everything involved in getting traffic\n\
    \           from one host to another anywhere in the internetwork.  As a\n   \
    \        'spare time amusement' project, he is also writing a C\n           compiler\
    \ with many novel features intended for use in large\n           programming projects\
    \ with many source and header files.\n           He has been a member of the TCP/IP\
    \ Working Group and its\n           successors (up to the IETF) since 1977. He\
    \ was a member of\n           the Research Staff at the Massachusetts Institute\
    \ of\n           Technology from 1977-1982 and 1984-1986. While at MIT he\n  \
    \         worked on packet switching and local area networks, and was\n      \
    \     responsible for the conception of the multi-protocol backbone\n        \
    \   and the multi-protocol router.  After leaving MIT he worked\n           with\
    \ a number of companies, including Proteon, to bring\n           networking products\
    \ based on work done at MIT to the public.\n           He attended Phillips Andover\

    \ cars (principally Lotuses), reading (particularly\n           political and\
    \ military history and biographies), landscape\n           gardening (particularly\
    \ Japanese), and study of Oriental rugs\n           (particularly Turkoman tribal\

    \           Lyman Chapin graduated from Cornell University in 1973 with a\n  \
    \         B.A. in Mathematics, and spent the next two years writing\n        \
    \   COBOL applications for Systems & Programs (NZ) Ltd. in Lower\n           Hutt,\
    \ New Zealand.  After a year travelling in Australia and\n           Asia, he\
    \ joined the newly-formed Networking group at Data\n           General Corporation\
    \ in 1977.  At DG, he was responsible for\n           the development of software\
    \ for distributed resource\n           management (operating-system embedded RPC),\
    \ distributed\n           database management, X.25-based local and wide- area\n\
    \           networks, and OSI-based transport, internetwork, and routing\n   \
    \        functions for DG's open-system products.  In 1987 he formed\n       \
    \    the Distributed Systems Architecture group, and was\n           responsible\
    \ for the development of DG's Distributed\n           Application Architecture\
    \ (DAA) and for the specification of\n           the directory and management\
    \ services of DAA.  He moved to\n           Bolt, Beranek & Newman in 1990 as\
    \ the Chief Network Architect\n           in BBN's Communications Division, where\
    \ he serves as a\n           consultant to the Systems Architecture group and\

    \           ------------\n           I started out in 1977 working with X.25 networks,\
    \ and began\n           working on OSI in 1979 - first the architecture (the OSI\n\
    \           Reference Model), and then the transport, internetwork, and\n    \
    \       routing protocol specifications.  It didn't take long to\n           recognize\
    \ the basic irony of OSI standards development:\n           there we were, solemnly\
    \ anointing international standards for\n           networking, and every time\
    \ we needed to send electronic mail\n           or exchange files, we were using\
    \ the TCP/IP-based Internet!\n           I've been looking for ways to overcome\
    \ this anomaly ever\n           since;  to inject as much of the proven TCP/IP\
    \ technology\n           into OSI as possible, and to introduce OSI into an ever\
    \ more\n           pervasive and worldwide Internet.  It is, to say the least,\
    \ a\n           challenge!\n      4.8  Dr. David Clark\n           David Clark\
    \ works at the M.I.T. Laboratory for Computer\n           Science, where he is\
    \ a Senior Research Scientist. His current\n           research involves protocols\
    \ for high speed and very large\n           networks, in particular the problems\
    \ of routing and flow and\n           congestion control. He is also working on\
    \ integration of\n           video into packet networks. Prior to this effort,\
    \ he\n           developed a new implementation approach for network software,\n\
    \           and an operating system (Swift) to demonstrate this concept.\n   \

    \           It is not proper to think of networks as connecting\n           computers.\
    \ Rather, they connect people using computers to\n           mediate. The great\
    \ success of the internet is not technical,\n           but in human impact. Electronic\
    \ mail may not be a wonderful\n           advance in Computer Science, but it\
    \ is a whole new way for\n           people to communicate. The continued growth\
    \ of the Internet\n           is a technical challenge to all of us, but we must\
    \ never\n           loose sight of where we came from, the great change we have\n\
    \           worked on the larger computer community, and the great\n         \
    \  potential we have for future change.\n      4.9  Stephen Crocker, IETF Security\
    \ Area Director\n           Steve Crocker joined Trusted Information Systems,\
    \ Inc.  in\n           1986 and is a vice president.  He set up TIS' Los Angeles\n\
    \           office and ran it until summer 1989 when he moved to the home\n  \
    \         office in Maryland.  At TIS his primary concerns are program\n     \
    \      verification research and application, integration of\n           cryptography\
    \ with trusted systems, network security, and new\n           applications for\
    \ networks and trusted systems.\n           He was at the Aerospace Corporation\
    \ from 1981-86 as Director\n           of the Information Sciences Research Office\
    \ which later\n           became the Computer Science Laboratory.  The research\
    \ program\n           at Aerospace included networks, program verification,\n\
    \           artificial intelligence, applications of expert systems, and\n   \
    \        parallel processing.\n           From 1974-81 he was a researcher at\
    \ USC's Information\n           Sciences Institute, where he focused primarily\
    \ on program\n           verification.  From 1971-74 he was a program manager\
    \ at\n           DARPA/IPTO, responsible for the research programs in\n      \
    \     artificial intelligence, automatic programming, speech\n           understanding,\
    \ and some parts of the network research.  He\n           also initiated an ambitious\
    \ but somewhat ill-fated venture\n           called the National Software Works.\n\
    \           From 1968-71 he was a graduate student in the UCLA Computer\n    \
    \       Science Department.  While there he initiated the Network\n          \
    \ Working Group, arguably the forerunner of the IETF and many\n           related\
    \ groups around the world, and helped define the\n           original suite of\
    \ protocols for the Arpanet.  He also\n           initiated the Request for Comments\
    \ (RFC) series.  A short\n           description of the events of that era are\
    \ contained in RFC\n           1000.\n           He was a graduate student in\
    \ the MIT AI Lab for a year and a\n           half in 1967-68, and an undergraduate\
    \ at UCLA for a long time\n           before that.\n           ------------\n\
    \           I've watched the Internet grow from its beginning.  At UCLA\n    \
    \       we had the privilege of being the first of the Arpanet.  In\n        \
    \   those days, several of us dreamed of very high quality\n           intercomputer\
    \ connections and very rich protocols to knit the\n           computers together.\
    \  Some of the those concepts are still\n           discussed and anticipated\
    \ today under the names remote\n           visualization, distributed file systems,\
    \ etc.  On the other\n           hand, I would never have imagined that 20 years\
    \ later we'd\n           have such a plethora of different network technologies.\
    \  Even\n           more astonishing is the enormous number of independently\n\
    \           managed but nonetheless interconnected networks that make up\n   \
    \        the current network.  And somewhat beyond comprehension is\n        \
    \   that it seems to work.\n           How will the Internet evolve?  I expect\
    \ to see substantial\n           developments in the following dimensions.\n \
    \          o Regularization, internationalization and commercialization\n    \
    \       Standards will become even more important than they are now.\n       \
    \    Implementations of protocols and related mechanisms will\n           become\
    \ more standard and robust.  The relationship between\n           the TCP/IP stack\
    \ and the OSI stack will be resolved with\n           The Internet will become\
    \ a less U.S.-centric and more\n           international operation.  Much of the\
    \ Internet will be\n           operated by commercial concerns on a a profit-making\
    \ basis,\n           thereby opening up the Internet to unrestricted use.  The\n\
    \           telephone companies, including both the local exchange\n         \
    \  carriers and the interexchange carriers, will start providing\n           some\
    \ of the protocol stack other than the point-to-point\n           lines.\n   \
    \        o Higher and lower bandwidths; great proliferation\n           I expect\
    \ to see T1 connections become the norm for the types\n           of institutions\
    \ that are now on the Internet.  Higher speeds,\n           including speeds up\
    \ to a gigabit will become available.  At\n           the same time, I expect\
    \ to see a vast expansion of the\n           Internet, reaching into a significant\
    \ fraction of the schools\n           and businesses in this country and elsewhere\
    \ in the world.\n           Many of these institutions will be connected at 9600\
    \ bits/sec\n           or slower.\n           o More applications\n          \
    \ E-mail dominates the Internet, and it's likely to remain the\n           dominant\
    \ use of the Internet in the future.  Nonetheless, I\n           expect to see\
    \ an exciting array of other applications which\n           become heavily used\
    \ and cause a change in the perception of\n           the Internet as primarily\
    \ a \"mail system.\"  Important\n           databases will become available on\
    \ the Internet, and\n           applications dependent on those databases will\
    \ flourish.  New\n           techniques and tools for collaboration over a network\
    \ will\n           emerge.  These will include various forms of conferencing and\n\
    \           cooperative multi-media document development.\n           o Security\n\
    \           Security will tighten up on the Internet, but not without\n      \
    \     some (more) pain.  Host operating systems will be built,\n           configured,\
    \ distributed and operated under much tighter\n           constraints than they\
    \ have been.  Firewalls will abound.\n           Encryption will be added to links,\
    \ routers and various\n           protocol layers.  All of this will decrease\
    \ the utility of\n           the Internet in the short run, but lay the groundwork\
    \ for\n           broader use eventually.  New protocols will emerge which\n \
    \          incorporate sound protection but also provide efficient and\n     \
    \      flexible access control and resource sharing.  These will\n           provide\
    \ the basis for the kind of close knit applications\n           that motivated\
    \ the original thinking behind the Arpanet.\n      4.10 James R. Davin, IETF Network\

    \           The growth of the internet over the years has taken it from\n    \
    \       lower speeds to higher speeds, from limited geographical\n           extent\
    \ to global presence, from research apparatus to an\n           essential social\
    \ and commercial infrastructure, from\n           experimentation among a few\
    \ networking sophisticates to daily\n           use by thousands in all walks\
    \ of life. This latter sort of\n           growth is almost certainly the most\
    \ valuable.\n      4.11 Dr. Deborah Estrin, IRSG Member\n           Deborah Estrin\

    \ in Computer\n           Science and her M.S. (1982) in Technology Policy, both\
    \ from\n           the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She received her\n\
    \           B.S.  (1980) from U.C.  Berkeley. In 1987 Estrin received the\n  \
    \         National Science Foundation, Presidential Young Investigator\n     \
    \      Award for her research in network interconnection and\n           security.\
    \  Her research focuses on the design of network and\n           routing protocols\
    \ for very large, global, networks.\n           Deborah Estrin has been studying\
    \ issues of internetwork\n           security and routing for almost 10 years.\
    \  As chairperson of\n           the IAB's Autonomous Networks Research Group\
    \ she coordinated\n           and authored some of the earliest discussions and\
    \ evaluations\n           of mechanisms for policy-routing.  She is also one of\
    \ the\n           leading architects of thee Inter-Domain Policy Routing (IDPR)\n\
    \           protocols, in collaboration with other members of the IETF\n     \
    \      IDPR Working Group.  As part of the IDPR effort, Estrin\n           directed\
    \ the implementation of IDPR setup, packet forwarding,\n           and route synthesis\
    \ implementations. She continues to\n           collaborate extensively with BBN\
    \ and other IDPR developers.\n           Previous to her work in policy routing,\
    \ Dr. Estrin refuted\n           the sufficiency of host-security alone, and developed\n\
    \           mechanisms (i.e., the Visa Protocol) for border routers to\n     \
    \      flexibly and securely protect intra-domain network resources\n        \
    \   without modifying the IP protocol itself.  Estrin's Current\n           research\
    \ interests are in inter-domain routing for global\n           internets, and\
    \ adaptive routing to support new high-speed,\n           delay-sensitive services.\n\
    \           Estrin is a member of the National Science Foundation's\n        \
    \   NSFNET technical advisory committee and of the OTA\n           Information\
    \ Technology and Research Assessment Advisory\n           Panel.  Dr. Estrin is\
    \ co-Editor of the Journal of\n           Internetworking Research and Experience\
    \ and has acted as a\n           reviewer and program committee member for several\
    \ IEEE and\n           ACM journals and conferences (e.g., SIGCOMM, INFOCOM,\n\
    \           Security and Privacy). She is a member of IEEE, ACM, AAAS,\n     \
    \      and CPSR.\n           ------------\n           For the past several years\
    \ I have had the opportunity to\n           collaborate in the design of network\
    \ and routing protocols\n           designed to support global internetworks linking\
    \ a very large\n           number of domains (e.g., tens of thousands of networks\
    \ and\n           millions of hosts).  Such scaling implies not only larger\n\
    \           numbers of routers and end-systems, but also increased\n         \
    \  heterogeneity, both technical and administrative.  This\n           raises\
    \ the importance of security, resource control, and\n           usage feedback\
    \ (incentives to encourage users to use the\n           network efficiently) in\
    \ protocol design.  Whereas much of the\n           focus of the technical community\
    \ has been strictly on high\n           speed, it is in the area of large-scale\
    \ systems that we are\n           most lacking in research results and design\
    \ methods and\n           tools.\n      4.12 Russell Hobby, IETF Applications\

    \           particular, the Point-to- Point Protocol (PPP).  UC Davis has\n  \
    \         been very active in the use of networking for students from\n      \
    \     kindergarten through community colleges and has had the Davis\n        \
    \   High School on the Internet since 1989.  In conjunction with\n           the\

    \ that it is lacking in the types of\n           applications that could make\
    \ use of its full potential.  I\n           believes that it is time to look at\

    \  INRIA in Sophia-Antipolis, where he leads the research\n           project\
    \ \"RODEO\", whose objective is the definition and the\n           experimentation\
    \ of communication protocols for very high\n           speed networks, at one\
    \ Gbit/s or more. This includes the\n           study of high speed transmission\
    \ control protocols, of their\n           parameterization and of their insertion\
    \ in the operating\n           systems, and the study of the synchronization functions\
    \ and\n           of the management of data transparency between heterogeneous\n\
    \           systems. The work is conducted in cooperation with industrial\n  \
    \         partners and takes into account the evolution of the\n           communication\
    \ standards.  Previously, he took part to the\n           NADIR project, investigating\
    \ computer usage of\n           telecommunication satellites, and to OSI developments\
    \ in the\n           GIPSI project for the SM90 work station, including one of\
    \ the\n           earliest X.400 systems, and to the ESPRIT project THORN,\n \

    \ in\n           Paris in 1975, and passed his doctorate in the University of\n\
    \           Paris VI in 1985.\n           ------------\n           The various\
    \ projects which followed the \"Cyclades\" network in\n           France were\
    \ following closely the developments of the Arpanet\n           and then the Internet.\
    \ However, the first linkage was\n           established in the early 80's through\
    \ mail connections. I was\n           directly involved in the setting up of the\
    \ first direct TCP-\n           IP connection between France and the Internet\
    \ (actually,\n           NSFNET) which was first experimented in 1987, and became\n\
    \           operational in 1988. This interconnection, together with\n       \
    \    parallel actions in the Nordic countries of Europe, at CERN\n           and\
    \ through the EUNET association, was certainly influential\n           in the\
    \ development TCP/IP internetting in Europe. The rapid\n           growth of the\
    \ Internet here is indicative both of the\n           perceived needs and of the\
    \ future. Researcher from\n           universities, non profit and industrial\
    \ organizations are\n           eager to communicate; new applications are being\
    \ developed\n           which will enable them to interact more and more closely..\n\
    \           and will pose the networking challenge of realizing a very\n     \
    \      large, very powerful Internet.\n      4.14 Erik Huizer, IETF OSI Area Co-director\n\
    \           Erik Huizer graduated from Delft University of Technology\n      \
    \     with a MSc.  in Material Science in 1983.  He spent the next\n         \
    \  four years in the same university building a computerised\n           creep\
    \ measurement system for metallic glasses, including a\n           small local\
    \ network for datatransport to a dataprocessing\n           system.  After getting\
    \ his PhD, he refused military service\n           on grounds of consience (possible\
    \ under Dutch law).  He was\n           then charged with doing instead 18 months\
    \ of civil service in\n           the computing center of the Ministry of Transport,\
    \ department\n           of Building and Roads.  In these 18 months he became\
    \ project\n           manager charged with implementing a Videotex system.  He\
    \ was\n           also charged with investigating TCP/IP as a possible LAN\n \
    \          protocol and X.400 as a possible E-mail protocol.  In 1988,\n     \
    \      he was discharged and started to work for SURFnet BV (the\n           not-for-profit\

    \           ---------------------------\n           I ran into the Internet in\
    \ 1988, and immediately it changed\n           my perspective on networking. \
    \ Working for a European service\n           provider I became a playball tossing\
    \ up and down between the\n           Funding Agencies (OSI) and the users (as\
    \ long as it works),\n           trying to be soft enough not to hurt anyone,\
    \ but hard enough\n           to change things in a manageable way.  This has\
    \ resulted in\n           my view of networking where I can see benifits in OSI\
    \ as well\n           as in the Internet protocol suite, and where I want the\
    \ users\n           to get the best of both worlds.  After years of battle in\
    \ the\n           European camp to make people see the benefits of TCP/IP\n  \
    \         (being called an IP-freak), it was quite a refreshing change\n     \
    \      to join the IETF where I have to battle for OSI (being called\n       \
    \    an OSI-addict).  Apart from the OSI integration into the\n           Internet,\
    \ I have set myself a second, and possibly even\n           heavier task, and\
    \ that is to help and move the Internet and\n           it's associated structures\
    \ like IETF, IRTF, IESG, IAB, etc.,\n           to a more global structure, reflecting\
    \ the penetration of the\n           Internet in all its forms outside of North\
    \ America.\n      4.15 Dr. Stephen Kent, IAB Member, IRSG Member\n           Stephen\

    \ IAB Member\n           Since 1976, Anthony G. Lauck has been responsible for\
    \ network\n           architecture and advanced development at Digital Equipment\n\
    \           Corporation, where he currently manages the\n           Telecommunications\
    \ and Networks Architecture and Advanced\n           Development group.  For the\
    \ past fifteen years his group has\n           designed the network architecture\
    \ and protocols behind\n           Digital's DECnet computer networking products.\
    \  His group has\n           played a leading role in local area network standardization,\n\
    \           including Ethernet, FDDI, and transparent bridged LANs.  His\n   \
    \        group has also played a leading role in standardizing the OSI\n     \
    \      network and transport layers.  Most recently, they have\n           completed\
    \ the architecture for the next phase of DECnet which\n           is based on\
    \ OSI while providing backward compatibility with\n           DECnet Phase IV.\
    \  Prior to his role in network architecture\n           he was responsible for\
    \ setting the direction of Digital's\n           PDP-11 communications products.\
    \  In addition to working at\n           Digital, he worked at Autex, Inc. where\
    \ was a designer of a\n           transaction processing system for securities\
    \ trading and at\n           the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory were he\
    \ developed\n           an early remote batch system.\n           Mr. Lauck received\
    \ his BA degree from Harvard in 1965.  He\n           has worked in a number of\
    \ areas related to data\n           communication, ranging from design of physical\
    \ links for\n           local area networks to applications for distributed\n\
    \           processing.  His current interests include high speed local\n    \
    \       and wide area networks, multiprotocol networking, network\n          \
    \ security, and distributed processing. He was a member of the\n           Committee\
    \ on Computer-Computer Communications Protocols of\n           the National Research\
    \ Council which did a comparison of the\n           TCP and TP4 transport protocols\
    \ for DOD and NBS.  He was also\n           a member of the National Science Foundation\
    \ Network Technical\n           Advisory Board. In December of 1984, he was recognized\
    \ by\n           Science Digest magazine as one of America's 100 brightest\n \
    \          young scientists for his work on computer networking.\n           ------------\n\
    \           In 1978 Vint Cerf came to Digital to give a lecture on TCP\n     \
    \      and IP, just prior to the big blizzard.  I was pleased to see\n       \
    \    that TCP/IP shared the same connectionless philosophy of\n           networking\
    \ as did DECnet.  Some years later, Digital decided\n           that future phases\
    \ of DECnet would be based on standards.\n           Since Digital was a multinational\
    \ company, the standards\n           would need to be international.  Unfortunately,\
    \ in 1980 ISO\n           rejected TCP and IP on national political grounds. \
    \ When it\n           looked like the emerging OSI standards were going to be\n\
    \           limited to purely connection- oriented networking, I was very\n  \
    \         concerned and began efforts to standardize connectionless\n        \
    \   networking in OSI.  As it turned out, TCP/IP retained its\n           initial\
    \ lead over OSI, moving internationally as the Internet\n           expanded,\
    \ thereby becoming an international protocol suite\n           and meeting my\
    \ original needs.  I hope that the Internet can\n           evolve into a multiprotocol\
    \ structure that can accommodate\n           changing networking technologies\
    \ and can do so with a minimum\n           of religious fervor.  It will be exciting\
    \ to solve problems\n           like network scale and security, especially in\
    \ the context of\n           a network which must serve users while it evolves.\n\

    \           My first exposure to the internet (actually Arpanet) was in\n    \
    \       1977 when, as a DARPA contractor, I was provided access.  At\n       \
    \    that point, the Arpanet was primarily used to support DARPA\n           and\
    \ related activities, and was confined to a relatively\n           small set of\
    \ users and sites.  The Internet technology was\n           just in the process\
    \ of being developed and demonstrated.  In\n           fact, my DARPA contract\
    \ was in relation to the Packet Radio\n           Network, and the primary motivation\
    \ for the Internet\n           technology was to connect the mobile Packet Radio\
    \ Network to\n           the long-haul Arpanet.  Now, only 13 years later, things\
    \ have\n           changed radically.  The Internet has grown by several orders\n\
    \           of magnitude in size and connects a much wider community,\n      \
    \     including academic, commercial, and government.  It has\n           spread\
    \ well beyond the USA to include many organizations\n           throughout the\
    \ world.  It has grown beyond the experimental\n           network to provide\
    \ operational service.  Its influence is\n           seen throughout the computer\
    \ communications community.\n      4.18 Daniel C. Lynch, IAB Member\n        \

    \ it solves simple problems in a\n           simple a manner as possible.  Putting\
    \ together a huge\n           Internet has not been easy.  We still do not know\
    \ how to do\n           routing in a huge internet.  When you add the real world\n\
    \           requirement of commercial security and the desire for\n          \
    \ \"classes of service\" we are faced with big challenges.  I\n           think\
    \ this means that we have to get a lot more involved with\n           operational\
    \ provisioning considerations such as those that\n           the phone companies\
    \ and credit card firms have wrestled with.\n           Hopefully we can do this\
    \ and still maintain the rather\n           friendly attitude that Internetters\
    \ have always had.\n      4.19 David M. Piscitello, IETF OSI Area Co-director\n\
    \           I received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mathematics from\n    \
    \       Villanova University in 1974, with a strong minor in\n           Philosophy.\
    \  Disenchanted with real analysis and metricspace,\n           I decided to pursue\
    \ graduate work in Philosophy.  Requiring\n           significant dollars to attend\
    \ graduate school, I accepted a\n           programming position with Burroughs\
    \ and assembly/micro-coded\n           my way through two semesters of graduate\
    \ work at Villanova.\n           Eventually, I realized that teaching existentialism\
    \ was not\n           the sort of vocation to pay significant mortgage (this was,\n\
    \           after all, the Carter era, and interest rates were then\n        \
    \   nearly 15%). So I remained with Burroughs, and built\n           compilers.\n\
    \           Fortunately, I discovered data communications, then of the\n     \
    \      remote job entry/turnkey form--not quite existentialism, but\n        \
    \   close. Somehow, as a result of agreeing to work on a\n           proprietary\
    \ HDLC (well, IBM had SDLC, so, Burroughs felt it\n           had to have BDLC),\
    \ I became involved with transport and\n           networking protocols for something\
    \ called Open Systems\n           Interconnection. Boning up on available literature\
    \ -- at the\n           time, I recall there was some relatively obscure protocol\n\
    \           suite called TCP/IP, and something from Xerox, and even\n        \
    \   something from Burroughs that seemed to look a lot like that\n           TCP/IP\
    \ thing -- I became pretty excited about helping to\n           develop something\
    \ international and new. I eventually\n           transferred within Burroughs\
    \ to an architecture group, and\n           became immersed in network layer protocols\
    \ for OSI and\n           Burroughs Network Architecture.  I began attending ANSI\
    \ and\n           ISO meetings on OSI NL protocols; Dave Oran (DEC), Lyman\n \
    \          Chapin (then at Data General, and Ross Callon (then at BBN)\n     \
    \      and I met one day in a conference room at a DEC location and\n        \
    \   dreamed up ISO 8473 (ISO IP, ISO CLNP); somehow, it became my\n          \
    \ problem, along with virtually everything in the OSI stack\n           that was\
    \ datagram or \"connectionless\", so for several years,\n           I slugged\
    \ it out with the X.25 community to see that\n           datagrams and internetworking\
    \ would have international\n           acceptance. Of course, I was not alone,\
    \ Dave O., Lyman, and\n           first Ross, later Christine Hemrick (then at\
    \ NTIA) became an\n           OSI version of the Gang of Four in this struggle.\n\
    \           I received my first exposure to the IETF in Boston in the\n      \
    \     mid-eighties, when both an IETF and an ANSI meeting was held\n         \
    \  at BBN, and we shared some insights into routing. At the\n           time,\
    \ I was a proponent of distance vector routing, in\n           particular a routing\
    \ protocol called BIAS (Burroughs\n           Interactive Adaptive routing System,\
    \ go figure how anyone can\n           leave the \"R\" out of an acronym for a\
    \ routing protocol!);\n           later, along with Jeff Rosenberg and Steve Gruchevsky\
    \ of\n           Burroughs (by this time, we were Unisys), I was to introduce\n\
    \           BIAS as a candidate for OSI IS-IS routing in what I've called\n  \
    \         the \"late, great, OSI Routing debate\". Radia Perlman and Dave\n  \
    \         Oran introduced what eventually became OSI IS-IS, a link-\n        \
    \   state/SPF routing system. The routing debate was probably the\n          \
    \ highlight of my standards participation, even being on the\n           losing\
    \ side, since each meeting was filled with good\n           discussions and challenging\
    \ technical issues.\n           Eight years in OSI, nearly all in an uphill struggly,\
    \ took\n           their toll.  I began to resent wading through the obligatory\n\
    \           political purgatory associated with each incremental change\n    \
    \       in OSI, and eventually left in frustration. I also left\n           Unisys\
    \ at approximately the same time, also in frustration,\n           to take on\
    \ what seemed to be yet another Quijotian task --\n           help Christine Hemrick\
    \ at Bellcore bring high speed datagram\n           services into public networks,\
    \ in the form of SMDS.\n           Since 1988, I've been associated with SMDS\
    \ at Bellcore, and\n           have participated in several aspects of its design,\
    \ the most\n           rewarding of which was the design of an SNMP agent for\
    \ SMDS.\n           I'd become sort of a chaotic neutral in the OSI vs. TCP/IP\n\
    \           debate, and remain so. I think both technologies have much to\n  \
    \         offer. TCP/IP has a better standards development\n           infrastructure,\
    \ and I accepted the position as OSI\n           integration area director along\
    \ with Erik Huizer because I\n           believed I could do more for OSI deployment\
    \ within the\n           Internet infrastructure than elswhere. This has been\n\
    \           rewarding and frustrating. The rewards have come from meeting\n  \
    \         and working with some truly bright and energetic people who\n      \
    \     actually care about the implementation and deployment of OSI\n         \
    \  applications and transport stacks; the frustration comes from\n           having\
    \ to deal with the IP-supremist and near racist attitude\n           that frequently\
    \ arises against OSI in the Internet.\n           Oh, well, yet another Quijotian\
    \ task. I suspect you'll have\n           gathered by now that I don't run from\
    \ a good fight.\n      4.20 Dr. Jonathan B. Postel, IAB Member, RFC Editor, IRSG\
    \ Chair\n           Jon Postel joined ISI in March 1976 as a member of the\n \
    \          technical staff, and is now Division Director of the\n           Communications\
    \ Division.  His current activities include a\n           continuing involvement\
    \ with the evolution of the Internet\n           through the work of the various\
    \ ISI projects on Gigabit\n           Networking, Multimedia Conferencing, Protocol\
    \ Engineering,\n           Los Nettos, Parallel Computing System Research, and\
    \ the Fast\n           Parts Automated Broker.  Previous work at ISI included\
    \ the\n           creation of the \"Los Nettos\" regional network for the Los\n\
    \           Angeles area, creating prototype implementations of several\n    \
    \       of the protocols developed for the Internet community,\n           including\
    \ the Simple Mail Transport Protocol, the Domain Name\n           Service, and\
    \ an experimental Multimedia Mail system.  Earlier\n           Jon studied the\
    \ possible approaches for converting the\n           ARPANET from the NCP protocol\
    \ to the TCP protocol.\n           Participated in the design of many protocols\
    \ for the Internet\n           community.\n           Before moving to ISI, Jon\
    \ worked at SRI International in Doug\n           Engelbart's group developing\
    \ the NLS (later called Augment)\n           system.  While at SRI Jon led a special\
    \ project to develop\n           protocol specifications for the Defense Communication\
    \ Agency\n           for AUTODIN-II.  Most of the development effort during this\n\
    \           period at ARC was focused on the National Software Works.\n      \
    \     Prior to working at SRI, Jon spent a few months with Keydata\n         \
    \  redesigning and reimplementing the NCP in the DEC PDP-15 data\n           management\
    \ system used by ARPA.  Before Keydata, Jon worked\n           at the Mitre Corporation\
    \ in Virginia where he conducted a\n           study of ARPANET Network Control\
    \ Protocol implementations.\n           Jon received his B.S. and M.S. in Engineering\
    \ in 1966 and\n           1968 (respectively) from UCLA, and the Ph.D. in Computer\n\
    \           Science in 1974 from UCLA.  Jon is a member of the ACM.  Jon\n   \
    \        continues to participate in the Internet Activities Board and\n     \
    \      serves as the editor of the \"Request for Comments\" Internet\n       \
    \    document series.\n           ------------\n           My first experience\
    \ with the ARPANET was at UCLA when I was\n           working in the group that\
    \ became the Network Measurement\n           Center.  When we were told that the\
    \ first IMP would be\n           installed at UCLA we had to get busy on a number\
    \ of problems.\n           We had to work with the other early sites to develop\n\
    \           protocols, and we had to get our own computing environment in\n  \
    \         order -- this included creating a time-sharing operating\n         \
    \  system for the SDS Sigma-7 computer.  Since then the ARPANET\n           and\
    \ then the Internet have continued to grow and always\n           faster than\
    \ expected.  I think three factors contribute to\n           the success of the\
    \ Internet: 1) public documentation of the\n           protocols, 2) free (or\
    \ cheap) software for the popular\n           machines, and 3) vendor independence.\n\

    \ thirteen years in my professional\n           life to participate in the Internet\
    \ world, from the\n           transition from the TENEX to TOPs-20 machines in\
    \ 1979 to\n           surviving the NCP to TCP transition in 1980.  Celebrating\
    \ the\n           achievement of the ISI 1000 Hour Club where one of our TOPs-\n\
    \           20 machines set a record for staying up and running for 1000\n   \
    \        consecutive hours without crashing, to watching the cellular\n      \
    \     split of the ARPANET into the Milnet and Internet sides, and\n         \
    \  surviving the advent.  All in all, my most memorable times\n           are\
    \ the people who have contributed to the research and\n           development\
    \ of the Internet.  Lots of hard, intense work,\n           coupled with creative,\
    \ exciting fun.  As for the future,\n           there is much discussion and enthusiasm\
    \ about the next steps\n           in the evolution of the Internet.  I'm looking\

    \ has been an Assistant Professor of Computer\n           Science at the University\
    \ of Colorado, Boulder, since 1987.\n           His research concerns distributed\
    \ systems and networks of\n           international scale, with particular focus\
    \ on the problem of\n           allowing users to discover the existence of resources\
    \ of\n           interest, such as documents, software, data, network\n      \
    \     services, and people.  He is also actively involved with\n           various\
    \ network measurement studies concerning usage and\n           connectivity of\
    \ the global Internet.\n           Dr. Schwartz is the chair of the recently formed\
    \ Internet\n           Research Task Force research group on Resource Discovery\
    \ and\n           Directory Service, and is a member of ACM, CPSR, and IEEE.\n\
    \           He received his B.S. degree in Mathematics and Computer\n        \
    \   Science from UCLA, and his M.S. and Ph.D.  degrees in\n           Computer\
    \ Science from the University of Washington.  While a\n           graduate student,\
    \ he worked on locally distributed systems,\n           heterogeneous systems,\
    \ and naming problems.  Schwartz also\n           worked on radar systems at Hughes\
    \ Aircraft Company, and on\n           multi-vendor telephone switching problems\
    \ at Bell\n           Communications Research.\n           ------------\n    \
    \       The growth in connectivity and functionality of the Internet\n       \
    \    over the past five years has been phenomenal.  Yet, few would\n         \
    \  argue that the Internet is in any sense mature.  I believe\n           what\
    \ is lacking most are ease of use by a non-expert\n           populace, and facilities\
    \ that will allow the Internet to\n           continue to grow in usefulness as\
    \ the network grows much\n           larger.  When the Macintosh computer was\
    \ first introduced, it\n           swept in an era where \"ordinary users\" could\
    \ buy a computer,\n           turn it on, and begin working.  We need analogous\n\
    \           advancements in the field of networking and distributed\n        \
    \   systems, to allow people to make sophisticated use of the\n           capbilities\
    \ of large networks without the large amount of\n           specialized knowledge\
    \ that is currently required.  I am\n           particularly interested in services\
    \ and protocols that will\n           allow people to search for resources of\
    \ interest in the\n           Internet; to collaborate with individuals who share\
    \ their\n           interests and concerns, according to very flexible criteria\n\
    \           for shared interest relationships; and to move about the\n       \
    \    global Internet, plugging their mobile computers in at any\n           point,\
    \ seamlessly and effortlessly configuring their system\n           to allow them\
    \ to work at each new site.\n      4.23 Bernhard Stockman, IETF Operations Area\
