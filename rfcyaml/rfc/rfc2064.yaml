- title: 1 The Network Management Framework

  - "1 The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      RFC 1155 defines\
    \ the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and\n      naming objects for the\
    \ purpose of management.  STD 16, RFC 1212\n      defines a more concise description\
    \ mechanism, which is wholly\n      consistent with the SMI.\n      RFC 1156 defines\
    \ MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for the\n      Internet suite of protocols.\
    \  STD 17, RFC 1213 [1] defines MIB-II,\n      an evolution of MIB-I based on\
    \ implementation experience and new\n      operational requirements.\n      STD\
    \ 15, RFC 1157 defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network\n      access to\
    \ managed objects.\n      RFC 1442 [2] defines the SMI for version 2 of the Simple\
    \ Network\n      Management Protocol.\n      RFCs 1443 and 1444 [3,4] define Textual\
    \ Conventions and\n      Conformance Statements for version 2 of the Simple Network\n\
    \      Management Protocol.\n      RFC 1452 [5] describes how versions 1 and 2\
    \ of the Simple Network\n      Management Protocol should coexist.\n   The Framework\
    \ permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and\
    \ evaluation.\n"
- title: 2 Objects
  contents:
  - "2 Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n\
    \   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are\n   defined\
    \ using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [6]\n   defined in\
    \ the SMI. In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [2] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [7],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 2.1 Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1 Format of Definitions\n   Section 4 contains contains the specification of\
    \ all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  These object types are defined\
    \ using\n   the conventions defined in [2] and [3].\n"
- title: 3 Overview
  contents:
  - "3 Overview\n   Traffic Flow Measurement seeks to provide a well-defined method\
    \ for\n   gathering traffic flow information from networks and internetworks.\n\
    \   The background for this is given in \"Traffic Flow Measurement:\n   Background\"\
    \ [8].  The Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (rtfm)\n   Working Group has produced\
    \ a measurement architecture to achieve it;\n   this is documented in \"Traffic\
    \ Flow Measurement:  Architecture\" [9].\n   The architecture defines three entities:\n\
    \     - METERS, which observe network traffic flows and build up a\n       table\
    \ of flow data records for them,\n     - METER REAERS, which collect traffic flow\
    \ data from meters, and\n     - MANAGERS, which oversee the operation of meters\
    \ and meter readers.\n   This memo defines the SNMP management information for\
    \ a Traffic Flow\n   Meter (TFM). It documents the earlier work of the Internet\
    \ Accounting\n   Working Group, and is intended to provide a starting point for\
    \ the\n   Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement Working Group.\n"
- title: 3.1 Scope of Definitions, Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.1 Scope of Definitions, Textual Conventions\n   All objects defined in this\
    \ memo are registered in a single subtree\n   within the mib-2 namespace [1,2],\
    \ and are for use in network devices\n   which may perform a PDU forwarding or\
    \ monitoring function.  For these\n   devices, the value of the ifSpecific variable\
    \ in the MIB-II [1] has\n   the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:\n   flowMIB OBJECT IDENTIFIER\
    \ ::=  mib-2 40\n   as defined below.\n   The RTFM Meter MIB was first produced\
    \ and tested using SNMPv1.  It\n   has been converted into SNMPv2 following the\
    \ guidelines in RFC 1452\n   [5].\n"
- title: 3.2 Usage of the MIB variables
  contents:
  - "3.2 Usage of the MIB variables\n   The MIB breaks into four parts - control,\
    \ flows, rules and\n   conformance statements.\n   The rules implement the minumum\
    \ set of packet-matching actions, as\n   set out in the \"Traffic Flow Measurment:\
    \  Architecture\" document [9].\n   In addition they provide for BASIC-style subroutines,\
    \ allowing a\n   network manager to dramatically reduce the number of rules required\n\
    \   to monitor a big network.\n   Traffic flows are identified by a set of attributes\
    \ for each of its\n   end-points.  Attributes include network addresses for each\
    \ layer of\n   the network protocol stack, and 'subscriber ids,' which may be\
    \ used\n   to identify an accountable entity for the flow.\n   The conformance\
    \ statements are set out as defined in [4].  They\n   explain what must be implemented\
    \ in a meter which claims to conform\n   to this MIB.\n   To retrieve flow data\
    \ one could simply do a linear scan of the flow\n   table.  This would certainly\
    \ work, but would require a lot of\n   protocol exchanges.  To reduce the overhead\
    \ in retrieving flow data\n   the flow table uses a TimeFilter variable, defined\
    \ as a Textual\n   Convention in the RMON2 MIB [10].  This, when used together\
    \ with\n   SNMPv2's GetBulk request, allows a meter reader to scan the flow\n\
    \   table and upload a specified set of flow attributes for those rows\n   which\
    \ have changed since the last reading.\n   As an alternative method of reading\
    \ flow data, the MIB provides an\n   index into the flow table called flowColumnActivityTable.\
    \  This is\n   (logically) a three-dimensional array, subscripted by flow attribute,\n\
    \   activity time and starting flow number.  This allows a meter reader\n   to\
    \ retrieve (in an opaque object) data for a column of the flow table\n   with\
    \ a minimum of SNMP overhead.  An attempt has been made to include\n   a full\
    \ ASN.1 definition of the flowColumnActivityData object.\n   One aspect of data\
    \ collection which needs emphasis is that all the\n   MIB variables are set up\
    \ to allow multiple independent colletors to\n   work properly, i.e.  the flow\
    \ table indexes are stateless.  An\n   alternative approach would have been to\
    \ 'snapshot' the flow table,\n   which would mean that the meter readers would\
    \ have to be\n   synchronized.  The stateless approach does mean that two meter\n\
    \   readers will never return exactly the same set of traffic counts, but\n  \
    \ over long periods (e.g.  15-minute collections over a day) the\n   discrepancies\
    \ are acceptable.  If one really needs a snapshot, this\n   can be achieved by\
    \ switching to an identical rule set with a\n   different RuleSet number, hence\
    \ asynchronous collections may be\n   regarded as a useful generalisation of synchronised\
    \ ones.\n   The control variables are the minimum set required for a meter\n \
    \  reader.  Their number has been whittled down as experience has been\n   gained\
    \ with the MIB implementation.  A few of them are 'general,'\n   i.e.  they control\
    \ the overall behaviour of the meter.  These are set\n   by a single 'master'\
    \ manager, and no other manager should attempt to\n   change their values.  The\
    \ decision as to which manager is the\n   'master' must be made by the network\
    \ operations personnel\n   responsible; this MIB does not attempt to provide any\
    \ support for\n   interaction between managers.\n   There are three other groups\
    \ of control groups, arranged into tables\n   in the same way as in the RMON MIB\
    \ [10].  They are used as follows:\n     - RULE SET INFO: Before attempting to\
    \ download a rule table a manager\n       must create a row in the flowRuleSetInfo\
    \ with flowRuleInfoStatus\n       set to 'createAndWait.'  When the rule set is\
    \ ready the manager\n       must set RuleSetInfo to 'active,' indicating that\
    \ the rule set is\n       ready for use.\n     - METER READER INFO: Any meter\
    \ reader wishing to collect data\n       reliably for all flows should first create\
    \ a row in the\n       flowReaderInfoTable with flowReaderStatus set to 'active.'\
    \  It\n       should write that row's flowReaderLastTime object each time it\n\
    \       starts a collection pass through the flow table.  The meter will\n   \
    \    not recover a flow's memory until every meter reader holding a row\n    \
    \   in this table has collected that flow's data.\n     - MANAGER INFO: Any manager\
    \ wishing to download rule sets to the\n       meter must create a row in the\
    \ flowManagerInfo table with\n       flowManagerStatus set to 'active.'.  Once\
    \ it has a table row, the\n       manager may set the control variables in its\
    \ row so as to cause the\n       meter to run any valid rule set held by the meter.\n"
