  - "1. Introduction\n   In 1968, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\
    \ (DARPA)\n   initiated an effort to develop a technology which is now known as\n\
    \   packet switching.  This technology had its roots in message switching\n  \
    \ methods, but was strongly influenced by the development of low-cost\n   minicomputers\
    \ and digital telecommunications techniques during the\n   mid-1960's [BARAN 64,\
    \ ROBERTS 70, HEART 70, ROBERTS 78].  A very\n   useful survey of this technology\
    \ can be found in [IEEE 78].\n   During the early 1970's, DARPA initiated a number\
    \ of programs to\n   explore the use of packet switching methods in alternative\
    \ media\n   including mobile radio, satellite and cable [IEEE 78, IEEE 87].\n\
    \   Concurrently, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) began an\n   exploration\
    \ of packet switching on coaxial cable which ultimately led\n   to the development\
    \ of Ethernet local area networks [METCALFE 76].\n   The successful implementation\
    \ of packet radio and packet satellite\n   technology raised the question of interconnecting\
    \ ARPANET with other\n   types of packet nets.  A possible solution to this problem\
    \ was\n   proposed by Cerf and Kahn [CERF 74] in the form of an internetwork\n\
    \   protocol and a set of gateways to connect the different networks.\n   This\
    \ solution was further developed as part of a research program in\n   internetting\
    \ sponsored by DARPA and resulted in a collection of\n   computer communications\
    \ protocols based on the original Transmission\n   Control Protocol (TCP) and\
    \ its lower level counterpart, Internet\n   Protocol (IP).  Together, these protocols,\
    \ along with many others\n   developed during the course of the research, are\
    \ referred to as the\n   TCP/IP Protocol Suite [LEINER 85, POSTEL 85, CERF 82,\
    \ CLARK 86, RFC\n   1100].\n   In the early stages of the Internet research program,\
    \ only a few\n   researchers worked to develop and test versions of the internet\n\
    \   protocols.  Over time, the size of this activity increased until, in\n   1979,\
    \ it was necessary to form an informal committee to guide the\n   technical evolution\
    \ of the protocol suite.  This group was called the\n   Internet Configuration\
    \ Control Board (ICCB) and was established by\n   Dr. Vinton Cerf who was then\
    \ the DARPA program manager for the\n   effort.  Dr. David C. Clark of the Lab\
    \ for Computer Science at\n   Massachusetts Institute of Technology was named\
    \ the chairman of this\n   committee.\n   In January, 1983, the Defense Communications\
    \ Agency, then responsible\n   for the operation of the ARPANET, declared the\
    \ TCP/IP protocol suite\n   to be standard for the ARPANET and all systems on\
    \ the network\n   converted from the earlier Network Control Program (NCP) to\
    \ TCP/IP.\n   Late that year, the ICCB was reorganized by Dr. Barry Leiner, Cerf's\n\
    \   successor at DARPA, around a series of task forces considering\n   different\
    \ technical aspects of internetting.  The re-organized group\n   was named the\
    \ Internet Activities Board.\n   As the Internet expanded, it drew support from\
    \ U.S. Government\n   organizations including DARPA, the National Science Foundation\
    \ (NSF),\n   the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Aeronautics and Space\n\
    \   Administration (NASA).  Key managers in these organizations,\n   responsible\
    \ for computer networking research and development, formed\n   an informal Federal\
    \ Research Internet Coordinating Committee (FRICC)\n   to coordinate U.S. Government\
    \ support for and development and use of\n   the Internet system.  The FRICC sponsors\
    \ most of the U.S. research on\n   internetting, including support for the Internet\
    \ Activities Board and\n   its subsidiary organizations.\n   At the international\
    \ level, a Coordinating Committee for\n   Intercontinental Research Networks (CCIRN)\
    \ has been formed which\n   includes the U.S.  FRICC and its counterparts in North\
    \ America and\n   Europe.  The CCIRN provides a forum for cooperative planning\
    \ among\n   the principal North American and European research networking bodies.\n"

  - "2. Internet Activities Board\n   The Internet Activities Board (IAB) is the coordinating\
    \ committee for\n   Internet design, engineering and management.  The Internet\
    \ is a\n   collection of over a thousand packet switched networks located\n  \
    \ principally in the U.S., but also includes systems in many other\n   parts of\
    \ the world, all interlinked and operating using the protocols\n   of the TCP/IP\
    \ protocol suite.  The IAB is an independent committee of\n   researchers and\
    \ professionals with a technical interest in the health\n   and evolution of the\
    \ Internet system.  Membership changes with time\n   to adjust to the current\
    \ realities of the research interests of the\n   participants, the needs of the\
    \ Internet system and the concerns of\n   the U.S. Government, university and\
    \ industrial sponsors of the\n   elements of the Internet.\n   IAB members are\
    \ deeply committed to making the Internet function\n   effectively and evolve\
    \ to meet a large scale, high speed future.  All\n   IAB members are required\
    \ to have at least one other major role in the\n   Internet community in addition\
    \ to their IAB membership.  New members\n   are appointed by the chairman of the\
    \ IAB, with the advice and consent\n   of the remaining members.  The chairman\
    \ serves a term of two years.\n   The IAB focuses on the TCP/IP protocol suite,\
    \ and extensions to the\n   Internet system to support multiple protocol suites.\n\
    \   The IAB has two principal subsidiary task forces:\n      1) Internet Engineering\
    \ Task Force (IETF)\n      2) Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)\n   Each of\
    \ these Task Forces is led by a chairman and guided by a\n   Steering Group which\
    \ reports to the IAB through its chairman.  Each\n   task force is organized by\
    \ the chairman, as required, to carry out\n   its charter.  For the most part,\
    \ a collection of Working Groups\n   carries out the work program of each Task\
    \ Force.\n   All decisions of the IAB are made public.  The principal vehicle\
    \ by\n   which IAB decisions are propagated to the parties interested in the\n\
    \   Internet and its TCP/IP protocol suite is the Request for Comment\n   (RFC)\
    \ note series.  The archival RFC series was initiated in 1969 by\n   Dr. Stephen\
    \ D. Crocker as a means of documenting the development of\n   the original ARPANET\
    \ protocol suite [RFC 1000].  The editor-in-chief\n   of this series, Dr. Jonathan\
    \ B.  Postel, has maintained the quality\n   of and managed the archiving of this\
    \ series since its inception.  A\n   small proportion of the RFCs document Internet\
    \ standards.  Most of\n   them are intended to stimulate comment and discussion.\
    \  The small\n   number which document standards are especially marked in a \"\
    status\"\n   section to indicate the special status of the document.  An RFC\n\
    \   summarizing the status of all standard RFCs is published regularly\n   [RFC\
    \ 1100].\n   RFCs describing experimental protocols, along with other submissions\n\
    \   whose intent is merely to inform, are typically submitted directly to\n  \
    \ the RFC Editor.  A Standard RFC starts out as a Proposed Standard and\n   may\
    \ be promoted to Draft Standard and finally Standard after suitable\n   review,\
    \ comment, implementation, and testing.\n   Prior to publication of a Proposed\
    \ Standard, Draft Standard or\n   Standard RFC, it is made available for comment\
    \ through an on-line\n   Internet-Draft directory.  Typically, these Internet-Drafts\
    \ are\n   working documents of the IAB or of the working groups of the Internet\n\
    \   Engineering and Research Task Forces.  Internet Drafts are either\n   submitted\
    \ to the RFC Editor for publication or discarded within three\n   months.\n  \
    \ The IAB performs the following functions:\n      1)   Sets Internet Standards,\n\
    \      2)   Manages the RFC publication process,\n      3)   Reviews the operation\
    \ of the IETF and IRTF,\n      4)   Performs strategic planning for the Internet,\
    \ identifying\n           long-range problems and opportunities,\n      5)   Acts\
    \ as a technical policy liaison and representative for the\n           Internet\
    \ community, and\n      6)   Resolves technical issues which cannot be treated\
    \ within the\n           IETF or IRTF frameworks.\n   To supplement its work via\
    \ electronic mail, the IAB meets quarterly\n   to review the condition of the\
    \ Internet, to review and approve\n   proposed changes or additions to the TCP/IP\
    \ suite of protocols, to\n   set technical development priorities, to discuss\
    \ policy matters which\n   may need the attention of the Internet sponsors, and\
    \ to agree on the\n   addition or retirement of IAB members and on the addition\
    \ or\n   retirement of task forces reporting to the IAB.  Typically, two of\n\
    \   the quarterly meetings are by means of video teleconferencing\n   (provided,\
    \ when possible, through the experimental Internet packet\n   video-conferencing\
    \ system).\n   The IAB membership is currently as follows:\n            Vinton\

  - "3.  The Internet Engineering Task Force\n   The Internet has grown to encompass\
    \ a large number of widely geo-\n   graphically dispersed networks in academic\
    \ and research communities.\n   It now provides an infrastructure for a broad\
    \ community with various\n   interests.  Moreover, the family of Internet protocols\

    \  To\n   help coordinate the operation, management and evolution of the\n   Internet,\
    \ the IAB established the Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF).\n   The\
    \ IETF is chaired by Mr. Phillip Gross and managed by its Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG).  The IAB has delegated to the IESG\n   the general responsibility\
    \ for making the Internet work and for the\n   resolution of all short- and mid-range\
    \ protocol and architectural\n   issues required to make the Internet function\
    \ effectively.\n   The charter of the IETF includes:\n      1) Responsibility\

    \ open community of\n   network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers\
    \ concerned with\n   the Internet and the Internet protocol suite.  It is organized\
    \ around\n   a set of eight technical areas, each managed by a technical area\n\
    \   director.  In addition to the IETF Chairman, the area directors make\n   up\
    \ the IESG membership.  Each area director has primary\n   responsibility for\

  - "4.  The Internet Research Task Force\n   To promote research in networking and\
    \ the development of new\n   technology, the IAB established the Internet Research\
    \ Task Force\n   (IRTF).\n   In the area of network protocols, the distinction\
    \ between research\n   and engineering is not always clear, so there will sometimes\
    \ be\n   overlap between activities of the IETF and the IRTF.  There is, in\n\
    \   fact, considerable overlap in membership between the two groups. This\n  \
    \ overlap is regarded as vital for cross-fertilization and technology\n   transfer.\
    \  In general, the distinction between research and\n   engineering is one of\
    \ viewpoint and sometimes (but not always) time-\n   frame.  The IRTF is generally\
    \ more concerned with understanding than\n   with products or standard protocols,\
    \ although specific experimental\n   protocols may have to be developed, implemented\
    \ and tested in order\n   to gain understanding.\n   The IRTF is a community of\
    \ network researchers, generally with an\n   Internet focus.  The work of the\
    \ IRTF is governed by its Internet\n   Research Steering Group (IRSG).  The chairman\
    \ of the IRTF and IRSG is\n   David Clark. The IRTF is organized into a number\
    \ of Research Groups\n   (RGs) whose chairs are appointed by the chairman of the\
    \ IRSG.  The RG\n   chairs and others selected by the IRSG chairman serve on the\
    \ IRSG.\n   These groups typically have 10 to 20 members, and each covers a broad\n\
    \   area of research, pursuing specific topics, determined at least in\n   part\
    \ by the interests of the members and by recommendations of the\n   IAB.\n   The\
    \ current members of the IRSG are as follows:\n            David Clark       \
    \  - Chairman\n            Robert Braden       - End-to-End Services\n       \

- title: 5. The Near-term Agenda of the IAB
  contents:
  - "5. The Near-term Agenda of the IAB\n   There are seven principal foci of IAB\
    \ attention for the period 1989 -\n   1990:\n      1) Operational Stability\n\
    \      2) User Services\n      3) OSI Coexistence\n      4) Testbed Facilities\n\
    \      5) Security\n      6) Getting Big\n      7) Getting Fast\n   Operational\
    \ stability of the Internet is a critical concern for all\n   of its users.  Better\
    \ tools are needed for gathering operational\n   data, to assist in fault isolation\
    \ at all levels and to analyze the\n   performance of the system.  Opportunities\
    \ abound for increased\n   cooperation among the operators of the various Internet\
    \ components\n   [RFC 1109].  Specific, known problems should be dealt with, such\
    \ as\n   implementation deficiencies in some version of the BIND domain name\n\
    \   service resolver software.  To the extent that the existing Exterior\n   Gateway\
    \ Protocol (EGP) is only able to support limited topologies,\n   constraints on\
    \ topological linkages and allowed transit paths should\n   be enforced until\
    \ a more general Inter-Autonomous System routing\n   protocol can be specified.\
    \  Flexibility for Internet implementation\n   would be enhanced by the adoption\
    \ of a common internal gateway\n   routing protocol by all vendors of internet\
    \ routers.  A major effort\n   is recommended to achieve conformance to the Host\
    \ Requirements RFCs\n   which are to be published early in the fourth quarter\
    \ of calendar\n   1989.\n   Among the most needed user services, the White Pages\
    \ (an electronic\n   mailbox directory service) seems the most pressing.  Efforts\
    \ should\n   be focused on widespread deployment of these capabilities in the\n\
    \   Internet by mid-1990.  The IAB recommends that existing white pages\n   facilities\
    \ and newer ones, such as X.500, be populated with up-to-\n   date user information\
    \ and made accessible to Internet users and users\n   of other systems (e.g.,\
    \ commercial email carriers) linked to the\n   Internet.  Connectivity with commercial\
    \ electronic mail carriers\n   should be vigorously pursued, as well as links\
    \ to other network\n   research communities in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\
    \   Development and deployment of privacy-enhanced electronic mail\n   software\
    \ should be accelerated in 1990 after release of public domain\n   software implementing\
    \ the private electronic mail standards [RFC\n   1113, RFC 1114, and RFC 1115].\
    \  Finally, support for new or enhanced\n   applications such as computer-based\
    \ conferencing, multi-media\n   messaging and collaboration support systems should\
    \ be developed.\n   The National Network Testbed (NNT) resources planned by the\
    \ FRICC\n   should be applied to support conferencing and collaboration protocol\n\
    \   development and application experiments and to support multi-vendor\n   router\
    \ interoperability testing (e.g., interior and exterior routing,\n   network management,\
    \ multi-protocol routing and forwarding).\n   With respect to growth in the Internet,\
    \ architectural attention\n   should be focused on scaling the system to hundreds\
    \ of millions of\n   users and hundreds of thousands of networks.  The naming,\
    \ addressing,\n   routing and navigation problems occasioned by such growth should\
    \ be\n   analyzed.  Similarly, research should be carried out on analyzing the\n\
    \   limits to the existing Internet architecture, including the ability\n   of\
    \ the present protocol suite to cope with speeds in the gigabit\n   range and\
    \ latencies varying from microseconds to seconds in duration.\n   The Internet\
    \ should be positioned to support the use of OSI protocols\n   by the end of 1990\
    \ or sooner, if possible.  Provision for multi-\n   protocol routing and forwarding\
    \ among diverse vendor routes is one\n   important goal.  Introduction of X.400\
    \ electronic mail services and\n   interoperation with RFC 822/SMTP [RFC 822,\
    \ RFC 821, RFC 987, RFC\n   1026] should be targeted for 1990 as well.  These\
    \ efforts will need\n   to work in conjunction with the White Pages services mentioned\
    \ above.\n   The IETF, in particular, should establish liaison with various OSI\n\
    \   working groups (e.g., at NIST, RARE, Network Management Forum) to\n   coordinate\
    \ planning for OSI introduction into the Internet and to\n   facilitate registration\
    \ of information pertinent to the Internet with\n   the various authorities responsible\
    \ for OSI standards in the United\n   States.\n"
