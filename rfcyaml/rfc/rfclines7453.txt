MIB modules for transport networks.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes additional textual conventions and managed objects for tunnels, identifiers, and Label Switching Routers to support Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
MIB modules for transport networks.
MIB modules defined in this document extend the existing MPLS MIB objects in such a way that they support the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS TP) but also other MPLS networks.
Hence, "MPLS TP" is not included in the MIB module names.
As described in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) MIB definition [RFC3812], MPLS traffic engineering is concerned with the creation and management of MPLS tunnels.
This term is a shorthand for a combination of one or more LSPs linking an ingress and an egress LSR.
Several types of point to point MPLS tunnels may be constructed between a pair of LSRs A and B: Unidirectional with a single LSP (say, from A to B).
Associated bidirectional consisting of two separately routed LSPs, one linking A to B and the other linking B to A. Together, the pair provides a single logical bidirectional transport path.
Co routed bidirectional consisting of an associated bidirectional tunnel but with the second LSP from B to A following the reverse of the path of the LSP from A to B, in terms of both nodes and links.
Tunnels may be either statically configured by management action or dynamically created using an LSP management protocol.
The existing MPLS TE MIB [RFC3812] and the GMPLS TE MIB [RFC4802] address only a subset of the combinations of statically and dynamically configured tunnel types, catering to statically configured unidirectional tunnels together with dynamically configured unidirectional and co routed bidirectional tunnels.
They are also restricted to two endpoint LSRs identified by IP addresses.
The MPLS TP TE MIB defined in this document extends the MIB modules defined in [RFC3812] to cover all six combinations (that is, adding support for statically configured associated and co routed bidirectional plus dynamically configured associated bidirectional tunnels).
It also extends support to endpoints that have identifiers other than IP addresses.
This support is provided by a suite of four MIB modules that are to be used in conjunction with the MIB modules defined in [RFC3812] and the companion document [RFC3813] for MPLS TP tunnel management.
At the time of writing, SNMP SET is no longer recommended as a way to configure MPLS networks as described in [RFC3812].
However, since the MIB modules specified in this document extend and are intended to work in parallel with the MIB modules for MPLS specified in [RFC3812], certain objects defined here are specified with MAX ACCESS of read write or read create so that specifications of the base tables in [RFC3812] and the extensions in this document are consistent.
Although the examples described in Section 9 specify means to configure MPLS TP Tunnels in a similar way to the examples in [RFC3812], this should be seen as indicating how the MIB values would be returned if the specified circumstances were configured by alternative means.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580

Motivations "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Traffic Engineering (TE) Management Information Base (MIB)
" [RFC3812] provides support for Traffic Engineering tunnels.
In MPLS, the actual transport of packets is provided by Label Switched Paths (LSPs).
A transport service may be composed of multiple LSPs.
In order to clearly identify the MPLS TP service, as defined in [RFC6370], we use the term "MPLS TP Tunnel" or simply "tunnel".
However, with MPLS TP, the characteristics of the tunnels were enhanced.
For example, MPLS TP Tunnels are bidirectional in nature and could be used with non IP identifiers for the tunnel endpoints.
As the existing MPLS TE STD MIB and GMPLS TE STD MIB were defined mainly to support unidirectional tunnels and signaled co routed bidirectional tunnel definitions, respectively, these existing MIB modules are not sufficient to capture all the characteristics of the tunnels.
Hence, enhancing the MIB modules to support MPLS TP Tunnels is required.
As most of the attributes of MPLS Traffic Engineering tunnels are also applicable to MPLS TP Tunnels, it is optimal to reuse and extend the existing MIB module definition instead of defining a new MIB module.
This document defines four additional MIB modules, namely, MPLS TE EXT STD MIB, MPLS TC EXT STD MIB, MPLS ID STD MIB, and MPLS LSR EXT STD MIB.
As these additional MIB modules are required for MPLS TP functionality, these are all defined in this document, instead of being documented separately.
The MIBs in this document satisfy the following requirements and constraints:
The MIB modules, taken together, support statically configured and dynamically signaled point to point, co routed bidirectional and associated bidirectional tunnels.
The MPLS tunnels need not be interfaces, but it is possible to configure an MPLS TP Tunnel as an interface.
The same ifType 150, as defined in Section 8 of [RFC3812], will be used for MPLS TP Tunnels as well.
The mplsTunnelTable [RFC3812] is also to be used for MPLS TP Tunnels.
New MPLS TP specific textual conventions and identifiers are required.
The mplsTunnelTable is sparsely extended to support objects specific to MPLS TP Tunnels.
A node configuration table (mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable), as detailed in Section 6.2.1, below, is used to translate the Global ID::Node ID or ICC Operator
ID::Node ID to the local identifier in order to index the mplsTunnelTable.
The mplsXCTable is sparsely extended to support objects specific to MPLS TP XC (Cross Connect).
The MIB module supports persistent, as well as non persistent, tunnels.
Outline Traffic Engineering support for the MPLS TP Tunnels requires the setup of the co routed or associated bidirectional tunnel.
The tables and MIB modules that are mentioned in the below subsections support the functionality described in [RFC5654] and [RFC6370].
These tables support both IP compatible and ICC based tunnel configurations.
Figure 1, below, depicts how the table references are followed in this MIB.
Table References of MIB Modules 6.1.
Four MIB modules are extended to support MPLS TP Tunnels, namely, MPLS TE EXT STD MIB, MPLS TC EXT STD MIB, MPLS ID STD MIB, and MPLS LSR EXT STD MIB.
The following section provides the summary of changes.
Summary of MIB Module Changes Node configuration table (mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable) for setting the local identifier for Tunnel Ingress and Egress identifiers.
Node IP map table (mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapTable) for querying the local identifier for a given Global ID and Node ID.
Node ICC map table (mplsTunnelExtNodeIccMapTable) for querying the local identifier for a given ICC Operator ID and Node ID.
Tunnel extension table (mplsTunnelExtTable) for setting up MPLS TP Tunnels with sparse extension of mplsTunnelTable.
Textual conventions and object definitions for MPLS TP Tunnels.
Cross connect extension table (mplsXCExtTable) for setting up the MPLS TP LSPs.
These tables are described in the subsequent sections.
The TE MIB module extensions and details of the tables are described in the following sections.
The mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable is used to assign a local identifier for a given ICC Operator
ID::Node ID combination as defined in [RFC6923] and [RFC6370], respectively.
The CC is a string of two characters, each being an uppercase Basic Latin alphabetic (i.e., A Z).
The ICC is a string of one to six characters, each an uppercase Basic Latin alphabetic (i.e., A Z) or numeric (i.e., 0 9).
All of the characters are encoded using [T.50] as described in [RFC6370].
In the IP compatible mode, Global ID::Node ID, is used to uniquely identify a node.
ID::Node ID or Global ID::Node
, there is a unique entry in the table representing a node.
As the regular TE tunnels use the IP address as the LSR ID, the local identifier should be below the first valid IP address, which is 16777216[1.0.0.0].
Every node is assigned a local identifier within a range of 0 to 16777215.
This local identifier is used for indexing into mplsTunnelTable as mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and mplsTunnelEgressLSRId.
For IP compatible environments, an MPLS TP Tunnel is indexed by Tunnel Index, Tunnel Instance, Source Global ID, Source Node ID, Destination Global ID, and Destination Node ID.
For ICC based environments, an MPLS TP Tunnel is indexed by Tunnel Index, Tunnel Instance, Source CC, Source ICC, Source Node ID, Destination CC, Destination ICC, and Destination Node ID.
As mplsTunnelTable is indexed by mplsTunnelIndex, mplsTunnelInstance, mplsTunnelIngressLSRId, and mplsTunnelEgressLSRId, the MPLS TP tunnel identifiers cannot be used directly.
The mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable will be used to store an entry for ICC Operator ID::Node ID or Global
ID::Node ID with a local identifier to be used as the LSR ID in mplsTunnelTable.
mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapTable The read only mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapTable is used to query the local identifier assigned and stored in mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for a given Global ID::Node ID.
In order to query the local identifier, in the IP compatible mode, this table is indexed with Global ID::Node ID.
In the IP compatible mode for a TP tunnel, Global ID::Node ID is used.
A separate query is made to get the local identifier of both Ingress and Egress Global ID::Node ID identifiers.
These local identifiers are used as mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and mplsTunnelEgressLSRId when indexing mplsTunnelTable.
is used to query the local identifier assigned and stored in the mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for a given ICC Operator ID::Node ID.
A separate query is made to get the local identifier of both Ingress and Egress ICC Operator
These local identifiers are used as mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and mplsTunnelEgressLSRId when indexing mplsTunnelTable.
This table sparsely extends the mplsTunnelTable in order to support MPLS TP Tunnels with additional objects.
All the additional attributes specific to supporting a TP tunnel are contained in this extended table and could be accessed with the mplsTunnelTable indices.
The gmplsTunnelReversePerfTable [RFC4802] should be used to provide per tunnel packet performance information for the reverse direction of a bidirectional tunnel.
It can be seen as supplementing the mplsTunnelPerfTable, which augments the mplsTunnelTable.
MPLS TC EXT STD MIB
This MIB module contains textual conventions for LSPs of MPLS based transport networks.
This MIB module contains identifier object definitions for MPLS Traffic Engineering in transport networks.
MPLS LSR EXT STD MIB
This MIB module contains generic object definitions (including the mplsXCExtTable   cross connect extension table   for setting up the MPLS TP LSPs with sparse extension of mplsXCTable) for MPLS LSRs in transport networks.
This document follows the RowPointer usage as described in Section 10 of [RFC3812].
A new RowPointer object, mplsTunnelExtOppositeDirPtr, is added to mplsTunnelExtTable of MPLS TE EXT STD MIB module.
This RowPointer object points to the tunnel entry in the opposite direction.
Two additional RowPointers objects, mplsXCExtTunnelPointer and mplsXCExtOppositeDirXCPtr, are added to the mplsXCExtTable of MPLS LSR EXT STD MIB.
The RowPointer mplsXCExtTunnelPointer is a read only object used to indicate the back pointer to the tunnel entry.
The RowPointer mplsXCExtOppositeDirXCPtr object points to the opposite direction XC entry.
If either of these RowPointers return zeroDotZero, it implies that there is no entry associated with the RowPointer object.
This section provides an overview of the relationships between the MPLS TP TE MIB module and other MPLS MIB modules.
The arrows in the following diagram show a "depends on" relationship.
A relationship of "MIB module A depends on MIB module B" means that MIB module
A uses an object, object identifier, or textual convention defined in MIB module B, or that MIB module
A contains a pointer (index or RowPointer) to an object in MIB module B. MPLS TC EXT STD MIB ^
MPLS LSR EXT STD MIB Figure 2:
Thus: All the new MPLS extension MIB modules depend on MPLS TC EXT STD MIB.
MPLS ID STD MIB contains references to objects in MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812].
MPLS TE EXT STD MIB contains references to objects in MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812].
MPLS LSR EXT STD MIB contains references to objects in MPLS LSR STD MIB [RFC3813].
The mplsTunnelExtTable sparsely extends the mplsTunnelTable of MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812].
This helps in associating the reverse  direction tunnel information.
The mplsXCExtTable sparsely extends the mplsXCTable of MPLS
This helps in pointing back to the tunnel entry for easy tunnel access from the XC entry.
Note that all of the MIB modules shown above in the figure also have a dependency on MPLS TC STD MIB.
Dependencies between MIB Module Tables The tables in MPLS TE EXT STD MIB are related as shown on the diagram below.
The arrows indicate a reference from one table to another.
Dependencies between MIB Module Tables
An existing mplsTunnelTable uses the mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable table to map the Global
ID::Node ID and/or ICC Operator
ID::Node ID with the local number
in order to accommodate in the existing tunnel table's ingress/egress LSR ID.
The new mplsTunnelExtTable provides the reverse direction LSP information for the existing tunnel table so that bidirectional LSPs can be created.
The mplsXCExtTable sparsely extends the mplsLsrXCTable to provide backward reference to tunnel entry.
Example of MPLS TP Tunnel Setup
In this section, we provide an example of configuring MPLS TP bidirectional tunnels with IP tunnel identifiers.
This example provides the usage of the MPLS TP Tunnel MIB along with the extended MIB modules introduced in this document.
Do note that a MPLS TP Tunnel could be set up statically as well as signaled via the control plane.
This example considers accessing MIB objects on a head end for static and signaled MPLS TP Tunnels.
This section shows the configuration of the forward  and reverse direction MPLS TP LSPs that run between East and West, and vice versa.
Only objects relevant to MPLS TP Tunnels are illustrated here.
Non IP Egress LSR ID (Index to the table)
This will create an entry in the mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for a Global ID::Node ID.
The Ingress and Egress LSR are represented by separate entries.
The following read only mplsTunnelExtNodeIpMapTable table is populated automatically upon creating an entry in mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable, and this table is used to retrieve the local identifier for the given Global ID::Node ID.
Example of MPLS TP Static Co routed Bidirectional Tunnel Setup
The following denotes the co routed bidirectional tunnel "head" entry.
if co routed bidirectional tunnel is managed by single tunnel   entry
Set both the Ingress and Egress LocalId objects to TRUE, as   this tunnel entry uses the local identifiers.
Next, we must create the appropriate in segment and out segment entries.
These are done in [RFC3813] using the mplsInSegmentTable and mplsOutSegmentTable.
RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column.
Next, two cross connect entries are created in the mplsXCTable of the MPLS LSR STD MIB [RFC3813], thereby associating the newly created segments together.
unique ID   only a single outgoing label mplsXCLabelStackIndex
unique ID   only a single outgoing label mplsXCLabelStackIndex
This table entry is extended by an entry in the mplsXCExtTable.
Note that the nature of the 'extends' relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the mplsXCExtTable has the same index values as the entry in the mplsXCTable.
Example of MPLS TP Static Associated Bidirectional Tunnel Setup
The MPLS TP associated bidirectional tunnel
is implemented by two different unidirectional tunnels (Forward and Reverse LSPs), and these are associated together using mplsTunnelExtTable.
Two different tunnel entries to provide the forward and reverse directions MAY be used for co routed bidirectional tunnels as well.
The following denotes the associated bidirectional forward tunnel "head" entry:
Set both the Ingress and Egress LocalId objects to TRUE, as   this tunnel entry uses the local identifiers.
unique ID   only a single outgoing label mplsXCLabelStackIndex
For the associated bidirectional reverse LSP, in mplsTunnelExtTable: { mplsTunnelExtOppositeDirPtr
Set both the Ingress and Egress LocalId objects to TRUE, as   this tunnel entry uses the local identifiers.
mplsTunnelExtIngressLSRLocalIdValid    true, mplsTunnelExtEgressLSRLocalIdValid   true }
Next, we must create the appropriate in segment and out segment entries.
These are done in [RFC3813] using the mplsInSegmentTable and mplsOutSegmentTable.
Next, two cross connect entries are created in the mplsXCTable of the MPLS LSR STD MIB [RFC3813], thereby associating the newly created segments together.
unique ID   only a single outgoing label mplsXCLabelStackIndex
This table entry is extended by an entry in the mplsXCExtTable.
Note that the nature of the 'extends' relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the mplsXCExtTable has the same index values as the entry in the mplsXCTable.
Example of MPLS TP Signaled Co routed Bidirectional Tunnel Setup
The following denotes the co routed bidirectional tunnel "head" entry.
In intermediate and tail end nodes, the tunnel table and its associated tables are created by the local management subsystem (e.g., agent) when the MPLS TP Tunnel is signaled successfully.
Refer to [RFC3812] and [RFC4802] for examples of signaled tunnel table configuration.
For the intermediate and tail end nodes,   the local management entity is expected to pick the first   available local identifier that is not used in mplsTunnelTable.
Local map number created in mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable for   Egress LSR ID
Set both the Ingress and Egress LocalId objects to TRUE, as   this tunnel entry uses the local identifiers.
Next, we must create the appropriate in segment and out segment entries.
These are done in [RFC3813] using the mplsInSegmentTable and mplsOutSegmentTable.
The forward direction mplsOutSegmentTable will be populated automatically based on the information received from the signaling protocol.
The reverse direction mplsOutSegmentTable will be populated automatically based on the information received from the signaling protocol.
Next, two cross connect entries are created in the mplsXCTable of the MPLS LSR STD MIB [RFC3813], thereby associating the newly created segments together.
The forward direction mplsXCEntry will be populated as soon as the forward path label information is available.
The reverse direction mplsXCEntry will be populated as soon as the reverse path label information is available.
This table entry is extended by an entry in the mplsXCExtTable.
Note that the nature of the 'extends' relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the mplsXCExtTable has the same index values as the entry in the mplsXCTable.
Once the forward path information is negotiated using the signaling protocol, the forward direction mplsXCExtEntry will be created for associating the opposite direction XC entry and tunnel table entry.
Once the reverse path information is negotiated using the signaling protocol, the reverse direction mplsXCExtEntry will be created for associating the opposite direction XC entry and tunnel table entry.

This table is created to reuse the existing mplsTunnelTable for MPLS based transport network tunnels also.
Since the MPLS tunnel's Ingress/Egress LSR identifiers' size (Unsigned32) value is not compatible for MPLS TP Tunnel,
i.e., Global ID::Node ID of size 8 bytes and ICC Operator ID::Node ID of size 12 bytes
, there exists a need to map the Global ID::Node ID or ICC Operator
ID::Node ID with the local identifier of size 4 bytes (Unsigned32) value in order to index (Ingress/Egress LSR identifier)
"An entry in this table represents a mapping identification for the operator or service provider to a node or an LSR.
As per RFC 6370, IP compatible mapping is represented as Global ID::Node ID.
As per RFC 6923, the CC and the ICC form the ICC Operator ID as CC::ICC, and ICC compatible mapping is represented as ICC Operator ID::Node ID.

Security Considerations This document follows the security considerations mentioned in Section 12 of [RFC3812].
These security considerations are also applicable to the MIB objects and tables defined in this document, which are identified as below.
The common objects mplsIdGlobalId, mplsIdNodeId, mplsIdCc, and mplsIdIcc are used to define the identity of an MPLS TP node for OAM purposes.
If write access is allowed to these objects it offers the possibility for incorrect values to be entered that will confuse the information returned by OAM functions and possibly prevent OAM from operating correctly.
Furthermore, there is the possibility of inducing one node to impersonate another with confusing results.
mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable, mplsTunnelExtTable and mplsXCExtTable collectively contain objects to provision MPLS TP Tunnels, tunnel hops, and tunnel resources.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
mplsTunnelExtNodeConfigTable, mplsTunnelExtTable, and mplsXCExtTable collectively show the characteristics of the MPLS TP tunnel network topology.
If an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
As described in [RFC4221] and [RFC6639], and as requested in the MPLS TC STD MIB [RFC3811], MPLS related Standards Track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
There are four MPLS MIB modules contained in this document; each of the following subsections lists a new assignment made by IANA under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in [RFC5226].
IANA Considerations for MPLS TC EXT STD MIB IANA has assigned the OID { mplsStdMIB 17 } to the MPLS TC EXT STD MIB module specified in this document.
ID STD MIB IANA has assigned the OID { mplsStdMIB 18 } to the MPLS ID STD MIB module specified in this document.
LSR EXT STD MIB IANA has assigned the OID { mplsStdMIB 19 } to the MPLS LSR EXT STD MIB module specified in this document.
IANA Considerations for MPLS TE EXT STD MIB IANA has assigned the OID { mplsStdMIB 20 } to the MPLS TE EXT STD MIB module specified in this document.
