- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   One of the key services required to use the Internet is\
    \ name\n   resolution.  Name resolution is the process of translating a symbolic\n\
    \   name into some object or set of objects to which the name refers,\n   most\
    \ typically one or more IP addresses.  These names are often\n   referred to as\
    \ \"domain names\".  When reading this document, care must\n   be taken not to\
    \ assume that the term domain name implies the use of\n   the Domain Name System\
    \ [RFC1034] for resolving these names.  An\n   excellent presentation on this\
    \ topic can be found in Domain Names\n   [DOMAIN-NAMES].\n   \"Special-Use Domain\
    \ Names\" [RFC6761] created the \"Special-Use Domain\n   Names\" IANA registry\
    \ [SDO-IANA-SUDR], defined policies for adding to\n   the registry, and made some\
    \ suggestions about how those policies\n   might be implemented.  Since the publication\
    \ of RFC 6761, the IETF\n   has been asked to designate several new Special-Use\
    \ Domain Names in\n   this registry.  During the evaluation process for these\
    \ Special-Use\n   Domain Names, the IETF encountered several different sorts of\
    \ issues.\n   Because of this, the IETF has decided to investigate the problem\
    \ and\n   decide if and how the process defined in RFC 6761 can be improved, or\n\
    \   whether it should be deprecated.  The IETF DNSOP Working Group\n   charter\
    \ was extended to include conducting a review of the process\n   for adding names\
    \ to the registry that is defined in RFC 6761.  This\n   document is a product\
    \ of that review.\n   Based on current ICANN and IETF practice, including RFC\
    \ 6761, there\n   are several different types of names in the root of the Domain\n\
    \   Namespace:\n   o  Names reserved by the IETF for technical purposes\n   o\
    \  Names assigned by ICANN to the public DNS root; some names\n      reserved\
    \ by the IETF for technical purposes may appear in the\n      global DNS root\
    \ for reasons pertaining to the operation of the DNS\n   o  ICANN Reserved Names;\
    \ names that may not be applied for as TLDs\n      (see \"Reserved Names\" and\
    \ \"Treatment of Country or Territory\n      Names\" (Sections 2.2.1.2.1 and 2.2.1.4.1,\
    \ respectively) of\n      [SDO-ICANN-DAG]).\n   o  Names used by other organizations\
    \ without following established\n      processes\n   o  Names that are unused\
    \ and are available for assignment to one of\n      the previous categories\n\
    \   This document presents a list, derived from a variety of sources,\n   including\
    \ discussion in the IETF DNSOP Working Group, of the problems\n   associated with\
    \ the assignment of Special-Use Domain Names.  The list\n   is intended to be\
    \ an unfiltered compilation of issues.  In support of\n   its analysis of the\
    \ particular set of issues described here, the\n   document also includes descriptions\
    \ of existing practice as it\n   relates to the use of domain names, a brief history\
    \ of domain names,\n   and some observations by various IETF participants who\
    \ have\n   experience with various aspects of the current situation.\n"

- title: 3.  Problems Associated with Special-Use Domain Names
  contents:
  - "3.  Problems Associated with Special-Use Domain Names\n   This section presents\
    \ a list of problems that have been identified\n   with respect to the assignment\
    \ of Special-Use Domain Names.\n   Solutions to these problems, including their\
    \ costs or trade-offs, are\n   out of scope for this document and will be covered\
    \ in a separate\n   document.  New problems that might be created in the process\
    \ of\n   solving problems described in this document are also out of scope:\n\
    \   these problems are expected to be addressed in the process of\n   evaluating\
    \ potential solutions.\n   Special-Use Domain Names exist to solve a variety of\
    \ problems.  This\n   document has two goals: enumerate all of the problems that\
    \ have been\n   identified to which Special-Use Domain Names are a solution and\n\
    \   enumerate all of the problems that have been raised in the process of\n  \
    \ trying to use RFC 6761 as it was intended.  As some of those problems\n   may\
    \ fall into both categories, this document makes no attempt to\n   categorize\
    \ the problems.\n   There is a broad diversity of opinion about this set of problems.\n\
    \   Not every participant agrees that each of the problems enumerated in\n   this\
    \ document is actually a problem.  This document takes no position\n   on the\
    \ relative validity of the various problems that have been\n   enumerated, nor\
    \ on the organization responsible for addressing each\n   individual problem,\
    \ if it is to be addressed.  This document only\n   enumerates the problems, provides\
    \ the reader with context for\n   thinking about them, and provides a context\
    \ for future discussion of\n   solutions, regardless of whether such solutions\
    \ may work for IETF,\n   ICANN, IANA, or some other group.\n   The list of problems\
    \ is not presented in order of importance; numbers\n   are assigned so that each\
    \ problem can easily be referenced by number,\n   not to indicate priority.  The\
    \ list of problems is as follows:\n   1.   Although the IETF and ICANN have a\
    \ liaison relationship through\n        which special-use allocations can be discussed,\
    \ there exists no\n        formal process for coordinating these allocations (see\n\
    \        Section 4.1.3).  The lack of coordination complicates the\n        management\
    \ of the root of the Domain Namespace and could lead to\n        conflicts in\
    \ name assignments [SDO-ICANN-SAC090].\n   2.   There is no explicit scoping as\
    \ to what can constitute a\n        \"technical use\" [RFC2860] and what cannot;\
    \ there is also no\n        consensus within the IETF as to what this term means.\n\
    \   3.   Not all developers of protocols on the Internet agree that\n        authority\
    \ over the entire Domain Namespace should reside solely\n        with the IETF\
    \ and ICANN.\n   4.   Although the IETF and ICANN nominally have authority over\
    \ this\n        namespace, neither organization can enforce that authority over\n\
    \        any third party who wants to just start using a subset of the\n     \
    \   namespace.  Such parties may observe that the IETF has never\n        asserted\
    \ control or authority over what protocols are \"allowed\"\n        on the Internet,\
    \ and that the principle of \"permissionless\n        innovation\" suggests there\
    \ should be a way for people to include\n        new uses of domain names in new\
    \ protocols and applications.\n   5.   Organizations do in fact sometimes use\
    \ subsets of the Domain\n        Namespace without following established processes.\
    \  Reasons a\n        third party might do this include:\n        1.  Lack of\
    \ knowledge that a process exists for assigning such\n            names.\n   \
    \     2.  Intended use is covered by the gTLD process [SDO-ICANN-DAG],\n     \
    \       but no gTLD process is ongoing.\n        3.  Intended use is covered by\
    \ the gTLD process, but the third\n            party doesn't want to pay a fee.\n\
    \        4.  Intended use is covered by some IETF process, but the third\n   \
    \         party doesn't want to follow the process.\n        5.  Intended use\
    \ is covered by an ICANN or IETF process, but the\n            third party expects\
    \ that the outcome will be refusal or non-\n            action.\n        6.  Lack\
    \ of knowledge that a name intended to be used only\n            locally may nevertheless\
    \ leak.\n        7.  Lack of knowledge that a name used locally with informal\n\
    \            allocation may subsequently be allocated formally, creating\n   \
    \         operational problems.\n   6.   There is demand for more than one name\
    \ resolution protocol for\n        domain names.  Domain names contain no metadata\
    \ to indicate\n        which protocol to use to resolve them.  Domain name resolution\n\
    \        APIs do not provide a way to specify which protocol to use.\n   7.  \
    \ When a Special-Use Domain Name is added to the \"Special-Use\n        Domain\
    \ Names\" registry, not all software that processes such\n        names will understand\
    \ the special use of that name.  In many\n        cases, name resolution software\
    \ will use the Domain Name System\n        for resolution of names not known to\
    \ have a special use.\n        Consequently, any such use will result in queries\
    \ for Special-\n        Use Domain Names being sent to Domain Name System authoritative\n\
    \        servers.  These queries may constitute an operational problem\n     \
    \   for operators of root zone authoritative name servers.  These\n        queries\
    \ may also inadvertently reveal private information\n        through the contents\
    \ of the query, which is a privacy\n        consideration.\n   8.   Some protocol\
    \ developers have assumed that they could not\n        succeed in getting a name\
    \ assigned through the IETF using the\n        process defined in RFC 6761.  This\
    \ is because when the IETF has\n        attempted to follow the process defined\
    \ in RFC 6761, it has been\n        slow and uncertain.  For example, the process\
    \ of assigning the\n        first new name ('.local') using the process defined\
    \ in RFC 6761\n        took more than ten years from beginning to end: longer\
    \ by a\n        factor of ten than any other part of the protocol development\n\
    \        process (largely because this ten years included time to develop\n  \
    \      the process as well as use it).  Other uses of the process have\n     \
    \   proceeded more smoothly, but there is a reasonably justified\n        perception\
    \ that using this process is likely to be slow and\n        difficult, with an\
    \ uncertain outcome.\n   9.   There is strong resistance within the IETF to assigning\
    \ domain\n        names to resolution systems outside of the DNS, for a variety\
    \ of\n        reasons:\n        1.  It requires a mechanism for identifying which\
    \ set of\n            resolution processes is required in order to resolve a\n\
    \            particular name.\n        2.  Assertion of authority: there is a\
    \ sense that the Domain\n            Namespace is \"owned\" by the IETF or by\
    \ ICANN, so, if a name\n            is claimed without following their processes,\
    \ the person or\n            entity that claimed that name should suffer some\
    \ consequence\n            that would, presumably, deter future circumvention\
    \ of the\n            official processes.\n        3.  More than one name resolution\
    \ protocol is bad, in the sense\n            that a single protocol is less complicated\
    \ to implement and\n            deploy.\n        4.  The semantics of alternative\
    \ resolution protocols may differ\n            from the DNS protocol; DNS has\
    \ the concept of RRtypes,\n            whereas other protocols may not support\
    \ RRtypes or may\n            support some entirely different data structuring\
    \ mechanism.\n        5.  If there is an IETF process through which a TLD can\
    \ be\n            assigned at zero cost other than time, this process will be\n\
    \            used as an alternative to the more costly process of getting\n  \
    \          the name registered through ICANN.\n        6.  A name might be assigned\
    \ for a particular purpose when a\n            more general use of the name would\
    \ be more beneficial.\n        7.  If the IETF assigns a name that some third\
    \ party or parties\n            believe belongs to them in some way, the IETF\
    \ could become\n            embroiled in an expensive dispute with those parties.\n\
    \   10.  If there were no process for assigning names for technical use\n    \
    \    through the IETF, there is a concern that protocols that require\n      \
    \  such names would not be able to get them.\n   11.  In some cases where the\
    \ IETF has made assignments through the\n        process defined in RFC 6761,\
    \ technical mistakes have been made\n        due to misunderstandings as to the\
    \ actual process that RFC 6761\n        specifies (e.g., treating the list of\
    \ suggested considerations\n        for assigning a name as a set of requirements,\
    \ all of which must\n        be met).  In other cases, the IETF has made de facto\
    \ assignments\n        of Special-Use Domain Names without following the process\
    \ in RFC\n        6761 (see [RFC7050] and [RFC7788]).\n   12.  There are several\
    \ Top-Level Domain Names that are in use without\n        due process for a variety\
    \ of purposes.  The status of these\n        names need to be clarified and recorded\
    \ to avoid future disputes\n        about their use [SDO-ICANN-COLL].\n   13.\
    \  In principle, the process defined in RFC 6761 could be used to\n        document\
    \ the existence of domain names that are not safe to\n        assign and provide\
    \ information on how those names are used in\n        practice.  However, attempts\
    \ to use RFC 6761 to accomplish this\n        documentation have not been successful\
    \ (for example, see\n        \"Additional Reserved Top Level Domains\" [RESERVED-TLDS]\
    \ and\n        Section 4.2.7 of this document).  One side effect of the lack of\n\
    \        documentation is that any mitigation effect on the root name\n      \
    \  servers or on privacy considerations has been missed.\n   14.  A domain name\
    \ can be identified as either a DNS name by placing\n        it in the DNS zone(s)\
    \ or a Special-Use Domain Name by adding it\n        to the IANA registry.  Some\
    \ names are in both places; for\n        example, some locally served zone names\
    \ are in DNS zones and\n        documented in the \"Special-Use Domain Names\"\
    \ registry.  At\n        present, the only way a domain name can be added to the\n\
    \        \"Special-Use Domain Name\" registry is for the IETF to take\n      \
    \  responsibility for the name and designate it for \"technical\n        use\"\
    .  There are other potential uses for domain names that\n        should be recorded\
    \ in the registry, but for which the IETF\n        should not take responsibility.\n\
    \   15.  In some cases, the IETF may see the need to document that a name\n  \
    \      is in use without claiming that the use of the name is the\n        IETF's\
    \ particular use of the name.  No mechanism exists in the\n        current registry\
    \ to mark names in this way.\n   16.  During any of the review stages of a document,\
    \ there is no\n        formal process in which a check is made to ensure that\
    \ the\n        document does not unintentionally violate the IETF process for\n\
    \        adding Special-Use Domain Names to the registry, as was the\n       \
    \ case, for example, in RFC 7788 [RFC7788].\n   17.  Use of the registry is inconsistent\
    \ -- some Special-Use Domain\n        Name RFCs specifically add registry entries,\
    \ some don't; some\n        specify how and whether special-use name delegations\
    \ should be\n        done, some don't.\n   18.  There exists no safe, non-process-violating\
    \ mechanism for ad hoc\n        assignment of Special-Use Domain Names.\n   19.\
    \  It is generally assumed that protocols that need a Special-Use\n        Domain\
    \ Name need a mnemonic, single-label, human-readable\n        Special-Use Domain\
    \ Name for use in user interfaces such as\n        command lines or URL entry\
    \ fields.  While this assumption is\n        correct in some cases, it is likely\
    \ not correct in all cases,\n        for example, in applications where the domain\
    \ name is never\n        visible to a user.\n   20.  RFC 6761 uses the term \"\
    domain name\" to describe the thing for\n        which special uses are registered.\
    \  This creates a great deal of\n        confusion because some readers take \"\
    domain name\" to imply the\n        use of the DNS protocol.\n   21.  The use\
    \ of DNSSEC with Special-Use Domain Names is an open\n        issue.  There is\
    \ no consensus or guidance about how to use\n        DNSSEC with various classes\
    \ of Special-Use Domain Names.\n        Considerations in the use of DNSSEC with\
    \ Special-Use Domain\n        Names include:\n        1.  What class of Special-Use\
    \ Domain Name is under\n            consideration: non-DNS, locally served zone,\
    \ or other?\n        2.  Does the Special-Use Domain Name require a delegation\
    \ in the\n            root zone; if so, should that delegation be signed or not?\n\
    \            If there is no delegation, then this will be treated by\n       \
    \     validating resolvers as a secure denial of existence for\n            that\
    \ zone.  This would not be appropriate for a name being\n            resolved\
    \ using the DNS protocol.\n        3.  A process would be required through which\
    \ the IETF can cause\n            a delegation in the root zone to be instantiated.\n\
    \        4.  What are the recommended practices for using DNS with the\n     \
    \       specific Special-Use Domain Name?\n   The above list represents the current\
    \ understanding of the authors as\n   to the complete set of problems that have\
    \ been identified during\n   discussion by the working group on this topic.  The\
    \ remainder of this\n   document provides additional context that will be needed\
    \ for\n   reasoning related to these problems.\n"

  - "4.  Existing Practice regarding Special-Use Domain Names\n   There are three\
    \ primary (see Section 4.1) and numerous secondary\n   (Section 4.2) documents\
    \ to consider when thinking about the Special-\n   Use Domain Names process.\n\
    \   How names are resolved is ambiguous, in the sense that some names are\n  \
    \ Special-Use Domain Names that require special handling and some names\n   can\
    \ be resolved using the DNS protocol with no special handling.\n   The assignment\
    \ of Internet Names is not under the sole control of any\n   one organization.\
    \  The IETF has authority in some cases, but only\n   with respect to \"technical\
    \ uses\".  At present, ICANN is the\n   designated administrator of the root zone;\
    \ but generally not of zones\n   other than the root zone.  Neither of these authorities\
    \ can, in any\n   practical sense, exclude the practice of ad hoc use of names.\n\
    \   Unauthorized use of domain names can be accomplished by any entity\n   that\
    \ has control over one or more name servers or resolvers, in the\n   context of\
    \ any hosts and services that entity operates.  It can also\n   be accomplished\

  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  IAB Technical Comment on the Unique DNS Root\n   [RFC2826] is not an\
    \ IETF consensus document, and it appears to have\n   been written to address\
    \ a different problem than the Special-Use\n   Domain Name problem.  However,\
    \ it speaks directly to several of the\n   key issues that must be considered,\
    \ and, coming as it does from the\n   IAB, it is rightly treated as having significant\
    \ authority despite\n   not being an IETF consensus document.\n   This document\
    \ should be considered required reading for IETF\n   participants who wish to\
    \ express an informed opinion on the topic of\n   Special-Use Domain Names.  The\
    \ main points that appear relevant to\n   the Special-Use Domain Names problem\
    \ are:\n   o  The Internet requires a globally unique namespace: a namespace in\n\
    \      which any given name refers to the same information (has the same\n   \
    \   meaning) no matter who requests that information and no matter\n      from\
    \ which specific name server they request it.\n   o  Private networks may operate\
    \ private namespaces, with names that\n      have meanings only locally (within\
    \ the private network), but they\n      still require that names in the public\
    \ namespace be globally\n      unique.\n   o  The Domain Name System [RFC1035]\
    \ is not the only protocol that may\n      be used for resolving domain names.\n\
    \   o  Users cannot be assumed to know how to distinguish between\n      symbolic\
    \ references that have local meaning and references that\n      have global meaning.\
    \  Therefore, users may share references that\n      incorporate domain names\
    \ with no global meaning (for example, a\n      URL of 'http://mysite.example.corp',\
    \ where 'example.corp' is a\n      domain used privately and informally as described\
    \ in\n      [SDO-ICANN-COLL]).\n   o  While such a reference in the user's context\
    \ refers to the object\n      the user wishes to share, when the reference is\
    \ used in a\n      different context, it could refer either to some different\
    \ object\n      in the recipient's context or to no object at all.  The effect\
    \ of\n      this reference escaping the context in which it is valid is that\n\
    \      the user's intended communication will not be able to be\n      understood\
    \ by the recipients of the communication.\n      This same problem can also occur\
    \ when a single user copies a name\n      from one context in which it has one\
    \ meaning into a different\n      context in which it has a different meaning\
    \ -- for example,\n      copying a '.onion' domain name out of a Tor Browser [TOR],\
    \ where\n      it has meaning, and pasting this name into an SSH client that\n\
    \      doesn't support connecting over the Tor network.\n   We can summarize the\
    \ advice in this document as follows:\n   o  Domain names with unambiguous global\
    \ meaning are preferable to\n      domain names with local meaning that will be\
    \ ambiguous.\n      Nevertheless, both globally meaningful and locally special\
    \ names\n      are in use and must be supported.\n   o  At the time of the writing\
    \ of this document, the IAB was of the\n      opinion that there might well be\
    \ more than one name resolution\n      protocol used to resolve domain names.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Special-Use Domain Names
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Special-Use Domain Names\n   The second important document is \"Special-Use\
    \ Domain Names\"\n   [RFC6761].  RFC 6761 represents the current IETF consensus\
    \ on\n   designating and recording Special-Use Domain Names.  The IETF has\n \
    \  experienced problems with the designation process described in RFC\n   6761;\
    \ these concerns motivate this document.  Familiarity with RFC\n   6761 is a prerequisite\
    \ for having an informed opinion on the topic of\n   Special-Use Domain Names.\n\
    \   RFC 6761 defines two aspects of Special-Use Domain Names: designating\n  \
    \ a domain name to have a special purpose and registering that special\n   use\
    \ in the \"Special-Use Domain Names\" registry.  The designation\n   process is\
    \ defined in a single sentence (RFC 6761, Section 4):\n      If it is determined\
    \ that special handling of a name is required in\n      order to implement some\
    \ desired new functionality, then an IETF\n      \"Standards Action\" or \"IESG\
    \ Approval\" specification [RFC5226] MUST\n      be published describing the new\
    \ functionality.\n   This sentence requires that any designation of a Special-Use\
    \ Domain\n   Name is subject to the same open review and consensus process as\
    \ used\n   to produce and publish all other IETF specifications.\n   The registration\
    \ process is a purely mechanical process, in which the\n   existence of the newly\
    \ designated Special-Use Domain Name is\n   recorded, with a pointer to a section\
    \ in the relevant specification\n   document that defines the ways in which special\
    \ handling is to be\n   applied to the name.\n   RFC 6761 provides the process\
    \ whereby \"Multicast DNS\" [RFC6762]\n   designated '.local' as a Special-Use\
    \ Domain Name and included it in\n   the \"Special-Use Domain Names\" registry.\
    \  RFC 6761 also enumerates a\n   set of names that were previously used or defined\
    \ to have special\n   uses prior to its publication.  Since there had been no\
    \ registry for\n   these names prior to the publication of RFC 6761, the documents\n\
    \   defining these names could not have added them to the registry.\n   Several\
    \ important points to think about with respect to RFC 6761 are:\n   o  A Special-Use\
    \ Domain Name may be a name that should be resolved\n      using the DNS protocol\
    \ with no special handling.  An example of\n      this is 'in-addr.arpa' (which\
    \ is an example of a Special-Use\n      Domain Name that is not a TLD).\n   o\
    \  A Special-Use Domain Name may be a name that is resolved using the\n      DNS\
    \ protocol and that requires no special handling in the stub\n      resolver but\
    \ that requires special handling in the recursive\n      resolver.  An example\
    \ of this would be '10.in-addr.arpa.'.\n   o  A Special-Use Domain Name may be\
    \ a name that requires special\n      handling in the stub resolver.  An example\
    \ would be a Special-Use\n      Top-Level Domain Name like '.local', which acts\
    \ as a signal to\n      indicate that the local stub resolver should use a non-DNS\n\
    \      protocol for name resolution.\n   o  The current IETF consensus (from a\
    \ process perspective, not\n      necessarily from the perspective of what would\
    \ be consensus if the\n      IETF were to attempt to produce a new consensus document)\
    \ is that\n      all of these purposes for Special-Use Domain Names are valid.\n\
    \   In this case, the term \"stub resolver\" does not mean \"DNS protocol\n  \
    \ stub resolver\".  The stub resolver is the entity within a particular\n   software\
    \ stack that takes a question about a domain name and answers\n   it.  One way\
    \ a stub resolver can answer such a question is using the\n   DNS protocol; however,\
    \ it is in the stub resolver (as we are using\n   the term here) that the decision\
    \ as to whether to use a protocol (and\n   if so, which protocol) or a local database\
    \ of some sort is made.\n   RFC 6761 does not limit Special-Use Domain Names to\
    \ TLDs.  However,\n   at present, all Special-Use Domain Names registered in the\
    \ \"Special-\n   Use Domain Names\" registry [SDO-IANA-SUDR] either are intended\
    \ to be\n   resolved using the DNS protocol, are TLDs, or are both.  That is,\
    \ at\n   present there exist no Special-Use Domain Names that require special\n\
    \   handling by stub resolvers and which are not at the top level of the\n   naming\
    \ hierarchy.\n   One point to take from this is that there is already a requirement\
    \ in\n   RFC 6762 that when a stub resolver encounters the special label,\n  \
    \ 'local' as the rightmost label of a domain name, it can only use the\n   Multicast\
    \ DNS (mDNS) protocol to resolve that domain name.\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  MoU Concerning the Technical Work of IANA
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  MoU Concerning the Technical Work of IANA\n   There exists a Memorandum\
    \ of Understanding (MoU) [RFC2860] between\n   the IETF and ICANN that discusses\
    \ how names and numbers will be\n   managed through IANA.  This document is important\
    \ to the discussion\n   of Special-Use Domain Names because, while it delegates\
    \ authority for\n   managing the DNS Namespace generally to ICANN, it reserves\
    \ to the\n   IETF the authority that is then formalized in RFC 6761.  RFC 2860\n\
    \   specifically states:\n      Note that (a) assignments of domain names for\
    \ technical uses (such\n      as domain names for inverse DNS lookup), (b) assignments\
    \ of\n      specialised address blocks (such as multicast or anycast blocks),\n\
    \      and (c) experimental assignments are not considered to be policy\n    \
    \  issues, and shall remain subject to the provisions of this\n      Section 4.\n\
    \   The above text is an addendum to the following:\n      Two particular assigned\
    \ spaces present policy issues in addition\n      to the technical considerations\
    \ specified by the IETF: the\n      assignment of domain names, and the assignment\
    \ of IP address\n      blocks.  These policy issues are outside the scope of this\
    \ MOU.\n   The assignment of names in the DNS root zone, and the management of\n\
    \   the Domain Namespace, is by default a function that is performed by\n   ICANN.\
    \  However, the MoU specifically exempts domain names assigned\n   for technical\
    \ use and uses the example of domains used for inverse\n   DNS lookup.  Both 'in-addr.arpa'\
    \ and 'ip6.arpa' are in the \"Special-\n   Use Domain Names\" registry.\n   Implicit\
    \ in the MoU is the fact that the IETF and ICANN retain,\n   between them, sole\
    \ authority for assigning any names from the Domain\n   Namespace.  Both the IETF\
    \ and ICANN have internal processes for\n   making such assignments.\n   The point\

    \ Top-Level Domain Name [RFC7686] is important\n   because it is the most recent\
    \ IETF action on the topic of Special-Use\n   Domain Names; although it does not\
    \ set a new policy, the mere fact of\n   its publication is worth thinking about.\n\
    \   Two important points to consider about this document are that:\n   o  The\
    \ IETF gained consensus to publish it.\n   o  Devising a resolution to the situation\
    \ was constrained by at least\n      two factors.  First, there was no process\
    \ for allocating Special-\n      Use Domain Names at the time that the '.onion'\
    \ project started\n      using the name; at the time, and since the scope of use\
    \ of the\n      name was expected to be very constrained, the developers chose\
    \ to\n      allocate it unilaterally rather than asking the IETF or some other\n\
    \      Standards Development Organization (SDO) to create a new process.\n   \
    \   Second, for some time, the CA/Browser Forum [SDO-CABF] had been\n      issuing\
    \ certificates for what they referred to as \"internal\n      names\".  Internal\
    \ names are names allocated unilaterally for use\n      in site-specific contexts.\
    \  Issuing certificates for such names\n      came to be considered problematic,\
    \ since no formal process for\n      testing the validity of such names existed.\
    \  Consequently, the CA/\n      Browser Forum decided to phase out the use of\
    \ such names in\n      certificates [SDO-CABF-INT] and set a deadline after which\
    \ no new\n      certificates for such names would be issued [SDO-CABF-DEADLINE].\n\
    \      Because the '.onion' domain was allocated unilaterally, this would\n  \
    \    mean that certificates for subdomains of '.onion' could no longer\n     \
    \ be issued.\n      The IETF's designation of '.onion' as a Special-Use Top-Level\n\
    \      Domain Name was needed to facilitate the development of a\n      certificate\

  - "4.2.7.  Additional Reserved Top-Level Domains\n   \"Additional Reserved Top Level\
    \ Domains\" [RESERVED-TLDS] is an example\n   of a document that attempted to\
    \ reserve several TLDs identified by\n   ICANN as particularly at risk for collision\
    \ as Special-Use Domain\n   Names with no documented use.  This attempt failed.\n\
    \   Although the aforementioned document failed to gain consensus to be\n   published,\
    \ the need it was intended to fill still exists.\n   Unfortunately, although a\
    \ fair amount is known about the use of these\n   names, no RFC exists that describes\
    \ how they are used and why it\n   would be a problem to delegate them.  Additionally,\
    \ to the extent\n   that the uses being made of these names are valid, no document\
    \ exists\n   indicating when it might make sense to use them and when it would\
    \ not\n   make sense to use them.\n   RFC 7788 [RFC7788] defines the Top-Level\
    \ Domain Name '.home' for use\n   as the default name for name resolution relative\
    \ to a home network\n   context.  Although, as defined in RFC 7788, '.home' is\
    \ a Special-Use\n   Domain Name, RFC 7788 did not follow the process specified\
    \ in RFC\n   6761: it did not request that '.home' be added to the \"Special-Use\n\
    \   Domain Names\" registry.  This was recognized as a mistake and\n   resulted\
    \ in the posting of an errata report [Err4677].  Additionally,\n   '.home' is\
    \ an example of an attempt to reuse a domain name that has\n   already been put\
    \ into use for other purposes without following\n   established processes [SDO-ICANN-COLL],\
    \ which further complicates the\n   situation.  At the time RFC 8244 was written,\
    \ the IETF was developing\n   a solution to this problem.\n"
- title: 5.  History
  contents:
  - "5.  History\n   A newcomer to the problem of resolving domain names may be under\
    \ the\n   impression that the DNS sprang fully formed directly from Paul\n   Mockapetris'\
    \ head (as was the birth of Athena in Greek Mythology).\n   This is not the case.\
    \  At the time the IAB technical document was\n   written [RFC2826], memories\
    \ would have been fresh of the evolutionary\n   process that led to DNS' dominance\
    \ as a protocol for domain name\n   resolution.\n   In fact, in the early days\
    \ of the Internet, hostnames were resolved\n   using a text file, HOSTS.TXT, which\
    \ was maintained by a central\n   authority, the Network Information Center, and\
    \ distributed to all\n   hosts on the Internet using the File Transfer Protocol\
    \ (FTP)\n   [RFC959].  The inefficiency of this process is cited as a reason for\n\
    \   the development of the DNS [RFC882] [RFC883] in 1983.\n   However, the transition\
    \ from HOSTS.TXT to the DNS was not smooth.\n   For example, Sun Microsystems'\
    \ Network Information System (NIS)\n   [CORP-SUN-NIS], at the time known as Yellow\
    \ Pages, was an active\n   competitor to the DNS, although it failed to provide\
    \ a complete\n   solution to the global naming problem.\n   Another example was\
    \ NetBIOS Name Service, also known as WINS\n   [RFC1002].  This protocol was used\
    \ mostly by Microsoft Windows\n   machines, but also by open-source BSD and Linux\
    \ operating systems to\n   do name resolution using Microsoft's own name resolution\
    \ protocol.\n   Most modern operating systems can still use the '/etc/hosts' file\
    \ for\n   name resolution.  Many still have a name service switch that can be\n\
    \   configured on the host to resolve some domains using the NIS or WINS.\n  \
    \ Most have the capability to resolve names using mDNS by recognizing\n   the\
    \ special meaning of the '.local' Special-Use Top-Level Domain\n   Name.\n   The\
    \ Sun Microsystems model of having private domains within a\n   corporate site,\
    \ while supporting the global Domain Name System for\n   off-site, persisted even\
    \ after the NIS protocol fell into disuse.\n   Microsoft used to recommend that\
    \ site administrators use a \"private\"\n   TLD for internal use, and this practice\
    \ was very much a part of the\n   zeitgeist at the time (see Section 5.1 of [SDO-ICANN-COLL]\
    \ and\n   Appendix G of [RFC6762]).  This attitude is at the root of the\n   widespread\
    \ practice of simply picking an apparently unused TLD and\n   using it for experimental\
    \ purposes, which persists even at the time\n   of writing of this memo.\n   This\
    \ history is being presented because discussions about Special-Use\n   Domain\
    \ Names in the IETF often come down to the question of why users\n   of new name\
    \ resolution protocols choose to use domain names rather\n   than using some other\
    \ naming concept that doesn't overlap with the\n   namespace that, in modern times\
    \ is, by default, resolved using the\n   DNS.\n   The answer is that as a consequence\
    \ of this long history of resolving\n   domain names using a wide variety of name\
    \ resolution systems, domain\n   names are required in a large variety of contexts\
    \ in user interfaces\n   and applications programming interfaces.  Any name that\
    \ appears in\n   such a context is a domain name.  So, developers of new name\n\
    \   resolution systems that must work in existing contexts actually have\n   no\
    \ choice: they must use a Special-Use Domain Name to segregate a\n   portion of\
    \ the namespace for use with their system.\n"
