- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   A network may contain links with variable discrete bandwidth, e.g.,\n
    \  microwave and copper.  The bandwidth of such links may change\n   discretely
    in response to a changing external environment.  The word\n   \"availability\"
    is typically used to describe such links during\n   network planning.  This document
    defines a new type of Generalized\n   Switching Capability-Specific Information
    (SCSI) TLV to extend the\n   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
    Open Shortest Path\n   First (OSPF) routing protocol.  The extension can be used
    for route\n   computation in a network that contains links with variable discrete\n
    \  bandwidth.  Note that this document only covers the mechanisms by\n   which
    the availability information is distributed.  The mechanisms by\n   which availability
    information of a link is determined and the use of\n   the distributed information
    for route computation are outside the\n   scope of this document.  It is intended
    that technology-specific\n   documents will reference this document to describe
    specific uses.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some data-plane technologies, e.g., microwave and copper,
    allow\n   seamless changes of maximum physical bandwidth through a set of known\n
    \  discrete values.  The parameter \"availability\", as described in\n   [G.827],
    [F.1703], and [P.530], is often used to describe the link\n   capacity.  The availability
    is a time scale, representing a\n   proportion of the operating time that the
    requested bandwidth is\n   ensured.  To set up a Label Switched Path (LSP) across
    these links,\n   availability information is required by the nodes to verify the\n
    \  bandwidth before making a bandwidth reservation.  Assigning different\n   availability
    classes over such links provides for more efficient\n   planning of link capacity
    to support different types of services.\n   The link availability information
    will be determined by the operator\n   and is statically configured.  It will
    usually be determined from the\n   availability requirements of the services expected
    to be carried on\n   the LSP.  For example, voice service usually needs \"five
    nines\"\n   availability, while non-real-time services may adequately perform
    at\n   four or three nines availability.  For the route computation, both\n   the
    availability information and the bandwidth resource information\n   are needed.
    \ Since different service types may need different\n   availability guarantees,
    multiple <availability, bandwidth> pairs may\n   be required to be associated
    with a link.\n   In this document, a new type of Generalized SCSI-TLV, the\n   Availability
    SCSI-TLV, is defined.  It is intended that technology-\n   specific documents
    will reference this document to describe specific\n   uses.  The signaling extension
    to support links with variable\n   discrete bandwidth is defined in [RSVP-TE-Availability].\n"

    \  should include an <availability, bandwidth> information list in its\n   OSPF-TE

    is\n   defined.  The computed path can then be provisioned via the signaling\n

    - "4.2.  Processing Procedures\n   The ISCD allows routing protocols such as OSPF
      to carry technology-\n   specific information in the \"Switching Capability-specific\n
      \  information\" field; see [RFC4203].  A node advertising an interface\n   with
      a Switching Capability that supports variable discrete bandwidth\n   attached
      SHOULD contain one or more Availability SCSI-TLVs in its\n   OSPF-TE LSA messages.
      \ Each Availability SCSI-TLV provides\n   information about how much bandwidth
      a link can support for a\n   specified availability.  This information may be
      used for path\n   calculation by the node(s).\n   The Availability SCSI-TLV
      MUST NOT be sent in ISCDs with Switching\n   Capability field values that have
      not been defined to support the\n   Availability SCSI-TLV.  Non-supporting nodes
      would see such an\n   ISCD/LSA as malformed.\n   The absence of the Availability
      SCSI-TLV in an ISCD containing\n   Switching Capability field values that have
      been defined to support\n   the Availability SCSI-TLV SHALL be interpreted as
      representing the\n   fixed-bandwidth link with the highest availability value.\n
      \  Only one Availability SCSI-TLV for the specific availability level\n   SHOULD
      be sent.  If multiple TLVs are present, the Availability\n   SCSI-TLV with the
      lowest bandwidth value SHALL be processed.  If an\n   Availability SCSI-TLV
      with an invalid value (e.g., larger than 1) is\n   received, the Availability
      SCSI-TLV will be ignored.\n"
