  - "Abstract\n   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) facilitates\n
    \  loop-free connectivity to non-TRILL networks via a choice of an\n   Appointed
    Forwarder for a set of VLANs.  Appointed Forwarders provide\n   VLAN-based load
    sharing with an active-standby model.  High-\n   performance applications require
    an active-active load-sharing model.\n   The active-active load-sharing model
    can be accomplished by\n   representing any given non-TRILL network with a single
    virtual\n   RBridge (also referred to as a virtual Routing Bridge or virtual\n
    \  TRILL switch).  Virtual representation of the non-TRILL network with\n   a
    single RBridge poses serious challenges in multi-destination RPF\n   (Reverse
    Path Forwarding) check calculations.  This document\n   specifies required enhancements
    to build Coordinated Multicast Trees\n   (CMT) within the TRILL campus to solve
    related RPF issues.  CMT,\n   which only requires a software upgrade, provides
    flexibility to\n   RBridges in selecting a desired path of association to a given
    TRILL\n   multi-destination distribution tree.  This document updates RFC 6325.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links), as
    presented in\n   [RFC6325] and other related documents, provides methods of utilizing\n
    \  all available paths for active forwarding, with minimum\n   configuration.
    \ TRILL utilizes IS-IS (Intermediate System to\n   Intermediate System) [IS-IS]
    as its control plane and uses a TRILL\n   Header that includes a Hop Count.\n
    \  [RFC6325], [RFC7177], and [RFC6439] provide methods for\n   interoperability
    between TRILL and Ethernet end stations and bridged\n   networks.  [RFC6439] provides
    an active-standby solution, where only\n   one of the RBridges (aka Routing Bridges
    or TRILL switches) on a link\n   with end stations is in the active forwarding
    state for end-station\n   traffic for any given VLAN.  That RBridge is referred
    to as the\n   Appointed Forwarder (AF).  All frames ingressed into a TRILL network\n
    \  via the AF are encapsulated with the TRILL Header with a nickname\n   held
    by the ingress AF RBridge.  Due to failures, reconfigurations,\n   and other network
    dynamics, the AF for any set of VLANs may change.\n   RBridges maintain forwarding
    tables that contain bindings for\n   destination Media Access Control (MAC) addresses
    and Data Labels\n   (VLAN or Fine-Grained Labels (FGLs)) to egress RBridges.  In
    the\n   event of an AF change, forwarding tables of remote RBridges may\n   continue
    to forward traffic to the previous AF.  That traffic may get\n   discarded at
    the egress, causing traffic disruption.\n   High-performance applications require
    resiliency during failover.\n   The active-active forwarding model minimizes impact
    during failures\n   and maximizes the available network bandwidth.  A typical
    deployment\n   scenario, depicted in Figure 1, may have end stations and/or bridges\n
    \  attached to the RBridges.  These devices typically are multi-homed to\n   several
    RBridges and treat all of the uplinks independently using a\n   Local Active-Active
    Link Protocol (LAALP) [RFC7379], such as a single\n   Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation
    (MC-LAG) bundle or Distributed\n   Resilient Network Interconnect [802.1AX].  The
    AF designation\n   presented in [RFC6439] requires each of the edge RBridges to
    exchange\n   TRILL Hello packets.  By design, an LAALP does not forward packets\n
    \  received on one of the member ports of the MC-LAG to other member\n   ports
    of the same MC-LAG.  As a result, the AF designation methods\n   presented in
    [RFC6439] cannot be applied to the deployment scenario\n   depicted in Figure
    1.\n   An active-active load-sharing model can be implemented by\n   representing
    the edge of the network connected to a specific edge\n   group of RBridges by
    a single virtual RBridge.  Each virtual RBridge\n   MUST have a nickname unique
    within its TRILL campus.  In addition to\n   an active-active forwarding model,
    there may be other applications\n   that may require similar representations.\n
    \  Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 of [RFC6325], as updated by [RFC7780],\n   specify
    distribution tree calculation and RPF (Reverse Path\n   Forwarding) check calculation
    algorithms for multi-destination\n   forwarding.  These algorithms strictly depend
    on link cost and parent\n   RBridge priority.  As a result, based on the network
    topology, it may\n   be possible that a given edge RBridge, if it is forwarding
    on behalf\n   of the virtual RBridge, may not have a candidate multicast tree
    on\n   which it (the edge RBridge) can forward traffic, because there is no\n
    \  tree for which the virtual RBridge is a leaf node from the edge\n   RBridge.\n
    \  In this document, we present a method that allows RBridges to specify\n   the
    path of association for real or virtual child nodes to\n   distribution trees.
    \ Remote RBridges calculate their forwarding\n   tables and derive the RPF for
    distribution trees based on the\n   distribution tree association advertisements.
    \ In the absence of\n   distribution tree association advertisements, remote RBridges
    derive\n   the SPF (Shortest Path First) based on the algorithm specified in\n
    \  Section 4.5.1 of [RFC6325], as updated by [RFC7780].  This document\n   updates
    [RFC6325] by changing, when Coordinated Multicast Trees (CMT)\n   sub-TLVs are
    present, [RFC6325] mandatory provisions as to how\n   distribution trees are constructed.\n
    \  In addition to the above-mentioned active-active forwarding model,\n   other
    applications may utilize the distribution tree association\n   framework presented
    in this document to associate to distribution\n   trees through a preferred path.\n
    \  This proposal requires (1) the presence of multiple multi-destination\n   trees
    within the TRILL campus and (2) that all the RBridges in the\n   network be updated
    to support the new Affinity sub-TLV (Section 3).\n   It is expected that both
    of these requirements will be met, as they\n   are control-plane changes and will
    be common deployment scenarios.\n   In case either of the above two conditions
    is not met, RBridges MUST\n   support a fallback option for interoperability.
    \ Since the fallback\n   is expected to be a temporary phenomenon until all RBridges
    are\n   upgraded, this proposal gives guidelines for such fallbacks and does\n
    \  not mandate or specify any specific set of fallback options.\n"

    - "4.1.  Update to RFC 6325\n   This document updates Section 4.5.1 of [RFC6325]
      and changes the\n   calculation of distribution trees, as specified below:\n
      \  Each RBridge that desires to be the parent RBridge for a child\n   RBridge
      (RBy) in a multi-destination distribution tree (Tree x)\n   announces the desired
      association using an Affinity sub-TLV.  The\n   child is specified by its nickname.
      \ If an RBridge (RB1) advertises\n   an Affinity sub-TLV designating one of
      its own nicknames (N1) as its\n   \"child\" in some distribution tree, the effect
      is that nickname N1 is\n   ignored when constructing other distribution trees.
      \ Thus, the\n   RPF check will enforce the rule that only RB1 can use nickname
      N1 to\n   do ingress/egress on Tree x.  (This has no effect on least-cost path\n
      \  calculations for unicast traffic.)\n   When such an Affinity sub-TLV is present,
      the association specified\n   by the Affinity sub-TLV MUST be used when constructing

      they all derive the same set of\n   distribution trees [RFC6325].\n   If RBridge
      RB1 advertises an Affinity sub-TLV with an AFFINITY RECORD\n   that asks for

      RECORD is in conflict with TRILL distribution\n   tree root determination and
      MUST be ignored.\n   If RBridge RB1 advertises an Affinity sub-TLV with an AFFINITY
      RECORD\n   that asks for nickname RBn to be its child in any tree and RB1 is
      not\n   adjacent to RBn nor does nickname RBn identify RB1 itself, that\n   AFFINITY

      sub-TLVs are in conflict with each other for\n   those trees.  The nicknames

      ID as the tiebreaker.\n   The RBridge with the highest priority to be a tree
      root will retain\n   the Affinity association.  Other RBridges with lower priority

      advertise new non-conflicting Affinity sub-TLVs.\n   Similarly, remote RBridges

        virtual RBridge edge group is\n   aware of its member RBridges through configuration,
        LSP\n   advertisements, or some other method.\n   Member RBridges detect nodal
        failure of a member RBridge through\n   IS-IS LSP advertisements or lack thereof.\n
        \  Upon detecting a member failure, each of the member RBridges of the\n   RBv
        edge group start recovery timer T_rec for failed RBridge RBi.  If\n   the
        previously failed RBridge RBi has not recovered after the expiry\n   of timer
        T_rec, member RBridges perform the distribution tree\n   assignment algorithm
        specified in Section 5.1.  Each of the member\n   RBridges re-advertises the
        Affinity sub-TLV with the new tree\n   assignment.  This action causes the
        campus to update the tree\n   calculation with the new assignment.\n   RBi,
        upon startup, advertises its presence through IS-IS LSPs and\n   starts a
        timer T_i.  Other member RBridges of the edge group,\n   detecting the presence
        of RBi, start a timer T_j.\n   Upon expiry of timer T_j, other member RBridges
        recalculate the\n   multi-destination tree assignment and advertise the related
        trees\n   using the Affinity sub-TLV.  Upon expiry of timer T_i, RBi\n   recalculates
        the multi-destination tree assignment and advertises the\n   related trees
        using the Affinity sub-TLV.\n   If the new RBridge in the edge group calculates
        trees and starts to\n   use one or more of them before the existing RBridges
        in the edge\n   group recalculate, there could be duplication of packets (for\n
        \  example, more than one edge group RBridge could decapsulate and\n   forward
        a multi-destination frame on links into the active-active\n   group) or loss
        of packets (for example, due to the Reverse Path\n   Forwarding check, in
        the rest of the campus, if two edge group\n   RBridges are trying to forward
        on the same tree, those from one will\n   be discarded).  Alternatively, if
        the new RBridge in the edge group\n   calculates trees and starts to use one
        or more of them after the\n   existing RBridges recalculate, there could be
        loss of data due to\n   frames arriving at the new RBridge being black-holed.
        \ Timers T_i and\n   T_j should be initialized to values designed to minimize
        these\n   problems, keeping in mind that, in general, duplication of packets
        is\n   a more serious problem than dropped packets.  It is RECOMMENDED that\n
        \  T_j be less than T_i, and a reasonable default is 1/2 of T_i.\n"
