- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) can use naming\n\
    \   systems other than DNS when looking for services.  Moreover, when it\n   uses\
    \ DNS, DNS-SD uses the full capability of DNS, rather than using a\n   subset\
    \ of available octets.  This is of particular relevance where\n   some environments\
    \ use DNS labels that conform to Internationalized\n   Domain Names for Applications\
    \ (IDNA), and other environments use\n   labels containing Unicode characters\
    \ (such as containing octets\n   corresponding to characters encoded as UTF-8).\
    \  In order for DNS-SD\n   to be used effectively in environments where multiple\
    \ different name\n   systems and conventions for their operation are in use, it\
    \ is\n   important to attend to differences in the underlying technology and\n\
    \   operational environment.  This memo presents an outline of the\n   requirements\
    \ for the selection of labels for conventional DNS and\n   other resolution systems\
    \ when they are expected to interoperate in\n   this manner.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD, [RFC6763]) specifies\
    \ a mechanism\n   for discovering services using queries to DNS ([RFC1034] and\n\
    \   [RFC1035]) and to any other system that uses domain names, such as\n   Multicast\
    \ DNS (mDNS, [RFC6762]).  Many applications that use DNS\n   follow \"Internet\
    \ hostname\" syntax [RFC952] for labels -- the\n   so-called LDH (letters, digits,\
    \ and hyphen) rule.  That convention is\n   the reason behind the development\
    \ of Internationalized Domain Names\n   for Applications (IDNA2008, [RFC5890],\
    \ [RFC5891], [RFC5892],\n   [RFC5893], [RFC5894], and [RFC5895]).  It is worth\
    \ noting that the\n   LDH rule is a convention, and not a rule of the DNS; this\
    \ is made\n   entirely plain by Section 11 of [RFC2181], and discussed further\
    \ in\n   Section 3 of [RFC6055].  Nevertheless, there is a widespread belief\n\
    \   that in many circumstances domain names cannot be used in the DNS\n   unless\
    \ they follow the LDH rule.\n   At the same time, mDNS requires that labels be\
    \ encoded in UTF-8 and\n   permits a range of characters in labels that are not\
    \ permitted by\n   IDNA2008 or the LDH rule.  For example, mDNS encourages the\
    \ use of\n   spaces and punctuation in mDNS names (see Section 4.2.3 of\n   [RFC6763]).\
    \  It does not restrict which Unicode code points may be\n   used in those labels,\
    \ so long as the code points are UTF-8 in\n   Net-Unicode [RFC5198] format.\n\
    \   Users and developers of applications are, of course, frequently\n   unconcerned\
    \ with (or oblivious to) the name-resolution system(s) in\n   service at any given\
    \ moment; they are inclined simply to use the same\n   domain names in different\
    \ contexts.  As a result, names entered into\n   the same domain name slot might\
    \ be resolved using different name\n   resolution technologies.  If a given name\
    \ will not work across the\n   various environments, then user expectations are\
    \ likely to be best\n   satisfied when at least some parts of the domain names\
    \ to be queried\n   are compatible with the rules and conventions for all the\
    \ relevant\n   technologies.  Given the uses of DNS-SD, a choice for such\n  \
    \ compatibility likely lies with the application designer or service\n   operator.\n\
    \   One approach to interoperability under these circumstances is to use\n   a\
    \ single operational convention (a \"profile\") for domain names under\n   the\
    \ different naming systems.  This memo assumes such a use profile,\n   and attempts\
    \ to outline what is necessary to make it work without\n   specifying any particular\
    \ technology.  It does assume, however, that\n   the global DNS is likely to be\
    \ implicated.  Given the general\n   tendency of all resolution eventually to\
    \ fall through to the DNS,\n   that assumption does not seem controversial.\n\
    \   It is worth noting that users of DNS-SD do not use the service\n   discovery\
    \ names in the same way that users of other domain names\n   might.  In many cases,\
    \ domain names can be entered as direct user\n   input.  But the service discovery\
    \ context generally assumes that\n   users are picking a service from a list.\
    \  As a result, the sorts of\n   application considerations that are appropriate\
    \ to the general-\n   purpose DNS name, and that resulted in the A-label/U-label\
    \ split (see\n   below) in IDNA2008, are not entirely the right approach for DNS-SD.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Conventions and Terms Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Conventions and Terms Used in This Document\n   Wherever appropriate, this\
    \ memo uses the terminology defined in\n   Section 2 of [RFC5890].  In particular,\
    \ the reader is assumed to be\n   familiar with the terms \"U-label\", \"LDH label\"\
    , and \"A-label\" from\n   that document.  Similarly, the reader is assumed to\
    \ be familiar with\n   the U+NNNN notation for Unicode code points used in [RFC5890]\
    \ and\n   other documents dealing with Unicode code points.  In the interests\n\
    \   of brevity and consistency, the definitions are not repeated here.\n   Sometimes\
    \ this memo refers to names in the DNS as though the LDH rule\n   and IDNA2008\
    \ are strict requirements.  They are not.  DNS labels are,\n   in principle, just\
    \ collections of octets; therefore, in principle,\n   the LDH rule is not a constraint.\
    \  In practice, applications\n   sometimes intercept labels that do not conform\
    \ to the LDH rule and\n   apply IDNA and other transformations.\n   DNS, perhaps\
    \ unfortunately, has produced its own jargon.  Unfamiliar\n   DNS-related terms\
    \ in this memo should be found in [RFC7719].\n   The term \"owner name\" (common\
    \ to the DNS vernacular; see above) is\n   used here to apply not just to the\
    \ domain names to be looked up in\n   the DNS, but to any name that might be looked\
    \ up either in the DNS or\n   using another technology.  Therefore, it includes\
    \ names that might\n   not actually exist anywhere.  In addition, what follows\
    \ depends on\n   the idea that not every domain name will be looked up in the\
    \ DNS.\n   For instance, names ending in \"local.\" (in the presentation format)\n\
    \   are not ordinarily looked up using DNS, but instead looked up using\n   mDNS.\n\
    \   DNS-SD specifies three portions of the owner name for a DNS-SD\n   resource\
    \ record.  These are the <Instance> portion, the <Service>\n   portion, and the\
    \ <Domain> portion.  The owner name made of these\n   three parts is called the\
    \ \"Service Instance Name\".  It is worth\n   observing that a portion may be\
    \ more than one label long.  See\n   Section 4.1 of [RFC6763].  Further discussion\
    \ of the parts is found\n   in Section 4.\n   Throughout this memo, mDNS is used\
    \ liberally as the alternative\n   resolution mechanism to DNS.  This is for convenience\
    \ rather than\n   rigor: any alternative name resolution to DNS could present\
    \ the same\n   friction with the prevailing operational conventions of the global\n\
    \   DNS.  It so happens that mDNS is the overwhelmingly successful\n   alternative\
    \ as of this writing, so it is used in order to make the\n   issues plainer to\
    \ the reader.  Other alternative resolution\n   mechanisms may generally be read\
    \ wherever mDNS appears in the text,\n   except where details of the mDNS specification\
    \ appear.\n"
- title: 2.  Why There Could Be a Problem at All
  contents:
  - "2.  Why There Could Be a Problem at All\n   One might reasonably wonder why there\
    \ is a problem to be solved at\n   all.  After all, DNS labels permit any octet\
    \ whatsoever, and anything\n   that can be useful with DNS-SD cannot use any names\
    \ that are outside\n   the protocol strictures of the DNS.\n   The reason for\
    \ the trouble is twofold.  First, and least troublesome,\n   is the possibility\
    \ of resolvers that are attempting to offer IDNA\n   service system-wide.  Given\
    \ the design of IDNA2008, it is reasonable\n   to suppose that, on some systems,\
    \ high-level name resolution\n   libraries will perform the U-label/A-label transformation\n\
    \   automatically, saving applications from these details.  But system-\n   level\
    \ services do not always have available to them the resolution\n   context, and\
    \ they may apply the transformation in a way that foils\n   rather than helps\
    \ the application.  Of course, if this were the main\n   problem, it would presumably\
    \ be self-correcting because the right\n   answer would be, \"Don't use those\
    \ libraries for DNS-SD\", and DNS-SD\n   would not work reliably in cases where\
    \ such libraries were in use.\n   This would be unfortunate, but given that DNS-SD\
    \ in Internet contexts\n   is (as of this writing) not in ubiquitous use, it should\
    \ not\n   represent a fatal issue.\n   The greater problem is that the \"infrastructure\"\
    \ types of DNS service\n   -- the root zone, the top-level domains, and so on\
    \ -- have embraced\n   IDNA and refuse registration of raw UTF-8 into their zones.\
    \  As of\n   this writing, there is (perhaps unfortunately) no reliable way to\n\
    \   discover where these sorts of DNS services end.  Nevertheless, some\n   client\
    \ programs (notably web browsers) have adopted a number of\n   different policies\
    \ about how domain names will be looked up and\n   presented to users given the\
    \ policies of the relevant DNS zone\n   operators.  None of these policies permit\
    \ raw UTF-8.  Since it is\n   anticipated that DNS-SD when used with the DNS will\
    \ be inside domain\n   names beneath those kinds of \"infrastructure\" domains,\
    \ the\n   implications of IDNA2008 must be a consideration.\n   For further exploration\
    \ of issues relating to encoding of domain\n   names generally, the reader should\
    \ consult [RFC6055].\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements for a Profile for Label Interoperation
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements for a Profile for Label Interoperation\n   Any interoperability\
    \ between DNS (including prevailing operational\n   conventions) and other resolution\
    \ technologies will require\n   interoperability across the portions of a DNS-SD\
    \ Service Instance\n   Name that are implicated in regular DNS lookups.  Only\
    \ some portions\n   are implicated.  In any case, if a given portion is implicated,\
    \ the\n   profile will need to apply to all labels in that portion.\n   In addition,\
    \ because DNS-SD Service Instance Names can be used in a\n   domain name slot,\
    \ care must be taken by DNS-SD-aware resolvers to\n   handle the different portions\
    \ as outlined here, so that DNS-SD\n   portions that do not use IDNA2008 will\
    \ not be treated as U-labels and\n   will not accidentally undergo IDNA processing.\n\
    \   Because the profile will apply to names that might appear in the\n   public\
    \ DNS, and because other resolution mechanisms (such as mDNS)\n   could permit\
    \ labels that IDNA does not, the profile might reduce the\n   labels that could\
    \ be used with those other resolution mechanisms.\n   One consequence of this\
    \ is that some recommendations from [RFC6763]\n   will not really be possible\
    \ to implement using names subject to the\n   profile.  In particular, Section\
    \ 4.2.3 of [RFC6763] recommends that\n   labels always be stored and communicated\
    \ as UTF-8, even in the DNS.\n   Because of the way that the public DNS is currently\
    \ operated (see\n   Section 2), the advice to store and transmit labels as UTF-8\
    \ in the\n   DNS is likely either to encounter problems, to result in unnecessary\n\
    \   traffic to the public DNS, or to do both.  In particular, many labels\n  \
    \ in the <Domain> part of a Service Instance Name are unlikely to be\n   found\
    \ in the UTF-8 form in the public DNS tree for zones that are\n   using IDNA2008.\
    \  By contrast, for example, mDNS exclusively uses\n   UTF-8.\n   U-labels cannot\
    \ contain uppercase letters (see Sections 3.1.3 and 4.2\n   of [RFC5894]).  That\
    \ restriction extends to ASCII-range uppercase\n   letters that work fine in LDH\
    \ labels.  It may be confusing that the\n   character \"A\" works in the DNS when\
    \ none of the characters in the\n   label has a diacritic, but it does not work\
    \ when there is such a\n   diacritic in the label.  Labels in mDNS names (or other\
    \ resolution\n   technologies) may contain uppercase characters, so the profile\
    \ will\n   need either to restrict the use of uppercase or to come up with a\n\
    \   convention for case folding (even in the presence of diacritics) that\n  \
    \ is reliable and predictable to users.\n"
- title: 4.  DNS-SD Portions
  contents:
  - "4.  DNS-SD Portions\n   Service Instance Names are made up of three portions.\n"
- title: 4.1.  The <Instance> Portion of the Service Instance Name
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The <Instance> Portion of the Service Instance Name\n   [RFC6763] is clear\
    \ that the <Instance> portion of the Service\n   Instance Name is intended for\
    \ presentation to users; therefore,\n   virtually any character is permitted in\
    \ it.  There are two ways that\n   a profile might address this portion.\n   The\
    \ first way would be to treat this portion as likely to be\n   intercepted by\
    \ system-wide IDNA-aware (but otherwise context-unaware)\n   resolvers or likely\
    \ subject to strict IDNA-conformance requirements\n   for publication in the relevant\
    \ zone.  In this case, the portion\n   would need to be made subject to the profile,\
    \ thereby curtailing what\n   characters may appear in this portion.  This approach\
    \ permits DNS-SD\n   to use any standard system resolver but presents inconsistencies\
    \ with\n   the DNS-SD specification and with DNS-SD use that is exclusively\n\
    \   mDNS-based.  Therefore, this strategy is rejected.\n   Instead, DNS-SD implementations\
    \ can intercept the <Instance> portion\n   of a Service Instance Name and ensure\
    \ that those labels are never\n   handed to IDNA-aware resolvers that might attempt\
    \ to convert these\n   labels into A-labels.  Under this approach, the DNS-SD\
    \ <Instance>\n   portion works as it always does, but at the cost of using special\n\
    \   resolution code built into the DNS-SD system.  A practical\n   consequence\
    \ of this is that zone operators need to be prepared not to\n   apply the LDH\
    \ rule to all labels, and they may need to make special\n   concessions to ensure\
    \ that the <Instance> portion can contain spaces,\n   uppercase and lowercase,\
    \ and any UTF-8 code point.  Otherwise, they\n   need to prepare a user interface\
    \ to handle the exceptions that would\n   be generated.  Automatic conversion\
    \ to A-labels is not acceptable.\n   It is worth noting that this advice is not\
    \ actually compatible with\n   the advice in Section 4 of [RFC6055].  That section\
    \ appears to assume\n   that names are not really composed of subsections, but\
    \ because\n   [RFC6763] specifies portions of names, the advice in this memo is\
    \ to\n   follow the advice of [RFC6055] according to the portion of the domain\n\
    \   name, rather than for the whole domain name.  As a practical matter,\n   this\
    \ means special-purpose name resolution software for DNS-SD.\n"
- title: 4.2.  The <Service> Portion of the Service Instance Name
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The <Service> Portion of the Service Instance Name\n   DNS-SD includes\
    \ a <Service> component in the Service Instance Name.\n   This component is not\
    \ really user-facing data; instead it is control\n   data embedded in the Service\
    \ Instance Name.  This component includes\n   so-called \"underscore labels\"\
    , which are labels prepended with U+005F\n   (_).  The underscore label convention\
    \ was established by DNS SRV\n   ([RFC2782]) for identifying metadata inside DNS\
    \ names.  A system-wide\n   resolver (or DNS middlebox) that cannot handle underscore\
    \ labels will\n   not work with DNS-SD at all, so it is safe to suppose that such\n\
    \   resolvers will not attempt to do special processing on these labels.\n   Therefore,\
    \ the <Service> portion of the Service Instance Name will\n   not be subject to\
    \ the profile.  By the same token, underscore labels\n   are never subject to\
    \ IDNA processing (they are formally\n   incompatible); therefore, concerns about\
    \ IDNA are irrelevant for\n   these labels.\n"
- title: 4.3.  The <Domain> Portion of the Service Instance Name
  contents:
  - "4.3.  The <Domain> Portion of the Service Instance Name\n   The <Domain> portion\
    \ of the Service Instance Name forms an integral\n   part of the owner name submitted\
    \ for DNS resolution.  A system-wide\n   resolver that is IDNA2008-aware is likely\
    \ to interpret labels with\n   UTF-8 in the owner name as candidates for IDNA2008\
    \ processing.  More\n   important, operators of internationalized domain names\
    \ will\n   frequently publish such names in the public DNS as A-labels;\n   certainly,\
    \ the topmost labels will always be A-labels.  Therefore,\n   these labels will\
    \ need to be subject to the profile.  DNS-SD\n   implementations ought to identify\
    \ the <Domain> portion of the Service\n   Instance Name and treat it subject to\
    \ IDNA2008 in case the domain is\n   to be queried from the global DNS.  (This\
    \ document does not specify\n   how to do that and does not alter the specification\
    \ in [RFC6763].)\n   In the event that the <Domain> portion of the Service Instance\
    \ Name\n   fails to resolve, it is acceptable to substitute labels with plain\n\
    \   UTF-8, starting at the lowest label in the DNS tree and working\n   toward\
    \ the root.  This approach would differ from the rule for\n   resolution published\
    \ in [RFC6763], because this approach privileges\n   IDNA2008-compatible labels\
    \ over UTF-8 labels.  There is more than one\n   way to achieve such a result,\
    \ but in terms of predictability, it is\n   probably best if the lowest-level\
    \ resolution component is able to\n   learn the correct resolution context so\
    \ that it can perform the\n   correct transformations on the various domain portions.\n\
    \   One might argue against the above restriction on either of two\n   grounds:\n\
    \   1.  It is possible that the names may be in the DNS in UTF-8, and RFC\n  \
    \     6763 already specifies a fallback strategy of progressively\n       attempting\
    \ first the UTF-8 label lookup (it might not be a\n       U-label) and then, if\
    \ possible, the A-label lookup.\n   2.  Zone administrators that wish to support\
    \ DNS-SD can publish a\n       UTF-8 version of the zone along side the A-label\
    \ version of the\n       zone.\n   The first of these is rejected because it represents\
    \ a potentially\n   significant increase in DNS lookup traffic.  It is possible\
    \ for a\n   DNS-SD application to identify the <Domain> portion of the Service\n\
    \   Instance Name.  The standard way to publish IDNs on the Internet uses\n  \
    \ IDNA.  Therefore, additional lookups should not be encouraged.  When\n   [RFC6763]\
    \ was published, the bulk of IDNs were lower in the tree.\n   Now that there are\
    \ internationalized labels in the root zone, it is\n   desirable to minimize queries\
    \ to the Internet infrastructure if they\n   are sure to be answered in the negative.\n\
    \   The second reason depends on the idea that it is possible to maintain\n  \
    \ two names in sync with one another.  This is not strictly speaking\n   true,\
    \ although in this case the domain operator could simply create a\n   DNAME record\
    \ [RFC6672] from the UTF-8 name to the IDNA2008 zone.\n   This still, however,\
    \ relies on being able to reach the (UTF-8) name\n   in question, and it is unlikely\
    \ that the UTF-8 version of the zone\n   will be delegated from anywhere.  Moreover,\
    \ in many organizations,\n   the support for DNS-SD and the support for domain\
    \ name delegations\n   are not performed by the same department; depending on\
    \ a coordination\n   between the two will make the system more fragile, slower,\
    \ or both.\n   Some resolvers -- particularly those that are used in mixed DNS\
    \ and\n   non-DNS environments -- may be aware of different operational\n   conventions\
    \ in different parts of the DNS tree.  For example, it may\n   be possible for\
    \ implementations to use hints about the boundary of an\n   organization's domain\
    \ name infrastructure in order to tell, for\n   instance, that example.com. is\
    \ part of the Example Organization,\n   while com. is a large delegation-centric\
    \ zone on the public Internet.\n   In such cases, the resolution system might\
    \ reverse its preferences to\n   prefer plain UTF-8 labels when resolving names\
    \ below the boundary\n   point in the DNS tree.  The result would be that any\
    \ lookup past the\n   boundary point and closer to the root would use LDH labels\
