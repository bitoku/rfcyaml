  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a set of requirements for NATs handling the\n\
    \   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  These requirements\n   allow\
    \ DCCP applications, such as streaming applications, to operate\n   consistently,\
    \ and they are very similar to the TCP requirements for\n   NATs, which have already\
    \ been published by the IETF.  Ensuring that\n   NATs meet this set of requirements\
    \ will greatly increase the\n   likelihood that applications using DCCP will function\
    \ properly.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   For historical reasons, NAT devices are not typically capable\
    \ of\n   handling datagrams and flows for applications that use the Datagram\n\
    \   Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340].\n   This memo discusses the\
    \ technical issues involved and proposes a set\n   of requirements for NAT devices\
    \ to handle DCCP in a way that enables\n   communications when either or both\
    \ of the DCCP endpoints are located\n   behind one or more NAT devices.  All definitions\
    \ and requirements in\n   [RFC4787] are inherited here.  The requirements are\
    \ otherwise\n   designed similarly to those in [RFC5382], from which this memo\n\
    \   borrows its structure and much of its content.\n   Note however that, if both\
    \ endpoints are hindered by NAT devices, the\n   normal model for DCCP of asymmetric\
    \ connection will not work.  A\n   simultaneous-open must be performed, as in\
    \ [RFC5596].  Also, a\n   separate, unspecified mechanism may be needed, such\
    \ as Unilateral\n   Self Address Fixing (UNSAF) [RFC3424] protocols, if an endpoint\
    \ needs\n   to learn its own external NAT mappings.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   This document uses the term \"DCCP connection\" to refer to individual\n \
    \  DCCP flows, as uniquely identified by the quadruple (source and\n   destination\
    \ IP addresses and DCCP ports) at a given time.\n   This document uses the term\
    \ \"NAT mapping\" to refer to a state at the\n   NAT that is necessary for network\
    \ address and port translation of\n   DCCP connections.  This document also uses\
    \ the terms \"endpoint-\n   independent mapping\", \"address-dependent mapping\"\
    , \"address and port-\n   dependent mapping\", \"filtering behavior\", \"endpoint-independent\n\

- title: 3.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   This document applies to NAT devices that want\
    \ to handle DCCP\n   datagrams.  It is not the intent of this document to deprecate\
    \ the\n   overwhelming majority of deployed NAT devices.  These NATs are simply\n\
    \   not expected to handle DCCP, so this memo is not applicable to them.\n   Expected\
    \ NAT behaviors applicable to DCCP connections are very\n   similar to those applicable\
    \ to TCP connections (with the exception of\n   REQ-6 below).  The following requirements\
    \ are discussed and justified\n   extensively in [RFC5382].  These justifications\
    \ are not reproduced\n   here for the sake of brevity.\n   In addition to the\
    \ usual changes to the IP header (in particular, the\n   IP addresses), NAT devices\
    \ need to mangle:\n   o  the DCCP source port for outgoing packets, depending\
    \ on the NAT\n      mapping,\n   o  the DCCP destination port for incoming packets,\
    \ depending on the\n      NAT mapping, and\n   o  the DCCP checksum, to compensate\
    \ for IP address and port number\n      modifications.\n   Because changing the\
    \ source or destination IP address of a DCCP\n   packet will normally invalidate\
    \ the DCCP checksum, it is not possible\n   to use DCCP through a NAT without\
    \ dedicated support.  Some NAT\n   devices are known to provide \"generic\" transport-protocol\
    \ support,\n   whereby only the IP header is mangled.  That scheme is not sufficient\n\
    \   to support DCCP.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Address and Port Mapping Behavior\n   A NAT uses a mapping to translate\
    \ packets for each DCCP connection.\n   A mapping is dynamically allocated for\
    \ connections initiated from the\n   internal side, and is potentially reused\
    \ for certain subsequent\n   connections.  NAT behavior regarding when a mapping\
    \ can be reused\n   differs for different NATs, as described in [RFC4787].\n \
    \  REQ-1: A NAT MUST have an \"Endpoint-Independent Mapping\" behavior for\n \
    \  DCCP.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Established Connections
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Established Connections\n   REQ-2: A NAT MUST support all valid sequences\
    \ of DCCP packets\n   (defined in [RFC4340] and its updates) for connections initiated\
    \ both\n   internally as well as externally when the connection is permitted by\n\
    \   the NAT.  In particular, in addition to handling the DCCP 3-way\n   handshake\
    \ mode of connection initiation, A NAT MUST handle the DCCP\n   simultaneous-open\
    \ mode of connection initiation, defined in\n   [RFC5596].  That mode updates\
    \ DCCP by adding a new packet type: DCCP-\n   Listen.  The DCCP-Listen packet\
    \ communicates the information\n   necessary to uniquely identify a DCCP session.\
    \  NATs may utilise the\n   connection information (address, port, Service Code)\
    \ to establish\n   local forwarding state.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Externally Initiated Connections

  - "4.3.  Externally Initiated Connections\n   REQ-3: If application transparency\
    \ is most important, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that a NAT have an \"Endpoint-independent\

    \ most\n   important, it is RECOMMENDED that a NAT have an \"Address-dependent\n\
    \   filtering\" behavior for DCCP.\n   o  The filtering behavior MAY be an option\
    \ configurable by the\n      administrator of the NAT.\n   o  The filtering behavior\
    \ for DCCP MAY be independent of the\n      filtering behavior for any other transport-layer\
    \ protocol, such as\n      UDP, UDP-Lite, TCP, and SCTP (Stream Control Transmission\n\
    \      Protocol).\n   REQ-4: A NAT MUST wait for at least 6 seconds from the reception\
    \ of\n   an unsolicited, inbound DCCP-Listen or DCCP-Sync packet before it may\n\
    \   respond with an ICMP Port Unreachable error, an ICMP Protocol\n   Unreachable\
    \ error, or a DCCP-Reset.  If, during this interval, the\n   NAT receives and\
    \ translates an outbound DCCP-Request packet for the\n   connection, the NAT MUST\
    \ silently drop the original unsolicited,\n   inbound DCCP-Listen packet.  Otherwise,\
    \ the NAT SHOULD send an ICMP\n   Port Unreachable error (Type 3, Code 3) for\
    \ the original DCCP-Listen\n   unless the security policy forbids it.\n"
- title: 5.  NAT Session Refresh
  contents:
  - "5.  NAT Session Refresh\n   The \"established connection idle-timeout\" for a\
    \ NAT is defined as the\n   minimum time a DCCP connection in the established\
    \ phase must remain\n   idle before the NAT considers the associated session a\
    \ candidate for\n   removal.  The \"transitory connection idle-timeout\" for a\
    \ NAT is\n   defined as the minimum time a DCCP connection in the CLOSEREQ or\n\
    \   CLOSING phases must remain idle before the NAT considers the\n   associated\
    \ session a candidate for removal.  DCCP connections in the\n   TIMEWAIT state\
    \ are not affected by the \"transitory connection idle-\n   timeout\".\n   REQ-5:\
    \ If a NAT cannot determine whether the endpoints of a DCCP\n   connection are\
    \ active, it MAY abandon the session if it has been idle\n   for some time.  Where\
    \ a NAT implements session timeouts, the default\n   value of the \"established\

    \ value of the \"transitory\n   connection idle-timeout\" MUST be of 4 minutes\

    \ for an Application Level Gateway (ALG) to function properly.\n   Additionally,\
    \ there are no known DCCP-capable ALGs at the time of\n   writing this document.\n\

- title: 8.1.  Partial Checksum Coverage
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Partial Checksum Coverage\n   DCCP supports partial checksum coverage.\
    \  A NAT will usually need to\n   perform incremental changes to the packet Checksum\
    \ field, as for\n   other IETF-defined protocols.  However, if it needs to recalculate\
    \ a\n   correct checksum value, it must take the checksum coverage into\n   account,\
    \ as described in Section 9.2 of [RFC4340].\n   REQ-11: If a NAT translates a\
    \ DCCP packet with a valid DCCP checksum,\n   it MUST ensure that the DCCP checksum\
    \ is translated such that it is\n   valid after the translation.\n   REQ-12: A\
    \ NAT MUST NOT modify the value of the DCCP Checksum\n   Coverage.\n   The Checksum\
    \ Coverage field in the DCCP header determines the parts\n   of the packet that\
    \ are covered by the Checksum field.  This always\n   includes the DCCP header\
    \ and options, but some or all of the\n   application data may be excluded as\
    \ determined on a packet-by-packet\n   basis by the application.  Changing the\
    \ Checksum Coverage in the\n   network violates the integrity assumptions at the\
    \ receiver and may\n   result in unpredictable or incorrect application behaviour.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Services Codes
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Services Codes\n   DCCP specifies a Service Code as a 4-byte value (32\
    \ bits) that\n   describes the application-level service to which a client application\n\
    \   wishes to connect [RFC4340].\n   REQ-13: If a NAT translates a DCCP packet,\
    \ it MUST NOT modify its\n   DCCP Service Code value.\n   Further guidance on\
    \ the use of Service Codes by middleboxes,\n   including NATs, can be found in\
    \ [RFC5595].\n"
- title: 9.  DCCP without NAT Support
  contents:
  - "9.  DCCP without NAT Support\n   If the NAT device cannot be updated to support\
    \ DCCP, DCCP datagrams\n   can be encapsulated within a UDP transport header.\
    \  Indeed, most NAT\n   devices are already capable of handling UDP.  This is\
    \ however beyond\n   the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   [RFC4787] discusses security considerations\
    \ for NATs that handle IP\n   and unicast (UDP) traffic, all of which apply equally\
    \ to this\n   document.  Security concerns specific to handling DCCP packets are\n\
    \   discussed in this section.\n   REQ-1 and REQ-6 through REQ-13 do not introduce\
    \ any new known\n   security concerns.\n   REQ-2 does not introduce any new known\
    \ security concerns.  While a\n   NAT may elect to keep track of some DCCP-specific,\
    \ per-flow state\n   (compared to UDP), it has no obligations to do so.\n   REQ-3\
    \ allows a NAT to adopt either a more secure or a more\n   application-transparent\
    \ filtering policy.  This is already addressed\n   in [RFC4787] and [RFC5382].\n\
    \   Similar to [RFC5382], REQ-4 of this document recommends that a NAT\n   respond\
    \ to unsolicited, inbound Listen and Sync packets with an ICMP\n   error delayed\
    \ by a few seconds.  Doing so may reveal the presence of\n   a NAT to an external\
    \ attacker.  Silently dropping the Listen makes it\n   harder to diagnose network\
    \ problems and forces applications to wait\n   for the DCCP stack to finish several\
    \ retransmissions before reporting\n   an error.  An implementer must therefore\
    \ understand and carefully\n   weigh the effects of not sending an ICMP error\
    \ or rate-limiting such\n   ICMP errors to a very small number.\n   REQ-5 recommends\
    \ that a NAT that passively monitors DCCP state keep\n   idle sessions alive for\
    \ at least 124 minutes or 4 minutes, depending\n   on the state of the connection.\
    \  To protect against denial-of-service\n   attacks filling its state storage\
    \ capacity, a NAT may attempt to\n   actively determine the liveliness of a DCCP\
    \ connection, or the NAT\n   administrator could configure more conservative timeouts.\n"
