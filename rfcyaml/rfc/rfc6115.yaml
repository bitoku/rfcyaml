  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and\
    \ addressing\n   architecture is facing challenges in scalability, multihoming,\
    \ and\n   inter-domain traffic engineering.  The problem being addressed has\n\
    \   been documented in [Scalability_PS], and the design goals that we\n   have\
    \ discussed can be found in [RRG_Design_Goals].\n   This document surveys many\
    \ of the proposals that were brought forward\n   for discussion in this activity.\
    \  For some of the proposals, this\n   document also includes additional analysis\
    \ showing some of the\n   concerns with specific proposals, and how some of those\
    \ concerns may\n   be addressed.  Readers are cautioned not to draw any conclusions\n\
    \   about the degree of interest or endorsement by the Routing Research\n   Group\
    \ (RRG) from the presence of any proposals in this document, or\n   the amount\
    \ of analysis devoted to specific proposals.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Background to This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Background to This Document\n   The RRG was chartered to research and recommend\
    \ a new routing\n   architecture for the Internet.  The goal was to explore many\n\
    \   alternatives and build consensus around a single proposal.  The only\n   constraint\
    \ on the group's process was that the process be open and\n   the group set forth\
    \ with the usual discussion of proposals and trying\n   to build consensus around\
    \ them.  There were no explicit contingencies\n   in the group's process for the\
    \ eventuality that the group did not\n   reach consensus.\n   The group met at\
    \ every IETF meeting from March 2007 to March 2010 and\n   discussed many proposals,\
    \ both in person and via its mailing list.\n   Unfortunately, the group did not\
    \ reach consensus.  Rather than lose\n   the contributions and progress that had\
    \ been made, the chairs (Lixia\n   Zhang and Tony Li) elected to collect the proposals\
    \ of the group and\n   some of the debate concerning the proposals and make a\
    \ recommendation\n   from those proposals.  Thus, the recommendation reflects\
    \ the opinions\n   of the chairs and not necessarily the consensus of the group.\n\
    \   The group was able to reach consensus on a number of items that are\n   included\
    \ below.  The proposals included here were collected in an\n   open call amongst\
    \ the group.  Once the proposals were collected, the\n   group was solicited to\
    \ submit critiques of each proposal.  The group\n   was asked to self-organize\
    \ to produce a single critique for each\n   proposal.  In cases where there were\
    \ several critiques submitted, the\n   editor selected one.  The proponents of\

  contents:
  - "1.2.  Areas of Group Consensus\n   The group was also able to reach broad and\
    \ clear consensus on some\n   terminology and several important technical points.\
    \  For the sake of\n   posterity, these are recorded here:\n   1.   A \"node\"\
    \ is either a host or a router.\n   2.   A \"router\" is any device that forwards\
    \ packets at the network\n        layer (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) of the Internet architecture.\n\
    \   3.   A \"host\" is a device that can send/receive packets to/from the\n  \
    \      network, but does not forward packets.\n   4.   A \"bridge\" is a device\
    \ that forwards packets at the link layer\n        (e.g., Ethernet) of the Internet\
    \ architecture.  An Ethernet\n        switch or Ethernet hub are examples of bridges.\n\
    \   5.   An \"address\" is an object that combines aspects of identity with\n\
    \        topological location.  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are current\n        examples.\n\
    \   6.   A \"locator\" is a structured topology-dependent name that is not\n \
    \       used for node identification and is not a path.  Two related\n       \
    \ meanings are current, depending on the class of things being\n        named:\n\
    \        1.  The topology-dependent name of a node's interface.\n        2.  The\
    \ topology-dependent name of a single subnetwork OR\n            topology-dependent\
    \ name of a group of related subnetworks\n            that share a single aggregate.\
    \  An IP routing prefix is a\n            current example of the latter.\n   7.\
    \   An \"identifier\" is a topology-independent name for a logical\n        node.\
    \  Depending upon instantiation, a \"logical node\" might be a\n        single\
    \ physical device, a cluster of devices acting as a single\n        node, or a\
    \ single virtual partition of a single physical device.\n        An OSI End System\
    \ Identifier (ESID) is an example of an\n        identifier.  A Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name (FQDN) that precisely\n        names one logical node is another\
    \ example.  (Note well that not\n        all FQDNs meet this definition.)\n  \
    \ 8.   Various other names (i.e., other than addresses, locators, or\n       \
    \ identifiers), each of which has the sole purpose of identifying\n        a component\
    \ of a logical system or physical device, might exist\n        at various protocol\
    \ layers in the Internet architecture.\n   9.   The Research Group has rough consensus\
    \ that separating identity\n        from location is desirable and technically\
    \ feasible.  However,\n        the Research Group does NOT have consensus on the\
    \ best\n        engineering approach to such an identity/location split.\n   10.\
    \  The Research Group has consensus that the Internet needs to\n        support\
    \ multihoming in a manner that scales well and does not\n        have prohibitive\
    \ costs.\n   11.  Any IETF solution to Internet scaling has to not only support\n\
    \        multihoming, but address the real-world constraints of the end\n    \
    \    customers (large and small).\n"

    \   local, potentially caching) Map Resolvers and with globally\n   distributed\
    \ query servers: ETRs and optional Map Servers (MSes).\n   A fundamental problem\
    \ with any global query server network is that\n   the frequently long paths and\
    \ greater risk of packet loss may cause\n   ITRs to drop or significantly delay\
    \ the initial packets of many new\n   sessions.  ITRs drop the packet(s) they\
    \ have no mapping for.  After\n   the mapping arrives, the ITR waits for a re-sent\
    \ packet and will\n   tunnel that packet correctly.  These \"initial-packet delays\"\
    \ reduce\n   performance and so create a major barrier to voluntary adoption on\
    \ a\n   wide enough basis to solve the routing scaling problem.\n   ALT's delays\
    \ are compounded by its structure being \"aggressively\n   aggregated\", without\
    \ regard to the geographic location of the\n   routers.  Tunnels between ALT routers\
    \ will often span\n   intercontinental distances and traverse many Internet routers.\n\
    \   The many levels to which a query typically ascends in the ALT\n   hierarchy\
    \ before descending towards its destination will often\n   involve excessively\
    \ long geographic paths and so worsen initial-\n   packet delays.\n   No solution\
    \ has been proposed for these problems or for the\n   contradiction between the\
    \ need for high aggregation while making the\n   ALT structure robust against\
    \ single points of failure.\n   LISP's ITRs' multihoming service restoration depends\
    \ on their\n   determining the reachability of end-user networks via two or more\n\
    \   ETRs.  Large numbers of ITRs doing this is inefficient and may\n   overburden\
    \ ETRs.\n   Testing reachability of the ETRs is complex and costly -- and\n  \
    \ insufficient.  ITRs cannot test network reachability via each ETR,\n   since\
    \ the ITRs do not have the address of a device in each ETR's\n   network.  So,\
    \ ETRs must report network unreachability to ITRs.\n   LISP involves complex communication\
    \ between ITRs and ETRs, with UDP\n   and 64-bit LISP headers in all traffic packets.\n\
    \   The advantage of LISP+ALT is that its ability to handle billions of\n   EIDs\
    \ is not constrained by the need to transmit or store the mapping\n   to any one\
    \ location.  Such numbers, beyond a few tens of millions of\n   EIDs, will only\
    \ result if the system is used for mobility.  Yet the\n   concerns just mentioned\
    \ about ALT's structure arise from the millions\n   of ETRs that would be needed\
    \ just for non-mobile networks.\n   In LISP's mobility approach, each Mobile Node\
    \ (MN) needs an RLOC\n   address to be its own ETR, meaning the MN cannot be behind\
    \ a NAT.\n   Mapping changes must be sent instantly to all relevant ITRs every\n\
    \   time the MN gets a new address -- LISP cannot achieve this.\n   In order to\
    \ enforce ISP filtering of incoming packets by source\n   address, LISP ITRs would\
    \ have to implement the same filtering on each\n   decapsulated packet.  This\
    \ may be prohibitively expensive.\n   LISP monolithically integrates multihoming\
    \ failure detection and\n   restoration decision-making processes into the Core-Edge\
    \ Separation\n   (CES) scheme itself.  End-user networks must rely on the necessarily\n\
    \   limited capabilities that are built into every ITR.\n   LISP+ALT may be able\
    \ to solve the routing scaling problem, but\n   alternative approaches would be\
    \ superior because they eliminate the\n   initial-packet delay problem and give\
    \ end-user networks real-time\n   control over ITR tunneling.\n"

    \ introduces a\n   host identifier layer between the network layer and the transport\n\
    \   layer, and the transport-layer associations (i.e., TCP connections)\n   are\
    \ no longer bound to IP addresses, but to host identifiers.  The\n   major difference\
    \ from HIP is that the host identifier in RANGI is a\n   128-bit hierarchical\
    \ and cryptographic identifier that has\n   organizational structure.  As a result,\
    \ the corresponding ID->locator\n   mapping system for such identifiers has a\

    \ (LD ID)\n   (i.e., the leftmost 96 bits) of this locator is a provider-assigned\n\

- title: 3.2.  Critique
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Critique\n   RANGI is an ID/locator split protocol that, like HIP, places\
    \ a\n   cryptographically signed ID between the network layer (IPv6) and\n   transport.\
    \  Unlike the HIP ID, the RANGI ID has a hierarchical\n   structure that allows\
    \ it to support ID->locator lookups.  This\n   hierarchical structure addresses\
    \ two weaknesses of the flat HIP ID:\n   the difficulty of doing the ID->locator\
    \ lookup, and the\n   administrative scalability of doing firewall filtering on\
    \ flat IDs.\n   The usage of this hierarchy is overloaded: it serves to make the\
    \ ID\n   unique, to drive the lookup process, and possibly other things like\n\
    \   firewall filtering.  More thought is needed as to what constitutes\n   these\
    \ levels with respect to these various roles.\n   The RANGI document [RANGI] suggests\
    \ FQDN->ID lookup through DNS, and\n   separately an ID->locator lookup that may\
    \ be DNS or may be something\n   else (a hierarchy of DHTs).  It would be more\
    \ efficient if the FQDN\n   lookup produces both ID and locators (as does the\
    \ Identifier-Locator\n   Network Protocol (ILNP)).  Probably DNS alone is sufficient\
    \ for the\n   ID->locator lookup since individual DNS servers can hold very large\n\
    \   numbers of mappings.\n   RANGI provides strong sender identification, but\
    \ at the cost of\n   computing crypto.  Many hosts (public web servers) may prefer\
    \ to\n   forgo the crypto at the expense of losing some functionality\n   (receiver\
    \ mobility or dynamic multihoming load balancing).  While\n   RANGI doesn't require\
    \ that the receiver validate the sender, it may\n   be good to have a mechanism\
    \ whereby the receiver can signal to the\n   sender that it is not validating,\
    \ so that the sender can avoid\n   locator changes.\n   Architecturally, there\
    \ are many advantages to putting the mapping\n   function at the end host (versus\
    \ at the edge).  This simplifies the\n   problems of neighbor aliveness and delayed\
    \ first packet, and avoids\n   stateful middleboxes.  Unfortunately, the early-adopter\
    \ incentive for\n   host upgrade may not be adequate (HIP's lack of uptake being\
    \ an\n   example).\n   RANGI does not have an explicit solution for the mobility\
    \ race\n   condition (there is no mention of a home-agent-like device).\n   However,\
    \ host-to-host notification combined with fallback on the\n   ID->locators lookup\
    \ (assuming adequate dynamic update of the lookup\n   system) may be good enough\
    \ for the vast majority of mobility\n   situations.\n   RANGI uses proxies to\
    \ deal with both legacy IPv6 and IPv4 sites.\n   RANGI proxies have no mechanisms\
    \ to deal with the edge-to-edge\n   aliveness problem.  The edge-to-edge proxy\
    \ approach dirties up an\n   otherwise clean end-to-end model.\n   RANGI exploits\
    \ existing IPv6 transition technologies (ISATAP and\n   softwire).  These transition\
    \ technologies are in any event being\n   pursued outside of RRG and do not need\
    \ to be specified in RANGI\n   drafts per se.  RANGI only needs to address how\
    \ it interoperates with\n   IPv4 and legacy IPv6, which it appears to do adequately\
    \ well through\n   proxies.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Rebuttal
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Rebuttal\n   The reason why the ID->locator lookup is separated from the\
    \ FQDN->ID\n   lookup is: 1) not all applications are tied to FQDNs, and 2) it\
    \ seems\n   unnecessary to require all devices to possess a FQDN of their own.\n\
    \   Basically, RANGI uses DNS to realize the ID->locator mapping system.\n   If\
    \ there are too many entries to be maintained by the authoritative\n   servers\
    \ of a given Administrative Domain (AD), Distributed Hash Table\n   (DHT) technology\
    \ can be used to make these authoritative servers\n   scale better, e.g., the\
    \ mappings maintained by a given AD will be\n   distributed among a group of authoritative\
    \ servers in a DHT fashion.\n   As a result, the robustness feature of DHT is\
    \ inherited naturally\n   into the ID->locator mapping system.  Meanwhile, there\
    \ is no trust\n   issue since each AD authority runs its own DHT ring, which maintains\n\
    \   only the mappings for those identifiers that are administrated by\n   that\
    \ AD authority.\n   For host mobility, if communicating entities are RANGI nodes,\
    \ the\n   mobile node will notify the correspondent node of its new locator\n\
    \   once its locator changes due to a mobility or re-homing event.\n   Meanwhile,\
    \ it should also update its locator information in the\n   ID->locator mapping\
    \ system in a timely fashion by using the Secure\n   DNS Dynamic Update mechanism\
    \ defined in [RFC3007].  In case of\n   simultaneous mobility, at least one of\

  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Key Ideas\n   Ivip (pronounced eye-vip, est. 2007-06-15) is a Core-Edge\
    \ Separation\n   scheme for IPv4 and IPv6.  It provides multihoming, portability\
    \ of\n   address space, and inbound traffic engineering for end-user networks\n\
    \   of all sizes and types, including those of corporations, SOHO (Small\n   Office,\
    \ Home Office), and mobile devices.\n   Ivip meets all the constraints imposed\
    \ by the need for widespread\n   voluntary adoption [Ivip_Constraints].\n   Ivip's\
    \ global fast-push mapping distribution network is structured\n   like a cross-linked\
    \ multicast tree.  This pushes all mapping changes\n   to full-database query\
    \ servers (QSDs) within ISPs and end-user\n   networks that have ITRs.  Each mapping\
    \ change is sent to all QSDs\n   within a few seconds.  (Note: \"QSD\" is from\
    \ Query Server with full\n   Database.)\n   ITRs gain mapping information from\
    \ these local QSDs within a few tens\n   of milliseconds.  QSDs notify ITRs of\
    \ changed mappings with similarly\n   low latency.  ITRs tunnel all traffic packets\
    \ to the correct ETR\n   without significant delay.\n   Ivip's mapping consists\
    \ of a single ETR address for each range of\n   mapped address space.  Ivip ITRs\
    \ do not need to test reachability to\n   ETRs because the mapping is changed\
    \ in real-time to that of the\n   desired ETR.\n   End-user networks control the\
    \ mapping, typically by contracting a\n   specialized company to monitor the reachability\
    \ of their ETRs, and\n   change the mapping to achieve multihoming and/or traffic\
    \ engineering\n   (TE).  So, the mechanisms that control ITR tunneling are controlled\n\
    \   by the end-user networks in real-time and are completely separate\n   from\
    \ the Core-Edge Separation scheme itself.\n   ITRs can be implemented in dedicated\
    \ servers or hardware-based\n   routers.  The ITR function can also be integrated\
    \ into sending hosts.\n   ETRs are relatively simple and only communicate with\
    \ ITRs rarely --\n   for Path MTU management with longer packets.\n   Ivip-mapped\
    \ ranges of end-user address space need not be subnets.\n   They can be of any\
    \ length, in units of IPv4 addresses or IPv6 /64s.\n   Compared to conventional\
    \ unscalable BGP techniques, and to the use of\n   Core-Edge Separation architectures\
    \ with non-real-time mapping\n   systems, end-user networks will be able to achieve\
    \ more flexible and\n   responsive inbound TE.  If inbound traffic is split into\
    \ several\n   streams, each to addresses in different mapped ranges, then real-time\n\
    \   mapping changes can be used to steer the streams between multiple\n   ETRs\
    \ at multiple ISPs.\n   Default ITRs in the DFZ (DITRs; similar to LISP's Proxy\
    \ Tunnel\n   Routers) tunnel packets sent by hosts in networks that lack ITRs.\
    \  So\n   multihoming, portability, and TE benefits apply to all traffic.\n  \
    \ ITRs request mappings either directly from a local QSD or via one or\n   more\
    \ layers of caching query servers (QSCs), which in turn request it\n   from a\
    \ local QSD.  QSCs are optional but generally desirable since\n   they reduce\
    \ the query load on QSDs.  (Note: \"QSC\" is from Query\n   Server with Cache.)\n\
    \   ETRs may be in ISP or end-user networks.  IP-in-IP encapsulation is\n   used,\
    \ so there is no UDP or any other header.  PMTUD (Path MTU\n   Discovery) management\
    \ with minimal complexity and overhead will\n   handle the problems caused by\
    \ encapsulation, and adapt smoothly to\n   jumbo frame paths becoming available\
    \ in the DFZ.  The outer header's\n   source address is that of the sending host\
    \ -- this enables existing\n   ISP Border Router (BR) filtering of source addresses\
    \ to be extended\n   to encapsulated traffic packets by the simple mechanism of\
    \ the ETR\n   dropping packets whose inner and outer source address do not match.\n"

- title: 4.2.  Critique
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Critique\n   Looked at from the thousand-foot level, Ivip shares the basic\
    \ design\n   approaches with LISP and a number of other map-and-encap designs\n\
    \   based on the Core-Edge Separation.  However, the details differ\n   substantially.\
    \  Ivip's design makes a bold assumption that, with\n   technology advances, one\
    \ could afford to maintain a real-time\n   distributed global mapping database\
    \ for all networks and hosts.  Ivip\n   proposes that multiple parties collaborate\
    \ to build a mapping\n   distribution system that pushes all mapping information\
    \ and updates\n   to local, full-database query servers located in all ISPs within\
    \ a\n   few seconds.  The system has no single point of failure and uses end-\n\
    \   to-end authentication.\n   A \"real time, globally synchronized mapping database\"\
    \ is a critical\n   assumption in Ivip.  Using that as a foundation, Ivip design\
    \ avoids\n   several challenging design issues that others have studied\n   extensively,\
    \ that include\n   1.  special considerations of mobility support that add additional\n\
    \       complexity to the overall system;\n   2.  prompt detection of ETR failures\
    \ and notification to all relevant\n       ITRs, which turns out to be a rather\
    \ difficult problem; and\n   3.  development of a partial-mapping lookup sub-system.\
    \  Ivip assumes\n       the existence of local query servers with a full database\
    \ with\n       the latest mapping information changes.\n   To be considered as\
    \ a viable solution to the Internet routing\n   scalability problem, Ivip faces\
    \ two fundamental questions.  First,\n   whether a global-scale system can achieve\
    \ real-time synchronized\n   operations as assumed by Ivip is an entirely open\
    \ question.  Past\n   experiences suggest otherwise.\n   The second question concerns\
    \ incremental rollout.  Ivip represents an\n   ambitious approach, with real-time\
    \ mapping and local full-database\n   query servers -- which many people regard\
    \ as impossible.  Developing\n   and implementing Ivip may take a fair amount\
    \ of resources, yet there\n   is an open question regarding how to quantify the\
    \ gains by first\n   movers -- both those who will provide the Ivip infrastructure\
    \ and\n   those that will use it.  Significant global routing table reduction\n\
    \   only happens when a large enough number of parties have adopted Ivip.\n  \
    \ The same question arises for most other proposals as well.\n   One belief is\
    \ that Ivip's more ambitious mapping system makes a good\n   design tradeoff for\
    \ the greater benefits for end-user networks and\n   for those that develop the\
    \ infrastructure.  Another belief is that\n   this ambitious design is not viable.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Rebuttal
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Rebuttal\n   Since the Summary and Critique were written, Ivip's mapping\
    \ system\n   has been significantly redesigned: DRTM - Distributed Real Time\n\
    \   Mapping [Ivip_DRTM].\n   DRTM makes it easier for ISPs to install their own\
    \ ITRs.  It also\n   facilitates Mapped Address Block (MAB) operating companies\
    \ -- which\n   need not be ISPs -- leasing Scalable Provider-Independent (SPI)\n\
    \   address space to end-user networks with almost no ISP involvement.\n   ISPs\
    \ need not install ITRs or ETRs.  For an ISP to support its\n   customers using\
    \ SPI space, they need only allow the forwarding of\n   outgoing packets whose\
    \ source addresses are from SPI space.  End-user\n   networks can implement their\
    \ own ETRs on their existing PA\n   address(es) -- and MAB operating companies\
    \ make all the initial\n   investments.\n   Once SPI adoption becomes widespread,\
    \ ISPs will be motivated to\n   install their own ITRs to locally tunnel packets\
    \ that are sent from\n   customer networks and that must be tunneled to SPI-using\
    \ customers of\n   the same ISP -- rather than letting these packets exit the\
    \ ISP's\n   network and return in tunnels to ETRs in the network.\n   There is\
    \ no need for full-database query servers in ISPs or for any\n   device that stores\
    \ the full mapping information for all Mapped\n   Address Blocks (MABs).  ISPs\
    \ that want ITRs will install two or more\n   Map Resolver (MR) servers.  These\
    \ are caching query servers which\n   query multiple (typically nearby) query\
    \ servers that are full-\n   database for the subset of MABs they serve.  These\
    \ \"nearby\" query\n   servers will be at DITR sites, which will be run by, or\
    \ for, MAB\n   operating companies who lease MAB space to large numbers of end-user\n\
    \   networks.  These DITR-site servers will usually be close enough to\n   the\
    \ MRs to generate replies with sufficiently low delay and risk of\n   packet loss\
    \ for ITRs to buffer initial packets for a few tens of\n   milliseconds while\
    \ the mapping arrives.\n   DRTM will scale to billions of micronets, tens of thousands\
    \ of MABs,\n   and potentially hundreds of MAB operating companies, without single\n\
    \   points of failure or central coordination.\n   The critique implies a threshold\
    \ of adoption is required before\n   significant routing scaling benefits occur.\
    \  This is untrue of any\n   Core-Edge Separation proposal, including LISP and\
    \ Ivip.  Both can\n   achieve scalable routing benefits in direct proportion to\
    \ their level\n   of adoption by providing portability, multihoming, and inbound\
    \ TE to\n   large numbers of end-user networks.\n   Core-Edge Elimination (CEE)\
    \ architectures require all Internet\n   communications to change to IPv6 with\
    \ a new locator/identifier\n   separation naming model.  This would impose burdens\
    \ of extra\n   management effort, packets, and session establishment delays on\
    \ all\n   hosts -- which is a particularly unacceptable burden on battery-\n \
    \  operated mobile hosts that rely on wireless links.\n   Core-Edge Separation\
    \ architectures retain the current, efficient,\n   naming model, require no changes\
    \ to hosts, and support both IPv4 and\n   IPv6.  Ivip is the most promising architecture\
    \ for future development\n   because its scalable, distributed, real-time mapping\
    \ system best\n   supports TTR mobility, enables ITRs to be simpler, and gives\

- title: 5.1.1.  Key Idea
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Key Idea\n   The Hierarchical IPv4 Framework (hIPv4) adds scalability\
    \ to the\n   routing architecture by introducing additional hierarchy in the IPv4\n\
    \   address space.  The IPv4 addressing scheme is divided into two parts,\n  \
    \ the Area Locator (ALOC) address space, which is globally unique, and\n   the\
    \ Endpoint Locator (ELOC) address space, which is only regionally\n   unique.\
    \  The ALOC and ELOC prefixes are added as a shim header\n   between the IP header\
    \ and transport protocol header; the shim header\n   is identified with a new\
    \ protocol number in the IP header.  Instead\n   of creating a tunneling (i.e.,\
    \ overlay) solution, a new routing\n   element is needed in the service provider's\
    \ routing domain (called\n   ALOC realm) -- a Locator Swap Router.  The current\
    \ IPv4 forwarding\n   plane remains intact, and no new routing protocols, mapping\
    \ systems,\n   or caching solutions are required.  The control plane of the ALOC\n\
    \   realm routers needs some modification in order for ICMP to be\n   compatible\
    \ with the hIPv4 framework.  When an area (one or several\n   autonomous systems\
    \ (ASes)) of an ISP has transformed into an ALOC\n   realm, only ALOC prefixes\
    \ are exchanged with other ALOC realms.\n   Directly attached ELOC prefixes are\
    \ only inserted to the RIB of the\n   local ALOC realm; ELOC prefixes are not\
    \ distributed to the DFZ.\n   Multihoming can be achieved in two ways, either\
    \ the enterprise\n   requests an ALOC prefix from the RIR (this is not recommended)\
    \ or the\n   enterprise receives the ALOC prefixes from their upstream ISPs. \
    \ ELOC\n   prefixes are PI addresses and remain intact when an upstream ISP is\n\
    \   changed; only the ALOC prefix is replaced.  When the RIB of the DFZ\n   is\
    \ compressed (containing only ALOC prefixes), ingress routers will\n   no longer\
    \ know the availability of the destination prefix; thus, the\n   endpoints must\
    \ take more responsibility for their sessions.  This can\n   be achieved by using\
    \ multipath enabled transport protocols, such as\n   SCTP [RFC4960] and Multipath\
    \ TCP (MPTCP) [MPTCP_Arch], at the\n   endpoints.  The multipath transport protocols\
    \ also provide a session\n   identifier, i.e., verification tag or token; thus,\
    \ the location and\n   identifier split is carried out -- site mobility, endpoint\
    \ mobility,\n   and mobile site mobility are achieved.  DNS needs to be upgraded:\
    \ in\n   order to resolve the location of an endpoint, the endpoint must have\n\
    \   one ELOC value (current A-record) and at least one ALOC value in DNS\n   (in\
    \ multihoming solutions there will be several ALOC values for an\n   endpoint).\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Gains
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Gains\n   1.  Improved routing scalability: Adding additional hierarchy\
    \ to the\n       address space enables more hierarchy in the routing architecture.\n\
    \       Early adapters of an ALOC realm will no longer carry the current\n   \
    \    RIB of the DFZ -- only ELOC prefixes of their directly attached\n       networks\
    \ and ALOC prefixes from other service providers that have\n       migrated are\
    \ installed in the ALOC realm's RIB.\n   2.  Scalable support for traffic engineering:\
    \ Multipath enabled\n       transport protocols are recommended to achieve dynamic\
    \ load-\n       balancing of a session.  Support for Valiant Load-balancing (VLB)\n\
    \       [Valiant] schemes has been added to the framework; more research\n   \
    \    work is required around VLB switching.\n   3.  Scalable support for multihoming:\
    \ Only attachment points of a\n       multihomed site are advertised (using the\
    \ ALOC prefix) in the\n       DFZ.  DNS will inform the requester on how many\
    \ attachment points\n       the destination endpoint has.  It is the initiating\
    \ endpoint's\n       choice/responsibility to choose which attachment point is\
    \ used\n       for the session; endpoints using multipath-enabled transport\n\
    \       protocols can make use of several attachment points for a\n       session.\n\
    \   4.  Simplified Renumbering: When changing provider, the local ELOC\n     \
    \  prefixes remains intact; only the ALOC prefix is changed at the\n       endpoints.\
    \  The ALOC prefix is not used for routing or forwarding\n       decisions in\
    \ the local network.\n   5.  Decoupling Location and Identifier: The verification\
    \ tag (SCTP)\n       and token (MPTCP) can be considered to have the characteristics\n\
    \       of a session identifier, and thus a session layer is created\n       between\
    \ the transport and application layers in the TCP/IP model.\n   6.  Routing quality:\
    \ The hIPv4 framework introduces no tunneling or\n       caching mechanisms. \
    \ Only a swap of the content in the IPv4\n       header and locator header at\
    \ the destination ALOC realm is\n       required; thus, current routing and forwarding\
    \ algorithms are\n       preserved as such.  Valiant Load-balancing might be used\
    \ as a new\n       forwarding mechanism.\n   7.  Routing Security: Similar as\
    \ with today's DFZ, except that ELOC\n       prefixes cannot be hijacked (by injecting\
    \ a longest match prefix)\n       outside an ALOC realm.\n   8.  Deployability:\
    \ The hIPv4 framework is an evolution of the current\n       IPv4 framework and\
    \ is backwards compatible with the current IPv4\n       framework.  Sessions in\
    \ a local network and inside an ALOC realm\n       might in the future still use\
    \ the current IPv4 framework.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.2.  Critique\n   hIPv4 is an innovative approach to expanding the IPv4 addressing\n\
    \   system in order to resolve the scalable routing problem.  This\n   critique\
    \ does not attempt a full assessment of hIPv4's architecture\n   and mechanisms.\
    \  The only question addressed here is whether hIPv4\n   should be chosen for\
    \ IETF development in preference to, or together\n   with, the only two proposals\
    \ which appear to be practical solutions\n   for IPv4: Ivip and LISP.\n   Ivip\
    \ and LISP appear to have a major advantage over hIPv4 in terms of\n   support\
    \ for packets sent from non-upgraded hosts/networks.  Ivip's\n   DITRs (Default\
    \ ITRs in the DFZ) and LISP's PTRs (Proxy Tunnel\n   Routers) both accept packets\
    \ sent by any non-upgraded host/network\n   and tunnel them to the correct ETR\
    \ -- thus providing the full\n   benefits of portability, multihoming, and inbound\
    \ TE for these\n   packets as well as those sent by hosts in networks with ITRs.\
    \ hIPv4\n   appears to have no such mechanism, so these benefits are only\n  \
    \ available for communications between two upgraded hosts in upgraded\n   networks.\n\
    \   This means that significant benefits for adopters -- the ability to\n   rely\
    \ on the new system to provide the portability, multihoming, and\n   inbound TE\
    \ benefits for all, or almost all, their communications --\n   will only arise\
    \ after all, or almost all, networks upgrade their\n   networks, hosts, and addressing\

  contents:
  - "6.1.1.  Key Idea\n   The basic idea is to add a name overlay (NOL) onto the existing\n\
    \   TCP/IP stack.\n   Its functions include:\n   1.  Managing host name configuration,\
    \ registration, and\n       authentication;\n   2.  Initiating and managing transport\
    \ connection channels (i.e.,\n       TCP/IP connections) by name;\n   3.  Keeping\
    \ application data transport continuity for mobility.\n   At the edge network,\
    \ we introduce a new type of gateway, a Name\n   Transfer Relay (NTR), which blocks\
    \ the PI addresses of edge networks\n   into upstream transit networks.  NTRs\
    \ perform address and/or port\n   translation between blocked PI addresses and\
    \ globally routable\n   addresses, which seem like today's widely used NAT / Network\
    \ Address\n   Port Translation (NAPT) devices.  Both legacy and NOL applications\n\
    \   behind a NTR can access the outside as usual.  To access the hosts\n   behind\
    \ a NTR from outside, we need to use NOL to traverse the NTR by\n   name and initiate\
    \ connections to the hosts behind it.\n   Different from proposed host-based ID/locator\
    \ split solutions, such\n   as HIP, Shim6, and name-oriented stack, NOL doesn't\
    \ need to change\n   the existing TCP/IP stack, sockets, or their packet formats.\
    \  NOL can\n   coexist with the legacy infrastructure, and the Core-Edge Separation\n\
    \   solutions (e.g., APT, LISP, Six/One, Ivip, etc.).\n"

    \ overlay\n       library to be NOL-enabled.  The legacy software that is not\n\
    \       maintained will not be able to benefit from NOL in the Core-Edge\n   \
    \    Elimination situation.  In the Core-Edge Separation scheme, a new\n     \
    \  gateway NTR is deployed to prevent edge-specific PI prefixes from\n       leaking\
    \ into the transit core.  NOL doesn't impede the legacy\n       endpoints behind\
    \ the NTR from accessing the outside Internet, but\n       the legacy endpoints\
    \ cannot access or will have difficultly\n       accessing the endpoints behind\
    \ a NTR without the help of NOL.\n   2.  In the case of Core-Edge Elimination,\
    \ the end site will be\n       assigned multiple PA address spaces, which leads\
    \ to renumbering\n       troubles when switching to other upstream providers.\
    \  Upgrading\n       endpoints to support NOL doesn't give any benefits to edge\n\
    \       networks.  Endpoints have little incentive to use NOL in a Core-\n   \
    \    Edge Elimination scenario, and the same is true with other host-\n      \
    \ based ID/locator split proposals.  Whether they are IPv4 or IPv6\n       networks,\
    \ edge networks prefer PI address space to PA address\n       space.\n   3.  In\
    \ the Core-Edge Separation scenario, the additional gateway NTR\n       is to\
    \ prevent the specific prefixes from the edge networks, just\n       like a NAT\
    \ or the ITR/ETR of LISP.  A NTR gateway can be seen as\n       an extension of\
    \ NAT (Network Address Translation).  Although NATs\n       are deployed widely,\
    \ upgrading them to support NOL extension or\n       deploying additional new\
    \ gateway NTRs at the edge networks is on\n       a voluntary basis and has few\
    \ economic incentives.\n   4.  The stateful or stateless translation for each\
    \ packet traversing\n       a NTR will require the cost of the CPU and memory\
    \ of NTRs, and\n       increase forwarding delay.  Thus, it is not appropriate\
    \ to deploy\n       NTRs at the high-level transit networks where aggregated traffic\n\
    \       may cause congestion at the NTRs.\n   5.  In the Core-Edge Separation\
    \ scenario, the requirement for\n       multihoming and inter-domain traffic engineering\
    \ will make end\n       sites accessible via multiple different NTRs.  For reliability,\n\
    \       all of the associations between multiple NTRs and the end site\n     \
    \  name will be kept in DNS, which may increase the load on DNS.\n   6.  To support\
    \ mobility, it is necessary for DNS to update the\n       corresponding name-NTR\
    \ mapping records when an end system moves\n       from behind one NTR to another\
    \ NTR.  The NOL-enabled end relies\n       on the NOL layer to preserve the continuity\
    \ of the transport\n       layer, since the underlying TCP/UDP transport session\
    \ would be\n       broken when the IP address changed.\n"

  - "6.3.  Rebuttal\n   NOL resembles neither CEE nor CES as a solution.  By supporting\n\
    \   application-level sessions through the name overlay layer, NOL can\n   support\
    \ some solutions in the CEE style.  However, NOL is in general\n   closer to CES\
    \ solutions, i.e., preventing PI prefixes of edge\n   networks from entering into\
    \ the upstream transit networks.  This is\n   done by the NTR, like the ITRs/ETRs\
    \ in CES solutions, but NOL has no\n   need to define the clear boundary between\
    \ core and edge networks.\n   NOL is designed to try to provide end users or networks\
    \ a service\n   that facilitates the adoption of multihoming, multipath routing,\
    \ and\n   traffic engineering by the indirect routing through NTRs, and that,\n\
    \   in the mean time, doesn't accelerate or decelerate the growth of\n   global\
    \ routing table size.\n   Some problems are described in the NOL critique.  In\
    \ the original NOL\n   proposal document, the DNS query for a host that is behind\
    \ a NTR will\n   induce the return of the actual IP addresses of the host and\
    \ the\n   address of the NTR.  This arrangement might cause some difficulties\n\
    \   for legacy applications due to the non-standard response from DNS.\n   To\
    \ resolve this problem, we instead have the NOL service use a new\n   namespace,\
    \ and have DNS not return NTR IP addresses for the legacy\n   hosts.  The names\
    \ used for NOL are formatted like email addresses,\n   such as \"des@example.net\"\
    .  The mapping between \"example.net\" and the\n   IP address of the corresponding\
    \ NTR will be registered in DNS.  The\n   NOL layer will understand the meaning\
    \ of the name \"des@example.net\" ,\n   and it will send a query to DNS only for\
    \ \"example.net\".  DNS will\n   then return IP addresses of the corresponding\
    \ NTRs.  Legacy\n   applications will still use the traditional FQDN name, and\
    \ DNS will\n   return the actual IP address of the host.  However, if the host\
    \ is\n   behind a NTR, the legacy applications may be unable to access the\n \
    \  host.\n   The stateless address translation or stateful address and port\n\
    \   translation may cause a scaling problem with the number of table\n   entries\
    \ NTR must maintain, and legacy applications cannot initiate\n   sessions with\
    \ hosts inside the NOL-adopting End User Network (EUN).\n   However, these problems\
    \ may not be a big barrier for the deployment\n   of NOL or other similar approaches.\
    \  Many NAT-like boxes, proxy, and\n   firewall devices are widely used at the\
    \ ingress/egress points of\n   enterprise networks, campus networks, or other\

  - "7.2.  Critique\n   The CRM proposal is not a complete proposal and therefore\
    \ cannot be\n   considered for further development by the IETF as a scalable routing\n\
    \   solution.\n   While Compact Routing principles may be able to improve a mapping\n\
    \   overlay structure such as LISP+ALT, there are several objections to\n   this\
    \ approach.\n   Firstly, a CRM-modified ALT structure would still be a global\
    \ query\n   server system.  No matter how ALT's path lengths and delays are\n\
    \   optimized, there is a problem with a querier -- which could be\n   anywhere\
    \ in the world -- relying on mapping information from one or\n   ideally two or\
    \ more authoritative query servers, which could also be\n   anywhere in the world.\
    \  The delays and risks of packet loss that are\n   inherent in such a system\
    \ constitute a fundamental problem.  This is\n   especially true when multiple,\
    \ potentially long, traffic streams are\n   received by ITRs and forwarded over\
    \ the CRM networks for delivery to\n   the destination network.  ITRs must use\
    \ the CRM infrastructure while\n   they are awaiting a map reply.  The traffic\
    \ forwarded on the CRM\n   infrastructure functions as map requests and can present\
    \ a\n   scalability and performance issue to the infrastructure.\n   Secondly,\
    \ the alterations contemplated in this proposal involve the\n   roles of particular\
    \ nodes in the network being dynamically assigned\n   as part of the network's\
    \ self-organizing nature.\n   The discussion of clustering in the middle of page\
    \ 4 of [CRM] also\n   indicates that particular nodes are responsible for registering\
    \ EIDs\n   from typically far-distant ETRs, all of which are handling closely\n\
    \   related EIDs that this node can aggregate.  Since MSes are apparently\n  \
    \ nodes within the compact routing system, and the process of an MS\n   deciding\
    \ whether to accept EID registrations is determined as part of\n   the self-organizing\
    \ properties of the system, there are concerns\n   about how EID registration\
    \ can be performed securely, when no\n   particular physical node is responsible\
    \ for it.\n   Thirdly, there are concerns about individually owned nodes performing\n\
    \   work for other organizations.  Such problems of trust and of\n   responsibilities\
    \ and costs being placed on those who do not directly\n   benefit already exist\
    \ in the inter-domain routing system and are a\n   challenge for any scalable\
    \ routing solution.\n   There are simpler solutions to the mapping problem than\
    \ having an\n   elaborate network of routers.  If a global-scale query system\
    \ is\n   still preferred, then it would be better to have ITRs use local MRs,\n\
    \   each of which is dynamically configured to know the IP address of the\n  \
    \ million or so authoritative Map Server (MS) query servers -- or two\n   million\
    \ or so assuming they exist in pairs for redundancy.\n   It appears that the inherently\
    \ greater delays and risks of packet\n   loss of global query server systems make\
    \ them unsuitable mapping\n   solutions for Core-Edge Elimination or Core-Edge\
    \ Separation\n   architectures.  The solution to these problems appears to involve\
    \ a\n   greater number of widely distributed authoritative query servers, one\n\
    \   or more of which will therefore be close enough to each querier that\n   delays\
    \ and risk of packet loss are reduced to acceptable levels.\n   Such a structure\
    \ would be suitable for map requests, but perhaps not\n   for handling traffic\
    \ packets to be delivered to the destination\n   networks.\n"

    \ for\n   storage and updates and to achieve quick indexing for lookups.\n   However,\
    \ LMS advocates an ISP-independent mapping system, and ETRs\n   are not the authorities\
    \ of mapping data.  ETRs or edge-sites report\n   their mapping data to related\
    \ mapping servers.\n   LMS assumes that mapping servers can be incrementally deployed\
    \ in\n   that a server may not be constructed if none of its administered edge\n\
    \   addresses are allocated, and that mapping servers can charge for\n   their\
    \ services, which provides the economic incentive for their\n   existence.  How\
    \ this brand-new system can be constructed is still not\n   clear.  Explicit layering\
    \ is only an ideal state, and the proposal\n   analyzes the layering limits and\
    \ feasibility, rather than provide a\n   practical way for deployment.\n   The\
    \ drawbacks of LMS's feasibility analysis also include that it 1)\n   is based\
    \ on current PC power and may not represent future\n   circumstances (especially\
    \ for IPv6), and 2) does not consider the\n   variability of address utilization.\
    \  Some IP address spaces may be\n   effectively allocated and used while some\
    \ may not, causing some\n   mapping servers to be overloaded while others are\
    \ poorly utilized.\n   More thoughts are needed as to the flexibility of the layer\
    \ design.\n   LMS doesn't fit well for mobility.  It does not solve the problem\n\
    \   when hosts move faster than the mapping updates and propagation\n   between\
    \ relative mapping servers.  On the other hand, mobile hosts'\n   moving across\
    \ ASes and changing their attachment points (core\n   addresses) is less frequent\
    \ than hosts' moving within an AS.\n   Separation needs two planes: Core-Edge\
    \ Separation (which is to gain\n   routing table scalability) and identity/location\
    \ separation (which is\n   to achieve mobility).  The Global Locator, Local Locator,\
    \ and\n   Identifier (GLI) scheme does a good clarification of this, and in\n\
    \   that case, LMS can be used to provide identity-to-core address\n   mapping.\
    \  Of course, other schemes may be competent, and LMS can be\n   incorporated\
    \ with them if the scheme has global keys and needs to map\n   them to other namespaces.\n"

  - "10.2.  Critique\n   GLI-Split makes a clear distinction between two separation\
    \ planes:\n   the separation between identifier and locator (which is to meet\
    \ end-\n   users' needs including mobility) and the separation between local and\n\
    \   global locator (which makes the global routing table scalable).  The\n   distinction\
    \ is needed since ISPs and hosts have different\n   requirements, with both needing\
    \ to make the changes inside and\n   outside GLI-domains invisible to their opposites.\n\
    \   A main drawback of GLI-Split is that it puts a burden on hosts.\n   Before\
    \ routing a packet received from upper layers, network stacks in\n   hosts first\
    \ need to resolve the DNS name to an IP address; if the IP\n   address is GLI-formed,\
    \ it may look up the map from the identifier\n   extracted from the IP address\
    \ to the local locator.  If the\n   communication is between different GLI-domains,\
    \ hosts may further\n   look up the mapping from the identifier to the global\
    \ locator.\n   Having the local mapping system forward requests to the global\n\
    \   mapping system for hosts is just an option.  Though host lookup may\n   ease\
    \ the burden of intermediate nodes, which would otherwise to\n   perform the mapping\
    \ lookup, the three lookups by hosts in the worst\n   case may lead to large delays\
    \ unless a very efficient mapping\n   mechanism is devised.  The work may also\
    \ become impractical for low-\n   powered hosts.  On one hand, GLI-Split can provide\
    \ backward\n   compatibility where classic and upgraded IPv6 hosts can communicate.\n\
    \   This is its big virtue.  On the other hand, the need to upgrade may\n   work\
    \ against hosts' enthusiasm to change.  This is offset against the\n   benefits\
    \ they would gain.\n   GLI-Split provides additional features to improve TE and\
    \ to improve\n   resilience, e.g., exerting multipath routing.  However, the cost\
    \ is\n   that more burdens are placed on hosts, e.g., they may need more\n   lookup\
    \ actions and route selections.  However, these kinds of\n   tradeoffs between\
    \ costs and gains exist in most proposals.\n   One improvement of GLI-Split is\
    \ its support for mobility by updating\n   DNS data as GLI-hosts move across GLI-domains.\
    \  Through this, the\n   GLI-corresponding-node can query DNS to get a valid global\
    \ locator of\n   the GLI-mobile-node and need not query the global mapping system\n\
    \   (unless it wants to do multipath routing), giving more incentives for\n  \
    \ nodes to become GLI-enabled.  The merits of GLI-Split, including\n   simplified-mobility-handover\
    \ provision, compensate for the costs of\n   this improvement.\n   GLI-Split claims\
    \ to use rewriting instead of tunneling for\n   conversions between local and\
    \ global locators when packets span GLI-\n   domains.  The major advantage is\
    \ that this kind of rewriting needs no\n   extra state, since local and global\
    \ locators need not map to each\n   other.  Many other rewriting mechanisms instead\
    \ need to maintain\n   extra state.  It also avoids the MTU problem faced by the\
    \ tunneling\n   methods.  However, GLI-Split achieves this only by compressing\
    \ the\n   namespace size of each attribute (identifier and local/global\n   locator).\
    \  GLI-Split encodes two namespaces (identifier and local/\n   global locator)\
    \ into an IPv6 address (each has a size of 2^64 or\n   less), while map-and-encap\
    \ proposals assume that identifier and\n   locator each occupy a 128-bit space.\n"
- title: 10.3.  Rebuttal
  contents:
  - "10.3.  Rebuttal\n   The arguments in the GLI-Split critique are correct.  There\
    \ are only\n   two points that should be clarified here.  First, it is not a\n\
    \   drawback that hosts perform the mapping lookups.  Second, the\n   critique\
    \ proposed an improvement to the mobility mechanism, which is\n   of a general\
    \ nature and not specific to GLI-Split.\n   1.  The additional burden on the hosts\
    \ is actually a benefit,\n       compared to having the same burden on the gateways.\
    \  If the\n       gateway would perform the lookups and packets addressed to\n\
    \       uncached EIDs arrive, a lookup in the mapping system must be\n       initiated.\
    \  Until the mapping reply returns, packets must be\n       either dropped, cached,\
    \ or sent over the mapping system to the\n       destination.  All these options\
    \ are not optimal and have their\n       drawbacks.  To avoid these problems in\
    \ GLI-Split, the hosts\n       perform the lookup.  The short additional delay\
    \ is not a big\n       issue in the hosts because it happens before the first\
    \ packets\n       are sent.  So, no packets are lost or have to be cached.  GLI-\n\
    \       Split could also easily be adapted to special GLI-hosts (e.g.,\n     \
    \  low-power sensor nodes) that do not have to do any lookup and\n       simply\
    \ let the gateway do all the work.  This functionality is\n       included anyway\
    \ for backward compatibility with regular IPv6\n       hosts inside the GLI-domain.\n\
    \   2.  The critique proposes a DNS-based mobility mechanism as an\n       improvement\
    \ to GLI-Split.  However, this improvement is an\n       alternative mobility\
    \ approach that can be applied to any routing\n       architecture (including\
    \ GLI-Split) and also raises some concerns,\n       e.g., the update speed of\
    \ DNS.  Therefore, we prefer to keep this\n       issue out of the discussion.\n"

    \ that\n   distributes its mapping information via BGP messages that are passed\n\
    \   between DFZ routers.\n   This means that TIDR cannot solve the most important\
    \ goal of scalable\n   routing -- to accommodate much larger numbers of end-user\
    \ network\n   prefixes (millions or billions) without each such prefix directly\n\
    \   burdening every DFZ router.  Messages advertising routes for TIDR-\n   managed\
    \ prefixes may be handled with lower priority, but this would\n   only marginally\
    \ reduce the workload for each DFZ router compared to\n   handling an advertisement\
    \ of a conventional PI prefix.\n   Therefore, TIDR cannot be considered for RRG\
    \ recommendation as a\n   solution to the routing scaling problem.\n   For a TIDR-using\
    \ network to receive packets sent from any host, every\n   BR of all ISPs must\
    \ be upgraded to have the new ITR-like\n   functionality.  Furthermore, all DFZ\
    \ routers would need to be altered\n   so they accepted and correctly propagated\
    \ the routes for end-user\n   network address space, with the new LOCATOR attribute,\
    \ which contains\n   the ETR address and a REMOTE-PREFERENCE value.  Firstly,\
    \ if they\n   received two such advertisements with different LOCATORs, they would\n\
    \   advertise a single route to this prefix containing both.  Secondly,\n   for\
    \ end-user address space (for IPv4) to be more finely divided, the\n   DFZ routers\
    \ must propagate LOCATOR-containing advertisements for\n   prefixes longer than\
    \ /24.\n   TIDR's ITR-like routers store the full mapping database -- so there\n\
    \   would be no delay in obtaining mapping, and therefore no significant\n   delay\
    \ in tunneling traffic packets.\n   [TIDR] is written as if traffic packets are\
    \ classified by reference\n   to the RIB, but routers use the FIB for this purpose,\
    \ and \"FIB\" does\n   not appear in [TIDR].\n   TIDR does not specify a tunneling\
    \ technique, leaving this to be\n   chosen by the ETR-like function of BRs and\
    \ specified as part of a\n   second kind of new BGP route advertised by that ETR-like\
    \ BR.  There\n   is no provision for solving the PMTUD problems inherent in\n\
    \   encapsulation-based tunneling.\n   ITR functions must be performed by already\
    \ busy routers of ISPs,\n   rather than being distributed to other routers or\
    \ to sending hosts.\n   There is no practical support for mobility.  The mapping\
    \ in each end-\n   user route advertisement includes a REMOTE-PREFERENCE for each\
    \ ETR-\n   like BR, but this is used by the ITR-like functions of BRs to always\n\
    \   select the LOCATOR with the highest value.  As currently described,\n   TIDR\

    \ to find the next preferred\n   ETR-like BR's address.  The first ETR-like router\
    \ tunnels the packets\n   to the second ETR-like router in the other ISP.  However,\
    \ if the\n   failure was caused by the first ISP itself being unreachable, then\n\
    \   connectivity would not be restored until a revised mapping (with\n   higher\
    \ REMOTE-PREFERENCE) from the reachable ETR-like BR of the\n   second ISP propagated\

- title: 12.2.  Critique
  contents:
  - "12.2.  Critique\n   The primary issue for ILNP is how the deployment incentives\
    \ and\n   benefits line up with the RRG goal of reducing the rate of growth of\n\
    \   entries and churn in the core routing table.  If a site is currently\n   using\
    \ PI space, it can only stop advertising that space when the\n   entire site is\
    \ ILNP capable.  This needs (at least) clear elucidation\n   of the incentives\
    \ for ILNP which are not related to routing scaling,\n   in order for there to\
    \ be a path for this to address the RRG needs.\n   Similarly, the incentives for\
    \ upgrading hosts need to align with the\n   value for those hosts.\n   A closely\
    \ related question is whether this mechanism actually\n   addresses the sites\
    \ need for PI addresses.  Assuming ILNP is\n   deployed, the site does achieve\
    \ flexible, resilient, communication\n   using all of its Internet connections.\
    \  While the proposal addresses\n   the host updates when the host learns of provider\
    \ changes, there are\n   other aspects of provider change that are not addressed.\
    \  This\n   includes renumbering routers, subnets, and certain servers.  (It is\n\
    \   presumed that most servers, once the entire site has moved to ILNP,\n   will\
    \ not be concerned if their locator changes.  However, some\n   servers must have\
    \ known locators, such as the DNS server.)  The\n   issues described in [RFC5887]\
    \ will be ameliorated, but not resolved.\n   To be able to adopt this proposal,\
    \ and have sites use it, we need to\n   address these issues.  When a site changes\
    \ points of attachment, only\n   a small amount of DNS provisioning should be\
    \ required.  The LP\n   resource record type is apparently intended to help with\
    \ this.  It is\n   also likely that the use of dynamic DNS will help this.\n \
    \  The ILNP mechanism is described as being suitable for use in\n   conjunction\
    \ with mobility.  This raises the question of race\n   conditions.  To the degree\
    \ that mobility concerns are valid at this\n   time, it is worth asking how communication\
    \ can be established if a\n   node is sufficiently mobile that it is moving faster\
    \ than the DNS\n   update and DNS fetch cycle can effectively propagate changes.\n\
    \   This proposal does presume that all communication using this\n   mechanism\
    \ is tied to DNS names.  While it is true that most\n   communication does start\
    \ from a DNS name, it is not the case that all\n   exchanges have this property.\
    \  Some communication initiation and\n   referral can be done with an explicit\
    \ identifier/locator pair.  This\n   does appear to require some extensions to\
    \ the existing mechanism (for\n   both sides to add locators).  In general, some\
    \ additional clarity on\n   the assumptions regarding DNS, particularly for low-end\
    \ devices,\n   would seem appropriate.\n   One issue that this proposal shares\
    \ with many others is the question\n   of how to determine which locator pairs\
    \ (local and remote) are\n   actually functional.  This is an issue both for initial\n\
    \   communications establishment and for robustly maintaining\n   communication.\
    \  It is likely that a combination of monitoring of\n   traffic (in the host,\
    \ where this is tractable), coupled with other\n   active measures, can address\
    \ this.  ICMP is clearly insufficient.\n"

    \   (e.g., LISP) type of protocols.  These principles enhance the\n   efficiency\
    \ of the map-and-encap protocols in terms of (1) better\n   utilization of resources\
    \ (e.g., processing and memory) at Ingress\n   Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and mapping\

    \   networks, in spite of migration/re-homing of some subprefixes to\n   other\

  contents:
  - "13.1.2.  Management of Mapping Distribution of Subprefixes Spread across\n  \
    \       Multiple ETRs\n   To assist in this discussion, we start with the high\
    \ level\n   architecture of a map-and-encap approach (it would be helpful to see\n\
    \   Figure 1 in [EEMDP_Considerations]).  In this architecture, we have\n   the\
    \ usual ITRs, ETRs, delivery networks, etc.  In addition, we have\n   the ID-Locator\
    \ Mapping (ILM) servers, which are repositories for\n   complete mapping information,\
    \ while the ILM-Regional (ILM-R) servers\n   can contain partial and/or regionally\
    \ relevant mapping information.\n   While a large endpoint address space contained\
    \ in a prefix may be\n   mostly associated with the delivery networks served by\
    \ one ETR, some\n   fragments (subprefixes) of that address space may be located\n\
    \   elsewhere at other ETRs.  Let a/20 denote a prefix that is\n   conceptually\
    \ viewed as composed of 16 subnets of /24 size that are\n   denoted as a1/24,\
    \ a2/24, ..., a16/24.  For example, a/20 is mostly at\n   ETR1, while only two\
    \ of its subprefixes a8/24 and a15/24 are\n   elsewhere at ETR3 and ETR2, respectively\
    \ (see Figure 2\n   [EEMDP_Considerations]).  From the point of view of efficiency\
    \ of the\n   mapping distribution protocol, it may be beneficial for ETR1 to\n\
    \   announce a map for the entire space a/20 (rather than fragment it\n   into\
    \ a multitude of more-specific prefixes), and provide the\n   necessary exceptions\
    \ in the map information.  Thus, the map message\n   could be in the form of Map:(a/20,\
    \ ETR1; Exceptions: a8/24, a15/24).\n   In addition, ETR2 and ETR3 announce the\
    \ maps for a15/24 and a8/24,\n   respectively, and so the ILMs know where the\
    \ exception EID addresses\n   are located.  Now consider a host associated with\
    \ ITR1 initiating a\n   packet destined for an address a7(1), which is in a7/24\
    \ that is not\n   in the exception portion of a/20.  Now a question arises as\
    \ to which\n   of the following approaches would be the best choice:\n   1.  ILM-R\
    \ provides the complete mapping information for a/20 to ITR1\n       including\
    \ all maps for relevant exception subprefixes.\n   2.  ILM-R provides only the\
    \ directly relevant map to ITR1, which in\n       this case is (a/20, ETR1).\n\
    \   In the first approach, the advantage is that ITR1 would have the\n   complete\
    \ mapping for a/20 (including exception subnets), and it would\n   not have to\
    \ generate queries for subsequent first packets that are\n   destined to any address\
    \ in a/20, including a8/24 and a15/24.\n   However, the disadvantage is that if\
    \ there is a significant number of\n   exception subprefixes, then the very first\
    \ packet destined for a/20\n   will experience a long delay, and also the processors\
    \ at ITR1 and\n   ILM-R can experience overload.  In addition, the memory usage\
    \ at ITR1\n   can be very inefficient.  The advantage of the second approach above\n\
    \   is that the ILM-R does not overload resources at ITR1, neither in\n   terms\
    \ of processing or memory usage, but it needs an enhanced map\n   response in\
    \ of the form Map:(a/20, ETR1, MS=1), where the MS (More\n   Specific) indicator\
    \ is set to 1 to indicate to ITR1 that not all\n   subnets in a/20 map to ETR1.\
    \  The key idea is that aggregation is\n   beneficial, and subnet exceptions must\
    \ be handled with additional\n   messages or indicators in the maps.\n"

    \       of ETRs and Multihoming\n   Now we highlight another architectural concept\
    \ related to mapping\n   management (please refer to Figure 3 in [EEMDP_Considerations]).\n\
    \   Here we consider the possibility that ETRs may be organized in a\n   hierarchical\
    \ manner.  For instance, ETR7 is higher in the hierarchy\n   relative to ETR1,\
    \ ETR2, and ETR3, and like-wise ETR8 is higher\n   relative to ETR4, ETR5, and\
    \ ETR6.  For instance, ETRs 1 through 3 can\n   relegate the locator role to ETR7\
    \ for their EID address space.  In\n   essence, they can allow ETR7 to act as\

    \ ETRs that are\n   hierarchically associated with it in the level below.  In\

  contents:
  - "13.2.  Critique\n   The scheme described in [EEMDP_Considerations] represents\
    \ one\n   approach to mapping overhead reduction, and it is a general idea that\n\
    \   is applicable to any proposal that includes prefix or EID\n   aggregation.\
    \  A somewhat similar idea is also used in Level-3\n   aggregation in the FIB\
    \ aggregation proposal [FIBAggregatability].\n   There can be cases where deaggregation\
    \ of EID prefixes occur in such\n   a way that the bulk of an EID prefix P would\
    \ be attached to one\n   locator (say, ETR1) while a few subprefixes under P would\
    \ be attached\n   to other locators elsewhere (say, ETR2, ETR3, etc.).  Ideally,\
    \ such\n   cases should not happen; however, in reality it can happen as the\n\
    \   RIR's address allocations are imperfect.  In addition, as new IP\n   address\
    \ allocations become harder to get, an IPv4 prefix owner might\n   split previously\
    \ unused subprefixes of that prefix and allocate them\n   to remote sites (homed\
    \ to other ETRs).  Assuming these situations\n   could arise in practice, the\
    \ nature of the solution would be that the\n   response from the mapping server\
    \ for the coarser site would include\n   information about the more specifics.\
    \  The solution as presented\n   seems correct.\n   The proposal mentions that\
    \ in Approach 1, the ID-Locator Mapping\n   (ILM) system provides the complete\
    \ mapping information for an\n   aggregate EID prefix to a querying ITR, including\
    \ all the maps for\n   the relevant exception subprefixes.  The sheer number of\
    \ such more-\n   specifics can be worrisome, for example, in LISP.  What if a\n\
    \   company's mobile-node EIDs came out of their corporate EID prefix?\n   Approach\
    \ 2 is far better but still there may be too many entries for\n   a regional ILM\
    \ to store.  In Approach 2, the ILM communicates that\n   there are more specifics\
    \ but does not communicate their mask-length.\n   A suggested improvement would\
    \ be that rather than saying that there\n   are more specifics, indicate what\
    \ their mask-lengths are.  There can\n   be multiple mask lengths.  This number\
    \ should be pretty small for\n   IPv4 but can be large for IPv6.\n   Later in\
    \ the proposal, a different problem is addressed, involving a\n   hierarchy of\
    \ ETRs and how aggregation of EID prefixes from lower-\n   level ETRs can be performed\
    \ at a higher-level ETR.  The various\n   scenarios here are well illustrated\
    \ and described.  This seems like a\n   good idea, and a solution like LISP can\
    \ support this as specified.\n   As any optimization scheme would inevitably add\
    \ some complexity; the\n   proposed scheme for enhancing mapping efficiency comes\
    \ with some of\n   its own overhead.  The gain depends on the details of specific\
    \ EID\n   blocks, i.e., how frequently the situations (such as an ETR that has\n\
    \   a bigger EID block with a few holes) arise.\n"
- title: 13.3.  Rebuttal
  contents:
  - "13.3.  Rebuttal\n   There are two main points in the critique that are addressed\
    \ here:\n   (1) The gain depends on the details of specific EID blocks, i.e.,\
    \ how\n   frequently the situations arise such as an ETR having a bigger EID\n\
    \   block with a few holes, and (2) Approach 2 is lacking an added\n   feature\
    \ of conveying just the mask-length of the more specifics that\n   exist as part\
    \ of the current map response.\n   Regarding comment (1) above, there are multiple\
    \ possibilities\n   regarding how situations can arise, resulting in allocations\
    \ having\n   holes in them.  An example of one of these possibilities is as\n\
    \   follows.  Org-A has historically received multiple /20s, /22s, and\n   /24s\
    \ over the course of time that are adjacent to each other.  At the\n   present\
    \ time, these prefixes would all aggregate to a /16 but for the\n   fact that\
    \ just a few of the underlying /24s have been allocated\n   elsewhere historically\
    \ to other organizations by an RIR or ISPs.  An\n   example of a second possibility\
    \ is that Org-A has an allocation of a\n   /16.  It has suballocated a /22 to\
    \ one of its subsidiaries, and\n   subsequently sold the subsidiary to another\
    \ Org-B.  For ease of\n   keeping the /22 subnet up and running without service\
    \ disruption, the\n   /22 subprefix is allowed to be transferred in the acquisition\n\
    \   process.  Now the /22 subprefix originates from a different AS and is\n  \
    \ serviced by a different ETR (as compared to the parent \\16 prefix).\n   We\
    \ are in the process of performing an analysis of RIR allocation\n   data and\
    \ are aware of other studies (notably at UCLA) that are also\n   performing similar\
    \ analysis to quantify the frequency of occurrence\n   of the holes.  We feel\
    \ that the problem that has been addressed is a\n   realistic one, and the proposed\
    \ scheme would help reduce the\n   overheads associated with the mapping distribution\
    \ system.\n   Regarding comment (2) above, the suggested modification to Approach\
    \ 2\n   would be definitely beneficial.  In fact, we feel that it would be\n \
    \  fairly straightforward to dynamically use Approach 1 or Approach 2\n   (with\
    \ the suggested modification), depending on whether there are\n   only a few (e.g.,\
    \ <=5) or many (e.g., >5) more specifics,\n   respectively.  The suggested modification\
    \ of notifying the mask-\n   length of the more specifics in the map response\
    \ is indeed very\n   helpful because then the ITR would not have to resend a map-query\

- title: 14.1.3.  Aggregation with Increasing Scopes
  contents:
  - "14.1.3.  Aggregation with Increasing Scopes\n   Aggregating many routing entries\
    \ to a fewer number is a basic\n   approach to improving routing scalability.\
    \  Aggregation can take\n   different forms and be done within different scopes.\
    \  In our design,\n   the aggregation scope starts from a single router, then\
    \ expands to a\n   single network and neighbor networks.  The order of the following\n\
    \   steps is not fixed but is merely a suggestion; it is under each\n   individual\
    \ network's discretion which steps they choose to take based\n   on their evaluation\
    \ of the severity of the problems and the\n   affordability of the solutions.\n\
    \   1.  FIB Aggregation (FA) in a single router.  A router\n       algorithmically\
    \ aggregates its FIB entries without changing its\n       RIB or its routing announcements.\
    \  No coordination among routers\n       is needed, nor any change to existing\
    \ protocols.  This brings\n       scalability relief to individual routers with\
    \ only a software\n       upgrade.\n   2.  Enabling 'best external' on Provider\
    \ Edge routers (PEs),\n       Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs), and Route\
    \ Reflectors\n       (RRs), and turning on next-hop-self on RRs.  For hierarchical\n\
    \       networks, the RRs in each Point of Presence (PoP) can serve as a\n   \
    \    default gateway for nodes in the PoP, thus allowing the non-RR\n       nodes\
    \ in each PoP to maintain smaller routing tables that only\n       include paths\
    \ that egress that PoP.  This is known as 'topology-\n       based mode' Virtual\
    \ Aggregation, and can be done with existing\n       hardware and configuration\
    \ changes only.  Please see\n       [Evolution_Grow_Presentation] for details.\n\
    \   3.  Virtual Aggregation (VA) in a single network.  Within an AS, some\n  \
    \     fraction of existing routers are designated as Aggregation Point\n     \
    \  Routers (APRs).  These routers are either individually or\n       collectively\
    \ maintain the full FIB table.  Other routers may\n       suppress entries from\
    \ their FIBs, instead forwarding packets to\n       APRs, which will then tunnel\
    \ the packets to the correct egress\n       routers.  VA can be viewed as an intra-domain\
    \ map-and-encap\n       system to provide the operators with a control mechanism\
    \ for the\n       FIB size in their routers.\n   4.  VA across neighbor networks.\
    \  When adjacent networks have VA\n       deployed, they can go one step further\
    \ by piggybacking egress\n       router information on existing BGP announcements,\
    \ so that packets\n       can be tunneled directly to a neighbor network's egress\
    \ router.\n       This improves packet delivery performance by performing the\n\
    \       encapsulation/decapsulation only once across these neighbor\n       networks,\
    \ as well as reducing the stretch of the path.\n   5.  Reducing RIB Size by separating\
    \ the control plane from the data\n       plane.  Although a router's FIB can\
    \ be reduced by FA or VA, it\n       usually still needs to maintain the full\
    \ RIB to produce complete\n       routing announcements to its neighbors.  To\
    \ reduce the RIB size,\n       a network can set up special boxes, which we call\
    \ controllers, to\n       take over the External BGP (eBGP) sessions from border\
    \ routers.\n       The controllers receive eBGP announcements, make routing\n\
    \       decisions, and then inform other routers in the same network of\n    \
    \   how to forward packets, while the regular routers just focus on\n       the\
    \ job of forwarding packets.  The controllers, not being part\n       of the data\
    \ path, can be scaled using commodity hardware.\n   6.  Insulating forwarding\
    \ routers from routing churn.  For routers\n       with a smaller RIB, the rate\
    \ of routing churn is naturally\n       reduced.  Further reduction can be achieved\
    \ by not announcing\n       failures of customer prefixes into the core, but handling\
    \ these\n       failures in a data-driven fashion, e.g., a link failure to an\n\
    \       edge network is not reported unless and until there are data\n       packets\
    \ that are heading towards the failed link.\n"

  - "14.2.  Critique\n   All of the RRG proposals that scale the routing architecture\
    \ share\n   one fundamental approach, route aggregation, in different forms,\n\
    \   e.g., LISP removes \"edge prefixes\" using encapsulation at ITRs, and\n  \
    \ ILNP achieves the goal by locator rewrite.  In this evolutionary path\n   proposal,\
    \ each stage of the evolution applies aggregation with\n   increasing scopes to\
    \ solve a specific scalability problem, and\n   eventually the path leads towards\
    \ global routing scalability.  For\n   example, it uses FIB aggregation at the\
    \ single router level, virtual\n   aggregation at the network level, and then\
    \ between neighboring\n   networks at the inter-domain level.\n   Compared to\
    \ other proposals, this proposal has the lowest hurdle to\n   deployment, because\
    \ it does not require that all networks move to use\n   a global mapping system\
    \ or upgrade all hosts, and it is designed for\n   each individual network to\
    \ get immediate benefits after its own\n   deployment.\n   Criticisms of this\
    \ proposal fall into two types.  The first type\n   concerns several potential\
    \ issues in the technical design as listed\n   below:\n   1.  FIB aggregation,\
    \ at level-3 and level-4, may introduce extra\n       routable space.  Concerns\
    \ have been raised about the potential\n       routing loops resulting from forwarding\
    \ otherwise non-routable\n       packets, and the potential impact on Reverse\
    \ Path Forwarding\n       (RPF) checking.  These concerns can be addressed by\
    \ choosing a\n       lower level of aggregation and by adding null routes to minimize\n\
    \       the extra space, at the cost of reduced aggregation gain.\n   2.  Virtual\
    \ Aggregation changes the traffic paths in an ISP network,\n       thereby introducing\
    \ stretch.  Changing the traffic path may also\n       impact the reverse path\
    \ checking practice used to filter out\n       packets from spoofed sources. \
    \ More analysis is need to identify\n       the potential side-effects of VA and\
    \ to address these issues.\n   3.  The current Virtual Aggregation description\
    \ is difficult to\n       understand, due to its multiple options for encapsulation\
    \ and\n       popular prefix configurations, which makes the mechanism look\n\
    \       overly complicated.  More thought is needed to simplify the\n       design\
    \ and description.\n   4.  FIB Aggregation and Virtual Aggregation may require\
    \ additional\n       operational cost.  There may be new design trade-offs that\
    \ the\n       operators need to understand in order to select the best option\n\
    \       for their networks.  More analysis is needed to identify and\n       quantify\
    \ all potential operational costs.\n   5.  In contrast to a number of other proposals,\
    \ this solution does\n       not provide mobility support.  It remains an open\
    \ question as to\n       whether the routing system should handle mobility.\n\
    \   The second criticism is whether deploying quick fixes like FIB\n   aggregation\
    \ would alleviate scalability problems in the short term\n   and reduce the incentives\
    \ for deploying a new architecture; and\n   whether an evolutionary approach would\
    \ end up with adding more and\n   more patches to the old architecture, and not\
    \ lead to a fundamentally\n   new architecture as the proposal had expected. \
    \ Though this solution\n   may get rolled out more easily and quickly, a new architecture,\
    \ if/\n   once deployed, could solve more problems with cleaner solutions.\n"

  - "15.1.  Summary\n   Name-based sockets are an evolution of the existing address-based\n\
    \   sockets, enabling applications to initiate and receive communication\n   sessions\
    \ based on the use of domain names in lieu of IP addresses.\n   Name-based sockets\
    \ move the existing indirection from domain names to\n   IP addresses from its\
    \ current position in applications down to the IP\n   layer.  As a result, applications\
    \ communicate exclusively based on\n   domain names, while the discovery, selection,\
    \ and potentially in-\n   session re-selection of IP addresses is centrally performed\
    \ by the IP\n   stack itself.\n   Name-based sockets help mitigate the Internet\
    \ routing scalability\n   problem by separating naming and addressing more consistently\
    \ than\n   what is possible with the existing address-based sockets.  This\n \
    \  supports IP address aggregation because it simplifies the use of IP\n   addresses\
    \ with high topological significance, as well as the dynamic\n   replacement of\
    \ IP addresses during network-topological and host-\n   attachment changes.\n\
    \   A particularly positive effect of name-based sockets on Internet\n   routing\
    \ scalability is the new incentives for edge network operators\n   to use provider-assigned\
    \ IP addresses, which are more aggregatable\n   than the typically preferred provider-independent\
    \ IP addresses.  Even\n   though provider-independent IP addresses are harder\
    \ to get and more\n   expensive than provider-assigned IP addresses, many operators\
    \ desire\n   provider-independent addresses due to the high indirect cost of\n\
    \   provider-assigned IP addresses.  This indirect cost is comprised of\n   both\
    \ difficulties in multihoming, and tedious and largely manual\n   renumbering\
    \ upon provider changes.\n   Name-based sockets reduce the indirect cost of provider-assigned\
    \ IP\n   addresses in three ways, and hence make the use of provider-assigned\n\
    \   IP addresses more acceptable: (1) They enable fine-grained and\n   responsive\
    \ multihoming. (2) They simplify renumbering by offering an\n   easy means to\
    \ replace IP addresses in referrals with domain names.\n   This helps avoiding\
    \ updates to application and operating system\n   configurations, scripts, and\
    \ databases during renumbering. (3) They\n   facilitate low-cost solutions that\
    \ eliminate renumbering altogether.\n   One such low-cost solution is IP address\
    \ translation, which in\n   combination with name-based sockets loses its adverse\
    \ impact on\n   applications.\n   The prerequisite for a positive effect of name-based\
    \ sockets on\n   Internet routing scalability is their adoption in operating systems\n\
    \   and applications.  Operating systems should be augmented to offer\n   name-based\
    \ sockets as a new alternative to the existing address-based\n   sockets, and\
    \ applications should use name-based sockets for their\n   communications.  Neither\
    \ an instantaneous, nor an eventually complete\n   transition to name-based sockets\
    \ is required, yet the positive effect\n   on Internet routing scalability will\
    \ grow with the extent of this\n   transition.\n   Name-based sockets were hence\
    \ designed with a focus on deployment\n   incentives, comprising both immediate\
    \ deployment benefits as well as\n   low deployment costs.  Name-based sockets\
    \ provide a benefit to\n   application developers because the alleviation of applications\
    \ from\n   IP address management responsibilities simplifies and expedites\n \
    \  application development.  This benefit is immediate owing to the\n   backwards\
    \ compatibility of name-based sockets with legacy\n   applications and legacy\
    \ peers.  The appeal to application developers,\n   in turn, is an immediate benefit\
    \ for operating system vendors who\n   adopt name-based sockets.\n   Name-based\
    \ sockets furthermore minimize deployment costs: Alternative\n   techniques to\
    \ separate naming and addressing provide applications\n   with \"surrogate IP\
    \ addresses\" that dynamically map onto regular IP\n   addresses.  A surrogate\
    \ IP address is indistinguishable from a\n   regular IP address for applications,\
    \ but does not have the\n   topological significance of a regular IP address.\
    \  Mobile IP and the\n   Host Identity Protocol are examples of such separation\
    \ techniques.\n   Mobile IP uses \"home IP addresses\" as surrogate IP addresses\
    \ with\n   reduced topological significance.  The Host Identity Protocol uses\n\
    \   \"host identifiers\" as surrogate IP addresses without topological\n   significance.\
    \  A disadvantage of surrogate IP addresses is their\n   incurred cost in terms\
    \ of extra administrative overhead and, for some\n   techniques, extra infrastructure.\
    \  Since surrogate IP addresses must\n   be resolvable to the corresponding regular\
    \ IP addresses, they must be\n   provisioned in the DNS or similar infrastructure.\
    \  Mobile IP uses a\n   new infrastructure of home agents for this purpose, while\
    \ the Host\n   Identity Protocol populates DNS servers with host identities. \
    \ Name-\n   based sockets avoid this cost because they function without surrogate\n\
    \   IP addresses, and hence without the provisioning and infrastructure\n   requirements\
    \ that accompany surrogate addresses.\n   Certainly, some edge networks will continue\
    \ to use provider-\n   independent addresses despite name-based sockets, perhaps\
    \ simply due\n   to inertia.  But name-based sockets will help reduce the number\
    \ of\n   those networks, and thus have a positive impact on Internet routing\n\
    \   scalability.\n   A more comprehensive description of name-based sockets can\
    \ be found\n   in [Name_Based_Sockets].\n"

    \ carry one protocol over the other.\n   However, despite [IRON] being readied\
    \ for publication as an\n   experimental RFC, the framework falls well short of\
    \ the level of\n   detail required to envisage how it could be used to implement\
    \ a\n   practical scalable routing solution.  For instance, the document\n   contains\
    \ no specification for a mapping protocol, or how the mapping\n   lookup system\
    \ would work on a global scale.\n   There is no provision for RANGER's ITR-like\
    \ routers being able to\n   probe the reachability of end-user networks via multiple\
    \ ETR-like\n   routers -- nor for any other approach to multihoming service\n\
    \   restoration.\n   Nor is there any provision for inbound TE or support of mobile\n\
    \   devices which frequently change their point of attachment.\n   Therefore,\
    \ in its current form, RANGER cannot be contemplated as a\n   superior scalable\
    \ routing solution to some other proposals which are\n   specified in sufficient\
    \ detail and which appear to be feasible.\n   RANGER uses its own tunneling and\
    \ PMTUD management protocol: SEAL.\n   Adoption of SEAL in its current form would\
    \ prevent the proper\n   utilization of jumbo frame paths in the DFZ, which will\
    \ become the\n   norm in the future.  SEAL uses \"Packet Too Big\" [RFC4443] and\n\
    \   \"Fragmentation Needed\" [RFC0792] messages to the sending host only to\n\
    \   fix a preset maximum packet length.  To avoid the need for the SEAL\n   layer\
    \ to fragment packets of this length, this MTU value (for the\n   input of the\
    \ tunnel) needs to be set significantly below 1500 bytes,\n   assuming the typically\
    \ ~1500 byte MTU values for paths across the DFZ\n   today.  In order to avoid\
    \ this excessive fragmentation, this value\n   could only be raised to a ~9k byte\
    \ value at some time in the future\n   where essentially all paths between ITRs\
    \ and ETRs were jumbo frame\n   capable.\n"

  - "16.3.  Rebuttal\n   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) [IRON] is a scalable\n\
    \   Internet routing architecture that builds on the RANGER recursive\n   enterprise\
    \ network hierarchy [RFC5720].  IRON bonds together\n   participating RANGER networks\
    \ using VET [VET] and SEAL [SEAL] to\n   enable secure and scalable routing through\
    \ automatic tunneling within\n   the Internet core.  The IRON-RANGER automatic\
    \ tunneling abstraction\n   views the entire global Internet DFZ as a virtual\
    \ Non-Broadcast\n   Multi-Access (NBMA) link similar to ISATAP [RFC5214].\n  \
    \ IRON-RANGER is an example of a Core-Edge Separation (CES) system.\n   Instead\
    \ of a classical mapping database, however, IRON-RANGER uses a\n   hybrid combination\
    \ of a proactive dynamic routing protocol for\n   distributing highly aggregated\
    \ Virtual Prefixes (VPs) and an on-\n   demand data driven protocol for distributing\
    \ more-specific Provider-\n   Independent (PI) prefixes derived from the VPs.\n\
    \   The IRON-RANGER hierarchy consists of recursively-nested RANGER\n   enterprise\
    \ networks joined together by IRON routers that participate\n   in a global BGP\
    \ instance.  The IRON BGP instance is maintained\n   separately from the current\
    \ Internet BGP Routing LOCator (RLOC)\n   address space (i.e., the set of all\
    \ public IPv4 prefixes in the\n   Internet).  Instead, the IRON BGP instance maintains\
    \ VPs taken from\n   Endpoint Interface iDentifier (EID) address space, e.g.,\
    \ the IPv6\n   global unicast address space.  To accommodate scaling, only O(10k)\
    \ --\n   O(100k) VPs are allocated e.g., using /20 or shorter IPv6 prefixes.\n\
    \   IRON routers lease portions of their VPs as Provider-Independent (PI)\n  \
    \ prefixes for customer equipment (CEs), thereby creating a sustainable\n   business\
    \ model.  CEs that lease PI prefixes propagate address\n   mapping(s) throughout\
    \ their attached RANGER networks and up to VP-\n   owning IRON router(s) through\
    \ periodic transmission of \"bubbles\" with\n   authentication and PI prefix information.\
    \  Routers in RANGER networks\n   and IRON routers that receive and forward the\
    \ bubbles securely\n   install PI prefixes in their FIBs, but do not inject them\
    \ into the\n   RIB.  IRON routers therefore keep track of only their customer\
    \ base\n   via the FIB entries and keep track of only the Internet-wide VP\n \
    \  database in the RIB.\n   IRON routers propagate more-specific prefixes using\
    \ secure\n   redirection to update router FIBs.  Prefix redirection is driven\
    \ by\n   the data plane and does not affect the control plane.  Redirected\n \
    \  prefixes are not injected into the RIB, but rather are maintained as\n   FIB\
    \ soft state that is purged after expiration or route failure.\n   Neighbor unreachability\
    \ detection is used to detect failure.\n   Secure prefix registrations and redirections\
    \ are accommodated through\n   the mechanisms of SEAL.  Tunnel endpoints using\
    \ SEAL synchronize\n   sequence numbers, and can therefore discard any packets\
    \ they receive\n   that are outside of the current sequence number window.  Hence,\
    \ off-\n   path attacks are defeated.  These synchronized tunnel endpoints can\n\
    \   therefore exchange prefixes with signed certificates that prove\n   prefix\
    \ ownership in such a way that DoS vectors that attack crypto\n   calculation\
    \ overhead are eliminated due to the prevention of off-path\n   attacks.\n   CEs\
    \ can move from old RANGER networks and re-inject their PI prefixes\n   into new\
    \ RANGER networks.  This would be accommodated by IRON-RANGER\n   as a site multihoming\
    \ event while host mobility and true locator-ID\n   separation is accommodated\
    \ via HIP [RFC5201].\n"
- title: 17.  Recommendation
  contents:
  - "17.  Recommendation\n   As can be seen from the extensive list of proposals above,\
    \ the group\n   explored a number of possible solutions.  Unfortunately, the group\n\
    \   did not reach rough consensus on a single best approach.\n   Accordingly,\
    \ the recommendation has been left to the co-chairs.  The\n   remainder of this\
    \ section describes the rationale and decision of the\n   co-chairs.\n   As a\
    \ reminder, the goal of the research group was to develop a\n   recommendation\
    \ for an approach to a routing and addressing\n   architecture for the Internet.\
    \  The primary goal of the architecture\n   is to provide improved scalability\
    \ for the routing subsystem.\n   Specifically, this implies that we should be\
    \ able to continue to grow\n   the routing subsystem to meet the needs of the\
    \ Internet without\n   requiring drastic and continuous increases in the amount\
    \ of state or\n   processing requirements for routers.\n"
- title: 17.1.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "17.1.  Motivation\n   There is a general concern that the cost and structure\
    \ of the routing\n   and addressing architecture as we know it today may become\n\
    \   prohibitively expensive with continued growth, with repercussions to\n   the\
    \ health of the Internet.  As such, there is an urgent need to\n   examine and\
    \ evaluate potential scalability enhancements.\n   For the long term future of\
    \ the Internet, it has become apparent that\n   IPv6 is going to play a significant\
    \ role.  It has taken more than a\n   decade, but IPv6 is starting to see some\
    \ non-trivial amount of\n   deployment.  This is in part due to the depletion\
    \ of IPv4 addresses.\n   It therefore seems apparent that the new architecture\
    \ must be\n   applicable to IPv6.  It may or may not be applicable to IPv4, but\
    \ not\n   addressing the IPv6 portion of the network would simply lead to\n  \
    \ recreating the routing scalability problem in the IPv6 domain,\n   because the\
    \ two share a common routing architecture.\n   Whatever change we make, we should\
    \ expect that this is a very long-\n   lived change.  The routing architecture\
    \ of the entire Internet is a\n   loosely coordinated, complex, expensive subsystem,\
    \ and permanent,\n   pervasive changes to it will require difficult choices during\n\
    \   deployment and integration.  These cannot be undertaken lightly.\n   By extension,\
    \ if we are going to the trouble, pain, and expense of\n   making major architectural\
    \ changes, it follows that we want to make\n   the best changes possible.  We\
    \ should regard any such changes as\n   permanent and we should therefore aim\
    \ for long term solutions that\n   place the network in the best possible position\
    \ for ongoing growth.\n   These changes should be cleanly integrated, first-class\
    \ citizens\n   within the architecture.  That is to say that any new elements\
    \ that\n   are integrated into the architecture should be fundamental\n   primitives,\
    \ on par with the other existing legacy primitives in the\n   architecture, that\
    \ interact naturally and logically when in\n   combination with other elements\
    \ of the architecture.\n   Over the history of the Internet, we have been very\
    \ good about\n   creating temporary, ad-hoc changes, both to the routing architecture\n\
    \   and other aspects of the network layer.  However, many of these band-\n  \
    \ aid solutions have come with a significant overhead in terms of long-\n   term\
    \ maintenance and architectural complexity.  This is to be avoided\n   and short-term\
    \ improvements should eventually be replaced by long-\n   term, permanent solutions.\n\
    \   In the particular instance of the routing and addressing architecture\n  \
    \ today, we feel that the situation requires that we pursue both short-\n   term\
    \ improvements and long-term solutions.  These are not\n   incompatible because\
    \ we truly intend for the short-term improvements\n   to be completely localized\
    \ and temporary.  The short-term\n   improvements are necessary to give us the\
    \ time necessary to develop,\n   test, and deploy the long-term solution.  As\
    \ the long-term solution\n   is rolled out and gains traction, the short-term\
    \ improvements should\n   be of less benefit and can subsequently be withdrawn.\n"
- title: 17.2.  Recommendation to the IETF
  contents:
  - "17.2.  Recommendation to the IETF\n   The group explored a number of proposed\
    \ solutions but did not reach\n   consensus on a single best approach.  Therefore,\
    \ in fulfillment of\n   the routing research group's charter, the co-chairs recommend\
    \ that\n   the IETF pursue work in the following areas:\n      Evolution [Evolution]\n\
    \      Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) [ILNP_Site]\n      Renumbering\
    \ [RFC5887]\n"
- title: 17.3.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "17.3.  Rationale\n   We selected Evolution because it is a short-term improvement.\
    \  It can\n   be applied on a per-domain basis, under local administration and\
    \ has\n   immediate effect.  While there is some complexity involved, we feel\n\
    \   that this option is constructive for service providers who find the\n   additional\
    \ complexity to be less painful than upgrading hardware.\n   This improvement\
    \ can be deployed by domains that feel it necessary,\n   for as long as they feel\
    \ it is necessary.  If this deployment lasts\n   longer than expected, then the\
    \ implications of that decision are\n   wholly local to the domain.\n   We recommended\
    \ ILNP because we find it to be a clean solution for the\n   architecture.  It\
    \ separates location from identity in a clear,\n   straightforward way that is\
    \ consistent with the remainder of the\n   Internet architecture and makes both\
    \ first-class citizens.  Unlike\n   the many map-and-encap proposals, there are\
    \ no complications due to\n   tunneling, indirection, or semantics that shift\
    \ over the lifetime of\n   a packet's delivery.\n   We recommend further work\
    \ on automating renumbering because even with\n   ILNP, the ability of a domain\
    \ to change its locators at minimal cost\n   is fundamentally necessary.  No routing\
    \ architecture will be able to\n   scale without some form of abstraction, and\
    \ domains that change their\n   point of attachment must fundamentally be prepared\
    \ to change their\n   locators in line with this abstraction.  We recognize that\
    \ [RFC5887]\n   is not a solution so much as a problem statement, and we are simply\n\
    \   recommending that the IETF create effective and convenient mechanisms\n  \
    \ for site renumbering.\n"
