  - "1.  Introduction\n   PMIPv6 QoS [1] describes an access-network-independent way\
    \ to\n   negotiate Quality of Service (QoS) for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)\n \
    \  mobility sessions.  IEEE 802.11, Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM), and Wi-Fi\n   Multimedia\
    \ - Admission Control (WMM-AC) describe ways to provide QoS\n   for Wi-Fi traffic\
    \ between the Wi-Fi Station (STA) and Access Point\n   (AP).  This document describes\
    \ how QoS can be implemented in a\n   network where the access network is based\
    \ on IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi).  It\n   requires a mapping between QoS procedures and\
    \ information elements in\n   two segments: 1) the Wi-Fi segment and 2) the PMIPv6\
    \ segment.  (See\n   Figure 1.)  The recommendations here allow for dynamic QoS\
    \ policy\n   information per Mobile Node (MN) and session to be configured by\
    \ the\n   IEEE 802.11 access network.  PMIPv6 QoS signaling between the Mobile\n\
    \   Access Gateway (MAG) and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) provisions the\n   per-MN\
    \ QoS policies in the MAG.  Further details on policy\n   configuration and the\
    \ Policy Control Function (PCF) can be found in\n   [1], Section 6.1.  In the\
    \ IEEE 802.11 access network modeled here,\n   the MAG is located at the AP /\
    \ Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).\n   Figure 1 below provides an overview of the\

    \ 1: End-to-End QoS in Networks with IEEE 802.11 Access\n   The MN and Access\
    \ Point (AP) use IEEE 802.11 QoS mechanisms to set up\n   QoS flows in the Wi-Fi\
    \ segment.  The MAG and LMA set up QoS flows\n   using PMIPv6 QoS procedures.\
    \  The protocols and mechanisms between\n   the AP and MAG are outside the scope\
    \ of this document.  Some\n   implementations may have the AP and MAG in the same\
    \ network node.\n   However, this document does not exclude various deployments\
    \ including\n   those in which the AP and WLC are separate nodes or in which the\
    \ MAG\n   control and data planes are separate.\n   The recommendations in this\
    \ document use IEEE 802.11 QoS and PMIPv6\n   QoS mechanisms [1].  State machines\
    \ for QoS policy setup in IEEE\n   802.11 and PMIPv6 operate differently.  Guidelines\
    \ for installing QoS\n   in the MN using IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6 segments and for\
    \ mapping\n   parameters between them are outlined below.\n   - Procedure Mapping:\n\
    \       PMIPv6-defined procedures for QoS setup, as specified in [1], may\n  \
    \     be triggered by the LMA or MAG.  IEEE 802.11 QoS setup, on the\n       other\
    \ hand, is always triggered by the MN (IEEE 802.11 QoS\n       Station (QSTA)).\
    \  The end-to-end QoS setup across these network\n       segments should accommodate\
    \ QoS that is triggered by the network\n       or by the end user.\n   - Parameter\
    \ Mapping:\n       There is no systematic method of mapping of specific parameters\n\
    \       between PMIPv6 QoS parameters and IEEE 802.11 QoS.  For example,\n   \
    \    parameters like Allocation and Retention Priority (AARP) in\n       PMIPv6\
    \ QoS have no equivalent in IEEE 802.11.\n   The primary emphasis of this specification\
    \ is to handle the\n   interworking between WMM-AC signaling/procedures and PMIPv6\
    \ QoS\n   signaling/procedures.  When the client does not support WMM-AC, then\n\
    \   the AP/MAG uses the connection mapping in Table 2 and DSCP-to-AC\n   mapping\
    \ as shown in Table 3.\n   The rest of the document is organized as follows. \
    \ Section 2 provides\n   an overview of IEEE 802.11 QoS.  Section 3 describes\
    \ a mapping of QoS\n   signaling procedures between IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6.  The\
    \ mapping of\n   parameters between IEEE 802.11 and PMIPv6 QoS is described in\n\
    \   Section 4.\n"

  - "2.  Overview of IEEE 802.11 QoS\n   IEEE 802.11 defines a way of providing prioritized\
    \ access for\n   different traffic classes (video, voice, etc.) by a mechanism\
    \ called\n   EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access).  The levels of priority\n\
    \   in EDCA are called access categories (ACs) and there are four levels\n   (in\
    \ decreasing order of priority): Voice, Video, Best-Effort, and\n   Background.\
    \  Prioritized access is achieved by using AC-specific\n   values for Contention\
    \ Window (CW) and Arbitration Inter-Frame Space\n   (AIFS).  (Higher-priority\
    \ categories have smaller values for minimum\n   and maximum CW and AIFS.)\n \
    \  A subset of the QoS mechanisms is defined in WMM -- a Wi-Fi Alliance\n   certification\
    \ of support for a set of features from an IEEE 802.11e\n   draft (now part of\
    \ IEEE 802.11).  This certification is for both\n   clients and APs and certifies\
    \ the operation of WMM.  WMM is primarily\n   the implementation of the EDCA component\
    \ of IEEE 802.11e.  WMM uses\n   the IEEE 802.1P classification scheme developed\
    \ by the IEEE (which is\n   now a part of the 802.1D specification).  The IEEE\
    \ 802.1P\n   classification scheme has eight priorities, which WMM maps to four\n\
    \   access categories: AC_BK, AC_BE, AC_VI, and AC_VO.  The lack of\n   support\
    \ in WMM for the TCLAS (used in identifying an IP flow) has an\n   impact on the\
    \ QoS provisioning.  The impact on WMM-based QoS\n   provisioning is described\
    \ in Sections 3 and 4.\n   IEEE 802.11 defines the way a (non-AP) STA can request\
    \ QoS to be\n   reserved for an access category.  Correspondingly, the AP can\n\
    \   determine whether to admit or deny the request depending on the\n   available\
    \ resources.  Further, the AP may require that Admission\n   Control is mandatory\
    \ for an access category.  In such a case, the STA\n   is expected to use the\
    \ access category only after being successfully\n   admitted.  WMM-AC is a Wi-Fi\
    \ Alliance certification of support for\n   Admission Control based on a set of\
    \ features in IEEE 802.11.\n   The QoS signaling in IEEE 802.11 is initiated by\
    \ the (non-AP) STA (by\n   sending an ADDTS request).  This specification references\
    \ procedures\n   in IEEE 802.11, WMM, and WMM-AC.\n"

    \ is established\n       to the LMA.  This allows the MN to start application-level\n\
    \       signaling.\n   (1) The trigger for the MN to request QoS is an upper-layer\n\
    \       notification.  This may be the result of end-to-end application\n    \
    \   signaling and setup procedures (e.g., SIP [10]).\n       Since the MN is configured\
    \ to start QoS signaling, it sends an\n       ADDTS request with TSPEC and TCLAS\
    \ identifying the flow for which\n       QoS is requested.\n       It should be\
    \ noted that WMM-AC specifications do not contain\n       TCLAS.  When TCLAS is\
    \ not present, there is no direct way to\n       derive flow-specific attributes\
    \ like Traffic Selector in PMIPv6.\n       In this case, functionality to derive\
    \ IP flow details from\n       information in upper-layer protocols (e.g., SIP\
    \ [10]) and\n       associate them with a subsequent QoS request may be used.\
    \  This\n       is not described further here, but it may be functionality in\
    \ an\n       Application Layer Gateway (ALG) or Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).\n\
    \       It should be noted that an ALG or DPI can increase the complexity\n  \
    \     of the AP/MAG implementation and affect its scalability.  If no\n      \
    \ TCLAS is derived, the reservation applies to all flows of the MN.\n       Parameter\
    \ mapping in this case is shown in Table 2.\n   (2) If there are sufficient resources\
    \ at the AP/WLC to satisfy the\n       request, the MAG sends a PBU with QoS options,\
    \ Operational Code\n       ALLOCATE, and the Traffic Selector identifying the\
    \ flow.  The\n       Traffic Selector is derived from the TCLAS to identify the\
    \ flow\n       requesting QoS.  IEEE 802.11 QoS parameters in TSPEC are mapped\n\
    \       to PMIPv6 parameters.  The mapping of TCLAS to PMIPv6 is shown in\n  \
    \     Table 1.  TSPEC parameter mapping is shown in Table 4.\n       If TCLAS\
    \ is not present (when WMM-AC is used), TCLAS may be\n       derived from information\
    \ in upper-layer protocols (as described\n       in step 1) and populated in the\
    \ Traffic Selector.  If TCLAS\n       cannot be derived, the Traffic Selector\
    \ field is not included in\n       the QoS options.\n   (3) The LMA obtains the\
    \ authorized QoS for the flow and responds to\n       the MAG with Operational\
    \ Code set to RESPONSE.  Mapping of PMIPv6\n       to IEEE 802.11 TCLAS is shown\
    \ in Table 1, and mapping of TSPEC\n       parameters is shown in Table 4.\n \
    \      Reserved bandwidth for flows is calculated separately from the\n      \
    \ non-reserved session bandwidth.  The Traffic Selector identifies\n       the\
    \ flow for which the QoS reservations are made.\n       If the LMA offers downgraded\
    \ QoS values to the MAG, it should\n       send a PBU to the LMA with Operational\
    \ Code set to DE-ALLOCATE.\n       (The LMA would respond with PBA to confirm\
    \ completion of the\n       request.)\n   (4) The AP/MAG provisions the corresponding\
    \ QoS and replies with\n       ADDTS Response containing authorized QoS in TSPEC,\
    \ the flow\n       identification in TSPEC, and ResultCode set to SUCCESS.\n \
    \      The AP polices these flows according to the QoS provisioning.\n       In\
    \ step 3, if the LMA sends a downgraded QoS or a PBA message\n       with status\
    \ code CANNOT_MEET_QOS_SERVICE_REQUEST (179), then the\n       AP should respond\
    \ to the MN with ADDTS Response and ResultCode\n       set as follows:\n     \
    \  -  for downgraded QoS from LMA, ResultCode is set to\n          REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES.\
    \  Downgraded QoS values from\n          LMA are mapped to TSPEC as per Table\
    \ 4.  This is still a\n          rejection, but the MN may revise the QoS to a\
    \ lower level and\n          repeat this sequence if the application can adapt.\n\
    \       -  if LMA cannot meet the QoS service request, ResultCode is set\n   \
    \       to TCLAS_RESOURCES_EXHAUSTED.\n       Either REJECTED_WITH_SUGGESTED_CHANGES\
    \ or\n       TCLAS_RESOURCES_EXHAUSTED results in the rejection of the QoS\n \
    \      reservation, but it does not cause the removal of the session\n       itself.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  LMA-Initiated QoS Reservation Request\n   This section describes the\
    \ case when the QoS service request is\n   initiated by the LMA.  For example,\
    \ an application such as voice may\n   request the network to initiate configuration\
    \ of additional QoS\n   policy as in [8], Section 7.4.2.  In the current WLAN\
    \ specifications,\n   there is no standard-defined way for the AP to initiate\
    \ a QoS service\n   request to the MN.  As a result, when the MAG receives a QoS\
    \ request\n   from the LMA, it does not have any standard mechanisms to initiate\n\
    \   any QoS requests to the MN over the access network.  Given this, the\n   PMIPv6\
    \ QoS service requests and any potential WLAN service requests\n   (such as described\
    \ in Section 3.1) are handled asynchronously.\n   The PMIPv6 QoS service requests\
    \ and WLAN QoS service request could\n   still be coordinated to provide an end-to-end\
    \ QoS.  If the MAG\n   receives an Update Notification (UPN) request from the\
    \ LMA to reserve\n   QoS resources for which it has no corresponding QoS request\
    \ from the\n   MN, the MAG may, in consultation with the AP, provision a policy\
    \ that\n   can grant a subsequent QoS request from the MN.  If the MN initiates\n\
    \   QoS procedures after the completion of PMIPv6 QoS procedures, the AP/\n  \
    \ MAG can ensure consistency between the QoS resources in the access\n   network\
    \ and QoS resources between the MAG and LMA.\n   For example, if the MN is requesting\
    \ a mean data rate of x Mbps, the\n   AP and MAG can ensure that the rate can\
    \ be supported on the network\n   between MAG and LMA based on previous PMIPv6\
    \ QoS procedures.  If the\n   MN subsequently requests data rates of x Mbps or\
    \ less, the AP can\n   accept a request based on the earlier PMIPv6 QoS provisioning.\
    \  For\n   the case where there is a mismatch, i.e., the network does not\n  \
    \ support the x Mbps, then either the MAG should renegotiate the QoS\n   resource\
    \ and ask for increased QoS resources or the AP should reject\n   the QoS request.\n"

  - "3.2.2.  Discussion on QoS Request Handling with IEEE 802.11aa\n   The network-initiated\
    \ QoS service request scenario poses some\n   challenges outlined here.  IEEE\
    \ 802.11 does not provide any\n   mechanisms for the AP to initiate a QoS request.\
    \  As a result, the\n   AP/MAG cannot explicitly make any reservations in response\
    \ to a QoS\n   reservation request made using UPN.  IEEE 802.11aa [5] (which is\
    \ an\n   amendment to IEEE 802.11) has a mechanism that enables the AP to ask\n\
    \   the client to reserve QoS for a traffic stream.  It does this via the\n  \
    \ ADDTS Reserve Request.  The ADDTS Reserve Request contains a TSPEC,\n   an optional\
    \ TCLAS, and a mandatory stream identifier.  The\n   specification does not describe\
    \ how the AP would obtain such a stream\n   identifier.  As a result, there needs\
    \ to be a new higher-layer\n   protocol defined that is understood by the MN and\
    \ AP and that\n   provides a common stream identifier to both ends.  Alternately,\
    \ the\n   IEEE 802.11aa specification could be modified to make the usage\n  \

    \ specification [9] recommends using IPsec and IKEv2 to secure\n   protocol messages.\
    \  The security of the node(s) that implement the\n   QoS mapping functionality\
    \ should be considered in actual deployments.\n   The QoS mappings themselves\
    \ do not introduce additional security\n   concerns.\n"

    \ the QoS reservation in\n   the Wi-Fi segment.\n   (0) The MN sets up a best-effort\
    \ session.  This allows the MN to\n       perform application-level signaling\
    \ and setup.\n   (1) The policy server sends a QoS reservation request to the\
    \ LMA.\n       This is usually sent in response to an application that requests\n\
    \       the policy server for higher QoS for some of its flows.\n       The LMA\
    \ reserves resources for the flow requested.\n   (2) The LMA sends a PMIPv6 UPN\
    \ (Update Notification) [2], as outlined\n       in Section 3.2.1, to the MAG\
    \ with Notification Reason set to\n       QOS_SERVICE_REQUEST and Acknowledgement\
    \ Requested flag set to 1.\n       The Operational Code in the QoS option is set\
    \ to ALLOCATE, and\n       the Traffic Selector identifies the flow for QoS.\n\
    \       The LMA QoS parameters include Guaranteed-DL-Bit-Rate/Guaranteed-\n  \

    \ in IEEE 802.11aa should be\n       encoded as discussed in Section 3.2.2.\n\
    \   (4) MN accepts the QoS reserved in the network and replies with ADDTS\n  \
    \     Reserve Response.\n   (5) The MAG (AP/WLC) replies with a UPA confirming\
    \ the acceptance of\n       QoS options and Operational Code set to RESPONSE.\
    \  The AP/WLC\n       polices flows based on the new QoS.\n       If there are\
    \ insufficient resources at the AP in step 3, the MAG\n       sends a response\
