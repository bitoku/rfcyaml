    of ATM\n   services to a PSN without having to provision the ATM subscriber or\n
    \  customer edge (CE) devices.  The ATM CEs will view the ATM\n   transparent
    cell transport service as if they were directly connected\n   via a Time Division
    Multiplexer (TDM) leased line.  This service is\n   most likely to be used as
    an internal function in an ATM service\n   provider's network as a way to connect
    existing ATM switches via a\n   higher-speed PSN, or to provide ATM \"backhaul\"
    services for remote\n   access to existing ATM networks.\n"

  - "2.  Transparent Cell Transport Definition\n   The transparent port service is
    a natural application of the \"N-to-\n   one\" Virtual Circuit Connection (VCC)
    cell transport mode for PWE3\n   ATM encapsulation described in [2], and MUST
    be used with pseudowires\n   of type 0x0003, \"ATM transparent cell transport\"
    [4].\n   The ATM transparent port service emulates connectivity between two\n
    \  remote ATM ports.  This service is useful when one desires to connect\n   two
    CEs without processing or switching at the Virtual Path\n   Connection (VPC) or
    VCC layer.  The ingress PE discards any\n   idle/unassigned cells received from
    the ingress ATM port, and maps\n   all other received cells to a single pseudowire.\n
    \  The egress PE does not change the Virtual Path Identifier (VPI),\n   Virtual
    Circuit Identifier (VCI), Payload Type Identifier (PTI), or\n   Cell Loss Priority
    (CLP) bits when it sends these cells on the egress\n   ATM port.  Therefore, the
    transparent port service appears to emulate\n   an ATM transmission convergence
    layer connection between two ports.\n   However, since the ingress PE discards
    idle/unassigned cells, this\n   service benefits from statistical multiplexing
    bandwidth savings.\n   In accordance with [2], cell concatenation MAY be used
    for\n   transparent cell-relay transport in order to save the PSN bandwidth.\n
    \  If used, it MUST be agreed between the ingress and egress PEs.  In\n   particular,
    if the Pseudo Wire has been set up using the PWE3 control\n   protocol [3], the
    ingress PE MUST NOT exceed the value of the\n   \"Maximum Number of concatenated
    ATM cells\" Pseudowire Interface\n   Parameter Sub-TLV (Interface Parameter ID
    = 0x02 [4]) received in the\n   Label Mapping message for the Pseudo Wire, and
    MUST NOT use cell\n   concatenation if this parameter has been omitted by the
    egress PE.\n   ATM Operations and Management (OAM) cells MUST be transported\n
    \  transparently, and the PEs do not act on them.  If the PEs detect a\n   PSN
    or pseudowire failure between them, they do not generate any OAM\n   cells, but
    rather bring down the ATM interfaces to the CEs (e.g.,\n   generating LOS on the
    ATM port), just as if it were a transmission\n   layer failure.\n   Similarly,
    ATM Integrated Local Management Interface (ILMI) signaling\n   from the CEs, if
    any, MUST be transported transparently, and the PEs\n   do not act on it.  However,
    the PEs must act on physical interface\n   failure by either withdrawing the PW
    labels or by using pseudowire\n   status signaling to indicate the interface failure.
    \ The procedures\n   for both alternatives are described in [3].\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce any new security
    considerations\n   beyond those in [2] and [3].  This document defines an application\n
    \  that utilizes the encapsulation specified in [2], and does not\n   specify
    the protocols used to carry the encapsulated packets across\n   the PSN.  Each
    such protocol may have its own set of security issues,\n   but those issues are
    not affected by the application specified\n   herein.  Note that the security
    of the transported ATM service will\n   only be as good as the security of the
    PSN.  This level of security\n   might be less rigorous than a native ATM service.\n"

  - "4.  Congestion Control\n   Since this document discusses an application of the
    \"N-to-one\" VCC\n   cell transport mode for PWE3 ATM encapsulation described
    in [2], the\n   congestion control considerations are identical to those discussed
    in\n   section 15 of [2].  The PWE3 Working Group is also undertaking\n   additional
    work on ATM-related congestion issues, and implementers\n   should anticipate
    that an RFC will be published describing additional\n   congestion control techniques
    that should be applied to ATM emulation\n   over pseudowires.\n"
