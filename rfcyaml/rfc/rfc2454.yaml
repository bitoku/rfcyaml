  - "Abstract\n   This document is one in the series of documents that define various\n\
    \   MIB objects for IPv6.  Specifically, this document is the MIB module\n   which\
    \ defines managed objects for implementations of the User\n   Datagram Protocol\
    \ (UDP) over IP Version 6 (IPv6).\n   This document also recommends a specific\
    \ policy with respect to the\n   applicability of RFC 2013 for implementations\
    \ of IPv6.  Namely, that\n   most of managed objects defined in RFC 2013 are independent\
    \ of which\n   IP versions underlie UDP, and only the UDP listener information\
    \ is IP\n   version-specific.\n   This memo defines an experimental portion of\
    \ the Management\n   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols\
    \ in\n   IPv6-based internets.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A management system contains: several (potentially many)\
    \ nodes, each\n   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access\
    \ to\n   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a\n\
    \   management protocol, used to convey management information between\n   the\
    \ agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are\n   carried\
    \ out under an administrative framework which defines\n   authentication, authorization,\
    \ access control, and privacy policies.\n   Management stations execute management\
    \ applications which monitor and\n   control managed elements.  Managed elements\
    \ are devices such as\n   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored\
    \ and\n   controlled via access to their management information.\n   Management\
    \ information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,\n   residing in a\
    \ virtual information store, termed the Management\n   Information Base (MIB).\
    \  Collections of related objects are defined\n   in MIB modules.  These modules\
    \ are written using a subset of OSI's\n   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\
    \ [1], termed the Structure of\n   Management Information (SMI) [2].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   This document is one in the series of documents that define\
    \ various\n   MIB objects, and statements of conformance, for IPv6.  This document\n\
    \   defines the required instrumentation for implementations of UDP over\n   IPv6.\n"
- title: 3.  Transparency of IP versions to UDP
  contents:
  - "3.  Transparency of IP versions to UDP\n   The fact that UDP is carried over\
    \ IPv6 as opposed to IPv4, is largely\n   invisible to a UDP implementation. \
    \ A \"UDPng\" did not need to be\n   defined, implementations simply need to support\
    \ IPv6 addresses.\n   As such, the managed objects already defined in [UDP MIB]\
    \ are\n   sufficient for managing UDP in the presence of IPv6.  These objects\n\
    \   are equally applicable whether the managed node supports IPv4 only,\n   IPv6\
    \ only, or both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   For example, udpInDatagrams counts \"The total\
    \ number of UDP datagrams\n   delivered to UDP users\", regardless of which version\
    \ of IP is used to\n   deliver any of those datagrams.\n   Stated differently,\
    \ UDP implementations don't need separate counters\n   for IPv4 and for IPv6.\n"
- title: 4.  Representing UDP Listeners
  contents:
  - "4.  Representing UDP Listeners\n   The exception to the statements in section\
    \ 3 is the udpTable.  Since\n   IPv6 addresses cannot be represented with the\
    \ IpAddress syntax, not\n   all UDP endpoints can be represented in the udpTable\
    \ defined in [UDP\n   MIB].\n   This memo defines a new, separate table to represent\
    \ only those UDP\n   endpoints that utilize an IPv6 address.  UDP endpoints on\
    \ IPv4\n   addresses continue to be represented in udpTable [UDP MIB].\n   A different\
    \ approach would have been to define a new table to\n   represent all UDP endpoints\
    \ regardless of IP version.  This would\n   require changes to [UDP MIB] and hence\
    \ to existing (IPv4-only) UDP\n   implementations.  The approach suggested in\
    \ this memo has the\n   advantage of leaving IPv4-only implementations intact.\n\
    \   It is assumed that the objects defined in this memo will eventually\n   be\
    \ defined in an update to [UDP MIB].  For this reason, the module\n   identity\
    \ is assigned under the experimental portion of the MIB.\n"

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB that have a MAX-\n   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So,\
    \ if this MIB is\n   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder\
    \ can\n   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP\n\
    \   SET operations.\n   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that\
    \ may be\n   considered to contain sensitive information in some environments.\n\
    \   For example, the MIB identifies UDP ports on which processes are\n   listening.\
    \  Although this information might be considered sensitive\n   in some environments\
    \ (i.e., to identify ports on which to launch\n   denial-of-service or other attacks),\
    \ there are already other ways of\n   obtaining similar information.  For example,\
    \ sending a random UDP\n   packet to an unused port prompts the generation of\
    \ an ICMP port\n   unreachable message.\n   Therefore, it may be important in\
    \ some environments to control read\n   access to these objects and possibly to\
    \ even encrypt the values of\n   these object when sending them over the network\
    \ via SNMP.  Not all\n   versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself does not provide encryption or strong\n   authentication.\n\
    \   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security\n   features\
    \ as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based\
    \ Security Model [RFC2274] and the View-based Access\n   Control Model [RFC2275]\
    \ is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that\
    \ the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly\n\
    \   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals\n   (users)\
    \ that have legitimate rights to access them.\n"
