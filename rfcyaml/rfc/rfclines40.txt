More Comments on the Forthcoming Protocol We have recently discussed NWG/RFC Nos.
36 and 39 with Steve Crocker, UCLA.
Steve has asked that we elaborate on the errors, queries, and HOST status that were mentioned in NWG/RFC #39.
Please voice your opinions soon in order to affect the forthcoming protocol specifications.
<Command length> <Command in error>
<Code> is an eight bit field that specifies the error type.
The assigned codes are shown below.
> is a 16 bit integer that indicates the length of the <Command in error> in bits.
> is the spurious command.
The ranges of <Code> are shown below in hexidecimal. 00
Unspecified error types 10 0F  Resource errors
10 1F  Status errors 20 2F  Content errors 30 3F
Unused Specific values of <Code> are shown below with their meaning.
Request for an invalid resource.
Request for an exhausted resource, try later.
Invalid <RSM>, i.e., link connected but unblocked.
Invalid <ASG>, i.e., connected but no <RDY> received.
Invalid <RSM>, i.e., link not connected.
Invalid <ASG>, i.e., not connected.
The <QRY> is the query indicated in NWG/RFC #39 and <RPY> is the reply.
The format of <Text> is shown below; also refer to NWG/RFC #36, p. 3.
<16 bit count of relevant connection table entries> <relevant connection table entries> <relevant connection table entries
<a relevant connection table entry> <a relevant connection table entry
flow state and buffer control> <reconnection control state
An NCP may be up, down, pending, etc.
When an NCP changes its state to UP
it should send a <NOP> to each remote NCP which indicates the NCP is available.
The sending NCP can then construct a vector of HOST status from the RFNMs it receives.
An NCP receiving a <NOP> can update the availability of the sending NCP in its HOST status vector.
