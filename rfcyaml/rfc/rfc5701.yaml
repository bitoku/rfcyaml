  - "Abstract\n   Current specifications of BGP Extended Communities (RFC 4360) support\n
    \  the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, but do not support an\n   IPv6
    Address Specific Extended Community.  The lack of an IPv6\n   Address Specific
    Extended Community may be a problem when an\n   application uses the IPv4 Address
    Specific Extended Community, and\n   one wants to use this application in a pure
    IPv6 environment.  This\n   document defines a new BGP attribute, the IPv6 Address
    Specific\n   Extended Community, that addresses this problem.  The IPv6 Address\n
    \  Specific Extended Community is similar to the IPv4 Address Specific\n   Extended
    Community, except that it carries an IPv6 address rather\n   than an IPv4 address.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Current specifications of BGP Extended Communities [RFC4360]
    support\n   the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, but do not support an\n
    \  IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community.  The lack of an IPv6\n   Address
    Specific Extended Community may be a problem when an\n   application uses IPv4
    Address Specific Extended Community and one\n   wants to use this application
    in a pure IPv6 environment.\n   Because the BGP Extended Community attribute defines
    each BGP\n   Extended Community as being 8 octets long, it is not possible to\n
    \  define the IPv6 Specific Extended Community using the existing BGP\n   Extended
    Community attribute [RFC4360].  Therefore, this document\n   defines a new BGP
    attribute, the IPv6 Address Specific Extended\n   Community, that has a structure
    similar to the IPv4 Address Specific\n   Extended Community, and thus could be
    used in a pure IPv6 environment\n   as a replacement of the IPv4 Address Specific
    Extended Community.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  IPv6 Address Specific BGP Extended Community Attribute\n   The IPv6 Address
    Specific Extended Community Attribute is a\n   transitive, optional BGP attribute
    [BGP-4].  The attribute consists\n   of a set of \"IPv6 Address Specific extended
    communities\".  All routes\n   with the IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community
    attribute belong to\n   the communities listed in the attribute.\n   Just like
    all other BGP Extended Communities, the IPv6 Address\n   Specific Extended Community
    supports multiple sub-types.\n   Each IPv6 Address Specific extended community
    is encoded as a\n   20-octet quantity, as follows:\n    0                   1
    \                  2                   3\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
    6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  | 0x00 or 0x40  |    Sub-Type   |    Global Administrator       |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  |          Global Administrator (cont.)                         |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n

    \  |          Global Administrator (cont.)                         |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  | Global Administrator (cont.)  |    Local Administrator        |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  The first high-order octet indicates whether a particular sub-type of\n   this
    community is transitive across Autonomous Systems (ASes) (0x00),\n   or not (0x40).
    \ The second high-order octet of this extended type is\n   used to indicate sub-types.
    \ The sub-types are the same as for the\n   IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community.\n
    \  Global Administrator field: 16 octets\n      This field contains an IPv6 unicast
    address assigned by one of the\n      Internet registries.\n   Local Administrator
    field: 2 octets\n      The organization that has been assigned the IPv6 address
    in the\n      Global Administrator field can encode any information in this\n
    \     field.  The format and meaning of the value encoded in this field\n      should
    be defined by the sub-type of the community.\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a new BGP attribute, called
    the IPv6 Address\n   Specific Extended Community (value 25).\n   This document
    defines a class of extended communities, called the\n   IPv6 Address Specific
    Extended Community, for which the IANA has\n   created and will maintain a registry
    entitled \"IPv6 Address Specific\n   Extended Community\".  Future assignments
    are to be made using the\n   \"First Come First Served\" policy defined in [RFC5226].
    \ The Type\n   values for the transitive communities of the IPv6 Address Specific\n
    \  Extended Community class are 0x0000-0x00ff; for the non-transitive\n   communities
    of that class, they are 0x4000-0x40ff.  Assignments\n   consist of a name and
    the value.\n   This document makes the following assignments for the IPv6 Address\n
    \  Specific extended community types:\n      Name                                     Type
    Value\n      ----                                     --------------\n      IPv6
    address specific Route Target       0x0002\n      IPv6 address specific Route
    Origin       0x0003\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not add new security issues.
    \ All the security\n   considerations for BGP Extended Communities apply here.
    \ At the time\n   that this document was written, there were significant efforts\n
    \  underway to improve the security properties of BGP.  For examples of\n   documents
    that have been produced up to this time of publication, see\n   [RFC4593] and
    [SIDR].\n   There is a potential serious issue if a malformed, optional,\n   transitive
    attribute is received.  This issue and the steps to avoid\n   it are discussed
    in [OPT_TRANS].\n"
