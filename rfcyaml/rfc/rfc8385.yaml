  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL)\n\
    \   protocol [RFC6325] [RFC7177] [RFC7780] provides transparent\n   forwarding\
    \ in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link\n   technologies using\
    \ a header with a hop count and link-state routing.\n   TRILL provides optimal\
    \ pair-wise forwarding without configuration,\n   safe forwarding even during\
    \ periods of temporary loops, and support\n   for multipathing of both unicast\
    \ and multicast traffic.  Intermediate\n   Systems (ISs) implementing TRILL are\
    \ called Routing Bridges\n   (RBridges) or TRILL switches.\n   This document,\
    \ in conjunction with [RFC7173] on TRILL transport using\n   pseudowires, addresses\
    \ two problems:\n   1) providing connection between more than two TRILL sites\
    \ that belong\n      to a single TRILL network and are separated by an MPLS provider\n\
    \      network using [RFC7173].  (Herein, this is also called \"problem\n    \
    \  statement 1\".)\n   2) providing a single logical virtualized TRILL network\
    \ for different\n      tenants that are separated by an MPLS provider network.\
    \  In short,\n      this is for providing connection between TRILL sites belonging\
    \ to\n      a tenant/tenants over a MPLS provider network.  (Herein, this is\n\
    \      also called \"problem statement 2\".)\n   A tenant is the administrative\
    \ entity on whose behalf their\n   associated services are managed.  Here, \"\
    tenant\" refers to a TRILL\n   campus that is segregated from other tenants for\
    \ security reasons.\n   A key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation so\
    \ that one\n   tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  This document\n\
    \   also addresses the problem of multi-tenancy by isolating one tenant's\n  \
    \ traffic from the other.\n   [RFC7173] mentions how to interconnect a pair of\
    \ TRILL switch ports\n   using pseudowires.  This document explains how to connect\
    \ multiple\n   TRILL sites (not limited to only two sites) using the mechanisms\
    \ and\n   encapsulations defined in [RFC7173].\n"

    \ connected to VPLS-capable PE devices\n   that provide a logical interconnect,\
    \ such that TRILL RBridges\n   belonging to a specific tenant are connected via\
    \ a single bridged\n   Ethernet.  These PE devices are the same as the PE devices\
    \ specified\n   in [RFC4026].  The Attachment Circuit ports of PE routers are\
    \ Layer 2\n   switch ports that are connected to the RBridges at a TRILL site.\n\
    \   Here, each VPLS instance looks like an emulated LAN.  This model is\n   similar\
    \ to connecting different RBridges by a Layer 2 bridge domain\n   (multi-access\
    \ link) as specified in [RFC6325].  This model doesn't\n   requires any changes\
    \ in PE routers to carry TRILL packets, as TRILL\n   packets will be transferred\
    \ transparently.\n"

- title: 4.  VPTS Model
  contents:
  - "4.  VPTS Model\n   The Virtual Private TRILL Service (VPTS) is a Layer 2 TRILL\
    \ service\n   that emulates TRILL service across a Wide Area Network (WAN).  VPTS\n\
    \   is similar to what VPLS does for a bridged core but provides a TRILL\n   core.\
    \  VPLS provides \"Virtual Private LAN Service\" for different\n   customers.\
    \  VPTS provides \"Virtual Private TRILL Service\" for\n   different TRILL tenants.\n\
    \   Figure 3 shows the topological model of TRILL over MPLS using VPTS.\n   In\
    \ this model, the PE routers are replaced with TRILL Intermediate\n   Routers\
    \ (TIRs), and the VSIs are replaced with Virtual TRILL Switch\n   Domains (VTSDs).\
    \  The TIR devices must be capable of supporting both\n   MPLS and TRILL as specified\
    \ in Section 4.1.1.  The TIR devices are\n   interconnected via PWs and appear\
    \ as a unified emulated TRILL campus\n   with each VTSD inside a TIR equivalent\
    \ to an RBridge.\n   Below are some of the reasons for interconnecting TRILL sites\
    \ without\n   isolating the TRILL control plane of one TRILL site from other sites.\n\
    \   1) Nickname uniqueness: One of the basic requirements of TRILL is\n      that\
    \ RBridge nicknames are unique within the campus [RFC6325].  If\n      we segregate\
    \ the control plane of one TRILL site from other TRILL\n      sites and provide\
    \ interconnection between these sites, it may\n      result in nickname collision.\n\
    \   2) Distribution trees and their pruning: When a TRILL Data packet\n      traverses\
    \ a Distribution Tree, it will stay on it even in other\n      TRILL sites.  If\
    \ no end-station service is enabled for a\n      particular Data Label in a TRILL\
    \ site, the distribution tree may\n      be pruned and TRILL data packets of that\
    \ particular Data Label\n      might never get to another TRILL site where the\
    \ packets had no\n      receivers.  The TRILL Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check\
    \ will\n      always be performed on the packets that are received by TIRs\n \
    \     through pseudowires.\n   3) Hop count values: When a TRILL data packet is\
    \ received over a\n      pseudowire by a TIR, the TIR does the processing of Hop\
    \ Count\n      defined in [RFC6325] and will not perform any resetting of Hop\n\
    \      Count.\n        +-----+                                               +-----+\n\

- title: 4.1.1.  TRILL Intermediate Router (TIR)
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  TRILL Intermediate Router (TIR)\n   The TIRs must be capable of running\
    \ both VPLS and TRILL protocols.\n   TIR devices are a superset of the VPLS-PE\
    \ devices defined in\n   [RFC4026] with the additional functionality of TRILL.\
    \  The VSI that\n   provides transparent bridging functionality in the PE device\
    \ is\n   replaced with VTSD in a TIR.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Virtual TRILL Switch/Service Domain (VTSD)
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Virtual TRILL Switch/Service Domain (VTSD)\n   The VTSD is similar to\
    \ the VSI (Layer 2 bridge) in the VPLS model,\n   but the VTSD acts as a TRILL\
    \ RBridge.  The VTSD is a superset of the\n   VSI and must support all the functionality\
    \ provided by the VSI as\n   defined in [RFC4026].  Along with VSI functionality,\
    \ the VTSD must be\n   capable of supporting TRILL protocols and forming TRILL\
    \ adjacencies.\n   The VTSD must be capable of performing all the operations that\
    \ a\n   standard TRILL switch can do.\n   One VTSD instance per tenant must be\
    \ maintained when multiple tenants\n   are connected to a TIR.  The VTSD must\
    \ maintain all the information\n   kept by the RBridge on a per-tenant basis.\
    \  The VTSD must also take\n   care of segregating one tenant's traffic from another's.\
    \  Each VTSD\n   will have its own nickname for each tenant.  If a TIR supports\
    \ 10\n   TRILL tenants, it needs to be assigned with 10 TRILL nicknames, one\n\
    \   for the nickname space of each of its tenants, and run 10 copies of\n   TRILL\
    \ protocols, one for each tenant.  It is possible that it would\n   have the same\
    \ nickname for two or more tenants, but, since the TRILL\n   data and control\
    \ traffic are separated for the tenants, there is no\n   confusion.\n"
- title: 4.2.  TRILL Adjacency for VPTS Model
  contents:
  - "4.2.  TRILL Adjacency for VPTS Model\n   The VTSD must be capable of forming\
    \ a TRILL adjacency with the\n   corresponding VTSDs present in its peer VPTS\
    \ neighbor and also with\n   the neighboring RBridges of the TRILL sites.  The\
    \ procedure to form\n   TRILL adjacency is specified in [RFC7173] and [RFC7177].\n"
- title: 4.3.  MPLS Encapsulation for VPTS Model
  contents:
  - "4.3.  MPLS Encapsulation for VPTS Model\n   The VPTS model uses PPP or Ethernet\
    \ pseudowires for MPLS\n   encapsulation as specified in [RFC7173] and requires\
    \ no changes in\n   the packet format in that RFC.  In accordance with [RFC7173],\
    \ the PPP\n   encapsulation is the default.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Loop-Free Provider PSN/MPLS
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Loop-Free Provider PSN/MPLS\n   This model isn't required to employ the\
    \ \"split horizon\" mechanism in\n   the provider PSN network, as TRILL takes\
    \ care of loop-free topology\n   using distribution trees.  Any multi-destination\
    \ packet will traverse\n   a distribution tree path.  All distribution trees are\
    \ calculated\n   based on the TRILL base protocol standard [RFC6325] as updated\
    \ by\n   [RFC7780].\n"

    \ frame processing\n   in the VPTS/TIR model.\n"
- title: 4.5.1.  Multi-destination Frame Processing
  contents:
  - "4.5.1.  Multi-destination Frame Processing\n   Any multi-destination (unknown\
    \ unicast, multicast, or broadcast, as\n   indicated by the multi-destination\
    \ bit in the TRILL header) packets\n   inside a VTSD will be processed or forwarded\
    \ through the distribution\n   tree for which they were encapsulated on TRILL\
    \ ingress.  If any\n   multi-destination packet is received from the wrong pseudowire\
    \ at a\n   VTSD, the TRILL protocol running in the VTSD will perform an RPF\n\
    \   check as specified in [RFC7780] and drop the packet.\n   The pruning mechanism\
    \ in distribution trees, as specified in\n   [RFC6325] and [RFC7780], can also\
    \ be used to avoid forwarding of\n   multi-destination data packets on the branches\
    \ where there are no\n   potential destinations.\n"
- title: 4.5.2.  Unicast Frame Processing
  contents:
  - "4.5.2.  Unicast Frame Processing\n   Unicast packets are forwarded in the same\
    \ way they get forwarded in a\n   standard TRILL campus as specified in [RFC6325].\
    \  If multiple equal-\n   cost paths are available over pseudowires to reach the\
    \ destination,\n   then VTSD should be capable of doing ECMP for those equal-cost\
    \ paths.\n"
- title: 5.  VPTS Model versus VPLS Model
  contents:
  - "5.  VPTS Model versus VPLS Model\n   The VPLS model uses a simpler loop-breaking\
    \ rule: the \"split horizon\"\n   rule, where a PE must not forward traffic from\
    \ one PW to another in\n   the same VPLS mesh.  In contrast, the VPTS model uses\
    \ distribution\n   trees for loop-free topology.  As this is an emulated TRILL\
    \ service,\n   for interoperability purposes, the VPTS model is the default.\n"
- title: 6.  Packet Processing between Pseudowires
  contents:
  - "6.  Packet Processing between Pseudowires\n   Whenever a packet gets received\
    \ over a pseudowire, a VTSD will\n   decapsulate the MPLS headers then check the\
    \ TRILL header.  If the\n   egress nickname in the TRILL header is for a TRILL\
    \ site located\n   beyond another pseudowire, then the VTSD will encapsulate the\
    \ packet\n   with new MPLS headers and send it across the proper pseudowire.\n\
    \   For example, in Figure 3, consider that the pseudowire between TIR1\n   and\
    \ TIR2 fails.  Then, TIR1 will communicate with TIR2 via TIR3.\n   Whenever packets\
    \ that are destined to TIR3 are received from the\n   pseudowire between TIR1\
    \ and TIR3, the VTSD inside TIR3 will\n   decapsulate the MPLS headers, then check\
    \ the TRILL header's egress\n   nickname field.  If the egress nickname indicates\
    \ it is destined for\n   the RBridge in Site 3, then the packet will be sent to\
    \ RBc; if the\n   egress nickname is located at Site 2, VTSD will add MPLS headers\
    \ for\n   the pseudowire between TIR3 and TIR2 and forward the packet on that\n\
    \   pseudowire.\n"
- title: 7.  Efficiency Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Efficiency Considerations\n   Since the VPTS model uses distribution trees\
    \ for processing of multi-\n   destination data packets, it is always advisable\
    \ to have at least one\n   distribution tree root located in every TRILL site.\
    \  This will\n   prevent data packets from being received at TRILL sites where\
    \ end-\n   station service is not enabled for that data packet.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies methods using existing\
    \ standards and\n   facilities in ways that do not create new security problems.\n\
    \   For general VPLS security considerations, including discussion of\n   isolating\
    \ customers from each other, see [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].\n   For security considerations\
    \ for transport of TRILL by pseudowires,\n   see [RFC7173].  In particular, since\
    \ pseudowires are supported by\n   MPLS or IP, which are in turn supported by\
    \ a link layer, that\n   document recommends using IP security, such as IPsec\
    \ [RFC4301] or\n   DTLS [RFC6347], or the lower link-layer security, such as MACSEC\n\
    \   [802.1AE] for Ethernet links.\n   Transmission outside the customer environment\
    \ through the provider\n   environment, as described in this document, increases\
    \ risk of\n   compromise or injection of false data through failure of tenant\n\
    \   isolation or by the provider.  In the VPLS model (Section 3), the use\n  \
    \ of link encryption and authentication between the CEs of a tenant\n   that is\
    \ being connected through provider facilities should be a good\n   defense.  In\
    \ the VPTS model (Section 4), it is assumed that the CEs\n   will peer with virtual\
    \ TRILL switches of the provider network, and\n   thus link security between TRILL\
    \ switch ports is inadequate as it\n   will terminate at the edge PE.  Thus, encryption\
    \ and authentication\n   from end station to end station and authentication are\
    \ more\n   appropriate for the VPTS model.\n   For added security against the\
    \ compromise of data, end-to-end\n   encryption and authentication should be considered;\
    \ that is,\n   encryption and authentication from source end station to destination\n\
    \   end station.  This would typically be provided by IPsec [RFC4301] or\n   DTLS\
    \ [RFC6347] or other protocols convenient to protect the\n   information of concern.\n\
    \   For general TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6325].\n"
