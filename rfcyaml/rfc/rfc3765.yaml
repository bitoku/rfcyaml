- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   BGP today has a limited number of commonly defined mechanisms\
    \ that\n   allow a route to be propagated across some subset of the routing\n\
    \   system.  The NOEXPORT community allows a BGP speaker to specify that\n   redistribution\
    \ should extend only to the neighbouring AS.  Providers\n   commonly define a\
    \ number of communities that allow their neighbours\n   to specify how advertised\
    \ routes should be re-advertised.  Current\n   operational practice is that such\
    \ communities are defined on as AS by\n   AS basis, and while they allow an AS\
    \ to influence the re-\n   advertisement behaviour of routes passed from a neighbouring\
    \ AS, they\n   do not allow this scope definition ability to be passed in a\n\
    \   transitive fashion to a remote AS.\n   Advertisement scope specification is\
    \ of most use in specifying the\n   boundary conditions of route propagation.\
    \  The specification can take\n   on a number of forms, including as AS transit\
    \ hop count, a set of\n   target ASs, the presence of a particular route object,\
    \ or a\n   particular characteristic of the inter-AS connection.\n   There are\
    \ a number of motivations for controlling the scope of\n   advertisement of route\
    \ prefixes, including support of limited transit\n   services where advertisements\
    \ are restricted to certain transit\n   providers, and various forms of selective\
    \ transit in a multi-homed\n   environment.\n   This memo does not attempt to\
    \ address all such motivations of scope\n   control, and addresses in particular\
    \ the situation of both multi-\n   homing and traffic engineering.  The commonly\
    \ adopted operational\n   technique is that the originating AS advertises an encompassing\n\
    \   aggregate route to all multi-home neighbours, and also selectively\n   advertises\
    \ a collection of more specific routes.  This implements a\n   form of destination-based\
    \ traffic engineering with some level of fail\n   over protection.  The more specific\
    \ routes typically cease to lever\n   any useful traffic engineering outcome beyond\
    \ a certain radius of\n   redistribution, and a means of advising that such routes\
    \ need not to\n   be distributed beyond such a point is of some value in moderating\
    \ one\n   of the factors of continued route table growth.\n   Analysis of the\
    \ BGP routing tables reveals a significant use of the\n   technique of advertising\
    \ more specific prefixes in addition to\n   advertising a covering aggregate.\
    \  In an effort to ameliorate some of\n   the effects of this practice, in terms\
    \ of overall growth of the BGP\n   routing tables in the Internet and the associated\
    \ burden of global\n   propagation of dynamic changes in the reachability of such\
    \ more\n   specific address prefixes, this memo describes the use of a\n   transitive\
    \ BGP route attribute that allows more specific route tables\n   entries to be\
    \ discarded from the BGP tables under appropriate\n   conditions.  Specifically,\
    \ this attribute, NOPEER, allows a remote AS\n   not to advertise a route object\
    \ to a neighbour AS when the two AS's\n   are interconnected under the conditions\
    \ of some form of sender keep\n   all arrangement, as distinct from some form\
    \ of provider / customer\n   arrangement.\n"
- title: 2.  NOPEER Attribute
  contents:
  - "2.  NOPEER Attribute\n   This memo defines the use a new well-known bgp transitive\
    \ community,\n   NOPEER.\n   The semantics of this attribute is to allow an AS\
    \ to interpret the\n   presence of this community as an advisory qualification\
    \ to\n   readvertisement of a route prefix, permitting an AS not to\n   readvertise\
    \ the route prefix to all external bilateral peer neighbour\n   AS's.  It is consistent\
    \ with these semantics that an AS may filter\n   received prefixes that are received\
    \ across a peering session that the\n   receiver regards as a bilateral peer sessions.\n"
- title: 3.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivation\n   The size of the BGP routing table has been increasing at an\n\
    \   accelerating rate since late 1998.  At the time of publication of\n   this\
    \ memo the BGP forwarding table contains over 118,000 entries, and\n   the three\
    \ year growth rate of this table shows a trend rate which can\n   be correlated\
    \ to a compound growth rate of no less than 10% per year\n   [2].\n   One of the\
    \ aspects of the current BGP routing table is the widespread\n   use of the technique\
    \ of advertising both an aggregate and a number of\n   more specific address prefixes.\
    \  For example, the table may contain a\n   routing entry for the prefix 10.0.0.0/23\
    \ and also contain entries for\n   the prefixes 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24. \
    \ In this example the\n   specific routes fully cover the aggregate announcement.\
    \  Sparse\n   coverage of aggregates with more specifics is also observed, where,\n\
    \   for example, routing entries for 10.0.0.0/8 and 10.0.1.0/24 both\n   exist\
    \ in the routing table.  In total, these more specific route\n   entries occupy\
    \ some 51% of the routing table, so that more than one\n   half of the routing\
    \ table does not add additional address\n   reachability information into the\
    \ routing system, but instead is used\n   to impose a finer level of detail on\
    \ existing reachability\n   information.\n   There are a number of motivations\
    \ for having both an aggregate route\n   and a number of more specific routes\
    \ in the routing table, including\n   various forms of multi-homed configurations,\
    \ where there is a\n   requirement to specify a different reachability policy\
    \ for a part of\n   the advertised address space.\n   One of the observed common\
    \ requirements in the multi-homed network\n   configuration is that of undertaking\
    \ some form of load balancing of\n   incoming traffic across a number of external\
    \ connections to a number\n   of different neighbouring ASs.  If, for example,\
    \ an AS wishes to use\n   a multi-homed configuration for routing-based load balancing\
    \ and some\n   form of mutual fail over between the multiple access connections\
    \ for\n   incoming traffic, then one approach is for the AS to advertise the\n\
    \   same aggregate address prefix to a number of its upstream transit\n   providers,\
    \ and then advertise a number of more specifics to\n   individual upstream providers.\
    \  In such a case all of the traffic\n   destined to the more specific address\
    \ prefixes will be received only\n   over those connections where the more specific\
    \ has been advertised.\n   If the neighbour BGP peering session of the more specific\n\
    \   advertisement fails, the more specific will cease to be announced and\n  \
    \ incoming traffic will then be passed to the originating network based\n   on\
    \ the path associated with the advertisement of the encompassing\n   aggregate.\
    \  In this situation the more specific routes are not\n   automatically subsumed\
    \ by the presence of the aggregate at any remote\n   AS.  Both the aggregate and\
    \ the associated more specific routes are\n   redistributed across the entire\
    \ external BGP routing domain.  In many\n   cases, particularly those associated\
    \ with desire to undertake traffic\n   engineering and service resilience, the\
    \ more specific routes are\n   redistributed well beyond the scope where there\
    \ is any outcomes in\n   terms of traffic differentiation.\n   To the extent that\
    \ remote analysis of BGP tables can observe this\n   form of configuration, the\
    \ number of entries in the BGP forwarding\n   table where more specific entries\
    \ share a common origin AS with their\n   immediately enclosing aggregates comprise\
    \ some 20% of the total\n   number of FIB entries.  Using a slightly stricter\
    \ criteria where the\n   AS path of the more specific route matches the immediately\
    \ enclosing\n   aggregate, the number of more specific routes comprises some 14%\
    \ of\n   the number of FIB entries.\n   One protocol mechanism that could be useful\
    \ in this context is to\n   allow the originator of an advertisement to state\
    \ some additional\n   qualification on the redistribution of the advertisement,\
    \ allowing a\n   remote AS to suppress further redistribution under some originator-\n\
    \   specified criteria.\n   The redistribution qualification condition can be\
    \ specified either by\n   enumeration or by classification.  Enumeration would\
    \ encompass the\n   use of a well-known transitive extended community to specify\
    \ a list\n   of remote AS's where further redistribution is not advised.  The\n\
    \   weakness of this approach is that the originating AS would need to\n   constantly\
    \ revise this enumerated AS list to reflect the changes in\n   inter-AS topology,\
    \ as, otherwise, the more specific routes would leak\n   beyond the intended redistribution\
    \ scope.  An approach of\n   classification allows an originating AS to specify\
    \ the conditions\n   where further redistribution is not advised without having\
    \ to refer\n   to the particular AS's where a match to such conditions are\n \
    \  anticipated.\n   The approach described here to specifying the redistribution\
    \ boundary\n   condition is one based on the type of bilateral inter-AS peering.\n\
    \   Where one AS can be considered as a customer, and the other AS can be\n  \
    \ considered as a contracted agent of the customer, or provider, then\n   the\
    \ relationship is one where the provider, as an agent of the\n   customer, carries\
    \ the routes and associated policy associated with\n   the routes.  Where neither\
    \ AS can be considered as a customer of the\n   other, then the relationship is\
    \ one of bilateral peering, and neither\n   AS can be considered as an agent of\
    \ the other in redistributing\n   policies associated with routes.  This latter\
    \ arrangement is commonly\n   referred to as a \"sender keep all peer\" relationship,\
    \ or \"peering\".\n   This peer boundary can be regarded as a logical point where\
    \ the\n   redistribution of additional reachability policy imposed by the\n  \
    \ origin AS on a route is no longer an imposed requirement.\n   This approach\
    \ allows an originator of a prefix to attach a commonly\n   defined policy to\
    \ a route prefix, indicate that a route should be\n   re-advertised conditionally,\
    \ based on the characteristics of the\n   inter-AS connection.\n"

    \   This is an advisory qualification to readvertisement of a route\n   prefix,\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   BGP is an instance of a relaying protocol, where\
    \ route information is\n   received, processed and forwarded.  BGP contains no\
    \ specific\n   mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized modification of the\n  \
    \ information by a forwarding agent, allowing routing information to be\n   modified,\
    \ deleted or false information to be inserted without the\n   knowledge of the\
    \ originator of the routing information or any of the\n   recipients.\n   The\
    \ NOPEER community does not alter this overall situation concerning\n   the integrity\
    \ of BGP as a routing system.\n   Use of the NOPEER community has the capability\
    \ to introduce\n   additional attack mechanisms into BGP by allowing the potential\
    \ for\n   man-in-the-middle, session-hijacking, or denial of service attacks\n\
    \   for an address prefix range being launched by a remote AS.\n   Unauthorized\
    \ addition of this community to a route prefix by a\n   transit provider where\
    \ there is no covering aggregate route prefix\n   may cause a denial of service\
    \ attack based on denial of reachability\n   to the prefix.  Even in the case\
    \ that there is a covering aggregate,\n   if the more specific route has a different\
    \ origin AS than the\n   aggregate, the addition of this community by a transit\
    \ AS may cause a\n   denial of service attack on the origin AS of the more specific\n\
    \   prefix.\n   BGP is already vulnerable to a denial of service attack based\
    \ on the\n   injection of false routing information.  It is possible to use this\n\
    \   community to limit the redistribution of a false route entry such\n   that\
    \ its visibility can be limited and detection and rectification of\n   the problem\
    \ can be more difficult under the circumstances of limited\n   redistribution.\n"
