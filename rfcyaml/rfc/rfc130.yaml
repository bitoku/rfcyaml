  - "           RESPONSE TO RFC #111 (PRESSURE FROM THE CHAIRMAN)\n   The purpose\
    \ of RFC #111, as I interpret it, is two-fold:  1) To\n   establish realistic\
    \ implementation schedules and to make them known\n   to the Network community\
    \ so as to expedite everyone's planning of\n   productive use of Network Services.\
    \  2) To uncover implementation\n   techniques and strategies that were most successful\
    \ and might be\n   useful in future implementations.\n   RFC #111 asks for implementation\
    \ schedules.  I have not \"prodded\"\n   host teams yet because an integral part\
    \ of those schedules includes\n   TELNET for which no specification is known to\
    \ everyone.  Tom\n   O'Sullivan, Raytheon (TELNET Chairman) and John Melvin, SRI\
    \ (TELNET\n   Committee Member) advise me that a TELNET RFC will be generated\
    \ soon.\n   I will subsequently contact site liaisons concerning a schedule.\n\
    \   I will talk with Alex McKenzie, BBN about the form of publication of\n   these\
    \ schedules.  Alex and I agree that they should be published as\n   an RFC updating\
    \ NIC Memo #5767 (ARPA Network Site Status).  I will\n   collect and compile the\
    \ information via phone, mail or NIC and send\n   it to Alex for technical editing\
    \ and subsequent NIC RFC publication.\n   Alex informed me that the forthcoming\
    \ Resource Notebook (see NIC\n   #5760) includes much of the information on use\
    \ of services, obtaining\n   job numbers, etc.  RFC #111 schedules will be an\
    \ update of NIC #5767\n   and may reference, but will not duplicate, the Resource\
    \ Notebook.\n   One begins to wonder why I'm in this loop since Alex has the\n\
    \   responsibility to periodically update NIC #5767.  The reason, as RFC\n   #111\
    \ states, is that Rand will assist in testing implementations\n   remotely.  To\
    \ facilitate testing, I would like first-hand information\n   on schedules and\
    \ comments on how we might be of service in this\n   respect.  Testing will be\
    \ short-term and will not go beyond what is\n   included in RFC #111.  I will\
    \ contact site liaisons shortly to find\n   out if and how we can be of assistance\
    \ in this capacity.\n   Please feel free to contact either me or Eric Harslem\
    \ regarding this\n   RFC or RFC #111.\n        [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry]\n      [into the online RFC archives by Alison M. De\
    \ La Cruz 12/00]\n"
