  - "1.  Introduction\n   The CalDAV [RFC4791] calendar access protocol allows clients
    to\n   access calendar data stored on a server in the iCalendar [RFC5545]\n   data
    format.  In iCalendar, calendar data that uses local time in any\n   of its date
    and/or time values is specified as a date-time value in\n   combination with a
    time zone identifier (\"TZID\" property parameter).\n   The time zone identifier
    refers to a time zone definition (a\n   \"VTIMEZONE\" component) that has all
    of the rules required to\n   determine local-time UTC offsets for the corresponding
    time zone.  In\n   many cases, these \"VTIMEZONE\" components can be larger, octet-wise,\n
    \  than the events or tasks that make use of them.  However, iCalendar\n   currently
    requires all iCalendar objects (\"VCALENDAR\" components)\n   that refer to a
    time zone via its identifier to also include the\n   corresponding \"VTIMEZONE\"
    component.  This leads to inefficiencies in\n   the CalDAV protocol because large
    amounts of \"VTIMEZONE\" data are\n   continuously being exchanged, and for the
    most part these time zone\n   definitions are unchanging.  This is particularly
    problematic for\n   mobile or limited devices, with limited network bandwidth,
    CPU, and\n   energy resources.\n   A set of standard time zone definitions are
    available at the IANA-\n   hosted time zone database [RFC6557].  That database
    provides the\n   \"raw\" data for time zone definitions, and those can be converted
    into\n   iCalendar \"VTIMEZONE\" components for use in iCalendar applications,\n
    \  as well as converted into other formats for use by other applications\n   (e.g.,
    \"zoneinfo\" files often found on Unix-based operating systems).\n   A new time
    zone data distribution service protocol [RFC7808] is\n   available that allows
    iCalendar applications to retrieve these\n   standard time zone definitions in
    a timely and accurate fashion,\n   instead of relying on possibly infrequent system
    updates of time zone\n   data that frequently result in mismatched calendar data
    and thus\n   missed meetings between calendar users.  Another benefit of the time\n
    \  zone data distribution service is that it provides a single\n   \"reference\"
    for standard time zone data that CalDAV clients and\n   servers can make use of
    to \"agree\" on standard time zone definitions,\n   and thus eliminate the need
    to exchange the data for those.\n   This specification defines a new mode of operation
    for CalDAV clients\n   and servers that allows them to exchange iCalendar data
    without the\n   need to send \"VTIMEZONE\" components for known, standard time
    zone\n   definitions.  This can significantly reduce the amount of data that\n
    \  needs to be sent between client and server, giving rise to\n   performance
    and efficiency improvements for each of them.\n"

        supporting this specification MUST have one or more\n   associated time zone
        distribution services [RFC7808] that provide\n   data for the set of time
        zones known to the server and expected to be\n   used by clients.  A CalDAV
        server advertises the set of time zone\n   distribution services it makes
        use of via a CALDAV:timezone-service-\n   set WebDAV property (see Section
        5.1) defined on calendar home\n   collections.  Clients can use the time zone
        data distribution\n   services listed in this property to fetch current time
        zone\n   definitions for the time zone identifiers in iCalendar data retrieved\n
        \  from the server.  This allows clients to keep their \"built-in\" time\n
        \  zone definitions up to date.  It also allows clients to use an \"on-\n
        \  demand\" model for populating their local time zone definition cache,\n
        \  only fetching a time zone definition when it is first seen in\n   calendar
        data, potentially allowing for savings on storage space by\n   eliminating
        the need to store time zone data that is not currently\n   being used.\n   When
        making use of the time zone data distribution services\n   advertised by a
        CalDAV server, clients MUST follow all the\n   requirements of the time zone
        data distribution service protocol\n   [RFC7808], taking care to refresh time
        zone data in a timely fashion.\n"
      title: 3.1.2.  Associated Time Zone Data Distribution Service
    - contents:
      - "3.1.3.  Time Zones in CalDAV Responses\n   Servers MUST support the HTTP
        \"CalDAV-Timezones\" request header field\n   (see Section 7.1).  If the \"CalDAV-Timezones\"
        request header field\n   has the value \"T\" on any HTTP request that returns
        iCalendar data,\n   then the server MUST include all the appropriate \"VTIMEZONE\"\n
        \  components in the iCalendar data (all the ones that are referenced by\n
        \  \"TZID\" property parameters).  If the \"CalDAV-Timezones\" request\n   header
        field has the value \"F\" on any HTTP request that returns\n   iCalendar data,
        then the server MUST NOT return any \"VTIMEZONE\"\n   components if the time
        zone identifier matches one provided by any of\n   the advertised time zone
        distribution servers (see Section 3.1.2).\n   However, the server MUST return
        the appropriate \"VTIMEZONE\" component\n   for each time zone with an identifier
        not available on the advertised\n   time zone distribution servers.  This
        behavior applies to all HTTP\n   requests on CalDAV resources that return
        iCalendar data either\n   directly (such as a \"GET\" request on a calendar
        object resource), or\n   embedded in a \"structured\" response such as a DAV:multistatus\n
        \  returned by a \"REPORT\" or \"PROPFIND\" request.\n   Observation and experiments
        have shown that, in the vast majority of\n   cases, CalDAV clients have typically
        ignored time zone definitions in\n   data received from servers, and instead
        make use of their own \"built-\n   in\" definitions for the corresponding
        time zone identifier.  This\n   means that it is reasonable for CalDAV servers
        to unilaterally decide\n   not to send \"VTIMEZONE\" components for standard
        time zones that\n   clients are expected to have \"built-in\" (i.e., IANA
        time zones).\n   Thus, in the absence of a \"CalDAV-Timezones\" request header
        field,\n   servers advertising the \"calendar-no-timezone\" capability MAY
        opt to\n   not send standard \"VTIMEZONE\" components.  Servers that do that
        will\n   need to provide an administrator configuration setting to override\n
        \  the new default behavior based on client \"User-Agent\" request header\n
        \  field values, or other suitable means of identifying the client\n   software
        in use.\n"

        time zone definitions to clients\n   in iCalendar data, this specification
        also allows clients to not\n   include time zone definitions when sending
        iCalendar data to the\n   server, as per Section 4.  This behavior applies
        to all HTTP requests\n   on CalDAV resources that include iCalendar data either
        directly in\n   the request body (such as a \"PUT\" request on a calendar
        object\n   resource) or embedded in a \"structured\" request body such as
        a one\n   used by a \"PROPPATCH\" request.\n   Note that, as per Section 4,
        clients might send time zone definitions\n   for time zones that are not advertised
        by any of the time zone\n   services associated with the server.  In that
        case, servers have\n   various choices:\n   1.  Servers can preserve the original
        time zone definitions in the\n       iCalendar data sent by the client, so
        that those can be returned\n       to that client or other clients who subsequently
        request\n       iCalendar data.\n   2.  Servers can refuse to accept any unknown/nonstandard
        time zones\n       -- in which case, they MUST reject the HTTP request containing\n
        \      such data using a WebDAV precondition code of\n       CALDAV:valid-timezone.\n
        \  3.  Servers can, with appropriate knowledge, map the unknown/\n       nonstandard
        time zone to a standard time zone definition that\n       accurately matches
        the one supplied by the client.  In doing so,\n       servers will need to
        rewrite the iCalendar data to make use of\n       the new standard time zone
        identifier chosen by the mapping\n       procedure.  Any subsequent request
        to fetch the calendar data\n       would see the new time zone identifier
        in the calendar data.\n       Note there is one important situation where
        this remapping is not\n       appropriate: an attendee's copy of an event.
        \ In that case, the\n       original time zone definition needs to be preserved
        as the\n       organizer's calendar user agent will expect to see that in
        any\n       iTIP [RFC5546] replies sent by the attendee.\n"

        defines a CALDAV:calendar-timezone WebDAV property that is\n   used by clients
        to set a default time zone for the server to use when\n   doing time-based
        queries on calendar data (see Section 5.3.2 of\n   [RFC4791]).  The content
        of that WebDAV property is an iCalendar\n   \"VTIMEZONE\" component.  This
        specification defines a new\n   CALDAV:calendar-timezone-id WebDAV property
        that allows the default\n   time zone to be set via its time zone identifier,
        rather than\n   providing the full \"VTIMEZONE\" component (see Section 5.2).
        \ This\n   WebDAV property MUST be present on all resources that also support\n
        \  the CALDAV:calendar-timezone WebDAV property.  Its value MUST match\n   the
        value of the \"TZID\" iCalendar property in the \"VTIMEZONE\"\n   component
        in the CALDAV:calendar-timezone WebDAV property on the same\n   resource.
        \ The server MUST accept clients that set either the\n   CALDAV:calendar-timezone
        or the CALDAV:calendar-timezone-id, and it\n   MUST adjust the value of the
        alternate property to reflect any\n   changes.  That is, if a client sets
        the CALDAV:calendar-timezone-id\n   WebDAV property value to \"America/New_York\",
        then the server will\n   return the full \"VTIMEZONE\" data for that time

        attempts to update the CALDAV:calendar-timezone-id with a\n   value that does

    service\n   [RFC7808] servers into the overall calendaring and scheduling client/\n
    \  server architecture, as a critical component, and thus adds a new\n   vector
    of attack against such systems.  As such, administrators of\n   CalDAV servers
    SHOULD ensure that any advertised time zone\n   distribution servers are protected
    by a level of security\n   commensurate with all the other components in the system.\n
    \  Besides the above point, this specification does not introduce any\n   new
    security concerns beyond those addressed in CalDAV [RFC4791],\n   iCalendar [RFC5545],
    and the time zone data distribution service\n   [RFC7808].\n"

    time zone data\n   distribution service specification [RFC7808] SHOULD be used
    to ensure\n   that details of clients' interactions with CalDAV servers are not\n
    \  exposed to potential network observers.  Note that since events can\n   be
    delivered to a calendar user from an outside source (e.g., using\n   iTIP [RFC5546]),
    and an attacker could create a calendar event with,\n   e.g., a time zone identifier
    that is fake or rarely used and that\n   could be used to monitor the calendar
    user's activity and interaction\n   with others, this specification increases
    the importance of using the\n   mitigations of privacy issues discussed in [RFC7808].\n"
