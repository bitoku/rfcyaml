- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Peering at the session level represents an agreement between\
    \ parties\n   to exchange multimedia traffic.  In this document, we assume that\
    \ the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used to establish sessions\n  \
    \ between SIP Service Providers (SSPs).  SIP Service Providers are\n   referred\
    \ to as peers, and they are typically represented by users,\n   user groups, enterprises,\
    \ real-time collaboration service\n   communities, or other service providers\
    \ offering voice or multimedia\n   services using SIP.\n   A number of documents\
    \ have been developed to provide background\n   information about SIP session\
    \ peering.  It is expected that the\n   reader is familiar with the reference\
    \ architecture described in\n   [ARCHITECTURE], use cases for voice ([VOIP]),\
    \ and instant messaging\n   and presence ([RFC5344]).\n   Peering at the session\
    \ layer can be achieved on a bilateral basis\n   (direct peering established directly\
    \ between two SSPs), or on an\n   indirect basis via a session intermediary (indirect\
    \ peering via a\n   third-party SSP that has a trust relationship with the SSPs)\
    \ -- see\n   the terminology document [RFC5486] for more details.\n   This document\
    \ first describes general requirements.  The use cases\n   are then analyzed in\
    \ the spirit of extracting relevant protocol\n   requirements that must be met\
    \ to accomplish the use cases.  These\n   requirements are intended to be independent\
    \ of the type of media\n   exchanged such as Voice over IP (VoIP), video telephony,\
    \ and instant\n   messaging (IM).  Requirements specific to presence and instant\n\
    \   messaging are defined in Section 4.\n   It is not the goal of this document\
    \ to mandate any particular use of\n   IETF protocols other than SIP by SIP Service\
    \ Providers in order to\n   establish session peering.  Instead, the document\
    \ highlights what\n   requirements should be met and what protocols might be used\
    \ to define\n   the solution space.\n   Finally, we conclude with a list of parameters\
    \ for the definition of\n   a session peering policy, provided in an informative\
    \ appendix.  It\n   should be considered as an example of the information SIP\
    \ Service\n   Providers may have to discuss or agree on to exchange SIP traffic.\n"

    \   This document also reuses the terminology defined in [RFC5486].\n   It is\
    \ assumed that the reader is familiar with the Session\n   Description Protocol\
    \ (SDP) [RFC4566] and the Session Initiation\n   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].  Finally,\
    \ when used with capital letters,\n   the term 'Authentication Service' is to\

- title: 3.  General Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  General Requirements\n   The following sub-sections contain general requirements\
    \ applicable to\n   multiple use cases for multimedia session peering.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Scope\n   The primary focus of this document is on the requirements applicable\n\
    \   to the boundaries of Layer 5 SIP networks: SIP entities, signaling\n   path\
    \ border elements (SBEs), and the associated protocol requirements\n   for the\
    \ look-up and location routing of the session establishment\n   data.  The requirements\
    \ applicable to SIP User Agents or related to\n   the provisioning of the session\
    \ data are considered out of scope.\n   SIP Service Providers have to reach an\
    \ agreement on numerous points\n   when establishing session peering relationships.\n\
    \   This document highlights only certain aspects of a session peering\n   agreement.\
    \  It describes the requirements relevant to protocols in\n   four areas: the\
    \ declaration, advertisement and management of ingress\n   and egress border elements\
    \ for session signaling and media\n   (Section 3.2), the information exchange\
    \ related to the Session\n   Establishment Data (SED, Section 3.3), specific requirements\
    \ for\n   presence and instant message (Section 4), and the security properties\n\
    \   that may be desirable to secure session exchanges (Section 5).\n   Numerous\
    \ other considerations of session peering arrangements are\n   critical to reach\
    \ a successful agreement, but they are considered out\n   of scope of this document.\
    \  They include information about SIP\n   protocol support (e.g., SIP extensions\
    \ and field conventions), media\n   (e.g., type of media traffic to be exchanged,\
    \ compatible media codecs\n   and transport protocols, mechanisms to ensure differentiated\
    \ quality\n   of service for media), Layer 3 IP connectivity between the signaling\n\
    \   and data path border elements, and accounting and traffic capacity\n   control\
    \ (e.g., the maximum number of SIP sessions at each ingress\n   point, or the\
    \ maximum number of concurrent IM or VoIP sessions).\n   The informative Appendix\
    \ A lists parameters that may be considered\n   when discussing the technical\
    \ parameters of SIP session peering.  The\n   purpose of this list is to capture\
    \ the parameters that are considered\n   outside the scope of the protocol requirements.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Border Elements
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Border Elements\n   For border elements to be operationally manageable,\
    \ maximum\n   flexibility should be given for how they are declared or dynamically\n\
    \   advertised.  Indeed, in any session peering environment, there is a\n   need\
    \ for a SIP Service Provider to declare or dynamically advertise\n   the SIP entities\
    \ that will face the peer's network.  The data path\n   border elements are typically\
    \ signaled dynamically in the session\n   description.\n   The use cases defined\
    \ in [VOIP] catalog the various border elements\n   between SIP Service Providers;\
    \ they include signaling path border\n   elements (SBEs) and SIP proxies (or any\
    \ SIP entity at the boundary of\n   the Layer 5 network).\n   o  Requirement #1:\n\
    \      Protocol mechanisms MUST be provided to enable a SIP Service\n      Provider\
    \ to communicate the ingress signaling path border elements\n      of its service\
    \ domain.\n      Notes on solution space:\n      The SBEs may be advertised to\
    \ session peers using static\n      mechanisms, or they may be dynamically advertised.\
    \  There is\n      general agreement that [RFC3263] provides a solution for\n\
    \      dynamically advertising ingress SBEs in most cases of direct or\n     \
    \ indirect peering.  We discuss the DNS-based solution space further\n      in\
    \ Requirement #4 below, especially in cases where the DNS\n      response varies\
    \ based on who sends the query (peer-dependent\n      SBEs).\n   o  Requirement\
    \ #2:\n      Protocol mechanisms MUST be provided to enable a SIP Service\n  \
    \    Provider to communicate the egress SBEs of its service domain.\n      Notes\
    \ on motivations for this requirement:\n      For the purposes of capacity planning,\
    \ traffic engineering, and\n      call admission control, a SIP Service Provider\
    \ may be asked from\n      where it will generate SIP calls.  The SSP accepting\
    \ calls from a\n      peer may wish to know from where SIP calls will originate\
    \ (this\n      information is typically used by the terminating SSP).\n      While\
    \ provisioning requirements are out of scope, some SSPs may\n      find use for\
    \ a mechanism to dynamically advertise or discover the\n      egress SBEs of a\
    \ peer.\n   If the SSP also provides media streams to its users as shown in the\n\
    \   use cases for \"originating\" and \"terminating\" SSPs, a mechanism must\n\
    \   exist to allow SSPs to advertise their egress and ingress data path\n   border\
    \ elements (DBEs), if applicable.  While some SSPs may have open\n   policies\
    \ and accept media traffic from anywhere outside their network\n   to anywhere\
    \ inside their network, some SSPs may want to optimize\n   media delivery and\
    \ identify media paths between peers prior to\n   traffic being sent (Layer 5\
    \ to Layer 3 Quality of Service (QoS)\n   mapping).\n   o  Requirement #3:\n \
    \     Protocol mechanisms MUST be provided to allow a SIP Service\n      Provider\
    \ to communicate its DBEs to its peers.\n      Notes: Some SSPs engaged in SIP\
    \ interconnects do exchange this\n      type of DBE information in a static manner.\
    \  Some SSPs do not.\n   In some SIP networks, SSPs may expose the same border\
    \ elements to all\n   peers.  In other environments, it is common for SSPs to\
    \ advertise\n   specific SBEs and DBEs to certain peers.  This is done by SSPs\
    \ to\n   meet specific objectives for a given peer: routing optimization of\n\
    \   the signaling and media exchanges, optimization of the latency or\n   throughput\
    \ based on the 'best' SBE and DBE combination, and other\n   service provider\
    \ policy parameters.  These are some of the reasons\n   why advertisement of SBEs\
    \ and DBEs may be peer dependent.\n   o  Requirement #4:\n      The mechanisms\
    \ recommended for the declaration or advertisement of\n      SBE and DBE entities\
    \ MUST allow for peer variability.\n      Notes on solution space:\n      A simple\
    \ solution is to advertise SBE entities using DNS and\n      [RFC3263] by providing\
    \ different DNS names to different peers.\n      This approach has some practical\
    \ limitations because the SIP URIs\n      containing the DNS names used to resolve\
    \ the SBEs may be\n      propagated by users, for example, in the form of sip:user@domain.\n\
    \      It is impractical to ask users to implement different target URIs\n   \
    \   based upon their SIP Service Provider's desire to receive incoming\n     \
    \ session signaling at different ingress SBEs based upon the\n      originator.\
    \  The solution described in [RFC3263] and based on DNS\n      to advertise SBEs\
    \ is therefore under specified for this\n      requirement.\n      Other DNS mechanisms\
    \ have been used extensively in other areas of\n      the Internet, in particular\
    \ in Content Distribution\n      Internetworking to make the DNS responses vary\
    \ based on the\n      originator of the DNS query (see [RFC3466], [RFC3568], and\n\
    \      [RFC3570]).  The applicability of such solutions for session\n      peering\
    \ needs further analysis.\n      Finally, other techniques such as Anycast services\
    \ ([RFC4786]) may\n      be employed at lower layers than Layer 5 to provide a\
    \ solution to\n      this requirement.  For example, anycast nodes could be defined\
    \ by\n      SIP service providers to expose a common address for SBEs into\n \
    \     DNS, allowing the resolution of the anycast node address to the\n      appropriate\
    \ peer-dependent service address based on the routing\n      topology or other\
    \ criteria gathered from the combined use of\n      anycast and DNS techniques.\n\
    \      Notes on variability of the SBE advertisements based on the media\n   \
    \   capabilities:\n      Some SSPs may have some restrictions on the type of media\
    \ traffic\n      their SBEs can accept.  For SIP sessions however, it is not\n\
    \      possible to communicate those restrictions in advance of the\n      session\
    \ initiation: a SIP target may support voice-only media,\n      voice and video,\
    \ or voice and instant messaging communications.\n      While the inability to\
    \ find out whether a particular type of SIP\n      session can be terminated by\
    \ a certain SBE can cause session\n      attempts to fail, there is consensus\
    \ to not add a new requirement\n      in this document.  These aspects are essentially\
    \ covered by SSPs\n      when discussing traffic exchange policies and are deemed\
    \ out of\n      scope of this document.\n   In the use cases provided as part\
    \ of direct and indirect peering\n   scenarios, an SSP deals with multiple SIP\
    \ entities and multiple SBEs\n   in its own domain.  There is often a many-to-many\
    \ relationship\n   between the SIP proxies considered inside the trusted network\n\
    \   boundary of the SSP and its signaling path border elements at the\n   network\
    \ boundaries.\n   It should be possible for an SSP to define which egress SBE\
    \ a SIP\n   entity must use based on a given peer destination.\n   For example,\
    \ in the case of a static direct peering scenario (Figure\n   2 in Section 5.2.\
    \ of [VOIP]), it should be possible for the SIP proxy\n   in the originating network\
    \ (O-Proxy) to select the appropriate egress\n   SBE (O-SBE) to reach the SIP\
    \ target based on the information the\n   proxy receives from the Look-Up Function\
    \ (O-LUF), and/or Location\n   Routing Function (O-LRF) -- message response labeled\
    \ (2).  Note that\n   this example also applies to the case of indirect peering\
    \ when a\n   service provider has multiple service areas and each service area\n\
    \   involves multiple SIP proxies and a few SBEs.\n   o  Requirement #5:\n   \
    \   The mechanisms recommended for the Look-Up Function (LUF) and the\n      Location\
    \ Routing Functions (LRF) MUST be capable of returning both\n      a target URI\
    \ destination and a value providing the next SIP\n      hop(s).\n      Notes:\
    \ solutions may exist depending on the choice of the protocol\n      used between\
    \ the Proxy and its LUF/LRF.  The idea is for the\n      O-Proxy to be provided\
    \ with the next SIP hop and the equivalent of\n      one or more SIP Route header\
    \ values.  If ENUM is used as a\n      protocol for the LUF, the solution space\
    \ is undefined.\n   It is desirable for an SSP to be able to communicate how\n\
    \   authentication of a peer's SBEs will occur (see the security\n   requirements\
    \ for more details).\n   o  Requirement #6:\n      The mechanisms recommended\
    \ for locating a peer's SBE MUST be able\n      to convey how a peer should initiate\
    \ secure session establishment.\n      Notes: some mechanisms exist.  For example,\
    \ the required use of\n      SIP over TLS may be discovered via [RFC3263], and\
    \ guidelines\n      concerning the use of the SIPS URI scheme in SIP have been\n\
    \      documented in [RFC5630].\n"
- title: 3.3.  Session Establishment Data
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Session Establishment Data\n   The Session Establishment Data (SED) is\
    \ defined in [RFC5486] as the\n   data used to route a call to the next hop associated\
    \ with the called\n   domain's ingress point.  The following paragraphs capture\
    \ some\n   general requirements on the SED data.\n"
- title: 3.3.1.  User Identities and SIP URIs
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  User Identities and SIP URIs\n   User identities used between peers can\
    \ be represented in many\n   different formats.  Session Establishment Data should\
    \ rely on URIs\n   (Uniform Resource Identifiers, [RFC3986]) and SIP URIs should\
    \ be\n   preferred over tel URIs ([RFC3966]) for session peering of VoIP\n   traffic.\n\
    \   The use of DNS domain names and hostnames is recommended in SIP URIs\n   and\
    \ they should be resolvable on the public Internet.  As for the\n   user part\
    \ of the SIP URIs, the mechanisms for session peering should\n   not require an\
    \ SSP to be aware of which individual user identities\n   are valid within its\
    \ peer's domain.\n   o  Requirement #7:\n      The protocols used for session\
    \ peering MUST accommodate the use of\n      different types of URIs.  URIs with\
    \ the same domain-part SHOULD\n      share the same set of peering policies; thus,\
    \ the domain of the\n      SIP URI may be used as the primary key to any information\n\
    \      regarding the reachability of that SIP URI.  The host part of SIP\n   \
    \   URIs SHOULD contain a fully qualified domain name instead of a\n      numeric\
    \ IPv4 or IPv6 address.\n   o  Requirement #8:\n      The mechanisms for session\
    \ peering should not require an SSP to be\n      aware of which individual user\
    \ identities are valid within its\n      peer's domain.\n   o  Notes on the solution\
    \ space for Requirements #7 and #8:\n      This is generally well supported by\
    \ IETF protocols.  When\n      telephone numbers are in tel URIs, SIP requests\
    \ cannot be routed\n      in accordance with the traditional DNS resolution procedures\n\
    \      standardized for SIP as indicated in [RFC3824].  This means that\n    \
    \  the solutions built for session peering must not solely use Public\n      Switched\
    \ Telephone Network (PSTN) identifiers such as Service\n      Provider IDs (SPIDs)\
    \ or Trunk Group IDs (they should not be\n      precluded but solutions should\
    \ not be limited to these).\n      Motivations:\n      Although SED data may be\
    \ based on E.164-based SIP URIs for voice\n      interconnects, a generic peering\
    \ methodology should not rely on\n      such E.164 numbers.\n"
- title: 3.3.2.  URI Reachability
  contents:
  - "3.3.2.  URI Reachability\n   Based on a well-known URI type (e.g., sip:, pres:,\
    \ or im: URIs), it\n   must be possible to determine whether the SSP domain servicing\
    \ the\n   URI allows for session peering, and if it does, it should be possible\n\
    \   to locate and retrieve the domain's policy and SBE entities.\n   For example,\
    \ an originating service provider must be able to\n   determine whether a SIP\
    \ URI is open for direct interconnection\n   without requiring an SBE to initiate\
    \ a SIP request.  Furthermore,\n   since each call setup implies the execution\
    \ of any proposed\n   algorithm, the establishment of a SIP session via peering\
    \ should\n   incur minimal overhead and delay, and employ caching wherever\n \
    \  possible to avoid extra protocol round trips.\n   o  Requirement #9:\n    \
    \  The mechanisms for session peering MUST allow an SBE to locate its\n      peer\
    \ SBE given a URI type and the target SSP domain name.\n"

    \ the exchange of messages and privacy settings, and the\n   use of standard presence\

    \ per\n      presentity are typically not shared across SSPs causing multiple\n\
    \      notifications to be sent for one presentity change between SSPs.\n    \
    \  The sharing of those privacy settings per presentity between SSPs\n      would\
    \ allow fewer notifications: a single notification would be\n      sent per presentity\
    \ and the terminating SSP would send\n      notifications to the appropriate watchers\
    \ according to the\n      presentity's privacy information.\n      The mechanisms\
    \ recommended for presence information exchanges\n      between SSPs SHOULD allow\
    \ the sharing of some user privacy\n      settings in order for users to convey\
    \ the list of watchers that\n      can receive notification of presence information\
    \ changes on a per-\n      presentity basis.\n      The privacy sharing mechanism\
    \ must be done with the express\n      consent of the user whose privacy settings\
    \ will be shared with the\n      other community.  Because of the privacy-sensitive\
    \ information\n      exchanged between SSPs, the protocols used for the exchange\
    \ of\n      presence information must follow the security recommendations\n  \
    \    defined in Section 6 of [RFC3863].\n      Notes: see Section 2.3 of [RFC5344].\n\
    \   o  Requirement #13:\n      It should be possible for an SSP to associate a\
    \ presence document\n      with a list of watchers in the peer SSP community so\
    \ that the peer\n      watchers can receive the presence document notifications.\
    \  This\n      will enable sending less presence document notifications between\n\
    \      the communities while avoiding the need to share privacy\n      information\
    \ of presentities from one community to the other.\n      The systems used to\
    \ exchange presence documents between SSPs\n      SHOULD allow a presence document\
    \ to be delivered to one or more\n      watchers.\n      Note: The presence document\
    \ and the list of authorized watchers in\n      the peer SSP may be sent separately.\
    \  Also, the privacy-sharing\n      mechanisms defined in Requirement #12 also\
    \ apply to this\n      requirement.\n   o  Requirement #14:\n      Early deployments\
    \ of SIP-based presence and instant messaging\n      gateways have been done in\
    \ front of legacy proprietary systems\n      that use different naming schemes\
    \ or name values for the elements\n      and properties defined in a Presence\
    \ Information Data Format\n      (PIDF) document ([RFC3863]).  For example, the\
    \ value \"Do Not\n      Disturb\" in one presence service may be mapped to \"\
    Busy\" in\n      another system for the status element.  Beyond this example of\n\
    \      status values, it is important to ensure that the meaning of the\n    \
    \  presence information is preserved between SSPs.\n      The systems used to\
    \ exchange presence documents between SSPs\n      SHOULD use standard PIDF documents\
    \ and translate any non-standard\n      value of a PIDF element to a standard\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This section describes the security properties\
    \ that are desirable for\n   the protocol exchanges in scope of session peering.\
    \  Three types of\n   information flows are described in the architecture and\
    \ use case\n   documents: the acquisition of the Session Establishment Data (SED)\n\
    \   based on a destination target via the Look-Up and Location Routing\n   Functions\
    \ (LUF and LRF), the SIP signaling between SIP Service\n   Providers, and the\
    \ associated media exchanges.\n   This section is focused on three security services:\
    \ authentication,\n   data confidentiality, and data integrity as summarized in\
    \ [RFC3365].\n   However, this text does not specify the mandatory-to-implement\n\
    \   security mechanisms as required by [RFC3365]; this is left for future\n  \
    \ protocol solutions that meet the requirements.\n   A security threat analysis\
    \ provides additional guidance for session\n   peering ([VOIPTHREATS]).\n"

    \  Data\n   The Look-Up Function (LUF) and Location Routing Function (LRF) are\n\
    \   defined in [RFC5486].  They provide mechanisms for determining the\n   SIP\
    \ target address and domain the request should be sent to, and the\n   associated\
    \ SED to route the request to that domain.\n   o  Requirement #15:\n      The\
    \ protocols used to query the Look-Up and Location Routing\n      Functions SHOULD\
    \ support mutual authentication.\n      Motivations:\n      A mutual authentication\
    \ service should be provided for the LUF and\n      LRF protocol exchanges.  The\
    \ content of the response returned by\n      the LUF and LRF may depend on the\
    \ identity of the requestor: the\n      authentication of the LUF and LRF requests\
    \ is therefore a\n      desirable property.  Mutual authentication is also desirable:\
    \ the\n      requestor may verify the identity of the systems that provided the\n\
    \      LUF and LRF responses given the nature of the data returned in\n      those\
    \ responses.  Authentication also provides some protection for\n      the availability\
    \ of the LUF and LRF against attackers that would\n      attempt to launch Denial-of-Service\
    \ (DoS) attacks by sending bogus\n      requests causing the LUF to perform a\
    \ lookup and consume\n      resources.\n   o  Requirement #16:\n      The protocols\
    \ used to query the Look-Up and Location Routing\n      Functions SHOULD provide\
    \ support for data confidentiality and\n      integrity.\n      Motivations:\n\
    \      Given the sensitive nature of the session establishment data\n      exchanged\
    \ with the LUF and LRF functions, the protocol mechanisms\n      chosen for the\
    \ look-up and location routing should offer data\n      confidentiality and integrity\
    \ protection (SED data may contain\n      user addresses, SIP URI, location of\
    \ SIP entities at the\n      boundaries of SIP Service Provider domains, etc.).\n\
    \   o  Notes on the solution space for Requirements #15 and #16:\n      ENUM,\
    \ SIP, and proprietary protocols are typically used today for\n      accessing\
    \ these functions.  Even though SSPs may use lower-layer\n      security mechanisms\
    \ to guarantee some of those security\n      properties, candidate protocols for\
    \ the LUF and LRF should meet\n      the above requirements.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.2.  Security Properties for the SIP Signaling Exchanges\n   The SIP signaling\

    \ between SSPs without formulating\n   any normative requirements.\n   In general,\
    \ the security properties desirable for the SIP exchanges\n   in an inter-domain\
    \ context apply to session peering.  These include:\n   o  securing the transport\
    \ of SIP messages between the peers' SBEs.\n      Authentication of SIP communications\
    \ is desirable, especially in\n      the context of session peering involving\
    \ SIP intermediaries.  Data\n      confidentiality and integrity of the SIP message\
    \ body may be\n      desirable as well given some of the levels of session peering\n\
    \      indirection (indirect/assisted peering), but they could be harmful\n  \
    \    as they may prevent intermediary SSPs from \"inserting\" SBEs/DBEs\n    \
    \  along the signaling and data paths.\n   o  providing an Authentication Service\
    \ to authenticate the identity\n      of connected users based on the SIP Service\

- title: 5.3.  End-to-End Media Security
  contents:
  - "5.3.  End-to-End Media Security\n   Media security is critical to guarantee end-to-end\
    \ confidentiality of\n   the communication between the end-users' devices, independently\
    \ of\n   how many direct or indirect peers are present along the signaling\n \
    \  path.  A number of desirable security properties emerge from this\n   goal.\n\
    \   The establishment of media security may be achieved along the media\n   path\
    \ and not over the signaling path given the indirect peering use\n   cases.\n\
    \   For example, media carried over the Real-Time Protocol (RTP) can be\n   secured\
    \ using secure RTP (SRTP [RFC3711]).  A framework for\n   establishing SRTP security\
    \ using Datagram TLS (DTLS) [RFC4347] is\n   described in [RFC5763]: it allows\
    \ for end-to-end media security\n   establishment using extensions to DTLS ([RFC5764]).\n\
    \   It should also be noted that media can be carried in numerous\n   protocols\
    \ other than RTP such as SIP (SIP MESSAGE method), MSRP (the\n   Message Session\
    \ Relay Protocol, [RFC4975], XMPP (the Extensible\n   Messaging and Presence Protocol,\
    \ [RFC6120]), and many others.  Media\n   may also be carried over TCP ([RFC4571]),\
    \ and it can be encrypted\n   over secure connection-oriented transport sessions\
    \ over TLS\n   ([RFC4572]).\n   A desirable security property for session peering\
    \ is for SIP entities\n   to be transparent to the end-to-end media security negotiations:\
    \ SIP\n   entities should not intervene in the Session Description Protocol\n\
    \   (SDP) exchanges for end-to-end media security.\n   o  Requirement #17:\n \
    \     The protocols used to enable session peering MUST NOT interfere\n      with\
    \ the exchanges of media security attributes in SDP.  Media\n      attribute lines\
    \ that are not understood by SBEs MUST be ignored\n      and passed along the\
    \ signaling path untouched.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Policy Parameters for Session Peering
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Policy Parameters for Session Peering\n   This informative appendix\
    \ lists various types of parameters that\n   should be considered by implementers\
    \ when deciding what configuration\n   variables to expose to system administrators\
    \ or management stations,\n   as well as SSPs or federations of SSPs when discussing\
    \ the technical\n   part of a session peering policy.\n   In the context of session\
    \ peering, a policy can be defined as the set\n   of parameters and other information\
    \ needed by an SSP to exchange\n   traffic with another peer.  Some of the session\
    \ policy parameters may\n   be statically exchanged and set throughout the lifetime\
    \ of the\n   peering relationship.  Other parameters may be discovered and updated\n\
    \   dynamically using some explicit protocol mechanisms.  These dynamic\n   parameters\
    \ may be session dependent, or they may apply over multiple\n   sessions or peers.\n\
    \   Various types of policy information may need to be discovered or\n   exchanged\
    \ in order to establish session peering.  At a minimum, a\n   policy should specify\
    \ information related to session establishment\n   data in order to avoid session\
    \ establishment failures.  A policy may\n   also include information related to\
    \ QoS, billing and accounting, and\n   Layer 3 related interconnect requirements,\
    \ which are out of the scope\n   of this document.\n   Some aspects of session\
    \ peering policies must be agreed to and\n   manually implemented; they are static\
    \ and are typically documented as\n   part of a business contract, technical document,\
    \ or agreement between\n   parties.  For some parameters linked to protocol support\
    \ and\n   capabilities, standard ways of expressing those policy parameters may\n\
    \   be defined among SSPs and exchanged dynamically.  For example,\n   templates\
    \ could be created in various document formats so that it\n   could be possible\
    \ to dynamically discover some of the domain policy.\n   Such templates could\
    \ be initiated by implementers.  For each software\n   or hardware release, the\
    \ template could list supported RFCs, and the\n   associated RFC parameters implemented\
    \ in the given release in a\n   standard format.  Each SSP would then complete\
    \ the template and adapt\n   its content based on its service description, the\
    \ deployed server or\n   device configurations and the variation of these configurations\
    \ based\n   on peer relationships.\n"

  contents:
  - "A.1.  Categories of Parameters for VoIP Session Peering and\n      Justifications\n\
    \   The following list should be considered as an initial list of\n   \"discussion\
    \ topics\" to be addressed by peers when initiating a VoIP\n   peering relationship.\n\
    \   o  IP Network Connectivity:\n      Session peers should define the IP network\
    \ connectivity between\n      their respective SBEs and DBEs.  While this is out\
    \ of scope of\n      session peering, SSPs must agree on a common mechanism for\
    \ IP\n      transport of session signaling and media.  This may be\n      accomplished\
    \ via private (e.g., IPVPN, IPsec, etc.) or public IP\n      networks.\n   o \
    \ Media-related Parameters:\n      *  Media Codecs: list of supported media codecs\
    \ for audio, real-\n         time fax (version of T.38, if applicable), real-time\
    \ text (RFC\n         4103), dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) transport voice\
    \ band\n         data communications (as applicable) along with the supported\
    \ or\n         recommended codec packetization rates, level of RTP payload\n \
    \        redundancy, audio volume levels, etc.\n      *  Media Transport: level\
    \ of support for RTP-RTCP [RFC3550], RTP\n         Redundancy (RTP Payload for\
    \ Redundant Audio Data [RFC2198]),\n         T.38 transport over RTP, etc.\n \
    \     *  Media variability at the signaling path border elements: list\n     \
    \    of media types supported by the various ingress points of a\n         peer's\
    \ network.\n      *  Other: support of the VoIP metric block as defined in RTP\n\
    \         Control Protocol Extended Reports [RFC3611], etc.\n   o  SIP:\n    \
    \  *  A session peering policy should include the list of supported\n        \
    \ and required SIP RFCs, supported and required SIP methods\n         (including\
    \ private p headers if applicable), error response\n         codes, supported\
    \ or recommended format of some header field\n         values, etc.\n      * \
    \ It should also be possible to describe the list of supported\n         SIP RFCs\
    \ by various functional groupings.  A group of SIP RFCs\n         may represent\
    \ how a call feature is implemented (call hold,\n         transfer, conferencing,\
    \ etc.), or it may indicate a functional\n         grouping as in [RFC5411].\n\
    \   o  Accounting:\n      Methods used for call or session accounting should be\
    \ specified.\n      An SSP may require a peer to track session usage.  It is critical\n\
    \      for peers to determine whether the support of any SIP extensions\n    \
    \  for accounting is a pre-requisite for SIP interoperability.  In\n      some\
    \ cases, call accounting may feed data for billing purposes,\n      but not always:\
    \ some operators may decide to use accounting as a\n      'bill and keep' model\
    \ to track session usage and monitor usage\n      against service level agreements.\n\
    \      [RFC3702] defines the terminology and basic requirements for\n      accounting\
    \ of SIP sessions.  A few private SIP extensions have\n      also been defined\
    \ and used over the years to enable call\n      accounting between SSP domains\
    \ such as the P-Charging* headers in\n      [RFC3455], the P-DCS-Billing-Info\
    \ header in [RFC5503], etc.\n   o  Performance Metrics:\n      Layer 5 performance\
    \ metrics should be defined and shared between\n      peers.  The performance\
    \ metrics apply directly to signaling or\n      media; they may be used proactively\
    \ to help avoid congestion, call\n      quality issues, or call signaling failures,\
    \ and as part of\n      monitoring techniques, they can be used to evaluate the\n\
    \      performance of peering exchanges.\n      Examples of SIP performance metrics\
    \ include the maximum number of\n      SIP transactions per second on per-domain\
    \ basis, Session\n      Completion Rate (SCR), Session Establishment Rate (SER),\
    \ etc.\n      Some SIP end-to-end performance metrics are defined in [RFC6076];\n\
    \      a subset of these may be applicable to session peering and\n      interconnects.\n\
    \      Some media-related metrics for monitoring VoIP calls have been\n      defined\
    \ in the VoIP Metrics Report Block, in Section 4.7 of\n      [RFC3611].\n   o\
    \  Security:\n      An SSP should describe the security requirements that other\
    \ peers\n      must meet in order to terminate calls to its network.  While such\n\
    \      a list of security-related policy parameters often depends on the\n   \
    \   security models pre-agreed to by peers, it is expected that these\n      parameters\
    \ will be discoverable or signaled in the future to allow\n      session peering\
    \ outside SSP clubs.  The list of security\n      parameters may be long and composed\
    \ of high-level requirements\n      (e.g., authentication, privacy, secure transport)\
    \ and low-level\n      protocol configuration elements like TLS parameters.\n\
    \      The following list is not intended to be complete, it provides a\n    \
    \  preliminary list in the form of examples:\n      *  Call admission requirements:\
    \ for some providers, sessions can\n         only be admitted if certain criteria\
    \ are met.  For example, for\n         some providers' networks, only incoming\
    \ SIP sessions signaled\n         over established IPsec tunnels or presented\
    \ to the well-known\n         TLS ports are admitted.  Other call admission requirements\
    \ may\n         be related to some performance metrics as described above.\n \
    \        Finally, it is possible that some requirements be imposed on\n      \
    \   lower layers, but these are considered out of scope of session\n         peering.\n\
    \      *  Call authorization requirements and validation: the presence of\n  \
    \       a caller or user identity may be required by an SSP.  Indeed,\n      \
    \   some SSPs may further authorize an incoming session request by\n         validating\
    \ the caller's identity against white/black lists\n         maintained by the\
    \ service provider or users (traditional caller\n         ID screening applications\
    \ or IM white lists).\n      *  Privacy requirements: an SSP may demand that its\
    \ SIP messages\n         be securely transported by its peers for privacy reasons\
    \ so\n         that the calling/called party information be protected.  Media\n\
    \         sessions may also require privacy, and some SSP policies may\n     \
    \    include requirements on the use of secure media transport\n         protocols\
    \ such as SRTP, along with some constraints on the\n         minimum authentication/encryption\
    \ options for use in SRTP.\n      *  Network-layer security parameters: this covers\
    \ how IPsec\n         security associations may be established, the IPsec key\n\
    \         exchange mechanisms should be used, and any details on keying\n    \
    \     materials, the lifetime of timed security associations if\n         applicable,\
    \ etc.\n      *  Transport-layer security parameters: this covers how TLS\n  \
    \       connections should be established, as described in Section 5.\n"
