  - "1.  Introduction\n   Proper operation of a transport network depends on the ability
    to\n   quickly identify faults and focus attention on the root cause of the\n
    \  disruption.  This document defines MPLS Fault Management Operations,\n   Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) messages.  When a fault occurs\n   in a server (sub-)layer,
    Fault Management OAM messages are sent to\n   clients of that server so that alarms,
    which otherwise would be\n   generated by the subsequent disruption of the clients,
    may be\n   suppressed.  This prevents a storm of alarms and allows operations
    to\n   focus on the actual faulty elements of the network.\n   In traditional
    transport networks, circuits such as T1 lines are\n   typically provisioned on
    multiple switches.  When an event that\n   causes disruption occurs on any link
    or node along the path of such a\n   transport circuit, OAM indications are generated.
    \ When received,\n   these indications may be used to suppress alarms and/or activate
    a\n   backup circuit.  The MPLS-based transport network provides mechanisms\n
    \  equivalent to traditional transport circuits.  Therefore, a Fault\n   Management
    (FM) capability must be defined for MPLS.  This document\n   defines FM capabilities
    to meet the MPLS-TP requirements as described\n   in RFC 5654 [1], and the MPLS-TP
    Operations, Administration, and\n   Maintenance requirements as described in RFC
    5860 [2].  These\n   mechanisms are intended to be applicable to other aspects
    of MPLS as\n   well.  However, applicability to other types of LSPs is beyond
    the\n   scope of this document.\n   Two broad classes of service disruptive conditions
    are identified.\n   1.  Fault: The inability of a function to perform a required
    action.\n       This does not include an inability due to preventive maintenance,\n
    \      lack of external resources, or planned actions.\n   2.  Lock: an administrative
    status in which it is expected that only\n       test traffic, if any, and OAM
    (dedicated to the LSP) can be sent\n       on an LSP.\n   Within this document,
    a further term is defined: server-failure.  A\n   server-failure occurs when a
    fault condition or conditions have\n   persisted long enough to consider the required
    service function of\n   the server (sub-)layer to have terminated.  In the case
    of a\n   protected server, this would mean that the working facilities and any\n
    \  protection facilities have all suffered faults of the required\n   duration.\n
    \  This document specifies an MPLS OAM channel called an \"MPLS-OAM Fault\n   Management
    (FM)\" channel.  A single message format and a set of\n   procedures are defined
    to communicate service disruptive conditions\n   from the location where they
    occur to the end points of LSPs that are\n   affected by those conditions.  Multiple
    message types and flags are\n   used to indicate and qualify the particular condition.\n
    \  Corresponding to the two classes of service disruptive conditions\n   listed
    above, two messages are defined to communicate the type of\n   condition.  These
    are known as:\n      Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)\n      Lock Report (LKR)\n"

  - "2.  MPLS Fault Management Messages\n   This document defines two messages to
    indicate service disruptive\n   conditions, Alarm Indication Signal and Lock Report.
    \ The semantics\n   of the individual messages are described in subsections below.
    \ Fault\n   OAM messages are applicable to LSPs used in the MPLS Transport\n   Profile.
    \ Such LSPs are bound to specific server layers based upon\n   static configuration
    or signaling in a client/server relationship.\n   Fault Management messages are
    carried in-band of the client LSP or\n   MS-PW by using the Associated Channel
    Header (ACH).  For LSPs other\n   than PWs, the ACH is identified by the Generic
    Associated Channel\n   Label (GAL) as defined in RFC 5586 [4].  To facilitate
    recognition\n   and delivery of Fault Management messages, the Fault Management\n
    \  Channel is identified by a unique Associated Channel (ACh) code\n   point.\n
    \  Fault OAM messages are generated by intermediate nodes where a client\n   LSP
    is switched.  When a server (sub-)layer, e.g., a link or\n   bidirectional LSP,
    used by the client LSP fails, the intermediate\n   node sends Fault Management
    messages downstream towards the end point\n   of the LSP.  The messages are sent
    to the client MEPs by inserting\n   them into the affected client LSPs in the
    direction downstream of the\n   fault location.  These messages are sent periodically
    until the\n   condition is cleared.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  MPLS Alarm Indication Signal\n   The MPLS Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)
      message is generated in\n   response to detecting faults in the server (sub-)layer.
      \ The AIS\n   message SHOULD be sent as soon as the condition is detected, but
      MAY\n   be delayed owing to processing in an implementation, and MAY be\n   suppressed
      if protection is achieved very rapidly.  For example, an\n   AIS message may
      be sent during a protection switching event and would\n   cease being sent (or
      cease being forwarded by the protection switch\n   selector) if the protection
      switch was successful in restoring the\n   link.  However, an implementation
      may instead wait to see if the\n   protection switch is successful prior to
      sending any AIS messages.\n   The primary purpose of the AIS message is to suppress
      alarms in the\n   layer network above the level at which the fault occurs.  When
      the\n   Link Down Indication is set, the AIS message can be used to trigger\n
      \  recovery mechanisms.\n"
    - contents:
      - "2.1.1.  MPLS Link Down Indication\n   The Link Down Indication (LDI) is communicated
        by setting the L-Flag\n   to 1.  A node sets the L-Flag in the AIS message
        in response to\n   detecting a failure in the server layer.  A node MUST NOT
        set the\n   L-Flag until the fault has been determined to be a server-failure.
        \ A\n   node MUST set the L-Flag if the fault has been determined to be a\n
        \  server-failure.  For example, during a server layer protection\n   switching
        event, a node MUST NOT set the L-Flag.  However, if the\n   protection switch
        was unsuccessful in restoring the link within the\n   expected repair time,
        the node MUST set the L-Flag.\n   The setting of the L-Flag can be predetermined
        based on the\n   protection state.  For example, if a server layer is protected
        and\n   both the working and protection paths are available, the node should\n
        \  send AIS with the L-Flag clear upon detecting a fault condition.  If\n
        \  the server layer is unprotected, or the server layer is protected but\n
        \  only the active path is available, the node should send AIS with the\n
        \  L-Flag set upon detecting a loss of continuity (LOC) condition.  Note\n
        \  again that the L-Flag is not set until a server-failure has been\n   declared.
        \ Thus, if there is any hold-off timer associated with the\n   LOC, then the
        L-Flag is not set until that timer has expired.\n   The receipt of an AIS
        message with the L-Flag set MAY be treated as\n   the equivalent of LOC at
        the client layer.  The choice of treatment\n   is related to the rate at which
        the Continuity Check (CC) function is\n   running.  In a normal transport
        environment, CC is run at a high rate\n   in order to detect a failure within
        tens of milliseconds.  In such an\n   environment, the L-Flag MAY be ignored
        and the AIS message is used\n   solely for alarm suppression.\n   In more
        general MPLS environments, the CC function may be running at\n   a much slower
        rate.  In this environment, the Link Down Indication\n   enables faster switch-over
        upon a failure occurring along the client\n   LSP.\n"

    - "2.2.  MPLS Lock Report\n   The MPLS Lock Report (LKR) message is generated
      when a server\n   (sub-)layer entity has been administratively locked.  Its
      purpose is\n   to communicate the locked condition to the client-layer entities.\n
      \  When a server layer is administratively locked, it is not available\n   to
      carry client traffic.  The purpose of the LKR message is to\n   suppress alarms
      in the layer network above the level at which the\n   administrative lock occurs
      and to allow the clients to differentiate\n   the lock condition from a fault
      condition.  While the primary purpose\n   of the LKR message is to suppress
      alarms, similar to AIS with the LDI\n   (L-Flag set), the receipt of an LKR
      message can be treated as the\n   equivalent of loss of continuity at the client
      layer.\n"

      layer) receives FM indications,\n   the following rules apply.  If the CC function
      is disabled for the\n   server LSP, a node SHOULD generate AIS messages toward
      any clients\n   when either the AIS or LKR indication is raised.  Note that
      the\n   L-Flag is not automatically propagated.  The rules of Section 2.1.1\n
      \  apply.  In particular, the L-Flag is not set until a server-failure\n   has

    - "5.1.  Sending a Fault Management Message\n   Service disruptive conditions
      are indicated by sending FM messages.\n   The message type is set to the value
      corresponding to the condition.\n   The Refresh Timer is set to the maximum
      time between successive FM\n   messages.  This value MUST NOT be changed on
      successive FM messages\n   reporting the same incident.  If the optional clearing
      procedures are\n   not used, then the default value is one second.  Otherwise,
      the\n   default value is 20 seconds.\n   A Global_ID MAY be included.  If the
      R-Flag clearing procedures are\n   to be used, the IF_ID TLV MUST be included.
      \ Otherwise, the IF_ID TLV\n   MAY be included.\n   The message is then sent.
      \ Assuming the condition persists, the\n   message MUST be retransmitted two
      more times at an interval of one\n   second.  Further retransmissions are made
      according to the value of\n   the Refresh Timer.  Retransmissions continue until
      the condition is\n   cleared.\n"

      node MUST cease sending the associated FM\n   messages.  Ceasing to send FM
      messages will clear the indication\n   after 3.5 times the Refresh Timer.  To
      clear an indication more\n   quickly, the following procedure is used.  The
      R-Flag of the FM\n   message is set to one.  Other fields of the FM message
      SHOULD NOT be\n   modified.  The message is sent immediately and then retransmitted
      two\n   more times at an interval of one second.  Note, however, if another\n
      \  fault occurs, the node MUST cease these retransmissions and generate\n   new
      FM messages for the new fault.\n"

    - "5.3.  Receiving a Fault Management Indication\n   When an FM message is received,
      a MEP examines it to ensure that it\n   is well formed.  If the message type
      is reserved or unknown, the\n   message is ignored.  If the version number is
      unknown, the message is\n   ignored.\n   If the R-Flag is set to zero, the MEP
      checks to see if a condition\n   matching the message type exists.  If it does
      not, the condition\n   specific to the message type is entered.  An Expiration
      timer is set\n   to 3.5 times the Refresh Timer.  If the message type matches
      an\n   existing condition, the message is considered a refresh and the\n   Expiration
      timer is reset.  In both cases, if an IF_ID TLV is\n   present, it is recorded.\n
      \  If the R-Flag is set to one, the MEP checks to see if a condition\n   matching
      the message type and IF_ID exists.  If it does, that\n   condition is cleared.
      \ Otherwise, the message is ignored.\n   If the Expiration timer expires, the
      condition is cleared.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   MPLS-TP is a subset of MPLS and so builds upon
    many of the aspects of\n   the security model of MPLS.  MPLS networks make the
    assumption that\n   it is very hard to inject traffic into a network, and equally
    hard to\n   cause traffic to be directed outside the network.  The control-plane\n
    \  protocols utilize hop-by-hop security and assume a \"chain-of-trust\"\n   model
    such that end-to-end control-plane security is not used.  For\n   more information
    on the generic aspects of MPLS security, see RFC\n   5920 [8].\n   This document
    describes a protocol carried in the G-ACh (RFC 5586\n   [4]) and so is dependent
    on the security of the G-ACh itself.  The\n   G-ACh is a generalization of the
    Associated Channel defined in RFC\n   4385 [6].  Thus, this document relies heavily
    on the security\n   mechanisms provided for the Associated Channel as described
    in those\n   two documents.\n   A specific concern for the G-ACh is that is can
    be used to provide a\n   covert channel.  This problem is wider than the scope
    of this\n   document and does not need to be addressed here, but it should be\n
    \  noted that the channel provides end-to-end connectivity and SHOULD\n   NOT
    be policed by transit nodes.  Thus, there is no simple way of\n   preventing any
    traffic being carried in the G-ACh between consenting\n   nodes.\n   A good discussion
    of the data-plane security of an Associated Channel\n   may be found in RFC 5085
    [9].  That document also describes some\n   mitigation techniques.\n   It should
    be noted that the G-ACh is essentially connection-oriented,\n   so injection or
    modification of control messages specified in this\n   document requires the subversion
    of a transit node.  Such subversion\n   is generally considered hard to protect
    against in MPLS networks, and\n   impossible to protect against at the protocol
    level.  Management-\n   level techniques are more appropriate.\n   Spurious fault
    OAM messages form a vector for a denial-of-service\n   attack.  However, since
    these messages are carried in a control\n   channel, except for one case discussed
    below, one would have to gain\n   access to a node providing the service in order
    to effect such an\n   attack.  Since transport networks are usually operated as
    a walled\n   garden, such threats are less likely.\n   If external MPLS traffic
    is mapped to an LSP via a PHP forwarding\n   operation, it is possible to insert
    a GAL followed by a fault OAM\n   message.  In such a situation, an operator SHOULD
    protect against\n   this attack by filtering any fault OAM messages with the GAL
    at the\n   top of the label stack.\n"
