  - "1. Introduction\n   The IETF has started several activities in the operations\
    \ and\n   management area to develop technologies and standards that aim to\n\
    \   help network operators manage their networks.  The main network\n   management\
    \ technologies currently being developed within the IETF\n   are:\n   o  The Simple\
    \ Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3410] was\n      created in the late\
    \ 1980s.  The initial version (SNMPv1) is widely\n      deployed, while the latest\
    \ version (SNMPv3), which addresses\n      security requirements, is just beginning\
    \ to gain significant\n      deployment.\n   o  The Common Information Model (CIM)\
    \ [CIM], developed by the\n      Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF), has\
    \ been extended in\n      cooperation with the DMTF to describe high-level policies\
    \ as rule\n      sets (PCIM) [RFC3060].  Mappings of the CIM policy extensions\
    \ to\n      LDAP schemas have been defined and work continues to define\n    \
    \  specific schema extension for QoS and security policies.\n   o  The Common\
    \ Open Policy Service (COPS) [RFC2748] protocol has been\n      extended to provision\
    \ configuration information on devices (COPS-\n      PR) [RFC3084].  Work is underway\
    \ to define data definitions for\n      specific services such as Differentiated\
    \ Services (DiffServ).\n   During 2001, several meetings have been organized at\
    \ various events\n   (NANOG-22 May 2001, RIPE-40 October 2001, LISA-XV December\
    \ 2001,\n   IETF-52 December 2001) to start a direct dialog between network\n\
    \   operators and protocol developers.  During these meetings, several\n   operators\
    \ have expressed their opinion that the developments in the\n   IETF do not really\
    \ address their requirements, especially for\n   configuration management.  This\
    \ naturally leads to the question of\n   whether the IETF should refocus resources,\
    \ and which strategic future\n   activities in the operations and management area\
    \ should be started.\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB), on June 4 thru\
    \ June 6, 2002,\n   held an invitational workshop on network management.  The\
    \ goal of the\n   workshop was to continue the important dialog started between\
    \ network\n   operators and protocol developers, and to guide the IETFs focus\
    \ on\n   future work regarding network management.\n   The workshop started with\
    \ two breakout session to (a) identify a list\n   of technologies relevant for\
    \ network management together with their\n   strengths and weaknesses, and to\
    \ (b) identify the most important\n   operator needs.  The results of these discussions\
    \ are documented in\n   Section 2 and Section 3.  During the following discussions,\
    \ many more\n   specific characteristics of the current SNMP framework were\n\
    \   identified.  These discussions are documented in Section 4.  Section\n   5\
    \ defines a combined feature list that was developed during the\n   discussions\
    \ following the breakout sessions.  Section 6 gives\n   concrete recommendations\
    \ to the IETF.\n   The following text makes no explicit distinction between different\n\
    \   versions of SNMP.  For the majority of the SNMP related statements,\n   the\
    \ protocol version is irrelevant.  Nevertheless, some statements\n   are more\
    \ applicable to SNMPv1/SNMPv2c environments, while other\n   statements (especially\
    \ those concerned with security) are more\n   applicable to SNMPv3 environments.\n"

  - "2. Network Management Technologies\n   During the breakout sessions, the protocol\
    \ developers assembled a\n   list of the various network management technologies\
    \ that are\n   available or under active development.  For each technology, a\
    \ list\n   of strong (+) and weak (-) points were identified.  There are also\n\
    \   some characteristics which appear to be neutral (o).\n   The list does not\
    \ attempt to be complete.  Focus was given to IETF\n   specific technologies (SNMP,\
    \ COPS-PR, PCIM) and widely used\n   proprietary technologies (CLI, HTTP/HTML,\
    \ XML).  The existence of\n   other generic management technologies (such as TL1,\
    \ CORBA, CMIP/GDMO,\n   TMN) or specific management technologies for specific\
    \ problem domains\n   (such as RADIUS, DHCP, BGP, OSPF) were acknowledged, but\
    \ were not the\n   focus of discussion.\n"
- title: 2.1 SNMP / SMI / MIBs
  contents:
  - "2.1 SNMP / SMI / MIBs\n   The SNMP management technology was created in the late\
    \ 1980s and has\n   since been widely implemented and deployed in the Internet.\
    \  There is\n   lots of implementational and operational experience, and the\n\
    \   characteristics of the technology are thus well understood.\n   +  SNMP works\
    \ reasonably well for device monitoring.  The stateless\n      nature of SNMP\
    \ is useful for statistical and status polling.\n   +  SNMP is widely deployed\
    \ for basic monitoring.  Some core MIB\n      modules, such as the IF-MIB [RFC2863],\
    \ are implemented on most\n      networking devices.\n   +  There are many well\
    \ defined proprietary MIB modules developed by\n      network device vendors to\
    \ support their management products.\n   +  SNMP is an important data source for\
    \ systems that do event\n      correlation, alarm detection, and root cause analysis.\n\
    \   o  SNMP requires applications to be useful.  SNMP was, from its early\n  \
    \    days, designed as a programmatic interface between management\n      applications\
    \ and devices.  As such, using SNMP without management\n      applications or\
    \ smart tools appears to be more complicated.\n   o  Standardized MIB modules\
    \ often lack writable MIB objects which can\n      be used for configuration,\
    \ and this leads to a situation where the\n      interesting writable objects\
    \ exist in proprietary MIB modules.\n   -  There are scaling problems with regard\
    \ to the number of objects in\n      a device.  While SNMP provides reasonable\
    \ performance for the\n      retrieval of a small amount of data from many devices,\
    \ it becomes\n      rather slow when retrieving large amounts of data (such as\
    \ routing\n      tables) from a few devices.\n   -  There is too little deployment\
    \ of writable MIB modules.  While\n      there are some notable exceptions in\
    \ areas, such as cable modems\n      where writable MIB modules are essential,\
    \ it appears that router\n      equipment is usually not fully configurable via\
    \ SNMP.\n   -  The SNMP transactional model and the protocol constraints make\
    \ it\n      more complex to implement MIBs, as compared to the implementation\n\
    \      of commands of a command line interface interpreter.  A logical\n     \
    \ operation on a MIB can turn into a sequence of SNMP interactions\n      where\
    \ the implementation has to maintain state until the operation\n      is complete,\
    \ or until a failure has been determined.  In case of a\n      failure, a robust\
    \ implementation must be smart enough to roll the\n      device back into a consistent\
    \ state.\n   -  SNMP does not support easy retrieval and playback of\n      configurations.\
    \  One part of the problem is that it is not easy to\n      identify configuration\
    \ objects.  Another part of the problem is\n      that the naming system is very\
    \ specific and physical device\n      reconfigurations can thus break the capability\
    \ to play back a\n      previous configuration.\n   -  There is often a semantic\
    \ mismatch between the task-oriented view\n      of the world usually preferred\
    \ by operators and the data-centric\n      view of the world provided by SNMP.\
    \  Mapping from a task-oriented\n      view to the data-centric view often requires\
    \ some non-trivial code\n      on the management application side.\n   -  Several\
    \ standardized MIB modules lack a description of high-level\n      procedures.\
    \  It is often not obvious from reading the MIB modules\n      how certain high-level\
    \ tasks are accomplished, which leads to\n      several different ways to achieve\
    \ the same goal, which increases\n      costs and hinders interoperability.\n\
    \   A more detailed discussion about the SNMP management technology can\n   be\
    \ found in Section 4.\n"
- title: 2.2 COPS-PR / SPPI / PIBs
  contents:
  - "2.2 COPS-PR / SPPI / PIBs\n   The COPS protocol [RFC2748] was defined in the\
    \ late 1990s to support\n   policy control over QoS signaling protocols.  The\
    \ COPS-PR extension\n   allows provision policy information on devises.\n   +\
    \  COPS-PR allows high-level transactions for single devices,\n      including\
    \ deleting one configuration and replacing it with\n      another.\n   +  COPS-PRs\
    \ non-overlapping instance namespace normally ensures that\n      no other manager\
    \ can corrupt a specific configuration.  All\n      transactions for a given instance\
    \ namespace are required to be\n      executed in-order.\n   +  Both manager and\
    \ device states are completely synchronized with\n      one another at all times.\
    \  If there is a failure in communication,\n      the state is resynchronized\
    \ when the network is operating properly\n      again and the device's network\
    \ configuration is valid.\n   +  The atomicity of transactions is well-defined.\
    \  If there is any\n      failure in a transaction, that specific failure is reported\
    \ to the\n      manager, and the local configuration is supposed to be\n     \
    \ automatically rolled-back to the state of the last \"good\"\n      transaction.\n\
    \   +  Capability reporting is part of the framework PIB which must be\n     \
    \ supported by COPS-PR implementations.  This allows management\n      applications\
    \ to adapt to the capabilities present on a device.\n   +  The focus of COPS-PR\
    \ is configuration, and the protocol has been\n      optimized for this purpose\
    \ (by using for example TCP as a\n      transport mechanism).\n   o  Only a single\
    \ manager is allowed to have control, at any point in\n      time, for a given\
    \ subject category on a device.  (The subject\n      category maps to a COPS Client-Type.)\
    \  This single manager\n      assumption simplifies the protocol as it makes it\
    \ easier to\n      maintain shared state.\n   o  Similar to SNMP, COPS-PR requires\
    \ applications to be useful since\n      it is also designed as a programmatic\
    \ interface between management\n      applications and devices.\n   -  As of the\
    \ time of the meeting, there are no standardized PIB\n      modules.\n   -  Compared\
    \ to SNMP, there is not yet enough experience to understand\n      the strong\
    \ and weak aspects of the protocol in operational\n      environments.\n   - \
    \ COPS-PR does not support easy retrieval and playback of\n      configurations.\
    \  The reasons are similar as for SNMP.\n   -  The COPS-PR view of the world is\
    \ data-centric, similar to SNMP's\n      view of the world.  A mapping from the\
    \ data-centric view to a\n      task-oriented view and vice versa, has similar\
    \ complexities as\n      with SNMP.\n"
- title: 2.3 CIM / MOF / UML / PCIM
  contents:
  - "2.3 CIM / MOF / UML / PCIM\n   The development of the Common Information Model\
    \ (CIM) [CIM] started\n   in the DMTF in the mid 1990s.  The development follows\
    \ a top-down\n   approach where core classes are defined first and later extended\
    \ to\n   model specific services.  The DMTF and the IETF jointly developed\n \
    \  policy extensions of the CIM, known as PCIM [RFC3060].\n   +  The CIM technology\
    \ generally follows principles of object-\n      orientation with full support\
    \ of methods on data objects, which is\n      not available in SNMP or COPS-PR.\n\
    \   +  The MOF format allows representation of instances in a common\n      format.\
    \  No such common format exists for SNMP or COPS-PR.  It is\n      of course possible\
    \ to store instances in the form of BER encoded\n      ASN.1 sequences, but this\
    \ is generally not suitable for human\n      readability.\n   +  There is support\
    \ for a query facility which allows the locating of\n      CIM objects.  However,\
    \ the query language itself is not yet\n      specified as part of the CIM standards.\
    \  Implementations currently\n      use proprietary query languages, such as the\
    \ Windows Management\n      Instrumentation Query Language (WQL).\n   +  The information\
    \ modeling work in CIM is done by using Unified\n      Modeling Language (UML)\
    \ as a graphical notation.  This attracts\n      people with a computer science\
    \ background who have learned to use\n      UML as part of their education.\n\
    \   o  The main practical use of CIM schemas today seems to be the\n      definition\
    \ of data structures used internally by management\n      systems.\n   -  The\
    \ CIM schemas have rather complex interrelationships that must\n      be understood\
    \ before one can reasonably extend the set of existing\n      schemas.\n   - \
    \ Interoperability between CIM implementations seems to be\n      problematic\
    \ compared to the number of interoperable SNMP\n      implementations available\
    \ today.\n   -  So far, CIM schemas have seen limited implementation and usage\
    \ as\n      an interface between management systems and network devices.\n"
- title: 2.4 CLI / TELNET / SSH
  contents:
  - "2.4 CLI / TELNET / SSH\n   Most devices have a builtin command line interface\
    \ (CLI) for\n   configuration and troubleshooting purposes.  Network access to\
    \ the\n   CLI has traditionally been through the TELNET protocol, while the SSH\n\
    \   protocol is gaining momentum to address security issues associated\n   with\
    \ TELNET.  In the following, only CLIs that actually parse and\n   execute commands\
    \ are considered.  (Menu-oriented interfaces are\n   difficult for automation\
    \ and thus not relevant here.)\n   +  Command line interfaces are generally task-oriented,\
    \ which make\n      them easier to use for human operators.\n   +  A saved sequence\
    \ of textual commands can easily be replayed.\n      Simple substitutions can\
    \ be made with arbitrary text processing\n      tools.\n   +  It is usually necessary\
    \ to learn at least parts of the command\n      line interface of new devices\
    \ in order to create the initial\n      configuration.  Once people have learned\
    \ (parts of) the command\n      line interface, it is natural for them to use\
    \ the same interface\n      and abstractions for automating configuration changes.\n\
    \   +  A command line interface does not require any special purpose\n      applications\
    \ (telnet and ssh are readily available on most systems\n      today).\n   + \
    \ Most command line interfaces provide context sensitive help that\n      reduces\
    \ the learning curve.\n   -  Some command line interfaces lack a common data model.\
    \  It is very\n      well possible that the same command on different devices,\
    \ even\n      from the same vendor, behaves differently.\n   -  The command line\
    \ interface is primarily targeted to humans which\n      can adapt to minor syntax\
    \ and format changes easily.  Using\n      command line interfaces as a programmatic\
    \ interface is troublesome\n      because of parsing complexities.\n   -  Command\
    \ line interfaces often lack proper version control for the\n      syntax and\
    \ the semantics.  It is therefore time consuming and\n      error prone to maintain\
    \ programs or scripts that interface with\n      different versions of a command\
    \ line interface.\n   -  Since command line interfaces are proprietary, they can\
    \ not be\n      used efficiently to automate processes in an environment with\
    \ a\n      heterogenous set of devices.\n   -  The access control facilities,\
    \ if present at all, are often ad-hoc\n      and sometimes insufficient.\n"

    \   +  Embedded web servers for configuration are end-user friendly and\n    \

  - "2.6 XML\n   In the late 1990's, some vendors started to use the Extensible Markup\n\

    \   +  XML is a machine readable format which is easy to process and\n      there\

    \ asked to identify\n   needs that have not been sufficiently addressed.  The\
    \ results\n   produced during the breakout session were later discussed and\n\
    \   resulted in the following list of operator requirements.\n   1.  Ease of use\
    \ is a key requirement for any network management\n       technology from the\
    \ operators point of view.\n   2.  It is necessary to make a clear distinction\
    \ between configuration\n       data, data that describes operational state and\
    \ statistics.  Some\n       devices make it very hard to determine which parameters\
    \ were\n       administratively configured and which were obtained via other\n\
    \       mechanisms such as routing protocols.\n   3.  It is required to be able\
    \ to fetch separately configuration data,\n       operational state data, and\
    \ statistics from devices, and to be\n       able to compare these between devices.\n\
    \   4.  It is necessary to enable operators to concentrate on the\n       configuration\
    \ of the network as a whole rather than individual\n       devices.\n   5.  Support\
    \ for configuration transactions across a number of devices\n       would significantly\
    \ simplify network configuration management.\n   6.  Given configuration A and\
    \ configuration B, it should be possible\n       to generate the operations necessary\
    \ to get from A to B with\n       minimal state changes and effects on network\
    \ and systems.  It is\n       important to minimize the impact caused by configuration\
    \ changes.\n   7.  A mechanism to dump and restore configurations is a primitive\n\
    \       operation needed by operators.  Standards for pulling and pushing\n  \
    \     configurations from/to devices are desirable.\n   8.  It must be easy to\
    \ do consistency checks of configurations over\n       time and between the ends\
    \ of a link in order to determine the\n       changes between two configurations\
    \ and whether those\n       configurations are consistent.\n   9.  Network wide\
    \ configurations are typically stored in central\n       master databases and\
    \ transformed into formats that can be pushed\n       to devices, either by generating\
    \ sequences of CLI commands or\n       complete configuration files that are pushed\
    \ to devices.  There\n       is no common database schema for network configuration,\
    \ although\n       the models used by various operators are probably very similar.\n\
    \       It is desirable to extract, document, and standardize the common\n   \
    \    parts of these network wide configuration database schemas.\n   10. It is\
    \ highly desirable that text processing tools such as diff,\n       and version\
    \ management tools such as RCS or CVS, can be used to\n       process configurations,\
    \ which implies that devices should not\n       arbitrarily reorder data such\
    \ as access control lists.\n   11. The granularity of access control needed on\
    \ management interfaces\n       needs to match operational needs.  Typical requirements\
    \ are a\n       role-based access control model and the principle of least\n \
    \      privilege, where a user can be given only the minimum access\n       necessary\
    \ to perform a required task.\n   12. It must be possible to do consistency checks\
    \ of access control\n       lists across devices.\n   13. It is important to distinguish\
    \ between the distribution of\n       configurations and the activation of a certain\
    \ configuration.\n       Devices should be able to hold multiple configurations.\n\
    \   14. SNMP access control is data-oriented, while CLI access control is\n  \
    \     usually command (task) oriented.  Depending on the management\n       function,\
    \ sometimes data-oriented or task-oriented access control\n       makes more sense.\
    \  As such, it is a requirement to support both\n       data-oriented and task-oriented\
    \ access control.\n   So far, there is no published document that clearly defines\
    \ the\n   requirements of the operators.\n"
- title: 4. SNMP Framework Discussions
  contents:
  - "4. SNMP Framework Discussions\n   During the discussions, many properties of\
    \ the SNMP framework were\n   identified.\n   1.  It is usually not possible to\
    \ retrieve complete device\n       configurations via SNMP so that they can be\
    \ compared with\n       previous configurations or checked for consistency across\n\
    \       devices.  There is usually only incomplete coverage of device\n      \
    \ features via the SNMP interface, and there is a lack of\n       differentiation\
    \ between configuration data and operational state\n       data for many features.\n\
    \   2.  The quality of SNMP instrumentations is sometimes disappointing.\n   \
    \    SNMP access sometimes crashes systems or returns wrong data.\n   3.  MIB\
    \ modules and their implementations are not available in a\n       timely manner\
    \ (sometimes MIB modules lag years behind) which\n       forces users to use the\
    \ CLI.\n   4.  Operators view current SNMP programming/scripting interfaces as\n\
    \       being too low-level and thus too time consuming and inconvenient\n   \
    \    for practical use.\n   5.  Lexicographic ordering is sometimes artificial\
    \ with regard to\n       internal data structures and causes either significant\
    \ runtime\n       overhead, or increases implementation costs or implementation\n\
    \       delay or both.\n   6.  Poor performance for bulk data transfers.  The\
    \ typical examples\n       are routing tables.\n   7.  Poor performance on query\
    \ operations that were not anticipated\n       during the MIB design.  A typical\
    \ example is the following query:\n       Which outgoing interface is being used\
    \ for a specific destination\n       address?\n   8.  The SNMP credentials and\
    \ key management are considered complex,\n       especially since they do not\
    \ integrate well with other existing\n       credential and key management systems.\n\
    \   9.  The SMI language is hard to deal with and not very practical.\n   10.\
    \ MIB modules are often over-engineered in the sense that they\n       contain\
    \ lots of variables that operators do not look at.\n   11. SNMP traps are used\
    \ to track state changes but often syslog\n       messages are considered more\
    \ useful since they usually contain\n       more information to describe the problem.\
    \  SNMP traps usually\n       require subsequent get operations to figure out\
    \ what the trap\n       really means.\n   12. Device manufacturers find SNMP instrumentations\
    \ inherently\n       difficult to implement, especially with complex table indexing\n\
    \       schemes and table interrelationships.\n   13. MIB modules often lack a\
    \ description of how the various objects\n       can be used to achieve certain\
    \ management functions.  (MIB\n       modules can often be characterized as a\
    \ list of ingredients\n       without a recipe.)\n   14. The lack of structured\
    \ types and various RPC interactions\n       (methods) make MIB modules much more\
    \ complex to design and\n       implement.\n   15. The lack of query and aggregation\
    \ capabilities (reduction of\n       data) causes efficiency and scalability problems.\n\
    \   16. The SNMP protocol was simplified in terms of the number of\n       protocol\
    \ operations and resource requirements on managed devices.\n       It was not\
    \ simplified in terms of usability by network operators\n       or instrumentation\
    \ implementors.\n   17. There is a semantic mismatch between the low-level data-oriented\n\
    \       abstraction level of MIB modules and the task-oriented\n       abstraction\
    \ level desired by network operators.  Bridging the gap\n       with tools is\
    \ in principle possible, but in general it is\n       expensive as it requires\
    \ some serious development and programming\n       efforts.\n   18. SNMP seems\
    \ to work reasonably well for small devices which have a\n       limited number\
    \ of managed objects and where end-user management\n       applications are shipped\
    \ by the vendor.  For more complex\n       devices, SNMP becomes too expensive\
    \ and too hard to use.\n   19. There is a disincentive for vendors to implement\
    \ SNMP equivalent\n       MIB modules for all their CLI commands because they\
    \ do not see a\n       valued proposition.  This undermines the value of third\
    \ party\n       standard SNMP solutions.\n   20. Rapid feature development is\
    \ in general not compatible with the\n       standardization of the configuration\
    \ interface.\n"
- title: 5. Consolidated Observations
  contents:
  - "5. Consolidated Observations\n   1.  Programmatic interfaces have to provide\
    \ full coverage otherwise\n       they will not be used by network operators since\
    \ they have to\n       revert to CLIs anyway.\n   2.  Operators perceive that\
    \ equipment vendors do not implement MIB\n       modules in a timely manner. \
    \ Neither read-only nor read-write MIB\n       modules are available on time today.\n\
    \   3.  The attendees perceive that right now it is too hard to implement\n  \
    \     useful MIB modules within network equipment.\n   4.  Because of the previous\
    \ items, SNMP is not widely used today for\n       network device configuration,\
    \ although there are notable\n       exceptions.\n   5.  It is necessary to clearly\
    \ distinguish between configuration data\n       and operational data.\n   6.\
    \  It would be nice to have a single data definition language for\n       all\
    \ programmatic interfaces (in case there happen to be multiple\n       programmatic\
    \ interfaces).\n   7.  In general, there is a lack of input from the enterprise\
    \ network\n       space.  Those enterprises who provided input tend to operate\n\
    \       their networks like network operators.\n   8.  It is required to be able\
    \ to dump and reload a device\n       configuration in a textual format in a standard\
    \ manner across\n       multiple vendors and device types.\n   9.  It is desirable\
    \ to have a mechanism to distribute configurations\n       to devices under transactional\
    \ constraints.\n   10. Eliminating SNMP altogether is not an option.\n   11. Robust\
    \ access control is needed.  In addition, it is desirable to\n       be able to\
    \ enable/disable individual MIB modules actually\n       implemented on a device.\n\
    \   12. Textual configuration files should be able to contain\n       international\
    \ characters.  Human-readable strings should utilize\n       the least-bad internationalized\
    \ character set and encoding, which\n       this year almost certainly means UTF-8.\
    \  Protocol elements should\n       be in case insensitive ASCII.\n   13. The\
    \ deployed tools for event/alarm correlation, root cause\n       analysis and\
    \ logging are not sufficient.\n   14. There is a need to support a human interface\
    \ and a programmatic\n       interface.\n   15. The internal method routines for\
    \ both interfaces should be the\n       same to ensure that data exchanged between\
    \ these two interfaces\n       is always consistent.\n   16. The implementation\
    \ costs have to be low on devices.\n   17. The implementation costs have to be\
    \ low on managers.\n   18. The specification costs for data models have to be\
    \ low.\n   19. Standardization costs for data models have to be low.\n   20. There\
    \ should be a single data modeling language with a human\n       friendly syntax.\n\
    \   21. The data modeling language must support compound data types.\n   22. There\
    \ is a need for data aggregation capabilities on the devices.\n   23. There should\
    \ be a common data interchange format for instance\n       data that allows easy\
    \ post-processing and analysis.\n   24. There is a need for a common data exchange\
    \ format with single and\n       multi-system transactions (which implies rollback\
    \ across devices\n       in error situations).\n   25. There is a need to reduce\
    \ the semantic mismatch between current\n       data models and the primitives\
    \ used by operators.\n   26. It should be possible to perform operations on selected\
    \ subsets\n       of management data.\n   27. It is necessary to discover the\
    \ capabilities of devices.\n   28. There is a need for a secure transport, authentication,\
    \ identity,\n       and access control which integrates well with existing key\
    \ and\n       credential management infrastructure.\n   29. It must be possible\
    \ to define task oriented views and access\n       control rules.\n   30. The\
    \ complete configuration of a device should be doable with a\n       single protocol.\n\
    \   31. A configuration protocol must be efficient and reliable and it\n     \
    \  must scale in the number of transactions and devices.\n   32. Devices must\
    \ be able to support minimally interruptive\n       configuration deltas.\n  \
    \ 33. A solution must support function call semantics (methods) to\n       implement\
    \ functions, such as a longest prefix match on a routing\n       table.\n"
- title: 6. Recommendations
  contents:
  - "6. Recommendations\n   1.  The workshop recommends that the IETF stop forcing\
    \ working groups\n       to provide writable MIB modules.  It should be the decision\
    \ of\n       the working group whether they want to provide writable objects\n\
    \       or not.\n   2.  The workshop recommends that a group be formed to investigate\
    \ why\n       current MIB modules do not contain all the objects needed by\n \
    \      operators to monitor their networks.\n   3.  The workshop recommends that\
    \ a group be formed to investigate why\n       the current SNMP protocol does\
    \ not satisfy all the monitoring\n       requirements of operators.\n   4.  The\
    \ workshop recommends, with strong consensus from both protocol\n       developers\
    \ and operators, that the IETF focus resources on the\n       standardization\
    \ of configuration management mechanisms.\n   5.  The workshop recommends, with\
    \ strong consensus from the operators\n       and rough consensus from the protocol\
    \ developers, that the\n       IETF/IRTF should spend resources on the development\
    \ and\n       standardization of XML-based device configuration and management\n\
    \       technologies (such as common XML configuration schemas, exchange\n   \
    \    protocols and so on).\n   6.  The workshop recommends, with strong consensus\
    \ from the operators\n       and rough consensus from the protocol developers,\
    \ that the\n       IETF/IRTF should not spend resources on developing HTML-based\
    \ or\n       HTTP-based methods for configuration management.\n   7.  The workshop\
    \ recommends, with rough consensus from the operators\n       and strong consensus\
    \ from the protocol developers, that the IETF\n       should continue to spend\
    \ resources on the evolution of the\n       SMI/SPPI data definition languages\
    \ as being done in the SMIng\n       working group.\n   8.  The workshop recommends,\
    \ with split consensus from the operators\n       and rough consensus from the\
    \ protocol developers, that the IETF\n       should spend resources on fixing\
    \ the MIB development and\n       standardization process.\n   The workshop also\
    \ discussed the following items and achieved rough\n   consensus, but did not\
    \ make a recommendation.\n   1.  The workshop had split consensus from the operators\
    \ and rough\n       consensus from the protocol developers, that the IETF should\
    \ not\n       focus resources on CIM extensions.\n   2.  The workshop had rough\
    \ consensus from the protocol developers\n       that the IETF should not spend\
    \ resources on COPS-PR development.\n       So far, the operators have only very\
    \ limited experience with\n       COPS-PR.  In general, however, they felt that\
    \ further development\n       of COPS-PR might be a waste of resources as they\
    \ assume that\n       COPS-PR does not really address their requirements.\n  \
    \ 3.  The workshop had rough consensus from the protocol developers\n       that\
    \ the IETF should not spend resources on SPPI PIB definitions.\n       The operators\
    \ had rough consensus that they do not care about\n       SPPI PIBs.\n"
