  - "Abstract\n   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) require the use of cryptographic\n
    \  algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data.\n   The algorithms
    specified for use with DNSSEC are reflected in an\n   IANA-maintained registry.
    \ This document presents a set of changes\n   for some entries of the registry.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC,
    defined by\n   [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702])\n
    \  use digital signatures over DNS data to provide source authentication\n   and
    integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry to list codes\n   for digital
    signature algorithms (consisting of an asymmetric\n   cryptographic algorithm
    and a one-way hash function).\n   This document updates a set of entries in the
    IANA registry titled\n   \"DNS Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers\".  These updated
    entries are\n   given in Section 2.2 below.  This list includes changes to selected\n
    \  entries originally set aside for future algorithm specification that\n   did
    not occur.  These three entries are changed to \"Reserved\" to\n   avoid potential
    conflicts with older implementations.  This document\n   also brings the list
    of references for entries up to date.\n   There are auxiliary sub-registries related
    to the DNS Security\n   (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers registry that deal with various
    Diffie-\n   Hellman parameters used with DNSSEC.  These registry tables are not\n
    \  altered by this document.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  The DNS Security Algorithm Numbers Sub-Registry\n   The DNS Security Algorithm
    Numbers sub-registry (part of the Domain\n   Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm
    Numbers registry) contains a\n   set of entries that contain errors.  There are
    additional differences\n   to entries that are described in Section 2.1, and the
    complete list\n   of changed registry entries is in Section 2.2.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Updates and Additions\n   This document updates three entries in the
      Domain Name System\n   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers registry:\n   The
      description for assignment number 4 is changed to \"Reserved\".\n   The description
      for assignment number 9 is changed to \"Reserved\".\n   The description for
      assignment number 11 is changed to \"Reserved\".\n   The above entries are changed
      to \"Reserved\" because they were\n   placeholders for algorithms that were
      not fully specified for use\n   with DNSSEC.  Older implementations may still
      have these algorithm\n   codes assigned, so these codes are reserved to prevent
      potential\n   incompatibilities.\n"
