- title: 2.  About The Unicode Consortium
  contents:
  - "2.  About The Unicode Consortium\n   The Unicode Consortium is a corporation.\
    \  Legally speaking, it is a\n   \"California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation\"\
    , organized under\n   section 501 C(6) of the Internal Revenue Service Code of\
    \ the United\n   States.  As such, it is a \"business league\" not focussed on\
    \ profiting\n   by sales or production of goods and services, but neither is it\n\
    \   formally a \"charitable\" organization.  It is an alliance of member\n   companies\
    \ whose purpose is to \"extend, maintain, and promote the\n   Unicode Standard\"\
    .  To this end, the Consortium keeps a small office,\n   a few editorial and technical\
    \ staff, World Wide Web presence, and\n   mail list presence.\n   The corporation\
    \ is presided over by a Board of Directors who meet\n   annually.  The Board is\
    \ comprised of individuals who are elected\n   annually by the full members for\
    \ three-year terms.  The Board\n   appoints Officers of the corporation to run\
    \ the daily operations.\n   Membership in the Consortium is open to \"all corporations,\
    \ other\n   business entities, governmental agencies, not-for-profit\n   organizations\
    \ and academic institutions\" who support the Consortium's\n   purpose.  Formally,\
    \ one class of voting membership is recognized, and\n   dues-paying members are\
    \ typically for-profit corporations, research\n   and educational institutions,\
    \ or national governments.  Each such\n   full member sends representatives to\
    \ meetings of the Unicode\n   Technical Committee (see below), as well as to a\
    \ brief annual\n   Membership meeting.\n"
- title: 3.  The Unicode Technical Committee
  contents:
  - "3.  The Unicode Technical Committee\n   The Unicode Technical Committee (UTC)\
    \ is the technical decision\n   making body of the Consortium.  The UTC inherited\
    \ the work and prior\n   decisions of the Unicode Working Group (UWG) that was\
    \ active prior to\n   formation of the Consortium in January 1991.\n   Formally,\
    \ the UTC is a technical body instituted by resolution of the\n   board of directors.\
    \  Each member appoints one principal and one or\n   two alternate representatives\
    \ to the UTC.  UTC representatives\n   frequently do, but need not, act as the\
    \ ordinary member\n   representatives for the purposes of the annual meeting.\n\
    \   The UTC is presided over by a Chair and Vice-Chair, appointed by the\n   Board\
    \ of Directors for an unspecified term of service.\n   The UTC meets 4 to 5 times\
    \ a year to discuss proposals, additions,\n   and various other technical topics.\
    \  Each meeting lasts 3 to 4 full\n   days.  Meetings are held in locations decided\
    \ upon by the membership,\n   frequently in the San Francisco Bay Area.  There\
    \ is no fee for\n   participation in UTC meetings.  Agendas for meetings are not\n\
    \   generally posted to any public forum, but meeting dates, locations,\n   and\
    \ logistics are posted well in advance on the \"Unicode Calendar of\n   Events\"\
    \ web page.\n   At the discretion of the UTC chair, meetings are open to\n   participation\
    \ of member and liaison organizations, and to observation\n   by others.  The\
    \ minutes of meetings are also posted publicly on the\n   \"UTC Minutes\" page\
    \ of the Unicode Web site.\n   All UTC meetings are held jointly with the INCITS\
    \ Technical Committee\n   L2, the body responsible for Character Code standards\
    \ in the United\n   States.  They constitute \"ad hoc\" meetings of the L2 body\
    \ and are\n   usually followed by a full meeting of the L2 committee.  Further\n\
    \   information on L2 is available on the official INCITS web page.\n"
- title: 4.  Unicode Technical Committee Procedures
  contents:
  - "4.  Unicode Technical Committee Procedures\n   The formal procedures of the UTC\
    \ are publicly available in a document\n   entitled \"UTC Procedures\", available\
    \ from the Consortium, and on the\n   Unicode web site.\n   Despite the invocation\
    \ of Robert's Rules of Order, UTC meetings are\n   conducted with relative informality\
    \ in view of the highly technical\n   nature of most discussions.  Meetings focus\
    \ on items from a technical\n   agenda organized and published by the UTC Chair\
    \ prior to the meeting.\n   Technical items are usually proposals in one of the\
    \ following\n   categories:\n      1. Addition of new characters (whole scripts,\
    \ additions to\n         existing scripts, or other characters)\n      2. Preparation\
    \ and Editing of Technical Reports and Standards\n      3. Changes in the semantics\
    \ of specific characters\n      4. Extensions to the encoding architecture and\
    \ forms of use\n   Note: There may also be changes to the architecture, character\n\
    \   properties, or semantics.  Such changes are rare, and are always\n   constrained\
    \ by the \"Unicode Stability Policies\" posted on the Unicode\n   web site.  Significant\
    \ changes are undertaken in consultation with\n   liaison organizations, such\
    \ as W3C and IETF, which have standards\n   that may be affected by such changes.\
    \  See sections 5 and 6 below.\n   Typical outputs of the UTC are:\n      1. The\
    \ Unicode Standard, major and minor versions (including the\n         Unicode\
    \ Character Database)\n      2. Unicode Technical Reports\n      3. Stand-alone\
    \ Unicode Technical Standards\n      4. Formal resolutions\n      5. Liaison statements\
    \ and instructions to the Unicode liaisons to\n         other organizations.\n\
    \   For each technical item on the meeting agenda, the general process is\n  \
    \ as follows:\n      1. Introduction by the topic sponsor\n      2. Proposals\
    \ and discussion\n      3. Consensus statements or formal motions\n      4. Assignment\
    \ of formal actions to implement decisions\n"
- title: 5.  Unicode Technical Committee Motions
  contents:
  - "5.  Unicode Technical Committee Motions\n   Technical topics of any complexity\
    \ never proceed from initial\n   proposal to final ratification or adoption into\
    \ the standard in the\n   course of one UTC meeting.  The UTC members and presiding\
    \ officers\n   are aware that technical changes to the standard have broad\n \
    \  consequences to other standards, implementers, and end-users of the\n   standard.\
    \  Input from other organizations and experts is often vital\n   to the understanding\
    \ of various proposals and for successful adoption\n   into the standard.\n  \
    \ Technical topics are decided in UTC through the use of formal\n   motions, either\
    \ taken in meetings, or by means of thirty-day letter\n   ballots.  Formal UTC\
    \ motions are of two types:\n      1. Simple motions\n      2. Precedents\n  \
    \ Simple motions may pass with a simple majority constituting more than\n   50\
    \ percent of the qualified voting members; or by a special majority\n   constituting\
    \ two-thirds or more of the qualified voting members.\n   Precedents are defined,\
    \ according to the UTC Procedures as either\n      (A) an existing Unicode Policy,\
    \ or\n      (B) an explicit precedent.\n   Precedents must be passed or overturned\
    \ by a special majority.\n   Examples of implicit precedents include:\n      1.\
    \ Publication of a character in the standard\n      2. Published normative character\
    \ properties\n      3. Algorithms required for formal conformance\n   An Explicit\
    \ Precedent is a policy, procedure, encoding, algorithm, or\n   other item that\
    \ is established by a separate motion saying (in\n   effect) that a particular\
    \ prior motion establishes a precedent.\n   A proposal may be passed either by\
    \ a formal motion and vote, or by\n   consensus.  If there is broad agreement\
    \ as to the proposal, and no\n   member wishes to force a vote, then the proposal\
    \ passes by consensus\n   and is recorded as such in the minutes.\n"
- title: 6.  Unicode Consortium Policies
  contents:
  - "6.  Unicode Consortium Policies\n   Because the Unicode Standard is continually\
    \ evolving in an attempt to\n   reach the ideal of encoding \"all the world's\
    \ scripts\", new characters\n   will constantly be added.  In this sense, the\
    \ standard is unstable:\n   in the standard's useful lifetime, there may never\
    \ be a final point\n   at which no more characters are added.  Realizing this,\
    \ the\n   Consortium has adopted certain policies to promote and maintain\n  \
    \ stability of the characters that are already encoded, as well as\n   laying\
    \ out a Roadmap to future encodings.\n   The overall policies of the Consortium\
    \ with regard to encoding\n   stability, as well as other issues such as privacy,\
    \ are published on\n   a \"Unicode Consortium Policies\" web page.  Deliberations\
    \ and encoding\n   proposals in the UTC are bound by these policies.\n   The general\
    \ effect of the stability policies may be stated in this\n   way: once a character\
    \ is encoded, it will not be moved or removed and\n   its name will not be changed.\
    \  Any of those actions has the potential\n   for causing obsolescence of data,\
    \ and they are not permitted.  The\n   canonical combining class and decompositions\
    \ of characters will not\n   be changed in any way that affects normalization.\
    \  In this sense,\n   normalization, such as that used for International Domain\
    \ Naming and\n   \"early normalization\" for use on the World Wide Web, is fixed\
    \ and\n   stable for every character at the time that character is encoded.\n\
    \   (Any changes that are undertaken because of outright errors in\n   properties\
    \ or decompositions are dealt with by means of an adjunct\n   data file so that\
    \ normalization stability can still be maintained by\n   those who need it.)\n\
    \   Once published, each version of the Unicode Standard is absolutely\n   stable\
    \ and will never be changed retroactively.  Implementations or\n   specifications\
    \ that refer to a specific version of the Unicode\n   Standard can rely upon this\
    \ stability.  If future versions of such\n   implementations or specifications\
    \ upgrade to a future version of the\n   Unicode Standard, then some changes may\
    \ be necessary.\n   Property values of characters, such as directionality for\
    \ the Unicode\n   Bidi algorithm, may be changed between versions of the standard\
    \ in\n   some circumstances.  As less-well documented characters and scripts\n\
    \   are encoded, the exact character properties and behavior may not be\n   well\
    \ known at the time the characters are first encoded.  As more\n   experience\
    \ is gathered in implementing the newly encoded characters,\n   adjustments in\
    \ the properties may become necessary.  This re-working\n   is kept to a minimum.\
    \  New and old versions of the relevant property\n   tables are made available\
    \ on the Consortium's web site.\n   Normative and some informative data about\
    \ characters is kept in the\n   Unicode Character Database (UCD).  The structure\
    \ of many of these\n   property values will not be changed.  Instead, when new\
    \ properties\n   are defined, the Consortium adds new files for these properties,\
    \ so\n   as not to affect the stability of existing implementations that use\n\
    \   the values and properties defined in the existing formats and files.\n   The\
    \ latest version of the UCD is available on the Consortium web site\n   via the\
    \ \"Unicode Data\" heading.\n   Note on data redistribution: Unlike the situation\
    \ with IETF\n   documents, some parts of the Unicode Character Database may have\n\
    \   restrictions on their verbatim redistribution with source-code\n   products.\
    \  Users should read the notices in files they intend to use\n   in such products.\
    \  The information contained in the UCD may be freely\n   used to create derivative\
    \ works (such as programs, compressed data\n   files, subroutines, data structures,\
    \ etc.) that may be redistributed\n   freely, but some files may not be redistributable\
    \ verbatim.  Such\n   restrictions on Unicode data files are never meant to prohibit\
    \ or\n   control the use of the data in products, but only to help ensure that\n\
    \   users retrieve the latest official releases of data files when using\n   the\
    \ data in products.\n"
- title: 7.  UTC and ISO (WG2)
  contents:
  - "7.  UTC and ISO (WG2)\n   The character repertoire, names, and general architecture\
    \ of the\n   Unicode Standard are identical to the parallel international standard\n\
    \   ISO/IEC 10646.  ISO/IEC 10646 only contains a small fraction of the\n   semantics,\
    \ properties and implementation guidelines supplied by the\n   Unicode Standard\
    \ and associated technical standards and reports.\n   Implementations conformant\
    \ to Unicode are conformant to ISO/IEC\n   10646.\n   ISO/IEC 10646 is maintained\
    \ by the committee ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2.\n   The WG2 committee is composed of\
    \ national body representatives to\n   ISO.  Details on the ISO organization may\
    \ be found on the official\n   web site of the International Organization for\
    \ Standardization (ISO).\n   Details and history of the relationship between ISO/IEC\
    \ JTC1/SC2/WG2\n   and Unicode, Inc. may be found in Appendix C of The Unicode\
    \ Standard.\n   (A PDF rendition of the most recent printed edition of the Unicode\n\
    \   Standard can be found on the Unicode web site.)\n   WG2 shares with UTC the\
    \ policies regarding stability: WG2 neither\n   removes characters nor changes\
    \ their names once published.  Changes\n   in both standards are closely tracked\
    \ by the respective committees,\n   and a very close working relationship is fostered\
    \ to maintain\n   synchronization between the standards.\n   The Unicode Collation\
    \ Algorithm (UCA) is one of a small set of other\n   independent standards defined\
    \ and maintained by UTC.  It is not,\n   properly speaking, part of the Unicode\
    \ Standard itself, but is\n   separately defined in Unicode Technical Standard\
    \ #10 (UTS #10).\n   There is no conformance relationship between the two standards,\n\
    \   except that conformance to a specific base version of the Unicode\n   Standard\
    \ (e.g., 4.0) is specified in a particular version of a UTS.\n   The collation\
    \ algorithm specified in UTS #10 is conformant to ISO/IEC\n   14651, maintained\
    \ by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2, and the two organizations\n   maintain a close relationship.\
    \  Beyond what is specified in ISO/IEC\n   14651, the UCA contains additional\
    \ constraints on collation,\n   specifies additional options, and provides many\
    \ more implementation\n   guidelines.\n"
- title: 8.  Process of Technical Changes to the Unicode Standard
  contents:
  - "8.  Process of Technical Changes to the Unicode Standard\n   Changes to The Unicode\
    \ Standard are of two types: architectural\n   changes, and character additions.\n\
    \   Most architectural changes do not affect ISO/IEC 10646, for example,\n   the\
    \ addition of various character properties to Unicode.  Those\n   architectural\
    \ changes that do affect both standards, such as\n   additional UTF formats or\
    \ allocation of planes, are very carefully\n   coordinated by the committees.\
    \  As always, on the UTC side,\n   architectural changes that establish precedents\
    \ are carefully\n   monitored and the above-described rules and procedures are\
    \ followed.\n   Additional characters for inclusion in the The Unicode Standard\
    \ must\n   be approved both by the UTC and by WG2.  Proposals for additional\n\
    \   characters enter the standards process in one of several ways:\n   through...\n\
    \      1. a national body member of WG2\n      2. a member company or associate\
    \ of UTC\n      3. directly from an individual \"expert\" contributor\n   The\
    \ two committees have jointly produced a \"Proposal Summary Form\"\n   that is\
    \ required to accompany all additional character proposals.\n   This form may\
    \ be found online at the WG2 web site, and on the Unicode\n   web site along with\
    \ information about \"Submitting New Characters or\n   Scripts\".  Instructions\
    \ for submitting proposals to UTC may likewise\n   be found online.\n   Often,\
    \ submission of proposals to both committees (UTC and WG2) is\n   simultaneous.\
    \  Members of UTC also frequently forward to WG2\n   proposals that have been\
    \ initially reviewed by UTC.\n   In general, a proposal that is submitted to UTC\
    \ before being\n   submitted to WG2 passes through several stages:\n      1. Initial\
    \ presentation to UTC\n      2. Review and re-drafting\n      3. Forwarding to\
    \ WG2 for consideration\n      4. Re-drafting for technical changes\n      5.\
    \ Balloting for approval in UTC\n      6. Re-forwarding and recommendation to\
    \ WG2\n      7. At least two rounds of international balloting in ISO\n   About\
    \ two years are required to complete this process.  Initial\n   proposals most\
    \ often do not include sufficient information or\n   justification to be approved.\
    \  These are returned to the submitters\n   with comments on how the proposal\
    \ needs to be amended or extended.\n   Repertoire addition proposals that are\
    \ submitted to WG2 before being\n   submitted to UTC are generally forwarded immediately\
    \ to UTC through\n   committee liaisons.  The crucial parts of the process (steps\
    \ 5\n   through 7 above) are never short-circuited.  A two-thirds majority in\n\
    \   UTC is required for approval at step 5.\n   Proposals for additional scripts\
    \ are required to be coordinated with\n   relevant user communities.  Often there\
    \ are ad-hoc subcommittees of\n   UTC or expert mail list participants who are\
    \ responsible for actually\n   drafting proposals, garnering community support,\
    \ or representing user\n   communities.\n   The rounds of international balloting\
    \ in step 7 have participation\n   both by UTC and WG2, though UTC does not directly\
    \ vote in the ISO\n   process.\n   Occasionally a proposal approved by one body\
    \ is considered too\n   immature for approval by the other body, and may be blocked\
    \ de-facto\n   by either of the two.  Only after both bodies have approved the\n\
    \   additional characters do they proceed to the rounds of international\n   balloting.\
    \  (The first round is a draft international standard during\n   which some changes\
    \ may occur, the second round is final approval\n   during which only editorial\
    \ changes are made.)\n   This process assures that proposals for additional characters\
    \ are\n   mature and stable by the time they appear in a final international\n\
    \   ballot.\n"
- title: 9.  Public Access to the Character Encoding Process
  contents:
  - "9.  Public Access to the Character Encoding Process\n   While Unicode, Inc. is\
    \ a membership organization, and the final say\n   in technical matters rests\
    \ with UTC, the process is quite open to\n   public input and scrutiny of processes\
    \ and proposals.  There are many\n   influential individual experts and industry\
    \ groups who are not\n   formally members, but whose input to the process is taken\
    \ seriously\n   by UTC.\n   Internally, UTC maintains a mail list called the \"\
    Unicore\" list,\n   which carries traffic related to meetings, technical content\
    \ of the\n   standard, and so forth.  Members of the list are UTC representatives;\n\
    \   employees and staff of member organizations (such as the Research\n   Libraries\
    \ Group); individual liaisons to and from other standards\n   bodies (such as\
    \ WG2 and IETF); and invited experts from institutions\n   such as the Library\
    \ of Congress and some universities.  Subscription\n   to the list for external\
    \ individuals is subject to \"sponsorship\" by\n   the corporate officers.\n \
    \  Unicode, Inc. also maintains a public discussion list called the\n   \"Unicode\"\
    \ list.  Subscription is open to anyone, and proceedings of\n   the \"Unicode\"\
    \ mail list are publicly archived.  Details are on the\n   Consortium web site\
    \ under the \"Mail Lists\" heading.\n   Technical proposals for changes to the\
    \ standard are posted to both of\n   these mail lists on a regular basis.  Discussion\
    \ on the public list\n   may result in a written proposal being generated for\
    \ a later UTC\n   meeting.  Technical issues and other standardization \"events\"\
    \ of any\n   significance, such as beta releases and availability of draft\n \
    \  documents, are announced and then discussed in this public forum,\n   well\
    \ before standardization is finalized.  From time to time, the UTC\n   also publishes\
    \ on the Consortium web site \"Public Review Issues\" to\n   gather feedback and\
    \ generate discussion of specific proposals whose\n   impact may be unclear, or\
    \ for which sufficiently broad review may not\n   yet have been brought to the\
    \ UTC deliberations.\n   Anyone may make a character encoding or architectural\
    \ proposal to\n   UTC.  Membership in the organization is not required to submit\
    \ a\n   proposal.  To be taken seriously, the proposal must be framed in a\n \
    \  substantial way, and be accompanied by sufficient documentation to\n   warrant\
    \ discussion.  Examples of proposals are easily available by\n   following links\
    \ from the \"Proposed Characters\" and \"Roadmaps\"\n   headings on the Unicode\
    \ web site.  Guidelines for proposals are also\n   available under the heading\
    \ \"Submitting Proposals\".\n   In general, proposals are publicly aired on the\
    \ \"Unicode\" mail list,\n   sometimes for a long period, prior to formal submission.\
    \  Generally\n   this is of benefit to the proposer as it tends to reduce the\
    \ number\n   of times the proposal is sent back for clarification or with requests\n\
    \   for additional information.  Once a proposal reaches the stage of\n   being\
    \ ready for discussion by UTC, the proposer will have received\n   contact through\
    \ the public mail list with one or more UTC members\n   willing to explain or\
    \ defend it in a UTC meeting.\n"
