  - "1.  Summary and recommendations\n   This document makes the following recommendations\
    \ for organizations\n   on the Internet:\n     (1)   An organization SHOULD publish\
    \ public E-mail addresses and\n           other public address information about\
    \ Internet users\n           within their site.\n     (2)   Most countries have\
    \ laws concerning publication of\n           information about persons. Above\
    \ and beyond these, the\n           organization SHOULD follow the recommendations\
    \ of [1].\n     (3)   The currently preferable way for publishing the information\n\
    \           is by using X.500 as its data structure and naming scheme\n      \
    \     (defined in [4] and discussed in [3], but some countries\n           use\
    \ a refinement nationally, like [15] for the US). The\n           organization\
    \ MAY additionally publish it using additional\n           data structures such\
    \ as whois++.\n     (4)   The organization SHOULD make the published information\n\
    \           available to LDAP clients, by allowing LDAP servers access\n     \
    \      to their data\".\n     (5)   The organization SHOULD NOT attempt to charge\
    \ for simple\n           access to the data.\n   In addition, it makes the following\
    \ recommendations for various and\n   sundry other parties:\n     (1)   E-mail\
    \ vendors SHOULD include LDAP lookup functionality\n           into their products,\
    \ either as built-in functionality or by\n           providing translation facilities.\n\
    \     (2)   Internet Service providers SHOULD help smaller\n           organizations\
    \ follow this recommendation, either by providing\n           services for hosting\
    \ their data, by helping them find other\n           parties to do so, or by helping\
    \ them bring their own service\n           on-line.\n     (3)   All interested\
    \ parties SHOULD make sure there exists a core\n           X.500 name space in\
    \ the world, and that all names in this\n           name space are resolvable.\
    \ (National name spaces may\n           elobarate on the core name space).\n \
    \  The rest of this document is justification and details for this\n   recommendation.\n\
    \   The words \"SHOULD\", \"MUST\" and \"MAY\", when written in UPPER CASE,\n\
    \   have the meaning defined in RFC 2119 [17]\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   The Internet is used for information exchange and communication\n\
    \   between its users. It can only be effective as such if users are able\n  \
    \ to find each other's addresses. Therefore the Internet benefits from\n   an\
    \ adequate White Pages Service, i.e., a directory service offering\n   (Internet)\
    \ address information related to people and organizations.\n   This document describes\
    \ the way in which the Internet White Pages\n   Service (from now on abbreviated\
    \ as IWPS) is best exploited using\n   today's experience, today's protocols,\
    \ today's products and today's\n   procedures.\n   Experience [2] has shown that\
    \ a White Pages Service based on self-\n   registration of users or on centralized\
    \ servers tends to gather data\n   in a haphazard fashion, and, moreover, collects\
    \ data that ages\n   rapidly and is not kept up to date.\n   The most vital attempts\
    \ to establish the IWPS are based on models\n   with distributed (local) databases\
    \ each holding a manageable part of\n   the IWPS information. Such a part mostly\
    \ consists of all relevant\n   IWPS information from within a particular organization\
    \ or from within\n   an Internet service provider and its users. On top of the\
    \ databases\n   there is a directory services protocol that connects them and\n\
    \   provides user access. Today X.500 is the most popular directory\n   services\
    \ protocol on the Internet, connecting the address information\n   of about 1,5\
    \ million individuals and 3,000 organizations. Whois++ is\n   the second popular\
    \ protocol. X.500 and Whois++ may also be used to\n   interconnect other information\
    \ than only IWPS information, but here\n   we only discuss the IWPS features.\n\
    \   Note: there are other, not interconnected, address databases on the\n   Internet\
    \ that are also very popular for storing address information\n   about people.\
    \ \"Ph\" is a popular protocol for use with a stand-alone\n   database.  There\
    \ are over 300 registered Ph databases on the\n   Internet. Interconnection of\
    \ databases however, is highly recommended\n   for an IWPS, since it ensures that\
    \ data can be found. Hence Ph as it\n   is now is not considered to be a good\
    \ candidate for an IWPS, but\n   future developments may change this situation\
    \ (see section 12).\n   Currently X.500 must be recommended as the directory services\n\
    \   protocol to be used for the IWPS. However, future technology may make\n  \
    \ it possible to use other protocols as well or instead.\n   Since many people\
    \ think that X.500 on the Internet will be replaced\n   by other protocols in\
    \ the near future, it should be mentioned here\n   that currently LDAP is seen\
    \ as the surviving component of today's\n   implementations and the main access\
    \ protocol for tomorrow's directory\n   services. As soon as new technology (that\
    \ will probably use LDAP)\n   becomes available and experiments show that they\
    \ work, this document\n   will be updated.\n   A summary of X.500 products can\
    \ be found in [14] (a document that\n   will be updated regularly).\n   The sections\
    \ 3-7 below contain recommendations related to the\n   publication of information\
    \ in the IWPS that are independent of a\n   directory services protocol. The sections\
    \ 8-11 discuss X.500 specific\n   issues. In section 12 some future developments\
    \ are discussed as they\n   can be foreseen at the time of writing this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Who should publish IWPS information and how?
  contents:
  - "3.  Who should publish IWPS information and how?\n   IWPS information is public\
    \ address information regarding individuals\n   and organizations. The IWPS information\
    \ concerning an individual\n   should be published and maintained by an organization\
    \ that has a\n   direct, durable link with this individual, like in the following\n\
    \   cases:\n   -    The individual is employed by the maintainer's organization\n\
    \   -    The individual is enrolled in the university/school that\n        maintains\
    \ the data\n   -    The individual is a (personal) subscriber of the maintainer's\n\
    \        Internet service\n   The organization that maintains the data does not\
    \ have to store the\n   data in a local database of its own. Though running a\
    \ local database\n   in the X.500 or Whois++ service is not a too difficult job,\
    \ it is\n   recommended that Internet service providers provide database\n   facilities\
    \ for those organizations among its customers that only\n   maintain a small part\
    \ of the IWPS information or don't have enough\n   system management resources.\
    \ This will encourage such organizations\n   to join the IWPS. Collection of IWPS\
    \ information and keeping it up-\n   to-date should always be in the hands of\
    \ the organization the\n   information relates to.\n   Within the current (national)\
    \ naming schemes for X.500, entries of\n   individuals reside under an organization.\
    \ In the case of Internet\n   service providers that hold the entries of their\
    \ subscribers this\n   would mean that individuals can only be found if one knows\
    \ the name\n   of the service provider.  The problem of this restriction could\
    \ be\n   solved by using a more topographical approach in the X.500 naming\n \
    \  scheme, but will more likely be solved by a future index service for\n   directory\
    \ services, which will allow searches for individuals without\n   organization\
    \ names (see section 12).\n"
- title: 4.  What kind of information should be published?
  contents:
  - "4.  What kind of information should be published?\n   The information to be published\
    \ about an individual should at least\n   include:\n   -    The individual's name\n\
    \   -    The individual's e-mail address, in RFC-822 format; if not\n        present,\
    \ some other contact information is to be included\n   -    Some indication of\
    \ the individual's relationship with the\n        maintainer\n   When X.500 is\
    \ used as directory services protocol the last\n   requirement may be fulfilled\
    \ by using the \"organizationalStatus\"\n   attribute (see [3]) or by adding a\
    \ special organizational unit to the\n   local X.500 name space that reflects\
    \ the relation (like ou=students\n   or ou=employees).\n   Additionally some other\
    \ public address information about individuals\n   may be included in the IWPS:\n\
    \       -    The individual's phone number\n       -    The individual's fax number\n\
    \       -    The individual's postal address\n       -    The URL of the individual's\
    \ home page on the Web\n   In the near future it will be a good idea to also store\
    \ public key\n   information.\n   More information about a recommended Internet\
    \ White Pages Schema is\n   found in The Internet White Pages Schema [16]\n  \
    \ Organizations should publish the following information about\n   themselves\
    \ in the IWPS:\n    -    The URL of the organizations home page on the Web\n \
    \   -    Postal address\n    -    Fax numbers\n    -    Internet domain\n    -\
    \    Various names and abbreviations for the organization that\n         people\
    \ can be expected to search for, such as the English\n         name, and often\
    \ the domain name of an organization.\n   Organizations may also publish phone\
    \ numbers and a presentation of\n   themselves.\n"
- title: 5.  Data management
  contents:
  - "5.  Data management\n   Data management, i.e. collecting the IWPS information\
    \ and keeping it\n   up-to-date, is a task that must not be underestimated for\
    \ larger\n   organizations. The following recommendations can be made with respect\n\
    \   to these issues:\n   -    An organization should achieve an executive level\
    \ commitment\n        to start a local database with IWPS information. This will\n\
    \        make it much easier to get cooperation from people within the\n     \
    \   organization that are to be involved in setting up a\n        Directory Service.\n\
    \   -    An organization should decide on the kind of information the\n      \
    \  database should contain and how it should be structured. It\n        should\
    \ follow the Internet recommendations for structuring\n        the information.\
    \ Besides the criteria in the previous\n        section, [3] and [4] should be\
    \ followed if X.500 is used as\n        directory services protocol.\n   -   \
    \ An organization should define criteria for the quality of the\n        data\
    \ in the Directory, like timeliness, update frequency,\n        correctness, etc.\
    \ These criteria should be communicated\n        throughout the organization and\
    \ contributing entities should\n        commit to the defined quality levels.\n\
    \   -    Existing databases within an organization should be used to\n       \
    \ retrieve IWPS and local information, to the greatest extent\n        possible.\
    \ An organization should involve the people who\n        maintain those databases\
    \ and make sure to get a formal\n        written commitment from them to use their\
    \ data source. The\n        organization should rely on these people, since they\
    \ have the\n        experience in management and control of local, available\n\
    \        data.\n   -    The best motivation for an organization to join the IWPS\
    \ is\n        that they will have a local database for local purposes at\n   \
    \     the same time. A local database may contain more, not\n        necessarily\
    \ public, information and serve more purposes than\n        is requested for in\
    \ the IWPS. In connecting to the IWPS an\n        organization must \"filter out\"\
    \ the extra local information\n        and services that is not meant for the\
    \ public IWPS using the\n        directory services protocol.\n"
- title: 6.  Legal issues
  contents:
  - "6.  Legal issues\n   Most countries have privacy laws regarding the publication\
    \ of\n   information about people. They range from the relaxed US laws to the\n\
    \   UK requirement that information should be accurate to the Norwegian\n   law\
    \ that says that you can't publish unless you get specific\n   permission from\
    \ the individual. Every maintainer of IWPS information\n   should publish data\
    \ according to the national law of the country in\n   which the local database\
    \ which holds the information resides.\n   Some of these are documented in [5]\
    \ and [1].\n   A maintainer of IWPS information should also follow some common\n\
    \   rules, even when they are not legally imposed:\n   -    Publish only correct\
    \ information.\n   -    Give people the possibility to view the information stored\n\
    \        about themselves and the right to withhold information or\n        have\
    \ information altered.\n   -    Don't publish information \"just because it's\
    \ there\". Publish\n        what is needed and what is thought useful, and no\
    \ more.\n   Given the number of data management and legal issues that are\n  \
    \ involved in publishing IWPS information, good consulting services are\n   vital\
    \ to have smaller companies quickly and efficiently join the\n   IWPS. Internet\
    \ service providers are encouraged to provide such\n   services.\n"
- title: 7.  Do not charge for lookups
  contents:
  - "7.  Do not charge for lookups\n   In the current IWPS it believed that due to\
    \ today's technological\n   constraints, charging users is harmful to the viability\
    \ of the\n   service.  There are several arguments for this belief:\n   -    Micropayment\
    \ technology is not available at the moment.\n   -    Subscription services require\
    \ either that the customer sign\n        up to multiple search services or that\
    \ the services are\n        linked \"behind the scene\" with all kinds of bilateral\n\
    \        agreements; both structures have unacceptably high overhead\n       \
    \ costs and increase the entry cost to the service.\n   -    The current directory\
    \ services protocols do not support\n        authentication to a level that would\
    \ seem appropriate for a\n        service that charges.\n   Therefore it is strongly\
    \ recommended that all lookups by users in the\n   IWPS are for free.  This, of\
    \ course, does not limit in any way the\n   ability to use the same IWPS dataset\
    \ to support other services where\n   charging may be appropriate.\n"
- title: 8.  Use X.500
  contents:
  - "8.  Use X.500\n   The IWPS based on the X.500 protocol has a relatively wide\n\
    \   deployment. The current service contains about 1,5 million entries of\n  \
    \ individuals and 3,000 of organizations. It is coordinated by Dante,\n   an Internet\
    \ service provider in the UK, and known as \"NameFLOW-\n   Paradise\".\n   Though\
    \ X.500 is sometimes criticized by the fact that its\n   functionality is restricted\
    \ by the hierarchical naming structure it\n   imposes, it provides a reasonably\
    \ good functionality as has been\n   shown in several pilots by organizations\
    \ [5], [2], [6], [7] that are\n   now running a production X.500 IWPS. User interfaces\
    \ also determine\n   the functionality the X.500 IWPS offers. Usually they offer\
    \ lookups\n   in the IWPS based on the following user input:\n   -    The name\
    \ of a person\n   -    The name of an organization this person can be related\
    \ to\n   -    The name of a country\n   As a result they will provide the publicly\
    \ available information\n   about the person in question. Most user interfaces\
    \ offer the\n   possibility to list organizations in a country and users in an\n\
    \   organization to help users to make their choice for the input. It may\n  \
    \ also be possible to use part of the names as input or approximate\n   names.\n\
    \   Specific user interfaces can provide lookups based on other input,\n   like\
    \ e-mail addresses of people or postal addresses of organizations.\n   Such possibilities\
    \ may however violate privacy laws. Providers of\n   directory services services\
    \ may then be held responsible.\n   The X.500 naming scheme imposes the requirement\
    \ on an interconnected\n   IWPS that all entries stored in it must have unique\
    \ names (the\n   \"naming scheme\"). This is most easily fulfilled by registering\
    \ all\n   entries in a \"naming tree\" with a single root; this is the reason\
    \ why\n   the totality of information in an X.500 IWPS is sometimes referred to\n\
    \   as the \"Directory Information Tree\"\n    or DIT.\n   Organizations are strongly\
    \ encouraged to use the X.500 protocol for\n   joining the IWPS. The current service\
    \ is based on the X.500 1988\n   standard [8] and some Internet-specific additions\
    \ to the protocol\n   that connects the local databases [10] and to the access\
    \ protocol\n   [9]. Organizations should use X.500 software based on these\n \
    \  specifications and additionally supports [11] for the transportation\n   of\
    \ OSI protocols over the Internet.\n   Organisations may connect to the NameFLOW-Paradise\
    \ infrastructure\n   with 1988 DSAs that don't implement [10], but they will lack\n\
    \   automatic replication of knowledge references. This will be\n   inconvenient,\
    \ but not a big problem. The 1993 standard of X.500\n   includes the functionality\
    \ from [10], but uses a different potocol.\n   Hence organisations that connect\
    \ to the infrastructure with a 1993\n   DSA will also encounter this shortcoming.\
    \ Section 12 \"Future\n   developments\" explains why the infrastructure doesn't\
    \ use the 1993\n   standard for the moment.\n   For recommendations on which attributes\
    \ to use in X.500 and how to\n   use them (either for public IWPS information\
    \ or additional local\n   information the reader is referred to [3] and [4]. For\
    \ specific non-\n   public local purposes also new attributes (and object classes)\
    \ may be\n   defined.  Generally it should be recommended to use as much as\n\
    \   possible the multi-valuedness of attributes in X.500 as this will\n   improve\
    \ the searching functionality of the service considerably. For\n   example, the\
    \ organizationalName attribute which holds the name of an\n   organization or\
    \ the commonName attribute which holds the name of a\n   person should contain\
    \ all known aliases for the organization or\n   person. In particular it is important\
    \ to add \"readable\" variants of\n   all attributes that people are expected\
    \ to search for, if they\n   contain national characters.\n   Another recommendation\
    \ that can be made is that replication of data\n   [10] between local databases\
    \ is used in order to improve the\n   performance of the service. Since replicating\
    \ all entries of a part\n   of the IWPS from one local database in another may\
    \ violate local\n   privacy laws, it is recommended to restrict replication to\
    \ country\n   and organizational entries and knowledge references (which tell\
    \ where\n   to go for which part of the IWPS). Of course privacy laws are not\n\
    \   violated when the replicating database is managed by the same\n   organization\
    \ as the one that masters the information. So local\n   replication between two\
    \ databases within the same organization is\n   highly recommended.\n   In general\
    \ replication within one country will usually be less a\n   legal problem than\
    \ across country borders.\n   Recommendations for the operation of a database\
    \ in the X.500\n   infrastructure can be found in [12].\n   X.500 is not recommended\
    \ to be used for:\n    -    A Yellow Pages service with a large scope. See [5].\n\
    \    -    Searching outside the limited patterns listed here, in\n         particular\
    \ searching for a person without knowing which\n         organization he might\
    \ be affiliated to.\n    -    Publishing information in other character sets than\
    \ ASCII,\n         some of the Latin-based European scripts and Japanese (the\n\
    \         T.61 character sets). While support for these character sets\n     \
    \    is available in revised versions of X.500, products that\n         support\
    \ the revision aren't commonly available yet.\n"
- title: 9.  Use the global name space
  contents:
  - "9.  Use the global name space\n   Some people, for instance when using Novell\
    \ 4 servers, have decided\n   that they will use X.500 or X.500-like services\
    \ as an internal naming\n   mechanism, without coordinating with an outside source.\n\
    \   This suffers from many of the same problems as private IP addresses,\n   only\
    \ more so: your data may need significant restructuring once you\n   decide to\
    \ expose them to the outer world.\n   A globally accessible X.500 service requires\
    \ a globally connected\n   X.500 name space. See [3] and [4] for recommendations\
    \ on how create a\n   local part of the global name space.\n   Though the standard\
    \ is not very clear about this and the most recent\n   version (93) appears not\
    \ to support it, in practice the X.500 name\n   space is only manageable if there\
    \ is a single root context operated\n   under a cooperative agreement. However,\
    \ one can be sure that there\n   will be turf battles over it's control.\n   If\
    \ those turf battles aren't decided outside the actual running\n   service, the\
    \ effect on the service quality will be ruinous.\n   This document appeals to\
    \ all players in the field to let existing\n   practice alone until a better system\
    \ is agreed and is ready to go\n   into place; at the moment, the root context\

- title: 10.  Use LDAP
  contents:
  - "10.  Use LDAP\n   At the moment, LDAP as documented in [9] is the protocol that\
    \ offers\n   the most X.500 functionality in places where it is not feasible to\n\
    \   implement the full OSI stack.\n   It is implemented on a lot of platforms,\
    \ including several PC-type\n   platforms, and is popular in a multitude of commercial\
    \ offerings.\n   A concerted effort to make LDAP available is the publication\
    \ method\n   that gives the widest access to the data.\n   In addition, X.500\
    \ DSAs must implement the necessary linkages to make\n   sure they are properly\
    \ integrated into the naming/referral tree; in\n   most cases, this will mean\
    \ that they should implement the X.500 DSP\n   protocol at least.\n   (The question\
    \ of whether one gateways LDAP to DAP or DAP to LDAP is\n   irrelevant in this\
    \ context; it may be quite appropriate to store data\n   on an LDAP-only server\
    \ and make it available to the DAP/DSP-running\n   world through a gateway if\
    \ the major users all use LDAP)\n"

    \ to be mentioned here is the creation of a\n   \"Common Indexing Protocol\" that\
    \ must enable the integration of X.500,\n   Whois++ and protocols that use stand-alone\
    \ databases. Such a protocol\n   would not only enable integration but would offer\
    \ at the same time\n   the possibility to explore yellow pages services and enhanced\n\
    \   searches, even if used for X.500 only.\n   In the context of the Common Indexing\
    \ Protocol the stand-alone LDAP\n   servers should be mentioned that are announced\
    \ by several software\n   developers. These are stand-alone address databases\
    \ that can be\n   accessed by LDAP. Currently also a public domain version is\
    \ available\n   from the University of Michigan.  Also announced is an LDAP-to-DAP\n\
    \   gateway that can integrate a stand-alone LDAP server in an X.500\n   infrastructure.\n\
    \   Other improvements include defining a common core schema for multiple\n  \
    \ White Pages services, leading to the possibility of accessing data in\n   multiple\
    \ services through a single access protocol.\n   The 1993 version of the X.500\
    \ standard has already been implemented\n   in several products. It is an enhancement\
    \ over the 1988 standard in\n   several ways, but has not been implemented in\
    \ the NameFLOW-Paradise\n   infrastructure yet.  The main reason is that the standard\
    \ doesn't\n   recognize the existence of a single root DSA, but assumes that the\n\
    \   managers of first-level DSAs (the country DSA's) make bilateral\n   contracts\
    \ for interconnection. In the case of NameFLOW-Paradise such\n   a situation would\
    \ be unmanageable. In [13] an enhancement of the 1993\n   standard is proposed\
    \ that makes a single root possible. As soon as\n   implementations of [13] are\
    \ available, NameFLOW-Paradise will\n   experiment with 1993 DSAs. This is expected\
    \ in 1997.\n   Once these developments reach stability, they may be referenced\
    \ by\n   later versions of this BCP document.\n"

  - "13.  Security considerations\n   The security implications of having a directory\
    \ are many.\n   -    People will have a standard way to access the information\n\
    \        published.\n   -    People will be able to gather parts of the information\
    \ for\n        purposes you never intended (like publishing directories,\n   \
    \     building search engines, headhunting or making harassing\n        phone\
    \ calls).\n   -    People will attempt to access more of the information than\n\
    \        you intended to publish, by trying to break security\n        functions\
    \ or eavesdropping on conversations other users have\n        with the Directory.\n\
    \   -    If modification over the Net is possible, people will attempt\n     \
    \   to change your information in unintended ways. Sometimes\n        users will\
    \ change data by mistake, too; not all undesired\n        change is malicious.\n\
    \   The first defense for directory security is to limit your publication\n  \
    \ to stuff you can live with having publicly available, whatever\n   happens.\n\
    \   The second defense involves trying to impose access control. LDAP\n   supports\
    \ a few access control methods, including the use of cleartext\n   passwords.\
    \ Cleartext passwords are not a secure mechanism in the\n   presence of eavesdroppers;\
    \ this document encourages use of stronger\n   mechanisms if modification is made\
    \ available over the open Internet.\n   Otherwise, modification rights should\
    \ be restricted to the local\n   intranet.\n   The third defense involves trying\
    \ to prevent \"inappropriate\" access\n   to the directory such as limiting the\
    \ number of returned search items\n   or refuse list operations where they are\
    \ not useful to prevent\n   \"trolling\". Such defenses are rarely completely\
    \ successful, because\n   it is very hard to set limits that differentiate between\
    \ an innocent\n   user doing wasteful searching and a malicous data troller doing\n\
    \   carefully limited searches.\n   Future enhancements may include using encrypted\
    \ sessions, public key\n   logins and signed requests; such mechanisms are not\
    \ generally\n   available today.\n"
