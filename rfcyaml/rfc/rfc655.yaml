  - "2. Command meanings\n   In the following, we are discussing a simplex connection,\
    \ as described in \n   the NAOL and NAOP Telnet Options specifications.\n    \
    \  IAC DO NAOFFD\n         The data sender requests or agrees to negotiate about\
    \ output\n         formfeed disposition with the data receiver.  In the case\n\
    \         where agreement has been reached and in the absence of\n         further\
    \ subnegotiations, the data receiver is assumed to be\n         handling output\
    \ formfeeds.\n      IAC DON'T NAOFFD\n         The data sender refuses to negotiate\
    \ about output formfeed\n         disposition with the data receiver, or demands\
    \ a return to\n         the unnegotiated default mode.\n      IAC WILL NAOFFD\n\
    \         The data receiver requests or agrees to negotiate about\n         output\
    \ formfeed disposition with the sender.  In the case\n         where agreement\
    \ has been reached and in the absence of\n         further subnegotiations, the\
    \ data receiver alone is assumed\n         to be handling output formfeeds.\n\
    \      IAC WON'T NAOFFD\n         The data receiver refuses to negotiate about\
    \ output formfeed\n         disposition, or demands a return to the unnegotiated\
    \ default\n         mode.\n      IAC SB NAOFFD DS <8-bit value> IAC SE\n     \
    \    The data sender specifies, with the 8-bit value, which party\n         should\
    \ handle formfeeds and what their disposition should be.\n         The code for\
    \ DS is 1.\n      IAC SB NAOFFD DR <8-bit value> IAC SE\n         The data receiver\
    \ specifies, with the 8-bit value, which\n         party should handle formfeeds\
    \ and what their disposition\n         should be.  The code for DR is 0.\n"

  - "3. Default\n   DON'T NAOFFD/WON'T NAOFFD\n      In the default absence of negotiations\
    \ concerning which party, data \n      sender or data receiver, is handling output\
    \ formfeeds, neither party\n      is required to handle formfeeds and neither\
    \ party is prohibited from \n      handling them; but it is appropriate if at\
    \ least the data receiver \n      handles formfeed considerations, albeit primitively.\n\
    \   DS and DR SB commands as follows:\n      8-bit value                     \
    \ Meaning                       \n      0            Command sender suggests that\
    \ he alone will handle  \n                   formfeeds, for the connection.  \
    \                   \n      1 to 250     Command sender suggests that the other\
    \ party alone \n                   should handle formfeeds, but suggests that\
    \ the\n                   indicated value be used.  The value is the number  \n\
    \                   of character-times to wait or number of NULs to    \n    \
    \               insert in the data stream before sending the next\n          \
    \         data character.\n      251          Command sender suggests that the\
    \ other party alone \n                   handle formfeeds, but suggests that each\
    \           \n                   occurrence of the character be replaced by  \
    \       \n                   carriage-return/line-feed.                      \
    \   \n      252          Command sender suggests that the other party alone \n\
    \                   handle formfeeds, but suggests that they be        \n    \
    \               discarded.                                         \n      253\
    \          Command sender suggests that the other party alone \n             \
    \      should handle formfeeds, but suggests that         \n                 \
    \  formfeeds be simulated.                            \n      254          Command\
    \ sender suggests that the other party alone \n                   should handle\
    \ output formfeeds but suggests        \n                   waiting for a character\
    \ to be transmitted (on the  \n                   other simplex connection) before\
    \ sending more      \n                   data. Note that, due to the assynchrony\
    \ of the two \n                   simplex connections, phase problems can occur\
    \ with \n                   this option.                                     \
    \  \n      255          Command sender suggests that the other party alone \n\
    \                   should handle output formfeeds and suggests        \n    \
    \               nothing about how it should be done. \n   The guiding rules are\
    \ that: \n      1) if neither data receiver nor data sender wants to handle output\
    \ \n      formfeeds, the data receiver must do it, and\n      2) if both data\
    \ receiver and data sender want to handle output\n      formfeeds, the data sender\
    \ gets to do it. \n   The reasoning for the former rule is that if neither wants\
    \ to do\n   it, then the default in the NAOFFD option dominates.  If both want\n\
    \   to do it, the sender, who is presumed to have special knowledge\n   about\
    \ the data, should be allowed to do it, taking into account any\n   suggestions\
    \ the receiver may make.  Simulation is defined as the\n   replacement of the\
    \ formfeed character by enough line-feeds (only)\n   to advance the paper (or\
    \ line-pointer) to the top of the next page\n   (or to the top of the terminal\
    \ screen).  Note that delays,\n   controlled by the data sender, must consist\
    \ of NUL characters\n   inserted immediately after the formfeed character.  This\
    \ is\n   necessary due to the assynchrony of network transmission.  As with\n\
    \   all option negotiations, neither party should suggest a state\n   already\
    \ in effect except to refuse to negotiate; changes should be\n   acknowledged;\
    \ and once refused, an option should not be resuggested\n"
