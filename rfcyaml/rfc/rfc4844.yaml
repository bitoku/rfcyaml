- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The first Request for Comments (RFC) document was published\
    \ in April\n   of 1969 as part of the effort to design and build what we now know\
    \ of\n   as the Internet.  Since then, the RFC Series has been the archival\n\
    \   series dedicated to documenting Internet technical specifications,\n   including\
    \ both general contributions from the Internet research and\n   engineering community\
    \ as well as standards documents.\n   As described in the history of the first\
    \ 30 years of RFCs\n   ([RFC2555]), the RFC Series was created for the purpose\
    \ of capturing\n   the research and engineering thought that underlie the design\
    \ of\n   (what we now know of as) the Internet.  As the Internet Engineering\n\
    \   Task Force (IETF) was formalized to carry out the discussion and\n   documentation\
    \ of Internet standards, IETF documents have become a\n   large part (but not\
    \ the entirety) of the RFC Series.\n   As the IETF has grown up and celebrated\
    \ its own 20 years of history,\n   its requirements for archival publication of\
    \ its output have changed\n   and become more rigorous.  Perhaps most significantly,\
    \ the IETF must\n   be able to define (based on its own open consensus discussion\n\
    \   processes and leadership directions) and implement adjustments to its\n  \
    \ publication processes.\n   At the same time, the Internet engineering and research\
    \ community as\n   a whole has grown and come to require more openness and\n \
    \  accountability in all organizations supporting it.  More than ever,\n   this\
    \ community needs an RFC Series that is supported (operationally\n   and in terms\
    \ of its principles) such that there is a balance of:\n   o  expert implementation;\n\
    \   o  clear management and direction -- for operations and evolution\n      across\
    \ the whole RFC Series (whether originating in the IETF or\n      not); and\n\
    \   o  appropriate community input into and review of activities.\n   Today, there\
    \ is confusion and therefore sometimes tension over where\n   and how to address\
    \ RFC issues that are particular to contributing\n   groups (e.g., the IETF, the\
    \ Internet Architecture Board (IAB), or\n   independent individuals).  It isn't\
    \ clear where there should be\n   community involvement versus RFC Editor control;\
    \ depending on the\n   issue, there might be more or less involvement from the\
    \ IAB, the\n   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), or the community at\n\
    \   large.  There are similar issues with handling RFC Series-wide issues\n  \
    \ -- where to discuss and resolve them in a way that is balanced across\n   the\
    \ whole series.\n   For example, there are current discussions about Intellectual\n\
    \   Property Rights (IPR) for IETF-generated documents, but it's not\n   clear\
    \ when or how to abstract the portions of those discussions that\n   are relevant\
    \ to the rest of the RFC Series.  Discussions of labeling\n   (of RFCs in general,\
    \ IETF documents in particular, or some\n   combination thereof) generally must\
    \ be applied on an RFC Series-wide\n   basis or not at all.  Without an agreed-on\
    \ framework for managing the\n   RFC Series, it is difficult to have those discussions\
    \ in a non-\n   polarized fashion -- either the IETF dictating the reality of\
    \ the\n   rest of the RFC Series, or the RFC Series imposing undue restrictions\n\
    \   on the IETF document series.\n   As part of its charter (see Appendix A),\
    \ the IAB has a responsibility\n   for the RFC Editor.  Acknowledging the IETF's\
    \ and the general\n   Internet engineering and research community's evolving needs,\
    \ the IAB\n   would like to see a future for the RFC Series that continues to\
    \ meet\n   its original mandate of providing the archival series for the\n   technical\
    \ research and engineering documentation that describes the\n   Internet.\n  \
    \ With this document, the IAB provides the framework for the RFC Series\n   and\
    \ an RFC Editor function with the specific purpose of ensuring that\n   the RFC\
    \ Series is maintained and supported in ways that are\n   consistent with the\
    \ stated purpose of the RFC Series and the\n   realities of today's Internet research\
    \ and engineering community.\n   The framework describes the existing \"streams\"\
    \ of RFCs, draws a\n   roadmap of existing process documents already defining\
    \ the\n   implementation, and provides clear direction of how to evolve this\n\
    \   framework and its supporting pieces through discussion and future\n   document\
    \ revision.\n   Specifically, this document provides a brief charter for the RFC\n\
    \   Series, describes the role of the RFC Editor, the IAB, and the IETF\n   Administrative\
    \ Support Activity (IASA) in a framework for managing\n   the RFC Series, and\
    \ discusses the streams of input to the RFC Series\n   from the various constituencies\
    \ it serves.\n"
- title: 2.  RFC Series Mission
  contents:
  - "2.  RFC Series Mission\n   The RFC Series is the archival series dedicated to\
    \ documenting\n   Internet technical specifications, including general contributions\n\
    \   from the Internet research and engineering community as well as\n   standards\
    \ documents.\n   RFCs are available free of charge to anyone via the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.  Roles and Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "3.  Roles and Responsibilities\n   As this document sets out a revised framework\
    \ for supporting the RFC\n   Series mission, this section reviews the updated\
    \ roles and\n   responsibilities of the entities that have had, and will have,\n\
    \   involvement in continued support of the mission.\n"
- title: 3.1.  RFC Editor
  contents:
  - "3.1.  RFC Editor\n   Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of\
    \ the RFC\n   Series (the RFC Editor).  The task has grown, and the work now\n\
    \   requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC\n   Editors,\
    \ or an RFC Editor organization.  In time, there may be\n   multiple organizations\
    \ working together to undertake the work\n   required by the RFC Series.  For\
    \ simplicity's sake, and without\n   attempting to predict how the role might\
    \ be subdivided among them,\n   this document refers to this collection of experts\
    \ and organizations\n   as the \"RFC Editor\".\n   The RFC Editor is an expert\
    \ technical editor and series editor,\n   acting to support the mission of the\
    \ RFC Series.  As such, the RFC\n   Editor is the implementer handling the editorial\
    \ management of the\n   RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes.\
    \  In addition,\n   the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover\
    \ in\n   discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving\n \
    \  RFCs.\n"
- title: 3.2.  IAB
  contents:
  - "3.2.  IAB\n   In this model, the role of the IAB is to ensure that the RFC Series\n\
    \   mission is being appropriately fulfilled for the whole community for\n   which\
    \ it was created.  The IAB does not, organizationally, have\n   comprehensive\
    \ publishing or editorial expertise.  Therefore, the role\n   of the IAB as put\
    \ forward in this document is focused on ensuring\n   that principles are met,\
    \ the appropriate bodies and communities are\n   duly informed and consulted,\
    \ and the RFC Editor has what it needs in\n   order to execute on the material\
    \ that is in their mandate.\n   It is the responsibility of the IAB to approve\
    \ the appointment of the\n   RFC Editor and to approve the general policy followed\
    \ by the RFC\n   Editor.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Operational Oversight
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Operational Oversight\n   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (BCP\
    \ 101, [BCP101]) was\n   created to provide administrative support for the IETF,\
    \ the IAB, and\n   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).  In its role of supporting\n\
    \   the IAB, the IASA is tasked with providing the funding for and\n   operational\
    \ oversight of the RFC Editor.\n   The IAOC (IETF Administrative Oversight Committee)\
    \ is the oversight\n   board of the IASA, and the IAD (IETF Administrative Director)\
    \ is the\n   chief actor for the IASA.\n   The IAOC works with the IAB to identify\
    \ suitable persons or entities\n   to fulfill the mandate of the RFC Editor.\n\
    \   The IAOC establishes appropriate contractual agreements with the\n   selected\
    \ persons or entities to carry out the work that will satisfy\n   the technical\
    \ publication requirements defined for the various RFC\n   input streams (see\
    \ Section 5.2).  The IAOC may define additional\n   operational requirements and\
    \ policies for management purposes to meet\n   the requirements defined by the\
    \ various communities.\n   In accordance with BCP 101, the IAOC provides oversight\
    \ of the\n   operation of the RFC Editor activity based on the established\n \
    \  agreements.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Policy Oversight
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Policy Oversight\n   The IAB monitors the effectiveness of the policies\
    \ in force and their\n   implementation to ensure that the RFC Editor activity\
    \ meets the\n   editorial management and document publication needs as referenced\
    \ in\n   this document.  In the event of serious non-conformance, the IAB,\n \
    \  either on its own initiative or at the request of the IAOC, may\n   require\
    \ the IAOC to vary or terminate and renegotiate the\n   arrangements for the RFC\
    \ Editor activity.\n"
- title: 4.  Framework
  contents:
  - "4.  Framework\n   With the RFC Series mission outlined above, this document describes\
    \ a\n   framework for supporting\n   o  the operational implementation of the\
    \ RFC Series,\n   based on\n   o  public process and definition documents,\n \
    \  for which there are\n   o  clear responsibilities and mechanisms for update\
    \ and change.\n   Generally speaking, the RFC Editor is responsible for the operational\n\
    \   implementation of the RFC Series.  As outlined in Section 3.3, the\n   IAD\
    \ provides the oversight of this operational role.\n   The process and definition\
    \ documents are detailed below, including\n   responsibility for the individual\
    \ process documents (maintenance and\n   update).  The RFC Editor works with the\
    \ appropriate community to\n   ensure that the process documents reflect current\
    \ requirements.  The\n   IAB is charged with the role of verifying that appropriate\
    \ community\n   input has been sought and that any changes appropriately account\
    \ for\n   community requirements.\n   There are 3 categories of activity, and\
    \ a 4th category of series-wide\n   rules and guidelines, described for implementing\
    \ the RFC Series to\n   support its mission:\n   o  Approval of documents.\n \
    \  o  Editing, processing, and publication of documents.\n   o  Archiving and\
    \ indexing the documents and making them accessible.\n   o  Series rules and guidelines.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Document Approval
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Document Approval\n   The RFC Series mission implicitly requires that documents\
    \ be reviewed\n   and approved for acceptance into the series.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Definition
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Definition\n   Section 5.1 describes the different streams of documents\
    \ that are put\n   to the RFC Editor for publication as RFCs today.  While there\
    \ may be\n   general policies for approval of documents as RFCs (to ensure the\n\
    \   coherence of the RFC Series), there are also policies defined for the\n  \
    \ approval of documents in each stream.  Generally speaking, there is a\n   different\
    \ approving body for each stream.  The current definitions\n   are catalogued\
    \ in Section 5.1.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Operational Implementation
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Operational Implementation\n   Each stream has its own documented approval\
    \ process.  The RFC Editor\n   is responsible for the approval of documents in\
    \ one of the streams\n   (Independent Submission stream, see Section 5.1.4) and\
    \ works with the\n   other approving bodies to ensure smooth passage of approved\
    \ documents\n   into the next phases, ultimately to publication and archiving\
    \ as an\n   RFC.\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  Process Change
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  Process Change\n   From time to time, it may be necessary to change the\
    \ approval\n   processes for any given stream, or even add or remove streams.\
    \  This\n   may occur when the RFC Editor, the IAB, the body responsible for a\n\
    \   given stream of documents, or the community determines that there are\n  \
    \ issues to be resolved in general for RFC approval or for per-stream\n   approval\
    \ processes.\n   In this framework, the general approach is that the IAB will\
    \ work\n   with the RFC Editor and other parties to get community input and it\n\
    \   will verify that any changes appropriately account for community\n   requirements.\n"

- title: 5.  RFC Streams
  contents:
  - "5.  RFC Streams\n   Various contributors provide input to the RFC Series.  These\n\
    \   contributors come from several different communities, each with its\n   own\
    \ defined process for approving documents that will be published by\n   the RFC\
    \ Editor.  This is nothing new; however, over time the various\n   communities\
    \ and document requirements have grown and separated.  In\n   order to promote\
    \ harmony in discussing the collective set of\n   requirements, it is useful to\
    \ recognize each in their own space --\n   and they are referred to here as \"\
    streams\".\n   Note that by identifying separate streams, there is no intention\
    \ of\n   dividing them or undermining their management as one series.  Rather,\n\
    \   the opposite is true -- by clarifying the constituent parts, it is\n   easier\
    \ to make them work together without the friction that sometimes\n   arises when\
    \ discussing various requirements.\n   The subsections below identify the streams\
    \ that exist today.  There\n   is no immediate expectation of new streams being\
    \ created and it is\n   preferable that new streams NOT be created.  Creation\
    \ of streams and\n   all policies surrounding general changes to the RFC Series\
    \ are\n   discussed above in Section 4.\n"
- title: 5.1.  RFC Approval Processes
  contents:
  - "5.1.  RFC Approval Processes\n   Processes for approval of documents (or requirements)\
    \ for each stream\n   are defined by the community that defines the stream.  The\
    \ IAB is\n   charged with the role of verifying that appropriate community input\n\
    \   has been sought and that the changes are consistent with the RFC\n   Series\
    \ mission and this overall framework.\n   The RFC Editor is expected to publish\
    \ all documents passed to it\n   after appropriate review and approval in one\
    \ of the identified\n   streams.\n"

    \ as well as\n   \"individual submissions\" sponsored by an IESG area director.\
    \  Any\n   document being published as part of the IETF standards process must\n\
    \   follow this stream -- no other stream can approve Standards-Track or\n   Best\
    \ Current Practice (BCP) RFCs.\n   Approval of documents in the IETF stream is\
    \ defined by\n   o  the IETF standards process (RFC 2026 [RFC2026] and its\n \
    \     successors).\n   o  the IESG process for sponsoring individual submissions\
    \ [SPONSOR]).\n   Changes to the approval process for this stream are made by\

    \ stream is\n   defined to provide review and (possible) approval of documents\
    \ that\n   are outside the scope of the streams identified above.\n   Generally\
    \ speaking, approval of documents in this stream falls under\n   the purview of\
    \ the RFC Editor, and the RFC Editor seeks input to its\n   review from the IESG.\n\
    \   The process for reviewing and approving documents in the Independent\n   Submission\
    \ stream is defined by\n   o  Independent Submissions to the RFC Editor (RFC 4846\
    \ [RFC4846]).\n   o  The IESG and RFC Editor Documents: Procedures (RFC 3932\n\

- title: 5.2.  RFC Technical Publication Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.2.  RFC Technical Publication Requirements\n   The Internet engineering and\
    \ research community has not only grown,\n   it has become more diverse, and sometimes\
    \ more demanding.  The IETF,\n   as a standards-developing organization, has publication\
    \ requirements\n   that extend beyond those of an academic journal.  The IAB does\
    \ not\n   have the same interdependence with IANA assignments as the IETF\n  \
    \ stream does.  Therefore, there is the need to both codify the\n   publishing\
    \ requirements of each stream, and endeavor to harmonize\n   them to the extent\
    \ that is reasonable.\n   Therefore, it is expected that the community of effort\
    \ behind each\n   document stream will outline their technical publication\n \
    \  requirements.\n   As part of the RFC Editor oversight, the IAB must agree that\
    \ the\n   requirements are consistent with and implementable as part of the RFC\n\
    \   Editor activity.\n"

    \   historically been substantive -- whether it is supposed to be\n   directly\
    \ responsible for the RFC Series' editorial management (circa\n   1992, Appendix\
