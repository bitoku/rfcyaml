- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the architecture of OMA Mobile Email\
    \ (MEM)\n   using Internet Mail protocols defined by the IETF.  The LEMONADE\n\
    \   working group has enhanced many of these protocols for use in the\n   mobile\
    \ environment.  The LEMONADE profile [PROFILE] and its revision,\n   [PROFILE-bis],\
    \ summarize such protocols and protocol use.  This\n   document shows how the\
    \ OMA MEM Requirements document [MEM-req], OMA\n   MEM Architecture [MEM-arch],\
    \ and OMA MEM Technical Specification\n   [MEM-ts] relate to the work of LEMONADE\
    \ in the IETF.\n"

    \     Figure 1: Basic OMA MEM Logical Architecture\n   Figure 1 identifies the\
    \ following elements:\n   o  The MEM client that implements the client-side functionality\
    \ of\n      the OMA Mobile Email enabler.  It is also responsible for\n      providing\
    \ the mobile email user experience and interface to the\n      user and storing\
    \ the email and data to be sent to the MEM server\n      when not connected.\n\
    \   o  The MEM server that implements the server-side functionality of\n     \
    \ the OMA Mobile Email (MEM) enabler.\n   o  The MEM protocol between the MEM\
    \ client and MEM server.  It is\n      responsible for all the in-band data exchanges\
    \ that take place\n      between the MEM client and server in order to update\
    \ the MEM\n      client with email server changes and the email server with changes\n\
    \      in the MEM client, and in order to send new email from the email\n    \
    \  server.\n   o  Other OMA enablers that are needed to directly support the Mobile\n\
    \      Email enabler.  They are out of the scope of the IETF but may\n      include\
    \ support for:\n      *  Client provisioning and management for over-the-air\n\
    \         installation of the MEM client on the device, provisioning of\n    \
    \     the client settings, and revocation of client privileges.\n      *  Messaging\
    \ enablers for out-of-band notification, where out-of-\n         band notifications\
    \ that are server-to-client event exchanges\n         are not transported by the\
    \ MEM protocol but via other channels.\n      *  Billing, charging, and so on.\n\
    \   OMA identifies different interfaces:\n   o  ME-1: MEM client interface to\
    \ interact via the MEM protocol with\n      the MEM server.\n   o  ME-2: Corresponding\
    \ interface of the MEM server.\n   o  ME-3: Out-of-band MEM server interfaces;\
    \ for example, to support\n      generation of server-to-client notifications.\n\
    \   o  ME-4: Out-of-band MEM client interfaces (e.g., to receive server-\n   \
    \   to-client notifications).\n   o  ME-5: Interface for management of MEM enabler\
    \ server settings,\n      user preferences, and filters, globally and per account.\n\
    \   The MEM server enables an email server.  In a particular\n   implementation,\
    \ the email server may be packaged with (internal to\n   it) the MEM server or\
    \ be a separate component.  In such cases,\n   interfaces to the email server\
    \ are out of scope of the OMA MEM\n   specifications.  In the present document,\
    \ we focus on the case where\n   the backend consists of IETF IMAP and SUBMIT\
    \ servers.  However, we\n   also discuss the relationship to other cases.  The\
    \ I2 interface is an\n   OMA notation to designate protocol / interfaces that\
    \ are not\n   specified by the MEM enabler but may be standardized elsewhere.\n"

    \   intermediaries.  MEM proxies may be involved in front of a firewall\n   that\

    \ where:\n   o  All components are within the same domain, such as in a mobile\n\
    \      operator.\n   o  The MEM client and other enablers are in the mobile operator\n\

    \ for the mechanism.\n   However, some additional details that are outside the\
    \ scope of the\n   IETF will also be included.\n   OMA provides ways to perform\
    \ provisioning via OMA client provisioning\n   and device management.  Other provisioning\
    \ specifications are\n   available (e.g., SMS based).\n   OMA provides enablers\

    \  In such case, the I2 interface between the MEM server\n   components and the\
    \ IMAP store and SUBMIT server are IMAP and SUBMIT\n   without LEMONADE extensions.\n\
    \   It is important to note the realizations are of a schematic nature\n   and\
    \ do not dictate actual implementation.  For example, one could\n   envision collocating\
    \ the LEMONADE MEM enabler server and the submit\n   server shown in Figure 4\
    \ in a single instantiation of the\n   implementation.  Likewise, we consciously\
    \ label the LEMONADE MEM\n   enabler as neither an IMAP proxy nor an IMAP back-to-back\
    \ user agent.\n   LEMONADE leaves the actual implementation to the developer.\n\

    \ Architecture\n   In Figure 6, we define four categories of filters:\n   o  AF:\
    \ Administrative Filters - The email service provider usually\n      sets administrative\
    \ filters.  The user typically does not\n      configure AF.  AF applies policies\
    \ covering content filtering,\n      virus protection, spam filtering, etc.\n\
    \   o  DF: Deposit Filters - Filters that are executed on deposit of new\n   \
    \   emails.  They can be defined as SIEVE filters [SIEVE].  They can\n      include\
    \ vacation notices [RFC5230].  As SIEVE filters, one can\n      administer them\
    \ using the SIEVE management protocol [MANAGESIEVE].\n   o  VF: View Filters -\
    \ Filters that define which emails are visible to\n      the MUA.  View filters\
    \ can be performed via IMAP using the\n      facilities described in [NOTIFICATIONS].\n\
    \   o  NF: Notification Filters - Filters that define for what email\n      server\
    \ event an out-of-band notification is sent to the client, as\n      described\
    \ in [NOTIFICATIONS].\n   Refer to the aforementioned references for implementation\
    \ and\n   management of the respective filters.\n"
