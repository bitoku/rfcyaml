  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document reports our findings from a historical survey\
    \ of the\n   Internet mobility research and standardization efforts since the\n\
    \   early 1990s.  Our survey was motivated by two factors.  First,\n   supporting\
    \ mobility over the Internet has been an active research\n   area and has produced\
    \ a variety of solutions, some of which have\n   become the Internet standards.\
    \  Yet, new issues continue to arise and\n   new solutions continue to be developed\
    \ to address them, making one\n   wonder how much more we have yet to discover\
    \ about the problem space\n   as well as the solution space.  The second factor\
    \ is the rapid growth\n   in Internet access via mobile devices in recent years,\
    \ which will\n   inevitably lead to new Internet application development in the\
    \ coming\n   years and further underscore the importance of Internet mobility\n\
    \   support.  We believe that a historical review of all the proposed\n   solutions\
    \ on the table can help us not only identify their\n   commonalities and differences\
    \ but also clarify remaining issues and\n   shed insight on future efforts.\n\
    \   In this document, we provide an overview of mobility support\n   solutions\
    \ from the early results to the most recent proposals.  In\n   the process, we\
    \ also discuss the essential components in mobility\n   support and analyze the\
    \ design space.  Through sharing our\n   understanding of the current stage of\
    \ the art, we aim to initiate an\n   open discussion about the general direction\
    \ for future mobility\n   support.\n   Note that the solutions discussed in this\
    \ document are proposed\n   designs.  They have been implemented in many cases,\
    \ but only a few\n   have been widely deployed in the Internet.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms to refer to the entities\
    \ or\n   functions that are required in mobility support.  Readers are\n   expected\
    \ to be familiar with RFC 3753 \"Mobility Related Terminology\"\n   [RFC3753]\
    \ before reading this document.\n   Identifier:  A stable value that can be used\
    \ to identify a mobile\n           node.  Any unique value can be used as an Identifier\
    \ as long\n           as it is topologically and geographically independent, i.e.,\n\
    \           remains unchanged when the mobile node roams around.\n   Locator:\
    \  The IP address that indicates the mobile node's current\n           attachment\
    \ point to the Internet.  It could be the IP address\n           of the mobile\
    \ node itself or the IP address of the network\n           entity that is currently\
    \ serving the mobile node.\n   Mapping:  In this document, mapping specifically\
    \ means the mapping\n           between a mobile's Identifier and its Locator.\n\
    \   Rendezvous Point (RP):  The place where the mapping is held.  Some\n     \
    \      other functions such as data forwarding may also be co-\n           located\
    \ on the rendezvous point.\n   Global Mobility Management:  A system that keeps\
    \ track of each\n           mobile's reachability when the mobile is moving, either\n\
    \           geographically or topologically, on a global scale.\n   Local Mobility\
    \ Management:  A system that keeps track of each\n           mobile's reachability\
    \ within a topologically scoped local\n           domain.  It keeps the mobile's\
    \ local movements transparent to\n           all entities that are outside of\
    \ the local scope.\n   Operator-Controlled Mobility Management:  The mobile node\
    \ itself is\n           unaware of mobility management.  Instead, certain network\n\
    \           entities, which are controlled by the network operators,\n       \
    \    perform all the mobility-related signaling job on behalf of\n           the\
    \ mobile node.\n   User-Controlled Mobility Management:  The mobile node participates\
    \ in\n           the mobility management.  Typically, the mobile updates its\n\
    \           reachability information after it changes locations and\n        \
    \   refreshes its reachability at a user-defined frequency.\n"
- title: 3.  Basic Components in Mobility Support Protocols
  contents:
  - "3.  Basic Components in Mobility Support Protocols\n   The basic question in\
    \ Internet mobility support is how to send data\n   to a moving receiver (a mobile,\
    \ in short).  Note that here we do not\n   distinguish between mobile nodes and\
    \ mobile subnets.  We call the\n   host that sends data to a mobile the Correspondent\
    \ Node (CN).  To\n   send data to a moving receiver M, the CN must have means\
    \ to obtain\n   M's latest IP address (solution type-1) or be able to reach M\
    \ using a\n   piece of stable information, where \"stable\" means that the\n \
    \  information does not change as the mobile moves (solution type-2).\n   Among\
    \ the existing solutions, a few fall under type-1, and most of\n   them use DNS\
    \ as the means to provide the CN with the mobile's most\n   current IP address\
    \ information.  The rest of the existing solutions\n   fall under type-2, which\
    \ must provide the function to reach the\n   mobile's dynamically changing location\
    \ by using that unchanged\n   Identifier of the mobile known to the CN.  We can\
    \ summarize all the\n   mobility support solutions as essentially involving three\
    \ basic\n   components:\n   o  a stable Identifier for a mobile;\n   o  a Locator,\
    \ which is usually an IP address representing the\n      mobile's current location;\
    \ and\n   o  a mapping between the two.\n   We show in the next section that different\
    \ mobility support designs\n   are merely different approaches to provide mapping\
    \ between the\n   Identifiers and the mobiles' current IP addresses.  In type-1\n\
    \   solutions, the stable Identifier of a mobile is its DNS name, the\n   Locator\
    \ is its current IP address, and the DNS server provides the\n   mapping function.\
    \  In type-2 solutions, because the CN must be able\n   to reach the mobile using\
    \ the stable Identifier, the Identifier\n   itself is typically an IP address;\
    \ either the network can dynamically\n   find a path to reach the mobile or the\
    \ IP address leads to the \"home\"\n   of the mobile that knows the mobile's current\
    \ Locator and can thus\n   forward the CN's packets to the mobile.  All the type-2\
    \ solutions\n   face two common issues.  One issue is how to carry out this\n\
    \   forwarding task, given the original packet sent by the CN has the\n   mobile's\
    \ \"home address\" as the destination; the other issue is how to\n   avoid triangle\
    \ routing between the CN, the home location, and the\n   mobile.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Columbia Protocol
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Columbia Protocol\n   This protocol [Columbia] was originally designed\
    \ to provide mobility\n   support on a campus.  A router called Mobile Support\
    \ Station (MSS) is\n   set up in each wireless cell and serves as the default\
    \ access router\n   for all mobile nodes in that cell.  The Identifier for a mobile\
    \ node\n   is an IP address derived from a special IP prefix, and the mobile\n\
    \   node uses this IP address regardless of the cell to which it belongs.\n  \
    \ Each MSS keeps a tracking list of mobile nodes that are currently in\n   its\
    \ cell by periodically broadcasting beacons.  The mobile replies to\n   the MSS\
    \ with a message containing its stable Identifier and its\n   previous MSS when\
    \ it receives the beacon from a new MSS.  The new MSS\n   is responsible to notify\
    \ the old MSS that a mobile has left its cell.\n   Each MSS also knows how to\
    \ reach other MSSs (e.g., all MSSs could be\n   in one multicast group, or a list\
    \ of IP addresses of all MSSs could\n   be statically configured for each MSS).\n\
    \   When a CN sends a packet to a mobile node, the packet goes to the MSS\n  \
    \ nearest to the CN (MC), which either has the mobile node in the same\n   cell\
    \ and can deliver directly or broadcasts a query to all other MSSs\n   and gets\
    \ a reply from the MSS (MM) with the mobile node.  If it is\n   the latter case,\
    \ MC tunnels the packet to MM, which will finally\n   deliver the packet to the\
    \ mobile node.\n   Hence, in this scheme, CN uses the Identifier to reach the\
    \ mobile.\n   It largely avoids triangle routing because the router next to CN\
    \ is\n   mobility-aware and can intercept CN's data destined to the mobile and\n\
    \   forward to destination MSS.  Since a mobile keeps the same IP address\n  \
    \ independent from its movement, mobility does not affect TCP\n   connections.\n\
    \   An illustration of the Columbia Protocol is shown in Figure 2.\n         \

- title: 4.2.  VIP

  - "4.2.  VIP\n   Virtual Internet Protocol [VIP] has two basic ideas.  First, a\
    \ packet\n   carries both Identifier and Locator; second, the Identifier is an\
    \ IP\n   address that leads to the home network where the mapping is kept.\n \
    \  The IP header is modified to allow packets sent by a mobile to carry\n   two\
    \ IP addresses: a Virtual IP address (Identifier) and a regular IP\n   address\
    \ (Locator).  Every time the mobile node changes its location,\n   it notifies\
    \ the home network with its latest IP address.  A mobile's\n   virtual address\
    \ never changes and can be used to support TCP\n   connections independent of\
    \ mobility.\n   To deliver data to a mobile, the CN first uses the mobile's Virtual\n\
    \   IP address as the destination IP address, i.e., the Locator is set to\n  \
    \ be the same as the Identifier.  As a result, the packet goes to the\n   home\
    \ network and the Home Agent redirects the packet to mobile's\n   current location\
    \ by replacing the regular IP destination address\n   field with the mobile's\
    \ current address.\n   To reduce triangle routing, the design lets CNs and routers\
    \ learn and\n   cache the Identifier-Locator mapping carried in the packets from\n\
    \   mobile nodes.  When a CN receives a packet from the mobile, it learns\n  \
    \ the mobile's current location from the regular IP source address\n   field.\
    \  The CN keeps the mapping and uses the Locator as the\n   destination in future\
    \ exchanges with the mobile.  Similarly, if a\n   router along the data path to\
    \ a mobile finds out that the mapping\n   carried in the packet differs from the\
    \ mapping cached by the router,\n   it changes the destination IP address field\
    \ to its cached value.\n   This router-caching solution is expected to increase\
    \ the chance that\n   packets destined to the mobile get forwarded to the mobile's\
    \ current\n   location directly, by paying a cost of having all routers examine\
    \ and\n   cache all the mobile's Identifier-Locator mappings.\n   Figure 3 shows\
    \ how the VIP Protocol works.\n                                       ,---.  \

  - "4.3.  Loose Source Routing (LSR) Protocol\n   In the Loose Source Routing (LSR)\
    \ Protocol [LSR], each mobile has a\n   designated router, called a Mobile Router,\
    \ that manages its mobility.\n   The Mobile Router assigns an IP address (used\
    \ as an Identifier) for\n   each mobile it manages and announces reachability\
    \ to those IP\n   addresses.  Another network entity in the LSR design is Mobile\
    \ Access\n   Station (MAS), through which a mobile gets its connectivity to the\n\
    \   Internet.  The mobile node reports the IP address of its current\n   serving\
    \ MAS (Locator) to its Mobile Router.\n   The CN uses the Identifier to reach\
    \ the mobile node in the first\n   place.  If the CN and the mobile node are attached\
    \ to the same MAS,\n   the MAS simply forwards packets between the two (in this\
    \ case CN is\n   also mobile); otherwise, the packet from CN is routed to the\
    \ Mobile\n   Router of the mobile.  The Mobile Router looks up the mappings to\n\
    \   find the serving MAS of the mobile node and inserts the loose source\n   routing\
    \ (LSR) option into the IP header of the packet with the IP\n   address of the\
    \ MAS on it.  In this way, the packet is redirected to\n   the MAS, which then\
    \ delivers the packet to the mobile.  To this\n   point, the Locator of the mobile\
    \ node is already included in the LSR\n   option, and the two parties can communicate\
    \ directly by reversing the\n   LSR option in the incoming packet.  Hence, the\
    \ path for the first\n   packet from CN to the mobile is CN->Mobile Router->MAS->mobile\
    \ node,\n   and then the bidirectional path for the following packets is mobile\n\
    \   node <->MAS<->CN.\n   Triangle routing is avoided by revealing the mobile's\
    \ Locator to the\n   CN in the LSR option.\n   Figure 4 shows the basic operation\

- title: 4.4.  Mobile IP
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Mobile IP\n   The IETF began standards development in mobility support\
    \ soon after\n   the above three protocols.  The first version of the Mobile IP\n\
    \   standard was developed in 1996.  Later, the IETF developed the Mobile\n  \
    \ IPv4 [RFC3344] and Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] standards in 2002 and 2004,\n   respectively.\
    \  In 2010, the Mobile IPv4 standard was revised\n   [RFC5944].  In 2009, Dual-Stack\
    \ Mobile IPv4 [RFC5454] was\n   standardized to allow a dual-stack node to use\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 home\n   addresses and to move between IPv4 and dual-stack network\n\
    \   infrastructures.\n   Although the three documents differ in details, the high-level\
    \ design\n   is similar.  Here we use Mobile IPv6 as an example.  Each mobile\
    \ node\n   has a Home Agent (HA), from which it acquires its Home Address (HoA),\n\
    \   the Identifier.  The mobile node also obtains its Locator, a Care-of\n   Address\
    \ (CoA), from its current access router.  Whenever the mobile\n   node gets a\
    \ new CoA, it sends a Binding Update message to notify the\n   Home Agent.  Conceptually,\
    \ Mobile IPv6 design looks similar to the\n   VIP Protocol, with the mobile's\
    \ HoA corresponding to the Virtual IP\n   Address in VIP and the CoA corresponding\
    \ to the regular IP address.\n   The CN uses the mobile's HoA as the destination\
    \ IP address when\n   sending data to a mobile.  The packets are forwarded to\
    \ the Home\n   Agent, which then encapsulates the packets to mobile node's CoA\n\
    \   according to the mapping.\n   To alleviate triangle routing, the CN, if it\
    \ supports Route\n   Optimization, also keeps the mapping between the mobile's\
    \ HoA and\n   CoA.  Thus, the CN can encapsulate packets to the mobile directly,\n\
    \   without going through the Home Agent.  Note that in this case, the\n   mobile\
    \ needs to update its CoA to CNs as well.\n   Figure 5 illustrates the data path\
    \ of Mobile IPv6 without Route\n   Optimization.\n                           \

- title: 4.5.  HMIP
  contents:
  - "4.5.  HMIP\n   Hierarchical Mobile IP (HMIP) [RFC5380] is a simple extension\
    \ to\n   Mobile IP.  It aims to improves the performance of Mobile IP by\n   handling\
    \ mobility within a local region locally.  A level of\n   hierarchy is added to\
    \ Mobile IP in the following way.  A Mobility\n   Anchor Point (MAP) is responsible\
    \ for handling the movements of a\n   mobile in a local region.  Simply speaking,\
    \ MAP is the local Home\n   Agent for the mobile node.  The mobile node, if it\
    \ supports HMIP,\n   obtains a Regional CoA (RCoA) and registers it with its Home\
    \ Agent as\n   its current CoA; while RCoA is the Locator for the mobile in Mobile\n\
    \   IP, it is also its regional Identifier used in HMIP.  At the same\n   time,\
    \ the mobile obtains a Local CoA (LCoA) from the subnet to which\n   it attaches.\
    \  When roaming within the region, a mobile only updates\n   the MAP with the\
    \ mapping between its RCoA and LCoA.  In this way, the\n   handoff performance\
    \ is usually better due to the shorter round-trip\n   time between the mobile\
    \ and the MAP, as compared to the delay between\n   the mobile and its HA.  It\
    \ also reduces the burden of the Home Agents\n   by reducing the frequency of\

  - "4.6.  FMIPv6\n   Fast Handover for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [RFC5568] is another\
    \ extension\n   to Mobile IP, which reduces the Binding Update latency as well\
    \ as the\n   IP connectivity latency.  It is not a fully fledged mobility support\n\
    \   protocol; rather, its only purpose is to optimize the performance of\n   Mobile\
    \ IP.\n   This goal is achieved by three mechanisms.  First, it enables a\n  \
    \ mobile node to detect that it has moved to a new subnet while it is\n   still\
    \ connected to the current subnet by providing the new access\n   point and the\
    \ corresponding subnet prefix information.  Second, a\n   mobile node can also\
    \ formulate a prospective New Care-of Address\n   (NCoA) when it is still present\
    \ on the previous link so that this\n   address can be used immediately after\
    \ it attaches to the new subnet\n   link.  Third, to reduce the Binding Update\
    \ interruption, FMIP\n   specifies a tunnel between the Previous Care-of Address\
    \ (PCoA) and\n   the NCoA.  The mobile node sends a Fast Binding Update to the\n\
    \   previous access router (PAR) after the handoff, and PAR begins to\n   tunnel\
    \ packets with PCoA as the destination to NCoA.  These packets\n   would have\
    \ been dropped if the tunnel were not established.  In the\n   reverse direction,\
    \ the mobile node also tunnels packets to PAR until\n   it finishes the Binding\
    \ Update process (the mobile node can only use\n   PCoA now because the binding\
    \ in HA or the correspondent nodes may\n   have not been updated yet).\n"

  - "4.7.  NEMO\n   It is conceivable to have a group of hosts moving together.  Consider\n\
    \   vehicles such as ships, trains, or airplanes that may host a network\n   with\
    \ multiple hosts.  Because Mobile IP handles mobility per host, it\n   is not\
    \ efficient when handling such mobility scenarios.  Network\n   Mobility (NEMO)\
    \ [RFC3963], as a backward-compatible extension to\n   Mobile IP, was introduced\

    \ one Mobile Router.  A Mobile Router is\n   similar to a mobile node in Mobile\

- title: 4.8.  Mobility Support Using Multicast in IP (MSM-IP)
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Mobility Support Using Multicast in IP (MSM-IP)\n   MSM-IP [MSM-IP] stands\
    \ for Mobility Support using Multicast in IP.\n   As one can see from its name,\
    \ MSM-IP leverages IP multicast routing\n   for mobility support.  In IP multicast,\
    \ a host can join a group\n   regardless of the network to which it attaches and\
    \ receive packets\n   sent to the group after its join.  Thus, mobility is naturally\n\
    \   supported in the domains where IP multicast is deployed.  Note that\n   MSM-IP\
    \ does not address the issue of the feasibility of supporting\n   mobility through\
    \ IP multicast; rather, it simply shows the\n   possibility of using IP multicast\
    \ to provide mobility support once/if\n   IP multicast is universally deployed.\n\
    \   MSM-IP [MSM-IP] assigns each mobile node a unique multicast IP\n   address\
    \ as the Identifier.  When the mobile node moves into a new\n   network, it initiates\
    \ a join to its own address, which makes the\n   multicast router in that subnet\
    \ join the multicast distribution tree.\n   Whoever wants to communicate with\
    \ the mobile node can just send the\n   data to the mobile's multicast IP address,\
    \ and the multicast routing\n   will take care of the rest.\n   Note that, due\
    \ to the nature of multicast routing, the mobile node\n   can have the new multicast\
    \ router join the group to cache packets in\n   advance before it detaches the\
    \ old one, resulting in smoother\n   handoff.\n"
- title: 4.9.  Cellular IP, HAWAII, and TIMIP
  contents:
  - "4.9.  Cellular IP, HAWAII, and TIMIP\n   This is a group of protocols that share\
    \ the common idea of setting up\n   a host route for each mobile in the local\
    \ domain.  The mobile retains\n   a stable IP address as long as it is within\
    \ the local domain, and\n   this IP address is used as a regional Identifier.\
    \  The gateway router\n   of the local domain will use this Identifier to reach\
    \ the mobile\n   node.  All three protocols are intended to work with Mobile IP\
    \ as a\n   local mobility management protocol.  By describing them together, we\n\
    \   can more easily show the differences by comparison.\n   Cellular IP [CIP]\
    \ handles the local mobility in a network consisting\n   of Cellular IP routers.\
    \  A mobile reports the IP address of the\n   gateway for the local network as\
    \ the RCoA to its Home Agent and\n   retains its locally assigned IP address (the\
    \ regional Identifier)\n   when it roams within the Cellular IP network.  The\
    \ routers in the\n   network monitor the packets originating from mobile nodes\
    \ and\n   maintain a distributed, hop-by-hop reverse path for each mobile node.\n\
    \   Cellular IP utilizes the paging technique from the cellular network\n   to\
    \ track the location of each mobile: idle mobile nodes send dummy\n   packets\
    \ to the gateway router with a relatively low frequency to\n   update their reverse\
    \ paths in the routers.  The outdated path will\n   not be cleared explicitly\
    \ after the mobile changes its location;\n   instead, it will be flushed by the\
    \ routers if the paging timer\n   expires before the next dummy packet comes.\
    \  To reduce the paging\n   cost, only a subset of the routers would set up a\
    \ reverse path for\n   the idle mobile nodes.\n   When a packet from the CN arrives\
    \ at the gateway, the gateway\n   initiates a controlled flooding query.  If a\
    \ router knows where to\n   forward a packet, it forwards it immediately; otherwise,\
    \ it forwards\n   the packet to all its interfaces except the one from which the\
    \ packet\n   came.  Due to the paging technique, this will not become a broadcast.\n\
    \   Once the mobile receives the query, it replies with a route-update\n   message\
    \ to the gateway, and a much more precise reverse path is then\n   maintained\
    \ by all the routers along the data path, via which the\n   gateway router forwards\
    \ packets from CN to the mobile.  Note that the\n   timer value for the precise\
    \ data path is much smaller than the paging\n   timer value, in order to avoid\
    \ sending duplicate data packets to\n   multiple places if the mobile moves during\
    \ the data communication.\n   Similarly, Handoff-Aware Wireless Access Internet\
    \ Infrastructure\n   (HAWAII) [HAWAII] also aims to provide efficient local mobility\n\
    \   support.  Unlike Cellular IP, the route between the gateway router\n   and\
    \ the mobile is always maintained.  When the mobile moves, HAWAII\n   dynamically\
    \ modifies the route to the mobile by installing a host-\n   based forwarding\
    \ entry on the routers located along the shortest path\n   between the old and\
    \ new base stations of the mobile.  It is possible\n   that a longer suboptimal\
    \ routing path will be constructed (e.g.,\n   gateway router->old base station->new\
    \ base station->mobile).\n   Alternatively, a new sub-path between the mobile\
    \ and the cross-over\n   router can be established.  Here, the cross-over router\
    \ is the router\n   at the intersection of two paths, one between the gateway\
    \ and the old\n   base station and the second between the old base station and\
    \ the new\n   base station.  In HAWAII, the mobile only periodically sends refresh\n\
    \   messages to the base station, and the base station along with other\n   routers\
    \ take care of the path maintenance.\n   TIMIP [TIMIP], which stands for Terminal\
    \ Independent Mobile IP,\n   integrated the design of Cellular IP and HAWAII.\
    \  On one hand, it\n   refreshes the routing paths with dummy packets if the mobile\
    \ node is\n   idle.  On the other hand, handoff within a domain results in the\n\
    \   changes of routing tables in the routers.  Besides, the IP layer is\n   coupled\
    \ with layer 2 handoff mechanisms, and special nodes can work\n   as Mobile IP\
    \ proxies for legacy mobiles that do not support Mobile\n   IP.  Thus, as long\
    \ as the mobile roams within the domain, the legacy\n   node has the same degree\
    \ of mobility support as a Mobile-IP-capable\n   node.\n"

    \ existing DNS\n   service to track a mobile node's current location.  The stable\n\
    \   Identifier here is the domain name of the mobile.  The mobile uses\n   Dynamic\

- title: 4.13.  Connexion and WINMO
  contents:
  - "4.13.  Connexion and WINMO\n   Connexion [Boeing] was a mobility support service\
    \ provided by Boeing\n   that uses BGP to support network mobility.  Every mobile\
    \ network is\n   assigned a /24 IP address prefix (stable Identifier), and the\
    \ CN uses\n   this Identifier to reach the moving network, which means that the\n\
    \   global routing system is responsible for finding a path to the mobile\n  \
    \ network.  When an airplane moves between its access routers on the\n   ground,\
    \ it withdraws its prefix from the previous access router and\n   announces the\
    \ prefix via the new access point.  As a result, the\n   location change of the\
    \ plane is effectively propagated to the rest of\n   the world.  However, if the\
    \ number of moving networks becomes large,\n   the amount of BGP updates will\
    \ also increase proportionally,\n   resulting in severe global routing dynamics.\n\
    \   WINMO [WINMO] (which stands for Wide-Area IP Network Mobility) was\n   introduced\
    \ in 2008 to address the routing update overhead problem of\n   Connexion.  Like\
    \ Connexion, WINMO also assigns each mobile network a\n   stable prefix.  However,\
    \ through two new approaches, WINMO can reduce\n   the BGP updates overhead for\
    \ mobile networks by orders of magnitude\n   lower than those of Connexion.  First,\
    \ WINMO uses various heuristics\n   to reduce the propagation scope of routing\
    \ updates caused by mobile\n   movements.  Consequently, not every router may\
    \ know all the mobiles'\n   current locations.  Handling this issue led to the\
    \ second and more\n   fundamental approach taken by WINMO: it adopts the basic\
    \ idea from\n   Mobile IP by assigning each mobile network a \"home\" in the following\n\
    \   way.  WINMO assigns each mobile network a prefix out of a small set\n   of\
    \ well-defined Mobile Prefixes.  These Mobile Prefixes are announced\n   by a\
    \ small set of Aggregation Routers, which also keep track of the\n   mobile network's\
    \ current locations.  Therefore, these Aggregation\n   Routers play a similar\
    \ role to Home Agents in Mobile IP and can be\n   counted on as a last resort\
    \ to reach mobile networks globally.\n   To prevent frequent Interior Border Gateway\
    \ Protocol (iBGP) routing\n   updates due to the movement of mobile networks within\
    \ an Autonomous\n   System (AS), WINMO also introduces a Home Agent for the Mobile\n\
    \   Prefixes: only a Designated BGP-speaking Router (DBR) acts as the\n   origin\
    \ of Mobile Prefixes, and mobile networks always update the\n   addresses of their\
    \ access routers (intra-AS Locators) with DBR, which\n   resembles the binding\
    \ updates in Mobile IP.  Thus, packets destined\n   to mobile networks are forwarded\
    \ to DBR after they enter the border\n   of an AS, and DBR will tunnel them to\
    \ the current locations of mobile\n   networks.\n   A new BGP community attribute,\
    \ which includes the mobile network's\n   intra-AS Locator in each packet, is\
    \ also defined to eliminate the\n   triangle-routing problem caused by DBR.  The\
    \ border routers of the AS\n   can tunnel packets directly to the mobile network\
    \ based on the new\n   attribute.\n"

    \   IPv6 header.  Essentially, it breaks an IPv6 address into two\n   components:\
    \ high-order 64 bits as a Locator and low-order 64 bits as\n   an Identifier.\
    \  The Identifier identifies a host, instead of an\n   interface, and is used\
    \ in upper-layer protocols (e.g., TCP, FTP); on\n   the other hand, the Locator\

    \  All the Home Agents join an IP anycast group and form an\n   overlay network.\
    \  The same home prefix is announced by all the Home\n   Agents from different\

    \ existing protocols, we identified several\n   different directions for mobility\
    \ support.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Routing-Based Approach versus Mapping-Based Approach
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Routing-Based Approach versus Mapping-Based Approach\n   All existing mobility\
    \ support designs can be broadly classified into\n   two basic approaches.  The\
    \ first one is to support mobility through\n   dynamic routing.  In such designs,\
    \ a mobile keeps its IP address\n   regardless of its location changes; thus,\
    \ the IP address can be used\n   both to identify the mobile and to deliver packets\
    \ to it.  As a\n   result, these designs do not need an explicit mapping function.\n\
    \   Rather, the routing system must continuously keep track of a mobile's\n  \
    \ movements and reflect its current position in the network on the\n   routing\
    \ table so that at any given moment packets carrying the\n   (stable) receiver's\
    \ IP address can be delivered to the right place.\n   It is also worthwhile to\
    \ identify two sub-classes in routing-based\n   approaches.  One is broadcast\
    \ based, and the other is path based.  In\n   the former case, either the mobile's\
    \ location information is actively\n   broadcasted to the whole network or a proactive\
    \ broadcast query is\n   needed to obtain the location information of a mobile\
    \ (e.g., Columbia\n   and Connexion); in the latter case, on the other hand, a\
    \ host-based\n   path is maintained by the routing system instead (e.g., Cellular\
    \ IP,\n   HAWAII, and TIMIP).\n   Supporting mobility through dynamic routing\
    \ is conceptually simple;\n   it can also provide robust and efficient data delivery,\
    \ assuming that\n   the routing system can keep up with the mobile movements.\
    \  However,\n   because either the whole network must be informed of every movement\n\
    \   by every mobile or a host-based path must be maintained for every\n   mobile\
    \ host, this approach is feasible only in small-scale networks\n   with a small\
    \ number of mobiles; it does not scale well in large\n   networks or for a large\
    \ number of mobiles.\n   The second approach to mobility support is to provide\
    \ a mapping\n   between a mobile's stable Identifier and its dynamically changing\
    \ IP\n   address.  Instead of notifying the world on every movement, a mobile\n\
    \   only needs to update a single binding location about its location\n   changes.\
    \  In this approach, if one level of indirection at IP layer\n   is used, as in\
    \ the case of Mobile IP, it has a potential side effect\n   of introducing triangle\
    \ routing; otherwise, if the two end nodes are\n   aware of each other's movement,\
    \ it means that both ends have to\n   support the same mobility protocol.\n  \
    \ Yet, there is the third case in which the protocols combine the above\n   approaches\
    \ in the hope of keeping the pros and eliminating some cons\n   of the two.  WINMO\
    \ is a typical protocol in this case.\n   In Figure 8, we show the classification\

- title: 5.2.  Mobility-Aware Entities
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Mobility-Aware Entities\n   Among the various design choices, a critical\
    \ one is how many entities\n   are assumed to be mobility-aware.  There are four\
    \ parties that may be\n   involved during a conversation with a mobile: the mobile\
    \ itself, CN,\n   the network, and the Home Agent or its equivalent (additional\n\
    \   component to the existing IP network that holds the mapping).  We\n   mainly\
    \ focus our discussion on the mapping-based approach here.\n   The first design\
    \ choice is to hide the mobility from the CN, based on\n   the assumption that\
    \ the CN may be the legacy node that does not\n   support mobility.  In this approach,\
    \ the IP address that is used as\n   the mobile's Identifier points to the Home\
    \ Agent or its equivalent\n   that keeps track of the mobile's current location.\
    \  If a\n   correspondent node wants to send packets to a mobile node, it sets\
    \ in\n   the destination field of IP header an IP address, which is a mobile's\n\
    \   Identifier.  The packets will be delivered to the location where the\n   mapping\
    \ information of the mobile is kept, and later they will be\n   forwarded to the\
    \ mobile's current location via either encapsulation\n   or destination address\
    \ translation.  Mobile IP and most of its\n   extensions, as well as several other\
    \ protocols fall into this design.\n   The second design choice is to hide the\
    \ mobility from the mobile and\n   CN, which is based on a more conservative assumption\
    \ that both the\n   mobile and the CN do not support mobility.  Protocols like\
    \ PMIP and\n   TIMIP adopt this design.  The protocol operations in this design\n\
    \   resemble those in the first category, but a significant difference is\n  \
    \ that here the mobility-related signaling (e.g., the update Locator to\n   the\
    \ Home Agent) is handled by the entities in the network rather than\n   by the\
    \ mobile itself.  Hence, the mobile blissfully assumes that it\n   is always in\
    \ the same subnet.\n   The third one is to let both the mobile and the CN be mobility-aware.\n\
    \   As a result, the network is not aware of the mobility, and no\n   additional\
    \ component is required.  As an increasing number of mobile\n   devices are connected\
    \ to the Internet (Why hide mobility from them?),\n   this design choice seems\
    \ to be more and more appealing.  One common\n   approach taken by this design\

    \ and quite\n   reliable, and makes the mobility support protocol simple and easy\
    \ to\n   deploy.  Protocols like E2E, ILNP, and BTMM fall into this design.\n\
    \   Although HIP adds special-purpose rendezvous servers to the network\n   to\
    \ replace the role of DNS, both mobile and CN are still mobility-\n   aware; hence,\
    \ it is also classified in this category.\n   Figure 9 shows the three categories\

  - "5.3.  Operator-Controlled Approach versus User-Controlled Approach\n   At the\
    \ time of this writing, cellular networks are providing the\n   largest operational\
    \ global mobility support, using a service model\n   that bundles together device\
    \ control, network access control, and\n   mobility support.  The tremendous success\
    \ of the cellular market\n   speaks loudly that the current cellular service model\
    \ is a viable one\n   and is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. \
    \ Consequently,\n   there is a strong advocate in the IETF that we continue the\
    \ cellular\n   way of handling mobility, i.e., instead of letting mobile devices\n\
    \   participate in the mobility-related signaling themselves, the network\n  \
    \ entities deployed by the operators should take care of any and all\n   signaling\
    \ processes of mobility support.  A typical example along\n   this direction is\
    \ Proxy Mobile IP, in which LMA works together with\n   MAGs to assure the reachability\
    \ to the mobile using its Home\n   Prefixes, as long as the mobile roams within\
    \ the same provider's\n   domain.\n   One main reason for this approach is perhaps\
    \ backward compatibility.\n   By not requiring the participation of mobiles in\
    \ the control-\n   signaling process, it avoids any changes to the mobile nodes\
    \ so that\n   the mobile nodes can stay simple and all the legacy nodes can obtain\n\
    \   the same level of mobility services as the latest mobile devices.\n   According\
    \ to the claim of 3G vendors and operators, transparent\n   mobility support is\
    \ a key aspect for success as they learn from their\n   deployment experience.\n\
    \   On the other hand, most of the mobility support protocols surveyed in\n  \
    \ this document focus on mobility support only, assuming mobiles\n   already obtained\
    \ network access.  Mobile nodes typically update their\n   locations themselves\
    \ to the rendezvous points chosen by the users,\n   and, of course, only the nodes\
    \ implementing one of these solutions\n   can benefit from mobility support. \
    \ However, this class of protocols\n   does offer users and mobile devices more\
    \ flexibility and freedom,\n   e.g., they can choose whatever mobility services\
    \ are available as\n   long as their software supports that protocol, and they\
    \ can also tune\n   the parameters to get the services that are most suitable\
    \ to them.\n"

  - "5.4.  Local and Global-Scale Mobility\n   The work done on mobility management\
    \ can also be divided into two\n   categories according to scale: local mobility\
    \ management and global\n   mobility management.\n   Global mobility management\
    \ is typically supposed to support mobility\n   of an unlimited number of nodes\
    \ in a geographically as well as\n   topologically large area.  Consequentially,\
    \ it pays a lot of\n   attention to scalability issues.  For the availability\
    \ concern, it\n   also tries to avoid failure of single point.\n   Local mobility\
    \ management, on the other hand, is designed to work\n   together with global\
    \ mobility management and thus focuses more on\n   performance issues, such as\
    \ handoff delay, handoff loss, local data\n   path, etc.  Since it is typically\
    \ used on a small scale with a not-\n   so-large number of mobile nodes, sometimes\
    \ the designers can use some\n   fine-tuned mechanisms that are not scaled with\
    \ a large network (such\n   as host route) to improvement performance.  As a side\
    \ effect of local\n   mobility management, the number of location updates sent\
    \ by mobile\n   nodes to their global rendezvous points is substantially reduced.\n\
    \   Thus, the existence of local mobility management also contributes to\n   the\
    \ scalability of global mobility management.\n   One problem of local mobility\
    \ management is that it often requires\n   infrastructure support, such as MAGs\
    \ in PMIP or MAPs in HMIP.  These\n   kinds of local devices are essentially required\
    \ in all small domains,\n   which can be a huge investment.\n   Nevertheless,\
    \ mobility management in two scales make it possible for\n   designers to design\
    \ protocols that fit into specific user\n   requirements; it also enables the\
    \ gradual deployment of local\n   enhancement while not losing the ability of\
    \ global roaming.  The\n   coexistence of the two seems to be a right choice in\
    \ the foreseeable\n   future.\n   Figure 10 shows the classification of the studied\

  - "5.5.  Other Mobility Support Efforts\n   Despite the wide spectrum of mobility\
    \ solutions covered by this\n   survey, the list of mobility protocols is not\
    \ exhaustive.\n   The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol [GTP]\
    \ is a\n   network-based mobility support solution widely used in cellular\n \
    \  networks.  Its implementation only involves Gateway GPRS Support Node\n   (GGSN)\
    \ and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).  It allows end users of\n   a Global System\
    \ for Mobile Communications (GSM) or Universal Mobile\n   Telecommunications System\
    \ (UMTS) network to move from place to place\n   while remaining connected to\
    \ the Internet as if from on location at\n   the GGSN.  It does this by carrying\
    \ the subscriber's data from the\n   subscriber's current SGSN to the GGSN that\
    \ is handling the\n   subscriber's session.  To some extent, it is the non-IETF\
    \ variant of\n   PMIP, with GGSN resembling LMA and SGSN resembling MAG, respectively.\n\
    \   There is also work on application-layer mobility support, most\n   notably\
    \ SIP-based mobility support [ALM-SIP].  SIP was initially\n   designed as an\
    \ application signaling protocol for multimedia, and\n   later researchers noticed\
    \ its potential capability for mobility\n   support.  When the mobile initiates\
    \ a session with CN, normal SIP-\n   signaling procedure is performed to establish\
    \ the session.  When the\n   mobile moves to a new network while the session is\
    \ ongoing, it send a\n   RE-INVITE message with the existing session but reveals\
    \ the new IP\n   address to the CN.  The home SIP server is also updated with\
    \ the\n   latest location information of the mobile after the move.  However,\n\
    \   the SIP-based approach cannot maintain TCP connections when the\n   mobile's\
    \ IP address changes.\n   A lot of enhancements to Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization\
    \ have also\n   been developed.  A comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of these\n\
    \   efforts can be found in [RFC4651].\n"

- title: 6.1.  Deployment Issues
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Deployment Issues\n   Among the various protocols we discussed in this\
    \ document, few have\n   been deployed in commercial networks.  There are several\
    \ reasons to\n   explain this situation.\n   First, although the research community\
    \ started to develop mobility\n   support protocols 20 years ago, only in recent\
    \ years has the number\n   of mobiles soared.  Hence, operators did not see the\
    \ incentive of\n   deploying mobility support protocols several years back.  As\
    \ of\n   today, the number of mobiles is still growing by leaps and bounds,\n\
    \   and there is enough user demand for the operators to seriously\n   consider\
    \ the deployment of mobility support protocols.\n   Second, the complexity of\
    \ most mobility support protocols impedes the\n   implementation and hence the\
    \ deployment in commercial networks.  The\n   complexity arises from multiple\
    \ aspects.  One is the optimizations on\n   performance.  The other is the problem\
    \ with the use of security\n   protocols such as IPsec and IKE.  The discussions\
    \ regarding to these\n   two problems are still ongoing in the MEXT Working Group.\
    \  Some\n   researchers argue that the research community should design a \"barely\n\
    \   work\" version of a mobility support protocol first, without\n   considering\
    \ nice performance features and complex security\n   mechanisms, roll it out in\
    \ the real world, and improve it thereafter.\n   However, there are different\
    \ views on what the essential features are\n   and which security mechanisms are\
    \ better.\n   Third, almost all the mobility support protocols assume that the\n\
    \   mobile nodes have network connectivity anywhere, anytime.  In\n   reality,\
    \ however, this is not always the case.  Nevertheless,\n   wireless access is\
    \ available in more and more places, and it is\n   foreseeable that in the near\
    \ future, the coverage of wireless access\n   in different forms (WiFi, Wimax,\
    \ 3G/4G) will be ubiquitous.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Session Continuity and Simultaneous Movements
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Session Continuity and Simultaneous Movements\n   In order for users to\
    \ benefit from mobility support, it is important\n   to keep the TCP sessions\
    \ uninterrupted by the mobility.  If the\n   durations of the sessions are short\
    \ (e.g., web browsing), the\n   probability is high that the TCP sessions finish\
    \ before the handover\n   happens; even if the TCP session is interrupted by the\
    \ handover, the\n   cost is usually low (e.g., refresh the web page).  However,\
    \ if the\n   TCP sessions are typically long (e.g., downloading large files and\n\
    \   voice calls), the interruptions during the handover would become\n   unacceptable.\n\
    \   It is hard to predict tomorrow's applications, but most mobility\n   support\
    \ protocols try to keep the sessions up during movements.  For\n   routing-based\
    \ protocols, session continuity is not a problem since\n   the IP address of the\
    \ mobile never changes.  For other protocols,\n   either a stable IP address (e.g.,\
    \ HoA) or an equivalent (e.g., HIT)\n   is used in the transport layer so that\
    \ the mobility is hidden, or TCP\n   is modified so that both ends can change\
    \ IP addresses while keeping\n   the established session (e.g., E2E).\n   Another\
    \ concern is the support of simultaneous movements.  In some\n   scenarios, only\
    \ one end is mobile, and the other end is always\n   static; moreover, the communication\
    \ between the two is always\n   initiated by the mobile end.  A lot of applications\
    \ as of today fall\n   into this category.  Typically, the server side is static,\
    \ and the\n   client is mobile; usually, the client would contact the server first.\n\
    \   Hence, in these scenarios, the support of simultaneous movements is\n   not\
    \ a requirement.  However, in other scenarios, both ends may be\n   moving at\
    \ the same time.  For example, during a voice call, two\n   mobile nodes may experience\
    \ handovers simultaneously.  In this case,\n   a rendezvous point is necessary\
    \ to keep the current locations of the\n   mobiles so that they can find each\
    \ other after a simultaneous\n   movement.  Besides, if a static server wants\
    \ to push information to a\n   mobile client, a rendezvous point is also required.\n\
    \   It is clear that the number of mobile devices is rapidly growing, and\n  \
    \ more mobiles are going to provide content in the near future.  Hence,\n   the\
    \ simultaneous-movements scenarios are considered important.  In\n   fact, almost\
    \ all the mobility support protocols are equipped with\n   rendezvous points,\
    \ either by adding dedicated components or by\n   leveraging the existing DNS\
    \ systems.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Trade-Offs of Design Choices on Mobility Awareness
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Trade-Offs of Design Choices on Mobility Awareness\n   The mobility awareness\
    \ at two communicating ends is closely related\n   to the backward-compatibility\
    \ problem.  The Internet has been running\n   for more than two decades, and the\
    \ scale of the Internet gets so\n   large that it is impossible to upgrade the\
    \ whole system overnight.\n   As a result, it is also not possible for a mobility\
    \ support system\n   designer to overlook this problem: how does one decide the\
    \ mobility\n   awareness in the protocol design, and how important is backward\n\
    \   compatibility?\n   In the following text, we discuss the trade-offs of the\
    \ design\n   choices mentioned in Section 5.2.\n   The advantage of the first\
    \ design choice is that the mobile does not\n   lose the ability to communicate\
    \ with legacy nodes while roaming\n   around, i.e., the mobile can benefit from\
    \ unilateral deployment of\n   mobility support.  Another potential advantage\
    \ is that the static\n   nodes do not need to be bothered by the mobility of the\
    \ mobiles,\n   which saves resources and could be desirable if the CN is a busy\n\
    \   server.  The disadvantage of this design is also well known: it\n   introduces\
    \ triangle routing, which significantly increases the delays\n   in the worst\
    \ cases.  There are means to remedy the problem, e.g.,\n   Route Optimization\
    \ in Mobile IP if a CN is mobility-capable and\n   distribution of Home Agents\
    \ as Global HAHA does, at the expense of\n   increasing complexity.\n   The second\
    \ design caters to the inertness of the Internet (and the\n   users) by keeping\
    \ everything status quo from the user's point of\n   view.  It is like the cellular\
    \ network, with the smart network and\n   dumb terminals.  The advantage is that\
    \ the legacy nodes can benefit\n   from the mobility support without upgrade.\
    \  However, the cost is also\n   not trivial: the users lose the freedom of control\
    \ in terms of\n   mobility management, and a large number of entities in the network\n\
    \   need to be upgraded.\n   The third design assumes that the other end is likely\
    \ also mobility-\n   capable (as of today, more people are accessing the Internet\
    \ via\n   mobile devices than a desktop) and thus does not provide backward\n\
    \   compatibility at all; however, as a trade-off, the system design\n   becomes\
    \ much simpler, and the data path is always the shortest one.\n   We all know\
    \ that backward compatibility is important in system\n   design.  But how important\
    \ is it?  How much effort should we make for\n   this issue?  At least for now,\
    \ the answer is not yet clear.\n"

    \ going to be heterogeneous.  However, as of\n   today, the interoperation between\

    \ only HIP support,\n   neither of them can benefit from mobility support.\n \

    \ this\n   document examines a wide range of solution proposals, so the security\n\
