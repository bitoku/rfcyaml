- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   SOAP version 1.2 (SOAP) is a lightweight protocol intended\
    \ for\n   exchange of structured information between peers in a decentralized,\n\
    \   distributed environment.  It defines an extensible messaging\n   framework\
    \ that contains a message construct based on XML technologies\n   that can be\
    \ exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols.\n   This specification defines\
    \ the media type \"application/soap+xml\"\n   which can be used to identify SOAP\
    \ 1.2 message envelopes that have\n   been serialized with XML 1.0.  Such serializations\
    \ are useful as the\n   basis of \"wire formats\" for SOAP 1.2 Protocol Binding\
    \ Specifications\n   [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624], or in other situations where\
    \ an XML\n   serialization of a SOAP envelope is required.\n   The \"application/soap+xml\"\
    \ media type explicitly identifies SOAP 1.2\n   message envelopes that have been\
    \ serialised with XML 1.0; message\n   envelopes with a different SOAP namespace\
    \ version or using another\n   XML serialisation MUST NOT use it.\n   The key\
    \ words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"\
    SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n\
    \   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Registration
  contents:
  - "2.  Registration\n   MIME media type name: application\n   MIME subtype name:\
    \ soap+xml\n   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters:\n      \"charset\"\
    : This parameter has identical semantics to the charset\n         parameter of\
    \ the \"application/xml\" media type as specified in\n         RFC 3023 [RFC3023].\n\
    \      \"action\": This optional parameter can be used to specify the URI\n  \
    \       that identifies the intent of the message.  In SOAP 1.2, it\n        \
    \ serves a similar purpose as the SOAPAction HTTP header field\n         did in\
    \ SOAP 1.1.  Namely, its value identifies the intent of\n         the message.\n\
    \         The value of the action parameter is an absolute URI-reference\n   \
    \      as defined by RFC 2396 [RFC2396], which MUST be non-empty.\n         SOAP\
    \ places no restrictions on the specificity of the URI or\n         that it is\
    \ resolvable.  Although the purpose of the action\n         parameter is to indicate\
    \ the intent of the SOAP message there\n         is no mechanism for automatically\
    \ computing the value based on\n         the SOAP envelope.  In other words, the\
    \ value has to be\n         determined out of band.  It is recommended that the\
    \ same value\n         be used to identify sets of message types that are logically\n\
    \         connected in some manner, for example part of the same\n         \"\
    service\".  It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the URI be globally\n         unique\
    \ and stable over time.\n         Use of the action parameter is OPTIONAL.  SOAP\
    \ Receivers MAY\n         use it as a hint to optimize processing, but SHOULD\
    \ NOT require\n         its presence in order to operate.\n   Encoding considerations:\
    \ Identical to those of \"application/xml\" as\n      described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023],\
    \ section 3.2, as applied to the\n      SOAP envelope infoset.\n   Security considerations:\
    \ Because SOAP can carry application defined\n      data whose semantics is independent\
    \ from that of any MIME wrapper\n      (or context within which the MIME wrapper\
    \ is used), one should not\n      expect to be able to understand the semantics\
    \ of the SOAP message\n      based on the semantics of the MIME wrapper alone.\
    \  Therefore,\n      whenever using the \"application/soap+xml\" media type, it\
    \ is\n      strongly RECOMMENDED that the security implications of the context\n\
    \      within which the SOAP message is used is fully understood.  The\n     \
    \ security implications are likely to involve both the specific SOAP\n      binding\
    \ to an underlying protocol as well as the application-\n      defined semantics\
    \ of the data carried in the SOAP message (though\n      one must be careful when\
    \ doing this, as discussed in SOAP 1.2 Part\n      1 [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624],\
    \ section Binding to\n      Application-Specific Protocols).\n      Also, see\
    \ SOAP 1.2 Part 1 [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624], the\n      entire section Security\
    \ Considerations.\n      In addition, as this media type uses the \"+xml\" convention,\
    \ it\n      shares the same security considerations as described in RFC 3023\n\
    \      [RFC3023], section 10.\n      The action parameter is not a security mechanism,\
    \ and SHOULD NOT\n      be used for authentication.  If the action parameter is\
    \ used to\n      make decisions (e.g., dispatch, filtering), it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that\n      the basis for such decisions should be confirmed by examining the\n\
    \      SOAP Envelope.\n   Interoperability considerations: There are no known\
    \ interoperability\n      issues.\n   Published specification: SOAP 1.2 Part 1\n\
    \      [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624] and SOAP 1.2 Part 2\n      [W3C.REC-soap12-part2-20030624].\n\
    \   Applications which use this media type: Various SOAP 1.2 conformant\n    \
    \  toolkits use this media type.\n   Additional information:\n   File extension:\
    \ SOAP messages are not required or expected to be\n      stored as files.\n \
    \  Fragment identifiers: Identical to that of \"application/xml\" as\n      described\
    \ in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 5.\n   Base URI: As specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023],\
    \ section 6.  Also see\n      SOAP 1.2 Part 1 [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624],\
