- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Recent Internet protocols have been carefully designed to\
    \ be easily\n   extensible in certain areas.  In particular, many protocols,\n\
    \   including but not limited to MIME [RFC2045], are capable of carrying\n   arbitrary\
    \ labeled content.  A mechanism is needed to label such\n   content and a registration\
    \ process is needed for these labels, to\n   ensure that the set of such values\
    \ is developed in an orderly, well-\n   specified, and public manner.\n   This\
    \ document defines media type specification and registration\n   procedures that\
    \ use the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as\n   a central registry.\n\
    \   Historical Note\n      The media type registration process was initially defined\
    \ for\n      registering media types for use in the context of the asynchronous\n\
    \      Internet mail environment.  In this mail environment there is a\n     \
    \ need to limit the number of possible media types, to increase the\n      likelihood\
    \ of interoperability when the capabilities of the remote\n      mail system are\
    \ not known.  As media types are used in new\n      environments in which the\
    \ proliferation of media types is not a\n      hindrance to interoperability,\
    \ the original procedure proved\n      excessively restrictive and had to be generalized.\
    \  This was\n      initially done in [RFC2048], but the procedure defined there\
    \ was\n      still part of the MIME document set.  The media type specification\n\
    \      and registration procedure has now been moved to this separate\n      document,\
    \ to make it clear that it is independent of MIME.\n      It may be desirable\
    \ to restrict the use of media types to specific\n      environments or to prohibit\
    \ their use in other environments.  This\n      revision attempts for the first\
    \ time to incorporate such\n      restrictions into media type registrations in\
    \ a systematic way.\n      See Section 4.9 for additional discussion.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n   This specification makes use of the Augmented Backus-Naur\
    \ Form (ABNF)\n   [RFC4234] notation, including the core rules defined in Appendix\
    \ A of\n   that document.\n"
- title: 2.  Media Type Registration Preliminaries
  contents:
  - "2.  Media Type Registration Preliminaries\n   Registration of a new media type\
    \ or types starts with the\n   construction of a registration proposal.  Registration\
    \ may occur\n   within several different registration trees that have different\n\
    \   requirements, as discussed below.  In general, a new registration\n   proposal\
    \ is circulated and reviewed in a fashion appropriate to the\n   tree involved.\
    \  The media type is then registered if the proposal is\n   acceptable.  The following\
    \ sections describe the requirements and\n   procedures used for each of the different\
    \ registration trees.\n"
- title: 3.  Registration Trees and Subtype Names
  contents:
  - "3.  Registration Trees and Subtype Names\n   In order to increase the efficiency\
    \ and flexibility of the\n   registration process, different structures of subtype\
    \ names may be\n   registered to accommodate the different natural requirements\
    \ for,\n   e.g., a subtype that will be recommended for wide support and\n   implementation\
    \ by the Internet community, or a subtype that is used\n   to move files associated\
    \ with proprietary software.  The following\n   subsections define registration\
    \ \"trees\" that are distinguished by the\n   use of faceted names, e.g., names\
    \ of the form\n   \"tree.subtree...subtype\".  Note that some media types defined\
    \ prior\n   to this document do not conform to the naming conventions described\n\
    \   below.  See Appendix A for a discussion of them.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Standards Tree
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Standards Tree\n   The standards tree is intended for types of general\
    \ interest to the\n   Internet community.  Registrations in the standards tree\
    \ MUST be\n   approved by the IESG and MUST correspond to a formal publication\
    \ by a\n   recognized standards body.  In the case of registration for the IETF\n\
    \   itself, the registration proposal MUST be published as an RFC.\n   Standards-tree\
    \ registration RFCs can either be standalone\n   \"registration only\" RFCs, or\
    \ they can be incorporated into a more\n   general specification of some sort.\n\
    \   Media types in the standards tree are normally denoted by names that\n   are\
    \ not explicitly faceted, i.e., do not contain period (\".\", full\n   stop) characters.\n\
    \   The \"owner\" of a media type registration in the standards tree is\n   assumed\
    \ to be the standards body itself.  Modification or alteration\n   of the specification\
    \ requires the same level of processing (e.g.,\n   standards track) required for\
    \ the initial registration.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Vendor Tree
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Vendor Tree\n   The vendor tree is used for media types associated with\
    \ commercially\n   available products.  \"Vendor\" or \"producer\" are construed\
    \ as\n   equivalent and very broadly in this context.\n   A registration may be\
    \ placed in the vendor tree by anyone who needs\n   to interchange files associated\
    \ with the particular product.\n   However, the registration formally belongs\
    \ to the vendor or\n   organization producing the software or file format being\
    \ registered.\n   Changes to the specification will be made at their request,\
    \ as\n   discussed in subsequent sections.\n   Registrations in the vendor tree\
    \ will be distinguished by the leading\n   facet \"vnd.\".  That may be followed,\
    \ at the discretion of the\n   registrant, by either a media subtype name from\
    \ a well-known producer\n   (e.g., \"vnd.mudpie\") or by an IANA-approved designation\
    \ of the\n   producer's name that is followed by a media type or product\n   designation\
    \ (e.g., vnd.bigcompany.funnypictures).\n   While public exposure and review of\
    \ media types to be registered in\n   the vendor tree is not required, using the\
    \ ietf-types@iana.org\n   mailing list for review is strongly encouraged to improve\
    \ the quality\n   of those specifications.  Registrations in the vendor tree may\
    \ be\n   submitted directly to the IANA.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Personal or Vanity Tree
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Personal or Vanity Tree\n   Registrations for media types created experimentally\
    \ or as part of\n   products that are not distributed commercially may be registered\
    \ in\n   the personal or vanity tree.  The registrations are distinguished by\n\
    \   the leading facet \"prs.\".\n   The owner of \"personal\" registrations and\
    \ associated specifications\n   is the person or entity making the registration,\
    \ or one to whom\n   responsibility has been transferred as described below.\n\
    \   While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in\n   the\
    \ personal tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for\n   review is strongly\
    \ encouraged to improve the quality of those\n   specifications.  Registrations\
    \ in the personal tree may be submitted\n   directly to the IANA.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Special x. Tree
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Special x. Tree\n   For convenience and symmetry with this registration\
    \ scheme, subtype\n   names with \"x.\" as the first facet may be used for the\
    \ same purposes\n   for which names starting in \"x-\" are used.  These types\
    \ are\n   unregistered, experimental, and for use only with the active\n   agreement\
    \ of the parties exchanging them.\n   However, with the simplified registration\
    \ procedures described above\n   for vendor and personal trees, it should rarely,\
    \ if ever, be\n   necessary to use unregistered experimental types.  Therefore,\
    \ use of\n   both \"x-\" and \"x.\" forms is discouraged.\n   Types in this tree\
    \ MUST NOT be registered.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Additional Registration Trees
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Additional Registration Trees\n   From time to time and as required by\
    \ the community, the IANA may, by\n   and with the advice and consent of the IESG,\
    \ create new top-level\n   registration trees.  It is explicitly assumed that\
    \ these trees may be\n   created for external registration and management by well-known\n\
    \   permanent bodies; for example, scientific societies may register\n   media\
    \ types specific to the sciences they cover.  In general, the\n   quality of review\
    \ of specifications for one of these additional\n   registration trees is expected\
    \ to be equivalent to registrations in\n   the standards tree.  Establishment\
    \ of these new trees will be\n   announced through RFC publication approved by\
    \ the IESG.\n"
- title: 4.  Registration Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Registration Requirements\n   Media type registration proposals are all expected\
    \ to conform to\n   various requirements laid out in the following sections. \
    \ Note that\n   requirement specifics sometimes vary depending on the registration\n\
    \   tree, again as detailed in the following sections.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Functionality Requirement
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Functionality Requirement\n   Media types MUST function as an actual media\
    \ format.  Registration of\n   things that are better thought of as a transfer\
    \ encoding, as a\n   charset, or as a collection of separate entities of another\
    \ type, is\n   not allowed.  For example, although applications exist to decode\
    \ the\n   base64 transfer encoding [RFC2045], base64 cannot be registered as a\n\
    \   media type.\n   This requirement applies regardless of the registration tree\n\
    \   involved.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Naming Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Naming Requirements\n   All registered media types MUST be assigned type\
    \ and subtype names.\n   The combination of these names serves to uniquely identify\
    \ the media\n   type, and the format of the subtype name identifies the registration\n\
    \   tree.  Both type and subtype names are case-insensitive.\n   Type and subtype\
    \ names beginning with \"X-\" are reserved for\n   experimental use and MUST NOT\
    \ be registered.  This parallels the\n   restriction on the x. tree, as discussed\
    \ in Section 3.4.\n   Type and subtype names MUST conform to the following ABNF:\n\
    \       type-name = reg-name\n       subtype-name = reg-name\n       reg-name\
    \ = 1*127reg-name-chars\n       reg-name-chars = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"!\" /\n   \
    \                    \"#\" / \"$\" / \"&\" / \".\" /\n                       \"\
    +\" / \"-\" / \"^\" / \"_\"\n   Note that this syntax is somewhat more restrictive\
    \ than what is\n   allowed by the ABNF in [RFC2045].\n   In accordance with the\
    \ rules specified in [RFC3023], media subtypes\n   that do not represent XML entities\
    \ MUST NOT be given a name that ends\n   with the \"+xml\" suffix.  More generally,\
    \ \"+suffix\" constructs should\n   be used with care, given the possibility of\
    \ conflicts with future\n   suffix definitions.\n   While it is possible for a\
    \ given media type to be assigned additional\n   names, the use of different names\
    \ to identify the same media type is\n   discouraged.\n   These requirements apply\
    \ regardless of the registration tree\n   involved.\n   The choice of top-level\
    \ type name MUST take into account the nature\n   of media type involved.  New\
    \ subtypes of top-level types MUST conform\n   to the restrictions of the top-level\
    \ type, if any.  The following\n   sections describe each of the initial set of\
    \ top-level types and\n   their associated restrictions.  Additionally, various\
    \ protocols,\n   including but not limited to MIME, MAY impose additional restrictions\n\
    \   on the media types they can transport.  (See [RFC2046] for additional\n  \
    \ information on the restrictions MIME imposes.)\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Text Media Types
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Text Media Types\n   The \"text\" media type is intended for sending\
    \ material that is\n   principally textual in form.  A \"charset\" parameter MAY\
    \ be used to\n   indicate the charset of the body text for \"text\" subtypes,\
    \ notably\n   including the subtype \"text/plain\", which is a generic subtype\
    \ for\n   plain text defined in [RFC2046].  If defined, a text \"charset\"\n \
    \  parameter MUST be used to specify a charset name defined in\n   accordance\
    \ to the procedures laid out in [RFC2978].\n   Plain text does not provide for\
    \ or allow formatting commands, font\n   attribute specifications, processing\
    \ instructions, interpretation\n   directives, or content markup.  Plain text\
    \ is seen simply as a linear\n   sequence of characters, possibly interrupted\
    \ by line breaks or page\n   breaks.  Plain text MAY allow the stacking of several\
    \ characters in\n   the same position in the text.  Plain text in scripts like\
    \ Arabic and\n   Hebrew may also include facilities that allow the arbitrary mixing\
    \ of\n   text segments with opposite writing directions.\n   Beyond plain text,\
    \ there are many formats for representing what might\n   be known as \"rich text\"\
    .  An interesting characteristic of many such\n   representations is that they\
    \ are to some extent readable even without\n   the software that interprets them.\
    \  It is useful to distinguish them,\n   at the highest level, from such unreadable\
    \ data as images, audio, or\n   text represented in an unreadable form.  In the\
    \ absence of\n   appropriate interpretation software, it is reasonable to present\n\
    \   subtypes of \"text\" to the user, while it is not reasonable to do so\n  \
    \ with most non-textual data.  Such formatted textual data should be\n   represented\
    \ using subtypes of \"text\".\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Image Media Types\n   A media type of \"image\" indicates that the content\

    \ sound.\n   The term 'video' is used in its most generic sense, rather than with\n\
    \   reference to any particular technology or format, and is not meant to\n  \
    \ preclude subtypes such as animated drawings encoded compactly.\n   Note that\
    \ although in general this document strongly discourages the\n   mixing of multiple\
    \ media in a single body, it is recognized that many\n   so-called video formats\
    \ include a representation for synchronized\n   audio and/or text, and this is\
    \ explicitly permitted for subtypes of\n   \"video\".\n"
- title: 4.2.5.  Application Media Types
  contents:
  - "4.2.5.  Application Media Types\n   The \"application\" media type is to be used\
    \ for discrete data that do\n   not fit in any of the media types, and particularly\
    \ for data to be\n   processed by some type of application program.  This is information\n\
    \   that must be processed by an application before it is viewable or\n   usable\
    \ by a user.  Expected uses for the \"application\" media type\n   include but\
    \ are not limited to file transfer, spreadsheets,\n   presentations, scheduling\
    \ data, and languages for \"active\"\n   (computational) material.  (The latter,\
    \ in particular, can pose\n   security problems that must be understood by implementors,\
    \ and are\n   considered in detail in the discussion of the \"application/\n \
    \  PostScript\" media type in [RFC2046].)\n   For example, a meeting scheduler\
    \ might define a standard\n   representation for information about proposed meeting\
    \ dates.  An\n   intelligent user agent would use this information to conduct\
    \ a dialog\n   with the user, and might then send additional material based on\
    \ that\n   dialog.  More generally, there have been several \"active\" languages\n\
    \   developed in which programs in a suitably specialized language are\n   transported\
    \ to a remote location and automatically run in the\n   recipient's environment.\
    \  Such applications may be defined as\n   subtypes of the \"application\" media\
    \ type.\n   The subtype of \"application\" will often be either the name or include\n\
    \   part of the name of the application for which the data are intended.\n   This\
    \ does not mean, however, that any application program name may be\n   used freely\
    \ as a subtype of \"application\".\n"
- title: 4.2.6.  Multipart and Message Media Types
  contents:
  - "4.2.6.  Multipart and Message Media Types\n   Multipart and message are composite\
    \ types, that is, they provide a\n   means of encapsulating zero or more objects,\
    \ each labeled with its\n   own media type.\n   All subtypes of multipart and\
    \ message MUST conform to the syntax\n   rules and other requirements specified\
    \ in [RFC2046].\n"
- title: 4.2.7.  Additional Top-level Types
  contents:
  - "4.2.7.  Additional Top-level Types\n   In some cases a new media type may not\
    \ \"fit\" under any currently\n   defined top-level content type.  Such cases\
    \ are expected to be quite\n   rare.  However, if such a case does arise a new\
    \ top-level type can be\n   defined to accommodate it.  Such a definition MUST\
    \ be done via\n   standards-track RFC; no other mechanism can be used to define\n\
    \   additional top-level content types.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Parameter Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Parameter Requirements\n   Media types MAY elect to use one or more media\
    \ type parameters, or\n   some parameters may be automatically made available\
    \ to the media type\n   by virtue of being a subtype of a content type that defines\
    \ a set of\n   parameters applicable to any of its subtypes.  In either case,\
    \ the\n   names, values, and meanings of any parameters MUST be fully specified\n\
    \   when a media type is registered in the standards tree, and SHOULD be\n   specified\
    \ as completely as possible when media types are registered\n   in the vendor\
    \ or personal trees.\n   Parameter names have the syntax as media type names and\
    \ values:\n       parameter-name = reg-name\n   Note that this syntax is somewhat\
    \ more restrictive than what is\n   allowed by the ABNF in [RFC2045] and amended\
    \ by [RFC2231].\n   There is no defined syntax for parameter values.  Therefore\n\
    \   registrations MUST specify parameter value syntax.  Additionally,\n   some\
    \ transports impose restrictions on parameter value syntax, so\n   care should\
    \ be taken to limit the use of potentially problematic\n   syntaxes; e.g., pure\
    \ binary valued parameters, while permitted in\n   some protocols, probably should\
    \ be avoided.\n   New parameters SHOULD NOT be defined as a way to introduce new\n\
    \   functionality in types registered in the standards tree, although new\n  \
    \ parameters MAY be added to convey additional information that does\n   not otherwise\
    \ change existing functionality.  An example of this\n   would be a \"revision\"\
    \ parameter to indicate a revision level of an\n   external specification such\
    \ as JPEG.  Similar behavior is encouraged\n   for media types registered in the\
    \ vendor or personal trees but is not\n   required.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Canonicalization and Format Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Canonicalization and Format Requirements\n   All registered media types\
    \ MUST employ a single, canonical data\n   format, regardless of registration\
    \ tree.\n   A precise and openly available specification of the format of each\n\
    \   media type MUST exist for all types registered in the standards tree\n   and\
    \ MUST at a minimum be referenced by, if it isn't actually included\n   in, the\
    \ media type registration proposal itself.\n   The specifications of format and\
    \ processing particulars may or may\n   not be publicly available for media types\
    \ registered in the vendor\n   tree, and such registration proposals are explicitly\
    \ permitted to\n   limit specification to which software and version produce or\
    \ process\n   such media types.  References to or inclusion of format\n   specifications\
    \ in registration proposals is encouraged but not\n   required.\n   Format specifications\
    \ are still required for registration in the\n   personal tree, but may be either\

- title: 4.5.  Interchange Recommendations
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Interchange Recommendations\n   Media types SHOULD interoperate across\
    \ as many systems and\n   applications as possible.  However, some media types\
    \ will inevitably\n   have problems interoperating across different platforms.\
    \  Problems\n   with different versions, byte ordering, and specifics of gateway\n\
    \   handling can and will arise.\n   Universal interoperability of media types\
    \ is not required, but known\n   interoperability issues SHOULD be identified\
    \ whenever possible.\n   Publication of a media type does not require an exhaustive\
    \ review of\n   interoperability, and the interoperability considerations section\
    \ is\n   subject to continuing evaluation.\n   These recommendations apply regardless\
    \ of the registration tree\n   involved.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Security Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Security Requirements\n   An analysis of security issues MUST be done for\
    \ all types registered\n   in the standards Tree.  A similar analysis for media\
    \ types registered\n   in the vendor or personal trees is encouraged but not required.\n\
    \   However, regardless of what security analysis has or has not been\n   done,\
    \ all descriptions of security issues MUST be as accurate as\n   possible regardless\
    \ of registration tree.  In particular, a statement\n   that there are \"no security\
    \ issues associated with this type\" MUST\n   NOT be confused with \"the security\
    \ issues associates with this type\n   have not been assessed\".\n   There is\
    \ absolutely no requirement that media types registered in any\n   tree be secure\
    \ or completely free from risks.  Nevertheless, all\n   known security risks MUST\
    \ be identified in the registration of a\n   media type, again regardless of registration\
    \ tree.\n   The security considerations section of all registrations is subject\n\
    \   to continuing evaluation and modification, and in particular MAY be\n   extended\
    \ by use of the \"comments on media types\" mechanism described\n   in Section\
    \ 6 below.\n   Some of the issues that should be looked at in a security analysis\
    \ of\n   a media type are:\n   o  Complex media types may include provisions for\
    \ directives that\n      institute actions on a recipient's files or other resources.\
    \  In\n      many cases provision is made for originators to specify arbitrary\n\
    \      actions in an unrestricted fashion that may then have devastating\n   \
    \   effects.  See the registration of the application/postscript media\n     \
    \ type in [RFC2046] for an example of such directives and how they\n      should\
    \ be described in a media type registration.\n   o  All registrations MUST state\
    \ whether or not they employ such\n      \"active content\", and if they do, they\
    \ MUST state what steps have\n      been taken to protect users of the media type\
    \ from harm.\n   o  Complex media types may include provisions for directives\
    \ that\n      institute actions that, while not directly harmful to the\n    \
    \  recipient, may result in disclosure of information that either\n      facilitates\
    \ a subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's\n      privacy in some way.\
    \  Again, the registration of the\n      application/postscript media type illustrates\
    \ how such directives\n      can be handled.\n   o  A media type that employs\
    \ compression may provide an opportunity\n      for sending a small amount of\
    \ data that, when received and\n      evaluated, expands enormously to consume\
    \ all of the recipient's\n      resources.  All media types SHOULD state whether\
    \ or not they\n      employ compression, and if they do they should discuss what\
    \ steps\n      need to be taken to avoid such attacks.\n   o  A media type might\
    \ be targeted for applications that require some\n      sort of security assurance\
    \ but not provide the necessary security\n      mechanisms themselves.  For example,\
    \ a media type could be defined\n      for storage of confidential medical information\
    \ that in turn\n      requires an external confidentiality service, or which is\
    \ designed\n      for use only within a secure environment.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Requirements specific to XML media types
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Requirements specific to XML media types\n   There are a number of additional\
    \ requirements specific to the\n   registration of XML media types.  These requirements\
    \ are specified in\n   [RFC3023].\n"
- title: 4.8.  Encoding Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Encoding Requirements\n   Some transports impose restrictions on the type\
    \ of data they can\n   carry.  For example, Internet mail traditionally was limited\
    \ to 7bit\n   US-ASCII text.  Encoding schemes are often used to work around such\n\
    \   transport limitations.\n   It is therefore useful to note what sort of data\
    \ a media type can\n   consist of as part of its registration.  An \"encoding\
    \ considerations\"\n   field is provided for this purpose.  Possible values of\
    \ this field\n   are:\n   7bit: The content of the media type consists solely\
    \ of CRLF-delimited\n      7bit US-ASCII text.\n   8bit: The content of the media\
    \ type consists solely of CRLF-delimited\n      8bit text.\n   binary: The content\
    \ consists of unrestricted sequence of octets.\n   framed: The content consists\
    \ of a series of frames or packets without\n      internal framing or alignment\
    \ indicators.  Additional out-of-band\n      information is needed to interpret\
    \ the data properly, including\n      but not necessarily limited to, knowledge\
    \ of the boundaries\n      between successive frames and knowledge of the transport\n\
    \      mechanism.  Note that media types of this sort cannot simply be\n     \
    \ stored in a file or transported as a simple stream of octets;\n      therefore,\
    \ such media types are unsuitable for use in many\n      traditional protocols.\
    \  A commonly used transport with framed\n      encoding is the Real-time Transport\
    \ Protocol, RTP.  Additional\n      rules for framed encodings defined for transport\
    \ using RTP are\n      given in [RFC3555].\n   Additional restrictions on 7bit\
    \ and 8bit text are given in [RFC2046].\n"
- title: 4.9.  Usage and Implementation Non-requirements
  contents:
  - "4.9.  Usage and Implementation Non-requirements\n   In the asynchronous mail\
    \ environment, where information on the\n   capabilities of the remote mail agent\
    \ is frequently not available to\n   the sender, maximum interoperability is attained\
    \ by restricting the\n   media types used to those \"common\" formats expected\
    \ to be widely\n   implemented.  This was asserted in the past as a reason to\
    \ limit the\n   number of possible media types, and it resulted in a registration\n\
    \   process with a significant hurdle and delay for those registering\n   media\
    \ types.\n   However, the need for \"common\" media types does not require limiting\n\
    \   the registration of new media types.  If a limited set of media types\n  \
    \ is recommended for a particular application, that should be asserted\n   by\
    \ a separate applicability statement specific for the application\n   and/or environment.\n\
    \   Therefore, universal support and implementation of a media type is\n   NOT\
    \ a requirement for registration.  However, if a media type is\n   explicitly\
    \ intended for limited use, this MUST be noted in its\n   registration.  The \"\
    Restrictions on Usage\" field is provided for this\n   purpose.\n"
- title: 4.10.  Publication Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.10.  Publication Requirements\n   Proposals for media types registered in the\
    \ standards tree by the\n   IETF itself MUST be published as RFCs.  RFC publication\
    \ of vendor and\n   personal media type proposals is encouraged but not required.\
    \  In all\n   cases the IANA will retain copies of all media type proposals and\n\
    \   \"publish\" them as part of the media types registration tree itself.\n  \
    \ As stated previously, standards tree registrations for media types\n   defined\
    \ in documents produced by other standards bodies MUST be\n   described by a formal\
    \ standards specification produced by that body.\n   Such specifications MUST\
    \ contain an appropriate media type\n   registration template taken from Section\
    \ 10.  Additionally, the\n   copyright on the registration template MUST allow\
    \ the IANA to copy it\n   into the IANA registry.\n   Other than IETF registrations\
    \ in the standards tree, the registration\n   of a data type does not imply endorsement,\
    \ approval, or\n   recommendation by the IANA or the IETF or even certification\
    \ that the\n   specification is adequate.  To become Internet Standards, a protocol\n\
    \   or data object must go through the IETF standards process.  This is\n   too\
    \ difficult and too lengthy a process for the convenient\n   registration of media\
    \ types.\n   The standards tree exists for media types that do require a\n   substantive\
    \ review and approval process in a recognized standards\n   body.  The vendor\
    \ and personal trees exist for those media types that\n   do not require such\
    \ a process.  It is expected that applicability\n   statements for particular\
    \ applications will be published from time to\n   time in the IETF, recommending\
    \ implementation of, and support for,\n   media types that have proven particularly\
    \ useful in those contexts.\n   As discussed above, registration of a top-level\
    \ type requires\n   standards-track processing in the IETF and, hence, RFC publication.\n"
- title: 4.11.  Additional Information
  contents:
  - "4.11.  Additional Information\n   Various sorts of optional information SHOULD\
    \ be included in the\n   specification of a media type if it is available:\n \
    \  o  Magic number(s) (length, octet values).  Magic numbers are byte\n      sequences\
    \ that are always present at a given place in the file and\n      thus can be\
    \ used to identify entities as being of a given media\n      type.\n   o  File\
    \ name extension(s) commonly used on one or more platforms to\n      indicate\
    \ that some file contains a given media type.\n   o  Mac OS File Type code(s)\
    \ (4 octets) used to label files containing\n      a given media type.\n   o \
    \ Information about how fragment/anchor identifiers [RFC3986] are\n      constructed\
    \ for use in conjunction with this media type.\n   In the case of a registration\
    \ in the standards tree, this additional\n   information MAY be provided in the\
    \ formal specification of the media\n   type.  It is suggested that this be done\
    \ by incorporating the IANA\n   media type registration form into the specification\
    \ itself.\n"

    \ types will be\n   registered by the IANA automatically and without any formal\

    \   o  Media types MUST function as an actual media format.  In\n      particular,\
    \ charsets and transfer encodings MUST NOT be registered\n      as media types.\n\
    \   o  All media types MUST have properly formed type and subtype names.\n   \
    \   All type names MUST be defined by a standards-track RFC.  All\n      type/subtype\
    \ name pairs MUST be unique and MUST contain the proper\n      tree prefix.\n\

    \ be requested only when there are serious omissions or\n   errors in the published\
    \ specification.  When review is required, a\n   change request may be denied\

    \ under the new definition.\n   The owner of a media type may pass responsibility\
    \ to another person\n   or agency by informing the IANA and the ietf-types list;\
    \ this can be\n   done without discussion or review.\n   The IESG may reassign\

    \ enable changes to be made to types\n   where the author of the registration\
    \ has died, moved out of contact\n   or is otherwise unable to make changes that\

- title: Appendix A.  Grandfathered Media Types
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Grandfathered Media Types\n   A number of media types, registered\
    \ prior to 1996, would, if\n   registered under the guidelines in this document,\
    \ be placed into\n   either the vendor or personal trees.  Reregistration of those\
    \ types\n   to reflect the appropriate trees is encouraged but not required.\n\
    \   Ownership and change control principles outlined in this document\n   apply\
    \ to those types as if they had been registered in the trees\n   described above.\n"

  - "Appendix B.  Changes Since RFC 2048\n   o  Media type specification and registration\
    \ procedures have been\n      moved out of the MIME document set to this separate\
    \ specification.\n   o  The various URLs and addresses in this document have been\
    \ changed\n      so they all refer to iana.org rather than isi.edu.  Additionally,\n\
    \      many of the URLs have been changed to use HTTP; formerly they used\n  \
    \    FTP.\n   o  Much of the document has been clarified in the light of\n   \
    \   operational experience with these procedures.\n   o  The unfaceted IETF tree\
    \ is now called the standards tree, and the\n      registration rules for this\
    \ tree have been relaxed to allow use by\n      other standards bodies.\n   o\
    \  The text describing the media type registration procedure has\n      clarified.\n\
    \   o  The rules and requirements for constructing security\n      considerations\
    \ sections have been extended and clarified.\n   o  RFC 3023 is now referenced\
    \ as the source of additional information\n      concerning the registration of\
    \ XML media types.\n   o  Several of the references in this document have been\
    \ updated to\n      refer to current versions of the relevant specifications.\n\
    \   o  A note has been added discouraging the assignment of multiple\n      names\
    \ to a single media type.\n   o  Security considerations and IANA considerations\
    \ sections have been\n      added.\n   o  Concerns regarding copyrights on media\
    \ type registration templates\n      produced by other standards bodies have been\
    \ dealt with by\n      requiring that the IANA be allowed to copy the registration\n\
    \      template into the registry.\n   o  The basic registration requirements\
    \ for the various top-level\n      types have been moved from RFC 2046 to this\
    \ document.\n   o  A syntax is now specified for media type, subtype, and parameter\n\
    \      names.\n   o  Imposed a maximum length of 127 on all media type and subtype\n\
    \      names.\n   o  A note has been added to caution against excessive use of\n\
    \      \"+suffix\" constructs in subtype names.\n   o  The encoding considerations\
    \ field has been extended to allow the\n      value \"framed\".\n   o  A reference\
    \ describing Macintosh Type codes has been added.\n   o  Ietf-types list review\
    \ of registrations in the standards tree is\n      now required rather than just\
    \ recommended.\n"
