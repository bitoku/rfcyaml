    \ router forwarding packets is known as the active router.  A\n   standby router\

  - "1. Introduction\n   The Hot Standby Router Protocol, HSRP, provides a mechanism\
    \ which is\n   designed to support non-disruptive failover of IP traffic in certain\n\
    \   circumstances.  In particular, the protocol protects against the\n   failure\
    \ of the first hop router when the source host cannot learn the\n   IP address\
    \ of the first hop router dynamically.  The protocol is\n   designed for use over\
    \ multi-access, multicast or broadcast capable\n   LANs (e.g., Ethernet).  HSRP\
    \ is not intended as a replacement for\n   existing dynamic router discovery mechanisms\
    \ and those protocols\n   should be used instead whenever possible [1].  A large\
    \ class of\n   legacy host implementations that do not support dynamic discovery\
    \ are\n   capable of configuring a default router.  HSRP provides failover\n \
    \  services to those hosts.\n   All of the routers participating in HSRP are assumed\
    \ to be running\n   appropriate IP routing protocols and have a consistent set\
    \ of routes.\n   The discussion of which protocols are appropriate and whether\
    \ routing\n   is consistent in any given situation is beyond the scope of this\n\
    \   specification.\n   Using HSRP, a set of routers work in concert to present\
    \ the illusion\n   of a single virtual router to the hosts on the LAN.  This set\
    \ is\n   known as an HSRP group or a standby group.  A single router elected\n\
    \   from the group is responsible for forwarding the packets that hosts\n   send\
    \ to the virtual router.  This router is known as the active\n   router.  Another\
    \ router is elected as the standby router.  In the\n   event that the active router\
    \ fails, the standby assumes the packet\n   forwarding duties of the active router.\
    \  Although an arbitrary number\n   of routers may run HSRP, only the active router\
    \ forwards the packets\n   sent to the virtual router.\n   To minimize network\
    \ traffic, only the active and the standby routers\n   send periodic HSRP messages\
    \ once the protocol has completed the\n   election process.  If the active router\
    \ fails, the standby router\n   takes over as the active router.  If the standby\
    \ router fails or\n   becomes the active router, another router is elected as\
    \ the standby\n   router.\n   On a particular LAN, multiple hot standby groups\
    \ may coexist and\n   overlap.  Each standby group emulates a single virtual router.\
    \  For\n   each standby group, a single well-known MAC address is allocated to\n\
    \   the group, as well as an IP address.  The IP address SHOULD belong to\n  \
    \ the primary subnet in use on the LAN, but MUST differ from the\n   addresses\
    \ allocated as interface addresses on all routers and hosts\n   on the LAN, including\
    \ virtual IP addresses assigned to other HSRP\n   groups.\n   If multiple groups\
    \ are used on a single LAN, load splitting can be\n   achieved by distributing\
    \ hosts among different standby groups.\n   The remainder of this specification\
    \ discusses the operation of a\n   single standby group.  In the case of multiple\
    \ groups, each group\n   operates independently of other groups on the LAN and\
    \ according to\n   this specification.  Note that individual routers may participate\
    \ in\n   multiple groups.  In this case, the router maintains separate state\n\
    \   and timers for each group.\n"

    \  1 octet\n      This field is only meaningful in Hello messages.  It contains\
    \ the\n      approximate period between the Hello messages that the router\n \
    \     sends.  The time is given in seconds.\n      If the Hellotime is not configured\

    \ router.  The\n      Hellotime SHOULD only be learned if no Hellotime is configured\
    \ and\n      the Hello message is authenticated.  A router that sends a Hello\n\
    \      message MUST insert the Hellotime that it is using in the\n      Hellotime\
    \ field in the Hello message.  If the Hellotime is not\n      learned from a Hello\
    \ message from the active router and it is not\n      manually configured, a default\
    \ value of 3 seconds is RECOMMENDED.\n   Holdtime:  1 octet\n      This field\
    \ is only meaningful in Hello messages.  It contains the\n      amount of time\
    \ that the current Hello message should be considered\n      valid.  The time\
    \ is given in seconds.\n      If a router sends a Hello message, then receivers\
    \ should consider\n      that Hello message to be valid for one Holdtime.  The\
    \ Holdtime\n      SHOULD be at least three times the value of the Hellotime and\
    \ MUST\n      be greater than the Hellotime.  If the Holdtime is not configured\n\
    \      on a router, then it MAY be learned from the Hello message from\n     \
    \ the active router.  The Holdtime SHOULD only be learned if the\n      Hello\
    \ message is authenticated.  A router that sends a Hello\n      message MUST insert\
    \ the Holdtime that it is using in the Holdtime\n      field in the Hello message.\n\
    \      A router which is in active state MUST NOT learn new values for\n     \
    \ the Hellotime and the Holdtime from other routers, although it may\n      continue\
    \ to use values which it learned from the previous active\n      router.  It MAY\
    \ also use the Hellotime and Holdtime values learned\n      through manual configuration.\
    \  The active router MUST NOT use one\n      configured time and one learned time.\
    \  If the Holdtime is not\n      learned and it is not manually configured, a\
    \ default value of 10\n      seconds is RECOMMENDED.\n   Priority:  1 octet\n\
    \      This field is used to elect the active and standby routers.  When\n   \
    \   comparing priorities of two different routers, the router with the\n     \
    \ numerically higher priority wins.  In the case of routers with\n      equal\
    \ priority the router with the higher IP address wins.\n   Group:   1 octet\n\
    \      This field identifies the standby group.  For Token Ring, values\n    \
    \  between 0 and 2 inclusive are valid.  For other media values\n      between\
    \ 0 and 255 inclusive are valid.\n   Authentication Data:    8 octets\n      This\
    \ field contains a clear-text 8 character reused password.\n      If no authentication\
    \ data is configured, the RECOMMENDED default\n      value is 0x63 0x69 0x73 0x63\
    \ 0x6F 0x00 0x00 0x00.\n   Virtual IP Address:     4 octets\n      The virtual\
    \ IP address used by this group.\n      If the virtual IP address is not configured\

  - '6  MAC Address Considerations

    '
- title: 6.1 General
  contents:
  - "6.1 General\n   Each HSRP group has an associated well known virtual MAC address.\
    \  On\n   token ring networks, these addresses are actually functional\n   addresses.\
    \  The three addresses 0xC0 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00, 0xC0\n   0x00 0x00 0x02\
    \ 0x00 0x00, and 0xC0 0x00 0x00 0x04 0x00 0x00\n   correspond to groups 0, 1,\
    \ and 2 respectively.\n   On other media, the virtual MAC addresses are 0x00 0x00\
    \ 0x0C 0x07\n   0xAC XX where XX represents the HSRP group number.  Routers which\n\
    \   implement HSRP SHOULD use well-known HSRP MAC addresses as the\n   group's\
    \ virtual MAC address whenever possible.\n   The active router MUST accept and\
    \ forward traffic that is destined\n   for the group's virtual MAC address.  It\
    \ MUST stop accepting or\n   forwarding such traffic when the router leaves the\
    \ Active state.\n   If and only if the router is in the Active state, the router\
    \ MUST use\n   the group's virtual MAC address as the source MAC address for its\n\
    \   Hello messages.  This is necessary in order to allow learning bridges\n  \
    \ to be able to determine which LAN segment the virtual MAC address\n   currently\
    \ belongs to.\n   For each group, there is one virtual IP address and one virtual\
    \ MAC\n   address.  This is a desirable situation, since the ARP table entries\n\
    \   in the end stations do not need to change over time as the HSRP\n   active\
    \ router moves from one router to another.\n   Additionally, for HSRP to work\
    \ in bridging environments, the bridges\n   must be able to quickly update themselves\
    \ as the virtual MAC address\n   \"moves\".  Although learning bridges typically\
    \ are able to do this,\n   some have been known to have problems with this.  It\
    \ is RECOMMENDED\n   that only true learning bridges be used with HSRP.\n   The\
    \ movement of the virtual MAC address can cause further undesirable\n   side effects\
    \ in environments where additional state is tied to the\n   MAC address.  For\
    \ example on Token Ring, if Source Route Bridging is\n   in use, a RIF will be\
    \ stored with the virtual MAC address in a host's\n   RIF cache.  The RIF indicates\
    \ the path and final ring used to reach\n   the MAC address.  As routers transition\
    \ into Active state, they will\n   not be able to affect the RIF caches on the\
    \ hosts on the bridged\n   ring.  This may lead to packets being bridged to the\
    \ ring for the\n   previous active router.\n   In such circumstances, a router\
    \ MAY use its normal MAC addresses as\n   the virtual MAC address.  This method\
    \ of operation is strongly\n   discouraged.  In this mode, the virtual IP address\
    \ will map to a\n   different MAC address over time.  This can create problems\
    \ for end\n   stations, since ARP tables assume a relatively static mapping between\n\
    \   MAC address and IP address.  These ARP tables are normally updated\n   when\
    \ the end stations receive the gratuitous ARP responses generated\n   by a router\
    \ that enters the active state.\n"
- title: 6.2 Address Filter
  contents:
  - "6.2 Address Filter\n   As noted, routers currently emulating a virtual router\
    \ adopt their\n   group's MAC and IP addresses.  MAC addresses are typically provided\n\
    \   in an address filter or 'list' of MAC addresses in a router's\n   interface\
    \ controller.  It is desirable for routers to be able to add\n   one or more virtual\
    \ MAC addresses to their controllers' MAC address\n   filter while maintaining\
    \ their primary MAC addresses.\n   Unfortunately, some interface controllers support\
    \ address filtering\n   for only one unicast MAC address.  Or, in the case of\
    \ Token Ring, the\n   functional address which HSRP should use is already in use\
    \ for some\n   other protocol.  In these cases, such routers can still implement\n\
    \   HSRP, but the protocol must change the interface's primary MAC\n   address\
    \ when assuming or relinquishing control as the active router.\n   This is potentially\
    \ problematic because some traffic may otherwise\n   wish to use the router's\
    \ primary MAC address.  However, the problem\n   MAY be mitigated by having the\
    \ router send out gratuitous ARP packets\n   regarding its non-HSRP IP addresses.\
    \  Through this, other network\n   entities using IP should update their ARP tables\
    \ to reflect that the\n   router is now using a group virtual MAC address rather\
    \ than its\n   primary MAC address.\n   Some protocols may not be able to run\
    \ simultaneously with the standby\n   protocol due to the interface primary MAC\
    \ address change.  For\n   example, DECnet phase IV and HSRP will not be able\
    \ to run at the same\n   time on some equipment.\n"
- title: 6.3 ICMP Redirect
  contents:
  - "6.3 ICMP Redirect\n   While running HSRP, it is important to prevent the host\
    \ from\n   discovering the primary MAC addresses of the routers in its standby\n\
    \   group.  Thus, any protocol that informs a host of a router's primary\n   address\
    \ should be disabled.  Thus, routers participating in HSRP on\n   an interface\
    \ MUST NOT send ICMP redirects on that interface.\n"
- title: 6.4 Proxy ARP
  contents:
  - "6.4 Proxy ARP\n   Typically, hosts learn the HSRP virtual IP address through\
    \ the\n   configuration of their default router.  These hosts then send packets\n\
    \   for destinations outside of the LAN to the virtual IP address.  In\n   some\
    \ environments, hosts may instead make use of proxy ARP in order\n   to route\
    \ off of the LAN.  In this case, the hosts use the MAC address\n   that is supplied\
    \ in proxy ARP responses.  HSRP functionality is\n   maintained if the proxy ARP\
    \ responses specify the HSRP virtual MAC\n   address.\n   If an HSRP router is\
    \ configured to support proxy ARP with HSRP, then\n   the router MUST specify\
    \ the HSRP virtual MAC address in any proxy ARP\n   responses it generates.  These\
    \ proxy ARP responses MUST not be\n   suppressed based upon HSRP state.  Suppression\
    \ based upon state could\n   result in lack of any proxy ARP response being generated,\
    \ since these\n   proxy ARP responses may be suppressed due to other reasons,\
    \ such as\n   split-horizon rules.\n"
- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   This protocol does not provide security.  The\
    \ authentication field\n   found within the message is useful for preventing misconfiguration.\n\
    \   The protocol is easily subverted by an active intruder on the LAN.\n   This\
    \ can result in a packet black hole and a denial-of-service\n   attack.  It is\
    \ difficult to subvert the protocol from outside the LAN\n   as most routers will\
    \ not forward packets addressed to the all-routers\n   multicast address (224.0.0.2).\n"
