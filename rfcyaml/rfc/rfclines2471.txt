This document describes an allocation plan for IPv6 addresses to be used in testing IPv6 prototype software.
These addresses are temporary and will be reclaimed in the future.
Any IPv6 system using these addresses will have to renumber at some time in the future.
These addresses will not to be routable in the Internet other than for IPv6 testing.
The address format for the IPv6 test address is consistent with the "Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Allocation" [AGGR] and "TLA and NLA Assignment Rules" [TLAASN].
This document is intended to replace RFC 1897 "IPv6 Testing Address Allocation", January 1996.
RFC 1897 will become historic.
The addresses described in this document are consistent with the IPv6 Addressing Architecture [ARCH].
They may be assigned to nodes manually, with IPv6 Auto Address Allocation [AUTO], or with DHCP for IPv6 [DHCPv6].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Allocation format defined in [AGGR] is as follows:
This is the Format Prefix used to identify aggregatable global unicast addresses.
This is a TLA ID assigned by the IANA for 6bone testing under the auspices of the IETF IPng
Transition Working Group 6bone testbed activity.
It is to be administered by the chair of the 6bone activity (currently Bob Fink <rlfink@lbl.gov>).
The use of this TLA ID is temporary.
All users of these addresses in this TLA ID will be required to renumber at some time in the future.
The NLA ID space will be assigned, by the TLA ID administrator, in an addressing hierarchy sufficient to identify transit networks and end user sites consistent with the architecture and topology of the 6bone.
This will provide a multi level transit service consistent with the 6bone goals of fully testing IPv6 technology in real use environments.
SLA ID   Site Level Aggregation Identifier
The SLA ID field is used by an individual organization to create its own local addressing hierarchy and to identify subnets.
Assignment of the SLA ID field is the responsibility of each individual organization.
This is the interface identifier of the interface on the link as defined in the appropriate IPv6 over <link> document, such as [ETHER], [FDDI], etc.
This document defines a test approach for creating aggregatable address consistent with [AGGR].
It does not have any direct impact on Internet infrastructure security.
Authentication of IPv6 packets is defined in [AUTH].
