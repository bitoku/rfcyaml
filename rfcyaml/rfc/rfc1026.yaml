  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC suggest a proposed protocol for the Internet\
    \ community, and\n   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  Distribution\n\
    \   of this memo is unlimited.\n   This document specifies a number of additions\
    \ and corrections to\n   RFC-987, aka Mailgroup Note 19.\n   The addendum carries\
    \ equal weight to the original specification,\n   which must be used when this\
    \ mapping is performed on the Internet or\n   in the UK Academic Community.  This\
    \ mapping may also be used within\n   the RARE community in Europe.  This specification\
    \ may be modified in\n   the light of implementation experience, but no substantial\
    \ changes\n   are expected.\n"

- title: 2.  Component Ordering
  contents:
  - "2.  Component Ordering\n   In most cases, ordering of O/R name components is\
    \ not significant for\n   the mappings specified by this document.  However, Organisational\n\
    \   Units and Domain Defined Attributes are specified as SEQUENCE, in\n   P1.ORName,\
    \ and so their order may be significant.  This specification\n   needs to take\
    \ account of this in two ways:\n   1)   To allow consistent mapping into the domain\
    \ hierarchy\n   2)   To ensure preservation of order over multiple mappings.\n"
- title: 'There are three places where an order must be specified:'
  contents:
  - "There are three places where an order must be specified:\n   1)   On the text\
    \ encoding (std-orname) of P1.ORName as used in the\n        local-part of an\
    \ RFC-822 address, the most significant component\n        must be on the RHS.\
    \  This applies only to those components which\n        may have multiple values\
    \ (Organisational Unit, and Domain\n        Defined Attributes).  Other attributes\
    \ may be presented in any\n        order. Note that in dmn-orname specified in\
    \ Appendix F, this\n        ordering is already implied by the current ordering\n\
    \        requirements.\n   2)   For the Organisational Units (OU) in P1.ORName,\
    \ the first OU in\n        the SEQUENCE is the most signicicant.  This follows\
    \ the\n        \"natural\" hierarchy of the specification of P1.ORName, where\
    \ the\n        most significant components are defined first.\n   3)   For the\
    \ Domain Defined Attributes in P1.ORName, the First Domain\n        Defined Attribute\
    \ in the SEQUENCE is the most significant.\n   Note that although the ordering\
    \ defined in 2) and 3) is mandatory for\n   this mapping, there are NO implications\
    \ on ordering significance\n   within X.400.\n   3.  Extensions To Deal with Omitted\
    \ Components\n   Implementation of RFC-987 has proved to be a little inflexible\
    \ for\n   some naming strategies.  In particular, there are some difficulties\n\
    \   where Organisation or PRMD is omitted:\n   The following sentence of RFC-987\
    \ should be removed: 4.2.1 (Page 27):\n   \"If one of the hierarchical components\
    \ is omitted ....  tuple).\".\n   The strategy proposed is to introduce the concept\
    \ of explicit missing\n   components to the symmetrical mapping described in 4.2.1.\n\
    \   Essentially, a domain may be associated with an omitted attribute in\n   conjuction\
    \ with several present ones.  When performing the\n   algorithmic insertion of\
    \ components lower in the hierarchy, the\n   omitted value should be skipped.\
    \  For example, if \"GMD.DFN\" is\n   associated with \"C=DE\", \"ADMD=DBP\",\
    \ \"PRMD=GMD\", and omitted\n   organisation, then \"ZI.GMD.DFN\" is mapped with\
    \ \"C=DE\", \"ADMD=DBP\",\n   \"PRMD=GMD\", \"OU=ZI\".  It should be noted that\
    \ attributes may have\n   null values, and that this is treated separately from\
    \ omitted\n   attributes (whilst it would be bad practice to treat these two cases\n\
    \   differently, they must be allowed for in practice).\n   To allow the mapping\
    \ of null organisations to be represented in the\n   specification of Appendix\
    \ F, the dmn-orname syntax is extended, so\n   that values may be given the symbol\
    \ \"@\" (not a printable string\n   character). This corresponds to an omitted\
    \ attribute. The new\n   definition is:\n           dmn-orname      = dmn-part\
    \ *( \".\" dmn-part )\n           dmn-part        = attribute \"$\" value\n  \
    \         attribute       = standard-type\n                           / \"~\"\
    \ dmn-printablestring\n           value           = dmn-printablestring\n    \
    \                       / \"@\"\n           dmn-printablestring\n            \
    \               = *( dmn-char / dmn-pair )\n           dmn-char        = <ps-delim,\
    \ and any ps-char except \".\">\n           dmn-pair        = \".\"\n   Appendix\
    \ F - Format of address mapping tables\n   A new Appendix F is defined as follows:\n\
    \   There is a need to specify the association between the domain and\n   X.400\
    \ namespaces described in 4.2.1.  This is defined as a table\n   syntax, but the\
    \ syntax is defined in a manner which makes it suitable\n   for use with domain\
    \ nameservices (such as the Internet Domain\n   nameservers or the UK NRS).  The\
    \ mapping is not symmetric, and so a\n   separate table is specified for each\
    \ direction.  If multiple matches\n   are possible, the longest possible match\
    \ should be used.\n   Various restrictions are placed on the usage of dmn-orname:\n\
    \   1)   Only C, ADMD, PRMD, O, and OU may be used.\n   2)   There must be a strict\
    \ ordering of all components, with the most\n        significant components on\
    \ the RHS.\n   3)   No components may be omitted from the hierarchy, although\
    \ the\n        hierarchy may terminate at any level.  If the mapping is to an\n\
    \        omitted component, the \"@\" syntax is used.\n   For domain -> X.400:\n\
    \           domain-syntax \"#\" dmn-orname \"#\"\n   Note that the trailing \"\
    #\" is used for clarity, as the dmn-orname\n   syntax can lead to values with\
    \ trailing blanks.\n           For example:\n           AC.UK#PRMD$DES.ADMD$BT.C$UK#\n\
    \           XEROX.COM#O$Xerox.ADMD$ATT.C$US#\n           HMI.DBP.DFN#O$@.PRMD$HMI.ADMD.DBP.C$DE#\n\
    \   For X.400 -> domain:\n           dmn-orname \"#\" domain-syntax \"#\"\n"
