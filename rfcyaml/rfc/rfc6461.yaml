  - "1.  Overview\n   [RFC5486] (Section 3.3) defines Session Establishment Data,\
    \ or SED,\n   as the data used to route a call to the next hop associated with\
    \ the\n   called domain's ingress point.  More specifically, the SED is the set\n\
    \   of parameters that the outgoing signaling path border elements (SBEs)\n  \
    \ need to establish a session.  However, [RFC5486] does not specify the\n   protocol(s)\
    \ or format(s) to provision SED.  To pave the way to\n   specify such a protocol,\
    \ this document presents the use cases and\n   associated requirements that have\
    \ been proposed to provision SED.\n   SED is typically created by the terminating\
    \ or next-hop SIP service\n   provider (SSP) and consumed by the originating SSP.\
    \  To avoid a\n   multitude of bilateral exchanges, SED is often shared via\n\
    \   intermediary systems -- termed \"registries\" within this document.\n   Such\
    \ registries receive data via provisioning transactions from SSPs,\n   and then\
    \ distribute the received data into Local Data Repositories\n   (LDRs).  These\
    \ LDRs are used for call routing by outgoing SBEs.  This\n   is depicted in Figure\

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   This document reuses terms from [RFC3261] (e.g., SIP), [RFC5486]\n   (e.g.,\
    \ SSP, LUF, LRF, SED) and [RFC5067] (carrier-of-record and\n   transit provider).\
    \  In addition, this document specifies the\n   following additional terms.\n\
    \   Registry:  The authoritative source for provisioned session\n      establishment\
    \ data (SED) and related information.  A registry can\n      be part of an SSP\
    \ or be an independent entity.\n   Registrar:  An entity that provisions and manages\
    \ data into the\n      registry.  An SSP can act as its own registrar or -- additionally\n\
    \      or alternatively -- delegate this function to a third party (who\n    \
    \  acts as its registrar).\n   Local Data Repository (LDR):  The data store component\
    \ of an\n      addressing server that provides resolution responses.\n   Public\
    \ Identifier:  A public identifier refers to a telephone number\n      (TN), a\
    \ SIP address, or other identity as deemed appropriate, such\n      as a globally\
    \ routable URI of a user address (e.g.,\n      sip:john.doe@example.net).\n  \
    \ Telephone Number (TN) Range:  A numerically contiguous set of\n      telephone\
    \ numbers.\n   Telephone Number (TN) Prefix:  A preceding portion of the digits\n\
    \      common across a series of E.164 numbers.  A given TN prefix will\n    \
    \  include all the valid E.164 numbers that satisfy the expansion\n      rules\
    \ mandated by the country or the region with which the TNs\n      comply.\n  \
    \ Routing Number (RN):  A Routing Number.  For more information, see\n      [RFC4694].\n\
    \   Destination Group:  An aggregation of a set of public identifiers, TN\n  \
    \    Ranges, or RNs that share common SED, which is exposed to a common\n    \
    \  set of peers.\n   Data Recipient:  An entity with visibility into a specific\
    \ set of\n      public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs), the destination groups\n\
    \      that contain these public identifiers (or TN Ranges and RNs), and\n   \
    \   a route group's SED records.\n   Route Group:  An aggregation that contains\
    \ a related set of SED\n      records and is associated with a set of destination\
    \ groups.  Route\n      groups facilitate the management of SED records for one\
    \ or more\n      data recipients.\n"

  - "3.1.  Category: Provisioning Mechanisms\n   UC PROV #1  Real-Time Provisioning:\
    \ Registrars have operational\n               systems that provision public identifiers\
    \ (or TN Ranges\n               or RNs) in association with their SED.  These\
    \ systems\n               often function in a manner that expects or requires\
    \ that\n               these provisioning activities be completed immediately,\n\
    \               as opposed to an out-of-band or batch provisioning scheme\n  \
    \             that can occur at a later time.  This type of\n               provisioning\

    \             provision public identifiers (or TN Ranges or RNs) and\n       \
    \        associated SED sometimes expect that these provisioning\n           \
    \    activities be batched up into large sets.  These batched\n              \
    \ requests are then processed using a provisioning\n               mechanism that\
    \ is out of band and occurs at a later time.\n   UC PROV #3  Multi-Request Provisioning:\
    \ Regardless of whether or not\n               a provisioning action is performed\
    \ in real time, SSPs\n               often perform several provisioning actions\
    \ on several\n               objects in a single request or transaction.  This\
    \ is done\n               for performance and scalability reasons, and for\n \
    \              transactional reasons, such that the set of provisioning\n    \
