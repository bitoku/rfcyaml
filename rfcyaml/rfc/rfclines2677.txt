Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) as defined in RFC 2332.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) as defined in RFC 2332 [17].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [21].
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
The NHRP MIB contains three groups: the General Group, the Client Group, and the Server Group.
The General Group contains objects that apply to both clients and servers   in particular the nhrpNextIndex scalar object,  the NHRP Cache Table and the NHRP Purge Request Table.
The nhrpNextIndex scalar object is used to provide unique indices for the nhprClientIndex in the nhrpClientTable and the nhrpServerIndex in the nhrpServerTable.
If used consistently, this object may prevent conflicts when multiple managers attempt to create rows simultaneously in the same table.
The NHRP Cache Table represents the internetwork layer address to NBMA address cache that is maintained by both NHRP clients and NHRP servers.
The NHRP Cache Table contains an ifIndex as part of the Index Clause.
This ifIndex represents the use of a generic ifIndex, such that the value of this ifIndex SHOULD reflect a specific NBMA subnetwork related interface as determined by an implementation.
For example, assuming that the NBMA subnetwork is ATM, then it is up to the implementors of this MIB to determine their own ATM interface layering (assuming compliance with the IF MIB, RFC 2233 [18] and the ATM MIB, RFC 2515 [19]).
In other words, assuming that the NBMA subnetwork is ATM, the ifIndex in the NHRP Cache Table would represent the ifIndex containing or consisting of the VC (or shortcut) denoted by this Table entry.
The indexing scheme for the NHRP Cache Table is very similar to the MPC Ingress Cache Table and the MPS Ingress Cache Table in the Multiprotocol Over ATM (MPOA
This MIB and the MPOA MIB were designed to be complementary and non overlapping.
The MPOA MIB should also support this MIB.
The MPOA MIB was designed prior to this MIB, and was designed by the LANE/MPOA Working Group in the ATM FORUM.
The indexing scheme of the NHRP Cache Table (and the NHRP Server Cache Table) reflect the indexing scheme of the MPC Ingress Cache Table and the MPS Ingress Cache Table.
Although, other indexing schemes could have been used for the NHRP Cache Table, a consistent indexing scheme between these tables was thought to be more advantageous from an implementation standpoint.
The NHRP Purge Request Table
The NHRP Purge Request Table is a way to track Purge Request Information.
The Client Group contains objects that only apply to NHRP clients (NHCs).
The NHRP Client Table contains entries for NHRP Next Hop Clients (NHCs) associated with this agent.
Each row in the table represents a single NHC.
The RequestID used in Registration requests needs to be saved to non volatile storage.
Depending upon the implementation, this may or may not impact how the StorageType is used.
For a complete description of how the Registration RequestID is used, see Section 5.2.3 of [17].
The NHRP Client Registration Table
The NHRP Client Registration Table contains information on registration requests which need to be maintained by the Clients.
Each entry in this table represents a single registration request.
Note:  since the NHRP specification does not mandate a refresh algorithm, this table omits refresh information, however, this table does contain information for all the registration requests which need to be maintained by the NHRP Clients.
The NHRP Client NHS Table
The NHRP Client NHS Table contains the NBMA subnetwork addresses of servers configured for use by the client.
By default, the agent will add an entry to this table which corresponds to the client's default router.
The NHRP Client Statistics Table
The NHRP Client Statistics Table contains NHRP statistics maintained by a client.
These statistics include counters on requests and replies, as well as counters for errors which are encountered by the Clients.
The Server Group contains objects that only apply to NHRP servers (NHSes).
The NHRP Server Table contains entries for each server associated with this agent.
The NHRP Server Cache Table
The NHRP Server Cache Table contains additional objects that a server keeps for each entry in its cache.
This table extends the NHRP Cache Table defined in the General Group.
The NHRP Server NHC Table
This table contains information about all the Clients known to the Servers.
The NHRP Server Statistics Table
The NHRP Server Statistics Table contains NHRP statistics maintained by a server.
These statistics include counters on requests and replies, as well as counters for errors which are encountered by the Servers.

This MIB contains managed object definitions for the Next Hop Resolution Procol, NHRP, as defined in RFC 2332 [17].
"The value of an internetwork layer or NBMA address.
OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..64)) nhrpObjects
The following scalar is to be used to    provided indices for the    nhrpClientTable, and/or the nhrpServerTable.
"This scalar is used for creating rows in the nhrpClientTable and the nhrpServerTable.
The value of this variable is a currently unused value for nhrpClientIndex and nhrpServerIndex.
The value returned when reading this variable must be unique for the NHC's and NHS's indices associated with this row.
Subsequent attempts to read this variable must return different values.
this object exists in the General Group because it is to be used in establishing rows in the nhrpClientTable and the nhrpServerTable.
In other words, the value retrieved from this object could become the value of nhrpClientIndex and nhprServerIndex.
In the situation of an agent re initialization
the value of this object must be saved in non volatile storage.
This variable will return the special value 0 if no new rows can be created."
"This table contains mappings between internetwork layer addresses and NBMA subnetwork layer addresses."
current DESCRIPTION "A cached mapping between an internetwork layer address and an NBMA address.
Entries can be created by the network administrator using the nhrpCacheRowStatus column, or they may be added dynamically based on protocol operation (including NHRP, SCSP, and others, such as ATMARP).
When created based by NHRP protocol operations this entry is largely based on contents contained in the Client Information Entry (CIE).
Zero or more Client Information Entries (CIEs) may be included in the NHRP Packet.
For a complete description of the CIE, refer to Section 5.2.0.1 of RFC 2332 [17].
"The internetwork layer address type of this Next Hop Resolution Cache entry.
The value of this object indicates how to interpret the values of nhrpCacheInternetworkAddr and nhrpCacheNextHopInternetworkAddr."
An identifier for this entry that has local significance within the scope of the General Group.
This identifier is used here to uniquely identify this row, and also used in the 'nhrpPurgeTable' for the value of the 'nhrpPurgeCacheIdentifier'."
{ nhrpCacheEntry 3 } nhrpCachePrefixLength OBJECT
The value of this object indicates how to interpret the values of nhrpCacheNbmaAddr and nhrpCacheNbmaSubaddr."
"The value of the NBMA subaddress of the next hop.
If there is no subaddress concept for the NBMA address family, this value will be a zero length OCTET STRING."
"An indication of how this cache entry was created.
The entry was added by some other means. '
In a server, added based on a client registration. 'resolveAuthoritative(3)'
In a client, added based on receiving an Authoritative NHRP Resolution Reply. '
In a client, added based on receiving a Nonauthoritative NHRP Resolution Reply. 'transit(5)'
In a transit server, added by examining a forwarded NHRP packet. 'administrativelyAdded(6)'
In a client or server, manually added by the administrator.
The StorageType of this entry is reflected in 'nhrpCacheStorageType'. '
The entry was added due to an ATMARP. 'scsp(8)'
The entry was added due to SCSP.
When the entry is under creation using the nhrpCacheRowStatus column, the only value that can be specified by the administrator is 'administrativelyAdded'.
Attempting to set any other value will cause an 'inconsistentValue' error.
The value cannot be modified once the entry is active."
"An indication of the state of this entry.
The client has sent a NHRP Resolution Request but has not yet received the NHRP Resolution Reply. '
For a client or server, this is a cached valid mapping. '
For a client or server, this is a cached NAK mapping."
is returned if the value of 'nhrpCacheType' is not 'administrativelyAdded'.
Since the value of 'nhrpCacheType' was not configured by a user, the value of 'nhrpCacheHoldingTime' is considered valid.
In other words, the value of 'nhrpCacheHoldingTime' represents the Holding Time for the cache Entry.
If 'nhrpCacheType has been configured by a user, (i.e. the value of 'nhrpCacheType' is 'administrativelyAdded')
then false(2) will be returned.
This indicates that the value of 'nhrpCacheHoldingTime' is undefined because this row could possibly be backed up in nonvolatile storage."
"If the value of 'nhrpCacheHoldingTimeValid is true(1) then this object represents the number of seconds that the cache entry will remain in this table.
When this value reaches 0
the row should be deleted.
If the value of 'nhrpCacheHoldingTimeValid is false(2) then this object is undefined."
"The maximum transmission unit (MTU) that was negotiated or registered for this entity.
In other words, this is the actual MTU being used."
"An object which reflects the Preference value of the Client Information Entry (CIE).
Zero or more Client Information Entries (CIEs) may be included in the NHRP Packet.
One of the fields in the CIE is the Preference.
For a complete description of the CIE, refer to Section 5.2.0.1 of  RFC 2332 [17].

"This value only has meaning when the 'nhrpCacheType' has the value of 'administrativelyAdded'.
When the row is created due to being 'administrativelyAdded', this object reflects whether this row is kept in volatile storage and lost upon reboot or if this row is backed up by non volatile or permanent storage.
If the value of 'nhrpCacheType' has a value which is not 'administrativelyAdded, then the value of this object is 'other(1)'.

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has been and continues to be responsible for maintaining the ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS (http://www.isi.edu/in notes/iana/assignments/address family numbers)
The IANA has placed this list in a MIB module, such that it may be imported into other MIBs.
The motivation for doing this is to allow MIBs to not have to change when a new assignment is made to the ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS.
This is very similar to the motivation behind the IANAifType MIB.
Any additions or changes to the list of ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS registered via IANA will be done as they have in the past and this document does not propose any changes to the ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS other than to place them into a MIB, which can be found via anonymous FTP at: ftp://ftp.isi.edu/mib/ianaaddressfamilynumbers.mib.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
The NHRP Protocol, RFC 2332 [17], Section 5.2.4.4 discusses security.
There is an authentication option which should be utilized to authenticate the source and also provide data integrity to the NHRP payload.
This MIB does not contain any managed objects which configure or expose security information such as that needed for NHRP authentication or data integrity.
The following items were deemed to jeopardize security and thus, were NOT added to this MIB.
Items denoted as (configurable) are those which would need values.
Items denoted as (read only) are those which would provide information.
Although the NHRP Protocol [17], requires or has this information, exposing it in a MIB would jeopardize the entire NBMA domain where NHRP was being used.
Therefore, these items have been omitted from the MIB.
Depending upon the implementation, there may be multiple SPIs, and these would be configurable also.
For example, if the implementation switched to a different SPI after a given time.
The HMAC MD5 128 is the default hash algorithm.
(configurable) lifetime value in seconds.
(read only) list of users who have access to the above information.
