  - "Abstract\n   The purpose of this document is to define terminology specific to\
    \ the\n   benchmarking of multicast IP forwarding devices. It builds upon the\n\
    \   tenets set forth in RFC 1242, RFC 2285, and other IETF Benchmarking\n   Methodology\
    \ Working Group (BMWG) efforts.  This document seeks to\n   extend these efforts\
    \ to the multicast paradigm.\n   The BMWG produces two major classes of documents:\
    \ Benchmarking\n   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents.\
    \ The\n   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms.\n\
    \   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect\n   the\
    \ benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Network forwarding devices are being required to take a\
    \ single frame\n   and support delivery to a number of destinations having membership\
    \ to\n   a particular group. As such, multicast support may place a different\n\
    \   burden on the resources of these network forwarding devices than with\n  \
    \ unicast or broadcast traffic types.\n   Such burdens may not be readily apparent\
    \ at first glance - the IP\n   multicast packet's Class D address may be the only\
    \ noticeable\n   difference from an IP unicast packet.  However, there are many\n\
    \   factors that may impact the treatment of IP multicast packets.\n   Consider\
    \ how a device's architecture may impact the handling of a\n   multicast frame.\
    \  For example, is the multicast packet subject to the\n   same processing as\
    \ its unicast analog?  Or is the multicast packet\n   treated as an exeception\
    \ and processed on a different data path?\n   Consider, too, how a shared memory\
    \ architecture may demonstrate a\n   different performance profile than an architecture\
    \ which explicitly\n   passes each individual packet between the processing entities.\n\
    \   In addition to forwarding device architecture, there are other\n   factors\
    \ that may impact a device's or system's multicast related\n   performance.  Protocol\
    \ requirements may demand that routers and\n   switches consider destination and\
    \ source addressing in its multicast\n   forwarding decisions.  Capturing multicast\
    \ source/destination\n   addressing information may impact forwarding table size\
    \ and lengthen\n   lookups.  Topological factors such as the degree of packet\n\
    \   replication, the number of multicast groups being supported by the\n   system,\
    \ or the placement of multicast packets in unicast wrappers to\n   span non-multicast\
    \ network paths may all potentially affect a\n   system's multicast related performance.\
    \ For an overall understanding\n   of IP multicasting, the reader is directed\
    \ to [Se98], [Hu95], and\n   [Mt98].\n   By clearly identifying IP multicast benchmarks\
    \ and related\n   terminology in this document, it is hoped that detailed methodologies\n\
    \   can be generated in subsequent documents.  Taken in tandem, these two\n  \
    \ efforts endeavor to assist the clinical, empirical, and consistent\n   characterization\
    \ of certain aspects of multicast technologies and\n   their individual implementations.\
    \  Understanding the operational\n   profile of multicast forwarding devices may\
    \ assist the network\n   designer to better deploy multicast in his or her networking\n\
    \   environment.\n   Moreover, this document focuses on one source to many destinations\n\
    \   profiling.  Elements of this document may require extension when\n   considering\
    \ multiple source to multiple destination IP multicast\n   communication.\n"

    \ forwarding\n      rate metric may yield information about the packet processing\n\
    \      ability of a device.  Collecting that same metric in view of\n      another\
    \ control variable can oftentimes be very insightful. Taking\n      that same\
    \ forwarding rate measurement, for instance, while the\n      device's address\
    \ table is injected with an additional 50,000\n      entries may yield a different\
    \ perspective.\n   Measurement units:\n      A burdened response is a type of\
    \ metric.  Metrics of this this\n      type must follow guidelines when reporting\
    \ results.\n      The metric's principal result MUST be reported in conjunction\
    \ with\n      the contributing factors.\n      For example, in reporting a Forwarding\
    \ Burdened Latency, the\n      latency measurement should be reported with respect\
    \ to\n      corresponding Offered Load and Forwarding Rates.\n   Issues: A Burdened\
    \ response may be very illuminating when trying to\n      characterize a single\
    \ device or system.  Extreme care must be\n      exercised when attempting to\
    \ use that characterization as a basis\n      of comparison with other devices\
    \ or systems.  Test agents must\n      ensure that the measured response is a\
    \ function of the controlled\n      stimulii, and not secondary factors.  An example\
    \ of of such an\n      interfering factor would be configuration mismatch of a\
    \ timer\n      impacting a response process.\n"

    \ It mandates that the DUT be\n      subjected to an additional measure of traffic\

    \ to different results, such as the\n      number or type of multicast-related\

    \      Because of the number of variables that could impact this metric,\n   \

    \ attempts to identify a simple delay, the\n      underlying and contributing\
    \ delay components (e.g., propagation\n      delay, frame processing delay, etc.)\
    \ make this a less than simple\n      measurement.  The corresponding methodology\
