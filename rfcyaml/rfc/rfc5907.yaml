  - "Abstract\n   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used in networks of all types
    and\n   sizes for time synchronization of servers, workstations, and other\n   networked
    equipment.  As time synchronization is more and more a\n   mission-critical service,
    standardized means for monitoring and\n   management of this subsystem of a networked
    host are required to\n   allow operators of such a service to set up a monitoring
    system that\n   is platform- and vendor-independent.  This document provides a\n
    \  standardized collection of data objects for monitoring the NTP entity\n   of
    such a network participant and it is part of the NTP version 4\n   standardization
    effort.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The NTPv4 MIB module is designed to allow Simple Network
    Management\n   Protocol (SNMP) to be used to monitor and manage local NTP [RFC5905]\n
    \  entities.  It provides a collection of data objects that can be\n   queried
    using the SNMP protocol and represent the current status of\n   the NTP entity.
    \ This includes general information about the NTP\n   entity itself (vendor, product,
    version) as well as connectivity to\n   upstream NTP servers used as sources of
    reference time and to\n   hardware reference clocks like radio clocks.  The most
    important\n   values are included in order to be able to detect failures before\n
    \  they can have an impact on the overall time synchronization status of\n   the
    network.  There are also a collection of notification objects to\n   inform about
    state changes in the NTP entity.  There are objects to\n   control these notifications
    as well.\n"

    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
  title: 3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
- contents:
  - "4.  Technical Description\n   The NTPv4 MIB module is divided into sections for
    general server\n   information, current NTP entity status, status information
    of all\n   mobilized associations (e.g., unicast upstream time servers,\n   multicast
    or broadcast, time references, and hardware clocks), NTP\n   entity control objects,
    NTP objects used only for notifications, as\n   well as SNMP notification definitions
    for core events.\n   The general server information section contains static information\n
    \  and can be queried to identify which NTP implementation is running on\n   a
    host.  This includes the vendor and product name of the running NTP\n   software
    as well as version information, hardware/os platform\n   identity, and the time
    resolution of the underlying OS.\n   Section 2 (current NTP status) includes data
    objects that represent\n   the current operational status of the NTP entity.\n
    \  The third section contains data objects that represent the set of\n   time
    references (\"associations\") with which the NTP entity is\n   currently working.\n
    \  The fourth section contains objects that can be used to control the\n   NTP
    entity.  The currently defined objects control how often the\n   heartbeat interval
    notification is sent out and which notifications\n   are enabled.\n   The fifth
    section contains objects that are only used as varbinds in\n   notifications.
    \ There is currently only one object in this section --\n   a message that adds
    a cleartext event message to notifications.\n   Certain important events can occur
    while the NTP entity is running.\n   The notification section defines SNMP notifications
    for a collection\n   of the most important ones (\"core events\") and additionally
    provides\n   a heartbeat notification as well as a test notification to allow\n
    \  management systems to test the reception of NTP-related notifications\n   as
    well as enable heartbeat-based monitoring systems to assure that\n   the NTP entity
    is still up and running.\n   Some values are included both in numeric and in human-readable\n
    \  (string) format.  This has been done to simplify the representation\n   of
    a status information.  If the two representations of a certain\n   value differ,
    the numeric representation takes precedence.\n"

  title: 6.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are currently two management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These are the objects and their sensitivity/\n   vulnerability:\n   ntpEntHeartbeatInterval
    controls the interval of heartbeat\n   notifications.  If set to 1, this will
    cause the NTP entity to send\n   one notification each second.  This is the maximum
    rate (1/s) that\n   can be generated automatically.  If it is set to 0, then one
    single\n   hearbeat notification will be created and no further automatically\n
    \  generated notification is sent.  This functionality can be used to\n   create
    notifications at a higher rate (as high as the object can be\n   written).\n   ntpEntNotifBits
    enables/disables notifications.  Could be used to\n   switch off notifications
    in order to delay or eliminate the\n   notification for critical and important
    events.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with
    a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable
    in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or
    NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of
    these objects when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the
    tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   ntpEntSoftwareName,
    ntpEntSoftwareVersion, ntpEntSoftwareVendor, and\n   ntpEntSystemType all can
    be used to identify software and its version\n   as well as the operating system
    and hardware platform.  This might\n   help a potential attacker to find security
    problems and therefore can\n   be used in the preparation of an attack.\n   SNMP
    versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network
    itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control
    as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects\n   in this MIB module.  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider
    the\n   security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see RFC 3410\n
    \  [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3\n   cryptographic
    mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).  Further,\n   deployment of SNMP
    versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to
    deploy SNMPv3 and to enable\n   cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n"
