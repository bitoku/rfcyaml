  - "                  TWO CHANGES T0 THE IMP/HOST PROTOCOL\n                TO IMPROVE\
    \ USER/NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS*\n1.  A Reminder\n    When a host receives an IMP-Going\
    \ Down message from its IMP (see\npage 3-15 of BBN Report 1822, Specifications\
    \ for the Interconnection of\na Host and an IMP), the Host should forward the\
    \ information included in\nthe IMP-Going-Down message to its users from the network\
    \ and its local\nusers of the network.  Further, we suggest that the Host keep\
    \ this\ninformation around after the IMP has gone down, in order to tell local\n\
    users who are attempting to use the network.\n    In the next two sections of\
    \ the RFC, we describe modifications to\nthe IMP/Host protocol which will allow\
    \ the IMPs to distribute the same\nsort of information about Hosts which are down.\n\
    2.  Expansion of the Host-Going-Down Message\n    The type 2, Host-Going-Down,\
    \ message described on page 3-1l of BBN\nReport 1822 has not previously allowed\
    \ for any provision by the Host for\nadditional information such as why, when,\
    \ and for how long the Host is\ngoing down. The following describes a modification\
    \ to the Host-Going-\nDown message which permits the Host to supply this additiona1\n\
    information.\n    In a type 2, Host-Going-Down message, bits 17-28 give the time\
    \ of\nthe Host's coming back up, bit-coded as follows:\nbits 17-19:  the day of\
    \ the week the Host is coming back up. Monday is\n             day 0 and Sunday\
    \ is day 6.\nbits 20-24:  the hour of the day, from hour 0 to hour 23, that the\
    \ Host\n             is coming back up.\nbits 25-28:  the five minute interval,\
    \ from 0 to 11, in the hour that\n             the Host is coning back up.\n----------\n\
    *Please file this RFC with your copy of BBN Report 1822 until that\nreport is\
    \ updated.\nAll three of the above or to be specified in Universal time (i.e.,\n\
    G.M.T.).  The Host may indicate that it will be coming back up more than\na week\
    \ away by setting bits 17-28 all to ones.  Setting all bits 17-27\nto one and\
    \ bit 28 to zero means it is unknown when the host is coming\nback up.\n    Bits\
    \ 29-32 of the Host-Going-Down message should be used by the Host\nto specify\
    \ the reason it is going down.  These bits are coded as\nfollows:\nValue     Meaning\n\
    -----     -------\n0-4       Reserved for IMP use (see Section 3 below)\n5   \
    \      Scheduled P.M.\n6         Scheduled Hardware Work\n7         Scheduled\
    \ Software Work\n8         Emergency Restart\n9         Power Outage\n10     \
    \   Software Breakpoint\n11        Hardware Failure\nl2-15     Currently Unused\n\
    \    It is assumed that as the time for the Host to go down approaches,\nthe Host\
    \ itself will send warning messages to its network users.  Just\nbefore going\
    \ down, the Host should send the Host-Going-Down message to\nits IMP.  The IMP\
    \ will store this message and return it to the source\nHost along with Destination\
    \ (Host) Dead messages.  The IMP will try to\npreserve this message over IMP reloads\
    \ where appropriate.  The NCC will\nbe able to update manually the stored copy\
    \ of this message in response\nto a phone call from the Host site in the event\
    \ the Host is going to be\ndown longer than it said or if it didn't have time\
    \ to say before going\ndown.\n3.  Addition of the Dead Host Status Message\n \
    \   The type 7, destination dead, message described on page 3-16 of BBN\nReport\
    \ 1822, does not allow for providing the reason for the Destination\nHost's being\
    \ \"dead\".  An additional IMP to Host message is therefore\nbeing added which\
    \ provides status information on the dead Host.  This\nmessage is type 6, Dead\
    \ Host Status, and will provide the additional\ninformation as follows:\n    Bits\
    \ 17-28 have the same meanings as bits 17-28 in the Host-Going-\n    Down message\
    \ described in Section 2 above.\n    Bits 29-32 have the following meanings:\n\
    \        Value  Meaning\n        -----  -------\n        0      The destination\
    \ Host is not communicating with the\n               network -- the destination\
    \ IMP has no information about\n               the cause.  Note that this is the\
    \ message most likely to\n               occur if the destination IMP has gone\
    \ down since the\n               destination Host went down.\n        1      The\
    \ destination Host is not communicating with the\n               network -- it\
    \ took its ready-line down without saying\n               why.\n        2    \
    \  The destination Host is not communicating with the\n               network\
    \ -- the Host was tardy in taking traffic from the\n               network and\
    \ the network had to declare the Host down.\n        3      The destination Host\
    \ does not exist to the knowledge of\n               the NCC.\n        4     \
    \ Currently unused.\n        5      The destination Host is down for scheduled\
    \ P.M.\n        6      The destination Host is down for scheduled hardware work.\n\
    \        7      The destination Host is down for scheduled software work.\n  \
    \      8      The destination Host is down for emergency restart.\n        9 \
    \     The destination Host is down because of power outage.\n        10     The\
    \ destination host is stopped at a software breakpoint.\n        11     The destination\
    \ Host is down because of a hardware\n               failure.\n        12-15 \
    \ Currently unused.\n    When the value of this 4-bit field is 0,1,2, or 3, bits\
    \ 17-28 will\nhave the \"unknown\" indication.\n    Bit 1 in this message will\
    \ always be set to zero and Hosts receiving\nthis message should discard without\
    \ reporting an error type 6 messages\nwith bit 1 set to 1.  This will allow later\
    \ addition of similar status\ninformation on dead destination IMPs.\n    The Dead\
    \ Host Status message will be returned to the source Host\nshortly (immediately,\
    \ if possible) after each Destination Host Dead\nmessage. The Destination Host\
    \ Dead message applies to a specific\nmessage-id (link) although the information\
    \ contained in the Destination\nHost Dead message should probably be reported\
    \ to all users connected to\nthe dead Host.  The Dead Host Status message does\
    \ not apply to a\nspecific message-id (link) and all users connected to the dead\
    \ Host\nshould be notified of the information contained in the Dead Host Status\n\
    message.\n    The modifications mentioned in Section 2 and 3 above will be put\n\
    into the network very soon, and we urge the Hosts to implement the code\nnecessary\
    \ to take advantage of these modifications as soon as possible.\nThis modification\
    \ is backward compatible with the exception (!) that\nHosts which have not done\
    \ the implementation can receive a type 6\nmessage which they do not know how\
    \ To handle and will presumably log as\nan error.\n       [ This RFC was put into\
    \ machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by\
