Abstract This RFC describes IBM's SNMP support for SNA Advanced Peer to Peer Networking (APPN) nodes.
This module contains managed objects which describe the following:
The APPN node (either an APPN network node or an APPN end node)
The connections of the node to other SNA nodes
The APPN network topology (as reflected in the network topology database that is replicated in each APPN network node.
This module does not describe the SNA logical units (LUs) served by the APPN node nor does it describe the sessions between LUs.
Managed objects for that information are under development.

This group will be used to represent the entire APPN network   topology, including Network nodes, virtual nodes and   all TGs associated with these nodes.
The APPN topology database consists of information about every   APPN network node.
This information is learned over time   as each network node exchanges topology information with   each of its adjacent network nodes.
The database consists   of information about each node and all of the transmissions   groups used by each node.
Information about virtual nodes (connection networks) is treated   the same as information about network node   and is replicated at each network node.
The node name is the only meaningful information.
The other   node objects use default values.
Each node that has defined   a TG with this virtual node as the destination also defines a   TG on this virtual node.
There is a TG record for each node   that uses this virtual node.
The APPN node table represents the APPN topology   database with the APPN CP fully qualified name   being used as the index to this table.
This entire table could be retrieved using the GET NEXT command,   however, due to the dynamics of APPN, nodes could come and   go and status could change as the table is being   retrieved.
Although in most cases the data retrieved will be valid,   missing and invalid status could cause problems for   a management application that was graphically displaying   this data.
This potential problem can be eliminated by   retrieving the FRSN before and after completion   of retrieval of the APPN topology table.
If the FRSN has changed, then repeat the   retrieval of the entire topology table   until the FRSN remains unchanged.
Object 'appnNnFrsn' represents the last   change or update to this node's topology   database.
TG table (entry for each TG owned by node)
Due to SNMP ASN.1 limitations, we cannot represent   the TG table within the node table.
We define   separate tables for nodes and TGs, adding the node   name to each TG entry to provide a means of   correlating each TG with its originating node.
