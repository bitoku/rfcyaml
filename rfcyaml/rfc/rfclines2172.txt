Authors' Note This memo documents the parameters used in the Multiple Access Protocol over SONET/SDH Version 1.
This document is NOT the product of an IETF working group nor is it a standards track document.
It has not necessarily benefited from the widespread and in depth community review that standards track documents receive.
This document describes the protocol parameters used in the Multiple Access Over SONET/SDH (MAPOS) version 1.
MAPOS is a link layer protocol and provides multiple access capability over SONET/SDH links.
Introduction Multiple Access Protocol over SONET/SDH (MAPOS)
[1] is a high speed link layer protocol that provides multiple access capability over SONET(Synchronous Optical Network)/SDH(Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)[2][3][4][5].
Its frame format is based on the HDLC like framing [6] for PPP.
A component called "Frame Switch" [1] allows multiple nodes to be connected together in a star topology to form a LAN.
Using long haul SONET/SDH links, the nodes on such a "SONET LAN" can span over a wide geographical area.
The Internet Protocol (IP) [
7] datagrams are transmitted in MAPOS HDLC frames [8].
This document describes the protocol parameters used in MAPOS version 1 [1].
The MAPOS Version 1 Data Link Layer [1] contains a 16 bit Protocol field to identify the the encapsulated protocol.
The Protocol field is consistent with the ISO 3309 (HDLC) extension mechanism for address fields.
All protocol numbers MUST be assigned such that the least significant bit of the most significant octet equals "0", and the least significant bit of the least significant octet equals "1".
