  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the semantics of a Route Origin Authorization\n\
    \   (ROA) in terms of the context of an application of the Resource\n   Public\
    \ Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480] to validate the\n   origination of routes\
    \ advertised in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)\n   [RFC4271].\n   The RPKI\
    \ is based on a hierarchy of resource certificates that are\n   aligned to the\
    \ Internet Number Resource allocation structure.\n   Resource certificates are\
    \ X.509 certificates that conform to the PKIX\n   profile [RFC5280], and to the\
    \ extensions for IP addresses and AS\n   identifiers [RFC3779].  A resource certificate\
    \ describes an action by\n   an issuer that binds a list of IP address blocks\
    \ and Autonomous\n   System (AS) numbers to the subject of a certificate, identified\
    \ by\n   the unique association of the subject's private key with the public\n\
    \   key contained in the resource certificate.  The RPKI is structured\n   such\
    \ that each current resource certificate matches a current\n   resource allocation\
    \ or assignment.  This is further described in\n   [RFC6480].\n   ROAs are digitally\
    \ signed objects that bind an address to an AS\n   number, and are signed by the\
    \ address holder.  A ROA provides a means\n   of verifying that an IP address\
    \ block holder has authorized a\n   particular AS to originate routes in the inter-domain\
    \ routing\n   environment for that address block.  ROAs are described in [RFC6482].\n\
    \   ROAs are intended to fit within the requirements for adding security\n   to\
    \ inter-domain routing.\n   This document describes the semantic interpretation\
    \ of a ROA, with\n   particular reference to application in inter-domain routing\
    \ relating\n   to the origination of routes, and the intended scope of the authority\n\
    \   that is conveyed in the ROA.\n"
- title: 2.  ROA Validation Outcomes for a Route
  contents:
  - "2.  ROA Validation Outcomes for a Route\n   A \"route\" is unit of information\
    \ that associates a set of\n   destinations described by an IP address prefix\
    \ with a set of\n   attributes of a path to those destinations, as defined in\
    \ Section 1.1\n   of [RFC4271].\n   A route's \"origin AS\" is defined as follows:\
    \ If the final path\n   segment of the AS_PATH is of type AS_SEQUENCE, the origin\
    \ AS is the\n   first element of the sequence (i.e., the AS in the rightmost position\n\
    \   with respect to the position of octets in the protocol message).  If\n   the\
    \ AS_PATH contains a path segment of type AS_SET, indicating that\n   the route\
    \ is an aggregate, then the origin AS cannot be determined.\n   In terms of validation\
    \ of a route in the context of a routing\n   environment, the address prefix value\
    \ and the origin AS are used in\n   the ROA validation operation.\n   It is assumed\
    \ here that a relying party (RP) has access to a local\n   cache of the complete\
    \ set of valid ROAs when performing validation of\n   a route.  (Valid ROAs are\
    \ defined as ROAs that are determined to be\n   syntactically correct and are\
    \ signed using a signature that can be\n   verified using the RPKI, as described\
    \ in [RFC6482].)  The RP needs to\n   match a route to one or more valid candidate\
    \ ROAs in order to\n   determine a validation outcome, which, in turn, can be\
    \ used to\n   determine the appropriate local actions to perform on the route.\n\
    \   This approach to route origination validation uses a generic model of\n  \
    \ \"positive\" attestation that has an associated inference that routes\n   that\
    \ cannot be validated within the RPKI framework would\n   conventionally be interpreted\
    \ by an RP as \"invalid\".  However, the\n   considerations of accommodating environments\
    \ of partial adoption of\n   the use of ROAs, where only a subset of validly advertised\
    \ address\n   prefixes have associated published ROAs within the structure of\
    \ the\n   RPKI, imply some modification to this model of positive attestation.\n\
    \   In the context of route validation, it is assumed that once an\n   address\
    \ prefix is described in a ROA, then this ROA specifically\n   encompasses all\
    \ address prefixes that are more specific than that\n   described in the ROA.\
    \  Thus, any route for a more specific address\n   prefix than that described\
    \ by any valid ROA that does not itself have\n   a matching valid ROA can be considered\
    \ \"invalid\".  However, routes\n   for address prefixes that are not fully described\
    \ by any single ROA\n   (i.e., those routes whose address prefixes may be an aggregate\
    \ of\n   address prefixes described in a valid ROA, or have address prefixes\n\
    \   where there is no intersection with any valid ROA), and are not\n   matched\
    \ by any valid ROA and do not have an address prefix that is a\n   more specific\
    \ address prefix described in any valid ROA, cannot be\n   reliably classified\
    \ as \"invalid\" in a partial deployment scenario.\n   Such routes have a validation\
    \ outcome of \"unknown\".\n   An abstract attribute of a route can be determined\
    \ as the outcome of\n   this validation procedure, namely a \"validity state\"\
    \ [BGP-PFX].  The\n   validity state of a route, with a prefix and an origin AS\
    \ as defined\n   above, when using single ROA for determining this validity state,\
    \ is\n   summarized in the following table:\n           Route    matching  non-matching\n\
    \      Prefix   AS->   AS         AS\n       V           +---------+---------+\n\
    \      Non-         | unknown | unknown |\n      Intersecting |         |    \
    \     |\n                   +---------+---------+\n      Covering     | unknown\
    \ | unknown |\n      Aggregate    |         |         |\n                   +---------+---------+\n\
    \      match ROA    | valid   | invalid |\n      prefix       |         |    \
    \     |\n                   +---------+---------+\n      More         |      \
    \   |         |\n      Specific     | invalid | invalid |\n      than ROA    \

    \        Route's Validity State\n   In an environment of a collection of valid\
    \ ROAs, a route's validity\n   state is considered to be \"valid\" if any ROA\
    \ provides a \"valid\"\n   outcome.  It's validity state is considered to be \"\
    invalid\" if one\n   (or more) ROAs provide an \"invalid\" outcome and no ROAs\
    \ provide a\n   \"valid\" outcome.  Its validity state is considered to be \"\
    unknown\"\n   (or, synonymously, \"not found\" [BGP-PFX]) when no valid ROA can\n\
    \   produce either a \"valid\" or an \"invalid\" validity state outcome.\n   A\
    \ route validity state is defined by the following procedure:\n      1. Select\
    \ all valid ROAs that include a ROAIPAddress value that\n         either matches,\
    \ or is a covering aggregate of, the address\n         prefix in the route.  This\
    \ selection forms the set of\n         \"candidate ROAs\".\n      2. If the set\
    \ of candidate ROAs is empty, then the procedure stops\n         with an outcome\
    \ of \"unknown\" (or, synonymously, \"not found\", as\n         used in [BGP-PFX]).\n\
    \      3. If the route's origin AS can be determined and any of the set\n    \
    \     of candidate ROAs has an asID value that matches the origin AS\n       \
    \  in the route, and the route's address prefix matches a\n         ROAIPAddress\
    \ in the ROA (where \"match\" is defined as where the\n         route's address\
    \ precisely matches the ROAIPAddress, or where\n         the ROAIPAddress includes\
    \ a maxLength element, and the route's\n         address prefix is a more specific\
    \ prefix of the ROAIPAddress,\n         and the route's address prefix length\
    \ value is less than or\n         equal to the ROAIPAddress maxLength value),\
    \ then the procedure\n         halts with an outcome of \"valid\".\n      4. Otherwise,\
    \ the procedure halts with an outcome of \"invalid\".\n"
- title: 3.  Applying Validation Outcomes to Route Selection
  contents:
  - "3.  Applying Validation Outcomes to Route Selection\n   Within the framework\
    \ of the abstract model of the operation of inter-\n   domain routing using BGP\
    \ [RFC4271], a received prefix announcement\n   from a routing peer is compared\
    \ to all announcements for this prefix\n   received from other routing peers,\
    \ and a route selection procedure is\n   used to select the \"best\" route from\
    \ this candidate set.\n   The route's validity state, described in Section 2,\
    \ of \"valid\",\n   \"invalid\", or \"unknown\" may be used as part of the determination\
    \ of\n   the local degree of preference, in which case the local order of\n  \
    \ preference is as follows:\n      \"valid\" is to be preferred over\n      \"\
    unknown\", which is to be preferred over\n      \"invalid\".\n   It is a matter\
    \ of local routing policy as to the actions to be\n   undertaken by a routing\
    \ entity in processing those routes with\n   \"unknown\" validity states.  Due\
    \ to considerations of partial use of\n   ROAs in heterogeneous environments,\
    \ such as in the public Internet,\n   it is advised that local policy settings\
    \ should not result in\n   \"unknown\" validity state outcomes being considered\
    \ as sufficient\n   grounds to reject a route outright from further consideration\
    \ as a\n   local best route.\n   It is a matter of local routing policy as to\
    \ whether routes with an\n   \"invalid\" validity state are considered to be ineligible\
    \ for further\n   consideration in a route selection process.  Potential circular\n\
    \   dependence is a consideration here: if the authoritative publication\n   point\
    \ of the repository of ROAs, or that of any certificate used in\n   relation to\
    \ an address prefix, is located at an address that lies\n   within the address\
    \ prefix described in a ROA, then the repository can\n   only be accessed by the\
    \ RP once a route for the prefix has been\n   accepted by the RP's local routing\
    \ domain.  It is also noted that the\n   propagation time of RPKI objects may\
    \ be different to the propagation\n   time of routes, and that routes may be learned\
    \ by an RP's routing\n   system before the RP's local RPKI repository cache picks\
    \ up the\n   associated ROAs and recognizes them as having a validity state of\n\
    \   \"valid\" within the RPKI.\n"
- title: 4.  Disavowal of Routing Origination
  contents:
  - "4.  Disavowal of Routing Origination\n   A ROA is a positive attestation that\
    \ a prefix holder has authorized\n   an AS to originate a route for this prefix\
    \ into the inter-domain\n   routing system.  It is possible for a prefix holder\
    \ to construct an\n   authorization where no valid AS has been granted any such\
    \ authority\n   to originate a route for an address prefix.  This is achieved\
    \ by\n   using a ROA where the ROA's subject AS is one that must not be used\n\
    \   in any routing context.  Specifically, AS 0 is reserved by the IANA\n   such\
    \ that it may be used to identify non-routed networks [IANA-AS].\n   A ROA with\
    \ a subject of AS 0 (AS 0 ROA) is an attestation by the\n   holder of a prefix\
    \ that the prefix described in the ROA, and any more\n   specific prefix, should\
    \ not be used in a routing context.\n   The route validation procedure, described\
    \ in Section 2, will provide\n   a \"valid\" outcome if any ROA matches the address\
    \ prefix and origin\n   AS, even if other valid ROAs would provide an \"invalid\"\
    \ validation\n   outcome if used in isolation.  Consequently, an AS 0 ROA has\
    \ a lower\n   relative preference than any other ROA that has a routable AS as\
    \ its\n   subject.  This allows a prefix holder to use an AS 0 ROA to declare\
    \ a\n   default condition that any route that is equal to or more specific\n \
    \  than the prefix to be considered \"invalid\", while also allowing other\n \
    \  concurrently issued ROAs to describe valid origination authorizations\n   for\
    \ more specific prefixes.\n   By convention, an AS 0 ROA should have a maxLength\
    \ value of 32 for\n   IPv4 addresses and a maxlength value of 128 for IPv6 addresses;\n\
    \   although, in terms of route validation, the same outcome would be\n   achieved\
    \ with any valid maxLength value, or even if the maxLength\n   element were to\
    \ be omitted from the ROA.\n   Also by convention, an AS 0 ROA should be the only\
    \ ROA issued for a\n   given address prefix; although again, this is not a strict\n\
    \   requirement.  An AS 0 ROA may coexist with ROAs that have different\n   subject\
    \ AS values; although in such cases, the presence or lack of\n   presence of the\
    \ AS 0 ROA does not alter the route's validity state in\n   any way.\n"
- title: 5.  Route Validation Lifetime
  contents:
  - "5.  Route Validation Lifetime\n   The \"lifetime\" of a validation outcome refers\
    \ to the time period\n   during which the original validation outcome can be still\
    \ applied.\n   The implicit assumption here is that when the validation lifetime\n\
    \   \"expires\", the route should be re-tested for validity.\n   The validation\
    \ lifetime for a ROA is controlled by the Valid times\n   specified in the end-entity\
    \ (EE) certificate used to sign the ROA,\n   and the valid times of those certificates\
    \ in the certification path\n   used to validate the EE certificate.  A ROA validation\
    \ expires at the\n   notAfter field of the signing EE certificate, or at such\
    \ a time when\n   there is no certification path that can validate the ROA.  A\
    \ ROA\n   issuer may elect to prematurely invalidate a ROA by revoking the EE\n\
    \   certificate that was used to sign the ROA.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   ROA issuers should be aware of the validation\
    \ implication in issuing\n   a ROA, in that a ROA implicitly invalidates all routes\
    \ that have more\n   specific prefixes with a prefix length greater than maxLength,\
    \ and\n   all originating AS's other than the AS listed in the collection of\n\
    \   ROAs for this prefix.\n   A conservative operational practice would be to\
    \ ensure the issuing of\n   ROAs for all more specific prefixes with distinct\
    \ origination ASes\n   prior to the issuing of ROAs for larger encompassing address\
    \ blocks,\n   in order to avoid inadvertent invalidation of valid routes during\
    \ ROA\n   generation.\n   ROA issuers should also be aware that if they generate\
    \ a ROA for one\n   origin AS, then if the address prefix holder authorizes multiple\
    \ ASes\n   to originate routes for a given address prefix, then is necessary for\n\
    \   a ROA be generated for every such authorized AS.\n"
