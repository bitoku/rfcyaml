  - "1.0 Introduction\n   A meeting of groups involved in the development of the DNS\
    \ Security\n   Extensions (DNSSEC) was held in conjunction with the 49th IETF.\
    \  The\n   discussion covered the extent of current efforts, a discussion of\n\
    \   what questions are being asked of DNSSEC, and what is needed by the\n   IETF\
    \ to progress the definition to the Draft Standard level.\n   DNSSEC [RFC 2535]\
    \ has been under consideration for quite a few years,\n   with RFC 2535 being\
    \ the core of the most recent definition.  DNSSEC\n   is part of the charter of\
    \ two working groups, DNSEXT and DNSOP.\n   ISC's BIND v8.2 implemented part of\
    \ the specification, BIND v9\n   represents the first full implementation.  In\
    \ 1999 and 2000, more\n   than a half dozen workshops have been held to test the\
    \ concepts and\n   the earliest versions of implementations.  But to date, DNSSEC\
    \ is not\n   in common use.\n   The current collective wisdom is that DNSSEC is\
    \ 1) important, 2) a\n   buzzword, 3) hard, 4) immature.  To capture the true\
    \ state of the\n   technology and identify where work is needed, an informal gathering\n\
    \   of groups known to be involved in DNSSEC was held in conjunction with\n  \
    \ the 49th IETF.  The attendees represented NLnet Labs, The Foundation\n   for\
    \ Internet Infrastructure, RIPE NCC, ARIN, CAIRN (ISI and NAI\n   Labs), NIST,\
    \ DISA, RSSAC, Network Associates and Verisign\n   (COM/NET/ORG TLDs).\n   The\
    \ agenda of the meeting consisted of three items.  Reports from\n   each group\
    \ on their current research goals were followed by a\n   discussion of questions\
    \ being asked of DNSSEC.  Finally, with\n   reaching Draft Standard status as\
    \ a goal, what was needed to make\n   this happen was considered.\n   This report\
    \ is not simply a transcript of the meeting, it is a\n   summary.  Some of the\
    \ information presented here was obtained in\n   direct contact with participants\
    \ after the meeting.\n"
- title: 1.1 What does the term "DNSSEC" mean?
  contents:
  - "1.1 What does the term \"DNSSEC\" mean?\n   One of the comments made during discussions\
    \ is that DNSSEC does not\n   refer to just one monolithic technology.  The term\
    \ has come to refer\n   to \"toolbox\" of techniques and methodologies, that when\
    \ used properly\n   can improve the integrity of the DNS.  Given this observation,\
    \ it can\n   be seen that some portions of DNSSEC are evolving much more rapidly\n\
    \   than other portions.  In particular, TSIG [RFC 2845] has certainly\n   reached\
    \ a level \"being deployable\" for zone transfers.\n   The following four components\
    \ are considered to be part of DNSSEC.\n   The concept of digital signature protection\
    \ of DNS traffic as\n   described in RFC 2535 and a few support documents (such\
    \ as [RFC\n   3008]), which is designed to protect the transfer of data on an\n\
    \   Internet scale.  The concept of protecting queries and responses\n   through\
    \ the less-scalable but more efficient TSIG mechanism [RFC\n   2845], which has\
    \ applicability to zone transfers, DHCP registrations,\n   and other resolver\
    \ to name server traffic.  Secure dynamic updates\n   [RFC 3007], by virtue of\
    \ using TSIG, can be considered to be part of\n   DNSSEC.  Finally, the definition\
    \ of the CERT resource record [RFC\n   2538] gives DNS the ability to become a\
    \ distribution mechanism for\n   security data.\n   This definition of the components\
    \ of DNSSEC is in no way definitive.\n   To be honest, this is a somewhat artificial\
    \ grouping.  DNSSEC does\n   not encompass all of the security practiced in DNS\
    \ today, for\n   example, the redefinition of when and how data is cached [RFC\
    \ 2181],\n   plays a big role in hardening the DNS system.  The four elements\
    \ of\n   DNSSEC described in the previous paragraph are grouped together\n   mostly\
    \ because they do interrelate, but also they were developed at\n   approximately\
    \ the same time.\n"
- title: 2.0 Group Reports
  contents:
  - "2.0 Group Reports\n   The first part of the meeting consisted of reports of goals.\
    \  From\n   this a taxonomy of efforts has been made to see if there are gaps\
    \ in\n   the work.\n"
- title: 2.1 NLnet Labs
  contents:
  - "2.1 NLnet Labs\n   Efforts by NLnet Labs are directed towards yielding an understanding\n\
    \   of the impact of DNSSEC on ccTLDs, specifically .de (Germany), .nl\n   (The\
    \ Netherlands), and .se (Sweden).  Work to date has studied the\n   problem of\
    \ applying digital signatures and NXT records to a zone.\n   The conclusion drawn\
    \ is that there are no real problems regarding\n   memory or CPU speed when signing\
    \ large zones, not even for \".com.\"\n   NLnet Labs has offered to work with\
    \ Verisign to examine this further.\n   NLnet Labs is trying to define and document\
    \ procedures for TLD\n   registries, registrars and registrants to properly handle\
    \ actions\n   like zone-resigning and key-rollover at the root, TLD, and lower\n\
    \   levels.  The outcome so far is that the DNSOP Roll Over proposal\n   seems\
    \ impractical or possibly even impossible to implement at large\n   TLDs.  NLnet\
    \ Labs will produce a draft on an alternative KEY+SIG\n   handling scheme where\
    \ SIGs are only kept in the zone where the\n   corresponding zone-KEY is located.\
    \  This scheme reduces the necessary\n   actions for resigning zones from 2 levels\
    \ (current zone and all\n   children) to 1 level (current zone), and for key-rollover\
    \ from 3\n   levels (parent, current zone and all children) to 2 levels (parent\n\
    \   and current zone).\n"
- title: 2.2 Verisign
  contents:
  - "2.2 Verisign\n   Verisign's registry operations and corporate components have\
    \ been\n   investigating what DNSSEC means to very large zones, not just from\
    \ a\n   hardware point of view, but from an institutional point of view.\n   With\
    \ the service of providing delegations already commercialized,\n   they are attempting\
    \ to define what it would take to provide a DNSSEC\n   service.  An important\
    \ issue is the parent validation of each\n   delegated zone's keys.\n"
- title: 2.3 The Foundation for Internet Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "2.3 The Foundation for Internet Infrastructure\n   The Foundation for Internet\
    \ Infrastructure, an organization in\n   Sweden, is running a project with two\
    \ parts.  One part is directed at\n   the \"topology\" of the participants in\
    \ DNSSEC, the other part of the\n   project is directed towards general development\
    \ of tools.\n   The study is examining the administrative issues of running DNSSEC.\n\
    \   One issue is the possible 4-party interaction in the use of DNSSEC.\n   The\
    \ four parties are the registry, the registrar, the registrant, and\n   the DNS\
    \ operator.  Of these four parties, any combination may occur\n   within one entity,\
    \ such as a registrant that operates their own DNS\n   as part of their information\
    \ technology department.\n   The other part of the study is looking at what happens\
    \ in the\n   resolver.  Goals include DNSSEC-enabling tools such as ISAKMPd (an\n\
    \   IPSEC key negotiation software) secure NTP4, and e-mail.  Part of\n   this\
    \ effort is implemented in the sigz.net experiment, information on\n   this exists\
    \ at www.sigz.net.\n"
- title: 2.4 RSSAC
  contents:
  - "2.4 RSSAC\n   The RSSAC (Root Server System Advisory Committee) has come to the\n\
    \   conclusion that TSIG is worthwhile and should be deployed.  There is\n   no\
    \ schedule for deployment, however.\n   As for the rest of DNSSEC, there is a\
    \ need to better understand the\n   impact of the new features before being introduced\
    \ into production.\n   Currently issues regarding potential testbeds are being\
    \ documented.\n   Two fundamental assumptions are that a DNSSEC testbed involving\
    \ the\n   root servers is desirable and that such a testbed would allow for\n\
    \   long term testing.  The latter assumption is based upon the need to\n   understand\
    \ how repeated zone key validations can occur at multiple\n   independent levels\
    \ of the DNS hierarchy.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.5 CAIRN\n   CAIRN (Collaborative Advanced Interagency Research Network) is\
    \ a\n   DARPA-sponsored network for collaborative research.  A funded\n   activity\
    \ that involves DNSSEC is FMESHD, shorthand for Fault-Tolerant\n   Mesh of Trust\
    \ in DNSSEC.  The effort of this activity is to determine\n   a means of building\
    \ a resolver's chain of trust when some of the DNS\n   tree is unavailable or\
    \ unsecured.  An early deliverable of this is an\n   extension of secure shell\
    \ to retrieve keys from DNSSEC.  As part of\n   this activity, the use of DNSSEC\
    \ in a non-major provider zone is\n   being implemented and studied.\n"
- title: 2.6 NIST
  contents:
  - "2.6 NIST\n   NIST is collecting performance information regarding DNSSEC.  One\
    \ of\n   the fears in adopting DNSSEC is the workload it adds to existing DNS\n\
    \   machine workload.  The hopes of this effort is to quantify the fear,\n   to\
    \ see if it is real or imagined.\n   If time permits, there may be an effort to\
    \ implement a zone integrity\n   checking program (implemented in Java) that will\
    \ look for missteps in\n   the use of DNSSEC.  Base code exists, but needs work\
    \ (beyond the\n   current baseline).\n"

    \ and that BIND is available on the operating\n   systems in use by the US Department\

    \ zones (signing, key\n   management), and is starting in the use (resolver) of\
    \ DNSSEC secured\n   data.\n   From the discussion, there were no apparent areas\
    \ lacking attention.\n   Additional input in some areas is needed however, particularly\

- title: 4.0 Questions facing DNSSEC
  contents:
  - "4.0 Questions facing DNSSEC\n   By the 49th IETF meeting, the most pressing question\
    \ on DNSSEC is \"is\n   it deployable?\"  From just the emphasis placed on this\
    \ question, the\n   meeting generated a list of questions and made sure that either\
    \ the\n   answer was known, or work was being done to address the question.\n"
- title: 4.1 Is it deployable?  When?
  contents:
  - "4.1 Is it deployable?  When?\n   The usual answer to this has been \"not now.\"\
    \  When is always off into\n   the future - \"about a year.\"  To get to a deployable\
    \ point, a series\n   of workshops have been held since the spring of 1999.\n\
    \   At this point, it is becoming clearer that longer term workshops are\n   needed.\
    \  In going through the motions of any workshop, the number of\n   issues raised\
    \ that impact the protocol's specification is\n   diminishing, as well as implementation\
    \ issues.  As such, one or two\n   day workshops have been helping less and less\
    \ in reaching deployment.\n   What is needed is to run longer term test configurations,\
    \ possibly\n   workshops that are help in conjunction with other events and that\n\
    \   assume continuity.  This will allow a better assessment of the issues\n  \
    \ that involve the passage of time - expirations on key validations,\n   etc.\n\
    \   As was noted in section 1.1, and touched on in section 2, one\n   component\
    \ of DNSSEC, TSIG, is more advanced that the others.  Use of\n   TSIG to protect\
    \ zone transfers is already matured to the \"really good\n   idea to do stage\"\
    \ even if other elements of DNSSEC are not.  Using\n   TSIG to protect traffic\
    \ between local resolver and their \"default\"\n   recursive name server still\
    \ needs more work, however.\n"
- title: 4.2 Does DNSSEC work?  Is it the right approach?
  contents:
  - "4.2 Does DNSSEC work?  Is it the right approach?\n   Currently there is a lot\
    \ of effort into making the specification as\n   proposed work.  There is some\
    \ effort in assessing the specification\n   at this point, particularly the value\
    \ of the NXT records and possible\n   replacements of it.\n   There seems little\
    \ question on value of the KEY and SIG records.\n   There is some research still\
    \ needed on KEY validation across zone\n   boundaries.  Such work is at least\
    \ scheduled.\n"
- title: 4.3 How will client software make use of DNSSEC?
  contents:
  - "4.3 How will client software make use of DNSSEC?\n   There are a number of efforts\
    \ to take existing applications and have\n   them make direct use of DNSSEC to\
    \ carry out their functions.  One\n   such example is secure shell.\n   When or\
    \ whether DNSSEC will be understood in the (using POSIX-like\n   terms) operating\
    \ systems \"gethostbyname\" and similar routines has not\n   been addressed.\n"
- title: 4.4 What are the remaining issues?
  contents:
  - "4.4 What are the remaining issues?\n   There are still a few protocol issues.\
    \  The NXT resource record is\n   designed to provide a means to authentically\
    \ deny data exists.  The\n   problem is that the solution proposed may be worse\
    \ than the problem,\n   in the eyes of some.  There is an alternative proposal,\
    \ the NO\n   resource record, under consideration in the DNSEXT working group.\
    \  At\n   the present time, the DNSEXT working is considering the following\n\
    \   question: Is there a need to authentically deny existence of data, if\n  \
    \ so, which is better, NXT (being incumbent) or NO?\n   Another less defined issue\
    \ is the mechanism for parent validation of\n   children signatures.  Although\
    \ the protocol elements of this are\n   becoming settled, the operational considerations\
    \ are not, as\n   evidenced by work mentioned in section 2.  DNSSEC interactions\
    \ have\n   also been referenced in discussions over a standard registry-\n   registrar\
    \ protocol.\n"
- title: 5.0 Progressing to Draft Standard
  contents:
  - "5.0 Progressing to Draft Standard\n   The IETF goal for DNSSEC is to progress\
    \ the documents through the\n   standards track [RFC 2026].  Currently, RFC 2535\
    \ is the second\n   iteration at the Proposed standard level.  There is a need\
    \ to cycle\n   through Proposed once more.  Following this, the next goal is Draft.\n\
    \   To pass to the Draft Standard level, two main requirements must be\n   met.\
    \  There must be two or more interoperable implementations.  There\n   must also\
    \ be sufficient successful operational experience.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.2 Operations document(s) via DNSOP\n   DNSOP will continue to be the forum\

  contents:
  - "5.3 Interoperability\n   Demonstrating interoperability of DNSSEC, meaning the\
    \ interaction of\n   two different implementations when performing DNSSEC work,\
    \ poses an\n   issue because, to date, only BIND is seriously being fitted with\n\
    \   DNSSEC.  There are other partial implementations of DNSSEC\n   functionality,\
    \ so the potential for partial interoperability\n   demonstrations may exist.\n\
    \   During the meeting, it was realized that given goals stated, a second\n  \
    \ DNSSEC implementation is needed in 18 months.  Various folks in the\n   room\
    \ mentioned that they would begin see what could be done about\n   this.\n"
