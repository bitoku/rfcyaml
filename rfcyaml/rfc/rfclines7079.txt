The Pseudowire (PW) and Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
The IETF Pseudowire Emulation Edge
to Edge (PWE3) working group has defined many encapsulations of various layer 1 and layer 2 service  specific PDUs and circuit data.
In most of these encapsulations, use of the Pseudowire (PW) Control Word is required.
However, there are several encapsulations for which the Control Word is optional, and this optionality has been seen in practice to possibly introduce interoperability concerns between multiple implementations of those encapsulations.
This survey of the Pseudowire / Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) user community was conducted to determine implementation trends and the possibility of always mandating the Control Word.
Introduction Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge
to Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential to the emulation, to inhibit Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) behavior, and to discriminate Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) from Pseudowire (PW) packets.
However, some encapsulations treat the Control Word as optional.
As a result, implementations of the CW, for encapsulations for which it is optional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model, and service provider network.
Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity Verification (CV) types.
This flexibility has led to reports of interoperability issues within deployed networks and associated documents to attempt to remedy the situation.
The encapsulations and modes for which the Control Word is currently optional are:  Ethernet Tagged Mode [RFC4448]  Ethernet Raw Mode [RFC4448]  Point to Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC4618]
High Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
Frame Relay Port Mode [RFC4618]
[RFC4717] Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
[RFC5085] defines three Control Channel types for MPLS PWs: Type 1, using the PW Control Word; Type 2, using the Router Alert (RA) Label; and Type 3,
(TTL) Expiration (e.g., MPLS PW Label with TTL   1).
While Type 2 (RA Label) is indicated as being "the preferred mode of VCCV operation when the Control Word is not present", RFC 5085 does not indicate a mandatory Control Channel to ensure interoperable implementations.
The closest it comes to mandating a control channel is the requirement to support Type 1 (Control Word) whenever the CW is present.
As such, the three options yield seven implementation permutations (assuming you have to support at least one Control Channel type to provide VCCV).
Due to these permutations, interoperability challenges have been identified by several VCCV users.
In order to assess the best approach to address the observed interoperability issues, the PWE3 working group decided to solicit feedback from the PW and VCCV user community regarding implementation.
This document presents the survey questionnaire and the information returned by those in the user community who participated.
PW/VCCV Survey Overview Per the direction of the PWE3 working group chairs
, a survey was created to sample the nature of implementations of PWs, with specific emphasis on Control Word usage, and VCCV, with emphasis on Control Channel and Control Type usage.
The survey consisted of a series of questions based on direction of the WG chairs and the survey opened to the public on November 4, 2010.
The survey was conducted using the SurveyMonkey tool, http://www.surveymonkey.com.
The survey ran from November 4, 2010 until February 25, 2011 and was repeatedly publicized on the PWE3 email list over that period.
The editors took precautions to ensure the validity of the sample and the data.
Specifically, only responses with recognizable non vendor company affiliated email addresses were accepted.
Unrecognizable or personal email addresses would have been contacted to determine their validity, but none were received.
Only one response was received from each responding company.
If multiple responses from a company had been received, they would have been contacted to determine whether the responses were duplicative or additive.
This, however, did not occur.
The PW/VCCV Implementation Survey requested the following information about user implementations (the lists of implementation choices were taken verbatim from the survey):  Responding Organization.
No provisions were made for anonymous responses, as all responses required a valid email address in order to validate the survey response.
However, the results herein are reported anonymously, except for an alphabetic list of participating organizations in Section 2.2.
Of the various encapsulations (and options therein) known at the time, including the WG document, "Encapsulation Methods for Transport of Fibre Channel" (now [RFC6307]), which were implemented by the respondent.

Approximately how many PWs of each type were deployed.
Respondents could list a number, or for the sake of privacy, could just respond "In Use" instead.
For each encapsulation listed above, the respondent could indicate which Control Channel [RFC5085] was in use.
(See Section 1 for a discussion of these Control Channels.)
The options listed were:  Control Word (Type 1)  Router Alert Label (Type 2)  TTL Expiry (Type 3)
For each encapsulation listed above, the respondent could indicate which Connectivity Verification types [RFC5085] were in use.
The options were:  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
Ping  Label Switched Path (LSP)
Ping  For each encapsulation type for which the Control Word is optional, the respondents could indicate the encapsulation(s) for which Control Word was supported by the equipment vendor, and whether the CW was also in use in the network.
The encapsulations listed were:  Ethernet (Tagged Mode)
PPP  HDLC  Frame Relay (Port Mode)
Finally, a free form entry was provided for the respondent to provide feedback regarding PW and VCCV deployments, VCCV interoperability challenges, or the survey or any other network/ vendor details
There were seventeen responses to the survey that met the validity requirements in Section 1.1.
The responding companies are listed below in Section 2.2.
Summary of Results Prior to this survey
, there was considerable speculation about whether the Control Word could always be mandated, with several proposals to do so.
However, the survey showed that there was considerable deployment of PWs that did not use the CW.
The publication of this survey serves as a reminder of the extent of PWs without the CW in use, and hence a reminder that the CW less modes cannot be deprecated in the near future.
The following companies, listed here alphabetically as received in the survey responses, participated in the PW/VCCV Implementation Survey.
Responses were only solicited from non vendors (users and service providers), and no vendors responded (although if they had, their response would not have been included).
The data provided has been aggregated.
No specific company's response will be detailed herein.

Below are the responses, made anonymous.
The responses are otherwise provided here verbatim.
BFD VCCV Control Channel is not indicated in the survey (may be required for PW redundancy purpose)
Using CV is not required at the moment 3.
COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from multiple vendors.
COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of VCCV Control Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor platforms.
This will provide COMPANY with significant advantages in reduced operational overheads when handling cross domain faults.
Having a uniform VCCV feature implementation in COMPANY multi vendor network leads to:  Reduced operational cost and complexity  Reduced OSS development to coordinate incompatible VCCV implementations.
Increased end end service availability when handing faults.
In addition, currently some of COMPANY deployed VCCV traffic flows (on some vendor platforms) are not guaranteed to follow those of the customer's application traffic (a key operational requirement).
As a result, the response from the circuit ping cannot faithfully reflect the status of the circuit.
This leads to ambiguity regarding the operational status of our networks.
An in band method is highly preferred, with COMPANY having a clear preference for VCCV Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word.
This preference is being pursued with each of COMPANY vendors.
PW VCCV is very useful tool for finding faults in each PW channel.
Without this we can not find fault on a PW channel.
PW VCCV using BFD is another better option.
Interoperability challenges are with Ethernet OAM mechanism.
We are using L2PVPN AToM like to like models ATMoMPLS
This service offered for transporting ATM cells over IP/MPLS core with Edge ATM CE devices including BPX, Ericsson Media Gateway etc.
This is purely a Port mode with cell packing configuration on it to have best performance.
QoS marking is done for getting LLQ treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated ATM packets.
This service offered for transporting 2G/3G traffic from network such as Node B to RNC's over IP/MPLS backbone core network.
QoS marking is done for getting guaranteed bandwidth treatment in the core for these MPLS encapsulated ATM packets.
In addition to basic L2VPN service configuration, these traffic are routed via MPLS TE tunnels with dedicated path and bandwidth defined to avoid bandwidth related congestion.
EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER does not provide options to configure VCCV control channel and its sub options for LDP based L2Circuits.
How can we achieve end to end management and fault detection of PW without VCCV in such cases?
I'm very interested in this work as we continue to experience interop challenges particularly with newer vendors to the space who are only implementing VCCV via control word.
Vendors who have tailed their MPLS OAM set specifically to the cell backhaul space and mandatory CW have been known to fall into this space.

COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from multiple vendors.
COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of VCCV Control Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor platforms.
This will provide COMPANY with significant advantages in reduced operational overheads when handling cross domain faults.
Having a uniform VCCV feature implementation in COMPANY multi vendor network leads to:   Reduced operational cost and complexity   Reduced OSS development to coordinate incompatible VCCV implementations.
Increased end end service availability when handing faults.
In addition, currently some of COMPANY deployed VCCV traffic flows (on some vendor platforms) are not guaranteed to follow those of the customer's application traffic (a key operational requirement).
As a result, the response from the circuit ping cannot faithfully reflect the status of the circuit.
This leads to ambiguity regarding the operational status of our networks.
An in band method is highly preferred, with COMPANY having a clear preference for VCCV Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word.
This preference is being pursued with each of COMPANY vendors.
