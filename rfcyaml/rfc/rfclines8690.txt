Abstract RFC 8287 defines the extensions to perform LSP Ping and Traceroute for Segment Routing IGP Prefix and IGP Adjacency Segment Identifiers (SIDs) with the MPLS data plane.
RFC 8287 proposes three Target Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Stack sub TLVs.
While RFC 8287 defines the format and procedure to handle those sub TLVs, it does not sufficiently clarify how the length of the Segment ID sub TLVs should be computed to be included in the Length field of the sub  TLVs.
This ambiguity has resulted in interoperability issues.
This document updates RFC 8287 by clarifying the length of each of the Segment ID sub TLVs defined in RFC 8287.
Introduction [RFC8287] defines the extensions to MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute for Segment Routing IGP Prefix and IGP Adjacency Segment Identifiers (SIDs) with the MPLS data plane.
[RFC8287] proposes three Target FEC Stack sub TLVs.
While RFC 8287 defines the format and procedure to handle those sub TLVs, it does not sufficiently clarify how the length of the Segment ID sub TLVs should be computed to be included in the Length field of the sub TLVs, which may result in interoperability issues.
This document updates [RFC8287] by clarifying the length of each Segment ID sub TLVs defined in [RFC8287].
This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC8402], [RFC8029], and [RFC8287]; readers are expected to be familiar with the terms as used in those documents.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
Length Field Clarification for Segment ID Sub TLVs Section 5 of [RFC8287] defines three different Segment ID sub TLVs that can be included in the Target
FEC Stack TLV defined in [RFC8029].
The length of each sub TLV MUST be calculated as defined in this section.
The TLV representations defined in Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 of [RFC8287] are updated to clarify the length calculations, as shown in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, respectively.
The updated TLV representations contain explicitly defined lengths.
IGP Prefix Segment ID Sub TLV
The sub TLV length for the IPv4 IGP Prefix Segment ID MUST be set to 8, as shown in the TLV format below:
The sub TLV length for the IPv6 IGP Prefix Segment ID MUST be set to 20, as shown in the TLV format below:
IGP Adjacency Segment ID Sub TLV
The sub TLV length for the IGP Adjacency Segment ID varies depending on the Adjacency Type and Protocol.
In any of the allowed combinations of Adjacency Type and Protocol, the sub TLV length MUST be calculated by including 2 octets of the Reserved field.
Table 1 lists the length for different combinations of Adj.
IGP Adjacency SID Length Computation
For example, when the Adj.
Type is set to Parallel Adjacency and the Protocol is set to 0, the sub TLV will be as below:
IANA Considerations IANA has listed this document as an additional reference for the following entries in the "Sub TLVs for TLV Types 1, 16, and 21" registry:
Sub TLVs for TLV Types 1, 16, and 21 (Updated Entries) 6.
This document updates [RFC8287] and does not introduce any additional security considerations.
