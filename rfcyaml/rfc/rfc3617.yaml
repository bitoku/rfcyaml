  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a very simple TRIVIAL\n\
    \   protocol that has been in use on the Internet for quite a long time.\n   While\
    \ this document discourages its continued use, largely due to\n   security concerns,\
    \ we do define a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n   scheme, as well as discuss\
    \ the protocol's applicability.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) has been around\
    \ for quite\n   some time.  Its common uses are to initially configure devices\
    \ or to\n   load new versions of operating system code [1].  As devices begin\
    \ to\n   adopt use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and Uniform Resource\n\
    \   Locators (URLs), for completeness we specify a way to reference files\n  \
    \ that is still quite common.  Use of a URI is a convenient way to\n   indicate\
    \ underlying mechanism, server name or address, and file name.\n   WHILE WE DEFINE\
    \ THE TFTP URI TYPE, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THE\n   CONTINUED USE OF TFTP,\
    \ FOR REASONS LISTED IN SECTION 5 (amongst\n   others).  The definition of a URI\
    \ merely allows tools that currently\n   use protocols such as TFTP to have a\
    \ standard name space and\n   structure where one can understand the process used\
    \ to resolve that\n   name.  Indeed it is hoped that the definition of this URI\
    \ will ease\n   transition to modern file transfer mechanisms.\n"
- title: 2.  Syntax of a TFTP URI
  contents:
  - "2.  Syntax of a TFTP URI\n   A TFTP URI has the following ABNF syntax [2]:\n\
    \   tftpURI         = \"tftp://\" host \"/\" file [ mode ]\n   mode          \
    \  = \";\"  \"mode=\" ( \"netascii\" / \"octet\" )\n   file            = *( unreserved\
    \ / escaped )\n   host            = <as specified by RFC 2732 [3]>\n   unreserved\
    \      = <as specified in RFC 2396 [4]>\n   escaped         = <as specified in\
    \ RFC 2396>\n   A TFTP URI specifies a file that is to be found or placed on a\
    \ TFTP\n   server.  The \"mode\" option is an option indicating how the file is\
    \ to\n   be transferred.  If left unspecified, the mode is assumed to be\n   \"\
    octet\".  A third \"mail\" mode was deprecated at the time RFC 1350 was\n   adopted,\
    \ and is not specified.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Encoding Rules
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Encoding Rules\n   Aside from syntax as described above, the TFTP protocol\
    \ does not\n   specify length limits to either file names or file sizes.  In the\n\
    \   case of file names, they may contain any character so long as those\n   characters\
    \ are properly escaped as described above.\n"
- title: 3.  Semantics and Operations
  contents:
  - "3.  Semantics and Operations\n   As previously stated the TFTP URI is a reference\
    \ to a file.  The\n   allowed operations on a TFTP URI are read and write.  When\
    \ a TFTP URI\n   is read the underlying mechanisms retrieve the named file via\
    \ the\n   TFTP protocol from the specified host with the optionally specified\n\
    \   mode.  When a TFTP URI is written the underlying mechanisms transmit\n   a\
    \ file via TFTP to a specified server to either the specified file\n   using the\
    \ optionally specified mode.  No other operations are\n   supported.\n   Note\
    \ that it is not possible to retrieve file size information prior\n   to retrieval,\
    \ nor is it possible to determine file existence or\n   permissions prior to transfer.\
    \  Files transferred may or may not\n   arrive intact, as there is no guarantee\
    \ of reliability or even\n   completeness.  See the TFTP standard for more details.\
    \  For more\n   robust file transfer, consider using either FTP or HTTP [5, 6].\n"
- title: 4. Examples
  contents:
  - "4. Examples\n      tftp://example.com/myconfigurationfile;mode=netascii\n   This\
    \ example references file \"myconfigurationfile\" on server\n   \"example.com\"\
    \ and requests that the transfer occur in netascii mode.\n      tftp://example.com/mystartupfile\n\
    \   This file references file \"mystartupfile\" on server \"example.com\".\n \
    \  The transfer should occur in octet mode, since no other mode was\n   specified.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations and Concerns about TFTP's use
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations and Concerns about TFTP's use\n   Use of TFTP has\
    \ been historically limited to those devices where a\n   more full protocol stack\
    \ is impractical due to either memory or CPU\n   constraints.  While this still\
    \ may be the case with a toaster, it is\n   unlikely to be the case for even the\
    \ simplest piece of network\n   support hardware, such as simple routers or switches.\
    \  There are a\n   myriad of reasons to use some protocol other than TFTP, only\
    \ a few of\n   which are listed below.\n   TFTP has no mechanism for access control\
    \ within the protocol, and\n   there is no protection from a man in the middle\
    \ attack.\n   Implementations are left to their own devices in this area.  Because\n\
    \   TFTP has no way to determine file sizes in advance, implementations\n   should\
    \ be prepared to properly check the bounds of transfers so that\n   neither memory\
    \ nor disk limitations are exceeded.\n   TFTP is not well suited to large files\
    \ for the following reasons.\n   TFTP has no inherent integrity check.  There\
    \ is no way to determine\n   what one side sent is what the other received.  There\
    \ is no way to\n   restart TFTP transfers from anywhere other than the beginning.\
    \  TFTP\n   is a lock step protocol.  Only one packet may be in flight at any\
    \ one\n   time.  There is no slow start or smart backoff mechanism in TFTP, but\n\
    \   very simple timeouts.\n   TFTP is not well suited to file transfers across\
    \ administrative\n   domains.  For one thing, TFTP utilizes UDP, and many NATs\
    \ will not\n   either support or allow TFTP transfers.  More likely firewalls\
    \ will\n   prohibit transfers.\n   There are no caching semantics within TFTP.\
    \  There is no safe way to\n   cache information using the TFTP protocol.\n  \
    \ In summary, use of TFTP is strongly discouraged except in the most\n   limited\
    \ of circumstances where memory and CPU are at the highest\n   premium.\n"
