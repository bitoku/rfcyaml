- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   With the deployment of IPv6 [1], several Internet Service\
    \ Providers\n   are ready to offer IPv6 access to the public.  In conjunction\
    \ with\n   widely deployed \"always on\" media such as ADSL and the expectation\n\
    \   that customers will be assigned a /48 IPv6 unicast address prefix\n   (see\
    \ RFC 3513 [3] and section 3 of RFC 3177 [2]), an efficient\n   mechanism for\
    \ delegating address prefixes to the customer's sites is\n   needed.  The delegation\
    \ mechanism will be intended to automate the\n   process of informing the customer's\
    \ networking equipment of the\n   prefixes to be used at the customer's site.\n\
    \   This document clarifies the requirements for IPv6 address prefix\n   delegation\
    \ from the ISP to the site.\n"

    \ for the\n   organization of a network providing subscription IPv6 service:\n\

- title: 3.  Requirements for Prefix Delegation
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements for Prefix Delegation\n   The purpose of the prefix delegation\
    \ mechanism is to delegate and\n   manage prefixes to the CPE automatically.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Number and Length of Delegated Prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Number and Length of Delegated Prefixes\n   The prefix delegation mechanism\
    \ should allow for delegation of\n   prefixes of lengths between /48 and /64,\
    \ inclusively.  Other lengths\n   should also be supported.  The mechanism should\
    \ allow for delegation\n   of more than one prefix to the customer.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Use of Delegated Prefixes in Customer Network
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Use of Delegated Prefixes in Customer Network\n   The prefix delegation\
    \ mechanism must not prohibit or inhibit the\n   assignment of longer prefixes,\
    \ created from the delegated prefixes,\n   to links within the customer network.\
    \  The prefix delegation\n   mechanism is not required to report any prefix delegations\
    \ within the\n   customer's network back to the ISP.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Static and Dynamic Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Static and Dynamic Assignment\n   The prefix delegation mechanism should\
    \ allow for long-lived static\n   pre-assignment of prefixes and for automated,\
    \ possibly short-lived,\n   on-demand, dynamic assignment of prefixes to a customer.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Policy-based Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Policy-based Assignment\n   The prefix delegation mechanism should allow\
    \ for the use of policy in\n   assigning prefixes to a customer.  For example,\
    \ the customer's\n   identity and type of subscribed service may be used to determine\
    \ the\n   address block from which the customer's prefix is selected, and the\n\
    \   length of the prefix assigned to the customer.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Expression of Requirements or Preferences by the CPE
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Expression of Requirements or Preferences by the CPE\n   The CPE must be\
    \ able to express requirements or preferences in its\n   request to the PE.  For\
    \ example, the CPE should be able to express a\n   preference for a prefix length.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Security and Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Security and Authentication\n   The prefix delegation mechanism must provide\
    \ for reliable\n   authentication of the identity of the customer to which the\
    \ prefixes\n   are to be assigned, and must provide for reliable, secure\n   transmission\
    \ of the delegated prefixes to the customer.\n   The prefix delegation should\
    \ provide for reliable authentication of\n   the identity of the service provider's\
    \ edge router.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Accounting
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Accounting\n   The prefix delegation mechanism must allow for the ISP to\
    \ obtain\n   accounting information about delegated prefixes from the PE.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Hardware technology Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Hardware technology Considerations\n   The prefix delegation mechanism\
    \ should work on any hardware link\n   technology between the PE and the CPE and\
    \ should be hardware\n   technology independent.  The mechanism must work on shared\
    \ links.\n   The mechanism should work with all hardware technologies with either\n\
    \   an authentication mechanism or without, but ISPs would like to take\n   advantage\
    \ of the hardware technology's authentication mechanism if it\n   exists.\n"
- title: 4.  Security considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security considerations\n   Section 3.6 specifies security requirements for\
    \ the prefix delegation\n   mechanism.  For point to point links, where one trusts\
    \ that there is\n   no man in the middle, or one trusts layer two authentication,\n\
    \   authentication may not be necessary.\n   A rogue PE can issue bogus prefixes\
    \ to a requesting router.  This may\n   cause denial of service due to unreachability.\n\
    \   A rogue CPE may be able to mount a denial of service attack by\n   repeated\
    \ requests for delegated prefixes that exhaust the PE's\n   available prefixes.\n"
