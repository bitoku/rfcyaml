  - "15-Jul-76 Nancy Mimno (BBN-NET)\n   Jon,\n   I've read RFC718 and have got some\
    \ comments, in particular with\n   respect to the \"third problem\" or clearing\
    \ the input buffer part.\n   1) I believe the stated implementation is backwards:\
    \ in the normal\n   case of the RCTE mode negotiation, the server sends \"WILL\
    \ RCTE\" and\n   the user sends ,\"DO RCTE\"; the reverse case is thus the server\
    \ sending\n   \"DO RCTE\" and the user \"WILL RCTE\" Also, it is probably wise\
    \ to say\n   explicitly that the server's sending \"DO RCTE\" requires the user\n\
    \   process to respond \"WILL (or WON'T) RCTE\" and that this response is\n  \
    \ the synchronizing mark.\n   2) The problem is a real one and I think the RCTE\
    \ protocol would be\n   better with a \"clear input, reset counters\" function.\
    \  The question is\n   Ill now to do it.  In talking with Rav yesterday, I learned\
    \ that he had\n   this in mind as a general function, not restricted to RCTE;\
    \ in fact,\n   TENEX sends the \"reverse RCTE\" option for \"clear your input\
    \ buffer\"\n   whether or not the connection is in RCTE mode.  In this case, the\n\
    \   statement about \"cannot be confused with the normal use of the RCTE\n   option\"\
    \ will not always be true.  I think we both agreed that the\n   current solution\
    \ should just be an interim one.\n   3) I suggest a different way of performing\
    \ this function, using the\n   synch-datamark sequence.  First, the RCTE option\
    \ would have to\n   explicitly require that this function reset the counters and\
    \ cause a\n   \"clear your input buffer (of data)\", all synchronized with the\n\
    \   datamark of course.  This is pretty much what it is now except for\n   the\
    \ reset counters; receiving Synch-data mark when in RCTE probably\n   needed defining\
    \ anyhow.  Because RCTE won't work unless both sides\n   agree, the \"clear input\
    \ and reset counters\" meaning for\n   synch-data mark would have to be a mandatory\
    \ part of the RCTE option.\n   Second, since the Synch-data mark is a \"one-way\"\
    \ function, there needs\n   to be a way for one side of the connection to tell\
    \ the other side to\n   \"send me a Synch-data mark\".  The New Telnet protocol\
    \ spec implied that\n   Abort Output could be used for that purpose; if hot, then\
    \ perhaps a\n   new function could be defined.  Again, the RCTE option should\
    \ make\n   some explicit statement requiring (or very strongLy recommending)\n\
    \   this interpretation of AO.  For non-RCTE mode, it's a nice idea but\n   probably\
    \ not required.  Ray has tentatively agreed- thinks it could\n   work on Tenex\
    \ (server side).   I would like your comments and Doug\n   Dodds' (Tenex user\
    \ RCTE).  I don't know of any other existing RCTE\n   implementations that would\
    \ have to change.  I also don't know what it\n   takes to extend official protocols\
    \ these days, but maybe it's easier\n   to do that than define a new option (ie\
    \ reverse RCTE).\n   Regards,\n   Nancy\n"

  - "15-Jul-76 Doug Dodds (BBN-RCC)\n   Nancy,\n   Your suggestion for the RCTE-clear\
    \ function being performed by the Au\n   command (when RCTE is on) is a good one.\
    \  I see no problem with it\n   from the side of the Tenex User Telnet (NTELNET).\
    \  At present NTELNET\n   is ignoring AO (and some other commands) entirely; this\
    \ is a good\n   opportunity to implement it in general.\n   Doug\n"

  - "21-Jul-76 Jon Postel (SRI-ARC)\n   I met with Ray Tomlinson for a few minutes\
    \ to discuss the RCTE-clear\n   function and other RCTE features.  We agreed that\
    \ Nancy's suggestion\n   for using the AO command for the clear function made\
    \ sense.  We also\n   determined that the RCTE document should say something about\
    \ the\n   state some other options should be in when using RCTE.  For example\
    \ we\n   believe that GO-AHEAD must be suppressed while RCTE is in use, that\n\
    \   when one quits RCTE the ECHO mode must be restored to what it was at\n   the\
    \ time of entering RCTE,, and that BINARY and RCTE do not make sense\n   as a\
    \ combination because every byte would have to be assumed to be a\n   break character.\
    \  We also determined that it is unworkable to use\n   RCTE and no break characters\
    \ since there is no way to get out of that\n   state.\n"

    \ as an\n   RFC.\n"
