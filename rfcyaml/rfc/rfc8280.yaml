- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"There's a freedom about the Internet: As long as we accept\
    \ the rules\n   of sending packets around, we can send packets containing anything\
    \ to\n   anywhere.\"  [Berners-Lee]\n   \"The Internet isn't value-neutral, and\
    \ neither is the IETF.\"\n   [RFC3935]\n   The ever-growing interconnectedness\
    \ of the Internet and society\n   increases the impact of the Internet on the\
    \ lives of individuals.\n   Because of this, the design and development of the\
    \ Internet\n   infrastructure also have a growing impact on society.  This has\
    \ led\n   to a broad recognition that human rights [UDHR] [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have\n\
    \   a role in the development and management of the Internet [UNGA2013]\n   [NETmundial].\
    \  It has also been argued that the Internet should be\n   strengthened as an\
    \ enabling environment for human rights [Brown].\n   This document aims to (1)\
    \ expose the relationship between protocols\n   and human rights, (2) propose\
    \ possible guidelines to protect the\n   Internet as an enabling environment for\
    \ human rights in future\n   protocol development, in a manner similar to the\
    \ work done for\n   privacy considerations [RFC6973], and (3) increase the awareness,\
    \ in\n   both the human rights community and the technical community, of the\n\
    \   importance of the technical workings of the Internet and its impact\n   on\
    \ human rights.\n   Document authors who want to apply this work to their own\
    \ can go\n   directly to Section 6 of this document.\n   Open, secure, and reliable\
    \ connectivity is necessary (although not\n   sufficient) to exercise human rights\
    \ such as freedom of expression\n   and freedom of association [FOC], as defined\
    \ in the Universal\n   Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR].  The purpose of the\
    \ Internet is\n   to be a global network of networks that provides unfettered\n\
    \   connectivity to all users, and for any content [RFC1958].  This\n   objective\
    \ of stimulating global connectivity contributes to the\n   Internet's role as\
    \ an enabler of human rights.  The Internet has\n   given people a platform to\
    \ exchange opinions and gather information;\n   it has enabled people of different\
    \ backgrounds and genders to\n   participate in the public debate; it has also\
    \ allowed people to\n   congregate and organize.  Next to that, the strong commitment\
    \ to\n   security [RFC1984] [RFC3365] and privacy [RFC6973] [RFC7258] in the\n\
    \   Internet's architectural design contributes to the strengthening of\n   the\
    \ Internet as an enabling environment for human rights.  One could\n   even argue\
    \ that the Internet is not only an enabler of human rights\n   but that human\
    \ rights lie at the base of, and are ingrained in, the\n   architecture of the\
    \ networks that make up the Internet.  Internet\n   connectivity increases the\
    \ capacity for individuals to exercise their\n   rights; the core of the Internet\
    \ -- its architectural design -- is\n   therefore closely intertwined with the\
    \ human rights framework\n   [CathFloridi].  The quintessential link between the\
    \ Internet's\n   infrastructure and human rights has been argued by many.  [Bless1],\n\
    \   for instance, argues that \"to a certain extent, the Internet and its\n  \
    \ protocols have already facilitated the realization of human rights,\n   e.g.,\
    \ the freedom of assembly and expression.  In contrast, measures\n   of censorship\
    \ and pervasive surveillance violate fundamental human\n   rights.\"  [DeNardis15]\
    \ argues that \"Since the first hints of Internet\n   commercialization and internationalization,\
    \ the IETF has supported\n   strong security in protocol design and has sometimes\
    \ served as a\n   force resisting protocol-enabled surveillance features.\"  By\
    \ doing\n   so, the IETF enabled the manifestation of the right to privacy,\n\
    \   through the Internet's infrastructure.  Additionally, access to\n   freely\
    \ available information gives people access to knowledge that\n   enables them\
    \ to help satisfy other human rights; as such, the\n   Internet increasingly becomes\
    \ a precondition for human rights rather\n   than a supplement.\n   Human rights\
    \ can be in conflict with each other, such as the right to\n   freedom of expression\
    \ and the right to privacy.  In such cases, the\n   different affected rights\
    \ need to be balanced.  To do this, it is\n   crucial that the impacts on rights\
    \ are clearly documented in order to\n   mitigate potential harm.  This research\
    \ aims to ultimately contribute\n   to making that process tangible and practical\
    \ for protocol\n   developers.  Technology can never be fully equated with a human\n\
    \   right.  Whereas a specific technology might be a strong enabler of a\n   specific\
    \ human right, it might have an adverse impact on another\n   human right.  In\
    \ this case, decisions on design and deployment need\n   to take this into account.\n\
    \   The open nature of the initial technical design and its open\n   standards,\
    \ as well as developments like open source, fostered freedom\n   of communication.\
    \  What emerged was a network of networks that could\n   enable everyone to connect\
    \ and to exchange data, information, and\n   code.  For many, enabling such connections\
    \ became a core value.\n   However, as the scale and the commercialization of\
    \ the Internet grew,\n   topics like access, rights, and connectivity have been\
    \ forced to\n   compete with other values.  Therefore, important characteristics\
    \ of\n   the Internet that enable human rights might be degraded if they're\n\
    \   not properly defined, described, and protected as such.  Conversely,\n   not\
    \ protecting characteristics that enable human rights could also\n   result in\
    \ (partial) loss of functionality and connectivity, along\n   with other inherent\
    \ parts of the Internet's architecture of networks.\n   New protocols, particularly\
    \ those that upgrade the core\n   infrastructure of the network, should be designed\
    \ to continue to\n   enable fundamental human rights.\n   The IETF has produced\
    \ guidelines and procedures to ensure and\n   galvanize the privacy of individuals\
    \ and security of the network in\n   protocol development.  This document aims\
    \ to explore the possibility\n   of developing similar procedures for guidelines\
    \ for human rights\n   considerations to ensure that protocols developed in the\
    \ IETF do not\n   have an adverse impact on the realization of human rights on\
    \ the\n   Internet.  By carefully considering the answers to the questions\n \
    \  posed in Section 6 of this document, document authors should be\n   (1) able\
    \ to produce a comprehensive analysis that can serve as the\n   basis for discussion\
    \ on whether the protocol adequately protects\n   against specific human rights\
    \ threats and (2) potentially stimulated\n   to think about alternative design\
    \ choices.\n   This document was developed within the framework of the Human Rights\n\
    \   Protocol Considerations (HRPC) Research Group, based on discussions\n   on\
    \ the HRPC mailing list (Section 9); this document was also\n   extensively discussed\
    \ during HRPC sessions.  This document has\n   received eleven in-depth reviews\
    \ on the mailing list, and it received\n   many comments from inside and outside\
    \ the IRTF and IETF communities.\n"
- title: 2.  Vocabulary Used
  contents:
  - "2.  Vocabulary Used\n   In the discussion of human rights and Internet architecture,\
    \ concepts\n   developed in computer science, networking, law, policy-making,\
    \ and\n   advocacy are coming together [Dutton] [Kaye] [Franklin] [RFC1958].\n\
    \   The same concepts might have a very different meaning and\n   implications\
    \ in other areas of expertise.  In order to foster a\n   constructive interdisciplinary\
    \ debate and minimize differences in\n   interpretation, the following glossary\
    \ is provided.  It builds as\n   much as possible on existing definitions; when\
    \ definitions were not\n   available in IETF documents, definitions were taken\
    \ from other\n   Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or academic literature.\n\
    \   Accessibility:  \"Full Internet Connectivity\", as described in\n      [RFC4084],\
    \ to provide unfettered access to the Internet.\n      The design of protocols,\
    \ services, or implementations that provide\n      an enabling environment for\
    \ people with disabilities.\n      The ability to receive information available\
    \ on the Internet.\n   Anonymity:  The condition of an identity being unknown\
    \ or concealed\n      [RFC4949].\n   Anonymous:  A state of an individual in which\
    \ an observer or attacker\n      cannot identify the individual within a set of\
    \ other individuals\n      (the anonymity set) [RFC6973].\n   Authenticity:  The\
    \ property of being genuine and able to be verified\n      and be trusted [RFC4949].\n\
    \   Blocking:  The practice of preventing access to resources in the\n      aggregate\
    \ [RFC7754].  Both blocking and filtering can be\n      implemented at the level\
    \ of \"services\" (web hosting or video\n      streaming, for example) or at the\
    \ level of particular \"content\"\n      [RFC7754].\n   Censorship:  Technical\
    \ mechanisms, including both blocking and\n      filtering, that certain political\
    \ or private actors around the\n      world use to block or degrade Internet traffic.\
    \  For further\n      details on the various elements of Internet censorship,\
    \ see\n      [Hall].\n   Censorship resistance:  Methods and measures to mitigate\
    \ Internet\n      censorship.\n   Confidentiality:  The property that data is\
    \ not disclosed to system\n      entities unless they have been authorized to\
    \ know the data\n      [RFC4949].\n   Connectivity:  The extent to which a device\
    \ or network is able to\n      reach other devices or networks to exchange data.\
    \  The Internet is\n      the tool for providing global connectivity [RFC1958].\
    \  Different\n      types of connectivity are further specified in [RFC4084].\n\
    \      The end-to-end principle, interoperability, distributed\n      architecture,\
    \ resilience, reliability, and robustness in\n      combination constitute the\
    \ enabling factors that result in\n      connectivity to, and on, the Internet.\n\
    \   Content agnosticism:  Treating network traffic identically regardless\n  \
    \    of content.\n   Decentralized:  Implementation or deployment of standards,\
    \ protocols,\n      or systems without one single point of control.\n   End-to-end\
    \ principle:  The principle that application-specific\n      functions should\
    \ not be embedded into the network and thus stay at\n      the endpoints.  In\
    \ many cases, especially when dealing with\n      failures, the right decisions\
    \ can only be made with the\n      corresponding application-specific knowledge,\
    \ which is available\n      at endpoints not in the network.\n      The end-to-end\
    \ principle is one of the key architectural\n      guidelines of the Internet.\
    \  The argument in favor of the\n      end-to-end approach to system design is\
    \ laid out in the\n      fundamental papers by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark [Saltzer]\
    \ [Clark].\n      In these papers, the authors argue in favor of radical\n   \
    \   simplification: system designers should only build the essential\n      and\
    \ shared functions into the network, as most functions can only\n      be implemented\
    \ at network endpoints.  Building features into the\n      network for the benefit\
    \ of certain applications will come at the\n      expense of others.  As such,\
    \ in general system designers should\n      attempt to steer clear of building\
    \ anything into the network that\n      is not a bare necessity for its functioning.\
    \  Following the\n      end-to-end principle is crucial for innovation, as it\
    \ makes\n      innovation at the edges possible without having to make changes\
    \ to\n      the network, and it protects the robustness of the network.\n    \
    \  [RFC2775] further elaborates on various aspects of end-to-end\n      connectivity.\n\
    \   Federation:  The possibility of connecting autonomous and possibly\n     \
    \ centralized systems into a single system without a central\n      authority.\n\
    \   Filtering:  The practice of preventing access to specific resources\n    \
    \  within an aggregate [RFC7754].\n   Heterogeneity:  \"The Internet is characterized\
    \ by heterogeneity on\n      many levels: devices and nodes, router scheduling\
    \ algorithms and\n      queue management mechanisms, routing protocols, levels\
    \ of\n      multiplexing, protocol versions and implementations, underlying\n\
    \      link layers (e.g., point-to-point, multi-access links, wireless,\n    \
    \  FDDI, etc.), in the traffic mix and in the levels of congestion at\n      different\
    \ times and places.  Moreover, as the Internet is composed\n      of autonomous\
    \ organizations and internet service providers, each\n      with their own separate\
    \ policy concerns, there is a large\n      heterogeneity of administrative domains\
    \ and pricing structures.\"\n      [FIArch]\n      As a result, per [FIArch],\
    \ the heterogeneity principle proposed in\n      [RFC1958] needs to be supported\
    \ by design.\n   Human rights:  Principles and norms that are indivisible,\n \
    \     interrelated, unalienable, universal, and mutually reinforcing.\n      Human\
    \ rights have been codified in national and international\n      bodies of law.\
    \  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR]\n      is the most well-known\
    \ document in the history of human rights.\n      The aspirations from [UDHR]\
    \ were later codified into treaties such\n      as the International Covenant\
    \ on Civil and Political Rights\n      [ICCPR] and the International Covenant\
    \ on Economic, Social and\n      Cultural Rights [ICESCR], after which signatory\
    \ countries were\n      obliged to reflect them in their national bodies of law.\
    \  There is\n      also a broad recognition that not only states have obligations\n\
    \      vis-a-vis human rights, but non-state actors do as well.\n   Integrity:\
    \  The property that data has not been changed, destroyed,\n      or lost in an\
    \ unauthorized or accidental manner [RFC4949].\n   Internationalization (i18n):\
    \  The practice of making protocols,\n      standards, and implementations usable\
    \ in different languages and\n      scripts (see Section 6.2.12 (\"Localization\"\
    )).\n      \"In the IETF, 'internationalization' means to add or improve the\n\
    \      handling of non-ASCII text in a protocol\" [RFC6365].\n      A different\
    \ perspective, more appropriate to protocols that are\n      designed for global\
    \ use from the beginning, is the definition used\n      by the World Wide Web\
    \ Consortium (W3C) [W3Ci18nDef]:\n      \"Internationalization is the design and\
    \ development of a product,\n      application or document content that enables\
    \ easy localization for\n      target audiences that vary in culture, region,\
    \ or language.\"\n      Many protocols that handle text only handle one charset\n\
    \      (US-ASCII), or they leave the question of encoding up to local\n      guesswork\
    \ (which leads, of course, to interoperability problems)\n      [RFC3536].  If\
    \ multiple charsets are permitted, they must be\n      explicitly identified [RFC2277].\
    \  Adding non-ASCII text to a\n      protocol allows the protocol to handle more\
    \ scripts, hopefully all\n      scripts in use in the world.  In today's world,\
    \ that is normally\n      best accomplished by allowing Unicode encoded in UTF-8\
    \ only,\n      thereby shifting conversion issues away from ad hoc choices.\n\
    \   Interoperable:  A property of a documented standard or protocol that\n   \
    \   allows different independent implementations to work with each\n      other\
    \ without any restriction on functionality.\n   Localization (l10n):  The practice\
    \ of translating an implementation\n      to make it functional in a specific\
    \ language or for users in a\n      specific locale (see Section 6.2.5 (\"Internationalization\"\
    )).\n      (cf. [RFC6365]): The process of adapting an internationalized\n   \
    \   application platform or application to a specific cultural\n      environment.\
    \  In localization, the same semantics are preserved\n      while the syntax may\
    \ be changed [FRAMEWORK].\n      Localization is the act of tailoring an application\
    \ for a\n      different language, script, or culture.  Some internationalized\n\
    \      applications can handle a wide variety of languages.  Typical\n      users\
    \ only understand a small number of languages, so the program\n      must be tailored\
    \ to interact with users in just the languages they\n      know.  The major work\
    \ of localization is translating the user\n      interface and documentation.\
    \  Localization involves not only\n      changing the language interaction but\
    \ also other relevant changes,\n      such as display of numbers, dates, currency,\
    \ and so on.  The\n      better internationalized an application is, the easier\
    \ it is to\n      localize it for a particular language and character-encoding\n\
    \      scheme.\n   Open standards:  Conform with [RFC2026], which states the following:\n\
    \      \"Various national and international standards bodies, such as\n      ANSI,\
    \ ISO, IEEE, and ITU-T, develop a variety of protocol and\n      service specifications\
    \ that are similar to Technical\n      Specifications defined here.  National\
    \ and international groups\n      also publish 'implementors' agreements' that\
    \ are analogous to\n      Applicability Statements, capturing a body of implementation-\n\
    \      specific detail concerned with the practical application of their\n   \
    \   standards.  All of these are considered to be 'open external\n      standards'\
    \ for the purposes of the Internet Standards Process.\"\n   Openness:  Absence\
    \ of centralized points of control -- \"a feature\n      that is assumed to make\

    \  It is often summarized as \"the right to\n      be left alone\", but it encompasses\

    \ and home life,\n      control of sexual and reproductive rights, and communications\n\
    \      secrecy.  It is commonly recognized as a core right that underpins\n  \
    \    human dignity and other values such as freedom of association and\n     \
    \ freedom of speech.\n      The right to privacy is also recognized in nearly\
    \ every national\n      constitution and in most international human rights treaties.\
    \  It\n      has been adjudicated upon by both international and regional\n  \

- title: 4.  Literature and Discussion Review
  contents:
  - "4.  Literature and Discussion Review\n   Protocols and standards are regularly\
    \ seen as merely performing\n   technical functions.  However, these protocols\
    \ and standards do not\n   exist outside of their technical context, nor do they\
    \ exist outside\n   of their political, historical, economic, legal, or cultural\
    \ context.\n   This is best exemplified by the way in which some Internet processes\n\
    \   and protocols have become part and parcel of political processes and\n   public\
    \ policies: one only has to look at the IANA transition,\n   [RFC7258] (\"Pervasive\
    \ Monitoring Is an Attack\"), or global innovation\n   policy, for concrete examples\
    \ [DeNardis15].  According to [Abbate],\n   \"protocols are politics by other\
    \ means.\"  This statement would\n   probably not garner IETF consensus, but it\
    \ nonetheless reveals that\n   protocols are based on decision-making, most often\
    \ by humans.  In\n   this process, the values and ideas about the role that a\
    \ particular\n   technology should perform in society are embedded into the design.\n\
    \   Often, these design decisions are partly \"purely technical\" and\n   partly\
    \ inspired by a certain world view of how technology should\n   function that\
    \ is inspired by personal, corporate, and political\n   views.  Within the community\
    \ of IETF participants, there is a strong\n   desire to solve technical problems\
    \ and to minimize engagement with\n   political processes and non-protocol-related\
    \ political issues.\n   Since the late 1990s, a burgeoning group of academics\
    \ and\n   practitioners researched questions surrounding the societal impact of\n\
    \   protocols, as well as the politics of protocols.  These studies vary\n   in\
    \ focus and scope: some focus on specific standards [Davidson-etal]\n   [Musiani];\
    \ others look into the political, legal, commercial, or\n   social impact of protocols\
    \ [BrownMarsden] [Lessig] [Mueller]; and yet\n   others look at how the engineers'\
    \ personal set of values get\n   translated into technology [Abbate] [CathFloridi]\
    \ [DeNardis15]\n   [WynsbergheMoura].\n   Commercial and political influences\
    \ on the management of the\n   Internet's infrastructure are well documented in\
    \ the academic\n   literature and will thus not be discussed here; see [Benkler],\n\
    \   [Brown-etal], [DeNardis15], [Lessig], [Mueller], and [Zittrain].  It\n   is\
    \ sufficient to say that the IETF community consistently tries to\n   push back\
    \ against the standardization of surveillance and certain\n   other issues that\
    \ negatively influence an end user's experience of,\n   and trust in, the Internet\
    \ [DeNardis14].  The role that human rights\n   play in engineering, infrastructure\
    \ maintenance, and protocol design\n   is much less clear.\n   It is very important\
    \ to understand how protocols and standards impact\n   human rights, in particular\
    \ because SDOs are increasingly becoming\n   venues where social values (like\
    \ human rights) are discussed,\n   although often from a technological point of\
    \ view.  These SDOs are\n   becoming a new focal point for discussions about \"\
    values by design\"\n   and the role of technical engineers in protecting or enabling\
    \ human\n   rights [Brown-etal] [Clark-etal] [DeNardis14] [CathFloridi] [Lessig]\n\
    \   [Rachovitsa].\n   In the academic literature, five clear positions can be\
    \ discerned in\n   relation to the role of human rights in protocol design and\
    \ how to\n   account for these human rights in protocol development: Clark\n \
    \  et al. [Clark-etal] argue that there is a need to design \"for\n   variation\
    \ in outcome -- so that the outcome can be different in\n   different places,\
    \ and the tussle takes place within the design (...)\"\n   [as] \"Rigid designs\
    \ will be broken; designs that permit variation\n   will flex under pressure and\
    \ survive.\"  They hold that human rights\n   should not be hard-coded into protocols\
    \ for three reasons: First, the\n   rights in the UDHR are not absolute.  Second,\
    \ technology is not the\n   only tool in the tussle over human rights.  And last\
    \ but not least,\n   it is dangerous to make promises that can't be kept.  The\
    \ open nature\n   of the Internet will never, they argue, be enough to fully protect\n\
    \   individuals' human rights.\n   Conversely, Brown et al. [Brown-etal] state\
    \ that \"some key, universal\n   values -- of which the UDHR is the most legitimate\
    \ expression --\n   should be baked into the architecture at design time.\"  They\
    \ argue\n   that design choices have offline consequences and are able to shape\n\
    \   the power positions of groups or individuals in society.  As such,\n   the\
    \ individuals making these technical decisions have a moral\n   obligation to\
    \ take into account the impact of their decisions on\n   society and, by extension,\
    \ human rights.  Brown et al. recognize that\n   values and the implementation\
    \ of human rights vary across the globe.\n   Yet they argue that all members of\
    \ the United Nations have found\n   \"common agreement on the values proclaimed\
    \ in the Universal\n   Declaration of Human Rights.  In looking for the most legitimate\
    \ set\n   of global values to embed in the future Internet architectures, the\n\
    \   UDHR has the democratic assent of a significant fraction of the\n   planet's\
    \ population, through their elected representatives.\"\n   The main disagreement\
    \ between these two academic positions lies\n   mostly in the question of whether\
    \ (1) a particular value system\n   should be embedded into the Internet's architectures\
    \ or (2) the\n   architectures need to account for a varying set of values.\n\
    \   A third position, which is similar to that of Brown et al., is taken\n   by\
    \ [Broeders], in which Broeders argues that \"we must find ways to\n   continue\
    \ guaranteeing the overall integrity and functionality of the\n   public core\
    \ of the Internet.\"  He argues that the best way to do this\n   is by declaring\
    \ the backbone of the Internet -- which includes the\n   TCP/IP protocol suite,\
    \ numerous standards, the Domain Name System\n   (DNS), and routing protocols\
    \ -- a common public good.  This is a\n   different approach than those of [Clark-etal]\
    \ and [Brown-etal]\n   because Broeders does not suggest that social values should\
    \ (or\n   should not) be explicitly coded into the Internet, but rather that\n\
    \   the existing infrastructure should be seen as an entity of public\n   value.\n\
    \   Bless and Orwat [Bless2] represent a fourth position.  They argue\n   that\
    \ it is too early to make any definitive claims but that there is\n   a need for\
    \ more careful analysis of the impact of protocol design\n   choices on human\
    \ rights.  They also argue that it is important to\n   search for solutions that\
    \ \"create awareness in the technical\n   community about impact of design choices\
    \ on social values\" and \"work\n   towards a methodology for co-design of technical\
    \ and institutional\n   systems.\"\n   Berners-Lee and Halpin [BernersLeeHalpin]\
    \ represent a fifth position.\n   They argue that the Internet could lead to even\
    \ newer capacities, and\n   these capacities may over time be viewed as new kinds\
    \ of rights.  For\n   example, Internet access may be viewed as a human right\
    \ in and of\n   itself if it is taken to be a precondition for other rights, even\
    \ if\n   it could not have been predicted at the time that the UDHR was\n   written\
    \ (after the end of World War II).\n   It is important to contextualize the technical\
    \ discussion with the\n   academic discussions on this issue.  The academic discussions\
    \ are\n   also important to document, as they inform the position of the\n   authors\
    \ of this document.  The research group's position is that\n   hard-coding human\
    \ rights into protocols is complicated and changes\n   with the context.  At this\
    \ point, it is difficult to say whether or\n   not hard-coding human rights into\
    \ protocols is wise or feasible.\n   Additionally, there are many human rights,\
    \ but not all are relevant\n   for information and communications technologies\
    \ (ICTs).  A partial\n   catalog (with references to sources) of human rights\
    \ related to ICTs\n   can be found in [Hill2014].  It is, however, important to\
    \ make\n   conscious and explicit design decisions that take into account the\n\
    \   human rights protocol considerations guidelines developed below.\n   This\
    \ will contribute to the understanding of the impact that\n   protocols can have\
    \ on human rights, for both developers and users.\n   In addition, it contributes\
    \ to (1) the careful consideration of the\n   impact that a specific protocol\
    \ might have on human rights and\n   (2) the dissemination of the practice of\
    \ documenting protocol design\n   decisions related to human rights.\n   Pursuant\
    \ to the principle of constant change, because the function\n   and scope of the\
    \ Internet evolve, so does the role of the IETF in\n   developing standards. \
    \ Internet Standards are adopted based on a\n   series of criteria, including\
    \ high technical quality, support by\n   community consensus, and their overall\
    \ benefit to the Internet.  The\n   latter calls for an assessment of the interests\
    \ of all affected\n   parties and the specifications' impact on the Internet's\
    \ users.  In\n   this respect, the effective exercise of the human rights of the\n\
    \   Internet users is a relevant consideration that needs to be\n   appreciated\
    \ in the standardization process insofar as it is directly\n   linked to the reliability\
    \ and core values of the Internet [RFC1958]\n   [RFC2775] [RFC3439] [RFC3724].\n\
    \   This document details the steps taken in the research into human\n   rights\
    \ protocol considerations by the HRPC Research Group to clarify\n   the relationship\
    \ between technical concepts used in the IETF and\n   human rights.  This document\
    \ sets out some preliminary steps and\n   considerations for engineers to take\
    \ into account when developing\n   standards and protocols.\n"
- title: 5.  Methodology
  contents:
  - "5.  Methodology\n   Mapping the relationship between human rights, protocols,\
    \ and\n   architectures is a new research challenge that requires a good amount\n\
    \   of interdisciplinary and cross-organizational cooperation to develop\n   a\
    \ consistent methodology.\n   The methodological choices made in this document\
    \ are based on the\n   political-science-based method of discourse analysis and\
    \ ethnographic\n   research methods [Cath].  This work departs from the assumption\
    \ that\n   language reflects the understanding of concepts.  Or, as [Jabri]\n\
    \   holds, policy documents are \"social relations represented in texts\n   where\
    \ the language contained within these texts is used to construct\n   meaning and\
    \ representation.\"  This process happens in society\n   [Denzin] and manifests\
    \ itself in institutions and organizations\n   [King], exposed using the ethnographic\
    \ methods of semi-structured\n   interviews and participant observation.  Or,\
    \ in non-academic\n   language, the way the language in IETF/IRTF documents describes\
    \ and\n   approaches the issues they are trying to address is an indication of\n\
    \   the underlying social assumptions and relationships of the engineers\n   to\
    \ their engineering.  By reading and analyzing these documents, as\n   well as\
    \ interviewing engineers and participating in the IETF/IRTF\n   working groups,\
    \ it is possible to distill the relationship between\n   human rights, protocols,\
    \ and the Internet's infrastructure as it\n   pertains to the work of the IETF.\n\
    \   The discourse analysis was operationalized using qualitative and\n   quantitative\
    \ means.  The first step taken by the authors and\n   contributors was reading\
    \ RFCs and other official IETF documents.  The\n   second step was the use of\
    \ a Python-based analyzer, using the\n   \"Bigbang\" tool, adapted by Nick Doty\
    \ [Doty], to scan for the concepts\n   that were identified as important architectural\
    \ principles (distilled\n   on the initial reading and supplemented by the interviews\
    \ and\n   participant observation).  Such a quantitative method is very precise\n\
    \   and speeds up the research process [Ritchie].  But this tool is\n   unable\
    \ to understand \"latent meaning\" [Denzin].  In order to mitigate\n   these issues\
    \ of automated word-frequency-based approaches and to get\n   a sense of the \"\
    thick meaning\" [Geertz] of the data, a second\n   qualitative analysis of the\
    \ data set was performed.  These various\n   rounds of discourse analysis were\
    \ used to inform the interviews and\n   further data analysis.  As such, the initial\
    \ rounds of quantitative\n   discourse analysis were used to inform the second\
    \ rounds of\n   qualitative analysis.  The results from the qualitative interviews\n\
    \   were again used to feed new concepts into the quantitative discourse\n   analysis.\
    \  As such, the two methods continued to support and enrich\n   each other.\n\
    \   The ethnographic methods of the data collection and processing\n   allowed\
    \ the research group to acquire the data necessary to \"provide\n   a holistic\
    \ understanding of research participants' views and actions\"\n   [Denzin] that\
    \ highlighted ongoing issues and case studies where\n   protocols impact human\
    \ rights.  The interview participants were\n   selected through purposive sampling\
    \ [Babbie], as the research group\n   was interested in getting a wide variety\
    \ of opinions on the role of\n   human rights in guiding protocol development.\
    \  This sampling method\n   also ensured that individuals with extensive experience\
    \ working at\n   the IETF in various roles were targeted.  The interviewees included\n\
    \   individuals in leadership positions (Working Group (WG) chairs, Area\n   Directors\
    \ (ADs)), \"regular participants\", and individuals working for\n   specific entities\
    \ (corporate, civil society, political, academic) and\n   represented various\
    \ backgrounds, nationalities, and genders.\n"

    \ Paradigms That Adversely Impact Human Rights or Are Enablers\n        Thereof\n\
    \   Given the information above, the following list of cases of\n   protocols,\
    \ implementations, and networking paradigms that either\n   adversely impact or\
    \ enable human rights was formed.\n   It is important to note that the assessment\
    \ here is not a general\n   judgment on these protocols, nor is it an exhaustive\
    \ listing of all\n   the potential negative or positive impacts on human rights\
    \ that these\n   protocols might have.  When these protocols were conceived, there\n\
    \   were many criteria to take into account.  For instance, relying on a\n   centralized\
    \ service can be bad for freedom of speech (it creates one\n   more control point,\
    \ where censorship could be applied), but it may be\n   a necessity if the endpoints\
    \ are not connected and reachable\n   permanently.  So, when we say \"protocol\
    \ X has feature Y, which may\n   endanger freedom of speech,\" it does not mean\
    \ that protocol X is bad,\n   much less that its authors were evil.  The goal\
    \ here is to show, with\n   actual examples, that the design of protocols has\
    \ practical\n   consequences for some human rights and that these consequences\
    \ have\n   to be considered in the design phase.\n"
- title: 5.2.3.1.  IPv4
  contents:
  - "5.2.3.1.  IPv4\n   The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), also known as \"Layer\
    \ 3\" of\n   the Internet and specified with a common encapsulation and protocol\n\
    \   header, is defined in [RFC791].  The evolution of Internet\n   communications\
    \ led to continued development in this area,\n   \"encapsulated\" in the development\
    \ of version 6 (IPv6) of the protocol\n   [RFC8200].  In spite of this updated\
    \ protocol, we find that 23 years\n   after the specification of IPv6 the older\
    \ IPv4 standard continues to\n   account for a sizable majority of Internet traffic.\
    \  Most of the\n   issues discussed here (Network Address Translators (NATs) are\
    \ a major\n   exception; see Section 5.2.3.1.2 (\"Address Translation and\n  \
    \ Mobility\")) are valid for IPv4 as well as IPv6.\n   The Internet was designed\
    \ as a platform for free and open\n   communication, most notably encoded in the\
    \ end-to-end principle, and\n   that philosophy is also present in the technical\
    \ implementation of IP\n   [RFC3724].  While the protocol was designed to exist\
    \ in an\n   environment where intelligence is at the end hosts, it has proven\
    \ to\n   provide sufficient information that a more intelligent network core\n\
    \   can make policy decisions and enforce policy-based traffic shaping,\n   thereby\
    \ restricting the communications of end hosts.  These\n   capabilities for network\
    \ control and for limitations on freedom of\n   expression by end hosts can be\
    \ traced back to the design of IPv4,\n   helping us to understand which technical\
    \ protocol decisions have led\n   to harm to this human right.  A feature that\
    \ can harm freedom of\n   expression as well as the right to privacy through misuse\
    \ of IP is\n   the exploitation of the public visibility of the host pairs for\
    \ all\n   communications and the corresponding ability to differentiate and\n\
    \   block traffic as a result of that metadata.\n"
- title: 5.2.3.1.1.  Network Visibility of Source and Destination
  contents:
  - "5.2.3.1.1.  Network Visibility of Source and Destination\n   The IPv4 protocol\
    \ header contains fixed location fields for both the\n   source IP address and\
    \ destination IP address [RFC791].  These\n   addresses identify both the host\
    \ sending and the host receiving each\n   message; they also allow the core network\
    \ to understand who is\n   talking to whom and to practically limit communication\
    \ selectively\n   between pairs of hosts.  Blocking of communication based on\
    \ the pair\n   of source and destination is one of the most common limitations\
    \ on\n   the ability for people to communicate today [CAIDA] and can be seen\n\
    \   as a restriction of the ability for people to assemble or to\n   consensually\
    \ express themselves.\n   Inclusion of an Internet-wide identified source in the\
    \ IP header\n   is not the only possible design, especially since the protocol\
    \ is\n   most commonly implemented over Ethernet networks exposing only\n   link-local\
    \ identifiers [RFC894].\n   A variety of alternative designs do exist, such as\
    \ the Accountable\n   and Private Internet Protocol [APIP] and High-speed Onion\
    \ Routing at\n   the Network Layer (HORNET) [HORNET] as well as source routing.\
    \  The\n   latter would allow the sender to choose a predefined (safe) route and\n\
    \   spoofing of the source IP address, which are technically supported by\n  \
    \ IPv4, but neither are considered good practice on the Internet\n   [Farrow].\
    \  While projects like [TorProject] provide an alternative\n   implementation\
    \ of anonymity in connections, they have been developed\n   in spite of the IPv4\
    \ protocol design.\n"
- title: 5.2.3.1.2.  Address Translation and Mobility
  contents:
  - "5.2.3.1.2.  Address Translation and Mobility\n   A major structural shift in\
    \ the Internet that undermined the protocol\n   design of IPv4, and significantly\
    \ reduced the freedom of end users to\n   communicate and assemble, was the introduction\
    \ of network address\n   translation [RFC3022].  Network address translation is\
    \ a process\n   whereby organizations and autonomous systems connect two networks\
    \ by\n   translating the IPv4 source and destination addresses between them.\n\
    \   This process puts the router performing the translation in a\n   privileged\
    \ position, where it is predetermined which subset of\n   communications will\
    \ be translated.\n   This process of translation has widespread adoption despite\
    \ promoting\n   a process that goes against the stated end-to-end process of the\n\
    \   underlying protocol [NATusage].  In contrast, the proposed mechanism\n   to\
    \ provide support for mobility and forwarding to clients that may\n   move --\
    \ encoded instead as an option in IP [RFC5944] -- has failed to\n   gain traction.\
    \  In this situation, the compromise made in the design\n   of the protocol resulted\
    \ in a technology that is not coherent with\n   the end-to-end principles and\
    \ thus creates an extra possible hurdle\n   for freedom of expression in its design,\
    \ even though a viable\n   alternative exists.  There is a particular problem\
    \ surrounding NATs\n   and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) (as well as other connections\n\
    \   used for privacy purposes), as NATs sometimes cause VPNs not to work.\n"
- title: 5.2.3.2.  DNS
  contents:
  - "5.2.3.2.  DNS\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035] provides service discovery\n\
    \   capabilities and provides a mechanism to associate human-readable\n   names\
    \ with services.  The DNS is organized around a set of\n   independently operated\
    \ \"root servers\" run by organizations that\n   function in line with ICANN's\
    \ policy by answering queries for which\n   organizations have been delegated\
    \ to manage registration under each\n   Top-Level Domain (TLD).  The DNS is organized\
    \ as a rooted tree, and\n   this brings up political and social concerns over\
    \ control.  TLDs are\n   maintained and determined by ICANN.  These namespaces\
    \ encompass\n   several classes of services.  The initial namespaces, including\n\
    \   \".com\" and \".net\", provide common spaces for expression of ideas,\n  \
    \ though their policies are enacted through US-based companies.  Other\n   namespaces\
    \ are delegated to specific nationalities and may impose\n   limits designed to\
    \ focus speech in those forums, to both (1) promote\n   speech from that nationality\
    \ and (2) comply with local limits on\n   expression and social norms.  Finally,\
    \ the system has recently been\n   expanded with additional generic and sponsored\
    \ namespaces -- for\n   instance, \".travel\" and \".ninja\" -- that are operated\
    \ by a range of\n   organizations that may independently determine their registration\n\
    \   policies.  This new development has both positive and negative\n   implications\
    \ in terms of enabling human rights.  Some individuals\n   argue that it undermines\
    \ the right to freedom of expression because\n   some of these new generic TLDs\
    \ have restricted policies on\n   registration and particular rules on hate speech\
    \ content.  Others\n   argue that precisely these properties are positive because\
    \ they\n   enable certain (mostly minority) communities to build safer spaces\n\
    \   for association, thereby enabling their right to freedom of\n   association.\
    \  An often-mentioned example is an application like\n   .gay [CoE].\n   As discussed\
    \ in [RFC7626], DNS has significant privacy issues.  Most\n   notable is the lack\
    \ of encryption to limit the visibility of requests\n   for domain resolution\
    \ from intermediary parties, and a limited\n   deployment of DNSSEC to provide\
    \ authentication, allowing the client\n   to know that they received a correct,\
    \ \"authoritative\" answer to a\n   query.  In response to the privacy issues,\
    \ the IETF DNS Private\n   Exchange (DPRIVE) Working Group is developing mechanisms\
    \ to provide\n   confidentiality to DNS transactions, to address concerns surrounding\n\
    \   pervasive monitoring [RFC7258].\n   Authentication through DNSSEC creates\
    \ a validation path for records.\n   This authentication protects against forged\
    \ or manipulated DNS data.\n   As such, DNSSEC protects directory lookups and\
    \ makes it harder to\n   hijack a session.  This is important because interference\
    \ with the\n   operation of the DNS is currently becoming one of the central\n\
    \   mechanisms used to block access to websites.  This interference\n   limits\
    \ both the freedom of expression of the publisher to offer their\n   content and\
    \ the freedom of assembly for clients to congregate in a\n   shared virtual space.\
    \  Even though DNSSEC doesn't prevent censorship,\n   it makes it clear that the\
    \ returned information is not the\n   information that was requested; this contributes\
    \ to the right to\n   security and increases trust in the network.  It is, however,\n\
    \   important to note that DNSSEC is currently not widely supported or\n   deployed\
    \ by domain name registrars, making it difficult to\n   authenticate and use correctly.\n"
- title: 5.2.3.2.1.  Removal of Records
  contents:
  - "5.2.3.2.1.  Removal of Records\n   There have been a number of cases where the\
    \ records for a domain are\n   removed from the name system due to political events.\
    \  Examples of\n   this removal include the \"seizure\" of wikileaks [BBC-wikileaks]\
    \ and\n   the names of illegally operating gambling operations by the United\n\
    \   States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unit.  In the first\n   case,\
    \ a US court ordered the registrar to take down the domain.  In\n   the second,\
    \ ICE compelled the US-based registry in charge of the .com\n   TLD to hand ownership\
    \ of those domains over to the US government.\n   The same technique has been\
    \ used in Libya to remove sites in\n   violation of \"our Country's Law and Morality\
    \ (which) do not allow any\n   kind of pornography or its promotion.\"  [techyum]\n\
    \   At a protocol level, there is no technical auditing for name\n   ownership,\
    \ as in alternate systems like Namecoin [Namecoin].  As a\n   result, there is\
    \ no ability for users to differentiate seizure from\n   the legitimate transfer\
    \ of name ownership, which is purely a policy\n   decision made by registrars.\
    \  While DNSSEC addresses the network\n   distortion events described below, it\
    \ does not tackle this problem.\n   (Although we mention alternative techniques,\
    \ this is not a comparison\n   of DNS with Namecoin: the latter has its own problems\
    \ and\n   limitations.  The idea here is to show that there are several\n   possible\
    \ choices, and they have consequences for human rights.)\n"
- title: 5.2.3.2.2.  Distortion of Records
  contents:
  - "5.2.3.2.2.  Distortion of Records\n   The most common mechanism by which the\
    \ DNS is abused to limit freedom\n   of expression is through manipulation of\
    \ protocol messages by the\n   network.  One form occurs at an organizational\
    \ level, where client\n   computers are instructed to use a local DNS resolver\
    \ controlled by\n   the organization.  The DNS resolver will then selectively\
    \ distort\n   responses rather than request the authoritative lookup from the\n\
    \   upstream system.  The second form occurs through the use of Deep\n   Packet\
    \ Inspection (DPI), where all DNS protocol messages are\n   inspected by the network\
    \ and objectionable content is distorted, as\n   can be observed in Chinese networks.\n\
    \   A notable instance of distortion occurred in Greece [Ververis], where\n  \
    \ a study found evidence of both (1) DPI to distort DNS replies and\n   (2) more\
    \ excessive blocking of content than was legally required or\n   requested (also\
    \ known as \"overblocking\").  Internet Service Providers\n   (ISPs), obeying\
    \ a governmental order, prevented clients from\n   resolving the names of domains,\
    \ thereby prompting this particular\n   blocking of systems there.\n   At a protocol\
    \ level, the effectiveness of these attacks is made\n   possible by a lack of\
    \ authentication in the DNS protocol.  DNSSEC\n   provides the ability to determine\
    \ the authenticity of responses when\n   used, but it is not regularly checked\
    \ by resolvers.  DNSSEC is not\n   effective when the local resolver for a network\
    \ is complicit in the\n   distortion -- for instance, when the resolver assigned\

    \ is a request-response application protocol developed throughout the\n   1990s.\
    \  HTTP factually contributed to the exponential growth of the\n   Internet and\
    \ the interconnection of populations around the world.\n   Its simple design strongly\
    \ contributed to the fact that HTTP has\n   become the foundation of most modern\
    \ Internet platforms and\n   communication systems, from websites to chat systems\
    \ and computer-to-\n   computer applications.  In its manifestation in the World\
    \ Wide Web,\n   HTTP radically revolutionized the course of technological development\n\
    \   and the ways people interact with online content and with each other.\n  \
    \ However, HTTP is also a fundamentally insecure protocol that doesn't\n   natively\
    \ provide encryption properties.  While the definition of the\n   Secure Sockets\
    \ Layer (SSL) [RFC6101], and later of Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS) [RFC5246],\
    \ also happened during the 1990s, the fact\n   that HTTP doesn't mandate the use\
    \ of such encryption layers by\n   developers and service providers was one of\
    \ the reasons for a very\n   late adoption of encryption.  Only in the middle\
    \ of the 2000s did we\n   observe big ISPs, such as Google, starting to provide\
    \ encrypted\n   access to their web services.\n   The lack of sensitivity and\
    \ understanding of the critical importance\n   of securing web traffic incentivized\
    \ certain (offensive) actors to\n   develop, deploy, and utilize interception\
    \ systems at large and to\n   later launch active injection attacks, in order\
    \ to swipe large\n   amounts of data and compromise Internet-enabled devices.\
    \  The\n   commercial availability of systems and tools to perform these types\n\

    \ discovered and reported over the years.\n   Generally, we can identify traffic\
    \ interception (Section 5.2.3.3.1)\n   and traffic manipulation (Section 5.2.3.3.2)\
    \ as the two most\n   problematic attacks that can be performed against applications\n\
    \   employing a cleartext HTTP transport layer.  That being said, the\n   IETF\
    \ is taking steady steps to move to the encrypted version of HTTP,\n   HTTP Secure\
    \ (HTTPS).\n   While this is commendable, we must not lose track of the fact that\n\
    \   different protocols, implementations, configurations, and networking\n   paradigms\
    \ can intersect such that they (can be used to) adversely\n   impact human rights.\

    \ of\n   encryption on the World Wide Web.  It is important to consider that\n\
    \   the adoption of SSL/TLS is also a relatively recent phenomenon.\n   Email\
    \ providers such as riseup.net were the first to enable SSL by\n   default.  Google\
    \ did not introduce an option for its Gmail users to\n   navigate with SSL until\
    \ 2008 [Rideout] and turned TLS on by default\n   later, in 2010 [Schillace].\
    \  It took an increasing amount of security\n   breaches and revelations on global\
    \ surveillance from Edward Snowden\n   before other mail service providers followed\
    \ suit.  For example,\n   Yahoo did not enable SSL/TLS by default on its webmail\
    \ services until\n   early 2014 [Peterson].\n   TLS itself has been subject to\
    \ many attacks and bugs; this situation\n   can be attributed to some fundamental\
    \ design weaknesses, such as lack\n   of a state machine (which opens a vulnerability\
    \ for triple handshake\n   attacks) and flaws caused by early US government restrictions\
    \ on\n   cryptography, leading to cipher-suite downgrade attacks (Logjam\n   attacks).\

    \   HTTP upgrading to HTTPS is also vulnerable to having an attacker\n   remove\
    \ the \"s\" in any links to HTTPS URIs from a web page transferred\n   in cleartext\
    \ over HTTP -- an attack called \"SSL Stripping\"\n   [sslstrip].  Thus, for high-security\

    \ [RFC6797], certificate\n   pinning [RFC7469], and/or DNS-Based Authentication\

    \   in 2011, it was found that the French technology firm Amesys provided\n  \
    \ the Gadhafi government with equipment able to intercept emails,\n   Facebook\
    \ traffic, and chat messages at a country-wide level [WSJ].\n   The use of such\

  - "5.2.3.3.2.  Traffic Manipulation\n   The lack of a secure transport layer under\
    \ HTTP connections not only\n   exposes users to interception of the content of\
    \ their communications\n   but is more and more commonly abused as a vehicle for\
    \ actively\n   compromising computers and mobile devices.  If an HTTP session\n\
    \   travels in the clear over the network, any node positioned at any\n   point\
    \ in the network is able to perform man-in-the-middle attacks;\n   the node can\
    \ observe, manipulate, and hijack the session and can\n   modify the content of\
    \ the communication in order to trigger\n   unexpected behavior by the application\
    \ generating the traffic.  For\n   example, in the case of a browser, the attacker\
    \ would be able to\n   inject malicious code in order to exploit vulnerabilities\
    \ in the\n   browser or any of its plugins.  Similarly, the attacker would be\
    \ able\n   to intercept, add malware to, and repackage binary software updates\n\
    \   that are very commonly downloaded in the clear by applications such\n   as\
    \ word processors and media players.  If the HTTP session were\n   encrypted,\
    \ the tampering of the content would not be possible, and\n   these network injection\
    \ attacks would not be successful.\n   While traffic manipulation attacks have\
    \ long been known, documented,\n   and prototyped, especially in the context of\
    \ Wi-Fi and LAN networks,\n   in the last few years we have observed an increasing\
    \ investment in\n   the production and sale of network injection equipment that\
    \ is both\n   commercially available and deployed at scale by intelligence\n \
    \  agencies.\n   For example, we learned from some of the documents provided by\
    \ Edward\n   Snowden to the press that the NSA has constructed a global network\n\
    \   injection infrastructure, called \"QUANTUM\", able to leverage mass\n   surveillance\
    \ in order to identify targets of interest and\n   subsequently task man-on-the-side\
    \ attacks to ultimately compromise a\n   selected device.  Among other attacks,\
    \ the NSA makes use of an attack\n   called \"QUANTUMINSERT\" [Haagsma], which\
    \ intercepts and hijacks an\n   unencrypted HTTP communication and forces the\
    \ requesting browser to\n   redirect to a host controlled by the NSA instead of\
    \ the intended\n   website.  Normally, the new destination would be an exploitation\n\
    \   service, referred to in Snowden documents as \"FOXACID\", which would\n  \
    \ attempt to execute malicious code in the context of the target's\n   browser.\
    \  The Guardian reported in 2013 that the NSA has, for\n   example, been using\
    \ these techniques to target users of the popular\n   anonymity service Tor [Schneier].\
    \  The German Norddeutscher Rundfunk\n   (NDR) reported in 2014 that the NSA has\
    \ also been using its\n   mass-surveillance capabilities to identify Tor users\
    \ at large\n   [Appelbaum].\n   Recently, similar capabilities used by Chinese\
    \ authorities have been\n   reported as well in what has been informally called\
    \ the \"Great\n   Cannon\" [Marcak], which raised numerous concerns on the potential\n\
    \   curb on human rights and freedom of speech due to the increasingly\n   tighter\
    \ control of Chinese Internet communications and access to\n   information.\n\
    \   Network injection attacks are also made widely available to state\n   actors\
    \ around the world through the commercialization of similar,\n   smaller-scale\
    \ equipment that can be easily acquired and deployed at a\n   country-wide level.\
    \  Certain companies are known to have network\n   injection gear within their\
    \ products portfolio [Marquis-Boire].  The\n   technology devised and produced\
    \ by some of them to perform network\n   traffic manipulation attacks on HTTP\
    \ communications is even the\n   subject of a patent application in the United\
    \ States [Googlepatent].\n   Access to offensive technologies available on the\
    \ commercial lawful\n   interception market has led to human rights abuses and\
    \ illegitimate\n   surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and political\n\
    \   activists in many countries around the world [Collins].  While\n   network\
    \ injection attacks haven't been the subject of much attention,\n   they do enable\
    \ even unskilled attackers to perform silent and very\n   resilient compromises,\
    \ and unencrypted HTTP remains one of the main\n   vehicles.\n   There is a new\
    \ version of HTTP, called \"HTTP/2\" [RFC7540], which aims\n   to be largely backwards\
    \ compatible while also offering new options\n   such as data compression of HTTP\
    \ headers, pipelining of requests, and\n   multiplexing multiple requests over\
    \ a single TCP connection.  In\n   addition to decreasing latency to improve page-loading\
    \ speeds, it\n   also facilitates more efficient use of connectivity in low-bandwidth\n\
    \   environments, which in turn enables freedom of expression; the right\n   to\
    \ assembly; the right to political participation; and the right to\n   participate\
    \ in cultural life, arts, and science.  [RFC7540] does not\n   mandate TLS or\

    \ that Sybil attacks in this context (e.g.,\n   astroturfing) are relevant to\
    \ more than P2P protocols; they are also\n   common on web-based systems, and\
    \ they are exploited by governments\n   and commercial entities.\n   Encrypted\
    \ P2P and anonymous P2P networks have already emerged.  They\n   provide viable\
    \ platforms for sharing material [Tribler], publishing\n   content anonymously,\
    \ and communicating securely [Bitmessage].  These\n   platforms are not perfect,\
    \ and more research needs to be done.  If\n   adopted at large, well-designed\
    \ and resistant P2P networks might\n   represent a critical component of a future\

    \ of\n   VPNs, and they generally diversify by encryption protocol or\n   particular\
    \ requirements, most commonly in proprietary and enterprise\n   solutions.  VPNs\

  contents:
  - "5.2.3.6.1.  No Anonymity against VPN Providers\n   One of the common misconceptions\
    \ among users of VPNs is the level of\n   anonymity that VPNs can provide.  This\
    \ sense of anonymity can be\n   betrayed by a number of attacks or misconfigurations\
    \ of the VPN\n   provider.  It is important to remember that, in contrast to Tor\
    \ and\n   similar systems, VPNs were not designed to provide anonymity\n   properties.\
    \  From a technical point of view, a VPN might leak\n   identifiable information\
    \ or might be the subject of correlation\n   attacks that could expose the originating\
    \ address of a connecting\n   user.  Most importantly, it is vital to understand\
    \ that commercial\n   and non-commercial VPN providers are bound by the law of\
    \ the\n   jurisdiction in which they reside or in which their infrastructure is\n\
    \   located, and they might be legally forced to turn over data of\n   specific\
    \ users if legal investigations or intelligence requirements\n   dictate so. \
    \ In such cases, if the VPN providers retain logs, it is\n   possible that a user's\
    \ information could be provided to the user's\n   adversary and lead to his or\
    \ her identification.\n"

    \   users, and they are able to track at what time they started their\n   session\
    \ and, eventually, also to which destinations they're trying to\n   connect. \
    \ If the VPN providers retain logs for a long enough time,\n   they might be forced\
    \ to turn over the relevant data or they might be\n   otherwise compromised, leading\
    \ to the same data getting exposed.  A\n   clear log-retention policy could be\

    \   generally caused by a lack of proper configuration of the client's\n   IPv6\

    \ have been supporting IPv6 by default, if the\n   host is provided with a functional\

  contents:
  - "5.2.3.7.  HTTP Status Code 451\n   \"Every Internet user has run into the '404\
    \ Not Found' Hypertext\n   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status code when trying, and\
    \ failing, to\n   access a particular website\" [Cath].  It is a response status\
    \ that\n   the server sends to the browser when the server cannot locate the\n\
    \   URL. \"403 Forbidden\" is another example of this class of code signals\n\
    \   that gives users information about what is going on.  In the \"403\"\n   case,\
    \ the server can be reached but is blocking the request because\n   the user is\
    \ trying to access content forbidden to them, typically\n   because some content\
    \ is only for identified users, based on a payment\n   or on special status in\
    \ the organization.  Most of the time, 403 is\n   sent by the origin server, not\
    \ by an intermediary.  If a firewall\n   prevents a government employee from accessing\
    \ pornography on a work\n   computer, it does not use 403.\n   As surveillance\
    \ and censorship of the Internet are becoming more\n   commonplace, voices were\
    \ raised at the IETF to introduce a new status\n   code that indicates when something\
    \ is not available for \"legal\n   reasons\" (like censorship):\n   The 451 status\
    \ code would allow server operators to operate with\n   greater transparency in\
    \ circumstances where issues of law or public\n   policy affect their operation.\
    \  This transparency may be beneficial\n   to both (1) these operators and (2)\
    \ end users [RFC7725].\n   The status code is named \"451\" in reference to both\
    \ Bradbury's famous\n   novel \"Fahrenheit 451\" and to 451 degrees Fahrenheit\
    \ (the temperature\n   at which some claim book paper autoignites).\n   During\
    \ the IETF 92 meeting in Dallas, there was discussion about the\n   usefulness\
    \ of 451.  The main tension revolved around the lack of an\n   apparent machine-readable\
    \ technical use of the information.  The\n   extent to which 451 is just \"political\
    \ theatre\" or whether it has a\n   concrete technical use was heatedly debated.\
    \  Some argued that \"the\n   451 status code is just a status code with a response\
    \ body\"; others\n   said it was problematic because \"it brings law into the\
    \ picture.\"\n   Still others argued that it would be useful for individuals or\
    \ for\n   organizations like the \"Chilling Effects\" project that are crawling\n\
    \   the Web to get an indication of censorship (IETF discussion on 451 --\n  \
    \ author's field notes, March 2015).  There was no outright objection\n   during\
    \ the Dallas meeting against moving forward on status code 451,\n   and on December\
    \ 18, 2015, the IESG approved \"An HTTP Status Code to\n   Report Legal Obstacles\"\
    \ (now [RFC7725]) for publication.  HTTP status\n   code 451 is now an IETF-approved\
    \ HTTP status code that signals when\n   resource access is denied as a consequence\
    \ of legal demands.\n   What is interesting about this particular case is that\
    \ not only\n   technical arguments but also the status code's outright potential\n\
    \   political use for civil society played a substantial role in shaping\n   the\
    \ discussion and the decision to move forward with this technology.\n   It is\
    \ nonetheless important to note that HTTP status code 451 is not\n   a solution\
    \ to detect all occasions of censorship.  A large swath of\n   Internet filtering\
    \ occurs in the network, at a lower level than HTTP,\n   rather than at the server\
    \ itself.  For these forms of censorship, 451\n   plays a limited role, as typical\
    \ censoring intermediaries won't\n   generate it.  Besides technical reasons,\
    \ such filtering regimes are\n   unlikely to voluntarily inject a 451 status code.\
    \  The use of 451 is\n   most likely to apply in the case of cooperative, legal\
    \ versions of\n   content removal resulting from requests to providers.  One can\
    \ think\n   of content that is removed or blocked for legal reasons, like\n  \
    \ copyright infringement, gambling laws, child abuse, etc.  Large\n   Internet\
    \ companies and search engines are constantly asked to censor\n   content in various\
    \ jurisdictions.  451 allows this to be easily\n   discovered -- for instance,\
    \ by initiatives like the Lumen Database.\n   Overall, the strength of 451 lies\
    \ in its ability to provide\n   transparency by giving the reason for blocking\
    \ and giving the\n   end user the ability to file a complaint.  It allows organizations\
    \ to\n   easily measure censorship in an automated way and prompts the user to\n\
    \   access the content via another path (e.g., Tor, VPNs) when (s)he\n   encounters\
    \ the 451 status code.\n   Status code 451 impacts human rights by making censorship\
    \ more\n   transparent and measurable.  It increases transparency by signaling\n\
    \   the existence of censorship (instead of a much broader HTTP error\n   message\
    \ such as HTTP status code 404) as well as providing details of\n   the legal\
    \ restriction, which legal authority is imposing it, and to\n   what class of\
    \ resources it applies.  This empowers the user to seek\n   redress.\n"
- title: 5.2.3.8.  DDoS Attacks
  contents:
  - "5.2.3.8.  DDoS Attacks\n   Many individuals, including IETF engineers, have argued\
    \ that DDoS\n   attacks are fundamentally against freedom of expression.\n   Technically,\
    \ DDoS attacks are attacks where one host or multiple\n   hosts overload the bandwidth\
    \ or resources of another host by flooding\n   it with traffic or making resource-intensive\
    \ requests, causing it to\n   temporarily stop being available to users.  One\
    \ can roughly\n   differentiate three types of DDoS attacks:\n   1.  volume-based\
    \ attacks (which aim to make the host unreachable by\n       using up all its\
    \ bandwidth; often-used techniques are UDP floods\n       and ICMP floods)\n \
    \  2.  protocol attacks (which aim to use up actual server resources;\n      \
    \ often-used techniques are SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks,\n       and\
    \ \"ping of death\" [RFC4949])\n   3.  application-layer attacks (which aim to\
    \ bring down a server, such\n       as a web server)\n   DDoS attacks can thus\
    \ stifle freedom of expression and complicate the\n   ability of independent media\
    \ and human rights organizations to\n   exercise their right to (online) freedom\
    \ of association, while\n   facilitating the ability of governments to censor\
    \ dissent.  When it\n   comes to comparing DDoS attacks to protests in offline\
    \ life, it is\n   important to remember that only a limited number of DDoS attacks\n\
    \   solely involved willing participants.  In the overwhelming majority\n   of\
    \ cases, the clients are hacked hosts of unrelated parties that\n   have not consented\
    \ to being part of a DDoS (for exceptions, see\n   Operation Ababil [Ababil] or\
    \ the Iranian Green Movement's DDoS\n   campaign at election time [GreenMovement]).\
    \  In addition,\n   DDoS attacks are increasingly used as an extortion tactic.\n\
    \   All of these issues seem to suggest that the IETF should try to\n   ensure\
    \ that their protocols cannot be used for DDoS attacks; this is\n   consistent\
    \ with the long-standing IETF consensus that DDoS is an\n   attack that protocols\
    \ should mitigate to the extent they can [BCP72].\n   Decreasing the number of\
    \ vulnerabilities in protocols and (outside of\n   the IETF) the number of bugs\
    \ in the network stacks of routers or\n   computers could address this issue.\
    \  The IETF can clearly play a role\n   in bringing about some of these changes,\
    \ but the IETF cannot be\n   expected to take a positive stance on (specific)\
    \ DDoS attacks or to\n   create protocols that enable some attacks and inhibit\
    \ others.  What\n   the IETF can do is critically reflect on its role in the development\n\
    \   of the Internet and how this impacts the ability of people to\n   exercise\
    \ their human rights, such as freedom of expression.\n"

- title: 6.1.  Human Rights Threats
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Human Rights Threats\n   Human rights threats on the Internet come in a\
    \ myriad of forms.\n   Protocols and standards can either harm or enable the right\
    \ to\n   freedom of expression; the right to non-discrimination; the right to\n\
    \   equal protection; the right to participate in cultural life, arts,\n   and\
    \ science; the right to freedom of assembly and association; and\n   the right\
    \ to security.  An end user who is denied access to certain\n   services, data,\
    \ or websites may be unable to disclose vital\n   information about malpractice\
    \ on the part of a government or other\n   authority.  A person whose communications\
    \ are monitored may be\n   prevented from exercising their right to freedom of\
    \ association or\n   participation in political processes [Penney].  In a worst-case\n\
    \   scenario, protocols that leak information can lead to physical\n   danger.\
    \  A realistic example to consider is when, based on\n   information gathered\
    \ by state agencies through information leakage in\n   protocols, individuals\
    \ perceived as threats to the state are\n   subjected to torture, extrajudicial\
    \ killings, or detention.\n   This section details several \"common\" threats\
    \ to human rights,\n   indicating how each of these can lead to harm to, or violations\
    \ of,\n   human rights.  It also presents several examples of how these threats\n\
    \   to human rights materialize on the Internet.  This threat modeling is\n  \
    \ inspired by [RFC6973] (\"Privacy Considerations for Internet\n   Protocols\"\
    ), which is based on security threat analysis.  This method\n   is by no means\
    \ a perfect solution for assessing human rights risks in\n   Internet protocols\
    \ and systems; it is, however, the best approach\n   currently available.  Certain\
    \ specific human rights threats are\n   indirectly considered in Internet protocols\

    \ [RFC6973] or reviews,\n   let alone the assessments of the impact of protocols\
    \ on human rights,\n   are not standardized or implemented.\n   Many threats,\
    \ enablers, and risks are linked to different rights.\n   This is not surprising\
    \ if one takes into account that human rights\n   are interrelated, interdependent,\
    \ and indivisible.  Here, however,\n   we're not discussing all human rights,\
    \ because not all human rights\n   are relevant to ICTs in general and to protocols\
    \ and standards in\n   particular [Bless1]:\n      The main source of the values\
    \ of human rights is the International\n      Bill of Human Rights that is composed\
    \ of the Universal Declaration\n      of Human Rights [UDHR] along with the International\
    \ Covenant on\n      Civil and Political Rights [ICCPR] and the International\
    \ Covenant\n      on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [ICESCR].  In the light\
    \ of\n      several cases of Internet censorship, the Human Rights Council\n \
    \     Resolution 20/8 was adopted in 2012 [UNHRC2016], affirming \"...\n     \
    \ that the same rights that people have offline must also be\n      protected\
    \ online ...\"  In 2015, the Charter of Human Rights and\n      Principles for\
    \ the Internet [IRP] was developed and released.\n      According to these documents,\
    \ some examples of human rights\n      relevant for ICT systems are human dignity\
    \ (Art. 1 UDHR),\n      non-discrimination (Art. 2), rights to life, liberty and\
    \ security\n      (Art. 3), freedom of opinion and expression (Art. 19), freedom\

    \      legal remedy, fair trial, due process, presumed innocent\n      (Art. 7-11),\
    \ appropriate social and international order (Art. 28),\n      participation in\
    \ public affairs (Art. 21), participation in\n      cultural life, protection\

    \ of open,\n      non-proprietary standards [Zittrain].  They are crucial for\n\
    \      enabling interoperability.  Yet, open standards are not explicitly\n  \
    \    defined within the IETF.  On the subject, [RFC2026] states the\n      following:\
    \ \"Various national and international standards bodies,\n      such as ANSI,\
    \ ISO, IEEE, and ITU-T, develop a variety of protocol\n      and service specifications\
    \ that are similar to Technical\n      Specifications defined\" at the IETF. \
    \ \"National and international\n      groups also publish 'implementors' agreements'\

    \      specific detail concerned with the practical application of their\n   \
    \   standards.  All of these are considered to be 'open external\n      standards'\
    \ for the purposes of the Internet Standards Process.\"\n      Similarly, [RFC3935]\
    \ does not define open standards but does\n      emphasize the importance of \"\
    open process\": any interested person\n      can participate in the work, know\
    \ what is being decided, and make\n      his or her voice heard on the issue.\
    \  Part of this principle is\n      the IETF's commitment to making its documents,\
    \ WG mailing lists,\n      attendance lists, and meeting minutes publicly available\
    \ on the\n      Internet.\n      Open standards are important, as they allow for\
    \ permissionless\n      innovation, which in turn is important for maintaining\
    \ the freedom\n      and ability to freely create and deploy new protocols on\
    \ top of\n      the communications constructs that currently exist.  It is at\
    \ the\n      heart of the Internet as we know it, and to maintain its\n      fundamentally\
    \ open nature, we need to be mindful of the need for\n      developing open standards.\n\
    \      All standards that need to be normatively implemented should be\n     \
    \ freely available and should provide reasonable protection against\n      patent\
    \ infringement claims, so that it can also be implemented in\n      open-source\
    \ or free software.  Patents have often held back open\n      standardization\
    \ or have been used against those deploying open\n      standards, particularly\
    \ in the domain of cryptography [Newegg].\n      An exemption is sometimes made\
    \ when a protocol that normatively\n      relies on specifications produced by\
    \ other SDOs that are not\n      freely available is standardized.  Patents in\
    \ open standards or in\n      normative references to other standards should have\
    \ a patent\n      disclosure [notewell], royalty-free licensing [patentpolicy],\
    \ or\n      some other form of reasonable protection.  Reasonable patent\n   \
    \   protection should include, but is not limited to, cryptographic\n      primitives.\n\

    \ that could in turn be easily reversed by generating a\n      hash for each potential\

    \ of personal data remains\n      important.\n      \"Pseudonymity\" means using\

  - "6.2.13.  Decentralization\n   Questions:\n   -  Can your protocol be implemented\
    \ without one single point of\n      control?\n   -  If applicable, can your protocol\
    \ be deployed in a federated\n      manner?\n   -  What is the potential for discrimination\
    \ against users of your\n      protocol?\n   -  Can your protocol be used to negatively\
    \ implicate users (e.g.,\n      incrimination, accusation)?\n   -  Does your protocol\
    \ create additional centralized points of\n      control?\n   Explanation:  Decentralization\
    \ is one of the central technical\n      concepts of the architecture of networks\
    \ and is embraced as such\n      by the IETF [RFC3935].  It refers to the absence\
    \ or minimization\n      of centralized points of control -- \"a feature that\
    \ is assumed to\n      make it easy for new users to join and new uses to unfold\"\
    \n      [Brown].  It also reduces issues surrounding single points of\n      failure\
    \ and distributes the network such that it continues to\n      function if one\
    \ or several nodes are disabled.  With the\n      commercialization of the Internet\
    \ in the early 1990s, there has\n      been a slow trend toward moving away from\
    \ decentralization, to the\n      detriment of any technical benefits that having\
    \ a decentralized\n      Internet otherwise provides.\n   Example:  The bits traveling\
    \ the Internet are increasingly\n      susceptible to monitoring and censorship,\
    \ from both governments\n      and ISPs, as well as third (malicious) parties.\
    \  The ability to\n      monitor and censor is further enabled by increased centralization\n\
    \      of the network, creating central infrastructure points that can be\n  \
    \    tapped into.  The creation of P2P networks and the development of\n     \
    \ voice-over-IP protocols using P2P technology in combination with a\n      distributed\

  - "6.2.14.  Reliability\n   Questions:\n   -  Is your protocol fault tolerant?\n\
    \   -  Does your protocol degrade gracefully?\n   -  Can your protocol resist\
    \ malicious degradation attempts?\n   -  Do you have a documented way to announce\
    \ degradation?\n   -  Do you have measures in place for recovery or partial healing\
    \ from\n      failure?\n   -  Can your protocol maintain dependability and performance\
    \ in the\n      face of unanticipated changes or circumstances?\n   Explanation:\
    \  Reliability ensures that a protocol will execute its\n      function consistently,\
    \ be error resistant as described, and\n      function without unexpected results.\
    \  A system that is reliable\n      degenerates gracefully and will have a documented\
    \ way to announce\n      degradation.  It also has mechanisms to recover from\
    \ failure\n      gracefully and, if applicable, to allow for partial healing.\
    \  It\n      is important here to draw a distinction between random degradation\n\
    \      and malicious degradation.  Many current attacks against TLS, for\n   \
    \   example, exploit TLS's ability to gracefully degrade to older\n      cipher\
    \ suites; from a functional perspective, this ability is\n      good, but from\
    \ a security perspective, it can be very bad.  As\n      with confidentiality,\
    \ the growth of the Internet and fostering\n      innovation in services depend\
    \ on users having confidence and trust\n      [RFC3724] in the network.  For reliability,\
    \ it is necessary that\n      services notify users if packet delivery fails.\
    \  In the case of\n      real-time systems, the protocol needs to safeguard timeliness\
    \ in\n      addition to providing reliable delivery.\n   Example:  In the modern\
    \ IP stack structure, a reliable transport\n      layer requires an indication\
    \ that transport processing has\n      successfully completed, such as the indication\
    \ given by TCP's ACK\n      message [RFC793] and not simply an indication from\
    \ the IP layer\n      that the packet arrived.  Similarly, an application-layer\
    \ protocol\n      may require an application-specific acknowledgement that contains,\n\
    \      among other things, a status code indicating the disposition of\n     \
    \ the request (see [RFC3724]).\n   Impacts:\n   -  Right to freedom of expression\n\

  contents:
  - "6.2.15.  Confidentiality\n   Questions:\n   -  Does this protocol expose information\
    \ related to identifiers or\n      data?  If so, does it do so to each of the\
    \ other protocol entities\n      (i.e., recipients, intermediaries, and enablers)\
    \ [RFC6973]?\n   -  What options exist for protocol implementers to choose to\

    \ controls are available to limit the information\n      shared with each entity?\n\
    \   -  What controls or consent mechanisms does the protocol define or\n     \
    \ require before personal data or identifiers are shared or exposed\n      via\
    \ the protocol?  If no such mechanisms or controls are\n      specified, is it\
    \ expected that control and consent will be handled\n      outside of the protocol?\n\
    \   -  Does the protocol provide ways for initiators to share different\n    \
    \  pieces of information with different recipients?  If not, are\n      there\

    \      mechanisms that exist outside of the protocol to provide users\n      with\
    \ such control?\n   -  Is it expected that users will have relationships that\
    \ govern the\n      use of the information (contractual or otherwise) with those\
    \ who\n      operate these intermediaries?\n   -  Does the protocol prefer encryption\

    \ to express\n      individuals' preferences to recipients or intermediaries with\n\
    \      regard to the collection, use, or disclosure of their personal\n      data?\n\
    \   Explanation:  \"Confidentiality\" refers to keeping a user's data\n      secret\
    \ from unintended listeners [BCP72].  The growth of the\n      Internet depends\
    \ on users having confidence that the network\n      protects their personal data\
    \ [RFC1984].\n   Example:  Protocols that do not encrypt their payload make the\
    \ entire\n      content of the communication available to the idealized attacker\n\
    \      along their path [RFC7624].  Following the advice in [RFC3365],\n     \
    \ most such protocols have a secure variant that encrypts the\n      payload for\
    \ confidentiality, and these secure variants are seeing\n      ever-wider deployment.\
    \  A noteworthy exception is DNS [RFC1035],\n      as DNSSEC [RFC4033] does not\
    \ have confidentiality as a\n      requirement.  This implies that, in the absence\
    \ of changes to the\n      protocol as presently under development in the IETF's\
    \ DNS Private\n      Exchange (DPRIVE) Working Group, all DNS queries and answers\n\
    \      generated by the activities of any protocol are available to the\n    \
    \  attacker.  When store-and-forward protocols are used (e.g., SMTP\n      [RFC5321]),\
    \ intermediaries leave this data subject to observation\n      by an attacker\
    \ that has compromised these intermediaries, unless\n      the data is encrypted\
    \ end to end by the application-layer protocol\n      or the implementation uses\
    \ an encrypted store for this data\n      [RFC7624].\n   Impacts:\n   -  Right\
