  - "Abstract\n   When transmitting an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination\n
    \  address, the IPv6 destination address is mapped to an Ethernet link-\n   layer
    multicast address.  This document clarifies that a mapping of\n   an IPv6 packet
    with a multicast destination address may in some\n   circumstances map to an Ethernet
    link-layer unicast address.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks\"
    ([RFC2464],\n   Section 7) specifies how an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination\n
    \  address is mapped into an Ethernet link-layer address.  This document\n   extends
    this mapping to explicitly allow for a mapping of an IPv6\n   packet with a multicast
    destination address into an Ethernet link-\n   layer unicast address, when it
    is clear that only one address is\n   relevant.\n   This mapping does not replace
    the mapping described in [RFC2464],\n   Section 7.  The determination of the unicast
    Ethernet link-layer\n   address and the construction of the outgoing IPv6 packet
    are out of\n   scope for this document.\n"
