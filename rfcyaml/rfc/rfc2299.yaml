    \         Option for PPP IPCP\nMobile IP [RFC 2002] defines media-independent\

    connections despite changing its point-of-attachment to the Internet and\nwithout\

    \ Mobile IP Foreign Agents which support\nMobile Node connections via PPP can\
    \ do so only by first assigning unique\naddresses to those Mobile Nodes, defeating\
