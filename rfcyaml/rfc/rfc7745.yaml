  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML)\
    \ schema for\n   reverse DNS management in a tightly controlled Representational\
    \ State\n   Transfer (REST) [REST] environment.  This document describes a schema\n\
    \   that has been developed and deployed by ICANN in a \"RESTful\" system\n  \
    \ since 2011 and is being used by the registries responsible for\n   reverse DNS\
    \ (rDNS) delegations underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA [RFC1034] and\n   IP6.ARPA [RFC3596]\
    \ through an HTTPS [RFC2818] transaction that is\n   mediated by an X.509 [RFC5280]\
    \ certificate.\n   As DNSSEC [RFC4033] adoption progresses, the necessity to interact\n\
    \   with a delegation in the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.APRA zones becomes more\n  \
    \ frequent given that updates to DS records in the parent zone for\n   child delegations\
    \ follow the key rollover and expiry of the child\n   zone.  The modification\
    \ of such critical areas at a relative high\n   frequency requires a system that\
    \ allows the administrative holders of\n   such delegations to make such changes\
    \ in a secure and trustworthy\n   manner where the chain of trust for submitting\
    \ the necessary\n   information remains unbroken between the IN-ADDR.ARPA and\
    \ IP6.APRA\n   zone maintainers and the zone customers.\n   At the request of\
    \ the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) to automate\n   reverse DNS updates\
    \ with ICANN, a REST-based HTTPS service was\n   deployed that:\n   o  Provides\
    \ for a secure, authenticated mechanism to update zone data\n      (NS and DS\
    \ records)\n   o  Provides a well-formed data structure for both the IN-ADDR.ARPA\n\
    \      and IP6.ARPA zones\n   o  Allows for \"out-of-band\" acknowledgement and\
    \ notification of\n      updates\n"

  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Implementation
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementation\n   The implemented system allows the entity responsible for\
    \ its rDNS\n   delegations to effect changes in the reverse DNS zones IN-ADDR.ARPA\n\
    \   and IP6.ARPA by submitting an XML document to an atomic RESTful\n   service\
    \ via an HTTPS [RFC2818] connection.  In this service, the\n   HTTPS layer provides\
    \ the end-to-end security of the transaction, and\n   it further provides authentication\
    \ by use of mandatory X.509\n   [RFC5280] client certificates with a known server\
    \ certificate issued\n   by a Certification Authority administered by the service\
    \ operator.\n   Certificates for use in this system, issued by the system operator,\n\
    \   are specific to the entity responsible for the delegations in the\n   zone.\n\
    \   Updates are made to the system by using the HTTP GET, PUT, and DELETE\n  \
    \ operations over HTTP 1.1 [RFC7231] via HTTPS [RFC2818] only.  These\n   operations\
    \ are sent to a resource Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n   in the form of:\n\
    \           https://host.example.org/<ipversion>/<zone>\n   A synthetic example\
    \ of an XML document submitted to the deployed\n   system might take the following\
    \ form (including all optional\n   attributes) as per the schema in Appendix A.\n\
    \   <zone xmlns=\"http://download.research.icann.org/rdns/1.1\"\n     name=\"\
    10.in-addr.arpa\" cust=\"IANA\" ipversion=\"ipv4\"\n     version=\"1.1\" modified=\"\
    2012-01-18T01:00:06\"\n     state=\"active\" href=\"https://host.example.org/ipv4/10\"\
    >\n     <nserver>\n       <fqdn>BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG.</fqdn>\n     </nserver>\n\
    \     <nserver>\n       <fqdn>BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG.</fqdn>\n     </nserver>\n\

    \    </ds>\n   </zone>\n   When PUT and DELETE operations are used, the well-formed\
    \ XML is\n   required to be sent with the appropriate content-length headers.\
    \  The\n   GET operation requires only the URI.\n   One requirement of the system\
    \ was to allow the separation of update\n   and approval with an out-of-band notification\
    \ mechanism.  When such\n   options are configured for a customer of the service,\
    \ submitted\n   updates may be queued for later approval.  When a customer has\
    \ queued\n   updates pending approval, the customer may submit a GET request to\n\
    \   retrieve either an individual entry or a full listing of all queued\n   entries.\n\
    \   To fetch a listing of the customer's queue, the customer would GET a\n   URI\
    \ in the form of:\n           https://host.example.org/queuelist\n   To fetch\
    \ an individual queue entry, the customer would GET the\n   canonical URL (as\
    \ per the schema) for this queue record:\n           https://host.example.org/queue/<identifier>\n\
    \   Where <identifier> is a system-generated and system-specific value\n   that\
    \ identifies this particular queue entry.  All XML returned from\n   queue-based\
    \ operations ('queue' and 'queuelist') would return an XML\n   document following\
    \ the specification in Appendix B.  A synthetic\n   example from a GET of 'queuelist'\
    \ would be:\n   <queuelist xmlns=\"http://download.research.icann.org/rq/1.0\"\
    \n    version=\"1.0\">\n    <queue xmlns=\"http://download.research.icann.org/rq/1.0\"\

    1.0\" submitted=\"2013-01-11T05:22:15\"\n     state=\"pending\" method=\"PUT\"\
    \n     ack=\"https://host.example.org/ack/25a531f50e5ba45\"\n     href=\"https://host.example.org/queue/25a531f50e5ba45\"\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document provides an XML schema for facilitating\
    \ the management\n   of reverse DNS delegations in the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.APRA\
    \ zones.\n   The schema itself contains no authentication data, and all other\n\
    \   information contained is considered public data as it is either\n   published\
    \ in DNS or propagated to other public information sources\n   like WHOIS.\n \
    \  The system that implements this XML schema requires HTTPS to be used\n   and\
    \ also uses known server and client X.509 certificates for\n   authentication\
    \ to protect against message modification, message\n   insertion/deletion, man-in-the-middle,\
    \ and replay attacks.  Any\n   DoS-type attack vectors and the authorisation of\
    \ which delegations\n   the X.509 certificate authentication sessions can affect\
    \ are out of\n   scope for this document.\n"
