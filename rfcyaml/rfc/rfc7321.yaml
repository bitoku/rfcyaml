  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] and the\n\
    \   Authentication Header (AH) [RFC4302] are the mechanisms for applying\n   cryptographic\
    \ protection to data being sent over an IPsec Security\n   Association (SA) [RFC4301].\n\
    \   To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is\n   necessary\
    \ to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.\n   This ensures that\
    \ there is at least one algorithm that all\n   implementations will have in common.\
    \  This document specifies the\n   current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms\
    \ for ESP and AH,\n   specifies algorithms that should be implemented because\
    \ they may be\n   promoted to mandatory at some future time, and also recommends\n\
    \   against the implementation of some obsolete algorithms.  Usage\n   guidance\
    \ is also provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve\n   their security\
    \ goals through appropriate choices of mechanisms.\n   The nature of cryptography\
    \ is that new algorithms surface\n   continuously and existing algorithms are\
    \ continuously attacked.  An\n   algorithm believed to be strong today may be\
    \ demonstrated to be weak\n   tomorrow.  Given this, the choice of mandatory-to-implement\
    \ algorithm\n   should be conservative so as to minimize the likelihood of it\
    \ being\n   compromised quickly.  Thought should also be given to performance\n\
    \   considerations, as many uses of IPsec will be in environments where\n   performance\
    \ is a concern.\n   The ESP and AH mandatory-to-implement algorithm(s) may need\
    \ to change\n   over time to adapt to new developments in cryptography.  For this\n\
    \   reason, the specification of the mandatory-to-implement algorithms is\n  \
    \ not included in the main IPsec, ESP, or AH specifications, but is\n   instead\
    \ placed in this document.  Ideally, the mandatory-to-implement\n   algorithm\
    \ of tomorrow should already be available in most\n   implementations of IPsec\
    \ by the time it is made mandatory.  To\n   facilitate this, this document identifies\
    \ such algorithms, as they\n   are known today.  There is no guarantee that the\
    \ algorithms that we\n   predict will be mandatory in the future will actually\
    \ be so.  All\n   algorithms known today are subject to cryptographic attack and\
    \ may be\n   broken in the future.\n"

- title: 3.  Usage Guidance
  contents:
  - "3.  Usage Guidance\n   Since ESP and AH can be used in several different ways,\
    \ this document\n   provides guidance on the best way to utilize these mechanisms.\n\
    \   ESP can provide confidentiality, data origin authentication, or the\n   combination\
    \ of both of those security services.  AH provides only\n   data origin authentication.\
    \  Background information on those security\n   services is available [RFC4949].\
    \  In the following, we shorten \"data\n   origin authentication\" to \"authentication\"\
    .\n   Providing both confidentiality and authentication offers the best\n   security.\
    \  If confidentiality is not needed, providing authentication\n   can still be\
    \ useful.  Confidentiality without authentication is not\n   effective [DP07]\
    \ and therefore SHOULD NOT be used.  We describe each\n   of these cases in more\
    \ detail below.\n   To provide both confidentiality and authentication, an authenticated\n\
    \   encryption transform from Section 2.1 SHOULD be used in ESP, in\n   conjunction\
    \ with NULL authentication.  Alternatively, an ESP\n   encryption transform and\
    \ ESP authentication transform MAY be used\n   together.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED\
    \ to use ESP with NULL authentication\n   in conjunction with AH; some configurations\
    \ of this combination of\n   services have been shown to be insecure [PD10].\n\
    \   To provide authentication without confidentiality, an authentication\n   transform\
    \ MUST be used in either ESP or AH.  The IPsec community\n   generally prefers\
    \ ESP with NULL encryption over AH.  AH is still\n   required in some protocols\
    \ and operational environments when there\n   are security-sensitive options in\
    \ the IP header, such as source\n   routing headers; ESP inherently cannot protect\
    \ those IP options.  It\n   is not possible to provide effective confidentiality\
    \ without\n   authentication, because the lack of authentication undermines the\n\
    \   trustworthiness of encryption [B96][V02].  Therefore, an encryption\n   transform\
    \ MUST NOT be used with a NULL authentication transform\n   (unless the encryption\
    \ transform is an authenticated encryption\n   transform from Section 2.1).\n\
    \   Triple-DES SHOULD NOT be used in any scenario in which multiple\n   gigabytes\
    \ of data will be encrypted with a single key.  As a 64-bit\n   block cipher,\
    \ it leaks information about plaintexts above that\n   \"birthday bound\" [M13].\
    \  Triple-DES CBC is listed as a MAY implement\n   for the sake of backwards compatibility,\
    \ but its use is discouraged.\n"
- title: 4.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "4.  Rationale\n   This section explains the principles behind the implementation\n\
    \   requirements described above.\n   The algorithms listed as \"MAY implement\"\
    \ are not meant to be endorsed\n   over other non-standard alternatives.  All\
    \ of the algorithms that\n   appeared in [RFC4835] are included in this document,\
    \ for the sake of\n   continuity.  In some cases, these algorithms have moved\
    \ from being\n   \"SHOULD implement\" to \"MAY implement\".\n"
- title: 4.1.  Authenticated Encryption
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Authenticated Encryption\n   This document encourages the use of authenticated\
    \ encryption\n   algorithms because they can provide significant efficiency and\n\
    \   throughput advantages, and the tight binding between authentication\n   and\
    \ encryption can be a security advantage [RFC5116].\n   AES-GCM [RFC4106] brings\
    \ significant performance benefits [KKGEGD],\n   has been incorporated into IPsec\
    \ recommendations [RFC6379], and has\n   emerged as the preferred authenticated\
    \ encryption method in IPsec and\n   other standards.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Encryption Transforms
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Encryption Transforms\n   Since ESP encryption is optional, support for\
    \ the \"NULL\" algorithm is\n   required to maintain consistency with the way\
    \ services are\n   negotiated.  Note that while authentication and encryption\
    \ can each\n   be \"NULL\", they MUST NOT both be \"NULL\" [RFC4301] [H10].\n\
    \   AES Counter Mode (AES-CTR) is an efficient encryption method, but it\n   provides\
    \ no authentication capability.  The AES-GCM authenticated\n   encryption method\
    \ has all of the advantages of AES-CTR, while also\n   providing authentication.\
    \  Thus, this document moves AES-CTR from a\n   SHOULD to a MAY.\n   The Triple\
    \ Data Encryption Standard (TDES) is obsolete because of its\n   small block size;\
    \ as with all 64-bit block ciphers, it SHOULD NOT be\n   used to encrypt more\
    \ than one gigabyte of data with a single key\n   [M13].  Its key size is smaller\
    \ than that of the Advanced Encryption\n   Standard (AES), while at the same time\
    \ its performance and efficiency\n   are worse.  Thus, its use in new implementations\
    \ is discouraged.\n   The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is obsolete because of\
    \ its small\n   key size and small block size.  There have been publicly demonstrated\n\
    \   and open-design special-purpose cracking hardware.  Therefore, its\n   use\
    \ is has been changed to MUST NOT in this document.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Authentication Transforms
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Authentication Transforms\n   AES-GMAC provides good security along with\
    \ performance advantages,\n   even over HMAC-MD5.  In addition, it uses the same\
    \ internal\n   components as AES-GCM and is easy to implement in a way that shares\n\
    \   components with that authenticated encryption algorithm.\n   The MD5 hash\
    \ function has been found to not meet its goal of\n   collision resistance; it\
    \ is so weak that its use in digital\n   signatures is highly discouraged [RFC6151].\
    \  There have been\n   theoretical results against HMAC-MD5, but that message\
    \ authentication\n   code does not seem to have a practical vulnerability.  Thus,\
    \ it may\n   not be urgent to remove HMAC-MD5 from the existing protocols.\n \
    \  SHA-1 has been found to not meet its goal of collision resistance.\n   However,\
    \ HMAC-SHA-1 does not rely on this property, and HMAC-SHA-1 is\n   believed to\
    \ be secure.\n   HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512 are believed to\
    \ provide\n   a good security margin, and they perform adequately on many\n  \
    \ platforms.  However, these algorithms are not recommended for\n   implementation\
    \ in this document, because HMAC-SHA-1 support is\n   widespread and its security\
    \ is good, AES-GMAC provides good security\n   with better performance, and Authenticated\
    \ Encryption algorithms do\n   not need any authentication methods.\n   AES-XCBC\
    \ has not seen widespread deployment, despite being previously\n   recommended\
    \ as a SHOULD+ in RFC 4835.  Thus, this document lists it\n   only as a SHOULD.\n"
- title: 5.  Algorithm Diversity
  contents:
  - "5.  Algorithm Diversity\n   When the AES cipher was first adopted, it was decided\
    \ to continue\n   encouraging the implementation of Triple-DES, in order to provide\n\
    \   algorithm diversity.  But the passage of time has eroded the\n   viability\
    \ of Triple-DES as an alternative to AES.  As it is a 64-bit\n   block cipher,\
    \ its security is inadequate at high data rates (see\n   Section 4.2).  Its performance\
    \ in software and Field-Programmable\n   Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is considerably worse\
    \ than that of AES.  Since it\n   would not be possible to use Triple-DES as an\
    \ alternative to AES in\n   high data rate environments, or in environments where\
    \ its performance\n   could not keep up the requirements, the rationale of retaining\n\
    \   Triple-DES to provide algorithm diversity is disappearing.  (Of\n   course,\
    \ this does not change the rationale of retaining Triple-DES in\n   IPsec implementations\
    \ for backwards compatibility.)\n   Recent discussions in the IETF have started\
    \ considering how to make\n   the selection of a different cipher that could provide\
    \ algorithm\n   diversity in IPsec and other IETF standards.  That work is expected\n\
    \   to take a long time and involve discussions among many participants\n   and\
    \ organizations.\n   It is important to bear in mind that it is very unlikely\
    \ that an\n   exploitable flaw will be found in AES (e.g., a flaw that required\n\
    \   less than a terabyte of known plaintext, when AES is used in a\n   conventional\
    \ mode of operation).  The only reason that algorithm\n   diversity deserves any\
    \ consideration is because there would be large\n   problems if such a flaw were\
    \ found.\n"
