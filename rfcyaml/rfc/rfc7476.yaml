  - "1.  Introduction\n   Information-centric networking (ICN) marks a fundamental\
    \ shift in\n   communications and networking.  In contrast with the omnipresent\
    \ and\n   very successful host-centric paradigm, which is based on perpetual\n\
    \   connectivity and the end-to-end principle, ICN changes the focal\n   point\
    \ of the network architecture from the end host to \"named\n   information\" (or\
    \ content, or data).  In this paradigm, connectivity\n   may well be intermittent.\
    \  End-host and in-network storage can be\n   capitalized upon transparently,\
    \ as bits in the network and on storage\n   devices have exactly the same value.\
    \  Mobility and multiaccess are\n   the norm, and anycast, multicast, and broadcast\
    \ are natively\n   supported.\n   It is also worth noting that with the transition\
    \ from a host-centric\n   to an information-centric communication model the security\
    \ paradigm\n   changes as well.  In a host-centric network, the basic idea is\
    \ to\n   create secure (remote-access) tunnels to trusted providers of data.\n\
    \   In an information-centric network, on the other hand, any source\n   (cache)\
    \ should be equally usable.  This requires some mechanism for\n   making each\
    \ information item trustworthy by itself; this can be\n   achieved, for example,\
    \ by name-data integrity or by signing data\n   objects.\n   Although interest\
    \ in ICN is growing rapidly, ongoing work on\n   different architectures, such\
    \ as NetInf [NetInf], the original\n   Content-Centric Networking [CCN], and its\
    \ successors, Project CCNx\n   [CCNx] and Named Data Networking (NDN) [NDNP],\
    \ the Publish-Subscribe\n   Internet (PSI) architecture [PSI], and the Data-Oriented\
    \ Network\n   Architecture [DONA] is far from being completed.  One could think\
    \ of\n   ICN today as being at a stage of development similar to that of\n   packet-switched\
    \ networking in the late 1970s when different\n   technologies, e.g., DECnet,\
    \ Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), and\n   IP, just to name a few, were being\
    \ actively developed and put to the\n   test.  As such, ICN's current development\
    \ phase and the plethora of\n   approaches to tackle the hardest problems make\
    \ this a very active and\n   growing research area, but, on the downside, it also\
    \ makes it more\n   difficult to compare different proposals on an equal footing.\
    \  This\n   document aims to partially address this by establishing a common\n\
    \   understanding about potential experimental setups where different ICN\n  \
    \ approaches can be tested and compared against each other while\n   showcasing\
    \ their advantages.\n   The first draft version of this document appeared in November\
    \ 2012.\n   It was adopted by ICNRG at IETF 87 (July 2013) as the document to\n\
    \   address the work item on the definition of \"reference baseline\n   scenarios\
    \ to enable performance comparisons between different\n   approaches\".  Earlier\
    \ draft versions of this document have been\n   presented during the ICNRG meetings\
    \ at IETF 85, IETF 86, IETF 87,\n   IETF 88, IETF 89, and the ICNRG interim meeting\
    \ in Stockholm in\n   February 2013.  This document has been reviewed, commented,\
    \ and\n   discussed extensively for a period of nearly two years by the vast\n\
    \   majority of ICNRG members, which certainly exceeds 100 individuals.\n   It\
    \ is the consensus of ICNRG that the baseline scenarios described in\n   this\
    \ document should be published in the IRTF Stream of the RFC\n   series.  This\
    \ document does not constitute a standard.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Baseline Scenario Selection
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Baseline Scenario Selection\n   Earlier surveys [SoA1] [SoA2] note that\
    \ describing ICN architectures\n   is akin to shooting a moving target.  We find\
    \ that comparing these\n   different approaches is often even more tricky.  It\
    \ is not uncommon\n   that researchers devise different performance evaluation\
    \ scenarios,\n   typically with good reason, in order to highlight the advantages\
    \ of\n   their approach.  This should be expected to some degree at this early\n\
    \   stage of ICN development.  Nevertheless, this document shows that\n   certain\
    \ baseline scenarios seem to emerge in which ICN architectures\n   could showcase\
    \ their comparative advantages over current systems, in\n   general, and against\
    \ each other, in particular.\n   This document surveys the peer-reviewed ICN literature\
    \ and presents\n   prominent evaluation study cases as a foundation for the baseline\n\
    \   scenarios to be considered by the IRTF Information-Centric Networking\n  \
    \ Research Group (ICNRG) in its future work.  There are two goals for\n   this\
    \ document: first, to provide a set of use cases and applications\n   that highlight\
    \ opportunities for testing different ICN proposals;\n   second, to identify key\
    \ attributes of a common set of techniques that\n   can be instrumental in evaluating\
    \ ICN.  Further, these scenarios are\n   intended to equip researchers with sufficient\
    \ configuration data to\n   effectively evaluate their ICN proposals in a variety\
    \ of settings,\n   particularly extending beyond scenarios focusing simply on\n\
    \   traditional content delivery.  The overall aim is that each scenario\n   is\
    \ described at a sufficient level of detail, and with adequate\n   references\
    \ to already published work, so that it can serve as the\n   base for comparative\
    \ evaluations of different approaches.  Example\n   code that implements some\
    \ of the scenarios and topologies included in\n   this document is available from\n\
    \   <http://telematics.poliba.it/icn-baseline-scenarios>.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Document Goals and Outline
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Document Goals and Outline\n   This document incorporates input from ICNRG\
    \ participants and their\n   corresponding text contributions, has been reviewed\
    \ by several ICNRG\n   active participants (see Section 7), and represents the\
    \ consensus of\n   the research group.  However, this document does not constitute\
    \ an\n   IETF standard, but is an Informational document; see also [RFC5743].\n\
    \   As mentioned above, these scenarios are intended to provide a\n   framework\
    \ for evaluating different ICN approaches.  The methodology\n   for how to do\
    \ these evaluations as well as definitions of metrics\n   that should be used\
    \ are described in a separate document\n   [EVAL-METHOD].  In addition, interested\
    \ readers should consider\n   reviewing [CHALLENGES].\n   The remainder of this\
    \ document presents a number of scenarios grouped\n   into several categories\
    \ in Section 2, followed by a number of cross-\n   scenario considerations in\
    \ Section 3.  Overall, note that certain\n   evaluation scenarios span across\
    \ these categories, so the boundaries\n   between them should not be considered\
    \ rigid and inflexible.\n   Section 4 summarizes the main evaluation aspects across\
    \ the range of\n   scenarios discussed in this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Scenarios
  contents:
  - "2.  Scenarios\n   This section presents nine scenario categories based on use\
    \ cases and\n   evaluations that have appeared in the peer-reviewed literature.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Social Networking
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Social Networking\n   Social-networking applications have proliferated\
    \ over the past decade\n   based on overlay content dissemination systems that\
    \ require large\n   infrastructure investments to roll out and maintain.  Content\n\
    \   dissemination is at the heart of the ICN paradigm.  Therefore, we\n   would\
    \ expect that social-networking scenarios are a \"natural fit\" for\n   comparing\
    \ ICN performance with traditional client-server TCP/IP-based\n   systems.  Mathieu\
    \ et al. [ICN-SN], for instance, illustrate how an\n   Internet Service Provider\
    \ (ISP) can capitalize on CCN to deploy a\n   short-message service akin to Twitter\
    \ at a fraction of the complexity\n   of today's systems.  Their key observation\
    \ is that such a service can\n   be seen as a combination of multicast delivery\
    \ and caching.  That is,\n   a single user addresses a large number of recipients,\
    \ some of which\n   receive the new message immediately as they are online at\
    \ that\n   instant, while others receive the message whenever they connect to\n\
    \   the network.\n   Along similar lines, Kim et al. [VPC] present an ICN-based\
    \ social-\n   networking platform in which a user shares content with her/his\n\
    \   family and friends without the need for centralized content servers;\n   see\
    \ also Section 2.4, below, and [CBIS].  Based on the CCN naming\n   scheme, [VPC]\
    \ takes a user name to represent a set of devices that\n   belong to the person.\
    \  Other users in this in-network, serverless\n   social sharing scenario can\
    \ access the user's content not via a\n   device name/address but with the user's\
    \ name.  In [VPC], signature\n   verification does not require any centralized\
    \ authentication server.\n   Kim and Lee [VPC2] present a proof-of-concept evaluation\
    \ in which\n   users with ordinary smartphones can browse a list of members or\n\
    \   content using a name, and download the content selected from the\n   list.\n\
    \   In other words, the above-mentioned evaluation studies indicate that\n   with\
    \ ICN there may be no need for an end-to-end system design that\n   intermediates\
    \ between content providers and consumers in a hub-and-\n   spoke fashion at all\
    \ times.\n   Earlier work by Arianfar et al. [CCR] considers a similar pull-based\n\
    \   content retrieval scenario using a different architecture, pointing\n   to\
    \ significant performance advantages.  Although the authors consider\n   a network\
    \ topology (redrawn in Figure 1 for convenience) that has\n   certain interesting\
    \ characteristics, they do not explicitly address\n   social networking in their\
    \ evaluation scenario.  Nonetheless,\n   similarities are easy to spot: \"followers\"\
    \ (such as C0, C1, ..., and\n   Cz in Figure 1) obtain content put \"on the network\"\
    \ (I1, ..., Im, and\n   B1, B2) by a single user (e.g., Px) relying solely on\
    \ network\n   primitives.\n   \\--/\n   |C0|\n   /--\\     +--+     +--+     +--+\

- title: 2.2.  Real-Time Communication
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Real-Time Communication\n   Real-time audio and video (A/V) communications\
    \ include an array of\n   services ranging from one-to-one voice calls to multiparty\
    \ multimedia\n   conferences with support ranging from whiteboards to augmented\n\
    \   reality.  Real-time communications have been studied and deployed in\n   the\
    \ context of packet- and circuit-switched networks for decades.\n   The stringent\
    \ Quality of Service (QoS) requirements that this type of\n   communication imposes\
    \ on network infrastructure are well known.\n   Since one could argue that network\
    \ primitives that are excellent for\n   information dissemination are not well-suited\
    \ for conversational\n   services, ICN evaluation studies should consider real-time\n\
    \   communication scenarios in detail.\n   Notably, Jacobson et al. [VoCCN] presented\
    \ an early evaluation where\n   the performance of a VoIP (Voice over IP) call\
    \ using an information-\n   centric approach was compared with that of an off-the-shelf\
    \ VoIP\n   implementation using RTP/UDP.  The results indicated that despite the\n\
    \   extra cost of adding security support in the ICN approach,\n   performance\
    \ was virtually identical in the two cases evaluated in\n   their testbed.  However,\
    \ the experimental setup presented is quite\n   rudimentary, while the evaluation\
    \ considered a single voice call\n   only.  Xuan and Yan [NDNpb] revisit the same\
    \ scenario but are\n   primarily interested in reducing the overhead that may\
    \ arise in one-\n   to-one communication employing an ICN architecture.  Both\
    \ studies\n   illustrate that quality telephony services are feasible with at\
    \ least\n   one ICN approach.  That said, future ICN evaluations should employ\n\
    \   standardized call arrival patterns, for example, following well-\n   established\
    \ methodologies from the QoS and QoE (Quality of\n   Experience) evaluation toolbox\
    \ and would need to consider more\n   comprehensive metrics.\n   Given the widespread\
    \ deployment of real-time A/V communications, an\n   evaluation of an ICN system\
    \ should demonstrate capabilities beyond\n   feasibility.  For example, with respect\
    \ to multimedia conferencing,\n   Zhu et al. [ACT] describe the design of a distributed\
    \ audio\n   conference tool based on NDN.  Their system includes ICN-based\n \
    \  conference discovery, speaker discovery, and voice data distribution.\n   The\
    \ reported evaluation results point to gains in scalability and\n   security.\
    \  Moreover, Chen et al. [G-COPSS] explore the feasibility of\n   implementing\
    \ a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game\n   (MMORPG) based on CCNx\
    \ code and show that stringent temporal\n   requirements can be met, while scalability\
    \ is significantly improved\n   when compared to a host-centric (IP-based) client-server\
    \ system.\n   This type of work points to benefits for both the data and control\n\
    \   path of a modern network infrastructure.\n   Real-time communication also\
    \ brings up the issue of named data\n   granularity for dynamically generated\
    \ content.  In many cases, A/V\n   data is generated in real-time and is distributed\
    \ immediately.  One\n   possibility is to apply a single name to the entire content,\
    \ but this\n   could result in significant distribution delays.  Alternatively,\n\
    \   distributing A/V content in smaller \"chunks\" that are named\n   individually\
    \ may be a better option with respect to real-time\n   distribution but raises\
    \ naming scalability concerns.\n   We observe that, all in all, the ICN research\
    \ community has hitherto\n   only scratched the surface of illustrating the benefits\
    \ of adopting\n   an information-centric approach as opposed to a host-centric\
    \ one, and\n   thus more work is recommended in this direction.  Scenarios in\
    \ this\n   category should illustrate not only feasibility but reduced\n   complexity,\
    \ increased scalability, reliability, and capacity to meet\n   stringent QoS/QoE\
    \ requirements when compared to established host-\n   centric solutions.  Accordingly,\
    \ the primary aim of this scenario is\n   to exercise each ICN architecture in\
    \ terms of its ability to satisfy\n   real-time QoS requirements and provide improved\
    \ user experience.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Mobile Networking
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Mobile Networking\n   IP mobility management relies on anchors to provide\
    \ ubiquitous\n   connectivity to end-hosts as well as moving networks [MMIN].\
    \  This is\n   a natural choice for a host-centric paradigm that requires end-to-end\n\
    \   connectivity and a continuous network presence for hosts [SCES].  An\n   implicit\
    \ assumption in host-centric mobility management is therefore\n   that the mobile\
    \ node aims to connect to a particular peer, as well as\n   to maintain global\
    \ reachability and service continuity [EEMN].\n   However, with ICN, new ideas\
    \ about mobility management should come to\n   the fore, capitalizing on the different\
    \ nature of the paradigm, such\n   as native support for multihoming, abstraction\
    \ of network addresses\n   from applications, less dependence on connection-oriented\
    \ sessions,\n   and so on [MOBSURV].\n   Dannewitz et al. [N-Scen] illustrate\
    \ a scenario where a multiaccess\n   end-host can retrieve email securely using\
    \ a combination of cellular\n   and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity.\
    \  This scenario\n   borrows elements from previous work, e.g., [DTI], and develops\
    \ them\n   further with respect to multiaccess.  Unfortunately, Dannewitz et al.\n\
    \   [N-Scen] do not present any results demonstrating that an ICN\n   approach\
    \ is, indeed, better.  That said, the scenario is interesting\n   as it considers\
    \ content specific to a single user (i.e., her mailbox)\n   and does point to\
    \ reduced complexity.  It is also compatible with\n   recent work in the Distributed\
    \ Mobility Management (DMM) Working\n   Group within the IETF.  Finally, Xylomenos\
    \ et al. [PSIMob] as well as\n   Pentikousis [EEMN] argue that an information-centric\
    \ architecture can\n   avoid the complexity of having to manage tunnels to maintain\
    \ end-to-\n   end connectivity as is the case with mobile anchor-based protocols\n\
    \   such as Mobile IP (and its variants).  Similar considerations hold\n   for\
    \ a vehicular (networking) environment, as we discuss in Section\n   2.6.\n  \
    \ Overall, mobile networking scenarios have not been developed in\n   detail,\
    \ let alone evaluated at a large scale.  Further, the majority\n   of scenarios\
    \ discussed so far have related to the mobility of the\n   information consumer,\
    \ rather than the source.  We expect that in the\n   coming period more papers\
    \ will address this topic.  Earlier work\n   [mNetInf] argues that for mobile\
    \ and multiaccess networking scenarios\n   we need to go beyond the current mobility\
    \ management mechanisms in\n   order to capitalize on the core ICN features. \
    \ They present a testbed\n   setup (redrawn in Figure 2) that can serve as the\
    \ basis for other ICN\n   evaluations.  In this scenario, node \"C0\" has multiple\
    \ network\n   interfaces that can access local domains N0 and N1 simultaneously,\n\
    \   allowing C0 to retrieve objects from whichever server (I2 or I3) can\n   supply\
    \ them without necessarily needing to access the servers in the\n   core network\
    \ \"C\" (P1 and P2).  Lindgren [HybICN] explores this\n   scenario further for\
    \ an urban setting.  He uses simulation and\n   reports sizable gains in terms\
    \ of reduction of object retrieval times\n   and core network capacity use.\n\

    \   The benefits from capitalizing on the broadcast nature of wireless\n   access\
    \ technologies has yet to be explored to its full potential in\n   the ICN literature,\
    \ including quantifying possible gains in terms of\n   energy efficiency [E-CHANET].\
    \  Obviously, ICN architectures must\n   avoid broadcast storms.  Early work in\
    \ this area considers\n   distributed packet suppression techniques that exploit\
    \ delayed\n   transmissions and overhearing; examples can be found in [MobiA]\
    \ and\n   [CCNMANET] for ICN-based mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), and in\n \
    \  [RTIND] and [CCNVANET] for vehicular scenarios.\n   One would expect that mobile\
    \ networking scenarios will be naturally\n   coupled with those discussed in the\
    \ previous sections, as more users\n   access social-networking and multimedia\
    \ applications through mobile\n   devices.  Further, the constraints of real-time\
    \ A/V applications\n   create interesting challenges in handling mobility, particularly\
    \ in\n   terms of maintaining service continuity.  This scenario therefore\n \
    \  spans across most of the others considered in this document with the\n   likely\
    \ need for some level of integration, particularly considering\n   the well-documented\
    \ increases in mobile traffic.  Mobility is further\n   considered in Section\
    \ 2.7 and the economic consequences of nodes\n   having multiple network interfaces\
    \ is explored in Section 3.1.\n   Host-centric mobility management has traditionally\
    \ used a range of\n   metrics for evaluating performance on a per-node and network-wide\n\
    \   level.  The first metric that comes to mind is handover latency,\n   defined\
    \ in [RFC5568] as the \"period during which the mobile node is\n   unable to send\
    \ or receive packets\".  This metric should be considered\n   in ICN performance\
    \ evaluation studies dealing with mobility.  Note\n   that, in IP-based networks,\
    \ handover latency has been addressed by\n   the introduction of mobility management\
    \ protocols that aim to hide\n   node mobility from the correspondent node, and\
    \ often follow a make-\n   before-break approach in order to ensure seamless connectivity\
    \ and\n   minimize (or eliminate altogether) handover latency.  The \"always-on\"\
    \n   and \"always best connected\" [ABC] paradigms have guided mobility\n   management\
    \ research and standardization for a good decade or so.  One\n   can argue that\
    \ such mechanisms are not particularly suited for ICN.\n   That said, there has\
    \ been a lot of interest recently in distributed\n   mobility management schemes\
    \ (see [MMIN] for a summary), where\n   mobility management support is not \"\
    always on\" by default.  Such\n   schemes may be more suitable for ICN.  As a\
    \ general recommendation,\n   ICN designs should aim to minimize handover latency\
    \ so that the end-\n   user and service QoE is not affected adversely.\n   Network\
    \ overhead, such as the amount of signaling necessary to\n   minimize handover\
    \ latency, is also a metric that should be considered\n   when studying ICN mobility\
    \ management.  In the past, network overhead\n   has been seen as one of the main\
    \ factors hindering the deployment of\n   various mobility solutions.  In IP-based\
    \ networks, network overhead\n   includes, but is not limited to, tunneling overhead,\
    \ in-band control\n   protocol overhead, mobile terminal and network equipment\
    \ state\n   maintenance and update.  ICN designs and evaluation studies should\n\
    \   clearly identify the network overhead associated with handling\n   mobility.\
    \  Alongside network overhead, deployment complexity should\n   also be studied.\n\
    \   To summarize, mobile networking scenarios should aim to provide\n   service\
    \ continuity for those applications that require it, decrease\n   complexity and\
    \ control signaling for the network infrastructure, as\n   well as increase wireless\
    \ capacity utilization by taking advantage of\n   the broadcast nature of the\
    \ medium.  Beyond this, mobile networking\n   scenarios should form a cross-scenario\
    \ platform that can highlight\n   how other scenarios can still maintain their\
    \ respective performance\n   metrics during periods of high mobility.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Infrastructure Sharing
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Infrastructure Sharing\n   A key idea in ICN is that the network should\
    \ secure information\n   objects per se, not the communications channel that they\
    \ are\n   delivered over.  This means that hosts attached to an information-\n\
    \   centric network can share resources on an unprecedented scale,\n   especially\
    \ when compared to what is possible in an IP network.  All\n   devices with network\
    \ access and storage capacity can contribute their\n   resources thereby increasing\
    \ the value of an information-centric\n   network, although compensation schemes\
    \ motivating users to contribute\n   resources remain a research challenge primarily\
    \ from a business\n   perspective.\n   For example, Jacobson et al. [CBIS] argue\
    \ that in ICN the \"where and\n   how\" of obtaining information are new degrees\
    \ of freedom.  They\n   illustrate this with a scenario involving a photo-sharing\
    \ application\n   that takes advantage of whichever access network connectivity\
    \ is\n   available at the moment (WLAN, Bluetooth, and even SMS) without\n   requiring\
    \ a centralized infrastructure to synchronize between\n   numerous devices.  It\
    \ is important to highlight that since the focus\n   of communication changes,\
    \ keep-alives in this scenario are simply\n   unnecessary, as devices participating\
    \ in the testbed network\n   contribute resources in order to maintain user content\
    \ consistency,\n   not link state information as is the case in the host-centric\n\
    \   paradigm.  This means that the notion of \"infrastructure\" may be\n   completely\
    \ different in the future.\n   Muscariello et al. [SHARE], for instance, presented\
    \ early work on an\n   analytical framework that attempts to capture the storage/bandwidth\n\
    \   tradeoffs that ICN enables and can be used as the foundation for a\n   network\
    \ planning tool.  In addition, Chai et al. [CL4M] explore the\n   benefits of\
    \ ubiquitous caching throughout an information-centric\n   network and argue that\
    \ \"caching less can actually achieve more.\"\n   These papers also sit alongside\
    \ a variety of other studies that look\n   at various scenarios such as caching\
    \ HTTP-like traffic [CCNCT] and\n   BitTorrent-like traffic [BTCACHE].  We observe\
    \ that much more work is\n   needed in order to understand how to make optimal\
    \ use of all\n   resources available in an information-centric network.  In real-world\n\
    \   deployments, policy and commercial considerations are also likely to\n   affect\
    \ the use of particular resources, and more work is expected in\n   this direction\
    \ as well.\n   In conclusion, scenarios in this category would cover the\n   communication-computation-storage\
    \ tradeoffs that an ICN deployment\n   must consider.  This would exercise features\
    \ relating to network\n   planning, perhaps capitalizing on user-provided resources,\
    \ as well as\n   operational and economical aspects of ICN, and contrast them\
    \ with\n   other approaches.  An obvious baseline to compare against in this\n\
    \   regard is existing federations of IP-based Content Distribution\n   Networks\
    \ (CDNs), such as the ones discussed in the IETF Content\n   Delivery Networks\
    \ Interconnection Working Group.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Content Dissemination
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Content Dissemination\n   Content dissemination has attracted more attention\
    \ than other aspects\n   of ICN.  Scenarios in this category abound in the literature,\n\
    \   including stored and streaming A/V distribution, file distribution,\n   mirroring\
    \ and bulk transfers, versioned content services (cf.\n   Subversion-type revision\
    \ control), as well as traffic aggregation.\n   Decentralized content dissemination\
    \ with on-the-fly aggregation of\n   information sources was envisaged in [N-Scen],\
    \ where information\n   objects can be dynamically assembled based on hierarchically\n\
    \   structured subcomponents.  For example, a video stream could be\n   associated\
    \ with different audio streams and subtitle sets, which can\n   all be obtained\
    \ from different sources.  Using the topology depicted\n   in Figure 1 as an example,\
    \ an application at C1 may end up obtaining,\n   say, the video content from I1,\
    \ but the user-selected subtitles from\n   Px.  Semantics and content negotiation,\
    \ on behalf of the user, were\n   also considered, e.g., for the case of popular\
    \ tunes that may be\n   available in different encoding formats.  Effectively,\
    \ this scenario\n   has the information consumer issuing independent requests\
    \ for content\n   based on information identifiers, and stitching the pieces together\n\
    \   irrespective of \"where\" or \"how\" they were obtained.\n   A case in point\
    \ for content dissemination are vehicular ad hoc\n   networks (VANETs), as an\
    \ ICN approach may address their needs for\n   information dissemination between\
    \ vehicles better than today's\n   solutions, as discussed in the following section.\
    \  The critical part\n   of information dissemination in a VANET scenario revolves\
    \ around\n   \"where\" and \"when\".  For instance, one may be interested in traffic\n\
    \   conditions 2 km ahead while having no interest in similar information\n  \
    \ about the area around the path origin.  VANET scenarios may provide\n   fertile\
    \ ground for showcasing the ICN advantage with respect to\n   content dissemination\
    \ especially when compared with current host-\n   centric approaches.  That said,\
    \ information integrity and filtering\n   are challenges that must be addressed.\
    \  As mentioned above, content\n   dissemination scenarios in VANETs have a particular\
    \ affinity to the\n   mobility scenarios discussed in Section 2.3.\n   Content\
    \ dissemination scenarios, in general, have a large overlap\n   with those described\
    \ in the previous sections and are explored in\n   several papers, such as [DONA],\
    \ [PSI], [PSIMob], [NetInf], [CCN],\n   [CBIS], and [CCR], just to name a few.\
    \  In addition, Chai et al.\n   [CURLING] present a hop-by-hop hierarchical content\
    \ resolution\n   approach that employs receiver-driven multicast over multiple\n\
    \   domains, advocating another content dissemination approach.  Yet,\n   largely,\
    \ work in this area did not address the issue of access\n   authorization in detail.\
    \  Often, the distributed content is mostly\n   assumed to be freely accessible\
    \ by any consumer.  Distribution of\n   paid-for or otherwise restricted content\
    \ on a public ICN network\n   requires more attention in the future.  Fotiou et\
    \ al. [ACDICN]\n   consider a scheme to this effect, but it still requires access\
    \ to an\n   authorization server to verify the user's status after the\n   (encrypted)\
    \ content has been obtained.  This may effectively negate\n   the advantage of\
    \ obtaining the content from any node, especially in a\n   disruption-prone or\
    \ mobile network.\n   In summary, scenarios in this category aim to exercise primarily\n\
    \   scalability and the cost and performance attributes of content\n   dissemination.\
    \  Particularly, they should highlight the ability of an\n   ICN to scale to billions\
    \ of objects, while not exceeding the cost of\n   existing content dissemination\
    \ solutions (i.e., CDNs) and, ideally,\n   increasing performance.  These should\
    \ be shown in a holistic manner,\n   improving content dissemination for both\
    \ information consumers and\n   publishers of all sizes.  We expect that in particular\
    \ for content\n   dissemination, in both extreme as well as typical scenarios,\
    \ can be\n   specified by drawing data from current CDN deployments.\n"

  - "2.6.  Vehicular Networking\n   Users \"on wheels\" are interested in road safety,\
    \ traffic efficiency,\n   and infotainment applications that can be supported\
    \ through vehicle-\n   to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) wireless\n\
    \   communications.  These applications exhibit unique features in terms\n   of\
    \ traffic generation patterns, delivery requirements, and spatial\n   and temporal\
    \ scope, which pose great challenges to traditional\n   networking solutions.\
    \  VANETs, by their nature, are characterized by\n   challenges such as fast-changing\
    \ topology, intermittent connectivity,\n   and high node mobility, but also by\
    \ the opportunity to combine\n   information from different sources as each vehicle\
    \ does not care\n   about \"who\" delivers the named data objects.\n   ICN is\
    \ an attractive candidate solution for vehicular networking, as\n   it has several\
    \ advantages.  First, ICN fits well to the nature of\n   typical vehicular applications\
    \ that are geography- and time-dependent\n   (e.g., road traveler information,\
    \ accident warning, point-of-interest\n   advertisements) and usually target vehicles\
    \ in a given area,\n   regardless of their identity or IP address.  These applications\
    \ are\n   likely to benefit from in-network and decentralized data caching and\n\
    \   replication mechanisms.  Second, content caching is particularly\n   beneficial\
    \ for intermittent on-the-road connectivity and can speed up\n   data retrieval\
    \ through content replication in several nodes.  Caching\n   can usually be implemented\
    \ at relatively low cost in vehicles, as the\n   energy demands of the ICN device\
    \ are likely to be a negligible\n   fraction of the total vehicle energy consumption,\
    \ thus allowing for\n   sophisticated processing, continuous communication, and\
    \ adequate\n   storage in the vehicle.  Finally, ICN natively supports asynchronous\n\
    \   data exchange between end-nodes.  By using (and redistributing)\n   cached\
    \ named information objects, a mobile node can serve as a link\n   between disconnected\
    \ areas.  In short, ICN can enable communication\n   even under intermittent network\
    \ connectivity, which is typical of\n   vehicular environments with sparse roadside\
    \ infrastructure and fast-\n   moving nodes.\n   The advantages of ICN in vehicular\
    \ networks were preliminarily\n   discussed in [EWC] and [DMND], and additionally\
    \ investigated in\n   [DNV2V], [RTIND], [CCNHV], [CCDIVN], [CCNVANET], and [CRoWN].\
    \  For\n   example, Bai and Krishnamachari [EWC] take advantage of the localized\n\
    \   and dynamic nature of a VANET to explore how a road congestion\n   notification\
    \ application can be implemented.  Wang et al. [DMND]\n   consider data collection\
    \ where Road-Side Units (RSUs) collect\n   information from vehicles by broadcasting\
    \ NDN-like Interest packets.\n   The proposed architecture is evaluated using\
    \ simulation in a grid\n   topology and is compared against a host-centric alternative\
    \ based on\n   Mobile IP.  See Figure 3 for an indicative example of an urban\
    \ VANET\n   topology.  Their results indicate high efficiency for ICN even at\n\
    \   high speeds.  That said, this work is a preliminary exploration of\n   ICN\
    \ in vehicular environments, so various issues remain for\n   evaluation.  They\
    \ include system scalability to large numbers of\n   vehicles and the impact of\
    \ vehicles that forward Interest packets or\n   relay data to other vehicles.\n\

    \ VANETs may be a good\n   showcase for the ICN advantages with respect to content\n\

    \   ICN framework for content retrieval and distribution where the role\n   of\
    \ provider can be played equivalently by both vehicles and RSUs.\n   ICN forwarding\
    \ is extended through path-state information carried in\n   Interest and Data\
    \ packets, stored in a new data structure kept by\n   vehicular nodes, and exploited\
    \ also to cope with node mobility.\n   Typical scenarios for testing content distribution\
    \ in VANETs may be\n   highways with vehicles moving in straight lines, with or\

- title: 2.7.  Delay- and Disruption-Tolerance
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Delay- and Disruption-Tolerance\n   Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking\
    \ (DTN) originated as a means\n   to extend the Internet to interplanetary communications\
    \ [DTN].\n   However, it was subsequently found to be an appropriate architecture\n\
    \   for many terrestrial situations as well.  Typically, this was where\n   delays\
    \ were greater than protocols such as TCP could handle, and\n   where disruptions\
    \ to communications were the norm rather than\n   occasional annoyances, e.g.,\
    \ where an end-to-end path does not\n   necessarily exist when communication is\
    \ initiated.  DTN has now been\n   applied to many situations, including opportunistic\
    \ content sharing,\n   handling infrastructural issues during emergency situations\
    \ (e.g.,\n   earthquakes) and providing connectivity to remote rural areas without\n\
    \   existing Internet provision and little or no communications or power\n   infrastructure.\n\
    \   The DTN architecture [RFC4838] is based on a \"store, carry, and\n   forward\"\
    \ paradigm that has been applied extensively to situations\n   where data is carried\
    \ between network nodes by a \"data mule\", which\n   carries bundles of data\
    \ stored in some convenient storage medium\n   (e.g., a USB memory stick).  With\
    \ the advent of sensor and peer-to-\n   peer (P2P) networks between mobile nodes,\
    \ DTN is becoming a more\n   commonplace type of networking than originally envisioned.\
    \  Since ICN\n   also does not rely on the familiar end-to-end communications\n\
    \   paradigm, there are clear synergies [DTNICN].  It could therefore be\n   argued\
    \ that many of the key principles embodied within DTN also exist\n   in ICN, as\
    \ we explain next.\n   First, both approaches rely on in-network storage.  In\
    \ the case of\n   DTN, bundles are stored temporarily on devices on a hop-by-hop\
    \ basis.\n   In the case of ICN, information objects are also cached on devices\
    \ in\n   a similar fashion.  As such, both paradigms must provision storage\n\
    \   within the network.\n   Second, both approaches espouse late binding of names\
    \ to locations\n   due to the potentially large interval between request and response\n\
    \   generation.  In the case of DTN, it is often impossible to predict\n   the\
    \ exact location (in a disconnected topology) where a node will be\n   found.\
    \  Similarly, in the case of ICN, it is also often impossible to\n   predict where\
    \ an information object might be found.  As such, the\n   binding of a request/bundle\
    \ to a destination (or routing locator)\n   must be performed as late as possible.\n\
    \   Finally, both approaches treat data as a long-lived component that\n   can\
    \ exist in the network for extended periods of time.  In the case\n   of DTN,\
    \ bundles are carried by nodes until appropriate next hops are\n   discovered.\
    \  In the case of ICN, information objects are typically\n   cached until storage\
    \ is exhausted.  As such, both paradigms require a\n   direct shift in the way\
    \ applications interact with the network.\n   Through these similarities, it becomes\
    \ possible to identify many DTN\n   principles that are already in existence within\
    \ ICN architectures.\n   For example, ICN nodes will often retain information\
    \ objects locally,\n   making them accessible later on, much as DTN bundles are\
    \ handled.\n   Consequently, these synergies suggest strong potential for marrying\n\
    \   the two technologies.  This could include, for instance, building new\n  \
    \ integrated Information-Centric Delay Tolerant Network (ICDTN)\n   protocols\
    \ or, alternatively, building ICN schemes over existing DTN\n   protocols (and\
    \ vice versa).\n   The above similarities suggest that integration of the two\
    \ principles\n   would be feasible.  Beyond this, there are also a number of\n\
    \   identifiable direct benefits.  Through caching and replication, ICN\n   offers\
    \ strong information resilience, whilst, through store-and-\n   forward, DTN offers\
    \ strong connectivity resilience.  As such, both\n   architectures could benefit\
    \ greatly from each other.  Initial steps\n   have already been taken in the DTN\
    \ community to integrate ICN\n   principles, e.g., the Bundle Protocol Query Block\
    \ [BPQ] has been\n   proposed for the DTN Bundle Protocol [RFC5050].  Similarly,\
    \ initial\n   steps have also been taken in the ICN community, such as [SLINKY].\n\
    \   In fact, the Scalable and Adaptive Internet Solutions (SAIL) project\n   has\
    \ developed a prototype implementation of NetInf running over the\n   DTN Bundle\
    \ Protocol.\n   Of course, in many circumstances, information-centricity is not\n\
    \   appropriate for use in delay- and disruption-tolerant environments.\n   This\
    \ is particularly the case when information is not the key\n   communications\
    \ atom transmitted.  Further, situations where a single\n   sink is always used\
    \ for receiving information may not warrant the\n   identification and routing\
    \ of independent information objects.\n   However, there are a number of key scenarios\
    \ where clear benefits\n   could be gained by introducing information-centric\
    \ principles into\n   DTNs, two of which we describe later in this section.\n\
    \   For the purpose of evaluating the use of ICNs in a DTN setting, two\n   key\
    \ scenarios are identified in this document.  (Note the rest of\n   this section\
    \ uses the term \"ICDTN\".)  These are both prominent use\n   cases that are currently\
    \ active in both the ICN and DTN communities.\n   The first is opportunistic content\
    \ sharing, whilst the second is the\n   use of ad hoc networks during disaster\
    \ recovery (e.g., earthquakes).\n   We discuss both types of scenarios in the\
    \ context of a simulation-\n   based evaluation: due to the scale and mobility\
    \ of DTN-like setups,\n   this is the primary method of evaluation used.  Within\
    \ the DTN\n   community, the majority of simulations are performed using the\n\
    \   Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator [ONE], which is\n   referred\
    \ to in this document.  Before exploring the two scenarios,\n   the key shared\
    \ components of their simulation are discussed.  This is\n   separated into the\
    \ two primary inputs that are required: the\n   environment and the workload.\n\
    \   In both types of scenarios the environment can be abstractly modeled\n   by\
    \ a time series of active connections between device pairs.  Unlike\n   other\
    \ scenarios in this document, an ICDTN scenario therefore does\n   not depend\
    \ on (relatively) static topologies but, rather, a set of\n   time-varying disconnected\
    \ topologies.  In opportunistic networks,\n   these topologies are actually products\
    \ of the mobility of users.  For\n   example, if two users walk past each other,\
    \ an opportunistic link can\n   be created.  There are two methods used to generate\
    \ these mobility\n   patterns and, in turn, the time series of topologies.  The\
    \ first is\n   synthetic, whereby a (mathematical) model of user behavior is created\n\
    \   in an agent-based fashion, e.g., random waypoint, Gauss-Markov.  The\n   second\
    \ is trace-driven, whereby the mobility of real users is\n   recorded and used.\
    \  In both cases, the output is a sequence of time-\n   stamped \"contacts\",\
    \ i.e., periods of time in which two devices can\n   communicate.  An important\
    \ factor missing from typical mobility\n   traces, however, is the capacity of\
    \ these contacts: how much data can\n   be transferred?  In both approaches to\
    \ modeling mobility, links are\n   usually configured as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (ONE\
    \ easily allows this,\n   although lower-layer considerations are ignored, e.g.,\
    \ interference).\n   This is motivated by the predominance of these technologies\
    \ on mobile\n   phones.\n   The workload in an ICDTN is modeled much like the\
    \ workload within the\n   other scenarios.  It involves object creation/placement\
    \ and object\n   retrieval.  Object creation/placement can either be done statically\n\
    \   at the beginning of the simulations or, alternatively, dynamically\n   based\
    \ on a model of user behavior.  In both cases, the latter is\n   focused on, as\
    \ it models far better the characteristics of the\n   scenarios.\n   Once the\
    \ environment and workload have been configured, the next step\n   is to decide\
    \ the key metrics for the study.  Unlike traditional\n   networking, the QoS expectation\
    \ is typically far lower in an ICDTN,\n   thereby moving away from metrics such\
    \ as throughput.  At a high\n   level, it is of clear interest to evaluate different\
    \ ICN approaches\n   with respect to both their delay- and disruption-tolerance\
    \ (i.e., how\n   effective is the approach when used in an environment subject\
    \ to\n   significant delay and/or disruption) and to their active support for\n\
    \   operations in a DTN environment.\n   The two most prominent metrics considered\
    \ in a host-centric DTN are\n   delivery probability and delivery delay.  The\
    \ former relates to the\n   probability by which a sent message will be received\
    \ within a certain\n   delay bound, whilst the latter captures the average length\
    \ of time it\n   takes for nodes to receive the message.  These metrics are similarly\n\
    \   important in an ICDTN, although they are slightly different due to\n   the\
    \ request-response nature of ICN.  Therefore, the two most\n   prominent evaluative\
    \ metrics are satisfaction probability and\n   satisfaction delay.  The former\
    \ refers to the probability by which an\n   information request (e.g., Interest)\
    \ will be satisfied (i.e., how\n   often a Data response will be received).  Satisfaction\
    \ delay refers\n   to the length of time it takes an information request to be\n\
    \   satisfied.\n   Note that the key difference between the host-centric and\n\
    \   information-centric metrics is the need for a round-trip rather than\n   a\
    \ one-way communication.  Beyond this, depending on the focus of the\n   work,\
    \ other elements that may be investigated include name\n   resolution, routing,\
    \ and forwarding in disconnected parts of the\n   network; support for unidirectional\
    \ links; number of round trips\n   needed to complete a data transfer; long-term\
    \ content availability\n   (or resilience); efficiency in the face of disruption;\
    \ and so on.  It\n   is also important to weigh these performance metrics against\
    \ the\n   necessary overheads.  In the case of an ICDTN, this is generally\n \
    \  measured by the number of message replicas required to access\n   content.\
    \  Note that routing in a DTN is often replication based,\n   which leads to many\
    \ copies of the same message.\n"
- title: 2.7.1.  Opportunistic Content Sharing
  contents:
  - "2.7.1.  Opportunistic Content Sharing\n   The first key baseline scenario in\
    \ this context is opportunistic\n   content sharing.  This occurs when mobile\
    \ nodes create opportunistic\n   links between each other to share content of\
    \ interest.  For example,\n   people riding on an underground train can pass news\
    \ items between\n   their mobile phones.  Equally, content generated on the phones\
    \ (e.g.,\n   tweets [TWIMIGHT]) could be stored for later forwarding (or even\n\
    \   forwarded amongst interested passengers on the train).  Such\n   scenarios,\
    \ clearly, must be based around either the altruistic or\n   incentivized interaction\
    \ amongst users.  The latter is a particularly\n   active area of research.  These\
    \ networks are often termed \"pocket-\n   switched networks\", as they are independently\
    \ formed between the user\n   devices.  Here, the evaluative scenario of ICDTN\
    \ microblogging is\n   proposed.  As previously discussed, the construction of\
    \ such an\n   evaluative scenario requires a formalization of its environment\
    \ and\n   workload.  Fortunately, there exist a number of datasets that offer\n\
    \   exactly this information required for microblogging.\n   In terms of the environment\
    \ (i.e., mobility patterns), the Haggle\n   project produced contact traces based\
    \ on conference attendees using\n   Bluetooth.  These traces are best targeted\
    \ at application scenarios\n   in which a small group of (50-100) people are in\
    \ a relatively\n   confined space.  In contrast, larger-scale traces are also\
    \ available,\n   most notably MIT's Reality Mining project.  These are better\
    \ suited\n   for cases where longer-term movement patterns are of interest.\n\
    \   The second input, workload, relates to the creation and consumption\n   of\
    \ microblogs (e.g., tweets).  This can be effectively captured\n   because subscriptions\
    \ conveniently formalize who consumes what.  For\n   bespoke purposes, specific\
    \ data can be directly collected from\n   Twitter for trace-driven simulations.\
    \  Several Twitter datasets are\n   already available to the community containing\
    \ a variety of data,\n   ranging from Tweets to follower graphs.  See\n   <http://www.tweetarchivist.com>\
    \ and\n   <http://socialcomputing.asu.edu/datasets/Twitter>.  These datasets\n\
    \   can therefore be used to extract information production, placement,\n   and\
    \ consumption.\n"
- title: 2.7.2.  Emergency Support and Disaster Recovery
  contents:
  - "2.7.2.  Emergency Support and Disaster Recovery\n   The second key baseline scenario\
    \ in this context relates to the use\n   of ICDTNs in emergency scenarios.  In\
    \ these situations, it is typical\n   for infrastructure to be damaged or destroyed,\
    \ leading to the\n   collapse of traditional forms of communications (e.g., cellular\n\
    \   telephone networks).  This has been seen in the recent North Indian\n   flooding,\
    \ as well as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.  Power\n   problems often\
    \ exacerbate the issue, with communication failures\n   lasting for days.  Therefore,\
    \ in order to address this, DTNs have\n   been used due to their high levels of\
    \ resilience and independence\n   from fixed infrastructure.  The most prominent\
    \ use of DTNs in\n   disaster areas would be the dissemination of information,\
    \ e.g.,\n   warnings and evacuation maps.  Unlike the previous scenario, it can\n\
    \   be assumed that certain users (e.g., emergency responders) are highly\n  \
    \ altruistic.  However, it is likely many other users (e.g., endangered\n   civilians)\
    \ might become far more conservative in how they use their\n   devices for battery-conserving\
    \ purposes.  Here, we focus on the\n   dissemination of standard broadcast information\
    \ that should be\n   received by all parties; generally, this is something led\
    \ by\n   emergency responders.\n   For the environmental setup, there are no commonly\
    \ used mobility\n   traces for disaster zones, unlike in the previous scenario.\
    \  This is\n   clearly due to the difficultly (near impossibility) of acquiring\
    \ them\n   in a real setting.  That said, various synthetic models are\n   available.\
    \  The Post-Disaster Mobility Model [MODEL1] models\n   civilians and emergency\
    \ responders after a disaster has occurred,\n   with people attempting to reach\
    \ evacuation points (this has also been\n   implemented in the ONE simulator).\
    \  Aschenbruck et al. [MODEL2] focus\n   on emergency responders, featuring the\
    \ removal of nodes from the\n   disaster zone, as well as things like obstacles\
    \ (e.g., collapsed\n   buildings).  Cabrero et al. [MODEL3] also look at emergency\n\
    \   responders but focus on patterns associated with common procedures.\n   For\
    \ example, command and control centers are typically set up with\n   emergency\
    \ responders periodically returning.  Clearly, the mobility\n   of emergency responders\
    \ is particularly important in this setting\n   because they usually are the ones\
    \ who will \"carry\" information into\n   the disaster zone.  It is recommended\
    \ that one of these emergency-\n   specific models be used during any evaluations,\
    \ due to the inaccuracy\n   of alternate models used for \"normal\" behavior.\n\
    \   The workload input in this evaluative scenario is far simpler than\n   for\
    \ the previous scenario.  In emergency cases, the dissemination of\n   individual\
    \ pieces of information to all parties is the norm.  This is\n   often embodied\
    \ using things like the Common Alert Protocol (CAP),\n   which is an XML standard\
    \ for describing warning message.  It is\n   currently used by various systems,\
    \ including the Integrated Public\n   Alert & Warning System and Google Crisis\
    \ Response.  As such, small\n   objects (e.g., 512 KB to 2 MB) are usually generated\
    \ containing text\n   and images; note that the ONE simulator offers utilities\
    \ to easily\n   generate these.  These messages are also always generated by central\n\
    \   authorities, therefore making the placement problem easier (they\n   would\
    \ be centrally generated and given to emergency responders to\n   disseminate\
    \ as they pass through the disaster zone).  The key\n   variable is therefore\
    \ the generation rate, which is synonymous with\n   the rate that microblogs are\
    \ written in the previous scenario.  This\n   will largely be based on the type\
    \ of disaster occurring; however,\n   hourly updates would be an appropriate configuration.\
    \  Higher rates\n   can also be tested, based on the rate at which situations\
    \ change\n   (landslides, for example, can exhibit highly dynamic properties).\n\
    \   To summarize, this section has highlighted the applicability of ICN\n   principles\
    \ to existing DTN scenarios.  Two evaluative setups have\n   been described in\
    \ detail, namely, mobile opportunistic content\n   sharing (microblogging) and\
    \ emergency information dissemination.\n"
- title: 2.8.  Internet of Things
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Internet of Things\n   Advances in electronics miniaturization combined\
    \ with low-power\n   wireless access technologies (e.g., ZigBee, Near Field Communication\n\
    \   (NFC), Bluetooth, and others) have enabled the coupling of\n   interconnected\
    \ digital services with everyday objects.  As devices\n   with sensors and actuators\
    \ connect into the network, they become\n   \"smart objects\" and form the foundation\
    \ for the so-called Internet of\n   Things (IoT).  IoT is expected to increase\
    \ significantly the amount\n   of content carried by the network due to machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M)\n   communication as well as novel user-interaction possibilities.\n \
    \  Yet, the full potential of IoT does not lie in simple remote access\n   to\
    \ smart object data.  Instead, it is the intersection of Internet\n   services\
    \ with the physical world that will bring about the most\n   dramatic changes.\
    \  Burke [IoTEx], for instance, makes a very good\n   case for creating everyday\
    \ experiences using interconnected things\n   through participatory sensing applications.\
    \  In this case, inherent\n   ICN capabilities for data discovery, caching, and\
    \ trusted\n   communication are leveraged to obtain sensor information and enable\n\
    \   content exchange between mobile users, repositories, and\n   applications.\n\
    \   Kutscher and Farrell [IWMT] discuss the benefits that ICN can provide\n  \
    \ in these environments in terms of naming, caching, and optimized\n   transport.\
    \  The Named Information URI scheme (ni) [RFC6920], for\n   instance, could be\
    \ used for globally unique smart object\n   identification, although an actual\
    \ implementation report is not\n   currently available.  Access to information\
    \ generated by smart\n   objects can be of varied nature and often vital for the\
    \ correct\n   operation of large systems.  As such, supporting timestamping,\n\
    \   security, scalability, and flexibility need to be taken into account.\n  \
    \ Ghodsi et al. [NCOA] examine hierarchical and self-certifying naming\n   schemes\
    \ and point out that ensuring reliable and secure content\n   naming and retrieval\
    \ may pose stringent requirements (e.g., the\n   necessity for employing PKI),\
    \ which can be too demanding for low-\n   powered nodes, such as sensors.  That\
    \ said, earlier work by Heidemann\n   et al. [nWSN] shows that, for dense sensor\
    \ network deployments,\n   disassociating sensor naming from network topology\
    \ and using named\n   content at the lowest level of communication in combination\
    \ with in-\n   network processing of sensor data is feasible in practice and can\
    \ be\n   more efficient than employing a host-centric binding between node\n \
    \  locator and the content existing therein.\n   Burke et al. [NDNl] describe\
    \ the implementation of a building\n   automation system for lighting control\
    \ where the security, naming,\n   and device discovery NDN mechanisms are leveraged\
    \ to provide\n   configuration, installation, and management of residential and\n\
    \   industrial lighting control systems.  The goal is an inherently\n   resilient\
    \ system, where even smartphones can be used for control.\n   Naming reflects\
    \ fixtures with evolved identification and node-\n   reaching capabilities, thus\
    \ simplifying bootstrapping, discovery, and\n   user interaction with nodes. \
    \ The authors report that this ICN-based\n   system requires less maintenance\
    \ and troubleshooting than typical\n   IP-based alternatives.\n   Biswas et al.\
    \ [CIBUS] visualize ICN as a contextualized information-\n   centric bus (CIBUS)\
    \ over which diverse sets of service producers and\n   consumers coexist with\
    \ different requirements.  ICN is leveraged to\n   unify different platforms to\
    \ serve consumer-producer interaction in\n   both infrastructure and ad hoc settings.\
    \  Ravindran et al. [Homenet]\n   show the application of this idea in the context\
    \ of a home network,\n   where consumers (residents) require policy-driven interactions\
    \ with\n   diverse services such as climate control, surveillance systems, and\n\
    \   entertainment systems.  Name-based protocols are developed to enable\n   zero-configuration\
    \ node and service discovery, contextual service\n   publishing and subscription,\
    \ policy-based routing and forwarding with\n   name-based firewall, and hoc device-to-device\
    \ communication.\n   IoT exposes ICN concepts to a stringent set of requirements\
    \ that are\n   exacerbated by the quantity of nodes, as well as by the type and\n\
    \   volume of information that must be handled.  A way to address this is\n  \
    \ proposed in [IoTScope], which tackles the problem of mapping named\n   information\
    \ to an object, diverting from the currently typical\n   centralized discovery\
    \ of services and leveraging the intrinsic ICN\n   scalability capabilities for\
    \ naming.  It extends the base [PURSUIT]\n   design with hierarchically based\
    \ scopes, facilitating lookup, access,\n   and modifications of only the part\
    \ of the object information that the\n   user is interested in.  Another important\
    \ aspect is how to\n   efficiently address resolution and location of the information\n\
    \   objects, particularly when large numbers of nodes are connected, as\n   in\
    \ IoT deployments.  In [ICN-DHT], Katsaros et al. propose a\n   Distributed Hash\
    \ Table (DHT) that is compared with the Data-Oriented\n   Network Architecture\
    \ described in [DONA].  Their results show how\n   topological routing information\
    \ has a positive impact on resolution,\n   at the expense of memory and processing\
    \ overhead.\n   The use of ICN mechanisms in IoT scenarios faces the most dynamic\
    \ and\n   heterogeneous type of challenges, when taking into consideration the\n\
    \   requirements and objectives of such integration.  The disparity in\n   technologies\
    \ (not only in access technologies, but also in terms of\n   end-node diversity\
    \ such as sensors, actuators, and their\n   characteristics) as well as in the\
    \ information that is generated and\n   consumed in such scenarios, will undoubtedly\
    \ bring about many of the\n   considerations presented in the previous sections.\
    \  For instance, IoT\n   shares similarities with the constraints and requirements\
    \ applicable\n   to vehicular networking.  Here, a central problem is the deployment\n\
    \   of mechanisms that can use opportunistic connectivity in unreliable\n   networking\
    \ environments (similar to the vehicular networking and DTN\n   scenarios).\n\
    \   However, one important concern in IoT scenarios, also motivated by\n   this\
    \ strongly heterogeneous environment, is how content dissemination\n   will be\
    \ affected by the different semantics of the disparate\n   information and content\
    \ being shared.  In fact, this is already a\n   difficult problem that goes beyond\
    \ the scope of ICN [SEMANT].  With\n   the ability of the network nodes to cache\
    \ forwarded information to\n   improve future requests, a challenge arises regarding\
    \ whether the ICN\n   fabric should be involved in any kind of procedure (e.g.,\
    \ tagging)\n   that facilitates the relationship or the interpretation of the\n\
    \   different sources of information.\n   Another issue lies with the need for\
    \ having energy-efficiency\n   mechanisms related to the networking capabilities\
    \ of IoT\n   infrastructures.  Often, the devices in IoT deployments have limited\n\
    \   battery capabilities, and thus need low power consumption schemes\n   working\
    \ at multiple levels.  In principle, energy efficiency gains\n   should be observed\
    \ from the inherent in-network caching capability.\n   However, this might not\
    \ be the most usual case in IoT scenarios,\n   where the information (particularly\
    \ from sensors or controlling\n   actuators) is more akin to real-time traffic,\
    \ thus reducing the scale\n   of potential savings due to ubiquitous in-network\
    \ caching.\n   ICN approaches, therefore, should be evaluated with respect to\
    \ their\n   capacity to handle the content produced and consumed by extremely\n\
    \   large numbers of diverse devices.  IoT scenarios aim to exercise ICN\n   deployment\
    \ from different aspects, including ICN node design\n   requirements, efficient\
    \ naming, transport, and caching of time-\n   restricted data.  Scalability is\
    \ particularly important in this\n   regard as the successful deployment of IoT\
    \ principles could increase\n   both device and content numbers dramatically beyond\
    \ all current\n   expectations.\n"
- title: 2.9.  Smart City

  - "2.9.  Smart City\n   The rapid increase in urbanization sets the stage for the\
    \ most\n   compelling and challenging environments for networking.  By 2050 the\n\
    \   global population will reach nine billion people, 75% of which will\n   dwell\
    \ in urban areas.  In order to cope with this influx, many cities\n   around the\
    \ world have started their transformation toward the \"smart\n   city\" vision.\
    \  Smart cities will be based on the following innovation\n   axes: smart mobility,\
    \ smart environment, smart people, smart living,\n   and smart governance.  In\
    \ development terms, the core goal of a smart\n   city is to become a business-competitive\
    \ and attractive environment,\n   while serving citizen well-being [CPG].\n  \
    \ In a smart city, ICT plays a leading role and acts as the glue\n   bringing\
    \ together all actors, services, resources (and their\n   interrelationships)\
    \ that the urban environment is willing to host and\n   provide [MVM].  ICN appears\
    \ particularly suitable for these\n   scenarios.  Domains of interest include\
    \ intelligent transportation\n   systems, energy networks, health care, A/V communications,\
    \ peer-to-\n   peer and collaborative platforms for citizens, social inclusion,\n\
    \   active participation in public life, e-government, safety and\n   security,\
    \ and sensor networks.  Clearly, this scenario has close ties\n   to the vision\
    \ of IoT, discussed in the previous section, as well as\n   to vehicular networking.\n\
    \   Nevertheless, the road to build a real information-centric digital\n   ecosystem\
    \ will be long, and more coordinated effort is required to\n   drive innovation\
    \ in this domain.  We argue that smart-city needs and\n   ICN technologies can\
    \ trigger a virtuous innovation cycle toward\n   future ICT platforms.  Recent\
    \ concrete ICN-based contributions have\n   been formulated for home energy management\
    \ [iHEMS], geo-localized\n   services [ACC], smart-city services [IB], and traffic\
    \ information\n   dissemination in vehicular scenarios [RTIND].  Some of the proposed\n\
    \   ICN-based solutions are implemented in real testbeds, while others\n   are\
    \ evaluated through simulation.\n   Zhang et al. [iHEMS] propose a secure publish-subscribe\
    \ architecture\n   for handling the communication requirements of Home Energy\
    \ Management\n   Systems (HEMS).  The objective is to safely and effectively collect\n\
    \   measurement and status information from household elements, aggregate\n  \
    \ and analyze the data, and ultimately enable intelligent control\n   decisions\
    \ for actuation.  They consider a simple experimental testbed\n   for their proof-of-concept\
    \ evaluation, exploiting open source code\n   for the ICN implementation, and\
    \ emulating some node functionality in\n   order to facilitate system operation.\n\
    \   A different scenario is considered in [ACC], where DHTs are employed\n   for\
    \ distributed, scalable, and geographically aware service lookup in\n   a smart\
    \ city.  Also in this case, the ICN application is validated by\n   considering\
    \ a small-scale testbed: a small number of nodes are\n   emulated with simple\
    \ embedded PCs or specific hardware boards (e.g.,\n   for some sensor nodes);\
    \ other nodes (which connect the principal\n   actors of the tests) are emulated\

    \ (mainly oriented towards waste\n   collection management) comprising sensors\
    \ and moving vehicles, as\n   well as a cloud-computing system that supports data\

  - "3.1.  Multiply Connected Nodes and Economics\n   The evolution of, in particular,\
    \ wireless networking technologies has\n   resulted in a convergence of the bandwidth\
    \ and capabilities of\n   various different types of network.  Today, a leading-edge\
    \ mobile\n   telephone or tablet computer will typically be able to access a Wi-Fi\n\
    \   access point, a 4G cellular network, and the latest generation of\n   Bluetooth\
    \ local networking.  Until recently, a node would usually\n   have a clear favorite\
    \ network technology appropriate to any given\n   environment.  The choice would,\
    \ for example, be primarily determined\n   by the available bandwidth with cost\
    \ as a secondary determinant.\n   Furthermore, it is normally the case that a\
    \ device only uses one of\n   the technologies at a time for any particular application.\n\
    \   It seems likely that this situation will change so that nodes are\n   able\
    \ to use all of the available technologies in parallel.  This will\n   be further\
    \ encouraged by the development of new capabilities in\n   cellular networks including\
    \ Small Cell Networks [SCN] and\n   Heterogeneous Networks [HetNet].  Consequently,\
    \ mobile devices will\n   have similar choices to wired nodes attached to multiple\
    \ service\n   providers allowing \"multihoming\" via the various different\n \
    \  infrastructure networks as well as potential direct access to other\n   mobile\
    \ nodes via Bluetooth or a more capable form of ad hoc Wi-Fi.\n   Infrastructure\
    \ networks are generally under the control of separate\n   economic entities that\
    \ may have different policies about the\n   information of an ICN deployed within\
    \ their network caches.  As ICN\n   shifts the focus from nodes to information\
    \ objects, the interaction\n   between networks will likely evolve to capitalize\
    \ on data location\n   independence, efficient and scalable in-network named object\n\
    \   availability, and access via multiple paths.  These interactions\n   become\
    \ critical in evaluating the technical and economic impact of\n   ICN architectural\
    \ choices, as noted in [ArgICN].  Beyond simply\n   adding diversity in deployment\
    \ options, these networks have the\n   potential to alter the incentives among\
    \ existing (and future, we may\n   add) network players, as noted in [EconICN].\n\
    \   Moreover, such networks enable more numerous internetwork\n   relationships\
    \ where exchange of information may be conditioned on a\n   set of multilateral\
    \ policies.  For example, shared SCNs are emerging\n   as a cost-effective way\
    \ to address coverage of complex environments\n   such as sports stadiums, large\
    \ office buildings, malls, etc.  Such\n   networks are likely to be a complex\
    \ mix of different cellular and\n   WLAN access technologies (such as HSPA, LTE,\
    \ and Wi-Fi) as well as\n   ownership models.  It is reasonable to assume that\
    \ access to content\n   generated in such networks may depend on contextual information\
    \ such\n   as the subscription type, timing, and location of both the owner and\n\
    \   requester of the content.  The availability of such contextual\n   information\
    \ across diverse networks can lead to network\n   inefficiencies unless data management\
    \ can benefit from an\n   information-centric approach.  The \"Event with Large\
    \ Crowds\"\n   demonstrator created by the SAIL project investigated this kind\
    \ of\n   scenario; more details are available in [SAIL-B3].\n   Jacobson et al.\
    \ [CCN] include interactions between networks in their\n   overall system design\
    \ and mention both \"an edge-driven, bottom-up\n   incentive structure\" and techniques\
    \ based on evolutions of existing\n   mechanisms both for ICN router discovery\
    \ by the end-user and for\n   interconnecting between Autonomous Systems (ASes).\
    \  For example, a\n   BGP extension for domain-level content prefix advertisement\
    \ can be\n   used to enable efficient interconnection between ASes.  Liu et al.\n\
    \   [MLDHT] proposed to address the \"suffix-hole\" issue found in prefix-\n \
    \  based name aggregation through the use of a combination of Bloom-\n   filter-based\
    \ aggregation and multi-level DHT.\n   Name aggregation has been discussed for\
    \ a flat naming design, for\n   example, in [NCOA], in which the authors note\
    \ that based on\n   estimations in [DONA] flat naming may not require aggregation.\
    \  This\n   is a point that calls for further study.  Scenarios evaluating name\n\
    \   aggregation, or lack thereof, should take into account the amount of\n   state\
    \ (e.g., size of routing tables) maintained in edge routers as\n   well as network\
    \ efficiency (e.g., amount of traffic generated).\n                 +---------------+\n\

- title: 3.2.  Energy Efficiency
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Energy Efficiency\n   ICN has prominent features that can be taken advantage\
    \ of in order to\n   significantly reduce the energy footprint of future communication\n\
    \   networks.  Of course, one can argue that specific ICN network\n   elements\
    \ may consume more energy than today's conventional network\n   equipment due\
    \ to the potentially higher energy demands for named-data\n   processing en route.\
    \  On balance, however, ICN introduces an\n   architectural approach that may\
    \ compensate on the whole and can even\n   achieve higher energy efficiency rates\
    \ when compared to the host-\n   centric paradigm.\n   We elaborate on the energy\
    \ efficiency potential of ICN based on three\n   categories of ICN characteristics.\
    \  Namely, we point out that a) ICN\n   does not rely solely on end-to-end communication,\
    \ b) ICN enables\n   ubiquitous caching, and c) ICN brings awareness of user requests\
    \ (as\n   well as their corresponding responses) at the network layer thus\n \
    \  permitting network elements to better schedule their transmission\n   patterns.\n\
    \   First, ICN does not mandate perpetual end-to-end communication, which\n  \
    \ introduces a whole range of energy consumption inefficiencies due to\n   the\
    \ extensive signaling, especially in the case of mobile and\n   wirelessly connected\
    \ devices.  This opens up new opportunities for\n   accommodating sporadically\
    \ connected nodes and could be one of the\n   keys to an order-of-magnitude decrease\
    \ in energy consumption compared\n   to the potential contributions of other technological\
    \ advances.  For\n   example, web applications often need to maintain state at\
    \ both ends\n   of a connection in order to verify that the authenticated peer\
    \ is up\n   and running.  This introduces keep-alive timers and polling behavior\n\
    \   with a high toll on energy consumption.  Pentikousis [EEMN] discusses\n  \
    \ several related scenarios and explains why the current host-centric\n   paradigm,\
    \ which employs perpetual end-to-end connections, introduces\n   built-in energy\
    \ inefficiencies, and argues that patches to make\n   currently deployed protocols\
    \ energy-aware cannot provide for an\n   order-of-magnitude increase in energy\
    \ efficiency.\n   Second, ICN network elements come with built-in caching capabilities,\n\
    \   which is often referred to as \"ubiquitous caching\".  Pushing data\n   objects\
    \ to caches closer to end-user devices, for example, could\n   significantly reduce\
    \ the amount of transit traffic in the core\n   network, thereby reducing the\
    \ energy used for data transport.  Guan\n   et al. [EECCN] study the energy efficiency\
    \ of a CCNx architecture\n   (based on their proposed energy model) and compare\
    \ it with\n   conventional content dissemination systems such as CDNs and P2P.\n\
    \   Their model is based on the analysis of the topological structure and\n  \
    \ the average hop length from all consumers to the nearest cache\n   location.\
    \  Their results show that an information-centric approach\n   can be more energy\
    \ efficient in delivering popular and small-size\n   content.  In particular,\
    \ they also note that different network-\n   element design choices (e.g., the\
    \ optical bypass approach) can be\n   more energy efficient in delivering infrequently\
    \ accessed content.\n   Lee et al. [EECD] investigate the energy efficiency of\
    \ various\n   network devices deployed in access, metro, and core networks for\
    \ both\n   CDNs and ICN.  They use trace-based simulations to show that an ICN\n\
    \   approach can substantially improve the network energy efficiency for\n   content\
    \ dissemination mainly due to the reduction in the number of\n   hops required\
    \ to obtain a data object, which can be served by\n   intermediate nodes in ICN.\
    \  They also emphasize that the impact of\n   cache placement (in incremental\
    \ deployment scenarios) and\n   local/cooperative content replacement strategies\
    \ needs to be\n   carefully investigated in order to better quantify the energy\n\
    \   efficiencies arising from adopting an ICN paradigm.\n   Third, ICN elements\
    \ are aware of the user request and its\n   corresponding data response; due to\
    \ the nature of name-based routing,\n   they can employ power consumption optimization\
    \ processes for\n   determining their transmission schedule or powering down inactive\n\
    \   network interfaces.  For example, network coding [NCICN] or adaptive\n   video\
    \ streaming [COAST] can be used in individual ICN elements so\n   that redundant\
    \ transmissions, possibly passing through intermediary\n   networks, could be\
    \ significantly reduced, thereby saving energy by\n   avoiding carrying redundant\
    \ traffic.\n   Alternatively, approaches that aim to simplify routers, such as\n\
    \   [PURSUIT], could also reduce energy consumption by pushing routing\n   decisions\
    \ to a more energy-efficient entity.  Along these lines, Ko\n   et al. [ICNDC]\
    \ design a data center network architecture based on ICN\n   principles and decouple\
    \ the router control-plane and data-plane\n   functionalities.  Thus, data forwarding\
    \ is performed by simplified\n   network entities, while the complicated routing\
    \ computation is\n   carried out in more energy-efficient data centers.\n   To\
    \ summarize, energy efficiency has been discussed in ICN evaluation\n   studies,\
    \ but most published work is preliminary in nature.  Thus, we\n   suggest that\
    \ more work is needed in this front.  Evaluating energy\n   efficiency does not\
    \ require the definition of new scenarios or\n   baseline topologies, but does\
    \ require the establishment of clear\n   guidelines so that different ICN approaches\
    \ can be compared not only\n   in terms of scalability, for example, but also\
    \ in terms of power\n   consumption.\n"

  - "3.3.  Operation across Multiple Network Paradigms\n   Today the overwhelming\
    \ majority of networks are integrated with the\n   well-connected Internet with\
    \ IP at the \"waist\" of the technology\n   hourglass.  However, there is a large\
    \ amount of ongoing research into\n   alternative paradigms that can cope with\
    \ conditions other than the\n   standard set assumed by the Internet.  Perhaps\
    \ the most advanced of\n   these is Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking\
    \ (DTN).  DTN is\n   considered as one of the scenarios for the deployment in\
    \ Section 2.7,\n   but here we consider how ICN can operate in an integrated network\n\
    \   that has essentially disjoint \"domains\" (a highly overloaded term!)\n  \
    \ or regions that use different network paradigms and technologies, but\n   with\
    \ gateways that allow interoperation.\n   ICN operates in terms of named data\
    \ objects so that requests and\n   deliveries of information objects can be independent\
    \ of the\n   networking paradigm.  Some researchers have contemplated some form\
    \ of\n   ICN becoming the new waist of the hourglass as the basis of a future\n\
    \   reincarnation of the Internet, e.g., [ArgICN], but there are a large\n   number\
    \ of problems to resolve, including authorization, access\n   control, and transactional\
    \ operation for applications such as\n   banking, before some form of ICN can\
    \ be considered as ready to take\n   over from IP as the dominant networking technology.\
    \  In the meantime,\n   ICN architectures will operate in conjunction with existing\
    \ network\n   technologies as an overlay or in cooperation with the lower layers\
    \ of\n   the \"native\" technology.\n   It seems likely that as the reach of the\
    \ \"Internet\" is extended,\n   other technologies such as DTN will be needed\
    \ to handle scenarios\n   such as space communications where inherent delays are\
    \ too large for\n   TCP/IP to cope with effectively.  Thus, demonstrating that\
    \ ICN\n   architectures can work effectively in and across the boundaries of\n\
    \   different networking technologies will be important.\n   The NetInf architecture,\
    \ in particular, targets the inter-domain\n   scenario by the use of a convergence-layer\
    \ architecture [SAIL-B3],\n   and Publish-Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm\
    \ (PSIRP) and/or\n   Publish-Subscribe Internet Technology (PURSUIT) is envisaged\
    \ as a\n   candidate for an IP replacement.\n   The key items for evaluation over\
    \ and above the satisfactory\n   operation of the architecture in each constituent\
    \ domain will be to\n   ensure that requests and responses can be carried across\
    \ the network\n   boundaries with adequate performance and do not cause malfunctions\

    \ of\n   considerations, as a result of our ongoing survey of the literature\n\
    \   and the discussion within ICNRG, which we believe would have\n   otherwise\
    \ remained unnoticed in the wider community.  As a result, we\n   expect that\
    \ this document can assist in fostering the applicability\n   and future deployment\
    \ of ICN over a broader set of operations, as\n   well as possibly influencing\
    \ and enhancing the base ICN proposals\n   that are currently available and possibly\
    \ assist in defining new\n   scenarios where ICN would be applicable.\n   We conclude\
    \ this document with a brief summary of the evaluation\n   aspects we have seen\
    \ across a range of scenarios.\n   The scalability of different mechanisms in\
    \ an ICN architecture stands\n   out as an important concern (cf. Sections 2.1,\
    \ 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.8,\n   2.9, and 3.1) as does network, resource, and energy\
    \ efficiency (cf.\n   Sections 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, and 3.2).  Operational aspects\
    \ such as\n   network planing, manageability, reduced complexity and overhead\
    \ (cf.\n   Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.8, and 3.1) should not be neglected\n   especially\
    \ as ICN architectures are evaluated with respect to their\n   potential for deployment\
    \ in the real world.  Accordingly, further\n   research in economic aspects as\
    \ well as in the communication,\n   computation, and storage tradeoffs entailed\
    \ in each ICN architecture\n   is needed.\n   With respect to purely technical\
    \ requirements, support for multicast,\n   mobility, and caching lie at the core\
    \ of many scenarios (cf. Sections\n   2.1, 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6).  ICN must also\
    \ be able to cope when the\n   Internet expands to incorporate additional network\
    \ paradigms (cf.\n   Section 3.3).  We have also seen that being able to address\
    \ stringent\n   QoS requirements and increase reliability and resilience should\
    \ also\n   be evaluated following well-established methods (cf. Sections 2.2,\n\
    \   2.8, and 2.9).\n   Finally, we note that new applications that significantly\
    \ improve the\n   end-user experience and forge a migration path from today's\
    \ host-\n   centric paradigm could be the key to a sustained and increasing\n\
    \   deployment of the ICN paradigm in the real world (cf. Sections 2.2,\n   2.3,\
    \ 2.6, 2.8, and 2.9).\n"
