- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In recent years there has been an expansion in the number\
    \ of\n   broadcast television and radio services available to the home.  In\n\
    \   addition to the broadcast services delivered over traditional\n   distribution\
    \ channels such as Digital Terrestrial, Satellite and\n   Cable, the advent of\
    \ high-speed Internet connection will give rise to\n   even more information and\
    \ entertainment services, providing audio-\n   visual programme material sourced\
    \ directly to the home over the\n   Internet.\n   Alongside this expansion there\
    \ has also been increased growth in\n   complexity of devices available to the\
    \ home user, which will allow\n   the user to operate in a 'search-select-acquire'\
    \ paradigm.  In this\n   model, the user or user agent uses descriptive information\
    \ about\n   audio visual programmes as a basis for selecting the programme for\n\
    \   subsequent acquisition and viewing.  Increasingly, home appliances\n   are\
    \ being furnished with local storage, enabling the automatic\n   capture of programme\
    \ material through off-air recording or\n   downloading by a home appliance.\n\
    \   The 'CRID:' Uniform Resource Locator is designed to be the bridge\n   between\
    \ programme-related descriptive metadata and corresponding\n   programme location\
    \ data that may be published over a different\n   distribution network or at a\
    \ different time.\n   Programme location data provides the home user agent with\
    \ the\n   information required to acquire the programme at the time of\n   publication.\
    \  In the case of the television distribution model, these\n   locators provide\
    \ programme broadcast timing and tuning information so\n   that the user appliance\
    \ can record the programme when it is broadcast\n   in real time.  In the case\
    \ of Internet delivery, the locators have to\n   be of the form associated with\
    \ streaming protocols or file exchange\n   protocols with the time (or time window)\
    \ of availability indicated.\n   Because a content publisher may release audio-video\
    \ material in the\n   same form on a number of platforms or repeatedly over some\
    \ time\n   interval, the CRID can be used to aggregate these different\n   publications\
    \ and associate them with a single description.\n   Furthermore, there may be\
    \ other meaningful semantic associations\n   between otherwise unrelated programme\
    \ publications with assigned CRID\n   that can be further aggregated under a higher-level\
    \ CRID.  This\n   higher-level CRID can be described through its own descriptive\n\
    \   metadata.  The subjective nature of these aggregation decisions is\n   part\
    \ of the CRID authoring process and is not standardised.\n   The CRID resolution\
    \ process ultimately enabling the user agent to\n   acquire audio-visual programme\
    \ material may be a timely process, with\n   resolution updates delivered dynamically\
    \ from the service provider.\n   This is to reflect common business practice of\
    \ adjusting the time of\n   content availability close to the original published\
    \ time to\n   accommodate a live, managed, reactive broadcast service.\n"
- title: 2.  Ancestry
  contents:
  - "2.  Ancestry\n   The Uniform Resource Locator scheme 'CRID:' is taken from the\n\
    \   TV-Anytime forum Content Reference Identifier and is a result of the\n   consensus\
    \ reached by members of this forum between March 2000 and\n   June 2002.  The\
    \ TV-Anytime CRID and associated supporting data is\n   specified in the TV-Anytime\
    \ Phase 1 Content Referencing Specification\n   [TVA-CR].\n"
- title: 3.  Notation Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "3.  Notation Used in This Document\n   The notation used in this document takes\
    \ the form\n               <first>/<second>\n   in which the component names are\
    \ in angle brackets and any characters\n   outside angle brackets are literal\
    \ separators.\n"
- title: 4.  The CRID URL Scheme
  contents:
  - "4.  The CRID URL Scheme\n   The CRID URL takes the form\n               crid://<DNS\
    \ name>/<data>\n   in which <DNS name> is a registered Internet domain name that\
    \ takes\n   the form of domain name described in Section 3 of [RFC1034] and\n\
    \   Section 2.1 of [RFC1123].\n   <data> is a free format string that is URI [RFC3986]\
    \ compliant, and\n   that is meaningful to the authority given by the authority\
    \ field.\n   The portion of the field is case insensitive.  It is recommended\
    \ that\n   all characters not within the range of characters allowed in a URI\n\
    \   must be encoded into UTF-8 and included in the URI as a sequence of\n   escaped\
    \ octets.  An escaped octet is encoded as a character triplet,\n   consisting\
    \ of the percent character, \"%\", followed by the two\n   hexadecimal digits\
    \ representing the octet code.\n   In its entirety, the CRID is URI compliant\
    \ as specified in [RFC3986].\n   As per [RFC3986], the crid:// part of the syntax\
    \ is case insensitive.\n"

- title: 6.1.  Normative Specification
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Normative Specification\n   The Uniform Resource Locator scheme 'CRID:'\
    \ identifies the URL as the\n   TV-Anytime Content Reference Identifier and conforms\
    \ to the TV-\n   Anytime Content Referencing Specification [TVA-CR].  The TV-Anytime\n\
    \   CRID is a key component in the TV-Anytime forum specification series\n   as\
    \ described in the informative overview Systems Description\n   Specification\
    \ [TVA-Sys].  The normative Content Referencing\n   Specification [TVA-CR] also\
    \ includes the details of the contents and\n   format of the associated content\
    \ referencing tables that resolve the\n   TV-Anytime CRID into further CRID instances\
    \ or transport system-\n   dependent locations.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Role of Domain Name System (DNS) Namespace
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Role of Domain Name System (DNS) Namespace\n   Note that the use of the\
    \ registered Internet Domain does not mean\n   that the DNS resolving service\
    \ is to be employed for the resolution\n   of CRID URL.  Indeed the resolution\
    \ information is fully specified in\n   [TVA-CR] and does not require the use\
    \ of the DNS resolution service.\n   This is especially important as one key application\
    \ area is broadcast\n   television and radio distribution services that are not\
    \ Internet\n   based.\n   In business scenarios that exploit Internet connectivity\
    \ to the home,\n   the DNS portion of the CRID can be used to resolve the Internet\n\
    \   location of the service provider, who in turn will provide location\n   resolution\
    \ information in a form described in [TVA-CR].\n"
- title: 6.3.  CRID Resolving
  contents:
  - "6.3.  CRID Resolving\n   As addressed in [TVA-CR], the CRID is ultimately resolved\
    \ either\n   directly by the CRID authority or by another party.  If another party\n\
    \   is providing resolution, the ability to resolve the CRID requires the\n  \
    \ flow of some information from the authority to the resolution\n   provider,\
    \ in order to tie the CRID to its resolution.  Examples of\n   relationships between\
    \ CRID authors and the suppliers of resolution\n   information are given in [TVA-Sys].\n\
    \   As described in [TVA-CR], there will in all likelihood be more than\n   one\
    \ CRID that can resolve directly or indirectly to a given single\n   locator at\
    \ a given time.\n   Also shown in [TVA-CR], CRIDs that resolve directly to the\
    \ location\n   of the scheduled content are likely to resolve to more than one\n\
    \   location, as television and radio programmes are often published\n   repeatedly\
    \ within broadcast schedules or across different broadcast\n   services or distribution\
    \ platforms over an extended period of time.\n"

    \ of the value of each CRID is the responsibility of\n   the CRID author, as identified\
    \ through the 'authority' field.\n   The policy of assignment of CRID values lies\
    \ with the CRID author\n   associated with the authority field.  It is likely\
    \ that there will be\n   a number of diverse (and possibly changing) authoring\
    \ policies as\n   required by various organisations as they address their respective\n\
    \   audiences.  These individual policies will address resolution target\n   resource\
    \ designation issues such as the subjective equivalence of\n   programme material\

    \ CRID for collective description and resolution\n   purposes, the cross referencing\
    \ of CRID between authorities, CRID\n   lifetime, and CRID reuse.\n   It is likely\

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The CRID URL described here provides a referencing\
    \ mechanism.  The\n   values of the URL contain the authoring 'Authority' name\
    \ as a DNS\n   namespace identifier and a data portion to distinguish it from\
    \ other\n   CRIDs from the same authority.  There should be no reason to prevent\n\
    \   disclosure of the values within the CRID and no commercial\n   sensitivity\
    \ associated with these values.\n   When the binding conveyed as part of a larger\
    \ data set which may have\n   commercial value or critical binding between a CRID\
    \ and the\n   accompanying data, the security and integrity of the binding is\
    \ a\n   matter for the wider system implementers to judge and protect\n   accordingly.\
    \  One such method for protecting metadata can be found in\n   [TVA-Prt], though\
    \ it is not mandated that users adopt this.  In any\n   case, there may be other,\
    \ wider system security functions in place or\n   such precautions may not be\
    \ seen as necessary.\n   Tampering with values of CRIDs during transmission or\
    \ distribution\n   over public or open networks has only nuisance or denial-of-service\n\
    \   effects unless it causes alternative location resolution data or\n   programme\
    \ metadata to be referenced.  Again, this can be dealt with\n   as a system delivery\
    \ of data integrity issue not specific to the\n   CRID.\n   Impersonating a CRID\
    \ authority by authoring CRID with an authority\n   portion for which the bogus\
    \ author does not have permission from the\n   registered DNS name holder would\
    \ be a misuse of the DNS name holder's\n   identity and should be dealt with through\
    \ normal business practice.\n"
