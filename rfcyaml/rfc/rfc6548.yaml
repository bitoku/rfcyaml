  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the function and responsibilities of the\
    \ RFC\n   Independent Submission Editor (ISE).  The Independent Submission\n \
    \  stream is one of the stream producers that create draft RFCs, with\n   the\
    \ ISE as its stream approver.  The ISE is overall responsible for\n   activities\
    \ within the Independent Submission stream, working with\n   draft editors and\
    \ reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production\n   Center and Publisher, and\
    \ the RFC Series Editor (RSE).  The ISE is\n   appointed by the IAB, and also\
    \ interacts with the IETF Administrative\n   Oversight Committee (IAOC).\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RFC Editor Model [RFC6635] defines a set of streams\
    \ that produce\n   draft RFCs, which are submitted for publication.  This document\n\
    \   defines the management function for the Independent Submission\n   stream,\
    \ specifically the role of Independent Submission Editor (ISE).\n   This document\
    \ is a derivative of [RFC5620], Section 3.2, and was\n   separated out from [RFC6635].\n\
    \   This document obsoletes [RFC5620] in combination with [RFC6635].\n"
- title: 2.  Independent Submission Editor
  contents:
  - "2.  Independent Submission Editor\n   The ISE is an individual who is responsible\
    \ for the Independent\n   Submission stream of RFCs, as defined by [RFC4844].\
    \  The Independent\n   Submission stream and the ISE are not under the authority\
    \ or\n   direction of the RSE or the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)\n \
    \  (see [RFC6635]).  As noted below, the ISE is appointed by and is\n   responsible\
    \ directly to the IAB.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Qualifications
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Qualifications\n   The ISE is a senior position for which the following\
    \ qualifications\n   are desired:\n   1.  Technical competence, i.e., broad technical\
    \ experience and\n       perspective across a wide range of Internet technologies\
    \ and\n       applications, and also the ability to work effectively with\n  \
    \     portions of that spectrum in which they have no personal\n       expertise.\n\
    \   2.  Thorough familiarity with the RFC series.\n   3.  An ability to define\
    \ and constitute advisory and document review\n       arrangements.  If those\
    \ arrangements include an Editorial Board\n       similar to the current one or\
    \ some equivalent arrangement, the\n       ability to assess the technical competence\
    \ of potential Editorial\n       Board members (see Section 3).\n   4.  Good standing\
    \ in the technical community, in and beyond the IETF.\n   5.  Demonstrated editorial\
    \ skills, good command of the English\n       language, and demonstrated history\
    \ of being able to work\n       effectively with technical documents and materials\
    \ created by\n       others.\n   6.  The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor\
    \ environment with\n       divided authority and responsibility similar to that\
    \ described in\n       [RFC6635].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Responsibilities\n   The ISE is an individual who may have assistants and\
    \ who is\n   responsible for:\n   1.  Maintaining technical quality of the Independent\
    \ Submission\n       stream.\n   2.  Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent\
    \ Submissions.\n   3.  Forwarding draft RFCs in the Independent Submission stream\
    \ to the\n       RFC Production Center.\n   4.  Defining and developing the scope\
    \ of the Independent Submission\n       stream as a part of the overall RFC Editor\
    \ function [RFC6635].\n   5.  Reviewing and approving RFC errata for Independent\
    \ Submissions.\n   6.  Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series\
    \ policies\n       as specified by the IAB and RSE.\n   7.  Providing statistics\
    \ and documentation as requested by the RSE\n       and/or IAOC.\n   The ISE may\
    \ choose to select individuals to participate in an\n   Advisory Board for assistance\
    \ in special topics as the ISE deems\n   appropriate.  Such an Advisory Board\
    \ exists at the pleasure of the\n   ISE, and its members serve at the pleasure\
    \ of the ISE.\n   The individual with the listed qualifications is selected by\
    \ the IAB\n   after input has been collected from the community.  An approach\n\
    \   similar to the one used by the IAB to select an IAOC member every\n   other\
    \ year as described in [RFC4333] should be used.\n   While the ISE itself is considered\
    \ a volunteer function, the IAB\n   considers maintaining the Independent Submission\
    \ stream part of the\n   IAB's supported activities.  Therefore, the IAOC should\
    \ include these\n   costs in the IASA budget.\n"
- title: 3.  Independent Submission Editorial Board
  contents:
  - "3.  Independent Submission Editorial Board\n   The ISE is supported by an Editorial\
    \ Board for the review of\n   Independent Submission stream documents.  This board\
    \ is known as the\n   Independent Submission Editorial Board.  This volunteer\
    \ Editorial\n   Board exists at the pleasure of the ISE, and its members serve\
    \ at the\n   pleasure of the ISE.  The existence of this board is simply noted\n\
    \   within this model, and additional discussion of such is considered\n   out\
    \ of scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document has no specific security implications,\
    \ however the same\n   security considerations as those in [RFC4846] and [RFC4844]\
    \ apply.\n"
