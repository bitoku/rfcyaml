Abstract This specification defines an extension to the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with SNMP based network management.
In particular, it defines objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant with SMIv2 [5], and semantically identical to the SMIv1 definitions [2].
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components: An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
This memo identifies the set of objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), as defined in RFC 2338 [17].
VRRP specifies an election protocol that will allow one or more associated IP addresses to be assumed by another router in the event of a failure of the IP address(es) owner.
Thus, IP traffic from a host using a failed router as a default gateway is transparently fowarded by the VRRP router that has assumed control.
VRRP provides redundancy in routed networks without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end host.
Since the VRRP protocol is intended for use with IPv4 routers only, this MIB uses the SYNTAX for IP addresses which is specific to IPv4.
Thus, changes will be required for this MIB to interoperate in an IPv6 environment.
The VRRP MIB contains three conformance groups:
vrrpOperations Group: Objects related to VRRP router's configuration and control.
vrrpStatistics Group: Objects containing information useful in monitoring the operation of VRRP routers.
vrrpNotifications Group: Consists of objects and definitions for use in SNMP notifications sent by VRRP routers.
Tables in the MIB include the following: (1)
The vrrpOperTable, which contains objects that define the operational characteristics of a VRRP router.
Rows in this table correspond to instances of virtual routers.
The vrrpAssoIpAddrTable, which contains the addresses of the virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up.
The vrrpRouterStatsTable which contains the operating statistics for a VRRP router.
This MIB is based on the following characteristics of VRRP as defined in the VRRP specification [17].
A "VRRP router" is one that is configured to run the VRRP protocol in conjunction with one or more other VRRP routers attached to a LAN.
A VRRP router can be running one or more instances of a virtual router.
A "virtual router" is an abstraction which consists of two or more physical routers associated by a Virtual Router Identifier (VRID).
An instance of a virtual router (on a physical VRRP router), can be uniquely identified by a combination of the 'ifIndex' [18] and "Virtual Router Identifier" (VRID).
For each VRID there is a set of one or more "associated IP addresses" that are backed up by the virtual router.
The tables in the VRRP MIB are structured with the assumption that a VRRP network management application would likely be designed to display information or provide configuration about a VRRP router on a "per virtual router basis".
Thus, the tables defined in the MIB consist of conceptual rows which are grouped in a manner to present a view of individual virtual routers with a minimal number of SNMP operations.
Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more physical interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in the VRRP MIB.
The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in this MIB are instantiated for two different VRRP scenarios.
The following figure shows a simple network with two VRRP routers configured with two virtual routers.
This sample topology is taken from the VRRP specification [17].
In the diagram, "Interface" is used in the context defined in IF MIB [18].
For "State": M   Master; B   Backup.
In the vrrpOperTable, a "priority" of 255 indicates that the respective router owns the IP address, e.g., this IP address is native to the router (i.e., "the IP Address Owner" [17]).
The following figure shows a simple network with two virtual routers.
Here, a single interface has been configured with two IP addresses.
Again, addresses in () indicate the IP address of the default gateway for a given host, H1 H2.

This MIB describes objects used for managing Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) routers.
A number which, along with an interface index (ifIndex), serves to uniquely identify a virtual router on a given VRRP router.
A set of one or more associated addresses is assigned to a VRID.
"This value identifies the particular version of the VRRP supported by this node."
"Indicates whether the VRRP enabled router
will generate SNMP traps for events defined in this MIB. '
Enabled' results in SNMP traps; 'disabled', no traps are sent."
An entry in the vrrpOperTable containing the operational characteristics of a virtual router.
On a VRRP router, a given virtual router is identified by a combination of the IF index and VRID.
Rows in the table cannot be modified unless the value of `vrrpOperAdminState' is `disabled' and the `vrrpOperState' has transitioned to `initialize'.

OCTET STRING, vrrpOperAdvertisementInterval Integer32, vrrpOperPreemptMode TruthValue, vrrpOperVirtualRouterUpTime TimeStamp, vrrpOperProtocol INTEGER, vrrpOperRowStatus RowStatus } vrrpOperVrId OBJECT
This object contains the Virtual Router Identifier (VRID)."
The virtual MAC address of the virtual router.
Although this object can be derived from the 'vrrpOperVrId' object, it is defined so that it is easily obtainable by a management application and can be included in VRRP related SNMP traps."
The current state of the virtual router.
This object has three defined values: `initialize', which indicates that all the virtual router is waiting for a startup event.
`backup', which indicates the virtual router is monitoring the availability of the master router.
`master', which indicates that the virtual router is forwarding packets for IP addresses that are associated with this router.
Setting the `vrrpOperAdminState' object (below) initiates transitions in the value of this object."
"This object will enable/disable the virtual router function.
Setting the value to `up', will transition the state of the virtual router from `initialize' to `backup' or `master', depending on the value of `vrrpOperPriority'.
Setting the value to `down', will transition  the router from `master' or `backup' to `initialize'.
State transitions may not be immediate; they sometimes depend on other factors, such as the interface (IF) state.
The `vrrpOperAdminState' object must be set to `down' prior to modifying the other read create objects in the conceptual row.
The value of the `vrrpOperRowStatus' object (below) must be `active', signifying that the conceptual row is valid (i.e., the objects are correctly set), in order for this object to be set to `up'."
"This object specifies the priority to be used for the virtual router master election process.
Higher values imply higher priority.
A priority of '0', although not settable, is sent by the master router to indicate that this router has ceased to participate in VRRP and a backup virtual router should transition  to become a new master.
A priority of 255 is used for the router that owns the associated IP address(es).
"The number of IP addresses that are associated with this virtual router.
This number is equal to the number of rows in the vrrpAssoIpAddrTable that correspond to a given IF index/VRID pair."
This is the IP address listed as the source in VRRP advertisement last received by this virtual router."
In the case where there is more than one IP address for a given `ifIndex', this object is used to specify the IP address that will become the `vrrpOperMasterIpAddr', should the virtual router transition from backup to master.
If this object is set to 0.0.0.0, the IP address which is numerically lowest will be selected.
VRRP protocol exchanges are not   authenticated.
Exchanges are authenticated using   the IP authentication header. }
This value of this object is the same for a given ifIndex.
New enumerations to this list can only be added via a new RFC on the standards track."
This object is set according to the value of the 'vrrpOperAuthType' object ('simpleTextPassword' or 'ipAuthenticationHeader').
If the length of the value is less than 16 octets, the agent will left adjust and zero fill to 16 octets.
The value of this object is the same for a given ifIndex.
When read, vrrpOperAuthKey always returns an Octet String of length zero."
"The time interval, in seconds, between sending advertisement messages.
Only the master router sends VRRP advertisements.
"This is the value of the `sysUpTime' object when this virtual router (i.e., the `vrrpOperState') transitioned out of `initialized'."
INTEGER { ip (1), bridge (2), decnet (3), other (4) }
"The particular protocol being controlled by this Virtual Router.
New enumerations to this list can only be added via a new RFC on the standards track."
The rowstatus of a currently active row in the vrrpOperTable is constrained by the operational state of the corresponding virtual router.
When `vrrpOperRowStatus' is set to active(1), no other objects in the conceptual row, with the exception of `vrrpOperAdminState', can be modified.
Prior to setting the `vrrpOperRowStatus' object from `active' to a different value, the `vrrpOperAdminState' object must be set to `down' and
the `vrrpOperState' object be transitioned to `initialize'.
To create a row in this table, a manager sets this object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).
Until instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the `vrrpOperRowStatus' column will be read as notReady(3).
In particular, a newly created row cannot be made active(1) until (minimally)
The table of addresses associated with this virtual router."
An entry in the table contains an IP address that is associated with a virtual router.
The number of rows for a given ifIndex and VrId will equal the number of IP addresses associated (e.g., backed up) by the virtual router (equivalent to 'vrrpOperIpAddrCount').
Rows in the table cannot be modified unless the value of `vrrpOperAdminState' is `disabled' and the `vrrpOperState' has transitioned to `initialize'.
The assigned IP addresses that a virtual router is responsible for backing up."
Setting this object to active(1) or createAndGo(4) results in the addition of an associated address for a virtual router.
Destroying the entry or setting it to notInService(2) removes the associated address from the virtual router.
The use of other values is implementation dependent."

"The total number of VRRP packets received with an unknown or unsupported version number."
"The total number of VRRP packets received with an invalid VRID for this virtual router."

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable to security attacks in some networking environments.
The support for SET operations in a non  secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on VRRP router operations.
A number of objects in the vrrpOperTable possess the read create attribute.
Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the operation of a virtual router.
Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to: The vrrpOperAdminState object which could be used to disable a virtual router.
The vrrpOperPrimaryIpAddr object which, if compromised, could allow assignment of an invalid IP address to a master router.
The authentication type/key related objects which could potentially render the VRRP security mechanisms ineffective.
Of additional concern is the ability to disable the transmission of traps.
This would nullify the capability of a virtual router to provide notification in the event of an authentication failure.
by itself is not a secure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574
[RFC2574] and the View  based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
