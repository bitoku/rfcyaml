- title: 1. Justification
  contents:
  - "1. Justification\n   With the advent of OSPF and IS-IS, there are those who believe\
    \ that\n   RIP is obsolete.  While it is true that the newer IGP routing\n   protocols\
    \ are far superior to RIP, RIP does have some advantages.\n   Primarily, in a\
    \ small network, RIP has very little overhead in terms\n   of bandwidth used and\
    \ configuration and management time.  RIP is also\n   very easy to implement,\
    \ especially in relation to the newer IGPs.\n   Additionally, there are many,\
    \ many more RIP implementations in the\n   field than OSPF and IS-IS combined.\
    \  It is likely to remain that way\n   for some years yet.\n   Given that RIP\
    \ will be useful in many environments for some period of\n   time, it is reasonable\
    \ to increase RIP's usefulness.  This is\n   especially true since the gain is\
    \ far greater than the expense of the\n   change.\n"
- title: 2. Current RIP
  contents:
  - "2. Current RIP\n   The current RIP packet contains the minimal amount of information\n\
    \   necessary for routers to route packets through a network.  It also\n   contains\
    \ a large amount of unused space, owing to its origins.\n   The current RIP protocol\
    \ does not consider autonomous systems and\n   IGP/EGP interactions, subnetting,\
    \ and authentication since\n   implementations of these postdate RIP.  The lack\
    \ of subnet masks is a\n   particularly serious problem for routers since they\
    \ need a subnet\n   mask to know how to determine a route.  If a RIP route is\
    \ a network\n   route (all non-network bits 0), the subnet mask equals the network\n\
    \   mask.  However, if some of the non-network bits are set, the router\n   cannot\
    \ determine the subnet mask.  Worse still, the router cannot\n   determine if\
    \ the RIP route is a subnet route or a host route.\n   Currently, some routers\
    \ simply choose the subnet mask of the\n   interface over which the route was\
    \ learned and determine the route\n   type from that.\n"
- title: 3. Protocol Extensions
  contents:
  - "3. Protocol Extensions\n   This document does not change the RIP protocol per\
    \ se.  Rather, it\n   provides extensions to the datagram format which allows\
    \ routers to\n   share important additional information.\n   The new RIP datagram\
    \ format is:\n    0                   1                   2                  \

    \   The Command, Address Family Identifier (AFI), IP Address, and Metric\n   all\
    \ have the meanings defined in RFC 1058.  The Version field will\n   specify version\
    \ number 2 for RIP datagrams which use authentication\n   or carry information\
    \ in any of the newly defined fields.\n   All fields are coded in IP network byte\
    \ order (big-endian).\n"
- title: 3.1 Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.1 Authentication\n   Since authentication is a per packet function, and since\
    \ there is\n   only one 2-byte field available in the packet header, and since\
    \ any\n   reasonable authentication scheme will require more than two bytes,\n\
    \   the authentication scheme for RIP version 2 will use the space of an\n   entire\
    \ RIP entry.  If the Address Family Identifier of the first (and\n   only the\
    \ first) entry in the packet is 0xFFFF, then the remainder of\n   the entry contains\
    \ the authentication.  This means that there can be,\n   at most, 24 RIP entries\
    \ in the remainder of the packet.  If\n   authentication is not in use, then no\
    \ entries in the packet should\n   have an Address Family Identifier of 0xFFFF.\
    \  A RIP packet which\n   contains an authentication entry would have the following\
    \ format:\n    0                   1                   2                   3 3\n\

    \   Currently, the only Authentication Type is simple password and it is\n   type\
    \ 2.  The remaining 16 bytes contain the plain text password.  If\n   the password\
    \ is under 16 bytes, it must be left-justified and padded\n   to the right with\
    \ nulls (0x00).\n"
- title: 3.2 Routing Domain
  contents:
  - "3.2 Routing Domain\n   The Routing Domain (RD) number is the number of the routing\
    \ process\n   to which this update belongs.  This field is used to associate the\n\
    \   routing update to a specific routing process on the receiving router.\n  \
    \ The RD is needed to allow multiple, independent RIP \"clouds\" to co-\n   exist\
    \ on the same physical wire.  This gives administrators the\n   ability to run\
    \ multiple, possibly parallel, instances of RIP in order\n   to implement simple\
    \ policy.  This means that a router operating\n   within one routing domain, or\
    \ a set of routing domains, should ignore\n   RIP packets which belong to another\
    \ routing domain.  RD 0 is the\n   default routing domain.\n"
- title: 3.3 Route Tag
  contents:
  - "3.3 Route Tag\n   The Route Tag (RT) field exists as a support for EGPs.  The\
    \ contents\n   and use of this field are outside the scope of this protocol.\n\
    \   However, it is expected that the field will be used to carry\n   Autonomous\
    \ System numbers for EGP and BGP.  Any RIP system which\n   receives a RIP entry\
    \ which contains a non-zero RT value must re-\n   advertise that value.  Those\
    \ routes which have no RT value must\n   advertise an RT value of zero.\n"
- title: 3.4 Subnet mask
  contents:
  - "3.4 Subnet mask\n   The Subnet Mask field contains the subnet mask which is applied\
    \ to\n   the IP address to yield the non-host portion of the address.  If this\n\
    \   field is zero, then no subnet mask has been included for this entry.\n   On\
    \ an interface where a RIP-1 router may hear and operate on the\n   information\
    \ in a RIP-2 routing entry the following two rules apply:\n   1) information internal\
    \ to one network must never be advertised into\n      another network, and\n \
    \  2) information about a more specific subnet may not be advertised\n      where\
    \ RIP-1 routers would consider it a host route.\n"
- title: 3.5 Next Hop
  contents:
  - "3.5 Next Hop\n   The immediate next hop IP address to which packets to the destination\n\
    \   specified by this route entry should be forwarded.  Specifying a\n   value\
    \ of 0.0.0.0 in this field indicates that routing should be via\n   the originator\
    \ of the RIP advertisement.  An address specified as a\n   next hop must, per\
    \ force, be directly reachable on the logical subnet\n   over which the advertisement\
    \ is made.\n   The purpose of the Next Hop field is to eliminate packets being\n\
    \   routed through extra hops in the system.  It is particularly useful\n   when\
    \ RIP is not being run on all of the routers on a network.  A\n   simple example\
    \ is given in Appendix A.  Note that Next Hop is an\n   \"advisory\" field.  That\
    \ is, if the provided information is ignored, a\n   possibly sub-optimal, but\
    \ absolutely valid, route may be taken.\n"
- title: 3.6 Multicasting
  contents:
  - "3.6 Multicasting\n   In order to reduce unnecessary load on those hosts which\
    \ are not\n   listening to RIP-2 packets, an IP multicast address will be used\
    \ for\n   periodic broadcasts.  The IP multicast address is 224.0.0.9.  Note\n\
    \   that IGMP is not needed since these are inter-router messages which\n   are\
    \ not forwarded.\n   In order to maintain backwards compatibility, the use of\
    \ the\n   multicast address will be configurable, as described in section 4.1.\n\
    \   If multicasting is used, it should be used on all interfaces which\n   support\
    \ it.\n"
- title: 4. Compatibility
  contents:
  - "4. Compatibility\n   RFC 1058 showed considerable forethought in its specification\
    \ of the\n   handling of version numbers.  It specifies that RIP packets of\n\
    \   version 0 are to be discarded, that RIP packets of version 1 are to\n   be\
    \ discarded if any Must Be Zero (MBZ) field is non-zero, and that\n   RIP packets\
    \ of any version greater than 1 should not be discarded\n   simply because an\
    \ MBZ field contains a value other than zero.  This\n   means that the new version\
    \ of RIP is totally backwards compatible\n   with existing RIP implementations\
    \ which adhere to this part of the\n   specification.\n"
- title: 4.1 Compatibility Switch
  contents:
  - "4.1 Compatibility Switch\n   A compatibility switch is necessary for two reasons.\
    \  First, there\n   are implementations of RIP-1 in the field which do not follow\
    \ RFC\n   1058 as described above.  Second, the use of multicasting would\n  \
    \ prevent RIP-1 systems from receiving RIP-2 updates (which may be a\n   desired\
    \ feature in some cases).\n   The switch has three settings: RIP-1, in which only\
    \ RIP-1 packets are\n   sent; RIP-1 compatibility, in which RIP-2 packets are\
    \ broadcast; and\n   RIP-2, in which RIP-2 packets are multicast.  The recommended\
    \ default\n   for this switch is RIP-1 compatibility.\n"
- title: 4.2 Authentication
  contents:
  - "4.2 Authentication\n   Since an authentication entry is marked with an Address\
    \ Family\n   Identifier of 0xFFFF, a RIP-1 system would ignore this entry since\
    \ it\n   would belong to an address family other than IP.  It should be noted,\n\
    \   therefore, that use of authentication will not prevent RIP-1 systems\n   from\
    \ seeing RIP-2 packets.  If desired, this may be done using\n   multicasting,\
    \ as described in sections 3.6 and 4.1.\n"
- title: 4.3 Larger Infinity
  contents:
  - "4.3 Larger Infinity\n   While on the subject of compatibility, there is one item\
    \ which people\n   have requested: increasing infinity.  The primary reason that\
    \ this\n   cannot be done is that it would violate backwards compatibility.  A\n\
    \   larger infinity would obviously confuse older versions of rip.  At\n   best,\
    \ they would ignore the route as they would ignore a metric of\n   16.  There\
    \ was also a proposal to make the Metric a single byte and\n   reuse the high\
    \ three bytes, but this would break any implementations\n   which treat the metric\
    \ as a long.\n"
