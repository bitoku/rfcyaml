Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP  based management of MCNS/DOCSIS compliant Radio Frequency (RF) interfaces.
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP
The set of objects are consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force.
Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@terayon.com and/or the author.
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB MUST be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification process.
CATV Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals to a community.
Channel A specific frequency allocation with an RF medium, specified by channel width in Hertz (cycles per second) and by center frequency.
Within the US Cable Systems, upstream channels are generally allocated from the 5 42MHz range while down stream channels are generally allocated from the 50 750MHz range depending on the capabilities of the given system.
The typical broadcast channel width in the US is 6MHz.
Upstream channel widths for DOCSIS vary.
A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.
CMTS   Cable Modem Termination System.
A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head end.
A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.
It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated CMs.
A characteristic of the Foward Error Correction scheme used above the RF media layer.
The payload portion of the MAC Packet.
dBmV Decibel relative to one milli volt.
A measure of RF power.
DOCSIS "Data Over Cable Interface Specification".
A term referring to the ITU T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem systems [20].
The direction from the head end towards the subscriber.
Head end The origination point in most cable systems of the subscriber video signals.
MAC Packet A DOCSIS PDU.
MCNS "Multimedia Cable Network System".
Generally replaced in usage by DOCSIS.
In general, an interval of time which is allocated by the CMTS to a given CM for that CM to transmit in an upstream direction.
A particular modulation scheme on an RF medium.
A particular modulation scheme on on RF medium.
Usually expressed with a number indicating the size of the modulation constellation (e.g. 16 QAM).
See [19], or any other book on digital communications over RF for a complete explanation of this.
A characteristic of the RF modulation scheme. 2.18.
The direction from the subscriber towards the head end.
This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of MCNS/DOCSIS compliant Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS)
The specification is derived in part from the parameters and protocols described in DOCSIS Radio Frequency Interface Specification [16].
This MIB is structured as three groups:
Management information pertinent to both Cable Modems (CM) and Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS) (docsIfBaseObjects).
Management information pertinent to Cable Modems only (docsIfCmObjects).
Management information pertinent to Cable Modem Termination Systems only (docsIfCmtsObjects).
Tables within each of these groups group objects functionally e.g. Quality of Service, Channel characteristics, MAC layer management, etc.
Rows created automatically (e.g. by the device according to the hardware configuration)
may and generally will have a mixture of configuration and status objects within them.
Rows that are meant to be created by the management station are generally restricted to configuration (read create) objects.
This table describes the active downstream channels for a CMTS and the received downstream channel for a CM.
This table describes the active upstream channels for a a CMTS and the current upstream transmission channel for a CM.
This table describes the valid Quality of Service service profiles for the cable data system.
This table is used to monitor RF signal quality characteristics of received signals.
This table is used to monitor the DOCSIS MAC interface and can be considered an extension to the ifEntry.
This table describes the upstream service queues available at this CM.
There is a comparable table at the CMTS, docsIfCmtsServiceEntry, which describes the service queues from the point of view of the CMTS.
This table provides a set of aggregated counters which roll up values and events that occur on the underlying sub interfaces.
docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable This table is used to hold information about known (e.g. registered) cable modems on the system serviced by this CMTS.
This table provides access to the information related to upstream service queues.
This table allows control over the modulation profiles for RF channels associated with this CMTS.
This table allows fast access into the docsIfCmtsCmTable via a MAC address (of the CM) interface.
Relationship to the Interfaces MIB
This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the Interfaces MIB [17].
Several areas of correlation are addressed in the following subsections.
The implementor is referred to the Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general intent of these areas.
An instance of ifEntry exists for each RF Downstream interface, for each RF Upstream interface, and for each RF MAC layer.
[17] MUST be implemented to identify relationships among sub interfaces.
The following example illustrates a MAC interface with one downstream and two upstream channels.
As can be seen from this example, the RF MAC interface is layered on top of the downstream and upstream interfaces.
In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows:
CATV MAC Layer 2    docsCableDownstream(128)
CATV Downstream interface 3    docsCableUpstream(129)
CATV Upstream interface 4    docsCableUpstream(129)
The corresponding ifStack entries would then be:
The same interface model can also be used in Telephony or Telco Return systems.
A pure Telco Return system (Cable Modem as well as Cable Modem Termination System) would not have upstream, but only downstream cable channels.
Systems supporting both Telco Return and cable upstream channels can use the above model without modification.
Telco Return Upstream channel(s) are handled by the appropriate MIBs, such as PPP or Modem MIBs.
This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not applicable to this MIB.

current DESCRIPTION "Group of objects implemented in Cable Modem Termination Systems."
This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public internet access.
As such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large number of end users.
In addition, manipulation of the docsIfCmServiceQosProfile, docsIfCmtsServerQosProfile, and the elements of docsIfQosProfileTable may allow an end user to improve their service response or decrease other subscriber service response.
This MIB does not affect confidentiality, authentication or authorization of services on a cable modem system.
For authentication and authorization, please see the related document "Cable Device Management Information Base for DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems" [18].
For confidentiality, the working group expects to issue a MIB which describes the management of the DOCSIS Baseline Privacy mechanism.
