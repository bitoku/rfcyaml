- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A frame relay (FR) network provides virtual circuits (VCs)\
    \ to\n   interconnect attached devices. Each VC is uniquely identified at each\n\
    \   FR interface by a Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI).  RFC 1294\n   specifies\
    \ the encapsulation of multiprotocol traffic over FR [1].\n   The devices on a\
    \ FR network may either be fully interconnected with a\n   \"mesh\" of VCs, or\
    \ partially interconnected.  OSPF characterizes FR\n   networks as non-broadcast\
    \ multiple access (NBMA) because they can\n   support more than two attached routers,\
    \ but do not have a broadcast\n   capability [2].  Under the NBMA model, the physical\
    \ FR interface on a\n   router corresponds to a single OSPF interface through\
    \ which the\n   router is connected to one or more neighbors on the FR network;\
    \ all\n   the neighboring routers must also be directly connected to each other\n\
    \   over the FR network.  Hence OSPF implementations that use the NBMA\n   model\
    \ for FR do not work when the routers are partially\n   interconnected.  Further,\
    \ the topological representation of a\n   multiple access network has each attached\
    \ router bi-directionally\n   connected to the network vertex with a single link\
    \ metric assigned to\n   the edge directed into the vertex.\n   We see that the\
    \ NBMA model becomes more restrictive as the number of\n   routers connected to\
    \ the network increases. First, the number of VCs\n   required for full-mesh connectivity\
    \ increases quadratically with the\n   number of routers. Public FR services typically\
    \ offer performance\n   guarantees for each VC provisioned by the service. This\
    \ means that\n   real physical resources in the FR network are devoted to each\
    \ VC, and\n   for this the customer eventually pays. The expense for full-mesh\n\
    \   connectivity thus grows quadratically with the number of\n   interconnected\
    \ routers.  We need to build OSPF implementations that\n   allow for partial connectivity\
    \ over FR.  Second, using a single link\n   metric (per TOS) for the FR interface\
    \ does not allow OSPF to weigh\n   some VCs more heavily than others according\
    \ to the performance\n   characteristics of each connection. To make efficient\
    \ use of the FR\n   network resources, it should be possible to assign different\
    \ link\n   metrics to different VCs.\n   These limitations of the current OSPF\
    \ model for FR become more severe\n   as the network size increases, and render\
    \ FR technology less cost\n   effective than it could be for large networks. We\
    \ propose solutions\n   to these problems that do not increase complexity by much\
    \ and do not\n   require any changes to the OSPF protocol.\n"
- title: 2.  Summary of Recommendations
  contents:
  - "2.  Summary of Recommendations\n   We propose expanding the general view of an\
    \ OSPF interface to account\n   for its functional type (point-to-point, broadcast,\
    \ NBMA) rather than\n   its physical type. In most instances, the physical network\
    \ can only\n   serve one function and can only be defined as one type of OSPF\n\
    \   interface. For multiplexed interfaces such as FR however, logical\n   connections\
    \ between routers can serve different functions. Hence one\n   VC on a FR interface\
    \ can be viewed distintly from other VCs on the\n   same physical interface. \
    \ The solution requires that OSPF be able to\n   support logical interfaces (networks)\
    \ as well as physical interfaces.\n   Each logical network can be either point-to-point,\
    \ that is, a single\n   VC, or NBMA, that is, a collection of VCs.  It is not\
    \ necessary to\n   define new interface types for logical networks, since the\
    \ operation\n   of the protocol over logical point-to-point networks and logical\
    \ NBMA\n   networks remains the same as for the corresponding physical networks.\n\
    \   For instance, logical point-to-point links could be numbered or\n   unnumbered.\
    \  It is only necessary for implementations to provide the\n   hooks that give\
    \ users the ability to configure an individual VC as a\n   logical point-to-point\
    \ network or a collection of VCs as a logical\n   NBMA network.\n   The NBMA model\
    \ does provide some economy in OSPF protocol processing\n   and overhead and is\
    \ the recommended mode of operation for small\n   homogeneous networks. Other\
    \ than the Designated Router (DR) and the\n   backup Designated Router (BDR),\
    \ each router maintains only two\n   adjacencies, one each with the DR and BDR,\
    \ regardless of the size of\n   the NBMA network.  When FR VCs are configured\
    \ as point-to-point\n   links, a router would have many more adjacencies to maintain,\n\
    \   resulting in increased protocol overhead. If all VCs were to have\n   comparable\
    \ performance characteristics as well, there may not be\n   compelling reasons\
    \ to assign a different link metric to each VC.\n"
- title: 3.  Implementing OSPF over FR
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementing OSPF over FR\n   We recommend that OSPF router implementations\
    \ be built so that\n   administrators can configure network layer interfaces that\
    \ consist of\n   one or more FR VCs within a single physical interface.  Each\
    \ logical\n   network interface could then be configured as the appropriate type\
    \ of\n   OSPF interface, that is, point-to-point for a single VC, or NBMA for\n\
    \   a collection of VCs.  This capability would allow a router to belong\n   to\
    \ one or more distinct IP subnets on a single physical FR interface.\n   Thus,\
    \ it is necessary that the router be able to support multiple IP\n   addresses\
    \ on a single physical FR interface.  As with physical NBMA\n   networks, logical\
    \ NBMA networks must be full-mesh connected. While\n   logical point-to-point\
    \ links can be either numbered or unnumbered, we\n   show that it is easier to\
    \ implement routers to handle numbered\n   logical point-to-point links.\n"
- title: 3.1  Numbered Logical Interfaces
  contents:
  - "3.1  Numbered Logical Interfaces\n   The router administrator should be able\
    \ to configure numbered logical\n   interfaces over FR as follows:\n     STEP\
    \ 1: Configure the physical interface specifying relevant\n             parameters\
    \ such as the slot, connector, and port numbers,\n             physical frame\
    \ format, encoding, and clock mode. In its\n             internal interface MIB\
    \ [3], the router should create a new\n             ifEntry in the ifTable, assign\
    \ the physical interface an\n             ifIndex, and increment the ifNumber\
    \ by one.\n     STEP 2: Configure the data-link layer over the interface,\n  \
    \           specifying frame relay as the encapsulation method.\n            \
    \ Parameters such as the DLCI encoding type and length,\n             maximum\
    \ frame size, management interface (Annex D, LMI),\n             and address resolution\
    \ procedure (manual, inverse ARP). If\n             a management interface is\
    \ not supported, FR VCs must be\n             configured manually.\n     STEP\
    \ 3: Configure the IP network layer for the interface by\n             specifying\
    \ the number of logical interfaces and the IP\n             address and subnet\
    \ mask for each numbered logical\n             interface. Specify the VCs (by\
    \ DLCI) associated with each\n             logical network interface if there\
    \ is more than one.  If an\n             address resolution protocol such as \
    \ Inverse ARP [4] is\n             being used, it should suffice to specify a\
    \ list of IP\n             addresses for the FR interface and have Inverse ARP\
    \ create\n             the DLCI-IP address binding.\n     STEP 4: Configure OSPF\
    \ to run over each logical interface as\n             appropriate, specifying\
    \ the necessary interface parameters\n             such as area ID, link metric,\
    \ protocol timers and\n             intervals, DR priority, and list of neighbors\
    \ (for the DR).\n             OSPF interfaces consisting of one VC can be treated\
    \ as\n             point-to-point links while multi-VC OSPF interfaces are\n \
    \            treated as NBMA subnets. In its internal OSPF MIB [5], the\n    \
    \         router should create additional entries in the ospfIfTable\n       \
    \      each with the appropriate ospfIfType (nbma or\n             pointTopoint).\n"
- title: 3.2  Unnumbered Point-to-Point Logical Interfaces
  contents:
  - "3.2  Unnumbered Point-to-Point Logical Interfaces\n   OSPF uses the IP address\
    \ to instance each numbered interface.\n   However, since an unnumbered point-to-point\
    \ link does not have an IP\n   address, the ifIndex from the interface MIB is\
    \ used instead [5].\n   This is straightforward for a physical point-to-point\
    \ network, since\n   the ifIndex is assigned when the interface is configured.\
    \  Logical\n   interfaces over FR however, do not have distinct and unique values\n\
    \   for ifIndex. To allow OSPF to instance unnumbered logical point-to-\n   point\
    \ links, it is necessary to assign each such link a unique\n   ifIndex in STEP\
    \ 3 above. This could lead to some confusion in the\n   interfaces table since\
    \ a new ifTable entry would have to be created\n   for each logical point-to-point\
    \ link. This type of departure from the\n   standard practice of creating interface\
    \ table entries only for\n   physical interfaces could be viewed as an unnecessary\
    \ complication.\n   Alternatively, it is possible to build a private MIB that\
    \ contains\n   data structures to instance unnumbered logical links. However,\
    \ making\n   recommendations for the structure and use of such a private MIB is\n\
    \   beyond the scope of this work.  Even if unnumbered point-to-point\n   logical\
    \ links were implemented in this manner, it would still be\n   necessary to allow\
    \ a FR interface to be configured with multiple IP\n   addresses when a router\
    \ is connected to multiple NBMA subnets through\n   a single physical interface.\
    \  Hence, while it is possible to define\n   unnumbered logical point-to-point\
    \ links in OSPF, we find this\n   alternative less attractive than using numbered\
    \ logical point-to-\n   point links.\n"
- title: 4.  Using OSPF over FR
  contents:
  - "4.  Using OSPF over FR\n   The ability to configure distinct logical interfaces\
    \ over FR gives\n   users a great deal of flexibility in designing FR networks\
    \ for use\n   with OSPF. Because routers can be partially interconnected over\
    \ FR,\n   it is possible to design networks more cost-effectively than before.\n\
    \   The issues to consider are the price/cost structure for VCs (fixed,\n   distance-sensitive,\
    \ banded) and ports, performance guarantees\n   provided, traffic distribution\
    \ (local, long-haul), and protocol\n   efficiency. We have mentioned that the\
    \ NBMA model provides some\n   economy in OSPF protocol processing and overhead\
    \ and is recommended\n   for small homogeneous networks. In general, users should\
    \ configure\n   their networks to contain several small \"NBMA clusters,\" which\
    \ are in\n   turn interconnected by long-haul VCs. The best choices for the number\n\
    \   of routers in each cluster and the size of the long-haul logical\n   point-to-point\
    \ links depends on the factors mentioned above. If it is\n   necessary to architect\
    \ a more \"flat\" network, the ability to assign\n   different link metrics to\
    \ different (groups of) VCs allows for\n   greater efficiency in using FR resources\
    \ since VCs with better\n   performance characteristics (throughput, delay) could\
    \ be assigned\n   lower link metrics.\n"
- title: 5.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "5.  Conclusion\n   We have specified guidelines for OSPF implementors and users\
    \ to bring\n   about improvements in how the protocol runs over frame relay\n\
    \   networks. These recommendations do not require any protocol changes\n   and\
    \ allow for simpler, more efficient and cost-effective network\n   designs. We\
    \ recommend that OSPF implementations be able to support\n   logical interfaces,\
    \ each consisting of one or more virtual circuits\n   and used as numbered logical\
    \ point-to-point links (one VC) or logical\n   NBMA networks (more than one VC).\
    \ The current NBMA model for frame\n   relay should continue to be used for small\
