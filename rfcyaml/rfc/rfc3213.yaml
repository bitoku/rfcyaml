- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   As the Internet evolves, additional capabilities are required\
    \ to\n   ensure proper treatment of data [3], voice, video and other delay\n \
    \  sensitive traffic [4].  MPLS enhances source routing and allows for\n   certain\
    \ techniques, used in circuit switching, in IP networks.  This\n   permits a scalable\
    \ approach to handling these diverse transmission\n   requirements.  CR-LDP [1]\
    \ is a simple, scalable, open, non-\n   proprietary, traffic engineering signaling\
    \ protocol for MPLS IP\n   networks.\n   CR-LDP provides mechanisms for establishing\
    \ explicitly routed Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs).  These mechanisms are defined\
    \ as extensions to\n   LDP [2].  Because LDP is a peer-to-peer protocol based\
    \ on the\n   establishment and maintenance of TCP sessions, the following natural\n\
    \   benefits exist:\n      CR-LDP messages are reliably delivered by the underlying\
    \ TCP, and\n      State information associated with explicitly routed LSPs does\
    \ not\n      require periodic refresh.\n      CR-LDP messages are flow controlled\
    \ (throttled) through TCP.\n   CR-LDP is defined for the specific purpose of establishing\
    \ and\n   maintaining explicitly routed LSPs.  Additional optional capabilities\n\
    \   included have minimal impact on system performance and requirements\n   when\
    \ not in use for a specific explicitly routed LSP.  Optional\n   capabilities\
    \ provide for negotiation of LSP services and traffic\n   management parameters\
    \ over and above best-effort packet delivery\n   including bandwidth allocation,\
    \ setup and holding priorities.  CR-LDP\n   optionally allows these parameters\
    \ to be dynamically modified without\n   disruption of the operational (in-service)\
    \ LSP [4].\n   CR-LDP allows the specification of a set of parameters to be signaled\n\
    \   along with the LSP setup request.  Moreover, the network can be\n   provisioned\
    \ with a set of edge traffic conditioning functions (which\n   could include marking,\
    \ metering, policing and shaping).  This set of\n   parameters along with the\
    \ specification of edge conditioning\n   functions can be shown to be adequate\
    \ and powerful enough to\n   describe, characterize and parameterize a wide variety\
    \ of QoS\n   scenarios and services including IP differentiated services [5],\n\
    \   integrated services [6], ATM service classes [7], and frame relay\n   [8].\n\
    \   CR-LDP is designed to adequately support the various media types that\n  \
    \ MPLS was designed to support (ATM, FR, Ethernet, PPP, etc.).  Hence,\n   it\
    \ will work equally well for Multi-service switched networks, router\n   networks,\
    \ or hybrid networks.\n   This applicability statement does not preclude the use\
    \ of other\n   signaling and label distribution protocols for the traffic\n  \
    \ engineering application in MPLS based networks.  Service providers\n   are free\
    \ to deploy whatever signaling protocol meets their needs.\n   In particular CR-LDP\
    \ and RSVP-TE [9] are two signaling protocols that\n   perform similar functions\
    \ in MPLS networks.  There is currently no\n   consensus on which protocol is\
    \ technically superior.  Therefore,\n   network administrators should make a choice\
    \ between the two based\n   upon their needs and particular situation.  Applicability\
    \ of RSVP-TE\n   is described in [10].\n"
- title: 2. Applicability of extensions to LDP
  contents:
  - "2. Applicability of extensions to LDP\n   To provide support of additional LSP\
    \ services, CR-LDP extensions are\n   defined in such a way as to be directly\
    \ translatable to objects and\n   messages used in other protocols defined to\
    \ provide similar services\n   [9].  Implementations can take advantage of this\
    \ fact to:\n      Setup LSPs for provision of an aggregate service associated\
    \ with\n      the services being provided via these other protocols.\n      Directly\
    \ translate protocol messages to provide services defined\n      in a non-CR-LDP\
    \ portion of the network.\n      Describe, characterize and parameterize a wide\
    \ variety of QoS\n      scenarios and services including IP differentiated services,\n\
    \      integrated services, ATM service classes, and frame relay.\n   Steady state\
    \ information required for proper maintenance of an LSP\n   may be as little as\
    \ 200 bytes or less.  It is not unreasonable to\n   anticipate that CR-LDP implementations\
    \ may support in excess of one\n   hundred thousand or one million LSPs switched\
    \ through a single Label\n   Switching Router (LSR) under fairly stable conditions.\n\
    \   Because CR-LDP provides for low overhead per LSP - both in terms of\n   needed\
    \ state information and control traffic - CR-LDP is applicable\n   in those portions\
    \ of the Internet where very large numbers of LSPs\n   may need to be switched\
    \ at each LSR.  An example of this would be\n   large backbone networks using\
    \ MPLS exclusively to transport very\n   large numbers of traffic streams between\
    \ a moderately large number of\n   MPLS edge nodes.\n   CR-LDP may also be applicable\
    \ as a mediating service between networks\n   providing similar service extensions\
    \ using widely varying signaling\n   models.\n"
- title: 3. Implementation and deployment considerations in relation to LDP
  contents:
  - "3. Implementation and deployment considerations in relation to LDP\n   LDP specifies\
    \ the following label distribution and management modes\n   (which can be combined\
    \ in various logical ways described in LDP):\n      . Downstream On Demand label\
    \ distribution\n      . Downstream Unsolicited label distribution\n      . Independent\
    \ Label Distribution Control\n      . Ordered Label Distribution Control\n   \
    \   . Conservative Label Retention Mode\n      . Liberal Label Retention Mode\n\
    \   The applicability of LDP is described in [11].\n   In networks where only\
    \ Traffic Engineered LSPs are required, the CR-\n   LDP implementation and deployment\
    \ does NOT require all the\n   functionality defined in the LDP specification.\
    \  The basic Discovery,\n   Session, and Notification messages are required. \
    \ However, CR-LDP\n   requires one specific combination of the label distribution\
    \ modes:\n      . Downstream On Demand Ordered label distribution and\n      \
    \  conservative Label Retention Mode\n   Although CR-LDP is defined as an extension\
    \ to LDP, support for\n   Downstream Unsolicited Label Advertisement and Independent\
    \ Control\n   modes is not required for support of Strict Explicit Routes.  In\n\
    \   addition, implementations of CR-LDP MAY be able to support Loose\n   Explicit\
    \ Routes via the use of 'Abstract Nodes' and/or 'Hierarchical\n   Explicit Routing',\
    \ without using LDP for hop-by-hop LSP setup.\n   CR-LDP also includes support\
    \ for loose explicit routes.  Use of this\n   capability allows the network operator\
    \ to define an 'explicit path'\n   through portions of their network with imperfect\
    \ knowledge of the\n   entire network topology.  Proper use of this capability\
    \ may also\n   allow CR-LDP implementations to inter-operate with 'vanilla' LDP\n\
    \   implementations - particularly if it is desired to set up an\n   explicitly\
    \ routed LSP for best-effort packet delivery via a loosely\n   defined path.\n\
    \   Finally, in networks where both Routing Protocol-driven LSPs (a.k.a.\n   hop-by-hop\
    \ LSPs) and Traffic Engineered LSPs are required, a single\n   protocol (LDP,\
    \ with the extensions defined in CR-LDP) can be used for\n   both TE and Hop-by-Hop\
    \ LSPs.  New protocols do not have to be\n   introduced in the network to provide\
    \ TE-LSP signaling.\n"
- title: 4. Limitations
  contents:
  - "4. Limitations\n   CR-LDP specification only supports point-to-point LSPs.  Multi-\n\
    \   point-to-point and point-to-multi-point are for further study (FFS).\n   CR-LDP\
    \ specification only supports unidirectional LSP setup.  Bi-\n   directional LSP\
    \ setup is FFS.\n   CR-LDP specification only supports a unique label allocation\
    \ per LSP\n   setup.  Multiple label allocations per LSP setup are FFS.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   No additional security issues are introduced in\
    \ this document.  As an\n   extension to LDP, CR-LDP shares the security concerns\
    \ associated with\n   LDP.\n"
