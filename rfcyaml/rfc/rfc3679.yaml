- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Prior to the publication of RFC 2489 (which was updated by RFC 2939),\n\
    \   several option codes were assigned to proposed Dynamic Host\n   Configuration\
    \ Protocol (DHCP) options that were subsequently never\n   used.  This document\
    \ lists those unused option codes and directs IANA\n   to make these option codes\
    \ available for assignment to other DHCP\n   options in the future.\n   The document\
    \ also lists several option codes that are not currently\n   documented in an\
    \ RFC but should not be made available for\n   reassignment to future DHCP options.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Section 2 of this document lists the unused DHCP option codes\
    \ from\n   the IANA list of BOOTP and DHCP option codes [1].  Each option code\n\
    \   includes any known documentation and contact information from the\n   IANA\
    \ list.  IANA will make these option codes available for\n   assignment to other\
    \ DHCP options in the future.\n   Section 3 lists several DHCP option codes that\
    \ are not currently\n   documented in an RFC but should not be made available\
    \ for\n   reassignment to future DHCP options.\n"
- title: 2. Unused DHCP Option Codes to be Reassigned to Future DHCP Options
  contents:
  - "2. Unused DHCP Option Codes to be Reassigned to Future DHCP Options\n   The option\
    \ codes listed in this section are to be returned to IANA\n   for reassignment\
    \ to new options.  Responses from associated contact\n   persons are noted where\
    \ they have been received.\n"
