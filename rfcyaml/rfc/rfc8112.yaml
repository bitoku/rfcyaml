- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)\" [RFC6830]\
    \ specifies an\n   architecture and mechanism for replacing the semantics of an\
    \ address\n   currently used by IP with two separate namespaces: Endpoint\n  \
    \ Identifiers (EIDs), used within sites; and Routing Locators (RLOCs),\n   used\
    \ on the transit networks that make up the Internet\n   infrastructure.  To achieve\
    \ this separation, LISP defines protocol\n   mechanisms for mapping from EIDs\
    \ to RLOCs.  In addition, LISP assumes\n   the existence of a database to store\
    \ and propagate those mappings\n   globally.  This document focuses on the LISP\
    \ Delegated Database Tree\n   (LISP-DDT) [RFC8111] mapping database system.\n\
    \   The \"rig\" tool is a manual management tool to query the LISP-DDT\n   mapping\
    \ database hierarchy.  It can be run by all devices that\n   implement LISP, including\
    \ Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs), Egress\n   Tunnel Routers (ETRs), Proxy ITRs\
    \ (PITRs), Proxy ETRs (PETRs),\n   Map-Resolvers, Map-Servers, and LISP-DDT nodes,\
    \ as well as by a host\n   system at either a LISP-capable or non-LISP-capable\
    \ site.\n   The LISP-DDT \"rig\" tool is similar to the \"LISP Internet Groper\"\
    \n   (\"lig\") tool [RFC6835] in that they are both diagnostic tools to\n   query\
    \ a database.  However, the \"rig\" tool is used to find\n   Map-Servers serving\
    \ an EID-prefix, specifically within a LISP-DDT\n   mapping database framework.\
    \  And \"lig\" can be used on top of any\n   mapping database system to retrieve\
    \ locators used for packet\n   encapsulation.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\

    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  Definitions of Terms
  contents:
  - "3.  Definitions of Terms\n   Endpoint Identifier (EID):  a 32-bit (for IPv4)\
    \ or 128-bit (for IPv6)\n      value (or an address encoded per [RFC8060]) used\
    \ in the source and\n      destination address fields of the first (innermost)\
    \ LISP header of\n      a packet.  The host obtains a destination EID the same\
    \ way it\n      obtains a destination address today -- for example, through a\n\
    \      Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034] lookup or a Session Initiation\n   \
    \   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] exchange.  The source EID is obtained via\n     \
    \ existing mechanisms used to set a host's \"local\" IP address.  An\n      EID\
    \ used on the public Internet must have the same properties as\n      any other\
    \ IP address used in that manner; this means, among other\n      things, that\
    \ it must be globally unique.  An EID is allocated to a\n      host from an EID-prefix\
    \ block associated with the site where the\n      host is located.  An EID can\
    \ be used by a host to refer to other\n      hosts.  EIDs MUST NOT be used as\
    \ LISP RLOCs.  Note that EID blocks\n      MAY be assigned in a hierarchical manner,\
    \ independent of the\n      network topology, to facilitate scaling of the mapping\
    \ database.\n      In addition, an EID block assigned to a site may have site-local\n\
    \      structure (subnetting) for routing within the site; this structure\n  \
    \    is not visible to the global routing system.  In theory, the bit\n      string\
    \ that represents an EID for one device can represent an RLOC\n      for a different\
    \ device.  As the architecture is realized, if a\n      given bit string is both\
    \ an RLOC and an EID, it must refer to the\n      same entity in both cases. \
    \ When used in \"discussions\" with other\n      Locator/ID separation proposals,\
    \ a LISP EID will be called an\n      \"LEID\".  Throughout this document, any\
    \ references to \"EID\" refer\n      to an LEID.\n   Extended EID (XEID):  a LISP\
    \ EID, optionally extended with a non-zero\n      Instance ID (IID) if the EID\
    \ is intended for use in a context\n      where it may not be a unique value,\
    \ such as in a Virtual Private\n      Network where private address space [RFC1918]\
    \ is used.  See\n      Section 5.5 of [RFC6830] for more discussion of IIDs.\n\
    \   Routing Locator (RLOC):  an IPv4 [RFC791] or IPv6 [RFC2460] address\n    \
    \  of an Egress Tunnel Router (ETR).  An RLOC is the output of an\n      EID-to-RLOC\
    \ mapping lookup.  An EID maps to one or more RLOCs.\n      Typically, RLOCs are\
    \ numbered from topologically aggregatable\n      blocks that are assigned to\
    \ a site at each point to which it\n      attaches to the global Internet; where\
    \ the topology is defined by\n      the connectivity of provider networks, RLOCs\
    \ can be thought of as\n      Provider-Assigned (PA) addresses.  Multiple RLOCs\
    \ can be assigned\n      to the same ETR device or to multiple ETR devices at\
    \ a site.\n   DDT node:  a network infrastructure component responsible for\n\
    \      specific XEID-prefix(es) and for the delegation of more-specific\n    \
    \  sub-prefixes to other DDT nodes.\n   DDT client:  a network infrastructure\
    \ component that sends DDT\n      Map-Request messages and implements the iterative\
    \ following of\n      Map-Referral results.  Typically, a DDT client will be a\n\
    \      Map-Resolver (as defined by [RFC6833]), but it is also possible\n     \
    \ for an ITR to implement DDT client functionality.  A DDT client\n      can be\
    \ a device that is originating \"rig\" requests.\n   DDT Map-Server:  a DDT node\
    \ that also implements Map-Server\n      functionality (forwarding Map-Requests\
    \ and/or returning\n      Map-Replies if offering a proxy Map-Reply service) for\
    \ a subset of\n      its delegated prefixes.  Map-Server functions, including\
    \ proxying\n      Map-Replies, are described in [RFC6833].\n   DDT Map-Resolver:\
    \  a network infrastructure element that accepts a\n      Map-Request, adds the\
    \ XEID to its lookup queue, then queries one\n      or more DDT nodes for the\
    \ requested EID, following returned\n      referrals until it receives one with\
    \ the MS-ACK action code\n      [RFC8111].  This indicates that the Map-Request\
    \ has been sent to a\n      Map-Server that will forward it to an ETR that, in\
    \ turn, will\n      provide a Map-Reply to the original sender.  A DDT Map-Resolver\n\
    \      maintains both (1) a cache of Map-Referral message results (termed\n  \
    \    the \"referral cache\") containing RLOCs for DDT nodes responsible\n    \
    \  for XEID-prefixes of interest and (2) a lookup queue of XEIDs that\n      are\
    \ being resolved through iterative querying of DDT nodes.\n   Encapsulated Map-Request:\
    \  a LISP Map-Request that is carried within\n      an Encapsulated Control Message\
    \ (ECM) and that has an additional\n      LISP header prepended.  Sent to UDP\
    \ destination port 4342.  The\n      \"outer\" addresses are globally routable\
    \ IP addresses, also known\n      as RLOCs.  Used by an ITR when sending a Map-Request\
    \ to a\n      Map-Resolver and by a Map-Server when forwarding a Map-Request to\n\
    \      an ETR as documented in [RFC6833].\n   Map-Referral:  a LISP message sent\
    \ by a DDT node when it receives a\n      DDT Map-Request for an XEID that matches\
    \ a configured XEID-prefix\n      delegation.  A non-Negative Map-Referral message\
    \ includes a\n      \"referral\" -- a set of RLOCs for DDT nodes that have more\n\
    \      information about the sub-prefix; a DDT client \"follows the\n      referral\"\
    \ by sending another DDT Map-Request to one of those RLOCs\n      to obtain either\
    \ an answer or another referral to DDT nodes\n      responsible for a more-specific\
    \ XEID-prefix.\n   Authoritative XEID-prefix:  an XEID-prefix delegated to a DDT\
    \ node\n      and for which the DDT node may provide further delegations of\n\
    \      more-specific sub-prefixes.\n"
- title: 4.  Basic Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Basic Overview\n   LISP-DDT [RFC8111] is a hierarchical distributed database\
    \ that\n   embodies the delegation of authority to provide mappings from LISP\n\
    \   EIDs to RLOCs.  It is a statically defined distribution of the EID\n   namespace\
    \ among a set of LISP-speaking servers called \"DDT nodes\".\n   Each DDT node\
    \ is configured as \"authoritative\" for one or more\n   EID-prefixes, along with\
    \ the set of RLOCs for Map-Servers or \"child\"\n   DDT nodes to which more-specific\
    \ EID-prefixes are delegated.\n   Map-Resolvers send Map-Requests to the DDT hierarchy\
    \ and maintain\n   referral caches by receiving Map-Referral messages from DDT\
    \ nodes.\n   Map-Resolvers follow the DDT hierarchy for a given EID lookup based\n\
    \   on the EID-prefix and delegation referrals contained in the\n   Map-Referral\
    \ messages.  The \"rig\" tool is intended to perform the\n   same operation as\
    \ that of a Map-Resolver but to also be used as a\n   management tool for the\
    \ network administrator.\n   When the \"rig\" command is run, an Encapsulated\
    \ Control Message\n   Map-Request is sent for a destination EID.  When a LISP-DDT\n\
    \   Map-Referral is returned, the contents are displayed to the user.\n   The\
    \ information displayed includes:\n   o  A delegated EID-prefix configured in\
    \ a DDT node or a configured\n      site EID-prefix in a DDT Map-Server that matches\
    \ the\n      requested EID.\n   o  The type of DDT node that sent the Map-Referral.\n\
    \   o  The action code and TTL set by the sender of the Map-Referral.\n   o  The\
    \ referral RLOC addresses from the Map-Referral message.\n   o  A round-trip-time\
    \ estimate for the ECM-Map-Request / Map-Referral\n      message exchange.\n \
    \  A possible syntax for a \"rig\" command MAY be:\n   rig [instance-id <iid>]\
    \ <eid> to <ddt-node> [follow-all-referrals]\n   Parameter descriptions:\n   [instance-id\
    \ <iid>]:  <iid> is the IID portion of the XEID used as a\n      VPN identifier\
    \ or for other future purposes.  When the DDT\n      hierarchy is not configured\
    \ with IIDs, this argument is omitted\n      from the command line.\n   <eid>:\
    \  <eid> is either a Fully Qualified Domain Name or a\n      destination EID that\
    \ is being queried in the LISP-DDT mapping\n      database.\n   <ddt-node>:  <ddt-node>\
    \ is the RLOC address of any DDT node in the\n      DDT hierarchy.  This can be\
    \ the DDT root node, a DDT transit node,\n      or a DDT Map-Server.\n   [follow-all-referrals]:\
    \  When this keyword is used, each referral\n      RLOC is queried so \"rig\"\
    \ can descend the entire DDT hierarchy\n      starting from the node <ddt-node>.\
    \  When this keyword is not used,\n      one of the referral RLOCs will be selected\
    \ to descend a branch of\n      the DDT hierarchy.\n   The \"rig\" utility not\
    \ only shows branches of the delegation hierarchy\n   but can also report:\n \
    \  o  When a DDT Map-Server would forward a Map-Request to the ETRs at a\n   \
    \   registered LISP site.  This is known as an \"MS-ACK\" action.\n   o  When\
    \ a DDT Map-Server sends a Negative Map-Referral indicating\n      that a requested\
    \ EID is configured but not registered to the\n      mapping database system.\
    \  This is known as an \"MS-NOT-REGISTERED\"\n      action.\n   o  When a DDT\
    \ node is sending referrals for a transit or leaf node in\n      the hierarchy.\
    \  These are known as \"NODE-REFERRAL\" and\n      \"MS-REFERRAL\" actions, respectively.\n\
    \   o  When a DDT node finds a hole in the address space that has not\n      been\
    \ allocated or configured in the delegation hierarchy.  This is\n      typically\
    \ associated with a hole in a DDT node's configured\n      authoritative prefix.\
    \  This is known as a \"DELEGATION-HOLE\"\n      action.\n   o  When a DDT node\
    \ finds a hole in the address space that has not\n      been allocated or configured\
    \ in the delegation hierarchy at all.\n      This is typically associated with\
    \ a hole that is outside of a DDT\n      node's authoritative prefix.  This is\
    \ known as a\n      \"NOT-AUTHORITATIVE\" action.\n   Refer to [RFC8111] for more\
    \ details about Map-Referral actions.\n"
