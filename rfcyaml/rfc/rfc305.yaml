  - "                          UNKNOWN HOST NUMBERS\n   In response to a recent minor\
    \ flurry of confusion, it seems worth\n   announcing publicly the fact that new\
    \ IMPs are tested (almost\n   always) on the ARPA Net here at BBN before delivery\
    \ to the intended\n   site.  Accordingly, sites should not be surprised to receive\
    \ RFCs\n   or at least RSTs from IMPs or Hosts they thought didn't exist, or\n\
    \   at least did not exist yet.\n   Occasionally, IMPs of some given configuration\
    \ are tested in a\n   mode where they announce their IMP number as different from\
    \ what\n   it will be when finally installed.  A variety of reasons may create\n\
    \   such a situation.  The latest such occurrence is that a TIP, to be\n   installed\
    \ shortly at ETAC with IMP number 20 (replacing the 316\n   IMP now at ETAC which\
    \ is number 20) was recently tested here with\n   McClellan's IMP number (22).\
    \  (It couldn't be tested with its own\n   number since the 316 IMP currently\
    \ at ETAC is using that number.)\n   The result was RSTs from the TIP (Host 3)\
    \ at IMP 22 - which is\n   network address 150 (226 octal or 96 hex).\n   One\
    \ site asked if their Host tables needed updating.  The answer\n   is _NO_.  We\
    \ fully expect IMPs tested under these circumstances to be\n   ignored or CLS'd\
    \ by some Hosts.  We suggest that Host tables (where\n   they are thought to be\
    \ necessary) be modified only in response to\n   official notification from BBN\
    \ via either an RFC or an update to\n   Appendix A of BBN Report #1822.\n   RA/jm\n\
