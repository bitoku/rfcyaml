  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes the management and operational requirements\
    \ for\n   the address and routing parameter area (\"arpa\") domain.  The \"arpa\"\
    \n   domain is used to support a class of infrastructural identifier\n   spaces,\
    \ providing a distributed database that translates elements of\n   a structured\
    \ name space derived from a protocol family to service\n   names.  The efficient\
    \ and reliable operation of this DNS space is\n   essential to the integrity of\
    \ operation of various services within\n   the Internet.  The Internet Architecture\
    \ Board (IAB) has the\n   responsibility, in cooperation with the Internet Corporation\
    \ for\n   Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), to manage the \"arpa\" domain.\n\
    \   This document describes the principles used by the IAB in undertaking\n  \
    \ this role.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) [1] [2] is predominately used\
    \ to\n   translate a structured textual identifier into a protocol-specific\n\
    \   value.  It uses the structure embedded within a hierarchical\n   identifier\
    \ space to create a distributed database, where every node\n   within the database\
    \ corresponds to a node within the name structure.\n   The most prevalent role\
    \ of the DNS is to store a set of name to\n   address translations, allowing a\
    \ domain name to be translated to an\n   IP address.  The DNS is also used to\
    \ store a number of other\n   translations from hierarchically structured identifier\
    \ spaces into\n   target values of various types.\n   The DNS is also capable\
    \ of supporting a translation in the opposite\n   direction, from protocol values\
    \ to the names of service entities.\n   One approach in using the DNS in this\
    \ fashion has been to transform\n   protocol values into a hierarchically structured\
    \ identifier space,\n   and then use these transformed protocol value names as\
    \ a DNS lookup\n   key into the appropriate DNS name hierarchy.  A common use\
    \ of this\n   mechanism has been the reverse of the name to address lookup,\n\
    \   allowing for an IPv4 address to be used to look up a matching domain\n   name.\
    \  For example, the IP address 128.9.160.55 can be associated\n   with the domain\
    \ name \"www.iab.org.\" by creating the DNS entry\n   55.160.9.128.in-addr.arpa.\"\
    \ and mapping this entry, via a DNS PTR\n   record, to the value \"www.iab.org.\"\
    .\n   The resolution of protocol objects into service names is used by a\n   number\
    \ of applications to associate services with a particular\n   protocol object.\
    \  The correct and efficient operation of these\n   applications is dependent\
    \ on the correct and efficient operation of\n   the associated \"arpa\" domain\
    \ name servers.\n"
- title: 2. The "arpa" domain
  contents:
  - "2. The \"arpa\" domain\n   The \"arpa\" domain was originally established as\
    \ part of the initial\n   deployment of the DNS, to provide a transition mechanism\
    \ from the\n   Host Tables that were common in the ARPANET, as well as a home\
    \ for\n   the IPv4 reverse mapping domain.  During 2000, the abbreviation was\n\
    \   redesignated to \"Address and Routing Parameter Area\" in the hope of\n  \
    \ reducing confusion with the earlier network name.\n   The Internet Architecture\
    \ Board (IAB), in cooperation with the\n   Internet Corporation for Assigned Names\
    \ and Numbers (ICANN), is\n   currently responsible for managing the Top Level\
    \ Domain (TLD) name\n   \"arpa\".  This arrangement is documented in Appendix\
    \ A.  This domain\n   name provides the root of the name hierarchy of the reverse\
    \ mapping\n   of IP addresses to domain names.  More generally, this domain name\n\
    \   undertakes a role as  a limited use domain for Internet\n   infrastructure\
    \ applications, by providing a name root for the mapping\n   of particular protocol\
    \ values to names of service entities.  This\n   domain name provides a name root\
    \ for the mapping of protocol values\n   into lookup keys to retrieve operationally\
    \ critical protocol\n   infrastructure data records or objects for the Internet.\n\
    \   The IAB may add other infrastructure uses to the \"arpa\" domain in the\n\
    \   future.  Any such additions or changes will be in accordance with the\n  \
    \ procedures documented in Section 2.1 and Section 3 of this document.\n   This\
    \ domain is termed an \"infrastructure domain\", as its role is to\n   support\
    \ the operating infrastructure of the Internet.  In particular,\n   the \"arpa\"\
    \ domain is not to be used in the same manner (e.g., for\n   naming hosts) as\
    \ other generic Top Level Domains are commonly used.\n   The operational administration\
    \ of this domain, in accordance with the\n   provisions described in this document,\
    \ shall be performed by the IANA\n   under the terms of the MoU between the IAB\
    \ and ICANN concerning the\n   IANA [3].\n"
- title: 2.1 Criteria for "arpa" Sub-domains
  contents:
  - "2.1 Criteria for \"arpa\" Sub-domains\n   The \"arpa\" sub-domains are used for\
    \ those protocol object sets\n   defined as part of the Internet Standards Process\
    \ [4], and are\n   recommended to be managed as infrastructure protocol objects.\n\
    \   Normally, the recommendation is to be made in the \"IANA\n   Considerations\"\
    \ section of the Internet Standard protocol\n   specification.  The recommendation\
    \ should include the manner in which\n   protocol objects are to be mapped into\
    \ lookup keys, and\n   recommendations to IANA concerning the operation of the\
    \ \"arpa\" sub-\n   domain in conjunction with the recommendations concerning\
    \ the\n   operation of the protocol object registry itself.\n   The IESG consideration\
    \ of a document which proposes the use of an\n   \"arpa\" sub-domain shall include\
    \ consideration of the \"IANA\n   Considerations\" section.  If the document is\
    \ approved, the IESG will\n   ask the IAB to request the IANA to add the corresponding\
    \ protocol\n   object sub-domain domain to the \"arpa\" domain, in accordance\
    \ with RFC\n   2860 [3], with administration of the sub-domain undertaken in\n\
    \   accordance with the provisions described in this document.\n"
- title: 2.2 "arpa" Name Server Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.2 \"arpa\" Name Server Requirements\n   As this domain is part of the operationally\
    \ critical infrastructure\n   of the Internet, the stability, integrity and efficiency\
    \ of the\n   operation of this domain is a matter of importance for all Internet\n\
    \   users.\n   The \"arpa\" domain is positioned as a top level domain in order\
    \ to\n   avoid potential operational instabilities caused by multiple DNS\n  \
    \ lookups spanning several operational domains that would be required\n   to locate\
    \ the servers of each of the parent names of a more deeply\n   nested infrastructure\
    \ name.  The maximal lookup set for \"arpa\" is a\n   lookup of the name servers\
    \ for the \"arpa\" domain from a root server,\n   and the query agent is then\
    \ provided with a list of authoritative\n   \"arpa\" name servers.\n   The efficient\
    \ and correct operation of the \"arpa\" domain is\n   considered to be sufficiently\
    \ critical that the operational\n   requirements for the root servers apply to\
    \ the operational\n   requirements of the \"arpa\" servers.  All operational requirements\n\
    \   noted in RFC 2870 [5] as they apply to the operational requirements\n   of\
    \ the root servers shall apply to the operation of the \"arpa\"\n   servers. \
    \ Any revision to RFC 2870 in relation to the operation of\n   the root servers\
    \ shall also apply to the operation of the \"arpa\"\n   servers.\n   Many of the\
    \ servers that are authoritative for the root zone (or the\n   \".\" zone)  also\
    \ currently serve as authoritative for the \"arpa\" zone.\n   As noted in RFC\
    \ 2870 [5], this arrangement is likely to change in the\n   future.\n"

    \ of managing\n   the sub-domain may be delegated by the IAB to an appropriate\

    \ of \"arpa\" sub-domains\n   corresponding to protocol entities where:\n   -\
    \  the delegation, and the hierarchical name structure, is described\n      by\
    \ an IETF Standards Track document [4], and\n   -  the use of the \"arpa\" domain\

  - "4. Current Status of \"arpa\"\n   The \"arpa\" domain is used for the sub-domains\
    \ \"in-addr.arpa\" [1],\n   \"ip6.arpa\" [7] and \"e164.arpa\" [8].\n   Currently,\
    \ the \"arpa\" zone is located on a subset of the root\n   servers, and the zone\
    \ is managed in accordance with these\n   specifications.  The IAB is working\
    \ with ICANN, IANA, and the\n   regional registries to move \"arpa\" and \"in-addr.arpa\"\
    \ records from\n   the root servers in accord with the RFC 2870 recommendation\
    \ for\n   exclusive use of those servers [5].\n   The IPv4 reverse address domain,\
    \ \"in-addr.arpa\" is delegated to the\n   IANA.  The \"in-addr.arpa\" zone is\
    \ currently located on the same same\n   subset of the root servers  as \"arpa\"\
    .  Sub-delegations within this\n   hierarchy are undertaken in accordance with\
    \ the IANA's address\n   allocation practices.\n   The \"ip6.arpa\" IPv6 reverse\
    \ address domain uses a method of\n   delegation that is the same as is used for\
    \ \"in-addr.arpa\", where the\n   \"ip6.arpa\" domain is delegated to the IANA,\
    \ and names within this\n   zone further delegated to the regional IP registries\
    \ in accordance\n   with the delegation of IPv6 address space to those registries\
    \ [6]\n   [7].\n   The \"e164.arpa\" domain is used to map E.164 style phone numbers\
    \ into\n   URIs.  This mechanism is defined in RFC 2916 [9].  RFC 2916 notes\n\
    \   that the provision that names within this DNS zone are to be\n   delegated\
    \ to parties according to ITU recommendation E.164 [10].  RFC\n   3026 [8] describes\
    \ the overall liaison arrangements between the IETF\n   and ITU-T about the use\
    \ of this domain.\n"

    , for historical or other reasons,\n   should adhere to all of the requirements\
    \ established in this document\n   for sub-domains of \"arpa\", and consideration\

    \ Order No. 40SBNT067020:\n         Administration of the arpa Top Level Domain\n\
    \   Dear Mr. Touton:\n   As noted in your organization's quotation of February\
    \ 2, 2000, the\n   arpa Top Level Domain (TLD) exists in the root zone of the\
    \ domain\n   name system as a limited use domain currently consisting of one\n\
    \   record, in-addr.arpa.  On April 14, 2000, the Defense Advanced\n   Research\
    \ Projects Agency (DARPA), formerly known as the Advanced\n   Research Projects\
    \ Agency (ARPA), officially signaled its\n   disassociation with the arpa domain\
    \ and its understanding the domain\n   would be used by the Internet Corporation\
    \ for Assigned Names (ICANN)\n   and Numbers and the Internet Architecture Board\
    \ (IAB) for additional\n   Internet infrastructure uses.\n   In keeping with the\
    \ DARPA understanding, we believe that the arpa\n   domain should be made available\
    \ for this specific, limited purpose.\n   The Department of Commerce considers\
    \ this an Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority (IANA) function and has requested\
    \ that the WHOIS\n   entry for the arpa domain reflect IANA as the registrant.\n\
    \   Purchase Order No. 40SBNT067020 provides that \"[ICANN] will perform\n   other\
    \ IANA functions as needed upon request of DOC.\" As such, the\n   Department\
    \ of Commerce requests that, as part of the IANA functions,\n   ICANN undertake\
    \ administration of the arpa TLD in cooperation with\n   the Internet technical\
    \ community under the guidance of the IAB, as a\n   limited use domain for Internet\
    \ infrastructure applications,\n   including the migration of Internet infrastructure\
    \ applications that\n   currently reside in the .int TLD.  Further, as indicated\
    \ by DARPA,\n   the arpa TLD string should be given a different expansion such\
    \ as\n   \"Address and Routing Parameter Area\" to avoid any implication that\n\
    \   DARPA has operational responsibility for the domain.\n   If you have any questions,\
    \ please do not hesitate to contact me.\n                              Sincerely,\
