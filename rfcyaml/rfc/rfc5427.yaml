    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "2.  Background\n   Operating systems, processes, and applications, collectively
    termed\n   \"Facilities\" in the following, generate messages indicating their
    own\n   status or the occurrence of events.  These messages have come to be\n
    \  known as syslog messages.  A syslog message in general will contain\n   among
    other things a code representing the Facility that generated\n   the message and
    a code representing the Severity of the message.  The\n   Facility and the Severity
    codes are commonly used to categorize and\n   select received syslog messages
    for processing and display.  The\n   Facility codes have been useful in qualifying
    the originator of the\n   content of the messages but in some cases they are not
    specific\n   enough to explicitly identify the originator.  Implementations of
    the\n   syslog protocol [RFC5424] that contain structured data elements\n   (SDEs)
    should use these SDEs to clarify the entity that originated\n   the content of
    the message.\n   This document defines a set of textual conventions (TCs) that
    can be\n   used to represent Facility and Severity codes commonly used in syslog\n
    \  messages.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

    \  SyslogFacility  ::=  TEXTUAL-CONVENTION\n       STATUS  current\n       DESCRIPTION\n
    \          \"This textual convention enumerates the Facilities that\n            originate
    syslog messages.\n            The Facilities of syslog messages are numerically
    coded\n            with decimal values.  For interoperability and backwards-\n
    \           compatibility reasons, this document specifies a\n            normative
    mapping between a label, which represents a\n            Facility, and the corresponding
    numeric value.  This label\n            could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager
    user\n            interfaces.\n            The label itself is often semantically
    meaningless\n            because it is impractical to attempt to enumerate all\n
    \           possible Facilities, and many daemons and processes do\n            not
    have an explicitly assigned Facility code or label.\n            For example,
    there is no Facility label corresponding to\n            an HTTP service.  An
    HTTP service implementation might log\n            messages as coming from, for
    example, 'local7' or 'uucp'.\n            This is typical current practice, and
    originators, relays,\n            and collectors can be configured to properly
    handle this\n            situation.  For improved accuracy, an application can
    also\n            include an APP-NAME structured data element.\n            Note
    that operating system mechanisms for configuring\n            syslog, such as
    syslog.conf, have not yet been standardized\n            and might use different
    sets of Facility labels and/or\n            mapping between Facility labels and
    Facility codes than the\n            MIB.\n            In particular, the labels
    corresponding to Facility codes 4,\n            10, 13, and 14, and the code corresponding
    to the Facility\n            label 'cron' are known to vary across different operating\n
    \           systems.  To distinguish between the labels corresponding\n            to
    Facility codes 9 and 15, a label of 'cron2' is assigned\n            to the Facility
    code 15.  This list is not intended to be\n            exhaustive; other differences
    might exist, and new\n            differences might be introduced in the future.\n
    \           The mapping specified here MUST be used in a MIB network\n            management
    interface, even though a particular syslog\n            implementation might use
    a different mapping in a\n            different network management interface.\n

    levels of syslog messages are numerically\n            coded with decimal values.
    \ For interoperability and\n            backwards-compatibility reasons, this

    label could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager\n            user interfaces.\n
    \           The label itself is often semantically meaningless\n            because
    it is impractical to attempt to strictly define\n            the criteria for
    each Severity level, and the criteria\n            that is used by syslog originators
