- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   This report is based on a workshop held at the John F. Kennedy\
    \ School\n   of Government, Harvard University March 1-3, 1990, by the Harvard\n\
    \   Science, Technology and Public Policy Program.  Sponsored by the\n   National\
    \ Science Foundation and the U.S.  Congress Office of\n   Technology Assessment,\
    \ the workshop was designed to explore the\n   issues involved in the commercialization\
    \ of the Internet, including\n   the envisioned National Research and Education\
    \ Network (NREN).\n   Rather than recapitulate the discussion at the workshop,\
    \ this report\n   attempts to synthesize the issues for the benefit of those not\n\
    \   present at the workshop.  It is intended for readers familiar with\n   the\
    \ general landscape of the Internet, the NSFNET, and proposals and\n   plans for\
    \ the NREN.\n   At the workshop, Stephen Wolff, Director of the NSF Division of\n\
    \   Networking and Communications Research and Infrastructure,\n   distinguished\
    \ \"commercialization\" and \"privatization\" on the basis of\n   his experience\
    \ developing policy for the NSFNET.  He defined\n   commercialization as permitting\
    \ commercial users and providers to\n   access and use Internet facilities and\
    \ services and privatization as\n   the elimination of the federal role in providing\
    \ or subsidizing\n   network services.  In principle, privatization could be achieved\
    \ by\n   shifting the federal subsidy from network providers to users, thus\n\
    \   spurring private sector investment in network services.  Creation of\n   a\
    \ market for private vendors would in turn defuse concerns about\n   acceptable\
    \ use and commercialization.\n"
- title: Commercialization and Privatization
  contents:
  - "Commercialization and Privatization\n   Commercialization.  In the past, many\
    \ companies were connected to the\n   old ARPANET when it was entirely underwritten\
    \ by the federal\n   government.  Now, corporate R&D facilities are already connected\
    \ to,\n   and are sometimes voting members of, mid-level networks.  There are\n\
    \   mail connections from the Internet to commercial services such as\n   MCIMAIL,\
    \ SprintMail, and Compuserve.  DASnet provides a commercial\n   mail gateway to\
    \ and from the Internet and commercial mail services.\n   UUNET, a nonprofit corporation,\
    \ markets TCP/IP services (Alternet)\n   with access to the Internet as well as\
    \ mail services.  Performance\n   Systems International (PSI), a startup company\
    \ which now operates\n   NYSERNET (the New York State regional network, partially\
    \ funded by\n   NSF) is aggressively marketing Internet-connected TCP/IP services\
    \ on\n   the East and West Coasts.  RLG is selling access to its RLIN database\n\
    \   over the Internet directly to end users.  Other fee-based services\n   include\
    \ Clarinet, a private news filtering service, and FAST, a non-\n   profit parts\
    \ brokering service.  However, in all these cases, any use\n   of the NSFNET backbone\
    \ must, in principle, support the \"purpose of\n   the NSFNET.\"\n   Under the\
    \ draft acceptable use policy in effect from 1988 to mid-\n   1990, use of the\
    \ NSFNET backbone had to support the purpose of\n   \"scientific research and\
    \ other scholarly activities.\"  The interim\n   policy promulgated in June 1990\
    \ is the same, except that the purpose\n   of the NSFNET is now \"to support research\
    \ and education in and among\n   academic institutions in the U.S. by access to\
    \ unique resources and\n   the opportunity for collaborative work.\"  Despite\
    \ this limitation,\n   use of the NSFNET backbone has been growing at 15-20% per\
    \ month or\n   more, and there are regular requests for access by commercial\n\
    \   services.  Even though such services may, directly or indirectly,\n   support\
    \ the purposes of the NSFNET, they raise prospects of\n   overburdening network\
    \ resources and unfair competition with private\n   providers of network services\
    \ (notably the public X.25 packet-\n   switched networks, such as SprintNet and\
    \ Tymnet).\n   Privatization.  In some respects, the Internet is already\n   substantially\
    \ privatized.  The physical circuits are owned by the\n   private sector, and\
    \ the logical networks are usually managed and\n   operated by the private sector.\
    \  The nonprofit regional networks of\n   the NSFNET increasingly contract out\
    \ routine operations, including\n   network information centers, while retaining\
    \ control of policy and\n   planning functions.  This helps develop expertise,\
    \ resources, and\n   competition in the private sector and so facilitates the\
    \ development\n   of similar commercial services.\n   In the case of NSFNET, the\
    \ annual federal investment covers only a\n   minor part of the backbone and the\
    \ regional networks.  Although the\n   NSFNET backbone is operated as a cooperative\
    \ agreement between NSF\n   and Merit, the Michigan higher education network,\
    \ NSF contributes\n   less than $3 million of approximately $10 million in annual\
    \ costs.\n   The State of Michigan Strategic Fund contributes $1 million and the\n\
    \   balance is covered by contributed services from the subcontractors to\n  \
    \ Merit, IBM and MCI.\n   At the regional level, NSF provides approximately 40%\
    \ of the\n   operating costs of the mid-level networks it funds -- with the\n\
    \   remainder covered by membership and connection fees, funding from\n   state\
    \ governments, and in-kind contributions.  This calculation does\n   not include\
    \ a number of authorized networks (e.g., PREPnet, and,\n   until recently, NEARnet\
    \ and CERFnet) that receive no NSF funding.\n   However, NSF also funds institutional\
    \ connections to the NSFNET,\n   which includes payments by the institution to\
    \ the regional network.\n   Other agencies (DOD, NASA, and DOE) have also funded\
    \ some connections\n   to NSFNET networks for the benefit of their respective\
    \ research\n   communities -- and have occasionally funded the networks directly.\n\
    \   Finally, the campus-level networks at academic institutions probably\n   represent\
    \ a perhaps 7-10 times larger annual investment than the\n   mid-level networks\
    \ and the backbone together, yet there is no federal\n   funding program at this\
    \ level.  Furthermore, since these local\n   networks must ordinarily be built\
    \ by the institution rather than\n   leased, there is an additional capitalization\
    \ cost incurred by the\n   institutions, which, annualized and aggregated, is\
    \ perhaps another\n   20-50 times the annual costs of the mid-level and backbone\
    \ networks.\n   (These figures are the roughest of estimates, intended only for\n\
    \   illustration.)\n"
- title: The NSFNET Backbone as a Free Good
  contents:
  - "The NSFNET Backbone as a Free Good\n   Whereas the NSF funding of mid-level networks\
    \ varies greatly -- from\n   0% to 75% -- the backbone is available as a free\
    \ good to the NSF-\n   funded mid-level networks.  It is also used free of charge\
    \ by other\n   authorized networks, including networks not considered part of\n\
    \   NSFNET: CSNET, BITNET, UUNET, and PSI, as well as the research\n   networks\
    \ of other federal agencies.  As noted, their use of the\n   backbone is in principle\
    \ limited to the support of academic research\n   and education.\n   Through their\
    \ use of the NSFNET backbone, these networks appear to be\n   enjoying a subsidy\
    \ from NSF -- and from IBM, MCI, and the State of\n   Michigan.  BITNET and some\
    \ agency networks even use the backbone for\n   their internal traffic.  Nonetheless,\
    \ these other networks generally\n   add value to NSFNET for NSFNET users and\
    \ regional networks insofar as\n   all networks benefit from access to each other's\
    \ users and resources.\n   However, small or startup networks generally bring\
    \ in fewer network-\n   based resources, so one side may benefit more than the\
    \ other.  To the\n   extent that the mail traffic is predominantly mailing lists\
    \ (or other\n   information resources) originating on one network, questions of\n\
    \   imbalance and implicit subsidy arise.  For example, because of the\n   mailing\
    \ lists available without charge on the Internet, three times\n   as much traffic\
    \ runs over the mail gateway from the Internet to\n   MCIMAIL as from MCIMAIL\
    \ to the Internet.  This pattern is reinforced\n   by the sender-pays fee structure\
    \ of MCIMAIL, which discourages\n   mailing list distribution from within MCIMAIL.\n\
    \   The impact of such imbalances is not clear.  For now, the capacity of\n  \
    \ the NSFNET backbone is staying ahead of demand: It jumped from 56\n   Kbps to\
    \ 1.544 Mbps (T-1) in 1988 and will go to 45 Mbps over the next\n   year.  But\
    \ NSF is concerned about a possible recurrence of the\n   congestion which drove\
    \ users off the NSFNET prior to the 1988\n   upgrade.  Given the tripling of campus-level\
    \ connections over the\n   past year, continued growth in users at each site,\
    \ the parade of new\n   resources available over the network, and, especially,\
    \ the\n   development of high-bandwidth uses, there is reason to fear that\n \
    \  demand may again overwhelm capacity.\n   Offering the NSFNET backbone at no\
    \ cost to authorized networks both\n   encourages undisciplined use of the backbone\
    \ and inhibits private\n   investment in backbone networks.  It constrains the\
    \ development of a\n   market for commercial TCP/IP services by diverting an established\
    \ and\n   rapidly growing user base to a subsidized resource.  Charging NSFNET\n\
    \   regionals and other mid-level networks for the use of the NSFNET\n   backbone\
    \ would resolve this problem, but this would impose a\n   substantial cost burden\
    \ on the mid-level networks, which would in\n   turn have to raise membership\
    \ and connection fees dramatically.  To\n   compensate, the NSF subsidy that now\
    \ underwrites the backbone could\n   be moved down the distribution chain to the\
    \ users of the backbone --\n   i.e., to the regional networks, to the campuses,\
    \ or even to\n   researchers themselves.\n   Each option poses unique opportunities\
    \ and problems.  In theory, the\n   further down the chain the subsidy is pushed,\
    \ the more accountable\n   providers will be to end-user needs.  Funding in hands\
    \ of researchers\n   would make universities more responsive to researchers' networking\n\
    \   needs.  Funding in the hands of universities would in turn make\n   regional\
    \ networks more responsive and competitive.  And funds for\n   regional networks\
    \ would spur a general market for backbone services.\n   But the mechanisms for\
    \ expressing user demand upward through these\n   tiers are imperfect.  And, from\
    \ an administrative standpoint, it is\n   easier for NSF to simply provide one\
    \ free backbone to all comers --\n   rather than deal with 25 mid-level networks,\
    \ or 500 universities, or\n   perhaps tens or hundreds of thousands of individual\
    \ researchers.\n"
- title: 'Option: Funding Researchers'
  contents:
  - "Option: Funding Researchers\n   It would be possible to earmark funds for network\
    \ services in agency\n   research grants as a matter of course, so that no new\
    \ administrative\n   process would be required.  But since network costs are presently\
    \ not\n   usage based, such funding will not readily translate into\n   identifiable\
    \ services and may simply end up in local overhead\n   accounts since few institutions\
    \ allocate out costs of access to the\n   Internet.  The use of vouchers rather\
    \ than cash add-ons might help\n   ensure that federal resources are in fact applied\
    \ to qualifying wide\n   area network services -- and possibly avoid the imposition\
    \ of\n   standard institutional overhead on direct funding.  However, if\n   vouchers\
    \ can be sold to other institutions, as economists would\n   advocate in the interests\
    \ of market efficiency, these advantages may\n   be compromised.  Even non-transferable\
    \ vouchers may create a unique\n   set of accounting problems for both funding\
    \ agencies and\n   institutional recipients.\n   A federal subsidy channeled automatically\
    \ to research grants could\n   substantially limit or segregate the user community.\
    \  It would tend\n   to divide the academic community by exacerbating obvious\
    \ divisions\n   between the resource-rich and resource-poor -- between federally\n\
    \   funded researchers and other researchers, between scientists and\n   faculty\
    \ in other disciplines, and between research and education.\n   Within the academic\
    \ community, there is considerable sentiment for\n   providing basic network services\
    \ out of institutional overhead to\n   faculty and researchers in all disciplines,\
    \ at least as long as basic\n   services remain unmetered and relatively low at\
    \ the institutional\n   level.  Of course, special costing and funding may well\
    \ make sense\n   for high-bandwidth usage-sensitive network services (such as\
    \ remote\n   imaging) as they become available in the future.\n"
- title: 'Option: Funding Institutions'
  contents:
  - "Option: Funding Institutions\n   Alternatively, funding for external network\
    \ services, whether in the\n   form of cash or vouchers, could be provided directly\
    \ to institutions\n   without linking it directly to federal research funding.\
    \  As it is,\n   institutions may apply for one-time grants to connect to regional\n\
    \   networks, and these are awarded based on peer assessment of a number\n   of\
    \ different factors, not just the quality of the institution's\n   research. \
    \ But redirecting the subsidy of the backbone could provide\n   regular support\
    \ at the institutional level in ways that need not\n   involve peer review.  For\
    \ example, annual funding might be tied to\n   the number of PhD candidates within\
    \ specific disciplines -- or to all\n   degrees awarded in science.  Geographic\
    \ location could be factored in\n   -- as could financial need.  This, of course,\
    \ would amount to an\n   entitlement program, a rarity for NSF.  Nonetheless,\
    \ it would allow\n   institutions to make decisions based on their own needs --\
    \ without\n   putting NSF in the position of judging among competing networks,\n\
    \   nonprofit and for-profit.\n   There are, however, questions about what sort\
    \ of services the\n   earmarked funding or vouchers could be used for.  Could\
    \ they be used\n   to pay the institution's BITNET fee?  Or a SprintNet bill?\
    \  Or to\n   acquire modems?  For information services?  And, if so, what sort?\n\
    \   Such questions force the funding agency to assume a kind of\n   regulatory\
    \ in an environment where competing equities, demonstrated\n   need, technological\
    \ foresight, and politics must be constantly\n   weighed and juggled.\n"
- title: 'Option: Funding Regional Networks'
  contents:
  - "Option: Funding Regional Networks\n   Shifting the subsidy to the regional networks\
    \ is appealing in that it\n   appears to be the least radical alternative and\
    \ would only require\n   allocating funds among some two dozen contenders.  Since\
    \ most of the\n   regional networks are already receiving federal funding, it\
    \ would be\n   relatively simple to tack on funds for the purchase of backbone\n\
    \   services.  However, providing additional funding at this level\n   highlights\
    \ the problem of competition among mid-level networks.\n   Although most regional\
    \ networks are to some degree creatures of NSF,\n   funded to ensure the national\
    \ reach of NSFNET, they do not hold\n   exclusive geographic franchises, and in\
    \ some areas, there is\n   competition between regionals for members/customers.\
    \  NSF grants to\n   regional networks, by their very size, have an effect of\
    \ unleveling\n   the playing field among regionals and distorting competitive\n\
    \   strengths and weaknesses.\n   Alternet and PSI further complicate the picture,\
    \ since there is no\n   clear basis for NSF or other agencies to discriminate\
    \ against them.\n   The presence of these privately funded providers (and the\
    \ possibility\n   of others) raises difficult questions about what network services\
    \ the\n   government should be funding: What needs is the market now capable of\n\
    \   meeting?  And where will it continue to fail?\n   Experience with regulation\
    \ of the voice network shows that it is\n   inefficient to subsidize local residential\
    \ service for everybody.  If\n   one is concerned about people dropping off the\
    \ voice network -- or\n   institutions not getting on the Internet -- the answer\
    \ is to identify\n   and subsidize those who really need help.  The market-driven\n\
    \   suppliers of TCP/IP-based Internet connectivity are naturally going\n   after\
    \ those markets which can be wired at a low cost per institution,\n   i.e., large\
    \ metropolitan areas, especially those with a high\n   concentration of R&D facilities,\
    \ such as Boston, San Francisco, and\n   Washington, DC.  In the voice environment,\
    \ this kind of targeted\n   marketing by unregulated companies is widely recognized\
    \ as cream-\n   skimming.\n   Like fully regulated voice common carriers (i.e.,\
    \ the local exchange\n   carriers), the non-profit NSF-funded regional networks\
    \ are expected\n   to serve all institutions within a large geographic area. \
    \ In areas\n   with few R&D facilities, this will normally result in a\n   disproportionately\
    \ large investment in leased lines.  Either remote\n   institutions must pay for\
    \ the leased line to the nearest network\n   point of presence -- or the network\
    \ must include the leased line as\n   part of common costs.  If the regional network\
    \ assumes such costs, it\n   will not be price-competitive with other more compact\
    \ networks.\n   Accordingly, a subsidy redirected to the regional networks could\
    \ be\n   keyed to the density of the network.  This might be calculated by\n \
    \  number of circuit miles per member institution or some form of\n   aggregate\
    \ institutional size, figured for either the network as a\n   whole or for a defined\
    \ subregion.  This subsidy could be available to\n   both for-profit and non-profit\
    \ networks, but only certain non-profit\n   networks would meet the density requirement,\
    \ presumably those most in\n   need of help.\n"
- title: Increasing the Value of the Connection
  contents:
  - "Increasing the Value of the Connection\n   The principal advantage in underwriting\
    \ the backbone is that it\n   provides a evenhanded, universal benefit that does\
    \ not involve NSF in\n   choosing among competing networks.  By increasing the\
    \ value of\n   belonging to a regional network, the backbone offers all attached\n\
    \   networks a continuing annual subsidy commensurate with their size.\n   Increased\
    \ value can also derived from access to complementary\n   resources -- supercomputer\
    \ cycles, databases, electronic newsletters,\n   special instruments, etc. --\
    \ over the network.  Like direct funding\n   of backbone, funding these resources\
    \ would induce more institutions\n   to join regional networks and to upgrade\
    \ their connections.  For\n   example, where a database already exists, mounting\
    \ it on the network\n   can be a very cost-effective investment, increasing the\
    \ value of the\n   network as well as directly benefiting the users of the database.\n\
    \   Commercial information services (e.g., Dialog, Orbit, Lexis) may\n   serve\
    \ this function well since they represents resources already\n   available without\
    \ any public investment.  Marketing commercial\n   services to universities over\
    \ the Internet is permissible in that it\n   supports academic research and education\
    \ (although the guidelines\n   state that such commercial uses \"should be reviewed\
    \ on a case-by-case\n   basis\" by NSF).\n   But to date there has been remarkably\
    \ little use of the regional\n   networks, let alone the NSFNET backbone, to deliver\
    \ commercial\n   information services.  In part, this is because the commercial\n\
    \   services are unaware of the opportunities or unsure how to market in\n   this\
    \ environment and are concerned about losing control of their\n   product.  It\
    \ is also due to uneasiness within the regional networks\n   about usage policies\
    \ and reluctance to compete directly with public\n   packet-switched networks.\
    \  However, for weak regional networks, it\n   may be necessary to involve commercial\
    \ services in order to attract\n   and hold sufficient membership -- at least\
    \ if NSF subsidies are\n   withdrawn.  Without a critical mass of users, commercialization\
    \ may\n   need to precede privatization.\n"
- title: Impact of Removing NSF Subsidy from the Backbone
  contents:
  - "Impact of Removing NSF Subsidy from the Backbone\n   Any shift to a less direct\
    \ form of subsidy may cause some disocation\n   and distress at the regional network\
    \ level -- until the benefits\n   begin to be felt.  No regional network has yet\
    \ folded, and no\n   institution has permanently dropped its connection to a regional\n\
    \   network as a consequence of higher prices, but concerns about the\n   viability\
    \ of some regionals would suggest that any withdrawal of\n   subsidy proceed in\
    \ phases.\n   Moreover, as the NSF subsidy vanishes, the operation of the backbone\n\
    \   becomes a private concern of Merit, the Michigan Strategic Fund, IBM,\n  \
    \ and MCI.  While Merit and the Michigan Strategic Fund are more or\n   less public\
    \ enterprises within the state, they are essentially\n   private entrepreneurs\
    \ in the national operation of a backbone\n   network.  Without NSF's imprimatur\
    \ and the leveraging federal funds,\n   the remaining parties are much less likely\
    \ to treat the backbone as a\n   charity offering and may well look to recovering\
    \ costs and using\n   revenues to expand service.\n   The backbone operation could\
    \ conceivably become either a nonprofit or\n   for-profit utility.  While nonprofit\
    \ status might be more appealing\n   to the academic networking community now\

    \ nonprofit\n   corporation, or even a cooperative, could be constituted in a\
    \ form\n   its many heterogeneous users would embrace.  A non-profit\n   organization\
    \ may also have difficulty financing rapid expansion of\n   services.  At the\
    \ same time, the fact that it will compete with\n   private suppliers may preclude\
    \ recognition as a tax-exempt\n   organization -- and so its ability to reinvest\
    \ retained earnings.\n   Operation of the backbone on a for-profit basis would\
    \ attract private\n   investment and could be conducted with relative efficiency.\
    \  However,\n   given the dominant position of the backbone, a for-profit operation\n\
    \   could conceivably get entangled in complex antitrust, regulatory, and\n  \
    \ political struggles.  A nonprofit organization is not immune from\n   such risks,\
    \ but to the extent its users are represented in policy-\n   making, tensions\
    \ are more likely to get expressed and resolved\n   internally.\n   The status\
    \ of backbone or regional networks within the Internet is\n   entirely separate\
    \ from the question of whether network services are\n   metered and charged on\
    \ a usage basis.  Confusion in this regard stems\n   from the fact that the low-speed\
    \ public data networks (SprintNet,\n   TymNet), which are sometimes seen as competitive\
    \ to Internet\n   services, do bill on a connect-time basis.  However, these commercial\n\
    \   services use X.25 connection-based packet-switching -- rather than\n   the\
    \ connectionless (datagram) TCP/IP packet-switching used on the\n   Internet.\
    \  Internet services could conceivably be billed on per-\n   packet basis, but\
    \ the accounting overhead would be high and packets\n   do not contain information\
    \ about individual users.  At bottom, this\n   is a marketing issue, and there\
    \ is no evidence of any market for\n   metered services -- except possibly among\
    \ very small users.  The\n   private suppliers, Alternet and PSI, both sell \"\
    pipes\" not packets.\n"
- title: Privatization by Function

  - "Privatization by Function\n   As an alternative approach to encouraging privatization,\
    \ Dr.  Wolff\n   suggested barring mature services such as electronic mail from\
    \ the\n   subsidized network.  In particular, NSF could bar the mail and news\n\
    \   protocols, SMTP and NNTP, from the backbone and thereby encourage\n   private\
    \ providers to offer a national mail backbone connecting the\n   regional networks.\
    \  Implementation would not be trivial, but it would\n   arguably help move the\
    \ academic and research community toward the\n   improved functionality of X.400\
    \ standards.  It would also reduce\n   traffic over the backbone by about 30%\
    \ -- although given continued\n   growth in traffic, this would only buy two months\
    \ of time.\n   If mail were moved off the regional networks as well as off the\n\
    \   NSFNET backbone, this would relieve the more critical congestion\n   problem\
    \ within certain regions.  But logistically, it would be more\n   complicated\
    \ since it would require diverting mail at perhaps a\n   thousand institutional\
    \ nodes rather than at one or two dozen regional\n   nodes.  Politically, it would\
    \ be difficult because NSF has\n   traditionally recognized the autonomy of the\
    \ regional networks it has\n   funded, and the networks have been free to adopt\
    \ their own usage\n   guidelines.  And it would hurt the regional networks financially,\n\
    \   especially the marginal networks most in need of NSF subsidies.\n   Economies\
    \ of scale are critical at the regional level, and the loss\n   of mail would\
    \ cause the networks to lose present and potential\n   members.\n"
- title: The National Research and Education Network
  contents:
  - "The National Research and Education Network\n   The initiative for a National\
    \ Research and Education Network (NREN)\n   raises a broader set of policy issues\
    \ because of the potentially much\n   larger set of users and diverse expectations\
    \ concerning the scope and\n   purpose of the NREN.  The decision to restyle what\
    \ was originally\n   described as a National Research Network to include education\
    \ was an\n   important political and strategic step.  However, this move to a\n\
    \   broader purpose and constituency has made it all the more difficult\n   to\
    \ limit the community of potential users -- and, by extension, the\n   market\
    \ for commercial services.  At the regional, and especially the\n   state level,\
    \ public networking initiatives may already encompass\n   economic development,\
    \ education at all levels, medical and public\n   health services, and public\
    \ libraries.\n   The high bandwidth envisioned for the NREN suggests a growing\n\
    \   distance between resource-intensive high-end uses and wide use of\n   low-bandwidth\
    \ services at low fixed prices.  The different demands\n   placed on network resources\
    \ by different kinds of services will\n   likely lead to more sophisticated pricing\
    \ structures, including\n   usage-based pricing for production-quality high-bandwidth\
    \ services.\n   The need to relate such prices to costs incurred will in turn\n\
    \   facilitate comparison and interconnection with services provided by\n   commercial\
    \ vendors.  This will happen first within and among\n   metropolitan areas where\
    \ diverse user needs, such as\n   videoconferencing and medical imaging, combine\
    \ to support the\n   development of such services.\n   As shown in Figures 1.\
    \ and 2., the broadening of scope corresponds to\n   a similar generalization\
    \ of structure.  The path begins with\n   mission-specific research activity organized\
    \ within a single\n   computer.  It ends with the development of a national or\n\
    \   international infrastructure: a ubiquitous, orderly communications\n   system\
    \ that reflects and addresses all social needs and market\n   demand, without\
    \ being subject to artificial limitations on purpose or\n   connection.  There\
    \ is naturally tension between retaining the\n   benefits of specialization and\
    \ exclusivity and seeking the benefits\n   of resource-sharing and economies of\
    \ scale and scope.  But the\n   development and growth of distributed computing\
    \ and network\n   technologies encourage fundamental structures to multiply and\
    \ evolve\n   as components of a generalized, heterogeneous infrastructure.  And\n\
    \   the vision driving the NREN is the aggregation and maturing of a\n   seamless\
    \ market for specialized information and computing resources\n   in a common,\
    \ negotiable environment.  These resources have costs\n   which are far greater\
    \ than the NREN.  But the NREN can minimize the\n   costs of access and spread\
    \ the costs of creation across the widest\n   universe of users.\n"
