    Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  A separate memo [16] defines managed objects, in a manner independent\n   of
    the type of network, for controlling the selection, collection and\n   storage
    of accounting information into files for later retrieval via\n   a file transfer
    protocol. This memo defines a set of ATM-specific\n   accounting information which
    can be collected for connections on ATM\n   networks.\n"

  - "2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently
    consists of five major\n   components:\n   o    An overall architecture, described
    in RFC 2271 [1].\n   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
    for the\n        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of\n
    \       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n        STD
    16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].\n        The second version,
    called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5],\n        RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904
    [7].\n   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.  The\n
    \       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n        described
    in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP\n        message protocol,
    which is not an Internet standards track\n        protocol, is called SNMPv2c
    and described in RFC 1901 [9] and\n        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of
    the message protocol is\n        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10],
    RFC 2272 [11] and\n        RFC 2274 [12].\n   o    Protocol operations for accessing
    management information.  The\n        first set of protocol operations and associated
    PDU formats is\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol\n
    \       operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n        [13].\n
    \  o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and\n        the
    view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275\n        [15].\n   Managed
    objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management
    Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms
    defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to
    the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n
    \  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,
    except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible
    (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine\n   readable information in SMIv2 will
    be converted into textual\n   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
    \ However, this\n   loss of machine readable information is not considered to
    change the\n   semantics of the MIB.\n"

  - "3.  Overview\n   In [16], the items of accounting data to be collected are specified\n
    \  as a set of objects.  Which objects are contained in such a set is\n   selectable
    by an administrator through the specification of one or\n   more (subtree, list)
    tuples, where the set of objects to be collected\n   is the union of the subsets
    specified by each tuple:\n       'subtree' specifies a OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
    such that every\n           object in the subset is named by the subtree's value
    appended\n           with a single additional sub-identifier.\n       'list' specifies
    an OCTET STRING value, such that if the N-th bit\n           of the string's value
    is set then the the subset contains the\n           object named by appending
    N as a single additional sub-\n           identifier to the subtree.\n   This
    memo specifies such a subtree containing a set of objects\n   defining items of
    accounting information which are applicable to ATM\n   connections.\n   Note that
    all of the objects defined here have a MAX-ACCESS clause of\n   not-accessible,
    since their purpose is not to be read/written by\n   SNMP, but rather, to be the
    syntax and semantics of the set of\n   information which can be represented within
    a single (subtree, list)\n   tuple.\n"
