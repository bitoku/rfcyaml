  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet is moving towards a multi-protocol environment
    that\n   includes CLNP.  To support CLNP in the Internet, an OSI lower layers\n
    \  infrastructure is required.  This infrastructure comprises the\n   connectionless
    network protocol (CLNP) [9] and supporting routing\n   protocols.  Also required
    as part of this infrastructure are\n   guidelines for network service access point
    (NSAP) address\n   assignment.  This paper provides guidelines for allocating
    NSAP\n   addresses in the Internet (the terms NSAP and NSAP address are used\n
    \  interchangeably throughout this paper in referring to NSAP\n   addresses).\n
    \  The guidelines presented in this document are quite similar to the\n   guidelines
    that are proposed in the Internet for IP address\n   allocation with CIDR (RFC
    1519 [19]).  The major difference between\n   the two is the size of the addresses
    (4 octets for CIDR vs 20 octets\n   for CLNP).  The larger NSAP addresses allows
    considerably greater\n   flexibility and scalability.\n   The remainder of this
    paper is organized into five major sections and\n   an appendix.  Section 2 defines
    the boundaries of the problem\n   addressed in this paper and Section 3 provides
    background information\n   on OSI routing and the implications for NSAP addresses.\n
    \  Section 4 addresses the specific relationship between NSAP addresses\n   and
    routing, especially with regard to hierarchical routing and data\n   abstraction.
    \ This is followed in Section 5 with an application of\n   these concepts to the
    Internet environment.  Section 6 provides\n   recommended guidelines for NSAP
    address allocation in the Internet.\n   This includes recommendations for the
    U.S. and European parts of the\n   Internet, as well as more general recommendations
    for any part of the\n   Internet.\n   The Appendix contains a compendium of useful
    information concerning\n   NSAP structure and allocation authorities.  The GOSIP
    Version 2 NSAP\n   structure is discussed in detail and the structure for U.S.-based
    DCC\n   (Data Country Code) NSAPs is described.  Contact information for the\n
    \  registration authorities for GOSIP and DCC-based NSAPs in the U.S.,\n   the
    General Services Administration (GSA) and the American National\n   Standards
    Institute (ANSI), respectively, is provided.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 1237.
    \ The changes from RFC 1237 are\n   minor, and primarily editorial in nature.
    \ The descriptions of OSI\n   routing standards contained in Section 3 have been
    updated to reflect\n   the current status of the relevant standards, and a description
    of\n   the OSI Interdomain Routing Protocol (IDRP) has been added.\n   Recommendations
    specific to the European part of the Internet have\n   been added in Section 6,
    along with recommendations for Routing\n   Domain Identifiers and Routing Domain
    Confederation Identifiers\n   needed for operation of IDRP.\n"

  - "2.  Scope\n   Control over the collection of hosts and the transmission and\n
    \  switching facilities that compose the networking resources of the\n   global
    Internet is not homogeneous, but is distributed among multiple\n   administrative
    authorities.  For the purposes of this paper, the term\n   network service provider
    (or just provider) is defined to be an\n   organization that is in the business
    of providing datagram switching\n   services to customers.  Organizations that
    are *only* customers\n   (i.e., that do not provide datagram services to other
    organizations)\n   are called network service subscribers (or simply subscribers).\n
    \  In the current Internet, subscribers (e.g., campus and corporate site\n   networks)
    attach to providers (e.g., regionals, commercial providers,\n   and government
    backbones) in only one or a small number of carefully\n   controlled access points.
    \ For discussion of OSI NSAP allocation in\n   this paper, providers are treated
    as composing a mesh having no fixed\n   hierarchy.  Addressing solutions which
    require substantial changes or\n   constraints on the current topology are not
    considered in this paper.\n   There are two aspects of interest when discussing
    OSI NSAP allocation\n   within the Internet.  The first is the set of administrative\n
    \  requirements for obtaining and allocating NSAP addresses; the second\n   is
    the technical aspect of such assignments, having largely to do\n   with routing,
    both within a routing domain (intra-domain routing) and\n   between routing domains
    (inter-domain routing).  This paper focuses\n   on the technical issues.\n   The
    technical issues in NSAP allocation are mainly related to\n   routing.  This paper
    assumes that CLNP will be widely deployed in the\n   Internet, and that the routing
    of CLNP traffic will normally be based\n   on the OSI end-system to intermediate
    system routing protocol (ES-IS)\n   [10], intra-domain IS-IS protocol [14], and
    inter-domain routing\n   protocol (IDRP) [16].  It is expected that in the future
    the OSI\n   routing architecture will be enhanced to include support for\n   multicast,
    resource reservation, and other advanced services.  The\n   requirements for addressing
    for these future services is outside of\n   the scope of this document.\n   The
    guidelines provided in this paper have been the basis for initial\n   deployment
    of CLNP in the Internet, and have proven very valuable\n   both as an aid to scaling
    of CLNP routing, and to address\n   administration.\n   The guidelines in this
    paper are oriented primarily toward the\n   large-scale division of NSAP address
    allocation in the Internet.\n   Topics covered include:\n   * Arrangement of parts
    of the NSAP for efficient operation of\n     the IS-IS routing protocol;\n   *
    Benefits of some topological information in NSAPs to reduce\n     routing protocol
    overhead, and specifically the overhead on\n     inter-domain routing (IDRP);\n
    \  * The anticipated need for additional levels of hierarchy in\n     Internet
    addressing to support network growth and use of\n     the Routing Domain Confederation
    mechanism of IDRP to provide\n     support for additional levels of hierarchy;\n
    \  * The recommended mapping between Internet topological entities\n     (i.e.,
    service providers and service subscribers) and OSI\n     addressing and routing
    components, such as areas, domains and\n     confederations;\n   * The recommended
    division of NSAP address assignment authority\n     among service providers and
    service subscribers;\n   * Background information on administrative procedures
    for\n     registration of administrative authorities immediately\n     below the
    national level (GOSIP administrative authorities\n     and ANSI organization identifiers);
    and,\n   * Choice of the high-order portion of the NSAP in subscriber\n     routing
    domains that are connected to more than one service\n     provider.\n   It is
    noted that there are other aspects of NSAP allocation, both\n   technical and
    administrative, that are not covered in this paper.\n   Topics not covered or
    mentioned only superficially include:\n   * Identification of specific administrative
    domains in the\n     Internet;\n   * Policy or mechanisms for making registered
    information known\n     to third parties (such as the entity to which a specific
    NSAP\n     or a portion of the NSAP address space has been allocated);\n   * How
    a routing domain (especially a site) should organize its\n     internal topology
    of areas or allocate portions of its NSAP\n     address space; the relationship
    between topology and addresses\n     is discussed, but the method of deciding
    on a particular topology\n     or internal addressing plan is not; and,\n   *
    Procedures for assigning the System Identifier (ID) portion of\n     the NSAP.
    \ A method for assignment of System IDs is presented\n     in [18].\n"

      parts:\n   * routing exchanges between hosts (a.k.a., end systems or ESs) and\n
      \    routers (a.k.a., intermediate systems or ISs) (ES-IS);\n   * routing exchanges
      between routers in the same routing domain\n     (intra-domain IS-IS); and,\n

      standard ISO 9542) advanced to international\n   standard (IS) status within

      \ Inter-Domain Routing Protocol\n   (IDRP) advanced to IS status within ISO
      in October 1993.  CLNP, ES-\n   IS, and IS-IS are all widely available in vendor
      products, and have\n   been deployed in the Internet for several years.  IDRP
      is currently\n   being implemented in vendor products.\n   This paper examines
      the technical implications of NSAP assignment\n   under the assumption that
      ES-IS, intra-domain IS-IS, and IDRP routing\n   are deployed to support CLNP.\n"

    - "3.2.  Overview of ISIS (ISO/IEC 10589)\n   The IS-IS intra-domain routing protocol,
      ISO/IEC 10589, provides\n   routing for OSI environments.  In particular, IS-IS
      is designed to\n   work in conjunction with CLNP, ES-IS, and IDRP.  This section
      briefly\n   describes the manner in which IS-IS operates.\n   In IS-IS, the
      internetwork is partitioned into routing domains.  A\n   routing domain is a
      collection of ESs and ISs that operate common\n   routing protocols and are
      under the control of a single\n   administration (throughout this paper, \"domain\"
      and \"routing domain\"\n   are used interchangeably).  Typically, a routing
      domain may consist\n   of a corporate network, a university campus network,
      a regional\n   network, a backbone, or a similar contiguous network under control
      of\n   a single administrative organization.  The boundaries of routing\n   domains
      are defined by network management by setting some links to be\n   exterior,
      or inter-domain, links.  If a link is marked as exterior,\n   no intra-domain
      IS-IS routing messages are sent on that link.\n   IS-IS routing makes use of
      two-level hierarchical routing.  A routing\n   domain is subdivided into areas
      (also known as level 1 subdomains).\n   Level 1 routers know the topology in
      their area, including all\n   routers and hosts.  However, level 1 routers do
      not know the identity\n   of routers or destinations outside of their area.
      \ Level 1 routers\n   forward all traffic for destinations outside of their
      area to a level\n   2 router within their area.\n   Similarly, level 2 routers
      know the level 2 topology and know which\n   addresses are reachable via each
      level 2 router.  The set of all\n   level 2 routers in a routing domain are
      known as the level 2\n   subdomain, which can be thought of as a backbone for
      interconnecting\n   the areas.  Level 2 routers do not need to know the topology
      within\n   any level 1 area, except to the extent that a level 2 router may
      also\n   be a level 1 router within a single area. Only level 2 routers can\n
      \  exchange data packets or routing information directly with routers\n   located
      outside of their routing domain.\n   NSAP addresses provide a flexible, variable
      length addressing format,\n   which allows for multi-level hierarchical address
      assignment.  These\n   addresses provide the flexibility needed to solve two
      critical\n   problems simultaneously: (i) How to administer a worldwide address\n
      \  space; and (ii) How to assign addresses in a manner which makes\n   routing
      scale well in a worldwide Internet.\n   As illustrated in Figure 1, ISO addresses
      are subdivided into the\n   Initial Domain Part (IDP) and the Domain Specific
      Part (DSP).  The\n   IDP is the part which is standardized by ISO, and specifies
      the\n   format and authority responsible for assigning the rest of the\n   address.
      \ The DSP is assigned by whatever addressing authority is\n   specified by the
      IDP (see Appendix A for more discussion on the top\n   level NSAP addressing
      authorities).  It is expected that the\n   authority specified by the IDP may
      further sub-divide the DSP, and\n   may assign sub-authorities responsible for
      parts of the DSP.\n   For routing purposes, ISO addresses are subdivided by
      IS-IS into the\n   area address, the system identifier (ID), and the NSAP selector\n
      \  (SEL).  The area address identifies both the routing domain and the\n   area
      within the routing domain.  Generally, the area address\n   corresponds to the
      IDP plus a high-order part of the DSP (HO-DSP).\n   <----IDP---> <----------------------DSP---------------------------->\n

      1: OSI Hierarchical Address Structure.\n   The ID field may be from one to eight
      octets in length, but must have\n   a single known length in any particular
      routing domain.  Each router\n   is configured to know what length is used in
      its domain.  The SEL\n   field is always one octet in length.  Each router is
      therefore able\n   to identify the ID and SEL fields as a known number of trailing\n
      \  octets of the NSAP address.  The area address can be identified as\n   the
      remainder of the address (after truncation of the ID and SEL\n   fields).  It
      is therefore not necessary for the area address to have\n   any particular length
      -- the length of the area address could vary\n   between different area addresses
      in a given routing domain.\n   Usually, all nodes in an area have the same area
      address.  However,\n   sometimes an area might have multiple addresses.  Motivations
      for\n   allowing this are several:\n   * It might be desirable to change the
      address of an area.  The most\n     graceful way of changing an area address
      from A to B is to first\n     allow it to have both addresses A and B, and then
      after all nodes\n     in the area have been modified to recognize both addresses,
      one by\n     one the nodes can be modified to forget address A.\n   * It might
      be desirable to merge areas A and B into one area.  The\n     method for accomplishing
      this is to, one by one, add knowledge of\n     address B into the A partition,
      and similarly add knowledge of\n     address A into the B partition.\n   * It
      might be desirable to partition an area C into two areas, A and\n     B (where
      A might equal C, in which case this example becomes one\n     of removing a
      portion of an area).  This would be accomplished by\n     first introducing
      knowledge of address A into the appropriate\n     nodes (those destined to become
      area A), and knowledge of address\n     B into the appropriate nodes, and then
      one by one removing\n     knowledge of address C.\n   Since the addressing explicitly
      identifies the area, it is very easy\n   for level 1 routers to identify packets
      going to destinations outside\n   of their area, which need to be forwarded
      to level 2 routers.  Thus,\n   in IS-IS routers perform as follows:\n   * Level
      1 intermediate systems route within an area based on the ID\n     portion of
      the ISO address.  Level 1 routers recognize, based on the\n     destination
      address in a packet, whether the destination is within\n     the area.  If so,
      they route towards the destination.  If not, they\n     route to the nearest
      level 2 router.\n   * Level 2 intermediate systems route based on address prefixes,\n
      \    preferring the longest matching prefix, and preferring internal\n     routes
      over external routes.  They route towards areas, without\n     regard to the
      internal structure of an area; or towards level 2\n     routers on the routing
      domain boundary that have advertised external\n     address prefixes into the
      level 2 subdomain.  A level 2 router may\n     also be operating as a level
      1 router in one area.\n   A level 1 router will have the area portion of its
      address manually\n   configured.  It will refuse to become a neighbor with a
      router whose\n   area addresses do not overlap its own area addresses.  However,
      if a\n   level 1 router has area addresses A, B, and C, and a neighbor has\n
      \  area addresses B and D, then the level 1 IS will accept the other IS\n   as
      a level 1 neighbor.\n   A level 2 router will accept another level 2 router
      as a neighbor,\n   regardless of area address.  However, if the area addresses
      do not\n   overlap, the link would be considered by both routers to be level
      2\n   only, and only level 2 routing packets would flow on the link.\n   External
      links (i.e., to other routing domains) must be between level\n   2 routers in
      different routing domains.\n   IS-IS provides an optional partition repair function.
      \ If a level 1\n   area becomes partitioned, this function, if implemented,
      allows the\n   partition to be repaired via use of level 2 routes.\n   IS-IS
      requires that the set of level 2 routers be connected.  Should\n   the level
      2 backbone become partitioned, there is no provision for\n   use of level 1
      links to repair a level 2 partition.\n   Occasionally a single level 2 router
      may lose connectivity to the\n   level 2 backbone.  In this case the level 2
      router will indicate in\n   its level 1 routing packets that it is not \"attached\",
      thereby\n   allowing level 1 routers in the area to route traffic for outside
      of\n   the area to a different level 2 router.  Level 1 routers therefore\n
      \  route traffic to destinations outside of their area only to level 2\n   routers
      which indicate in their level 1 routing packets that they are\n   \"attached\".\n
      \  A host may autoconfigure the area portion of its address by\n   extracting
      the area portion of a neighboring router's address. If\n   this is the case,
      then a host will always accept a router as a\n   neighbor.  Since the standard
      does not specify that the host *must*\n   autoconfigure its area address, a
      host may be pre-configured with an\n   area address.\n   Special treatment is
      necessary for broadcast subnetworks, such as\n   LANs.  This solves two sets
      of issues: (i) In the absence of special\n   treatment, each router on the subnetwork
      would announce a link to\n   every other router on the subnetwork, resulting
      in O(n-squared) links\n   reported; (ii) Again, in the absence of special treatment,
      each\n   router on the LAN would report the same identical list of end systems\n
      \  on the LAN, resulting in substantial duplication.\n   These problems are
      avoided by use of a \"pseudonode\", which represents\n   the LAN.  Each router
      on the LAN reports that it has a link to the\n   pseudonode (rather than reporting
      a link to every other router on the\n   LAN).  One of the routers on the LAN
      is elected \"designated router\".\n   The designated router then sends out a
      Link State Packet (LSP) on\n   behalf of the pseudonode, reporting links to
      all of the routers on\n   the LAN.  This reduces the potential n-squared links
      to n links.  In\n   addition, only the pseudonode LSP includes the list of end
      systems on\n   the LAN, thereby eliminating the potential duplication.\n   The
      IS-IS provides for optional Quality of Service (QOS) routing,\n   based on throughput
      (the default metric), delay, expense, or residual\n   error probability.\n   IS-IS
      has a provision for authentication information to be carried in\n   all IS-IS
      PDUs.  Currently the only form of authentication which is\n   defined is a simple
      password.  A password may be associated with each\n   link, each area, and with
      the level 2 subdomain.  A router not in\n   possession of the appropriate password(s)
      is prohibited from\n   participating in the corresponding function (i.e., may
      not initialize\n   a link, be a member of the area, or a member of the level
      2\n   subdomain, respectively).\n   Procedures are provided to allow graceful
      migration of passwords\n   without disrupting operation of the routing protocol.
      \ The\n   authentication functions are extensible so that a stronger,\n   cryptographically-based
      security scheme may be added in an upwardly\n   compatible fashion at a future
      date.\n"

    - "3.3.  Overview of IDRP (ISO/IEC 10747)\n   The Inter-Domain Routing Protocol
      (IDRP, ISO/IEC 10747), developed in\n   ISO, provides routing for OSI environments.
      \ In particular, IDRP is\n   designed to work in conjuction with CLNP, ES-IS,
      and IS-IS.  This\n   section briefly describes the manner in which IDRP operates.\n
      \  Consistent with the OSI Routing Framework [13], in IDRP the\n   internetwork
      is partitioned into routing domains.  IDRP places no\n   restrictions on the
      inter-domain topology.  A router that\n   participates in IDRP is called a Boundary
      Intermediate System (BIS).\n   Routing domains that participate in IDRP are
      not allowed to overlap -\n   a BIS may belong to only one domain.\n   A pair
      of BISs are called external neighbors if these BISs belong to\n   different
      domains but share a common subnetwork (i.e., a BIS can\n   reach its external
      neighbor in a single network layer hop).  Two\n   domains are said to be adjacent
      if they have BISs that are external\n   neighbors of each other.  A pair of
      BISs are called internal\n   neighbors if these BISs belong to the same domain.
      \ In contrast with\n   external neighbors, internal neighbors don't have to
      share a common\n   subnetwork -- IDRP assumes that a BIS should be able to exchange\n
      \  Network Protocol Date Units (NPDUs) with any of its internal\n   neighbors
      by relying solely on intra-domain routing procedures.\n   IDRP governs the exchange
      of routing information between a pair of\n   neighbors, either external or internal.
      \ IDRP is self-contained with\n   respect to the exchange of information between
      external neighbors.\n   Exchange of information between internal neighbors relies
      on\n   additional support provided by intra-domain routing (unless internal\n
      \  neighbors share a common subnetwork).\n   To facilitate routing information
      aggregation/abstraction, IDRP\n   allows grouping of a set of connected domains
      into a Routing Domain\n   Confederation (RDC).  A given domain may belong to
      more than one RDC.\n   There are no restrictions on how many RDCs a given domain
      may\n   simultaneously belong to, and no preconditions on how RDCs should be\n
      \  formed --  RDCs may be either nested, or disjoint, or may overlap.\n   One
      RDC is nested within another RDC if all members (RDs) of the\n   former are
      also members of the latter, but not vice versa.  Two RDCs\n   overlap if they
      have members in common and also each has members that\n   are not in the other.
      \ Two RDCs are disjoint if they have no members\n   in common.\n   Each domain
      participating in IDRP is assigned a unique Routing Domain\n   Identifier (RDI).
      \ Syntactically an RDI is represented as an OSI\n   network layer address.  Each
      RDC is assigned a unique Routing Domain\n   Confederation Identifier (RDCI).
      \ RDCIs are assigned out of the\n   address space allocated for RDIs -- RDCIs
      and RDIs are syntactically\n   indistinguishable.  Procedures for assigning
      and managing RDIs and\n   RDCIs are outside the scope of the protocol.  However,
      since RDIs are\n   syntactically nothing more than network layer addresses,
      and RDCIs\n   are syntactically nothing more than RDIs, it is expected that
      RDI and\n   RDCI assignment and management would be part of the network layer\n
      \  assignment and management procedures.  Recommendations for RDI and\n   RDCI
      assignment are provided in Section 6.5.\n   IDRP requires a BIS to be preconfigured
      with the RDI of the domain to\n   which the BIS belongs.  If a BIS belongs to
      a domain that is a member\n   of one or more RDCs, then the BIS has to be preconfigured
      with RDCIs\n   of all the RDCs the domain is in, and the information about relations\n
      \  between the RDCs - nested or overlapped.\n   IDRP doesn't assume or require
      any particular internal structure for\n   the addresses.  The protocol provides
      correct routing as long as the\n   following guidelines are met:\n   * End systems
      and intermediate systems may use any NSAP address or\n     Network Entity Title
      (NET -- i.e., an NSAP address without the\n     selector) that has been assigned
      under ISO 8348 [11] guidelines;\n   * An NSAP prefix carried in the Network
      Layer Reachability\n     Information (NLRI) field for a route originated by
      a BIS in a\n     given routing domain should be associated with only that\n
      \    routing domain; that is, no system identified by the prefix\n     should
      reside in a different routing domain; ambiguous routing\n     may result if
      several routing domains originate routes whose\n     NLRI field contain identical
      NSAP address prefixes, since this\n     would imply that the same system(s)
      is simultaneously located\n     in several routing domains;\n   * Several different
      NSAP prefixes may be associated with a single\n     routing domain which contains
      a mix of systems which use NSAP\n     addresses assigned by several different
      addressing authorities.\n   IDRP assumes that the above guidelines have been
      satisfied,  but it\n   contains no means to verify that this is so.  Therefore,
      such\n   verification is assumed to be the responsibility of the\n   administrators
      of routing domains.\n   IDRP provides mandatory support for data integrity and
      optional\n   support for data origin authentication for all of its messages.
      \ Each\n   message carries a 16-octet digital signature that is computed by\n
      \  applying the MD-4 algorithm (RFC 1320) to the context of the message\n   itself.
      \ This signature provides support for data integrity.  To\n   support data origin
      authentication a BIS, when computing a digital\n   signature of a message, may
      prepend and append additional information\n   to the message.  This information
      is not passed as part of the\n   message but is known to the receiver.\n"

      - "3.3.1.  Scaling Mechanisms in IDRP\n   The ability to group domains in RDCs
        provides a simple, yet powerful\n   mechanism for routing information aggregation
        and abstraction.  It\n   allows reduction of topological information by replacing
        a sequence\n   of RDIs carried by the RD_PATH attribute with a single RDCI.
        \ It also\n   allows reduction of the amount of information related to transit\n
        \  policies, since the policies can be expressed in terms of aggregates\n

        implies\n   that address assignment that will facilitate route aggregation
        does\n   not conflict with the ability to form RDCs, and vice versa; formation\n

    - "3.4.  Requirements of IS-IS and IDRP on NSAPs\n   The preferred NSAP format
      for IS-IS is shown in Figure 1.  A number\n   of points should be noted from
      IS-IS:\n   * The IDP is as specified in ISO 8348, the OSI network layer service\n
      \    specification [11];\n   * The high-order portion of the DSP (HO-DSP) is
      that portion of the\n     DSP whose assignment, structure, and meaning are not
      constrained by\n     IS-IS;\n   * The area address (i.e., the concatenation
      of the IDP and the\n     HO-DSP) must be globally unique.  If the area address
      of an NSAP\n     matches one of the area addresses of a router, it is in the\n
      \    router's area and is routed to by level 1 routing;\n   * Level 2 routing
      acts on address prefixes, using the longest address\n     prefix that matches
      the destination  address;\n   * Level 1 routing acts on the ID field.  The ID
      field must be unique\n     within an area for ESs and level 1 ISs, and unique
      within the\n     routing domain for level 2 ISs.  The ID field is assumed to
      be\n     flat.  The method presented in RFC 1526 [18] may optionally be\n     used
      to assure globally unique IDs;\n   * The one-octet NSAP Selector, SEL, determines
      the entity to receive\n     the CLNP packet within the system identified by
      the rest of the\n     NSAP (i.e., a transport entity) and is always the last
      octet of the\n     NSAP; and,\n   * A system shall be able to generate and forward
      data packets\n     containing addresses in any of the formats specified by\n
      \    ISO 8348.  However, within a routing domain that conforms to IS-IS,\n     the
      lower-order octets of the NSAP should be structured as the ID\n     and SEL
      fields shown in Figure 1 to take full advantage of IS-IS\n     routing.  End
      systems with addresses which do not conform may\n     require additional manual
      configuration and be subject to inferior\n     routing performance.\n   For
      purposes of efficient operation of the IS-IS routing protocol,\n   several observations
      may be made.  First, although the IS-IS protocol\n   specifies an algorithm
      for routing within a single routing domain,\n   the routing algorithm must efficiently
      route both: (i) Packets whose\n   final destination is in the domain (these
      must, of course, be routed\n   to the correct destination end system in the
      domain); and (ii)\n   Packets whose final destination is outside of the domain
      (these must\n   be routed to an appropriate \"border\" router, from which they
      will\n   exit the domain).\n   For those destinations which are in the domain,
      level 2 routing\n   treats the entire area address (i.e., all of the NSAP address
      except\n   the ID and SEL fields) as if it were a flat field.  Thus, the\n   efficiency
      of level 2 routing to destinations within the domain is\n   affected only by
      the number of areas in the domain, and the number of\n   area addresses assigned
      to each area.\n   For those destinations which are outside of the domain, level
      2\n   routing routes according to address prefixes.  In this case, there is\n
      \  considerable potential advantage (in terms of reducing the amount of\n   routing
      information that is required) if the number of address\n   prefixes required
      to describe any particular set of external\n   destinations can be minimized.
      \ Efficient routing with IDRP similarly\n   also requires minimization of the
      number of address prefixes needed\n   to describe specific destinations.  In
      other words, addresses need to\n   be assigned with topological significance.
      \ This requirement is\n   described in more detail in the following sections.\n"

    - "4.1.  Routing Data Abstraction\n   When determining an administrative policy
      for NSAP assignment, it is\n   important to understand the technical consequences.
      \ The objective\n   behind the use of hierarchical routing is to achieve some
      level of\n   routing data abstraction, or summarization, to reduce the processing\n
      \  time, memory requirements, and transmission bandwidth consumed in\n   support
      of routing.  This implies that address assignment must serve\n   the needs of
      routing, in order for routing to scale to very large\n   networks.\n   While
      the notion of routing data abstraction may be applied to\n   various types of
      routing information, this and the following sections\n   primarily emphasize
      one particular type, namely reachability\n   information.  Reachability information
      describes the set of reachable\n   destinations.\n   Abstraction of reachability
      information dictates that NSAPs be\n   assigned according to topological routing
      structures.  However,\n   administrative assignment falls along organizational
      or political\n   boundaries.  These may not be congruent to topological boundaries,\n
      \  and therefore the requirements of the two may collide.  A balance\n   between
      these two needs is necessary.\n   Routing data abstraction occurs at the boundary
      between\n   hierarchically arranged topological routing structures.  An element\n
      \  lower in the hierarchy reports summary routing information to its\n   parent(s).
      \ Within the current OSI routing framework [13] and routing\n   protocols, the
      lowest boundary at which this can occur is the\n   boundary between an area
      and the level 2 subdomain within a IS-IS\n   routing domain.  Data abstraction
      is designed into IS-IS at this\n   boundary, since level 1 ISs are constrained
      to reporting only area\n   addresses.\n   Level 2 routing is based upon address
      prefixes.  Level 2 routers\n   (ISs) distribute, throughout the level 2 subdomain,
      the area\n   addresses of the level 1 areas to which they are attached (and
      any\n   manually configured reachable address prefixes).  Level 2 routers\n
      \  compute next-hop forwarding information to all advertised address\n   prefixes.
      \ Level 2 routing is determined by the longest advertised\n   address prefix
      that matches the destination address.\n   At routing domain boundaries, address
      prefix information is exchanged\n   with other routing domains via IDRP.  If
      area addresses within a\n   routing domain are all drawn from distinct NSAP
      assignment\n   authorities (allowing no abstraction), then the boundary prefix\n
      \  information consists of an enumerated list of all area addresses.\n   Alternatively,
      should the routing domain \"own\" an address prefix and\n   assign area addresses
      based upon it, boundary routing information can\n   be summarized into the single
      prefix.  This can allow substantial\n   data reduction and, therefore, will
      allow much better scaling (as\n   compared to the uncoordinated area addresses
      discussed in the\n   previous paragraph).\n   If routing domains are interconnected
      in a more-or-less random (non-\n   hierarchical) scheme, it is quite likely
      that no further abstraction\n   of routing data can occur.  Since routing domains
      would have no\n   defined hierarchical relationship, administrators would not
      be able\n   to assign area addresses out of some common prefix for the purpose
      of\n   data abstraction.  The result would be flat inter-domain routing; all\n
      \  routing domains would need explicit knowledge of all other routing\n   domains
      that they route to.  This can work well in small- and medium-\n   sized internets,
      up to a size somewhat larger than the current IP\n   Internet.  However, this
      does not scale to very large internets.  For\n   example, we expect growth in
      the future to an international Internet\n   which has tens or hundreds of thousands
      of routing domains in the\n   U.S. alone.  Even larger numbers of routing domains
      are possible when\n   each home, or each small company, becomes its own routing
      domain.\n   This requires a greater degree of data abstraction beyond that which\n
      \  can be achieved at the \"routing domain\" level.\n   In the Internet, however,
      it should be possible to exploit the\n   existing hierarchical routing structure
      interconnections, as\n   discussed in Section 5.  Thus, there is the opportunity
      for a group\n   of subscribers each to be assigned an address prefix from a
      shorter\n   prefix assigned to their provider.  Each subscriber now \"owns\"
      its\n   (somewhat longer) prefix, from which it assigns its area addresses.\n
      \  The most straightforward case of this occurs when there is a set of\n   subscribers
      whose routing domains are all attached only to a single\n   service provider,
      and which use that provider for all external\n   (inter-domain) traffic.  A
      short address prefix may be assigned to\n   the provider, which then assigns
      slightly longer prefixes (based on\n   the provider's prefix) to each of the
      subscribers.  This allows the\n   provider, when informing other providers of
      the addresses that it can\n   reach, to abbreviate the reachability information
      for a large number\n   of routing domains as a single prefix.  This approach
      therefore can\n   allow a great deal of hierarchical abbreviation of routing\n
      \  information, and thereby can greatly improve the scalability of\n   inter-domain
      routing.\n   Clearly, this approach is recursive and can be carried through\n
      \  several iterations.  Routing domains at any \"level\" in the hierarchy\n
      \  may use their prefix as the basis for subsequent suballocations,\n   assuming
      that the NSAP addresses remain within the overall length and\n   structure constraints.
      \ The flexibility of NSAP addresses facilitates\n   this form of hierarchical
      address assignment and routing.  As one\n   example of how NSAPs may be used,
      the GOSIP Version 2 NSAP structure\n   is discussed later in this section.\n
      \  At this point, we observe that the number of nodes at each lower\n   level
      of a hierarchy tends to grow exponentially.  Thus the greatest\n   gains in
      data abstraction occur at the leaves and the gains drop\n   significantly at
      each higher level.  Therefore, the law of\n   diminishing returns suggests that
      at some point data abstraction\n   ceases to produce significant benefits.  Determination
      of the point\n   at which data abstraction ceases to be of benefit requires
      a careful\n   consideration of the number of routing domains that are expected
      to\n   occur at each level of the hierarchy (over a given period of time),\n
      \  compared to the number of routing domains and address prefixes that\n   can
      conveniently and efficiently be handled via dynamic inter-domain\n   routing
      protocols.  As the Internet grows, further levels of\n   hierarchy may become
      necessary.  Again, this requires considerable\n   flexibility in the addressing
      scheme, such as is provided by NSAP\n   addresses.\n"

      format, in which the value of the Initial\n   Domain Identifier (IDI) is (decimal)
      840, which identifies the U.S.\n   National Body (ANSI).  This DSP structure
      is identical to the\n   structure that is specified by GOSIP Version 2.  The
      AA field is\n   called \"org\" for organization identifier in the ANSI standard,
      and\n   the ID field is called \"system\".  The ANSI format, therefore, differs\n
      \  from the GOSIP format illustrated above only in that the AFI and IDI\n   specify
      the \"ISO-DCC\" format rather than the \"ISO 6523-ICD\" format\n   used by GOSIP,
      and the \"AA\" field is administered by an ANSI\n   registration authority rather
      than by the GSA.  Organization\n   identifiers may be obtained from ANSI.  The
      technical considerations\n   applicable to NSAP administration are independent
      of whether a GOSIP\n   Version 2 or an ANSI value is used for the NSAP assignment.\n
      \  Similarly, although other countries make use of different NSAP\n   formats,
      the principles of NSAP assignment and use are the same.  The\n   NSAP formats
      recommended by RARE WG4 for use in Europe are discussed\n   in Section 6.2.\n
      \  In the low-order part of the GOSIP Version 2 NSAP format, two fields\n   are
      defined in addition to those required by IS-IS.  These fields, RD\n   and Area,
      are defined to allow allocation of NSAPs along topological\n   boundaries in
      support of increased data abstraction.  Administrations\n   assign RD identifiers
      underneath their unique address prefix (the\n   reserved field is left to accommodate
      future growth and to provide\n   additional flexibility for inter-domain routing).
      \ Routing domains\n   allocate Area identifiers from their unique prefix.  The
      result is:\n   * AFI+IDI+DFI+AA = administration prefix,\n   * administration
      prefix(+Rsvd)+RD = routing domain prefix, and,\n   * routing domain prefix+Area
      = area address.\n   This provides for summarization of all area addresses within
      a\n   routing domain into one prefix.  If the AA identifier is accorded\n   topological
      significance (in addition to administrative\n   significance), an additional
      level of data abstraction can be\n   obtained, as is discussed in the next section.\n"

  - "5.  NSAP Administration and Routing in the Internet\n   Basic Internet routing
    components are service providers and service\n   subscribers.  A natural mapping
    from these components to OSI routing\n   components is that each provider and
    subscriber operates as a routing\n   domain.\n   Alternatively, a subscriber may
    choose to operate as a part of a\n   provider domain; that is, as an area within
    the provider's routing\n   domain.  However, in such a case the discussion in
    Section 5.1\n   applies.\n   We assume that most subscribers will prefer to operate
    a routing\n   domain separate from their provider's.  Such subscribers can exchange\n
    \  routing information with their provider via interior routing protocol\n   route
    leaking or via IDRP; for the purposes of this discussion, the\n   choice is not
    significant.  The subscriber is still allocated a\n   prefix from the provider's
    address space, and the provider advertises\n   its own prefix into inter-domain
    routing.\n   Given such a mapping, where should address administration and\n   allocation
    be performed to satisfy both administrative\n   decentralization and data abstraction?
    \ Three possibilities are\n   considered:\n     1. at the area,\n     2. at the
    subscriber routing domain, and,\n     3. at the provider routing domain.\n   Subscriber
    routing domains correspond to end-user sites, where the\n   primary purpose is
    to provide intra-domain routing services. Provider\n   routing domains are deployed
    to carry transit (i.e., inter-domain)\n   traffic.\n   The greatest burden in
    transmitting and operating on routing\n   information is at the top of the routing
    hierarchy, where routing\n   information tends to accumulate.  In the Internet,
    for example, each\n   provider must manage the set of network numbers for all
    networks\n   reachable through the provider.\n   For traffic destined for other
    networks, the provider will route\n   based on inter-domain routing information
    obtained from other\n   providers or, in some cases, to a default provider.\n
    \  In general, higher levels of the routing hierarchy will benefit the\n   most
    from the abstraction of routing information at a lower level of\n   the routing
    hierarchy.  There is relatively little direct benefit to\n   the administration
    that performs the abstraction, since it must\n   maintain routing information
    individually on each attached\n   topological routing structure.\n   For example,
    suppose that a given subscriber is trying to decide\n   whether to obtain an NSAP
    address prefix based on an AA value from\n   GSA (implying that the first four
    octets of the address would be\n   those assigned out of the GOSIP space), or
    based on an RD value from\n   its provider (implying that the first seven octets
    of the address are\n   those obtained by that provider).  If considering only
    their own\n   self-interest, the subscriber and its local provider have little\n
    \  reason to choose one approach or the other.  The subscriber must use\n   one
    prefix or another; the source of the prefix has little effect on\n   routing efficiency
    within the subscriber's routing domain.  The\n   provider must maintain information
    about each attached subscriber in\n   order to route, regardless of any commonality
    in the prefixes of its\n   subscribers.\n   However, there is a difference when
    the local provider distributes\n   routing information to other providers.  In
    the first case, the\n   provider cannot aggregate the subscriber's address into
    its own\n   prefix; the address must be explicitly listed in routing exchanges,\n
    \  resulting in an additional burden to other providers which must\n   exchange
    and maintain this information.\n   In the second case, each other provider sees
    a single address prefix\n   for the local provider which encompasses the new subscriber.
    \ This\n   avoids the exchange of additional routing information to identify the\n
    \  new subscriber's address prefix.  Thus, the advantages primarily\n   benefit
    other providers which maintain routing information about this\n   provider (and
    its subscribers).\n   Clearly, a symmetric application of these principles is
    in the\n   interest of all providers, enabling them to more efficiently support\n
    \  CLNP routing to their customers.  The guidelines discussed below\n   describe
    reasonable ways of managing the OSI address space that\n   benefit the entire
    community.\n"

    - "5.1.  Administration at the Area\n   If areas take their area addresses from
      a myriad of unrelated NSAP\n   allocation authorities, there will be effectively
      no data abstraction\n   beyond what is built into IS-IS.  For example, assume
      that within a\n   routing domain three areas take their area addresses, respectively,\n
      \  out of:\n   * the GOSIP Version 2 authority assigned to the Department\n
      \    of Commerce, with an AA of nnn:\n               AFI=47, IDI=0005, DFI=80h,
      AA=nnn, ... ;\n   * the GOSIP Version 2 authority assigned to the Department\n
      \    of the Interior, with an AA of mmm:\n                AFI=47, IDI=0005,
      DFI=80h, AA=mmm, ... ; and,\n   * the ANSI authority under the U.S. Data Country
      Code (DCC)\n   (Section A.2) for organization XYZ with ORG identifier = xxx:\n
      \               AFI=39, IDI=840, DFI=dd, ORG=xxx, ....\n   As described in Section
      3.3, from the point of view of any particular\n   routing domain, there is no
      harm in having the different areas in the\n   routing domain use addresses obtained
      from a wide variety of\n   administrations.  For routing within the domain,
      \ the area addresses\n   are treated as a flat field.\n   However, this does
      have a negative effect on inter-domain routing,\n   particularly on those other
      domains which need to maintain routes to\n   this domain.  There is no common
      prefix that can be used to represent\n   these NSAPs and therefore no summarization
      can take place at the\n   routing domain boundary.  When addresses are advertised
      by this\n   routing domain to other routing domains, an enumerated list must
      be\n   used consisting of the three area addresses.\n   This situation is roughly
      analogous to the dissemination of routing\n   information in the TCP/IP Internet
      prior to the introduction of CIDR.\n   Areas correspond roughly to networks
      and area addresses to network\n   numbers.  The result of allowing areas within
      a routing domain to\n   take their NSAPs from unrelated authorities is flat
      routing at the\n   area address level.  The number of address prefixes that
      subscriber\n   routing domains would advertise is on the order of the number
      of\n   attached areas; the number of prefixes a provider routing domain\n   would
      advertise is approximately the number of areas attached to all\n   its subscriber
      routing domains.  For \"default-less\" providers (i.e.,\n   those that don't
      use default routes) the size of the routing tables\n   would be on the order
      of the number of area addresses globally.  As\n   the CLNP internet grows this
      would quickly become intractable.  A\n   greater degree of hierarchical information
      reduction is necessary to\n   allow greater growth.\n"

    - "5.2.  Administration at the Subscriber Routing Domain\n   As mentioned previously,
      the greatest degree of data abstraction\n   comes at the lowest levels of the
      hierarchy.  Providing each\n   subscriber routing domain (that is, site) with
      a unique prefix\n   results in the biggest single increase in abstraction, with
      each\n   subscriber domain assigning area addresses from its prefix.  From\n
      \  outside the subscriber routing domain, the set of all addresses\n   reachable
      in the domain can then be represented by a single prefix.\n   As an example,
      assume a government agency has been assigned the AA\n   value of zzz under ICD=0005.
      \ The agency then assigns a routing\n   domain identifier to a routing domain
      under its administrative\n   authority identifier, rrr.  The resulting prefix
      for the routing\n   domain is:\n   AFI=47, IDI=0005, DFI=80h, AA=zzz, (Rsvd=0),
      RD=rrr.\n   All areas within this routing domain would have area addresses\n
      \  comprising this prefix followed by an Area identifier.  The prefix\n   represents
      the summary of reachable addresses within the routing\n   domain.\n   There
      is a close relationship between areas and routing domains\n   implicit in the
      fact that they operate a common routing protocol and\n   are under the control
      of a single administration.  The routing domain\n   administration subdivides
      the domain into areas and structures a\n   level 2 subdomain (i.e., a level
      2 backbone) which provides\n   connectivity among the areas.  The routing domain
      represents the only\n   path between an area and the rest of the internetwork.
      \ It is\n   reasonable that this relationship also extend to include a common\n
      \  NSAP addressing authority.  Thus, the areas within the subscriber RD\n   should
      take their NSAPs from the prefix assigned to the subscriber\n   RD.\n"

      is a\n   direct provider.  Each case is discussed separately below.\n"

      - "5.3.1.  Direct Service Providers\n   It is interesting to consider whether
        direct service providers'\n   routing domains should be the common authority
        for assigning NSAPs\n   from a unique prefix to the subscriber routing domains
        that they\n   serve.  In the long term the number of routing domains in the\n
        \  Internet will grow to the point that it will be infeasible to route\n   on
        the basis of a flat field of routing domains.  It will therefore\n   be essential
        to provide a greater degree of information abstraction.\n   Direct providers
        may assign prefixes to subscriber domains, based on\n   a single (shorter
        length) address prefix assigned to the provider.\n   For example, given the
        GOSIP Version 2 address structure, an AA value\n   may be assigned to each
        direct provider, and routing domain values\n   may be assigned by the provider
        to each attached subscriber routing\n   domain.  A similar hierarchical address
        assignment based on a prefix\n   assigned to each provider may be used for
        other NSAP formats.  This\n   results in direct providers advertising to other
        providers (both\n   direct and indirect) a small fraction of the number of
        address\n   prefixes that would be necessary if they enumerated the individual\n
        \  prefixes of the subscriber routing domains.  This represents a\n   significant
        savings given the expected scale of global\n   internetworking.\n   Are subscriber
        routing domains willing to accept prefixes derived\n   from the direct providers?
        In the supplier/consumer model, the direct\n   provider is offering connectivity
        as the service, priced according to\n   its costs of operation.  This includes
        the \"price\" of obtaining\n   service from one or more indirect providers
        and exchanging routing\n   information with other direct providers.  In general,
        providers will\n   want to handle as few address prefixes as possible to keep
        costs low.\n   In the Internet environment, subscriber routing domains must
        be\n   sensitive to the resource constraints of the providers (both direct\n
        \  and indirect).  The efficiencies gained in routing clearly warrant\n   the
        adoption of NSAP administration by the direct providers.\n   The mechanics
        of this scenario are straightforward.  Each direct\n   provider is assigned
        a unique prefix, from which it allocates\n   slightly longer routing domain
        prefixes for its attached subscriber\n   routing domains.  For GOSIP NSAPs,
        this means that a direct provider\n   would be assigned an AA identifier.
        \ Attached subscriber routing\n   domains would be assigned RD identifiers
        under the direct provider's\n   unique prefix.  For example, assume that NIST
        is a subscriber routing\n   domain whose sole inter-domain link is via SURANet.
        \ If SURANet is\n   assigned an AA identifier kkk, NIST could be assigned
        an RD of jjj,\n   resulting in a unique prefix for SURANet of:\n   AFI=47,
        IDI=0005, DFI=80h, AA=kkk\n   and a unique prefix for NIST of\n   AFI=47,
        IDI=0005, DFI=80h, AA=kkk, (Rsvd=0), RD=jjj.\n   A similar scheme can be established
        using NSAPs allocated under\n   DCC=840.  In this case, a direct provider
        applies for an ORG\n   identifier from ANSI, which serves the same purpose
        as the AA\n   identifier in GOSIP.\n"

    - contents:
      - "5.3.2.  Indirect Providers\n   There does not appear to be a strong case
        for direct service\n   providers to take their address spaces from the NSAP
        space of an\n   indirect provider (e.g. backbone in today's terms).  The benefit
        in\n   routing data abstraction is relatively small.  The number of direct\n
        \  providers today is in the tens and an order of magnitude increase\n   would
        not cause an undue burden on the indirect providers.  Also, it\n   may be
        expected that as time goes by there will be increased direct\n   inter-connection
        of the direct providers, subscriber routing domains\n   directly attached
        to the \"indirect\" providers, and international\n   links directly attached
        to the providers.  Under these circumstances,\n   the distinction between
        direct and indirect providers would become\n   blurred.\n   An additional
        factor that discourages allocation of NSAPs from an\n   indirect provider's
        prefix is that the indirect providers and their\n   attached direct providers
        are perceived as being independent.  Direct\n   providers may take their indirect
        provider service from one or more\n   providers, or may switch indirect providers

    - "5.4.  Multi-homed Routing Domains\n   The discussions in Section 5.3 suggest
      methods for allocating NSAP\n   addresses based on service provider connectivity.
      \ This allows a\n   great deal of information reduction to be achieved for those
      routing\n   domains which are attached to a single provider.  In particular,
      such\n   routing domains may select their NSAP addresses from a space\n   allocated
      to them by their direct service provider.  This allows the\n   provider, when
      announcing the addresses that it can reach to other\n   providers, to use a
      single address prefix to describe a large number\n   of NSAP addresses corresponding
      to multiple routing domains.\n   However, there are additional considerations
      for routing domains\n   which are attached to multiple providers.  Such \"multi-homed\"
      routing\n   domains may, for example, consist of single-site campuses and\n
      \  companies which are attached to multiple providers, large\n   organizations
      which are attached to different providers at different\n   locations in the
      same country, or multi-national organizations which\n   are attached to providers
      in a variety of countries worldwide.  There\n   are a number of possible ways
      to deal with these multi-homed routing\n   domains.\n   One possible solution
      is to assign addresses to each multi-homed\n   organization independently from
      the providers to which it is\n   attached.  This allows each multi-homed organization
      to base its NSAP\n   assignments on a single prefix, and to thereby summarize
      the set of\n   all NSAPs reachable within that organization via a single prefix.\n
      \  The disadvantage of this approach is that since the NSAP address for\n   that
      organization has no relationship to the addresses of any\n   particular provider,
      the providers to which this organization is\n   attached will need to advertise
      the prefix for this organization to\n   other providers.  Other providers (potentially
      worldwide) will need\n   to maintain an explicit entry for that organization
      in their routing\n   tables.  If other providers do not maintain a separate
      route for this\n   organization, then packets destined to this organization
      will be\n   lost.\n   For example, suppose that a very large U.S.-wide company
      \"Mega Big\n   International Incorporated\" (MBII) has a fully interconnected\n
      \  internal network and is assigned a single AA value under the U.S.\n   GOSIP
      Version 2 address space.  It is likely that outside of the\n   U.S., a single
      entry may be maintained in routing tables for all U.S.\n   GOSIP addresses.
      \ However, within the U.S., every \"default-less\"\n   provider will need to
      maintain a separate address entry for MBII.  If\n   MBII is in fact an international
      corporation, then it may be\n   necessary for every \"default-less\" provider
      worldwide to maintain a\n   separate entry for MBII (including providers to
      which MBII is not\n   attached).  Clearly this may be acceptable if there are
      a small\n   number of such multihomed routing domains, but would place an\n
      \  unacceptable load on routers within providers if all organizations\n   were
      to choose such address assignments.  This solution may not scale\n   to internets
      where there are many hundreds of thousands of multi-\n   homed organizations.\n
      \  A second possible approach would be for multi-homed organizations to\n   be
      assigned a separate NSAP space for each connection to a provider,\n   and to
      assign a single address prefix to each area within its routing\n   domain(s)
      based on the closest interconnection point.  For example,\n   if MBII had connections
      to two providers in the U.S. (one east coast,\n   and one west coast), as well
      as three connections to national\n   providers in Europe, and one in the far
      east, then MBII may make use\n   of six different address prefixes.  Each area
      within MBII would be\n   assigned a single address prefix based on the nearest
      connection.\n   For purposes of external routing of traffic from outside MBII
      to a\n   destination inside of MBII, this approach works similarly to treating\n
      \  MBII as six separate organizations.  For purposes of internal\n   routing,
      or for routing traffic from inside of MBII to a destination\n   outside of MBII,
      this approach works the same as the first solution.\n   If we assume that incoming
      traffic (coming from outside of MBII, with\n   a destination within MBII) is
      always to enter via the nearest point\n   to the destination, then each provider
      which has a connection to MBII\n   needs to announce to other providers the
      ability to reach only those\n   parts of MBII whose address is taken from its
      own address space.\n   This implies that no additional routing information needs
      to be\n   exchanged between providers, resulting in a smaller load on the\n
      \  inter-domain routing tables maintained by providers when compared to\n   the
      first solution.  This solution therefore scales better to\n   extremely large
      internets containing very large numbers of multi-\n   homed organizations.\n
      \  One problem with the second solution is that backup routes to multi-\n   homed
      organizations are not automatically maintained.  With the first\n   solution,
      each provider, in announcing the ability to reach MBII,\n   specifies that it
      is able to reach all of the NSAPs within MBII.\n   With the second solution,
      each provider announces that it can reach\n   all of the NSAPs based on its
      own address prefix, which only includes\n   some of the NSAPs within MBII.  If
      the connection between MBII and\n   one particular provider were severed, then
      the NSAPs within MBII with\n   addresses based on that provider would become
      unreachable via inter-\n   domain routing.  The impact of this problem can be
      reduced somewhat\n   by maintenance of additional information within routing
      tables, but\n   this reduces the scaling advantage of the second approach.\n
      \  The second solution also requires that when external connectivity\n   changes,
      internal addresses also change.\n   Also note that this and the previous approach
      will tend to cause\n   packets to take different routes.  With the first approach,
      packets\n   from outside of MBII destined for within MBII will tend to enter
      via\n   the point which is closest to the source (which will therefore tend\n
      \  to maximize the load on the networks internal to MBII).  With the\n   second
      solution, packets from outside destined for within MBII will\n   tend to enter
      via the point which is closest to the destination\n   (which will tend to minimize
      the load on the networks within MBII,\n   and maximize the load on the providers).\n
      \  These solutions also have different effects on policies.  For\n   example,
      suppose that country \"X\" has a law that traffic from a\n   source within country
      X to a destination within country X must at all\n   times stay entirely within
      the country.  With the first solution, it\n   is not possible to determine from
      the destination address whether or\n   not the destination is within the country.
      \ With the second solution,\n   a separate address may be assigned to those
      NSAPs which are within\n   country X, thereby allowing routing policies to be
      followed.\n   Similarly, suppose that \"Little Small Company\" (LSC) has a policy\n
      \  that its packets may never be sent to a destination that is within\n   MBII.
      \ With either solution, the routers within LSC may be configured\n   to discard
      any traffic that has a destination within MBII's address\n   space.  However,
      with the first solution this requires one entry;\n   with the second it requires
      many entries and may be impossible as a\n   practical matter.\n   There are
      other possible solutions as well.  A third approach is to\n   assign each multi-homed
      organization a single address prefix, based\n   on one of its connections to
      a provider.  Other providers to which\n   the multi-homed organization are attached
      maintain a routing table\n   entry for the organization, but are extremely selective
      in terms of\n   which indirect providers are told of this route.  This approach
      will\n   produce a single \"default\" routing entry which all providers will\n
      \  know how to reach the organization (since presumably all providers\n   will
      maintain routes to each other), while providing more direct\n   routing in those
      cases where providers agree to maintain additional\n   routing information.\n
      \  There is at least one situation in which this third approach is\n   particularly
      appropriate.  Suppose that a special interest group of\n   organizations have
      deployed their own backbone.  For example, lets\n   suppose that the U.S. National
      Widget Manufacturers and Researchers\n   have set up a U.S.-wide backbone, which
      is used by corporations who\n   manufacture widgets, and certain universities
      which are known for\n   their widget research efforts.  We can expect that the
      various\n   organizations which are in the widget group will run their internal\n
      \  networks as separate routing domains, and most of them will also be\n   attached
      to other providers (since most of the organizations involved\n   in widget manufacture
      and research will also be involved in other\n   activities).  We can therefore
      expect that many or most of the\n   organizations in the widget group are dual-homed,
      with one attachment\n   for widget-associated communications and the other attachment
      for\n   other types of communications.  Let's also assume that the total\n   number
      of organizations involved in the widget group is small enough\n   that it is
      reasonable to maintain a routing table containing one\n   entry per organization,
      but that they are distributed throughout a\n   larger internet with many millions
      of (mostly not widget-associated)\n   routing domains.\n   With the third approach,
      each multi-homed organization in the widget\n   group would make use of an address
      assignment based on its other\n   attachment(s) to providers (the attachments
      not associated with the\n   widget group).  The widget backbone would need to
      maintain routes to\n   the routing domains associated with the various member
      organizations.\n   Similarly, all members of the widget group would need to
      maintain a\n   table of routes to the other members via the widget backbone.\n
      \  However, since the widget backbone does not inform other general\n   world-wide
      providers of what addresses it can reach (since the\n   backbone is not intended
      for use by other outside organizations), the\n   relatively large set of routing
      prefixes needs to be maintained only\n   in a limited number of places.  The
      addresses assigned to the various\n   organizations which are members of the
      widget group would provide a\n   \"default route\" via each members other attachments
      to providers,\n   while allowing communications within the widget group to use
      the\n   preferred path.\n   A fourth solution involves assignment of a particular
      address prefix\n   for routing domains which are attached to two or more specific\n
      \  cooperative public service providers.  For example, suppose that\n   there
      are two providers \"SouthNorthNet\" and \"NorthSouthNet\" which\n   have a very
      large number of customers in common (i.e., there are a\n   large number of routing
      domains which are attached to both).  Rather\n   than getting two address prefixes
      (such as two AA values assigned\n   under the GOSIP address space) these organizations
      could obtain three\n   prefixes.  Those routing domains which are attached to
      NorthSouthNet\n   but not attached to SouthNorthNet obtain an address assignment
      based\n   on one of the prefixes.  Those routing domains which are attached
      to\n   SouthNorthNet but not to NorthSouthNet would obtain an address based\n
      \  on the second prefix.  Finally, those routing domains which are\n   multi-homed
      to both of these networks would obtain an address based\n   on the third prefix.
      \ Each of these two providers would then\n   advertise two prefixes to other
      providers, one prefix for subscriber\n   routing domains attached to it only,
      and one prefix for subscriber\n   routing domains attached to both.\n   This
      fourth solution could become important when use of public data\n   networks
      becomes more common.  In particular, it is likely that at\n   some point in
      the future a substantial percentage of all routing\n   domains will be attached
      to public data networks.  In this case,\n   nearly all government-sponsored
      networks (such as some regional\n   networks which receive funding from NSF,
      as well as government\n   sponsored backbones) may have a set of customers which
      overlaps\n   substantially with the public networks.\n   There are therefore
      a number of possible solutions to the problem of\n   assigning NSAP addresses
      to multi-homed routing domains.  Each of\n   these solutions has very different
      advantages and disadvantages.\n   Each solution places a different real (i.e.,
      financial) cost on the\n   multi-homed organizations, and on the providers (including
      those to\n   which the multi-homed organizations are not attached).\n   In addition,
      most of the solutions described also highlight the need\n   for each provider
      to develop policy on whether and under what\n   conditions to accept customers
      with addresses that are not based on\n   its own address prefix, and how such
      non-local addresses will be\n   treated.  For example, a somewhat conservative
      policy might be that\n   an attached subscriber RD may use any NSAP address
      prefix, but that\n   addresses which are not based on the providers own prefix
      might not\n   be advertised to other providers.  In a less conservative policy,
      a\n   provider might accept customers using such non-local prefixes and\n   agree
      to exchange them in routing information with a defined set of\n   other providers
      (this set could be an a priori group of providers\n   that have something in
      common such as geographical location, or the\n   result of an agreement specific
      to the requesting subscriber).\n   Various policies involve real costs to providers,
      which may be\n   reflected in those policies.\n"

    - "5.5.  Private Links\n   The discussion up to this point concentrates on the
      relationship\n   between NSAP addresses and routing between various routing
      domains\n   over transit routing domains, where each transit routing domain\n
      \  interconnects a large number of routing domains and offers a more-\n   or-less
      public service.\n   However, there may also exist a large number of private
      point-to-\n   point links which interconnect two private routing domains.  In
      many\n   cases such private point-to-point links may be limited to forwarding\n
      \  packets directly between the two private routing domains.\n   For example,
      let's suppose that the XYZ corporation does a lot of\n   business with MBII.
      \ In this case, XYZ and MBII may contract with a\n   carrier to provide a private
      link between the two corporations, where\n   this link may only be used for
      packets whose source is within one of\n   the two corporations, and whose destination
      is within the other of\n   the two corporations.  Finally, suppose that the
      point-to-point link\n   is connected between a single router (router X) within
      XYZ\n   corporation and a single router (router M) within MBII.  It is\n   therefore
      necessary to configure router X to know which addresses can\n   be reached over
      this link (specifically, all addresses reachable in\n   MBII).  Similarly, it
      is necessary to configure router M to know\n   which addresses can be reached
      over this link (specifically, all\n   addresses reachable in XYZ Corporation).\n
      \  The important observation to be made here is that such private links\n   may
      be ignored for the purpose of NSAP allocation, and do not pose a\n   problem
      for routing.  This is because the routing information\n   associated with private
      links is not propagated throughout the\n   internet, and therefore does not
      need to be collapsed into a\n   provider's prefix.\n   In our example, lets
      suppose that the XYZ corporation has a single\n   connection to a service provider,
      and has therefore received an\n   address allocation from the space administered
      by that provider.\n   Similarly, let's suppose that MBII, as an international
      corporation\n   with connections to six different providers, has chosen the
      second\n   solution from Section 5.4, and therefore has obtained six different\n
      \  address allocations.  In this case, all addresses reachable in the\n   XYZ
      Corporation can be described by a single address prefix (implying\n   that router
      M only needs to be configured with a single address\n   prefix to represent
      the addresses reachable over this point-to-point\n   link).  All addresses reachable
      in MBII can be described by six\n   address prefixes (implying that router X
      needs to be configured with\n   six address prefixes to represent the addresses
      reachable over the\n   point-to-point link).\n   In some cases, such private
      point-to-point links may be permitted to\n   forward traffic for a small number
      of other routing domains, such as\n   closely affiliated organizations.  This
      will increase the\n   configuration requirements slightly.  However, provided
      that the\n   number of organizations using the link is relatively small, then
      this\n   still does not represent a significant problem.\n   Note that the relationship
      between routing and NSAP addressing\n   described in other sections of this
      paper is concerned with problems\n   in scaling caused by large, essentially
      public transit routing\n   domains which interconnect a large number of routing
      domains.\n   However, for the purpose of NSAP allocation, private point-to-point\n
      \  links which interconnect only a small number of private routing\n   domains
      do not pose a problem, and may be ignored.  For example, this\n   implies that
      a single subscriber routing domain which has a single\n   connection to a \"public\"
      provider, plus a number of private point-\n   to-point links to other subscriber
      routing domains, can be treated as\n   if it were single-homed to the provider
      for the purpose of NSAP\n   address allocation.\n"

    - "5.6.  Zero-Homed Routing Domains\n   Currently, a very large number of organizations
      have internal\n   communications networks which are not connected to any external\n
      \  network.  Such organizations may, however, have a number of private\n   point-to-point
      links that they use for communications with other\n   organizations.  Such organizations
      do not participate in global\n   routing, but are satisfied with reachability
      to those organizations\n   with which they have established private links.  These
      are referred\n   to as zero-homed routing domains.\n   Zero-homed routing domains
      can be considered as the degenerate case\n   of routing domains with private
      links, as discussed in the previous\n   section, and do not pose a problem for
      inter-domain routing.  As\n   above, the routing information exchanged across
      the private links\n   sees very limited distribution, usually only to the RD
      at the other\n   end of the link.  Thus, there are no address abstraction requirements\n
      \  beyond those inherent in the address prefixes exchanged across the\n   private
      link.\n   However, it is important that zero-homed routing domains use valid\n
      \  globally unique NSAP addresses.  Suppose that the zero-homed routing\n   domain
      is connected through a private link to an RD.  Further, this\n   RD participates
      in an internet that subscribes to the global OSI\n   addressing plan (i.e.,
      ISO 8348).  This RD must be able to\n   distinguish between the zero-homed routing
      domain's NSAPs and any\n   other NSAPs that it may need to route to.  The only
      way this can be\n   guaranteed is if the zero-homed routing domain uses globally

    - "5.7.  Address Transition Issues\n   Allocation of NSAP addresses based on connectivity
      to providers is\n   important to allow scaling of inter-domain routing to an
      internet\n   containing millions of routing domains.  However, such address\n
      \  allocation based on topology also implies that a change in topology\n   may
      result in a change of address.\n   This need to allow for change in addresses
      is a natural, inevitable\n   consequence of any method for routing data abstraction.
      \ The basic\n   notion of routing data abstraction is that there is some\n   correspondence
      between the address and where a system (i.e., a\n   routing domain, area, or
      end system) is located.  Thus if the system\n   moves, in some cases the address
      will have to change.  If it were\n   possible to change the connectivity between
      routing domains without\n   changing the addresses, then it would clearly be
      necessary to keep\n   track of the location of that routing domain on an individual
      basis.\n   Because of the rapid growth and increased commercialization of the\n
      \  Internet, it is possible that the topology may be relatively\n   volatile.
      \ This implies that planning for address transition is very\n   important.  Fortunately,
      there are a number of steps which can be\n   taken to help ease the effort required
      for address transition.  A\n   complete description of address transition issues
      is outside of the\n   scope of this paper.  However, a very brief outline of
      some\n   transition issues is contained in this section.\n   Also note that
      the possible requirement to transition addresses based\n   on changes in topology
      imply that it is valuable to anticipate the\n   future topology changes before
      finalizing a plan for address\n   allocation.  For example, in the case of a
      routing domain which is\n   initially single-homed, but which is expecting to
      become multi-homed\n   in the future, it may be advantageous to assign NSAP
      addresses based\n   on the anticipated future topology.\n   In general, it will
      not be practical to transition the NSAP addresses\n   assigned to a routing
      domain in an instantaneous \"change the address\n   at midnight\" manner.  Instead,
      a gradual transition is required in\n   which both the old and the new addresses
      will remain valid for a\n   limited period of time.  During the transition period,
      both the old\n   and new addresses are accepted by the end systems in the routing\n
      \  domain, and both old and new addresses must result in correct routing\n   of
      packets to the destination.\n   Provision for transition has already been built
      into IS-IS.  As\n   described in Section 3, IS-IS allows multiple addresses
      to be\n   assigned to each area specifically for the purpose of easing\n   transition.\n
      \  Similarly, there are provisions in OSI for the autoconfiguration of\n   area
      addresses.  This allows OSI end systems to find out their area\n   addresses
      automatically, either by passively observing the ES-IS IS-\n   Hello packets
      transmitted by routers, or by actively querying the\n   routers for their NSAP
      address.  If the ID portion of the address is\n   assigned in a manner which
      allows for globally unique IDs [18], then\n   an end system can reconfigure
      its entire NSAP address automatically\n   without the need for manual intervention.
      \ However, routers will\n   still require manual address reconfiguration.\n
      \  During the transition period, it is important that packets using the\n   old
      address be forwarded correctly, even when the topology has\n   changed.  This
      is facilitated by the use of \"best match\" inter-domain\n   routing.\n   For
      example, suppose that the XYZ Corporation was previously\n   connected only
      to the NorthSouthNet provider.  The XYZ Corporation\n   therefore went off to
      the NorthSouthNet administration and got a\n   routing domain assignment based
      on the AA value obtained by the\n   NorthSouthNet under the GOSIP address space.
      \ However, for a variety\n   of reasons, the XYZ Corporation decided to terminate
      its association\n   with the North-SouthNet, and instead connect directly to
      the\n   NewCommercialNet public data network.  Thus the XYZ Corporation now\n
      \  has a new address assignment under the ANSI address assigned to the\n   NewCommercialNet.
      \ The old address for the XYZ Corporation would seem\n   to imply that traffic
      for the XYZ Corporation should be routed to the\n   NorthSouthNet, which no
      longer has any direct connection with XYZ\n   Corporation.\n   If the old provider
      (NorthSouthNet) and the new provider\n   (NewCommercialNet) are adjacent and
      cooperative, then this transition\n   is easy to accomplish.  In this case,
      packets routed to the XYZ\n   Corporation using the old address assignment could
      be routed to the\n   NorthSouthNet, which would directly forward them to the\n
      \  NewCommercialNet, which would in turn forward them to XYZ\n   Corporation.
      \ In this case only NorthSouthNet and NewCommercialNet\n   need be aware of
      the fact that the old address refers to a\n   destination which is no longer
      directly attached to NorthSouthNet.\n   If the old provider and the new provider
      are not adjacent, then the\n   situation is a bit more complex, but there are
      still several possible\n   ways to forward traffic correctly.\n   If the old
      provider and the new provider are themselves connected by\n   other cooperative
      providers, then these intermediate domains may\n   agree to forward traffic
      for XYZ correctly.  For example, suppose\n   that NorthSouthNet and NewCommercialNet
      are not directly connected,\n   but that they are both directly connected to
      the NSFNET backbone.  In\n   this case, all three of NorthSouthNet, NewCommercialNet,
      and the\n   NSFNET backbone would need to maintain a special entry for XYZ\n
      \  corporation so that traffic to XYZ using the old address allocation\n   would
      be forwarded via NewCommercialNet.  However, other routing\n   domains would
      not need to be aware of the new location for XYZ\n   Corporation.\n   Suppose
      that the old provider and the new provider are separated by a\n   non-cooperative
      routing domain, or by a long path of routing domains.\n   In this case, the
      old provider could encapsulate traffic to XYZ\n   Corporation in order to deliver
      such packets to the correct backbone.\n   Also, those locations which do a significant
      amount of business with\n   XYZ Corporation could have a specific entry in their
      routing tables\n   added to ensure optimal routing of packets to XYZ.  For example,\n
      \  suppose that another commercial backbone \"OldCommercialNet\" has a\n   large
      number of customers which exchange traffic with XYZ\n   Corporation, and that
      this third provider is directly connected to\n   both NorthSouthNet and NewCommercialNet.
      \ In this case\n   OldCommercialNet will continue to have a single entry in
      its routing\n   tables for other traffic destined for NorthSouthNet, but may
      choose\n   to add one additional (more specific) entry to ensure that packets\n
      \  sent to XYZ Corporation's old address are routed correctly.\n   Whichever
      method is used to ease address transition, the goal is that\n   knowledge relating
      XYZ to its old address that is held throughout the\n   global internet would
      eventually be replaced with the new\n   information.  It is reasonable to expect
      this to take weeks or months\n   and will be accomplished through the distributed
      directory system.\n   Discussion of the directory, along with other address
      transition\n   techniques such as automatically informing the source of a changed\n
      \  address, are outside the scope of this paper.\n"

  - "6.  Recommendations\n   We anticipate that the current exponential growth of
    the Internet\n   will continue or accelerate for the foreseeable future.  In addition,\n
    \  we anticipate a continuation of the rapid internationalization of the\n   Internet.
    \ The ability of routing to scale is dependent upon the use\n   of data abstraction
    based on hierarchical NSAP addresses.  As CLNP\n   use increases in the Internet,
    it is therefore essential to assign\n   NSAP addresses with great care.\n   It
    is in the best interests of the internetworking community that the\n   cost of
    operations be kept to a minimum where possible.  In the case\n   of NSAP allocation,
    this again means that routing data abstraction\n   must be encouraged.\n   In
    order for data abstraction to be possible, the assignment of NSAP\n   addresses
    must be accomplished in a manner which is consistent with\n   the actual physical
    topology of the Internet.  For example, in those\n   cases where organizational
    and administrative boundaries are not\n   related to actual network topology,
    address assignment based on such\n   organization boundaries is not recommended.\n
    \  The intra-domain IS-IS routing protocol allows for information\n   abstraction
    to be maintained at two levels: systems are grouped into\n   areas, and areas
    are interconnected to form a routing domain.  The\n   inter-domain IDRP routing
    protocol allows for information abstraction\n   to be maintained at multiple levels
    by grouping routing domains into\n   Routing Domain Confederations and using route
    aggregation\n   capabilities.\n   For zero-homed and single-homed routing domains
    (which are expected\n   to remain zero-homed or single-homed), we recommend that
    the NSAP\n   addresses assigned for OSI use within a single routing domain use
    a\n   single address prefix assigned to that domain.  Specifically, this\n   allows
    the set of all NSAP addresses reachable within a single domain\n   to be fully
    described via a single prefix.  We recommend that\n   single-homed routing domains
    use an address prefix based on its\n   connectivity to a public service provider.
    \ We recommend that zero-\n   homed routing domains use globally unique addresses.\n
    \  We anticipate that the total number of routing domains existing on a\n   worldwide
    OSI Internet to be great enough that additional levels of\n   hierarchical data
    abstraction beyond the routing domain level will be\n   necessary.  To provide
    the needed data abstraction we recommend to\n   use Routing Domain Confederations
    and route aggregation capabilities\n   of IDRP.\n   The general technical requirements
    for NSAP address guidelines do not\n   vary from country to country.  However,
    details of address\n   administration may vary between countries.  Also, in most
    cases,\n   network topology will have a close relationship with national\n   boundaries.
    \ For example, the degree of network connectivity will\n   often be greater within
    a single country than between countries.  It\n   is therefore appropriate to make
    specific recommendations based on\n   national boundaries, with the understanding
    that there may be\n   specific situations where these general recommendations
    need to be\n   modified.  Moreover, that suggests that national boundaries may
    be\n   used to group domains into Routing Domain Confederations.\n   Each of the
    country-specific or continent-specific recommendations\n   presented below are
    consistent with the technical requirements for\n   scaling of addressing and routing
    presented in this RFC.\n"

    - "6.1.  Recommendations Specific to U.S. Parts of the Internet\n   NSAP addresses
      for use within the U.S. portion of the Internet are\n   expected to be based
      primarily on two address prefixes: the ICD=0005\n   format used by The U.S.
      Government, and the DCC=840 format defined by\n   ANSI.\n   We anticipate that,
      in the U.S., public interconnectivity between\n   private routing domains will
      be provided by a diverse set of\n   providers, including (but not necessarily
      limited to) regional\n   providers and commercial Public Data Networks.\n   These
      networks are not expected to be interconnected in a strictly\n   hierarchical
      manner.  For example, the regional providers may be\n   directly connected rather
      than rely on an indirect provider, and all\n   three of these types of networks
      may have direct international\n   connections.\n   However, the total number
      of such providers is expected to remain\n   (for the foreseeable future) small
      enough to allow addressing of this\n   set of providers via a flat address space.
      \ These providers will be\n   used to interconnect a wide variety of routing
      domains, each of which\n   may comprise a single corporation, part of a corporation,
      a\n   university campus, a government agency, or other organizational unit.\n
      \  In addition, some private corporations may be expected to make use of\n   dedicated
      private providers for communication within their own\n   corporations.\n   We
      anticipate that the great majority of routing domains will be\n   attached to
      only one of the providers.  This will permit hierarchical\n   address abbreviation
      based on provider.  We therefore strongly\n   recommend that addresses be assigned
      hierarchically, based on address\n   prefixes assigned to individual providers.\n
      \  For the GOSIP address format, this implies that Administrative\n   Authority
      (AA) identifiers should be obtained by all providers\n   (explicitly including
      the NSFNET backbone, the NSFNET regionals, and\n   other major government backbones).
      \ For those subscriber routing\n   domains which are connected to a single provider,
      they should be\n   assigned a Routing Domain (RD) value from the space assigned
      to that\n   provider.\n   To provide routing information aggregation/abstraction
      we recommend\n   that each provider together with all of its subscriber domains
      form a\n   Routing Domain Confederation.  That, combined with  hierarchical\n
      \  address assignment, would provide significant reduction in the volume\n   of
      routing information that needs to be handled by IDRP.  Note that\n   the presence
      of multihomed subscriber domains would imply that such\n   Confederations will
      overlap, which is explicitly supported by IDRP.\n   We recommend that all providers
      explicitly be involved in the task of\n   address administration for those subscriber
      routing domains which are\n   single-homed to them.  This offers a valuable
      service to their\n   customers, and also greatly reduces the resources (including
      human\n   and network resources) necessary for that provider to take part in\n
      \  inter-domain routing.\n   Each provider should develop policy on whether
      and under what\n   conditions to accept customers using addresses that are not
      based on\n   the provider's own address prefix, and how such non-local addresses\n
      \  will be treated.  Policies should reflect the issue of cost\n   associated
      with implementing such policies.\n   We recommend that a similar hierarchical
      model be used for NSAP\n   addresses using the DCC-based address format.  The
      structure for\n   DCC=840-based NSAPs is provided in Section A.2.\n   For routing
      domains which are not attached to any publically-\n   available provider, no
      urgent need for hierarchical address\n   abbreviation exists.  We do not, therefore,
      make any additional\n   recommendations for such \"isolated\" routing domains,
      except to note\n   that there is no technical reason to preclude assignment
      of GOSIP AA\n   identifier values or ANSI organization identifiers to such domains.\n
      \  Where such domains are connected to other domains by private point-\n   to-point
      links, and where such links are used solely for routing\n   between the two
      domains that they interconnect, no additional\n   technical problems relating
      to address abbreviation is caused by such\n   a link, and no specific additional
      recommendations are necessary.\n"

        is ensured by there being\n   the NSO a single national body that allocates
        the CDPs.\n   The CDP is further divided into CFI and CDI, where the CFI identifies\n
        \  the format of the CDI.  The importance of this is that it enables\n   several
        types of CDI to be assigned in parallel, corresponding to\n   organizations
        \ with different requirements and giving different\n   amounts of the total
        address space to them, and that it conveniently\n   enables a substantial
        amount of address space to be reserved for\n   future allocation.\n   The

      will be attached to multiple providers within\n   the same country, or to providers
      within multiple countries.  We\n   refer to these as \"multi-homed\" routing
      domains.  Clearly the strict\n   hierarchical model discussed above does not
      neatly handle such\n   routing domains.\n   There are several possible ways
      that these multi-homed routing\n   domains may be handled.  Each of these methods
      vary with respect to\n   the amount of information that must be maintained for
      inter-domain\n   routing and also with respect to the inter-domain routes.  In\n
      \  addition, the organization that will bear the brunt of this cost\n   varies
      with the possible solutions.  For example, the solutions vary\n   with respect
      to:\n   * resources used within routers within the providers;\n   * administrative
      cost on provider personnel; and,\n   * difficulty of configuration of policy-based
      inter-domain\n     routing information within subscriber routing domains.\n
      \  Also, the solution used may affect the actual routes which packets\n   follow,
      and may effect the availability of backup routes when the\n   primary route
      fails.\n   For these reasons it is not possible to mandate a single solution
      for\n   all situations.  Rather, economic considerations will require a\n   variety
      of solutions for different subscriber routing domains and\n   providers.\n"

    through the Network\n   Layer and must be globally unique [4].  ISO 8348 defines
    the\n   semantics of the NSAP and the abstract syntaxes in which the\n   semantics
    of the Network address can be expressed [11].\n   The NSAP consists of the initial
    domain part (IDP) and the domain\n   specific part (DSP).  The initial domain
    part of the NSAP consists of\n   an authority and format identifier (AFI) and
    an initial domain\n   identifier (IDI).  The AFI specifies the format of the IDI,
    the\n   network addressing authority responsible for allocating values of the\n
    \  IDI, and the abstract syntax of the DSP.  The IDI specifies the\n   addressing
    subdomain from which values of the DSP are allocated and\n   the network addressing
    authority responsible for allocating values of\n   the DSP from that domain.  The
    structure and semantics of the DSP are\n   determined by the authority identified
    by the IDI.  Figure 3 shows\n   the NSAP address structure.\n     +-----------+\n

    \ Within that environment, seven\n   second-level addressing domains and corresponding
    IDI formats are\n   described in ISO 8348:\n      * X.121 for public data networks\n
    \     * F.69 for telex\n      * E.163 for the public switched telephone network
    numbers\n      * E.164 for ISDN numbers\n      * ISO Data Country Code (DCC),
    allocated according to ISO 3166 [6]\n      * ISO International Code Designator
    (ICD), allocated according to\n        ISO 6523 [7]\n      * Local to accommodate
    the coexistence of OSI and non-OSI network\n        addressing schemes.\n   For
    OSI networks in the U.S., portions of the ICD subdomain are\n   available for
    use through the U.S. Government, and the DCC subdomain\n   is available for use
    through The American National Standards\n   Institute (ANSI).  The British Standards
    Institute is the\n   registration authority for the ICD subdomain, and has registered
    four\n   IDIs for the U.S. Government: those used for GOSIP, DoD, OSINET, and\n
    \  the OSI Implementors Workshop.  ANSI, as the U.S. ISO Member Body, is\n   the

      use an NSAP addressing\n   subdomain with a corresponding address format as
      illustrated in\n   Figure 2 in Section 4.2.  The \"47\" signifies that it is
      based on the\n   ICD format and uses a binary syntax for the DSP.  The 0005
      is an IDI\n   value which has been assigned to the U.S. Government.  Although
      GOSIP\n   Version 2 NSAPs are intended primarily for U.S. Government use,\n
      \  requests from non-government and non-U.S. organizations will be\n   considered
      on a case-by-case basis.\n   The format for the DSP under ICD=0005 has been
      established by the\n   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
      the authority\n   for the ICD=0005 domain, in GOSIP Version 2 [3] (see Figure
      2,\n   Section 4.2).  NIST has delegated the authority to register AA\n   identifiers
      for GOSIP Version 2 NSAPs to the General Services\n   Administration (GSA).\n
      \  ISO 8348 allows a maximum length of 20 octets for the NSAP address.\n   The
      AFI of 47 occupies one octet, and the IDI of 0005 occupies two\n   octets.  The
      DSP is encoded as binary as indicated by the AFI of 47.\n   One octet is allocated
      for a DSP Format Identifier, three octets for\n   an Administrative Authority
      identifier, two octets for Routing\n   Domain, two octets for Area, six octets
      for the System Identifier,\n   and one octet for the NSAP selector.  Note that
      two octets have been\n   reserved to accommodate future growth and to provide
      additional\n   flexibility for inter-domain routing.  The last seven octets
      of the\n   GOSIP NSAP format are structured in accordance with IS-IS [14], the\n
      \  intra-domain IS-IS routing protocol.  The DSP Format Identifier (DFI)\n   identifies
      the format of the remaining DSP structure and may be used\n   in the future
      to identify additional DSP formats; the value 80h in\n   the DFI identifies
      the GOSIP Version 2 NSAP structure.\n   The Administrative Authority identifier
      names the administrative\n   authority which is responsible for registration
      within its domain.\n   The administrative authority may delegate the responsibilityfor\n
      \  registering areas to the routing domains, and the routing domains may\n   delegate
      the authority to register System Identifiers to the areas.\n   The main responsibility
      of a registration authority at any level of\n   the addressing hierarchy is
      to assure that names of entities are\n   unambiguous, i.e., no two entities
      have the same name.  The\n   registration authority is also responsible for
      advertising the names.\n   A routing domain is a set of end systems and intermediate
      systems\n   which operate according to the same routing procedures and is wholly\n

        followed by an administrative\n   authority in making NSAP assignments are
        given below.\n      * The authority should determine the degree of structure
        of the\n        DSP under its control.  Further delegation of address assignment\n
        \       authority (resulting in additional levels of hierarchy in the\n        NSAP)
        may be desired.\n      * The authority should make sure that portions of NSAPs
        that it\n        specifies are unique, current, and accurate.\n      * The
        authority should ensure that procedures exist for\n        disseminating NSAPs
        to routing domains and to areas within\n        each routing domain.\n      *
        The systems administrator must determine whether a logical or a\n        physical
        address should be used in the System Identifier field\n        (Figure 2,
        Section 4.2).  An example of a physical address is a\n        48-bit MAC address;
        a logical address is merely a number that\n        meets the uniqueness requirements
        for the System Identifier\n        field, but bears no relationship to an
        address on a physical\n        subnetwork.  We recommend that IDs should be
        assigned to be\n        globally unique, as made possible by the method described
        in\n        [18].\n      * The network address itself contains information
        that may be\n        used to aid routing, but does not contain a source route
        [12].\n        Information that enables next-hop determination based on NSAPs\n
        \       is gathered and maintained by each intermediate system through\n        routing
        protocol exchanges.\n      * GOSIP end systems and intermediate systems in
        federal agencies\n        must be capable of routing information correctly
        to and from any\n        subdomain defined by ISO 8348.\n      * An agency
        may request the assignment of more than one\n        Administrative Authority
        identifier.  The particular use of each\n        should be specified.\n"
