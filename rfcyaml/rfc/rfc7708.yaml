  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) protocol
    is\n   specified in RFC 5085 [RFC5085].  This document specifies a new VCCV\n
    \  control channel (VCCV CC) type to be used with pseudowires (PWs)\n   carried
    over an MPLS network that do not use the PW Control Word (CW)\n   [RFC4385].  This
    new VCCV CC type uses the Generic Associated Channel\n   Label (GAL) [RFC5586]
    to distinguish VCCV packets from packets\n   carrying user data.  This new VCCV
    CC type provides compatibility\n   with the method of MPLS Label Switched Path
    (LSP) Operations,\n   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) message identification,
    as used\n   in MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks [RFC5921].\n   VCCV currently
    specifies three CC types.  VCCV CC Type 1 uses the PW\n   Control Word (CW) to
    distinguish VCCV packets from packets carrying\n   user data.  VCCV CC Types 2
    and 3 require IP encapsulation for OAM\n   packets.  This was not an issue when
    [RFC5085] was designed, but it\n   is in conflict with the design goals of MPLS-TP
    [RFC5921], which do\n   not otherwise require the availability of IP.  VCCV CC
    Type 2 is not\n   applicable to Multi-Segment PWs (MS-PWs) [RFC6073].  A MS-PW\n
    \  operating without the CW therefore has to use VCCV CC Type 3, which\n   identifies
    VCCV packets on the basis of Time to Live (TTL) expiry.\n   Whilst less of an
    issue with a single segment PW (SS-PW), on an MS-PW\n   this requires accurately
    setting the TTL for expiry at the egress\n   Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE)
    [RFC6073].  In the event of an error\n   in the setting of the PW Label Stack
    Entry (LSE) TTL, VCCV packets\n   will not be received by the Terminating Provider
    Edge (T-PE) and may\n   leak into the attachment circuit [RFC6073].  The new VCCV
    CC type\n   defined in this specification addresses these problems for PWs that\n
    \  do not use the CW.\n   Note that mandating that PWs use the PW CW is not a
    viable way to\n   address this issue.  This is because:\n   o  PWs without the
    CW are already widely deployed.\n   o  There is a significant deployment of existing
    hardware that does\n      not support usage of the PW CW for some PW types.\n
    \  o  Some operators are concerned that the inclusion of the PW CW will\n      increase
    the PW packet size.\n"

    Type 4 MPLS VCCV Control Channel (CC)\n   type defined in this section MAY be
    used.  This is referred to as\n   VCCV CC Type 4 throughout the rest of this of
    this document.  VCCV CC\n   Type 4 uses the encapsulation shown in Figure 1 in
    which the presence\n   of a GAL at the end of the MPLS label stack indicates that
    the packet\n   carries a VCCV message.\n    0                   1                   2

    1\n   The VCCV message body is preceded by a Generic Associated Channel\n   Header,
    as defined in [RFC5586], in which the Channel Type identifies\n   the type and
    format of the OAM message carried in the VCCV message\n   body.\n   The GAL LSE
    MUST contain the GAL reserved label as defined in\n   [RFC5586].\n   The PW LSE
    is constructed according to the existing procedures that\n   apply to the type
    of pseudowire that is in use.\n   Where the LSP used by the PW is subject to Equal-Cost
    Multipath\n   (ECMP) load balancing, a problem arises if any LSR on that LSP treats\n
    \  special-purpose labels as ordinary labels in its ECMP selection\n   method.
    \ In these circumstances, the inclusion of a GAL following the\n   PW LSE can
    cause the OAM packet to take a different path through the\n   network than the
    corresponding PW data packets.  If the LSP traverses\n   such equipment and this
    behaviour is not acceptable, then an\n   alternative VCCV type needs to be used.
    \ The requirement to not\n   include special-purpose labels in the load-balancing
    decision is\n   described in \"MPLS Forwarding Compliance and Performance\n   Requirements\"
    [RFC7325].  For equipment that conforms to this, the\n   VCCV type 4 traffic will
    follow the corresponding PW data packets.\n"

  - "4.  FAT PWs\n   [RFC6391] specifies that when the flow-aware transport (FAT)
    of\n   pseudowires over an MPLS packet switched network has been signalled\n   or
    configured, the Flow LSE MUST be present.  It further specifies\n   that \"the
    flow label MUST NOT be an MPLS reserved label (values in\n   the range 0..15)
    [RFC3032]\", and that \"If a flow LSE is present, it\n   MUST be checked to determine
    whether it carries a reserved label.  If\n   it is a reserved label, the packet
    is processed according to the\n   rules associated with that reserved label; otherwise,
    the LSE is\n   discarded.\"\n   This document specifies that if the flow-aware
    transport of\n   pseudowires over an MPLS packet switched network has been signalled\n
    \  or configured, then the presence of VCCV message is indicated by the\n   use
    of a GAL in place of the flow LSE.\n   This is consistent with [RFC6391], and
    the packet structure is\n   identical to that shown in Figure 1.\n   Flow LSEs
    are inserted into a PW label stack in order to enable the\n   distribution of
    the PW traffic among multiple equal-cost MPLS paths.\n   The use of GAL in place
    of the flow label will cause all OAM packets\n   to take exactly one of the possible
    paths through the network.  As\n   noted in Section 3, the ECMP selection method
    may result in the path\n   taken by the OAM packets being different from the path
    taken by any\n   of the actual traffic flows.  If this is not acceptable, then
    an\n   alternative VCCV type needs be used.\n"
  title: 4.  FAT PWs
- contents:
  - "5.  Multi-Segment Pseudowires\n   When using VCCV CC Type 4 for MS-PWs, a PE
    transmitting the VCCV\n   packet to a Switching PE (S-PE) MUST set the TTL to
    the appropriate\n   value to expire at that S-PE.  An S-PE that supports this\n
    \  specification MUST inspect PW packets that are received as a result\n   of
    TTL expiry, and determine whether a GAL follows the PW LSE.  If a\n   GAL is present,
    the S-PE then processes the VCCV packet.\n   An S-PE that does not support this
    specification would be expected to\n   reject as malformed a VCCV CC Type 4 packet
    that was received.  This\n   is because the S-PE would expect the PW LSE to be
    the bottom of stack\n   (the non-FAT case) and for the LSE at the bottom of stack
    not to be a\n   reserved label (both the FAT and the non-FAT cases).  An S-PE
    that\n   did not make this reserved label check would then find that the first\n
    \  nibble following the label stack was 0x1 and not the expected start\n   of
    an IP packet.  Thus, it would be expected to also reject the\n   packet.  This
    update to the behaviour of S-PEs is therefore backwards\n   compatible.\n"

  - "6.  VCCV Capability Advertisement\n   The VCCV capability advertisement MUST
    match the C-bit setting that\n   is advertised in the PW FEC element [RFC4447].
    \ If the C-bit is set,\n   indicating the use of the PW CW, then VCCV CC Type
    4 MUST NOT be\n   advertised.  If the C-bit is not set, indicating that the PW
    CW is\n   not in use, then equipment supporting this specification MUST\n   advertise
    VCCV CC Type 4.  Advertisement of VCCV CC Type 1 and\n   advertisement of VCCV
    CC Type 4 are therefore mutually exclusive.\n   A PE supporting VCCV CC Type 4
    MAY advertise other VCCV CC types as\n   defined in [RFC5085] .\n   If the remote
    PE supports VCCV CC Type 4, and the PW CW is not in\n   use, then for cases where
    multiple CC Types are advertised, the\n   following precedence rules apply when
    choosing which CC Type to use:\n   1.  Type 4: GAL VCCV Control Channel.\n   2.
    \ Type 2: MPLS Router Alert Label.\n   3.  Type 3: MPLS PW Label with TTL == 1.\n
    \  If the remote PE finds that VCCV CC Types 1 and 4 are both\n   advertised,
    or that C-bit is set and VCCV CC Type 4 is advertised,\n   then it should report
    the error to the operator through the\n   management interface in use, and send
    a Label Release Message with a\n   status code \"VCCV Type Error\".\n"

    VCCV CC type increases the\n   number of VCCV CC types that the operator needs
    to manage, it\n   addresses the issues with VCCV CC Types 2 and 3 described in\n
    \  Section 1.\n   In the event of a misconfiguration of this VCCV CC type, the
    PW is\n   taken out of service and the operator advised as described in\n   Section
    6.\n   Attention is drawn to the possible absence of fate sharing between PW\n
    \  data packets and VCCV CC Type 4 packets described in Section 3 and\n   Section
