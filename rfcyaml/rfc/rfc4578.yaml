  - "1.  Introduction\n   These DHCP [2] options are being widely used by PXE-compliant\
    \ clients\n   to uniquely identify booting client machines themselves and their\n\
    \   pre-OS runtime environment so that the DHCP and/or PXE boot server\n   can\
    \ return the correct OS bootstrap image (or pre-boot application)\n   name and\
    \ server to the client.  In the past, this work was done by\n   examining the\
    \ network Media Access Code (MAC) address in the \"chaddr\"\n   field in the BOOTP/\
    \ DHCP header and keeping a database of MAC\n   addresses on the BOOTP/DHCP server.\
    \  This was deemed insufficient for\n   large and complex networks for two main\
    \ reasons.  1) Multiple laptops\n   could end up with the same MAC address if\
    \ the network interface was\n   in a shared docking station.  2) Multiple network\
    \ devices and MAC\n   addresses could be used by one machine for redundancy or\
    \ because of\n   repairs.  Another issue that came up was the machine that could\n\
    \   change its pre-OS runtime environment.  This issue caused the\n   creation\
    \ of another new option to identify the runtime environment so\n   that the correct\
    \ binary image could be matched up with the booting\n   machine.  These options\
    \ are defined by Intel in the PXE [3] and EFI\n   [4] specifications and are being\
    \ documented in this draft for\n   completeness within the IETF.\n"

    \ assigned for PXE use (before\n   November 2004 they were considered site-specific\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   By specifying incorrect values for some of these\
    \ options, a client\n   may get access to, and possibly attempt to execute, code\
    \ intended for\n   another platform or client.  This may have security ramifications.\n\
    \   Also note that these options contain information about a client's\n   system\
    \ architecture and pre-OS runtime environment that is revealed\n   to anyone who\
    \ is able to listen in on DHCP messages sent by the\n   client.  This information\
    \ may be of use to potential attackers.\n"
