- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Secure Hash Algorithms are specified in [SHS].  A previous\n\
    \   version of [SHS] also specified SHA-0.  SHA-0, first published in\n   1993,\
    \ and SHA-1, first published in 1996, are message digest\n   algorithms, sometimes\
    \ referred to as hash functions or hash\n   algorithms, that take as input a message\
    \ of arbitrary length and\n   produce as output a 160-bit \"fingerprint\" or \"\
    message digest\" of the\n   input.  The published attacks against both algorithms\
    \ show that it is\n   not prudent to use either algorithm when collision resistance\
    \ is\n   required.\n   [HASH-Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in Internet\
    \ protocols and\n   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's\
    \ one-way\n   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet\n\
    \   protocols.  Familiarity with [HASH-Attack] is assumed.\n   Some may find the\
    \ guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in\n   [SP800-57] and [SP800-131]\
    \ useful.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  SHA-0 Security Considerations\n   What follows are summaries of recent attacks\
    \ against SHA-0's\n   collision, pre-image, and second pre-image resistance. \
    \ Additionally,\n   attacks against SHA-0 when used as a keyed-hash (e.g., HMAC-SHA-0)\n\
    \   are discussed.\n   The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology\
    \ (NIST)\n   withdrew SHA-0 in 1996.  That is, NIST no longer considers it\n \
    \  appropriate to use SHA-0 for any transactions associated with the use\n   of\
    \ cryptography by U.S. federal government agencies for the\n   protection of sensitive,\
    \ but unclassified information.  SHA-0 is\n   discussed here only for the sake\
    \ of completeness.\n   Any use of SHA-0 is strongly discouraged.  Analysis of\
    \ SHA-0\n   continues today because many see it as a weaker version of SHA-1.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Collision Resistance
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Collision Resistance\n   The first attack on SHA-0 was published in 1998\
    \ [CHJO1998] and showed\n   that collisions can be found in 2^61 operations. \
    \ In 2006,\n   [NSSYK2006] showed an improved attack that can find collisions\
    \ in\n   2^36 operations.\n   In any case, the known research results indicate\
    \ that SHA-0 is not as\n   collision resistant as expected.  The collision security\
    \ strength is\n   significantly less than an ideal hash function (i.e., 2^36 compared\n\
    \   to 2^80).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance\n   The pre-image and second\
    \ pre-image attacks published on reduced\n   versions of SHA-0 (i.e., less than\
    \ 80 rounds) indicate that the\n   security margin of SHA-0 is resistant to these\
    \ attacks.  [deCARE2008]\n   showed a pre-image attack on 49 out of 80 rounds\
    \ with complexity of\n   2^159, and [AOSA2009] showed a pre-image attack on 52\
    \ out of 80\n   rounds with a complexity of 2^156.\n"
- title: 2.3. HMAC-SHA-0
  contents:
  - "2.3. HMAC-SHA-0\n   The current attack vectors on HMAC can be classified as follows:\n\
    \   distinguishing attacks, existential forgery attacks, and key recovery\n  \
    \ attacks.  Key recovery attacks are by far the most severe.\n   Attacks on hash\
    \ functions can be conducted entirely offline, since\n   the attacker can generate\
    \ unlimited message-hash value pairs.\n   Attacks on HMACs must be online because\
    \ attackers need a large amount\n   of HMAC values to deduce the key.  The best\
    \ results for a partial key\n   recovery attack on HMAC-SHA0 were published at\
    \ Asiacrypt 2006 with\n   2^84 queries and 2^60 SHA-0 computations [COYI2006].\n"

    \ attacks against SHA-1\n   when used as a keyed-hash (i.e., HMAC-SHA-1) are discussed.\n\
    \   It must be noted that NIST has recommended that SHA-1 not be used for\n  \
    \ generating digital signatures after December 31, 2010, and has\n   specified\
    \ that it not be used for generating digital signatures by\n   U.S. federal government\

- title: 3.1.  Collision Resistance
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Collision Resistance\n   The first attack on SHA-1 was published in early\
    \ 2005 [RIOS2005].\n   This attack described a theoretical attack on a version\
    \ of SHA-1\n   reduced to 53 rounds.  The very next month [WLY2005] showed\n \
    \  collisions in the full 80 rounds in 2^69 operations.  Since then,\n   many\
    \ new analysis methods have been developed to improve the attack\n   presented\
    \ in [WLY2005].  However, there are no published results that\n   improve upon\
    \ the results found in [WLY2005].  [Man2008/469], which is\n   the International\
    \ Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) ePrint\n   version of [Man2009],\
    \ claimed that using the method presented in the\n   paper, a collision of full\
    \ SHA-1 can be found in 2^51 hash function\n   calls.  However, this claim is\
    \ absent from the published conference\n   paper [Man2009].\n   In any case, the\
    \ known research results indicate that SHA-1 is not as\n   collision resistant\
    \ as expected.  The collision security strength is\n   significantly less than\
    \ an ideal hash function (i.e., 2^69 compared\n   to 2^80).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance\n   There are no known pre-image\
    \ or second pre-image attacks that are\n   specific to the full round SHA-1 algorithm.\
    \  [KeSch] discovered a\n   general result for all narrow-pipe Merkle-Damgaard\
    \ hash functions\n   (which includes SHA-1), finding a second pre-image takes\
    \ less than\n   2^n computations.  When n = 160, as is the case for SHA-1, it\
    \ will\n   take 2^106 computations to find a second pre-image in a 60-byte\n \
    \  message.\n   In the absence of full-round attacks, cryptographers consider\n\
    \   reduced-round attacks for clues regarding an algorithm's strength.\n   Reduced-round\
    \ attacks, where the number of reduced rounds is not more\n   than a few less\
    \ than the full rounds, have not been shown to relate\n   to full-round attacks.\
    \  However, the best reduced-round attack\n   indicates a certain security margin.\
    \  For example, if the best known\n   attack is on 60 out of 80 rounds, then the\
    \ algorithm has about 20\n   rounds to resist improved attacks.  However, the\
    \ relationship between\n   the number of rounds an attack can reach and the number\
    \ of rounds\n   defined in the algorithm is not linear; it does not provide a\n\
    \   mathematical proof.  In other words, reduced-round attacks indicate\n   how\
    \ strong the algorithm is with regard to a certain attack, not how\n   close it\
    \ is to being broken.  Therefore, the following information\n   about reduced-round\
    \ attacks is included only for completeness.\n   The pre-image and second pre-image\
    \ attacks published on reduced\n   versions of SHA-1 (i.e., less than 80 rounds)\
    \ indicate that SHA-1\n   retains a significant security margin against these\
    \ attacks.\n   [AOSA2009] showed a pre-image attack on 48 out of 80 rounds with\n\
    \   complexity of 2^159.\n"
- title: 3.3.  HMAC-SHA-1
  contents:
  - "3.3.  HMAC-SHA-1\n   As of today, there is no indication that attacks on SHA-1\
    \ can be\n   extended to HMAC-SHA-1.\n"
- title: 4.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "4.  Conclusions\n   SHA-1 provides less collision resistance than was originally\n\
    \   expected, and collision resistance has been shown to affect some (but\n  \
    \ not all) applications that use digital signatures.  Designers of IETF\n   protocols\
    \ that use digital signature algorithms should strongly\n   consider support for\
    \ a hash algorithm with greater collision\n   resistance than that provided by\
    \ SHA-1.  Of course, SHA-0 should\n   continue to not be used in any IETF protocol.\n\
    \   [Note: Protocol designers should review the current state of the art\n   to\
    \ ensure that selected hash algorithms provide sufficient security.\n   At the\
    \ time of publication, SHA-256 [SHS] is the most commonly\n   specified alternative.\
    \  The known (reduced-round) attacks on the\n   collision resistance of SHA-256\
    \ indicate a significant security\n   margin, and the longer message digest provides\
    \ increased strength.]\n   Nearly all IETF protocols that use signatures assume\
    \ existing public\n   key infrastructures, and SHA-1 is still used in signatures\
    \ nearly\n   everywhere.  Therefore, it is unwise to strictly prohibit the use\
    \ of\n   SHA-1 in signature algorithms.  Protocols that permit the use of\n  \
    \ SHA-1-based digital signatures as an option should strongly consider\n   referencing\
    \ this document in the security considerations.\n   A protocol designer might\
    \ want to consider the use of SHA-1 with\n   randomized hashing such as is specified\
    \ in [SP800-107].  Note that\n   randomized hashing expands the size of signatures\
    \ and requires\n   protocols to carry material that is not needed today.  HMAC-SHA-1\n\
    \   remains secure and is the preferred keyed-hash algorithm for IETF\n   protocol\
    \ design.\n"
