  - "Abstract\n   The widespread interest in provider-provisioned Virtual Private\n\
    \   Network (VPN) solutions lead to memos proposing different and\n   overlapping\
    \ solutions.  The IETF working groups (first Provider\n   Provisioned VPNs and\
    \ later Layer 2 VPNs and Layer 3 VPNs) have\n   discussed these proposals and\
    \ documented specifications.  This has\n   lead to the development of a partially\
    \ new set of concepts used to\n   describe the set of VPN services.\n   To a certain\
    \ extent, more than one term covers the same concept, and\n   sometimes the same\
    \ term covers more than one concept.  This document\n   seeks to make the terminology\
    \ in the area clearer and more intuitive.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A comparatively large number of memos have been submitted\
    \ to the\n   former PPVPN working group, and to the L2VPN, L3VPN, and PWE3 working\n\
    \   groups, which all address the same problem space; provider\n   provisioned\
    \ virtual private networking for end customers.  The memos\n   address a wide\
    \ range of services, but there is also a great deal of\n   commonality among the\
    \ proposed solutions.\n   This has led to the development of a partial set of\
    \ new concepts used\n   to describe this set of VPN services.  To a certain extent,\
    \ more than\n   one term covers the same concept, and sometimes the same term\
    \ covers\n   more than one concept.\n   This document proposes a foundation for\
    \ a unified terminology for the\n   L2VPN and L3VPN working groups.  In some cases,\
    \ the parallel concepts\n   within the PWE3 working group are used as references.\n"
- title: 2.  PPVPN Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  PPVPN Terminology\n   The concepts and terms in this list are gathered from\
    \ Internet Drafts\n   sent to the L2VPN and L3VPN mailing lists (earlier the PPVPN\
    \ mailing\n   list) and RFCs relevant to the L2VPN and L3VPN working groups. \
    \ The\n   focus is on terminology and concepts that are specific to the PPVPN\n\
    \   area, but this is not strictly enforced;  e.g., some concepts and\n   terms\
    \ within the PWE3 and (Generalized) MPLS areas are closely\n   related.  We've\
    \ tried to find the earliest uses of terms and\n   concepts.\n   This document\
    \ is intended to fully cover the concepts within the core\n   documents from the\
    \ L2VPN and L3VPN working groups; i.e., [L3VPN-REQ],\n   [L2VPN-REQ], [L3VPN-FRAME],\
    \ [L2VPN], and [RFC3809].  The intention is\n   to create a comprehensive and\
    \ unified set of concepts for these\n   documents and, by extension, for the entire\
    \ PPVPN area.  To do so, it\n   is also necessary to give some of the development\
    \ the concepts of the\n   area have been through.\n   The document is structured\
    \ in four major sections.  Section 4 lists\n   the different services that have\
    \ been or will be specified Section 5\n   lists the building blocks that are used\
    \ to specify those services\n   Section 6 lists the functions needed in those\
    \ services.  Section 7\n   lists some typical devices used in customer and provider\
    \ networks.\n"

  - "3.  Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Network Services\n   In this section,\
    \ we define the terminology that relates the set of\n   services to solutions\
    \ specified by the L2VPN and L3VPN working\n   groups.  The \"pseudo wire\" concept,\
    \ which belongs to the PWE3 working\n   group, is included for reference purposes.\
    \  For requirements in\n   provider provisioned VPNs, see [L3VPN-REQ].\n   All\
    \ terms and abbreviations are listed together with a brief\n   description of\
    \ the service.  The list is structured to give the more\n   general information\
    \ first and the more specific later.  The names of\n   services for which the\
    \ IETF is working on solutions have been moved\n   to the top of the list.  Older\
    \ and more dated terminology has been\n   pushed toward the end of the list.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)\n   A VPLS is a provider service that\
    \ emulates the full functionality of\n   a traditional Local Area Network (LAN).\
    \  A VPLS makes it possible to\n   interconnect several LAN segments over a packet\
    \ switched network\n   (PSN) and makes the remote LAN segments behave as one single\
    \ LAN.\n   For an early work on defining a solution and protocol for a VPLS, see\n\
    \   [L2VPN-REQ], [VPLS-LDP], and [VPLS].\n   In a VPLS, the provider network emulates\
    \ a learning bridge, and\n   forwarding decisions are taken based on MAC addresses\
    \ or MAC\n   addresses and VLAN tag.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS)
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS)\n   A Virtual Private Wire Service\
    \ (VPWS) is a point-to-point circuit\n   (link) connecting two Customer Edge devices.\
    \  The link is established\n   as a logical through a packet switched network.\
    \  The CE in the\n   customer network is connected to a PE in the provider network\
    \ via an\n   Attachment Circuit (see Section 6.1); the Attachment Circuit is\n\
    \   either a physical or a logical circuit.\n   The PEs in the core network are\
    \ connected via a PW.\n   The CE devices can be routers, bridges, switches, or\
    \ hosts.  In some\n   implementations, a set of VPWSs is used to create a multi-site\
    \ L2VPN\n   network.  An example of a VPWS solution is described in\n   [PPVPN-L2VPN].\n\
    \   A VPWS differs from a VPLS (Section 3.3) in that the VPLS is point to\n  \
    \ multipoint, while the VPWS is point to point.  See [L2VPN].\n"
- title: 3.5.  IP-Only LAN-Like Service (IPLS)
  contents:
  - "3.5.  IP-Only LAN-Like Service (IPLS)\n   An IPLS is very like a VPLS (see Section\
    \ 3.3), except that\n   o  it is assumed that the CE devices (see Section 5.1)\
    \ are hosts or\n      routers, not switches,\n   o  it is assumed that the service\
    \ will only have to carry IP packets,\n      and supporting packets such as ICMP\
    \ and ARP (otherwise layer 2\n      packets that do not contain IP are not supported);\
    \ and\n   o  the assumption that only IP packets are carried by the service\n\
    \      applies equally to IPv4 and IPv6 packets.\n   While this service is a functional\
    \ subset of the VPLS service, it is\n   considered separately because it may be\
    \ possible to provide it by\n   using different mechanisms, which may allow it\
    \ to run on certain\n   hardware platforms that cannot support the full VPLS functionality\n\

- title: 3.6.  Pseudo Wire (PW)
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Pseudo Wire (PW)\n   The PWE3 working group within the IETF specifies the\
    \ pseudo wire\n   technology.  A pseudo wire is an emulated point-to-point connection\n\
    \   over a packet switched network that allows the interconnection of two\n  \
    \ nodes with any L2 technology.  The PW shares some of the building\n   blocks\
    \ and architecture constructs with the point-to-multipoint\n   solutions; e.g.,\
    \ PE (see Section 5.2) and CE (see Section 5.1).  An\n   early solution for PWs\
    \ is described in [TRANS-MPLS].  Encapsulation\n   formats readily used in VPWS,\
    \ VPLS, and PWs are described in\n   [ENCAP-MPLS].  Requirements for PWs are found\
    \ in [RFC3916], and\n   [PWE3-ARCH] presents an architectural framework for PWs.\n"

- title: 3.10.  Virtual Private Network (VPN)
  contents:
  - "3.10.  Virtual Private Network (VPN)\n   VPN is a generic term that covers the\
    \ use of public or private\n   networks to create groups of users that are separated\

    \ were on\n   a private network.  It is possible to enhance the level of separation\n\
    \   (e.g., by end-to-end encryption), but this is outside the scope of\n   IETF\
    \ VPN working group charters.  This VPN definition is from\n   [RFC2764].\n  \
    \ In the [L3VPN-FRAME], the term VPN is used to refer to a specific set\n   of\
    \ sites as either an intranet or an extranet that have been\n   configured to\
    \ allow communication.  Note that a site is a member of\n   at least one VPN and\

    \ figure above presents a taxonomy of PPVPN technologies.  Some of\n   the definitions\
    \ are given below:\n   CE-based VPN: A VPN approach in which the shared service\
    \ provider\n   network does not have any knowledge of the customer VPN.  This\n\
    \   information is limited to CE equipment.  All the VPN-specific\n   procedures\
    \ are performed in the CE devices, and the PE devices are\n   not aware in any\
    \ way that some of the traffic they are processing is\n   VPN traffic (see also\
    \ [L3VPN-FRAME]).\n   PE-Based VPNs: A Layer 3 VPN approach in which a service\
    \ provider\n   network is used to interconnect customer sites using shared\n \
    \  resources.  Specifically, the PE device maintains VPN state,\n   isolating\
    \ users of one VPN from users of another.  Because the PE\n   device maintains\
    \ all required VPN states, the CE device may behave as\n   if it were connected\
    \ to a private network.  Specifically, the CE in a\n   PE-based VPN must not require\
    \ any changes or additional functionality\n   to be connected to a PPVPN instead\
    \ of a private network.\n   The PE devices know that certain traffic is VPN traffic.\
    \  They\n   forward the traffic (through tunnels) based on the destination IP\n\
    \   address of the packet, and optionally based on other information in\n   the\
    \ IP header of the packet.  The PE devices are themselves the\n   tunnel endpoints.\
    \  The tunnels may make use of various encapsulations\n   to send traffic over\
    \ the SP network (such as, but not restricted to,\n   GRE, IP-in-IP, IPsec, or\
    \ MPLS tunnels) [L3VPN-FRAME].\n   Virtual Router (VR) style: A PE-based VPN approach\
    \ in which the PE\n   router maintains a complete logical router for each VPN\
    \ that it\n   supports.  Each logical router maintains a unique forwarding table\n\
    \   and executes a unique instance of the routing protocols.  These VPNs\n   are\
    \ described in [L3VPN-VR].\n   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs: A PE-based VPN approach in which\
    \ the PE router\n   maintains a separate forwarding environment and a separate\
    \ forwarding\n   table for each VPN.  In order to maintain multiple forwarding\
    \ table\n   instances while running only a single BGP instance, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs\n\
    \   mark route advertisements with attributes that identify their VPN\n   context.\
