  - "1.  Introduction\n   The SMTP Message Transfer Priorities extension [RFC6710]\
    \ specifies a\n   mechanism to allow messages to be given a label to indicate\n\
    \   preferential handling, to enable mail handling nodes to take this\n   into\
    \ account for onward processing.  However, as with all SMTP\n   extensions, all\
    \ SMTP Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) between the\n   source and the destination\
    \ must support the extension in order for it\n   to be successfully used.  This\
    \ document describes an application-\n   layer tunneling of message priority,\
    \ to convey the priority of the\n   messages through MTAs that do not support\
    \ the Message Transfer\n   Priorities extension.  The tunneling is done by adding\
    \ a new message\n   header field to the Internet Message Format specified in [RFC5322].\n\
    \   A number of other header fields are already in use, mostly in Message\n  \
    \ User Agents (MUAs), to convey meanings related to importance or\n   priority\
    \ of messages.  Examples of such header fields are Importance\n   [RFC2156], Priority\
    \ [RFC2156], and X-Priority (undocumented).\n   Considering sometimes subtle and\
    \ sometimes significant differences in\n   the meaning of these header fields\
    \ and widely different syntax, this\n   document defines a new header field.\n\
    \   This document is motivated by 2 main deployment scenarios: (1) an MUA\n  \
    \ talking to a non-MT-PRIORITY-aware Message Submission Agent (MSA),\n   and (2)\
    \ the use of an unextended MUA to talk to an MT-PRIORITY-aware\n   MSA.  These\
    \ 2 use cases are discussed in more detail below.\n   Use case (1) is about an\
    \ MT-PRIORITY-capable MUA talking to a\n   non-MT-PRIORITY-capable MSA [RFC6409],\
    \ which in turn is talking to an\n   MT-PRIORITY-capable MTA [RFC5321].  Both\
    \ the MSA and MTA are within\n   the same ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD)\
    \ and are on a fast\n   network; however, some recipients are accessible via the\
    \ MTA that is\n   talking over a slow link to the next MTA.  Communications over\
    \ that\n   slow link can benefit from the use of the MT-PRIORITY SMTP extension.\n\
    \   In use case (2), a widely deployed client (such as a desktop client)\n   is\
    \ talking to an MT-PRIORITY-capable MSA.  The client might be\n   extendable via\
    \ a plug-in API provided by the client developers;\n   however, existing APIs\
    \ frequently allow easy manipulation of email\n   header fields, while not allowing\
    \ for addition of SMTP protocol\n   features.  In such a case, installing a plug-in\
    \ on the client that\n   can set the MT-Priority header field could provide easier\
    \ and earlier\n   deployment of the MT-PRIORITY SMTP extension in an organization\n\
    \   without requiring changes to desktop clients.\n   We note that the above use\
    \ cases are not exhaustive and that other\n   use cases -- variations of the above\
    \ -- may exist.  The purpose of\n   this document is not to consider every scenario,\
    \ but rather examples\n   that reinforce the need to consider a tunneling mechanism\
    \ that can\n   deal with SMTP-capable devices that do not support [RFC6710].\n"

    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119] when they\n   appear in ALL CAPS.  These words also appear in this\
    \ document in\n   lower case as plain English words, absent their normative meanings.\n\
    \   The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)\n   [RFC5234]\
    \ notation, including the core rules defined in Appendix B of\n   RFC 5234 [RFC5234].\n\
    \   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client and\n   server,\
    \ respectively.  Line breaks that do not start with a new \"C:\"\n   or \"S:\"\
    \ exist for editorial reasons and are not a part of the\n   protocol.\n   This\
    \ document uses the term \"priority\" specifically in relation to\n   the internal\
    \ treatment of a message by the server.  Messages with\n   higher priorities may\
    \ be given expedited handling, and those with\n   lower priorities may be handled\
    \ only as resources become available.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document allows a message priority to be\
    \ tunneled through MTAs\n   that don't support the MT-PRIORITY SMTP extension\
    \ by specifying how\n   it can be represented in the message itself (using the\
    \ MT-Priority\n   header field).  Thus, it is important to ensure that an MTA\
    \ receiving\n   a message containing the MT-Priority header field can trust that\
    \ it\n   was set by an authorized agent.  The use of technologies such as\n  \
    \ DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) [RFC6376] or S/MIME to sign the\n   MT-Priority\
    \ header field value can enable a recipient to verify\n   whether the specified\
    \ priority value was generated by a trusted\n   agent.  In particular, DKIM signing\
    \ allows a recipient to verify that\n   the specified priority value was present\
    \ when the message was signed,\n   and to verify who signed the message.  Note,\
    \ however, that the DKIM\n   signer might not be the same agent that generated\
    \ the MT-Priority\n   header field.\n   MSAs ought to only accept message transfer\
    \ priorities (whether by\n   using the MT-PRIORITY parameter to the MAIL FROM\
    \ command or the\n   MT-Priority header field in the message itself) from users\
    \ (or only\n   certain groups of such users) who are authenticated and authorized\
    \ in\n   some way that's acceptable to the MSA.  As part of this policy, they\n\
    \   can also restrict maximum priority values that different groups of\n   users\
    \ can request and can override the priority values specified by\n   MUAs.  When\
    \ relaying to non-MT-PRIORITY-capable SMTP/LMTP (Local Mail\n   Transfer Protocol)\
    \ servers, such MSAs are required to replace any\n   MT-Priority header field\
    \ values that don't satisfy this policy.  See\n   Section 7.1 for more details\
    \ on what the consequences of such changes\n   might be.\n   Similarly, MTAs ought\
    \ to only accept message transfer priorities\n   (whether by using the MT-PRIORITY\
    \ parameter to the MAIL FROM command\n   or the MT-Priority header field in the\
    \ message itself) from senders\n   (or only certain groups of such senders) who\
    \ are authenticated and\n   authorized in some way that's acceptable to the MTA.\
    \  As part of this\n   policy, they can also restrict maximum priority values\
    \ that different\n   groups of senders can request and can override the priority\
    \ values\n   specified by them.  When relaying to non-MT-PRIORITY-capable SMTP/\n\
    \   LMTP servers, such MTAs are required to replace any MT-Priority\n   header\
    \ field values that don't satisfy this policy.  See Section 7.1\n   for more details\
    \ on what the consequences of such changes might be.\n   In the absence of the\
    \ policy enforcement mentioned above, an SMTP\n   server (whether an MSA or an\
    \ MTA) implementing the MT-PRIORITY SMTP\n   extension might be susceptible to\
    \ a denial-of-service attack.  For\n   example, malicious clients (MUAs/MSAs/MTAs)\
    \ can try to abuse this\n   feature by always requesting priority 9.\n   To protect\
    \ the MT-Priority header field from modification or\n   insertion, MUAs, MSAs,\
    \ and MTAs inserting it into messages SHOULD use\n   a message header protection\
    \ mechanism such as DKIM [RFC6376];\n   however, see Section 7.1 for more information.\n"
