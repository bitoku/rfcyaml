- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements\
    \ for\n   advancing a routing protocol to Draft Standard have been satisfied by\n\
    \   Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4).  This report documents\n   experience\
    \ with BGP.  This is the second of two reports on the BGP\n   protocol.  As required\
    \ by the Internet Architecure Board (IAB) and\n   the Internet Engineering Steering\
    \ Group (IESG), the first report will\n   present a performance analysis of the\
    \ BGP protocol.\n   The remaining sections of this memo document how BGP satisfies\n\
    \   General Requirements specified in Section 3.0, as well as\n   Requirements\
    \ for Draft Standard specified in Section 5.0 of the\n   \"Internet Routing Protocol\
    \ Standardization Criteria\" document [1].\n   This report is based on the initial\
    \ work of Peter Lothberg (Ebone),\n   Andrew Partan (Alternet), and several others.\
    \  Details of their work\n   were presented at the Twenty-fifth IETF meeting and\
    \ are available\n   from the IETF proceedings.\n   Please send comments to iwg@ans.net.\n"

- title: Documentation
  contents:
  - "Documentation\n   BGP is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol designed\
    \ for\n   TCP/IP internets.  Version 1 of the BGP protocol was published in RFC\n\
    \   1105. Since then BGP Versions 2, 3, and 4 have been developed.\n   Version\
    \ 2 was documented in RFC 1163. Version 3 is documented in RFC\n   1267.  The\
    \ changes between versions 1, 2 and 3 are explained in\n   Appendix 2 of [2].\
    \  All of the functionality that was present in the\n   previous versions is present\
    \ in version 4.\n   BGP version 2 removed from the protocol the concept of \"\
    up\", \"down\",\n   and \"horizontal\" relations between autonomous systems that\
    \ were\n   present in version 1.  BGP version 2 introduced the concept of path\n\
    \   attributes.  In addition, BGP version 2 clarified parts of the\n   protocol\
    \ that were \"under-specified\".\n   BGP version 3 lifted some of the restrictions\
    \ on the use of the\n   NEXT_HOP path attribute, and added the BGP Identifier\
    \ field to the\n   BGP OPEN message.  It also clarifies the procedure for distributing\n\
    \   BGP routes between the BGP speakers within an autonomous system.\n   BGP version\
    \ 4 redefines the (previously class-based) network layer\n   reachability portion\
    \ of the updates to specify prefixes of arbitrary\n   length in order to represent\
    \ multiple classful networks in a single\n   entry as discussed in [5].  BGP version\
    \ 4 has also modified the AS-\n   PATH attribute so that sets of autonomous systems,\
    \ as well as\n   individual ASs may be described.  In addition, BGP version for\
    \ has\n   redescribed the INTER-AS METRIC attribute as the MULTI-EXIT\n   DISCRIMINATOR\
    \ and added new LOCAL-PREFERENCE and AGGREGATOR\n   attributes.\n   Possible applications\
    \ of BGP in the Internet are documented in [3].\n   The BGP protocol was developed\
    \ by the IDR Working Group of the\n   Internet Engineering Task Force. This Working\
    \ Group has a mailing\n   list, iwg@ans.net, where discussions of protocol features\
    \ and\n   operation are held. The IDR Working Group meets regularly during the\n\
    \   quarterly Internet Engineering Task Force conferences. Reports of\n   these\
    \ meetings are published in the IETF's Proceedings.\n"
- title: MIB
  contents:
  - "MIB\n   A BGP-4 Management Information Base has been published [4].  The MIB\n\
    \   was written by Steve Willis (Wellfleet), John Burruss (Wellfleet),\n   and\
    \ John Chu (IBM).\n   Apart from a few system variables, the BGP MIB is broken\
    \ into two\n   tables: the BGP Peer Table and the BGP Received Path Attribute\
    \ Table.\n   The Peer Table reflects information about BGP peer connections, such\n\
    \   as their state and current activity. The Received Path Attribute\n   Table\
    \ contains all attributes received from all peers before local\n   routing policy\
    \ has been applied. The actual attributes used in\n   determining a route are\
    \ a subset of the received attribute table.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   BGP provides flexible and extendible mechanism for\
    \ authentication and\n   security.  The mechanism allows to support schemes with\
    \ various\n   degree of complexity.  All BGP sessions are authenticated based\
    \ on\n   the BGP Identifier of a peer.  In addition, all BGP sessions are\n  \
    \ authenticated based on the autonomous system number advertised by a\n   peer.\
    \  As part of the BGP authentication mechanism, the protocol\n   allows to carry\
    \ encrypted digital signature in every BGP message.\n   All authentication failures\
    \ result in sending the NOTIFICATION\n   messages and immediate termination of\
    \ the BGP connection.\n   Since BGP runs over TCP and IP, BGP's authentication\
    \ scheme may be\n   augmented by any authentication or security mechanism provided\
    \ by\n   either TCP or IP.\n   However, since BGP runs over TCP and IP, BGP is\
    \ vulnerable to the\n   same denial of service or authentication attacks that\
    \ are present in\n   any other TCP based protocol.\n"
- title: Implementations
  contents:
  - "Implementations\n   There are multiple independent interoperable implementations\
    \ of BGP\n   currently available.  This section gives a brief overview of the\n\
    \   implementations that are currently used in the operational Internet.\n   They\
    \ are:\n         - cisco Systems\n         - gated consortium\n         - 3COM\n\
    \         - Bay Networks (Wellfleet)\n         - Proteon\n   To facilitate efficient\
    \ BGP implementations, and avoid commonly made\n   mistakes, the implementation\
    \ experience with BGP-4 in with cisco's\n   implementation was documented as part\
    \ of RFC 1656 [4].\n   Implementors are strongly encouraged to follow the implementation\n\
    \   suggestions outlined in that document and in the appendix of [2].\n   Experience\
    \ with implementing BGP-4 showed that the protocol is\n   relatively simple to\
    \ implement. On the average BGP-4 implementation\n   takes about 2 man/months\
    \ effort, not including any restructuring that\n   may be needed to support CIDR.\n\
    \   Note that, as required by the IAB/IESG for Draft Standard status,\n   there\
    \ are multiple interoperable completely independent\n   implementations.\n"
- title: Operational experience
  contents:
  - "Operational experience\n   This section discusses operational experience with\
    \ BGP and BGP-4.\n   BGP has been used in the production environment since 1989,\
    \ BGP-4\n   since 1993.  This use involves at least two of the implementations\n\
    \   listed above.  Production use of BGP includes utilization of all\n   significant\
    \ features of the protocol.  The present production\n   environment, where BGP\
    \ is used as the inter-autonomous system routing\n   protocol, is highly heterogeneous.\
    \  In terms of the link bandwidth it\n   varies from 28 Kbits/sec to 150 Mbits/sec.\
    \  In terms of the actual\n   routes that run BGP it ranges from a relatively\
    \ slow performance\n   PC/RT to a very high performance RISC based CPUs, and includes\
    \ both\n   the special purpose routers and the general purpose workstations\n\
    \   running UNIX.\n   In terms of the actual topologies it varies from a very\
    \ sparse\n   (spanning tree of ICM) to a quite dense (NSFNET backbone).\n   At\
    \ the time of this writing BGP-4 is used as an inter-autonomous\n   system routing\
    \ protocol between ALL significant autonomous systems,\n   including, but by all\
    \ means not limited to: Alternet, ANS, Ebone,\n   ICM, IIJ, MCI, NSFNET, and Sprint.\
    \  The smallest know backbone\n   consists of one router, whereas the largest\
    \ contains nearly 90 BGP\n   speakers.  All together, there are several hundred\
    \ known BGP speaking\n   routers.\n   BGP is used both for the exchange of routing\
    \ information between a\n   transit and a stub autonomous system, and for the\
    \ exchange of routing\n   information between multiple transit autonomous systems.\
    \  There is no\n   distinction between sites historically considered backbones\
    \ vs\n   \"regional\" networks.\n   Within most transit networks, BGP is used\
    \ as the exclusive carrier of\n   the exterior routing information.  At the time\
    \ of this writing within\n   a few sites use BGP in conjunction with an interior\
    \ routing protocol\n   to carry exterior routing information.\n   The full set\
    \ of exterior routes that is carried by BGP is well over\n   20,000 aggregate\
    \ entries representing several times that number of\n   connected networks.\n\
    \   Operational experience described above involved multi-vendor\n   deployment\
    \ (cisco, and \"gated\").\n   Specific details of the operational experience with\
    \ BGP in Alternet,\n   ICM and Ebone were presented at the Twenty-fifth IETF meeting\n\
    \   (Toronto, Canada) by Peter Lothberg (Ebone), Andrew Partan (Alternet)\n  \
    \ and Paul Traina (cisco).\n   Operational experience with BGP exercised all basic\
    \ features of the\n   protocol, including authentication, routing loop suppression\
    \ and the\n   new features of BGP-4, enhanced metrics and route aggregation.\n\
    \   Bandwidth consumed by BGP has been measured at the interconnection\n   points\
    \ between CA*Net and T1 NSFNET Backbone. The results of these\n   measurements\
    \ were presented by Dennis Ferguson during the Twenty-\n   first IETF, and are\
    \ available from the IETF Proceedings. These\n   results showed clear superiority\
    \ of BGP as compared with EGP in the\n   area of bandwidth consumed by the protocol.\
    \ Observations on the\n   CA*Net by Dennis Ferguson, and on the T1 NSFNET Backbone\
    \ by Susan\n   Hares confirmed clear superiority of the BGP protocol family as\n\
    \   compared with EGP in the area of CPU requirements.\n"
- title: Migration to BGP version 4
  contents:
  - "Migration to BGP version 4\n   On multiple occasions some members of IETF expressed\
    \ concern about\n   the migration path from classful protocols to classless protocols\n\
    \   such as BGP-4.\n   BGP-4 was rushed into production use on the Internet because\
    \ of the\n   exponential growth of routing tables and the increase of memory and\n\
    \   CPU utilization required by BGP.  As such,  migration issues that\n   normally\
    \ would have stalled deployment were cast aside in favor of\n   pragmatic and\
    \ intelligent deployment of BGP-4 by network operators.\n   There was much discussion\
    \ about creating \"route exploders\" which\n   would enumerate individual class-based\
    \ networks of CIDR allocations\n   to BGP-3 speaking routers,  however a cursory\
    \ examination showed that\n   this would vastly hasten the requirement for more\
    \ CPU and memory\n   resources for these older implementations.  There would be\
    \ no way\n   internal to BGP to differentiate between known used networks and\
    \ the\n   unused portions of the CIDR allocation.\n   The migration path chosen\
    \ by the majority of the operators was known\n   as \"CIDR, default, or die!\"\
    \n   To test BGP-4 operation, a virtual \"shadow\" Internet was created by\n \
    \  linking Alternet, Ebone, ICM, and cisco over GRE based tunnels.\n   Experimentation\
    \ was done with actual live routing information by\n   establishing BGP version\
    \ 3 connections with the production networks\n   at those sites.  This allowed\
    \ extensive regression testing before\n   deploying BGP-4 on production equipment.\n\
    \   After testing on the shadow network, BGP-4 implementations were\n   deployed\
    \ on the production equipment at those sites.  BGP-4 capable\n   routers negotiated\
    \ BGP-4 connections and interoperated with other\n   sites by speaking BGP-3.\
    \  Several test aggregate routes were injected\n   into this network in addition\
    \ to class-based networks for\n   compatibility with BGP-3 speakers.\n   At this\
    \ point, the shadow-Internet was re-chartered as an\n   \"operational experience\"\
    \ network.  tunnel connections were\n   established with most major transit service\
    \ operators so that\n   operators could gain some understanding of how the introduction\
    \ of\n   aggregate networks would affect routing.\n   After being satisfied with\
    \ the initial deployment of BGP-4, a number\n   of sites chose to withdraw their\
    \ class-based advertisements and rely\n   only on their CIDR aggregate advertisements.\
    \  This provided\n   motivation for transit providers who had not migrated to\
    \ either do\n   so, accept a default route, or lose connectivity to several popular\n\
    \   destinations.\n"
- title: Metrics
  contents:
  - "Metrics\n   BGP version 4 re-defined the old INTER-AS metric as a MULTI-EXIT-\n\
    \   DISCRIMINATOR.  This value may be used in the tie breaking process\n   when\
    \ selecting a preferred path to a given address space.  The MED is\n   meant to\
    \ only be used when comparing paths received from different\n   external peers\
    \ in the same AS to indicate the preference of the\n   originating AS.\n   The\
    \ MED was purposely designed to be a \"weak\" metric that would only\n   be used\
    \ late in the best-path decision process.  The BGP working\n   group was concerned\
    \ that any metric specified by a remote operator\n   would only affect routing\
    \ in a local AS if no other preference was\n   specified.  A paramount goal of\
    \ the design of the MED was insure that\n   peers could not \"shed\" or \"absorb\"\
    \ traffic for networks that they\n   advertise.\n   The LOCAL-PREFERENCE attribute\
    \ was added so a local operator could\n   easily configure a policy that overrode\
    \ the standard best path\n   determination mechanism without configuring local\
    \ preference on each\n   router.\n   One shortcoming in the BGP4 specification\
    \ was a suggestion for a\n   default value of LOCAL-PREF to be assumed if none\
    \ was provided.\n   Defaults of 0 or the maximum value each have range limitations,\
    \ so a\n   common default would aid in the interoperation of multi-vendor\n  \
    \ routers in the same AS (since LOCAL-PREF is a local administration\n   knob,\
    \ there is no interoperability drawback across AS boundaries).\n   Another area\
    \ where more exploration is required is a method whereby\n   an originating AS\
    \ may influence the best path selection process.  For\n   example, a dual-connected\
    \ site may select one AS as a primary transit\n   service provider and have one\
    \ as a backup.\n                    /---- transit B ----\\\n        end-customer\
    \                     transit A----\n                    \\---- transit C ----/\n\
    \   In a topology where the two transit service providers connect to a\n   third\
    \ provider,  the real decision is performed by the third provider\n   and there\
    \ is no mechanism for indicating a preference should the\n   third provider wish\
    \ to respect that preference.\n   A general purpose suggestion that has been brought\
    \ up is the\n   possibility of carrying an optional vector corresponding to the\
    \ AS-\n   PATH where each transit AS may indicate a preference value for a\n \
    \  given route.  Cooperating ASs may then chose traffic based upon\n   comparison\
    \ of \"interesting\" portions of this vector according to\n   routing policy.\n\
    \   While protecting a given ASs routing policy is of paramount concern,\n   avoiding\
    \ extensive hand configuration of routing policies needs to be\n   examined more\
    \ carefully in future BGP-like protocols.\n"
- title: Internal BGP in large autonomous systems
  contents:
  - "Internal BGP in large autonomous systems\n   While not strictly a protocol issue,\
    \ one other concern has been\n   raised by network operators who need to maintain\
    \ autonomous systems\n   with a large number of peers.  Each speaker peering with\
    \ an external\n   router is responsible for propagating reachability and path\n\
    \   information to all other transit and border routers within that AS.\n   This\
    \ is typically done by establishing internal BGP connections to\n   all transit\
    \ and border routers in the local AS.\n   In a large AS, this leads to an n^2\
    \ mesh of TCP connections and some\n   method of configuring and maintaining those\
    \ connections.  BGP does\n   not specify how this information is to be propagated,\
    \  so\n   alternatives, such as injecting BGP attribute information into the\n\
    \   local IGP have been suggested.  Also, there is effort underway to\n   develop\
    \ internal BGP \"route reflectors\" or a reliable multicast\n   transport of IBGP\
    \ information which would reduce configuration,\n   memory and CPU requirements\
    \ of conveying information to all other\n   internal BGP peers.\n"
- title: Internet Dynamics
  contents:
  - "Internet Dynamics\n   As discussed in [7], the driving force in CPU and bandwidth\n\
    \   utilization is the dynamic nature of routing in the Internet.  As the\n  \
    \ net has grown, the number of changes per second has increased.  We\n   automatically\
    \ get some level of damping when more specific NLRI is\n   aggregated into larger\
    \ blocks, however this isn't sufficient.  In\n   Appendix 6 of [2] are descriptions\
    \ of dampening techniques that\n   should be applied to advertisements.  In future\
    \ specifications of\n   BGP-like protocols,  damping methods should be considered\
    \ for\n   mandatory inclusion in compliant implementations.\n"
