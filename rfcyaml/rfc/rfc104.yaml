  - "At the Network meeting at the University of Illinois, it was agreed to\nreserve\
    \ a link for use in measurements. The link chosen was the highest\nunassigned\
    \ link which was incorrectly calculated to be number 223. The\ncorrect number\
    \ is 191. Therefore, Link 191 will be assigned for\nmeasurement use. Use of this\
    \ link should be cleared with the Liasion\nOfficer at the Network Measurement\
    \ Center (NMC).\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry\
    \ ]\n        [ into the online RFC archives by Thomas Nielsen 4/97 ]\n"
