  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 provides
    a framework\n   for passing configuration information to hosts.  Its usefulness\n
    \  extends to hosts and devices using the iSCSI and iFCP protocols to\n   connect
    to block level storage assets over a TCP/IP network.\n   The iSNS Protocol provides
    a framework for automated discovery,\n   management, and configuration of iSCSI
    and iFCP devices on a TCP/IP\n   network.  It provides functionality similar to
    that found on Fibre\n   Channel networks, except that iSNS works within the context
    of an IP\n   network.  iSNS thereby provides the requisite storage intelligence
    to\n   IP networks that are standard on existing Fibre Channel networks.\n   Existing
    DHCP options cannot be used to find iSNS servers for the\n   following reasons:\n
    \  a) iSNS functionality is distinctly different from other protocols\n      using
    DHCP options.  Specifically, iSNS provides a significant\n      superset of capabilities
    compared to typical name resolution\n      protocols such as DNS.  It is designed
    to support client devices\n      that allow themselves to be configured and managed
    from a central\n      iSNS server.\n   b) iSNS requires a DHCP option format that
    provides more than the\n      location of the iSNS server.  The DHCP option has
    to specify the\n      subset of iSNS services that may be actively used by the
    iSNS\n      client.\n   The DHCP option number for iSNS is used by iSCSI and iFCP
    devices to\n   discover the location and role of the iSNS server.  The DHCP option\n
    \  number assigned for iSNS by IANA is 83.\n"

    - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   iSNS refers to the Internet Storage
      Name Service framework, which\n   consists of the storage network model and
      associated services.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
      \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
      and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in
      [RFC2119].\n   All frame formats are in big-endian network byte order.  RESERVED\n
      \  fields SHOULD be set to zero.\n   This document uses the following terms:\n
      \     \"iSNS Client\" - iSNS clients are processes resident in iSCSI and\n      iFCP
      devices that initiate transactions with the iSNS server using\n      the iSNS
      Protocol.\n      \"iSNS Server\" - The iSNS server responds to iSNS protocol
      query\n      and registration messages and initiates asynchronous notification\n
      \     messages.  The iSNS server stores information registered by iSNS\n      clients.\n
      \     \"iSCSI (Internet SCSI)\" - iSCSI is an encapsulation of SCSI for a\n
      \     new generation of storage devices interconnected with TCP/IP.\n      \"iFCP
      (Internet Fibre Channel Protocol)\" - iFCP is a gateway-to-\n      gateway protocol
      designed to interconnect existing Fibre Channel\n      devices using TCP/IP.
      \ iFCP maps the Fibre Channel transport and\n      fabric services to TCP/IP.\n"

  title: 2.  iSNS Option for DHCP
- contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   For protecting the iSNS option, the DHCP Authentication
    security\n   option as specified in [RFC3118] may present a problem due to the\n
    \  limited implementation and deployment of the DHCP authentication\n   option.
    \ The IPsec security mechanisms for iSNS itself are specified\n   in [iSNS] to
    provide confidentiality when sensitive information is\n   distributed via iSNS.
    \ See the Security Considerations section of\n   [iSNS] for details and specific
    requirements for implementation of\n   IPsec.\n   In addition, [iSNS] describes
    an authentication block that provides\n   message integrity for multicast or broadcast
    iSNS messages (i.e., for\n   heartbeat/discovery messages only).  See [RFC3723]
    for further\n   discussion of security for these protocols.\n   If no sensitive
    information, as described in [iSNS], is being\n   distributed via iSNS, and an
    Entity is discovered via iSNS,\n   authentication and authorization are handled
    by the IP Storage\n   protocols whose endpoints are discovered via iSNS; specifically,
    iFCP\n   [iFCP] and iSCSI [RFC3720].  It is the responsibility of the\n   providers
    of these services to ensure that an inappropriately\n   advertised or discovered
    service does not compromise their security.\n   When no DHCP security is used,
    there is a risk of distribution of\n   false discovery information (e.g., via
    the iSNS DHCP option\n   identifying a false iSNS server that distributes the
    false discovery\n   information).  The primary countermeasure for this risk is\n
    \  authentication by the IP storage protocols discovered through iSNS.\n   When
    this risk is a significant concern, IPsec SAs SHOULD be used (as\n   specified
    in RFC 3723).  For example, if an attacker uses DHCP and\n   iSNS to distribute
    discovery information that falsely identifies an\n   iSCSI endpoint, that endpoint
    will lack the credentials necessary to\n   complete IKE authentication successfully,
    and therefore will be\n   prevented from falsely sending or receiving iSCSI traffic.
    \ When this\n   risk of false discovery information is a significant concern and\n
    \  IPsec is implemented for iSNS, IPsec SAs SHOULD also be used for iSNS\n   traffic
    to prevent use of a false iSNS server; this is more robust\n   than relying only
    on the IP Storage protocols to detect false\n   discovery information.\n   When
    IPsec is implemented for iSNS, there is a risk of a denial-of-\n   service attack
    based on repeated use of false discovery information\n   that will cause initiation
    of IKE negotiation.  The countermeasures\n   for this are administrative configuration
    of each iSNS Entity to\n   limit the peers it is willing to communicate with (i.e.,
    by IP\n   address range and/or DNS domain), and maintenance of a negative\n   authentication
    cache to avoid repeatedly contacting an iSNS Entity\n   that fails to authenticate.
    \ These three measures (i.e., IP address\n   range limits, DNS domain limits,
    negative authentication cache) MUST\n   be implemented for iSNS entities when
    this DHCP option is used.  An\n   analogous argument applies to the IP storage
    protocols that can be\n   discovered via iSNS as discussed in RFC 3723.\n   In
    addition, use of the techniques described in [RFC2827] and\n   [RFC3833] may also
    be relevant to reduce denial-of-service attacks.\n"
