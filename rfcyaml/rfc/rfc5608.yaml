    - "1.4.  RADIUS Operational Model\n   The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] provides authentication
      and\n   authorization services for network access devices, usually referred\n
      \  to as a Network Access Server (NAS).  The RADIUS protocol operates,\n   at
      the most simple level, as a request-response mechanism.  RADIUS\n   clients,
      within the NAS, initiate a transaction by sending a RADIUS\n   Access-Request
      message to a RADIUS server, with which the client\n   shares credentials.  The
      RADIUS server will respond with either an\n   Access-Accept message or an Access-Reject
      message.\n   RADIUS supports authentication methods compatible with plaintext\n
      \  username and password mechanisms, MD5 Challenge/Response mechanisms,\n   Extensible
      Authentication Protocol (EAP) mechanisms, and HTTP Digest\n   mechanisms.  Upon
      presentation of identity and credentials, the user\n   is either accepted or
      rejected.  RADIUS servers indicate a successful\n   authentication by returning
      an Access-Accept message.  An Access-\n   Reject message indicates unsuccessful
      authentication.\n   Access-Accept messages are populated with one or more service\n
      \  provisioning attributes, which control the type and extent of service\n   provided
      to the user at the NAS.  The authorization portion may be\n   thought of as
      service provisioning.  Based on the configuration of\n   the user's account
      on the RADIUS server, upon authentication, the NAS\n   is provided with instructions
      as to what type of service to provide\n   to the user.  When that service provisioning
      does not match the\n   capabilities of the NAS, or of the particular interface
      to the NAS\n   over which the user is requesting access, RFC 2865 [RFC2865]
      requires\n   that the NAS MUST reject the access request.  RFC 2865 describes\n
      \  service provisioning attributes for management access to a NAS, as\n   well
      as various terminal emulation and packet forwarding services on\n   the NAS.
      \ This memo describes specific RADIUS service provisioning\n   attributes that
      are useful with secure transports and SNMP Transport\n   Models.\n   RADIUS
      servers are often deployed on an enterprise-wide or\n   organization-wide basis,
      covering a variety of disparate use cases.\n   In such deployments, all NASes
      and all users are serviced by a common\n   pool of RADIUS servers.  In many
      deployments, the RADIUS server will\n   handle requests from many different
      types of NASes with different\n   capabilities, and different types of interfaces,
      services, and\n   protocol support.\n   In order for a RADIUS server to make
      the correct authorization\n   decision in all cases, the server will often need
      to know something\n   about the type of NAS at which the user is requesting
      access, the\n   type of service that the user is requesting, and the role of
      the user\n   in the organization.  For example, many users may be authorized
      to\n   receive network access via a Remote Access Server (RAS), Virtual\n   Private
      Network (VPN) server, or LAN access switch.  Typically only a\n   small sub-set
      of all users are authorized to access the\n   administrative interfaces of network
      infrastructure devices, e.g.,\n   the Command Line Interface (CLI) or SNMP engine
      of switches and\n   routers.\n   In order for the RADIUS server to have information
      regarding the type\n   of access being requested, it is common for the NAS (i.e.,
      the RADIUS\n   client) to include \"hint\" attributes in the RADIUS Access-Request\n
      \  message, describing the NAS and the type of service being requested.\n   This
      document recommends appropriate \"hint\" attributes for the SNMP\n   service
      type.\n"

    - "1.5.  RADIUS Usage with Secure Transports\n   Some secure transport protocols
      that can be used with SNMP Transport\n   Models have defined authentication
      protocols supporting several\n   authentication methods.  For example, the Secure
      Shell (SSH)\n   Authentication protocol [RFC4252] supports multiple methods\n
      \  (including public key, password, and host-based) to authenticate SSH\n   clients.\n
      \  SSH Server integration with RADIUS traditionally uses the username\n   and
      password mechanism.\n   Secure transport protocols do not, however, specify
      how the transport\n   interfaces to authentication clients, leaving such as
      implementation\n   specific.  For example, the \"password\" method of SSH authentication\n
      \  primarily describes how passwords are acquired from the SSH client\n   and
      transported to the SSH server, the interpretation of the password\n   and validation
      against password databases is left to SSH server\n   implementations.  SSH server
      implementations often use the Pluggable\n   Authentication Modules [PAM] interface
      provided by operating systems\n   such as Linux and Solaris to integrate with
      password-based network\n   authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS, TACACS+
      (Terminal Access\n   Controller Access-Control System Plus), Kerberos, etc.\n
      \  Secure transports do not typically specify how to utilize\n   authorization
      information obtained from a AAA service, such as\n   RADIUS.  More often, user
      authentication is sufficient to cause the\n   secure transport server to begin
      delivering service to the user.\n   Access control in these situations is supplied
      by the application to\n   which the secure transport server session is attached.
      \ For example,\n   if the application is a Linux shell, the user's access rights
      are\n   controlled by that user account's group membership and the file\n   system
      access protections.  This behavior does not closely follow the\n   traditional
      service provisioning model of AAA systems, such as\n   RADIUS.\n"

    - "1.6.  Domain of Applicability\n   Most of the RADIUS Attributes referenced
      in this document have broad\n   applicability for provisioning remote management
      access to NAS\n   devices using SNMP.  However, the selection of secure transport\n
      \  protocols has special considerations.  This document does not specify\n   details
      of the integration of secure transport protocols with a\n   RADIUS client in
      the NAS implementation.  However, there are\n   functional requirements for
      correct application of framed management\n   protocols and secure transport
      protocols that will limit the\n   selection of such protocols that can be considered
      for use with\n   RADIUS.  Since the RADIUS user credentials are obtained by
      the RADIUS\n   client from the secure transport protocol server, or in some
      cases\n   directly from the SNMP engine, the secure transport protocol, and
      its\n   implementation in the NAS, MUST support forms of credentials that are\n
      \  compatible with the authentication methods supported by RADIUS.\n   RADIUS
      currently supports the following user authentication methods,\n   although others
      may be added in the future:\n   o  Password - RFC 2865\n   o  CHAP (Challenge
      Handshake Authentication Protocol) - RFC 2865\n   o  ARAP (Apple Remote Access
      Protocol) - RFC 2869\n   o  EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) - RFC 2869,
      RFC 3579\n   o  HTTP Digest - RFC 5090\n   The secure transport protocols selected
      for use with RADIUS and SNMP\n   obviously need to support user authentication
      methods that are\n   compatible with those that exist in RADIUS.  The RADIUS\n
      \  authentication methods most likely usable with these protocols are\n   Password,
      CHAP, and possibly HTTP Digest, with Password being the\n   distinct common
      denominator.  There are many secure transports that\n   support other, more
      robust, authentication mechanisms, such as public\n   key.  RADIUS has no support
      for public key authentication, except\n   within the context of an EAP Method.
      \ The applicability statement for\n   EAP indicates that it is not intended
      for use as an application-layer\n   authentication mechanism, so its use with
      the mechanisms described in\n   this document is NOT RECOMMENDED.  In some cases,
      Password may be the\n   only compatible RADIUS authentication method available.\n"

      defines a mechanism for\n   providing transport layer security (TLS) for SNMP,
      allowing protocols\n   such as SSH and TLS to be used to secure SNMP communication.
      \ The\n   Transport Subsystem allows the modular definition of Transport Models\n
      \  for multiple secure transport protocols.  Transport Models rely upon\n   the
      underlying secure transport for user authentication services.\n   The Transport
      Model (TM) then maps the authenticated identity to a\n   model-independent principal,
      which it stores in the tmStateReference.\n   When the selected security model
      is the Transport Security Model\n   (TSM), the expected behavior is for the
      securityName to be set by the\n   TSM from the authenticated principal information
      stored in the\n   tmStateReference by the TM.\n   The Secure Shell protocol

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  RADIUS Usage for SNMP Transport Models\n   There are two use cases for RADIUS
    support of management access via\n   SNMP.  These are (a) service authorization
    and (b) access control\n   authorization.  RADIUS almost always involves user
    authentication as\n   prerequisite to authorization, and there is a user authentication\n
    \  phase for each of these two use cases.  The first use case is\n   discussed
    in detail in this memo, while the second use case is a\n   topic of current research,
    and beyond the scope of this document.\n   This document describes the way in
    which RADIUS attributes and\n   messages are applied to the specific application
    area of SNMP\n   Transport Models.  User authentication and service authorization
    via\n   RADIUS are undertaken by the secure transport module, that underlies\n
    \  the SNMP Transport Model.\n   User authentication for SNMP Transport Models
    has the same syntax and\n   semantics as user authentication for any other network
    service.  In\n   the context of SNMP, the \"user\" is thought of as a \"principal\"
    and\n   may represent a host, an application, or a human.\n   Service authorization
    allows a RADIUS server to authorize an\n   authenticated principal to use SNMP,
    optionally over a secure\n   transport, typically using an SNMP Transport Model.
    \ This memo\n   describes mechanisms by which such information can be requested
    from\n   a RADIUS server and enforced within the NAS.  An SNMP architecture,\n
    \  [RFC3411], does not make a distinction between user authentication\n   and
    service authorization.  In the case of existing, deployed\n   security models,
    such as the User-based Security Model (USM), this\n   distinction is not significant.
    \ For SNMP Transport Models, this\n   distinction is relevant and important.\n
    \  It is relevant because of the way in which SSH implementations have\n   traditionally
    integrated with RADIUS clients.  Those SSH\n   implementations traditionally seek
    to obtain user authentication\n   (e.g., validation of a username and password)
    from an outside\n   authentication service, often via a PAM-style interface.  The
    service\n   authorization in traditional SSH server implementations comes via
    the\n   restrictions that the operating system (OS) shell (and file system,\n
    \  etc.) place on the user by means of access controls tied to the\n   username
    or the username's membership in various user groups.  These\n   OS-style access
    controls are distinct from the service provisioning\n   features of RADIUS.  If
    we wish to use existing SSH server\n   implementations, or slightly adapt them,
    for use with SNMP Transport\n   Models, and we wish to support RADIUS-provisioned
    service\n   authorization, we need to be aware that the RADIUS service\n   authorization
    information will need to be obtained by the relevant\n   SNMP models from the
    SSH module.\n   One reason that RADIUS-provisioned service authorization is important\n
    \  is that in many deployments, the RADIUS server's back-end\n   authentication
    database contains credentials for many classes of\n   users, only a small portion
    of which may be authorized to access the\n   management interfaces of managed
    entities (NASes) via SNMP.  This is\n   in contrast to the way USM for SNMP works,
    in which all principals\n   entered to the local configuration data-store are
    authorized for\n   access to the managed entity.  In the absence of RADIUS-provisioned\n
    \  service authorization, network management access may be granted to\n   unauthorized,
    but properly authenticated, users.  With SNMPv3, an\n   appropriately configured
    Access Control Model would serve to\n   alleviate the risk of unauthorized access.\n"

      rely on implementation specific integration of the\n   transport protocols with

      of RADIUS clients with transport\n   protocols utilize appropriate \"hint\"
      attributes in RADIUS Access-\n   Request messages, to signal to the RADIUS server
      the type of service\n   being requested over the transport session.  Specific
      attributes for\n   use with SNMP Transport Models are recommended in this document.\n

      that attempt to provision\n   unsupported services as if they were an Access-Reject.
      \ NASes SHOULD\n   treat unknown attributes as if they were provisioning unsupported\n

      with a value of No-Protection.\n   There are no combinations of RADIUS attributes
      that denote the\n   equivalent of SNMP noAuthNoPriv access, as RADIUS always
      involves the\n   authentication of a user (i.e., a principal) as a prerequisite
      for\n   authorization.  RADIUS can be used to provide an \"Authorize-Only\"\n
      \  service, but only when the request contains a \"cookie\" from a\n   previous
      successful authentication with the same RADIUS server (i.e.,\n   the RADIUS
      State Attribute).\n   The following RADIUS attributes are used to limit the
      extent of a\n   secure transport session carrying SNMP traffic, in conjunction
      with\n   an SNMP Transport Model:\n   1.  Session-Timeout\n   2.  Inactivity-Timeout.\n
      \  Refer to [RFC2865] for a detailed description of these attributes.\n   The
      Session-Timeout Attribute indicates the maximum number of seconds\n   that a
      session may exist before it is unconditionally disconnected.\n   The Inactivity-Timeout
      Attribute indicates the maximum number of\n   seconds that a transport session
      may exist without any protocol\n   activity (messages sent or received) before
      the session is\n   disconnected.  These timeouts are enforced by the NAS.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This specification describes the use of RADIUS
    for purposes of\n   authentication and authorization.  Threats and security issues
    for\n   this application are described in [RFC3579] and [RFC3580]; security\n
    \  issues encountered in roaming are described in [RFC2607].\n   Additional security
    considerations for use of SNMP with secure\n   Transport Models [RFC5590] and
    the Transport Security Model [RFC5591]\n   are found in the \"Security Considerations\"
    sections of the respective\n   documents.\n   If the SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c Security
    Model is used, then securityName\n   comes from the community name, as per RFC
    3584.  If the User-based\n   Security Model is selected, then securityName is
    determined using\n   USM.  This may not be what is expected when using an SNMP
    secure\n   Transport Model with an external authentication service, such as\n
    \  RADIUS.\n   Simultaneously using a secure transport with RADIUS authentication\n
    \  and authorization, and the SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c or USM security models\n   is
    NOT RECOMMENDED.  See the \"Coexistence, Security Parameters, and\n   Access Control\"
    section of [RFC5590].\n   There are good reasons to provision USM access to supplement
    AAA-\n   based access, however.  When the network is under duress, or the AAA-\n
    \  service is unreachable, for any reason, it is important to have\n   access
    credentials stored in the local configuration data-store of\n   the managed entity.
    \ USM credentials are a likely way to fulfill this\n   requirement.  This is analogous
    to configuring a local \"root\"\n   password in the \"/etc/passwd\" file of a
    UNIX workstation, to be used\n   as a backup means of login, for times when the
    Network Information\n   Service (NIS) authentication service is unreachable.\n
    \  The Message-Authenticator (80) Attribute [RFC3579] SHOULD be used\n   with
    RADIUS messages that are described in this memo.  This is useful\n   because the
    Message-Authenticator Attribute is the best available\n   mechanism in RADIUS
    as it stands today to provide tamper-evident\n   integrity protection of the service
    provisioning attributes in an\n   Access-Accept packet.  It is slightly less important
    for Access-\n   Request packets, although it may be desirable to protect any \"hint\"\n
    \  attributes contained in those messages.  This protection mitigates\n   the
    fact that RADIUS messages are not encrypted and that attributes\n   could be added,
    deleted or modified by an adversary in a position to\n   intercept the packet.\n"
