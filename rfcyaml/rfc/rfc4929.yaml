- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MPLS and GMPLS technology is developed in two main tracks\
    \ in the\n   IETF.  \"MPLS\" refers to the work done for packet switched networks,\n\
    \   while \"GMPLS\" refers to the efforts to apply the MPLS protocols to\n   all\
    \ types of networks including packet and non-packet technologies.\n   Though GMPLS\
    \ by definition is a superset of MPLS, the term \"(G)MPLS\"\n   is used in this\
    \ document to indicate both of these tracks.  A\n   terminology section that covers\
    \ the use of terms and concepts used in\n   this document is found in Section\
    \ 2.6.\n   [RFC4775] discusses procedural issues related to the extension or\n\
    \   variation of IETF protocols by other SDOs.  It provides the\n   guidelines\
    \ and procedures to be used by other SDOs when considering\n   the requirements\
    \ for extensions to IETF protocols.  [RFC4775]\n   recommends that major extensions\
    \ to, or variations of, IETF protocols\n   only take place through normal IETF\
    \ processes or in coordination with\n   the IETF.\n   The (G)MPLS protocol families\
    \ were developed within the IETF and\n   constitute significant protocol suites\
    \ within the Internet standards.\n   The (G)MPLS suites of protocols have become\
    \ popular for a number of\n   new applications and deployment scenarios.  There\
    \ have been concerns\n   with regards to other technology fora developing, using,\
    \ and\n   publishing non-standard protocol extensions as a standard not only\n\
    \   for use within their community, also for wider use by the industry.\n   Especially\
    \ concerning is the development of extensions, without\n   consulting the (G)MPLS\
    \ working groups, which are in conflict with\n   efforts on-going in the (G)MPLS\
    \ working groups, and then presented to\n   the (G)MPLS working group as 'fait\
    \ accompli'.\n   The definition and publishing of non-standard extensions by other\n\
    \   fora, without IETF review, and outside of the IETF publication\n   process,\
    \ regardless if rationalized as limited to use among fora\n   vendors, or limited\
    \ to a particular application, or rationalized as\n   allowing timely demos, has\
    \ the unfortunate potential to hinder\n   interoperability and increase complexity\
    \ of the protocol, sows\n   confusion in the industry, and circumvents the Internet\
    \ standards\n   process that exists to ensure protocol implementability.  As\n\
    \   described in [RFC4775], non-standard extensions, including\n   experimental\
    \ values, are not to be portrayed as industrial standards\n   whether by an individual\
    \ vendor, an industry forum, or a standards\n   body.\n   This document clarifies\
    \ the IETF's MPLS and Common Control and\n   Measurement Plane (CCAMP) working\
    \ groups' roles and responsibilities\n   for the (G)MPLS protocols and documents\
    \ the requisite use of, and how\n   to apply, the [RFC4775] procedure of using\
    \ the IETF review processes,\n   [RFC2026] and [RFC2418], for fora wishing to\
    \ apply or extend the\n   (G)MPLS protocols.  Use of the IETF review processes\
    \ will ensure an\n   open process for protocol development and ensure a non-harmful\n\
    \   evolution for these IETF protocols, which will benefit the larger\n   industry\
    \ users' community.  IETF itself cannot enforce a forum to use\n   the (G)MPLS\
    \ change procedure, though any forum not following it, when\n   applying for IANA\
    \ assignment or IETF publication, will be delayed\n   until this procedure has\
    \ been completed.\n   This document does not change the formal IETF standards\
    \ process as\n   defined in [RFC2026] and [RFC2418].  It is consistent with the\n\
    \   general procedures for protocol extensions defined in [RFC4775] and\n   shows\
    \ how they are applied in the case of (G)MPLS.  Any procedures\n   described in\
    \ this document are to be implemented in a way consistent\n   with these three\
    \ documents.  They MUST be used when other SDOs and\n   fora wish to propose (G)MPLS\
    \ changes.  They SHOULD be used internally\n   within the IETF unless the changes\
    \ concerned are considered non-\n   controversial by the responsible Area Director(s)\
    \ (e.g., covered by\n   the working group charter), in which case other aspects\
    \ of the normal\n   IETF standards process cover the necessary procedures.\n"

- title: 2.1.1.  Multiprotocol Label Switching Working Group
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Multiprotocol Label Switching Working Group\n   The Multiprotocol Label\
    \ Switching (MPLS) working group is responsible\n   for standardizing the base\
    \ technology that uses label switching, and\n   for describing the implementation\
    \ of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) over\n   various packet and frame-based link\
    \ level technologies.  The working\n   group charter includes procedures and protocols\
    \ for the distribution\n   of labels between routers, as well as encapsulations,\
    \ operation and\n   management, traffic engineering, and multicast considerations.\n\
    \   This document assumes that the MPLS working group remains the\n   chartered\
    \ authority on MPLS technologies, but notes that the IETF may\n   appoint another\
    \ working group (refer to [RFC2418]) to handle specific\n   extensions or changes\
    \ to the protocols.  Further, in the event that\n   the MPLS working group completes\
    \ its work and is closed, the IETF\n   will use the non-working group standards\
    \ track document process\n   (described in [RFC2026]) using designated experts\
    \ from the community\n   [RFC2434] for the MPLS protocols.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Common Control & Measurement Plane Working Group
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Common Control & Measurement Plane Working Group\n   The IETF Common\
    \ Control and Measurement Plane (CCAMP) working group\n   coordinates the work\
    \ within the IETF defining common control and\n   measurement planes for ISP and\
    \ SP core tunneling technologies.  This\n   includes, but is not limited to, defining\
    \ signaling protocols and\n   measurement protocols such that they support multiple\
    \ physical path\n   and tunnel technologies using input from technology-specific\
    \ working\n   groups such as the MPLS working group.  It also includes the\n \
    \  development of protocol-independent metrics and parameters for\n   describing\
    \ links and paths that can be carried in protocols.\n   The technology that the\
    \ CCAMP working group focuses on is called\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS), indicating\
    \ that CCAMP addresses a\n   generalized technology, where labels are defined\
    \ in such a way that\n   they will be compatible with the technology over which\
    \ the data is\n   transported.  While the MPLS working group focuses on packet-\
    \ and\n   frame-switched technologies, the CCAMP working group work focuses on\n\
    \   common methods across a broad spectrum of switching technologies\n   including\
    \ packet and frame technologies.  In this respect, GMPLS can\n   be viewed as\
    \ a superset of MPLS.\n   The procedures in this document assume that the CCAMP\
    \ working group\n   remains the authority on GMPLS technologies, but acknowledges\
    \ that\n   the IETF may appoint another working group (refer to [RFC2418]) to\n\
    \   handle specific extensions or changes to the protocols.  Further, in\n   the\
    \ event that the CCAMP working group completes its work and is\n   closed, the\
    \ IETF will use the non-working group standards track\n   document process (described\
    \ in [RFC2026]) using designated experts\n   from the community [RFC2434] for\
    \ the GMPLS protocols.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  MPLS and CCAMP Division of Work
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  MPLS and CCAMP Division of Work\n   From time to time, the MPLS and CCAMP\
    \ working groups decide to divide\n   work between themselves in a way that does\
    \ not strictly follow the\n   split between the working groups as defined in the\
    \ working group\n   charters.  This is the case, e.g., for P2MP TE LSPs, where\
    \ the MPLS\n   working group is specifying requirements and base technology for\
    \ all\n   of the (G)MPLS technologies.\n   An entity or individual that wishes\
    \ to propose extensions or changes\n   to (G)MPLS should first decide to which\
    \ working group (MPLS or CCAMP)\n   it will bring the proposal.  However, the\
    \ MPLS and CCAMP working\n   group chairs, in conjunction with their Area Directors,\
    \ may redirect\n   the proposal to another working group.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Other (G)MPLS Technology-Related Working Groups
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Other (G)MPLS Technology-Related Working Groups\n   Problem statements\
    \ and requirements for (G)MPLS technology have been\n   produced by several working\
    \ groups in addition to the MPLS and CCAMP\n   working groups.  IETF working groups\
    \ are defined for the management\n   of specific tasks by their charter.  Their\
    \ charter defines their\n   role, relationship with other working groups, and\
    \ the applicable\n   procedures to follow when extensions to (G)MPLS may be needed.\
    \  This\n   section provides an overview of the (G)MPLS-related groups and their\n\
    \   responsibilities.  Additional information describing the working\n   groups\
    \ and their charters is available on the IETF web pages.\n   The IP over Optical\
    \ (IPO) working group and the Internet Traffic\n   Engineering working group (TEWG)\
    \ are examples of working groups which\n   focus on problem statements and requirements\
    \ for (G)MPLS to be\n   considered by the (G)MPLS working groups.  These working\
    \ groups have\n   not specified any protocols.\n   The Bidirectional Forwarding\
    \ Detection (BFD) working group, also may\n   use the (G)MPLS protocols and mechanisms.\
    \  The BFD working group is\n   chartered for requirements evaluation and protocol\
    \ specification\n   related to BFD.  If the working group needs to extend or change\
    \ the\n   (G)MPLS protocols, the procedures specified by its charter and the\n\
    \   IETF's standard processes are applicable.\n   The Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) and\
    \ Layer 3 VPN (L3VPN) working groups have\n   been chartered to specify a limited\
    \ number of solutions for Provider\n   Provisioned VPNs.  Both working groups\
    \ are in the Internet Area.\n   Much of the work of the L2VPN and L3VPN working\
    \ groups does not\n   include specifying new protocols or extensions to existing\
    \ protocols.\n   Where extensions are needed, the procedures as specified by their\n\
    \   charters and the IETF's standard processes are applicable.\n   The Layer 1\
    \ VPN (L1VPN) working group is chartered to specify\n   mechanisms necessary for\
    \ providing Layer 1 VPN services\n   (establishment of layer 1 connections between\
    \ CE devices) over a\n   GMPLS-enabled transport service-provider network.  Protocol\n\
    \   extensions required for L1VPN will be done in cooperation with MPLS,\n   CCAMP,\
    \ OSPF, IS-IS, IDR, L3VPN, and other WGs where necessary.  That\n   is, the L1VPN\
    \ working group will not develop GMPLS protocol\n   extensions in isolation, but\
    \ will develop requirements and propose\n   extensions that will be reviewed and\
    \ approved by the (G)MPLS working\n   groups.\n   The Pseudo Wire Emulation End\
    \ to End (PWE3) working group is a\n   working group that may use the (G)MPLS\
    \ protocols in its\n   specifications.  Should the PWE3 specifications require\
    \ extension or\n   changes to the (G)MPLS protocols, the procedures as specified\

- title: 3.  Overview of (G)MPLS Change Process
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview of (G)MPLS Change Process\n   This is a non-normative section, as\
    \ it is intended to provide a high-\n   level view of [RFC4775] procedures for\
    \ protocol extensions.\n   Application of these procedures for (G)MPLS are defined\
    \ in detail in\n   Section 4.\n   Whenever there is reason to believe that a particular\
    \ problem may be\n   solved by use of or extensions to the (G)MPLS protocols,\
    \ a\n   communication using the formal liaison process, or, for a forum\n   without\
    \ a formal relationship, an informal communication, may be used\n   to discuss\
    \ the problem with the IETF ([RFC4052] and [RFC4053]).\n   Collaboration with\
    \ the IETF in the early discussion phase will\n   facilitate a timely understanding\
    \ of whether the problem has already\n   been solved, may be outside the scope\
    \ of the (G)MPLS protocols, or\n   may require more investigation.\n   Whenever\
    \ any extension or change to the (G)MPLS protocols is desired,\n   a problem statement\
    \ and/or requirements statement must be produced\n   and must be submitted to\
    \ IETF as an Internet-Draft.  When the\n   requirements come from an external\
    \ organization, informal\n   communications, such as e-mail to working group mailing\
    \ lists, is\n   strongly encouraged as it facilitates timely and cooperative work.\n\
    \   However, if desired, the Internet-Draft, containing the\n   requirement(s),\
    \ may be submitted to the working group using a formal\n   liaison statement.\
    \  IETF's response to the request will be given as a\n   reply to the liaison.\
    \  This use of formal communication reduces the\n   risk of confusing an individual\
    \ participant's opinion for that of the\n   group as can happen on mailing lists,\
    \ though it does introduce a more\n   lengthy communication cycle.  If there is\
    \ no formal liaison\n   relationship, a communication may be sent directly to\
    \ the (G)MPLS\n   working group, a relevant Area Director, or the IESG.\n   The\
    \ IETF, through the appropriate Area Director, and the chairs of\n   the MPLS\
    \ and CCAMP working groups for (G)MPLS related work, will\n   direct the requirements\
    \ draft to an appropriate working group for\n   assessment and comment.  This\
    \ process may require communication and\n   discussion for clarification, but\
    \ the IETF undertakes to perform the\n   assessment in a timely manner.\n   In\
    \ assessing the requirements statement I-D, the IETF may determine:\n   - that\
    \ the requirements can be satisfied without modifications to the\n     (G)MPLS\
    \ protocols\n   - that the requirements are not sufficiently general or there\
    \ is not\n     sufficient interest to do a standards-track solution to warrant\
    \ a\n     Standards-track change to the (G)MPLS protocols\n   - that the requirements\
    \ justify a standards-track change to the\n     (G)MPLS protocols\n   - that the\
    \ requirements might not be possible to satisfy without\n     violating the (G)MPLS\
    \ architecture in a way that would harm the\n     (G)MPLS technology\n   - that\
    \ the requirements should be combined with other requirements to\n     solve a\
    \ more general problem or solve the same problem in a more\n     flexible way.\n\
    \   In the event that the IETF agrees to develop a solution, the IETF\n   will\
    \ set milestones that would result in timely delivery of the\n   solution in a\
    \ timely manner.  If the IETF rejects the requirements,\n   this will only be\
    \ done with clear explanation and full discussion\n   with the source of the requirements.\n\
    \   The solutions that are developed within the IETF may be sourced from\n   external\
    \ organizations and presented for review, discussion,\n   modification, and adoption\
    \ as Internet-Drafts.  Such solutions drafts\n   may be presented to the IETF\
    \ in advance of the completion of the\n   requirements work, but all solutions\
    \ will be processed through the\n   normal IETF process with other proposed solutions.\
    \  Solution drafts\n   are adopted as an IETF working group draft when the requirements\
    \ are\n   stable, and not before the protocol-responsible working group has a\n\
    \   charter item to cover the solutions work.  It is strongly recommended\n  \
    \ for interested parties to start informal discussion in the IETF, as\n   early\
    \ as possible, and to co-author in the IETF's work.  It is not\n   recommended\
    \ for the source forum to continue to work on solutions in\n   parallel with on-going\
    \ work in the IETF.  If the protocol-responsible\n   working group is unable to\
    \ accept the work (e.g., due to current work\n   load), the IETF processes ([RFC2418])\
    \ provide alternate options for\n   ensuring the work is completed.\n"

- title: 4.2.1.  Preliminary Investigation
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Preliminary Investigation\n   This step is OPTIONAL, and is intended\
    \ to provide a lightweight way\n   to \"feel out\" the IETF's position on a proposal\
    \ without going to the\n   effort of writing an Internet-Draft.  The intention\
    \ is to determine\n   whether the problem has been examined already, whether the\
    \ problem is\n   in scope for the IETF, and whether solutions are already known.\n\
    \   Although the preliminary investigation phase is optional it is\n   RECOMMENDED\
    \ that the originator of any requirements consult and\n   discuss the issues concerned\
    \ as early as possible to avoid any wasted\n   effort, and the preliminary investigation\
    \ phase provides a mechanism\n   to do this.\n   Useful discussions may be held\
    \ at this stage in order to ensure that\n   the problem statement and requirements\
    \ statement Internet-Drafts\n   contain the right material.  This step is described\
    \ as lightweight\n   because no Internet-Draft is required and because the step\
    \ largely\n   involves offline discussions.  However, it may be the case that\
    \ this\n   step involves considerable technical discussions and may, in fact,\n\
    \   involve an extensive, substantive exchange of ideas and opinions.\n   This\
    \ step SHOULD be carried out informally on the mailing list of the\n   REWG or\
    \ on the Routing Area discussion mailing list, and MAY be\n   initiated by any\
    \ individual, group of individuals, external\n   organization, or IETF working\
    \ group.\n   When an external SDO has a liaison relationship with the IETF, it\
    \ MAY\n   carry out this step using a formal liaison.  The liaison SHOULD be\n\
    \   sent to the designated liaison manager who is responsible for\n   forwarding\
    \ them to the IESG who will assign a Responsible AD.  The\n   initiators of the\
    \ liaison SHOULD make themselves available for\n   discussion on the selected\
    \ mailing list.  If a formal liaison is\n   used, the IETF will respond using\
    \ the procedures of [RFC4053].\n   At this stage, a problem statement I-D MAY\
    \ be produced to help\n   further the discussions and to clarify the issues being\
    \ addressed.\n   A possible outcome of this preliminary investigation is that\
    \ the\n   requirements and problem are understood, but agreed to be out of\n \
    \  scope for the IETF.  Alternatively, it may be that the problem can be\n   solved\
    \ with existing protocols.  The full list of outcomes from the\n   preliminary\
    \ investigation phase are similar to those for the\n   requirements statement\
    \ evaluation phase described in Section 4.2.2,\n   but the requirements statement\
    \ evaluation phase that allows wider\n   IETF community participation in developing\
    \ a complete requirement set\n   MUST form part of the process if the IETF is\
    \ to consider to develop\n   protocol solutions.  The process cannot move direct\
    \ from the\n   preliminary investigation phase to the development of solutions\n\
    \   unless the working group agrees (e.g., the problem is minor).\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Requirements Statement Evaluation\n   Before the IETF can formally pronounce\
    \ on requests to change or\n   extend the (G)MPLS protocols, a requirements statement\
    \ I-D MUST be\n   written per [RFC2026].\n   The requirements statement I-D MUST\
    \ be introduced by the authors to\n   the IETF through an email to the REWG mailing\
    \ list, to the Routing\n   Area discussion mailing list, or by a formal liaison\
    \ from an external\n   SDO which will result in the IETF introducing the requirements\n\
    \   statement I-D to the REWG mailing list.  If the requirements\n   statement\
    \ I-D is brought to the IETF through a formal liaison, the\n   initiators of the\
    \ liaison SHOULD make themselves available for\n   discussion on the designated\
    \ IETF mailing lists.\n   After discussion on the IETF mailing lists, the responsible\
    \ Area\n   Director MUST decide whether the requirements will be formally\n  \
    \ evaluated by the IETF, and MUST deliver a response to the per\n   [RFC4053]\
    \ and [RFC4775].  If a formal liaison was not used, the\n   response SHOULD be\
    \ delivered to the appropriate contact as listed on\n   the communication.\n \
    \  The IETF response MUST be sufficiently explanatory to inform the\n   requesting\
    \ organization of what, if anything, the IETF has decided to\n   do in response\
    \ to the request.  The following list is provided to\n   illustrate possible responses:\n\
    \   a.  Requirements not understood.  Further discussion is required.\n   b. \
    \ Requirements understood, but judged to be out of scope for the\n       IETF.\
    \  In this case, the originator of the requirements can work\n       on requirements\
    \ and solutions and will not be impeded by the\n       IETF.  The IETF may request\
    \ to be kept informed of progress.\n   c.  Requirements understood, but no protocol\
    \ extensions are needed.\n       It may be desirable for the external SDO to cooperate\
    \ with the an\n       IETF working group in the production of an Applicability\n\
    \       Statement Internet-Draft.\n   d.  Requirements understood, and the IETF\
    \ would like to develop\n       protocol extensions.  This results in execution\
    \ of the rest of\n       the procedure, described below.  The requirements raised\
    \ in the\n       requirements statement I-D may be combined with other\n     \

  - "5.1.  Reasons for Rejection\n   The requirements statement I-D can only be rejected\
    \ with full\n   disclosure by the IETF.  Possible reasons for rejection and possible\n\
    \   next steps as described here.\n   - Requirements not understood.  Either during\
    \ preliminary\n     investigation or during evaluation of the requirements statement\n\
    \     I-D, it was not clear what the requirements are, or what the\n     problem\
    \ being addressed is.\n     This rejection forms part of an on-going communication\
    \ and it is\n     expected that the process will continue with further iterations.\n\
    \   - Out of scope for the IETF.  Many stages of this process may\n     determine\
    \ that the requirements are out of scope for the IETF.  In\n     this case, the\
    \ IETF MUST NOT constrain the authors of the\n     requirements statement I-D\
    \ from working on a solution.  If any\n     (G)MPLS changes are later identified,\
    \ the requestor MUST reinitiate\n     the (G)MPLS change procedure.\n   - No protocols\
    \ extensions or changes are needed.  At some stage in\n     the evaluation of\
    \ the requirements it may become clear that they\n     can all be met through\
    \ appropriate use of existing protocols.  In\n     this case, no further evaluation\
    \ of the requirements is required,\n     but the REWG MUST explain how the protocols\
    \ can be used to meet the\n     requirements and MAY cooperate with the authors\
    \ of the requirements\n     statement I-D in the production of an Applicability\
    \ Statement\n     Internet-Draft or a Profiles Internet-Draft that explains precisely\n\
    \     how the existing protocols can be used to meet the requirements.\n   - Insufficient\
    \ support within the IETF.  Although the work described\n     within the requirements\
    \ statement I-D is within scope for the IETF,\n     and despite the support of\
    \ the originators of the requirements\n     statement I-D on the REWG mailing\
    \ list, the chairs of the REWG have\n     determined that there is insufficient\
    \ support in the REWG to\n     complete requirements statement I-D and initiate\
    \ solutions work in\n     the PSWG.  In this case, the IETF MUST NOT restrict\
    \ the authors of\n     the requirements statement I-D from working on a solution.\
    \  The\n     solution (and/or IANA codepoints requested) SHALL be presented to\n\
    \     the IETF's (G)MPLS PSWG for review and possible publication as an\n    \
    \ Informational or Experimental RFC, and, pending IETF review\n     results, the\
    \ IETF SHALL NOT block applications to IANA for\n     codepoints.  If IANA codepoint\
    \ assignments are required, the IANA\n     Requirements prescribed for those assignments\
    \ in the relevant RFCs\n     MUST be satisfied.  It is highly recommended for\
    \ the SDO to\n     encourage its participants to participate in the IETF work\
    \ to\n     ensure appropriate industry representation in the work.\n   - Insufficient\
    \ support for the work from the original requesters.  If\n     the authors of\
    \ the requirements statement I-D do not make\n     themselves available on the\
    \ REWG mailing list for discussion of the\n     requirements or do not contribute\
    \ the completion of the\n     requirements statement I-D, the chairs of the REWG\
    \ MAY determine\n     that there is insufficient support for the work and MAY\
    \ reject the\n     requirements statement I-D.  In this case, the IETF MUST NOT\
    \ grant\n     permission for the work to be carried out in any other\n     organization,\
    \ and MUST NOT endorse the publication of any changes\n     or extensions to the\
    \ (G)MPLS protocols and MUST NOT instruct IANA\n     to allocate any codepoints.\
    \  The requirements may be reintroduced\n     by starting the procedure again\
    \ from the top.\n   - Satisfying the requirements would break the technology.\
    \  It is\n     possible that an assessment will be made that, although the\n \
    \    requirements are reasonable, it is not possible to satisfy them\n     through\
    \ extensions or changes to the (G)MPLS protocols without\n     violating the (G)MPLS\
    \ architecture in such a way as would break the\n     (G)MPLS technology.  In\
    \ this case, a recommendation will be made\n     that some other technology be\
    \ used to satisfy the requirements.\n     See Section 7 for further discussions\
    \ of the protection of the\n     integrity of the (G)MPLS technology.  In this\
    \ case, the IETF MUST\n     NOT grant permission for the work to be carried out\

    \ IETF as a preliminary\n     investigation (see Section 4.2.1) through an email\
    \ exchange then\n     the response MUST be made as an email response copied to\
    \ an IETF\n     mailing list so that it is automatically archived.\n   - If the\
    \ requirements are brought to the IETF as a preliminary\n     investigation (see\
    \ Section 4.2.1) through a formal liaison, the\n     rejection MUST be delivered\
    \ through a formal liaison response.\n   - If a requirements statement I-D has\
    \ been produced and discussed on\n     an IETF email list, the response MUST be\
    \ made as an email response\n     and copied to the email list.\n   - If a requirements\
    \ statement I-D has been produced and brought to\n     the IETF through a formal\
    \ liaison, the rejection MUST be delivered\n     through a formal liaison response.\n\
    \   - If an IETF working group has been involved in the review or\n     production\
    \ of any Internet-Drafts for the requirements or for the\n     solutions, the\
    \ working group MUST be notified of the rejection and\n     the reasons.\n   The\
    \ responsibility for the generation of the response lies with the\n   person,\
    \ people, or group that instigates the rejection.  This may be\n   the IESG, one\
    \ or more Area Directors, one or more working group\n   chairs, or a designated\
    \ expert [RFC2434].  In the case of the use of\n   a liaison relationship, the\
    \ IETF's liaison manager has responsibility\n   for ensuring that the procedures\
    \ in this document, and particularly\n   the rejection procedures, are followed.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Abandonment of the Solutions I-D\n   Once the solutions work has been started\
    \ by the PSWG, it may be\n   abandoned before completion.  This can happen if\
    \ the PSWG chairs\n   determine that there is no longer working group support\
    \ for doing the\n   work.  This could arise, for example, if no one (including\
    \ the\n   originators of the requirements statement I-D) is willing to\n   contribute\
    \ to the development of a solutions I-D.\n   In the event that the solutions work\
    \ is abandoned by the PSWG, the\n   Area Directors responsible for the PSWG MUST\
    \ be consulted.  The\n   originators of the requirements statement I-D MUST be\
    \ informed that\n   the work has been abandoned using a mechanism dependent on\
    \ how the\n   requirements were introduced (as discussed in Section 5.2).\n  \
    \ If the solution is abandoned in this way, work on solutions for the\n   requirements\
    \ MUST NOT be started in another forum.  The status of\n   extensions and changes\
    \ to the (G)MPLS protocols with regard to the\n   specific requirements returns\
    \ to how it was before the process\n   started.  Any new examination of the requirements\
    \ MUST commence at\n   the top of the process.\n"

- title: 7.  (G)MPLS Integrity and Ownership
  contents:
  - "7.  (G)MPLS Integrity and Ownership\n   The (G)MPLS working groups are REQUIRED\
    \ to protect the architectural\n   integrity of the (G)MPLS protocols and MUST\
    \ NOT extend the GMPLS\n   architecture with features that do not have general\
    \ use beyond the\n   specific case.  They also MUST NOT modify the architecture\
    \ just to\n   make some function more efficient at the expense of simplicity or\n\
    \   generality.\n   The architectural implications of additions or changes to\
    \ the (G)MPLS\n   protocols MUST consider interoperability with existing and future\n\
    \   versions of the protocols.  The effects of adding features that\n   overlap,\
    \ or that deal with a point solution and are not general, are\n   much harder\
    \ to control with rules and risk impacting the protocol as\n   a whole.  Therefore,\
    \ to minimize operational and technical risks to\n   the (G)MPLS technology, IETF\
    \ processes SHALL be followed for any\n   requests on extensions to (G)MPLS protocols.\
    \  With respect to (G)MPLS\n   protocols, the (G)MPLS PSWG is the chartered \"\
    owner\" of the (G)MPLS\n   protocol, as long as the working group exists.  All\
    \ changes or\n   extensions to (G)MPLS MUST first be reviewed by the (G)MPLS PSWG.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   All requirements statement I-Ds MUST give full\
    \ consideration to the\n   security impact of the proposed additional features\
    \ or functions.\n   All solutions I-Ds MUST consider the impact on the security\
    \ of the\n   protocol extensions and to the pre-existing protocol.\n   This documents\
    \ does not itself introduce any security issues for any\n   (G)MPLS protocols.\n\
    \   The IETF process is itself at risk from denial of service attacks.\n   This\
    \ document utilizes the IETF process and adds clarity to that\n   process.  It\
    \ is possible, therefore, that this document might put the\n   IETF process at\
    \ risk.\n   Therefore, provided that the number of requirements statement I-Ds\
    \ is\n   not unreasonable, there will be no significant impact on the IETF\n \
    \  process.  The rate of arrival of requirements statement I-Ds MAY be\n   used\
    \ by the IESG to detect denial of service attacks, and the IESG\n   SHOULD act\
    \ on such an event depending on the source of the\n   requirements statement I-D\
    \ and the perceived relevance of the work.\n   The IESG might, for example, discuss\
    \ the issue with the management of\n   external organizations.\n"
