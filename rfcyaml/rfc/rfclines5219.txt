Abstract This document describes an RTP (Real Time Protocol) payload format for transporting MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) 1 or 2, layer III audio (commonly known as "MP3").
This format is an alternative to that described in RFC 2250, and performs better if there is packet loss.
This document obsoletes RFC 3119, correcting typographical errors in the "SDP usage" section and pseudo code appendices.
While the RTP payload format defined in RFC 2250 [1] is generally applicable to all forms of MPEG audio or video, it is sub optimal for MPEG 1 or 2, layer III audio (commonly known as "MP3").
The reason for this is that an MP3 frame is not a true "Application Data Unit"
it contains a back pointer to data in earlier frames, and so cannot be decoded independently of these earlier frames.
Because RFC 2250 defines that packet boundaries coincide with frame boundaries, it handles packet loss inefficiently when carrying MP3 data.
The loss of an MP3 frame will render some data in previous (or future) frames useless, even if they are received without loss.
In this document, we define an alternative RTP payload format for MP3 audio.
This format uses a data preserving rearrangement of the original MPEG frames, so that packet boundaries now coincide with true MP3 "Application Data Units", which can also (optionally) be rearranged in an interleaving pattern.
This new format is therefore more data efficient than RFC 2250 in the face of packet loss.
The Structure of MP3 Frames
In this section we give a brief overview of the structure of an MP3 frame.
(For a more detailed description, see the MPEG 1 audio [3] and MPEG 2 audio [4] specifications.)
Each MPEG audio frame begins with a 4 byte header.
Information defined by this header includes:  Whether the audio is MPEG 1 or MPEG 2.
Whether the audio is layer I, II, or III.
(The remainder of this document assumes layer III, i.e., "MP3" frames.)
Whether the audio is mono or stereo.
Whether or not there is a 2 byte CRC field following the header.
(indirectly) The size of the frame.
The following structures appear after the header:  (optionally) A 2 byte Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) field  A "side info" structure.
This has the following length:  32 bytes for MPEG 1 stereo  17 bytes for MPEG 1 mono, or for MPEG 2 stereo  9 bytes for MPEG 2 mono
Encoded audio data, plus optional ancillary data (filling out the rest of the frame)
For the purpose of this document, the "side info" structure is the most important, because it defines the location and size of the "Application Data Unit" (ADU) that an MP3 decoder will process.
In particular, the "side info" structure defines:
This is a back pointer (in bytes) to the start of the ADU.
The back pointer is counted from the beginning of the frame, and counts only encoded audio data and any ancillary data (i.e., ignoring any header, CRC, or "side info" fields).
An MP3 decoder processes each ADU independently.
The ADUs will generally vary in length, but their average length will, of course, be that of the of the MP3 frames (minus the length of the header, CRC, and "side info" fields).
(In MPEG literature, this ADU is sometimes referred to as a "bit reservoir".)
As noted in [5], a payload format should be designed so that packet boundaries coincide with "codec frame boundaries"   i.e., with ADUs.
In the RFC 2250 payload format for MPEG audio [1], each RTP packet payload contains MP3 frames.
In this new payload format for MP3 audio, however, each RTP packet payload contains "ADU frames", each preceded by an "ADU descriptor".
ADU Frames An "ADU frame" is defined as:  The 4 byte MPEG header (the same as the original MP3 frame, except that the first 11 bits are (optionally) replaced by an "Interleaving Sequence Number", as described in Section 7 below)
The optional 2 byte CRC field (the same as the original MP3 frame)  The "side info" structure (the same as the original MP3 frame)  The complete sequence of encoded audio data (and any ancillary data) for the ADU (i.e., running from the start of this MP3 frame's "main data begin" back pointer, up to the start of the next MP3 frame's back pointer) Note that there is a one to one mapping between MP3 frames and ADU frames.
Because MP3 frames are self describing, with the bitrate (and sampling frequency) encoded within the 4 byte MPEG header, the same is true for ADU frames.
Therefore, as with MP3 streams, the bitrate can change within a stream and may be used for congestion control.
ADU Descriptors Within each RTP packet payload, each "ADU frame" is preceded by a 1  or 2 byte "ADU descriptor", which gives the size of the ADU and indicates whether or not this packet's data is a continuation of the previous packet's data.
An ADU descriptor consists of the following fields:  "C": Continuation flag (1 bit):  1, if the data following the ADU descriptor is a continuation of an ADU frame that was too large to fit within a single RTP packet; 0 otherwise.
"T": Descriptor Type flag (1 bit): 0
if this is a 1 byte ADU descriptor; 1 if this is a 2 byte ADU descriptor.
"ADU size" (6 or 14 bits):
The size (in bytes) of the ADU frame that will follow this ADU descriptor (i.e., NOT including the size of the descriptor itself).
A 2 byte ADU descriptor (with a 14 bit "ADU size" field) is used for ADU frame sizes of 64 bytes or more.
For smaller ADU frame sizes, senders MAY alternatively use a 1 byte ADU descriptor (with a 6 bit "ADU size" field).
Receivers MUST be able to accept an ADU descriptor of either size.
Each RTP packet payload begins with an "ADU descriptor", followed by "ADU frame" data.
Each such packet begins with an ADU descriptor.
The first packet's descriptor has a "C" (continuation) flag of 0; the following packets' descriptors each have a "C" flag of 1.
Each descriptor, in this case, has the same "ADU size" value: the size of the entire "ADU frame" (not just the portion that will fit within a single RTP packet).
Each such packet (even the last one) contains only one "ADU descriptor".
The (static) payload type 14 that was defined for MPEG audio [6] MUST NOT be used.
Instead, a different, dynamic payload type MUST be used   i.e., one within the range [96..127].
M bit: This payload format defines no use for this bit.
Senders SHOULD set this bit to zero in each outgoing packet.
Timestamp: This is a 32 bit, 90 kHz timestamp, representing the presentation time of the first ADU packed within the packet.
Handling Received Data Note that no information is lost by converting a sequence of MP3 frames to a corresponding sequence of "ADU frames", so a receiving RTP implementation can either feed the ADU frames directly to an appropriately modified MP3 decoder, or convert them back into a sequence of MP3 frames, as described in Appendix A.2 below.
Handling Multiple MPEG Audio Layers
The RTP payload format described here is intended only for MPEG 1 or 2, layer III audio ("MP3").
In contrast, layer I and layer II frames are self contained, without a back pointer to earlier frames.
However, it is possible (although unusual) for a sequence of audio frames to consist of a mixture of layer III frames, and layer I or II frames.
When such a sequence is transmitted, only layer III frames are converted to ADUs; layer I or II
frames are sent 'as is' (except for the prepending of an "ADU descriptor").
Similarly, the receiver of a sequence of frames   using this payload format   leaves layer I and II frames untouched (after removing the prepended "ADU descriptor"), but converts layer III frames from "ADU frames" to regular MP3 frames.
(Recall that each frame's layer is identified from its 4 byte MPEG header.)
If you are transmitting a stream consisting  only  of layer I or layer II frames (i.e., without any MP3 data), then there is no benefit to using this payload format,  unless  you are using the interleaving mechanism described in Section 7 below.
Frame Packetizing and Depacketizing The transmission of a sequence of MP3 frames takes the following steps:
MP3 frames  1  ADU frames  2  interleaved ADU frames
Step 1 is the conversion of a sequence of MP3 frames to a corresponding sequence of ADU frames, and takes place as described in Sections 3 and 4.1 above.
(Note also the pseudo code in Appendix A.1.)
Step 2 is the reordering of the sequence of ADU frames in an (optional) interleaving pattern, prior to packetization, as described in section 7 below.
(Note also the pseudo code in Appendix B.1.)
Interleaving helps reduce the effect of packet loss by distributing consecutive ADU frames over non consecutive packets.
(Note that because of the back pointer in MP3 frames, interleaving can be applied   in general   only to ADU frames.
Thus, interleaving was not possible for RFC 2250.)
Step 3 is the packetizing of a sequence of (interleaved) ADU frames into RTP packets   as described in section 4.3 above.
Each packet's RTP timestamp is the presentation time of the first ADU that is packed within it.
Note that if interleaving was done in step 2, the RTP timestamps on outgoing packets will not necessarily be monotonically nondecreasing.
Similarly, a sequence of received RTP packets is handled as follows:
RTP packets ordered by RTP sequence number  5  interleaved ADU frames
7  MP3 frames Step 4 is the usual sorting of incoming RTP packets using the RTP sequence number.
Step 5 is the depacketizing of ADU frames from RTP packets   i.e., the reverse of step 3.
As part of this process, a receiver uses the "C" (continuation) flag in the ADU descriptor to notice when an ADU frame is split over more than one packet (and to discard the ADU frame entirely if one of these packets is lost).
Step 6 is the rearranging of the sequence of ADU frames back to its original order (except for ADU frames missing due to packet loss), as described in Section 7 below.
(Note also the pseudo code in Appendix B.2.)
Step 7 is the conversion of the sequence of ADU frames into a corresponding sequence of MP3 frames   i.e., the reverse of step 1.
(Note also the pseudo code in Appendix A.2.)
With an appropriately modified MP3 decoder, an implementation may omit this step; instead, it could feed ADU frames directly to the (modified) MP3 decoder.
In MPEG audio frames (MPEG 1 or 2; all layers), the high order 11 bits of the 4 byte MPEG header ('syncword') are always all one (i.e., 0xFFE).
When reordering a sequence of ADU frames for transmission, we reuse these 11 bits as an "Interleaving Sequence Number" (ISN).
(Upon reception, they are replaced with 0xFFE once again.)
The structure of the ISN is (a,b), where:
That is, the 4 byte MPEG header is reused as follows:
(This particular pattern has the property that any loss of up to four consecutive ADUs in the interleaved stream will lead to a deinterleaved stream with no gaps greater than one.)
This produces the following sequence of ISNs:
So, in this example, a sequence of ADU frames f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 (etc.) would get reordered, in step 2, into: (1,0)f1 (3,0)f3 (5,0)f5 (
7,0)f7 (0,0)f0 (2,0)f2 (4,0)f4 (6,0)f6 (1,1)f9 (3,1)f11 (5,1)f13 (etc.) and the reverse reordering (along with replacement of the 0xFFE) would occur upon reception.
The reason for breaking the ISN into "Interleave Cycle Count" and "Interleave Index" (rather than just treating it as a single 11 bit counter) is to give receivers a way of knowing when an ADU frame should be 'released' to the ADU MP3 conversion process (step 7 above), rather than waiting for more interleaved ADU frames to arrive.
For instance, in the example above, when the receiver sees a frame with ISN (<something>,1), it knows that it can release all previously seen frames with ISN (<something>,0), even if some other (<something>,0) frames remain missing due to packet loss.
An 8 bit Interleave Index allows interleave cycles of size up to 256.
The choice of an interleaving order can be made independently of RTP packetization.
Thus, a simple implementation could choose an interleaving order first, reorder the ADU frames accordingly (step 2), then simply pack them sequentially into RTP packets (step 3).
However, the size of ADU frames
and thus the number of ADU frames that will fit in each RTP packet   will typically vary in size, so a more optimal implementation would combine steps 2 and 3, by choosing an interleaving order that better reflected the number of ADU frames packed within each RTP packet.
Each receiving implementation of this payload format MUST recognize the ISN and be able to perform deinterleaving of incoming ADU frames (step 6).
However, a sending implementation of this payload format MAY choose not to perform interleaving   i.e., by omitting step 2.
In this case, the high order 11 bits in each 4 byte MPEG header would remain at 0xFFE.
Receiving implementations would thus see a sequence of identical ISNs (all 0xFFE).
They would handle this in the same way as if the Interleave Cycle Count changed with each ADU frame, by simply releasing the sequence of incoming ADU frames sequentially to the ADU MP3 conversion process (step 7), without reordering.
(Note also the pseudo code in Appendix B.2.)

An example of the media representation in SDP is: m audio 49000 RTP/AVP 121 a rtpmap:121 mpa robust/90000
Note that the RTP timestamp frequency MUST be 90000.
If a session using this payload format is being encrypted, and interleaving is being used, then the sender SHOULD ensure that any change of encryption key coincides with a start of a new interleave cycle.
Apart from this, the security considerations for this payload format are identical to those noted for RFC 2250 [1].
Appendix A.  Translating between "MP3 Frames" and "ADU Frames" The following 'pseudo code' describes how a sender using this payload format can translate a sequence of regular "MP3 Frames" to "ADU Frames", and how a receiver can perform the reverse translation: from "ADU Frames" to "MP3 Frames".
We first define the following abstract data structures:  "Segment": A record that represents either a "MP3 Frame" or an "ADU Frame".
It consists of the following fields:  "header": the 4 byte MPEG header  "headerSize": a constant (  4)  "sideInfo": the 'side info' structure,  including  the optional 2 byte CRC field, if present  "sideInfoSize": the size (in bytes) of the above structure  "frameData": the remaining data in this frame  "frameDataSize": the size (in bytes) of the above data  "backpointer": the value (expressed in bytes) of the backpointer for this frame  "aduDataSize": the size (in bytes) of the ADU associated with this frame.
(If the frame is already an "ADU Frame", then aduDataSize
frameDataSize)  "mp3FrameSize": the total size (in bytes) that this frame would have if it were a regular "MP3 Frame".
(If it is already a "MP3 Frame", then mp3FrameSize
) Note that this size can be derived completely from "header".
"SegmentQueue": A FIFO queue of "Segments", with operations  void enqueue(Segment)
Segment tail()  Segment previous(Segment):  returns the segment prior to a given one  Segment next(Segment): returns the segment after a given one  unsigned totalDataSize(): returns the sum of the "frameDataSize" fields of each entry in the queue A.1.

Appendix B.  Interleaving and Deinterleaving
The following 'pseudo code' describes how a sender can reorder a sequence of "ADU Frames" according to an interleaving pattern (step 2), and how a receiver can perform the reverse reordering (step 6).
Interleaving a Sequence of "ADU Frames" We first define the following abstract data structures:  "interleaveCycleSize": an integer in the range [1..256]
"interleaveCycle": an array, of size "interleaveCycleSize", containing some permutation of the integers from the set [0 .. interleaveCycleSize 1]
e.g., if "interleaveCycleSize"   8, "interleaveCycle" might contain: 1,3,5,7,0,2,4,6  "inverseInterleaveCycle": an array containing the inverse of the permutation in "interleaveCycle"   i.e., such that interleaveCycle[inverseInterleaveCycle[i]]
i  "ii": the current Interleave Index (initially 0)  "icc": the current Interleave Cycle Count (initially 0)  "aduFrameBuffer": an array, of size "interleaveCycleSize", of ADU Frames that are awaiting packetization while (1)
Be sure to leave the remaining 21 bits //

The primary change from RFC 3119 is to correct the encoding name in the "SDP usage" section.
The correct encoding name is "mpa robust".
Also, the term "media type" replaces "mime type".
Finally, some minor bug fixes and clarifications were made to the (non normative) pseudo code in Appendix A and Appendix B.
