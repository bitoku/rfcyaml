  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document analyzes security threats to Simplified Multicast\n\
    \   Forwarding (SMF) [RFC6621].  SMF aims at providing basic Internet\n   Protocol\
    \ (IP) multicast forwarding in a way that is suitable for\n   wireless mesh and\
    \ Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET).  SMF consists of\n   two major functional components:\
    \ duplicate packet detection (DPD) and\n   relay set selection (RSS).\n   SMF\
    \ is typically used in decentralized wireless environments and is\n   potentially\
    \ exposed to various attacks and misconfigurations.  In a\n   wireless environment,\
    \ some of these attacks and misconfigurations\n   represent threats of particular\
    \ significance as compared to what they\n   would do in wired networks.  [RFC6621]\
    \ briefly discusses several of\n   these, but does not define any explicit security\
    \ measures for\n   protecting the integrity of the protocol.\n   This document\
    \ is based on the assumption that no additional security\n   mechanism, such as\
    \ IPsec, is used in the IP layer, as not all MANET\n   deployments may be able\
    \ to support deployment of such common IP\n   protection mechanisms (e.g., because\
    \ MANET routers may have limited\n   resources for supporting the IPsec stack).\
    \  It also assumes that\n   there is no lower-layer protection.  The document\
    \ analyzes possible\n   attacks on, and misconfigurations of, SMF and outlines\
    \ the\n   consequences of such attacks/misconfigurations to the state\n   maintained\
    \ by SMF in each router.\n   In the Security Considerations section of [RFC6621],\
    \ denial-of-\n   service-attack scenarios are briefly discussed.  This document\n\
    \   further analyzes and describes the potential vulnerabilities of, and\n   attack\
    \ vectors for, SMF.  While completeness in such analysis is\n   always a goal,\
    \ no claims of being complete are made.  The goal of\n   this document is to be\
    \ helpful when deploying SMF in a network and\n   for understanding the risks\
    \ incurred, as well as for providing a\n   reference to and documented experience\
    \ with SMF as input for possible\n   future developments of SMF.\n   This document\
    \ is not intended to propose solutions to the threats\n   described.  [RFC7182]\
    \ provides a framework that can be used with SMF,\n   and depending on how it\
    \ is used, may offer some degree of protection\n   against the threats related\
    \ to identity spoofing described in this\n   document.\n   This document also\
    \ updates [RFC7186], specifically with respect to\n   threats to relay set selection\
    \ (RSS) mechanisms that are using MANET\n   NHDP [RFC6130].\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document uses the terminology and notation defined in\
    \ [RFC5444],\n   [RFC6130], [RFC6621], and [RFC4949].\n   Additionally, this document\
    \ introduces the following terminology:\n   SMF router:  A MANET router, running\
    \ SMF as specified in [RFC6621].\n   Attacker:  A device that is present in the\
    \ network and intentionally\n      seeks to compromise the information bases in\
    \ SMF routers.  It may\n      generate syntactically correct SMF control messages.\n\
    \   Legitimate SMF router:  An SMF router that is correctly configured\n     \
    \ and not compromised by an attacker.\n"
- title: 3.  SMF Threat Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  SMF Threat Overview\n   An SMF router requires an external dynamic neighborhood\
    \ discovery\n   mechanism in order to maintain suitable topological information\n\
    \   describing its immediate neighborhood, and thereby allowing it to\n   select\
    \ reduced relay sets for forwarding multicast data traffic.\n   Such an external\
    \ dynamic neighborhood discovery mechanism may be\n   provided by lower-layer\
    \ interface information, by a concurrently\n   operating MANET routing protocol\
    \ that already maintains such\n   information (e.g., [RFC7181]) or by explicitly\
    \ using the MANET\n   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130].  If NHDP\
    \ is used\n   for both 1-hop and 2-hop neighborhood discovery by SMF, SMF\n  \
    \ implicitly inherits the vulnerabilities of NHDP discussed in\n   [RFC7186].\
    \  As SMF relies on NHDP to assist in network-layer 2-hop\n   neighborhood discovery\
    \ (no matter if other lower-layer mechanisms are\n   used for 1-hop neighborhood\
    \ discovery), this document assumes that\n   NHDP is used in SMF.  The threats\
    \ that are NHDP specific are\n   indicated explicitly.\n   Based on neighborhood\
    \ discovery mechanisms, [RFC6621] specifies two\n   principal functional components:\
    \ duplicate packet detection (DPD) and\n   relay set selection (RSS).\n   DPD\
    \ is required by SMF in order to be able to detect duplicate\n   packets and eliminate\
    \ their redundant forwarding.  An attacker has\n   two ways in which to harm the\
    \ DPD mechanisms.  Specifically, it can:\n   o  \"deactivate\" DPD, making it\
    \ such that duplicate packets are not\n      correctly detected.  As a consequence,\
    \ they are (redundantly)\n      transmitted, which increases the load on the network,\
    \ drains the\n      batteries of the routers involved, etc.\n   o  \"pre-activate\"\
    \ DPD, making DPD detect a later arriving (valid)\n      packet as being a duplicate\
    \ and will, therefore, not be forwarded.\n   Attacks on DPD can be achieved by\
    \ replaying existing packets,\n   wrangling sequence numbers, manipulating hash\
    \ values, etc.; these are\n   detailed in Section 4.\n   RSS produces a reduced\
    \ relay set for forwarding multicast data\n   packets across a MANET.  For use\
    \ in SMF, [RFC6621] specifies several\n   relay set algorithms including E-CDS\
    \ (Essential Connected Dominating\n   Set) [RFC5614], S-MPR (Source-Based Multipoint\
    \ Relay, as known from\n   [RFC3626] and [RFC7181]), and MPR-CDS (Multipoint Relay\
    \ Connected\n   Dominating Set) [MPR-CDS].  An attacker can disrupt the RSS\n\
    \   algorithm, and thereby the SMF operation, by degrading it to\n   classical\
    \ flooding or by \"masking\" certain parts of the network from\n   the multicasting\
    \ domain.  Attacks on RSS algorithms are detailed in\n   Section 5.\n   Other\
    \ than the attacks on DPD and RSS, a common vulnerability of\n   MANETs is \"\
    jamming\", i.e., a device generates massive amounts of\n   interfering radio transmissions,\
    \ which will prevent legitimate\n   traffic (e.g., control traffic as well as\
    \ data traffic) on part of a\n   network.  The attacks on DPD and RSS can be further\
    \ enhanced by\n   jamming.\n"
- title: 4.  Threats to Duplicate Packet Detection
  contents:
  - "4.  Threats to Duplicate Packet Detection\n   Duplicate packet detection (DPD)\
    \ is required for packet dissemination\n   in MANETs because: (1) packets may\
    \ be retransmitted via the same\n   physical interface as the one over which they\
    \ were received, and (2)\n   a router may receive multiple copies of the same\
    \ packet (on the same\n   or on different interfaces) from different neighbors.\
    \  DPD is thus\n   used to check whether or not an incoming packet has been previously\n\
    \   received.\n   DPD is achieved by maintaining a record of recently processed\n\
    \   multicast packets, and comparing later received multicast packets\n   herewith.\
    \  A duplicate packet detected is silently dropped and is not\n   inserted into\
    \ the forwarding path of that router, nor is it delivered\n   to an application.\
    \  DPD, as proposed by SMF, supports both IPv4 and\n   IPv6 and suggests two duplicate\
    \ packet detection mechanisms for each:\n   1) IP packet header content identification-based\
    \ DPD (I-DPD), in\n   combination with flow state, to estimate temporal uniqueness\
    \ of a\n   packet, and 2) hash-based DPD (H-DPD), employing hashing of selected\n\
    \   IP packet header fields and payload for the same effect.\n   In the Security\
    \ Considerations section of [RFC6621], a selection of\n   threats to DPD are briefly\
    \ introduced.  This section expands on that\n   discussion and describes how to\
    \ effectively launch the attacks on DPD\n   -- for example, by way of manipulating\
    \ jitter and/or the Hash-\n   Assistant Value.  In the remainder of this section,\
    \ common threats to\n   packet detection mechanisms are discussed first; then,\
    \ the threats to\n   I-DPD and H-DPD are introduced separately.  The threats described\
    \ in\n   this section are applicable to general SMF implementations,\n   regardless\
    \ of whether NHDP is used.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Attack on the Hop Limit Field
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Attack on the Hop Limit Field\n   One immediate Denial-of-Service (DoS)\
    \ attack is based on manipulating\n   the Time-to-Live (TTL, for IPv4) or Hop\
    \ Limit (for IPv6) field.  As\n   routers only forward packets with TTL > 1, an\
    \ attacker can forward an\n   otherwise valid packet while drastically reducing\
    \ the TTL hereof.\n   This will inhibit recipient routers from later forwarding\
    \ the same\n   multicast packet, even if received with a different TTL --\n  \
    \ essentially, an attacker can thus instruct its neighbors to block the\n   forwarding\
    \ of valid multicast packets.\n   For example, in Figure 1, router A forwards\
    \ a multicast packet with a\n   TTL of 64 to the network.  A, B, and C are legitimate\
    \ SMF routers,\n   and X is an attacker.  In a wireless environment, jitter is\
    \ commonly\n   used to avoid systematic collisions in Media Access Control (MAC)\n\
    \   protocols [RFC5148].  An attacker can thus increase the probability\n   that\
    \ its invalid packets arrive first by retransmitting them without\n   applying\
    \ jitter.  In this example, router X forwards the packet\n   without applying\
    \ jitter and reduces the TTL to 1.  Router C thus\n   records the duplicate detection\
    \ value (hash value for H-DPD or the\n   header content of the packets for I-DPD)\
    \ but does not forward the\n   packet (due to TTL == 1).  When a second copy of\
    \ the same packet,\n   with a non-maliciously manipulated TTL value (63 in this\
    \ case),\n   arrives from router B, it will be discarded as a duplicate packet.\n\
    \                                 .---.\n                                 | X\

    \                              Figure 1\n   As the TTL of a packet is intended\
    \ to be manipulated by\n   intermediaries forwarding it, classic methods such\
    \ as integrity check\n   values (e.g., digital signatures) are typically calculated\
    \ by setting\n   TTL fields to some predetermined value (e.g., 0) -- for example,\
    \ the\n   case for IPsec Authentication Headers -- rendering such an attack\n\
    \   more difficult to both detect and counter.\n   If the attacker has access\
    \ to a \"wormhole\" through the network (a\n   directional antenna, a tunnel to\
    \ a collaborator, or a wired\n   connection, allowing it to bridge parts of a\
    \ network otherwise\n   distant), it can make sure that the packets with such\
    \ an artificially\n   reduced TTL arrive before their unmodified counterparts.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Threats to Identification-Based Duplicate Packet Detection
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Threats to Identification-Based Duplicate Packet Detection\n   I-DPD uses\
    \ a specific DPD identifier in the packet header to identify\n   a packet.  By\
    \ default, such packet identification is not provided by\n   the IP packet header\
    \ (for both IPv4 and IPv6).  Therefore, additional\n   identification headers,\
    \ such as the fragment header, a hop-by-hop\n   header option, or IPsec sequencing,\
    \ must be employed in order to\n   support I-DPD.  The uniqueness of a packet\
    \ can then be identified by\n   the source IP address of the packet originator\
    \ and the sequence\n   number (from the fragment header, hop-by-hop header option,\
    \ or\n   IPsec).  By doing so, each intermediate router can keep a record of\n\
    \   recently received packets and determine whether or not the incoming\n   packet\
    \ has been received.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Pre-Activation Attacks (Pre-Play)
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Pre-Activation Attacks (Pre-Play)\n   In a wireless environment, or across\
    \ any other shared channel, an\n   attacker can perceive the identification tuple\
    \ (source IP address,\n   sequence number) of a packet.  It is possible to generate\
    \ a packet\n   with the same (source IP address, sequence number) pair with invalid\n\
    \   content.  If the sequence number progression is predictable, then it\n   is\
    \ trivial to generate and inject invalid packets with \"future\"\n   identification\
    \ information into the network.  If these invalid\n   packets arrive before the\
    \ legitimate packets that they are spoofing,\n   the latter will be treated as\
    \ a duplicate and will be discarded.\n   This can prevent multicast packets from\
    \ reaching parts of the\n   network.\n   Figure 2 gives an example of a pre-activation\
    \ attack.  A, B, and C\n   are legitimate SMF routers, and X is the attacker.\
    \  The line between\n   the routers presents the packet forwarding.  Router A\

    \ will be dropped by C as a duplicate packet.  An attacker can\n   manipulate\
    \ jitter to make sure that the invalid packets arrive first.\n   Router X can\
    \ even generate packets with future sequence numbers (if\n   they are predictable),\
    \ so that the future legitimate packets with the\n   same sequence numbers will\

    \ jitter, the validation of the timestamp would not be\n   helpful because the\

- title: 4.2.2.  De-activation Attacks (Sequence Number Wrangling)
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  De-activation Attacks (Sequence Number Wrangling)\n   An attacker can\
    \ also seek to de-activate DPD by modifying the\n   sequence number in packets\
    \ that it forwards.  Thus, routers will not\n   be able to detect an actual duplicate\
    \ packet as a duplicate --\n   rather, they will treat them as new packets, i.e.,\
    \ process and\n   forward them.  This is similar to DoS attacks, as each packet\
    \ that is\n   considered unique will be multicasted: for a network with n routers,\n\
    \   there will be n-1 retransmissions.  This can easily cause the\n   \"broadcast\
    \ storm\" problem discussed in [MOBICOM99].  The consequence\n   of this attack\
    \ is an increased channel load, the origin of which\n   appears to be a router\
    \ other than the attacker.\n   Given the topology shown in Figure 2, on receiving\
    \ a packet with\n   seq=n, the attacker X can forward the packet with a modified\
    \ sequence\n   number n+i.  This has two consequences: firstly, router C will\
    \ not be\n   able to detect that the packet forwarded by X is a duplicate packet;\n\
    \   secondly, the consequent packet with seq=n+i generated by router A\n   will\
    \ probably be treated as a duplicate packet and will be dropped by\n   router\
    \ C.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.  Threats to Hash-Based Duplicate Packet Detection\n   When explicit sequence\

    \ a digest collision happens.  However,\n   it also introduces a potential vulnerability.\
    \  As the HAV option is\n   only added when the source or the ingress SMF router\
    \ detects that the\n   incoming packet has digest collision with previously generated\n\
    \   packets, it can actually be regarded as a \"flag\" of potential digest\n \
    \  collision.  An attacker can discover the HAV header and be able to\n   conclude\
    \ that a hash collision is possible if the HAV header is\n   removed.  By doing\
    \ so, the modified packet received by other SMF\n   routers will be treated as\
    \ duplicate packets and will be dropped\n   because they have the same hash value\
    \ as previously received packets.\n   In the example shown in Figure 3, routers\
    \ A and B are legitimate SMF\n   routers; X is an attacker.  Router A generates\
    \ two packets, P1 and\n   P2, with the same hash value h(P1)=h(P2)=x.  Based on\
    \ the SMF\n   specification, a HAV is added to the latter packet P2, so that\n\
    \   h(P2+HAV)=x' avoids digest collision.  When the attacker X detects\n   the\
    \ HAV of P2, it is able to conclude that a collision is possible by\n   removing\
    \ the HAV header.  By doing so, packet P2 will be treated as a\n   duplicate packet\
    \ by router B and will be dropped.\n              P2            P1           \

    \ a\n   topological Connected Dominating Set based on 1-hop and 2-hop\n   neighborhood\
    \ information.  In this section, common threats to the RSS\n   framework are first\

    \ Relay Connected Dominating\n   Set (MPR-CDS)) explicitly enumerated by [RFC6621]\
    \ are analyzed.  As\n   the relay set selection is based on 1-hop and 2-hop neighborhood\n\

    \ Set\" (E-CDS) algorithm [RFC5614]\n   forms a single CDS mesh for an SMF operating\
    \ region.  This algorithm\n   requires 2-hop neighborhood information (the identity\

    \   An attacker can declare itself to have high route priority and spoof\n   the\

    \  By doing so, it can prevent legitimate SMF\n   routers from selecting themselves\

- title: 5.2.2.  Identity Spoofing
  contents:
  - "5.2.2.  Identity Spoofing\n   Identity spoofing implies that an attacker determines\
    \ and makes use\n   of the identity of other legitimate routers, without being\
    \ authorized\n   to do so.  The identity of other routers can be obtained by\n\
    \   eavesdropping the control messages or the source/destination address\n   from\
    \ datagrams.  The attacker can then generate control or datagram\n   traffic by\
    \ pretending to be a legitimate router.\n   Because E-CDS self-selection is based\
    \ on the router priority value,\n   an attacker can spoof the identity of other\
    \ legitimate routers and\n   declare a different router priority value.  If it\
    \ declares that a\n   spoofed router has a higher priority, it can prevent other\
    \ routers\n   from selecting themselves as relays.  On the other hand, if the\n\
    \   attacker declares that a spoofed router has a lower priority, it can\n   force\
    \ other routers to select themselves as relays to degrade the\n   multicast forwarding\
    \ to classical flooding.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.3.  Threats to S-MPR Algorithm\n   The S-MPR set selection algorithm enables\

    \ such that a\n   message generated by it, and relayed only by its MPRs, will\
    \ reach all\n   of its 2-hop neighbors.\n   An SMF router forwards a multicast\
    \ packet if and only if:\n   o  the packet has not been received before, and\n\
    \   o  the neighbor from which the packet was received has selected the\n    \
    \  router as MPR.\n   Because MPR calculation is based on the willingness declared\
    \ by the\n   SMF routers and the connectivity of the routers, it can be disrupted\n\

  contents:
  - "5.4.  Threats to the MPR-CDS Algorithm\n   MPR-CDS is a derivative from S-MPR.\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not specify a protocol or\
    \ a procedure.  The whole\n   document, however, reflects on security considerations\
    \ for SMF\n   regarding packet dissemination in MANETs.  Possible attacks to the\n\
    \   two main functional components of SMF, duplicate packet detection,\n   and\
    \ relay set selection are analyzed and documented.\n   Although neither [RFC6621]\
    \ nor this document propose mechanisms to\n   secure the SMF protocol, there are\
    \ several possibilities to secure\n   the protocol in the future and drive new\
    \ work by suggesting which\n   threats discussed in the previous sections could\
    \ be addressed.\n   For the I-DPD mechanism, employing randomized packet sequence\
    \ numbers\n   can avoid some pre-activation attacks based on sequence number\n\
    \   prediction.  If predicable sequence numbers have to be used, applying\n  \
    \ timestamps can mitigate pre-activation attacks.\n   For the H-DPD mechanism,\
    \ applying cryptographically strong hashes can\n   make the digest collisions\
    \ effectively impossible, and it can avoid\n   the use of a HAV.\n   [RFC7182]\
    \ specifies a framework for representing cryptographic\n   Integrity Check Values\
    \ (ICVs) and timestamps in MANETs.  Based on\n   [RFC7182], [RFC7183] specifies\
    \ integrity and replay protection for\n   NHDP using shared keys as a mandatory-to-implement\
    \ security\n   mechanism.  If SMF is using NHDP as the neighborhood discovery\n\
    \   protocol, implementing [RFC7183] remains advisable so as to enable\n   integrity\
    \ protection for NHDP control messages.  This can help\n   mitigate threats related\
    \ to identity spoofing through the exchange of\n   HELLO messages and provide\
    \ some general protection against identity\n   spoofing by admitting only trusted\
    \ routers to the network using ICVs\n   in HELLO messages.\n   Using ICVs does\
    \ not, of course, address the problem of attackers able\n   to also generate valid\
    \ ICVs.  Detection and exclusion of such\n   attackers is, in general, a challenge\
    \ that is not unrelated to how\n   [RFC7182] is used.  If, for example, it is\
    \ used with a shared key (as\n   per [RFC7183]), excluding single attackers generally\
    \ is not aided by\n   the use of ICVs.  However, if routers have sufficient capabilities\
    \ to\n   support the use of asymmetric keys (as per [RFC7859]), part of\n   addressing\
    \ this challenge becomes one of providing key revocation in\n   a way that does\
    \ not in itself introduce additional vulnerabilities.\n   As [RFC7183] does not\
    \ protect the integrity of the multicast user\n   datagram, and as no mechanism\
    \ is specified by SMF for doing so,\n   duplicate packet detection remains vulnerable\
    \ to the threats\n   introduced in Section 4.\n   If pre-activation/de-activation\
    \ attacks and attacks on the HAV of the\n   multicast datagrams are to be mitigated,\
    \ a datagram-level integrity\n   protection mechanism is desired, by taking consideration\
    \ of the\n   identity field or HAV.  However, this would not be helpful for the\n\
    \   attacks on the TTL (or Hop Limit for IPv6) field, because the mutable\n  \
    \ fields are generally not considered when ICV is calculated.\n"
