    - "1.1.  Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block\n   This document defines a new block
      type to augment those defined in\n   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.
      \ The new block type\n   supports the reporting of the proportion of packets
      discarded by the\n   jitter buffer at the receiver, using packet discard logic
      according\n   to the jitter buffer algorithms.  The discards during discard
      bursts\n   are reported, together with the number of bursts.  This block is\n
      \  intended to be used in conjunction with [RFC7002], which provides the\n   total
      packets discarded and on which this block therefore depends.\n   However, the
      metric in [RFC7002] may be used independently of the\n   metrics in this block.\n
      \  This block provides information on transient IP problems.  Burst/gap\n   metrics
      are typically used in cumulative reports; however, they also\n   may be used
      in interval reports (see the Interval Metric flag in\n   Section 3.2).  The
      burstiness of packet discard affects user\n   experience, may influence any
      sender strategies to mitigate the\n   problem, and may also have diagnostic
      value.\n   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end-system\n
      \  metrics defined in [RFC6792].\n   The definitions of \"burst\", \"gap\",
      \"loss\", and \"discard\" are\n   consistent with the definitions in [RFC3611].
      \ To accommodate the\n   range of jitter buffer algorithms and packet discard
      logic that may\n   be used by implementors, the method used to distinguish between\n
      \  bursts and gaps shall use an equivalent method to that defined in\n   Section
      4.7.2 of [RFC3611].  Note that reporting the specific jitter\n   buffer algorithms
      and/or packet discard logic is out of the scope of\n   this document.\n"

      an RTCP Extended\n   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report

      \  variation in packet-arrival time and don't use stream repair means,\n   e.g.,
      Forward Error Correction (FEC) [RFC5109] and/or retransmission\n   [RFC4588].\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n
    \  In addition, the following terms are defined:\n   Received, Lost, and Discarded\n
    \     A packet shall be regarded as \"lost\" if it fails to arrive within\n      an
    implementation-specific time window.  A packet that arrives\n      within this
    time window but is too early to be played out, too\n      late to be played out,
    or thrown away before playout due to packet\n      duplication or redundancy shall
    be regarded as discarded.  A\n      packet shall not be regarded as discarded
    if it arrives within\n      this time window but is dropped during decoding by
    some higher-\n      layer decoder, e.g., due to a decoding error.  A packet shall
    be\n      classified as one of received (or OK), discarded, or lost.  The\n      metric
    \"cumulative number of packets lost\" defined in [RFC3550]\n      reports a count
    of packets lost from the media stream (single\n      synchronization source (SSRC)
    within a single RTP session).\n      Similarly, the metric \"number of packets
    discarded\" defined in\n      [RFC7002] reports a count of packets discarded from
    the media\n      stream (single SSRC within a single RTP session) arriving at
    the\n      receiver.  Another metric, defined in [RFC5725], is available to\n
    \     report on packets that are not recovered by any repair techniques\n      that
    may be in use.  Note that the term \"discard\" defined here\n      builds on the
    \"discard\" definition in [RFC3611] but extends the\n      concept to take into
    account packet duplication and reports\n      different types of discard counts
    [RFC7002].\n   Bursts and Gaps\n      The terms \"burst\" and \"gap\" are used
    in a manner consistent with\n      that of RTCP XR [RFC3611].  RTCP XR views an
    RTP stream as being\n      divided into bursts, which are periods during which
    the discard\n      rate is high enough to cause noticeable quality degradation\n
    \     (generally over 5 percent discard rate), and gaps, which are\n      periods
    during which discarded packets are infrequent and hence\n      quality is generally
    acceptable.\n"

    \  block use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate\n   auxiliary
    Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes\n   measurement periods
    in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).\n   This metrics block relies on the measurement
    period in the\n   Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report.\n
    \  Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the\n   Measurement

      \     20.\n   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits\n      This field is used to
      indicate whether the burst/gap discard\n      metrics are Sampled, Interval,
      or Cumulative metrics [RFC6792]:\n         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported

    considerations apply.\n   RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which
    are periods\n   during which the discard rate is high enough to cause noticeable
    call\n   quality degradation (generally over 5 percent discard rate) and gaps,\n
    \  which are periods during which discarded packets are infrequent and\n   hence

    sent, i.e., a period of\n   silence in excess of Gmin packets will terminate a
    burst condition.\n   The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in [RFC3611]

  - "Appendix A.  Metrics Represented Using the Template from RFC 6390\n   a.  Burst/Gap
    Discard Threshold in RTP Metric\n       *  Metric Name: Burst/gap discard threshold
    in RTP\n       *  Metric Description: The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in\n
    \         [RFC3611], i.e., the number of successive packets that must\n          not
    be discarded prior to and following a discard packet in\n          order for this
    discarded packet to be regarded as part of a\n          gap.\n       *  Method
    of Measurement or Calculation: See Section 3.2,\n          Threshold definition.\n
    \      *  Units of Measurement: See Section 3.2, Threshold definition.\n       *
    \ Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: See\n          Section
    3, 1st paragraph.\n       *  Measurement Timing: See Section 3, 2nd paragraph
    for\n          measurement timing and Section 3.2 for Interval Metric flag.\n
    \      *  Use and Applications: See Section 1.4.\n       *  Reporting Model: See
    RFC 3611.\n   b.  Packets Discarded in Bursts Metric\n       *  Metric Name: RTP
    packets discarded in bursts\n       *  Metric Description: The total number of
    RTP packets discarded\n          during discard bursts.\n       *  Method of Measurement
    or Calculation: See Section 3.2, Packets\n          Discarded in Bursts definition.\n
    \      *  Units of Measurement: See Section 3.2, Packets Discarded in\n          Bursts
    definition.\n       *  Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain:
    See\n          Section 3, 1st paragraph.\n       *  Measurement Timing: See Section
    3, 2nd paragraph for\n          measurement timing and Section 3.2 for Interval
    Metric flag.\n       *  Use and Applications: See Section 1.4.\n       *  Reporting
    Model: See RFC 3611.\n   c.  Total Packets Expected in Discard Bursts Metric\n
    \      *  Metric Name: Total RTP packets expected in discard bursts\n       *
    \ Metric Description: The total number of packets expected\n          during discard
    bursts (that is, the sum of received packets\n          and lost packets).\n       *
    \ Method of Measurement or Calculation: See Section 3.2, Total\n          Packets
    Expected in Bursts definition.\n       *  Units of Measurement: See Section 3.2,
    Total Packets Expected\n          in Bursts definition.\n       *  Measurement
    Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: See\n          Section 3, 1st paragraph.\n
    \      *  Measurement Timing: See Section 3, 2nd paragraph for\n          measurement
    timing and Section 3.2 for Interval Metric flag.\n       *  Use and Applications:
    See Section 1.4.\n       *  Reporting Model: See RFC 3611.\n"
