  - "               Specification Changes for\n               OLS, RJE/RJOR, and SMFS\n\
    \     The following documents are hereby revised:\n     (1)  'Specifications for\
    \ Network Use of the UCSB\n          On-Line System [16 October 70, RFC 74, NIC\
    \ 5417],\n     (2)  'Network Specifications for Remote Job Entry and\n       \
    \   Remote Job Output Retrieval at UCSB' [22 March 71,\n          RFC 105, NIC\
    \ 5775], and\n     (3)  'Network Specifications for UCSB's Simple-\n         \
    \ Minded File System' [26 April 71, RFC 122,\n          NIC 5834].\n     Revisions\
    \ are as follows:\n     (1)  As far as can be determined, no Network site has\n\
    \          written code to interface to the UCSB software\n          documented\
    \ in RFC 74 last October.  Accordingly,\n          UCSB has terminated support\
    \ for that software,\n          and hence RFC 74 is obsolete.\n     (2)  In accordance\
    \ with subsequent Host-Host protocol\n          changes, the notion of 'message\
    \ type' has been\n          dropped from the specifications for RJE and RJOR,\n\
    \          RFC 105.  RJE/RJOR no longer send, nor expect to\n          receive\
    \ 8 bits of zeros as the first byte trans-\n          mitted over a connection.\n\
    \     (3)  In accordance with Document 2, RJE and RJOR now\n          employ a\
    \ standard ICP to create a full duplex\n          connection to the user.  Accordingly,\
    \ RJE and\n          RJOR listen on sockets x'201' and x'301',\n          respectively\
    \ (rather than on x'200' and x'300'\n          as before).  As documented in RFC\
    \ 105, RJE\n          required only a simplex connection to the user.\n      \
    \    A full duplex connection is now supported, but\n          no data is transmitted\
    \ to the user over the\n          added simplex connection.  RJOR now also supports\n\
    \          a full duplex connection.  However, if RJOR is\n          required\
    \ to call the user back when a requested\n          job's output is ready, it\
    \ still does so employing\n          a simplex connection to the user's receive\
    \ socket.\n     (4)  RJE/RJOR and SMFS specify a byte size of\n          eight\
    \ for their connection to the user's\n          receive socket.  The user may\
    \ choose the\n          byte size for the other simplex connection\n         \
    \ to suit himself;  any valid byte size is\n          acceptable to UCSB.\n  \
