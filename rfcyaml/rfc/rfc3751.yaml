    \ and\n   elsewhere over the past few years to use the Internet to actively\n\
    \   interfere with allegedly illegal activities of Internet users.  This\n   memo\

    \ that could be used to enable such efforts.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In a June 17, 2003 U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing,\
    \ entitled\n   \"The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security\n\
    \   Risks Compromise the Potential of Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing\n   Networks?,\"\
    \ U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the chair of the\n   committee, said he was\
    \ interested in the ability to destroy the\n   computers of people who illegally\
    \ download copyrighted material.  He\n   said this \"may be the only way you can\
    \ teach somebody about\n   copyrights.\"  \"If we can find some way to do this\
    \ without destroying\n   their machines, we'd be interested in hearing about that,\"\
    \ Mr Hatch\n   was quoted as saying during a Senate hearing.  He went on to say\
    \ \"If\n   that's the only way, then I'm all for destroying their machines.\"\n\
    \   [Guardian]\n   Mr. Hatch was not the first U.S. elected official to propose\n\
    \   something along this line.  A year earlier, representatives, Howard\n   Berman\
    \ (D-Calif.) and Howard Coble (R-N.C.), introduced a bill that\n   would have\
    \ immunized groups such as the Motion Picture Association of\n   America (MPAA)\
    \ and the Recording Industry Association of America\n   (RIAA) from all state\
    \ and federal laws if they disable, block, or\n   otherwise impair a \"publicly\
    \ accessible peer-to-peer file-trading\n   network.\"\n   The attitude of some\
    \ of the copyright holders may be that it's OK for\n   a few honest people to\
    \ have their computers or networks executed as\n   long as the machines and networks\
    \ of the dishonest are killed.  But\n   it is not likely that any measurable error\
    \ rate would be acceptable\n   to the public.  Clearly, anyone implementing laws\
    \ of this type need\n   some way to reduce the error rate and be sure that they\
    \ are dealing\n   with a real bad guy and not an innocent bystander.\n   Part\
    \ of determining if someone is a \"bad guy\" is determining his or\n   her intent.\
    \  Historically, western jurisprudence has required that\n   prosecutors show\
    \ that a person intended to commit a crime before that\n   person could be convicted\
    \ of committing that crime.  [Holdsworth,\n   Restatement, Prosser, United States\
    \ v. Wise, Garratt v. Dailey]\n   Because it can be quite difficult to establish\
    \ a person's intent\n   lawmakers have, in some cases, reduced the requirement\
    \ for\n   prosecutors to establish intent and mere possession is now proof\n \
    \  enough of intent.\n   This memo proposes a set of requirements for a new protocol\
    \ to be\n   used by prosecutors to determine a person's intent, thus reducing\
    \ the\n   need to dilute the historical legal requirement to show intent and by\n\
    \   groups such as the MPAA and RIAA to be sure they are dealing with\n   lawbreakers\
    \ and not 60 year old non computer users.\n"

  - "2.  Omniscience Protocol Requirements\n   For the purpose of these requirements,\
    \ I will assume that the OP is\n   implemented using a client-server model, where\
    \ the OP client is\n   installed on the user's computer and the server is installed\
    \ on a\n   computer run by a law or copyright enforcement organization.  OP\n\
    \   Clients would register with all OP Servers that pertain to the legal\n   jurisdiction\
    \ in which the client is located each time the computer is\n   started.  OP Servers\
    \ would then, on whatever schedule they have been\n   configured to use, send\
    \ OP Queries to OP Clients to find out if the\n   computer operator has engaged\
    \ in an illegal act of interest to the\n   operator of the OP Server.  Future\
    \ versions of the OP might operate\n   using a peer-to-peer model if the copyright\
    \ enforcement people can\n   ever get over their visceral disgust at the very\
    \ concept of peer-to-\n   peer networks.\n   For the purpose of this memo, I will\
    \ use copyright infringement as an\n   example of an illegal act that the OP protocol\
    \ could be used to\n   expose.  The OP has numerous possible applications beyond\
    \ ferreting\n   out copyright infringement.  For example, the OP would be of great\n\
    \   assistance to instructors trying to determine if their students are\n   producing\
    \ original work or engaging in plagiarism.  The same function\n   would be invaluable\
    \ to newspaper editors checking up on reporter's\n   dispatches.\n   Also for\
    \ the purpose of this memo, I assume that an evil-doer (also\n   referred to as\
    \ a miscreant) is in full control of a computer and that\n   OP Servers will generally\
    \ be operated by \"Good guys.\"  (See\n   Functional Requirements FR5-7 for requirements\
    \ to ensure that the\n   latter is the case.)  In the context of this memo, \"\
    evil-doer\" and\n   \"miscreant\" are defined as individuals or groups of individuals\
    \ who\n   perform acts that the operator of an OP Server has a legally\n   recognized\
    \ right to prevent.  In the context of this memo, \"good\n   guys\" refers to\
    \ individuals or groups of individuals who have a\n   legally recognized right\
    \ to prevent certain acts that computer users\n   may attempt to do with their\
    \ computers.  The use of this term is not\n   meant to convey any value judgment\
    \ of the morality, forward thinking\n   nature, public spiritedness, or the monetary\
    \ worth relative to most\n   of humanity of such individuals or groups of individuals.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Operational Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Operational Requirements\n   OR1: The OP client must be able to install\
    \ itself into all types of\n        computers over the objections of the computer\
    \ user.\n        Discussion: The OP client would be installed by legal mandate\
    \ in\n        all new computers, but since there are hundreds of millions of\n\
    \        existing computers, the OP client must be able to install itself\n  \
    \      in all of these existing computers in order to afford universal\n     \
    \   coverage of all possible miscreants.  This installation must be\n        accomplished\
    \ even if the user, many of whom have full\n        administrative control over\
    \ their computers, tries to prevent\n        it.\n   OR2: True OP clients must\
    \ not be findable by the computer user by any\n        means, including commercial\
    \ virus detectors, but all hackers'\n        programs that mimic OP clients must\
    \ be easily findable by\n        commercial virus detectors.\n        Discussion:\
    \ Since anyone whose intent was to violate the law\n        would not want the\
    \ OP client to be watching their action, they\n        would try to disable the\
    \ OP client.  Thus the OP Client, once\n        installed, should be invisible\
    \ to all methods a user might\n        employ to discover it.  Users must be able\
    \ to find and remove\n        any virus or worm that tries to masquerade as an\
    \ OP client to\n        escape detection.\n   OR3: The OP must be able to communicate\
    \ through uncooperative\n        firewalls, NATs, and when the computer is disconnected\
    \ from the\n        Internet.\n        Discussion: Since the evil-doer may have\
    \ control of a local\n        firewall or NAT, the OP must be able to communicate\
    \ with the OP\n        server, even when the firewall or NAT has been configured\
    \ to\n        block all unused ports.  Also, since the evil-doer might try to\n\
    \        hide his or her evil-doing by disconnecting the computer from\n     \
    \   the network, the OP must be able to continue to communicate,\n        even\
    \ under these circumstances.  Meeting this requirement may\n        require that\
    \ the OP client be able to reconfigure the user's\n        machine into a cell\
    \ phone or to implement GMPLS-WH [GMPLS-WH].\n   OR4: Neither the operation of\
    \ the OP client or the OP server must be\n        able to be spoofed.\n      \
    \  Discussion: The user must not be able to create their own\n        version\
    \ of an OP client that can fool the OP server.  Nor can it\n        be possible\
    \ for someone to create their own OP server that can\n        be used to query\
    \ OP clients.\n        Discussion: Because of the potential for a user to hide\
    \ their\n        illicit activities by mimicking the operation of the OP client\n\
    \        on their machine, it must not be possible to do so.  In the same\n  \
    \      vein, because of the potential for violating the user's privacy,\n    \
    \    it must not be possible for a non-authorized OP server to be\n        seen\
    \ as authorized by OP clients.  Since there will be an\n        arbitrary, and\
    \ changing, number of OP servers, at least one for\n        each type of protected\
    \ material, OP authentication and\n        authorization must be able to be accomplished\
    \ with no prior\n        knowledge of a particular OP server by the OP client.\n\
    \   OR5: The OP client must be able to be installed on any portable\n        device\
    \ that can be used to play protected material or execute\n        protected software.\n\
    \        Discussion:  Since small, portable devices, such as MP3 players,\n  \
    \      are becoming the preferred method of playing back prerecorded\n       \
    \ music and videos, they must all include OP clients.  OP clients\n        must\
    \ be able to be automatically installed on all such existing\n        devices.\n"

  - "2.2.  Functional Requirements\n   FR1: The OP client must be able to determine\
    \ the user's intent.\n        Discussion: Just knowing that the user has a copy\
    \ of a protected\n        work on their system does not, by itself, mean that\
    \ the copy is\n        illegal.  It could easily be a copy that the user purchased.\n\
    \        The OP must be able to tell if a copy is an illegal copy with\n     \
    \   complete reliability.  The OP must be able to differentiate\n        between\
    \ an original, and legal, copy and a bit-for-bit illegal\n        reproduction.\
    \  The OP client must be able to differentiate\n        between copies that were\
    \ created for the purpose of backup, and\n        are thus generally legal, and\
    \ those copies created for the\n        purpose of illegal distribution.  In the\
    \ case of some types of\n        software, the OP client must be able to determine\
    \ the intent of\n        the user for the software.  An example of this need is\
    \ related\n        to the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and similar\n\
    \        laws around the world.  These laws outlaw the possession of\n       \
    \ circumvention technology, such as crypto analysis software, in\n        most\
    \ cases.  Some exemption is made for legitimate researchers,\n        but without\
    \ an OP it is quite hard to determine if the\n        circumvention technology\
    \ is to be used for research or to break\n        copyright protections for the\
    \ purpose of making illegal copies\n        of protected material.  With the OP,\
    \ the DMCA, and laws like it,\n        can be rewritten so that circumvention\
    \ technology is legal and\n        developers can find out if their security protocols\
    \ are any\n        good, something which may be illegal under current law.\n \
    \  FR2: The OP client must be able to remotely differentiate between\n       \
    \ illegal material and other material with the same file name.\n        Discussion:\
    \ A user might create a file that has the same\n        filename as that of a\
    \ protected work.  The OP must not be fooled\n        into thinking that the user's\
    \ file is a protected one.\n   FR3: The OP client must be able to find illegal\
    \ copies, even if the\n        filename has been changed.\n        Discussion:\
    \ The user must not be able to disguise a protected\n        work by just changing\
    \ its name.\n   FR4: The OP client must be able to find illegal copies, even if\
    \ the\n        user has modified the work in some way.\n        Discussion: The\
    \ user must not be able to disguise a protected\n        work by modifying the\
    \ work, for example, by prepending,\n        appending, or inserting extra material,\
    \ or by changing some of\n        the protected work.  The OP must be able to\
    \ make a legal\n        determination that a modified work is no longer legally\
    \ the same\n        as the original if the amount and type of modification exceed\
    \ a\n        subjective threshold.\n   FR5: The OP client must not be able to\
    \ be run by a hacker, and the OP\n        interface into a user's computer must\
    \ not be able to be\n        exploited by a hacker.\n        Discussion: OP clients\
    \ will be attractive targets for hackers\n        since they will have full access\
    \ within a user's computer.  The\n        interface between the OP client and\
    \ server must be secure\n        against all possible hacking attacks.\n   FR6:\
    \ The OP client must be able to discern the motives of the\n        operator of\
    \ the OP server and not run if those motives are not\n        pure.\n        Discussion:\
    \ Since it cannot be assumed that the operators of the\n        OP server will\
    \ always have the best motives, the OP client must\n        be able to reject\
    \ requests from the OP server if the operator of\n        the server has an evil\
    \ (or illegal) intent.  For example, the OP\n        client must block any operation\
    \ that might stem from a vendetta\n        that the OP server operator might have\
    \ against the user.\n   FR7: The OP client must not be able to be used to extract\
    \ information\n        from a user's computer that is unrelated to illegal copies.\n\
    \        In order to minimize the threat to the privacy of the user, the\n   \
    \     OP client must not be able to be used to extract information\n        from\
    \ the user's computer that is not germane to determining if\n        the user\
    \ has illegal copies of works or intends to use protected\n        works in illegal\
    \ ways.\n   FR8: The OP client must be able to differentiate between protected\n\
    \        material that was placed on the user's computer by the user and\n   \
    \     any material placed by others.\n        Discussion: It must not be possible\
    \ for a third party to put\n        protected material on a user's computer for\
    \ the purpose of\n        incriminating the user.  The OP client must be able\
    \ to know,\n        with certainty, who placed material on each computer, even\
    \ in\n        the cases where a third party has physical access to an\n      \
    \  unprotected computer or when the third party knows the user's\n        logname\
    \ and password.\n   FR9: The OP client must only implement the laws that apply\
    \ to the\n        specific computer that it is running on.\n        Discussion:\
    \ Since the Internet crosses many legal boundaries, an\n        OP client will\
    \ have to know just where, in geo-political space,\n        the computer it is\
    \ running in is currently located in order to\n        know what set of laws to\
    \ apply when it is scanning the user's\n        computer.  The OP client must\
    \ also be able to be automatically\n        updated if the laws change or the\
    \ computer is moved to a\n        location where the laws are different.  Note\
    \ that this\n        requirement also implies that the OP client knows where its\
    \ OP\n        server is located to know if the client and server are both in\n\
    \        the same legal jurisdiction.  The OP client must know what to\n     \
    \   do, or not do, when they are not in the same legal jurisdiction.\n       \
    \ The OP client must also include a mechanism to automatically\n        retrieve\
    \ any applicable new laws or court decisions and properly\n        interpret them.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The OP requires strong authentication of the\
    \ clients and servers to\n   ensure that they cannot be spoofed.  It also requires\
    \ the use of\n   strong integrity technology to ensure that the messages between\
    \ the\n   client and server cannot be modified in flight.  It also requires\n\
    \   strong encryption to be sure that the communication between the\n   client\
    \ and the server cannot be observed.  All of this is required in\n   an environment\
    \ where many of the users are in full control of their\n   computers and will\
    \ be actively hostile to the reliable operation of\n   the protocol.  Good luck.\n"
