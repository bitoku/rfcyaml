  - "                          NETWORK HOST STATUS\n   This RFC reports on the status\
    \ of most Network Hosts from February 28\n   to March 10.  The ETAC Terminal IMP\
    \ (Network address 148) was\n   installed during this period.\n   Several Hosts\
    \ are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These\n   Hosts fall into two\
    \ categories:\n      1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the\
    \ Network\n         as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular\n\
    \         basis for at least two weeks.  Included here are:\n         Network\n\
    \         Address          Site            Computer\n         134            \
    \  MIT-AI          PDP-10\n          13              Case            PDP-10\n\
    \          15              Ames/(Paoli)    ILLIAC/(B6500)\n      2) Hosts which\
    \ are currently intended to be users only.  Included\n         here are the Terminal\
    \ IMP's which are presently in the Network\n         (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN).\
    \  [The BBN Terminal IMP (Network\n         Address 158) is a prototype and as\
    \ such is frequently not\n         connected to the Network, but being used to\
    \ refine and debug\n         the Terminal IMP programs.]  This category also includes\
    \ the\n         Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is\n\
    \         used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.\n         Finally,\
    \ included among these Hosts are the following:\n         Network\n         Address\
    \          Site            Computer\n          7               Rand          \

    \   PDP-11\n   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for\
    \ this\n   period.\n                                                         \
