  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines requirements for the Intrusion Detection\n\
    \   Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) [5], a product of the Intrusion\n   Detection\
    \ Exchange Format Working Group (IDWG).  IDMEF was planned to\n   be a standard\
    \ format that automated Intrusion Detection Systems\n   (IDSs) [4] could use for\
    \ reporting what they have deemed to be\n   suspicious or of interest.  This document\
    \ also specifies requirements\n   for a communication protocol for communicating\
    \ IDMEF.  As chartered,\n   IDWG has the responsibility to first evaluate existing\
    \ communication\n   protocols before choosing to specify a new one.  Thus the\n\
    \   requirements in this document can be used to evaluate existing\n   communication\
    \ protocols.  If IDWG determines that a new communication\n   protocol is necessary,\
    \ the requirements in this document can be used\n   to evaluate proposed solutions.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   This is not an IETF standards-track\
    \ document [2], and thus the key\n   words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, and MAY are\
    \ NOT as in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n   [1], but rather:\n   o  MUST: This word, or the\
    \ terms REQUIRED or SHALL, means that the\n      described behavior or characteristic\
    \ is an absolute requirement\n      for a proposed IDWG specification.\n   o \
    \ MUST NOT: This phrase, or the phrase SHALL NOT, means that the\n      described\
    \ behavior or characteristic is an absolute prohibition of\n      a proposed IDWG\
    \ specification.\n   o  SHOULD: This word, or the adjective RECOMMENDED, means\
    \ that there\n      may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances for a\
    \ proposed\n      IDWG specification to ignore described behavior or\n      characteristics.\n\
    \   o  MAY: This word, or the adjective OPTIONAL, means that the\n      described\
    \ behavior or characteristic is truly optional for a\n      proposed IDWG specification.\
    \  One proposed specification may\n      choose to include the described behavior\
    \ or characteristic,\n      whereas another proposed specification may omit the\
    \ same behavior\n      or characteristic.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Rationale for IDMEF
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Rationale for IDMEF\n   The reasons such a format should be useful are\
    \ as follows:\n   1. A number of commercial and free Intrusion Detection Systems\
    \ are\n      available and more are becoming available all the time.  Some\n \
    \     products are aimed at detecting intrusions on the network, others\n    \
    \  are aimed at host operating systems, while still others are aimed\n      at\
    \ applications.  Even within a given category, the products have\n      very different\
    \ strengths and weaknesses.  Hence it is likely that\n      users will deploy\
    \ more than a single product, and users will want\n      to observe the output\
    \ of these products from one or more\n      manager(s).  A standard format for\
    \ reporting will simplify this\n      task greatly.\n   2. Intrusions frequently\
    \ involve multiple organizations as victims,\n      or multiple sites within the\
    \ same organization.  Typically, those\n      sites will use different IDSs. \
    \ It would be very helpful to\n      correlate such distributed intrusions across\
    \ multiple sites and\n      administrative domains.  Having reports from all sites\
    \ in a common\n      format would facilitate this task.\n   3. The existence of\
    \ a common format should allow components from\n      different IDSs to be integrated\
    \ more readily.  Thus, Intrusion\n      Detection (ID) research should migrate\
    \ into commercial products\n      more easily.\n   4. In addition to enabling\
    \ communication from an ID analyzer to an ID\n      manager, the IDMEF notification\
    \ system may also enable\n      communication between a variety of IDS components.\
    \  However, for\n      the remainder of this document, we refer to the communication\
    \ as\n      going from an analyzer to a manager.\n   All of these reasons suggest\
    \ that a common format for reporting\n   anything deemed suspicious should help\
    \ the IDS market to grow and\n   innovate more successfully, and should result\
    \ in IDS users obtaining\n   better results from deployment of ID systems.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Intrusion Detection Terms
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Intrusion Detection Terms\n   In order to make the rest of the requirements\
    \ clearer, we define some\n   terms about typical IDSs.  These terms are presented\
    \ in alphabetical\n   order.  The diagram at the end of this section illustrates\
    \ the\n   relationships of some of the terms defined herein.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Activity
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Activity\n   Elements of the data source or occurrences within the data\
    \ source\n   that are identified by the sensor or analyzer as being of interest\
    \ to\n   the operator.  Examples of this include (but are not limited to)\n  \
    \ network session showing unexpected telnet activity, operating system\n   log\
    \ file entries showing a user attempting to access files to which\n   he is not\
    \ authorized to have access, application log files showing\n   persistent login\
    \ failures, etc.\n   Activity can range from extremely serious occurrences (such\
    \ as an\n   unequivocally malicious attack) to less serious occurrences (such\
    \ as\n   unusual user activity that's worth a further look) to neutral\n   activity\
    \ (such as user login).\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Administrator
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Administrator\n   The human with overall responsibility for setting the\
    \ security policy\n   of the organization, and, thus, for decisions about deploying\
    \ and\n   configuring the IDS.  This may or may not be the same person as the\n\
    \   operator of the IDS.  In some organizations, the administrator is\n   associated\
    \ with the network or systems administration groups.  In\n   other organizations,\
    \ it's an independent position.\n"
- title: 2.2.3.  Alert
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  Alert\n   A message from an analyzer to a manager that an event of interest\
    \ has\n   been detected.  An alert typically contains information about the\n\
    \   unusual activity that was detected, as well as the specifics of the\n   occurrence.\n"
- title: 2.2.4.  Analyzer
  contents:
  - "2.2.4.  Analyzer\n   The ID component or process that analyzes the data collected\
    \ by the\n   sensor for signs of unauthorized or undesired activity or for events\n\
    \   that might be of interest to the security administrator.  In many\n   existing\
    \ IDSs, the sensor and the analyzer are part of the same\n   component.  In this\
    \ document, the term analyzer is used generically\n   to refer to the sender of\
    \ the IDMEF message.\n"
- title: 2.2.5.  Data Source
  contents:
  - "2.2.5.  Data Source\n   The raw information that an intrusion detection system\
    \ uses to detect\n   unauthorized or undesired activity.  Common data sources\
    \ include (but\n   are not limited to) raw network packets, operating system audit\
    \ logs,\n   application audit logs, and system-generated checksum data.\n"
- title: 2.2.6.  Event
  contents:
  - "2.2.6.  Event\n   The occurrence in the data source that is detected by the sensor\
    \ and\n   that may result in an IDMEF alert being transmitted, for example,\n\
    \   attack.\n"
- title: 2.2.7.  IDS
  contents:
  - "2.2.7.  IDS\n   Intrusion detection system.  Some combination of one or more\
    \ of the\n   following components: sensor, analyzer, manager.\n"
- title: 2.2.8.  Manager
  contents:
  - "2.2.8.  Manager\n   The ID component or process from which the operator manages\
    \ the\n   various components of the ID system.  Management functions typically\n\
    \   include (but are not limited to) sensor configuration, analyzer\n   configuration,\
    \ event notification management, data consolidation, and\n   reporting.\n"
- title: 2.2.9.  Notification
  contents:
  - "2.2.9.  Notification\n   The method by which the IDS manager makes the operator\
    \ aware of the\n   alert occurrence and thus the event.  In many IDSs, this is\
    \ done via\n   the display of a colored icon on the IDS manager screen, the\n\
    \   transmission of an e-mail or pager message, or the transmission of a\n   Simple\
    \ Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap, although other\n   notification techniques\
    \ are also used.\n"
- title: 2.2.10.  Operator
  contents:
  - "2.2.10.  Operator\n   The human that is the primary user of the IDS manager.\
    \  The operator\n   often monitors the output of the ID system and initiates or\n\
    \   recommends further action.\n"
- title: 2.2.11.  Response
  contents:
  - "2.2.11.  Response\n   The actions taken in response to an event.  Responses may\
    \ be\n   undertaken automatically by some entity in the IDS architecture or\n\
    \   may be initiated by a human.  Sending a notification to the operator\n   is\
    \ a very common response.  Other responses include (but are not\n   limited to)\
    \ logging the activity; recording the raw data (from the\n   data source) that\
    \ characterized the event; terminating a network,\n   user, or application session;\
    \ or altering network or system access\n   controls.\n"
- title: 2.2.12.  Sensor
  contents:
  - "2.2.12.  Sensor\n   The ID component that collects data from the data source.\
    \  The\n   frequency of data collection will vary across IDS offerings.  The\n\
    \   sensor is set up to forward events to the analyzer.\n"
- title: 2.2.13.  Signature
  contents:
  - "2.2.13.  Signature\n   A rule used by the analyzer to identify interesting activity\
    \ to the\n   security administrator.  Signatures represent one of the mechanisms\n\
    \   (though not necessarily the only mechanism) by which IDSs detect\n   intrusions.\n"
- title: 2.2.14.  Security Policy
  contents:
  - "2.2.14.  Security Policy\n   The predefined, formally documented statement that\
    \ defines what\n   activities are allowed to take place on an organization's network\

- title: 2.3.  Architectural Assumptions
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Architectural Assumptions\n   In this document, as defined in the terms\
    \ above, we assume that an\n   analyzer determines somehow that a suspicious event\
    \ has been seen by\n   a sensor, and sends an alert to a manager.  The format\
    \ of that alert\n   and the method of communicating it are what IDMEF proposes\
    \ to\n   standardize.\n   For the purposes of this document, we assume that the\
    \ analyzer and\n   manager are separate components and that they are communicating\n\
    \   pairwise across a TCP/IP network.  No other form of communication\n   between\
    \ these entities is contemplated in this document, and no other\n   use of IDMEF\
    \ alerts is considered.  We refer to the communication\n   protocol that communicates\
    \ IDMEF as the IDMEF Communication Protocol\n   (IDP).\n   The Trust Model is\
    \ not specified as a requirement, but is rather left\n   to the choice of the\
    \ IDMEF Communication Protocol, i.e., a design\n   decision.  What is specified\
    \ are individual security-related\n   requirements; see Section 5.\n   We try\
    \ to make no further architectural assumptions than those just\n   stated.  For\
    \ example, the following points should not matter:\n   o  Whether the sensor and\
    \ the analyzer are integrated or separate.\n   o  Whether the analyzer and manager\
    \ are isolated or are embedded in\n      some large hierarchy or distributed mesh\
    \ of components.\n   o  Whether the manager actually notifies a human, takes action\n\
    \      automatically, or just analyzes incoming alerts and correlates\n      them.\n\
    \   o  Whether a component might act as an analyzer with respect to one\n    \
    \  component, while also acting as a manager with respect to another.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Organization of This Document
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Organization of This Document\n   Besides this requirements document, the\
    \ IDWG should produce two other\n   documents.  The first should describe a data\
    \ format or language for\n   exchanging information about suspicious events. \
    \ In this, the\n   requirements document, we refer to that document as the \"\
    data-format\n   specification\".  The second document to be produced should identify\n\
    \   existing IETF protocols that are best used for conveying the data so\n   formatted,\
    \ and explain how to package this data in those existing\n   formats or the document\
    \ should specify a new protocol.  We refer to\n   this as the IDP (IDMEF Communication\
    \ Protocol).\n   Accordingly, the requirements here are partitioned into four\n\
    \   sections:\n   o  The first of these contains general requirements that apply\
    \ to all\n      aspects of the IDMEF specification (Section 3).\n   o  The second\
    \ section describes requirements on the formatting of\n      IDMEF messages (Section\
    \ 4).\n   o  The third section outlines requirements on the communications\n \
    \     mechanism, IDP, used to move IDMEF messages from the analyzer to\n     \
    \ the manager (Section 5).\n   o  The final section contains requirements on the\
    \ content and\n      semantics of the IDMEF messages (Section 6).\n   For each\
    \ requirement, we attempt to state the requirement as clearly\n   as possible\
    \ without imposing an idea of what a design solution should\n   be.  Then we give\
    \ the rationale for why this requirement is\n   important, and state whether this\
    \ should be an essential feature of\n   the specification or is beneficial but\
    \ could be lacking if it is\n   difficult to fulfill.  Finally, where it seems\
    \ necessary, we give an\n   illustrative scenario.  In some cases, we include\
    \ possible design\n   solutions in the scenario.  These are purely illustrative.\n"

    \ determine that all were reported near the same \"time\" and that they\n   are\
    \ part of the same attack.\n"
- title: 6.15.  Time Format
  contents:
  - "6.15.  Time Format\n   The format for reporting the date MUST be compliant with\
    \ all current\n   standards for Year 2000 rollover, and it MUST have sufficient\n\
    \   capability to continue reporting date values past the year 2038.\n"
- title: 6.15.1.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "6.15.1.  Rationale\n   It is desirable that the IDMEF have a long lifetime and\
    \ that\n   implementations be suitable for use in a variety of environments.\n\
    \   Therefore, characteristics that limit the lifespan of the IDMEF (such\n  \
    \ as 2038 date representation limitation) MUST be avoided.\n"
- title: 6.16.  Time Granularity and Accuracy
  contents:
  - "6.16.  Time Granularity and Accuracy\n   Time granularity and time accuracy in\
    \ event messages SHALL NOT be\n   specified by the IDMEF.\n"
- title: 6.16.1.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "6.16.1.  Rationale\n   The IDMEF cannot assume a certain clock granularity on\
    \ sensing\n   elements, and so cannot impose any requirements on the granularity\
    \ of\n   the event timestamps.  Nor can the IDMEF assume that the clocks being\n\
    \   used to timestamp the events have a specified accuracy.\n"
- title: 6.17.  Message Extensions
  contents:
  - "6.17.  Message Extensions\n   The IDMEF message MUST support an extension mechanism\
    \ used by\n   implementors to define implementation-specific data.  The use of\
    \ this\n   mechanism by the implementor is OPTIONAL.  This data contains\n   implementation-specific\
    \ information determined by each implementor.\n   The implementor MUST indicate\
    \ how to interpret these extensions,\n   although there are no specific requirements\
    \ placed on how\n   implementors describe their implementation-specific extensions.\
    \  The\n   lack or presence of such message extensions for implementation-\n \
    \  specific data MUST NOT break interoperation.\n"
- title: 6.17.1.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "6.17.1.  Rationale\n   Implementors might wish to supply extra data such as the\
    \ version\n   number of their product or other data that they believe provides\n\
    \   value added due to the specific nature of their product.\n   Implementors\
    \ may publish a document or web site describing their\n   extensions; they might\
    \ also use an in-band extension mechanism that\n   is self-describing.  Such extensions\
    \ are not a license to break the\n   interoperation of IDMEF messages.\n"
- title: 6.18.  Message Semantics
  contents:
  - "6.18.  Message Semantics\n   The semantics of the IDMEF message MUST be well\
    \ defined.\n"
- title: 6.18.1.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "6.18.1.  Rationale\n   Good semantics are key to understanding what the message\
    \ is trying to\n   convey so there are no errors.  Operators will decide what\
    \ action to\n   take based on these messages, so it is important that they can\n\
    \   interpret them correctly.\n"
- title: 6.18.2.  Scenario
  contents:
  - "6.18.2.  Scenario\n   Without this requirement, the operator receives an IDMEF\
    \ message and\n   interprets it one way.  The implementor who constructed the\
    \ message\n   intended it to have a different meaning from the operator's\n  \
    \ interpretation.  The resulting corrective action is therefore\n   incorrect.\n"
- title: 6.19.  Message Extensibility
  contents:
  - "6.19.  Message Extensibility\n   The IDMEF itself MUST be extensible.  As new\
    \ ID technologies emerge\n   and as new information about events becomes available,\
    \ the IDMEF\n   message format MUST be able to include this new information. \
    \ Such\n   message extensibility must occur in such a manner that\n   interoperability\
    \ is NOT impacted.\n"
- title: 6.19.1.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "6.19.1.  Rationale\n   As intrusion detection technology continues to evolve,\
    \ it is likely\n   that additional information relating to detected events will\
    \ become\n   available.  The IDMEF message format MUST be able to be extended\
    \ by a\n   specific implementation to encompass this new information.  Such\n\
    \   extensions are not a license to break the interoperation of IDMEF\n   messages.\n"
