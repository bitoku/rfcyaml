  - "1.  Introduction\n   Pseudowire signaling requires that the Pseudowire Type (PW
    Type) be\n   identical in both directions.  For certain applications the\n   configuration
    of the PW Type is most easily accomplished by\n   configuring this information
    at just one PW endpoint.  In any form of\n   LDP-based signaling, each PW endpoint
    must initiate the creation of a\n   unidirectional LSP.\n   By the procedures
    of [CONTROL], both Label Mapping messages must\n   carry the PW type, and the
    two unidirectional mapping messages must\n   be in agreement.  Thus within the
    current procedures, the PW endpoint\n   that lacks configuration must wait to
    receive a Label Mapping message\n   in order to learn the PW Type, prior to signaling
    its unidirectional\n   LSP.\n   For certain applications this can become particularly
    onerous.  For\n   example, suppose that an ingress Provider Edge (PE) is serving
    as\n   part of a gateway function between a layer 2 network and layer 2\n   attachment
    circuits on remote PEs.  Suppose further that the initial\n   setup needs to be
    initiated from the layer 2 network, but the layer 2\n   signaling does not contain
    sufficient information to determine the PW\n   Type.  However, this information
    is known at the PE supporting the\n   targeted attachment circuit.\n   In this
    situation, it is often desirable to allow the initiation of\n   the two LSPs that
    compose a pseudowire to remain independent.  A\n   means is needed for allowing
    a PW endpoint (lacking a priori\n   knowledge of the PW Type) to initiate the
    creation of an LSP.  This\n   document defines a wildcard PW Type to satisfy this
    need.\n"

  - "2.  Wildcard PW Type\n   In order to allow a PE to initiate the signaling exchange
    for a\n   pseudowire without knowing the pseudowire type, a new PW Type is\n   defined.
    \ The codepoint is 0x7FFF.  The semantics are the following:\n   1.  To the targeted
    PE, this value indicates that it is to determine\n       the PW Type (for both
    directions) and signal that in a Label\n       Mapping message back to the initiating
    PE.\n   2.  For the procedures of [CONTROL], this PW Type is interpreted to\n
    \      match any PW Type other than itself.  That is, the targeted PE\n       may
    respond with any valid PW Type other than the wildcard PW\n       Type.\n"

    - "3.1.  Procedures When Sending the Wildcard FEC\n   When a PE that is not configured
      to use a specific PW Type for a\n   particular pseudowire wishes to signal an
      LSP for that pseudowire, it\n   sets the PW Type to \"wildcard\".  This indicates
      that the target PE\n   should determine the PW Type for this pseudowire.\n   When
      a Label Mapping message is received for the pseudowire, the PE\n   checks the
      PW Type.\n   If the PW Type can be supported, the PE uses this as the PW Type
      for\n   both directions.\n   If the PW Type cannot be supported or is \"wildcard\",
      it MUST respond\n   to this message with a Label Release message with an LDP
      Status Code\n   of \"Generic Misconfiguration Error\".  Further actions are
      beyond the\n   scope of this document, but could include notifying the associated\n
      \  application (if any) or notifying network management.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Procedures When Receiving the Wildcard FEC\n   When a targeted PE receives
      a Label Mapping message indicating the\n   wildcard PW Type, it follows the
      normal procedures for checking the\n   Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) and
      Target Attachment Individual\n   Identifier (TAII) values.  If the targeted
      PE is not configured to\n   use a specific, non-wildcard PW Type, it MUST respond
      to this message\n   with a Label Release message with an LDP Status Code of
      \"Generic\n   Misconfiguration Error\".\n   Otherwise, it treats the Label Mapping
      message as if it had indicated\n   the PW Type it is configured to use.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document has little impact on the security
    aspects of [CONTROL].\n   The message exchanges remain the same.  However, a malicious
    agent\n   attempting to connect to an access circuit would require one less\n
    \  piece of information.  To mitigate against this, a pseudowire control\n   entity
    receiving a request containing the wildcard FEC type SHOULD\n   only proceed with
    setup if explicitly configured to do so for the\n   particular AI in the TAI.
    \ Further, the reader should note the\n   security considerations of [CONTROL],
    in general, and those\n   pertaining to the Generalized PWid FEC Element, in particular.\n"
