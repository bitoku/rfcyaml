- title: 1.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n    o   An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2271 [1].\n    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n\
    \        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The\n  \
    \      second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC\n     \
    \   1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].\n    o   Message protocols for transferring management\
    \ information. The\n        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called\
    \ SNMPv1 and\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the\
    \ SNMP\n        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n \
    \       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and\n      \
    \  RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is\n        called\
    \ SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and\n        RFC 2274 [12].\n\
    \    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The\n     \
    \   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n        described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol\n        operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n        [13].\n    o   A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and\n        the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2275\n        [15].  Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information\n        store, termed the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  Objects\n        in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined\
    \ in the SMI.\n        This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the\
    \ SMIv2.\n        A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the\n\
    \        appropriate translations. The resulting translated MIB must be\n    \
    \    semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are\n        omitted\
    \ because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).\n        Some machine\
    \ readable information in SMIv2 will be converted\n        into textual descriptions\
    \ in SMIv1 during the translation\n        process. However, this loss of machine\
    \ readable information is\n        not considered to change the semantics of the\
    \ MIB.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Changes from RFC1406\n   The changes from RFC1406 are the following:\n\
    \        (1)  The Fractional Table has been deprecated.\n        (2)  This document\
    \ uses SMIv2.\n        (3)  Usage is given for ifTable and ifXTable.\n       \
    \ (4)  Example usage of ifStackTable is included.\n        (5)  dsx1IfIndex has\
    \ been deprecated.\n        (6)  Support for DS2 and E2 have been added.\n   \
    \     (7)  Additional lineTypes for DS2, E2, and unframed E1\n             were\
    \ added.\n        (8)  The definition of valid intervals has been clarified\n\
    \             for the case where the agent proxied for other devices.  In\n  \
    \           particular, the treatment of missing intervals has been\n        \
    \     clarified.\n        (9)  An inward loopback has been added.\n        (10)\
    \ Additional lineStatus bits have been added for Near End in\n             Unavailable\
    \ Signal State, Carrier Equipment Out of Service,\n             DS2 Payload AIS,\
    \ and DS2 Performance Threshold.\n        (11) A read-write line Length object\
    \ has been added.\n        (12) Signal mode of other has been added.\n       \
    \ (13) Added a lineStatus last change, trap and enabler.\n        (14) The e1(19)\
    \ ifType has been obsoleted so this MIB\n             does not list it as a supported\
    \ ifType.\n        (15) Textual Conventions for statistics objects have been used.\n\
    \        (16) A new object, dsx1LoopbackStatus has been introduced to\n      \
    \       reflect the loopbacks established on a DS1 interface and\n           \
    \  the source to the requests.  dsx1LoopbackConfig continues\n             to\
    \ be the desired loopback state while dsx1LoopbackStatus\n             reflects\
    \ the actual state.\n        (17) A dual loopback has been added to allow the\
    \ setting of an\n             inward loopback and a line loopback at the same\
    \ time.\n        (18) An object indicating which channel to use within a parent\n\
    \             object (i.e. DS3) has been added.\n        (19) An object has been\
    \ added to indicate whether or not this\n             DS1/E1 is channelized.\n\
    \        (20) Line coding type of B6ZS has been added for DS2\n"
- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   These objects are used when the particular media being used\
    \ to\n   realize an interface is a DS1/E1/DS2/E2 interface.  At present, this\n\
    \   applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-\n   standard\
    \ MIB:\n        ds1 (18)\n   The definitions contained herein are based on the\
    \ AT&T T-1 Superframe\n   (a.k.a., D4) and Extended Superframe (ESF) formats [17,\
    \ 18], the\n   latter of which conforms to ANSI specifications [19], and the CCITT\n\
    \   Recommendations [20, 21], referred to as E1 for the rest of this\n   memo.\n\
    \   The various DS1 and E1 line disciplines are similar enough that\n   separate\
    \ MIBs are unwarranted, although there are some differences.\n   For example,\
    \ Loss of Frame is defined more rigorously in the ESF\n   specification than in\
    \ the D4 specification, but it is defined in\n   both.  Therefore,  interface\
    \ types e1(19) and g703at2mb(67) have been\n   obsoleted.\n   Where it is necessary\
    \ to distinguish between the flavors of E1 with\n   and without CRC, E1-CRC denotes\
    \ the \"with CRC\" form (G.704 Table 4b)\n   and E1-noCRC denotes the \"without\

- title: 2.2.1.  Usage of ifStackTable for Routers and DSUs
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Usage of ifStackTable for Routers and DSUs\n   The object dsx1IfIndex\
    \ has been deprecated.  This object previously\n   allowed a very special proxy\
    \ situation to exist for Routers and CSUs.\n   This section now describes how\
    \ to use ifStackTable to represent this\n   relationship.\n   The paragraphs discussing\
    \ dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex have been\n   preserved in Appendix A for informational\
    \ purposes.\n   The ifStackTable is used in the proxy case to represent the\n\
    \   association between pairs of interfaces, e.g. this T1 is attached to\n   that\
    \ T1.  This use is consistent with the use of the ifStackTable to\n   show the\
    \ association between various sub-layers of an interface.  In\n   both cases entire\
    \ PDUs are exchanged between the interface pairs - in\n   the case of a T1, entire\
    \ T1 frames are exchanged; in the case of PPP\n   and HDLC, entire HDLC frames\
    \ are exchanged.  This usage is not meant\n   to suggest the use of the ifStackTable\
    \ to represent Time Division\n   Multiplexing (TDM) connections in general.\n\
    \   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agent resides on a\n   host\
    \ external from the device supporting DS1 interfaces (e.g., a\n   router). The\
    \ Agent represents both the host and the DS1 device.\n   Example:\n   A shelf\
    \ full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on\n   the router\
    \ proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an\n   Ethernet interface:\n\

    \      InwardLoopback\n       DualLoopback (Line + Inward)\n       NoLoopback\n\
    \   The remote end can also request loopbacks either through the FDL\n   channel\
    \ if ESF or inband if D4.  The loopbacks that can be request\n   this way are:\n\
    \       LineLoopback\n       PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)\n       NoLoopback\n\
    \   To model the current state of loopbacks on a DS1 interface, the\n   object\

    \  This objects, which is a bitmap, will have bits\n   turned on which reflect\
    \ the currently active loopbacks on the\n   interface as well as the source of\
    \ those loopbacks.\n   The following restrictions/rules apply to loopbacks:\n\
    \   The far end cannot undo loopbacks set by a manager.\n   A manager can undo\
    \ loopbacks set by the far end.\n   Both a line loopback and an inward loopback\
    \ can be set at the same\n   time.  Only these two loopbacks can co-exist and\
    \ either one may be\n   set by the manager or the far end.  A LineLoopback request\
    \ from the\n   far end is incremental to an existing Inward loopback established\
    \ by\n   a manager.  When a NoLoopback is received from the far end in this\n\
    \   case, the InwardLoopback remains in place.\n"

    \ are not\n        Unavailable as described below.\n    Unavailable Seconds (UAS)\n\
    \        Unavailable Seconds (UAS) are calculated by counting the number\n   \
    \     of seconds that the interface is unavailable.  The DS1 interface\n     \
    \   is said to be unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous SESs,\n        or\
    \ the onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure\n        States).\
    \  If the condition leading to the failure was\n        immediately preceded by\
    \ one or more contiguous SESs, then the\n        DS1 interface unavailability\
    \ starts from the onset of these\n        SESs.  Once unavailable, and if no failure\
    \ is present, the DS1\n        interface becomes available at the onset of 10\
    \ contiguous\n        seconds with no SESs.  Once unavailable, and if a failure\
    \ is\n        present, the DS1 interface becomes available at the onset of 10\n\
    \        contiguous seconds with no SESs, if the failure clearing time is\n  \
    \      less than or equal to 10 seconds.  If the failure clearing time\n     \
    \   is more than 10 seconds, the DS1 interface becomes available at\n        the\
    \ onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs, or the onset\n        period leading\
    \ to the successful clearing condition, whichever\n        occurs later.  With\
    \ respect to the DS1 error counts, all\n        counters are incremented while\
    \ the DS1 interface is deemed\n        available.  While the interface is deemed\
    \ unavailable, the only\n        count that is incremented is UASs.\n        Note\
    \ that this definition implies that the agent cannot\n        determine until\
    \ after a ten second interval has passed whether a\n        given one-second interval\
    \ belongs to available or unavailable\n        time.  If the agent chooses to\
    \ update the various performance\n        statistics in real time then it must\
    \ be prepared to\n        retroactively reduce the ES, BES, SES, and SEFS counts\
    \ by 10 and\n        increase the UAS count by 10 when it determines that available\n\
    \        time has been entered.  It must also be prepared to adjust the\n    \
    \    PCV count and the DM count as necessary since these parameters\n        are\
    \ not accumulated during unavailable time.  It must be\n        similarly prepared\
    \ to retroactively decrease the UAS count by 10\n        and increase the ES,\
    \ BES, and DM counts as necessary upon\n        entering available time.  A special\
    \ case exists when the 10\n        second period leading to available or unavailable\
    \ time crosses a\n        900 second statistics window boundary, as the foregoing\n\
    \        description implies that the ES, BES, SES, SEFS, DM, and UAS\n      \
    \  counts the PREVIOUS interval must be adjusted.  In this case\n        successive\
    \ GETs of the affected dsx1IntervalSESs and\n        dsx1IntervalUASs objects\
    \ will return differing values if the\n        first GET occurs during the first\
    \ few seconds of the window.\n        The agent may instead choose to delay updates\
    \ to the various\n        statistics by 10 seconds in order to avoid retroactive\n\
    \        adjustments to the counters.  A way to do this is sketched in\n     \
    \   Appendix B.\n        In any case, a linkDown trap shall be sent only after\
    \ the agent\n        has determined for certain that the unavailable state has\
    \ been\n        entered, but the time on the trap will be that of the first UAS\n\
    \        (i.e., 10 seconds earlier).  A linkUp trap shall be handled\n       \
    \ similarly.\n        According to ANSI T1.231 unavailable time begins at the\
    \ _onset_\n        of 10 contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is,\n   \
    \     unavailable time starts with the _first_ of the 10 contiguous\n        SESs.\
    \  Also, while an interface is deemed unavailable all\n        counters for that\
    \ interface are frozen except for the UAS count.\n        It follows that an implementation\
    \ which strictly complies with\n        this standard must _not_ increment any\
    \ counters other than the\n        UAS count -- even temporarily -- as a result\
    \ of anything that\n        happens during those 10 seconds.  Since changes in\
    \ the signal\n        state lag the data to which they apply by 10 seconds, an\
    \ ANSI-\n        compliant implementation must pass the the one-second statistics\n\
    \        through a 10-second delay line prior to updating any counters.\n    \
    \    That can be done by performing the following steps at the end of\n      \
    \  each one second interval.\n   i)   Read near/far end CV counter and alarm status\
    \ flags from the\n        hardware.\n   ii)  Accumulate the CV counts for the\
    \ preceding second and compare\n        them to the ES and SES threshold for the\
    \ layer in question.\n        Update the signal state and shift the one-second\
    \ CV counts and\n        ES/SES flags into the 10-element delay line.  Note that\
    \ far-end\n        one-second statistics are to be flagged as \"absent\" during\
    \ any\n        second in which there is an incoming defect at the layer in\n \
    \       question or at any lower layer.\n   iii) Update the current interval statistics\
    \ using the signal state\n        from the _previous_ update cycle and the one-second\
    \ CV counts\n        and ES/SES flags shifted out of the 10-element delay line.\n\
    \   This approach is further described in Appendix B.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.4.  Failure States\n   The following failure states are received, or detected\
    \ failures, that\n   are reported in the dsx1LineStatus object.  When a DS1 interface\n\
    \   would, if ever, produce the conditions leading to the failure state\n   is\
    \ described in the appropriate specification.\n    Far End Alarm Failure\n   \
    \     The Far End Alarm failure is also known as \"Yellow Alarm\" in the\n   \
    \     DS1 case, \"Distant Alarm\" in the E1 case, and \"Remote Alarm\" in\n  \
    \      the DS2 case.\n        For D4 links, the Far End Alarm failure is declared\
    \ when bit 6\n        of all channels has been zero for at least 335 ms and is\
    \ cleared\n        when bit 6 of at least one channel is non-zero for a period\
    \ T,\n        where T is usually less than one second and always less than 5\n\
    \        seconds.  The Far End Alarm failure is not declared for D4 links\n  \
    \      when a Loss of Signal is detected.\n        For ESF links, the Far End\
    \ Alarm failure is declared if the\n        Yellow Alarm signal pattern occurs\
    \ in at least seven out of ten\n        contiguous 16-bit pattern intervals and\
    \ is cleared if the Yellow\n        Alarm signal pattern does not occur in ten\
    \ contiguous 16-bit\n        signal pattern intervals.\n        For E1 links,\
    \ the Far End Alarm failure is declared when bit 3\n        of time-slot zero\
    \ is received set to one on two consecutive\n        occasions.  The Far End Alarm\
    \ failure is cleared when bit 3 of\n        time-slot zero is received set to\
    \ zero.\n        For DS2 links, if a loss of frame alignment (LOF or LOS) and/or\n\
    \        DS2 AIS condition, is detected, the RAI signal shall be\n        generated\
    \ and transmitted to the remote side.\n        The Remote Alarm Indication(RAI)\
    \ signal is defined on m-bits as\n        a repetition of the 16bit sequence consisting\
    \ of eight binary\n        '1s' and eight binary '0s' in m-bits(1111111100000000).\
    \  When\n        the RAI signal is not sent (in normal operation),the HDLC flag\n\
    \        pattern (01111110) in the m-bit is sent.\n        The RAI failure is\
    \ detected when 16 or more consecutive RAI-\n        patterns (1111111100000000)\
    \ are received.  The RAI failure is\n        cleared when 4 or more consecutive\
    \ incorrect-RAI-patterns are\n        received.\n    Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)\
    \ Failure\n        The Alarm Indication Signal failure is declared when an AIS\n\
    \        defect is detected at the input and the  AIS defect still exists\n  \
    \      after the Loss Of Frame failure (which is caused by the unframed\n    \
    \    nature of the 'all-ones' signal) is declared. The AIS failure is\n      \
    \  cleared when the Loss Of Frame failure is cleared.  (See T1.231\n        Section\
    \ 6.2.1.2.1)\n        An AIS defect at a 6312 kbit/s (G.704) interface is detected\n\
    \        when the incoming signal has two {2} or less ZEROs in a sequence\n  \
    \      of 3156 bits (0.5ms).\n        The AIS signal defect is cleared when the\
    \ incoming signal has\n        three {3} or more ZEROs in a sequence of 3156 bits\
    \ (0.5ms).\n    Loss Of Frame Failure\n        For DS1 links, the Loss Of Frame\
    \ failure is declared when an OOF\n        or LOS  defect has persisted for T\
    \ seconds, where 2 <= T <= 10.\n        The Loss Of Frame failure is cleared when\
    \ there have been no OOF\n        or LOS defects during a period T where 0 <=\
    \ T <= 20.  Many\n        systems will perform \"hit integration\" within the\
    \ period T\n        before declaring or clearing the failure e.g., see TR 62411\n\
    \        [25].\n        For E1 links, the Loss Of Frame Failure is declared when\
    \ an OOF\n        defect is detected.\n    Loss Of Signal Failure\n        For\
    \ DS1, the Loss Of Signal failure is declared upon observing\n        175 +/-\
    \ 75 contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either\n        positive or\
    \ negative polarity.  The LOS failure is cleared upon\n        observing an average\
    \ pulse density of at least 12.5% over a\n        period of 175 +/- 75 contiguous\
    \ pulse positions starting with\n        the receipt of a pulse.\n        For\
    \ E1 links, the Loss Of Signal failure is declared when\n        greater than\
    \ 10 consecutive zeroes are detected (see O.162\n        Section 3.4`<.4).\n \
    \       A LOS defect at 6312kbit/s interfaces is detected when the\n        incoming\
    \ signal has \"no transitions\", i.e. when the signal level\n        is less than\
    \ or equal to a signal level of 35dB below nominal,\n        for N consecutive\
    \ pulse intervals, where 10 <=N<=255.\n        The LOS defect is cleared when\
    \ the incoming signal has\n        \"transitions\", i.e. when the signal level\
    \ is greater than or\n        equal to a signal level of 9dB below nominal, for\
    \ N consecutive\n        pulse intervals, where 10<=N<=255.\n        A signal\
    \ with \"transitions\" corresponds to a G.703 compliant\n        signal.\n   \
    \ Loopback Pseudo-Failure\n        The Loopback Pseudo-Failure is declared when\
    \ the near end\n        equipment has placed a loopback (of any kind) on the DS1.\
    \  This\n        allows a management entity to determine from one object whether\n\
    \        the DS1 can be considered to be in service or not (from the\n       \
    \ point of view of the near end equipment).\n    TS16 Alarm Indication Signal\
    \ Failure\n        For E1 links, the TS16 Alarm Indication Signal failure is\n\
    \        declared when time-slot 16 is received as all ones for all\n        frames\
    \ of two consecutive multiframes (see G.732 Section 4.2.6).\n        This condition\
    \ is never declared for DS1.\n    Loss Of MultiFrame Failure\n        The Loss\
    \ Of MultiFrame failure is declared when two consecutive\n        multiframe alignment\
    \ signals (bits 4 through 7 of TS16 of frame\n        0) have been received with\
    \ an error.  The Loss Of Multiframe\n        failure is cleared when the first\
    \ correct multiframe alignment\n        signal is received.  The Loss Of Multiframe\
    \ failure can only be\n        declared for E1 links operating with G.732 [27]\
    \ framing\n        (sometimes called \"Channel Associated Signalling\" mode).\n\
    \    Far End Loss Of Multiframe Failure\n        The Far End Loss Of Multiframe\
    \ failure is declared when bit 2 of\n        TS16 of frame 0 is received set to\
    \ one on two consecutive\n        occasions.  The Far End Loss Of Multiframe failure\
    \ is cleared\n        when bit 2 of TS16 of frame 0 is received set to zero. \
    \ The Far\n        End Loss Of Multiframe failure can only be declared for E1\
    \ links\n        operating in \"Channel Associated Signalling\" mode. (See G.732)\n\
    \    DS2 Payload AIS Failure\n        The DS2 Payload AIS is detected when the\
    \ incoming signal of the\n        6,312 kbps frame payload [TS1-TS96] has 2 or\
    \ less 0's in a\n        sequence of 3072 bits (0.5ms).  The DS2 Payload AIS is\
    \ cleared\n        when the incoming signal of the 6,312 kbps frame payload [TS1-\n\
    \        TS96] has 3 or more 0's in a sequence of 3072 bits (0.5 ms).\n    DS2\
    \ Performance Threshold\n        DS2 Performance Threshold Failure monitors equipment\
    \ performance\n        and is based on the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) Procedure\n\
    \        defined in G.704.\n        The DS2 Performance Threshold Failure is detected\
    \ when the bit\n        error ratio exceeds 10^-4 (Performance Threshold), and\
    \ the DS2\n        Performance Threshold Failure shall be cleared when the bit\n\
    \        error ratio decreased to less than 10^-6.\"\n"

  - "4.  Appendix A - Use of dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex\n   This Appendix exists\
    \ to document the previous use if dsx1IfIndex and\n   dsx1LineIndex and to clarify\
    \ the relationship of dsx1LineIndex as\n   defined in rfc1406 with the dsx1LineIndex\
    \ as defined in this\n   document.\n   The following shows the old and new definitions\
    \ and the relationship:\n   [New Definition]: \"This object should be made equal\
    \ to ifIndex.  The\n   next paragraph describes its previous usage.  Making the\
    \ object equal\n   to ifIndex allows proper use of ifStackTable and ds0/ds0bundle\
    \ mibs.\n   [Old Definition]: \"This object is the identifier of a DS1 Interface\n\
    \   on a managed device.  If there is an ifEntry that is directly\n   associated\
    \ with this and only this DS1 interface, it should have the\n   same value as\
    \ ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the dsx1LineIndices with an\n   unique identifier\
    \ following the rules of choosing a number that is\n   greater than ifNumber and\
    \ numbering the inside interfaces (e.g.,\n   equipment side) with even numbers\
    \ and outside interfaces (e.g,\n   network side) with odd numbers.\"\n   When\
    \ the \"Old Definition\" was created, it was described this way to\n   allow a\
    \ manager to treat the value _as if_ it were and ifIndex, i.e.\n   the value would\
    \ either be:  1) an ifIndex value or 2) a value that\n   was guaranteed to be\
    \ different from all valid ifIndex values.\n   The new definition is a subset\
    \ of that definition, i.e. the value is\n   always an ifIndex value.\n   The following\
    \ is Section 3.1 from rfc1406:\n   Different physical configurations for the support\
    \ of SNMP with DS1\n   equipment exist. To accommodate these scenarios, two different\n\
    \   indices for DS1 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.  These indices\n  \
    \ are dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex.\n   External interface scenario: the SNMP\
    \ Agent represents all managed\n   DS1 lines as external interfaces (for example,\
    \ an Agent residing on\n   the device supporting DS1 interfaces directly):\n \
    \  For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal\n   to\
    \ ifIndex, and the following applies:\n      ifIndex=dsx1IfIndex=dsx1LineIndex\
    \ for all interfaces.\n   The dsx1IfIndex column of the DS1 Configuration table\
    \ relates each\n   DS1 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the\n\
    \   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II STD 17, RFC1213).\n   External&Internal interface\
    \ scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an\n   host external from the device supporting\
    \ DS1 interfaces (e.g., a\n   router). The Agent represents both the host and\
    \ the DS1 device.  The\n   index dsx1LineIndex is used to not only represent the\
    \ DS1 interfaces\n   external from the host/DS1-device combination, but also the\
    \ DS1\n   interfaces connecting the host and the DS1 device.  The index\n   dsx1IfIndex\
    \ is always equal to ifIndex.\n   Example:\n   A shelf full of CSUs connected\
    \ to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on\n   the router proxies for itself and\
    \ the CSU. The router has also an\n   Ethernet interface:\n         +-----+\n\

    \   The assignment of the index values could for example be:\n           ifIndex\
    \ (= dsx1IfIndex)                     dsx1LineIndex\n                   1    \
    \               NA                  NA (Ethernet)\n                   2      Line#A\

    \                   3      Line#B   Network Side            9\n              \

    \   For this example, ifNumber is equal to 5.  Note the following\n   description\
    \ of dsx1LineIndex:  the dsx1LineIndex identifies a DS1\n   Interface on a managed\
    \ device.  If there is an ifEntry that is\n   directly associated with this and\
    \ only this DS1 interface, it should\n   have the same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise,\
    \ number the\n   dsx1LineIndices with an unique identifier following the rules\
    \ of\n   choosing a number greater than ifNumber and numbering inside\n   interfaces\
    \ (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and outside\n   interfaces (e.g., network\
    \ side) with odd numbers.\n   If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local\
    \ SNMP Agent, the\n   situation would be:\n           ifIndex (= dsx1IfIndex)\
    \                      dsx1LineIndex\n                   1      Line#A     Network\

  - "5.  Appendix B - The delay approach to Unavialable Seconds.\n   This procedure\
    \ is illustrated below for a DS1 ESF interface.  Similar\n   rules would apply\
    \ for other DS1, DS2, and E1 interface variants.  The\n   procedure guarantees\
    \ that the statistical counters are correctly\n   updated at all times, although\
    \ they lag real time by 10 seconds.  At\n   the end of each 15 minutes interval\
    \ the current interval counts are\n   transferred to the  most recent interval\
    \ entry and each interval is\n   shifted up by one position, with the oldest being\
    \ discarded if\n   necessary in order to make room.  The current interval counts\
    \ then\n   start over from zero.  Note, however, that the signal state\n   calculation\
    \ does not start afresh at each interval boundary;  rather,\n   signal state information\
    \ is retained across interval boundaries.\n"

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.\
    \  Even if the\n   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even\
    \ then,\n   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n\
    \   access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that\
    \ the implementors consider the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3\
    \ framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274\
    \ [12] and the View-based\n   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.\n\
    \   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity\
    \ giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give\
    \ access to those objects only to those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate\
    \ rights to access them.\n   Setting any of the following objects to an inappropriate\
    \ value can\n   cause loss of traffic.  The definition of inappropriate varies\
    \ for\n   each object.  In the case of dsx1LineType, for example, both ends of\n\
    \   a ds1/e1 must have the same value in order for traffic to flow.  In\n   the\
    \ case of dsx1SendCode and dsx1LoopbackConfig, for another example,\n   traffic\
    \ may stop transmitting when particular loopbacks are applied.\n      dsx1LineType\n\
    \      dsx1LineCoding\n      dsx1SendCode\n      dsx1LoopbackConfig\n      dsx1SignalMode\n\
    \      dsx1TransmitClockSource\n      dsx1Fdl\n      dsx1LineLength\n      dsx1Channelization\n\
    \   Setting the following object is mischevious, but not harmful to\n   traffic.\n\
    \      dsx1CircuitIdentifier\n   Setting the following object can cause an increase\
    \ in the number of\n   traps received by the network management station.\n   \
