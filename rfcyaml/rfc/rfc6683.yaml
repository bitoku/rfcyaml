  - "1.  Introduction\n   In 2007, the IP Infrastructure (IPI) Technical Module (TM)\
    \ of the\n   Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) consortium published a technical\n\
    \   specification [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1] through the European\n   Telecommunications\
    \ Standards Institute (ETSI).\n   [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1] covers several areas\
    \ related to the\n   transmission of MPEG2 transport stream-based services over\
    \ IP\n   networks.\n   Annex E of [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1] defines an optional\
    \ protocol for\n   Application-Layer Forward Error Correction (AL-FEC) to protect\
    \ the\n   streaming media for DVB-IP services transported using RTP [RFC3550].\n\
    \   In 2009, DVB updated the specification in a new revision that is\n   available\
    \ as [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1].  Among others, some updates and\n   modifications\
    \ to the AL-FEC protocol have been made.  This document\n   describes how one\
    \ can implement the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol by using\n   the 1-D interleaved\
    \ parity code [RFC6015] and Raptor code\n   specifications [RFC6681] [RFC6682].\n\
    \   The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol uses two layers for protection:  a base\n   layer\
    \ that is produced by the 1-D interleaved parity code (also\n   simply referred\
    \ to as \"parity code\" in the remainder of this\n   document), and an enhancement\
    \ layer that is produced by the Raptor\n   code.  Whenever a receiver supports\
    \ the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol, the\n   decoding support for the base-layer FEC\
    \ is mandatory while the\n   decoding support for the enhancement-layer FEC is\
    \ optional.  Both the\n   interleaved parity code and the Raptor code are systematic\
    \ FEC codes,\n   meaning that source packets are not modified in any way during\
    \ the\n   FEC encoding process.\n   The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol considers protection\
    \ of single-sequence\n   source RTP flows only.  In the AL-FEC protocol, the source\
    \ stream can\n   only be an MPEG-2 transport stream.  The FEC data at each layer\
    \ are\n   generated based on some configuration information, which also\n   determines\
    \ the exact associations and relationships between the\n   source and repair packets.\
    \  This document shows how this\n   configuration may be communicated out-of-band\
    \ in the Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].\n   In DVB-IPTV AL-FEC,\
    \ the source packets are carried in the source RTP\n   stream and the generated\
    \ FEC repair packets at each layer are carried\n   in separate streams.  At the\
    \ receiver side, if all of the source\n   packets are successfully received, there\
    \ is no need for FEC recovery\n   and the repair packets may be discarded.  However,\
    \ if there are\n   missing source packets, the repair packets can be used to recover\
    \ the\n   missing information.\n   The block diagram of the encoder side for the\
    \ systematic DVB-IPTV\n   AL-FEC protection is described in Figure 1.  Here, the\
    \ source packets\n   are fed into the parity encoder to produce the parity repair\
    \ packets.\n   The source packets may also be fed to the Raptor encoder to produce\n\
    \   the Raptor repair packets.  Source packets as well as the repair\n   packets\
    \ are then sent to the receiver(s) over an IP network.\n                     \

- title: 2.  DVB-IPTV AL-FEC Specification
  contents:
  - "2.  DVB-IPTV AL-FEC Specification\n   The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol comprises\
    \ two layers of FEC protection:\n   1-D interleaved parity FEC for the base layer\
    \ and Raptor FEC for the\n   enhancement layer.  The performance of these FEC\
    \ codes has been\n   examined in detail in [DVB-A115].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Base-Layer FEC
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Base-Layer FEC\n   The 1-D interleaved parity FEC uses the exclusive OR\
    \ (XOR) operation\n   to generate the repair symbols.  In a group of D x L source\
    \ packets,\n   the XOR operation is applied to each group of D source packets\
    \ whose\n   sequence numbers are L apart from each other to generate a total of\
    \ L\n   repair packets.  Due to interleaving, this FEC is effective against\n\
    \   bursty packet losses up to burst sizes of length L.\n   The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC\
    \ protocol requires that the D x L block of the\n   source packets protected by\
    \ the 1-D interleaved FEC code be wholly\n   contained within a single source\
    \ block of the Raptor code, if both\n   FEC layers are used.\n   Originally, the\
    \ DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol had adopted the 1-D\n   interleaved FEC payload format\
    \ from [SMPTE2022-1] in\n   [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1].  However, some incompatibilities\
    \ with RTP\n   [RFC3550] have been discovered in this specification.  These issues\n\
    \   have all been addressed in [RFC6015] (for details, refer to Section 1\n  \
    \ of [RFC6015]).  Some of the changes required by [RFC6015] are,\n   however,\
    \ not backward compatible with the existing implementations\n   that were based\
    \ on [SMPTE2022-1].\n   In a recent liaison statement from the IETF AVT WG to\
    \ DVB TM-IPI, it\n   has been recommended that DVB TM-IPI define a new RTP profile\
    \ for the\n   AL-FEC protocol since in the new profile, several of the issues\
    \ could\n   easily be addressed without jeopardizing the compliance to RTP\n \
    \  [RFC3550].\n   At the writing of this document, it was not clear whether or\
    \ not a\n   new RTP profile would be defined for the AL-FEC protocol.  DVB TM-IPI\n\
    \   attempted to address some of the issues in the updated specification\n   [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1];\
    \ however, there are still outstanding issues.\n   The following is a list of\
    \ the exceptions that need to be considered\n   by an implementation adopting\
    \ [RFC6015] to be compliant with the DVB-\n   IPTV AL-FEC protocol as specified\
    \ in [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1].\n   o  SSRC (synchronization source)\n      The\
    \ DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol requires that the SSRC fields of the\n      FEC packets\
    \ be set to zero.\n      This requirement conflicts with RTP [RFC3550].  Unless\
    \ signaled\n      otherwise, RTP uses random SSRC values with collision detection.\n\
    \      An explicit SSRC signaling mechanism is currently defined in\n      [RFC5576]\
    \ and can be used for this purpose.\n   o  CSRC (contributing source)\n      The\
    \ DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol does not support the protection of\n      the CSRC\
    \ entries in the source packets.  Thus, in an\n      implementation compliant\
    \ to DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol, the source\n      stream must not have any CSRC\
    \ entries in its packets, and\n      subsequently the CC fields of the source\
    \ RTP packets will be zero.\n      Note that if there are no RTP mixers used in\
    \ a system running the\n      DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol, the CC field of the source\
    \ RTP packets\n      will be zero and this is no longer an issue.  Thus, if defined,\n\
    \      the new RTP profile for the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol should forbid\n  \
    \    the use of any RTP mixers.\n   o  Timestamp\n      In the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC\
    \ protocol, the timestamp fields of the FEC\n      packets are ignored by the\
    \ receivers.\n   o  Payload Type\n      The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol sets the\
    \ PT fields of the FEC packets\n      to 96.\n      A static payload type assignment\
    \ for the base-layer FEC packets is\n      outside the scope of [RFC6015].  If\
    \ defined, the new RTP profile\n      for the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol may assign\
    \ 96 as the payload type\n      for the base-layer FEC packets.\n   In implementations\
    \ that are based on [RFC6015] and are willing to be\n   compliant with the DVB-IPTV\
    \ AL-FEC protocol as specified in\n   [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1], all these exceptions\
    \ must be considered as\n   well; however, in this case, the sender does not have\
    \ to select a\n   random initial sequence number for the FEC stream as suggested\
    \ by\n   [RFC3550].\n   Note that neither [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1] nor [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1]\n\
    \   implements the 1-D interleaved parity code as specified in [RFC6015].\n  \
    \ Thus, the payload format registered in [RFC6015] must not be used by\n   the\
    \ implementations that are compliant with the\n   [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1] or [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1]\
    \ specification.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Enhancement-Layer FEC
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Enhancement-Layer FEC\n   The Raptor code is a fountain code where as many\
    \ encoding symbols as\n   needed can be generated by the encoder on-the-fly from\
    \ source data.\n   Due to the fountain property of the Raptor code, multiple enhancement\n\
    \   layers may also be specified, if needed.\n   The details of the Raptor code\
    \ are provided in [RFC6681].  The FEC\n   scheme for the enhancement layer SHALL\
    \ be the Raptor FEC scheme for a\n   Single Sequenced Flow with FEC encoding ID\
    \ 5.  The RTP payload format\n   for Raptor FEC is specified in [RFC6682].\n \
    \  It is important to note that the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol in the\n   latest\
    \ specification [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1] allows both UDP-only and\n   RTP-over-UDP\
    \ encapsulations for the enhancement-layer FEC stream.\n   The initial specification\
    \ [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.3.1] exclusively permits\n   UDP-only encapsulation for the\
    \ enhancement-layer FEC stream.\n   When SDP is used for signaling, the transport\
    \ protocol identifier\n   indicates whether an RTP-over-UDP or UDP-only encapsulation\
    \ is used.\n   In case of any other signaling framework, the differentiation of\
    \ the\n   protocol for the enhancement-layer stream is achieved either\n   explicitly\
    \ through a protocol identifier or implicitly by the version\n   number of the\
    \ DVB IPTV Handbook.  If none of the above signaling is\n   provided, the receiver\
    \ shall concur from the packet size of the\n   repair packets if RTP-over-UDP\
    \ or UDP-only encapsulation is used.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Hybrid Decoding Procedures
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Hybrid Decoding Procedures\n   The receivers that support receiving and\
    \ decoding both the base- and\n   enhancement-layer FEC perform hybrid decoding\
    \ to improve the repair\n   performance.  The following steps may be followed\
    \ to perform hybrid\n   decoding:\n   1.  Base-layer (Parity) Decoding:  In this\
    \ step, the repair packets\n       that are encoded by the parity encoder are\
    \ processed as usual to\n       repair as many missing source packets as possible.\n\
    \   2.  Enhancement-layer (Raptor) Decoding:  If there are still missing\n   \
    \    source packets after the first step, the repair packets that are\n      \
    \ Raptor encoded are processed with the source packets already\n       received\
    \ and the source packets that are recovered in the first\n       step.\n   3.\
    \  Hybrid Decoding:  If there are still missing source packets after\n       the\
    \ second step, the unprocessed base-layer (parity) repair\n       packets are\
    \ converted to a form in which they can be added to the\n       Raptor decoding\
    \ process.  With this additional information,\n       Raptor decoding may potentially\
    \ recover any remaining missing\n       source packet.\n   The procedure that\
    \ should be followed to benefit from the base-layer\n   repair packets in the\
    \ Raptor decoding process is explained in detail\n   in Annex E.5.2 of [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1].\n"

    \ SDP [RFC4566] example for\n   [ETSI-TS-102-034v1.4.1].  The example uses the\
