  - "1.  Introduction\n   Internet Media Guides (IMGs) provide and deliver structured\n\
    \   collections of multimedia descriptions expressed using SDP [2], SDPng\n  \
    \ [3], or other description formats.  They are used to describe sets of\n   multimedia\
    \ services (e.g., television program schedules, content\n   delivery schedules)\
    \ and refer to other networked resources including\n   web pages.  IMGs provide\
    \ an envelope for metadata formats and session\n   descriptions defined elsewhere\
    \ with the aim of facilitating\n   structuring, versioning, referencing, distributing,\
    \ and maintaining\n   (caching, updating) such information.\n   IMG metadata may\
    \ be delivered to a potentially large audience, which\n   uses it to join a subset\
    \ of the sessions described and which may need\n   to be notified of changes to\
    \ the IMG metadata.  Hence, a framework\n   for distributing IMG metadata in various\
    \ different ways is needed to\n   accommodate the needs of different audiences:\
    \ For traditional\n   broadcast-style scenarios, multicast-based (push) distribution\
    \ of IMG\n   metadata needs to be supported.  Where no multicast is available,\n\
    \   unicast-based push is required.\n   This document defines a common framework\
    \ model for IMG delivery\n   mechanisms and their deployment in network entities.\
    \  There are three\n   fundamental components in the IMG framework model: data\
    \ types,\n   operation sets, and entities.  These components specify a set of\n\
    \   framework guidelines for efficient delivery and description of IMG\n   metadata.\
    \  The data types give generalized means to deliver and\n   manage the consistency\
    \ of application-specific IMG metadata.  IMG\n   operations cover broadcast, multicast\
    \ distribution, event\n   notification upon change, unicast-based push, and interactive\n\
    \   retrievals similar to web pages.\n   Since we envision that any Internet host\
    \ can be a sender and receiver\n   of IMG metadata, a host involved in IMG operations\
    \ performs one or\n   more of the roles defined as the entities in the IMG framework\
    \ model.\n   The requirements for IMG delivery mechanisms and descriptions can\
    \ be\n   found in the IMG requirements document [4].\n   This document outlines\
    \ the use of existing protocols to create an IMG\n   delivery infrastructure.\
    \  It aims to organize existing protocols into\n   a common model and show their\
    \ capabilities and limitations from the\n   viewpoint of IMG delivery functions.\n"

- title: 2.1.  New Terms
  contents:
  - "2.1.  New Terms\n   Internet Media Guide (IMG): IMG is a generic term to describe\
    \ the\n      formation, delivery, and use of IMG metadata.  The definition of\n\
    \      the IMG is intentionally left imprecise [4].\n   IMG Element: The smallest\
    \ atomic element of metadata that can be\n      transmitted separately by IMG\
    \ operations and referenced\n      individually from other IMG elements [4].\n\
    \   IMG Metadata: A set of metadata consisting of one or more IMG\n      elements.\
    \  IMG metadata describes the features of multimedia\n      content used to enable\
    \ selection of and access to media sessions\n      containing content.  For example,\
    \ metadata may consist of a media\n      object's URI, title, airtime, bandwidth\
    \ needed, file size, text\n      summary, genre, and access restrictions [4].\n\
    \   IMG Description:  A collection of IMG metadata with a data type\n      indicating\
    \ a self-contained set or a subset of IMG metadata, or a\n      reference to IMG\
    \ metadata.\n   IMG Delivery: The process of exchanging IMG metadata both in terms\
    \ of\n      large-scale and atomic data transfers [4].\n   IMG Sender: An IMG\
    \ sender is a logical entity that sends IMG metadata\n      to one or more IMG\
    \ receivers [4].\n   IMG Receiver: An IMG receiver is a logical entity that receives\
    \ IMG\n      metadata from an IMG sender [4].\n   IMG Transceiver: An IMG transceiver\
    \ combines an IMG receiver and\n      sender.  It may modify received IMG metadata\
    \ or merge IMG metadata\n      received from a several different IMG senders [4].\n\
    \   IMG Operation: An atomic operation of an IMG transport protocol, used\n  \
    \    between IMG sender(s) and IMG receiver(s) for the delivery of IMG\n     \
    \ metadata and for the control of IMG sender(s)/receiver(s) [4].\n   IMG Transport\
    \ Protocol: A protocol that transports IMG metadata from\n      an IMG sender\
    \ to IMG receiver(s) [4].\n   IMG Transport Session: An association between an\
    \ IMG sender and one\n      or more IMG receivers within the scope of an IMG transport\n\
    \      protocol.  An IMG transport session involves a time-bound series\n    \
    \  of IMG transport protocol interactions that provide delivery of\n      IMG\
    \ metadata from the IMG sender to the IMG receiver(s) [4].\n   IMG Transfer: A\
    \ transfer of IMG metadata from an IMG sender to IMG\n      receiver(s).\n"
- title: 3.  IMG Common Framework Model
  contents:
  - "3.  IMG Common Framework Model\n   Two common elements are found in all existing\
    \ IMG candidate cases:\n   the need to describe the services and the need to deliver\
    \ the\n   descriptions.  In some cases, the descriptions provide multicast\n \
    \  addresses and thus are part of the transport configuration.  In other\n   cases,\
    \ descriptions are specific to the media application and may be\n   meant for\
    \ either human or machine consumption.  Thus, the\n   technologies can be roughly\
    \ divided into three areas:\n      o Application-specific Metadata: data describing\
    \ the content of\n        services and media which are both specific to certain\n\
    \        applications and generally human readable.\n      o Delivery Descriptions:\
    \ the descriptions (metadata) that are\n        essential to enable (e.g., multicast)\
    \ delivery.  These include\n        framing (headers) for application-specific\
    \ metadata, the\n        metadata element identification and structure, and fundamental\n\
    \        session data.\n      o Delivery Protocols: the methods and protocols\
    \ to exchange\n        descriptions between the senders and the receivers.  An\
    \ IMG\n        transport protocol consists of two functions: carrying IMG\n  \
    \      metadata from an IMG sender to an IMG receiver and controlling\n      \
    \  an IMG transport protocol.  These functions are not always\n        exclusive;\
    \ therefore, some messages may combine control messages\n        and metadata\
    \ carriage functions to reduce the amount of the\n        messaging.\n"
- title: 3.1.  IMG Data Types
  contents:
  - "3.1.  IMG Data Types\n   A data model is needed to precisely define the terminology\
    \ and\n   relationships between sets, supersets, and subsets of metadata.  A\n\
    \   precise data model is essential for the implementation of IMGs,\n   although\
    \ it is not within the scope of this framework and requires a\n   separate specification.\
    \  However, there are three IMG data types in\n   general: Complete IMG Descriptions,\
    \ Delta IMG Descriptions, and IMG\n   Pointers.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Complete IMG Description
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Complete IMG Description\n   A Complete IMG Description provides a self-contained\
    \ set of metadata\n   for one media object or service, i.e., it does not need\
    \ additional\n   information from any other IMG element.  This is not to be confused\n\
    \   with \"complete IMG metadata\", which, although vaguely defined here,\n  \
    \ represents the complete IMG metadata database of an IMG sender (or\n   related\
    \ group of IMG senders -- potentially the complete Internet IMG\n   knowledge).\
    \  An IMG sender will generally deliver only subsets of\n   metadata from its\
    \ complete database in a particular IMG transport\n   session.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Delta IMG Description
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Delta IMG Description\n   A Delta IMG Description provides only part\
    \ of a Complete IMG\n   Description, defining the difference from a previous version\
    \ of the\n   Complete IMG Description.  Delta IMG Descriptions may be used to\n\
    \   reduce network resource usage, for instance, when data consistency is\n  \
    \ essential and small and frequent changes occur to IMG elements.\n   Thus, this\
    \ description does not represent a complete set of metadata\n   until it is combined\
    \ with other metadata that may already exist or\n   arrive in the future.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  IMG Pointer
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  IMG Pointer\n   An IMG Pointer identifies or locates metadata.  This\
    \ may be used to\n   separately obtain metadata (Complete or Delta IMG Descriptions)\
    \ or\n   perform another IMG management function such as data expiry (and\n  \
    \ erasure).  The IMG Pointer may be used to reference IMG metadata\n   elements\
    \ within the IMG transport session and across IMG transport\n   sessions.  This\
    \ pointer type does not include IMG metadata per se\n   (although it may also\
    \ appear as a data field in Complete or Delta IMG\n   Descriptions).\n"
- title: 3.2.  IMG Entities
  contents:
  - "3.2.  IMG Entities\n   There are several fundamental IMG entities that indicate\
    \ the\n   capability to perform certain roles.  An Internet host involved in\n\

    \ are crystallized in the\n   next few sections.\n"
- title: 3.3.1.  IMG ANNOUNCE
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  IMG ANNOUNCE\n   When an IMG receiver participates in unidirectional\
    \ communications\n   (e.g., over satellite, terrestrial radio, and wired multicast\n\
    \   networks), an IMG receiver may not need to send any IMG message to an\n  \
    \ IMG sender prior to IMG metadata delivery.  In this case, an IMG\n   sender\
    \ can initiate unsolicited distribution for IMG metadata and an\n   IMG sender\
    \ is the only entity that can maintain the distribution\n   (this includes scenarios\
    \ with multiple and cooperative IMG senders).\n   This operation is useful when\
    \ there are large numbers of IMG\n   receivers or the IMG receivers do not have\
    \ a guaranteed uplink\n   connection to the IMG sender.  The IMG sender may also\
    \ include\n   authentication data in the ANNOUNCE operation so that IMG receivers\n\
    \   may check the authenticity of the metadata.  This operation can carry\n  \
    \ any of the IMG data types.\n   There is no restriction to prevent IMG ANNOUNCE\
    \ from being used in an\n   asynchronous solicited manner, where a separate operation\
    \ (possibly\n   out of band) enables IMG receivers to subscribe/register to the\
    \ IMG\n   ANNOUNCE operation.\n"
- title: 3.3.2.  IMG QUERY
  contents:
  - "3.3.2.  IMG QUERY\n   If an IMG receiver needs to obtain IMG metadata, an IMG\
    \ receiver can\n   use an IMG QUERY operation and initiate a receiver-driven IMG\n\
    \   transport session.  The IMG receiver expects a synchronous response\n   to\
    \ the subsequent request from the IMG sender.  This operation can be\n   used\
    \ where a bidirectional transport network is available between the\n   IMG sender\
    \ and receiver.  Some IMG receivers may want to obtain IMG\n   metadata when network\
    \ connectivity is available or just to avoid\n   caching unsolicited IMG metadata.\
    \  The IMG receiver must indicate the\n   extent and data type of metadata wanted\
    \ in some message in the\n   operation.  The extent indicates the number and grouping\
    \ of metadata\n   descriptions.  In some cases, it may be feasible to request\
    \ an IMG\n   sender's complete metadata collection.\n"
- title: 3.3.3.  IMG RESOLVE
  contents:
  - "3.3.3.  IMG RESOLVE\n   An IMG sender synchronously responds, and sends IMG metadata,\
    \ to an\n   IMG QUERY that has been sent by an IMG receiver.  This operation can\n\
    \   be used where a bidirectional transport network is available between\n   the\
    \ IMG sender and receiver.  If the IMG QUERY specifies a subset of\n   IMG metadata\
    \ (extent and data type) that is available to the IMG\n   sender, the IMG sender\
    \ can resolve the query; otherwise, it should\n   indicate that it is not able\
    \ to resolve the query.  The IMG sender\n   may authenticate the IMG receiver\
    \ during the QUERY operation to\n   determine if the IMG receiver is authorized\
    \ to receive that metadata.\n   The sender may also include authentication data\
    \ in the RESOLVE\n   operation so that IMG receivers may check the authenticity\
    \ of the\n   metadata.  This operation may carry any of the IMG data types.\n"
- title: 3.3.4.  IMG SUBSCRIBE
  contents:
  - "3.3.4.  IMG SUBSCRIBE\n   If an IMG receiver wants to be notified when the IMG\
    \ metadata it\n   holds becomes stale, the IMG receiver can use the IMG SUBSCRIBE\n\
    \   operation in advance in order to solicit IMG NOTIFY messages from an\n   IMG\
    \ sender.\n   This operation may provide the IMG sender with specific details\
    \ of\n   which metadata or notification services it is interested in the case\n\
    \   where the IMG sender offers more than the simplest \"all data\"\n   service.\
    \  This operation implicitly provides the functionality of\n   unsubscribing to\
    \ inform an IMG sender that an IMG receiver wishes to\n   stop getting certain\
    \ (or all) notifications.  It should be noted that\n   unsubscription may be provided\
    \ implicitly by the expiry (timeout) of\n   a subscription before it is renewed.\n\
    \   Since the IMG receiver does not know when metadata will be updated\n   and\
    \ the notify message will arrive, this operation does not\n   synchronize with\
    \ the notify messages.  The IMG receiver may wait for\n   notify messages for\
    \ a long time.  The IMG sender may authenticate the\n   IMG receiver to check\
    \ whether an IMG SUBSCRIBE operation is from an\n   authorized IMG receiver.\n"
- title: 3.3.5.  IMG NOTIFY
  contents:
  - "3.3.5.  IMG NOTIFY\n   An IMG NOTIFY is used asynchronously in response to an\
    \ earlier IMG\n   SUBSCRIBE.  An IMG NOTIFY operation indicates that updated IMG\n\
    \   metadata is available or part of the existing IMG metadata is stale.\n   An\
    \ IMG NOTIFY may be delivered more than once during the time an IMG\n   SUBSCRIBE\
    \ is active.  This operation may carry any of the IMG data\n   types.  The IMG\
    \ sender may also include authentication data in the\n   IMG NOTIFY operation\
    \ so that IMG receivers may check the authenticity\n   of the messages.\n"
- title: 3.3.6.  Binding between IMG Operations and Data Types
  contents:
  - "3.3.6.  Binding between IMG Operations and Data Types\n   There is a need to\
    \ provide a binding between the various IMG\n   operations and IMG data types\
    \ to allow management of each discrete\n   set of IMG metadata transferred using\
    \ an IMG operation.  This binding\n   must be independent of any particular metadata\
    \ syntax used to\n   represent a set of IMG metadata, as well as be compatible\
    \ with any\n   IMG transport protocol.  The binding must uniquely identify the\
    \ set\n   of IMG metadata delivered within an IMG transfer, regardless of the\n\
    \   metadata syntax used.  The uniqueness may only be needed within the\n   domains\
    \ the metadata is used, but this must enable globally unique\n   identification\
    \ to support Internet usage.  Care should be taken that\n   scope- and domain-specific\
    \ identifiers do not leak outside the scope;\n   using globally unique identifiers\
    \ such as URLs avoids these problems.\n   The binding must provide versioning\
    \ to the transferred IMG metadata\n   so that changes can be easily handled and\
    \ stale data identified, and\n   give temporal validity of the transferred IMG\
    \ metadata.  It must\n   invalidate the IMG metadata by indicating an expiry time,\
    \ and may\n   optionally provide a time (presumably in the future) from when the\n\
    \   IMG metadata becomes valid.  The temporal validity of a metadata\n   object\
    \ may need to be updated later.  Furthermore, the binding must\n   be independent\
    \ of any specific metadata syntax used for the IMG\n   metadata, in the sense\
    \ that no useful syntax should be excluded.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Existing Standards Fitting the IMG Framework Model\n   SDP: The SDP format\
    \ [2] could be used to describe session-level\n   parameters (e.g., scheduling,\
    \ addressing, and the use of media\n   codecs) to be included in Complete IMG\
    \ Descriptions.  Although there\n   are extension points in SDP allowing the format\
    \ to be extended, there\n   are limitations in the flexibility of this extension\
    \ mechanism.\n   However, SDP syntax cannot provide IMG Descriptions and IMG Pointers\n\
    \   without significant overhead.  It is expected that the information\n   conveyed\
    \ by SDP is just a small subset of IMG metadata; thus, the use\n   of SDP for\
    \ other than session parameters may not be reasonable.\n   SDPng [3]: Similar\
    \ to SDP, this format could also be used for\n   representing session-level parameters\
    \ of IMG metadata.  Compared to\n   SDP, the XML-based format of SDPng should\
    \ be much more flexible and\n   allow extensions and integration with other description\
    \ formats.\n   MPEG-7: Descriptions based on the MPEG-7 standard [5] could provide\n\
    \   application-specific metadata describing the properties of multimedia\n  \
    \ content beyond parameters carried in SDP or SDPng descriptions.\n   MPEG-7 provides\
    \ a machine-readable format of representing content\n   categories and attributes,\
    \ helping end-users or receiving software in\n   choosing content for reception.\
    \  MPEG-7 is based on XML, so it is\n   well suited to be combined with other\
    \ XML-based formats such as\n   SDPng.\n   TV-Anytime: The TV-Anytime Forum [6]\
    \ provides descriptions based on\n   XML schema for TV-specific program guides.\
    \  TV-Anytime uses the\n   MPEG-7 User description profile to a limited extent,\
    \ only for user\n   preferences and usage history, and also a TV-Anytime-specific\
    \ data\n   model for other schema.  These are optimized to describe broadcast\n\
    \   schedules, on-demand program guides and program events.\n   HTTP: The HTTP\
    \ protocol [7] can be used as a bidirectional unicast\n   IMG transport protocol.\
    \  Being a request-reply-oriented protocol,\n   HTTP is well suited for implementing\
    \ synchronous operations such as\n   QUERY, RESOLVE, and even SUBSCRIBE.  However,\
    \ HTTP does not provide\n   asynchronous operations such as ANNOUNCE and NOTIFY\
    \ and to implement\n   asynchronous operations using HTTP, IMG receivers should\
    \ poll the IMG\n   sender periodically.  Thus, by itself, HTTP is not sufficient\
    \ to\n   fulfill all of the IMG requirements [4] in a unicast deployment.\n  \
    \ Session Announcement Protocol (SAP): The announcement mechanism\n   provided\
    \ by SAP [8] provides unidirectional delivery of session\n   discovery information.\
    \  Although SDP is the default payload format of\n   SAP, the use of a MIME type\
    \ identifier for the payload allows\n   arbitrary payload formats to be used in\
    \ SAP messages.  Thus, SAP\n   could be used to implement the multicast and unicast\
    \ IMG ANNOUNCE and\n   IMG NOTIFY operations.\n   However, SAP lacks scalable\
    \ and efficient reliability, extensibility\n   for payload size, and congestion\
    \ control, and only one description is\n   allowed per SAP message due to lack\
    \ of payload segmentation.\n   In principle, SAP could be extended to get around\
    \ its limitations.\n   However, the amount of changes needed in SAP to address\
    \ all of the\n   above limitations would effectively result in a new protocol.\
    \  Due to\n   these limitations, the use of SAP as an IMG transport protocol is\
    \ not\n   recommended.\n   SIP: The SIP-specific event mechanism described in\
    \ RFC 3265 [9]\n   provides a way to implement IMG SUBSCRIBE and IMG NOTIFY operations\n\
    \   via a bidirectional unicast connection.  However, there are\n   scalability\
    \ problems with this approach, as RFC 3265 currently does\n   not consider multicast.\n\
    \   Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP): The RTSP protocol [10] defines a\n  \
    \ retrieval-and-update notification mechanism, named DESCRIBE and\n   ANNOUNCE,\
    \ for the description of a presentation or media object in\n   order to initialize\
    \ a streaming session.  These methods are a subset\n   of the entire streaming\
    \ control operations in RTSP; thus, these could\n   not be available for individual\
    \ mechanisms.  However, the DESCRIBE\n   method in RTSP could be used to instantiate\
    \ IMG QUERY, IMG RESOLVE,\n   and IMG SUBSCRIBE, and the RTSP ANNOUNCE could be\
    \ used to instantiate\n   an IMG NOTIFY for a streaming session controlled by\
    \ RTSP.\n"

- title: 5.2.1.  A Multicast Transport Protocol
  contents:
  - "5.2.1.  A Multicast Transport Protocol\n   SAP is currently the only open standard\
    \ protocol suited to the\n   unidirectional/multicast delivery of IMG metadata.\
    \  As discussed, it\n   fails to meet the IMG requirements in many ways and, since\
    \ it is not\n   designed to be extensible, we recognize that a new multicast\n\
    \   transport protocol for announcements needs to be specified to meet\n   IMG\
    \ needs.  This protocol will be essential to IMG delivery for\n   unidirectional\
    \ and multicast deployments.\n   The Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) [11] protocol\
    \ from the IETF\n   Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) working group is very interesting\n\
    \   as it fulfills many of the requirements, is extensible, and has the\n   ability\
    \ to 'plug-in' both FEC (Forward Error Correction, for\n   reliability) and CC\
    \ (Congestion Control) functional blocks.  It is\n   specifically designed for\
    \ unidirectional multicast object transport.\n   ALC is not fully specified, although\
    \ the RMT working group had a\n   fully specified protocol using ALC called FLUTE\
    \ (File Delivery over\n   Unidirectional Transport) [12].  FLUTE seems to be the\
    \ only fully\n   specified transport and open specification on which a new IMG\n\
    \   announcement protocol could be designed.  Thus, we recommend that ALC\n  \
    \ and FLUTE be the starting points for this protocol's design.\n   Developing\
    \ a new protocol from scratch, or attempting to improve SAP,\n   is also feasible,\
    \ although it would involve repeating many of the\n   design processes and decisions\
    \ already made by the IETF for ALC.  In\n   particular, any announcement protocol\
    \ must feature sufficient\n   scalability, flexibility, and reliability to meet\
    \ IMG needs.  Also,\n   the IMG ANNOUNCE operation must be supported and IMG NOTIFY\n\
    \   capability could be investigated for both hybrid unicast-multicast\n   and\
    \ unidirectional unicast systems.\n"

    \ although\n   several usable unicast transport protocols and specifications can\
    \ be\n   harnessed for this (SIP [13], SIP events [9], HTTP [7], etc.).  In\n\
    \   particular, both IMG SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY and IMG QUERY-RESOLVE operation\n  \

- title: 5.2.3.  IMG Envelope
  contents:
  - "5.2.3.  IMG Envelope\n   An IMG envelope provides the binding between IMG operations\
    \ and data\n   types.  Such a binding can be realized by defining a common minimal\n\
    \   set of information needed to manage IMG metadata transfers, and by\n   including\
    \ this information with any set of IMG metadata delivered to\n   IMG receivers.\n\
    \   Four options for IMG metadata transfer envelope delivery are\n   feasible:\n\
    \      1.  Embedding in a transport protocol header.  This can be done\n     \
    \     with either header extensions of existing protocols, or newly\n        \
    \  defined header fields of a new (or new version of a) transport\n          protocol.\
    \  However, multiple methods for the variety of\n          transport protocols\
    \ would hinder interoperability and\n          transport protocol independence.\n\
    \      2.  A separate envelope object, which points to the IMG metadata\n    \
    \      'object', delivered in-band with the metadata transport\n          protocol\
    \ session.  This might complicate delivery as the\n          envelope and 'service'\
    \ metadata objects would have to be\n          bound, e.g., by pairing some kind\
    \ of transport object numbers\n          (analogous to port number pairs sometimes\
    \ used for RTP and\n          RTCP [14]).  This would also enable schemes that\
    \ deliver\n          envelope and metadata 'objects' by different media, also\
    \ using\n          more than a single transport protocol.\n      3.  A metadata\
    \ wrapper that points to and/or embeds the service\n          metadata into its\
    \ 'super-syntax'.  For example, XML would\n          enable embedding generic\
    \ text objects.\n      4.  Embedding in the metadata itself.  However, this requires\
    \ a\n          new field in many metadata syntaxes and would not be feasible\n\
    \          if a useful syntax were not capable of extensibility in this\n    \
    \      way.  It also introduces a larger 'implementation\n          interpretation'\
    \ variety, which would hinder interoperability.\n          Thus, this option is\
    \ not recommended.\n   It is likely that more than one of these options will fulfill\
    \ the\n   needs of IMGs, so the selection, and possibly optimization, is left\n\
    \   for subsequent specification and feedback from implementation\n   experience.\
    \  Such a specification is essential for IMG delivery.\n   When there are superset/subset\
    \ relations between IMG Descriptions, it\n   is assumed that the IMG Descriptions\
    \ of the subset inherit the\n   parameters of the superset.  Thus, an IMG metadata\
    \ transfer envelope\n   carrying the IMG Descriptions of a superset may implicitly\
    \ define\n   parameters of IMG Descriptions belonging to its subset.  The\n  \
    \ relations between IMG Descriptions may span from one envelope to\n   another\
    \ according to a data model definition.\n"

  - "5.2.4.  Metadata Data Model\n   A structured data model would allow reuse and\
    \ extension of the set of\n   metadata and may enable use of multiple syntaxes\
    \ (SDP, MPEG-7, etc.)\n   as part of the same body of IMG metadata.\n   For the\
    \ successful deployment of IMGs in various environments,\n   further work may\
    \ be needed to define metadata and data models for\n   application-specific requirements.\
    \  Existing (and future) work on\n   these would need to be mapped to the IMG\
    \ data types and use of the\n   IMG transfer envelope concept as described above.\n\
    \   This document is a framework for the delivery of IMG metadata and\n   thus\
    \ further discussion on the definition data models for IMGs is\n   beyond its\
    \ scope.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The IMG framework is developed from the IMG requirements\
    \ document\n   [4], and so the selection of specific protocols and mechanism for\
    \ use\n   with the IMG framework must also take into account the security\n  \
    \ considerations of the IMG requirements document.  This framework\n   document\
    \ does not mandate the use of specific protocols.  However, an\n   IMG specification\
    \ would inherit the security considerations of\n   specific protocols used.\n\
    \   Protocol instantiations that are used to provide IMG operations will\n   have\
    \ very different security considerations depending on their scope\n   and purpose.\
    \  However, there are several general issues that are\n   valuable to consider\
    \ and, in some cases, provide technical solutions\n   for.  These are described\
    \ below.\n   Individual and group privacy: Customized IMG metadata may reveal\n\
    \   information about the habits and preferences of a user and may thus\n   deserve\
    \ confidentiality protection, even if the original information\n   were public.\
    \  Protecting this metadata against snooping requires the\n   same actions and\
    \ measures as for other point-to-point and multicast\n   Internet communications.\
    \  Naturally, the risk of snooping depends on\n   the amount of individual or\
    \ group personalization the IMG metadata\n   contains.\n   IMG authenticity: In\
    \ some cases, the IMG receiver needs to be assured\n   of the sender or origin\
    \ of IMG metadata or its modification history.\n   This can prevent denial-of-service\
    \ or hijacking attempts that give an\n   IMG receiver incorrect information in\
    \ or about the metadata, thus\n   preventing successful access of the media or\
    \ directing the IMG\n   receiver to the incorrect media possibly with tasteless\
    \ material.\n   IMG receiver authorization: Some or all of any IMG sender's metadata\n\
    \   may be private or valuable enough to allow access to only certain IMG\n  \
    \ receivers and thus make it worth authenticating users.  Encrypting\n   the data\
    \ is also a reasonable step, especially where group\n   communications methods\
    \ results in unavoidable snooping opportunities\n   for unauthorized nodes.\n\
    \   Unidirectional specifics: A difficulty that is faced by\n   unidirectional\
    \ delivery operations is that many protocols providing\n   application-level security\
    \ are based on bidirectional communications.\n   The application of these security\
    \ protocols in case of strictly\n   unidirectional links is not considered in\
    \ the present document.\n   Malicious code: Currently, IMGs are not envisaged\
    \ to deliver\n   executable code at any stage.  However, as some IMG transport\n\
    \   protocols may be capable of delivering arbitrary files, it is\n   RECOMMENDED\
    \ that the IMG operations do not have write access to the\n   system or any other\
    \ critical areas.\n"
