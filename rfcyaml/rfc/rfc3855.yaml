    [CMS]\n   specification and message specifications can reasonably be\n   transported
    via a variety of electronic mail systems.  This\n   specification defines the
    options and values necessary to enable\n   interoperable transport of S/MIME messages
    over an X.400 system.\n   This document describes a mechanism for using CMS objects
    as the\n   message content of X.400 messages in a native X.400 environment.\n
    \  This means that gateways or other functions that expect to deal with\n   IPMS,
    such as those specified in [MIXER] and [BODYMAP], cannot do\n   anything with
    these messages.  Note that cooperating S/MIME agents\n   must support common forms
    of message content in order to achieve\n   interoperability.\n   Definition of

    - "2.1.  The X.400 Message Structure\n   This section reviews the X.400 message
      format.  An X.400 message has\n   two parts, the envelope and the content, as
      described in X.402\n   [X.400]:\n   Envelope --  An information object whose
      composition varies from one\n      transmittal step to another and that variously
      identifies the\n      message's originator and potential recipients, documents
      its\n      previous conveyance and directs its subsequent conveyance by the\n
      \     Message Transfer System (MTS), and characterizes its content.\n   Content
      -- The content is the piece of information that the\n      originating User
      Agent wants to be delivered to one or more\n      recipients.  The MTS neither
      examines nor modifies the content,\n      except for conversion, during its
      conveyance of the message.  MTS\n      conversion is not applicable to the scenario
      of this document\n      because such conversion is incompatible with CMS protection\n
      \     mechanisms.\n   One piece of information borne by the envelope identifies
      the type of\n   the content.  The content type is an identifier (an ASN.1 OID
      or\n   Integer) that denotes the syntax and semantics of the content\n   overall.
      \ This identifier enables the MTS to determine the message's\n   deliverability
      to particular users, and enables User Agents and\n   Message Stores to interpret
      and process the content.\n   Some X.400 content types further refine the structure
      of content as a\n   set of heading elements and body parts.  An example of this
      is the\n   Interpersonal Messaging System (IPMS).  The IPMS content structure
      is\n   able to convey zero or more arbitrary body parts each identified by\n
      \  the body part type.  The body part type is an ASN.1 OID or Integer\n   that
      denotes the syntax and semantics of the body part in question.\n"

    - "2.2.  Carrying S/MIME as X.400 Content\n   When transporting a CMS-protected
      message in X.400, the preferred\n   approach (except as discussed in section
      2.3 below) is to convey the\n   object as X.400 message content.  This section
      describes how S/MIME\n   CMS objects are conveyed as the content part of X.400
      messages.  This\n   mechanism is suitable for transport of CMS-protected messages\n
      \  regardless of the mail content that has been encapsulated.\n   Implementations
      MUST include the CMS object in the content field of\n   the X.400 message.\n
      \  If the CMS object is covered by an outer MIME wrapper, the content-\n   type
      field of the P1 envelope MUST be set to the following CMS-\n   defined value:\n

      CMS-protected messages can be\n   conveyed within select body parts of the content.
      \ Implementations\n   generally SHOULD NOT embed CMS objects within X.400 body
      parts, but\n   should instead convey them as content as described in section
      2.2.\n   Nevertheless, one notable exception is necessary for the case of\n
      \  forwarding.\n   In instances when CMS objects are forwarded as part of a
      message\n   forwarding function, use of a body part is necessary.  When\n   forwarding
      a CMS object in an IPMS or IPMS-compatible body part,\n   implementations MUST
      use the content-body-part as formally defined by\n   [X.400], as shown below
      for reference.\n   content-body-part {ExtendedContentType:content-type}\n       EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE

      mhs(6) ipms(1) et(4) 17}\n   The implementation MUST copy the CMS object to
      be forwarded into the\n   Content field of the content-body-part.  The direct-reference
      field\n   of the body part MUST include the OID formed by the concatenation
      of\n   the id-et-content value and the following CMS-defined value.\n   id-ct-contentInfo

      forward any CMS object the DATA component of the body\n   part would be identified
      by { 2 6 1 4 17 1 2 840 113549 1 9 16 1 6 }.\n   The ForwardedContentParameters
      are optional and MAY be supported at\n   the discretion of the implementor.
      \ The OID value id-et-content MAY\n   also be included in the original-encoded-information-types
      field of\n   the X.400 message envelope at the discretion of the sending S/MIME\n
      \  agent.\n   In this instance, the content-type field of the P1 envelope MUST
      be\n   set to the value associate with the forwarding content (e.g., integer\n

      - "2.6.2.  Message Redirection Services\n   X.400 message redirection services
        can have an indirect impact on the\n   application of the CMS \"EnvelopedData\"
        content type.  Several\n   different forms of redirection are possible in
        X.400, including:\n   -  Originator Requested Alternate Recipient (ORAR)\n
        \  -  Alternate Recipient Assignment\n   -  Redirection of Incoming Messages\n
        \  In addition, any auto-forwarding services that are not security-aware\n
        \  may share the same problem.  An auto-forwarding implementation that\n   removes
        the EnvelopedData and reapplies it for the forwarded\n   recipient is not
        affected by this problem.  The normal case is that\n   the private key is
        not available when the human user is not present,\n   thus decryption is not
        possible.  However, if the private key is\n   present, forwarding can be used
        instead.\n   When the \"EnvelopedData\" content type is used to protect message\n
        \  contents, an instance of RecipientInfo is needed for each recipient\n   and
        alternate recipient in order to ensure the desired access to the\n   message.
        \ A RecipientInfo for the originator is a good practice just\n   in case the
        MTS returns the whole message.\n   In the event that ORAR is used, the originator
        is aware of the\n   identity of the alternate recipient and SHOULD include
        a\n   corresponding RecipientInfo element.  For other forms of redirection\n
        \  (including non-security-aware auto-forwarding) the alternate\n   recipient
        must either have access to the intended recipient's keys\n   (not recommended)
        or must relay the message to the intended recipient\n   by other means.\n"

      - "2.6.3.  DL Expansion\n   X.400 DLs can have an indirect impact on the application
        of the CMS\n   \"EnvelopedData\" content type.  When the \"EnvelopedData\"
        content type\n   is used to protect message contents, an instance of RecipientInfo
        is\n   needed for each recipient in order to ensure the desired access to\n
        \  the message.  Messages to a DL would typically include only a single\n
        \  RecipientInfo associated with the DL.  Unlike Mail Lists (MLs)\n   described
        in [ESS], however, X.400 DLs are not generally security-\n   aware and do
        not regenerate RecipientInfo elements for the DL\n   members.  It is recommended
        that a security-aware ML conforming to\n   [ESS] be used in preference to
        X.400 DLs.  When transporting CMS\n   objects within an X.400 environment,
        the DL Expansion Prohibited\n   service SHOULD be selected.\n"
