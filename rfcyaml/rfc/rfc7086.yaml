- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The HIP-Based Overlay Networking Environment (HIP BONE)\
    \ specification\n   [RFC6079] provides a high-level framework for building HIP-based\n\
    \   [RFC5201] overlays.  The HIP BONE framework does not address the\n   specification\
    \ of the details on how to combine a particular peer\n   protocol with HIP to\
    \ build an overlay.  It leaves this up to\n   documents referred to as HIP BONE\
    \ instance specifications.  As\n   discussed in [RFC6079], a HIP BONE instance\
    \ specification needs to\n   define, minimally:\n   o  the peer protocol to be\
    \ used.\n   o  what kind of Node IDs are used and how they are derived.\n   o\
    \  which peer protocol primitives trigger HIP messages.\n   o  how the overlay\
    \ identifier is generated.\n   This document addresses all the previous items\
    \ and provides\n   additional details needed to build RELOAD-based HIP BONEs,\
    \ referred\n   to here as RELOAD HIP BONEs.  The details on how different RELOAD\n\
    \   modules would be integrated to a HIP implementation and what kind of\n   APIs\
    \ are used between them are left as implementation details or to\n   be defined\
    \ by other documents.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\
    \  In\n   addition, this document uses the terms defined in [RFC5201],\n   [RFC6079],\
    \ [RFC6028], and [RFC6940].\n"
- title: 3.  Peer Protocol
  contents:
  - "3.  Peer Protocol\n   The peer protocol to be used is REsource LOcation And Discovery\n\
    \   (RELOAD) [RFC6940].  When used with RELOAD, HIP replaces the RELOAD's\n  \
    \ Forwarding and Link Management Layer (described in Section 6.5 of\n   [RFC6940]).\n"
- title: 4.  Node ID Generation
  contents:
  - "4.  Node ID Generation\n   This document specifies two modes for generating Node\
    \ and Resource\n   IDs.  Which mode is used in an actual overlay is defined by\
    \ the\n   overlay configuration.  Both of the modes are based on 16-byte ID\n\
    \   mode of RELOAD; hence, only 16-byte RELOAD Node and Resource IDs MUST\n  \
    \ be used in a RELOAD HIP BONE.\n   HIP uses 128-bit Overlay Routable Cryptographic\
    \ Hash Identifiers\n   (ORCHIDs) [RFC4843] as identifiers.  In a RELOAD HIP BONE,\
    \ a peer's\n   ORCHID can be used as a RELOAD Node ID (the \"ORCHID\" mode). \
    \ In this\n   mode, all the RELOAD IDs, including Resource IDs, are prefixed with\n\
    \   the ORCHID prefix, and the lower 100 bits of the IDs defined by\n   RELOAD\
    \ usage documents are used after the prefix.\n   In the other Node ID mode, namely\
    \ \"RELOAD\", all 128 bits are\n   generated as defined in [RFC6940].  This results\
    \ in a larger usable\n   address space than using the ORCHID mode, but the resulting\
    \ Node IDs\n   cannot be used with legacy applications and APIs, as discussed\
    \ in\n   Section 5.1 of [RFC6079].\n"
- title: 5.  Mapping between Protocol Primitives and HIP Messages
  contents:
  - "5.  Mapping between Protocol Primitives and HIP Messages\n   RELOAD HIP BONE\
    \ replaces the RELOAD protocol primitives taking care\n   of connection establishment\
    \ with the HIP base exchange, whereas the\n   rest of the RELOAD messages are\
    \ conveyed within HIP messages.  The\n   Forwarding and Link Management Layer\
    \ functionality of RELOAD,\n   including all the NAT traversal functionality,\
    \ is replaced by HIP,\n   existing extensions of HIP, and the extensions defined\
    \ in this\n   document.\n   The standard RELOAD messages consist of three parts:\
    \ the forwarding\n   header, the message contents, and the security block.  When\
    \ RELOAD\n   messages are sent in a RELOAD HIP BONE overlay, the RELOAD message\n\
    \   contents are used as such within HIP DATA [RFC6078] messages, but the\n  \
    \ functionality of the forwarding header and security block are\n   replaced with\
    \ the HIP header, HIP Destination and Via lists\n   [RFC6028], CERT [RFC6253],\
    \ TRANSACTION_ID [RFC6078], and the\n   OVERLAY_ID and OVERLAY_TTL [RFC6079] parameters,\
    \ as defined in the\n   following sections.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Forwarding Header
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Forwarding Header\n   The RELOAD forwarding header is used for forwarding\
    \ messages between\n   peers and to their final destination.  The forwarding header's\n\
    \   overlay field value MUST be used as such in an OVERLAY_ID parameter\n   and\
    \ the transaction_id field in a TRANSACTION_ID parameter.  That is,\n   all RELOAD\
    \ HIP BONE messages MUST contain these parameters; and, the\n   length of the\
    \ OVERLAY_ID parameter's identifier field is 4, and the\n   length of the TRANSACTION_ID\
    \ parameter is 8 octets.  HIP Destination\n   and Via lists are used for the same\
    \ purpose as the destination_list\n   and via_list in the forwarding header, with\
    \ the exception that all\n   Resource IDs MUST be of the same length as Node IDs,\
    \ and compressed\n   IDs MUST NOT be used.  The Time to Live (TTL) value in the\n\
    \   OVERLAY_TTL parameter is used like the ttl field in the forwarding\n   header.\n\
    \   The functionality of the fragment and length fields are provided by\n   the\
    \ HIP headers.  The relo_token, version, and max_response_length\n   are not needed\
    \ with HIP.  The forwarding header's options field, if\n   needed eventually for\
    \ some extensions, can be substituted with\n   additional HIP parameters.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Security Block
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Security Block\n   The RELOAD security block contains certificates and\
    \ digital\n   signatures of the message.  All the HIP DATA messages are digitally\n\
    \   signed by the originator of the message and contain the HOST_ID\n   parameter\
    \ with the identifier that can be used for verifying the\n   signature.  Certificates\
    \ are delivered in a HIP CERT parameter as\n   defined in [RFC6253] or stored\
    \ to the overlay using the RELOAD\n   Certificate Storage Usage.\n   Note that\
    \ when the RELOAD mode for Node ID generation is used, the\n   certificate certifying\
    \ that a host is allowed to use a certain Node\n   ID MUST contain the host's\
    \ Node ID instead of the Host Identity Tag\n   (HIT) in the \"subjectAltName\"\
    \ field of the certificate as described\n   in Section 11.3 of [RFC6940], while\
    \ the \"Subject\" field contains the\n   HIT calculated from the Host Identity.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Replaced RELOAD Messages
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Replaced RELOAD Messages\n   The Attach procedure in RELOAD establishes\
    \ a connection between two\n   peers.  This procedure is performed using the AttachReq\
    \ and AttachAns\n   messages.  When HIP is used, the Attach procedure is performed\
    \ by\n   using a HIP base exchange.  That is, peers send HIP first Initiator\n\
    \   (I1) messages instead of RELOAD AttachReq messages.  This behavior\n   replaces\
    \ the one described in Section 6.5 of [RFC6940].\n   The AppAttach procedure in\
    \ RELOAD is used for creating a connection\n   for other applications than RELOAD.\
    \  Also, the AppAttach procedure is\n   replaced with the HIP base exchange, and\
    \ after the base exchange,\n   peers can exchange any application layer data using\
    \ the normal\n   transport layer ports over the NAT traversing IPsec connection.\n\
    \   This specification does not support flooding of configuration files,\n   so\
    \ ConfigUpdate requests and responses (Section 6.5.4 of [RFC6940])\n   MUST NOT\
    \ be sent in the overlay.  RELOAD Ping messages (Section 6.5.3\n   of [RFC6940])\
    \ MAY be used.\n   For all other RELOAD messages, the message contents are used\
    \ as such\n   within HIP DATA messages.\n"
- title: 6.  Securing Communication
  contents:
  - "6.  Securing Communication\n   RELOAD uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246]\
    \ connections for\n   securing the hop-by-hop messaging and certificates and signatures\
    \ for\n   providing integrity protection for the overlay messages and for the\n\
    \   data stored in the overlay.\n   With a RELOAD HIP BONE, instead of using TLS\
    \ connections as defined\n   in [RFC6940], all HIP overlay messages MUST be sent\
    \ using encrypted\n   connections [RFC6261].\n   The data objects stored in the\
    \ RELOAD HIP BONE overlay are signed,\n   and the signatures are stored as defined\
    \ in [RFC6940] with the\n   exception that SignerIdentity is carried in the HIP\
    \ DATA message's\n   HOST_ID parameter instead of using the RELOAD security block.\
    \  Where\n   certificates are needed, they are sent using the HIP CERT parameter.\n"
- title: 7.  Routing HIP Messages via the Overlay
  contents:
  - "7.  Routing HIP Messages via the Overlay\n   If a host has no valid locator for\
    \ the receiver of a new HIP packet,\n   and the receiver is part of a RELOAD HIP\
    \ BONE overlay the host is\n   participating in, the host can send the HIP packet\
    \ to the receiver\n   using the overlay routing.\n   When sending a HIP packet\
    \ via the overlay, the host MUST add an empty\n   ROUTE_VIA parameter [RFC6028]\
    \ to the packet with the SYMMETRIC and\n   MUST_FOLLOW flags set and an OVERLAY_ID\
    \ parameter containing the\n   identifier of the right overlay network.  The host\
    \ consults the\n   RELOAD Topology Plugin for the next hop and sends the HIP packet\
    \ to\n   that host.\n   An intermediate host receiving a HIP packet with the OVERLAY_ID\n\
    \   parameter checks if it is participating in that overlay and SHOULD\n   drop\
    \ packets sent to unknown overlays.  If the host is not the final\n   destination\
    \ of the packet (i.e., the Receiver HIT in the HIP header\n   does not match to\
    \ any of its HITs), it checks if the packet contains\n   a ROUTE_DST parameter.\
    \  Such packets are forwarded to the next hop as\n   specified in [RFC6028]. \
    \ If the packet does not contain a ROUTE_DST\n   parameter, the host finds the\
    \ next hop from the RELOAD Topology\n   Plugin and forwards the packet there.\
    \  As specified in [RFC6028], the\n   host adds the HIT it uses on the HIP association\
    \ with the next-hop\n   host to the end of the ROUTE_VIA parameter, if present.\n\
    \   When the final destination host receives the HIP packet, the host\n   processes\
    \ it as specified in [RFC5201]; and, if the packet is a HIP\n   DATA packet, the\
    \ contents are processed as specified in [RFC6940].\n   If the HIP packet generates\
    \ a response, the response is routed back\n   on the same path using the ROUTE_DST\
    \ parameter as specified in\n   [RFC6028].\n"
- title: 8.  Enrollment and Bootstrapping
  contents:
  - "8.  Enrollment and Bootstrapping\n   The RELOAD HIP BONE instance uses the enrollment\
    \ and bootstrap\n   procedure defined by RELOAD [RFC6940] with the exceptions\
    \ listed\n   below.\n   o  In RELOAD, a node wishing to enroll in an overlay starts\
    \ with\n      obtaining a configuration document as explained in [RFC6940].\n\
    \      This specification extends the RELOAD overlay configuration\n      document\
    \ as defined in Section 10.\n   o  The X.509 certificates used by the RELOAD HIP\
    \ BONE instance are\n      similar to those of RELOAD except that they contain\
    \ HITs instead\n      of RELOAD URIs.  The HITs are included in the SubjectAltName\
    \ field\n      of the certificate as described in [RFC6253].\n   o  When contacting\
    \ a bootstrap node, instead of forming a Datagram\n      Transport Layer Security\
    \ (DTLS) or TLS connection, the host MUST\n      perform a HIP base exchange with\
    \ the bootstrap node.  The base\n      exchange MAY be performed using a HIP rendezvous\
    \ or relay server.\n"
- title: 9.  NAT Traversal
  contents:
  - "9.  NAT Traversal\n   RELOAD relies on the Forwarding and Link Management Layer\
    \ providing\n   NAT traversal capabilities.  Thus, the RELOAD HIP BONE instance\n\
    \   implementations MUST implement some reliable NAT traversal mechanism.\n  \
    \ To maximize interoperability, all implementations SHOULD implement at\n   least\
    \ [RFC5770].\n   HIP relay servers are not necessarily needed with this HIP BONE\n\
    \   instance since the overlay network can be used for relaying the base\n   exchange,\
    \ and further HIP signaling can be done directly between the\n   peers.  However,\
    \ if it is possible that a bootstrap peer is behind a\n   NAT, it MUST register\
    \ with a HIP relay so that there is a reliable\n   way to connect to it.\n"
- title: 10.  RELOAD Overlay Configuration Document Extension
  contents:
  - "10.  RELOAD Overlay Configuration Document Extension\n   This document modifies\
    \ the bootstrap-node element of the RELOAD\n   overlay configuration document.\
    \  The modified bootstrap-node element\n   contains the following attributes:\n\
    \   address:  The locator of the bootstrap node.\n   port:  The HIP port of the\
    \ bootstrap node.\n   hit:  The HIT of the bootstrap node.\n   If the bootstrap-node\
    \ element does not contain a HIT, the\n   opportunistic mode (as specified in\
    \ [RFC5201]) SHOULD be used for\n   contacting the bootstrap node.  If the element\
    \ does not contain a\n   port number, the bootstrap node SHOULD be contacted by\
    \ starting the\n   base exchange as defined in [RFC5201].  Otherwise, the base\
    \ exchange\n   MUST be started with UDP encapsulation, as defined in [RFC5770],\n\
    \   using the given port as the destination port number.\n   A RELOAD HIP BONE\
    \ overlay MUST use the Overlay Link Protocol type\n   \"HIP\" in the configuration\

    \ the overlay-link-protocol element and\n   proceed with procedures defined in\
    \ this document only if the \"HIP\"\n   link type is found.\n   This document\
    \ also adds a new element inside the configuration\n   element that defines which\

    \ The name of the element is\n   \"hipbone-id-mode\" and the content is the identifier\
    \ of the mode:\n   \"ORCHID\" for the ORCHID prefixed IDs and \"RELOAD\" for the\
    \ IDs that\n   use the whole 128 bits as defined by the RELOAD specification.\
    \  The\n   NodeIdLength MUST be set to 16 in the configuration document, and the\n\
    \   16 bytes are used, depending on the generation mode, as defined in\n   Section\
    \ 4.\n"

  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of RELOAD (Section\
    \ 13 of [RFC6940]), with\n   the exception of TLS-specific features, also apply\

    \ into 128 bits (or 100 bits\n   with ORCHID prefixes) results in a higher probability\
