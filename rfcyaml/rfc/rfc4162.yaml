  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites
    to the TLS\n   protocol [TLS] to support the SEED encryption algorithm as a bulk\n
    \  cipher algorithm.\n"

    - "1.1.  SEED\n   SEED is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was developed
      by Korea\n   Information Security Agency (KISA) and a group of experts, beginning\n
      \  in 1998.  The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the key\n   length
      is also 128-bit.  SEED has the 16-round Feistel structure.  A\n   128-bit input
      is divided into two 64-bit blocks and the right 64-bit\n   block is an input
      to the round function with a 64-bit subkey\n   generated from the key scheduling.\n
      \  SEED is easily implemented in various software and hardware because\n   it
      is designed to increase the efficiency of memory storage and the\n   simplicity
      of generating keys without degrading the security of the\n   algorithm.  In
      particular, it can be effectively adopted in a\n   computing environment that
      has a restricted resources such as mobile\n   devices, smart cards, and so on.\n
      \  SEED is a national industrial association standard [TTASSEED] and is\n   widely
      used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial\n   services operated
      on wired & wireless PKI.\n   The algorithm specification and object identifiers
      are described in\n   [SEED-ALG].  The SEED homepage,\n   http://www.kisa.or.kr/seed/seed_eng.html,
      contains a wealth of\n   information about SEED, including detailed specification,
      evaluation\n   report, test vectors, and so on.\n"

      \  chaining (CBC) mode as a bulk cipher algorithm.  SEED is a 128-bit\n   block
      cipher with 128-bit key size.\n"

      certificate and\n   key exchange method.  They use the following options:\n

      of the terms RSA, DH_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA,\n   and DH_anon, please

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   It is not believed that the new cipher suites
    are less secure than\n   the corresponding older ones.  No security problem has
    been found on\n   SEED.  SEED is robust against known attacks, including differential\n
    \  cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, and related key attacks, etc.\n   SEED
    has gone through wide public scrutinizing procedures.\n   Especially, it has been
    evaluated and also considered\n   cryptographically secure by trustworthy organizations
    such as ISO/IEC\n   JTC 1/SC 27 and Japan CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and
    Evaluation\n   Committees) [ISOSEED] [CRYPTREC].  SEED has been submitted to several\n
    \  other standardization bodies such as ISO (ISO/IEC 18033-3) and IETF\n   S/MIME
    Mail Security [SEED-SMIME]; and it is under consideration.\n   For further security
    considerations, the reader is encouraged to read\n   [SEED-EVAL].\n   For other
    security considerations, please refer to the security of\n   the corresponding
    older cipher suites described in [TLS] and\n   [AES-TLS].\n"
