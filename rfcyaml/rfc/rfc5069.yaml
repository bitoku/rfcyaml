  - "1.  Introduction\n   Legacy telephone network users can summon help for emergency\
    \ services\n   (such as an ambulance, the fire department, and the police) using\
    \ a\n   well known number (e.g., 911 in North America, 112 in Europe).  A key\n\
    \   factor in the handling of such calls is the ability of the system to\n   determine\
    \ caller location and to route the call to the appropriate\n   Public Safety Answering\
    \ Point (PSAP) based on that location.  With\n   the introduction of IP-based\
    \ telephony and multimedia services,\n   support for emergency calling via the\
    \ Internet also has to be\n   provided.  Two core components of IP-based emergency\
    \ calling include\n   an emergency service identifier and a mapping protocol.\
    \  The\n   emergency service identifier indicates that the call signaling\n  \
    \ establishes an emergency call, while the mapping protocol translates\n   the\
    \ emergency service identifier and the caller's geographic location\n   into an\
    \ appropriate PSAP URL.\n   Attacks against the Public Switched Telephone Network\
    \ (PSTN) have\n   taken place for decades.  The Internet is seen as an even more\n\
    \   hostile environment.  Thus, it is important to understand the types\n   of\
    \ attacks that might be mounted against the infrastructure providing\n   emergency\
    \ services and to develop security mechanisms to counter\n   those attacks.  While\
    \ this can be a broad topic, the present document\n   restricts itself to attacks\
    \ on the mapping of locations to PSAP URIs\n   and attacks based on emergency\
    \ marking.  Verification by the PSAP\n   operator of the truthfulness of a reported\
    \ incident and various other\n   attacks against the PSAP infrastructure related\
    \ to the usage of faked\n   location information are outside the scope of the\
    \ document.\n   This document is organized as follows: Section 2 describes basic\n\
    \   terminology.  Section 3 briefly describes how emergency marking and\n   mapping\
    \ fit within the process of routing emergency calls.  Section 4\n   describes\
    \ some motivations of attackers in the context of emergency\n   calling, Section\
    \ 5 describes and illustrates the attacks that might\n   be used, and Section\
    \ 6 lists the security-related requirements that\n   must be met if these attacks\
    \ are to be mitigated.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119],\
    \ with the\n   qualification that unless otherwise stated, they apply to the design\n\
    \   of the mapping protocol, not its implementation or application.\n   The terms\
    \ \"call taker\", \"mapping service\", \"emergency caller\",\n   \"emergency identifier\"\
    , \"mapping\", \"mapping client\", \"mapping\n   server\", \"mapping protocol\"\
    , and \"Public Safety Answering Point\n   (PSAP)\" are taken from [RFC5012].\n\
    \   The term \"location information\" is taken from RFC 3693 [RFC3693].\n   The\
    \ term \"emergency caller's device\" designates the IP host closest\n   to the\
    \ emergency caller in the signalling path between the emergency\n   caller and\
    \ the PSAP.  Examples include an IP phone running SIP,\n   H.323, or a proprietary\
    \ signalling protocol, a PC running a soft\n   client or an analogue terminal\
    \ adapter, or a residential gateway\n   controlled by a softswitch.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Marking, Mapping, and the Emergency Call Routing Process\n   This memo deals\
    \ with two topics relating to the routing of emergency\n   calls to their proper\
    \ destination: call marking and mapping.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Call Marking
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Call Marking\n   Marking of call signalling enables entities along the\
    \ signalling path\n   to recognize that a particular signalling message is associated\
    \ with\n   an emergency call.  Signalling containing the emergency identifier\n\
    \   may be given priority treatment, special processing, and/or special\n   routing.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Mapping
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Mapping\n   An important goal of emergency call routing is to ensure that\
    \ any\n   emergency call is routed to a PSAP.  Preferably, the call is routed\n\
    \   to the PSAP responsible for the caller's location, since misrouting\n   consumes\
    \ valuable time while the call taker locates and forwards the\n   call to the\
    \ right PSAP.  As described in [RFC5012], mapping is part\n   of the process of\
    \ achieving this preferable outcome.\n   In brief, mapping involves a mapping\
    \ client, a mapping server, and\n   the protocol that passes between them.  The\
    \ protocol allows the\n   client to pass location information to the mapping server\
    \ and to\n   receive back a URI, which can be used to direct call signalling to\
    \ a\n   PSAP.\n"
- title: 4.  Objectives of Attackers
  contents:
  - "4.  Objectives of Attackers\n   Attackers may direct their efforts either against\
    \ a portion of the\n   emergency response system or against an individual.  Attacks\
    \ against\n   the emergency response system have three possible objectives:\n\
    \   o  to deny system services to all users in a given area.  The\n      motivation\
    \ may range from thoughtless vandalism, to wide-scale\n      criminality, to terrorism.\
    \  One interesting variant on this\n      motivation is the case where a victim\
    \ of a large emergency hopes\n      to gain faster service by blocking others'\
    \ competing calls for\n      help.\n   o  to gain fraudulent use of services,\
    \ by using an emergency\n      identifier to bypass normal authentication, authorization,\
    \ and\n      accounting procedures.\n   o  to divert emergency calls to non-emergency\
    \ sites.  This is a form\n      of a denial-of-service attack similar to the first\
    \ item, but quite\n      likely more confusing for the caller himself or herself\
    \ since the\n      caller expects to talk to a PSAP operator but instead gets\n\
    \      connected to someone else.\n   Attacks against an individual fall into\
    \ two classes:\n   o  attacks to prevent an individual from receiving aid.\n \
    \  o  attacks to gain information about an emergency that can be applied\n   \
    \   either against an individual involved in that emergency or to the\n      profit\
    \ of the attacker.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Attacks Involving the Emergency Identifier
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Attacks Involving the Emergency Identifier\n   The main possibility of\
    \ attack involves use of the emergency\n   identifier to bypass the normal procedures\
    \ in order to achieve\n   fraudulent use of services.  An attack of this sort\
    \ is possible only\n   if the following conditions are true:\n   a.  The attacker\
    \ is the emergency caller.\n   b.  The call routing system assumes that the emergency\
    \ caller's\n       device signals the correct PSAP URI for the caller's location.\n\
    \   c.  The call enters the domain of a service provider, which accepts\n    \
    \   it without applying normal procedures for authentication and\n       authorization\
    \ because the signalling carries the emergency\n       identifier.\n   d.  The\
    \ service provider routes the call according to the called\n       address (e.g.,\
    \ SIP Request-URI), without verifying that this is\n       the address of a PSAP\
    \ (noting that a URI by itself does not\n       indicate the nature of the entity\
    \ it is pointing to).\n   If these conditions are satisfied, the attacker can\
    \ bypass normal\n   service provider authorization procedures for arbitrary destinations,\n\
    \   simply by reprogramming the emergency caller's device to add the\n   emergency\
    \ identifier to non-emergency call signalling.  In this case,\n   the call signalling\
    \ most likely will not include any location\n   information, or there could be\
    \ location information, but it is false.\n   An attacker wishing to disrupt the\
    \ emergency call routing system may\n   use a similar technique to target components\
    \ of that system for a\n   denial-of-service attack.  The attacker will find this\
    \ attractive to\n   reach components that handle emergency calls only.  Flooding\
    \ attacks\n   are the most likely application of the technique, but it may also\
    \ be\n   used to identify target components for other attacks by analyzing the\n\
    \   content of responses to the original signalling messages.\n"

  - "5.2.  Attacks Against or Using the Mapping Process\n   This section describes\
    \ classes of attacks involving the mapping\n   process that could be used to achieve\

- title: 5.2.1.  Attacks Against the Emergency Response System
  contents:
  - "5.2.1.  Attacks Against the Emergency Response System\n   This section considers\
    \ attacks intended to reduce the effectiveness\n   of the emergency response system\
    \ for all callers in a given area.  If\n   the mapping operation is disabled,\
    \ then the emergency caller's device\n   might not have the correct PSAP URI.\
    \  As a consequence, the\n   probability that emergency calls will be routed to\
    \ the wrong PSAP\n   increases.  In the worst case, the emergency caller's device\
    \ might\n   not be able to obtain a PSAP URI at all.  Routing to the wrong PSAP\n\
    \   has a double consequence: emergency response to the affected calls is\n  \
    \ delayed, and PSAP call taker resources outside the immediate area of\n   the\
    \ emergency are consumed due to the extra effort required to\n   redirect the\
    \ calls.  Alternatively, attacks that cause the client to\n   receive a URI that\
    \ does not lead to a PSAP have the immediate effect\n   of causing emergency calls\
    \ to fail.\n   Three basic attacks on the mapping process can be identified: denial\n\
    \   of service, impersonation of the mapping server, or corruption of the\n  \
    \ mapping database.  Denial of service can be achieved in several ways:\n   o\
    \  by a flooding attack on the mapping server;\n   o  by taking control of the\
    \ mapping server and either preventing it\n      from responding or causing it\
    \ to send incorrect responses; or\n   o  by taking control of any intermediary\
    \ node (for example, a router)\n      through which the mapping queries and responses\
    \ pass, and then\n      using that control to block them.  An adversary may also\
    \ attempt\n      to modify the mapping protocol signalling messages.  Additionally,\n\
    \      the adversary may be able to replay past communication exchanges\n    \
    \  to fool an emergency caller by returning incorrect results.\n   In an impersonation\
    \ attack, the attacker induces the mapping client\n   to direct its queries to\
    \ a host under the attacker's control rather\n   than the real mapping server,\
    \ or the attacker suppresses the response\n   from the real mapping server and\
    \ sends a spoofed response.\n   The former type of impersonation attack itself\
    \ is an issue of mapping\n   server discovery rather than the mapping protocol\
    \ directly.  However,\n   the mapping protocol may allow impersonation to be detected,\
    \ thereby\n   preventing acceptance of responses from an impersonating entity\
    \ and\n   possibly triggering a more secure discovery procedure.\n   Corruption\
    \ of the mapping database cannot be mitigated directly by\n   mapping protocol\
    \ design.  Once corruption has been detected, the\n   mapping protocol may have\
    \ a role to play in determining which records\n   have been corrupted.\n   Beyond\
    \ these attacks on the mapping operation itself, it is possible\n   to use mapping\
    \ to attack other entities.  One possibility is that\n   mapping clients are misled\
    \ into sending mapping queries to the target\n   of the attack instead of the\
    \ mapping server.  Prevention of such an\n   attack is an operational issue rather\
    \ than one of protocol design.\n   Another possible attack is where the mapping\
    \ server is tricked into\n   sending responses to the target of the attack through\
    \ spoofing of the\n   source address in the query.\n"
- title: 5.2.2.  Attacks to Prevent a Specific Individual from Receiving Aid
  contents:
  - "5.2.2.  Attacks to Prevent a Specific Individual from Receiving Aid\n   If an\
    \ attacker wishes to deny emergency service to a specific\n   individual, the\
    \ mass attacks described in Section 5.2.1 will\n   obviously work provided that\
    \ the target individual is within the\n   affected population.  Except for the\
    \ flooding attack on the mapping\n   server, the attacker can in theory limit\
    \ these attacks to the target,\n   but this requires extra effort that the attacker\
    \ is unlikely to\n   expend.  If the attacker is using a mass attack but does\
    \ not wish to\n   have too broad an effect, it is more likely to attack for a\
    \ carefully\n   limited period of time.\n   If the attacker wants to be selective,\
    \ however, it may make more\n   sense to attack the mapping client rather than\
    \ the mapping server.\n   This is particularly so if the mapping client is the\
    \ emergency\n   caller's device.  The choices available to the attacker are similar\n\
    \   to those for denial of service on the server side:\n   o  a flooding attack\
    \ on the mapping client;\n   o  taking control of any intermediary node (for example,\
    \ a router)\n      through which the mapping queries and responses pass, and then\n\
    \      using that control to block or modify them.\n   Taking control of the mapping\
    \ client is also a logical possibility,\n   but raises no issues for the mapping\
    \ protocol.\n"
- title: 5.2.3.  Attacks to Gain Information about an Emergency
  contents:
  - "5.2.3.  Attacks to Gain Information about an Emergency\n   This section discusses\
    \ attacks used to gain information about an\n   emergency.  The attacker may be\
    \ seeking the location of the caller\n   (e.g., to effect a criminal attack).\
    \  Alternatively, the attacker may\n   be seeking information that could be used\
    \ to link an individual (the\n   caller or someone else involved in the emergency)\
    \ with embarrassing\n   information related to the emergency (e.g., \"Who did\
    \ the police take\n   away just now?\").  Finally, the attacker could be seeking\
    \ to profit\n   from the emergency, perhaps by offering his or her services (e.g.,\
    \ a\n   news reporter, or a lawyer aggressively seeking new business).\n   The\
    \ primary information that interceptions of mapping requests and\n   responses\
    \ will reveal are a location, a URI identifying a PSAP, the\n   emergency service\
    \ identifier, and the addresses of the mapping client\n   and server.  The location\
    \ information can be directly useful to an\n   attacker if the attacker has high\
    \ assurance that the observed query\n   is related to an emergency involving the\
    \ target.  The type of\n   emergency (fire, police, or ambulance) might also be\
    \ revealed by the\n   emergency service identifier in the mapping query.  The\
    \ other pieces\n   of information may provide the basis for further attacks on\
    \ emergency\n   call routing, but because of the time factor, are unlikely to\
    \ be\n   applicable to the routing of the current call.  However, if the\n   mapping\
    \ client is the emergency caller's device, the attacker may\n   gain information\
    \ that allows for interference with the call after it\n   has been set up or for\
    \ interception of the media stream between the\n   caller and the PSAP.\n"
