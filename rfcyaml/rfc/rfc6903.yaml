- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The fundamental model for web links and the \"Link Relations\"\
    \ registry\n   are established by [RFC5988].  This specification defines and adds\n\
    \   the following additional link relation types to the registry:\n   \"about\"\
    , \"preview\", \"privacy-policy\", \"terms-of-service\", and \"type\".\n"
- title: 2.  "about"
  contents:
  - "2.  \"about\"\n   The \"about\" link relation can be used to refer to a resource\
    \ that is\n   the subject or topic of the link's context.  Multiple subjects can\
    \ be\n   indicated through the use of multiple \"about\" link relations.\n   For\
    \ example, if the context resource is a review about a particular\n   product,\
    \ the \"about\" link can be used to reference the URL of the\n   product:\n  \
    \   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n     Content-Type: application/json\n     Link: <http://store.example.org/product/abc>;\
    \ rel=\"about\"\n     {...}\n"
- title: 3.  "preview"
  contents:
  - "3.  \"preview\"\n   The \"preview\" link relation can be used to refer to a resource\
    \ that\n   serves as a preview of the link's context, likely with reduced\n  \
    \ quality or limited content.  For instance, the preview link might\n   reference\
    \ a screen capture of a video, a brief snippet of audio from\n   a song, or a\
    \ thumbnail representation of an image.\n   For example, issuing an HTTP HEAD\
    \ request to a URI representing a\n   large video or image file might return a\
    \ link to a short or lower-\n   quality preview of the original:\n     HTTP/1.1\
    \ 200 OK\n     Content-Text: video/mpeg\n     Link: <http://example.org/preview/10-second-preview.mpg>;\n\
    \       rel=\"preview\"; type=\"video/mpeg\"\n"
- title: 4.  "privacy-policy"
  contents:
  - "4.  \"privacy-policy\"\n   The \"privacy-policy\" link relation can be used to\
    \ refer to a resource\n   describing the privacy policy associated with the link's\
    \ context.\n   The privacy policy can be any resource that discloses what personal\n\
    \   information about the user is collected and how that personal\n   information\
    \ is stored, used, managed, and disclosed to other parties.\n   For example, an\
    \ HTTP server that collects personal information about\n   a user throughout the\
    \ course of the user's interaction with the\n   service can include \"privacy-policy\"\
    \ links within all HTTP responses\n   using any combination of Link headers or\
    \ links embedded in the\n   response payload:\n     HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n     Content-Type:\
    \ text/html\n     <html>\n       <head>\n         ...\n         <link rel=\"privacy-policy\"\
    \ href=\"/privacy-policy.html\" />\n         ...\n       </head>\n       <body>\n\
    \         ...\n       </body>\n     </html>\n   Note that in the absence of clear\
    \ legal obligations placed on an\n   entity, either through contract or law, the\
    \ presence of a \"privacy-\n   policy\" link does not constitute a legally binding\
    \ obligation on the\n   part of the service.  The linked resource can only be\
    \ interpreted as\n   a description of the expected practice.\n   It is recommended\
    \ that publishers of privacy-policy resources linked\n   to using the \"privacy-policy\"\
    \ link relation provide a clear and\n   simple mechanism for signaling when changes\
    \ to the privacy-policy\n   resource have been made, such as generating a new\
    \ Entity Tag for the\n   resource or generating a hash over the privacy policy's\
    \ content.  The\n   extent to which mechanisms are utilized is out of the scope\
    \ of this\n   specification, however.\n"
- title: 4.1.  The "privacy-policy" Link Relation and P3P
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The \"privacy-policy\" Link Relation and P3P\n   The Platform for Privacy\
    \ Preferences [P3P] is a W3C Recommendation\n   that defines a data format for\
    \ the expression of privacy policy\n   information.  While the \"privacy-policy\"\
    \ link relation can be used to\n   reference P3P documents, there is no intended\
    \ relationship, normative\n   or otherwise, between this specification and the\
    \ P3P Recommendation.\n   As far as this specification is concerned, P3P documents\
    \ are just one\n   possible type of resource that \"privacy-policy\" links can\
    \ reference.\n"
- title: 5.  "terms-of-service"
  contents:
  - "5.  \"terms-of-service\"\n   The \"terms-of-service\" link relation can be used\
    \ to refer to a\n   resource describing the terms of service associated with the\
    \ link's\n   context.  The terms of service can be any resource that describes\
    \ the\n   rules to which a consumer of the service must agree to follow when\n\
    \   using the service provided by the link's context.\n   For example, an HTTP\
    \ server can include \"terms-of-service\" links\n   within all HTTP responses\
    \ using any combination of Link headers or\n   links embedded in the response\
    \ payload:\n     HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n     Content-Type: text/html\n     <html>\n\
    \       <head>\n         ...\n         <link rel=\"terms-of-service\" href=\"\
    /tos.html\">\n         ...\n       </head>\n       <body>\n         ...\n    \
    \   </body>\n     </html>\n   It must be noted that the terms of service linked\
    \ to using this link\n   relation carry no legal weight and can be ignored with\
    \ impunity in\n   the absence of an explicit, legally enforceable contract.  The\
    \ linked\n   terms of service are simply a notice of the terms that may be\n \
    \  expected to apply once a contract is established.\n"
- title: 6.  "type"
  contents:
  - "6.  \"type\"\n   The \"type\" link relation can be used to indicate that the\
    \ context\n   resource is an instance of the resource identified by the target\n\
    \   Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI).\n     HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n     Content-Type:\
    \ text/plain\n     Link: <http://example.org/Person/givenName>; rel=\"type\"\n\
    \     Sally\n   When used within the header of an HTTP message, the type specified\
    \ by\n   the \"type\" link relation cannot be confused with the content type of\n\
    \   the payload as given by the Content-Type header.  The \"type\" link\n   relation\
    \ references the payload's abstract semantic type, whereas the\n   Content-Type\
    \ header identifies the specific serialization format of\n   the payload.\n  \
    \ If the context can be considered to be an instance of multiple\n   semantic\
    \ types, multiple \"type\" link relations can be used.\n"
