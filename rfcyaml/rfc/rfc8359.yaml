  - "1.  Introduction\n   A functional description of the Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label\n   Switching (GMPLS) signaling extensions for setting up a bidirectional\n
    \  Label Switched Path (LSP) is provided in [RFC3471].  The GMPLS\n   Resource
    reSerVation Protocol with Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)\n   extensions for setting
    up a bidirectional LSP are specified in\n   [RFC3473].  The bidirectional LSP
    setup is indicated by the presence\n   of an UPSTREAM_LABEL object in the Path
    message.  As per the existing\n   setup procedure outlined for a bidirectional
    LSP, each upstream node\n   must allocate a valid upstream label on the outgoing
    interface before\n   sending the initial Path message downstream.  However, there
    are\n   certain scenarios (see Section 4) where it is not desirable or\n   possible
    for a given node to pick the upstream label on its own.\n   This document defines
    the protocol mechanism to be used in such\n   scenarios.  This mechanism enables
    a given node to offload the task\n   of assigning the upstream label for a given
    bidirectional LSP to\n   nodes downstream in the network.  It is meant to be used
    only for\n   bidirectional LSPs that assign symmetric labels at each hop along
    the\n   path of the LSP.  Bidirectional Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) LSPs use\n
    \  symmetric lambda labels (format specified in [RFC6205]) at each hop\n   along
    the path of the LSP.\n   As per the bidirectional LSP setup procedures specified
    in [RFC3471]\n   and [RFC3473], the UPSTREAM_LABEL object must indicate a label
    that\n   is valid for forwarding.  This document updates that by allowing the\n
    \  UPSTREAM_LABEL object to indicate a special label that isn't valid\n   for
    forwarding.  As per the bidirectional LSC LSP setup procedures\n   specified in
    [RFC6205], the LABEL_SET object and the UPSTREAM_LABEL\n   object must contain
    the same label value.  This document updates that\n   by allowing the UPSTREAM_LABEL
    object to carry a special label value\n   that is different from the one used
    in the LABEL_SET object.\n"

    the downstream node to provide a\n   label that it can use in both the forward
    and reverse directions.\n   The presence of this value in the UPSTREAM_LABEL object
    of a Path\n   message MUST also be interpreted by the receiving node as a request\n
    \  to mandate symmetric labels for the LSP.\n"

    - "3.1.  Procedures\n   The scope of the procedures is limited to the exchange
      and processing\n   of messages between an upstream node and its immediate downstream\n
      \  node.  The Unassigned Upstream Label is used by an upstream node when\n   it
      is not in a position to pick the upstream label on its own.  In\n   such a scenario,
      the upstream node sends a Path message downstream\n   with an Unassigned Upstream
      Label and requests the downstream node to\n   provide a symmetric label.  If
      the upstream node desires to make the\n   downstream node aware of its limitations
      with respect to label\n   selection, it MUST specify a list of valid labels
      via the LABEL_SET\n   object as specified in [RFC3473].\n   In response, the
      downstream node picks an appropriate symmetric label\n   and sends it via the
      LABEL object in the Resv message.  The upstream\n   node would then start using
      this symmetric label for both directions\n   of the LSP.  If the downstream
      node cannot pick the symmetric label,\n   it MUST issue a PathErr message with
      a \"Routing Problem/Unacceptable\n   Label Value\" indication.  If the upstream
      node that signals an\n   Unassigned Upstream Label receives a label with the
      \"all-ones\"\n   pattern or any other unacceptable label in the LABEL object
      of the\n   Resv message, it MUST issue a ResvErr message with a \"Routing\n
      \  Problem/Unacceptable Label Value\" indication.\n   The upstream node will
      continue to signal the Unassigned Upstream\n   Label in the Path message even
      after it receives an appropriate\n   symmetric label in the Resv message.  This
      is done to make sure that\n   the downstream node would pick a different symmetric
      label if and\n   when it needs to change the label at a later time.  If the
      upstream\n   node receives an unacceptable changed label, then it MUST issue
      a\n   ResvErr message with a \"Routing Problem/Unacceptable Label Value\"\n

      that doesn't\n   support the semantics of an Unassigned UPSTREAM LABEL, it will
      either\n   (a) reject the special label value and generate an error as specified\n
      \  in Section 3.1 of [RFC3473] or (b) accept it and treat it as a valid\n   label.\n
      \  If the behavior that is exhibited is (a), then there are no backwards\n   compatibility
      concerns.  If the behavior that is exhibited is (b),\n   then the downstream
      node will send a label with the \"all-ones\"\n   pattern in the LABEL object
      of the Resv message.  In response, the\n   upstream node will issue a ResvErr
      message with a \"Routing Problem/\n   Unacceptable Label Value\" indication.\n"

  - "4.  Use-Case: Wavelength Setup for IP over Optical Networks\n   Consider the
    network topology depicted in Figure 3.  Nodes A and B\n   are client IP routers
    that are connected to an optical Wavelength\n   Division Multiplexing (WDM) transport
    network.  F and I represent WDM\n   nodes.  The transponder sits on the router
    and is directly connected\n   to the add-drop port on a WDM node.\n   The optical
    signal originating on \"Router A\" is tuned to a particular\n   wavelength.  On
    \"WDM-Node F\", it gets multiplexed with optical\n   signals at other wavelengths.
    \ Depending on the implementation of\n   this multiplexing function, it may not
    be acceptable to have the\n   router send the signal into the optical network
    unless it is at the\n   appropriate wavelength.  In other words, having the router
    send\n   signals with a wrong wavelength may adversely impact existing optical\n
    \  trails.  If the clients do not have full visibility into the optical\n   network,
    they are not in a position to pick the correct wavelength in\n   advance.\n   The
    rest of this section examines how the protocol mechanism proposed\n   in this
    document allows the optical network to select and communicate\n   the correct
    wavelength to its clients.\n"

      \ It sends a Path message downstream requesting\n      the network to assign
      an appropriate symmetric label for its use.\n      Since the client wavelength
      is unknown, the laser is off at the\n      ingress client.\n   o  The downstream
      node (Node F) receives the Path message, chooses\n      the appropriate wavelength
      values, and forwards them in\n      appropriate label fields to the egress client
      (\"Router B\").\n   o  \"Router B\" receives the Path message, turns the laser
      ON and tunes\n      it to the appropriate wavelength (received in the UPSTREAM_LABEL/\n
      \     LABEL_SET of the Path) and sends a Resv message upstream.\n   o  The Resv
      message received by the ingress client carries a valid\n      symmetric label
      in the LABEL object.  \"Router A\" turns on the\n      laser and tunes it to
      the wavelength specified in the network\n      assigned symmetric LABEL.\n   For
      cases where the egress-node relies on RSVP signaling to determine\n   exactly
      when to start using the LSP, implementations may choose to\n   integrate the
      above sequence with any of the existing graceful setup\n   procedures:\n   o
      \ \"ResvConf\" setup procedure ([RFC2205])\n   o  Two-step \"ADMIN STATUS\"
