Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for information related to routing within a Fibre Channel fabric, which is independent of the usage of a particular routing protocol.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for information related to the Fibre Channel network's Routing Table for routing within a Fabric.
Managed objects specific to particular routing protocols, such as the Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol [FC SW 4], are not specified in this MIB module.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Short Overview of Fibre Channel 3.1.
The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point to point serial data channel, structured for high performance.
Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols, such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High  Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.
Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple communication points, called N Ports, interconnected either by a switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point to point link.
A Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N Ports.
A Fabric may consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are switches.
An N Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch called an F Port.
When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port is called an FL Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL Ports.
Nx Port is used to refer to either an N Port or an NL Port.
Fx Port is used to refer to either an F Port or an FL Port.
A switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an Inter Switch Link (ISL), is called an E Port.
A B Port connects a bridge device with an E Port on a switch; a B Port provides a subset of E Port functionality.
Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and most ports, have globally unique names.
These globally unique names are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).
More information on WWNs can be found in [FC FS].
WWNs are expected to be persistent across agent and unit resets.
Fibre Channel frames contain 24 bit address identifiers that identify the frame's source and destination ports.
Each FC port has both an address identifier and a WWN.
When a fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
Each octet of a 24 bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy, a Domain ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.
The routing of frames within the Fabric is normally based on the standard routing protocol, called the Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) protocol.
The operation of FSPF (or of any other routing protocol) allows a switch to generate and maintain its own routing table of how to forward frames it receives; i.e., a table in which to look up the destination address of a received frame in order to determine the best link by which to forward that frame towards its destination.
The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple Fabric Switch elements is [FC SW 4] (which replaces the previous revision, [FC SW 3]).
[FC SW 4] carries forward the existing specification for the operation of a single Fabric in a physical infrastructure, augmenting it with the definition of Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how multiple Virtual Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.
The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in its header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that frame is being transmitted on.
All frames entering a particular "Core Switch" [FC SW 4]
(i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual Fabric are processed by the same "Virtual Switch" within that Core switch.
The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focussed on Fibre Channel switches.
It is being replaced by the more generic Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC MGMT], which defines basic information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to the standard IF MIB [RFC2863] for Fibre Channel interfaces.
This MIB extends beyond [FC MGMT] to cover the routing of traffic within a Fabric of a Fibre Channel network.
The standard routing protocol for Fibre Channel is FSPF
Another MIB [RFC4626] specifies management information specific to FSPF.
This MIB contains routing information that is independent of FSPF (i.e., it would still apply even if a routing protocol other than FSPF were in use in the network).
This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions from T11 TC MIB, defined in [RFC4439].
This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of, and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of the FSPF protocol.
(Note that there are no definitions in this MIB module of "managed actions" that can be invoked via SNMP.)
Fibre Channel Management Instance A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC MGMT] as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.
Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for the implementation(s).
For example, one such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent with multiple AgentX
[RFC2741] sub agents, each sub agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.
The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB [FC MGMT]
as the index value that uniquely identifies each Fibre Channel management instance within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411], Section 3.3.1).
The FC MGMT MIB [FC MGMT] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by Fibre Channel management instances.
Each Fibre Channel management instance can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.
The Switch Index, fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB as the index value that uniquely identifies a Fibre Channel switch among those (one or more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.
Whether operating on a physical Fabric (i.e., without Virtual Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the operation of FSPF within a Fabric is identical.
Therefore, this MIB defines all Fabric related information in tables that are INDEX ed by an arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index", the syntax of which is IMPORTed from the T11 TC MIB.
When a device is connected to a single physical Fabric, without use of any virtual Fabrics, the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.
In an environment of multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics, this index provides a means to distinguish one Fabric from another.
It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel switch will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics.
Thus, in order to simplify a management protocol query concerning all the Fabrics to which a single switch is connected, fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FcRouteFabricIndex when they both appear in the same INDEX clause.
This MIB contains one object group, the t11FcRouteGroup, which contains objects to allow the displaying and the configuring of routes in the Fibre Channel Routing tables for the locally managed switches.
It is normally valuable for a MIB table that contains routes to be ordered such that a management application is able to query the table based on some attribute, without having to read every row in the MIB table.
This requires that the rows in the table be ordered according to such attributes, and thus that those attributes be represented by objects included in the table's INDEX clause.
Examples of this can be seen in the ipCidrRouteTable [RFC2096] and, more recently, the inetCidrRouteTable in [RFC4292].
While this useful feature results in an unusually large number (ten) of objects in the t11FcRouteTable's INDEX clause, all ten are either integers or strings of 3 (or zero) octet length, so the resulting OIDs are not unusually large.
(Specifically, the aggregate number of sub identifiers to be appended to an OBJECT TYPE's OID, when naming an instance of an object in the t11FcRouteTable, is at most 22 sub  identifiers; i.e., less than the  minimum  number to be appended for the inetCidrRouteTable table.)

This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4625;  see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
"The table containing Fibre Channel Routing information that is specific to a Fabric."
{ t11FcRouteObjects 1 } t11FcRouteFabricEntry OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"Each entry contains routing information specific to a particular Fabric on a particular switch (identified by values of fcmInstanceIndex and fcmSwitchIndex).
t11FcRouteFabricLastChange TimeStamp } t11FcRouteFabricIndex OBJECT
current DESCRIPTION "A unique index value that uniquely identifies a particular Fabric.
In a Fabric conformant to FC SW 3, only a single Fabric can operate within a physical infrastructure, and thus the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.
In a Fabric conformant to FC SW 4, multiple Virtual Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.
In such a case, index value is used to uniquely identify a particular Fabric within a physical infrastructure."
"The value of sysUpTime at the most recent time when any corresponding row in the t11FcRouteTable was created, modified, or deleted.
A corresponding row in the t11FcRouteTable is for the same management instance, the same switch, and same Fabric as the row in this table.
If no change has occurred since the last restart of the management system, then the value of this object is 0."
SEQUENCE OF T11FcRouteEntry MAX ACCESS
"The Fibre Channel Routing tables for the locally managed switches.
This table lists all the routes that are configured in and/or computed by any local switch for any Fabric.
Such routes are used by a switch to forward frames (of user data) on a Fabric.
The conceptual process is based on extracting the Destination Fibre Channel Address Identifier (D ID) out of a received frame (of user data) and comparing it to each entry of this table that is applicable to the given switch and Fabric.
Such comparison consists of first performing a logical AND of the extracted D ID with a mask (the value of t11FcRouteDestMask) and second comparing the result of that 'AND' operation to the value of t11FcRouteDestAddrId.
A similar comparison is made of the Source Fibre Channel Address Identifier (S ID) of a frame against the t11FcRouteSrcAddrId and t11FcRouteSrcMask values of an entry.
If an entry's value of t11FcRouteInInterface is non zero, then a further comparison determines if the frame was received on the appropriate interface.
If all of these comparisons for a particular entry are successful, then that entry represents a potential route for forwarding the received frame.
For entries configured by a user, t11FcRouteProto has the value 'netmgmt'; only entries of this type can be deleted by the user."
"Each entry contains a route to a particular destination, possibly from a particular subset of source addresses, on a particular Fabric via a particular output interface and learned in a particular manner.

"The destination Fibre Channel Address Identifier of this route.
A zero length string for this field is not allowed."
{ t11FcRouteEntry 1 } t11FcRouteDestMask OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"The mask to be logical ANDed with a destination Fibre Channel Address Identifier before it is compared to the value in the t11FcRouteDestAddrId field.
Allowed values are 255.255.255, 255.255.0, or 255.0.0.
FSPF's definition generates routes to a Domain ID, so the mask for all FSPF generated routes is 255.0.0.
The zero length value has the same meaning as 0.0.0."
"The source Fibre Channel Address Identifier of this route.
Note that if this object and the corresponding instance of t11FcRouteSrcMask both have a value of 0.0.0, then this route matches all source addresses.
The zero length value has the same meaning as 0.0.0."
"The mask to be logical ANDed with a source Fibre Channel Address Identifier before it is compared to the value in the t11FcRouteSrcAddrId field.
Allowed values are 255.255.255, 255.255.0, 255.0.0, or 0.0.0.
The zero length value has the same meaning as 0.0.0."
"If the value of this object is non zero, it is the value of ifIndex that identifies the local Fibre Channel interface through which a frame must have been received in order to match with this entry.
If the value of this object is zero, the matching does not require that the frame be received on any specific interface."

The only rows that can be deleted by setting this object to 'destroy' are those for which t11FcRouteProto has the value 'netmgmt'."
MODULE COMPLIANCE STATUS    current DESCRIPTION
"The compliance statement for entities that implement the T11 FC ROUTE MIB.
Note: The next four OBJECT clauses are for auxiliary objects, and the   SMIv2 does not permit inclusion of objects that are not accessible   in an OBJECT clause (see Sections 3.1 & 5.4.3 in STD 58, RFC 2580).
Thus, these four clauses cannot be included below in the normal   location for OBJECT clauses.

A collection of objects for displaying and configuring routes."
The IANA has assigned a MIB OID for the T11 FC ROUTE MIB module under the appropriate subtree.
There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability are: t11FcRouteDomainId, t11FcRouteMetric, t11FcRouteType, t11FcRouteIfDown, t11FcRouteRowStatus   configure new routes and/or modify existing routes.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
For example, the ability to change network topology or network speed may afford an attacker the ability to obtain better performance at the expense of other network users.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
The objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability are: the write able objects listed above plus one other: t11FcRouteLastChangeTime   the time of the last routing table change.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
