  - "Abstract\n   The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a protocol\n
    \  for setting up Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels from a remote\n   location
    to a gateway so that the VPN client can access services in\n   the network behind
    the gateway.  This document defines an IKEv2\n   extension that allows an overloaded
    VPN gateway or a VPN gateway that\n   is being shut down for maintenance to redirect
    the VPN client to\n   attach to another gateway.  The proposed mechanism can also
    be used\n   in Mobile IPv6 to enable the home agent to redirect the mobile node\n
    \  to another home agent.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   IKEv2 [2] is used for setting up IPsec-based [7] VPNs.  The
    IP\n   address of the VPN gateway can be configured on the VPN client.  But\n
    \  this does not scale well when the number of VPN gateways is large.\n   Dynamic
    discovery of VPN gateways using DNS is quite widely used too.\n   However, using
    DNS is not flexible when it comes to assigning a VPN\n   gateway to the VPN client
    based on the load on the VPN gateways.  The\n   VPN client typically tries to
    connect to the IP address of the VPN\n   gateway that appears first in the DNS
    response.  If the VPN tunnel\n   setup fails, then the VPN client tries to attach
    to the other VPN\n   gateways returned in the DNS response.\n   This document
    proposes a redirect mechanism for IKEv2 that enables a\n   VPN gateway to redirect
    the VPN client to another VPN gateway, for\n   example, based on the load condition.
    \ The redirect can be done\n   during the IKE_SA_INIT or the IKE_AUTH exchange.
    \ Gateway-initiated\n   redirect in the middle of a session is also supported.
    \ The redirect\n   mechanism can also be used in conjunction with anycast addresses.
    \ In\n   this case, an anycast address for the cluster of VPN gateways is\n   stored
    in the DNS instead of a list of unicast IP addresses of the\n   VPN gateways.\n
    \  The redirect can also happen because of administrative or optimal-\n   routing
    reasons.  This document does not attempt to provide an\n   exhaustive list of
    reasons for redirecting a VPN client to another\n   VPN gateway.\n"

  - "3.  IKEv2 Initial Exchange with Redirect\n   This section describes the use of
    the redirect mechanism during the\n   IKE_SA_INIT exchange.  Gateway-initiated
    redirect during an active\n   session and the use of redirect during IKE_AUTH
    exchange are\n   explained in subsequent sections.\n   The VPN client indicates
    support for the IKEv2 redirect mechanism and\n   its willingness to be redirected
    by including a REDIRECT_SUPPORTED\n   notification message in the initial IKE_SA_INIT
    request (see\n   Section 9.1).  The gateway MUST keep track of those clients that\n
    \  indicated support for the redirect mechanism and those that didn't.\n   To
    redirect an IKEv2 session to another VPN gateway, the VPN gateway\n   that initially
    received the IKE_SA_INIT request selects another VPN\n   gateway (how the selection
    is made is beyond the scope of this\n   document) and replies with an IKE_SA_INIT
    response containing a\n   REDIRECT notification message (see Section 9.2).  The
    notification\n   includes information about the selected VPN gateway and the nonce\n
    \  data from the Ni payload in the IKE_SA_INIT request.  If the\n   IKE_SA_INIT
    request did not indicate support for the redirect\n   mechanism, the responder
    MUST NOT send the REDIRECT payload to the\n   VPN client.  This is applicable
    to all REDIRECT scenarios described\n   in this document.\n   Note that when the
    IKE_SA_INIT response includes the REDIRECT\n   notification, the exchange does
    not result in the creation of an\n   IKE_SA and the responder Security Parameter
    Index (SPI) will be zero.\n       Initiator                    Responder (initial
    VPN GW)\n       ---------                    -------------------------\n    (IP_I:500
    -> Initial_IP_R:500)\n    HDR(A,0), SAi1, KEi, Ni,   -->\n    N(REDIRECT_SUPPORTED)\n
    \                             (Initial_IP_R:500 -> IP_I:500)\n                          <--
    HDR(A,0), N(REDIRECT, New_GW_ID, Ni_data)\n   When the client receives the IKE_SA_INIT
    response, it MUST verify\n   that the nonce data matches the value sent in the
    IKE_SA_INIT\n   request.  If the values do not match, the client MUST silently\n
    \  discard the response (and keep waiting for another response).  This\n   prevents
    certain denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the initiator\n   that could be caused
    by an attacker injecting IKE_SA_INIT responses\n   with REDIRECT payloads.\n   After
    verifying the nonce data, the client initiates a new\n   IKE_SA_INIT exchange
    with the VPN gateway listed in the REDIRECT\n   payload, provided this is allowed
    by its Peer Authorization Database\n   (PAD) entries.  In the IKE_SA_INIT exchange
    with the new VPN gateway,\n   the client MUST include the REDIRECTED_FROM payload
    (see\n   Section 9.3).  The VPN client includes the IP address of the original\n
    \  VPN gateway that redirected the client in the REDIRECTED_FROM\n   notification.
    \ The IKEv2 exchange then proceeds as it would have\n   proceeded with the original
    VPN gateway.\n       Initiator                   Responder (Selected VPN GW)\n

    \                             (IP_R:500 -> IP_I:500)\n                          <--

    \                                                SAr2, TSi, TSr}\n   The client
    MAY get redirected again by the new VPN gateway if the new\n   VPN gateway also
    cannot serve the client.  The client does not have\n   to include the REDIRECT_SUPPORTED
    payload again in the IKE_SA_INIT\n   exchange with the new gateway after a redirect.
    \ The presence of the\n   REDIRECT_FROM payload in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange with
    the new\n   gateway indicates to the new gateway that the client supports the\n
    \  redirect mechanism.\n   When the client gets redirected, it MUST use the same
    Peer\n   Authorization Database (PAD) and Security Policy Database (SPD)\n   entries
    as it would have used with the original gateway.  Receiving a\n   redirect notification
    MUST NOT result in the modification of any PAD\n   or SPD entries.  In practice,
    this means the new gateway either has\n   to use the same responder identity (IDr)
    as the original gateway, or\n   both should be part of a group of responders that
    are authorized by\n   the same PAD entry.  See Section 4.4.3.1 of [7] on using
    DNS names to\n   represent a group of peers in a PAD entry.\n   This document
    allows the client to be redirected in several protocol\n   states.  In some of
    them, the gateway is already authenticated at the\n   point of redirect; in others,
    it is not.  We emphasize that the above\n   rules regarding the identity of the
    new gateway and the PAD and SPD\n   entries apply equally to all these scenarios.\n"

  - "4.  Use of Anycast Addresses with the Redirect Mechanism\n   Using anycast addresses
    will avoid the necessity of configuring a\n   particular VPN gateway's IP address
    in the DNS.  Instead, the anycast\n   address that represents the group of VPN
    gateways is stored in the\n   DNS.  When the VPN client performs a DNS lookup
    for the VPN gateway,\n   it receives the anycast address of the VPN gateway in
    the DNS\n   response.\n   If an anycast address is returned in response to the
    DNS resolution\n   of a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), the VPN client sends
    the\n   IKE_SA_INIT request to the anycast address.  The REDIRECT_SUPPORTED\n
    \  payload is included in the IKE_SA_INIT request sent to the anycast\n   address.
    \ The IKE_SA_INIT request is routed to one of the VPN\n   gateways that is part
    of the anycast group.  The VPN gateway that\n   receives the IKE_SA_INIT request
    responds with an IKE_SA_INIT reply\n   from the anycast address.\n       Initiator

    HDR(A,0), N(REDIRECT, New_GW_ID, Ni_data)\n   If the destination address on the
    IKE_SA_INIT request is an anycast\n   address, the VPN gateway that received the
    IKE_SA_INIT request MUST\n   include the REDIRECT payload to redirect the VPN
    client to a unicast\n   address of one of the VPN gateways.  The VPN gateway that
    received\n   the IKE_SA_INIT request MAY redirect the client to its own unicast\n
    \  address if it is not overloaded.\n   The rest of the IKEv2 exchange is the
    same as described in Section 3.\n"

  - "5.  Redirect during an Active Session\n   The redirect mechanism may also be
    used by a VPN gateway to redirect\n   the client to another VPN gateway in the
    middle of a session.  To\n   redirect a client, the gateway should send an INFORMATIONAL
    message\n   with the REDIRECT Notify payload.  The REDIRECT payload MUST carry\n
    \  information about the new VPN gateway.  The gateway MUST NOT include\n   any
    nonce data in the REDIRECT payload, since it is a gateway-\n   initiated redirect
    and is protected by the IKEv2 security\n   association.  When the client receives
    this message, it sends a\n   response (usually empty) to the gateway.  The gateway
    retransmits the\n   redirect INFORMATIONAL message as described in [2], until
    it gets a\n   response.  The following illustrates the INFORMATIONAL message\n
    \  exchange for gateway-initiated redirect.\n       Initiator (VPN client)        Responder

    message exchange described above is protected by\n   the existing IKEv2 SA between
    the client and the gateway.\n   Once the client sends an acknowledgement to the
    gateway, it SHOULD\n   delete the existing security associations with the old
    gateway by\n   sending an INFORMATIONAL message with a DELETE payload.  The gateway\n
    \  MAY also decide to delete the security associations without any\n   signaling
    from the client, again by sending an INFORMATIONAL message\n   with a DELETE payload;
    however, it should allow sufficient time for\n   the client to set up the required
    security associations with the new\n   security gateway.  This time period should
    be configurable on the\n   gateway.\n"

  - "6.  Redirect during IKE_AUTH Exchange\n   If the gateway decides to redirect
    the client during the IKE_AUTH\n   exchange, based on the identity presented by
    the client in the\n   IKE_AUTH request message, it prevents the creation of a
    CHILD SA and\n   sends the REDIRECT payload in the IKE_AUTH response.  The gateway\n
    \  MUST verify the client's AUTH payload before sending the REDIRECT\n   payload,
    and the client MUST verify the gateway's AUTH payload before\n   acting on the
    REDIRECT payload.  Since the AUTH payloads were\n   exchanged and successfully
    verified, the IKEv2 security association\n   is valid.  When the client receives
    the IKE_AUTH response with the\n   REDIRECT payload, it SHOULD delete the IKEv2

    New_GW_ID)}\n   In case the IKE_AUTH exchange involves Extensible Authentication\n
    \  Protocol (EAP) authentication (as described in Section 2.16 of RFC\n   4306
    [2]) or multiple authentication methods (as described in RFC\n   4739 [6]), the
    gateway may decide to redirect the client based on the\n   interaction with the
    Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\n   (AAA) server or the external
    authentication server.  In this case,\n   the gateway MUST send the REDIRECT Notify
    payload in either the first\n   or the last IKE_AUTH response.  The client and
    the gateway MUST\n   verify the AUTH payloads as described above.\n   When EAP
    is used, the gateway MAY also redirect the client based on\n   the unauthenticated
    identity presented by the client in the first\n   IKE_AUTH exchange, itself.  Since
    EAP is used as the authentication\n   mechanism, the client does not include AUTH
    payload to authenticate\n   its identity, but the server MUST still include its
    own AUTH payload,\n   and the client MUST verify it.  Note that the IKEv2 SA is
    not created\n   in this case and the client does not have to explicitly delete
    the\n   IKEv2 SA.\n   In all of the cases above, the client MUST accept the REDIRECT\n
    \  notification only in the first IKE_AUTH response or the last IKE_AUTH\n   response.

    response.\n"

  - "7.  Handling Redirect Loops\n   The client could end up getting redirected multiple
    times in a\n   sequence, either because of a wrong configuration or a DoS attack.\n
    \  The client could even end up in a loop with two or more gateways\n   redirecting
    the client to each other.  This could deny service to the\n   client.  To prevent
    this, the client SHOULD be configured to not\n   accept more than a certain number
    of redirects (MAX_REDIRECTS) within\n   a short time period (REDIRECT_LOOP_DETECT_PERIOD)
    for a particular\n   IKEv2 SA setup.  The default value for the MAX_REDIRECTS\n
    \  configuration variable is 5.  The default value for the\n   REDIRECT_LOOP_DETECT_PERIOD
    configuration variable is 300 seconds.\n   Client implementations may allow these
    variables to be configured,\n   depending on a specific deployment or system configuration.\n"

  - "8.  Using the Redirect Mechanism with Mobile IPv6\n   Mobile IPv6 [3] may use
    IKEv2 for mutual authentication between the\n   mobile node and the home agent,
    for home address configuration, and\n   for setting up security associations for
    protecting Mobile IPv6\n   signaling messages [4].  The IKEv2 exchange, if IKEv2
    is used,\n   precedes the exchange of Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.  Therefore,\n
    \  the mechanism described in this document can also be used by a Mobile\n   IPv6
    home agent to redirect a mobile node to another home agent.\n   There is a Home
    Agent Switch mechanism available for redirecting a\n   mobile node to another
    home agent, described in [5].  The Home Agent\n   Switch mechanism can only be
    used after the binding cache has been\n   created at the home agent for the mobile
    node.  The disadvantage with\n   this is that quite a bit of state is created
    on the home agent before\n   the mobile node can be redirected to another home
    agent.  The\n   mechanism described in this document can be used for redirecting
    a\n   mobile node before any state related to the Mobile IPv6 binding is\n   created
    on the home agent.\n   When running IKEv2 between a Mobile IPv6 mobile node (MN)
    and home\n   agent (HA), redirecting the IKEv2 exchange to another HA is not\n
    \  enough; the Mobile IPv6 signaling also needs to be sent to the new HA\n   address.
    \ The MN MAY treat the information received in the\n   IKE_SA_INIT response in
    a similar way as it would treat HA discovery\n   information received from other
    unauthenticated (and potentially\n   untrustworthy) sources (such as DNS lookups
    not protected with DNS\n   Security (DNSSEC)).  However, if the MN has authenticated
    information\n   about its home agent, it MUST NOT be updated based on the IKE_SA_INIT\n
    \  response.\n   If the REDIRECT notification is received during the IKE_AUTH
    exchange\n   (after the HA has been authenticated; see Section 6), the MN MAY
    pass\n   the new address to Mobile IPv6 and treat it in a similar fashion as\n
    \  information from the Home Agent Switch message [5].\n   Gateway-initiated REDIRECT
    notifications exchanged in INFORMATIONAL\n   exchanges (see Section 5) MUST NOT
    result in updating any Mobile IPv6\n   state.  In such cases, the Home Agent Switch
    message specified in [5]\n   is used instead.\n"

    described in this document is mainly intended\n   for use in client-gateway scenarios.
    \ However, the mechanism can also\n   be used between any two IKEv2 peers.  But
    this protocol is\n   asymmetric, meaning that only the original responder can
    redirect the\n   original initiator to another server.\n"
  title: 10.  Use of the Redirect Mechanism between IKEv2 Peers
- contents:
  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   An eavesdropper on the path between a VPN client
    and server may send\n   a redirect to the client upon receiving an IKE_SA_INIT
    message from\n   this client.  This is no problem regarding DoS attacks for the
    VPN\n   connection, since an on-path-attacker can as well drop the\n   IKE_SA_INIT
    requests to prevent VPN access for the client.  But an\n   eavesdropper on the
    path between VPN client and server can redirect a\n   large number of clients
    to a victim, which is then flooded with\n   IKE_SA_INIT requests.  Flooding only
    happens if many clients initiate\n   IKEv2 exchange at almost the same time, which
    is considered a rare\n   event.  However, this may happen if a home agent / VPN
    server is\n   shutdown for maintenance and all clients need to re-establish VPN\n
    \  connections with another home agent / VPN server, or if the on-path\n   attacker
    forces all IPsec security associations to expire by dropping\n   all received
    IKEv2 messages.\n   The use of the REDIRECTED_FROM payload is intended to discourage
    a\n   rogue VPN gateway from redirecting a large number of VPN clients to a\n
    \  particular VPN gateway.  It does not prevent such a DoS attack.\n   The redirect
    mechanism MUST NOT update any state on the client apart\n   from the VPN gateway
    information.  When used with Mobile IPv6, care\n   must be taken to ensure that
    the home agent information that the\n   mobile node has configured is not modified
    wrongly by the redirect\n   message.\n   Redirecting based on the unauthenticated
    identities from the client\n   might leak out information about the user when
    an active attacker,\n   pretending to be a VPN client, can get information on
    the gateway to\n   which the real user was redirected.  If redirection is based
    on some\n   internal information of the user, it might leak information (that\n
    \  might not be available otherwise) about the user to the attacker.  To\n   prevent
    these kinds of attacks, redirection based on unauthenticated\n   IDs should be
    avoided and should be done only after the client has\n   also authenticated itself.\n"
