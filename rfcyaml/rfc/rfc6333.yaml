  - "1.  Introduction\n   The common thinking for more than 10 years has been that
    the\n   transition to IPv6 will be based solely on the dual-stack model and\n
    \  that most things would be converted this way before we ran out of\n   IPv4.
    \ However, this has not happened.  The IANA free pool of IPv4\n   addresses has
    now been depleted, well before sufficient IPv6\n   deployment had taken place.
    \ As a result, many IPv4 services have to\n   continue to be provided even under
    severely limited address space.\n   This document specifies the Dual-Stack Lite
    technology, which is\n   aimed at better aligning the costs and benefits in service
    provider\n   networks.  Dual-Stack Lite will enable both continued support for\n
    \  IPv4 services and incentives for the deployment of IPv6.  It also\n   de-couples
    IPv6 deployment in the service provider network from the\n   rest of the Internet,
    making incremental deployment easier.\n   Dual-Stack Lite enables a broadband
    service provider to share IPv4\n   addresses among customers by combining two
    well-known technologies:\n   IP in IP (IPv4-in-IPv6) and Network Address Translation
    (NAT).\n   This document makes a distinction between a dual-stack-capable and
    a\n   dual-stack-provisioned device.  The former is a device that has code\n   that
    implements both IPv4 and IPv6, from the network layer to the\n   applications.
    \ The latter is a similar device that has been\n   provisioned with both an IPv4
    and an IPv6 address on its\n   interface(s).  This document will also further
    refine this notion by\n   distinguishing between interfaces provisioned directly
    by the service\n   provider from those provisioned by the customer.\n   Pure IPv6-only
    devices (i.e., devices that do not include an IPv4\n   stack) are outside of the
    scope of this document.\n   This document will first present some deployment scenarios
    and then\n   define the behavior of the two elements of the Dual-Stack Lite\n
    \  technology: the Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) element and the Address\n   Family
    Transition Router (AFTR) element.  It will then go into\n   networking and NAT-ing
    considerations.\n"

    \  Dual-stack is defined in [RFC4213].\n   NAT-related terminology is defined
    in [RFC4787].\n   CPE stands for Customer Premise Equipment.  This is the layer
    3\n   device in the customer premise that is connected to the service\n   provider
    network.  That device is often a home gateway.  However,\n   sometimes computers
    are directly attached to the service provider\n   network.  In such cases, such
    computers can be viewed as CPEs as\n   well.\n"

    - "4.1.  Access Model\n   Instead of relying on a cascade of NATs, the Dual-Stack
      Lite model is\n   built on IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels to cross the network to reach
      a\n   carrier-grade IPv4-IPv4 NAT (the AFTR), where customers will share\n   IPv4
      addresses.  There are a number of benefits to this approach:\n   o  This technology
      decouples the deployment of IPv6 in the service\n      provider network (up
      to the customer premise equipment or CPE)\n      from the deployment of IPv6
      in the global Internet and in customer\n      applications and devices.\n   o
      \ The management of the service provider access networks is\n      simplified
      by leveraging the large IPv6 address space.\n      Overlapping private IPv4
      address spaces are not required to\n      support very large customer bases.\n
      \  o  As tunnels can terminate anywhere in the service provider network,\n      this
      architecture lends itself to horizontal scaling and provides\n      some flexibility
      to adapt to changing traffic load.  More\n      discussion of horizontal scaling
      can be found in Appendix A.\n   o  Tunnels provide a direct connection between
      B4 and the AFTR.  This\n      can be leveraged to enable customers and their
      applications to\n      control how the NAT function of the AFTR is performed.\n
      \  A key characteristic of this approach is that communications between\n   end-nodes
      stay within their address family.  IPv6 sources only\n   communicate with IPv6
      destinations, and IPv4 sources only communicate\n   with IPv4 destinations.
      \ There is no protocol family translation\n   involved in this approach.  This
      simplifies greatly the task of\n   applications that may carry literal IP addresses
      in their payloads.\n"

    - "4.2.  CPE\n   This section describes home Local Area networks characterized
      by the\n   presence of a home gateway, or CPE, provisioned only with IPv6 by
      the\n   service provider.\n   A DS-Lite CPE is an IPv6-aware CPE with a B4 interface
      implemented in\n   the WAN interface.\n   A DS-Lite CPE SHOULD NOT operate a
      NAT function between an internal\n   interface and a B4 interface, as the NAT
      function will be performed\n   by the AFTR in the service provider's network.
      \ This will avoid\n   accidentally operating in a double-NAT environment.\n
      \  However, it SHOULD operate its own DHCP(v4) server handing out\n   [RFC1918]
      address space (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16) to hosts in the home.\n   It SHOULD advertise
      itself as the default IPv4 router to those home\n   hosts.  It SHOULD also advertise
      itself as a DNS server in the DHCP\n   Option 6 (DNS Server).  Additionally,
      it SHOULD operate a DNS proxy\n   to accept DNS IPv4 requests from home hosts
      and send them using IPv6\n   to the service provider DNS servers, as described
      in Section 5.5.\n   Note: If an IPv4 home host decides to use another IPv4 DNS
      server,\n   the DS-Lite CPE will forward those DNS requests via the B4 interface,\n
      \  the same way it forwards any regular IPv4 packets.  However, each DNS\n   request
      will create a binding in the AFTR.  A large number of DNS\n   requests may have
      a direct impact on the AFTR's NAT table\n   utilization.\n   IPv6-capable devices
      directly reach the IPv6 Internet.  Packets\n   simply follow IPv6 routing, they
      do not go through the tunnel, and\n   they are not subject to any translation.
      \ It is expected that most\n   IPv6-capable devices will also be IPv4 capable
      and will simply be\n   configured with an IPv4 [RFC1918]-style address within
      the home\n   network and access the IPv4 Internet the same way as the legacy
      IPv4-\n   only devices within the home.\n   Pure IPv6-only devices (i.e., devices
      that do not include an IPv4\n   stack) are outside of the scope of this document.\n"

  - contents:
    - "4.3.  Directly Connected Device\n   In broadband home networks, some devices
      are directly connected to\n   the broadband service provider.  They are connected
      straight to a\n   modem, without a home gateway.  Those devices are, in fact,
      acting as\n   CPEs.\n   Under this scenario, the customer device is a dual-stack-capable
      host\n   that is provisioned by the service provider with IPv6 only.  The\n
      \  device itself acts as a B4 element, and the IPv4 service is provided\n   by
      an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel, just as in the home gateway/CPE case.\n   That device
      can run any combinations of IPv4 and/or IPv6\n   applications.\n   A directly
      connected DS-Lite device SHOULD send its DNS requests over\n   IPv6 to the IPv6
      DNS server it has been configured to use.\n   Similarly to the previous sections,
      IPv6 packets follow IPv6 routing,\n   they do not go through the tunnel, and
      they are not subject to any\n   translation.\n   The support of IPv4-only devices
      and IPv6-only devices in this\n   scenario is out of scope for this document.\n"

    - "5.3.  Fragmentation and Reassembly\n   Using an encapsulation (IPv4-in-IPv6
      or anything else) to carry IPv4\n   traffic over IPv6 will reduce the effective
      MTU of the datagram.\n   Unfortunately, path MTU discovery [RFC1191] is not
      a reliable method\n   to deal with this problem.\n   A solution to deal with
      this problem is for the service provider to\n   increase the MTU size of all
      the links between the B4 element and the\n   AFTR elements by at least 40 bytes
      to accommodate both the IPv6\n   encapsulation header and the IPv4 datagram
      without fragmenting the\n   IPv6 packet.\n   However, as not all service providers
      will be able to increase their\n   link MTU, the B4 element MUST perform fragmentation
      and reassembly if\n   the outgoing link MTU cannot accommodate the extra IPv6
      header.  The\n   original IPv4 packet is not oversized.  The packet is oversized
      after\n   the IPv6 encapsulation.  The inner IPv4 packet MUST NOT be\n   fragmented.
      \ Fragmentation MUST happen after the encapsulation of the\n   IPv6 packet.

      \  mechanism, manual configuration, or a variety of DHCPv6 options.\n   In order

      an option to get the IPv6 address of such a DNS recursive\n   server, the B4
      element cannot easily discover the IPv4 address of\n   such a recursive DNS
      server, and as such will have to perform all DNS\n   resolution over IPv6.\n
      \  The B4 element can pass this IPv6 address to downstream IPv6 nodes,\n   but
      not to downstream IPv4 nodes.  As such, the B4 element SHOULD\n   implement
      a DNS proxy, following the recommendations of [RFC5625].\n   To support a security-aware

  - contents:
    - "6.3.  Fragmentation and Reassembly\n   As noted previously, fragmentation and
      reassembly need to be taken\n   care of by the tunnel endpoints.  As such, the
      AFTR MUST perform\n   fragmentation and reassembly if the underlying link MTU
      cannot\n   accommodate the encapsulation overhead.  Fragmentation MUST happen\n
      \  after the encapsulation on the IPv6 packet.  Reassembly MUST happen\n   before
      the decapsulation of the IPv6 header.  A detailed procedure\n   has been specified
      in [RFC2473] Section 7.2.\n   Fragmentation at the Tunnel Entry-Point is a lightweight
      operation.\n   In contrast, reassembly at the Tunnel Exit-Point can be expensive.\n
      \  When the Tunnel Exit-Point receives the first fragmented packet, it\n   must
      wait for the second fragmented packet to arrive in order to\n   reassemble the
      two fragmented IPv6 packets for decapsulation.  This\n   requires the Tunnel
      Exit-Point to buffer and keep track of fragmented\n   packets.  Consider that
      the AFTR is the Tunnel Exit-Point for many\n   tunnels.  If many devices simultaneously
      source a large number of\n   fragmented packets through the AFTR to its managed
      B4 elements, this\n   will require the AFTR to buffer and consume enormous resources
      to\n   keep track of the flows.  This reassembly process will significantly\n
      \  impact the AFTR's performance.  However, this impact only happens\n   when
      many clients simultaneously source large IPv4 packets.  Since we\n   believe
      that the majority of the clients will receive large IPv4\n   packets (such as
      watching video streams) instead of sourcing large\n   IPv4 packets (such as
      sourcing video streams), reassembly is only a\n   fraction of the overall AFTR's
      workload.\n   When the AFTR's resources are running below a pre-defined threshold,\n
      \  the AFTR SHOULD generate a notification to the administrator before\n   the
      resources are completely exhausted.  The threshold and\n   notification procedures
      are implementation dependent and are out of\n   scope for this document.\n   Methods
      to avoid fragmentation, such as rewriting the TCP Maximum\n   Segment Size (MSS)
      option or using technologies such as the\n   Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation
      Layer as defined in\n   [RFC5320], are out of scope for this document.\n"

      address\n   ranges in the pools may be disjoint but MUST NOT be overlapped.\n
      \  Operators may implement policies in the AFTR to assign clients in\n   different
      pools.  For example, an AFTR can have two interfaces.  Each\n   interface will
      have a disjoint pool NAT assigned to it.  In another\n   case, a policy implemented
      on the AFTR may specify that one set of\n   B4s will use NAT pool 1 and a different
      set of B4s will use NAT\n   pool 2.\n"

      the limitations of NAT.  Some\n   protocols require ALGs in the NAT device to
      traverse through the NAT.\n   For example, Active FTP requires the ALG to work
      properly.  ALGs\n   consume resources, and there are many different types of
      ALGs.  The\n   AFTR is a shared network device that supports a large number
      of B4\n   elements.  It is impossible for the AFTR to implement every current\n

    IPv4 192.0.0.0/29\n   network prefix.  That range is used to number the Dual-Stack
    Lite\n   interfaces.  Reserving a /29 allows for 6 possible interfaces on a\n
    \  multi-home node.  The IPv4 address 192.0.0.1 is reserved as the IPv4\n   address
    of the default router for such Dual-Stack Lite hosts.\n"

  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   Security issues associated with NAT have long
    been documented.  See\n   [RFC2663] and [RFC2993].\n   However, moving the NAT
    functionality from the CPE to the core of the\n   service provider network and
    sharing IPv4 addresses among customers\n   create additional requirements when
    logging data for abuse usage.\n   With any architecture where an IPv4 address
    does not uniquely\n   represent an end host, IPv4 addresses and timestamps are
    no longer\n   sufficient to identify a particular broadband customer.  The AFTR\n
    \  should have the capability to log the tunnel-id, protocol, ports/IP\n   addresses,
    and the creation time of the NAT binding to uniquely\n   identify the user sessions.
    \ Exact details of what is logged are\n   implementation specific and out of scope
    for this document.\n   The AFTR performs translation functions for interior IPv4
    hosts using\n   RFC 1918 addresses or the IANA reserved address range (192.0.0.0/29).\n
    \  In some circumstances, an ISP may provision policies in the AFTR and\n   instruct
    the AFTR to bypass translation functions based on <IPv4\n   Address, port number,
    protocol>.  When the AFTR receives a packet\n   with matching information of the
    policy from the interior host, the\n   AFTR can simply forward the packet without
    translation.  The\n   addresses, ports, and protocol information must be provisioned
    on the\n   AFTR before receiving the packet.  The provisioning mechanism is out\n
    \  of scope for this specification.\n   When decapsulating packets, the AFTR MUST
    only forward packets\n   sourced by RFC 1918 addresses, an IANA reserved address
    range, or any\n   other out-of-band pre-authorized addresses.  The AFTR MUST drop
    all\n   other packets.  This prevents rogue devices from launching denial-of-\n
    \  service attacks using unauthorized public IPv4 addresses in the IPv4\n   source
    header field or an unauthorized transport port range in the\n   IPv4 transport
    header field.  For example, rogue devices could\n   bombard a public web server
    by launching a TCP SYN ACK attack\n   [RFC4987].  The victim will receive TCP
    SYN from random IPv4 source\n   addresses at a rapid rate and deny TCP services
    to legitimate users.\n   With IPv4 addresses shared by multiple users, ports become
    a critical\n   resource.  As such, some mechanisms need to be put in place by
    an\n   AFTR to limit port usage, either by rate-limiting new connections or\n
    \  putting a hard limit on the maximum number of ports usable by a\n   single
    user.  If this number is high enough, it should not interfere\n   with normal
    usage and still provide reasonable protection of the\n   shared pool.  More considerations
    on sharing IPv4 addresses can be\n   found in [RFC6269].  Other considerations
    and recommendations on\n   logging can be found in [RFC6302].\n   AFTRs should
    support ways to limit service only to registered\n   customers.  One simple option
    is to implement an IPv6 ingress filter\n   on the AFTR's tunnel interface to accept
    only the IPv6 address range\n   defined in the filter.\n"

      of the Dual-Stack Lite technology lies in the\n   fact that it is a tunnel-based
      solution.  As such, tunnel endpoints\n   can be anywhere in the service provider
      network.\n   Using the DHCPv6 tunnel endpoint option [RFC6334], service providers\n
      \  can create groups of users sharing the same AFTR.  Those groups can\n   be
      merged or divided at will.  This leads to a horizontally scaled\n   solution,
      where more capacity is added with more AFTRs.  As those\n   groups of users
      can evolve over time, it is best to make sure that\n   AFTRs do not require

    - "B.1.  Gateway-Based Architecture\n   This architecture is targeted at residential
      broadband deployments\n   but can be adapted easily to other types of deployment
      where the\n   installed base of IPv4-only devices is important.\n   Consider
      a scenario where a Dual-Stack Lite CPE is provisioned only\n   with IPv6 in
      the WAN port, not IPv4.  The CPE acts as an IPv4 DHCP\n   server for the LAN
      (wireline and wireless) handing out [RFC1918]\n   addresses.  In addition, the
      CPE may support IPv6 Auto-Configuration\n   and/or a DHCPv6 server for the LAN.
      \ When an IPv4-only device\n   connects to the CPE, that CPE will hand out a
      [RFC1918] address to\n   the device.  When a dual-stack-capable device connects
      to the CPE,\n   that CPE will hand out a [RFC1918] address and a global IPv6
      address\n   to the device.  Besides, the CPE will create an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire\n
      \  tunnel [RFC5571] to an AFTR that resides in the service provider\n   network.\n
      \  When the device accesses IPv6 service, it will send the IPv6 datagram\n   to
      the CPE natively.  The CPE will route the traffic upstream to the\n   IPv6 default
      gateway.\n   When the device accesses IPv4 service, it will source the IPv4\n
      \  datagram with the [RFC1918] address and send the IPv4 datagram to the\n   CPE.
      \ The CPE will encapsulate the IPv4 datagram inside the IPv4-in-\n   IPv6 softwire
      tunnel and forward the IPv6 datagram to the AFTR.  This\n   is in contrast to
      what the CPE normally does today, which is to NAT\n   the [RFC1918] address
      to the public IPv4 address and route the\n   datagram upstream.  When the AFTR
      receives the IPv6 datagram, it will\n   decapsulate the IPv6 header and perform
      an IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT on the\n   source address.\n   As illustrated in Figure
      1, this Dual-Stack Lite deployment model\n   consists of three components: the
      Dual-Stack Lite home router with a\n   B4 element, the AFTR, and a softwire
      between the B4 element acting as\n   softwire initiator (SI) [RFC5571] in the
      Dual-Stack Lite home router\n   and the softwire concentrator (SC) [RFC5571]
      in the AFTR.  The AFTR\n   performs IPv4-IPv4 NAT translations to multiplex
      multiple subscribers\n   through a pool of global IPv4 addresses.  Overlapping
      address spaces\n   used by subscribers are disambiguated through the identification
      of\n   tunnel endpoints.\n                   +-----------+\n                   |

        \                        Datagram Header Contents\n   When datagram 1 is received
        by the Dual-Stack Lite home router, the\n   B4 element encapsulates the datagram
        in datagram 2 and forwards it to\n   the Dual-Stack Lite carrier-grade NAT
        over the softwire.\n   When the tunnel concentrator in the AFTR receives datagram
        2, it\n   forwards the IPv4 datagram to the NAT, which determines from its
        NAT\n   table that the datagram received on the softwire with TCP SRC\n   port
        10000 should be translated to datagram 3 with IPv4 SRC address\n   192.0.2.1
        and TCP SRC port 5000.\n   Figure 3 shows an inbound message received at the
        AFTR.  When the NAT\n   function in the AFTR receives datagram 1, it looks
        up the IP/TCP DST\n   information in its translation table.  In the example
        in Figure 3,\n   the NAT changes the TCP DST port to 10000, sets the IP DST
        address to\n   10.0.0.1, and forwards the datagram to the softwire.  The B4
        in the\n   home router decapsulates the IPv4 datagram from the inbound softwire\n

      - "B.1.2.  Translation Details\n   The AFTR has a NAT that translates between
        softwire/port pairs and\n   IPv4-address/port pairs.  The same translation
        is applied to IPv4\n   datagrams received on the device's external interface
        and from the\n   softwire endpoint in the device.\n   In Figure 2, the translator
        network interface in the AFTR is on the\n   Internet, and the softwire interface
        connects to the Dual-Stack Lite\n   home router.  The AFTR translator is configured
        as follows:\n   Network interface:  Translate IPv4 destination address and
        TCP\n      destination port to the softwire identifier and TCP destination\n
        \     port\n   Softwire interface:  Translate softwire identifier and TCP
        source\n      port to IPv4 source address and TCP source port\n   Here is
        how the translation in Figure 3 works:\n   o  Datagram 1 is received on the
        AFTR translator network interface.\n      The translator looks up the IPv4-address/port
        pair in its\n      translator table, rewrites the IPv4 destination address
        to\n      10.0.0.1 and the TCP source port to 10000, and forwards the\n      datagram
        to the softwire.\n   o  The IPv4 datagram is received on the Dual-Stack Lite
        home router\n      B4.  The B4 function extracts the IPv4 datagram, and the
        Dual-\n      Stack Lite home router forwards datagram 3 to the host.\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------+\n

        \           Dual-Stack Lite Carrier-Grade NAT Translation Table\n   The Softwire-Id
        is the IPv6 address assigned to the Dual-Stack Lite\n   CPE.  Hosts behind
        the same Dual-Stack Lite home router have the same\n   Softwire-Id.  The source
        IPv4 address is the [RFC1918] address\n   assigned by the Dual-Stack home
        router and is unique to each host\n   behind the CPE.  The AFTR would receive
        packets sourced from\n   different IPv4 addresses in the same softwire tunnel.
        \ The AFTR\n   combines the Softwire-Id and IPv4 address/port [Softwire-Id,

    title: B.1.  Gateway-Based Architecture
  - contents:
    - "B.2.  Host-Based Architecture\n   This architecture is targeted at new, large-scale
      deployments of\n   dual-stack-capable devices implementing a Dual-Stack Lite
      interface.\n   Consider a scenario where a Dual-Stack Lite host device is directly\n
      \  connected to the service provider network.  The host device is dual-\n   stack
      capable but only provisioned with an IPv6 global address.\n   Besides, the host
      device will pre-configure a well-known IPv4\n   non-routable address; see Section
      10 (IANA Considerations).  This\n   well-known IPv4 non-routable address is
      similar to the 127.0.0.1\n   loopback address.  Every host device that implements
      Dual-Stack Lite\n   will pre-configure the same address.  This address will
      be used to\n   source the IPv4 datagram when the device accesses IPv4 services.\n
      \  Besides, the host device will create an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel\n   to
      an AFTR.  The carrier-grade NAT will reside in the service\n   provider network.\n
      \  When the device accesses IPv6 service, the device will send the IPv6\n   datagram
      natively to the default gateway.\n   When the device accesses IPv4 service,
      it will source the IPv4\n   datagram with the well-known non-routable IPv4 address.
      \ Then, the\n   host device will encapsulate the IPv4 datagram inside the IPv4-in-\n
      \  IPv6 softwire tunnel and send the IPv6 datagram to the AFTR.  When\n   the
      AFTR receives the IPv6 datagram, it will decapsulate the IPv6\n   header and
      perform IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT on the source address.\n   This scenario works on both
      wireline and wireless networks.  A\n   typical wireless device will connect
      directly to the service provider\n   without a CPE in between.\n   As illustrated
      in Figure 4, this Dual-Stack Lite deployment model\n   consists of three components:
      the Dual-Stack Lite host, the AFTR, and\n   a softwire between the softwire
      initiator B4 in the host and the\n   softwire concentrator in the AFTR.  The
      Dual-Stack Lite host is\n   assumed to have IPv6 service and can exchange IPv6
      traffic with the\n   AFTR.\n   The AFTR performs IPv4-IPv4 NAT translations
      to multiplex multiple\n   subscribers through a pool of global IPv4 addresses.
      \ Overlapping\n   IPv4 address spaces used by the Dual-Stack Lite hosts are\n
      \  disambiguated through the identification of tunnel endpoints.\n   In this
      situation, the Dual-Stack Lite host configures the IPv4\n   address 192.0.0.2
      out of the well-known range 192.0.0.0/29 (defined\n   by IANA) on its B4 interface.
      \ It also configures the first\n   non-reserved IPv4 address of the reserved
      range, 192.0.0.1, as the\n   address of its default gateway.\n               +-------------------+\n

        \                        Datagram Header Contents\n   When sending an IPv4
        packet, the Dual-Stack Lite host encapsulates it\n   in datagram 1 and forwards
        it to the AFTR over the softwire.\n   When it receives datagram 1, the concentrator
        in the AFTR hands the\n   IPv4 datagram to the NAT, which determines from
        its translation table\n   that the datagram received on the softwire with
        TCP SRC port 10000\n   should be translated to datagram 3 with IPv4 SRC address
        192.0.2.1\n   and TCP SRC port 5000.\n   Figure 6 shows an inbound message
        received at the AFTR.  When the NAT\n   function in the AFTR receives datagram
        1, it looks up the IP/TCP DST\n   in its translation table.  In the example
        in Figure 6, the NAT\n   translates the TCP DST port to 10000, sets the IP
        DST address to\n   192.0.0.2, and forwards the datagram to the softwire.  The
        B4 inside\n   the host decapsulates the IPv4 datagram from the inbound softwire\n
        \  datagram, and forwards it to the host's application layer.\n               +-------------------+\n
