Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
Specifically, this document describes a MIB for the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS IS) Routing protocol when it is used to construct routing tables for IP networks.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This document describes a management information base for the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS IS) Routing protocol, as described in ISO 10589
[ISO10589], when it is used to construct routing tables for IP networks, as described in RFC 1195
The objects are mainly derived from the Guidelines for Definition of Managed Objects (GDMO) definitions in ISO 10589 and from the GDMO definitions in ISO 10733
There are also additional objects for managing the IP specific functionality of Integrated
This MIB imports definitions from SNMPv2
CONF [RFC2580], SNMP FRAMEWORK MIB [RFC3411], DIFFSERV MIB [RFC3289], IF MIB [RFC2863], and INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001].
See the imports section of the MIB for the specific items imported.
This MIB defines some objects to manage Mesh Groups, described in [RFC2973], and a three way handshake for point to point adjacencies, described in [RFC3373].
The IS IS MIB defines the following objects:
This table contains information specific to a single instance of the IS IS protocol running on a router.
isisManAreaAddr This table includes area addresses that are manually configured, which are used to control the associations formed between Level 1 Intermediate Systems.
This table includes area addresses reported in relevant L1 LSPs.
This table holds summary addresses configured for each Level 2 instance of the IS IS protocol running on a router.
This table provides criteria to decide whether a route should be leaked from L2 to L1 when Domain Wide Prefix leaking is enabled.
This table holds the hostname and router ID for Intermediate Systems in the network.
This table contains information specific to a domain (Level 2) or an area (Level 1) of the IS IS protocol.
This scalar is used to provide a unique circuit index.
This table contains information specific to a point to point or a broadcast interface in the system.

isisPacketCounter Counts of IS IS Protocol PDUs broken down into packet type.
Attributes associated with an Adjacency  isisISAdj
This table contains information about adjacencies to routers maintained by the protocol.

This table contains information contained in the headers of Link State PDUs stored by the system.
The Link State PDU TLV Table.
This table holds the sequence of TLVs that make up an LSP fragment.
Attributes Associated with a Notification  isisNotification
This table defines attributes that will be included when reporting IS IS notifications.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL", when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
{ mib 2 138 } 7.
Security Considerations Management information defined in this MIB may be considered sensitive in some network environments.
This MIB may be used to manage an IP router, which is used to direct network traffic.
The control of network traffic allows an attacker to deny service to a region of the network or to forward traffic to adversaries.
By raising or lowering metrics, traffic may be directed to insecure portions of the network.
By disabling the protocol on an interface, the network may be partitioned.
Changes to the network topology will force all routers to recompute their routes.
Periodic route changes have brought down networks in the past by subjecting routers to stressful recomputations.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Authentication of received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information should be employed in such environments.
We identify a set of threats and then list attributes that can be used in each form of attack.
We discuss the effects that can be obtained by a single change to the variable in each class.
Threats Drop an Adjacency Drop
all Peers Drop Subnetwork Split the Network Intermittent Outages Redirect Traffic Delay Convergence
Avoid Detection Prevent Updates Hijack LAN Create Problems for CLNS Networks 7.2.1.
By changing attributes that are used to peer, we can disrupt an adjacency and bring a link down.
isisCircAdminState isisCircExistState isisCircLevelDRHelloTimer isisCircLevelHelloTimer isisCircLevelType
isisCircSmallHellos 7.2.2.  Drop All Adjacencies These attributes can be used to break some or all of a router's adjacencies.
In the case of System ID, the adjacency may be restored.
However, it will subject the network to additional stress.
This attribute can be used to stop advertisement of a subnetwork reachable through a single interface.
If the network design depends upon Wide Metrics or TE, we can use these attributes to prevent traffic from passing through a router.
isisSysLevelMetricStyle isisSysLevelOrigLSPBuffSize isisSysLevelSPFConsiders isisSysLevelTEEnabled isisSysReceiveLSPBufferSize 7.2.5.
We can use these attributes to subject the network to a series of topology changes, or otherwise force extensive recomputations of routes.
isisSysLevelMinLSPGenInt isisSysLevelSetOverload isisSysLevelSetOverloadUntil isisSysMaxAge isisSysMaxLSPGenInt isisSysL2toL1Leaking isisSysID 7.2.6.
By changing attributes such as metrics, we can push traffic to different parts of the network.
This may allow an intruder to observe data traffic from otherwise remote parts of the network.
We may also use these attributes to deny service to parts of the network.
isisSysMaxPathSplits isisCircLevelMetric isisCircLevelWideMetric isisIPRAAdminState isisIPRAExistState isisIPRAFullMetric isisIPRAMetric
isisIPRAMetricType isisIPRANextHop isisIPRANextHopType isisIPRASNPAAddress isisIPRAType
isisRedistributeAddrExistState isisSummAddrExistState isisSummAddrFullMetric isisSummAddrMetric isisSysL2toL1Leaking 7.2.7.
These attributes can be used to slow convergence by increasing the minimal interval required to update a packet.
By turning off traps, we can prevent a Network Management station from observing problems in the network caused by other aspects of an attack.
Prevent Updates Mesh Groups can be used to prevent the transmission of Link State PDUs on certain interfaces, delaying or preventing the propagation of updates.
If we have compromised a router, we can use this attribute to become the designated router and lie about the topology of a LAN.
Create Problems for CLNS Networks
This attribute can be used to modify the handling of CLNS traffic.

The following writable attributes do not pose a known security risk.
Much of the MIB is used to set or read attributes which are readily visible to any intruder who has access to traffic.
None of the security attributes are setable or visible through the MIB.
access to the MIB does not pose additional risks or vulnerabilities.
If write access is to be provided, it is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
