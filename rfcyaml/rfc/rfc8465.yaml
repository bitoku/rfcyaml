  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies how the Uniform Resource Name (URN)\
    \ namespace\n   reserved for Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2)\n\
    \   identities and its Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the Mobile\n   Equipment\
    \ Identity (MEID) as specified in RFC 8464 [10] can be used\n   as an Instance\
    \ ID as specified in RFC 5626 [4] and also as used by\n   RFC 5627 [5].\n   RFC\
    \ 5626 [4] specifies the \"+sip.instance\" Contact header field\n   parameter\
    \ that contains a URN as specified in RFC 8141 [6].  The\n   Instance ID uniquely\
    \ identifies a specific User Agent (UA) instance.\n   This Instance ID is used\
    \ as specified in RFC 5626 [4] so that the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\
    \ registrar (as specified in RFC 3261\n   [2]) can recognize that the contacts\
    \ from multiple registrations\n   correspond to the same UA.  The Instance ID\
    \ is also used as specified\n   by RFC 5627 [5] to create Globally Routable User\
    \ Agent URIs (GRUUs)\n   that can be used to uniquely address a UA when multiple\
    \ UAs are\n   registered with the same Address of Record (AoR).\n   RFC 5626 [4]\
    \ requires that a UA SHOULD create a Universally Unique\n   Identifier (UUID)\
    \ URN as specified in RFC 4122 [9] as its Instance ID\n   but allow for the possibility\
    \ to use other URN schemes.\n   RFC 5626 [4] states:\n      If a URN scheme other\
    \ than UUID is used, the UA MUST only use URNs\n      for which an RFC (from the\
    \ IETF stream) defines how the specific\n      URN needs to be constructed and\
    \ used in the \"+sip.instance\"\n      Contact header field parameter for outbound\
    \ behavior.\n   This specification meets this requirement by specifying how the\
    \ 3GPP2\n   MEID URN is used in the \"+sip.instance\" Contact header field\n \
    \  parameter for outbound behavior and RFC 8464 [10] specifies how the\n   3GPP2\
    \ MEID URN is constructed.\n   The 3GPP2 MEID URN is a URN for the MEID a globally\
    \ unique identifier\n   that identifies mobile devices used in the 3GPP2 networks.\
    \  The MEID\n   allocation is managed by the 3GPP2 to ensure that the MEID values\
    \ are\n   globally unique.  Details of the formatting of the MEID as a URN are\n\
    \   specified in RFC 8464 [10] and the definition of the MEID is\n   contained\
    \ in 3GPP2 S.R0048-A [13].\n"

- title: 3.  Background
  contents:
  - "3.  Background\n   Mobile communication has been rapidly improved from low-bit-rate\n\
    \   circuit-switched systems to the higher-data-rate packet-switched\n   system.\
    \  The packet-switched system has added the mobile capability\n   of Internet\
    \ Protocol (IP) connectivity; thereby, the IP Multimedia\n   Subsystem (IMS) have\
    \ made SIP-based calls and IP multimedia sessions\n   from mobile devices possible.\n\
    \   3GPP2 defines High Rate Packet Data (HRPD) with high data rates, and\n   it\
    \ dispenses with the 1x Circuit Switched (1xCS) infrastructure.\n   This means\
    \ that with HRPD networks, voice calls will need to be\n   conducted using IP\
    \ and IMS.  However, SIP-based IMS networks will\n   take a great many years from\
    \ the time of writing to transition to the\n   use of all IP; mobile devices will\
    \ need to operate in both IP/SIP/IMS\n   mode and circuit-switched mode.  This\
    \ means that calls and sessions\n   will need to be handed over between IP/SIP/IMS\
    \ mode and circuit-\n   switched mode mid-call or mid-session.  To achieve this,\
    \ the mobile\n   device needs to simultaneously communicate via both the IP/SIP/IMS\n\
    \   domain and the circuit-switched domain.\n   To meet this need, 3GPP2 has specified\
    \ how to maintain voice-session\n   continuity between the IP/SIP/IMS domain and\
    \ the circuit-switched\n   domain in 3GPP2 S.X0042-A [14].\n   In order for the\
    \ mobile device to access SIP/IMS voice service via\n   the circuit-switched domain,\
    \ 3GPP2 has specified that a Mobile\n   Switching Center (MSC) server will control\
    \ mobile voice call setup\n   over the circuit-switched radio access while establishing\
    \ the\n   corresponding voice session in the core network using SIP/IMS.  The\n\
    \   specified MSC server operates either via an IMS Media Gateway Control\n  \
    \ Function (MGCF) or directly if it is enhanced by SIP interface.  To\n   enable\
    \ this, the mobile device MUST be identified in both the 1xCS\n   and IP/SIP/IMS\
    \ domains.  The only mobile device identifier that is\n   transportable using\
    \ 1xCS signaling is the MEID; therefore, the\n   Instance ID included by the MGCF\
    \ or the MSC server and the Instance\n   ID directly included by the mobile device\
    \ both need to be based on\n   the MEID.\n   Additionally in order to meet the\
    \ above requirements, the same MEID\n   that is obtained from the circuit-switched\
    \ signaling by the MSC\n   server needs to be obtainable from SIP signaling so\
    \ that it can be\n   determined that both the SIP signaling and circuit-switched\
    \ signaling\n   originate from the same mobile device.\n"
- title: 4.  3GPP2 Use Cases
  contents:
  - "4.  3GPP2 Use Cases\n   1.  The mobile device includes its MEID in the SIP REGISTER\
    \ request\n       so that the SIP registrar can perform a check of the Equipment\n\
    \       Identity Register (EIR) to verify if this mobile device is\n       allowed\
    \ or barred from accessing the network for non-emergency\n       services (e.g.,\
    \ because it has been stolen).  If the mobile\n       device is not allowed to\
    \ access the network for non-emergency\n       services, the SIP registrar can\
    \ reject the registration.  Thus, a\n       barred mobile device is prevented\
    \ from accessing the network for\n       non-emergency services.\n   2.  The mobile\
    \ device includes its MEID in SIP INVITE requests used\n       to establish emergency\
    \ sessions.  This is so that the Public\n       Safety Answering Point (PSAP)\
    \ can obtain the MEID of the mobile\n       device for identification purposes\
    \ if required by regulations.\n   3.  The inclusion by the mobile device of its\
    \ MEID in SIP INVITE\n       requests used to establish emergency sessions is\
    \ also used in the\n       cases of unauthenticated emergency sessions to enable\
    \ the network\n       to identify the mobile device.  This is especially important\
    \ if\n       the unauthenticated emergency session is handed over from the\n \
    \      packet-switched domain to the circuit-switched domain.  In this\n     \
    \  scenario, the MEID is the only identifier that is common to both\n       domains.\
    \  The Emergency Access Transfer Function (EATF), which\n       coordinates the\
    \ call transfer between the domains, can thus use\n       the MEID to identify\
    \ that the circuit-switched call is from the\n       same mobile device that was\
    \ in the emergency session in the\n       packet-switched domain.\n"
- title: 5.  User Agent Client Procedures
  contents:
  - "5.  User Agent Client Procedures\n   A single mode 3GPP2 User Agent Client (UAC),\
    \ which uses only 3GPP2\n   technology to transmit and receive voice or data,\
    \ has an MEID as\n   specified in 3GPP2 S.R0048-A [13].  The single mode 3GPP2\
    \ UAC that is\n   registering with a 3GPP2 IMS network includes in the \"sip.instance\"\
    \n   media feature tag the 3GPP2 MEID URN according to the syntax\n   specified\
    \ in RFC 8464 [10] when performing the registration\n   procedures specified in\
    \ RFC 5626 [4] or RFC 5627 [5] (or any other\n   procedure requiring the inclusion\
    \ of the \"sip.instance\" media feature\n   tag).\n   A UAC MUST NOT use the 3GPP2\
    \ MEID URN as an Instance ID except when\n   registering with a 3GPP2 IMS network.\
    \  When a UAC is operating in IMS\n   mode, it will obtain the domain of the carrier's\
    \ IMS network to\n   register with, from the Universal Integrated Circuit Card\
    \ (UICC),\n   preconfiguration, or the network at the time of establishing the\n\
    \   Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context.  These three methods are carrier\n   specific\
    \ and are only performed by the carrier IMS networks.  The UAC\n   will also obtain\
    \ the address of the IMS edge proxy to send the\n   REGISTER request containing\
    \ the MEID using information elements in\n   the Attach response when it attempts\
    \ to connect to the carrier's\n   packet data network.  When registering with\
    \ a non-3GPP or non-3GPP2\n   IMS network, a UAC SHOULD use a UUID as an Instance\
    \ ID as specified\n   in RFC 5626 [4].\n   A UAC MUST NOT include the \"sip.instance\"\
    \ media feature tag\n   containing the 3GPP2 MEID URN in the Contact header field\
    \ of non-\n   REGISTER requests except when the request is related to an emergency\n\
    \   session.  Regulations can require that the MEID be provided to the\n   PSAP.\
    \  Any future exceptions to this prohibition require an RFC that\n   addresses\
    \ how privacy is not violated by such usage.\n"

- title: 7.  3GPP/3GPP2 SIP Registrar Procedures
  contents:
  - "7.  3GPP/3GPP2 SIP Registrar Procedures\n   In 3GPP/3GPP2 IMS, when the SIP Registrar\
    \ receives in the Contact\n   header field a \"sip.instance\" media feature tag\
    \ containing the 3GPP2\n   MEID URN according to the syntax specified in RFC 8464\
    \ [10], the SIP\n   registrar follows the procedures specified in RFC 5626 [4].\
    \  The MEID\n   URN MAY be validated as described in the RFC 8464 [10].  If the\
    \ UA\n   indicates that it supports the extension in RFC 5627 [5] and the SIP\n\
    \   Registrar allocates a GRUU according to the procedures specified in\n   RFC\
    \ 5627 [5], the Instance ID MUST be obfuscated when creating the\n   \"gr\" parameter\
    \ in order not to reveal the MEID to other UAs when the\n   public GRUU is included\
    \ in non-REGISTER requests and responses.  3GPP\n   TS 24.229 [11] subclause 5.4.7A.2\
    \ specifies the mechanism for\n   obfuscating the MEID when creating the \"gr\"\

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Since MEIDs, like other formats of Instance IDs,\
    \ can be correlated to\n   a user, they are personally identifiable information\
    \ and MUST be\n   treated as such.  In particular, the \"sip.instance\" media\
    \ feature tag\n   containing the 3GPP2 MEID URN MUST NOT be included in requests\
    \ or\n   responses intended to convey any level of anonymity, as this could\n\
    \   violate the user's privacy.  RFC 5626 [4] states:\n      One case where a\
    \ UA could prefer to omit the \"sip.instance\" media\n      feature tag is when\
    \ it is making an anonymous request or some\n      other privacy concern requires\
    \ that the UA not reveal its\n      identity.\n   The same concerns apply when\
    \ using the 3GPP2 MEID URN as an Instance\n   ID.  Publication of the 3GPP2 MEID\
    \ URN to networks that the UA is not\n   attached to or the UA does not have a\
    \ service relationship with is a\n   security breach; the \"sip.instance\" media\
    \ feature tag MUST NOT be\n   forwarded by the service provider's network elements\
    \ when forwarding\n   requests or responses towards the destination UA.  The 3GPP2\
    \ MEID URN\n   MUST NOT accidentally leak in other contexts, such as and in\n\
    \   particular when application servers subscribe to user registration\n   state\
    \ using the event package defined in RFC 3680 [3].  Additionally,\n   an Instance\
    \ ID containing the 3GPP2 MEID URN identifies a mobile\n   device and not a user.\
    \  The Instance ID containing the 3GPP2 MEID URN\n   MUST NOT be used alone as\
    \ an address for a user or as an\n   identification credential for a user.  The\
    \ GRUU mechanism specified\n   in RFC 5627 [5] provides a means to create URIs\
    \ that address the user\n   at a specific device or UA.\n   Entities that log\
    \ the Instance ID need to protect them as personally\n   identifiable information.\
    \  Regulations can require carriers to log\n   SIP MEIDs.\n   In order to protect\
    \ the \"sip.instance\" media feature tag containing\n   the 3GPP2 MEID URN from\
    \ being tampered with, those REGISTER requests\n   containing the 3GPP2 MEID URN\
    \ MUST be sent using a security mechanism\n   such as Transport Layer Security\
    \ (TLS) as specified in RFC 8446 [8]\n   or any other security mechanism that\
    \ provides equivalent levels of\n   protection such as hop-by-hop security based\
    \ upon IP Security\n   (IPsec).\n"
