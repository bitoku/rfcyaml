Abstract This document discusses the need for delegation of the IP6.ARPA DNS zone, and specifies a plan for the technical operation thereof.
In the IPv6 address space, there is a need for 'reverse mapping' of addresses to DNS names analogous to that provided by the IN ADDR.ARPA zone for IPv4.
The IAB recommended that the ARPA top level domain (the name is now considered an acronym for "Address and Routing Parameters Area") be used for technical infrastructure sub domains when possible.
It is already in use for IPv4 reverse mapping and has been established as the location for E.164 numbering on the Internet
IETF consensus was reached that the IP6.ARPA domain be used for address to DNS name mapping for the IPv6 address space [RFC2874].
This document deprecates references to IP6.INT in [RFC1886] section 2.5, [RFC2553] section 6.2.3, [RFC2766] section 4.1,
[RFC2772] section 7.1.c, and [RFC2874] section 2.5.
In this context, 'deprecate' means that the old usage is not appropriate for new implementations, and IP6.INT will likely be phased out in an orderly fashion.
This memo requests that the IANA delegate the IP6.ARPA domain following instructions to be provided by the IAB.
Names within this zone are to be further delegated to the regional IP registries in accordance with the delegation of IPv6 address space to those registries.
The names allocated should be hierarchic in accordance with the address space assignment.
While DNS spoofing of address to name mapping has been exploited in IPv4, delegation of the IP6.ARPA zone creates no new threats to the security of the internet.
