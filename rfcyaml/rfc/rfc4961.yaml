- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   TCP [RFC0793], which is inherently bidirectional, transmits\
    \ and\n   receives data using the same local port.  That is, when a TCP\n   connection\
    \ is established from host A with source TCP port \"a\" to a\n   remote host,\
    \ the remote host sends packets back to host A's source\n   TCP port \"a\".\n\
    \   However, UDP is not inherently bidirectional and UDP does not require\n  \
    \ using the same port for sending and receiving bidirectional traffic.\n   Rather,\
    \ some UDP applications use a single UDP port to transmit and\n   receive (e.g.,\
    \ DNS [RFC1035]), some applications use different UDP\n   ports to transmit and\
    \ receive with explicit signaling (e.g., Trivial\n   File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)\
    \ [RFC1350]), and other applications\n   don't specify the choice of transmit\
    \ and receive ports (RTP\n   [RFC3550]).\n   Because RTP and RTCP are not inherently\
    \ bidirectional protocols, and\n   UDP is not a bidirectional protocol, the usefulness\
    \ of using the same\n   UDP port for transmitting and receiving has been generally\
    \ ignored\n   for RTP and RTCP.  Many firewalls, Network Address Translators (NATs)\n\
    \   [RFC3022], and RTP implementations expect symmetric RTP, and do not\n   work\
    \ in the presence of asymmetric RTP.  However, this term has never\n   been defined.\
    \  This document defines \"symmetric RTP\" and \"symmetric\n   RTCP\".\n   The\
    \ UDP port number to receive media, and the UDP port to transmit\n   media are\
    \ both selected by the device that receives that media and\n   transmits that\
    \ media.  For unicast flows, the receive port is\n   communicated to the remote\
    \ peer (e.g., Session Description Protocol\n   (SDP) [RFC4566] carried in SIP\
    \ [RFC3261], Session Announcement\n   Protocol (SAP) [RFC2974], or Megaco/H.248\
    \ [RFC3525]).\n   There is no correspondence between the local RTP (or RTCP) port\
    \ and\n   the remote RTP (or RTCP) port.  That is, device \"A\" might choose its\n\
    \   local transmit and receive port to be 1234.  Its peer, device \"B\", is\n\
    \   not constrained to also use port 1234 for its port.  In fact, such a\n   constraint\
    \ is impossible to meet because device \"B\" might already be\n   using that port\
    \ for another application.\n   The benefits of using one UDP port pair is described\
    \ below in\n   Section 4.\n"

- title: 3.  Definition of Symmetric RTP and Symmetric RTCP
  contents:
  - "3.  Definition of Symmetric RTP and Symmetric RTCP\n   A device supports symmetric\
    \ RTP if it selects, communicates, and uses\n   IP addresses and port numbers\
    \ such that, when receiving a\n   bidirectional RTP media stream on UDP port \"\
    A\" and IP address \"a\", it\n   also transmits RTP media for that stream from\
    \ the same source UDP\n   port \"A\" and IP address \"a\".  That is, it uses the\
    \ same UDP port to\n   transmit and receive one RTP stream.\n   A device that\
    \ doesn't support symmetric RTP would transmit RTP from a\n   different port,\
    \ or from a different IP address, than the port and IP\n   address used to receive\
    \ RTP for that bidirectional media steam.\n   A device supports symmetric RTCP\
    \ if it selects, communicates, and\n   uses IP addresses and port numbers such\
    \ that, when receiving RTCP\n   packets for a media stream on UDP port \"B\" and\
    \ IP address \"b\", it\n   also transmits RTCP packets for that stream from the\
    \ same source UDP\n   port \"B\" and IP address \"b\".  That is, it uses the same\
    \ UDP port to\n   transmit and receive one RTCP stream.\n   A device that doesn't\
    \ support symmetric RTCP would transmit RTCP from\n   a different port, or from\
    \ a different IP address, than the port and\n   IP address used to receive RTCP.\n"
- title: 4.  Recommended Usage
  contents:
  - "4.  Recommended Usage\n   There are two specific instances where symmetric RTP\
    \ and symmetric\n   RTCP are REQUIRED:\n   The first instance is NATs that lack\
    \ integrated Application Layer\n   Gateway (ALG) functionality.  Such NATs require\
    \ that endpoints use\n   symmetric UDP ports to establish bidirectional traffic.\
    \  This\n   requirement exists for all types of NATs described in Section 4 of\n\
    \   [RFC4787].  ALGs are defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC3022].\n   The second instance\
    \ is Session Border Controllers (SBCs) and other\n   forms of RTP and RTCP relays\
    \ (e.g., [TURN]).  Media relays are\n   necessary to establish bidirectional UDP\
    \ communication across a NAT\n   that is 'Address-Dependent' or 'Address and Port-Dependent'\n\
    \   [RFC4787].  However, even with a media relay, symmetric UDP ports are\n  \
    \ still required to traverse such a NAT.\n   There are other instances where symmetric\
    \ RTP and symmetric RTCP are\n   helpful, but not required.  For example, if a\
    \ firewall can expect\n   symmetric RTP and symmetric RTCP, then the firewall's\
    \ dynamic per-\n   call port filter list can be more restrictive compared to asymmetric\n\
    \   RTP and asymmetric RTCP.  Symmetric RTP and symmetric RTCP can also\n   ease\
    \ debugging and troubleshooting.\n   Other UDP-based protocols can also benefit\
    \ from common local transmit\n   and receive ports.\n   There are no known cases\
    \ where symmetric RTP or symmetric RTCP are\n   harmful.\n   For these reasons,\
    \ it is RECOMMENDED that symmetric RTP and symmetric\n   RTCP always be used for\
    \ bidirectional RTP media streams.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   If an attacker learns the source and destination\
    \ UDP ports of a\n   symmetric RTP or symmetric RTCP flow, the attacker can send\
    \ RTP or\n   RTCP packets to that host.  This differs from asymmetric RTP and\n\
    \   asymmetric RTCP, where an attacker has to learn the UDP source and\n   destination\
    \ ports used for the reverse traffic, before it can send\n   packets to that host.\
    \  Thus, if a host uses symmetric RTP or\n   symmetric RTCP, an attacker need\
    \ only see one RTP or RTCP packet in\n   order to attack either RTP endpoint.\
    \  Note that this attack is\n   similar to that of other UDP-based protocols that\
    \ use one UDP port\n   pair (e.g., DNS [RFC1035]).\n"
