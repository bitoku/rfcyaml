  contents:
  - "1. Terms of Reference of RIPE\n   Recognising that IP networks are growing beyond\
    \ the LAN's in Europe,\n   and are extending over national and international WAN's\
    \ in Europe,\n   the RIPE coordinating body has been created.  RIPE stands for\
    \ the\n   \"Reseaux IP Europeens\".\n   The objective of RIPE is to ensure the\
    \ necessary administrative and\n   technical coordination to allow the operation\
    \ and expansion of a\n   pan-European IP network.\n      o RIPE acts as a forum\
    \ for the exchange of technical information\n        and the creation of expertise\
    \ on IP networking.\n      o The area of relevance for RIPE is Europe.\n     \
    \ o All parties operating wide area IP networks are encouraged to\n        participate.\n\
    \      o RIPE promotes and coordinates interconnection of IP networks\n      \
    \  within Europe and to other continents.\n      o RIPE establishes agreement\
    \ on common network management\n        practices and the operational management\
    \ of the interconnected\n        networks.\n      o RIPE serves as a focal point\
    \ for other common activities of the\n        participants related to IP networking.\n\
    \      o All documents produced by RIPE will be publicly available.\n      o RIPE\
    \ is not a network service provider.  IP networks\n        collaborating in RIPE\
    \ remain under the executive authority of\n        their respective organisations.\n"
