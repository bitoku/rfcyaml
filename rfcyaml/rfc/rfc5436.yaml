    - "2.7.  Other Definitions\n   Because the receipt of an email message is generating
      another email\n   message, implementations MUST take steps to avoid mail loops.
      \ The\n   REQUIRED inclusion of an \"Auto-Submitted:\" field, as described in
      the\n   message composition guidelines, will also help in loop detection and\n
      \  avoidance.\n   Implementations SHOULD NOT trigger notifications for messages\n
      \  containing \"Auto-Submitted:\" header fields with any value other than\n
      \  \"No\".\n   Implementations MUST allow messages with empty envelope senders
      to\n   trigger notifications.\n   Because this notification method uses a store-and-forward
      system for\n   delivery of the notification message, the Sieve processor should
      not\n   have a need to retry notifications.  Therefore, implementations of\n
      \  this method SHOULD use normal mechanisms for submitting SMTP messages\n   and
      for retrying the initial submission.  Once the notification\n   message is submitted,
      implementations MUST NOT resubmit it, as this\n   is likely to result in multiple
      notifications, and increases the\n   danger of message loops.\n   Implementations
      SHOULD consider limiting notification messages.  In\n   particular, they SHOULD
      NOT sent duplicate notifications to the same\n   address from the same script
      invocation.  Batching of notifications\n   within a short time to the same address
      might also be useful.\n   Different implementations, different administrative
      domains, and\n   different users may have different needs; configuration options
      are a\n   good idea here.\n   The overall notification message is composed using
      the following\n   guidelines (see [RFC5322] for references to message header
      fields):\n   o  If the envelope sender of the triggering message is empty, the\n
      \     envelope sender of the notification message MUST be empty as well,\n      to
      avoid message loops.  Otherwise, the envelope sender of the\n      notification
      message SHOULD be set to the value of the \":from\" tag\n      to the notify
      action, if one is specified, has email address\n      syntax, and is valid according
      to the implementation-specific\n      security checks (see Section 3.3 of [Notify]).
      \ If \":from\" is not\n      specified or is not valid, the envelope sender
      of the notification\n      message SHOULD be set either to the envelope \"to\"
      field from the\n      triggering message, as used by Sieve, or to an email address\n
      \     associated with the notification system, at the discretion of the\n      implementation.
      \ This MUST NOT be overridden by a \"from\" URI\n      header, and any such
      URI header MUST be ignored.\n   o  The envelope recipient(s) of the notification
      message SHOULD be\n      set to the address(es) specified in the URI (including
      any URI\n      headers where the hname is \"to\" or \"cc\").\n   o  The header
      field \"Auto-Submitted: auto-notified\" MUST be included\n      in the notification
      message (see Section 2.7.1).  This is to\n      reduce the likelihood of message
      loops, by tagging this as an\n      automatically generated message.  Among
      other results, it will\n      inform other notification systems not to generate
      further\n      notifications. mailto URI headers with hname \"auto-submitted\"
      are\n      considered unsafe and MUST be ignored.\n   o  The \"From:\" header
      field of the notification message SHOULD be set\n      to the value of the \":from\"
      tag to the notify action, if one is\n      specified, has email address syntax,
      and is valid according to the\n      implementation-specific security checks
      (see Section 3.3 of\n      [Notify]).  If \":from\" is not specified or is not
      valid, the\n      \"From:\" header field of the notification message SHOULD
      be set\n      either to the envelope \"to\" field from the triggering message,
      as\n      used by Sieve, or to an email address associated with the\n      notification
      system, at the discretion of the implementation.\n      This MUST NOT be overridden
      by a \"from\" URI header, and any such\n      URI header MUST be ignored.\n
      \  o  The \"To:\" header field of the notification message SHOULD be set\n      to
      the address(es) specified in the URI (including any URI headers\n      where
      the hname is \"to\").\n   o  The \"Subject:\" field of the notification message
      SHOULD contain\n      the value defined by the \":message\" tag, as described
      in [Notify].\n      If there is no \":message\" tag and there is a \"subject\"
      header on\n      the URI, then that value SHOULD be used.  If the \"subject\"
      header\n      is also absent, the subject SHOULD be retained from the triggering\n
      \     message.  Note that Sieve [Variables] can be used to advantage\n      here,
      as shown in the example in Section 3.\n   o  The \"References:\" field of the
      notification message MAY be set to\n      refer to the triggering message, and
      MAY include references from\n      the triggering message.\n   o  If the mailto
      URI contains a \"body\" header, the value of that\n      header SHOULD be used
      as the body of the notification message.  If\n      there is no \"body\" header,
      it is up to the implementation whether\n      to leave the body empty or to
      use an excerpt of the original\n      message.\n   o  The \"Received:\" fields
      from the triggering message MAY be retained\n      in the notification message,
      as these could provide useful trace/\n      history/diagnostic information.
      \ The \"Auto-Submitted\" header field\n      MUST be placed above these (see
      Section 2.7.1).  URI headers with\n      hname \"received\" are considered unsafe,
      and MUST be ignored.\n   o  Other header fields of the notification message
      that are normally\n      related to an individual new message (such as \"Message-ID\"
      and\n      \"Date\") are generated for the notification message in the normal\n
      \     manner, and MUST NOT be copied from the triggering message.  Any\n      URI
      headers with those names MUST be ignored.  Further, the \"Date\"\n      header
      serves as the notification timestamp defined in [Notify].\n   o  All other header
      fields of the notification message either are as\n      specified by URI headers,
      or have implementation-specific values;\n      their values are not defined
      here.  It is suggested that the\n      implementation capitalize the first letter
      of URI headers and add\n      a space character after the colon between the
      mail header name and\n      value when adding URI headers to the message, to
      be consistent\n      with common practice in email headers.\n"

      - "2.7.1.  The Auto-Submitted Header Field\n   The header field \"Auto-Submitted:
        auto-notified\" MUST be included in\n   the notification message (see [RFC3834]).
        \ The \"Auto-Submitted\"\n   header field is considered a \"trace field\",
        similar to \"Received\"\n   header fields (see [RFC5321]).  If the implementation
        retains the\n   \"Received\" fields from the triggering message (see above),
        the \"Auto-\n   Submitted\" field MUST be placed above those \"Received\"
        fields,\n   serving as a boundary between the ones from the triggering message\n
        \  and those that will be part of the notification message.\n   The header
        field \"Auto-Submitted: auto-notified\" MUST include one or\n   both of the
        following parameters:\n   o  owner-email - specifies an email address, determined
        by the\n      implementation, of the owner of the Sieve script that generated\n
        \     this notification.  If specified, it might be used to identify or\n
        \     contact the script's owner.  The parameter attribute is \"owner-\n      email\",
        and the parameter value is a quoted string containing an\n      email address,
        as defined by \"addr-spec\" in [RFC5322].  Example:\n        Auto-Submitted:
        auto-notified; owner-email=\"me@example.com\"\n   o  owner-token - specifies
        an opaque token, determined by the\n      implementation, that the administrative
        domain of the owner of the\n      Sieve script that generated this notification
        can use to identify\n      the owner.  This might be used to allow identification
        of the\n      owner while protecting the owner's privacy.  The parameter\n
        \     attribute is \"owner-token\", and the parameter value is as defined\n
        \     by \"token\" in [RFC3834].  Example:\n        Auto-Submitted: auto-notified;
        owner-token=af3NN2pK5dDXI0W\n   See Section 5 for discussion of possible uses

    specific internationalization issues\n   that are not already addressed in [Sieve]
    and in [Notify].\n"
  title: 4.  Internationalization Considerations
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Sending a notification is comparable with forwarding
    mail to the\n   notification recipient.  Care must be taken when forwarding mail\n
    \  automatically, to ensure that confidential information is not sent\n   into
    an insecure environment.\n   The automated sending of email messages exposes the
    system to mail\n   loops, which can cause operational problems.  Implementations
    of this\n   specification MUST protect themselves against mail loops; see\n   Section
    2.7 for discussion of this and some suggestions.  Other\n   possible mitigations
    for mail loops involve types of service\n   limitations.  For example, the number
    of notifications generated for\n   a single user might be limited to no more than,
    say, 30 in a\n   60-minute period.  Of course, this technique presents its own\n
    \  problems, in that the actual rate-limit must be selected carefully,\n   to
    allow most legitimate situations in the given environment.  Even\n   with careful
    selection, it's inevitable that there will be false\n   positives -- and false
    negatives.\n   Ultimately, human intervention may be necessary to re-enable\n
    \  notifications that have been disabled because a loop was detected, or\n   to
    terminate a very slow loop that's under the automatic-detection\n   radar.  Administrative
    mechanisms MUST be available to handle these\n   sorts of situations.\n   Email
    addresses specified as recipients of notifications might not be\n   owned by the
    entity that owns the Sieve script.  As a result, a\n   notification recipient
    could wind up as the target of unwanted\n   notifications, either through intent
    (using scripts to mount a mail-\n   bomb attack) or by accident (an address was
    mistyped or has been\n   reassigned).  The situation is arguably no worse than
    any other in\n   which a recipient gets unwanted email, and some of the same\n
    \  mechanisms can be used in this case.  But those deploying this\n   extension
    have to be aware of the potential extra problems here,\n   where scripts might
    be created through means that do not adequately\n   validate email addresses,
    and such scripts might then be forgotten\n   and left to run indefinitely.\n   In
    particular, note that the Auto-Submitted header field is required\n   to include
    a value that a recipient can use when contacting the\n   source domain of the
    notification message (see Section 2.7.1).  That\n   value will allow the domain
    to track down the script's owner and have\n   the script corrected or disabled.
    \ Domains that enable this extension\n   MUST be prepared to respond to such complaints,
    in order to limit the\n   damage caused by a faulty script.\n   Problems can also
    show up if notification messages are sent to a\n   gateway into another service,
    such as SMS.  Information from the\n   email message is often lost in the gateway
    translation; and in this\n   case, critical information needed to avoid loops,
    to contact the\n   script owner, and to resolve other problems might be lost.\n
    \  Developers of email gateways should consider these issues, and try to\n   preserve
    as much information as possible, including what appears in\n   email trace headers
    and the Auto-Submitted header field.\n   Additional security considerations are
    discussed in [Sieve] and in\n   [Notify].\n"
