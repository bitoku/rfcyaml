  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    status\n   code for use when a server operator has received a legal demand to\n
    \  deny access to a resource or to a set of resources that includes the\n   requested
    resource.\n   This status code can be used to provide transparency in circumstances\n
    \  where issues of law or public policy affect server operations.  This\n   transparency
    may be beneficial both to these operators and to end\n   users.\n   [RFC4924]
    discusses the forces working against transparent operation\n   of the Internet;
    these clearly include legal interventions to\n   restrict access to content.  As
    that document notes, and as Section 4\n   of [RFC4084] states, such restrictions
    should be made explicit.\n"

    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Requirements

  - "3.  451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons\n   This status code indicates that the
    server is denying access to the\n   resource as a consequence of a legal demand.\n
    \  The server in question might not be an origin server.  This type of\n   legal
    demand typically most directly affects the operations of ISPs\n   and search engines.\n
    \  Responses using this status code SHOULD include an explanation, in\n   the
    response body, of the details of the legal demand: the party\n   making it, the
    applicable legislation or regulation, and what classes\n   of person and resource
    it applies to.  For example:\n   HTTP/1.1 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons\n
    \  Link: <https://spqr.example.org/legislatione>; rel=\"blocked-by\"\n   Content-Type:
    text/html\n   <html>\n    <head><title>Unavailable For Legal Reasons</title></head>\n
    \   <body>\n     <h1>Unavailable For Legal Reasons</h1>\n     <p>This request
    may not be serviced in the Roman Province\n     of Judea due to the Lex Julia
    Majestatis, which disallows\n     access to resources hosted on servers deemed
    to be\n     operated by the People's Front of Judea.</p>\n    </body>\n   </html>\n
    \  The use of the 451 status code implies neither the existence nor\n   nonexistence
    of the resource named in the request.  That is to say,\n   it is possible that
    if the legal demands were removed, a request for\n   the resource still might
    not succeed.\n   Note that in many cases clients can still access the denied resource\n
    \  by using technical countermeasures such as a VPN or the Tor network.\n   A
    451 response is cacheable by default, i.e., unless otherwise\n   indicated by
    the method definition or explicit cache controls; see\n   [RFC7234].\n"

  - "4.  Identifying Blocking Entities\n   As noted above, when an attempt to access
    a resource fails with\n   status 451, the entity blocking access might or might
    not be the\n   origin server.  There are a variety of entities in the resource-\n
    \  access path that could choose to deny access -- for example, ISPs,\n   cache
    providers, and DNS servers.\n   It is useful, when legal blockages occur, to be
    able to identify the\n   entities actually implementing the blocking.\n   When
    an entity blocks access to a resource and returns status 451, it\n   SHOULD include
    a \"Link\" HTTP header field [RFC5988] whose value is a\n   URI reference [RFC3986]
    identifying itself.  When used for this\n   purpose, the \"Link\" header field
    MUST have a \"rel\" parameter whose\n   value is \"blocked-by\".\n   The intent
    is that the header be used to identify the entity actually\n   implementing blockage,
    not any other entity mandating it.  A human-\n   readable response body, as discussed
    above, is the appropriate\n   location for discussion of administrative and policy
    issues.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Clients cannot rely upon the use of the 451 status
    code.  It is\n   possible that certain legal authorities might wish to avoid\n
    \  transparency, and not only demand the restriction of access to\n   certain
    resources, but also avoid disclosing that the demand was\n   made.\n"
