  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Presence Information Data Format for Location Objects\
    \ (PIDF-LO\n   [RFC4119]) carries both location information (LI) and policy\n\
    \   information set by the Rule Maker, as is stipulated in [RFC3693].\n   The\
    \ policy carried along with LI allows the Rule Maker to restrict,\n   among other\
    \ things, the duration for which LI will be retained by\n   recipients and the\
    \ redistribution of LI by recipients.\n   The Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261]\
    \ is one proposed Using\n   Protocol for PIDF-LO.  The conveyance of PIDF-LO within\
    \ SIP is\n   specified in [LOC-CONVEY].  The common motivation for providing LI\
    \ in\n   SIP is to allow location to be considered in routing the SIP message.\n\
    \   One example use case would be emergency services, in which the\n   location\
    \ will be used by dispatchers to direct the response.  Another\n   use case might\
    \ be providing location to be used by services\n   associated with the SIP session;\
    \ a location associated with a call to\n   a taxi service, for example, might\
    \ be used to route to a local\n   franchisee of a national service and also to\
    \ route the taxi to pick\n   up the caller.\n   Some ambiguities have arisen in\
    \ the interpretation of Rule Maker\n   policy when PIDF-LO is conveyed by SIP.\
    \  The following sections\n   explore the problem and provide a recommendation.\n"
- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   The <retransmission-allowed> element of RFC 4119 was\
    \ designed for use\n   in an environment like that of Section 4 of RFC 3693, in\
    \ which\n   Location Information (LI) propagates from a Location Generator\n \
    \  through a Location Server (LS) to a Location Recipient (LR).  In this\n   architecture,\
    \ it is the responsibility of the Location Server to act\n   on the rules (policy)\
    \ governing access control to LI, which are in\n   turn set by the Rule Maker.\
    \  The most important of these\n   responsibilities is delivering LI to authorized\
    \ Location Recipients\n   and denying it to others.  Internal to [RFC4119]-compliant\
    \ location\n   objects (LOs) are additional privacy rules which are intended to\n\
    \   constrain Location Recipients.  These include the <retransmission-\n   allowed>\
    \ element.  This element is intended to prevent a compromise\n   of privacy when\
    \ an authorized recipient of LI shares that LI with\n   third-party entities,\
    \ principally those who are not authorized by the\n   Rule Maker to receive LI.\
    \  For example, a user might be willing to\n   share their LI with a pizza shop,\
    \ but they might not want that pizza\n   shop to sell their LI to a targeted advertising\
    \ company that will\n   contact the user with coupons for a nearby hair salon.\n\
    \   Bear in mind, however, that <retransmission-allowed> is not intended\n   to\
    \ provide any protocol-level mechanism to prevent unauthorized\n   parties from\
    \ learning location through means like eavesdropping.  It\n   is merely a way\
    \ to express the preferences of the Rule Maker to the\n   LR.  If the LR were,\
    \ for example, legally bound to follow the privacy\n   preferences expressed by\
    \ Rule Makers, then they might incur liability\n   if they ignored the <retransmission-allowed>\
    \ parameter.  No further\n   privacy protection is assumed to be provided by <retransmission-\n\
    \   allowed>.\n   There is a use case for LI that involves embedding it in a SIP\n\
    \   request that will potentially traverse multiple SIP intermediaries\n   before\
    \ arriving at a user agent server (UAS).  In this use case, one\n   or more intermediaries\
    \ might inspect the LI in order to make a SIP\n   routing decision; we will hereafter\
    \ refer to this as location-based\n   routing.  Common examples could include\
    \ emergency services and other\n   more mundane cases where the originator of\
    \ a SIP request wants to\n   reach a service in proximity to a particular geographic\
    \ location,\n   such as contacting a nearby pizza shop.  In both such cases, the\
    \ UAC\n   may intend for selected intermediaries and the UAS to have access to\n\
    \   the LI.  In the pizza case, for instance, the user agent client (UAC)\n  \
    \ shares an address both for location-based routing and additionally so\n   that\
    \ the pizza shop reached by that routing has the address to which\n   a pizza\
    \ should be sent.\n   This location-based routing use case for LI has a number\
    \ of important\n   disconnects from the RFC 3693 model.  Unlike the RFC 3693 model,\n\
    \   there is no LS designating to which specific entities LI will be\n   sent.\
    \  There may be multiple intermediaries between the UAC and UAS,\n   some of which\
    \ will need or want to inspect LI (which would seem to\n   qualify them as LRs)\
    \ and some of them will not.  While SIP proxy\n   servers generally are not [RFC4119]-aware\
    \ and do not need to inspect\n   SIP request bodies in order to perform their\
    \ function, nothing\n   precludes proxy servers inspecting or logging any SIP\
    \ message bodies,\n   including LI.  Furthermore, it is very difficult for the\
    \ UAC to\n   anticipate which intermediaries and which eventual UAS a SIP request\n\
    \   might reach.\n   This architecture is further complicated by the possibility\
    \ of\n   sending location information by-reference, that is, placing a URL\n \
    \  where LI can be retrieved in SIP requests instead of using a PIDF-LO\n   body\
    \ (commonly called including the PIDF-LO by value).  Depending on\n   the qualities\
    \ of a reference, further authorization checks may be\n   performed before LI\
    \ is retrieved, LI may be customized depending on\n   who is asking, and so forth.\
    \  As will be discussed in greater detail\n   below, the conveyance of a reference\
    \ may have very different privacy\n   properties than conveying a PIDF-LO body\
    \ by-value in a SIP request.\n   In this architecture, the question of who is\
    \ an \"authorized\n   recipient\" from the point of view of the Rule Maker has\
    \ been muddy.\n   The SIP elements along the path are authorized to receive and\
    \ forward\n   the SIP message; does that make them automatically authorized\n\
    \   recipients of the LI it contains?  The final target of the SIP\n   message\
    \ will receive the LI along with other information, but it may\n   be different\
    \ than the initial target in a variety of scenarios; is it\n   authorized to read\
    \ the LI?\n   These questions and concerns are particularly problematic when\n\
    \   <retransmission-allowed> is set to \"no\" (the default case).  This\n   core\
    \ concern might be put as \"to whom does <retransmission-allowed>\n   apply in\
    \ location-based routing?\"  More specifically:\n   Is any entity that reads LI\
    \ bound by <retransmission-allowed>?  If\n   so, does that mean a proxy that performs\
    \ location-based routing is\n   unable to forward a request and complete a SIP\
    \ call if\n   <retransmission-allowed> is \"no\"?  Alternatively, must they strip\
    \ the\n   location body from the message in order to complete the call?\n   If\
    \ the proxy does not understand RFC 4119, it may forward a SIP\n   message containing\
    \ a policy statement <retransmission-allowed> set to\n   \"no\".  Is any proxy\
    \ that does understand RFC 4119 required to parse\n   the LI for this statement,\
    \ even if it would not do so in order to\n   route the message?\n   Is there a\
    \ need for SIP-level indications regarding retransmission\n   for the benefit\
    \ of entities that do not understand RFC 4119?\n   Since the UAC cannot anticipate\
    \ who may receive a SIP request, how do\n   we understand who the intended LR\
    \ is in the location-based routing\n   case?  Can a UAC have intended for there\
    \ to be multiple serial LRs in\n   a transmission?  If so, if one LR is authorized\
    \ to retransmit to\n   another LR, how will it know it is not also authorized\
    \ to transmit LI\n   to other third parties (i.e., how will the serial LRs know\
    \ to whom\n   they are authorized to retransmit)?  How could all of this be\n\
    \   designated?\n"
- title: 3.  Recommendation
  contents:
  - "3.  Recommendation\n   The following sections provide a recommendation for how\
    \ the\n   <retransmission-allowed> flag should be understood in a SIP\n   environment.\
    \  The core semantics of this recommendation represent the\n   consensus of the\
    \ GEOPRIV working group.  While Section 3.5 proposes a\n   syntax that might be\
    \ adopted by the SIP WG to implement these\n   semantics in its protocol, the\
    \ actual syntax of SIP is the\n   responsibility of the SIP WG.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Goals
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Goals\n   After extensive discussion in both GEOPRIV and SIP contexts,\
    \ there\n   seems to be consensus that a solution for this problem must enable\n\
    \   location-based routing to work even when the <retransmission-allowed>\n  \
    \ flag is set to \"no\".  A solution should also give the Rule Maker the\n   ability\
    \ to allow or forbid the use of LI for location-based routing\n   and the ability\
    \ to allow or forbid the use of LI for the consumption\n   of the endpoint.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Core Semantics
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Core Semantics\n   Consensus has emerged that any SIP entity that receives\
    \ a SIP message\n   containing LI through the operation of SIP's normal routing\n\
    \   procedures or as a result of location-based routing should be\n   considered\
    \ an authorized recipient of that LI.  Because of this\n   presumption, one SIP\
    \ element may pass the LI to another even if the\n   LO it contains has <retransmission-allowed>\
    \ set to \"no\"; this sees\n   the passing of the SIP message as part of the delivery\
    \ to authorized\n   recipients, rather than as retransmission.  SIP entities are\
    \ still\n   enjoined from passing these messages outside the normal routing to\n\
    \   external entities if <retransmission-allowed> is set to \"no\", as it\n  \
    \ is the passing to third parties that <retransmission-allowed> is\n   meant to\
    \ control.\n   This architecture is considerably different from the presumptions\
    \ of\n   RFC 3963, in that authorized recipients pass the LO on to other\n   authorized\
    \ recipients, but it seems to be the most sensible mechanism\n   given SIP's operation.\n\
    \   To maintain the Rule Maker's ability to affect the consumption of\n   this\
    \ information, two different mechanisms may be used to limit the\n   distribution\
    \ of LI and one may used to limit the sphere in which it\n   may be used; these\
    \ are discussed below.\n"

- title: 3.3.1.  Limiting Access Using Public Key Encryption
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Limiting Access Using Public Key Encryption\n   One way of limiting access\
    \ to LI is to encrypt the PIDF-LO object in\n   a SIP request.  If the originator\
    \ knows which specific entity on the\n   path needs to inspect the LI, and knows\
    \ a public key for that entity,\n   this is a straightforward matter.  It is even\
    \ possible to encrypt\n   multiple instance of PIDF-LO, containing different policies\
    \ or levels\n   of location granularity, in the same SIP request if multiple entities\n\
    \   along the path need to inspect the location.\n   This is most likely to be\
    \ effective in cases where the originator\n   does not wish the LI to be inspected\
    \ by intermediate entities and has\n   the public key for the target of the SIP\
    \ message, as it is very\n   difficult for the originator to anticipate the intermediaries\
    \ through\n   which a SIP message will pass.  It may also be useful in limited\n\
    \   environments where the originator has a trust relationship with a\n   specific\
    \ SIP element (e.g., a \"home\" or first-hop proxy) and it wants\n   to reveal\
    \ that LI only to that element.\n   Note that even in the case where the originator\
    \ intends to encrypt LI\n   for the benefit only of the target of the message,\
    \ it may be quite\n   difficult to anticipate the eventual endpoint of the message.\
    \  These\n   encrypted LIs will not be useful in any case where the anticipation\n\
    \   of the originators is not met.\n   An additional problem posed by this approach\
    \ is that it requires some\n   sort of public key discovery system, which compounds\
    \ the operational\n   complexity significantly.  While this method is included\
    \ for\n   completeness, it is the consensus of the working group that the\n  \
    \ deployment scenarios in which this is appropriate will be relatively\n   few;\
    \ we do not believe it is an appropriate baseline approach.\n"
- title: 3.3.2.  Limiting Access Using Location-by-Reference
  contents:
  - "3.3.2.  Limiting Access Using Location-by-Reference\n   Another, more feasible\
    \ approach is leveraging location by reference.\n   When a SIP request conveys\
    \ a reference, it cannot be properly said to\n   be conveying location; location\
    \ is conveyed upon dereferencing the\n   URI in the question, and the meaning\
    \ of <retransmission-allowed> must\n   be understood in the context of that conveyance,\
    \ not the forwarding\n   of the SIP request.\n   The properties of references,\
    \ especially the security properties,\n   vary significantly depending on the\
    \ nature and disposition of the\n   resource indicated.  Clearly, if the referenced\
    \ PIDF-LO is available,\n   in the same form, to any entity along the SIP signaling\
    \ path that\n   requests it, then inserting a reference has no advantages over\n\
    \   inserting LI by value (and introduces wasteful complexity).  However,\n  \
    \ if the Rule Maker influences the results of the dereferencing\n   process, including\
    \ determining who can receive LI at what degree of\n   granularity and what policies\
    \ are bound with the LI, the security\n   properties are different.\n   It might\
    \ superficially appear that this suffers from the same\n   problems as the encryption\
    \ approach, since the Rule Maker must\n   anticipate a set of entities who are\
    \ authorized to receive location\n   information.  The difference is that this\
    \ set does not need to be\n   communicated in the SIP request in order for authorization\
    \ decisions\n   to be made.  There is a world of difference between managing a\n\
    \   whitelist of a thousand parties that might ask for LI and sending a\n   SIP\
    \ request containing a thousand differently encrypted adumbrations\n   on LI --\
    \ the former is commonplace and the latter is impossible.\n   Additionally, some\
    \ Rule Maker policies might not even require the\n   establishment of an exhaustive\
    \ whitelist.  For example, it may be\n   that there exists a finite set of commercial\
    \ requestors that the Rule\n   Maker would like to block, in a manner similar\
    \ to the way ad-blockers\n   operate in modern web browsers.\n   In any system\
    \ where one makes an authorization decision, a certain\n   cost in authentication\
    \ must be paid -- the greater the assurance the\n   greater the cost.  The precise\
    \ cost will of course depend on the URI\n   scheme of the reference.  For SIP,\
    \ Digest has a low computational\n   cost but requires pre-established keys, which\
    \ limits applicability.\n   RFC 4474 Identity does not require any pre-association,\
    \ but it does\n   make signaling more heavyweight and requires the deployment\
    \ of\n   additional features in the network, including a web-like public key\n\
    \   infrastructure (PKI).\n   But even if no authentication takes place, in the\
    \ Location-by-\n   Reference (LbyR) case the meaning of <retransmission-allowed>\
    \ is\n   unambiguous -- each entity to which LI is conveyed in the dereference\n\
    \   process is bound by the retransmission policy.  The cost of the\n   reference\
    \ itself is of course the server that maintains the resource.\n   While not every\
    \ SIP client has access to an appropriate server for\n   this purpose, the fact\
    \ that PIDF-LO builds on the typical SIP\n   presence service makes this less\
    \ implausible than it might be.\n   Moreover, the LbyR approach casts the conveyance\
    \ architecture in a\n   manner familiar from RFC 3693, with a Location Server\
    \ receiving\n   requests from Location Recipients, which may be accepted or denied.\n\
    \   This allows the preservation of the original semantics of\n   <retransmission-allowed>.\n"
- title: 3.3.3.  Refraining from Including Location Information
  contents:
  - "3.3.3.  Refraining from Including Location Information\n   The most fundamental\
    \ mechanism for limiting access to location\n   information is simply not including\
    \ it.  While location-based routing\n   might conceivably occur in almost any\
    \ SIP message in the future,\n   there is no requirement that location be included\
    \ in the general case\n   to support it.  If it is not included and is required,\
    \ an appropriate\n   error indicating the lack may be returned and the choice\
    \ made to\n   continue communication with the information included.  This challenge\n\
    \   and response will slow the establishment of communication when it is\n   required,\
    \ but it is the most basic way to ensure that location\n   distribution is limited\

- title: 3.5.  Indicating Permission to Use Location-Based Routing in SIP
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Indicating Permission to Use Location-Based Routing in SIP\n   The discussion\
    \ in Section 3.3.2 describes 3 mechanisms for limiting\n   the distribution of\
    \ LI to specific entities.  There remains the\n   problem of limiting the use\
    \ to which LI included by value or by\n   reference may be put.  In order to meet\
    \ the need to limit that use,\n   this document recommends the creation of a syntactical\
    \ element in SIP\n   to carry this information.  As an exemplary concrete proposal,\
    \ we\n   recommend a \"Location-Routing-Allowed\" header as described below.\n\
    \   When \"Location-Routing-Allowed\" is set to \"Yes\", the Rule Maker is\n \
    \  indicating permission to use the included LI for location-based\n   routing.\
    \  When \"Location-Routing-Allowed\" is set to \"No\", the\n   originator is indicating\
    \ that this use is not permitted.  \"Location-\n   Routing-Allowed\" being set\
    \ to \"No\" has no protocol-level mechanism\n   for enforcement of this behavior;\
    \ like the PIDF-LO <retransmission-\n   allowed> being set to \"no\", it is a\
    \ way for the Rule Maker to express\n   a preference to the SIP elements, which\
    \ are LI recipients.  It may,\n   however, present a significant optimization.\
    \  Where a location-by-\n   reference is included with \"Location-Routing-Allowed\"\
    \ set to \"No\",\n   the SIP elements along the path know that they do not need\
    \ to attempt\n   to dereference the location information; this is significantly\
    \ faster\n   than attempting the dereference and being denied at the\n   authentication\
    \ stage.\n   We recommend that \"Location-Routing-Allowed\" be made mandatory-to-\n\
    \   implement for elements complying with [LOC-CONVEY].\n   We recommend that\
    \ it appear in any SIP message that contains a\n   location, whether by reference\
    \ or by value.\n   We recommend that any SIP message containing a location but\
    \ no\n   \"Location-Routing-Allowed\" header should be treated as containing a\n\
    \   \"Location-Routing-Allowed\" header set to \"no\".\n   We recommend that a\
    \ UA be allowed to insert a \"Location-Routing-\n   Allowed\" header even when\
    \ it has not included a location, in order to\n   set the policy for any locations\
    \ inserted by other SIP elements.\n   This allows the UA to assert that it is\
    \ a Rule Maker for locations,\n   even when the network architecture in which\
    \ the UA is present inserts\n   the location into SIP messages after the UA has\
    \ originated the SIP\n   exchange.\n   We recommend that any SIP element inserting\
    \ a location, whether by\n   reference or by value, insert a \"Location-Routing-Allowed\"\
    \ header if\n   one is not already present.  If one is present, it should not\
    \ be\n   overridden by the SIP element inserting the location.\n   We recommend\
    \ that any SIP element not the originator of a message and\n   not inserting a\
    \ location be enjoined from inserting a \"Location-\n   Routing-Allowed\" header.\n"

    \ might wish\n   to consider with regard to B2BUA behavior.\n   In most uses of\
    \ B2BUAs, they act as a simple intermediary between the\n   nominal originating\
    \ and nominal terminating UAs, that is, a proxy\n   that does something proxies\
    \ aren't allowed to do.  In such cases, the\n   B2BUA must conform to any new\
    \ routing-allowed mechanism if it chooses\n   an outgoing route.  As this document\
    \ advises proxies,\n   <retransmission-allowed> does not apply to the B2BUA in\
    \ this case,\n   and the B2BUA must copy the LI, the new routing-allowed, and\
    \ existing\n   <retransmission-allowed> values.\n   Where the B2BUA in fact does\
    \ act as an endpoint (terminating the\n   session and originating a different\
    \ session), <retransmission-\n   allowed> applies to it, and it must not copy\
    \ location if\n   <retransmission-allowed> is \"no\".  If it chooses a route for\
    \ the\n   outgoing leg, any new routing-allowed mechanism applies to it.\n   Encryption\
    \ lets the originator control who, including B2BUAs, is\n   allowed to see location.\
    \  On the other hand, using encryption with\n   LI, which is needed for routing,\
    \ is problematic, in that it is often\n   difficult to know in advance which elements\
    \ do location-based\n   routing.  Similarly, using Location-by-Reference instead\
    \ of location-\n   by-value provides additional control to the originator over\
    \ B2BUA\n   behavior by controlling who can dereference.  See Section 3.4 for\n\
    \   more guidance on this trade off.\n"
