  - "1. Introduction\n   This document defines a content feature schema that is a\
    \ profile of\n   the media feature registration mechanisms [1,2,3] for use in\n\
    \   performing capability identification between extended Internet fax\n   systems\
    \ [5].\n   This document does not describe any specific mechanisms for\n   communicating\
    \ capability information, but does presume that any such\n   mechanisms will transfer\
    \ textual values.  It specifies a textual\n   format to be used for describing\
    \ Internet fax capability information.\n   The range of capabilities that can\
    \ be indicated are based on those\n   covered by the TIFF file format for Internet\
    \ fax [7] and Group 3\n   facsimile [6].  A companion document [4] describes the\
    \ relationship\n   and mapping between this schema and Group 3 fax capabilities.\n"
- title: 1.1 Organization of this document
  contents:
  - "1.1 Organization of this document\n   Section 2 specifies the overall syntax\
    \ for fax feature descriptions\n   by reference to the media feature registration\
    \ and syntax documents\n   [1,2].\n   Section 3 enumerates the feature tags that\
    \ are to be recognized and\n   processed by extended Internet fax systems, according\
    \ to their\n   capabilities.\n   Appendix A contains additional feature tag registrations\
    \ for media\n   features that are specific to fax and for which no applicable\n\
    \   registration already exists.  These are presented in the form\n   prescribed\
    \ by the media feature registration procedure [1].\n"
- title: 1.2 Terminology and document conventions
  contents:
  - "1.2 Terminology and document conventions\n   The term \"extended Internet fax\
    \ system\" is used to describe any\n   software, device or combination of these\
    \ that conforms to the\n   specification \"Extended Facsimile Using Internet Mail\"\
    \ [5].\n   \"capability exchange\" describes any transfer of information between\n\
    \   communicating systems that is used to indicate system capabilities\n   and\
    \ hence determine the form of data transferred.  This term covers\n   both one-way\
    \ and two-way transfers of capability information.\n   \"capability identification\"\
    \ is a particular form of capability\n   exchange in which a receiving system\
    \ provides capability information\n   to a sending system.\n   \"capability description\"\
    \ is a collection of data presented in some\n   specific format that describes\
    \ the capabilities of some communicating\n   entity.  It may exist separately\
    \ from any specific capability\n   exchange mechanism.\n      NOTE: Comments like\
    \ this provide additional nonessential\n      information about the rationale\
    \ behind this document.  Such\n      information is not needed for building a\
    \ conformant\n      implementation, but may help those who wish to understand\
    \ the\n      design in greater depth.\n"
- title: 2. Fax feature schema syntax
  contents:
  - "2. Fax feature schema syntax\n   The syntax for the fax feature schema is described\
    \ by \"A syntax for\n   describing media feature sets\" [2].  This in turn calls\
    \ upon media\n   feature tags that may be registered according to the procedure\n\
    \   described in \"Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure\" [1].\n      NOTE:\
    \ Media feature registration provides a base vocabulary of\n      features that\
    \ correspond to media handling capabilities.  The\n      feature set syntax provides\
    \ a mechanism and format for combining\n      these to describe combinations of\
    \ features.  This memo indicates\n      those features that may be associated\
    \ with extended Internet fax\n      systems.\n"
- title: 3. Internet fax feature tags
  contents:
  - "3. Internet fax feature tags\n   This section enumerates and briefly describes\
    \ a number of feature\n   tags that are defined for use with extended Internet\
    \ fax systems and\n   applications.  These tags may be used also by other systems\
    \ and\n   applications that support corresponding capabilities.\n   The feature\
    \ tags presented below are those that an extended Internet\n   fax system is expected\
    \ to recognize its ability or non-ability to\n   handle.\n   Definitive descriptions\
    \ of feature tags are indicated by reference to\n   their registration per the\
    \ media feature registration procedure [1]\n   (some of which are appended to\
    \ this document)\n      NOTE: The presence of a feature tag in this list does\
    \ not mean\n      that an extended Internet fax system must have that capability;\n\
    \      rather, it must recognize the feature tag and deal with it\n      according\
    \ to the capabilities that it does have.\n      Further, an extended Internet\
    \ fax system is not prevented from\n      recognizing and offering additional\
    \ feature tags.  The list below\n      is intended to provide a basic vocabulary\
    \ that all extended\n      Internet fax systems can use in a consistent fashion.\n\
    \      If an unrecognized or unused feature tag is received, the feature\n   \
    \   set matching rule (described in RFC2533 [2]) operates so that tag\n      is\
    \ effectively ignored.\n"

    \ and not equal to 1 then the horizontal\n   resolution (x-axis) is indicated\
    \ by the 'dpi' feature value, and the\n   vertical resolution (y-axis) is the\
    \ value of 'dpi' divided by 'dpi-\n   xyratio'.\n   For example, the basic Group\
    \ 3 fax resolution of 200*100dpi might be\n   indicated as:\n         (& (dpi=200)\
    \ (dpi-xyratio=200/100) )\n   When describing resolutions for an MRC format document,\
    \ the complete\n   set of usable resolutions is listed.  However, there are some\n\

    \ model for image handling (both color and non-color) is\n   described here from\
    \ a receiver's perspective; a similar model\n   operates in the reverse direction\
    \ for a scan/send perspective:\n          raw bit        pixel         color \
    \        physical\n          stream  -(A)-> values -(B)-> values -(C)-> rendition\n\
    \      -   \"raw bit stream\" is a stream of coded bits\n     (A)  indicates image\
    \ coding/decoding (MH,MR,MMR,JPEG,JBIG,etc.)\n      -   \"pixel values\" are a\

    \ (i.e. L*, a*, b* in the case of CIELAB indicated\n          above.)\n     (C)\
    \  indicates how the color values are related to a physical\n          color.\
    \  This involves interpretation of the color value with\n          respect to\
    \ a color model (e.g. RGB, L*a*b*, CMY, CMYK) and a\n          color space (which\
    \ is typically recipient-dependent).\n      -   \"physical rendition\" is a color\
    \ value physically realized on a\n          display, printer or other device.\n\
    \   There are many variables that can be applied at each stage of the\n   processing\
    \ of a color image, and any may be critical to meaningful\n   handling of that\
    \ image in some circumstances.  In other circumstances\n   many of the variables\
    \ may be implied (to some level of approximation)\n   in the application that\
    \ uses them (e.g. color images published on a\n   Web page).\n   The color feature\
    \ framework described here is intended to allow\n   capability description at\
    \ a range of granularity: feature tags which\n   correspond to implied (or \"\
    don't care\" or \"unknown\") feature values\n   may simply be omitted from a capability\
    \ description.\n   Grey scale and bi-level images are handled within this framework\
    \ as a\n   special case, having a 1-component color model.  The following\n  \
    \ features are used for describing color capabilities:\n   'color-levels' indicates\
    \ the number of distinct values for each\n   picture element, and applies to all\
    \ but bi-level images.  For bi-\n   level images, a value of 2 is implied.\n \
    \  'color-space' is used mainly with 'Mapped' and 'Full', but could be\n   used\
    \ with other modes if the exact color used is significant.  Two\n   kinds of color\
    \ space can be distinguished: device-dependent and\n   calibrated.  Device dependent\
    \ spaces are named here as 'Device-xxx',\n   and are used to indicate a color\
    \ space that is defined by the\n   receiving device.  Calibrated color spaces\
    \ presume the existence of a\n   rendering system that is calibrated with respect\
    \ to an indicated\n   definition, and is capable of processing the device-independent\
    \ color\n   information accordingly.\n   A color-handling receiver should indicate\
    \ any appropriate device\n   color space capability in addition to any calibrated\
    \ color spaces\n   that it may support.  A calibrated color space should be used\
    \ when\n   precise color matching is required in the absence of specific\n   knowledge\
    \ of the receiving system.\n      NOTE: In practice, although they appear to be\
    \ separate concepts,\n      the color model and color space cannot be separated.\
    \  In the final\n      analysis, a color model (RGB, CMY, etc.) must be defined\
    \ with\n      respect to some color space.\n   'CIELAB-L-depth', 'CIELAB-a-depth'\
    \ and 'CIELAB-b-depth' indicate the\n   number of different values that are possible\
    \ for the L*, a* and b*\n   color components respectively, and are significant\
    \ only when colors\n   are represented in a CIELAB color space.  These features\
    \ would be\n   used with palettized color, or with full color where each color\n\
    \   component has a different number of possible values.\n   The 'CIELAB-x-min'\
    \ and 'CIELAB-x-max' values indicate a color gamut\n   (i.e. a range of color\

    \ that apply\n   in typical Group 3 fax environments.\n   The 'JBIG-stripe-size'\
    \ feature may be used with JBIG image coding,\n   and indicates the number of\
    \ scan lines in each stripe except the last\n   in an image.  The legal constraints\
    \ are:\n      (JBIG-stripe-size=128)\n      (JBIG-stripe-size>=0)\n   The latter\
    \ being equivalent to no restriction.\n   The 'MRC-mode' feature is used to indicate\
    \ the availability of MRC\n   (mixed raster content) image format capability,\
    \ and also the MRC mode\n   available.  A zero value indicates MRC is not available,\
    \ a non-zero\n   value indicates the available MRC mode number.\n   An MRC formatted\
    \ document is actually a collection of several images,\n   each of which is described\
    \ by a separate feature collection.  An\n   MRC-capable receiver is presumed to\
    \ be capable of accepting any\n   combination of contained images that conform\
    \ to the MRC construction\n   rules and declared image-coding capabilities.\n\
    \   Within an MRC-formatted document, multi-level coders are used for\n   foreground\
    \ and background images (i.e. odd-numbered layers: 1, 3, 5,\n   etc.) and bi-level\
    \ coders are used for mask layers (i.e. even\n   numbered layers 2, 4, 6, etc.).\n\
    \      NOTE: an MRC formatted document may appear within a TIFF image\n      file\
    \ structure, so this separate feature is needed to capture the\n      full range\
    \ of possible capabilities.\n   The 'MRC-max-stripe-size' feature may be used\
    \ with MRC coding, and\n   indicates the maximum number of scan lines in each\
    \ MRC stripe.  The\n   legal constraints are:\n      (MRC-max-stripe-size=[0..256])\n\
    \      (MRC-max-stripe-size>=0)\n   These values indicate upper bounds on the\
    \ stripe size.  The actual\n   value may vary between stripes, and the actual\
    \ size for each stripe\n   is indicated in the image data.\n      NOTE: there\
    \ are many image coding options here, and not all are\n      required in all circumstances.\n\
    \      Specification of the image-file-structure tag value alone is not\n    \
    \  normally sufficient to describe the capabilities of a recipient.\n      A general\
    \ rule is that sufficient detail should be provided to\n      exclude any unsupported\
    \ features.\n      For extended Internet fax, image-file-structure and image-coding\n\
    \      should always be specified, together with additional values\n      described\
    \ above as needed to clearly indicate which feature tag\n      values are supported\
    \ and which are not.  (See also the examples in\n      section 4.)\n"

    \ assume it is available to the sender\n   in three possible formats, A4 high\
    \ resolution, B4 low resolution and\n   A4 high resolution color, described by:\n\
    \      (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)\n         (color=Binary)\n         (paper-size=A4)\n\

    \         (paper-size=A4)\n         (image-coding=JPEG) )\n   These three image\
    \ formats can be combined into a composite capability\n   statement by a logical-OR\
    \ operation (to describe format-1 OR format-2\n   OR format-3):\n      (& (dpi=300)\
    \ (dpi-xyratio=1)\n         (color=Binary)\n         (paper-size=A4)\n       \

    \ simplified, but there is little gain in doing so at\n   this point.\n   The\
    \ composite document description can be matched with the receiver\n   capability\
    \ description, according to the rules in [2], to yield the\n   result:\n     \
    \ (& (dpi=300) (dpi-xyratio=1)\n         (color=Binary)\n         (paper-size=A4)\n\

    \         (ua-media=continuous)\n         (image-coding=[MH,MR]) ) )\n   Points\
    \ to note about the feature matching process:\n   o  The color document option\
    \ is eliminated because the receiver\n      cannot handle either color (indicated\
    \ by '(color=Mapped)') or JPEG\n      coding (indicated by '(image-coding=JPEG)').\n\
    \   o  The high resolution version of the document with '(dpi=300)' must\n   \
    \   be send using '(image-coding=JBIG)' because this is the only\n      available\
    \ coding of the image data that the receiver can use for\n      high resolution\
    \ documents.  (The available 300dpi document codings\n      here are MMR and JBIG,\
    \ and the receiver capabilities are MH, MR\n      and JBIG.)\n   o  The low-resolution\
    \ version of the document can be sent with either\n      MH or MR coding as the\
    \ receiver can deal with either of these for\n      low resolution documents.\n\
    \   o  The high resolution variant of the document is available only for\n   \
    \   A4, so that is the paper-size used in that case.  Similarly the\n      low\
    \ resolution version is sent for B4 paper.\n   o  Even though the sender may not\
    \ understand the 'ua-media' feature\n      tag, and does not mention it, the matching\
    \ rules preserve the\n      constraint that the B4 document is rendered with '(ua-\n\
    \      media=continuous)', and the A4 document may be rendered with '\n      (ua-media=[stationery,transparency])'.\n\
    \   Finally, note that when matching an MRC document description, the\n   description\
    \ of each component sub-image must match the capabilities\n   of the intended\
    \ receiver.\n"
