  - "1.  Introduction\n   The requirements for Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB)
    in the\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) are\n   specified
    in [RFC5860], and the framework of LI and LB is specified\n   in [RFC6371].  A
    Label Switched Path (LSP) that is locked, using LI,\n   is prevented from carrying
    user data traffic.  The LB function can\n   only be applied to an LSP that has
    been previously locked.\n   In general, the LI and LB are useful Operations, Administration,
    and\n   Maintenance (OAM) functions for technologies that use Generalized\n   MPLS
    (GMPLS) for the control plane, e.g., time-division multiplexing,\n   wavelength-division
    multiplexing, and packet switching.  It is\n   natural to use and extend the GMPLS
    control-plane protocol to provide\n   a unified approach for LI and LB provisioning
    in all these\n   technologies.\n   [RFC7487] specifies the RSVP-TE extensions
    for the configuration of\n   proactive MPLS-TP OAM functions, such as Continuity
    Check (CC),\n   Connectivity Verification (CV), Delay Measurement (DM), and Loss\n
    \  Measurement (LM).  The provisioning of on-demand OAM functions such\n   as
    LI and LB are not covered in that document.\n   This document specifies extensions
    to Resource Reservation Protocol-\n   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to support
    lock instruct and loopback\n   mechanisms for LSPs.  The mechanisms are applicable
    to technologies\n   that use GMPLS for the control plane.  For a network supporting
    MPLS-\n   TP, the mechanisms defined in this document are complementary to\n   [RFC6435].\n"

      used as\n   specified above and the Reflect (R) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object\n
      \  set.\n   On receipt of this Path message, the egress node SHOULD try to take\n

      MUST keep the A bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object cleared.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Loopback\n   The loopback request can be sent either to the egress node
      or to a\n   particular intermediate node.  The mechanism defined in [RFC7570]
      is\n   used for addressing the loopback request to a particular node on the\n
      \  LSP.  The ingress node MUST ensure that the LSP is in lock mode\n   before
      it requests setting a particular node on the LSP into loopback\n   mode.\n   When
      an ingress node intends to put a particular node on the LSP into\n   loopback
      mode, it MUST send a Path message with the Loopback\n   Attribute Flag defined
      above in the Attribute Flags TLV set.  The\n   mechanism defined in [RFC7570]
      is used to address the loopback\n   request to the particular node.  The ingress
      node MUST ensure that\n   the entity at which loopback is intended to occur
      is explicitly\n   identified by the immediately preceding subobject of the Explicit\n
      \  Route Object (ERO) Hop Attributes subobject.  The Administratively\n   down
      (A) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object MUST be kept set to indicate\n   that the
      LSP is still in lock mode.\n   On receipt of this Path message, the target node
      of the loopback\n   request MUST check if the LSP is in lock mode by verifying
      that the\n   Administratively down (A) bit is set in the ADMIN_STATUS Object.
      \ If\n   the bit is not set, the loopback request MUST be ignored.  If the bit\n
      \  is set, the node MUST check that the desired loopback entity is\n   explicitly
      identified by the ERO subobject prior to the ERO Hop\n   Attributes subobject.
      \ Currently, the type value MUST be verified to\n   be less than 32 (i.e., able
      to identify a specific entity where a\n   loopback can occur; see Section 4.3),
      and for type values 1 (IPv4\n   prefix) and 2 (IPv6 prefix), the prefix length
      MUST be 32 and 128,\n   respectively.  If the desired loopback entity is not
      explicitly\n   identified, the request MUST be ignored and a \"Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE\n
      \  object\" error SHOULD be generated.  Otherwise, the node SHOULD try to\n
      \  put the LSP into loopback mode.  The loopback SHOULD be enabled on\n   the
      entity identified by the ERO subobject immediately prior to the\n   ERO Hop
      Attributes subobject.  If the immediately preceding subobject\n   is a label
      subobject [RFC3473], the loopback SHOULD be enabled for\n   the direction indicated
      by the U bit of the label subobject.\n   If the node puts the LSP into loopback
      mode successfully, it MUST set\n   the Loopback Attribute Flag if it adds, per
      [RFC7570], an RRO Hop\n   Attributes subobject to the RRO of a Path or Resv
      message.  The\n   Administratively down (A) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object MUST
      be kept\n   set in the message.  If the node cannot put the LSP into loopback\n
      \  mode, it MUST send a PathErr message with the Error Code \"OAM\n   Problem\"
      [RFC7260] and the new Error Value \"Loopback Failure\".\n   When the ingress
      node intends to take the particular node out of\n   loopback mode, it MUST send
      a Path message with the Loopback\n   Attribute Flag in the Attribute Flags TLV
      cleared.  The mechanism\n   defined in [RFC7570] is used to indicate that the
      particular node\n   SHOULD exit loopback mode for this LSP.  The Administratively
      down\n   (A) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object MUST be kept set to indicate the\n
      \  LSP is still in lock mode.\n   On receipt of this Path message, the target
      node SHOULD try to take\n   the LSP out of loopback mode.  If the node takes
      the LSP out of\n   loopback mode successfully, it MUST clear the Loopback Attribute
      Flag\n   in the RRO Hop Attributes subobject and push this subobject onto the\n
      \  RRO object in the corresponding Path or Resv message.  The\n   Administratively
      down (A) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object MUST be kept\n   set in the message.
      \ Otherwise, the node MUST send a PathErr message\n   with the Error Code \"OAM
      Problem\" [RFC7260] and the new Error Value\n   \"Exit Loopback Failure\".\n
      \  After the loopback mode is cleared successfully, the ingress node MAY\n   remove
      the Lock Instruct using the mechanism defined in Section 3.1.\n   The ingress
      node MUST NOT request to exit lock mode if the LSP is\n   still in loopback
      mode.  The egress node MUST ignore such a request\n   when the LSP is still
      in loopback mode.\n"
