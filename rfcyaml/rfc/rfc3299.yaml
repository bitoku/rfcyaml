    \                          Protocol Requirements\nThis document describes the\
    \ SPIRITS protocol requirements, based on the\narchitecture presented in RFC 3136.\
    \  (SPIRITS stands for \"Service in the\nPSTN/IN Requesting InTernet Service\"\
    .)  The purpose of the protocol is\nto support services that originate in the\
    \ Public Switched Telephone\nNetwork (PSTN) and necessitate the interactions between\
    \ the PSTN and the\nInternet.  Similarly, such services are called SPIRITS services.\n\
    (Internet Call Waiting, Internet Caller-ID Delivery, and Internet Call\nForwarding\
    \ are examples of SPIRIT services, but the protocol is to\ndefine the building\
    \ blocks from which many other services can be built.)\nOn the PSTN side, the\
    \ SPIRITS services are initiated from the\nIntelligent Network (IN) entities;\
    \ the earlier IETF work on the\nPSTN/Internet Interworking (PINT) resulted in\
    \ the protocol (RFC 2848) in\nsupport of the services initiated the other way\
    \ around--from the\nInternet to PSTN.\nTo this end, this document lists general\
    \ requirements for the SPIRITS\nprotocol as well as those pertinent to IN, Wireless\
    \ IN, and PINT\nbuilding blocks.  The document also presents the SPIRITS WG consensus\
    \ on\nthe choice of the SPIRITS signaling protocol.  This memo provides\ninformation\
    \ for the Internet community.\n3297    Klyne           Jul 2002        Content\
