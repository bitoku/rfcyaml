- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   In 1998, the W3C HTML working group began work on reformulating\
    \ HTML\n   in terms of XML 1.0 [XML] and XML Namespaces [XMLNS].  The first part\n\
    \   of that work concluded in January 2000 with the publication of the\n   XHTML\
    \ 1.0 Recommendation [XHTML1], the reformulation for HTML 4.01\n   [HTML401].\n\
    \   Work continues in the Modularization of XHTML Recommendation\n   [XHTMLM12N],\
    \ the decomposition of XHTML 1.0 into modules that can be\n   used to compose\
    \ new XHTML based languages, plus a framework for\n   supporting this composition.\n\
    \   This document only registers a new MIME media type,\n   'application/xhtml+xml'.\
    \  It does not define anything more than is\n   required to perform this registration.\n\
    \   This document follows the convention set out in [XMLMIME] for the\n   MIME\
    \ subtype name; attaching the suffix \"+xml\" to denote that the\n   entity being\
    \ described conforms to the XML syntax as defined in XML\n   1.0 [XML].\n   This\
    \ document was prepared by members of the W3C HTML working group\n   based on\
    \ the structure, and some of the content, of RFC 2854, the\n   registration of\
    \ 'text/html'.  Please send comments to www-\n   html@w3.org, a public mailing\
    \ list (requiring subscription) with\n   archives at <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/>.\n"

    \ parameters:       none\n    Optional parameters:\n      charset\n         This\
    \ parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter\n         of the\
    \ \"application/xml\" media type as specified in [XMLMIME].\n      profile\n \
    \        See Section 8 of this document.\n   Encoding considerations:\n      See\
    \ Section 4 of this document.\n   Security considerations:\n      See Section\
    \ 7 of this document.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n      XHTML 1.0 [XHTML10]\
    \ specifies user agent conformance rules that\n      dictate behaviour that must\
    \ be followed when dealing with, among\n      other things, unrecognized elements.\n\
    \      With respect to XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD] and the existence\n   \
    \   of XHTML based languages (referred to as XHTML family members)\n      that\
    \ are not XHTML 1.0 conformant languages, it is possible that\n      'application/xhtml+xml'\
    \ may be used to describe some of these\n      documents.  However, it should\
    \ suffice for now for the purposes of\n      interoperability that user agents\
    \ accepting\n      'application/xhtml+xml' content use the user agent conformance\n\
    \      rules in [XHTML1].\n      Although conformant 'application/xhtml+xml' interpreters\
    \ can\n      expect that content received is well-formed XML (as defined in\n\
    \      [XML]), it cannot be guaranteed that the content is valid XHTML\n     \
    \ (as defined in [XHTML1]).  This is in large part due to the\n      reasons in\
    \ the preceding paragraph.\n   Published specification:\n      XHTML 1.0 is now\
    \ defined by W3C Recommendation; the latest\n      published version is [XHTML1].\
    \  It provides for the description of\n      some types of conformant content\
    \ as \"text/html\", but also doesn't\n      disallow the use with other content\
    \ types (effectively allowing\n      for the possibility of this new type).\n\
    \   Applications which use this media type:\n      Some content authors have already\
    \ begun hand and tool authoring on\n      the Web with XHTML 1.0.  However that\
    \ content is currently\n      described as \"text/html\", allowing existing Web\
    \ browsers to\n      process it without reconfiguration for a new media type.\n\
    \      There is no experimental, vendor specific, or personal tree\n      predecessor\
    \ to 'application/xhtml+xml'.  This new type is being\n      registered in order\
    \ to allow for the expected deployment of XHTML\n      on the World Wide Web,\
    \ as a first class XML application where\n      authors can expect that user agents\
    \ are conformant XML 1.0 [XML]\n      processors.\n   Additional information:\n\
    \      Magic number:\n         There is no single initial byte sequence that is\
    \ always present\n         for XHTML files.  However, Section 5 below gives some\n\
    \         guidelines for recognizing XHTML files. See also section 3.1 in\n  \
    \       [XMLMIME].\n      File extension:\n         There are three known file\
    \ extensions that are currently in use\n         for XHTML 1.0; \".xht\", \".xhtml\"\
    , and \".html\".\n         It is not recommended that the \".xml\" extension (defined\
    \ in\n         [XMLMIME]) be used, as web servers may be configured to\n     \
    \    distribute such content as type \"text/xml\" or\n         \"application/xml\"\
    .  [XMLMIME] discusses the unreliability of\n         this approach in section\
    \ 3.  Of course, should the author\n         desire this behaviour, then the \"\
    .xml\" extension can be used.\n      Macintosh File Type code: TEXT\n   Person\

    \   Intended usage: COMMON\n   Author/Change controller:\n      The XHTML specifications\
    \ are a work product of the World Wide Web\n      Consortium's HTML Working Group.\
    \  The W3C has change control over\n      these specifications.\n"
- title: 3. Fragment identifiers
  contents:
  - "3. Fragment identifiers\n   URI references (Uniform Resource Identifiers, see\
    \ [RFC2396] as\n   updated by [RFC2732]) may contain additional reference information,\n\
    \   identifying a certain portion of the resource. These URI references\n   end\
    \ with a number sign (\"#\") followed by an identifier for this\n   portion (called\
    \ the \"fragment identifier\"). Interpretation of\n   fragment identifiers is\
    \ dependent on the media type of the retrieval\n   result.\n   For documents labeled\
    \ as 'text/html', [RFC2854] specified that the\n   fragment identifier designates\
    \ the correspondingly named element,\n   these were identified by either a unique\
    \ id attribute or a name\n   attribute for some elements. For documents described\
    \ with the\n   application/xhtml+xml media type, fragment identifiers share the\
    \ same\n   syntax and semantics with other XML documents, see [XMLMIME], section\n\
    \   5.\n   At the time of writing, [XMLMIME] does not define syntax and\n   semantics\
    \ of fragment identifiers, but refers to \"XML Pointer\n   Language (XPointer)\"\
    \ for a future XML fragment identification\n   mechanism. The current specification\
    \ for XPointer is available at\n   http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr. Until [XMLMIME]\
    \ gets updated, fragment\n   identifiers for XHTML documents designate the element\
    \ with the\n   corresponding ID attribute value (see [XML] section 3.3.1); any\
    \ XHTML\n   element with the \"id\" attribute.\n"
- title: 4. Encoding considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Encoding considerations\n   By virtue of XHTML content being XML, it has the\
    \ same considerations\n   when sent as 'application/xhtml+xml' as does XML.  See\
    \ [XMLMIME],\n   section 3.2.\n"
- title: 5. Recognizing XHTML files
  contents:
  - "5. Recognizing XHTML files\n   All XHTML documents will have the string \"<html\"\
    \ near the beginning\n   of the document.  Some will also begin with an XML declaration\
    \ which\n   begins with \"<?xml\", though that alone does not indicate an XHTML\n\
    \   document.  All conforming XHTML 1.0 documents will include an XML\n   document\
    \ type declaration with the root element type 'html'.\n   XHTML Modularization\
    \ provides a naming convention by which a public\n   identifier for an external\
    \ subset in the document type declaration of\n   a conforming document will contain\
    \ the string \"//DTD XHTML\".  And\n   while some XHTML based languages require\
    \ the doctype declaration to\n   occur within documents of that type, such as\
    \ XHTML 1.0, or XHTML\n   Basic (http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic), it is not\
    \ the case that all\n   XHTML based languages will include it.\n   All XHTML files\
    \ should also include a declaration of the XHTML\n   namespace.  This should appear\
    \ shortly after the string \"<html\", and\n   should read 'xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\
    '.\n"
- title: 6. Charset default rules
  contents:
  - "6. Charset default rules\n   By virtue of all XHTML content being XML, it has\
    \ the same\n   considerations when sent as 'application/xhtml+xml' as does XML.\
    \  See\n   [XMLMIME], section 3.2.\n"
- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   The considerations for \"text/html\" as specified\
    \ in [TEXTHTML] and and\n   for 'application/xml' as specified in [XMLMIME], also\
    \ hold for\n   'application/xhtml+xml'.\n   In addition, because of the extensibility\
    \ features for XHTML as\n   provided by XHTML Modularization, it is possible that\n\
    \   'application/xhtml+xml' may describe content that has security\n   implications\
    \ beyond those described here.  However, if the user agent\n   follows the user\
    \ agent conformance rules in [XHTML1], this content\n   will be ignored.  Only\
    \ in the case where the user agent recognizes\n   and processes the additional\
    \ content, or where further processing of\n   that content is dispatched to other\
    \ processors, would security issues\n   potentially arise.  And in that case,\
    \ they would fall outside the\n   domain of this registration document.\n"
- title: 8. The "profile" optional parameter
  contents:
  - "8. The \"profile\" optional parameter\n   This parameter is meant to solve the\
    \ short-term problem of using MIME\n   media type based content negotiation (such\
    \ as that done with the HTTP\n   \"Accept\" header) to negotiate for a variety\
    \ of XHTML based languages.\n   It is intended to be used only during content\
    \ negotiation.  It is not\n   expected that it be used to deliver content, or\
    \ that origin web\n   servers have any knowledge of it (though they are welcome\
    \ to).  It is\n   primarily targeted for use on the network by proxies in the\
    \ HTTP\n   chain that manipulate data formats (such as transcoders).\n   The parameter\
    \ is intended to closely match the semantics of the\n   \"profile\" attribute\
    \ of the HEAD element as defined in [HTML401]\n   (section 7.4.4.3), except it\
    \ is applied to the document as a whole\n   rather than just the META elements.\
    \  More specifically, the value of\n   the profile attribute is a URI that can\
    \ be used as a name to identify\n   a language.  Though the URI need not be resolved\
    \ in order to be\n   useful as a name, it could be a namespace, schema, or a language\n\
    \   specification.\n   As an example, user agents supporting only XHTML Basic\
    \ (see\n   http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic) currently have no standard means\
    \ to\n   convey their inability to support the additional functionality in\n \
    \  XHTML 1.0 [XHTML1] that is not found in XHTML Basic.  While XHTML\n   Basic\
    \ user agent conformance rules (which are identical to XHTML 1.0)\n   provide\
    \ some guidance to its user agent implementators for handling\n   some additional\
    \ content, the additional content in XHTML 1.0 that is\n   not part of XHTML Basic\
    \ is substantial, making those conformance\n   rules insufficient for practical\
    \ processing and rendering to the end\n   user.  There is also the matter of the\
    \ potentially substantial burden\n   on the user agent in receiving and parsing\
    \ this additional content.\n   The functionality afforded by this parameter can\
    \ also be achieved\n   with at least two other more general content description\
    \ frameworks;\n   the \"Content-features\" MIME header described in RFC 2912,\
    \ and UAPROF\n   from the WAPforum (see http://www.wapforum.org/what/technical.htm).\n\
    \   At this time, choosing one of these solutions would require excluding\n  \
    \ the other, as interoperability between the two has not been defined.\n   For\
    \ this reason, it is suggested that this parameter be used until\n   such time\
    \ as that issue has been addressed.\n   An example use of this parameter as part\
    \ of a HTTP GET transaction\n   would be;\n      Accept: application/xhtml+xml;\n\
    \        profile=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd\"\n"
