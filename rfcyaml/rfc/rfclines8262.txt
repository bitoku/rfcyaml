Abstract This document specifies the Content ID header field for usage in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
This document also updates RFC 5621, which only allows a Content ID URL to reference a body part that is part of a multipart message body.
This update enables a Content ID URL to reference a complete message body and metadata provided by some additional SIP header fields.
This document updates RFC 5368 and RFC 6442 by clarifying their usage of the SIP Content ID header field.
Identifying a Body Part A SIP message consists of a start line, one or more header fields, an empty line indicating the end of the header fields, and an optional message body as specified in [RFC3261].
The message body can be a non multipart message body or a multipart message body as specified in [RFC3261].
[RFC5621] defines generic handling of a multipart message body in a SIP message.
A multipart message body contains zero, one, or several body parts encoded using the format define in [RFC2045].
A body part in the multipart message body is described using header fields such as Content Disposition, Content Encoding, and Content  Type, which provide information on the content of the body part as specified in [RFC5621].
A body part in the multipart message body can also contain a Content ID header field with an ID value uniquely identifying the body part as specified in [RFC2045].
Referencing a Body Part A SIP header field can reference a body part using a Content ID URL as specified in [RFC5621].
The Content ID URL is specified in [RFC2392].
[RFC2392] specifies how to identify the body part referenced by a Content ID URL.
The Content ID URL value is included in the Content ID header field of the body part.
Examples of SIP header fields referencing a body part using a Content ID URL are:  [RFC6442]
specifies how a Geolocation header field references a body part using a Content ID URL for providing location information.
[RFC5368] specifies how a Refer To header field references a body part using a Content ID URL to provide a list of targets.
Problem Statement How to uniquely identify a complete message body of a SIP message using a Content ID header field and how to reference a complete message body using a Content ID URL are not currently specified.
In [RFC5621], the Content ID URL references a specific body part only.
Some existing specifications, such as [RFC5368], contain examples that show usage of a SIP Content ID header field referencing a complete message body, even though such usage has never been specified.
Many implementors have interpreted these examples to indicate that such usage is allowed by the corresponding specification, despite the absence of language allowing it.
This document updates the normative language in the affected documents to explicitly allow such usage.
The examples below show the consequences of the problem described above.
If a User Agent Client (UAC) sends an INVITE request that conveys location by value (as specified in [RFC6442]) and decides not to include a Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer, then the UAC needs to include only one MIME entity in the INVITE request.
This MIME entity can be, for example, of the 'application/pidf xml' MIME type.
However, due to [RFC6442] requiring inclusion of a Geolocation header field referencing the body part with the location information, the UAC includes a multipart message body with a single body part in the INVITE request, and includes the location information of 'application/pidf xml' MIME type and an associated Content ID header field in the body part.
Example message (SIP INVITE): INVITE
9fxced76sl Call ID: 3848276298220188511@atlanta.example.com Geolocation: <cid:target123@atlanta.example.com>

usage rules> <gbp:retransmission allowed>no </gbp:retransmission allowed> <gbp:retention expiry>2010 11 14T20:00:00Z </gbp
If a UAC sends a REFER request including a list of targets as specified in [RFC5368], then the UAC needs to include only one MIME entity in the REFER request.
This MIME entity is of the 'application/resource lists xml' MIME type.
However, due to [RFC5368] requiring inclusion of a Refer To header field referencing the body part containing the list of targets, the UAC includes a multipart message body with a single body part in the REFER request and includes the list of targets of 'application/ resource lists xml' MIME type and an associated Content ID header field in the body part.

In order to solve the problems described above, this document:  Specifies and registers the Content ID header field as a SIP header field.
Specifies that, when used as a SIP header field, the Content ID header field identifies the complete message body and the metadata provided by some additional SIP header fields of the SIP message.
Updates [RFC5621] to enable a Content ID URL to reference a complete message body and the metadata provided by some additional SIP header fields.
by adding text that explicitly states that a SIP Content ID header field can be used.
If an existing specification only defines the usage of a multipart message body to carry a single body part to be referenced by a Content ID URL, implementations MUST NOT carry the MIME entity in a non multipart message body unless the specification is updated to explicitly allow it.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
Content ID Header Field 3.1.
This section defines the usage of the Content ID header field for SIP.
The ABNF [RFC5234] for the Content ID header field is: Content ID
and id right are specified in [RFC5322].
HCOLON is defined in [RFC3261].
Note: When used in a SIP header field, the msg
id syntax has been simplified, compared to the syntax in [RFC5322], to disallow the use of comments and to adopt to the SIP usage of leading white space.
The value of the Content ID header field value must be unique in the context of a given SIP message, including any embedded MIME Content ID header field values.
Note that the SIP Content ID header field value is not expected to be unique among all SIP messages; it has no meaning outside of the message in which it is included.
The Content ID header field included in the header fields of a SIP message identifies the message body of the SIP message and the metadata provided by:  A MIME Version header field, if included in the header fields of the SIP message.
Any 'Content ' prefixed header fields (including the Content ID header field itself) included in the header fields of the SIP message.
The Content ID header field can be included in any SIP message that is allowed to contain a message body.
The message body identified by the Content ID header field can be a non multipart message body or a multipart message body.
A UA MAY include a Content ID header field in any SIP message that is allowed to contain a message body.
A UA MUST NOT include a Content ID header field in any SIP message that is not allowed to contain a message body.
A UA MUST set the value of the Content ID header field to a value that is unique in the context of the SIP message.
A proxy MUST NOT add a Content ID header field in a SIP message.
A proxy MUST NOT modify a Content ID header field included in a SIP message.
A proxy MUST NOT delete a Content ID header field from a SIP message.
Example: Referencing the Message Body of a SIP Message
The figure shows an example from [RFC5368], where the SIP Content ID header field is used to reference the message body (non multipart) of a SIP message.

This section updates the second paragraph in Section 7 of [RFC5368] by allowing usage of either a MIME Content ID header field or a SIP Content ID header field to label the body part or the message body carrying the URI list.
The Refer To header field of a REFER request with multiple REFER
Targets MUST contain a pointer (i.e., a Content ID Uniform Resource Locator (URL) as per RFC 2392 [RFC2392]) that points to the body part that carries the URI list.
The REFER Issuer SHOULD NOT include any particular URI more than once in the URI list.

The REFER Issuer SHOULD NOT include any particular URI more than once in the URI list.
The REFER request can use either a MIME Content  ID header field [RFC4483] or a SIP Content ID header field [RFC8262] to label the body part or the message body.
This section updates Section 9.1 of [RFC5621] by allowing a Content  ID URL to reference a message body and the related metadata (Section 3.3) in addition to allowing a reference to a body part.
Content ID URLs allow creating references to body parts.
A given Content ID URL [RFC2392], which can appear in a header field or within a body part (e.g., in an SDP attribute), points to a particular body part.
Content ID URLs allow the creation of references to body parts or message bodies (and the header fields describing the message  bodies).
A given Content ID URL [RFC2392], which can appear in a header field or within a body part (e.g., in an SDP attribute), points to a particular body part or the message body (and the header fields describing the message body).
This section updates the second paragraph in Section 3.1 of [RFC6442] by allowing usage of either a MIME Content ID header field or a SIP Content ID header field to label the body part or the message body carrying the location data.
In Figure 1, Alice is both the Target and the LS that is conveying her location directly to Bob, who acts as an LR.
This conveyance is point to point: it does not pass through any SIP layer intermediary.
A Location Object appears by value in the initial SIP request as a MIME body, and Bob responds to that SIP request as appropriate.
There is a 'Bad Location Information' response code introduced within this document to specifically inform Alice if she conveys bad location information to Bob
(e.g., Bob "cannot parse the location provided", or "there is not enough location information to determine where Alice is").

The Content ID header field value MUST NOT reveal sensitive user information.
If the message body associated with the Content ID header field is an encrypted body, it MUST NOT be possible to derive a key that can be used to decrypt the body from the Content ID header field value.
This specification registers a new SIP header field according to the procedures defined in [RFC3261].
The header field described in Section 3 has been registered in the "Header Fields" sub registry of the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters" registry by adding a row with these values: Header Name:
