Abstract This document describes the methodology for benchmarking MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) protection mechanisms for link and node protection.
This document provides test methodologies and testbed setup for measuring failover times of Fast Reroute techniques while considering factors (such as underlying links) that might impact recovery times for real time applications bound to MPLS Traffic Engineered (MPLS TE) tunnels.
This document describes the methodology for benchmarking MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) protection mechanisms.
This document uses much of the terminology defined in [RFC6414].
Protection mechanisms provide recovery of client services from a planned or an unplanned link or node failure.
FRR protection mechanisms are generally deployed in a network infrastructure where MPLS is used for the provisioning of point to point traffic engineered tunnels (tunnel).
FRR protection mechanisms aim to reduce the service disruption period by minimizing recovery time from most common failures.
Network elements from different manufacturers behave differently to network failures, which impacts the network's ability and performance for failure recovery.
Therefore, it becomes imperative for service providers to have a common benchmark to understand the performance behaviors of network elements.
There are two factors impacting service availability: frequency of failures and duration for which the failures persist.
Failures can be classified further into two types: correlated and uncorrelated.
Correlated and uncorrelated failures may be planned or unplanned.
Planned failures are generally predictable.
Network implementations should be able to handle both planned and unplanned failures and recover gracefully within a time frame to maintain service assurance.
Hence, failover recovery time is one of the most important benchmarks that a service provider considers in choosing the building blocks for their network infrastructure.
A correlated failure is a result of the occurrence of two or more failures.
A typical example is failure of a logical resource (e.g., Layer 2 (L2) links) due to a dependency on a common physical resource (e.g., common conduit) that fails.
Within the context of MPLS protection mechanisms, failures that arise due to Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs)
[RFC4202] can be considered as correlated failures.
FRR [RFC4090] allows for the possibility that the Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be reoptimized in the minutes following failover.
IP traffic would be rerouted according to the preferred path for the post failure topology.
Thus, MPLS FRR may include additional steps following the occurrence of the failure detection and failover event [
(1)  Failover Event Primary path (working path) fails (2)
Failure Detection Failover event is detected (3a)  Failover Working path switched to backup path (3b)
Reoptimization of working path (possible change from backup path)
(4)  Restoration (see Section 3.3.5 of [RFC6414])
(5)  Reversion (see Section 3.3.6 of [RFC6414]) 2.
This document provides detailed test cases along with different topologies and scenarios that should be considered to effectively benchmark MPLS
FRR protection mechanisms and failover times on the data plane.
Different failover events and scaling considerations are also provided in this document.
All benchmarking test cases defined in this document apply to facility backup [RFC4090].
The test cases cover a set of interesting failure scenarios and the associated procedures benchmark the performance of the Device Under Test (DUT) to recover from failures.
Data plane traffic is used to benchmark failover times.
Testing scenarios related to MPLS TE protection mechanisms when applied to MPLS Transport Profile and IP fast reroute applied to MPLS networks were not considered and are outside the scope of this document.
However, the test setups considered for MPLS based L3 and L2 services consider LDP over MPLS RSVP TE configurations.
Benchmarking of correlated failures is outside the scope of this document.
Detection using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is outside the scope of this document, but it is mentioned in discussion sections.
The performance of the control plane is outside the scope of this document.
As described above, MPLS FRR may include a reoptimization of the working path, with possible packet transfer impairments.
Characterization of reoptimization is beyond the scope of this memo.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
While [RFC2119] defines the use of these key words primarily for Standards Track documents, this Informational document uses some of these key words.
The reader is assumed to be familiar with the commonly used MPLS terminology, some of which is defined in [RFC4090].
This document uses much of the terminology defined in [RFC6414].
This document also uses existing terminology defined in other BMWG documents [RFC1242]
Appendix B provides abbreviations used in the document.
General Reference Topology Figure 1 illustrates the general reference topology.
It shows the basic reference testbed and is applicable to all the test cases defined in this document.
The Tester is comprised of a Traffic Generator (TG) and Traffic Analyzer (TA) and Emulator.
A Tester is connected to the test network and, depending upon the test case, the DUT could vary.
The Tester sends and receives IP traffic to the tunnel ingress and performs signaling protocol emulation to simulate real network scenarios in a lab environment.
The Tester may also support MPLS TE signaling to act as the ingress node to the MPLS tunnel.
The lines in figures represent physical connections.
The tester MUST record the number of lost, duplicate, and out of  order packets.
It should further record arrival and departure times
so that failover time, Additive Latency, and Reversion Time can be measured.
The tester may be a single device or a test system emulating all the different roles along a primary or backup path.
The label stack is dependent on the following three entities: (1)  Type of protection (Link versus Node)
(2)  Number of remaining hops of the primary tunnel from the Point of Local Repair (PLR)
(3)  Number of remaining hops of the backup tunnel from the PLR Due to this dependency, it is RECOMMENDED that the benchmarking of failover times be performed on all the topologies provided in Section 6.
This section discusses the fundamentals of MPLS Protection testing:
The types of network events that cause failover (Section 5.1)
(2)  Indications for failover (Section 5.2) (3)
The use of data traffic (Section 5.3) (4)
Label Switched Path Scaling (Section 5.4)
IGP Selection (Section 5.5) (6)
Reversion of LSP (Section 5.6)
Traffic generation (Section 5.7) 5.1.
The failover to the backup tunnel is primarily triggered by either link or node failures observed downstream of the Point of Local Repair (PLR).
The failure events [RFC6414] are listed below.
Link Failure Events Interface Shutdown on PLR side with physical/link alarm Interface Shutdown on remote side with physical/link alarm Interface Shutdown on PLR side with RSVP
hello enabled Interface Shutdown on remote side with
RSVP hello enabled Interface Shutdown on PLR side with BFD Interface Shutdown on remote side with BFD Fiber Pull on the PLR side (both Transmit (TX) and Receive (RX) or just the TX) Fiber
Pull on the remote side (both TX and RX or just the RX)
Online Insertion and Removal (OIR) on PLR side OIR on remote side Sub interface failure on PLR side (e.g., shutting down of a VLAN)
Sub interface failure on remote side Parent interface shutdown on PLR side (an interface bearing multiple sub interfaces)
Parent interface shutdown on remote side Node Failure Events A System reload initiated by either a graceful shutdown or a power failure
A system crash due to a software failure or an assert 5.2.
Failure Detection Link failure detection [
RFC6414] time depends on the link type and failure detection protocols running.
For Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), the alarm type (such as LOS, AIS, or RDI) can be used.
Other link types have L2 alarms, but they may not provide a short enough failure detection time.
Ethernet based links enabled with MPLS/IP do not have L2 failure indicators; therefore, they rely on L3 signaling for failure detection.
However, for directly connected devices, remote fault indication in the ethernet auto negotiation scheme could be considered as a type of L2 link failure indicator.
MPLS has different failure detection techniques, such as BFD, or use of RSVP hellos.
These methods can be used for the L3 failure indicators required by ethernet based links or for some other non  ethernet based links to help improve failure detection time.
However, these fast failure detection mechanisms are out of scope.
The test procedures in this document can be used for local failure or remote failure scenarios for comprehensive benchmarking and to evaluate failover performance independent of the failure detection techniques.
Use of Data Traffic for MPLS Protection Benchmarking Currently, end customers use packet loss as a key metric for failover time [RFC6414].
Failover Packet Loss [RFC6414] is an externally observable event and has a direct impact on application performance.
MPLS protection is expected to minimize packet loss in the event of a failure.
For this reason, it is important to develop a standard router benchmarking methodology for measuring MPLS protection that uses packet loss as a metric.
At a known rate of forwarding, packet loss can be measured and the failover time can be determined.
Measurement of control plane signaling to establish backup paths is not enough to verify failover.
Failover is best determined when packets are actually traversing the backup path.
An additional benefit of using packet loss for calculation of failover time is that it allows use of a black box test environment.
Data traffic is offered at line rate to the DUT, an emulated network failure event is forced to occur, and packet loss is externally measured to calculate the convergence time.
This setup is independent of the DUT architecture.
In addition, this methodology considers the packets in error and duplicate packets [RFC4689] that could have been generated during the failover process.
The methodologies consider lost, out of order [RFC4689], and duplicate packets to be impaired packets that contribute to the failover time.
Failover time performance may vary with the number of established primary and backup tunnel LSPs and installed routes.
However, the procedure outlined here
should be used for any number of LSPs (L) and any number of routes protected by the PLR (R).
The values of L and R must be recorded.
The underlying IGP could be ISIS TE or OSPF TE for the methodology proposed here.
See [RFC6412] for IGP options to consider and report.
Restoration and Reversion Path restoration [
RFC6414] provides a method to restore an alternate primary LSP upon failure and to switch traffic from the backup path to the restored primary path (reversion).
In MPLS FRR, reversion [RFC6414] can be implemented as Global Reversion or Local Reversion.
It is important to include restoration and reversion as a step in each test case to measure the amount of packet loss, out of order packets, or duplicate packets that are produced.
Note: In addition to restoration and reversion, reoptimization can take place while the failure is still not recovered but it depends on the user configuration and reoptimization timers.
It is suggested that there be three or more traffic streams as long as there is a steady and constant rate of flow for all of the streams.
In order to monitor the DUT performance for recovery times, a set of route prefixes should be advertised before traffic is sent.
The traffic should be configured towards these routes.
Prefix dependency behaviors are key in IP, and tests with route  specific flows spread across the routing table will reveal this dependency.
Generating traffic to all of the prefixes reachable by the protected tunnel (probably in a Round Robin fashion, where the traffic is destined to all the prefixes but one prefix at a time in a cyclic manner) is not recommended.
Round Robin traffic generation is not recommended to all prefixes, as time to hit all the prefixes may be higher than the failover time.
This phenomenon will reduce the granularity of the measured results, and the results observed may not be accurate.
It is RECOMMENDED that the Tester used to execute each test case
have the following capabilities: 1.
Ability to establish MPLS TE tunnels and push/pop labels.
Ability to produce a failover event [RFC6414].
Ability to insert a timestamp in each data packet's IP payload.
An internal time clock to control timestamping, time measurements, and time calculations.
Ability to disable or tune specific L2 and L3 protocol functions on any interface.
Ability to react upon the receipt of path error from the PLR.
The Tester MAY be capable of making non data plane convergence observations and use those observations for measurements.
[RFC6414] is calculated using one of the following three methods: 1.
Packet Loss Based Method (PLBM):
(Number of packets dropped/ packets per second   1000) milliseconds.
This method could also be referred to as the Loss Derived method.
Time Based Loss Method (TBLM): This method relies on the ability of the traffic generators to provide statistics that reveal the duration of failure in milliseconds based on when the packet loss occurred (interval between non zero packet loss and zero loss).
Timestamp Based Method (TBM): This method of failover calculation is based on the timestamp that gets transmitted as payload in the packets originated by the generator.
The traffic analyzer records the timestamp of the last packet received before the failover event and the first packet after the failover and derives the time based on the difference between these two timestamps.
: The payload could also contain sequence numbers for out of order packet calculation and duplicate packets.
TBM would be able to detect reversion impairments beyond loss; thus, it is RECOMMENDED as the failover time method.
In addition to the general reference topology shown in Figure 1, this section provides detailed insight into various proposed test setups that should be considered for comprehensively benchmarking the failover time in different roles along the primary tunnel.
This section proposes a set of topologies that covers all the scenarios for local protection.
All of these topologies can be mapped to the reference topology shown in Figure 1.
Topologies provided in this section refer to the testbed required to benchmark failover time when the DUT is configured as a PLR in either head end or midpoint role.
Provided with each topology below is the label stack at the PLR.

The procedure described in this section can be applied to all eight base test cases and the associated topologies.
The backup as well as the primary tunnels are configured to be alike in terms of bandwidth usage.
In order to benchmark failover with all possible label stack depth applicable (as seen with current deployments), it is RECOMMENDED to perform all of the test cases provided in this section.
The forwarding performance test cases in Section 7.1 MUST be performed prior to performing the failover test cases.
The considerations of Section 4 of [RFC2544] are applicable when evaluating the results obtained using these methodologies as well.
[RFC6414] for MPLS protection first requires a baseline measurement of the forwarding performance of the test topology, including the DUT.
Forwarding performance is benchmarked by the throughput as defined in [RFC5695] and measured in units of packets per second (pps).
This section provides two test cases to benchmark forwarding performance.
These are with the DUT configured as a head end PLR, midpoint PLR, and egress PLR.

Packet Sizes offered to the DUT    Bytes (at L3)
No Benchmarks (to be recorded for each test case):
Security Considerations Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory environment, with dedicated address space and
the constraints specified in the sections above.
The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test management network.
Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black box" basis, relying solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.
Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for benchmarking purposes.
Any implications for network security arising from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production networks.

It also recommends the typical numbers for IGP/VPNv4 Prefixes, LSP Tunnels, and VC entries.
Based on the features supported by the DUT, appropriate scaling limits can be used for the testbed.
