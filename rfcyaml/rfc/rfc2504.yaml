- title: 2.  The Wires have Ears
  contents:
  - "2.  The Wires have Ears\n   It is a lot easier to eavesdrop on communications\
    \ over data networks\n   than to tap a telephone conversation.  Any link between\
    \ computers may\n   potentially be insecure, as can any of the computers through\
    \ which\n   data flows.  All information passing over networks may be\n   eavesdropped\
    \ on, even if you think \"No one will care about this...\"\n   Information passing\
    \ over a network may be read not only by the\n   intended audience but can be\
    \ read by others as well.  This can happen\n   to personal Email and sensitive\
    \ information that is accessed via file\n   transfer or the Web.  Please refer\
    \ to the \"Don't Get Caught in the\n   Web\" and \"Email Pitfalls\" sections for\
    \ specific information on\n   protecting your privacy.\n   As a user, your utmost\
    \ concerns should, firstly, be to protect\n   yourself against misuse of your\
    \ computer account(s) and secondly, to\n   protect your privacy.\n   Unless precautions\
    \ are taken, every time you log in over a network,\n   to any network service,\
    \ your password or confidential information may\n   be stolen.  It may then be\
    \ used to gain illicit access to systems you\n   have access to.  In some cases,\
    \ the consequences are obvious:  If\n   someone gains access to your bank account,\
    \ you might find yourself\n   losing some cash, quickly.  What is not so obvious\
    \ is that services\n   which are not financial in nature may also be abused in\
    \ rather costly\n   ways.  You may be held responsible if your account is misused\
    \ by\n   someone else!\n   Many network services involve remote log in.  A user\
    \ is prompted for\n   his or her account ID (ie. user name) and password.  If\
    \ this\n   information is sent through the network without encryption, the\n \
    \  message can be intercepted and read by others.  This is not really an\n   issue\
    \ when you are logging in to a \"dial-in\" service where you make a\n   connection\
    \ via telephone and log in, say to an online service\n   provider, as telephone\
    \ lines are more difficult to eavesdrop on than\n   Internet communications.\n\
    \   The risk is there when you are using programs to log in over a\n   network.\
    \  Many popular programs used to log in to services or to\n   transfer files (such\
    \ as telnet and ftp, respectively) send your user\n   name and password and then\
    \ your data over the network without\n   encrypting them.\n   The precaution commonly\
    \ taken against password eavesdropping by\n   larger institutions, such as corporations,\
    \ is to use one-time\n   password systems.\n   Until recently, it has been far\
    \ too complicated and expensive for\n   home systems and small businesses to employ\
    \ secure log in systems.\n   However, an increasing number of products enable\
    \ this to be done\n   without fancy hardware, using cryptographic techniques.\
    \  An example\n   of such a technique is Secure Shell [SSH], which is both freely\
    \ and\n   commercially available for a variety of platforms.  Many products\n\
    \   (including SSH-based ones) also allow data to be encrypted before it\n   is\
    \ passed over the network.\n"

- title: 3.1. The Dangers of Downloading
  contents:
  - "3.1. The Dangers of Downloading\n   An ever expanding wealth of free software\
    \ has become available on the\n   Internet.  While this exciting development is\
    \ one of the most\n   attractive aspects of using public networks, you should\
    \ also exercise\n   caution.  Some files may be dangerous.  Downloading poses\
    \ the single\n   greatest risk.\n   Be careful to store all downloaded files so\
    \ that you will remember\n   their (possibly dubious) origin.  Do not, for example,\
    \ mistake a\n   downloaded program for another program just because they have\
    \ the\n   same name.  This is a common tactic to fool users into activating\n\
    \   programs they believe to be familiar but could, in fact, be\n   dangerous.\n\
    \   Programs can use the network without making you aware of it.  One\n   thing\
    \ to keep in mind is that if a computer is connected, any program\n   has the\
    \ capability of using the network, with or without informing\n   you.  Say, for\
    \ example:\n     You download a game program from an anonymous FTP server. This\n\
    \     appears to be a shoot-em-up game, but unbeknownst to you, it\n     transfers\
    \ all your files, one by one, over the Internet to a\n     cracker's machine!\n\
    \   Many corporate environments explicitly prohibit the downloading and\n   running\
    \ of software from the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.2. Don't Get Caught in the Web
  contents:
  - "3.2. Don't Get Caught in the Web\n   The greatest risk when web browsing is downloading\
    \ files.  Web\n   browsers allow any file to be retrieved from the Internet. \
    \ See \"The\n   Dangers of Downloading\".\n   Web browsers are downloading files\
    \ even when it is not entirely\n   obvious.  Thus, the risk posed by downloading\
    \ files may be present\n   even if you do not actively go out and retrieve files\
    \ overtly.  Any\n   file which you have loaded over the network should be considered\n\
    \   possibly dangerous (even files in the web browser's cache).  Do not\n   execute\
    \ them by accident, as they may be malicious programs.\n   (Remember, programs\
    \ are files, too.  You may believe you have\n   downloaded a text file, when in\
    \ fact it is a Trojan Horse program,\n   script, etc.)\n   Web browsers may download\
    \ and execute programs on your behalf, either\n   automatically or after manual\
    \ intervention.  You may disable these\n   features.  If you leave them enabled,\
    \ be sure that you understand the\n   consequences.  You should read the security\
    \ guide which accompanies\n   your web browser as well as the security policy\
    \ of your company.  You\n   should be aware that downloaded programs may be risky\
    \ to execute on\n   your machine.  See \"What program is this, anyway?\".\n  \
    \ Web pages often include forms.  Be aware that, as with Email, data\n   sent\
    \ from a web browser to a web server is not secure.  Several\n   mechanisms have\
    \ been created to prevent this, most notably Secure\n   Sockets Layer [SSL]. \
    \ This facility has been built into many web\n   browsers.  It encrypts data sent\
    \ between the user's web browser and\n   the web server so no one along the way\
    \ can read it.\n   It is possible that a web page will appear to be genuine, but\
    \ is, in\n   fact, a forgery.  It is easy to copy the appearance of a genuine\
    \ web\n   page and possible to subvert the network protocols which contact the\n\
    \   desired web server, to misdirect a web browser to an imposter.\n   That threat\
    \ may be guarded against using SSL to verify if a web page\n   is genuine.  When\
    \ a 'secure' page has been downloaded, the web\n   browser's 'lock' or 'key' will\
    \ indicate so.  It is good to\n   double-check this: View the 'certificate' associated\
    \ with the web\n   page you have accessed.  Each web browser has a different way\
    \ to do\n   this.  The certificate will list the certificate's owner and who\n\
    \   issued it.  If these look trustworthy, you are probably OK.\n"
- title: 3.3 Email Pitfalls
  contents:
  - "3.3 Email Pitfalls\n   All the normal concerns apply to messages received via\
    \ Email that you\n   could receive any other way.  For example, the sender may\
    \ not be who\n   he or she claims to be.  If Email security software is not used,\
    \ it\n   is very difficult to determine for sure who sent a message.  This\n \
    \  means that Email itself is a not a suitable way to conduct many types\n   of\
    \ business.  It is very easy to forge an Email message to make it\n   appear to\
    \ have come from anyone.\n   Another security issue you should consider when using\
    \ Email is\n   privacy.  Email passes through the Internet from computer to\n\
    \   computer.  As the message moves between computers, and indeed as it\n   sits\
    \ in a user's mailbox waiting to be read, it is potentially\n   visible to others.\
    \ For this reason, it is wise to think twice before\n   sending confidential or\
    \ extremely personal information via Email.\n   You should never send credit card\
    \ numbers and other sensitive data\n   via unprotected Email.  Please refer to\
    \ \"The Wires Have Ears\".\n   To cope with this problem, there are privacy programs\
    \ available, some\n   of which are integrated into Email packages.\n   One service\
    \ many Email users like to use is Email forwarding.  This\n   should be used very\
    \ cautiously.  Imagine the following scenario:\n      A user has an account with\
    \ a private Internet Service Provider and\n      wishes to receive all her Email\
    \ there.  She sets it up so that her\n      Email at work is forwarded to her\
    \ private address.  All the Email\n      she would receive at work then moves\
    \ across the Internet until it\n      reaches her private account.  All along\
    \ the way, the Email is\n      vulnerable to being read.  A sensitive Email message\
    \ sent to her\n      at work could be read by a network snoop at any of the many\
    \ stops\n      along the way the Email takes.\n   Note that Email sent or received\
    \ at work may not be private.  Check\n   with your employer, as employers may\
    \ (in some instances) legally both\n   read your Email and make use of it.  The\
    \ legal status of Email\n   depends on the privacy of information laws in force\
    \ in each country.\n   Many mail programs allow files to be included in Email\
    \ messages.  The\n   files which come by Email are files like any other.  Any\
    \ way in which\n   a file can find its way onto a computer is possibly dangerous.\
    \  If\n   the attached file is merely a text message, fine.  But it may be more\n\
    \   than a text message.  If the attached file is itself a program or an\n   executable\
    \ script, extreme caution should be applied before running\n   it.  See the section\
    \ entitled \"The Dangers of Downloading\".\n"
- title: 3.4 Passwords
  contents:
  - "3.4 Passwords\n   Passwords may be easily guessed by an intruder unless precautions\
    \ are\n   taken.  Your password should contain a mixture of numbers, upper and\n\
    \   lower case letters, and punctuation.  Avoid all real words in any\n   language,\
    \ or combinations of words, license plate numbers, names and\n   so on.  The best\
    \ password is a made-up sequence (e.g., an acronym\n   from a phrase you won't\
    \ forget), such as \"2B*Rnot2B\" (but don't use\n   this password!).\n   Resist\
    \ the temptation to write your password down.  If you do, keep\n   it with you\
    \ until you remember it, then shred it!  NEVER leave a\n   password taped onto\
    \ a terminal or written on a whiteboard.  You\n   wouldn't write your PIN code\
    \ on your automated teller machine (ATM)\n   card, would you?  You should have\
    \ different passwords for different\n   accounts, but not so many passwords that\
    \ you can't remember them.\n   You should change your passwords periodically.\n\
    \   You should also NEVER save passwords in scripts or login procedures\n   as\
    \ these could be used by anyone who has access to your machine.\n   Be certain\
    \ that you are really logging into your system.  Just\n   because a login prompt\
    \ appears and asks you for your password does\n   not mean you should enter it.\
    \  Avoid unusual login prompts and\n   immediately report them to your security\
    \ point-of-contact.  If you\n   notice anything strange upon logging in, change\
    \ your password.\n   Unless precautions have been taken to encrypt your password\
    \ when it\n   is sent over the network, you should, if possible, use \"one-time\n\
    \   passwords\" whenever you log in to a system over a network.  (Some\n   applications\
    \ take care of that for you.)  See \"The Wires Have Ears\"\n   for more information\
    \ on the risks associated with logging in over a\n   network.\n"
- title: 3.5 Viruses and Other Illnesses
  contents:
  - "3.5 Viruses and Other Illnesses\n   Viruses are essentially unwanted pieces of\
    \ software that find their\n   way onto a computer.  What the virus may do once\
    \ it has entered its\n   host, depends on several factors:  What has the virus\
    \ been programmed\n   to do?  What part of the computer system has the virus attacked?\n\
    \   Some viruses are 'time bombs' which activate only when given a\n   particular\
    \ condition, such as reaching a certain date.  Others remain\n   latent in the\
    \ system until a particular afflicted program is\n   activated.  There are still\
    \ others which are continually active,\n   exploiting every opportunity to do\
    \ mischief.  A subtle virus may\n   simply modify a system's configuration, then\
    \ hide.\n   Be cautious about what software you install on your system.  Use\n\
    \   software from \"trusted sources\", if possible.  Check your site policy\n\
    \   before installing any software:  Some sites only allow administrators\n  \
    \ to install software to avoid security and system maintenance\n   problems.\n\
    \   Centrally-administered sites have their own policy and tools for\n   dealing\
    \ with the threat of viruses.  Consult your site policy or find\n   out from your\
    \ systems administrator what the correct procedures are\n   to stay virus free.\n\
    \   You should report it if a virus detection tool indicates that your\n   system\
    \ has a problem.  You should notify your site's systems\n   administrators as\
    \ well as the person you believe passed the virus to\n   you.  It is important\
    \ to remain calm.  Virus scares may cause more\n   delay and confusion than an\
    \ actual virus outbreak.  Before announcing\n   the virus widely, make sure you\
    \ verify its presence using a virus\n   detection tool, if possible, with the\
    \ assistance of\n   technically-competent personnel.\n   Trojan Horse programs\
    \ and worms are often categorized with viruses.\n   Trojan Horse programs are\
    \ dealt with in the \"What Program is This,\n   Anyway?\" section.  For the purposes\
    \ of this section, worms should be\n   considered a type of virus.\n"
- title: 3.6 Modems
  contents:
  - "3.6 Modems\n   You should be careful when attaching anything to your computer,\
    \ and\n   especially any equipment which allows data to flow.  You should get\n\
    \   permission before you connect anything to your computer in a\n   centrally-administered\
    \ computing environment.\n   Modems present a special security risk.  Many networks\
    \ are protected\n   by a set of precautions designed to prevent a frontal assault\
    \ from\n   public networks.  If your computer is attached to such a network, you\n\
    \   must exercise care when also using a modem.  It is quite possible to\n   use\
    \ the modem to connect to a remote network while *still* being\n   connected to\
    \ the 'secure' net.  Your computer can now act as a hole\n   in your network's\
    \ defenses.  Unauthorized users may be able to get\n   onto your organization's\
    \ network through your computer!\n   Be sure you know what you are doing if you\
    \ leave a modem on and set\n   up your computer to allow remote computers to dial\
    \ in.  Be sure you\n   use all available security features correctly.  Many modems\
    \ answer\n   calls by default.  You should turn auto-answer off unless you are\n\
    \   prepared to have your computer respond to callers.  Some 'remote\n   access'\
    \ software requires this.  Be sure to turn on all the security\n   features of\
    \ your 'remote access' software before allowing your\n   computer to be accessed\
    \ by phone.\n   Note that having an unlisted number will not protect you from\
    \ someone\n   breaking into your computer via a phone line.  It is very easy to\n\
    \   probe many phone lines to detect modems and then launch attacks.\n"

    \ file\n   systems require care and maintenance.  There are two categories of\n\
    \   such systems:\n    - Files to share\n      Shared files may be visible to\
    \ everyone or to a restricted group\n      of other users.  Each system has a\
    \ different way of specifying\n      this.  Learn how to control sharing permissions\
    \ of files and\n      implement such control without fail.\n    - Protected files\n\
    \      These include files that only you should have access to, but\n      which\
    \ are also available to anyone with system administrator\n      privileges.  An\
    \ example of this are files associated with the\n      delivery of Email.  You\
    \ don't want other users to read your Email,\n      so make sure such files have\
    \ all the necessary file permissions\n      set accordingly.\n"

  - "3.9 Encrypt Everything\n      Additionally, there are files that are private.\
    \  You may have files\n      which you do not wish anyone else to have access\
    \ to.  In this case,\n      it is prudent to encrypt the file.  This way, even\
    \ if your network is\n      broken into or the systems administrator turns into\
    \ Mr. Hyde, your\n      confidential information will not be available.  Encryption\
    \ is also\n      very important if you share a computer.  For example, a home\
    \ computer\n      may be shared by room mates who are friends but prefer to keep\
    \ their\n      Email and financial information private.  Encryption allows for\n\
    \      shared yet private usage.\n      Before you encrypt files, you should check\
    \ your site's security\n      policy.  Some employers and countries expressly\
    \ forbid or restrict\n      the storing and/or transferring of encrypted files.\n\
    \      Be careful with the passwords or keys you use to encrypt files.\n     \
    \ Locking them away safely not only helps to keep them from prying eyes\n    \
    \  but it will help you keep them secure too; for if you lose them, you\n    \
    \  will lose your ability to decrypt your data as well!  It may be wise\n    \
    \  to save more than one copy.  This may even be required, if your\n      company\
    \ has a key escrow policy, for example.  This protects against\n      the possibility\
    \ that the only person knowing a pass phrase may leave\n      the company or be\
    \ struck by lightning.\n      Whilst encryption programs are readily available,\
    \ it should be noted\n      that the quality can vary widely.  PGP (which stands\
    \ for \"Pretty Good\n      Privacy\") for example, offers a strong encryption\
    \ capability.  Many\n      common software applications include the capability\
    \ to encrypt data.\n      The encryption facilities in these are typically very\
    \ weak.\n      You should not be intimidated by encryption software.  Easy-to-use\n\
    \      software is being made available.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.11 What Program is This, Anyway?\n      Programs have become much more complex\
    \ in recent years.  They are\n      often extensible in ways which may be dangerous.\
    \  These extensions\n      make applications more flexible, powerful and customizable.\
    \  They\n      also open the end-user up to all sorts of risks.\n    - A program\
    \ may have \"plug-in\" modules.  You should not trust the\n      plug-ins simply\
    \ because you are used to trusting the programs\n      they plug into.  For example:\
    \ Some web pages suggest that the\n      user download a plug-in to view or use\
    \ some portion of the web\n      page's content.  Consider: What is this plug-in?\

    \ some safeguards to make sure that these\n      programs may be used safely,\
    \ there have been security flaws\n      discovered in the past.  For this reason,\

- title: 4.  Paranoia is Good
  contents:
  - "4.  Paranoia is Good\n   Many people do not realize it, but social engineering\
    \ is a tool which\n   many intruders use to gain access to computer systems. \
    \ The general\n   impression that people have of computer break-ins is that they\
    \ are\n   the result of technical flaws in computer systems which the intruders\n\
    \   have exploited.  People also tend to think that break-ins are purely\n   technical.\
    \  However, the truth is that social engineering plays a big\n   part in helping\
    \ an attacker slip through security barriers.  This\n   often proves to be an\
    \ easy stepping-stone onto the protected system\n   if the attacker has no authorized\
    \ access to the system at all.\n   Social engineering may be defined, in this\
    \ context, as the act of\n   gaining the trust of legitimate computer users to\
    \ the point where\n   they reveal system secrets or help someone, unintentionally,\
    \ to gain\n   unauthorized access to their system(s).  Using social engineering,\
    \ an\n   attacker may gain valuable information and/or assistance that could\n\
    \   help break through security barriers with ease.  Skillful social\n   engineers\
    \ can appear to be genuine but are really full of deceit.\n   Most of the time,\
    \ attackers using social enginering work via\n   telephone.  This not only provides\
    \ a shield for the attacker by\n   protecting his or her identity, it also makes\
    \ the job easier because\n   the attacker can claim to be a particular someone\
    \ with more chances\n   of getting away with it.\n   There are several types of\
    \ social engineering.  Here are a few\n   examples of the more commonly-used ones:\n\
    \    - An attacker may pretend to be a legitimate end-user who is new to\n   \
    \   the system or is simply not very good with computers.  This\n      attacker\
    \ may approach systems administrators and other end-users\n      for help.  This\
    \ \"user\" may have lost his password, or simply can't\n      get logged into\
    \ the system and needs to access the system\n      urgently.  Attackers have also\
    \ been known to identify themselves\n      as some VIP in the company, screaming\
    \ at administrators to get\n      what they want.  In such cases, the administrator\
    \ (or it could be\n      an end-user) may feel threatened by the caller's authority\
    \ and\n      give in to the demands.\n    - Attackers who operate via telephone\
    \ calls may never even have seen\n      the screen display on your system before.\
    \  In such cases, the\n      trick attackers use is to make details vague, and\
    \ get the user to\n      reveal more information on the system.  The attacker\
    \ may sound\n      really lost so as to make the user feel that he is helping\
    \ a\n      damsel in distress.  Often, this makes people go out their way to\n\
    \      help.  The user may then reveal secrets when he is off-guard.\n    - An\
    \ attacker may also take advantage of system problems that have\n      come to\
    \ his attention.  Offering help to a user is an effective\n      way to gain the\
    \ user's trust.  A user who is frustrated with\n      problems he is facing will\
    \ be more than happy when someone comes\n      to offer some help.  The attacker\
    \ may come disguised as the\n      systems administrator or maintenance technician.\
    \  This attacker\n      will often gain valuable information because the user\
    \ thinks that\n      it is alright to reveal secrets to technicians.  Site visits\
    \ may\n      pose a greater risk to the attacker as he may not be able to make\n\
    \      an easy and quick get-away, but the risk may bring fruitful\n      returns\
    \ if the attacker is allowed direct access to the system by\n      the naive user.\n\
    \    - Sometimes, attackers can gain access into a system without prior\n    \
    \  knowledge of any system secret nor terminal access.  In the same way\n    \
    \  that one should not carry someone else's bags through Customs, no user\n  \
    \    should key in commands on someone's behalf.  Beware of attackers who\n  \
    \    use users as their own remotely-controlled fingers to type commands on\n\
    \      the user's keyboard that the user does not understand, commands which\n\
    \      may harm the system.  These attackers will exploit system software\n  \
    \    bugs and loopholes even without direct access to the system.  The\n     \
    \ commands keyed in by the end-user may bring harm to the system, open\n     \
    \ his own account up for access to the attacker or create a hole to\n      allow\
    \ the attacker entry (at some later time) into the system.  If you\n      are\
    \ not sure of the commands you have been asked to key in, do not\n      simply\
    \ follow instructions.  You never know what and where these could\n      lead\
    \ to...\n   To guard against becoming a victim of social engineering, one\n  \
    \ important thing to remember is that passwords are secret.  A password\n   for\
    \ your personal account should be known ONLY to you.  The systems\n   administrators\
    \ who need to do something to your account will not\n   require your password.\
    \  As administrators, the privileges they have\n   will allow them to carry out\
    \ work on your account without the need\n   for you to reveal your password. \
    \ An administrator should not have to\n   ask you for your password.\n   Users\
    \ should guard the use of their accounts, and keep them for their\n   own use.\
    \  Accounts should not be shared, not even temporarily with\n   systems administrators\
    \ or systems maintenance techinicians.  Most\n   maintenance work will require\
    \ special privileges which end-users are\n   not given.  Systems administrators\
    \ will have their own accounts to\n   work with and will not need to access computer\
    \ systems via an\n   end-user's account.\n   Systems maintenance technicians who\
    \ come on site should be\n   accompanied by the local site administrator (who\
    \ should be known to\n   you).  If the site administrator is not familiar to you,\
    \ or if the\n   technician comes alone, it is wise to give a call to your known\
    \ site\n   administrator to check if the technician should be there.  Yet, many\n\
    \   people will not do this because it makes them look paranoid and it is\n  \
    \ embarrassing to show that they have no, or little trust in these\n   visitors.\n\
    \   Unless you are very sure that the person you are speaking to is who he\n \
    \  or she claims to be, no secret information should ever be revealed to\n   such\
    \ people.  Sometimes, attackers may even be good enough to make\n   themselves\
    \ sound like someone whose voice you know over the phone.  It\n   is always good\
    \ to double check the identity of the person.  If you are\n   unable to do so,\
    \ the wisest thing to do is not to reveal any secrets.\n   If you are a systems\
    \ administrator, there should be security\n   procedures for assignment and reassignment\
    \ of passwords to users, and\n   you should follow such procedures.  If you are\
    \ an end-user, there\n   should not be any need for you to have to reveal system\
    \ secrets to\n   anyone else.  Some companies assign a common account to multiple\n\
    \   users.  If you happen to be in such a group, make sure you know\n   everyone\
    \ in that group so you can tell if someone who claims to be in\n   the group is\
    \ genuine.\n"

    \ carefully.  Make sure that it is clear\n      when services are being run on\
    \ your computer.  If network services\n      are activated, make sure they are\
    \ properly configured (set all\n      permissions so as to prevent anonymous or\
    \ guest logins, and so\n      on).  Increasingly, many programs have networking\
    \ capabilities\n      built in to them.  Learn how to properly configure and safely\
    \ use\n      these features.\n    - Back up user data.  This is always important.\
    \  Backups are\n      normally thought of as a way of ensuring you will not lose\
    \ your\n      work if a hard disk fails or if you make a mistake and delete a\n\
    \      file.  Backing up is also critical to insure that data cannot be\n    \
    \  lost due to a computer security incident.  One of the most vicious\n      and\
    \ unfortunately common threats posed by computer viruses and\n      Trojan Horse\
    \ programs is erasing a computer's hard disk.\n    - Obtain virus checking software\
    \ or security auditing tools.  Learn\n      how to use them and install them before\
    \ connecting to a public\n      network.  Many security tools require that they\
    \ be run on a\n      \"clean\" system, so that comparisons can be made between\
    \ the\n      present and pristine states.  Thus, it is necessary for some work\n\
    \      to be done ahead of time.\n    - Upgrade networking software regularly.\
    \  As new versions of\n      programs come out, it is prudent to upgrade.  Security\n\
    \      vulnerabilities will likely have been fixed.  The longer you wait\n   \
    \   to do this, the greater the risk that security vulnerabilities of\n      the\
    \ products will be become known and be exploited by some network\n      assailant.\
    \  Keep up to date!\n    - Find out who to contact if you suspect trouble.  Does\
    \ your\n      Internet Service Provider have a security contact or Help Desk?\n\
    \      Investigate this before trouble happens so you won't lose time\n      trying\
    \ to figure it out should trouble occur.  Keep the contact\n      information\
    \ both online and offline for easy retrieval.\n   There are 3 ways to avoid problems\
    \ with viruses:\n      1. Don't be promiscuous\n      If at all possible, be cautious\
    \ about what software you install on\n      your system. If you are unaware of\
    \ or unsure of the origin of a\n      program, it is wise not to run it.  Obtain\
    \ software from trusted\n      sources.  Do not execute programs or reboot using\
    \ old diskettes\n      unless you have reformatted them, especially if the old\
    \ diskettes\n      have been used to bring software home from a trade show and\
    \ other\n      potentially security-vulnerable places.\n      Nearly all risk\
    \ of getting infected by viruses can be eliminated\n      if you are extremely\
    \ cautious about what files are stored on your\n      computer.  See \"The Dangers\
    \ of Downloading\" for more details.\n   2. Scan regularly.\n      Give your system\
    \ a regular check-up.  There are excellent\n      virus checking and security\
    \ audit tools for most computer\n      platforms available today.  Use them, and\
    \ if possible, set them to\n      run automatically and regularly.  Also, install\
    \ updates of these\n      tools regularly and keep yourself informed of new virus\
    \ threats.\n   3. Notice the unusual.\n      It's not true that a difference you\
    \ cannot detect is no difference\n      at all, but it is a good rule of thumb.\
    \  You should get used to\n      the way your system works.  If there is an unexplainable\
    \ change\n      (for instance, files you believe should exist are gone, or strange\n\
    \      new files are appearing and disk space is 'vanishing'), you should\n  \
    \    check for the presense of viruses.\n   You should take some time to be familiar\
    \ with computer virus\n   detection tools available for your type of computer.\
    \  You should use\n   an up-to-date tool (i.e. not older than three months). \
    \ It is very\n   important to test your computer if you have been using shared\n\
    \   software of dubious origin, someone else's used floppy disks to\n   transfer\
    \ files, and so on.\n"

  - "6.2 What To Do if You Suspect Trouble\n   If you suspect that your home computer\
    \ has a virus, that a malicious\n   program has been run, or that a system has\
    \ been broken into, the\n   wisest course of action is to first disconnect the\
    \ system from all\n   networks.  If available, virus detection or system auditing\
    \ software\n   should be used.\n   Checking vital system files for corruption,\
    \ tampering or malicious\n   replacement is very tedious work to do by hand. \
    \ Fortunately there are\n   many virus detection programs available for PCs and\
    \ Macintosh\n   computers.  There are security auditing programs available for\n\
    \   UNIX-based computers.  If software is downloaded from the network, it\n  \
    \ is wise to run virus detection or auditing tools regularly.\n   If it becomes\
    \ clear that a home system has been attacked, it is time\n   to clean up.  Ideally,\
    \ a system should be rebuilt from scratch.  This\n   means erasing everything\
    \ on the hard disk.  Next, install the\n   operating system and then all additional\
    \ software the system needs.\n   It is best to install the operating system and\
    \ additional software\n   from the original distribution diskettes or CD-roms,\
    \ rather than from\n   backup storage.  The reason for this is that a system may\
    \ have been\n   broken into some time ago, so the backed up system or program\
    \ files\n   may already include some altered files or viruses.  Restoring a system\n\
    \   from scratch is tedious but worthwhile.  Do not forget to re-install\n   all\

  - "7.1 Beware of Daemons\n   A home system which uses PPP to connect directly to\
    \ the Internet is\n   increasingly common.  These systems are at the greatest\
    \ risk if they\n   run certain kinds of programs called \"services\".  If you\
    \ run a\n   service, you are in effect making your computer available to others\n\
    \   across the network.  Some services include:\n   - File servers (an NFS server,\
    \ a PC with 'file sharing' turned on)\n   - An FTP server\n   - A Web server\n\
    \   There are, in general, two types of programs which operate on the\n   Internet:\
    \  Clients (like web browsers and Email programs) and Servers\n   (like web servers\
    \ and mail servers).\n   Most software which runs on home systems is of the client\
    \ variety;\n   but, increasingly, server software is available on traditionally\n\
    \   client platforms (e.g., PCs).  Server software which runs in the\n   background\
    \ is referred to as a \"daemon\" (pronounced dee-mon).  Many\n   Internet server\
    \ software programs that run as daemons have names that\n   end in `d', like \"\
    inetd\" (Internet Daemon) and \"talkd\" (Talk Daemon).\n   When set to run, these\
    \ programs wait for clients to request some\n   particular service from across\
    \ the network.\n   There are four very important things to keep in mind as far\
    \ as the\n   security implications of running services on a home computer are\n\
    \   concerned.\n    - First and most important, if a server is not properly configured,\n\
    \      it is very vulnerable to being attacked over a network.  It is\n      vital,\
    \ if you run services, to be familiar with the proper\n      configuration.  This\
    \ is often not easy, and may require training\n      or technical expertise.\n\
    \    - All software has flaws, and flaws exploited deviously can be used\n   \
    \   to breach computer security.  If you run a server on your home\n      machine,\
    \ you have to stay aware.  This requires work:  You have to\n      stay in touch\
    \ with the supplier of the software to get security\n      updates.  It is highly\
    \ recommended that you keep up with security\n      issues through on-line security\
    \ forums. See [RFC2196] for a list\n      of references.\n      If security flaws\
    \ in your server software are discovered, you will\n      need to either stop\
    \ using the software or apply \"patches\" or\n      \"fixes\" which eliminate\
    \ the vulnerability.  The supplier of the\n      software, if it is a decent company\
    \ or freeware author, will\n      supply information and updates to correct security\
    \ flaws.  These\n      \"patches\" or \"fixes\" must be installed as soon as possible.\n\
    \    - As a rule of thumb, the older the software, the greater the chance\n  \
    \    that it has known vulnerabilities. This is not to say you should\n      simply\
    \ trust brand new software either!  Often, it takes time to\n      discover even\
    \ obvious security flaws in servers.\n    - Some servers start up without any\
    \ warning.  There are some web\n      browsers and telnet clients which automatically\
    \ start FTP servers\n      if not explicitly configured to not do so.  If these\
    \ servers are\n      not themselves properly configured, the entire file system\
    \ of the\n      home computer can become available to anyone on the Internet.\n\
    \   In general, any software MAY start up a network daemon.  The way to\n   be\
    \ safe here is to know the products you are using.  Read the manual,\n   and if\
    \ any questions arise, call the company or mail the author of\n   free software\
    \ to find out if you are actually running a service by\n   using the product.\n\
    \   A home user running a remote login service on his home machine faces\n   very\
    \ serious risks.  This service allows the home user to log in to\n   his home\
    \ machine from other computers on the Internet and can be\n   quite convenient.\
    \  But the danger is that someone will secretly\n   observe the logging in and\
    \ then be able to masquerade as the user\n   whenever they choose to do so in\
    \ the future.  See \"The Wires Have\n   Ears\" which suggests precautions to take\
    \ for remote log in.\n   If possible, activate all \"logging\" options in your\
    \ server software\n   which relate to security.  You need to review these logs\
    \ regularly in\n   order to gain any benefit from this logging.  You should also\
    \ be\n   aware that logs often grow very quickly in size, so you need to be\n\
    \   careful they don't fill up your hard disk!\n"

    \ set of rules and guidelines that specify in more or less detail\n      the expectations\
    \ in regard to appropriate use of systems or\n      networks.\n   Account\n  \
    \    See (Computer) Account\n   Anonymous and Guest Log In\n      Services may\
    \ be made available without any kind of authentication.\n      This is commonly\
    \ done, for instance, with the FTP protocol to\n      allow anonymous access.\
    \  Other systems provide a special account\n      named \"guest\" to provide access,\
    \ typically restricting the\n      privileges of this account.\n   Auditing Tool\n\
    \      Tools to analyze computer systems or networks in regard to their\n    \
    \  security status or in relation to the set of services provided by\n      them.\
    \  COPS (Computer Oracle Password and Security analyzer) and\n      SATAN (Security\
    \ Administrator's Tool for Analyzing Networks) are\n      famous examples of such\
    \ tools.\n   Authentication\n      Authentication refers to mechanisms which are\
    \ used to verify the\n      identity of a user.  The process of authentication\
    \ typically\n      requires a name and a password to be supplied by the user as\
    \ proof\n      of his identity.\n   Centrally-Administered Network\n      A network\
    \ of systems which is the responsibility of a single group\n      of administrators\
    \ who are not distributed but work centrally to\n      take care of the network.\n\
    \   Certificate\n      Certificates are data which is used to verify digital signatures.\n\
    \      A certificate is only as trustworthy as the agency which issued\n     \
    \ it.  A certificate is used to verify a particular signed item,\n      such as\
    \ an Email message or a web page.  The digital signature,\n      the item and\
    \ the certificate are all processed by a mathematical\n      program. It is possible\
    \ to say, if the signature is valid, that\n      \"According to the agency which\
    \ issued the certificate, the signer\n      was (some name)\".\n   Clean System\n\
    \      A computer which has been freshly installed with its operating\n      system\
    \ and software obtainied from trusted software distribution\n      media.  As\
    \ more software and configuration are added to a\n      computer, it becomes increasingly\
    \ difficult to determine if the\n      computer is 'clean' or has been compromised\
    \ by viruses, trojan\n      horse or misconfiguration which reduces the security\
    \ of the\n      system.\n   Client\n      Depending on the point of view, a client\
    \ might be a computer\n      system which an end-user uses to access services\
    \ hosted on another\n      computer system called a server.  'Client' may also\
    \ refer to a\n      program or a part of a system that is used by an end-user\
    \ to\n      access services provided by another program (for example, a web\n\
    \      browser is a client that accesses pages provided by a Web Server).\n  \
    \ Compound Documents\n      A 'document' is a file containing (a set of) data.\
    \  Files may\n      consist of multiple parts: a plain document, an encrypted\n\
    \      document, a digitally-signed documents or a compressed document.\n    \
    \  Multi-part files are known as compound documents and may require a\n      variety\
    \ of programs to be used in order to interpret and\n      manipulate it.  These\
    \ programs may be used without the user's\n      knowledge.\n   (Computer) Account\n\
    \      This term describes the authorization to access a specific\n      computer\
    \ system or network.  Each end-user has to use an account,\n      which consists\
    \ most probably of a combination of user name and\n      password or another means\
    \ of proving that the end-user is the\n      person the account is assigned to.\n\
    \   Configuring Network Services\n      The part of an administrator's task that\
    \ is related to specifying\n      the conditions and details of network services\
    \ that govern the\n      service provision.  In regard to a Web server, this includes\
    \ which\n      Web pages are available to whom and what kind of information is\n\
    \      logged for later review purposes.\n   Cookies\n      Cookies register information\
    \ about a visit to a web site for\n      future use by the server.  A server may\
    \ receive information of\n      cookies of other sites as well which create concern\
    \ in terms of\n      breach of privacy.\n   Cracker\n      This term is used to\
    \ describe attackers, intruders or other bad\n      guys that do not play by the\
    \ rules and try to circumvent security\n      mechanisms and/or attack individuals\
    \ and organisations.\n   Daemons (inetd, talkd, etc.)\n      These are processes\
    \ that run on computer systems to provide\n      services to other computer systems\
    \ or processes.  Typically,\n      daemons are considered \"servers\".\n   Decrypting\n\
    \      The process of reversing the encryption of a file or message to\n     \
    \ recover the original data in order to use or read it.\n   Default Account\n\
    \      Some systems and server software come with preconfigured accounts.\n  \
    \    These accounts may be set up with a predefined (user name and)\n      password\
    \ to allow anyone access and are often put there to make it\n      convenient\
    \ for users to login initially.  Default accounts should\n      be turned off\
    \ or have their predefined passwords changed, to\n      reduce the risk of abuse\
    \ to the system.\n   Dial-in Service\n      A way of providing access to computer\
    \ systems or networks via a\n      telecommunications network.  A computer uses\
    \ a modem to make a\n      telephone call to a another modem, which in turn provides\
    \ 'network\n      access service'.  See also: PPP.\n   Digital Signature\n   \
    \   A digital signature is created by a mathematical computer program.\n     \
    \ It is not a hand-written signature nor a computer-produced picture\n      of\
    \ one.  The signature is like a wax seal that requires a special\n      stamp\
    \ to produce it, and is attached to an Email message or file.\n      The origin\
    \ of the message or file may then be verified by the\n      digital signature\
    \ (using special tools).\n   Downloaded Software\n      Software packages retrieved\
    \ from the Internet (using, for example,\n      the FTP protocol).\n   Downloading\n\
    \      The act of retrieving files from a server on the network.\n   Email Packages\n\
    \      To communicate via electronic mail, an end-user usually makes use\n   \
    \   of an Email client that provides the user-interface to create,\n      send,\
    \ retrieve and read Email. Various different Email packages\n      provide the\
    \ same set of basic functions but have different user-\n      interfaces and perhaps,\
    \ special/extra functions.  Some Email\n      packages provide encryption and\
    \ digital signature capabilities.\n   Email Security Software\n      Software\
    \ which provides security through digital signatures and\n      encryption (and\
    \ decryption) to enable the end-user to protect\n      messages and documents\
    \ prior to sending them over a possibly\n      insecure network.  PGP is an example\
    \ of such software.\n   Encrypting / Encryption\n      This is a mathematical\
    \ process of scambling data for privacy\n      protection.\n   Encryption Software\n\
    \      The software that actually provides the needed functionality for\n    \
    \  end users to encrypt messages and files. PGP is one example.\n   End-User\n\
    \      An (human) individual that makes use of computer systems and\n      networks.\n\
    \   Files (programs, data, text and so on)\n      Files include user data, but\
    \ also programs, the computer operating\n      system and the system's configuration\
    \ data.\n   File Server\n      A computer system that provides a way of sharing\
    \ and working on\n      files stored on the system among users with access to\
    \ these files\n      over a network.\n   File Transfer\n      The process of transferring\
    \ files between two computer systems\n      over a network, using a protocol such\
    \ as FTP or HTTP.\n   Fixes, Patches and installing them\n      Vendors, in response\
    \ to the discovery of security vulnerabilities,\n      provide sets of files that\
    \ have to be installed on computer\n      systems.  These files 'fix' or 'patch'\
    \ the computer system or\n      programs and remove the security vulnerability.\n\
    \   FTP (File Transfer Protocol)\n      A protocol that allows for the transfer\
    \ of files between an FTP\n      client and FTP server.\n   Group of Users\n \
    \     Security software often allow permissions to be set for groups (of\n   \
    \   users) as opposed to individuals.\n   Help Desk\n      A support entity that\
    \ can be called upon to get help with a\n      computer or communication problem.\n\
    \   Internet\n      A collection of interconnected networks that use a common\
    \ set of\n      protocols called the TCP/IP stack to enable communication between\n\
    \      the connected computer systems.\n   Key Escrow\n      Keys are used to\
    \ encrypt and decrypt files.  key escrow is used to\n      store keys for use\
    \ by third parties to access the data in\n      encrypted files.\n   Keys Used\
    \ to Encrypt and Decrypt Files\n      To make use of encryption, an end-user has\
    \ to provide some secret,\n      in the form of some data, usually called a key.\n\
    \   Log In, Logging into a System\n      This is an action performed by an end-user,\
    \ when he authenticates\n      himself to a computer system.\n   Log In Prompt\n\
    \      The characters that are displayed when logging into a system to\n     \
    \ ask for user name and password.\n   Logged In\n      If an end-user has successfully\
    \ proven to have legitimate access\n      to a system, he is considered to be\
    \ logged in.\n   Logging\n      Systems and server software often provide the\
    \ ability to keep\n      track of events.  Events may be configured to be written\
    \ out to a\n      file known as a log.  The log file can be read later and allows\n\
    \      for system failures and security breaches to be identified.\n   Masquerade\
    \ (see Remote Log In)\n      Anyone who pretends to be someone they are not in\
    \ order to obtain\n      access to a computer account is said to be in 'masquerade'.\
    \  This\n      may be accomplished by providing a false user name, or stealing\n\
    \      someone else's password and logging in as him.\n   Network File System\
    \ (NFS, file sharing with PCs, etc.)\n      NFS is an application and protocol\
    \ suite that provides a way of\n      sharing files between clients and servers.\
    \ There are other\n      protocols which provide file access over networks.  These\
    \ provide\n      similar functionality, but do not interoperate with each other.\n\
    \   Networking Features of Software\n      Some software has features which make\
    \ use of the network to\n      retrieve or share data.  It may not be obvious\
    \ that software has\n      networking features.\n   Network Services\n      Services\
    \ which are not provided on the local computer system the\n      end-user is working\
    \ on but on a server located in the network.\n   One-Time Passwords (OTP)\n  \
    \    Instead of using the same password over and over again, a\n      different\
    \ password is used on each subsequent log in.\n   Passphrase\n      A passphrase\
    \ is a long password.  It is often composed of several\n      words and symbols\
    \ to make it harder to guess.\n   Password-Locked Screensaver\n      A screen\
    \ saver obscures the normal display of a monitor.  A\n      password-locked screensaver\
    \ can only be deactivated if the end-\n      user's password is supplied.  This\
    \ prevents a logged-in system\n      from being abused and hides the work currently\
    \ being done from\n      passers-by.\n   Patch\n      See \"Fixes, Patches and\
    \ installing them\"\n   Permissions\n      Another word for the access controls\
    \ that are used to control the\n      access to files and other resources.\n \
    \  PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)\n      PGP is an application package that provides\
    \ tools to encrypt and\n      digitally sign files on computer systems.  It is\
    \ especially useful\n      to encrypt and/or sign files and messages before sending\
    \ them via\n      Email.\n   Plug-in Modules\n      Software components that integrate\
    \ into other software (such as\n      web browsers) to provide additional features.\n\
    \   Point-of-Contact, Security\n      In case of security breaches or problems,\
    \ many organisations\n      provide a designated point-of-contact which can alert\
    \ others and\n      take the appropriate actions.\n   PPP (Point to Point Protocol)\n\
    \      PPP is the mechanism which most end-users establish a network\n      connection\
    \ between their PC and their Internet service provider\n      with.  Once connected,\
    \ the PC is able to transmit and receive data\n      to any other system on the\
    \ network.\n   Privacy Programs\n      Another term for encryption software that\
    \ highlights the use of\n      this software to protect the confidentiality and\
    \ therefore privacy\n      of the end-users that make use of it.\n   Remote Access\
    \ Software\n      This software allows a computer to use a modem to connect to\n\
    \      another system.  It also allows a computer to 'listen' for calls\n    \
    \  on a modem (this computer provides 'remote access service'.)\n      Remote\
    \ access software may provide access to a single computer or\n      to a network.\n\
    \   Remote Log In\n      If an end-user uses a network to log in to a system,\
    \ this act is\n      known as remote log in.\n   Security Features\n      These\
    \ are features which provide protection or enable end-users\n      and administrators\
    \ to assess the security of a system, for\n      example, by auditing it.\n  \
    \ Security Policy\n      A security policy is written by organisations to address\
    \ security\n      issues, in the form of \"do's\" and \"don'ts\".  These guidelines\
    \ and\n      rules are for users with respect to physical security, data\n   \
    \   security, information security and content (eg. rules stating that\n     \
    \ sites with sexual content should not be visited, and that\n      copyrights\
    \ should be honoured when downloading software, etc).\n   Server\n      A server\
    \ is a computer system, or a set of processes on a computer\n      system providing\
    \ services to clients across a network.\n   Shared Account\n      A common account\
    \ is one which is shared by a group of users as\n      opposed to a normal account\
    \ which is available to only one user.\n      If the account is misused, it is\
    \ very difficult or impossible to\n      know which of users was responsible.\n\
    \   Sharing Permissions\n      Many computer systems allow users to share files\
    \ over a network.\n      These systems invariably provide a mechanism for users\
    \ to use to\n      control who has permission to read or overwrite these files.\n\
    \   Site\n      Depending on the context in which this term is used, it might\n\
    \      apply to computer systems that are grouped together by\n      geographical\
    \ location, organizational jurisdiction, or network\n      addresses.  A Site\
    \ typically refers to a network under a common\n      administration.\n   SSH\
    \ (Secure Shell)\n      SSH provides a protocol between a client and server, allowing\
    \ for\n      encrypted remote connectivity.\n   SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)\n \
    \     This protocol provides security services to otherwise insecure\n      protocols\
    \ which operate over a network.  SSL is typically used by\n      web browsers\
    \ to encrypt data sent to and downloaded from a server.\n   Systems Administrator\n\
    \      The individual who maintains the system and has system\n      administrator\
    \ privileges. In order to avoid errors and mistakes\n      done by this individual\
    \ while not acting as an administrator,\n      he/she should limit the time he/she\
    \ acts as an administrator (as\n      known to the system) to a minimum.\n   System\
    \ Administrator Privileges\n      System administrators have more rights (greater\
    \ permissions) as\n      their work involve the maintenance of system files.\n\
    \   System Files\n      The set of files on a system that do not belong to end-users,\n\
    \      which govern the functionality of the system.   System files have\n   \
    \   a great impact on the security of the system.\n   Telnet\n      A protocol\
    \ that enables remote log in to other computer systems\n      over the network.\n\
    \   Terminal\n      A dumb device that is connected to a computer system in order\
    \ to\n      provide (text-based) access to it for users and administrators.\n\
    \   Terms of Service (TOS)\n      See \"Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)\".\n   Threats\n\
    \      The potential that an existing vulnerability can be exploited to\n    \
    \  compromise the security of systems or networks. Even if a\n      vulnerability\
    \ is not known, it represents a threat by this\n      definition.\n   Trojan Horse\n\
    \      A program which carries within itself a means to allow the creator\n  \
    \    of the program access to the system using it.\n   Virus\n      A program\
    \ which replicates itself on computer systems by\n      incorporating itself (secretly\
    \ and maliciously) into other\n      programs.  A virus can be transferred onto\
    \ a computer system in a\n      variety of ways.\n   Virus-Detection Tool\n  \
    \    Software that detects and possibly removes computer viruses,\n      alerting\
    \ the user appropriately.\n   Vulnerability\n      A vulnerability is the existence\
    \ of a weakness, design, or\n      implementation error that can lead to an unexpected,\
    \ undesirable\n      event compromising the security of the system, network,\n\
    \      application, or protocol involved.\n   Web Browser Cache\n      This is\
    \ the part of the file system that is used to store web\n      pages and related\
    \ files.  It can be utilized to reload recently\n      accessed files from the\
    \ cache instead of loading it every time\n      from the network.\n   Web Browser\
    \ Capabilities\n      The set of functionalities on a web browser for use by the\
    \ end-\n      user.  This includes the set of plug-ins available.\n   Web Server\n\
    \      A server program that provides access to web pages.  Some web\n      servers\
    \ provide access to other services, such as databases, and\n      directories.\n\
    \   Worm\n      A computer program which replicates itself and is self-\n    \
    \  propogating.  Worms, as opposed to viruses, are meant to spawn in\n      network\
    \ environments.\n"
