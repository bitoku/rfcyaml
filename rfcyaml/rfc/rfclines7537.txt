Abstract RFCs 4379 and 6424 created name spaces for Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
However, those RFCs did not create the corresponding IANA registries for Downstream Mapping object Flags (DS Flags), Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and Interface and Label Stack Address Types.
There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these name spaces.
This document updates RFCs 4379 and 6424 in that it creates IANA registries for that purpose.
Introduction [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] created name spaces for MPLS LSP Ping.
However, those RFCs did not create the corresponding IANA registries for DS Flags, Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and Interface and Label Stack Address Types.
There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these name spaces.
In particular, [ENTROPY LSP PING] and [LSP PING LAG] request new DS Flags and Multipath Type allocations.
This document updates [RFC4379] and [RFC6424]
in that it creates IANA registries for that purpose.
Note that "DS Flags" and "Multipath Type" are fields included in two TLVs defined in the "Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Ping Parameters TLVs" registry: Downstream Mapping (DEPRECATED) (value 2) and Downstream Detailed Mapping (value 20).
Modification to either registry will affect both TLVs.
IANA Considerations Per this document, IANA has created new registries within the "Multi  Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Ping Parameters" [IANA MPLS LSP PING] registry to maintain DS Flags, Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and Interface and Label Stack Address Types fields.
The registry names and initial values are described in the immediate subsections that follow.
[RFC4379] defines the Downstream Mapping (DSMAP) TLV, which has Type 2 assigned from the "Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
Detailed Mapping (DDMAP) TLV, which has Type 20 assigned from the "Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
DSMAP has been deprecated by DDMAP, but both TLVs share a field: DS Flags.
IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "DS Flags".
The registration policy for this registry is Standards Action [RFC5226].
IANA has made the following initial assignments:
I: Interface and Label Stack
Multipath Types IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "Multipath Types".
The registration policies [RFC5226] for this registry are as follows: 0 250    Standards Action 251 254
Experimental Use 255    Standards Action IANA has made the following initial assignments:
10 250    Unassigned 251 254
Pad Type IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "Pad Types".
The registration policies [RFC5226] for this registry are: 0 250    Standards Action 251 254
Experimental Use 255    Standards Action IANA has made the following initial assignments:
This document 1    Drop Pad TLV from reply
3 250    Unassigned 251 254
Interface and Label Stack Address Type IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "Interface and Label Stack Address Types".
The registration policies [RFC5226] for this registry are: 0 250    Standards Action 251 254
Experimental Use 255    Standards Action IANA has made the following initial assignments:
Registry Name: Interface and Label Stack Address Types Value
This document simply creates IANA registries for code points defined in [RFC4379] and [RFC6424].
Thus, there are no new security concerns.
