- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an extensible\n\
    \   protocol with numerous elective features.  This document introduces a\n  \
    \ general mechanism for discovery of elective features and extensions\n   which\
    \ cannot be discovered using existing mechanisms.\n"
- title: 1.  Background and Intended Use
  contents:
  - "1.  Background and Intended Use\n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\
    \ (LDAP) [RFC3377] is an\n   extensible protocol with numerous elective features.\
    \  LDAP provides\n   mechanisms for a client to discover supported protocol versions,\n\
    \   controls, extended operations, Simple Authentication and Security\n   Layer\
    \ (SASL) mechanisms, and subschema information.  However, these\n   mechanisms\
    \ are not designed to support general feature discovery.\n   This document describes\
    \ a simple, general-purpose mechanism which\n   clients may use to discover the\
    \ set of elective features supported by\n   a server.  For example, this mechanism\
    \ could be used by a client to\n   discover whether or not the server supports\
    \ requests for all\n   operational attributes, e.g., \"+\" [RFC3673].  As another\
    \ example,\n   this mechanism could be used to discover absolute true, e.g., \"\
    (&)\"\n   and false, e.g., \"(|)\", search filters [T-F] support.\n   This document\
    \ extends the LDAP Protocol Mechanism registry [RFC3383]\n   to support registration\
    \ of values of the supportedFeatures attribute.\n   This registry is managed by\
    \ the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n   (IANA).\n   Schema definitions are\
    \ provided using LDAP description formats\n   [RFC2252].  Definitions provided\
    \ here are formatted (line wrapped)\n   for readability.\n   The key words \"\
    MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",\
    \ \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document\
    \ are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Discovery of supported features
  contents:
  - "2.  Discovery of supported features\n   Each elective feature whose support may\
    \ be discovered SHALL be\n   identified by an Object Identifier (OID).  A server\
    \ advertises its\n   support for a given feature by providing the OID associated\
    \ with the\n   feature as a value of the 'supportedFeatures' attribute held in\
    \ the\n   root DSE.  A client may examine the values of this attribute to\n  \
    \ determine if a particular feature is supported by the server.  A\n   client\
    \ MUST ignore values it doesn't recognize as they refer to\n   elective features\
    \ it doesn't implement.\n   Features associated with Standard Track protocol mechanisms\
    \ MUST be\n   registered.  Features associated with other protocol mechanisms\n\
    \   SHOULD be registered.  Procedures for registering protocol mechanisms\n  \
    \ are described in BCP 64 [RFC3383].  The word \"Feature\" should be\n   placed\
    \ in the usage field of the submitted LDAP Protocol Mechanism\n   template.\n\
    \   The 'supportedFeatures' attribute type is described as follows:\n      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.3.5\n\
    \        NAME 'supportedFeatures'\n        DESC 'features supported by the server'\n\
    \        EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch\n        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38\n\
    \        USAGE dSAOperation )\n   Servers MUST be capable of recognizing this\
    \ attribute type by the\n   name 'supportedFeatures'.  Servers MAY recognize the\
    \ attribute type\n   by other names.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   As rogue clients can discover features of a server\
    \ by other means\n   (such as by trial and error), this feature discovery mechanism\
    \ is not\n   believed to introduce any new security risk to LDAP.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Registration of Features as Protocol Mechanisms\n   Future specifications\
    \ detailing LDAP features are to register each\n   feature as a LDAP Protocol\
    \ Mechanism per guidance given in BCP 64\n   [RFC3383].  A usage of \"Feature\"\
    \ in a Protocol Mechanism registration\n   template indicates that the value to\
    \ be registered is associated with\n   an LDAP feature.\n"
