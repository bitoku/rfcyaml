  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace\
    \ that\n   contains Object Identifiers (OIDs).  It obsoletes RFC 3001.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   An Object Identifier is a tree of nodes where each node is\
    \ simply a\n   sequence of digits.  The rules roughly state that once an entity\
    \ is\n   assigned a node in the Object Identifier (OID) tree, it has sole\n  \
    \ discretion to further subdelegate sub-trees off of that node. Some\n   examples\
    \ of OIDs include:\n   o  1.3.6.1 - the Internet OID\n   o  1.3.6.1.4.1 - IANA-assigned\
    \ company OIDs, used for private MIBs\n      and such things\n   o  1.3.6.1.2.1.27\
    \ - The Applications MIB\n   o  0.9.2342.19200300.100.4 - Object ID's used in\
    \ the directory pilot\n      project to identify X.500 Object Classes.  Mostly\
    \ defined in RFC\n      1274.\n   This document specifies the \"oid\" URN namespace\
    \ [2].  This namespace\n   is for encoding an Object Identifier as specified in\
    \ ASN.1 [3] as a\n   URI.  RFC 3001 [1] is obsoleted by this specification.\n\
    \   The namespace specification is for a formal namespace.\n"
- title: 2. Specification Template
  contents:
  - "2. Specification Template\n   Namespace ID:\n      \"oid\" requested.\n   Registration\
    \ Information:\n       Registration Version Number: 1\n       Registration Date:\
    \ 2000-04-30\n   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n      The ISO/IEC Joint\
    \ Technical Committee 1 - SubCommittee 6\n         The real authority is the ASN.1\
    \ specification itself but SC6 is\n         the committee that has the authority\
    \ to interpret what that\n         means, thus that committee is listed as the\
    \ registrant.\n   Declaration of structure:\n      The NSS portion of the identifier\
    \ is based on the string encoding\n      rules found in RFC 1778 Section 2.15\
    \ [4] which specifies a series\n      of digits separated by a period with the\
    \ most significant digit\n      being at the left and the least significant being\
    \ at the right.\n      At no time shall the NSS portion of the URN contain the\
    \ human\n      readable description of a particular node in the OID tree.  The\n\
    \      NSS portion of the name is strictly limited to the digits 0-9 and\n   \
    \   the '.' character with no leading zeros. No other characters are\n      permitted.\
    \ This is all expressed in the following ABNF:\n           oid             = number\
    \ *( DOT number )\n           number          = DIGIT / ( LEADDIGIT 1*DIGIT )\n\
    \           LEADDIGIT       = %x31-39 ; 1-9\n           DIGIT           = %x30\
    \ / LEADDIGIT ; 0-9\n           DOT             = %x2E ; period\n      No changes\
    \ are anticipated since Object Identifiers are fairly\n      simple and have been\
    \ standardized with no changes for many years.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \      Relevant documentation can be found in X.660/Amd 2 | ISO/IEC\n      9834-1/Amd\
    \ 2[3].\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The rules for assignment\
    \ of OIDs requires that each OID be unique\n      to the OID space and that it\
    \ cannot be reassigned or reused.  By\n      reference this URN namespace inherents\
    \ those rules.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      The rules concerning\
    \ the use of OIDs requires that they not be\n      reused once assigned.  By reference\
    \ this URN namespace inherents\n      those rules.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n\
    \      Once an OID is assigned to some entity, that entity can then\n      create\
    \ and assign new OIDs below that particular OID.  There are\n      multiple entities\
    \ that assign new OIDs to the general public.  The\n      top three levels are\
    \ pre-assigned as follows:\n         0 - ITU-T assigned\n         1 - ISO assigned\n\
    \         2 - Joint ISO/ITU-T assignment\n      several assigned OIDs that are\
    \ of importance to the Internet are:\n         1.3.6.1 - the Internet OID\n  \
    \       1.3.6.1.4.1 - IANA-assigned company OIDs, used for private\n         MIBs\
    \ and such things\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      At this time no\
    \ resolution mechanism is defined.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      OIDs\
    \ are composed of multiple occurrences of digits and the \".\"\n      character.\
    \  Lexical equivalence is achieved by exact string match.\n   Conformance with\
    \ URN Syntax:\n      There are no additional characters reserved.\n   Validation\
    \ mechanism:\n      None.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"
