  - "Abstract\n   When multicast sources and receivers are active at Locator/ID\n\
    \   Separation Protocol (LISP) sites, the core network is required to use\n  \
    \ native multicast so packets can be delivered from sources to group\n   members.\
    \  When multicast is not available to connect the multicast\n   sites together,\
    \ a signal-free mechanism can be used to allow traffic\n   to flow between sites.\
    \  The mechanism described in this document uses\n   unicast replication and encapsulation\
    \ over the core network for the\n   data plane and uses the LISP mapping database\
    \ system so encapsulators\n   at the source LISP multicast site can find decapsulators\
    \ at the\n   receiver LISP multicast sites.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   When multicast sources and receivers are active at LISP\
    \ sites, and\n   the core network between the sites does not provide multicast\n\
    \   support, a signal-free mechanism can be used to create an overlay\n   that\
    \ will allow multicast traffic to flow between sites and connect\n   the multicast\
    \ trees at the different sites.\n   The signal-free mechanism proposed here does\
    \ not extend PIM [RFC7761]\n   over the overlay as proposed in [RFC6831], nor\
    \ does the mechanism\n   utilize direct signaling between the Receiver-ETRs and\
    \ Sender-ITRs as\n   described in [LISP-MULTI-SIGNALING].  The signal-free mechanism\n\
    \   proposed reduces the amount of signaling required between sites to a\n   minimum\
    \ and is centered around the registration of receiver sites for\n   a particular\
    \ multicast group or multicast channel with the LISP\n   mapping system.\n   Registrations\
    \ from the different receiver sites will be merged at the\n   mapping system to\
    \ assemble a multicast-replication-list inclusive of\n   all Routing Locators\
    \ (RLOCs) that lead to receivers for a particular\n   multicast group or multicast\
    \ channel.  The replication list for each\n   specific multicast entry is maintained\
    \ as a database mapping entry in\n   the LISP mapping system.\n   When the Ingress\
    \ Tunnel Router (ITR) at the source site receives\n   multicast traffic from sources\
    \ at its site, the ITR can query the\n   mapping system by issuing Map-Request\
    \ messages for the (S,G) source\n   and destination addresses in the packets received.\
    \  The mapping\n   system will return the RLOC replication list to the ITR, which\
    \ the\n   ITR will cache as per standard LISP procedure.  Since the core is\n\
    \   assumed to not support multicast, the ITR will replicate the\n   multicast\
    \ traffic for each RLOC on the replication list and will\n   unicast encapsulate\
    \ the traffic to each RLOC.  The combined function\n   or replicating and encapsulating\
    \ the traffic to the RLOCs in the\n   replication list is referred to as \"rep-encapsulation\"\
    \ in this\n   document.\n   The document describes general procedures (Section\
    \ 5) and information\n   encoding that are required at the receiver sites and\
    \ source sites to\n   achieve signal-free multicast interconnectivity.  The general\n\
    \   procedures for mapping system notifications to different sites are\n   also\
    \ described.  A section dedicated to the specific case of Source-\n   Specific\
    \ Multicast (SSM) trees discusses the implications to the\n   general procedures\
    \ for SSM multicast trees over different topological\n   scenarios.  A section\
    \ on Any-Source Multicast (ASM) support is\n   included to identify the constraints\
    \ that come along with supporting\n   it using LISP signal-free multicast.\n \
    \  There is a section dedicated to Replication Engineering, which is a\n   mechanism\
    \ to reduce the impact of head-end replication.  The mapping\n   system, via LISP\
    \ signal-free mechanisms, can be used to build a layer\n   of Re-encapsulating\
    \ Tunnel Routers (RTRs).\n"

  - "2.  Definition of Terms\n   LISP-related terms, notably Map-Request, Map-Reply,\
    \ Ingress Tunnel\n   Router (ITR), Egress Tunnel Router (ETR), Map-Server (MS),\
    \ and\n   Map-Resolver (MR) are defined in the LISP specification [RFC6830].\n\
    \   Extensions to the definitions in [RFC6830] for their application to\n   multicast\
    \ routing are documented in [RFC6831].\n   Terms defining interactions with the\
    \ LISP mapping system are defined\n   in [RFC6833].\n   The following terms are\
    \ consistent with the definitions in [RFC6830]\n   and [RFC6831].  The terms are\
    \ specific cases of the general terms and\n   are defined here to facilitate the\
    \ descriptions and discussions\n   within this particular document.\n   Source:\
    \ Multicast source endpoint.  The host that originates\n   multicast packets.\n\
    \   Receiver: Multicast group member endpoint.  The host joins a\n   multicast\
    \ group as a receiver of multicast packets sent to the group.\n   Receiver site:\
    \ LISP site where multicast receivers are located.\n   Source site: LISP site\
    \ where multicast sources are located.\n   RP site: LISP site where an ASM PIM\
    \ Rendezvous Point (RP) [RFC7761]\n   is located.  The RP site and the source\
    \ site MAY be the same in some\n   situations.\n   Receiver-ETR: LISP decapsulating\
    \ the Tunnel Router (xTR) at the\n   receiver site.  This is a multicast ETR.\n\
    \   Source-ITR: LISP encapsulating xTR at the source site.  This is a\n   multicast\
    \ ITR.\n   RP-xTR: LISP xTR at the RP site.  This is typically a multicast ITR.\n\
    \   Replication list: Mapping-entry containing the list of RLOCs that\n   have\
    \ registered receivers for a particular multicast entry.\n   Multicast entry:\
    \ A tuple identifying a multicast tree.  Multicast\n   entries are in the form\
    \ of (S-prefix, G-prefix).\n   Rep-encapsulation: The process of replicating and\
    \ then encapsulating\n   traffic to multiple RLOCs.\n   Re-encapsulating Tunnel\
    \ Router (RTR): An RTR is a router that\n   implements the re-encapsulating tunnel\
    \ function detailed in Section 8\n   of the main LISP specification [RFC6830].\
    \  A LISP RTR performs packet\n   re-routing by chaining ETR and ITR functions,\
    \ whereby it first\n   removes the LISP header of an ingress packet and then prepends\
    \ a new\n   LISP header to an egress packet.\n   RTR Level: An RTR level is encoded\
    \ in a Replication List Entry (RLE)\n   LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) Type\
    \ detailed in [RFC8060].\n   Each entry in the replication list contains an address\
    \ of an xTR and\n   a level value.  Level values are used to create a replication\n\
    \   hierarchy so that ITRs at source LISP sites replicate to the lowest\n   (smaller\
    \ value) level number RTRs in an RLE.  And then RTRs at a\n   given level replicate\
    \ to the next higher level of RTRs.  The number\n   of RTRs at each level are\
    \ engineered to control the fan-out or\n   replication factor, so a trade-off\
    \ between the width of the level\n   versus the number of levels can be selected.\n\
    \   ASM: Any-Source Multicast as defined in [RFC3569] where multicast\n   distribution\
    \ trees are built with a Rendezvous Point [RFC7761].\n   SSM: Source-Specific\
    \ Multicast as defined in [RFC3569] where\n   multicast distribution trees are\
    \ built and rooted at the multicast\n   router(s) directly connected to the multicast\
    \ source.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  General Procedures\n   The interconnection of multicast trees across different\
    \ LISP sites\n   involves the following procedures to build the necessary multicast\n\
    \   distribution trees across sites.\n   1.  The presence of multicast receiver\
    \ endpoints is detected by the\n       Receiver-ETRs at the receiver sites.\n\
    \   2.  Receiver-ETRs register their RLOCs as part of the replication\n      \
    \ list for the multicast entry the detected receivers subscribe to.\n   3.  The\
    \ mapping system merges all Receiver-ETR or delivery-group\n       RLOCs to build\
    \ a comprehensive replication list inclusive of all\n       receiver sites for\
    \ each multicast entry.\n   4.  LISP Map-Notify messages MUST be sent to the Source-ITR\
    \ informing\n       of any changes in the replication list.\n   5.  Multicast\
    \ tree building at the source site is initiated when the\n       Source-ITR receives\
    \ the LISP notification.\n   Once the multicast distribution trees are built,\
    \ the following\n   forwarding procedures may take place:\n   1.  The source sends\
    \ multicast packets to the multicast group\n       destination address.\n   2.\
    \  Multicast traffic follows the multicast tree built at the source\n       site\
    \ and makes its way to the Source-ITRs.\n   3.  The Source-ITR will issue a Map-Request\
    \ to resolve the\n       replication list for the multicast entry.\n   4.  The\
    \ mapping system responds to the Source-ITR with a Map-Reply\n       containing\
    \ the replication list for the multicast group\n       requested.\n   5.  The\
    \ Source-ITR caches the replication list received in the\n       map-reply for\
    \ the multicast entry.\n   6.  Multicast traffic is rep-encapsulated.  That is,\

  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Multicast Receiver Detection\n   When the Receiver-ETRs are directly\
    \ connected to the receivers (e.g.,\n   Receiver-site-4 in Figure 1), the Receiver-ETRs\

  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Receiver-Site Registration\n   Once the Receiver-ETRs detect the presence\
    \ of receivers at the\n   receiver site, the Receiver-ETRs MUST issue Map-Register\
    \ messages to\n   include the Receiver-ETR RLOCs in the replication list for the\n\
    \   multicast entry the receivers joined.\n   The Map-Register message MUST use\
    \ the multicast entry (Source, Group)\n   tuple as its Endpoint ID (EID) record\
    \ type with the Receiver-ETR\n   RLOCs conforming the locator set.\n   The EID\
    \ in the Map-Register message MUST be encoded using the\n   Multicast Info LCAF\
    \ Type defined in [RFC8060].\n   The RLOC in the Map-Register message MUST be\
    \ encoded using the RLE\n   LCAF Type defined in [RFC8060] with the Level Value\
    \ fields for all\n   entries set to 128 (decimal).\n   The encoding described\
    \ above MUST be used consistently for Map-\n   Register messages, entries in the\
    \ mapping system, Map-Reply messages,\n   as well as the map-cache at the Source-ITRs.\n\
    \   The Map-Register messages [RFC6830] sent by the Receiver-ETRs MUST\n   have\
    \ the following bits set as specified here:\n   1.  merge-request bit set to 1.\
    \  The Map-Register messages are sent\n       with \"Merge Semantics\".  The Map-Server\
    \ will receive\n       registrations from a multitude of Receiver-ETRs.  The Map-Server\n\
    \       will merge the registrations for common EIDs and maintain a\n       consolidated\
    \ replication list for each multicast entry.\n   2.  want-map-notify bit (M) set\
    \ to 0.  This tells the mapping system\n       that the Receiver-ETR does not\
    \ expect to receive Map-Notify\n       messages as it does not need to be notified\
    \ of all changes to the\n       replication list.\n   3.  proxy-reply bit (P)\
    \ set to 1.  The merged replication list is\n       kept in the Map-Servers. \
    \ By setting the proxy-reply bit, the\n       Receiver-ETRs instruct the mapping\
    \ system to proxy reply to Map-\n       Requests issued for the multicast entries.\n\
    \   Map-Register messages for a particular multicast entry MAY be sent\n   for\
    \ every receiver detected, even if previous receivers have been\n   detected for\
    \ the particular multicast entry.  This allows the\n   replication list to remain\
    \ up to date.\n   Receiver-ETRs MUST be configured to know what Map-Servers Map-\n\
    \   Register messages are sent to.  The configuration is likely to be\n   associated\
    \ with an S-prefix that multiple (S,G) entries match to and\n   are more specific\
    \ for.  Therefore, the S-prefix determines the Map-\n   Server set in the least\

    \ can be done by having multiple RLOCs\n   assigned to an ETR and having the ETR\
    \ send Map-Registers for all its\n   RLOCs.  By doing this, an ITR can choose\
    \ a specific path based on\n   underlay performance and/or RLOC reachability.\n\
    \   It is recommended that an ETR send a Map-Register with a single RLOC-\n  \
    \ record that uses the Explicit Locator Path (ELP) LCAF Type [RFC8060]\n   that\
    \ is nested inside the RLE LCAF.  For example, say ETR1 has\n   assigned RLOC1\
    \ and RLOC2 for a LISP receiver site.  Also, there is\n   ETR2 in another LISP\
    \ receiver site that has RLOC3.  The two receiver\n   sites have the same (S,G)\
    \ being joined.  Here is how the RLOC-record\n   is encoded on each ETR:\n   ETR1:\
    \ EID-record: (S,G)\n         RLOC-record: RLE[ ELP{ (RLOC1,s,p), (RLOC2,s,p)\
    \ } ]\n   ETR2: EID-record: (S,G)\n         RLOC-record: RLE[ RLOC3 ]\n   And\

    \ or (RLOC3 and RLOC2).\n   Since it is required for the s-bit to be set for RLOC1,\
    \ the ITR MUST\n   replicate to RLOC1 if it is reachable.  When the required p-bit\
    \ is\n   also set, the RLOC-reachability mechanisms from [RFC6830] are\n   followed.\

    \   configured in each LISP site so PIM Register procedures and (*,G)\n   state\
    \ maintenance is contained within the LISP site.\n   The following procedure will\
    \ be used to support ASM in each LISP\n   site:\n   1.  In a receiver site, the\
    \ RP is co-located with the ETR.  RPs for\n       different groups can be spread\

    \ design.  Rather than have the\n   layered LISP-RE RTR hierarchy use signaling\
    \ mechanisms, the RTRs can\n   register their availability for multicast tree\
    \ replication via the\n   mapping database system.\n   As stated in [LISP-RE],\
    \ the RTR-layered hierarchy is used to avoid\n   head-end replication in replicating\
    \ nodes closest to a multicast\n   source.  Rather than have multicast ITRs replicate\
    \ to each ETR in an\n   RLE of an (S,G) mapping database entry, it could replicate\
    \ to one or\n   more layer 0 RTRs in the LISP-RE hierarchy.\n   This document\
    \ specifies how the RTR hierarchy is determined but not\n   the optimal layers\
    \ of RTRs to be used.  Methods for determining\n   optimal paths or RTR topological\
    \ closeness are out of scope for this\n   document.\n   There are two formats\
    \ an (S,G) mapping database entry could have.\n   One format is a 'complete-format',\
    \ and the other is a 'filtered-\n   format'.  A 'complete-format' entails an (S,G)\
    \ entry having multiple\n   RLOC-records that contain both ETRs that have registered\
    \ as well as\n   the RTRs at the first level of the LISP-RE hierarchy for the\
    \ ITR to\n   replicate to.  When using 'complete-format', the ITR has the ability\n\
    \   to select if it replicates to RTRs or to the registered ETRs at the\n   receiver\
    \ sites.  A 'filtered-format' (S,G) entry is one where the\n   Map-Server returns\
    \ the RLOC-records that it decides the ITR SHOULD\n   use.  So replication policy\
    \ is shifted from the ITRs to the mapping\n   system.  The Map-Servers can also\
    \ decide for a given ITR if it uses a\n   different set of replication targets\
    \ per (S,G) entry for which the\n   ITR is replicating for.\n   The procedure\
    \ for the LISP-RE RTRs to make themselves available for\n   replication can occur\
    \ before or after any receivers join an (S,G)\n   entry or any sources send for\
    \ a particular (S,G) entry.  Therefore,\n   newly configured RTR state will be\
    \ used to create new (S,G) state and\n   will be inherited into existing (S,G)\
    \ state.  A set of RTRs can\n   register themselves to the mapping system or a\
    \ third party can do so\n   on their behalf.  When RTR registration occurs, it\
    \ is done with an\n   (S-prefix, G-prefix) entry so it can advertise its replication\n\
    \   services for a wide range of source/group combinations.\n   When a Map-Server\
    \ receives (S,G) registrations from ETRs and\n   (S-prefix, G-prefix) registrations\
    \ from RTRs, it has the option of\n   merging the RTR RLOC-records for each (S,G)\
    \ that is more specific for\n   the (S-prefix, G-prefix) entry or keeping them\
    \ separate.  When\n   merging, a Map-Server is ready to return a 'complete-format'\
    \ Map-\n   Reply.  When keeping the entries separate, the Map-Server can decide\n\
    \   what to include in a Map-Reply when a Map-Request is received.  It\n   can\
    \ include a combination of RLOC-records from each entry or decide\n   to use one\
    \ or the other depending on policy configured.\n                       +---+ \

    \   EID-record: (S,G)\n              RLOC-record: RLE: (RTR1(L0), RTR3(L1)), p1\n\
    \   An (S,G) entry can contain alternate RTRs.  So rather than\n   replicating\
    \ to multiple RTRs, one RTR set MAY be used based on the\n   RTR reachability\
    \ status.  An ITR can test reachability status to any\n   layer 0 RTR using RLOC-probing,\
    \ so it can choose one RTR from a set\n   to replicate to.  When this is done,\
    \ the RTRs are encoded in\n   different RLOC-records instead of together in one\
    \ RLE RLOC-record.\n   This moves the replication load off the ITRs at the source\
    \ site to\n   the RTRs inside the network infrastructure.  This mechanism can\
    \ also\n   be used by level-n RTRs to level-n+1 RTRs.\n   The following mapping\
    \ would be encoded in a Map-Reply sent by a Map-\n   Server and stored in the\
    \ ITR.  The ITR would use RTR1 until it went\n   unreachable and then switch to\
    \ use RTR2:\n          EID-record: (S,G)\n              RLOC-record: RTR1, p1\n\
    \              RLOC-record: RTR2, p2\n"

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   [LISP-SEC] defines a set of security mechanisms\
    \ that provide origin\n   authentication, integrity, and anti-replay protection\
    \ to LISP's EID-\n   to-RLOC mapping data conveyed via the mapping lookup process.\
    \  LISP-\n   SEC also enables verification of authorization on EID-prefix claims\n\
    \   in Map-Reply messages.\n   Additional security mechanisms to protect the LISP\
    \ Map-Register\n   messages are defined in [RFC6833].\n   The security of the\
    \ mapping system infrastructure depends on the\n   particular mapping database\
    \ used.  As an example, [RFC8111] defines a\n   public-key-based mechanism that\
    \ provides origin authentication and\n   integrity protection to the LISP DDT\
    \ protocol.\n   Map-Replies received by the Source-ITR can be signed (by the Map-\n\
    \   Server), so the ITR knows the replication list is from a legitimate\n   source.\n\
    \   Data-plane encryption can be used when doing unicast rep-\n   encapsulation\
    \ as described in [RFC8061].\n"
