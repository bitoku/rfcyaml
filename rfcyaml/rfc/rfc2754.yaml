  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RPS Security [2] requires certain RPSL [1] objects in the IRR to\
    \ be\n   hierarchically delegated.  The set of objects that are at the root of\n\
    \   this hierarchy needs to be created and digitally signed by IANA. This\n  \
    \ paper presents these seed objects and lists operations required from\n   IANA.\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n"
