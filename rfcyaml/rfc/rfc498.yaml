  - "                         ON MAIL SERVICE TO CCN\n    Most of the recent documents\
    \ on mail protocols have discussed the\nfacilities desired at \"post-office\"\
    \ hosts, i.e. those which provide\nstore-and-forward services. CCN has no plans\
    \ to provide post-office\nservices; we expect to receive mail only for the staff\
    \ of CCN.  Our\ngreatest concern is to get messages reliably to and from our\n\
    administrative and user support people who don't habitually use on-line\nterminals,\
    \ so we are printing out all mail and distributing it by\ncourier/secretary.\n\
    \    Let me say a friendly word for SNDMSG.  This Tenex command, which\nuses the\
    \ FTP MAIL command to deliver messages, is very simple but\nextremely useful--probably\
    \ because it is so simple.  Furthermore, it is\none of the well-kept secrets of\
    \ the Network that SNDMSG can be used to\nsend messages to any host which supports\
    \ the MAIL command (without\nrequiring logon to FTP).  Thus, to send a message\
    \ to anyone at CCN, the\nrecommended procedure is to do SNDMSG to \"name@CCN\"\
    .  This connects to\nCCN's FTP and sends a \"MAIL name\" command followed by the\
    \ message.  We\nnow accept any \"name\" and print an immediate upper-case copy\
    \ which is\ndistributed to the recipient's office.  So, if you SNDMSG to\n\"BRADEN@CCN\"\
    , your message will end up on my desk, usually within a few\nhours.  Other useful\
    \ SNDMSG destination at CCN are:\n           WBK@CCN or KEHL@CCN      (the Director)\n\
    \           RIB@CCN or BELL@CCN      (Supervisor Of User Relations)\n        \
    \   BBN@CCN or NOBLE@CCN     (Barbara Noble, User Consultant)\nThis fine service\
    \ is brought to you by your friendly neighborhood Tenex.\n    On the other hand,\
    \ the Tenex READMAIL command is a little too\nsimple.  After giving you a message,\
    \ it should ask you whether you want\nto delete, keep, forward, and/or repeat\
    \ the message.\n    Dave Crocker of NMC has suggested an extension to the MAIL\
    \ and MLFL\n(Mail File) commands in CCN's FTP to allow CCN to serve as a mail\n\
    delivery station for NMC as well as CCN.  This extension is intended to\nbe a\
    \ trivial subset of the full-blown mail protocol which is currently\nbeing developed\
    \ by Jim White et al.  It is a simple means to allow CCN's\nhigh-speed printers\
    \ to be used conveniently for receiving and\ndisseminating Network documentation\
    \ as well as messages.  It is based\nupon extensions of the pathname/user name\
    \ fields in the MLFL/MAIL\ncommands, respectively.  The proposed syntax is as\
    \ follows:\n                           __                   __\n             \
    \             |                       |\n                          | ;D[DOCUMENT]\
    \          |\n                          | ;M[MESSAGE]           |\n          \
    \     <userid>   | ;C[COPIES]= <integer> |\n                          | ;BIN=\
    \ <integer>       |\n                          |__                   __|\nThe\
    \ semantics would be:\n    (1) <userid>  will normally be a valid TSO userid;\
    \ this will be used\n                  to determine a charge number to account\
    \ for the\n                  printing. If <userid> is _not_ recognized, the rest\
    \ of\n                  the parameters will be ignored, but the mail will\n  \
    \                still be accepted. The result will be to print one\n        \
    \          copy immediately in upper case and send it to Bin\n               \
    \   9906, charging it to an overhead account.\n    (2) MESSAGE   means print a\
    \ copy immediately using the normal\n                  upper-case-only train.\
    \ This is the default.\n    (3) DOCUMENT  means enqueue the text for overnight\
    \ printing with an\n                  upper/lower case print train.  A message\
    \ indicating\n                  receipt (and perhaps the first block) will also\
    \ be\n                  printed immediately in upper case and distributed.\n \
    \   (4) COPIES    makes multiple copies. [This facility will not be\n        \
    \          available immediately].\n    (5) BIN       specifies CCN bin to receive\
    \ output. Default will be\n                  9906 (ARPA mail bin).\n    Each incoming\
    \ message will be time-and-date-stamped.  The time/date\nwill appear on the first\
    \ page of the message (on a separate page in the\ncase of upper/lowercase), in\
    \ the 256 acknowledgment message from FTP,\nand on our system log file.  This\
    \ time/date stamp may be useful for\nusers to keep tabs on their documents, and\
    \ to allow us to track down\nmissing messages. The semicolon and equal sign delimiters\
    \ of this syntax\nare acceptable in the \"user\" parameter to SNDMSG.\n    This\
    \ extended MAIL syntax will be implemented by June 1.\nRTB/gjm\n       [ This\
