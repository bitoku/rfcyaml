- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is a revision of and supercedes BCP 10.  It\
    \ is in\n   essence a republishing of [RFC3777] and the other RFCs that updated\n\
    \   that document into a single specification.  The result is a complete\n   specification\
    \ of the process by which members of the IAB and IESG,\n   and some members of\
    \ the IAOC, are selected, confirmed, and recalled\n   as of the date of its approval.\n\
    \   Section 4 of [RFC4071] provides further details about the IAOC\n   positions\
    \ that are filled by the nominating committee.\n   The following two assumptions\
    \ continue to be true of this\n   specification:\n   1.  The Internet Research\
    \ Task Force (IRTF) and Internet Research\n       Steering Group (IRSG) are not\
    \ a part of the process described\n       here.\n   2.  The organization (and\
    \ reorganization) of the IESG is not a part\n       of the process described here.\n\
    \   The time frames specified here use IETF meetings as a frame of\n   reference.\
    \  The time frames assume that the IETF meets three times\n   per calendar year\
    \ with approximately equal amounts of time between\n   them.  The meetings are\
    \ referred to as the First IETF, Second IETF,\n   or Third IETF as needed.\n \
    \  The next section lists the words and phrases commonly used throughout\n   this\
    \ document with their intended meaning.\n   The majority of this document is divided\
    \ into four major topics as\n   follows:\n   General:  This is a set of rules\
    \ and constraints that apply to the\n      selection and confirmation process\
    \ as a whole.\n   Nominating Committee Selection:  This is the process by which\
    \ the\n      volunteers who will serve on the committee are selected.\n   Nominating\
    \ Committee Operation:  This is the set of principles,\n      rules, and constraints\
    \ that guide the activities of the nominating\n      committee, including the\
    \ confirmation process.\n   Member Recall:  This is the process by which the behavior\
    \ of a\n      sitting member of the IAOC, IESG, or IAB may be questioned,\n  \
    \    perhaps resulting in the removal of the sitting member.\n   A final section\
    \ describes how this document differs from its\n   predecessor [RFC3777].\n  \
    \ An appendix of useful facts and practices collected from previous\n   nominating\
    \ committees is also included.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   The following words and phrases are commonly used throughout\
    \ this\n   document.  They are listed here with their intended meaning for the\n\
    \   convenience of the reader.\n   candidate:  A nominee who has been selected\
    \ to be considered for\n      confirmation by a confirming body.\n   confirmed\
    \ candidate:  A candidate that has been reviewed and approved\n      by a confirming\
    \ body.\n   nominating committee term:  The term begins when its members are\n\
    \      officially announced, which is expected to be prior to the Third\n    \
    \  IETF to ensure it is fully operational at the Third IETF.  The\n      term\
    \ ends at the Third IETF (not three meetings) after the next\n      nominating\
    \ committee's term begins.\n   IETF Executive Director:  The person charged with\
    \ operation of the\n      IETF Secretariat function.  (See Section 2 of [RFC3710]).\n\
    \   nominee:  A person who is being or has been considered for one or\n      more\
    \ open positions of the IESG, IAB, or IAOC.\n   sitting member:  A person who\
    \ is currently serving a term of\n      membership in the IESG, IAB, or ISOC Board\
    \ of Trustees.\n"
- title: 3.  General
  contents:
  - "3.  General\n   The following set of rules apply to the process as a whole. \
    \ If\n   necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is\n\
    \   included.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Completion Due
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Completion Due\n   The completion of the annual process is due within seven\
    \ months.\n   The completion of the annual process is due one month prior to the\n\
    \   Friday of the week before the First IETF.  It is expected to begin at\n  \
    \ least eight months prior to the Friday of the week before the First\n   IETF.\n\
    \   The process officially begins with the announcement of the Chair of\n   the\
    \ committee.  The process officially ends when all confirmed\n   candidates have\
    \ been announced.\n   The annual process is comprised of three major components\
    \ as follows:\n   1.  The selection and organization of the nominating committee\n\
    \       members.\n   2.  The selection of candidates by the nominating committee.\n\
    \   3.  The confirmation of the candidates.\n   There is an additional month set\
    \ aside between when the annual\n   process is expected to end and the term of\
    \ the new candidates is to\n   begin.  This time may be used during unusual circumstances\
    \ to extend\n   the time allocated for any of the components listed above.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Nominating Committee Principal Functions
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Nominating Committee Principal Functions\n   The principal functions of\
    \ the nominating committee are to review\n   each open IESG, IAB, and IAOC position\
    \ and to nominate either its\n   incumbent or a superior candidate.\n   Although\
    \ there is no term limit for serving in any IESG, IAB, or IAOC\n   position, the\
    \ nominating committee may use length of service as one\n   of its criteria for\
    \ evaluating an incumbent.\n   The nominating committee does not select the open\
    \ positions to be\n   reviewed; it is instructed as to which positions to review.\n\
    \   The nominating committee will be given the titles of the positions to\n  \
    \ be reviewed and a brief summary of the desired expertise of the\n   candidate\
    \ that is nominated to fill each position.\n   Incumbents must notify the nominating\
    \ committee if they wish to be\n   nominated.\n   The nominating committee does\
    \ not confirm its candidates; it presents\n   its candidates to the appropriate\
    \ confirming body as indicated below.\n   A superior candidate is one who the\
    \ nominating committee believes\n   would contribute in such a way as to improve\
    \ or enhance the body to\n   which he or she is nominated.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Positions To Be Reviewed
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Positions To Be Reviewed\n   Approximately one-half of each of the then\
    \ current IESG and IAB\n   positions, and one IAOC position, is selected to be\
    \ reviewed each\n   year.\n   The intent of this rule is to ensure the review\
    \ of approximately one-\n   half of each of the IESG and IAB sitting members,\
    \ and one of the two\n   nominated IAOC positions, each year.  It is recognized\
    \ that\n   circumstances may exist that will require the nominating committee\
    \ to\n   review more or less than the usual number of positions, e.g., if the\n\
    \   IESG, IAB, or IAOC have reorganized prior to this process and created\n  \
    \ new positions, if there are an odd number of current positions, or if\n   a\
    \ member unexpectedly resigns.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Term Lengths
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Term Lengths\n   Confirmed candidates are expected to serve at least a\
    \ two-year term.\n   The intent of this rule is to ensure that members of the\
    \ IESG, IAB,\n   and IAOC serve the number of years that best facilitates the\
    \ review\n   of one-half of the members each year.\n   The term of a confirmed\
    \ candidate selected according to the mid-term\n   vacancy rules may be less than\
    \ two years, as stated elsewhere in this\n   document.\n   It is consistent with\
    \ this rule for the nominating committee to\n   choose one or more of the currently\
    \ open positions to which it may\n   assign a term of not more than three years\
    \ in order to ensure the\n   ideal application of this rule in the future.\n \
    \  It is consistent with this rule for the nominating committee to\n   choose\
    \ one or more of the currently open positions that share\n   responsibilities\
    \ with other positions (both those being reviewed and\n   those sitting) to which\
    \ it may assign a term of not more than three\n   years to ensure that all such\
    \ members will not be reviewed at the\n   same time.\n   All sitting member terms\
    \ end during the First IETF meeting\n   corresponding to the end of the term for\
    \ which they were confirmed.\n   All confirmed candidate terms begin during the\
    \ First IETF meeting\n   corresponding to the beginning of the term for which\
    \ they were\n   confirmed.\n   For confirmed candidates of the IESG, the terms\
    \ begin no later than\n   when the currently sitting members' terms end on the\
    \ last day of the\n   meeting.  A term may begin or end no sooner than the first\
    \ day of the\n   meeting and no later than the last day of the meeting as determined\n\
    \   by the mutual agreement of the currently sitting member and the\n   confirmed\
    \ candidate.  A confirmed candidate's term may overlap the\n   sitting member's\
    \ term during the meeting as determined by their\n   mutual agreement.\n   For\
    \ confirmed candidates of the IAB and IAOC, the terms overlap with\n   the terms\
    \ of the sitting members for the entire week of the meeting.\n   For candidates\
    \ confirmed under the mid-term vacancy rules, the term\n   begins as soon as possible\
    \ after the confirmation.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Mid-term Vacancies
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Mid-term Vacancies\n   Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules\
    \ as documented here\n   with four qualifications, namely:\n   1.  When there\
    \ is only one official nominating committee, the body\n       with the mid-term\
    \ vacancy relegates the responsibility to fill\n       the vacancy to it.  If\
    \ the mid-term vacancy occurs during the\n       period of time that the term\
    \ of the prior year's nominating\n       committee overlaps with the term of the\
    \ current year's nominating\n       committee, the body with the mid-term vacancy\
    \ must relegate the\n       responsibility to fill the vacancy to the prior year's\
    \ nominating\n       committee.\n   2.  If it is the case that the nominating\
    \ committee is reconvening to\n       fill the mid-term vacancy, then the completion\
    \ of the candidate\n       selection and confirmation process is due within six\
    \ weeks, with\n       all other time periods otherwise unspecified prorated\n\
    \       accordingly.\n   3.  The confirming body has two weeks from the day it\
    \ is notified of\n       a candidate to reject the candidate, otherwise the candidate\
    \ is\n       assumed to have been confirmed.\n   4.  The term of the confirmed\
    \ candidate will be either:\n       A.  the remainder of the term of the open\
    \ position if that\n           remainder is not less than one year or\n      \
    \ B.  the remainder of the term of the open position plus the next\n         \
    \  two-year term if that remainder is less than one year.\n   In both cases, a\
    \ year is the period of time from a First IETF meeting\n   to the next First IETF\
    \ meeting.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Confidentiality\n   All deliberations and supporting information that relates\
    \ to specific\n   nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are confidential.\n\
    \   The nominating committee and confirming body members will be exposed\n   to\
    \ confidential information as a result of their deliberations, their\n   interactions\
    \ with those they consult, and from those who provide\n   requested supporting\
    \ information.  All members and all other\n   participants are expected to handle\
    \ this information in a manner\n   consistent with its sensitivity.\n   It is\
    \ consistent with this rule for current nominating committee\n   members who have\
    \ served on prior nominating committees to advise the\n   current committee on\
    \ deliberations and results of the prior\n   committee, as necessary and appropriate.\n\
    \   The list of nominees willing to be considered for positions under\n   review\
    \ in the current nominating committee cycle is not confidential.\n   The nominating\
    \ committee may disclose a list of names of nominees who\n   are willing to be\
    \ considered for positions under review to the\n   community, in order to obtain\
    \ feedback from the community on these\n   nominees.\n   The list of nominees\
    \ disclosed for a specific position should contain\n   only the names of nominees\
    \ who are willing to be considered for the\n   position under review.\n   The\
    \ nominating committee may choose not to include some names in the\n   disclosed\
    \ list, at their discretion.\n   The nominating committee may disclose an updated\
    \ list, at its\n   discretion.  For example, the nominating committee might disclose\
    \ an\n   updated list if it identifies errors/omissions in a previously\n   disclosed\
    \ version of the disclosed list, or if the nominating\n   committee finds it necessary\
    \ to call for additional nominees, and\n   these nominees indicate a willingness\
    \ to be considered before the\n   nominating committee has completed its deliberations.\n\
    \   Nominees may choose to ask people to provide feedback to the\n   nominating\
    \ committee but should not encourage any public statements\n   of support.  Nominating\
    \ committees should consider nominee-encouraged\n   lobbying and campaigning to\
    \ be unacceptable behavior.\n   IETF community members are encouraged to provide\
    \ feedback on nominees\n   to the nominating committee but should not post statements\
    \ of\n   support/non-support for nominees in any public forum.\n"

    \ who are\n   currently sitting members of the IESG, IAB, or IAOC and who are\
    \ not\n   sitting in an open position being filled by the nominating committee.\n\
    \   The confirmation of a candidate to an open position does not\n   automatically\
    \ create a vacancy in the IESG, IAB, or IAOC position\n   currently occupied by\
    \ the candidate.  The mid-term vacancy can not\n   exist until, first, the candidate\
    \ formally resigns from the current\n   position and, second, the body with the\
    \ vacancy formally decides for\n   itself that it wants the nominating committee\
    \ to fill the mid-term\n   vacancy according to the rules for a mid-term vacancy\
    \ documented\n   elsewhere in this document.\n   The resignation should be effective\
    \ as of when the term of the new\n   position begins.  The resignation may remain\
    \ confidential to the IAB,\n   IAOC, IESG, and nominating committee until the\
    \ confirmed candidate is\n   announced for the new position.  The process, according\
    \ to rules set\n   out elsewhere in this document, of filling the seat vacated\
    \ by the\n   confirmed candidate may begin as soon as the vacancy is publicly\n\
    \   announced.\n   Filling a mid-term vacancy is a separate and independent action\
    \ from\n   the customary action of filling open positions.  In particular, a\n\
    \   nominating committee must complete its job with respect to filling\n   the\
    \ open positions and then separately proceed with the task of\n   filling the\
    \ mid-term vacancy according to the rules for a mid-term\n   vacancy documented\
    \ elsewhere in this document.\n   However, the following exception is permitted\
    \ in the case where the\n   candidate for an open position is currently a sitting\
    \ member of the\n   IAB.  It is consistent with these rules for the announcements\
    \ of a\n   resignation of a sitting member of the IAB and of the confirmed\n \
    \  candidate for the mid-term vacancy created by that sitting member on\n   the\
    \ IAB to all occur at the same time as long as the actual sequence\n   of events\
    \ that occurred did so in the following order:\n   1.  The nominating committee\
    \ completes the advice and consent process\n       for the open position being\
    \ filled by the candidate currently\n       sitting on the IAB.\n   2.  The newly\
    \ confirmed candidate resigns from their current position\n       on the IAB.\n\
    \   3.  The IAB with the new mid-term vacancy requests that the\n       nominating\
    \ committee fill the position.\n   4.  The Executive Director of the IETF informs\
    \ the nominating\n       committee of the mid-term vacancy.\n   5.  The nominating\

    \ The completion of the selection and organization process is due at\n   least\
    \ one month prior to the Third IETF.  This ensures the nominating\n   committee\
    \ is fully operational and available for interviews and\n   consultation during\
    \ the Third IETF.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Term
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Term\n   The term of a nominating committee is expected to be 15 months.\n\
    \   It is the intent of this rule that the end of a nominating\n   committee's\
    \ term overlap by approximately three months the beginning\n   of the term of\
    \ the next nominating committee.\n   The term of a nominating committee begins\
    \ when its members are\n   officially announced.  The term ends at the Third IETF\
    \ (not three\n   meetings), i.e., the IETF meeting after the next nominating\n\
    \   committee's term begins.\n   A term is expected to begin at least two months\
    \ prior to the Third\n   IETF to ensure the nominating committee has at least\
    \ one month to get\n   organized before preparing for the Third IETF.\n   A nominating\
    \ committee is expected to complete any work in progress\n   before it is dissolved\
    \ at the end of its term.\n   During the period of time when the terms of the\
    \ nominating committees\n   overlap, all mid-term vacancies are to be relegated\
    \ to the prior\n   year's nominating committee.  The prior year's nominating committee\n\
    \   has no other responsibilities during the overlap period.  At all\n   times\
    \ other than the overlap period, there is exactly one official\n   nominating\
    \ committee and it is responsible for all mid-term\n   vacancies.\n   When the\
    \ prior year's nominating committee is filling a mid-term\n   vacancy during the\
    \ period of time that the terms overlap, the\n   nominating committees operate\
    \ independently.  However, some\n   coordination is needed between them.  Since\
    \ the prior year's Chair is\n   a non-voting advisor to the current nominating\
    \ committee, the\n   coordination is expected to be straightforward.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.7.  Voting Member Recall\n   Any member of the nominating committee may propose\
    \ to the committee\n   that any other member except the Chair be recalled.  The\
    \ process for\n   recalling the Chair is defined elsewhere in this document.\n\
    \   There are a variety of ordinary circumstances that may arise that\n   could\
    \ result in one or more members of the committee being\n   unavailable to complete\
    \ their assigned duties, for example, health\n   concerns, family issues, or a\
    \ change of priorities at work.  A\n   committee member may choose to resign for\
    \ unspecified personal\n   reasons.  In addition, the committee may not function\
    \ well as a group\n   because a member may be disruptive or otherwise uncooperative.\n\
    \   Regardless of the circumstances, if individual committee members can\n   not\
    \ work out their differences between themselves, the entire\n   committee may\
    \ be called upon to discuss and review the circumstances.\n   If a resolution\
    \ is not forthcoming, a vote may be conducted.  A\n   member may be recalled if\
    \ at least a quorum of all committee members\n   agree, including the vote of\
    \ the member being recalled.\n   If a liaison member is recalled, the committee\
    \ must notify the\n   affected organization and must allow a reasonable amount\
    \ of time for\n   a replacement to be identified by the organization before proceeding.\n\
    \   If an advisor member other than the prior year's Chair is recalled,\n   the\
    \ committee may choose to proceed without the advisor.  In the case\n   of the\
    \ prior year's Chair, the Internet Society President must be\n   notified and\
    \ the current Chair must be allowed a reasonable amount of\n   time to consult\
    \ with the Internet Society President to identify a\n   replacement before proceeding.\n\
    \   If a single voting volunteer position on the nominating committee is\n   vacated,\
    \ regardless of the circumstances, the committee may choose to\n   proceed with\
    \ only nine voting volunteers at its own discretion.  In\n   all other cases,\
    \ a new voting member must be selected, and the Chair\n   must repeat the random\
    \ selection process including an announcement of\n   the iteration prior to the\
    \ actual selection as stated elsewhere in\n   this document.\n   A change in the\
    \ primary affiliation of a voting volunteer during the\n   term of the nominating\
    \ committee is not a cause to request the recall\n   of that volunteer, even if\
    \ the change would result in more than two\n   voting volunteers with the same\
    \ affiliation.\n"

    \ resolve them within the\n   committee.  However, when circumstances do not permit\
    \ this or no\n   resolution is forthcoming, the process described here is to be\
    \ used.\n   The following rules apply to the process.\n   1.  The results of this\
    \ process are final and binding.  There is no\n       appeal.\n   2.  The process\
    \ begins with the submission of a request as described\n       below to the Internet\
    \ Society President.\n   3.  As soon as the process begins, the nominating committee\

    \       resolved except that it must not submit any candidates to a\n       confirming\

    \ to the same\n       confidentiality rules as each member of the nominating committee.\n\
    \   5.  The process should be completed within two weeks.\n   The process is as\
    \ follows:\n   1.  The party seeking resolution submits a written request (email\
    \ is\n       acceptable) to the Internet Society President detailing the issue\n\
    \       to be resolved.\n   2.  The Internet Society President appoints an arbiter\
    \ to investigate\n       and resolve the issue.  A self-appointment is permitted.\n\
    \   3.  The arbiter investigates the issue making every reasonable effort\n  \
    \     to understand both sides of the issue.  Since the arbiter is\n       subject\
    \ to the same confidentiality obligations as all nominating\n       committee\
    \ members, all members are expected to cooperate fully\n       with the arbiter\
    \ and to provide all relevant information to the\n       arbiter for review.\n\
    \   4.  After consultation with the two principal parties to the issue,\n    \
    \   the arbiter decides on a resolution.  Whatever actions are\n       necessary\
    \ to execute the resolution are immediately begun and\n       completed as quickly\
    \ as possible.\n   5.  The arbiter summarizes the issue, the resolution, and the\n\
    \       rationale for the resolution for the Internet Society President.\n   6.\
    \  In consultation with the Internet Society President, the arbiter\n       prepares\
    \ a report of the dispute and its resolution.  The report\n       should include\

- title: Appendix B.  Oral Tradition
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Oral Tradition\n   Over the years, various nominating committees\
    \ have learned through\n   oral tradition passed on by liaisons that there are\
    \ certain\n   consistencies in the process and information considered during\n\
    \   deliberations.  Some items from that oral tradition are collected\n   here\
    \ to facilitate its consideration by future nominating committees.\n   1.  It\
    \ has been found that experience as an IETF Working Group Chair\n       or an\
    \ IRTF Research Group Chair is helpful in giving a nominee\n       experience\
    \ of what the job of an Area Director involves.  It also\n       helps a nominating\
    \ committee judge the technical, people, and\n       process management skills\
    \ of the nominee.\n   2.  No person should serve both on the IAB and as an Area\
    \ Director,\n       except the IETF Chair whose roles as an IAB member and Area\n\
    \       Director of the General Area are set out elsewhere.\n   3.  The strength\
    \ of the IAB is found in part in the balance of the\n       demographics of its\
    \ members (e.g., national distribution, years\n       of experience, gender, etc.),\
    \ the combined skill set of its\n       members, and the combined sectors (e.g.,\
    \ industry, academia,\n       etc.) represented by its members.\n   4.  There\
    \ are no term limits explicitly because the issue of\n       continuity versus\
    \ turnover should be evaluated each year\n       according to the expectations\
    \ of the IETF community, as it is\n       understood by each nominating committee.\n\
    \   5.  The number of nominating committee members with the same primary\n   \
    \    affiliation is limited in order to avoid the appearance of\n       improper\
    \ bias in choosing the leadership of the IETF.  Rather\n       than defining precise\
    \ rules for how to define \"affiliation\", the\n       IETF community depends\
    \ on the honor and integrity of the\n       participants to make the process work.\n"

  - "Appendix C.  Nominating Committee Timeline\n   This appendix is included for\
    \ the convenience of the reader and is\n   not to be interpreted as the definitive\
    \ timeline.  It is intended to\n   capture the detail described elsewhere in this\
    \ document in one place.\n   Although every effort has been made to ensure the\
    \ description here is\n   consistent with the description elsewhere, if there\
    \ are any conflicts\n   the definitive rule is the one in the main body of this\
    \ document.\n   The only absolute in the timeline rules for the annual process\
    \ is\n   that its completion is due by the First IETF of the year after the\n\
    \   nominating committee begins its term.  This is supported by the fact\n   that\
    \ the confirmed candidate terms begin during the week of the First\n   IETF.\n\
    \   The overall annual process is designed to be completed in seven\n   months.\
    \  It is expected to start nine months prior to the First IETF.\n   The time is\
    \ split between three major components of the process\n   roughly as follows:\n\
    \   1.  First is the selection and organization of the committee members.\n  \
    \     Three months are allotted for this process.\n   2.  Second is the selection\
    \ of the candidates by the nominating\n       committee.  Four months are allotted\
    \ for this process.\n   3.  Third is the confirmation of the candidates by their\
    \ respective\n       confirming bodies.  Two months are allotted for this process.\n\
    \   The following list captures the details of the milestones within each\n  \
    \ component.  For illustrative purposes, the list presumes the Friday\n   before\
    \ the First IETF is March 1.  Numbers shown in square brackets\n   indicate the\
    \ expected number of weeks at each step.\n   1.   BEGIN Eight Months Prior to\
    \ First IETF (approx.  June 1);\n        Internet Society President appoints the\
    \ Chair.  The appointment\n        must be done no later than the Second IETF\
    \ or eight months prior\n        to the First IETF, whichever comes first.  The\
    \ Chair must be\n        announced and recognized during a plenary session of\
    \ the Second\n        IETF. [0]\n   2.   The Chair establishes and announces milestones\
    \ to ensure the\n        timely selection of the nominating committee members.\
    \ [1]\n   3.   The Chair contacts the IESG, IAB, and Internet Society Board of\n\
    \        Trustees and requests a liaison.  The Chair contacts the prior\n    \
    \    year's Chair and requests an advisor.  The Chair obtains the\n        list\
    \ of IESG, IAB, and IAOC open positions and descriptions from\n        the IETF\
    \ Executive Director. [0]\n   4.   The Chair announces the solicitation for voting\
    \ volunteer\n        members that must remain open for at least 30 days.  The\n\
    \        announcement must be done no later than seven months and two\n      \
    \  weeks prior to the First IETF (approx.  June 15). [6]\n   5.   After the solicitation\
    \ closes, the Chair announces the pool of\n        volunteers and the date of\
    \ the random selection, which must be\n        at least one week in the future.\
    \  The announcement must be done\n        no later than six months and two weeks\
    \ prior to the First IETF\n        (approx.  July 15). [1]\n   6.   On the appointed\
    \ day, the random selection occurs and the Chair\n        announces the members\
    \ of the committee and the one week\n        challenge period.  The announcement\
    \ must be done no later than\n        six months and one week prior to the First\
    \ IETF (approx.  July\n        22). [1]\n   7.   During the challenge period,\
    \ the Chair contacts each of the\n        committee members and confirms their\
    \ availability to\n        participate.  [0]\n   8.   After the challenge period\
    \ closes, the Chair announces the\n        members of the committee and its term\
    \ begins.  The announcement\n        must be done no later than six months prior\
    \ to the First IETF\n        (approx.  August 1). [1]\n   9.   The committee has\
    \ one month during which it is to self-organize\n        in preparation for completing\
    \ its assigned duties.  This must be\n        done no later than five months prior\
    \ to the First IETF (approx.\n        September 15). [6]\n   10.  END the Committee\
    \ Member Selection Process; BEGIN the Selection\n        of Candidates; Time is\
    \ at least five months prior to the First\n        IETF (approx.  September 22).\
    \ [0]\n   11.  The Chair establishes and announces the milestones to ensure the\n\
    \        timely selection of the candidates, including a call for\n        nominations\
    \ for the open positions.  The announcement must be\n        done no later than\
    \ five months prior to the First IETF (approx.\n        October 1). [1]\n   12.\
    \  Over the next three months, the nominating committee collects\n        input\
    \ and deliberates.  It should plan to conduct interviews and\n        other consultations\
    \ during the Third IETF.  The committee is due\n        to complete its candidate\
    \ selection no later than two months\n        prior to the First IETF (approx.\
    \  January 1). [17]\n   13.  END the Selection of Candidates; BEGIN the Confirmation\
    \ of\n        Candidates; Time is at least two months prior to the First IETF\n\
    \        (approx.  January 1). [0]\n   14.  The committee presents its candidates\
    \ to their respective\n        confirming bodies.  The presentation must be done\
    \ no later than\n        two months prior to the First IETF (approx.  January\
    \ 1). [0]\n   15.  The confirming bodies have one month to deliberate and, in\n\
    \        communication with the nominating committee, accept or reject\n     \
    \   candidates. [4]\n   16.  The Chair notifies and advises unsuccessful nominees\
    \ that they\n        have not been selected. [1]\n   17.  The Chair announces\
    \ the confirmed candidates.  The announcement\n        must be done no later than\
