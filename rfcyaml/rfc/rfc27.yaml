    \ NWG/RFC 10, 16, and 24.\nThe Network Working Group consists of interested people\
    \ from existing\nor potential ARPA network sites.  Membership is not closed.\n\
    The Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software,\nthe strategies\
    \ for using the network, and initial experience with the\nnetwork.\nDocumentation\
    \ of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.  Notes\nmay be produced at\
    \ any site by anybody and included in this series.\nCONTENT\nThe content of a\
    \ NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related\nto the HOST software\
    \ or other aspect of the network.  Notes are\nencouraged to be timely rather than\
    \ polished.  Philosophical positions\nwithout examples or other specifics, specific\
    \ suggestions or\nimplementation techniques without introductory or background\n\
    explication, and explicit questions without any attempted answers are\nall acceptable.\
    \  The minimum length for a NWG note is one sentence.\nThese standards (or lack\
    \ of them) are stated explicitly for two\nreasons.  First, there is a tendency\
    \ to view a written statement as\nipso facto authoritative, and we hope to promote\
    \ the exchange and\ndiscussion of considerably less than authoritative ideas.\
    \  Second,\nthere is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and\
    \ we\nhope to ease this inhibition.\nFORM\nEvery NWG note should bear the following\
    \ information:\n        1.  \"Network Working Group\"\n            \"Request for\
    \ Comments: X\" (X underscored)\n              where X is a serial number.  Serial\
    \ numbers are assigned\n              by Steve Crocker at UCLA.\n        2.  Author\
    \ and affiliation\n        3.  Date\n        4.  Title\n            The title\
