- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is sometimes desirable to format text in a particular\
    \ way for\n   presentation.  One approach is to provide formatting directives\
    \ in\n   juxtaposition to the text to be formatted.  That approach permits\n \
    \  reading the text in unformatted form (by ignoring the formatting\n   directives),\
    \ and it permits relatively simple repurposing of the text\n   for different media\
    \ by making suitable alterations to the formatting\n   directives or the environment\
    \ in which they operate.  One particular\n   series of related programs for formatting\
    \ text in accordance with\n   that model is often referred to generically as \"\
    troff\", although that\n   is also the name of a particular lineage of programs\
    \ within that\n   generic category for formatting text specifically for typesetter\
    \ and\n   typesetter-like devices.  A related formatting program within the\n\
    \   generic \"troff\" category, usually used for character-based output\n   such\
    \ as (formatted) plain text, is known as \"nroff\".  For the purpose\n   of the\
    \ media type defined here, the entire category will be referred\n   to simply\
    \ by the generic \"troff\" name.  Troff as a distinct set of\n   programs first\
    \ appeared in the early 1970s [N1.CSTR54], based on the\n   same formatting approach\
    \ used by some earlier programs (\"runoff\" and\n   \"roff\").  It has been used\
    \ to produce documents in various formats,\n   ranging in length from short memoranda\
    \ to books (including tables,\n   diagrams, and other non-textual content).  It\
    \ remains in wide use as\n   of the date of this document; this document itself\
    \ was prepared using\n   the troff family of tools per [I1.RFC2223] and [I2.Lilly05].\n\
    \   The basic format (juxtaposed text and formatting directives) is\n   extensible\
    \ and has been used for related formatting of text and\n   graphical document\
    \ content.  Formating is usually controlled by a set\n   of macros; a macro package\
    \ is a set of related formatting tools,\n   written in troff format (although\
    \ compressed binary representations\n   have also been used) and using basic formatting\
    \ directives to extend\n   and manage formatting capabilities for document authors.\
    \  There are a\n   number of preprocessors that transform a textual description\
    \ of some\n   content into the juxtaposed text and formatting directives necessary\n\
    \   to produce some desired output.  Preprocessors exist for formatting\n   of\
    \ tables of text and non-textual material, mathematical equations,\n   chemical\
    \ formulae, general line drawings, graphical representation of\n   data (in plotted\
    \ coordinate graphs, bar charts, etc.),\n   representations of data formats, and\
    \ representations of the abstract\n   mathematical construct known as a graph\
    \ (consisting of nodes and\n   edges).  Many such preprocessors use the same general\
    \ type of input\n   format as the formatters, and such input is explicitly within\
    \ the\n   scope of the media type described in this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirement Levels
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirement Levels\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\
    \ \"SHOULD NOT\",\n   \"RECOMMENDED\", and \"MAY\" in this document are to be\
    \ interpreted as\n   described in [N2.BCP14].\n"
- title: 3.  Scope of Specification
  contents:
  - "3.  Scope of Specification\n   The described media type refers to input that\
    \ may be processed by\n   preprocessors and by a page formatter.  It is intended\
    \ to be used\n   where content has some text that may be comprehensible (either\
    \ as\n   text per se or as a readable description of non-text content) without\n\
    \   machine processing of the content.  Where there is little or no\n   comprehensible\
    \ text content, this media type SHOULD NOT be used.  For\n   example, while output\
    \ of the \"pic\" preprocessor certainly consists of\n   troff-compatible sequences\
    \ of formatting directives, the sheer number\n   of individual directives interspersed\
    \ with any text that might be\n   present makes comprehension difficult, whereas\
    \ the preprocessor input\n   language (as described in the \"Published Specification\"\
    \ section of\n   the registration below) may provide a concise and comprehensible\n\
    \   description of graphical content.  Preprocessor output that includes\n   a\
    \ large proportion of formatting directives would best be labeled as\n   a subtype\
    \ of the application media type.  If particular preprocessor\n   input content\
    \ describes only graphical content with little or no\n   text, and which is not\
    \ readily comprehensible from a textual\n   description of the graphical elements,\
    \ a subtype of the image media\n   type would be appropriate.  The purpose of\
    \ labeling media content is\n   to provide information about that content to facilitate\
    \ use of the\n   content.  Use of a particular label requires some common sense\
    \ and\n   judgment, and SHOULD NOT be mechanically applied to content in the\n\
    \   absence of such judgment.\n"
- title: 4.  Registration Form
  contents:
  - "4.  Registration Form\n   The registration procedure and form are specified in\
    \ [I3.RFC4288].\n   Type name: text\n   Subtype name: troff\n   Required parameters:\
    \ none\n   Optional parameters:\n      charset: Must be a charset registered for\
    \ use with MIME text types\n         [N3.RFC2046], except where transport protocols\
    \ are explicitly\n         exempted from that restriction.  Specifies the charset\
    \ of the\n         media content.  With traditional source content, this will\
    \ be\n         the default \"US-ASCII\" charset.  Some recent versions of troff\n\
    \         processing software can handle Unicode input charsets; however,\n  \
    \       there may be interoperability issues if the input uses such a\n      \
    \   charset (see \"Interoperability considerations\" below).\n      process: Human-readable\
    \ additional information for formatting,\n         including environment variables,\
    \ preprocessor arguments and\n         order, formatter arguments, and postprocessors.\
    \  The parameter\n         value may need to be quoted or encoded as provided\
    \ for by\n         [N4.RFC2045] as amended by [N5.RFC2231] and [N6.Errata].\n\
    \         Generating implementations must not encode executable content\n    \
    \     and other implementations must not attempt any execution or\n         other\
    \ interpretation of the parameter value, as the parameter\n         value may\
    \ be prose text.  Implementations SHOULD present the\n         parameter (after\
    \ reassembly of continuation parameters, etc.)\n         as information related\
    \ to the media type, particularly if the\n         media content is not immediately\
    \ available (e.g., as with\n         message/external-body composite media [N3.RFC2046]).\n\
    \      resources: Lists any additional files or programs that are\n         required\
    \ for formatting (e.g., via .cf, .nx, .pi, .so, and/or\n         .sy directives).\n\
    \      versions: Human-readable indication of any known specific versions\n  \
    \       of preprocessors, formatter, macro packages, postprocessors,\n       \
    \  etc., required to process the content.\n   Encoding considerations:\n     \
    \ 7bit is adequate for traditional troff provided line endings are\n         canonicalized\
    \ per [N3.RFC2046].  Transfer of this media type\n         content via some transport\
    \ mechanisms may require or benefit\n         from encoding into a 7bit range\
    \ via a suitable encoding method\n         such as the ones described in [N4.RFC2045].\
    \  In particular,\n         some lines in this media type might begin or end with\n\
    \         whitespace, and that leading and/or trailing whitespace might\n    \
    \     be discarded or otherwise mangled if the media type is not\n         encoded\
    \ for transport.\n      8bit may be used with Unicode characters represented as\
    \ a series\n         of octets using the utf-8 charset [I4.RFC3629], where transport\n\
    \         methods permit 8bit content and where content line length is\n     \
    \    suitable.  Transport encoding considerations for robustness may\n       \
    \  also apply, and if a suitable 8bit encoding mechanism is\n         standardized,\
    \ it might be applicable for protection of media\n         during transport.\n\
    \      binary may be necessary when raw Unicode is used or where line\n      \
    \   lengths exceed the allowable maximum for 7bit and 8bit content\n         [N4.RFC2045],\
    \ and may be used in environments (e.g., HTTP\n         [I5.RFC2616]) where Unicode\
    \ characters may be transferred via a\n         non-MIME charset such as UTF-16\
    \ [I6.RFC2781].\n      framed encoding MAY be used, but is not required and is\
    \ not\n         generally useful with this media type.\n   Restrictions on usage:\
    \ none\n   Security considerations: Some troff directives (.sy and .pi) can\n\
    \      cause arbitrary external programs to be run.  Several troff\n      directives\
    \ (.so, .nx, and .cf) may read external files (and/or\n      devices on systems\
    \ that support device input via file system\n      semantics) during processing.\
    \  Several preprocessors have similar\n      features.  Some implementations have\
    \ a \"safe\" mode that disables\n      some of these features.  Formatters and\
    \ preprocessors are\n      programmable, and it is possible to provide input which\
    \ specifies\n      an infinite loop, which could result in denial of service,\
    \ even in\n      implementations that restrict use of directives that access\n\
    \      external resources.  Users of this media type SHOULD be vigilant\n    \
    \  of the potential for damage that may be caused by careless\n      processing\
    \ of media obtained from untrusted sources.\n      Processing of this media type\
    \ other than by facilities that strip\n      or ignore potentially dangerous directives,\
    \ and processing by\n      preprocessors and/or postprocessors, SHOULD NOT be\
    \ invoked\n      automatically (i.e., without user confirmation).  In some cases,\n\
    \      as this is a text media type (i.e., it contains text that is\n      comprehensible\
    \ without processing), it may be sufficient to\n      present the media type with\
    \ no processing at all.  However, like\n      any other text media, this media\
    \ type may contain control\n      characters, and implementers SHOULD take precautions\
    \ against\n      untoward consequences of sending raw control characters to display\n\
    \      devices.\n      Users of this media type SHOULD carefully scrutinize suggested\n\
    \      command lines associated with the \"process\" parameter, contained\n  \
    \    in comments within the media, or conveyed via external mechanisms,\n    \
    \  both for attempts at social engineering and for the effects of\n      ill-considered\
    \ values of the parameter.  While some\n      implementations may have \"safe\"\
    \ modes, those using this media type\n      MUST NOT presume that they are available\
    \ or active.\n      Comments may be included in troff source; comments are not\n\
    \      formatted for output.  However, they are of course readable in the\n  \
    \    troff document source.  Authors should be careful about\n      information\
    \ placed in comments, as such information may result in\n      a leak of information,\
    \ or may have other undesirable consequences.\n      While it is possible to overlay\
    \ text with graphics or otherwise\n      produce formatting instructions that\
    \ would visually obscure text\n      when formatted, such measures do not prevent\
    \ extracting text from\n      the document source, and might be ineffective in\
    \ obscuring text\n      when formatted electronically, e.g., as PostScript or\
    \ PDF.\n   Interoperability considerations: Recent implementations of\n      formatters,\
    \ macro packages, and preprocessors may include some\n      extended capabilities\
    \ that are not present in earlier\n      implementations.  Use of such extensions\
    \ obviously limits the\n      ability to produce consistent formatted output at\
    \ sites with\n      implementations that do not support those extensions.  Use\
    \ of any\n      such extensions in a particular document using this media type\n\
    \      SHOULD be indicated via the \"versions\" parameter value.\n      As mentioned\
    \ in the Introduction, macro packages are troff\n      documents, and their content\
    \ may be subject to copyright.  That\n      has led to multiple independent implementations\
    \ of macro packages,\n      which may exhibit gross or subtle differences with\
    \ some content.\n      Some preprocessors or postprocessors might be unavailable\
    \ at some\n      sites.  Where some implementation is available, there may be\n\
    \      differences in implementation that affect the output produced.\n      For\
    \ example, some versions of the \"pic\" preprocessor provide the\n      capability\
    \ to fill a bounded graphical object; others lack that\n      capability.  Of\
    \ those that support that feature, there are\n      differences in whether a solid\
    \ fill is represented by a value of\n      0.0 vs. 1.0.  Some implementations\
    \ support only gray-scale output;\n      others support color.\n      Preprocessors\
    \ or postprocessors may depend on additional programs\n      such as awk, and\
    \ implementation differences (including bugs) may\n      lead to different results\
    \ on different systems (or even on the\n      same system with a different environment).\n\
    \      There is a wide variation in the capabilities of various\n      presentation\
    \ media and the devices used to prepare content for\n      presentation.  Indeed,\
    \ that is one reason that there are two basic\n      formatter program types (nroff\
    \ for output where limited formatting\n      control is available, and troff where\
    \ a greater range of control\n      is possible).  Clearly, a document designed\
    \ to use complex or\n      sophisticated formatting might not be representable\
    \ in simpler\n      media or with devices lacking certain capabilities.  Often\
    \ it is\n      possible to produce a somewhat inferior approximation; colors\n\
    \      might be represented as gray-scale values, accented characters\n      might\
    \ be produced by overstriking, italics might be represented by\n      underlining,\
    \ etc.\n      Various systems store text with different line ending codings.\n\
    \      For the purpose of transferring this media type between systems or\n  \
    \    between applications using MIME methods, line endings MUST use the\n    \
    \  canonical CRLF line ending per [N3.RFC2046].\n   Published specification: [N1.CSTR54]\n\
    \   Applications which use this media type: The following applications in\n  \

    \   Magic number(s): None; however, the content format is distinctive\n      \
    \   (see \"Published specification\").\n      File extension(s): Files do not\
    \ require any specific \"extension\".\n         Many are in use as a convenience\
    \ for mechanized processing of\n         files, some associated with specific\
    \ macro packages or\n         preprocessors; others are ad hoc.  File names are\
    \ orthogonal to\n         the nature of the content.  In particular, while a file\
    \ name or\n         a component of a name may be useful in some types of automated\n\
    \         processing of files, the name or component might not be capable\n  \
    \       of indicating subtleties such as proportion of textual (as\n         opposed\
    \ to image or formatting directive) content.  This media\n         type SHOULD\
    \ NOT be assigned a relationship with any file\n         \"extension\" where content\
    \ may be untrusted unless there is\n         provision for human judgment that\
    \ may be used to override that\n         relationship for individual files.  Where\
    \ appropriate, a file\n         name MAY be suggested by a suitable mechanism\
    \ such as the one\n         specified in [I17.RFC2183] as amended by [N5.RFC2231]\
