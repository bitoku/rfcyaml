- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Security is an important aspect of all networks, MPLS and\
    \ GMPLS\n   networks being no exception.\n   MPLS and GMPLS are described in [RFC3031]\
    \ and [RFC3945].  Various\n   security considerations have been addressed in each\
    \ of the many RFCs\n   on MPLS and GMPLS technologies, but no single document\
    \ covers general\n   security considerations.  The motivation for creating this\
    \ document\n   is to provide a comprehensive and consistent security framework\
    \ for\n   MPLS and GMPLS networks.  Each individual document may point to this\n\
    \   document for general security considerations in addition to providing\n  \
    \ security considerations specific to the particular technologies the\n   document\
    \ is describing.\n   In this document, we first describe the security threats\
    \ relevant in\n   the context of MPLS and GMPLS and the defensive techniques to\
    \ combat\n   those threats.  We consider security issues resulting both from\n\
    \   malicious or incorrect behavior of users and other parties and from\n   negligent\
    \ or incorrect behavior of providers.  An important part of\n   security defense\
    \ is the detection and reporting of a security attack,\n   which is also addressed\
    \ in this document.\n   We then discuss possible service provider security requirements\
    \ in an\n   MPLS or GMPLS environment.  Users have expectations for the security\n\
    \   characteristics of MPLS or GMPLS networks.  These include security\n   requirements\
    \ for equipment supporting MPLS and GMPLS and operational\n   security requirements\
    \ for providers.  Service providers must protect\n   their network infrastructure\
    \ and make it secure to the level required\n   to provide services over their\
    \ MPLS or GMPLS networks.\n   Inter-AS and inter-provider security are discussed\
    \ with special\n   emphasis, because the security risk factors are higher with\
    \ inter-\n   provider connections.  Note that inter-carrier MPLS security is also\n\
    \   considered in [MFA-MPLS-ICI].\n   Depending on different MPLS or GMPLS techniques\
    \ used, the degree of\n   risk and the mitigation methodologies vary.  This document\
    \ discusses\n   the security aspects and requirements for certain basic MPLS and\n\
    \   GMPLS techniques and interconnection models.  This document does not\n   attempt\
    \ to cover all current and future MPLS and GMPLS technologies,\n   as it is not\
    \ within the scope of this document to analyze the\n   security properties of\
    \ specific technologies.\n   It is important to clarify that, in this document,\
    \ we limit ourselves\n   to describing the providers' security requirements that\
    \ pertain to\n   MPLS and GMPLS networks, not including the connected user sites.\n\
    \   Readers may refer to the \"Security Best Practices Efforts and\n   Documents\"\
    \ [OPSEC-EFFORTS] and \"Security Mechanisms for the Internet\"\n   [RFC3631] for\
    \ general network operation security considerations.  It\n   is not our intention,\
    \ however, to formulate precise \"requirements\"\n   for each specific technology\
    \ in terms of defining the mechanisms and\n   techniques that must be implemented\
    \ to satisfy such security\n   requirements.\n"

- title: 2.2.  MPLS and GMPLS Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.2.  MPLS and GMPLS Terminology\n   This document uses MPLS- and GMPLS-specific\
    \ terminology.  Definitions\n   and details about MPLS and GMPLS terminology can\
    \ be found in\n   [RFC3031] and [RFC3945].  The most important definitions are\
    \ repeated\n   in this section; for other definitions, the reader is referred\
    \ to\n   [RFC3031] and [RFC3945].\n   Core network: An MPLS/GMPLS core network\
    \ is defined as the central\n   network infrastructure that consists of P and\
    \ PE routers.  An\n   MPLS/GMPLS core network may consist of one or more networks\
    \ belonging\n   to a single SP.\n   Customer Edge (CE) device: A Customer Edge\
    \ device is a router or a\n   switch in the customer's network interfacing with\
    \ the Service\n   Provider's network.\n   Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC):\
    \ A group of IP packets that are\n   forwarded in the same manner (e.g., over\
    \ the same path, with the same\n   forwarding treatment).\n   Label: A short,\
    \ fixed length, physically contiguous identifier,\n   usually of local significance.\n\
    \   Label merging: the replacement of multiple incoming labels for a\n   particular\
    \ FEC with a single outgoing label.\n   Label Switched Hop: A hop between two\
    \ MPLS nodes, on which forwarding\n   is done using labels.\n   Label Switched\
    \ Path (LSP): The path through one or more LSRs at one\n   level of the hierarchy\
    \ followed by packets in a particular FEC.\n   Label Switching Routers (LSRs):\
    \ An MPLS/GMPLS node assumed to have a\n   forwarding plane that is capable of\
    \ (a) recognizing either packet or\n   cell boundaries, and (b) being able to\
    \ process either packet headers\n   or cell headers.\n   Loop Detection: A method\
    \ of dealing with loops in which loops are\n   allowed to be set up, and data\
    \ may be transmitted over the loop, but\n   the loop is later detected.\n   Loop\
    \ Prevention: A method of dealing with loops in which data is\n   never transmitted\
    \ over a loop.\n   Label Stack: An ordered set of labels.\n   Merge Point: A node\
    \ at which label merging is done.\n   MPLS Domain: A contiguous set of nodes that\
    \ perform MPLS routing and\n   forwarding and are also in one Routing or Administrative\
    \ Domain.\n   MPLS Edge Node: An MPLS node that connects an MPLS domain with a\
    \ node\n   outside of the domain, either because it does not run MPLS, or\n  \
    \ because it is in a different domain.  Note that if an LSR has a\n   neighboring\
    \ host not running MPLS, then that LSR is an MPLS edge\n   node.\n   MPLS Egress\
    \ Node: An MPLS edge node in its role in handling traffic\n   as it leaves an\
    \ MPLS domain.\n   MPLS Ingress Node: A MPLS edge node in its role in handling\
    \ traffic\n   as it enters a MPLS domain.\n   MPLS Label: A label carried in a\
    \ packet header, which represents the\n   packet's FEC.\n   MPLS Node: A node\
    \ running MPLS.  An MPLS node is aware of MPLS\n   control protocols, runs one\
    \ or more routing protocols, and is capable\n   of forwarding packets based on\
    \ labels.  An MPLS node may optionally\n   be also capable of forwarding native\
    \ IP packets.\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS): MPLS is an architecture\
    \ for\n   efficient data packet switching and routing.  MPLS assigns data\n  \
    \ packets with labels.  Instead of performing the longest match for\n   each packet's\
    \ destination as in conventional IP forwarding, MPLS\n   makes the packet-forwarding\
    \ decisions solely on the contents of the\n   label without examining the packet\
    \ itself.  This allows the creation\n   of end-to-end circuits across any type\
    \ of transport medium, using any\n   protocols.\n   P: Provider Router.  A Provider\
    \ Router is a router in the Service\n   Provider's core network that does not\
    \ have interfaces directly\n   towards the customer.  A P router is used to interconnect\
    \ the PE\n   routers and/or other P routers within the core network.\n   PE: Provider\
    \ Edge device.  A Provider Edge device is the equipment in\n   the Service Provider's\
    \ network that interfaces with the equipment in\n   the customer's network.\n\
    \   PPVPN: Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Network, including Layer\n   2\
    \ VPNs and Layer 3 VPNs.\n   VPN: Virtual Private Network, which restricts communication\
    \ between a\n   set of sites, making use of an IP backbone shared by traffic not\n\
    \   going to or not coming from those sites [RFC4110].\n"

  - "3.  Security Reference Models\n   This section defines a reference model for\
    \ security in MPLS/GMPLS\n   networks.\n   This document defines each MPLS/GMPLS\
    \ core in a single domain to be a\n   trusted zone.  A primary concern is about\
    \ security aspects that\n   relate to breaches of security from the \"outside\"\
    \ of a trusted zone\n   to the \"inside\" of this zone.  Figure 1 depicts the\
    \ concept of\n   trusted zones within the MPLS/GMPLS framework.\n            \

    \ Core with user connections and Internet connection\n             Figure 1: The\
    \ MPLS/GMPLS Trusted Zone Model\n   The trusted zone is the MPLS/GMPLS core in\
    \ a single AS within a\n   single Service Provider.\n   A trusted zone contains\
    \ elements and users with similar security\n   properties, such as exposure and\
    \ risk level.  In the MPLS context, an\n   organization is typically considered\
    \ as one trusted zone.\n   The boundaries of a trust domain should be carefully\
    \ defined when\n   analyzing the security properties of each individual network,\
    \ e.g.,\n   the boundaries can be at the link termination, remote peers, areas,\n\
    \   or quite commonly, ASes.\n   In principle, the trusted zones should be separate;\
    \ however,\n   typically MPLS core networks also offer Internet access, in which\n\
    \   case a transit point (marked with \"XXX\" in Figure 1) is defined.  In\n \
    \  the case of MPLS/GMPLS inter-provider connections or InterCarrier\n   Interconnect\
    \ (ICI), the trusted zone of each provider ends at the\n   respective ASBRs (ASBR1\
    \ and ASBR2 for Provider A and ASBR3 and ASBR4\n   for Provider B in Figure 2).\n\
    \   A key requirement of MPLS and GMPLS networks is that the security of\n   the\
    \ trusted zone not be compromised by interconnecting the MPLS/GMPLS\n   core infrastructure\
    \ with another provider's core (MPLS/GMPLS or non-\n   MPLS/GMPLS), the Internet,\
    \ or end users.\n   In addition, neighbors may be trusted or untrusted.  Neighbors\
    \ may be\n   authorized or unauthorized.  An authorized neighbor is the neighbor\n\
    \   one establishes a peering relationship with.  Even though a neighbor\n   may\
    \ be authorized for communication, it may not be trusted.  For\n   example, when\
    \ connecting with another provider's ASBRs to set up\n   inter-AS LSPs, the other\
    \ provider is considered an untrusted but\n   authorized neighbor.\n         \

    \ the best\n   current operational security practices in Internet Service Provider\n\
    \   environments.\n   A successful attack on a particular MPLS/GMPLS network or\
    \ on an SP's\n   MPLS/GMPLS infrastructure may cause one or more of the following\
    \ ill\n   effects:\n   -  Observation, modification, or deletion of a provider's\

    \ be noted that while connectivity in the MPLS control plane\n   uses the same\
    \ links and network resources as are used by the data\n   plane, the GMPLS control\
    \ plane may be provided by separate resources\n   from those used in the data\
    \ plane.  That is, the GMPLS control plane\n   may be physically separate from\
    \ the data plane.\n   The different cases of physically congruent and physically\
    \ separate\n   control/data planes lead to slightly different possibilities of\n\
    \   attack, although most of the cases are the same.  Note that, for\n   example,\
    \ the data plane cannot be directly congested by an attack on\n   a physically\
    \ separate control plane as it could be if the control and\n   data planes shared\
    \ network resources.  Note also that if the control\n   plane uses diverse resources\
    \ from the data plane, no assumptions\n   should be made about the security of\

    \ packet forwarding capacity, session\n   capacity for various protocols, CPU\
    \ power, table size, storage\n   overflows, and so on.\n   DoS attacks of the\

    \ and Management plane have been discussed\n   extensively as general network\
    \ security issues over the last 20\n   years.  RFC 4778 [RFC4778] may serve as\
    \ the best current operational\n   security practices in Internet Service Provider\
    \ environments.  RFC\n   4377 [RFC4377] provided Operations and Management Requirements\
    \ for\n   MPLS networks.  See also the Security Considerations of RFC 4377 and\n\
    \   Section 7 of RFC 4378 [RFC4378].\n   Operation and Management across the MPLS-ICI\
    \ could also be the source\n   of security threats on the provider infrastructure\
    \ as well as the\n   service offered over the MPLS-ICI.  A large volume of Operation\
    \ and\n   Management messages could overwhelm the processing capabilities of an\n\
    \   ASBR if the ASBR is not properly protected.  Maliciously generated\n   Operation\
    \ and Management messages could also be used to bring down an\n   otherwise healthy\
    \ service (e.g., MPLS Pseudowire), and therefore\n   affect service security.\
    \  LSP ping does not support authentication\n   today, and that support should\
    \ be a subject for future\n   considerations.  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection\
    \ (BFD), however,\n   does have support for carrying an authentication object.\
    \  It also\n   supports Time-To-Live (TTL) processing as an anti-replay measure.\n\
    \   Implementations conformant with this MPLS-ICI should support BFD\n   authentication\
    \ and must support the procedures for TTL processing.\n   Regarding GMPLS Operation\
    \ and Management considerations in optical\n   interworking, there is a good discussion\
    \ on security for management\n   interfaces to Network Elements [OIF-Sec-Mag].\n\
    \   Network elements typically have one or more (in some cases many)\n   Operation\
    \ and Management interfaces used for network management,\n   billing and accounting,\
    \ configuration, maintenance, and other\n   administrative activities.\n   Remote\
    \ access to a network element through these Operation and\n   Management interfaces\
    \ is frequently a requirement.  Securing the\n   control protocols while leaving\
    \ these Operation and Management\n   interfaces unprotected opens up a huge security\
    \ vulnerability.\n   Network elements are an attractive target for intruders who\
    \ want to\n   disrupt or gain free access to telecommunications facilities.  Much\n\
    \   has been written about this subject since the 1980s.  In the 1990s,\n   telecommunications\
    \ facilities were identified in the U.S. and other\n   countries as part of the\
    \ \"critical infrastructure\", and increased\n   emphasis was placed on thwarting\
    \ such attacks from a wider range of\n   potentially well-funded and determined\
    \ adversaries.\n   At one time, careful access controls and password management\
    \ were a\n   sufficient defense, but are no longer.  Networks using the TCP/IP\n\
    \   protocol suite are vulnerable to forged source addresses, recording\n   and\
    \ later replay, packet sniffers picking up passwords, re-routing of\n   traffic\
    \ to facilitate eavesdropping or tampering, active hijacking\n   attacks of TCP\
    \ connections, and a variety of denial-of-service\n   attacks.  The ease of forging\
    \ TCP/IP packets is the main reason\n   network management protocols lacking strong\
    \ security have not been\n   used to configure network elements (e.g., with the\
    \ SNMP SET command).\n   Readily available hacking tools exist that let an eavesdropper\
    \ on a\n   LAN take over one end of any TCP connection, so that the legitimate\n\
    \   party is cut off.  In addition, enterprises and Service Providers in\n   some\
    \ jurisdictions need to safeguard data about their users and\n   network configurations\
    \ from prying.  An attacker could eavesdrop and\n   observe traffic to analyze\
    \ usage patterns and map a network\n   configuration; an attacker could also gain\
    \ access to systems and\n   manipulate configuration data or send malicious commands.\n\
    \   Therefore, in addition to authenticating the human user, more\n   sophisticated\
    \ protocol security is needed for Operation and\n   Management interfaces, especially\
    \ when they are configured over\n   TCP/IP stacks.  Finally, relying on a perimeter\
    \ defense, such as\n   firewalls, is insufficient protection against \"insider\
    \ attacks\" or\n   against penetrations that compromise a system inside the firewall\
    \ as\n   a launching pad to attack network elements.  The insider attack is\n\
    \   discussed in the following session.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Insider Attacks Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Insider Attacks Considerations\n   The chain of trust model means that\
    \ MPLS and GMPLS networks are\n   particularly vulnerable to insider attacks.\
    \  These can be launched by\n   any malign person with access to any LSR in the\
    \ trust domain.\n   Insider attacks could also be launched by compromised software\
    \ within\n   the trust domain.  Such attacks could, for example, advertise non-\n\
    \   existent resources, modify advertisements from other routers, request\n  \
    \ unwanted LSPs that use network resources, or deny or modify\n   legitimate LSP\
    \ requests.\n   Protection against insider attacks is largely for future study\

  - "5.  Defensive Techniques for MPLS/GMPLS Networks\n   The defensive techniques\
    \ discussed in this document are intended to\n   describe methods by which some\
    \ security threats can be addressed.\n   They are not intended as requirements\
    \ for all MPLS/GMPLS\n   implementations.  The MPLS/GMPLS provider should determine\
    \ the\n   applicability of these techniques to the provider's specific service\n\
    \   offerings, and the end user may wish to assess the value of these\n   techniques\
    \ to the user's service requirements.  The operational\n   environment determines\
    \ the security requirements.  Therefore,\n   protocol designers need to provide\
    \ a full set of security services,\n   which can be used where appropriate.\n\
    \   The techniques discussed here include encryption, authentication,\n   filtering,\
    \ firewalls, access control, isolation, aggregation, and\n   others.\n   Often,\
    \ security is achieved by careful protocol design, rather than\n   by adding a\
    \ security method.  For example, one method of mitigating\n   DoS attacks is to\
    \ make sure that innocent parties cannot be used to\n   amplify the attack.  Security\
    \ works better when it is \"designed in\"\n   rather than \"added on\".\n   Nothing\
    \ is ever 100% secure.  Defense therefore involves protecting\n   against those\
    \ attacks that are most likely to occur or that have the\n   most direct consequences\
    \ if successful.  For those attacks that are\n   protected against, absolute protection\
    \ is seldom achievable; more\n   often it is sufficient just to make the cost\
    \ of a successful attack\n   greater than what the adversary will be willing or\
    \ able to expend.\n   Successfully defending against an attack does not necessarily\
    \ mean\n   the attack must be prevented from happening or from reaching its\n\
    \   target.  In many cases, the network can instead be designed to\n   withstand\
    \ the attack.  For example, the introduction of inauthentic\n   packets could\
    \ be defended against by preventing their introduction in\n   the first place,\
    \ or by making it possible to identify and eliminate\n   them before delivery\
    \ to the MPLS/GMPLS user's system.  The latter is\n   frequently a much easier\

  - "5.2.  Cryptographic Techniques\n   MPLS/GMPLS defenses against a wide variety\
    \ of attacks can be enhanced\n   by the proper application of cryptographic techniques.\
    \  These same\n   cryptographic techniques are applicable to general network\n\
    \   communications and can provide confidentiality (encryption) of\n   communication\
    \ between devices, authenticate the identities of the\n   devices, and detect\
    \ whether the data being communicated has been\n   changed during transit or replayed\
    \ from previous messages.\n   Several aspects of authentication are addressed\
    \ in some detail in a\n   separate \"Authentication\" section (Section 5.1).\n\
    \   Cryptographic methods add complexity to a service and thus, for a few\n  \
    \ reasons, may not be the most practical solution in every case.\n   Cryptography\
    \ adds an additional computational burden to devices,\n   which may reduce the\
    \ number of user connections that can be handled\n   on a device or otherwise\
    \ reduce the capacity of the device,\n   potentially driving up the provider's\
    \ costs.  Typically, configuring\n   encryption services on devices adds to the\
    \ complexity of their\n   configuration and adds labor cost.  Some key management\
    \ system is\n   usually needed.  Packet sizes are typically increased when the\n\
    \   packets are encrypted or have integrity checks or replay counters\n   added,\
    \ increasing the network traffic load and adding to the\n   likelihood of packet\
    \ fragmentation with its increased overhead.\n   (This packet length increase\
    \ can often be mitigated to some extent by\n   data compression techniques, but\
    \ at the expense of additional\n   computational burden.) Finally, some providers\
    \ may employ enough\n   other defensive techniques, such as physical isolation\
    \ or filtering\n   and firewall techniques, that they may not perceive additional\n\
    \   benefit from encryption techniques.\n   Users may wish to provide confidentiality\
    \ end to end.  Generally,\n   encrypting for confidentiality must be accompanied\
    \ with cryptographic\n   integrity checks to prevent certain active attacks against\
    \ the\n   encrypted communications.  On today's processors, encryption and\n \
    \  integrity checks run extremely quickly, but key management may be\n   more\
    \ demanding in terms of both computational and administrative\n   overhead.\n\
    \   The trust model among the MPLS/GMPLS user, the MPLS/GMPLS provider,\n   and\
    \ other parts of the network is a major element in determining the\n   applicability\
    \ of cryptographic protection for any specific MPLS/GMPLS\n   implementation.\
    \  In particular, it determines where cryptographic\n   protection should be applied:\n\
    \   -  If the data path between the user's site and the provider's PE is\n   \
    \   not trusted, then it may be used on the PE-CE link.\n   -  If some part of\
    \ the backbone network is not trusted, particularly\n      in implementations\
    \ where traffic may travel across the Internet or\n      multiple providers' networks,\
    \ then the PE-PE traffic may be\n      cryptographically protected.  One also\
    \ should consider cases where\n      L1 technology may be vulnerable to eavesdropping.\n\
    \   -  If the user does not trust any zone outside of its premises, it\n     \
    \ may require end-to-end or CE-CE cryptographic protection.  This\n      fits\
    \ within the scope of this MPLS/GMPLS security framework when\n      the CE is\
    \ provisioned by the MPLS/GMPLS provider.\n   -  If the user requires remote access\
    \ to its site from a system at a\n      location that is not a customer location\
    \ (for example, access by a\n      traveler), there may be a requirement for cryptographically\n\
    \      protecting the traffic between that system and an access point or\n   \
    \   a customer's site.  If the MPLS/GMPLS provider supplies the access\n     \
    \ point, then the customer must cooperate with the provider to\n      handle the\
    \ access control services for the remote users.  These\n      access control services\
    \ are usually protected cryptographically,\n      as well.\n   Access control\
    \ usually starts with authentication of the entity.  If\n   cryptographic services\
    \ are part of the scenario, then it is important\n   to bind the authentication\
    \ to the key management.  Otherwise, the\n   protocol is vulnerable to being hijacked\
    \ between the authentication\n   and key management.\n   Although CE-CE cryptographic\
    \ protection can provide integrity and\n   confidentiality against third parties,\
    \ if the MPLS/GMPLS provider has\n   complete management control over the CE (encryption)\
    \ devices, then it\n   may be possible for the provider to gain access to the\
    \ user's traffic\n   or internal network.  Encryption devices could potentially\
    \ be\n   reconfigured to use null encryption, bypass cryptographic processing\n\
    \   altogether, reveal internal configuration, or provide some means of\n   sniffing\
    \ or diverting unencrypted traffic.  Thus an implementation\n   using CE-CE encryption\
    \ needs to consider the trust relationship\n   between the MPLS/GMPLS user and\
    \ provider.  MPLS/GMPLS users and\n   providers may wish to negotiate a service\
    \ level agreement (SLA) for\n   CE-CE encryption that provides an acceptable demarcation\
    \ of\n   responsibilities for management of cryptographic protection on the CE\n\
    \   devices.  The demarcation may also be affected by the capabilities of\n  \
    \ the CE devices.  For example, the CE might support some partitioning\n   of\
    \ management, a configuration lock-down ability, or shared\n   capability to verify\
    \ the configuration.  In general, the MPLS/GMPLS\n   user needs to have a fairly\
    \ high level of trust that the MPLS/GMPLS\n   provider will properly provision\
    \ and manage the CE devices, if the\n   managed CE-CE model is used.\n"

    \ [RFC4309] [RFC2411]\n   [IPSECME-ROADMAP] is the security protocol of choice\
    \ for protection\n   at the IP layer.  IPsec provides robust security for IP traffic\n\
    \   between pairs of devices.  Non-IP traffic, such as IS-IS routing,\n   must\
    \ be converted to IP (e.g., by encapsulation) in order to use\n   IPsec.  When\
    \ the MPLS is encapsulating IP traffic, then IPsec covers\n   the encryption of\
    \ the IP client layer; for non-IP client traffic, see\n   Section 5.2.4 (MPLS\
    \ PWs).\n   In the MPLS/GMPLS model, IPsec can be employed to protect IP traffic\n\
    \   between PEs, between a PE and a CE, or from CE to CE.  CE-to-CE IPsec\n  \
    \ may be employed in either a provider-provisioned or a user-\n   provisioned\
    \ model.  Likewise, IPsec protection of data performed\n   within the user's site\
    \ is outside the scope of this document, because\n   it is simply handled as user\
    \ data by the MPLS/GMPLS core.  However,\n   if the SP performs compression, pre-encryption\
    \ will have a major\n   effect on that operation.\n   IPsec does not itself specify\
    \ cryptographic algorithms.  It can use a\n   variety of integrity or confidentiality\
    \ algorithms (or even combined\n   integrity and confidentiality algorithms) with\
    \ various key lengths,\n   such as AES encryption or AES message integrity checks.\
    \  There are\n   trade-offs between key length, computational burden, and the\
    \ level of\n   security of the encryption.  A full discussion of these trade-offs\
    \ is\n   beyond the scope of this document.  In practice, any currently\n   recommended\
    \ IPsec protection offers enough security to reduce the\n   likelihood of its\
    \ being directly targeted by an attacker\n   substantially; other weaker links\
    \ in the chain of security are likely\n   to be attacked first.  MPLS/GMPLS users\
    \ may wish to use a Service\n   Level Agreement (SLA) specifying the SP's responsibility\
    \ for ensuring\n   data integrity and confidentiality, rather than analyzing the\n\
    \   specific encryption techniques used in the MPLS/GMPLS service.\n   Encryption\
    \ algorithms generally come with two parameters: mode such\n   as Cipher Block\
    \ Chaining and key length such as AES-192.  (This\n   should not be confused with\
    \ two other senses in which the word \"mode\"\n   is used: IPsec itself can be\
    \ used in Tunnel Mode or Transport Mode,\n   and IKE [version 1] uses Main Mode,\
    \ Aggressive Mode, or Quick Mode).\n   It should be stressed that IPsec encryption\
    \ without an integrity\n   check is a state of sin.\n   For many of the MPLS/GMPLS\
    \ provider's network control messages and\n   some user requirements, cryptographic\
    \ authentication of messages\n   without encryption of the contents of the message\
    \ may provide\n   appropriate security.  Using IPsec, authentication of messages\
    \ is\n   provided by the Authentication Header (AH) or through the use of the\n\
    \   Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP) with NULL encryption.  Where\n   control\
    \ messages require integrity but do not use IPsec, other\n   cryptographic authentication\
    \ methods are often available.  Message\n   authentication methods currently considered\
    \ to be secure are based on\n   hashed message authentication codes (HMAC) [RFC2104]\
    \ implemented with\n   a secure hash algorithm such as Secure Hash Algorithm 1\
    \ (SHA-1)\n   [RFC3174].  No attacks against HMAC SHA-1 are likely to play out\
    \ in\n   the near future, but it is possible that people will soon find SHA-1\n\
    \   collisions.  Thus, it is important that mechanisms be designed to be\n   flexible\
    \ about the choice of hash functions and message integrity\n   checks.  Also,\
    \ many of these mechanisms do not include a convenient\n   way to manage and update\

    \ MPLS/GMPLS, cryptographic protection could potentially be applied\n   to the\
    \ MPLS/GMPLS traffic at several different places.  This section\n   discusses\
    \ some of the tradeoffs in implementing encryption in several\n   different connection\
    \ topologies among different devices within an\n   MPLS/GMPLS network.\n   Cryptographic\
    \ protection typically involves a pair of devices that\n   protect the traffic\

    \ \"hop\"), or intervening devices may\n   transport the protected traffic between\

    \ every adjacent pair of\n   devices along a given path (hop-by-hop), or using\
    \ protection only\n   between the end devices along a given path (end-to-end).\
    \  To keep\n   this discussion within the scope of this document, the latter (\"\

    \ 3: Simplified Topology Traversing through MPLS/GMPLS Core\n   Within this simplified\
    \ topology, and assuming that the P devices are\n   not involved with cryptographic\
    \ protection, four basic, feasible\n   configurations exist for protecting connections\
    \ among the devices:\n   1) Site-to-site (CE-to-CE) - Apply confidentiality or\
    \ integrity\n      services between the two CE devices, so that traffic will be\n\
    \      protected throughout the SP's network.\n   2) Provider edge-to-edge (PE-to-PE)\
    \ - Apply confidentiality or\n      integrity services between the two PE devices.\
    \  Unprotected\n      traffic is received at one PE from the customer's CE, then\
    \ it is\n      protected for transmission through the SP's network to the other\n\
    \      PE, and finally it is decrypted or checked for integrity and sent\n   \
    \   to the other CE.\n   3) Access link (CE-to-PE) - Apply confidentiality or\
    \ integrity\n      services between the CE and PE on each side or on only one\
    \ side.\n   4) Configurations 2 and 3 above can also be combined, with\n     \
    \ confidentiality or integrity running from CE to PE, then PE to PE,\n      and\
    \ then PE to CE.\n   Among the four feasible configurations, key tradeoffs in\
    \ considering\n   encryption include:\n   -  Vulnerability to link eavesdropping\
    \ or tampering - assuming an\n      attacker can observe or modify data in transit\
    \ on the links, would\n      it be protected by encryption?\n   -  Vulnerability\
    \ to device compromise - assuming an attacker can get\n      access to a device\
    \ (or freely alter its configuration), would the\n      data be protected?\n \
    \  -  Complexity of device configuration and management - given the\n      number\
    \ of sites per VPN customer as Nce and the number of PEs\n      participating\
    \ in a given VPN as Npe, how many device\n      configurations need to be created\
    \ or maintained, and how do those\n      configurations scale?\n   -  Processing\
    \ load on devices - how many cryptographic operations\n      must be performed\
    \ given N packets? - This raises considerations of\n      device capacity and\
    \ perhaps end-to-end delay.\n   -  Ability of the SP to provide enhanced services\
    \ (QoS, firewall,\n      intrusion detection, etc.) - Can the SP inspect the data\
    \ to\n      provide these services?\n   These tradeoffs are discussed for each\
    \ configuration, below:\n   1) Site-to-site (CE-to-CE)\n   Link eavesdropping\
    \ or tampering - protected on all links.  Device\n   compromise - vulnerable to\
    \ CE compromise.\n   Complexity - single administration, responsible for one device\
    \ per\n         site (Nce devices), but overall configuration per VPN scales as\n\
    \         Nce**2.\n         Though the complexity may be reduced: 1) In practice,\
    \ as Nce\n         grows, the number of VPNs falls off from being a full clique;\n\

    \         \"integrity check only\" or \"integrity check plus encryption.\"\n \
    \  Enhanced services - severely limited; typically only Diffserv\n         markings\

    \         If it is per-PE, it scales as Npe**2 for all customer VPNs\n       \
    \  combined.\n   Processing load - on each of the two PEs, each packet is\n  \
    \       cryptographically processed (2P).\n   Enhanced services - full; SP can\
    \ apply any enhancements based on\n         detailed view of traffic.\n   3) Access\
    \ Link (CE-to-PE)\n         Link eavesdropping or tampering - protected on CE-PE\
    \ link;\n         vulnerable on SP's network links.\n   Device compromise - vulnerable\
    \ to CE or PE compromise.\n   Complexity - two administrations (customer and SP)\
    \ with device\n         configuration on each side (Nce + Npe devices to configure),\n\
    \         but because there is no mesh, the overall configuration scales\n   \
    \      as Nce.\n   Processing load - on each of the two CEs, each packet is\n\
    \         cryptographically processed, plus on each of the two PEs, each\n   \
    \      packet is cryptographically processed (4P).\n   Enhanced services - full;\
    \ SP can apply any enhancements based on a\n         detailed view of traffic.\n\
    \   4) Combined Access link and PE-to-PE (essentially hop-by-hop).\n   Link eavesdropping\
    \ or tampering - protected on all links.\n   Device compromise - vulnerable to\
    \ CE or PE compromise.\n   Complexity - two administrations (customer and SP)\
    \ with device\n         configuration on each side (Nce + Npe devices to configure).\n\
    \         Scalability of the overall configuration depends on the PPVPN\n    \
    \     type: If the cryptographic processing is separate per VPN\n         context,\
    \ it scales as Npe**2 per customer VPN.  If it is per-\n         PE, it scales\
    \ as Npe**2 for all customer VPNs combined.\n   Processing load - on each of the\
    \ two CEs, each packet is\n         cryptographically processed, plus on each\
    \ of the two PEs, each\n         packet is cryptographically processed twice (6P).\n\
    \   Enhanced services - full; SP can apply any enhancements based on a\n     \
    \    detailed view of traffic.\n   Given the tradeoffs discussed above, a few\
    \ conclusions can be drawn:\n   -  Configurations 2 and 3 are subsets of 4 that\
    \ may be appropriate\n      alternatives to 4 under certain threat models; the\
    \ remainder of\n      these conclusions compare 1 (CE-to-CE) versus 4 (combined\
    \ access\n      links and PE-to-PE).\n   -  If protection from link eavesdropping\
    \ or tampering is all that is\n      important, then configurations 1 and 4 are\
    \ equivalent.\n   -  If protection from device compromise is most important and\
    \ the\n      threat is to the CE devices, both cases are equivalent; if the\n\
    \      threat is to the PE devices, configuration 1 is better.\n   -  If reducing\
    \ complexity is most important, and the size of the\n      network is small, configuration\
    \ 1 is better.  Otherwise,\n      configuration 4 is better because rather than\
    \ a mesh of CE\n      devices, it requires a smaller mesh of PE devices.  Also,\
    \ under\n      some PPVPN approaches, the scaling of 4 is further improved by\n\
    \      sharing the same PE-PE mesh across all VPN contexts.  The scaling\n   \
    \   advantage of 4 may be increased or decreased in any given\n      situation\
    \ if the CE devices are simpler to configure than the PE\n      devices, or vice-versa.\n\
    \   -  If the overall processing load is a key factor, then 1 is better,\n   \
    \   unless the PEs come with a hardware encryption accelerator and the\n     \
    \ CEs do not.\n   -  If the availability of enhanced services support from the\
    \ SP is\n      most important, then 4 is best.\n   -  If users are concerned with\
    \ having their VPNs misconnected with\n      other users' VPNs, then encryption\
    \ with 1 can provide protection.\n   As a quick overall conclusion, CE-to-CE protection\
    \ is better against\n   device compromise, but this comes at the cost of enhanced\
    \ services\n   and at the cost of operational complexity due to the Order(n**2)\n\
    \   scaling of a larger mesh.\n   This analysis of site-to-site vs. hop-by-hop\
    \ tradeoffs does not\n   explicitly include cases of multiple providers cooperating\
    \ to provide\n   a PPVPN service, public Internet VPN connectivity, or remote\
    \ access\n   VPN service, but many of the tradeoffs are similar.\n   In addition\
    \ to the simplified models, the following should also be\n   considered:\n   -\
    \  There are reasons, perhaps, to protect a specific P-to-P or PE-\n      to-P.\n\
    \   -  There may be reasons to do multiple encryptions over certain\n      segments.\
    \  One may be using an encrypted wireless link under our\n      IPsec VPN to access\
    \ an SSL-secured web site to download encrypted\n      email attachments: four\
    \ layers.)\n   -  It may be appropriate that, for example, cryptographic integrity\n\
    \      checks are applied end to end, and confidentiality is applied over\n  \
    \    a shorter span.\n   -  Different cryptographic protection may be required\
    \ for control\n      protocols and data traffic.\n   -  Attention needs to be\
    \ given to how auxiliary traffic is protected,\n      e.g., the ICMPv6 packets\
    \ that flow back during PMTU discovery,\n      among other examples.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Access Control Techniques
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Access Control Techniques\n   Access control techniques include packet-by-packet\
    \ or packet-flow-\n   by-packet-flow access control by means of filters and firewalls\
    \ on\n   IPv4/IPv6 packets, as well as by means of admitting a \"session\" for\
    \ a\n   control, signaling, or management protocol.  Enforcement of access\n \
    \  control by isolated infrastructure addresses is discussed in Section\n   5.4\
    \ of this document.\n   In this document, we distinguish between filtering and\
    \ firewalls\n   based primarily on the direction of traffic flow.  We define\n\
    \   filtering as being applicable to unidirectional traffic, while a\n   firewall\
    \ can analyze and control both sides of a conversation.\n   The definition has\
    \ two significant corollaries:\n   -  Routing or traffic flow symmetry: A firewall\
    \ typically requires\n      routing symmetry, which is usually enforced by locating\
    \ a firewall\n      where the network topology assures that both sides of a\n\
    \      conversation will pass through the firewall.  A filter can operate\n  \
    \    upon traffic flowing in one direction, without considering traffic\n    \
    \  in the reverse direction.  Beware that this concept could result\n      in\
    \ a single point of failure.\n   -  Statefulness: Because it receives both sides\
    \ of a conversation, a\n      firewall may be able to interpret a significant\
    \ amount of\n      information concerning the state of that conversation and use\
    \ this\n      information to control access.  A filter can maintain some limited\n\
    \      state information on a unidirectional flow of packets, but cannot\n   \
    \   determine the state of the bidirectional conversation as precisely\n     \
    \ as a firewall.\n   For a general description on filtering and rate limiting\
    \ for IP\n   networks, please also see [OPSEC-FILTER].\n"
- title: 5.3.1.  Filtering
  contents:
  - "5.3.1.  Filtering\n   It is relatively common for routers to filter packets.\
    \  That is,\n   routers can look for particular values in certain fields of the\
    \ IP or\n   higher-level (e.g., TCP or UDP) headers.  Packets matching the\n \
    \  criteria associated with a particular filter may either be discarded\n   or\
    \ given special treatment.  Today, not only routers, but most end\n   hosts have\
    \ filters, and every instance of IPsec is also a filter\n   [RFC4301].\n   In\
    \ discussing filters, it is useful to separate the filter\n   characteristics\
    \ that may be used to determine whether a packet\n   matches a filter from the\
    \ packet actions applied to those packets\n   matching a particular filter.\n\
    \   o  Filter Characteristics\n   Filter characteristics or rules are used to\
    \ determine whether a\n   particular packet or set of packets matches a particular\
    \ filter.\n   In many cases, filter characteristics may be stateless.  A stateless\n\
    \   filter determines whether a particular packet matches a filter based\n   solely\
    \ on the filter definition, normal forwarding information (such\n   as the next\
    \ hop for a packet), the interface on which a packet\n   arrived, and the contents\
    \ of that individual packet.  Typically,\n   stateless filters may consider the\
    \ incoming and outgoing logical or\n   physical interface, information in the\
    \ IP header, and information in\n   higher-layer headers such as the TCP or UDP\
    \ header.  Information in\n   the IP header to be considered may for example include\
    \ source and\n   destination IP addresses; Protocol field, Fragment Offset, and\
    \ TOS\n   field in IPv4; or Next Header, Extension Headers, Flow label, etc. in\n\
    \   IPv6.  Filters also may consider fields in the TCP or UDP header such\n  \
    \ as the Port numbers, the SYN field in the TCP header, as well as ICMP\n   and\
    \ ICMPv6 type.\n   Stateful filtering maintains packet-specific state information\
    \ to aid\n   in determining whether a filter rule has been met.  For example,\
    \ a\n   device might apply stateless filtering to the first fragment of a\n  \
    \ fragmented IPv4 packet.  If the filter matches, then the data unit ID\n   may\
    \ be remembered and other fragments of the same packet may then be\n   considered\
    \ to match the same filter.  Stateful filtering is more\n   commonly done in firewalls,\
    \ although firewall technology may be added\n   to routers.  The data unit ID\
    \ can also be a Fragment Extension Header\n   Identification field in IPv6.\n\
    \   o Actions based on Filter Results\n   If a packet, or a series of packets,\
    \ matches a specific filter, then\n   a variety of actions may be taken based\
    \ on that match.  Examples of\n   such actions include:\n      -  Discard\n  \
    \       In many cases, filters are set to catch certain undesirable\n        \
    \ packets.  Examples may include packets with forged or invalid\n         source\
    \ addresses, packets that are part of a DoS or Distributed\n         DoS (DDoS)\
    \ attack, or packets trying to access unallowed\n         resources (such as network\
    \ management packets from an\n         unauthorized source).  Where such filters\
    \ are activated, it is\n         common to discard the packet or set of packets\
    \ matching the\n         filter silently.  The discarded packets may of course\
    \ also be\n         counted or logged.\n      -  Set CoS\n         A filter may\
    \ be used to set the class of service associated\n         with the packet.\n\
    \      -  Count packets or bytes\n      -  Rate Limit\n         In some cases,\
    \ the set of packets matching a particular filter\n         may be limited to\
    \ a specified bandwidth.  In this case, packets\n         or bytes would be counted,\
    \ and would be forwarded normally up\n         to the specified limit.  Excess\
    \ packets may be discarded or may\n         be marked (for example, by setting\
    \ a \"discard eligible\" bit in\n         the IPv4 ToS field, or changing the\
    \ EXP value to identify\n         traffic as being out of contract).\n      -\
    \ Forward and Copy\n         It is useful in some cases to forward some set of\
    \ packets\n         normally, but also to send a copy to a specified other address\n\
    \         or interface.  For example, this may be used to implement a\n      \
    \   lawful intercept capability or to feed selected packets to an\n         Intrusion\
    \ Detection System.\n   o Other Packet Filters Issues\n   Filtering performance\
    \ may vary widely according to implementation and\n   the types and number of\
    \ rules.  Without acceptable performance,\n   filtering is not useful.\n   The\
    \ precise definition of \"acceptable\" may vary from SP to SP, and\n   may depend\
    \ upon the intended use of the filters.  For example, for\n   some uses, a filter\
    \ may be turned on all the time to set CoS, to\n   prevent an attack, or to mitigate\
    \ the effect of a possible future\n   attack.  In this case, it is likely that\
    \ the SP will want the filter\n   to have minimal or no impact on performance.\
    \  In other cases, a\n   filter may be turned on only in response to a major attack\
    \ (such as a\n   major DDoS attack).  In this case, a greater performance impact\
    \ may\n   be acceptable to some service providers.\n   A key consideration with\
    \ the use of packet filters is that they can\n   provide few options for filtering\
    \ packets carrying encrypted data.\n   Because the data itself is not accessible,\
    \ only packet header\n   information or other unencrypted fields can be used for\
    \ filtering.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.3.2.  Firewalls\n   Firewalls provide a mechanism for controlling traffic passing\
    \ between\n   different trusted zones in the MPLS/GMPLS model or between a trusted\n\
    \   zone and an untrusted zone.  Firewalls typically provide much more\n   functionality\
    \ than filters, because they may be able to apply\n   detailed analysis and logical\
    \ functions to flows, and not just to\n   individual packets.  They may offer\
    \ a variety of complex services,\n   such as threshold-driven DoS attack protection,\
    \ virus scanning,\n   acting as a TCP connection proxy, etc.\n   As with other\
    \ access control techniques, the value of firewalls\n   depends on a clear understanding\
    \ of the topologies of the MPLS/GMPLS\n   core network, the user networks, and\
    \ the threat model.  Their\n   effectiveness depends on a topology with a clearly\
    \ defined inside\n   (secure) and outside (not secure).\n   Firewalls may be applied\
    \ to help protect MPLS/GMPLS core network\n   functions from attacks originating\
    \ from the Internet or from\n   MPLS/GMPLS user sites, but typically other defensive\
    \ techniques will\n   be used for this purpose.\n   Where firewalls are employed\
    \ as a service to protect user VPN sites\n   from the Internet, different VPN\
    \ users, and even different sites of a\n   single VPN user, may have varying firewall\
    \ requirements.  The overall\n   PPVPN logical and physical topology, along with\
    \ the capabilities of\n   the devices implementing the firewall services, has\
    \ a significant\n   effect on the feasibility and manageability of such varied\
    \ firewall\n   service offerings.\n   Another consideration with the use of firewalls\
    \ is that they can\n   provide few options for handling packets carrying encrypted\
    \ data.\n   Because the data itself is not accessible, only packet header\n  \
    \ information, other unencrypted fields, or analysis of the flow of\n   encrypted\
    \ packets can be used for making decisions on accepting or\n   rejecting encrypted\
    \ traffic.\n   Two approaches of using firewalls are to move the firewall outside\
    \ of\n   the encrypted part of the path or to register and pre-approve the\n \
    \  encrypted session with the firewall.\n   Handling DoS attacks has become increasingly\
    \ important.  Useful\n   guidelines include the following:\n   1. Perform ingress\
    \ filtering everywhere.\n   2. Be able to filter DoS attack packets at line speed.\n\
    \   3. Do not allow oneself to amplify attacks.\n   4. Continue processing legitimate\
    \ traffic.  Over provide for heavy\n      loads.  Use diverse locations, technologies,\
    \ etc.\n"

- title: 5.4.  Use of Isolated Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Use of Isolated Infrastructure\n   One way to protect the infrastructure\
    \ used for support of MPLS/GMPLS\n   is to separate the resources for support\
    \ of MPLS/GMPLS services from\n   the resources used for other purposes (such\
    \ as support of Internet\n   services).  In some cases, this may involve using\
    \ physically separate\n   equipment for VPN services, or even a physically separate\
    \ network.\n   For example, PE-based IPVPNs may be run on a separate backbone\
    \ not\n   connected to the Internet, or may use separate edge routers from\n \
    \  those supporting Internet service.  Private IPv4 addresses (local to\n   the\
    \ provider and non-routable over the Internet) are sometimes used\n   to provide\
    \ additional separation.  For a discussion of comparable\n   techniques for IPv6,\
    \ see \"Local Network Protection for IPv6,\" RFC\n   4864 [RFC4864].\n   In a\
    \ GMPLS network, it is possible to operate the control plane using\n   physically\

    \ equipment to protect users' data while the\n   control and management traffic\
    \ uses network resources that can be\n   accessed by operators to configure the\

- title: 5.5.  Use of Aggregated Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Use of Aggregated Infrastructure\n   In general, it is not feasible to\
    \ use a completely separate set of\n   resources for support of each service.\
    \  In fact, one of the main\n   reasons for MPLS/GMPLS enabled services is to\
    \ allow sharing of\n   resources between multiple services and multiple users.\
    \  Thus, even\n   if certain services use a separate network from Internet services,\n\
    \   nonetheless there will still be multiple MPLS/GMPLS users sharing the\n  \
    \ same network resources.  In some cases, MPLS/GMPLS services will\n   share network\
    \ resources with Internet services or other services.\n   It is therefore important\
    \ for MPLS/GMPLS services to provide\n   protection between resources used by\
    \ different parties.  Thus, a\n   well-behaved MPLS/GMPLS user should be protected\
    \ from possible\n   misbehavior by other users.  This requires several security\n\
    \   measurements to be implemented.  Resource limits can be placed on a\n   per\
    \ service and per user basis.  Possibilities include, for example,\n   using a\
    \ virtual router or logical router to define hardware or\n   software resource\
    \ limits per service or per individual user; using\n   rate limiting per Virtual\
    \ Routing and Forwarding (VRF) or per\n   Internet connection to provide bandwidth\
    \ protection; or using\n   resource reservation for control-plane traffic.  In\
    \ addition to\n   bandwidth protection, separate resource allocation can be used\
    \ to\n   limit security attacks only to directly impacted service(s) or\n   customer(s).\
    \  Strict, separate, and clearly defined engineering rules\n   and provisioning\
    \ procedures can reduce the risks of network-wide\n   impact of a control-plane\
    \ attack, DoS attack, or misconfiguration.\n   In general, the use of aggregated\
    \ infrastructure allows the service\n   provider to benefit from stochastic multiplexing\
    \ of multiple bursty\n   flows, and also may in some cases thwart traffic pattern\
    \ analysis by\n   combining the data from multiple users.  However, service providers\n\

  - "6.  Monitoring, Detection, and Reporting of Security Attacks\n   MPLS/GMPLS network\
    \ and service may be subject to attacks from a\n   variety of security threats.\
    \  Many threats are described in Section 4\n   of this document.  Many of the\
    \ defensive techniques described in this\n   document and elsewhere provide significant\
    \ levels of protection from\n   a variety of threats.  However, in addition to\
    \ employing defensive\n   techniques silently to protect against attacks, MPLS/GMPLS\
    \ services\n   can also add value for both providers and customers by implementing\n\
    \   security monitoring systems to detect and report on any security\n   attacks,\
    \ regardless of whether the attacks are effective.\n   Attackers often begin by\
    \ probing and analyzing defenses, so systems\n   that can detect and properly\
    \ report these early stages of attacks can\n   provide significant benefits.\n\
    \   Information concerning attack incidents, especially if available\n   quickly,\
    \ can be useful in defending against further attacks.  It can\n   be used to help\
    \ identify attackers or their specific targets at an\n   early stage.  This knowledge\
    \ about attackers and targets can be used\n   to strengthen defenses against specific\
    \ attacks or attackers, or to\n   improve the defenses for specific targets on\
    \ an as-needed basis.\n   Information collected on attacks may also be useful\
    \ in identifying\n   and developing defenses against novel attack types.\n   Monitoring\
    \ systems used to detect security attacks in MPLS/GMPLS\n   typically operate\
    \ by collecting information from the Provider Edge\n   (PE), Customer Edge (CE),\
    \ and/or Provider backbone (P) devices.\n   Security monitoring systems should\
    \ have the ability to actively\n   retrieve information from devices (e.g., SNMP\
    \ get) or to passively\n   receive reports from devices (e.g., SNMP notifications).\
    \  The systems\n   may actively retrieve information from devices (e.g., SNMP\
    \ get) or\n   passively receive reports from devices (e.g., SNMP notifications).\n\
    \   The specific information exchanged depends on the capabilities of the\n  \
    \ devices and on the type of VPN technology.  Particular care should be\n   given\
    \ to securing the communications channel between the monitoring\n   systems and\
    \ the MPLS/GMPLS devices.\n   The CE, PE, and P devices should employ efficient\
    \ methods to acquire\n   and communicate the information needed by the security\
    \ monitoring\n   systems.  It is important that the communication method between\n\
    \   MPLS/GMPLS devices and security monitoring systems be designed so\n   that\
    \ it will not disrupt network operations.  As an example, multiple\n   attack\
    \ events may be reported through a single message, rather than\n   allowing each\
    \ attack event to trigger a separate message, which might\n   result in a flood\
    \ of messages, essentially becoming a DoS attack\n   against the monitoring system\
    \ or the network.\n   The mechanisms for reporting security attacks should be\
    \ flexible\n   enough to meet the needs of MPLS/GMPLS service providers, MPLS/GMPLS\n\
    \   customers, and regulatory agencies, if applicable.  The specific\n   reports\
    \ should depend on the capabilities of the devices, the\n   security monitoring\
    \ system, the type of VPN, and the service level\n   agreements between the provider\
    \ and customer.\n   While SNMP/syslog type monitoring and detection mechanisms\
    \ can detect\n   some attacks (usually resulting from flapping protocol adjacencies,\n\
    \   CPU overload scenarios, etc.), other techniques, such as netflow-\n   based\
    \ traffic fingerprinting, are needed for more detailed detection\n   and reporting.\n\
    \   With netflow-based traffic fingerprinting, each packet that is\n   forwarded\
    \ within a device is examined for a set of IP packet\n   attributes.  These attributes\
    \ are the IP packet identity or\n   fingerprint of the packet and determine if\
    \ the packet is unique or\n   similar to other packets.\n   The flow information\
    \ is extremely useful for understanding network\n   behavior, and detecting and\
    \ reporting security attacks:\n   -  Source address allows the understanding of\
    \ who is originating the\n      traffic.\n   -  Destination address tells who\
    \ is receiving the traffic.\n   -  Ports characterize the application utilizing\
    \ the traffic.\n   -  Class of service examines the priority of the traffic.\n\
    \   -  The device interface tells how traffic is being utilized by the\n     \
    \ network device.\n   -  Tallied packets and bytes show the amount of traffic.\n\
    \   -  Flow timestamps allow the understanding of the life of a flow;\n      timestamps\
    \ are useful for calculating packets and bytes per\n      second.\n   -  Next-hop\
    \ IP addresses including BGP routing Autonomous Systems\n      (ASes).\n   - \
    \ Subnet mask for the source and destination addresses are for\n      calculating\
    \ prefixes.\n   -  TCP flags are useful for examining TCP handshakes.\n"

  - "7.1.1.  Control-Plane Protection - General\n   -  Filtering spoofed infrastructure\
    \ IP addresses at edges\n   Many attacks on protocols running in a core involve\
    \ spoofing a source\n   IP address of a node in the core (e.g., TCP-RST attacks).\
    \  It makes\n   sense to apply anti-spoofing filtering at edges, e.g., using strict\n\
    \   unicast reverse path forwarding (uRPF) [RFC3704] and/or by preventing\n  \
    \ the use of infrastructure addresses as source.  If this is done\n   comprehensively,\
    \ the need to cryptographically secure these protocols\n   is smaller.  See [BACKBONE-ATTKS]\
    \ for more elaborate description.\n   -  Protocol authentication within the core\n\
    \   The network infrastructure must support mechanisms for authentication\n  \
    \ of the control-plane messages.  If an MPLS/GMPLS core is used, LDP\n   sessions\
    \ may be authenticated with TCP MD5.  In addition, IGP and BGP\n   authentication\
    \ should be considered.  For a core providing various\n   IP, VPN, or transport\
    \ services, PE-to-PE authentication may also be\n   performed via IPsec.  See\
    \ the above discussion of protocol security\n   services: authentication, integrity\
    \ (with replay detection), and\n   confidentiality.  Protocols need to provide\
    \ a complete set of\n   security services from which the SP can choose.  Also,\
    \ the important\n   but often more difficult part is key management.  Considerations,\n\
    \   guidelines, and strategies regarding key management are discussed in\n   [RFC3562],\
    \ [RFC4107], [RFC4808].\n   With today's processors, applying cryptographic authentication\
    \ to the\n   control plane may not increase the cost of deployment for providers\n\
    \   significantly, and will help to improve the security of the core.  If\n  \
    \ the core is dedicated to MPLS/GMPLS enabled services without any\n   interconnects\
    \ to third parties, then this may reduce the requirement\n   for authentication\
    \ of the core control plane.\n   -  Infrastructure Hiding\n   Here we discuss\
    \ means to hide the provider's infrastructure nodes.\n   An MPLS/GMPLS provider\
    \ may make its infrastructure routers (P and PE)\n   unreachable from outside\
    \ users and unauthorized internal users.  For\n   example, separate address space\
    \ may be used for the infrastructure\n   loopbacks.\n   Normal TTL propagation\
    \ may be altered to make the backbone look like\n   one hop from the outside,\
    \ but caution needs to be taken for loop\n   prevention.  This prevents the backbone\
    \ addresses from being exposed\n   through trace route; however, this must also\
    \ be assessed against\n   operational requirements for end-to-end fault tracing.\n\
    \   An Internet backbone core may be re-engineered to make Internet\n   routing\
    \ an edge function, for example, by using MPLS label switching\n   for all traffic\
    \ within the core and possibly making the Internet a\n   VPN within the PPVPN\
    \ core itself.  This helps to detach Internet\n   access from PPVPN services.\n\
    \   Separating control-plane, data-plane, and management-plane\n   functionality\
    \ in hardware and software may be implemented on the PE\n   devices to improve\
    \ security.  This may help to limit the problems\n   when attacked in one particular\
    \ area, and may allow each plane to\n   implement additional security measures\
    \ separately.\n   PEs are often more vulnerable to attack than P routers, because\
    \ PEs\n   cannot be made unreachable from outside users by their very nature.\n\
    \   Access to core trunk resources can be controlled on a per-user basis\n   by\
    \ using of inbound rate limiting or traffic shaping; this can be\n   further enhanced\
    \ on a per-class-of-service basis (see Section 8.2.3)\n   In the PE, using separate\
    \ routing processes for different services,\n   for example, Internet and PPVPN\
    \ service, may help to improve the\n   PPVPN security and better protect VPN customers.\
    \  Furthermore, if\n   resources, such as CPU and memory, can be further separated\
    \ based on\n   applications, or even individual VPNs, it may help to provide\n\
    \   improved security and reliability to individual VPN customers.\n"

  - "7.1.2.  Control-Plane Protection with RSVP-TE\n   -  General RSVP Security Tools\n\
    \   Isolation of the trusted domain is an important security mechanism\n   for\
    \ RSVP, to ensure that an untrusted element cannot access a router\n   of the\
    \ trusted domain.  However, ASBR-ASBR communication for inter-AS\n   LSPs needs\
    \ to be secured specifically.  Isolation mechanisms might\n   also be bypassed\
    \ by an IPv4 Router Alert or IPv6 using Next Header 0\n   packets.  A solution\
    \ could consist of disabling the processing of IP\n   options.  This drops or\
    \ ignores all IP packets with IPv4 options,\n   including the router alert option\
    \ used by RSVP; however, this may\n   have an impact on other protocols using\
    \ IPv4 options.  An alternative\n   is to configure access-lists on all incoming\
    \ interfaces dropping IPv4\n   protocol or IPv6 next header 46 (RSVP).\n   RSVP\
    \ security can be strengthened by deactivating RSVP on interfaces\n   with neighbors\
    \ who are not authorized to use RSVP, to protect against\n   adjacent CE-PE attacks.\
    \  However, this does not really protect\n   against DoS attacks or attacks on\
    \ non-adjacent routers.  It has been\n   demonstrated that substantial CPU resources\
    \ are consumed simply by\n   processing received RSVP packets, even if the RSVP\
    \ process is\n   deactivated for the specific interface on which the RSVP packets\
    \ are\n   received.\n   RSVP neighbor filtering at the protocol level, to restrict\
    \ the set of\n   neighbors that can send RSVP messages to a given router, protects\n\
    \   against non-adjacent attacks.  However, this does not protect against\n  \
    \ DoS attacks and does not effectively protect against spoofing of the\n   source\
    \ address of RSVP packets, if the filter relies on the\n   neighbor's address\
    \ within the RSVP message.\n   RSVP neighbor filtering at the data-plane level,\
    \ with an access list\n   to accept IP packets with port 46 only for specific\
    \ neighbors,\n   requires Router Alert mode to be deactivated and does not protect\n\
    \   against spoofing.\n   Another valuable tool is RSVP message pacing, to limit\
    \ the number of\n   RSVP messages sent to a given neighbor during a given period.\
    \  This\n   allows blocking DoS attack propagation.\n   -  Another approach is\
    \ to limit the impact of an attack on control-\n      plane resources.\n   To\
    \ ensure continued effective operation of the MPLS router even in\n   the case\
    \ of an attack that bypasses packet filtering mechanisms such\n   as Access Control\
    \ Lists in the data plane, it is important that\n   routers have some mechanisms\
    \ to limit the impact of the attack.\n   There should be a mechanism to rate limit\
    \ the amount of control-plane\n   traffic addressed to the router, per interface.\
    \  This should be\n   configurable on a per-protocol basis, (and, ideally, on\
    \ a per-sender\n   basis) to avoid letting an attacked protocol or a given sender\
    \ block\n   all communications.  This requires the ability to filter and limit\n\
    \   the rate of incoming messages of particular protocols, such as RSVP\n   (filtering\
    \ at the IP protocol level), and particular senders.  In\n   addition, there should\
    \ be a mechanism to limit CPU and memory\n   capacity allocated to RSVP, so as\
    \ to protect other control-plane\n   elements.  To limit memory allocation, it\
    \ will probably be necessary\n   to limit the number of LSPs that can be set up.\n\
    \   -  Authentication for RSVP messages\n   RSVP message authentication is described\
    \ in RFC 2747 [RFC2747] and\n   RFC 3097 [RFC3097].  It is one of the most powerful\
    \ tools for\n   protection against RSVP-based attacks.  It applies cryptographic\n\
    \   authentication to RSVP messages based on a secure message hash using\n   a\
    \ key shared by RSVP neighbors.  This protects against LSP creation\n   attacks,\
    \ at the expense of consuming significant CPU resources for\n   digest computation.\
    \  In addition, if the neighboring RSVP speaker is\n   compromised, it could be\
    \ used to launch attacks using authenticated\n   RSVP messages.  These methods,\
    \ and certain other aspects of RSVP\n   security, are explained in detail in RFC\
    \ 4230 [RFC4230].  Key\n   management must be implemented.  Logging and auditing\
    \ as well as\n   multiple layers of cryptographic protection can help here.  IPsec\
    \ can\n   also be used in some cases (see [RFC4230]).\n   One challenge using\
    \ RSVP message authentication arises in many cases\n   where non-RSVP nodes are\
    \ present in the network.  In such cases, the\n   RSVP neighbor may not be known\
    \ up front, thus neighbor-based keying\n   approaches fail, unless the same key\
    \ is used everywhere, which is not\n   recommended for security reasons.  Group\
    \ keying may help in such\n   cases.  The security properties of various keying\
    \ approaches are\n   discussed in detail in [RSVP-key].\n"
