  - "Abstract\n   The Certificate (CERT) parameter is a container for digital\n  \
    \ certificates.  It is used for carrying these certificates in Host\n   Identity\
    \ Protocol (HIP) control packets.  This document specifies the\n   CERT parameter\
    \ and the error signaling in case of a failed\n   verification.  Additionally,\
    \ this document specifies the\n   representations of Host Identity Tags in X.509\
    \ version 3 (v3) and\n   Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) certificates.\n\
    \   The concrete use of certificates, including how certificates are\n   obtained,\
    \ requested, and which actions are taken upon successful or\n   failed verification,\
    \ is specific to the scenario in which the\n   certificates are used.  Hence,\
    \ the definition of these scenario-\n   specific aspects is left to the documents\
    \ that use the CERT\n   parameter.\n   This document updates RFC 5201.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Digital certificates bind pieces of information to a public\
    \ key by\n   means of a digital signature and thus enable the holder of a private\n\
    \   key to generate cryptographically verifiable statements.  The Host\n   Identity\
    \ Protocol (HIP) [RFC5201] defines a new cryptographic\n   namespace based on\
    \ asymmetric cryptography.  The identity of each\n   host is derived from a public\
    \ key, allowing hosts to digitally sign\n   data and issue certificates with their\
    \ private key.  This document\n   specifies the CERT parameter, which is used\
    \ to transmit digital\n   certificates in HIP.  It fills the placeholder specified\
    \ in\n   Section 5.2 of [RFC5201] and thus updates [RFC5201].\n"

- title: 2.  CERT Parameter
  contents:
  - "2.  CERT Parameter\n   The CERT parameter is a container for certain types of\
    \ digital\n   certificates.  It does not specify any certificate semantics.\n\
    \   However, it defines supplementary parameters that help HIP hosts to\n   transmit\
    \ semantically grouped CERT parameters in a more systematic\n   way.  The specific\
    \ use of the CERT parameter for different use cases\n   is intentionally not discussed\
    \ in this document, because it is\n   specific to a concrete use case.  Hence,\
    \ the use of the CERT\n   parameter will be defined in the documents that use\
    \ the CERT\n   parameter.\n   The CERT parameter is covered and protected, when\
    \ present, by the HIP\n   SIGNATURE field and is a non-critical parameter.\n \
    \  The CERT parameter can be used in all HIP packets.  However, using it\n   in\
    \ the first Initiator (I1) packet is NOT RECOMMENDED, because it can\n   increase\
    \ the processing times of I1s, which can be problematic when\n   processing storms\
    \ of I1s.  Each HIP control packet MAY contain\n   multiple CERT parameters. \
    \ These parameters MAY be related or\n   unrelated.  Related certificates are\
    \ managed in Cert groups.  A Cert\n   group specifies a group of related CERT\
    \ parameters that SHOULD be\n   interpreted in a certain order (e.g., for expressing\
    \ certificate\n   chains).  For grouping CERT parameters, the Cert group and the\
    \ Cert\n   count field MUST be set.  Ungrouped certificates exhibit a unique\n\
    \   Cert group field and set the Cert count to 1.  CERT parameters with\n   the\
    \ same Cert group number in the group field indicate a logical\n   grouping. \
    \ The Cert count field indicates the number of CERT\n   parameters in the group.\n\
    \   CERT parameters that belong to the same Cert group MAY be contained\n   in\
    \ multiple sequential HIP control packets.  This is indicated by a\n   higher\
    \ Cert count than the amount of CERT parameters with matching\n   Cert group fields\
    \ in a HIP control packet.  The CERT parameters MUST\n   be placed in ascending\
    \ order, within a HIP control packet, according\n   to their Cert group field.\
    \  Cert groups MAY only span multiple\n   packets if the Cert group does not fit\
    \ the packet.  A HIP packet MUST\n   NOT contain more than one incomplete Cert\
    \ group that continues in the\n   next HIP control packet.\n   The Cert ID acts\
    \ as a sequence number to identify the certificates in\n   a Cert group.  The\
    \ numbers in the Cert ID field MUST start from 1 up\n   to Cert count.\n   The\
    \ Cert group and Cert ID namespaces are managed locally by each\n   host that\
    \ sends CERT parameters in HIP control packets.\n     0                   1  \

    \   The next sections outline the use of Host Identity Tags (HITs) in\n   X.509\
    \ v3 and in Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) certificates.\n   X.509 v3\
    \ certificates and the handling procedures are defined in\n   [RFC5280].  The\
    \ wire format for X.509 v3 is the Distinguished\n   Encoding Rules format as defined\
    \ in [X.690].  The SPKI, the handling\n   procedures, and the formats are defined\
    \ in [RFC2693].\n   Hash and Uniform Resource Locator (URL) encodings (3 and 4)\
    \ are used\n   as defined in Section 3.6 of [RFC5996].  Using hash and URL encodings\n\
    \   results in smaller HIP control packets than by including the\n   certificate(s),\
    \ but requires the receiver to resolve the URL or check\n   a local cache against\
    \ the hash.\n   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) URL encodings (5\
    \ and 6)\n   are used as defined in [RFC4516].  Using LDAP URL encoding results\
    \ in\n   smaller HIP control packets but requires the receiver to retrieve the\n\
    \   certificate or check a local cache against the URL.\n   Distinguished Name\
    \ (DN) encodings (7 and 8) are represented by the\n   string representation of\
    \ the certificate's subject DN as defined in\n   [RFC4514].  Using the DN encoding\
    \ results in smaller HIP control\n   packets, but requires the receiver to retrieve\
    \ the certificate or\n   check a local cache against the DN.\n"
- title: 3.  X.509 v3 Certificate Object and Host Identities
  contents:
  - "3.  X.509 v3 Certificate Object and Host Identities\n   If needed, HITs can represent\
    \ an issuer, a subject, or both in\n   X.509 v3.  HITs are represented as IPv6\
    \ addresses as defined in\n   [RFC4843].  When the Host Identifier (HI) is used\
    \ to sign the\n   certificate, the respective HIT MUST be placed into the Issuer\n\
    \   Alternative Name (IAN) extension using the GeneralName form iPAddress\n  \
    \ as defined in [RFC5280].  When the certificate is issued for a HIP\n   host,\
    \ identified by a HIT and HI, the respective HIT MUST be placed\n   into the Subject\
    \ Alternative Name (SAN) extension using the\n   GeneralName form iPAddress, and\
    \ the full HI is presented as the\n   subject's public key info as defined in\
    \ [RFC5280].\n   The following examples illustrate how HITs are presented as issuer\n\
    \   and subject in the X.509 v3 extension alternative names.\n       Format of\

    \   Appendix B shows a full example of an X.509 v3 certificate with HIP\n   content.\n\
    \   As another example, consider a managed Public Key Infrastructure\n   (PKI)\
    \ environment in which the peers have certificates that are\n   anchored in (potentially\
    \ different) managed trust chains.  In this\n   scenario, the certificates issued\
    \ to HIP hosts are signed by\n   intermediate Certification Authorities (CAs)\
    \ up to a root CA.  In\n   this example, the managed PKI environment is neither\
    \ HIP aware, nor\n   can it be configured to compute HITs and include them in\
    \ the\n   certificates.\n   When HIP communications are established, the HIP hosts\
    \ not only need\n   to send their identity certificates (or pointers to their\n\
    \   certificates), but also the chain of intermediate CAs (or pointers to\n  \
    \ the CAs) up to the root CA, or to a CA that is trusted by the remote\n   peer.\
    \  This chain of certificates MUST be sent in a Cert group as\n   specified in\
    \ Section 2.  The HIP peers validate each other's\n   certificates and compute\
    \ peer HITs based on the certificate public\n   keys.\n"
- title: 4.  SPKI Cert Object and Host Identities
  contents:
  - "4.  SPKI Cert Object and Host Identities\n   When using SPKI certificates to\
    \ transmit information related to HIP\n   hosts, HITs need to be enclosed within\

    \ the following, we define\n   the representation of those identifiers for SPKI\
    \ given as\n   S-expressions.  Note that the S-expressions are only the human-\n\
    \   readable representation of SPKI certificates.  Full HIs are presented\n  \

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Certificate grouping allows the certificates\

    \ in the\n   wrong order and skipping some fragments to delay or stall packet\n\
    \   processing by the victim in order to use resources (e.g., CPU or\n   memory).\
    \  Hence, hosts SHOULD implement mechanisms to discard\n   certificate groups\
    \ with outstanding certificates if state space is\n   scarce.\n   Checking of\
    \ the URL and LDAP entries might allow denial-of-service\n   (DoS) attacks, where\
    \ the target host may be subjected to bogus work.\n   Security considerations\
