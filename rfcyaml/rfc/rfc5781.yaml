- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   URIs were previously defined in RFC 2396, which was obsoleted\
    \ by RFC\n   3986 [RFC3986].  The procedures for registering new URI schemes are\n\
    \   defined in RFC 4395 [RFC4395].  The rsync utility provides fast\n   incremental\
    \ file transfer [rsync].  This document defines a URI\n   scheme for rsync.\n"
- title: 2.  rsync URI registration
  contents:
  - "2.  rsync URI registration\n   This section contains the registration template\
    \ for the rsync URI\n   scheme in accordance with RFC 4395 [RFC4395].  This URI\
    \ scheme is for\n   the rsync protocol using TCP as the transport protocol.  Other\n\
    \   transports, such as rsync over SSH, are not supported by this URI\n   scheme.\n\
    \   URI scheme name: rsync\n   Status: provisional\n   URI scheme syntax: An rsync\
    \ URI describes a source or destination for\n   the rsync application including\
    \ a hostname, path, and optional user\n   and port.  The generic form of the rsync\
    \ URI is:\n   rsync://[user@]host[:PORT]/Source\n   The rsync URI follows the\
    \ general syntax from RFC 3986 and is defined\n   by the following ABNF [RFC5234]:\n\
    \      rsyncuri        = \"rsync:\" hier-part\n                        ; See RFC\
    \ 3986 for the definition\n                        ; of hier-part\n   URI scheme\
    \ semantics: An rsync URI may be used as either a source or\n   destination for\
    \ the rsync application.  If the port is not specified,\n   it defaults to 873.\n\
    \   Encoding considerations: Since the rsync URI is defined using\n   standard\
    \ elements from RFC 3986, no special encoding considerations\n   are present.\n\
    \   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name: The only\n   application\
    \ that uses rsync URIs is rsync.\n   Interoperability considerations: Since only\
    \ one application is\n   expected to make use of rsync URIs, this URI scheme is\
    \ expected to\n   have few interoperability concerns.\n   Security considerations:\
    \ Section 7 of RFC 3986 describes general\n   security considerations for URI\
    \ schemes.  The considerations about\n   reliability and consistency, malicious\
    \ construction, rare IP address\n   formats, sensitive information, and semantic\
    \ attacks all apply to\n   rsync URIs.  The considerations about transcoding do\
    \ not apply.\n   Given how rsync is regularly used, it is expected that most\n\
    \   applications will not be bothered by data accessed via a given rsync\n   URI\
    \ changing over time.\n   Contact: Russ Housley <housley@vigilsec.com>\n   Author/Change\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Many security considerations for the usage of\
    \ URIs are discussed in\n   Section 7 of [RFC3986].  The considerations about\
    \ reliability and\n   consistency, malicious construction, rare IP address formats,\n\
    \   sensitive information, and semantic attacks all apply to rsync URIs.\n   The\
    \ considerations about transcoding do not apply.  The rsync URI\n   scheme has\
    \ no particularly unique security considerations.\n   The security considerations\
    \ of the rsync protocol are not covered in\n   this document.\n"
