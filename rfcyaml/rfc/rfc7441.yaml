  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many service providers (SPs) offer BGP/MPLS IP VPN service
    to their\n   customers.  When a customer has IP multicast traffic in its VPN,
    the\n   service provider needs to signal the customer multicast states across\n
    \  the backbone.  A customer with IP multicast traffic is typically\n   using
    PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) [PIM] and/or IGMP\n   (Internet Group Management
    Protocol) [IGMP] as the multicast control\n   protocol in its VPN.  The IP multicast
    states of these protocols are\n   commonly denoted as \"(S,G)\" and/or \"(*,G)\"
    states, where \"S\" is a\n   multicast source address and \"G\" is a multicast
    group address.\n   [MVPN-BGP] specifies the way an SP may use BGP to signal a
    customer's\n   IP multicast states across the SP backbone.  This is done by using\n
    \  Multiprotocol BGP Updates whose Subsequent Address Family Identifier\n   (SAFI)
    values contain the codepoint for MCAST-VPN (as defined in\n   [MVPN-BGP]).  The
    NLRI (Network Layer Reachability Information) field\n   of these BGP Updates includes
    a customer Multicast Source field and a\n   customer Multicast Group field, thus
    enabling the customer's (S,G) or\n   (*,G) states to be encoded in the NLRI.\n
    \  It is also desirable for the BGP/MPLS IP VPN service to be able to\n   support
    customers who are using MPLS multicast, either instead of or\n   in addition to
    IP multicast.  This document specifies the procedures\n   and protocol extensions
    needed to support customers who use mLDP\n   [mLDP] to create and maintain Point-to-Multipoint
    (P2MP) and/or\n   Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).
    \ While\n   mLDP is not the only protocol that can be used to create and maintain\n
    \  multipoint LSPs, consideration of other MPLS multicast control\n   protocols
    is outside the scope of this document.\n   When a customer is using mLDP in its
    VPN, the customer multicast\n   states associated with mLDP are denoted by an
    mLDP FEC Element\n   (Forwarding Equivalence Class Element; see [mLDP]) instead
    of by an\n   (S,G) or (*,G).  Thus, it is necessary to have a way to encode a\n
    \  customer's mLDP FEC Elements in the NLRI field of the BGP MCAST-VPN\n   routes.\n
    \  While [MVPN-BGP] does specify a way of encoding an mLDP FEC Element\n   in
    the MCAST-VPN NLRI field, the encoding specified therein makes a\n   variety of
    restrictive assumptions about the customer's use of mLDP.\n   (These assumptions
    are described in Section 2 of this document.)  The\n   purpose of this document
    is to update RFC 6514 [MVPN-BGP] so that\n   customers using mLDP in their VPNs
    can be supported even when those\n   assumptions do not hold.\n   Some SPs use
    the MVPN procedures to provide \"global table multicast\"\n   service (i.e., multicast
    service that is not in the context of a VPN)\n   to customers.  Methods for doing
    this are specified in [GTM] and in\n   [SEAMLESS-MCAST].  The procedures described
    in this document can be\n   used along with the procedures of [GTM] or [SEAMLESS-MCAST]
    to\n   provide global table multicast service to customers that use MPLS\n   multicast
    in a global table context.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Why This Document Is Needed\n   An mLDP FEC Element consists of a FEC Type,
    a Root Node, and an\n   Opaque Value.  mLDP uses several FEC Types and, in particular,
    uses\n   the FEC Type to distinguish between P2MP LSPs and MP2MP LSPs.\n   Section
    11.1.2 of [MVPN-BGP] (\"Originating Routes: mLDP as the\n   C-Multicast Protocol\")
    states:\n      Whenever a PE [Provider Edge router] receives, from one of its
    CEs\n      [Customer Edge routers], a P2MP Label Map <X, Y, L> over interface\n
    \     I, where X is the Root Node Address, Y is the Opaque Value, and L\n      is
    an MPLS label ... the PE constructs a Source Tree Join\n      C-multicast route
    whose MCAST-VPN NLRI contains X as the Multicast\n      Source field, and Y as
    the Multicast Group field.\n   In other words, the Root Node of the mLDP FEC Element
    appears in the\n   Multicast Source field, and the Opaque Value of the mLDP FEC
    Element\n   appears in the Multicast Group field.\n   This method of encoding
    an mLDP FEC in an MCAST-VPN NLRI can only be\n   used if all of the following
    conditions hold:\n   1.  A customer using mLDP is not also using PIM/IGMP.\n       The
    encoding in [MVPN-BGP] does not specify any way in which one\n       can determine,
    upon receiving a BGP Update, whether the Multicast\n       Group field contains
    an IP address or whether it contains an mLDP\n       FEC Element Opaque Value.
    \ Therefore, it might not uniquely\n       identify a customer multicast state
    if the customer is using both\n       PIM/IGMP and mLDP in its VPN.\n   2.  A
    customer using mLDP is using only the mLDP P2MP FEC Element and\n       is not
    using the mLDP MP2MP FEC Element.\n       The encoding in [MVPN-BGP] does not
    specify any way to encode the\n       type of the mLDP FEC Element; it just assumes
    it to be a P2MP FEC\n       Element.\n   3.  A customer using mLDP is using only
    an mLDP Opaque Value type for\n       which the Opaque Value is exactly 32 bits
    or 128 bits long.\n       The use of Multicast Group fields that have other lengths
    is\n       declared by [MVPN-BGP] to be \"out of scope\" of that document\n       (see,
    e.g., Section 4.3 of that document).\n       This condition holds if the customer
    uses only the mLDP \"Generic\n       LSP Identifier\" Opaque Value type (defined
    in [mLDP]).  However,\n       mLDP supports many other Opaque Value types whose
    length is not\n       restricted to be 32 or 128 bits.\n   The purpose of this
    document is to update [MVPN-BGP] so that\n   customers using mLDP can be supported,
    even when these conditions do\n   not hold.\n"
  title: 2.  Why This Document Is Needed
- contents:
  - "3.  Encoding an mLDP FEC in the MCAST-VPN NLRI\n   When mLDP is used as the customer
    multicast control protocol,\n   [MVPN-BGP] presupposes that an mLDP FEC Element
    will be encoded in\n   the NLRI of the following three MCAST-VPN route types:\n
    \  -  C-multicast Source Tree Join route,\n   -  S-PMSI A-D route, and\n   -  Leaf
    A-D route.\n   The other four MCAST-VPN route types defined in [MVPN-BGP] do not\n
    \  ever need to carry mLDP FEC Elements.  The C-multicast Shared Tree\n   Join
    route and the Source Active A-D route are used to communicate\n   state about
    unidirectional shared trees; since mLDP does not have\n   unidirectional shared
    trees, these routes are not used to signal mLDP\n   states.  The Intra-AS I-PMSI
    A-D route and the Inter-AS I-PMSI A-D\n   route do not identify specific customer
    multicast states and hence do\n   not carry any information that is specific to
    the customer's\n   multicast control protocol.\n   This document defines three
    new route types:\n   -  C-Multicast Source Tree Join route for C-multicast mLDP,\n
    \  -  S-PMSI A-D route for C-multicast mLDP, and\n   -  Leaf A-D route for C-multicast
    mLDP.\n   The term \"C-multicast mLDP\" in the names of these route types is\n
    \  intended to indicate that the NLRI of these routes contains mLDP FEC\n   Elements.\n
    \  Each of these route types corresponds to a route type defined in\n   [MVPN-BGP].
    \ IANA has been requested to allocate codepoints for these\n   three route types
    such that (a) the high-order two bits have the\n   value 0x01, and (b) the low-order
    six bits have the same value as the\n   codepoints for the corresponding route
    types from [MVPN-BGP].\n   In general, the procedures defined in other MVPN specifications
    for\n   the C-Multicast Source Tree Join route, the S-PMSI A-D route, and the\n
    \  Leaf A-D route also apply to the C-Multicast Source Tree Join route\n   for
    C-multicast mLDP, the S-PMSI A-D route for C-multicast mLDP, and\n   the Leaf
    A-D route for C-multicast mLDP, respectively.  However, the\n   NLRI of these
    three new route types is constructed differently than\n   the NLRI of the corresponding
    routes from [MVPN-BGP]: the Multicast\n   Source Length, Multicast Source, Multicast
    Group Length, and\n   Multicast Group fields are omitted, and in their place is
    a single\n   mLDP FEC Element, as defined in [mLDP].  (See Section 2.2 of [mLDP]\n
    \  for a diagram of the mLDP FEC Element.)\n   As a result, the NLRI of an S-PMSI
    A-D route for C-multicast mLDP\n   will consist of a Route Distinguisher, followed
    by the mLDP FEC,\n   followed by the Originating Router's IP Address field.\n
    \  The NLRI of a C-multicast Source Tree Join route for C-multicast mLDP\n   will
    consist of a Route Distinguisher, followed by the Source AS,\n   followed by the
    mLDP FEC.\n   In a Leaf A-D route for C-multicast mLDP that has been derived from\n
    \  an S-PMSI A-D route for C-multicast mLDP, the Route Key field remains\n   the
    NLRI of the S-PMSI A-D route from which it was derived.\n   In a Leaf A-D route
    for C-multicast mLDP that has not been derived\n   from an S-PMSI A-D, the Route
    Key field is as specified in\n   [SEAMLESS-MCAST], except that the Multicast Source
    Length, Multicast\n   Source, Multicast Group Length, and Multicast Group fields
    are\n   omitted, and in their place is a single mLDP FEC Element.  Thus, the\n
    \  Route Key field consists of a Route Distinguisher, an mLDP FEC\n   Element,
    and the IP address of the Ingress PE router.\n   Please note that [BGP-ERR], Section
    5.4 (\"Typed NLRI\") is applicable\n   if the Route Type field of the NLRI of
    a received MCAST-VPN route\n   contains an unrecognized value.  Any such routes
    will be discarded.\n   An mLDP FEC Element contains an address family field whose
    value is\n   from IANA's \"Address Family Numbers\" registry.  The value of the\n
    \  address family field identifies the address family of the Root Node\n   Address
    field of the FEC Element.  When an mLDP FEC Element is\n   encoded into the NLRI
    of a BGP Update whose SAFI is MCAST-VPN, the\n   address family of the Root Node
    Address (as indicated in the FEC\n   Element) MUST correspond to the address family
    that is identified in\n   the Address Family Identifier (AFI) field of that BGP
    Update.  These\n   two address family fields are considered to correspond to each
    other\n   under the following conditions:\n   -  they contain identical values,\n
    \  -  the BGP Update's AFI field identifies IPv4 as the address family,\n      and
    the mLDP FEC Element identifies \"Multi-Topology IPv4\" as the\n      address
    family of the Root Node, or\n   -  the BGP Update's AFI field identifies IPv6
    as the address family,\n      and the mLDP FEC Element identifies \"Multi-Topology
    IPv6\" as the\n      address family of the Root Node.\n   For more information
    about the \"multi-topology\" address families, see\n   [LDP-MT] and [mLDP-MT].\n"

  - "4.  Wildcards\n   [MVPN-WILDCARDS] specifies encodings and procedures that allow\n
    \  \"wildcards\" to be specified in the NLRI of S-PMSI A-D routes.  A set\n   of
    rules are given that specify when a customer multicast flow\n   \"matches\" a
    given S-PMSI A-D route whose NLRI contains wildcards.\n   However, the use of
    these wildcards is defined only for the case\n   where the customer is using PIM
    as its multicast control protocol.\n   The use of wildcards when the customer
    is using mLDP as its multicast\n   control protocol is outside the scope of this
    document.\n"
  title: 4.  Wildcards
- contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   [MVPN-BGP] does not create a registry for the allocation
    of new\n   MCAST-VPN Route Type values.  In retrospect, it seems that it should\n
    \  have done so.  IANA has created a new registry called \"BGP MCAST-VPN\n   Route
    Types\", which references this document and [MVPN-BGP].  The\n   registry has
    been created under the top-level registry: \"Border\n   Gateway Protocol (BGP)
    Parameters\"\n   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-parameters>.  The allocation\n
    \  policy is \"Standards Action\".  Values may be assigned from one of\n   several
    ranges:\n   -  Range 0x01-0x3f: Generic/PIM Range.  Values are assigned from this\n
    \     range when the NLRI format associated with the route type\n      presupposes
    that PIM or IGMP is the C-multicast control protocol\n      or when the NLRI format
    associated with the route type is\n      independent of the C-multicast control
    protocol.\n   -  Range 0x43-0x7f: mLDP Range.  Values are assigned from this range\n
    \     when the NLRI format associated with the route type presupposes\n      that
    mLDP is the C-multicast control protocol.\n   -  Range 0x80-0xff: This range is
    reserved; values should not be\n      assigned from this range.\n   In general,
    whenever an assignment is requested from this registry,\n   two codepoints should
    be requested at the same time: one from the\n   Generic/PIM range and one from
    the mLDP range.  The two codepoints\n   should have the same low-order 6 bits.
    \ If one of the two codepoints\n   is not actually needed, it should be registered
    anyway and marked as\n   \"Reserved\".\n   The \"BGP MCAST-VPN Route Types\" contains
