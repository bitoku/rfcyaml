    \ lose.\n   IAC DO RANDOMLY-LOSE\n      The sender  of this command  REQUESTS\
    \ that the receiver, or grants\n      the receiver permission to, randomly lose.\n\
    \   IAC DON'T RANDOMLY-LOSE\n      The command sender DEMANDS that the receiver\

    \ lossage will not happen.\n"
- title: 4.  Motivation for the option.
  contents:
  - "4.  Motivation for the option.\n   Several  hosts appear  to provide  random\
    \  lossage,  such  as  system\n   crashes,  lost data,  incorrectly functioning\
    \ programs, etc., as part\n   of their services.   These services are often undocumented\
    \ and are in\n   general  quite confusing  to the novice  user.   A general  means\
    \  is\n   needed to allow the user to disable these features.\n"

- title: 5.  Description of the option.
  contents:
  - "5.  Description of the option.\n   The normal  mode does not allow random  lossage;\
    \ therefore the system\n   is not allowed  to crash,  mung user files, etc.  If\
    \ the server wants\n   to provide  random lossage, it must first ask for permission\
    \ from the\n   user by sending IAC WILL RANDOMLY-LOSE.\n   If the user wants \
    \ to permit  the server  to randomly lose, it replys\n   with  IAC  DO   RANDOMLY-LOSE.\
    \    Otherwise   it   sends   IAC   DONT\n   RANDOMLY-LOSE, and the server is\
    \ forbidden from randomly losing.\n   Alternatively, the user could request the\
    \ server to randomly lose, by\n   sending  IAC DO RANDOMLY-LOSE,  and the server\
    \ will either reply with\n   IAC WILL RANDOMLY-LOSE,  meaning that it will then\
    \ proceed to do some\n   random  lossage  (garbaging  disk files is recommended\
    \ for an initial\n   implementation).   Or,  it could send IAC WONT RANDOMLY-LOSE,\
    \ meaning\n   that it insists upon being reliable.\n   Since  this is implemented\
    \  as a TELNET  option,  it is expected that\n   servers  which do not implement\
    \  this option  will not randomly lose;\n   ie, they will provide 100% reliable\
    \ uptime.\n"
