- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The IETF Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) working group\
    \ has\n   defined many encapsulations of various layer 1 and layer 2 service-\n\
    \   specific PDUs and circuit data.  In most of these encapsulations, use\n  \
    \ of the Pseudowire (PW) Control Word is required.  However, there are\n   several\
    \ encapsulations for which the Control Word is optional, and\n   this optionality\
    \ has been seen in practice to possibly introduce\n   interoperability concerns\
    \ between multiple implementations of those\n   encapsulations.  This survey of\
    \ the Pseudowire / Virtual Circuit\n   Connectivity Verification (VCCV) user community\
    \ was conducted to\n   determine implementation trends and the possibility of\
    \ always\n   mandating the Control Word.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations\
    \ mandate\n   the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential\
    \ to\n   the emulation, to inhibit Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) behavior, and\n\
    \   to discriminate Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)\n   from\
    \ Pseudowire (PW) packets.  However, some encapsulations treat the\n   Control\
    \ Word as optional.  As a result, implementations of the CW,\n   for encapsulations\
    \ for which it is optional, vary by equipment\n   manufacturer, equipment model,\
    \ and service provider network.\n   Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification\
    \ (VCCV) supports\n   three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity\n\
    \   Verification (CV) types.  This flexibility has led to reports of\n   interoperability\
    \ issues within deployed networks and associated\n   documents to attempt to remedy\
    \ the situation.\n   The encapsulations and modes for which the Control Word is\
    \ currently\n   optional are:\n   o  Ethernet Tagged Mode [RFC4448]\n   o  Ethernet\
    \ Raw Mode [RFC4448]\n   o  Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC4618]\n   o  High-Level\
    \ Data Link Control (HDLC) [RFC4618]\n   o  Frame Relay Port Mode [RFC4618]\n\
    \   o  ATM (N:1 Cell Mode) [RFC4717]\n   Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification\
    \ (VCCV) [RFC5085] defines\n   three Control Channel types for MPLS PWs: Type\
    \ 1, using the PW\n   Control Word; Type 2, using the Router Alert (RA) Label;\
    \ and Type 3,\n   using Time to Live (TTL) Expiration (e.g., MPLS PW Label with\
    \ TTL ==\n   1).  While Type 2 (RA Label) is indicated as being \"the preferred\n\
    \   mode of VCCV operation when the Control Word is not present\", RFC\n   5085\
    \ does not indicate a mandatory Control Channel to ensure\n   interoperable implementations.\
    \  The closest it comes to mandating a\n   control channel is the requirement\
    \ to support Type 1 (Control Word)\n   whenever the CW is present.  As such, the\
    \ three options yield seven\n   implementation permutations (assuming you have\
    \ to support at least\n   one Control Channel type to provide VCCV).  Due to these\n\
    \   permutations, interoperability challenges have been identified by\n   several\
    \ VCCV users.\n   In order to assess the best approach to address the observed\n\
    \   interoperability issues, the PWE3 working group decided to solicit\n   feedback\
    \ from the PW and VCCV user community regarding\n   implementation.  This document\
    \ presents the survey questionnaire and\n   the information returned by those\
    \ in the user community who\n   participated.\n"
- title: 1.1.  PW/VCCV Survey Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  PW/VCCV Survey Overview\n   Per the direction of the PWE3 working group\
    \ chairs, a survey was\n   created to sample the nature of implementations of\
    \ PWs, with specific\n   emphasis on Control Word usage, and VCCV, with emphasis\
    \ on Control\n   Channel and Control Type usage.  The survey consisted of a series\
    \ of\n   questions based on direction of the WG chairs and the survey opened\n\
    \   to the public on November 4, 2010.  The survey was conducted using\n   the\
    \ SurveyMonkey tool, http://www.surveymonkey.com.  The survey ran\n   from November\
    \ 4, 2010 until February 25, 2011 and was repeatedly\n   publicized on the PWE3\
    \ email list over that period.\n   The editors took precautions to ensure the\
    \ validity of the sample and\n   the data.  Specifically, only responses with\
    \ recognizable non-vendor\n   company-affiliated email addresses were accepted.\
    \  Unrecognizable or\n   personal email addresses would have been contacted to\
    \ determine their\n   validity, but none were received.  Only one response was\
    \ received\n   from each responding company.  If multiple responses from a company\n\
    \   had been received, they would have been contacted to determine\n   whether\
    \ the responses were duplicative or additive.  This, however,\n   did not occur.\n"

  - "2.8.  Open-Ended Question\n   Space was provided for user feedback.  The following\
    \ instructions\n   were given: \"Please use this space to provide any feedback\
    \ regarding\n   PW and VCCV deployments, VCCV interoperability challenges, this\n\
    \   survey or any network/vendor details you wish to share.\"  Below are\n   the\
    \ responses, made anonymous.  The responses are otherwise provided\n   here verbatim.\n\
    \   1.  BFD VCCV Control Channel is not indicated in the survey (may be\n    \
    \   required for PW redundancy purpose)\n   2.  Using CV is not required at the\
    \ moment\n   3.  COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from multiple\n\
    \       vendors.  COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of VCCV\n      \
    \ Control Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor\n       platforms.\
    \  This will provide COMPANY with significant advantages\n       in reduced operational\
    \ overheads when handling cross-domain\n       faults.  Having a uniform VCCV\
    \ feature implementation in COMPANY\n       multi-vendor network leads to:\n \
    \      o  Reduced operational cost and complexity\n       o  Reduced OSS development\
    \ to coordinate incompatible VCCV\n          implementations.\n       o  Increased\
    \ end-end service availability when handing faults.\n       In addition, currently\
    \ some of COMPANY deployed VCCV traffic\n       flows (on some vendor platforms)\
    \ are not guaranteed to follow\n       those of the customer's application traffic\
    \ (a key operational\n       requirement).  As a result, the response from the\
    \ circuit ping\n       cannot faithfully reflect the status of the circuit.  This\
    \ leads\n       to ambiguity regarding the operational status of our networks.\n\
    \       An in-band method is highly preferred, with COMPANY having a\n       clear\
    \ preference for VCCV Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word.\n       This preference\
    \ is being pursued with each of COMPANY vendors.\n   4.  PW VCCV is very useful\
    \ tool for finding faults in each PW\n       channel.  Without this we can not\
    \ find fault on a PW channel.  PW\n       VCCV using BFD is another better option.\
    \  Interoperability\n       challenges are with Ethernet OAM mechanism.\n   5.\
    \  We are using L2PVPN AToM like-to-like models - ATMoMPLS - EoMPLS\n       ATMoMPLS\
    \ : This service offered for transporting ATM cells over\n       IP/MPLS core\
    \ with Edge ATM CE devices including BPX, Ericsson\n       Media Gateway etc.\
    \  This is purely a Port mode with cell-packing\n       configuration on it to\
    \ have best performance.  QoS marking is\n       done for getting LLQ treatment\
    \ in the core for these MPLS\n       encapsulated ATM packets.  EoMPLS: This service\
    \ offered for\n       transporting 2G/3G traffic from network such as Node-B to\
    \ RNC's\n       over IP/MPLS backbone core network.  QoS marking is done for\n\
    \       getting guaranteed bandwidth treatment in the core for these MPLS\n  \
    \     encapsulated ATM packets.  In addition to basic L2VPN service\n       configuration,\
    \ these traffic are routed via MPLS TE tunnels with\n       dedicated path and\
    \ bandwidth defined to avoid bandwidth related\n       congestion.\n   6.  EQUIPMENT\
    \ MANUFACTURER does not provide options to configure VCCV\n       control-channel\
    \ and its sub options for LDP based L2Circuits.\n       How can we achieve end-to-end\
    \ management and fault detection of\n       PW without VCCV in such cases?\n \
    \  7.  I'm very interested in this work as we continue to experience\n       interop\
    \ challenges particularly with newer vendors to the space\n       who are only\
    \ implementing VCCV via control word.  Vendors who\n       have tailed their MPLS\
    \ OAM set specifically to the cell backhaul\n       space and mandatory CW have\
    \ been known to fall into this space.\n       That's all I've got.\n"

    \       COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from multiple\n  \
    \     vendors.  COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of VCCV\n       Control\
    \ Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor\n       platforms.  This\
    \ will provide COMPANY with significant advantages\n       in reduced operational\
    \ overheads when handling cross-domain\n       faults.  Having a uniform VCCV\
    \ feature implementation in COMPANY\n       multi-vendor network leads to:\n \
    \      o   Reduced operational cost and complexity\n       o   Reduced OSS development\
    \ to coordinate incompatible VCCV\n           implementations.\n       o   Increased\
    \ end-end service availability when handing faults.\n       In addition, currently\
    \ some of COMPANY deployed VCCV traffic\n       flows (on some vendor platforms)\
    \ are not guaranteed to follow\n       those of the customer's application traffic\
    \ (a key operational\n       requirement).  As a result, the response from the\
    \ circuit ping\n       cannot faithfully reflect the status of the circuit.  This\
    \ leads\n       to ambiguity regarding the operational status of our networks.\n\
    \       An in-band method is highly preferred, with COMPANY having a\n       clear\
    \ preference for VCCV Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word.\n       This preference\
    \ is being pursued with each of COMPANY vendors.\n"
