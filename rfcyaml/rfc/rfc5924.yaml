    \               Figure 1: SIP Trapezoid\n   Assume that alice@example.com creates\
    \ an INVITE for bob@example.net;\n   her user agent routes the request to some\
    \ proxy in her domain,\n   example.com.  Suppose also that example.com is a large\
    \ organization\n   that maintains several SIP proxies, and her INVITE arrived\
    \ at an\n   outbound proxy Proxy-A.example.com.  In order to route the request\n\
    \   onward, Proxy-A uses RFC 3263 [7] resolution and finds that Proxy-\n   B.example.net\
    \ is a valid proxy for example.net that uses Transport\n   Layer Security (TLS).\
    \  Proxy-A.example.com requests a TLS connection\n   to Proxy-B.example.net, and\
    \ in the TLS handshake each one presents a\n   certificate to authenticate that\
    \ connection.  The validation of these\n   certificates by each proxy to determine\
    \ whether or not their peer is\n   authoritative for the appropriate SIP domain\
    \ is defined in \"Domain\n   Certificates in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\"\
    \ [8].\n   A SIP domain name is frequently textually identical to the same DNS\n\
    \   name used for other purposes.  For example, the DNS name example.com\n   can\
    \ serve as a SIP domain name, an email domain name, and a web\n   service name.\
    \  Since these different services within a single\n   organization might be administered\
    \ independently and hosted\n   separately, it is desirable that a certificate\
    \ be able to bind the\n   DNS name to its usage as a SIP domain name without creating\
    \ the\n   implication that the entity presenting the certificate is also\n   authoritative\
    \ for some other purpose.  A mechanism is needed to allow\n   the certificate\
    \ issued to a proxy to be restricted such that the\n   subject name(s) that the\
    \ certificate contains are valid only for use\n   in SIP.  In our example, Proxy-B\
    \ possesses a certificate making\n   Proxy-B authoritative as a SIP server for\
    \ the domain example.net;\n   furthermore, Proxy-B has a policy that requires\
    \ the client's SIP\n   domain be authenticated through a similar certificate.\
    \  Proxy-A is\n   authoritative as a SIP server for the domain example.com; when\n\
    \   Proxy-A makes a TLS connection to Proxy-B, the latter accepts the\n   connection\
    \ based on its policy.\n"
- title: 4.  Restricting Usage to SIP
  contents:
  - "4.  Restricting Usage to SIP\n   This memo defines a certificate profile for\
    \ restricting the usage of\n   a domain name binding to usage as a SIP domain\
    \ name.  RFC 5280 [3],\n   Section 4.2.1.12, defines a mechanism for this purpose:\
    \ an \"Extended\n   Key Usage\" (EKU) attribute, where the purpose of the EKU\
    \ extension is\n   described as:\n      If the extension is present, then the\
    \ certificate MUST only be\n      used for one of the purposes indicated.  If\
    \ multiple purposes are\n      indicated the application need not recognize all\
    \ purposes\n      indicated, as long as the intended purpose is present.\n   \
    \   Certificate using applications MAY require that the extended key\n      usage\
    \ extension be present and that a particular purpose be\n      indicated in order\
    \ for the certificate to be acceptable to that\n      application.\n   A Certificate\
    \ Authority issuing a certificate whose purpose is to\n   bind a SIP domain identity\
    \ without binding other non-SIP identities\n   MUST include an id-kp-sipDomain\
    \ attribute in the Extended Key Usage\n   extension value (see Section 4.1).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Extended Key Usage Values for SIP Domains
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Extended Key Usage Values for SIP Domains\n   RFC 5280 [3] specifies the\
    \ EKU X.509 certificate extension for use in\n   the Internet.  The extension\
    \ indicates one or more purposes for which\n   the certified public key is valid.\
    \  The EKU extension can be used in\n   conjunction with the key usage extension,\
    \ which indicates how the\n   public key in the certificate is used, in a more\
    \ basic cryptographic\n   way.\n   The EKU extension syntax is repeated here for\

- title: 5.  Using the SIP EKU in a Certificate
  contents:
  - "5.  Using the SIP EKU in a Certificate\n   Section 7.1 of Domain Certificates\
    \ in the Session Initiation Protocol\n   [8] contains the steps for finding an\
    \ identity (or a set of\n   identities) in an X.509 certificate for SIP.  In order\
    \ to determine\n   whether the usage of a certificate is restricted to serve as\
    \ a SIP\n   certificate only, implementations MUST perform the steps given below\n\
    \   as a part of the certificate validation:\n   The implementation MUST examine\
    \ the Extended Key Usage value(s):\n   o  If the certificate does not contain\
    \ any EKU values (the Extended\n      Key Usage extension does not exist), it\
    \ is a matter of local\n      policy whether or not to accept the certificate\
    \ for use as a SIP\n      certificate.  Note that since certificates not following\
    \ this\n      specification will not have the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value, and\n\
    \      many do not have any EKU values, the more interoperable local\n      policy\
    \ would be to accept the certificate.\n   o  If the certificate contains the id-kp-sipDomain\
    \ EKU extension,\n      then implementations of this specification MUST consider\
    \ the\n      certificate acceptable for use as a SIP certificate.\n   o  If the\
    \ certificate does not contain the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value,\n      but does\
    \ contain the id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage EKU value, it is a\n      matter of local\
    \ policy whether or not to consider the certificate\n      acceptable for use\
    \ as a SIP certificate.\n   o  If the EKU extension exists, but does not contain\
    \ any of the id-\n      kp-sipDomain or id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage EKU values,\
    \ then the\n      certificate MUST NOT be accepted as valid for use as a SIP\n\
    \      certificate.\n"
- title: 6.  Implications for a Certification Authority
  contents:
  - "6.  Implications for a Certification Authority\n   The procedures and practices\
    \ employed by a certification authority\n   MUST ensure that the correct values\
    \ for the EKU extension and\n   subjectAltName are inserted in each certificate\
    \ that is issued.  For\n   certificates that indicate authority over a SIP domain,\
    \ but not over\n   services other than SIP, certificate authorities MUST include\
    \ the id-\n   kp-sipDomain EKU extension.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This memo defines an EKU X.509 certificate extension\
    \ that restricts\n   the usage of a certificate to a SIP service belonging to\
    \ an\n   autonomous domain.  Relying parties can execute applicable policies\n\
    \   (such as those related to billing) on receiving a certificate with\n   the\
    \ id-kp-sipDomain EKU value.  An id-kp-sipDomain EKU value does not\n   introduce\
    \ any new security or privacy concerns.\n"
- title: 8.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   The id-kp-sipDomain purpose requires an object identifier\
    \ (OID).  The\n   objects are defined in an arc delegated by IANA to the PKIX\
    \ working\n   group.  No further action is necessary by IANA.\n"
