  - "1.  Introduction\n   Interior Gateway Protocols such as IS-IS are designed to\
    \ provide\n   timely information about the best routes in a routing domain.  The\n\
    \   original design of IS-IS, as described in ISO 10589 [1] has proved to\n  \
    \ be quite durable.  However, a number of original design choices have\n   been\
    \ modified.  This document describes some of the differences\n   between the protocol\
    \ as described in RFC 1195 [2] and the protocol\n   that can be observed on the\
    \ wire today.  A companion document\n   describes the differences between the\
    \ protocol described in ISO 10589\n   and current practice [8].\n   The key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\" and \"MAY\" in\n   this document\
    \ are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].\n"

- title: 4.  Overload Bit
  contents:
  - "4.  Overload Bit\n   To deal with transient problems that prevent an IS from\
    \ storing all\n   the LSPs it receives, ISO 10589 defines an LSP Database Overload\n\
    \   condition in section 7.3.19.  When an IS is in Database Overload\n   condition,\
    \ it sets a flag called the Overload Bit in the non-\n   pseudonode LSP number\
    \ Zero that it generates.  Section 7.2.8.1 of ISO\n   10589 instructs other systems\
    \ not to use the overloaded IS as a\n   transit router.  Since the overloaded\
    \ IS does not have complete\n   information, it may not be able to compute the\
    \ right routes, and\n   routing loops could develop.  However, an overloaded router\
    \ may be\n   used to reach End Systems directly attached to the router, as it\
    \ may\n   provide the only path to an End System.\n   The ability to signal reduced\
    \ knowledge is so useful that the meaning\n   of this flag has been overloaded.\
    \  In a Service Provider's network,\n   when a router running BGP and IS-IS reboots,\
    \ BGP might take more time\n   to converge than IS-IS.  Thus the router may drop\
    \ traffic for\n   destinations not yet learned via BGP.  It is convenient to set\
    \ the\n   Overload Bit until BGP has converged, as described in \"Intermediate\n\
    \   System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Transient Blackhole Avoidance\"\n  \
    \ [6].\n   An implementation SHOULD use the Overload Bit to signal that it is\n\
    \   not ready to accept transit traffic.\n   An implementation SHOULD not set\
    \ the Overload bit in PseudoNode LSPs\n   that it generates, and Overload bits\
    \ seen in PseudoNode LSPs SHOULD\n   be ignored.  This is also discussed in the\
    \ companion document on ISO\n   interoperability [8].\n   RFC 1195 makes clear\
    \ when describing the SPF algorithm for IP routers\n   in section C.1.4 that directly\
    \ connected IP subnetworks are reachable\n   when an IS is overloaded.\n     \
    \ Note that the End Systems neighbors of the system P includes IP\n      reachable\
    \ address entries included in the LSPs from system P.\n   When processing LSPs\
    \ received from a router which has the Overload\n   bit set in LSP number Zero,\
    \ the receiving router SHOULD treat all IP\n   reachability advertisements as\
    \ directly connected and use them in its\n   SPF computation.\n   Since the IP\
    \ prefixes that an overloaded router announces will be\n   treated as directly\
    \ attached, an overloaded router SHOULD take care\n   in selecting which routes\
    \ to advertise in the LSPs it generates.\n"
- title: 5.  Migration from Narrow Metrics to Wide
  contents:
  - "5.  Migration from Narrow Metrics to Wide\n   The IS-Neighbors TLV (TLV 2) as\
    \ defined in ISO 10589 and the IP\n   Reachability TLV (TLV 128/TLV 130) as defined\
    \ in RFC 1195 provide a 6\n   bit metric for the default link metric to the listed\
    \ neighbor.  This\n   metric has proved too limited.  The Extended IS-Neighbors\
    \ TLV (TLV\n   22) and the Extended IP Reachability TLV (TLV 135) are defined\
    \ in\n   \"IS-IS extensions for Traffic Engineering\" [5].  The Extended IS-\n\
    \   Neighbors TLV (TLV 22) defines a 24 bit metric, and the Extended IP\n   Reachability\
    \ TLV (TLV 135) defines a 32 bit metric for IP Networks\n   and Hosts.\n   If\
    \ not all devices in the IS-IS domain support wide metrics, narrow\n   metrics\
    \ MUST continue to be used.  Once all devices in the network\n   are able to support\
    \ the new TLVs containing wide metrics, the network\n   can be migrated to the\
    \ new metric style, though care must be taken to\n   avoid routing loops.\n  \
    \ We make the following assumptions about the implementation:\n      (1)   Each\
    \ system can generate and understand both narrow and wide\n            metrics.\n\
    \      (2)   The implementation can run the SPF algorithm on an LSP DB\n     \
    \       with instances of both metric styles.\n      (3)   If there are two metric\
    \ styles for a link or IP prefix, it\n            will pick one of them as the\
    \ true cost for the link.\n   To compare the different variants of the narrow\
    \ metric with wide\n   metrics, we need an algorithm that translates External\
    \ and Internal\n   narrow metrics into a common integer range.  Since we have\
    \ different\n   computations for the L1 and L2 routes, we only need to map metrics\n\
    \   from a single level.\n   In RFC 1195 section 3.10.2, item 2c) states that\
    \ the IP prefixes\n   located in \"IP External Reachability\" with internal-metric\
    \ and IP\n   prefixes located in \"IP Internal Reachability\" with internal-metric\n\
    \   have the same preference.  As defined in \"Domain-wide Prefix\n   Distribution\
    \ with Two-Level IS-IS\", the Most Significant Bit on an L1\n   metric tells us\
    \ if the route has been leaked down, but does not\n   change the distance.  Thus\
    \ we will ignore the MSBit.\n   We interpret the default metric as an 7 bit quantity.\
    \  Metrics with\n   the external bit set are interpreted as metrics in the range\n\
    \   [64..127].  Metrics with the external bit clear are interpreted as\n   metrics\
    \ in the range [0..63].\n"
- title: 5.1.  Transition Algorithm
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Transition Algorithm\n   To facilitate a smooth transition between the\
    \ use of narrow metrics\n   exclusively to the use of wide metrics exclusively,\
    \ the following\n   steps must be taken, in the order below.\n      (1)   All\
    \ routers advertise Narrow Metrics as defined in ISO\n            10589, and consider\
    \ narrow metrics only in their SPF\n            computation.\n      (2)   Each\
    \ system is configured in turn to send wide metrics as\n            well as narrow\
    \ metrics.  The two metrics for the same link\n            or IP prefix SHOULD\
    \ agree.\n      (3)   When all systems are advertising wide metrics, make any\n\
    \            changes necessary on each system to consider Wide Metrics\n     \
    \       during the SPF, and change MaxPathMetric to 0xFE000000.\n      (4)   Each\
    \ system is configured in turn to stop advertising narrow\n            metrics.\n\
    \      (5)   When the network is only using wide metrics, metrics on\n       \
    \     individual links may be rescaled to take advantage of the\n            larger\
    \ metric.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Dealing with Non-Equal Metrics
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Dealing with Non-Equal Metrics\n   The algorithm above assumes that the\
    \ metrics are equal, and thus\n   needs to make no assumption about which metric\
    \ the SPF algorithm\n   uses.  This section describes the changes that should\
    \ be made to the\n   SPF algorithm when both Narrow and Wide metric styles should\
    \ be\n   considered.  Using a common algorithm allows different\n   implementations\
    \ to compute the same distances independently, even if\n   the wide and narrow\
    \ metrics do not agree.\n   The standard SPF algorithm proceeds by comparing sums\
    \ of link costs\n   to obtain a minimal cost path.  During transition, there will\
    \ be more\n   than one description of the same links.  We resolve this by selecting\n\
    \   the minimum metric for each link.  This may give us a path with some\n   links\
    \ chosen due to a wide metric and some links chosen due to a\n   narrow metric.\n\
    \   The description below is more complex than the implementation needs\n   to\
    \ be: the implementation may simply select the minimal cost neighbor\n   in TENT,\
    \ discarding paths to destinations we have already reached, as\n   described in\
    \ ISO 10589.\n   The variables MaxPathMetric and MaxLinkMetric SHOULD retain the\n\

    \  d(N) = metric of the circuit\n      If multiple styles of metric for the link\

- title: 6.  Intermediate System Hello (ISH) PDU
  contents:
  - "6.  Intermediate System Hello (ISH) PDU\n   The original intent of RFC 1195 was\
    \ to provide a routing protocol\n   capable of handling both CLNS and IPv4 reachability\
    \ information.  To\n   allow CLNS Endstations (ES) to know that they are attached\
    \ to a\n   router, Intermediate Systems are required to send Intermediate System\n\
    \   Hello PDUs (ISH) for End Stations when a point-to-point circuit comes\n  \
    \ up.  Furthermore, an IS is not allowed to send Intermediate System to\n   Intermediate\
    \ System Hello PDUs (IIH) before receiving an ISH from a\n   peer.  This reduces\
    \ routing protocol traffic on links with a single\n   IS.\n   For this reason\
    \ section 5.1 RFC 1195 states:\n         \"On point-to-point links, the exchange\
    \ of ISO 9542 ISHs\n         (intermediate system Hellos) is used to initialize\
    \ the link,\n         and to allow each router to know if there is a router on\
    \ the\n         other end of the link, before IS-IS Hellos are exchanged.  All\n\
    \         routers implementing IS-IS (whether IP-only, OSI-only, or\n        \
    \ dual), if they have any interfaces on point-to-point links,\n         must therefore\
    \ be able to transmit ISO 9542 ISHs on their\n         point-to-point links.\"\
    \n   Section 5.1 RFC 1195 reinforces the need to comply with section 8.2.4\n \
    \  of ISO 10589.  However, in an IP Only environment, the original need\n   for\
    \ the ISH PDU is not present.\n   A multi-protocol IS that supports the attachment\
    \ of CLNS ESs over\n   Point to Point circuits must act in accordance with section\
    \ 8.2.2 ISO\n   10589 when CLNS functionality is enabled.\n   An IP only implementation\
    \ SHOULD issue an ISH PDU as described in\n   section 8.2.3 of ISO 10589.  This\
    \ is to inter-operate with\n   implementations which require an ISH to initiate\
    \ the formation of an\n   IS-IS adjacency.\n   An IP Only implementation may issue\
    \ an IIH PDU when a point to point\n   circuit transitions into an \"Up\" state\
    \ to initiate the formation of\n   an IS-IS adjacency, without sending an ISH\
    \ PDU.  However, this may\n   not inter-operate with implementations which require\
    \ an ISH for\n   adjacency formation.\n   An IS may issue an IIH PDU in response\
    \ to the receipt of an IIH PDU\n   in accordance with section 8.2.5.2 ISO 10589,\
    \ even though it has not\n   received an ISH PDU.\n"

    \ Intermediate Systems routing IP traffic when there is a default\n   route in\

    \ the \"IP External Reachability Information\"\n         field, as explained in\

- title: 9.  Non-homogeneous Protocol Networks
  contents:
  - "9.  Non-homogeneous Protocol Networks\n   RFC 1195 assumes that every deployment\
    \ of IS-IS routers will support\n   a homogeneous set of protocols.  It anticipates\
    \ OSI only, IP only, or\n   dual OSI and IP routers.  While it allows mixed areas\
    \ with, for\n   example, both pure IP and Dual IP and OSI routers, it allows only\
    \ IP\n   traffic in such domains, and OSI traffic only when pure OSI and Dual\n\
    \   IP and OSI routers are present.  Thus it provides only lowest common\n   denominator\
    \ routing.\n   RFC 1195 also requires the inclusion of the Protocol Supported\
    \ TLV\n   with code 129 in IIH and ISH PDUs and in LSP number Zero.  IP capable\n\
    \   routers MUST generate a Protocol Supported TLV, and MUST include the\n   IP\
    \ protocol as a supported protocol.  A router that does not include\n   the Protocols\
    \ Supported TLV may be assumed to be a pure OSI router\n   and can be interpreted\
    \ as implicitly \"advertising\" support for the\n   OSI protocol.\n   The requirements\
    \ of RFC 1195 are ample if networks adhere to this\n   restriction.  However,\
    \ the behavior of mixed networks that do not\n   follow these guidelines is not\
    \ well defined.\n   The ITU-T requires that SONET/SDH equipment running the IS-IS\n\
    \   protocol must not form an adjacency with a neighbour unless they\n   share\
    \ at least one network layer protocol in common.  Unless this\n   feature is present\
    \ in every IS in the SONET or SDH DCN network the\n   network may not function\
    \ correctly.  Implementors MAY include this\n   feature if they wish to ensure\
    \ interoperability with SONET and SDH\n   DCN networks.\n   Definition of an interoperable\
    \ strategy for resolving the problems\n   that arise in non-homogeneous protocol\
    \ networks remains incomplete.\n   Members of the ITU are actively working on\
    \ a proposal: see\n   \"Architecture and Specification of Data Communication Network\"\

- title: 10.  Adjacency Creation and IP Interface Addressing
  contents:
  - "10.  Adjacency Creation and IP Interface Addressing\n   RFC 1195 states that\
    \ adjacencies are formed without regard to IP\n   interface addressing.  However,\
    \ many current implementations refuse\n   adjacencies based on interface addresses\
    \ and related issues.\n   In section 4.2, RFC 1195 requires routers with IP interface\
    \ addresses\n   to advertise the addresses in an IP Interface Address TLV (132)\n\
    \   carried in IIH PDUs.  Some implementations will not interoperate with\n  \
    \ a neighbor router that does not include the IP Interface Address TLV.\n   Further,\
    \ some implementations will not form an adjacency on broadcast\n   interfaces\
    \ with a peer who does not share an interface address in\n   some common IP subnetwork.\n\
    \   If a LAN contains a mixture of implementations, some that form\n   adjacencies\
    \ with all neighbors and some that do not, care must be\n   taken when assigning\
    \ IP addresses.  If not all routers in a LAN are\n   on the same IP subnet, it\
    \ is possible that DIS election may fail,\n   leading to the election of multiple\

    \ can result because the\n   IS-IS LAN transitivity requirements of section 6.7.3\
    \ ISO 10589 are\n   not met.\n   Unnumbered point to point links do not have IP\

    \ on an\n   unnumbered point to point link do not need to be related.  However,\n\
    \   some implementations will not form an adjacency on numbered point to\n   point\
    \ links if the interface addresses of each endpoint are not in\n   the same IP\
    \ subnetwork.  This means that care must be taken in\n   assigning IP interface\
