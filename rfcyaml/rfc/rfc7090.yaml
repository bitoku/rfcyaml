  - "Abstract\n   After an emergency call is completed (terminated either prematurely\n
    \  by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker), the call\n   taker
    may feel the need for further communication.  For example, the\n   call may have
    been dropped by accident without the call taker having\n   sufficient information
    about the current state of an accident victim.\n   A call taker may trigger a
    callback to the emergency caller using the\n   contact information provided with
    the initial emergency call.  This\n   callback could, under certain circumstances,
    be treated like any\n   other call and, as a consequence, it may get blocked by
    authorization\n   policies or may get forwarded to an answering machine.\n   The
    IETF emergency services architecture specification already offers\n   a solution
    approach for allowing Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)\n   callbacks to bypass
    authorization policies in order to reach the\n   caller without unnecessary delays.
    \ Unfortunately, the specified\n   mechanism only supports limited scenarios.
    \ This document discusses\n   shortcomings of the current mechanisms and illustrates
    additional\n   scenarios where better-than-normal call treatment behavior would
    be\n   desirable.  We describe a solution based on a new header field value\n
    \  for the SIP Priority header field, called \"psap-callback\", to mark\n   PSAP
    callbacks.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Summoning police, the fire department, or an ambulance in
    emergencies\n   is one of the fundamental and most valuable functions of the\n
    \  telephone.  As telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched\n   telephony
    to Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that\n   this core functionality
    will continue to work at least as well as it\n   has for the legacy technology.
    \ New devices and services are being\n   made available that could be used to
    make a request for help and that\n   are not traditional telephones.  Users are
    increasingly expecting\n   them to be used to place emergency calls.\n   An overview
    of the protocol interactions for emergency calling using\n   the IETF emergency
    services architecture is described in [RFC6443],\n   and [RFC6881] specifies the
    technical details.  As part of the\n   emergency call setup procedure, two important
    identifiers are\n   conveyed to the PSAP call taker's user agent, namely the address-of-\n
    \  record (AOR), and if available, the Globally Routable User Agent (UA)\n   URIs
    (GRUUs).  RFC 3261 [RFC3261] defines the AOR as:\n      An address-of-record (AOR)
    is a SIP or SIPS URI that points to a\n      domain with a location service that
    can map the URI to another URI\n      where the user might be available.  Typically,
    the location\n      service is populated through registrations.  An AOR is frequently\n
    \     thought of as the \"public address\" of the user.\n   In SIP systems, a
    single user can have a number of user agents\n   (handsets, softphones, voicemail
    accounts, etc.) that are all\n   referenced by the same AOR.  There are a number
    of cases in which it\n   is desirable to have an identifier that addresses a single
    user agent\n   rather than the group of user agents indicated by an AOR.  The
    GRUU\n   is such a unique user-agent identifier, and it is also globally\n   routable.
    \ [RFC5627] specifies how to obtain and use GRUUs.\n   [RFC6881] also makes use
    of the GRUU for emergency calls.\n   Regulatory requirements demand that the emergency
    call setup\n   procedure itself provides enough information to allow the call
    taker\n   to initiate a callback to the emergency caller.  This is desirable in\n
    \  those cases where the call is dropped prematurely or when further\n   communication
    needs arise.  The AOR and the GRUU serve this purpose.\n   The communication attempt
    by the PSAP call taker back to the\n   emergency caller is called a \"PSAP callback\".\n
    \  A PSAP callback may, however, be blocked by user-configured\n   authorization
    policies or may be forwarded to an answering machine\n   since SIP entities (SIP
    proxies as well as the SIP user equipment\n   itself) cannot differentiate the
    PSAP callback from any other SIP\n   call.  \"Call barring\", \"do not disturb\",
    or \"call diversion\" (also\n   called call forwarding) are features that prevent
    delivery of a call.\n   It is important to note that these features may be implemented
    by SIP\n   intermediaries as well as by the user agent.\n   Among the emergency
    services community, there is a desire to treat\n   PSAP callbacks in such a way
    that the chances of reaching the\n   emergency caller are increased.  At the same
    time, any solution must\n   minimize the chance that other calls bypass call forwarding
    or other\n   authorization policies.  Ideally, the PSAP callback has to relate
    to\n   an earlier emergency call that was made \"not too long ago\".  An exact\n
    \  time interval is difficult to define in a global IETF standard due to\n   the
    variety of national regulatory requirements, but [RFC6881]\n   suggests 30 minutes.\n
    \  Nevertheless, to meet the needs from the emergency services\n   community,
    a basic mechanism for preferential treatment of PSAP\n   callbacks was defined
    in Section 13 of [RFC6443].  The specification\n   says:\n      A UA may be able
    to determine a PSAP callback by examining the\n      domain of incoming calls
    after placing an emergency call and\n      comparing that to the domain of the
    answering PSAP from the\n      emergency call.  Any call from the same domain
    and directed to the\n      supplied Contact header or AOR after an emergency call
    should be\n      accepted as a callback from the PSAP if it occurs within a\n
    \     reasonable time after an emergency call was placed.\n   This approach mimics
    a stateful packet-filtering firewall and is\n   indeed helpful in a number of
    cases.  It is also relatively simple to\n   implement even though it requires
    call state to be maintained by the\n   user agent as well as by SIP intermediaries.
    \ Unfortunately, the\n   solution does not work in all deployment scenarios.  In
    Section 3 we\n   describe cases where the currently standardized approach is\n
    \  insufficient.\n"

    \  This includes terminology like emergency caller, user equipment, call\n   taker,
    Emergency Service Routing Proxy (ESRP), and Public Safety\n   Answering Point
    (PSAP).\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL
    NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

  - "3.  Callback Scenarios\n   This section illustrates a number of scenarios where
    the currently\n   specified solution, as described in [RFC6881], for preferential\n
    \  treatment of callbacks fails.  As explained in Section 1, a SIP\n   entity
    examines an incoming PSAP callback by comparing the domain of\n   the PSAP with
    the destination domain of the outbound emergency call\n   placed earlier.\n"

    - "3.1.  Routing Asymmetry\n   In some deployment environments, it is common to
      have incoming and\n   outgoing SIP messaging routed through different SIP entities.\n
      \  Figure 1 shows this graphically whereby a Voice over IP (VoIP)\n   provider
      uses different SIP proxies for inbound and for outbound call\n   handling.  Unless
      the two devices are synchronized, the callback\n   reaching the inbound proxy
      would get treated like any other call\n   since the emergency call established
      state information at the\n   outbound proxy only.\n                                                   ,-------.\n

    - "3.2.  Multi-Stage Routing\n   Consider the emergency call routing scenario
      shown in Figure 2 where\n   routing towards the PSAP occurs in several stages.
      \ In this scenario,\n   we consider a SIP UA that uses the Location-to-Service
      Translation\n   (LoST) Protocol [RFC5222] to learn the next-hop destination,
      namely\n   esrp@example.net, to get the call closer to the PSAP.  This call
      is\n   then sent to the proxy of the user's VoIP provider (example.org).\n   The
      user's VoIP provider receives the emergency call and creates a\n   state based
      on the destination domain, namely example.net.  It then\n   routes the call
      to the indicated ESRP.  When the ESRP receives the\n   call, it needs to decide
      what the next hop is to get to the final\n   PSAP.  In our example, the next
      hop is the PSAP with the URI\n   psap@example.com.\n   When a callback is sent
      from psap@example.com towards the emergency\n   caller, the call will get normal
      treatment by the proxy of the VoIP\n   provider since the domain of the PSAP
      does not match the stored state\n   information.\n                                         ,-----------.\n

    - "5.3.  Security Solution\n   The approach for dealing with the implementation
      of the security\n   requirements described in Section 5.2 can be differentiated
      between\n   the behavior applied by the UA and by SIP proxies.  A UA that has\n
      \  made an emergency call MUST keep state information so that it can\n   recognize
      and accept a callback from the PSAP if it occurs within a\n   reasonable time
      after an emergency call was placed, as described in\n   Section 13 of [RFC6443].
      \ Only a timer started at the time when the\n   original emergency call has
      ended is required; information about the\n   calling party identity is not needed
      since the callback may use a\n   different calling party identity, as described
      in Section 3.  Since\n   these SIP UA considerations are described already in
      [RFC6443] as\n   well as in [RFC6881] the rest of this section focuses on the
      behavior\n   of SIP proxies.\n   Figure 7 shows the architecture that utilizes
      the identity of the\n   PSAP to decide whether a preferential treatment of callbacks
      should\n   be provided.  To make this policy decision, the identity of the PSAP\n
      \  (i.e., calling party identity) is compared with a PSAPs white list.\n                       +----------+\n

      \  The identity assurance in SIP can come in different forms, namely via\n   the
      SIP Identity [RFC4474] or the P-Asserted-Identity [RFC3325]\n   mechanisms.
      \ The former technique relies on a cryptographic assurance\n   and the latter
      on a chain of trust.  Also, the usage of Transport\n   Layer Security (TLS)
      between neighboring SIP entities may provide\n   useful identity information.
      \ At the time of writing, these identity\n   technologies are being revised
      in the Secure Telephone Identity\n   Revisited (stir) working group [STIR] to
      offer better support for\n   legacy technologies interworking and SIP intermediaries
      that modify\n   the content of various SIP headers and the body.  Once the work
      on\n   these specifications has been completed, they will offer a stronger\n
      \  calling party identity mechanism that limits or prevents identity\n   spoofing.\n
      \  An important aspect from a security point of view is the relationship\n   between
      the emergency services network (containing the PSAPs) and the\n   VoIP provider,
      assuming that the emergency call travels via the VoIP\n   provider and not directly
      between the SIP UA and the PSAP.\n   The establishment of a white list with
      PSAP identities may be\n   operationally complex and dependent on the relationship
      between the\n   emergency services operator and the VoIP provider.  If there
      is a\n   relationship between the VoIP provider and the PSAP operator, for\n
      \  example, when they are both operating in the same geographical\n   region,
      then populating the white list is fairly simple and\n   consequently the identification
      of a PSAP callback is less\n   problematic compared to the case where the two
      entities have never\n   interacted with each other before.  In the end, the
      VoIP provider has\n   to verify whether the marked callback message indeed came
      from a\n   legitimate source.\n   VoIP providers MUST only give PSAP callbacks
      preferential treatment\n   when the calling party identity of the PSAP was successfully
      matched\n   against entries in the white list.  If it cannot be verified (because\n
      \  there was no match), then the VoIP provider MUST remove the PSAP\n   callback
      marking.  Thereby, the callback reverts to a normal call.\n   As a second step,
      SIP UAs MUST maintain a timer that is started with\n   the original emergency
      call and this timer expires within a\n   reasonable amount of time, such as
      30 minutes per [RFC6881].  Such a\n   timer also ensures that VoIP providers
      cannot misuse the PSAP\n   callback mechanism, for example, to ensure that their
      support calls\n   reach their customers.\n   Finally, a PSAP callback MUST use
      the same media as the original\n   emergency call.  For example, when an initial
      emergency call\n   established a real-time text communication session, then
      the PSAP\n   callback must also attempt to establish a real-time communication\n
      \  interaction.  The reason for this is twofold.  First, the person\n   seeking
      help may have disabilities that prevent them from using\n   certain media and
      hence using the same media for the callback avoids\n   unpleasant surprises
      and delays.  Second, the emergency caller may\n   have intentionally chosen
      a certain media and does not prefer to\n   communicate in a different way.  For
      example, it would be unfortunate\n   if a hostage tries to seek help using instant
      messaging to avoid any\n   noise when subsequently the ringtone triggered by
      a PSAP callback\n   using a voice call gets the attention of the hostage-taker.
      \ User-\n   interface designs need to cater to such situations.\n"
