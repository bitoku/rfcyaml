  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IPsecME working group was chartered to provide for IKEv2\n\
    \   ([RFC5996]) a symmetric secure password authentication protocol that\n   supports\
    \ the use of low-entropy shared secrets, and to protect\n   against off-line dictionary\
    \ attacks without requiring the use of\n   certificates or the Extensible Authentication\
    \ Protocol (EAP).  There\n   are multiple such methods, and the working group\
    \ was to pick one.\n   Unfortunately, the working group failed to pick one protocol,\
    \ and\n   there are multiple candidates going forward as separate documents.\n\
    \   As each of those older versions of those documents used a different\n   technique\
    \ to negotiate the use of the method and also used different\n   payload formats,\
    \ it is very hard to try to make an implementation\n   where multiple such systems\
    \ could co-exist.\n   Current document versions ([SPSK-AUTH], [PACE], and [PAKE])\
    \ use the\n   method described in this document.\n   This document describes IKEv2\
    \ payload formats that can be used for\n   multiple secure password methods to\
    \ negotiate and transmit data so\n   each different method can easily co-exist\
    \ in the same implementation.\n   This document consists of two major parts:\n\
    \   o  How to negotiate which secure password method negotiation is used.\n  \
    \ o  How to transmit data, between peers, that is specific to secure\n      password\
    \ methods.\n   The secure password methods are not usually meant to be used in\
    \ the\n   normal end user (remote access VPN) cases.  In such cases, EAP-based\n\
    \   authentication works fine, and the asymmetric nature of EAP does not\n   matter.\
    \  In such scenarios, the authentication is usually backed up\n   with the back-end\
    \ Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\n   servers and other infrastructure.\
    \  That is, in such scenarios,\n   neither of the IKEv2 peers really knows the\
    \ secret, as on one end it\n   is typed in by the user when it is needed, and\
    \ on the other end it is\n   authenticated by the back-end AAA server.\n   The\
    \ new secure password methods are meant to be used, for example, in\n   the authentication\
    \ between two servers or routers.  These scenarios\n   are usually symmetric:\
    \ both peers know the shared secret, no back-end\n   authentication servers are\
    \ involved, and either end can initiate an\n   IKEv2 connection.  Note that such\
    \ a model could also be supported by\n   EAP when an EAP method that can run in\
    \ symmetric fashion is in use,\n   and the EAP method is directly implemented\
    \ on both peers and no AAA\n   is in use.\n   In many cases, each implementation\
    \ will use only one of the proposed\n   secure password authentication methods\
    \ but can include support for\n   multiple methods even when only one of them\
    \ will be used.  For\n   example, a general-purpose operating system running IPsec\
    \ and IKEv2\n   and supporting secure password authentication methods to protect\n\
    \   services provided by the system might need to implement support for\n   several\
    \ methods.  It is then up to the administrator which one is to\n   be used.  As\
    \ the server might need to connect to multiple other\n   servers, each implementing\
    \ a different set of methods, it may not be\n   possible to pick one method that\
    \ would serve all cases.\n   The secure password methods mostly keep the existing\
    \ IKEv2\n   IKE_SA_INIT exchange and modify the IKE_AUTH authentication step.\
    \  As\n   those methods do not want to add new round trips, negotiating which\n\
    \   of the secure password methods to use needs to happen during the\n   IKE_SA_INIT.\
    \  As the identity of the other end is only provided\n   inside IKE_AUTH, the\
    \ responder needs to select the list of supported\n   methods based only on the\
    \ IP address of the initiator.  This could\n   lead to problems if only certain\
    \ methods would be acceptable for\n   certain identified peers.  Fortunately,\
    \ as the authentication is done\n   based on the secret shared between both peers,\
    \ the shared secret\n   should be usable in all of the methods; thus, a remote\
    \ peer usually\n   does not need to restrict selection of the method based on\
    \ the\n   initiator's identity but only based on the supported methods and the\n\
    \   administrative policy.\n   Also, as the initiator already knows which peer\
    \ it is connecting\n   with, it can limit which methods it proposes to the other\
    \ peer.  And\n   as secure password methods are meant to be used in symmetric\
    \ cases,\n   both ends should have similar configuration; i.e., they have the\
    \ same\n   shared secret and, most likely, also a list of acceptable\n   authentication\
    \ methods to be used.  This could also be interpreted so\n   that there is no\
    \ need to support method negotiation, as both ends can\n   already see this from\
    \ the configuration.  On the other hand, in most\n   cases, either end does not\
    \ really care which method is used but is\n   willing to use any secure method\
    \ that the other end supports.  In\n   such cases, the automatic negotiation provides\
    \ a way to make the\n   configuration easy, i.e., no need to pick one method to\
    \ be used\n   between the peers.\n   The reason for using the common IKEv2 payload\
    \ to transmit, between\n   peers, data that is specific to the secure password\
    \ method is that\n   the payload type field in the IKEv2 is only an 8-bit field,\
    \ and 62.5%\n   of the range is already reserved (50% to the private use numbers,\
    \ and\n   12.5% to the IKEv1 payload numbers).  This leaves 95 usable numbers,\n\
    \   out of which 16 are already in use.  Initially, it was proposed that\n   five\
    \ payload type numbers be consumed.  Those five new payload types\n   would already\
    \ represent a 31% increase in the number of currently\n   allocated payload types.\n"
- title: 2.  Method Negotiation
  contents:
  - "2.  Method Negotiation\n   Because all of the methods modify the IKE_AUTH exchange,\
    \ the\n   negotiation of the secure password method to be used needs to happen\n\
    \   during the IKE_SA_INIT exchange.  The secure password negotiation\n   exchange\
    \ would be:\n   Initiator                         Responder\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ If the N(SECURE_PASSWORD_METHODS) Notify payload is missing, then\n   normal\
    \ IKEv2 authentication methods are used.  If the Notify payloads\n   are included,\
    \ then the negotiation of the secure password methods\n   happens inside those\
    \ payloads.\n   As it might be possible that future secure password methods will\n\
    \   modify the IKE_AUTH payload in a more substantial way, it is better\n   that\
    \ as an end result of the negotiation we have exactly one secure\n   password\
    \ method that will be used.  The initiator will know which\n   methods are usable\
    \ when talking to that responder, so the initiator\n   will send a list of acceptable\
    \ methods in its IKE_SA_INIT request.\n   The responder will pick exactly one\
    \ method and put that in its\n   response.\n   The secure password methods are\
    \ identified by the 16-bit IANA-\n   allocated numbers stored in the Notify payload\
    \ notification data\n   field.  If a method supports multiple different password\n\
    \   preprocessing methods, each of those may be allocated a separate\n   number\
    \ from this space, or the method might do its own negotiation of\n   the preprocessing\
    \ method later.  As the initiator has already\n   selected the shared secret it\
    \ will be using, it will also know which\n   preprocessing it might need, so it\
    \ should propose only those\n   preprocessing methods suitable for the selected\
    \ shared secret.  This\n   means that it is recommended that separate IANA numbers\
    \ be allocated\n   for different preprocessing methods.\n   The actual Notify\
    \ payload will look like this:\n                        1                   2\

  - "3.  Generic Secure Password Method Payload\n   This payload will contain the\
    \ data that is specific to the secure\n   password payload.  The IKE_AUTH exchanges\
    \ might have a number of\n   these inside, depending on what is required and specified\
    \ by the\n   secure password method.  As the secure password method is already\n\
    \   selected during IKE_SA_INIT, there is no need to repeat the\n   information\
    \ of the selected secure password method; thus, this\n   payload only contains\
    \ the method-specific data.  As some secure\n   password methods require multiple\

  - "4.  IKE_AUTH Exchange\n   As the negotiation takes place during IKE_SA_INIT,\
    \ the secure\n   password methods may modify the IKE_AUTH exchange if needed.\
    \  To\n   easily enable implementing multiple methods, it is recommended that\n\
    \   IKE_AUTH exchange not be modified unnecessarily.  Adding zero, one,\n   or\
    \ multiple GSPM payloads to each exchange is needed, as is the\n   modification\
    \ to how the AUTH payload is calculated, but all other\n   changes should be kept\
    \ minimal.\n   The IKE_AUTH exchange should look similar to when EAP is used,\n\
    \   meaning that the first request includes IDi, SAi2, TSi, TSr, and some\n  \
    \ number of GSPM payloads.  The response should include IDr and, again,\n   a\
    \ number of GSPM payloads.  There may be multiple exchanges, each\n   consisting\
    \ of some number of GSPM payloads; finally, when\n   authentication is done, there\
    \ should be one final exchange where the\n   request includes the AUTH payload\
    \ (along with some number of GSPM\n   payloads) and the response contains AUTH,\

    \   depending on the method, it might be more.\n   The AUTH payload calculation\
