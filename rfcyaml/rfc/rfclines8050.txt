Abstract This document extends the Multi threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT) export format for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing information by supporting the advertisement of multiple paths in BGP extensions.
The MRT record format [RFC6396] was developed to provide researchers and engineers a means to encapsulate, export, and archive routing protocol transactions and RIB snapshots.
The Advertisement of Multiple Paths in BGP [RFC7911] defines a BGP extension to allow the advertisement of multiple paths for the same address prefix without the new paths implicitly replacing any previous ones.
This document contains an optional extension to the MRT format [RFC6396] and introduces additional definitions of MRT subtype fields to permit representation of multiple path advertisements [RFC7911].
Rationale MRT parsers are usually stateless.
In order to parse BGP messages that contain data structures that depend on the capabilities negotiated during the BGP session setup, the MRT subtypes are utilized.
The Advertisement of Multiple Paths [RFC7911] extension for BGP alters the encoding of the BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) format for withdraws and announcements.
Therefore, new BGP4MP/BGP4MP ET subtypes as defined in [RFC6396] are required to signal to an MRT parser how to parse the NLRI.
In Section 4.3 of the MRT specification [RFC6396], RIB subtypes are specified.
Prefix length and prefix fields are encoded in the same manner as the BGP NLRI encoding.
In order to support Path Identifier information as defined in [RFC7911], new subtypes need to be added.
The following two sections define the required subtypes.
MRT Subtypes for Types BGP4MP/BGP4MP ET
This document defines the following new subtypes:  BGP4MP MESSAGE ADDPATH  BGP4MP MESSAGE AS4 ADDPATH  BGP4MP MESSAGE LOCAL ADDPATH  BGP4MP MESSAGE
The fields of these message types are identical to the equivalent non additional path versions specified in Section 4.4 of [RFC6396].
These enhancements continue to encapsulate the entire BGP message in the BGP message field.
MRT Subtypes for Type TABLE DUMP V2
This document defines the following new subtypes:
The fields of these message types are identical to the equivalent non additional path versions specified in Section 4.3 of [RFC6396].
However, for the case of the 4 AFI/SAFI specific RIB subtypes, the existing RIB Entries field is redefined as detailed in the sections below.
In order to preserve the record compaction achieved by using the most common subtypes and allow multiple RIB Entries to be stored in a single TABLE DUMP V2 record, the existing RIB Entries field is redefined for use within the new AFI/SAFI specific RIB subtypes defined by this document as follows:
RIB Entries for AFI/SAFI Specific RIB Subtypes with Support for Additional Paths
This adds a field to the RIB Entries record to store the Path Identifier when used with the RIB IPV4 UNICAST ADDPATH, RIB IPV4 MULTICAST ADDPATH, RIB IPV6 UNICAST ADDPATH, and RIB IPV6 MULTICAST ADDPATH subtypes.
The fields of this subtype are identical to the equivalent non  additional path versions specified in Section 4.3.3 of [RFC6396].
These fields continue to encapsulate the raw and additional path  enabled AFI/SAFI/NLRI in the record, and the raw attributes in the RIB Entries.
For clarity, the RIB Entries in this subtype are not redefined.
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned the subtype codes defined below in the "Multi  threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT)
The following have been registered in the "BGP4MP Subtype Codes" and "BGP4MP ET Subtype Codes" registries: 8 BGP4MP MESSAGE ADDPATH (RFC 8050) 9 BGP4MP MESSAGE AS4 ADDPATH (RFC 8050) 10 BGP4MP MESSAGE LOCAL ADDPATH (RFC 8050) 11 BGP4MP MESSAGE AS4 LOCAL ADDPATH (RFC 8050) 5.2.
TABLE DUMP V2 Subtype Codes
The following have been registered in the "TABLE DUMP V2 Subtype Codes" registry: 8 RIB IPV4 UNICAST ADDPATH (RFC 8050) 9 RIB IPV4 MULTICAST ADDPATH (RFC 8050) 10 RIB IPV6 UNICAST ADDPATH (RFC 8050) 11 RIB IPV6 MULTICAST ADDPATH (RFC 8050) 12 RIB GENERIC ADDPATH (RFC 8050) 6.
It is not believed that this document adds any additional security considerations.
However, the security considerations of [RFC6396] are equally applicable to this document, because this document permits the export of more detailed routing data.
An organization that uses the MRT format to store their BGP routing information should be aware that supporting these extensions permits more detailed network path information to be stored and should consider the implications of this within their environment.
An organization that peers with public BGP collectors and enables the capability for additional paths on a peering session should be aware that it is exporting not only its best paths, but potentially other paths within its networks.
The BGP peer should consider any and all implications of exposing this additional data.
