- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document provides guidance to the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers\n   Authority (IANA) regarding the registration of values related to\
    \ the\n   Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), defined in [RFC2661], in\n   accordance\
    \ with BCP 26, [RFC2434].\n"
- title: 1.1 Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1 Terminology\n   The following terms are used here with the meanings defined\
    \ in\n   BCP 26:  \"name space\", \"assigned value\", \"registration\".\n   The\
    \ following policies are used here with the meanings defined in\n   BCP 26: \"\
    Private Use\", \"First Come First Served\", \"Expert Review\",\n   \"Specification\
    \ Required\", \"IETF Consensus\", \"Standards Action\".\n"
- title: 2. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2. IANA Considerations\n   L2TP [RFC2661] defines a number of \"magic\" numbers\
    \ to be maintained\n   by the IANA.  This section updates the criteria to be used\
    \ by the\n   IANA to assign additional numbers in each of these lists.\n   Each\
    \ of the values identified in this document that require a\n   registration criteria\
    \ update are currently maintained by IANA and\n   have a range of values from\
    \ 0 to 65 535, of which a very small number\n   have been allocated (the maximum\
    \ number allocated within any one\n   range is 46) [L2TP-IANA].  Given the nature\
    \ of these values, it is\n   not expected that any will ever run into a resource\
    \ allocation\n   problem if registration allocation requirements are relaxed from\n\
    \   their current state.\n   The recommended criteria changes for IANA registration\
    \ are listed in\n   the following sections.  In one case, the registration criteria\
    \ is\n   currently defined as First Come First Served and should be made more\n\
    \   strict, others are defined as IETF Consensus and need to be relaxed.\n   The\
    \ relaxation from IETF Consensus is motivated by specific cases in\n   which values\
    \ that were never intended to be vendor-specific have had\n   to enter early field\
    \ trials or be released in generally available\n   products with vendor-specific\
    \ values while awaiting documents to be\n   formalized.  In most cases, this results\
    \ in products that have to\n   support both the vendor-specific value and IETF\
    \ value indefinitely.\n   For registration requests where a Designated Expert\
    \ should be\n   consulted, the responsible IESG Area Director should appoint the\n\
    \   Designated Expert.\n   For registration requests requiring Expert Review,\
    \ the Designated\n   Expert should consult relevant WGs as appropriate (e.g.,\
    \ the l2tpext\n   WG at the time of this writing).\n   The basic guideline for\
    \ the Expert Review process will be to approve\n   the assignment of a value only\
    \ if there is a document being advanced\n   that clearly defines the values to\
    \ be assigned, and there is active\n   implementation development (perhaps entering\
    \ early field or\n   interoperability trails, requiring assigned values to proceed\
    \ without\n   having to resort to a chosen vendor-specific method).\n"
- title: 2.1 Control Message AVPs
  contents:
  - "2.1 Control Message AVPs\n   IANA manages the \"Control Message Attribute Value\
    \ Pairs\" [L2TP-IANA]\n   name space, of which 0 - 46 have been assigned.  The\
    \ criteria for\n   assignment was originally IETF Consensus.  Further values should\
    \ be\n   assigned upon Expert Review.\n"
- title: 2.2 Message Type AVP Values
  contents:
  - "2.2 Message Type AVP Values\n   IANA manages the \"Message Type AVP (Attribute\
    \ Type 0) Values\" [L2TP-\n   IANA] name space, of which 0 - 16 have been assigned.\
    \  The criteria\n   for assignment was originally IETF Consensus.  Further values\
    \ should\n   be assigned upon Expert Review.\n"
- title: 2.3 Result Code AVP Values
  contents:
  - "2.3 Result Code AVP Values\n   IANA maintains a list of \"Result Code values\
    \ for the StopCCN\n   message,\" \"Result Code values for the CDN message,\" and\
    \ \"General\n   Error Codes\" [L2TP-IANA].  The criteria for Error Code assignment\
    \ was\n   originally First Come First Served, and the criteria for CDN and\n \
    \  StopCCN Result Codes were originally IETF Consensus.  Further values\n   for\
    \ all Result and Error codes should be assigned upon Expert Review.\n"
- title: 2.4 Remaining Values
  contents:
  - "2.4 Remaining Values\n   All criteria for L2TP values maintained by IANA and\
    \ not mentioned\n   specifically in this document remain unchanged.\n"
