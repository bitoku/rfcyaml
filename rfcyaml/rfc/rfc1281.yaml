- title: Preamble
  contents:
  - "Preamble\n   The purpose of this document is to provide a set of guidelines to\
    \ aid\n   in the secure operation of the Internet.  During its history, the\n\
    \   Internet has grown significantly and is now quite diverse.  Its\n   participants\
    \ include government institutions and agencies, academic\n   and research institutions,\
    \ commercial network and electronic mail\n   carriers, non-profit research centers\
    \ and an increasing array of\n   industrial organizations who are primarily users\
    \ of the technology.\n   Despite this dramatic growth, the system is still operated\
    \ on a\n   purely collaborative basis.  Each participating network takes\n   responsibility\
    \ for its own operation.  Service providers, private\n   network operators, users\
    \ and vendors all cooperate to keep the system\n   functioning.\n   It is important\
    \ to recognize that the voluntary nature of the\n   Internet system is both its\
    \ strength and, perhaps, its most fragile\n   aspect.  Rules of operation, like\
    \ the rules of etiquette, are\n   voluntary and, largely, unenforceable, except\
    \ where they happen to\n   coincide with national laws, violation of which can\
    \ lead to\n   prosecution.  A common set of rules for the successful and\n   increasingly\
    \ secure operation of the Internet can, at best, be\n   voluntary, since the laws\
    \ of various countries are not uniform\n   regarding data networking.  Indeed,\
    \ the guidelines outlined below\n   also can be only voluntary.  However, since\
    \ joining the Internet is\n   optional, it is also fair to argue that any Internet\
    \ rules of\n   behavior are part of the bargain for joining and that failure to\n\
    \   observe them, apart from any legal infrastructure available, are\n   grounds\
    \ for sanctions.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   These guidelines address the entire Internet community, consisting\
    \ of\n   users, hosts, local, regional, domestic and international backbone\n\
    \   networks, and vendors who supply operating systems, routers, network\n   management\
    \ tools, workstations and other network components.\n   Security is understood\
    \ to include protection of the privacy of\n   information, protection of information\
    \ against unauthorized\n   modification, protection of systems against denial\
    \ of service, and\n   protection of systems against unauthorized access.\n   These\
    \ guidelines encompass six main points.  These points are\n   repeated and elaborated\
    \ in the next section.  In addition, a\n   bibliography of computer and network\
    \ related references has been\n   provided at the end of this document for use\
    \ by the reader.\n Security Guidelines\n   (1)  Users are individually responsible\
    \ for understanding and\n        respecting the security policies of the systems\
    \ (computers and\n        networks) they are using.  Users are individually accountable\n\
    \        for their own behavior.\n   (2)  Users have a responsibility to employ\
    \ available security\n        mechanisms and procedures for protecting their own\
    \ data.  They\n        also have a responsibility for assisting in the protection\
    \ of\n        the systems they use.\n   (3)  Computer and network service providers\
    \ are responsible for\n        maintaining the security of the systems they operate.\
    \  They are\n        further responsible for notifying users of their security\n\
    \        policies and any changes to these policies.\n   (4)  Vendors and system\
    \ developers are responsible for providing\n        systems which are sound and\
    \ which embody adequate security\n        controls.\n   (5)  Users, service providers,\
    \ and hardware and software vendors are\n        responsible for cooperating to\
    \ provide security.\n   (6)  Technical improvements in Internet security protocols\
    \ should be\n        sought on a continuing basis.  At the same time, personnel\n\
    \        developing new protocols, hardware or software for the Internet\n   \
    \     are expected to include security considerations as part of the\n       \
    \ design and development process.\n"
- title: Elaboration
  contents:
  - "Elaboration\n   (1)  Users are individually responsible for understanding and\n\
    \        respecting the security policies of the systems (computers and\n    \
    \    networks) they are using.  Users are individually accountable\n        for\
    \ their own behavior.\n        Users are responsible for their own behavior. \
    \ Weaknesses in\n        the security of a system are not a license to penetrate\
    \ or\n        abuse a system.  Users are expected to be aware of the security\n\
    \        policies of computers and networks which they access and to\n       \
    \ adhere to these policies.  One clear consequence of this\n        guideline\
    \ is that unauthorized access to a computer or use of a\n        network is explicitly\
    \ a violation of Internet rules of conduct,\n        no matter how weak the protection\
    \ of those computers or networks.\n        There is growing international attention\
    \ to legal prohibition\n        against unauthorized access to computer systems,\
    \ and several\n        countries have recently passed legislation that addresses\
    \ the\n        area (e.g., United Kingdom, Australia).  In the United States,\n\
    \        the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, Title 18 U.S.C.\n        section\
    \ 1030 makes it a crime, in certain situations, to access\n        a Federal interest\
    \ computer (federal government computers,\n        financial institution computers,\
    \ and a computer which is one of\n        two or more computers used in committing\
    \ the offense, not all of\n        which are located in the same state) without\
    \ authorization.\n        Most of the 50 states in the U.S have similar laws.\n\
    \        Another aspect of this part of the policy is that users are\n       \
    \ individually responsible for all use of resources assigned to\n        them,\
    \ and hence sharing of accounts and access to resources is\n        strongly discouraged.\
    \  However, since access to resources is\n        assigned by individual sites\
    \ and network operators, the\n        specific rules governing sharing of accounts\
    \ and protection of\n        access is necessarily a local matter.\n   (2)  Users\
    \ have a responsibility to employ available security\n        mechanisms and procedures\
    \ for protecting their own data.  They\n        also have a responsibility for\
    \ assisting in the protection of\n        the systems they use.\n        Users\
    \ are expected to handle account privileges in a\n        responsible manner and\
    \ to follow site procedures for the\n        security of their data as well as\
    \ that of the system.  For\n        systems which rely upon password protection,\
    \ users should\n        select good passwords and periodically change them.  Proper\n\
    \        use of file protection mechanisms (e.g., access control lists)\n    \
    \    so as to define and maintain appropriate file access control\n        is\
    \ also part of this responsibility.\n   (3)  Computer and network service providers\
    \ are responsible for\n        maintaining the security of the systems they operate.\
    \  They are\n        further responsible for notifying users of their security\n\
    \        policies and any changes to these policies.\n        A computer or network\
    \ service provider may manage resources on\n        behalf of users within an\
    \ organization (e.g., provision of\n        network and computer services with\
    \ a university) or it may\n        provide services to a larger, external community\
    \ (e.g., a\n        regional network provider).  These resources may include host\n\
    \        computers employed by users, routers, terminal servers, personal\n  \
    \      computers or other devices that have access to the Internet.\n        Because\
    \ the Internet itself is neither centrally managed nor\n        operated, responsibility\
    \ for security rests with the owners and\n        operators of the subscriber\
    \ components of the Internet.\n        Moreover, even if there were a central\
    \ authority for this\n        infrastructure, security necessarily is the responsibility\
    \ of\n        the owners and operators of the systems which are the primary\n\
    \        data and processing resources of the Internet.\n        There are tradeoffs\
    \ between stringent security measures at a\n        site and ease of use of systems\
    \ (e.g., stringent security\n        measures may complicate user access to the\
    \ Internet).  If a site\n        elects to operate an unprotected, open system,\
    \ it may be\n        providing a platform for attacks on other Internet hosts\
    \ while\n        concealing the attacker's identity.  Sites which do operate\n\
    \        open systems are nonetheless responsible for the behavior of\n      \
    \  the systems' users and should be prepared to render assistance\n        to\
    \ other sites when needed.  Whenever possible, sites should\n        try to ensure\
    \ authenticated Internet access.  The readers are\n        directed to appendix\
    \ A for a brief descriptive list of elements\n        of good security.\n    \
    \    Sites (including network service providers) are encouraged to\n        develop\
    \ security policies.  These policies should be clearly\n        communicated to\
    \ users and subscribers.  The Site Security\n        Handbook (FYI 8, RFC 1244)\
    \ provides useful information and\n        guidance on developing good security\
    \ policies and procedures\n        at both the site and network level.\n   (4)\
    \  Vendors and system developers are responsible for providing\n        systems\
    \ which are sound and which embody adequate security\n        controls.\n    \
    \    A vendor or system developer should evaluate each system in\n        terms\
    \ of security controls prior to the introduction of the\n        system into the\
    \ Internet community.  Each product (whether\n        offered for sale or freely\
    \ distributed) should describe the\n        security features it incorporates.\n\
    \        Vendors and system developers have an obligation to repair\n        flaws\
    \ in the security relevant portions of the systems they\n        sell (or freely\
    \ provide) for use in the Internet.  They are\n        expected to cooperate with\
    \ the Internet community in\n        establishing mechanisms for the reporting\
    \ of security flaws and\n        in making security-related fixes available to\
    \ the community in\n        a timely fashion.\n   (5)  Users, service providers,\
    \ and hardware and software vendors are\n        responsible for cooperating to\
    \ provide security.\n        The Internet is a cooperative venture.  The culture\
    \ and\n        practice in the Internet is to render assistance in security\n\
    \        matters to other sites and networks.  Each site is expected to\n    \
    \    notify other sites if it detects a penetration in progress at\n        the\
    \ other sites, and all sites are expected to help one another\n        respond\
    \ to security violations.  This assistance may include\n        tracing connections,\
    \ tracking violators and assisting law\n        enforcement efforts.\n       \
    \ There is a growing appreciation within the Internet community\n        that\
    \ security violators should be identified and held\n        accountable.  This\
    \ means that once a violation has been detected,\n        sites are encouraged\
    \ to cooperate in finding the violator and\n        assisting in enforcement efforts.\
    \  It is recognized that many\n        sites will face a trade-off between securing\
    \ their sites as\n        rapidly as possible versus leaving their site open in\
    \ the hopes\n        of identifying the violator.  Sites will also be faced with\
    \ the\n        dilemma of limiting the knowledge of a penetration versus\n   \
    \     exposing the fact that a penetration has occurred.  This policy\n      \
    \  does not dictate that a site must expose either its system or\n        its\
    \ reputation if it decides not to, but sites are encouraged\n        to render\
    \ as much assistance as they can.\n   (6)  Technical improvements in Internet\
    \ security protocols should be\n        sought on a continuing basis.  At the\
    \ same time, personnel\n        developing new protocols, hardware or software\
    \ for the Internet\n        are expected to include security considerations as\
    \ part of the\n        design and development process.\n        The points discussed\
    \ above are all administrative in nature,\n        but technical advances are\
    \ also important.  Existing protocols\n        and operating systems do not provide\
    \ the level of security that\n        is desired and feasible today.  Three types\
    \ of advances are\n        encouraged:\n        (a)  Improvements should be made\
    \ in the basic security\n             mechanisms already in place.  Password security\
    \ is\n             generally poor throughout the Internet and can be\n       \
    \      improved markedly through the use of tools to administer\n            \
    \ password assignment and through the use of better\n             authentication\
    \ technology.  At the same time, the\n             Internet user population is\
    \ expanding to include a\n             larger percentage of technically unsophisticated\
    \ users.\n             Security defaults on delivered systems and the controls\n\
    \             for administering security must be geared to this growing\n    \
    \         population.\n         (b)  Security extensions to the protocol suite\
    \ are needed.\n              Candidate protocols which should be augmented to\
    \ improve\n              security include network management, routing, file\n\
    \              transfer, telnet, and mail.\n         (c)  The design and implementation\
    \ of operating systems should\n              be improved to place more emphasis\
    \ on security and pay\n              more attention to the quality of the implementation\
    \ of\n              security within systems on the Internet.\n"
- title: APPENDIX A
  contents:
  - "APPENDIX A\n   Five areas should be addressed in improving local security:\n\
    \   (1)  There must be a clear statement of the local security policy,\n     \
    \   and this policy must be communicated to the users and other\n        relevant\
    \ parties.  The policy should be on file and available\n        to users at all\
    \ times, and should be communicated to users as\n        part of providing access\
    \ to the system.\n   (2)  Adequate security controls must be implemented.  At\
    \ a minimum,\n        this means controlling access to systems via passwords,\n\
    \        instituting sound password management, and configuring the\n        system\
    \ to protect itself and the information within it.\n   (3)  There must be a capability\
    \ to monitor security compliance and\n        respond to incidents involving violation\
    \ of security.  Logs of\n        logins, attempted logins, and other security-relevant\
    \ events\n        are strongly advised, as well as regular audit of these logs.\n\
    \        Also recommended is a capability to trace connections and other\n   \
    \     events in response to penetrations.  However, it is important\n        for\
    \ service providers to have a well thought out and published\n        policy about\
    \ what information they gather, who has access to it\n        and for what purposes.\
    \  Maintaining the privacy of network\n        users should be kept in mind when\
    \ developing such a policy.\n   (4)  There must be an established chain of communication\
    \ and control\n        to handle security matters.  A responsible person should\
    \ be\n        identified as the security contact.  The means for reaching the\n\
    \        security contact should be made known to all users and should\n     \
    \   be registered in public directories, and it should be easy for\n        computer\
    \ emergency response centers to find contact information\n        at any time.\n\
    \        The security contact should be familiar with the technology and\n   \
    \     configuration of all systems at the site or should be able to\n        get\
    \ in touch with those who have this knowledge at any time.\n        Likewise,\
    \ the security contact should be pre-authorized to make\n        a best effort\
    \ to deal with a security incident, or should be\n        able to contact those\
    \ with the authority at any time.\n   (5)  Sites and networks which are notified\
    \ of security incidents\n        should respond in a timely and effective manner.\
    \  In the case\n        of penetrations or other violations, sites and networks\
    \ should\n        allocate resources and capabilities to identify the nature of\n\
    \        the incident and limit the damage.  A site or network cannot be\n   \
    \     considered to have good security if it does not respond to\n        incidents\
    \ in a timely and effective fashion.\n        If a violator can be identified,\
    \ appropriate action should be\n        taken to ensure that no further violations\
    \ are caused.  Exactly\n        what sanctions should be brought against a violator\
    \ depend on\n        the nature of the incident and the site environment.  For\n\
    \        example, a university may choose to bring internal disciplinary\n   \
    \     action against a student violator.\n        Similarly, sites and networks\
    \ should respond when notified of\n        security flaws in their systems.  Sites\
    \ and networks have the\n        responsibility to install fixes in their systems\
    \ as they become\n        available.\n"
