- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In the course of reviewing the MTU Discovery protocol for possible\n\
    \   elevation to Draft Standard, a specific operational problem was\n   uncovered.\
    \  The problem results from the optional suppression of ICMP\n   messages implemented\
    \ in some routers.  This memo outlines a\n   modification to this practice to\
    \ allow the correct functioning of MTU\n   Discovery.\n"

  - "Advice on the Deployment of Path MTU Discovery Protocol\n   While reviewing the\
    \ Path MTU Discovery Protocol for Draft Standard\n   [RFC1191], the Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG) became\n   aware from the reports of various implementors\
    \ that some vendors have\n   added to their routers the ability to disable ICMP\
    \ messages generated\n   by the router.  This is to protect older BSD hosts, which\
    \ would drop\n   all connections to a host it found an ICMP message on any of\
    \ the\n   connections, even if it was a non-fatal ICMP message.  While this\n\
    \   protects older BSD hosts, it causes MTU discovery to fail in a\n   silent,\
    \ hard to diagnose way.\n   From the descriptions the IESG has obtained, adjusting\
    \ the routers to\n   continue to send ICMP message Type 3 code 4 (destination\
    \ unreachable,\n   don't fragment (DF) bit sent and fragmentation required) even\
    \ when\n   they have their \"don't send ICMP messages\" switch turned on would\n\
    \   allow path MTU discovery to work but not effect older BSD hosts,\n   since\
    \ they never set the DF bit in their packets.\n"
