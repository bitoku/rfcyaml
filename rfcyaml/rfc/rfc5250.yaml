  - "1.  Introduction\n   Over the last several years, the OSPF routing protocol [OSPF]
    has\n   been widely deployed throughout the Internet.  As a result of this\n   deployment
    and the evolution of networking technology, OSPF has been\n   extended to support
    many options; this evolution will obviously\n   continue.\n   This document defines
    enhancements to the OSPF protocol to support a\n   new class of link state advertisements
    (LSAs) called Opaque LSAs.\n   Opaque LSAs provide a generalized mechanism to
    allow for the future\n   extensibility of OSPF.  The information contained in
    Opaque LSAs may\n   be used directly by OSPF or indirectly by some application
    wishing to\n   distribute information throughout the OSPF domain.  The exact use
    of\n   Opaque LSAs is beyond the scope of this document.\n   Opaque LSAs consist
    of a standard LSA header followed by a 32-bit\n   aligned application-specific
    information field.  Like any other LSA,\n   the Opaque LSA uses the link-state
    database distribution mechanism\n   for flooding this information throughout the
    topology.  The link-\n   state type field of the Opaque LSA identifies the LSA's
    range of\n   topological distribution.  This range is referred to as the flooding\n
    \  scope.\n   It is envisioned that an implementation of the Opaque option provides\n
    \  an application interface for 1) encapsulating application-specific\n   information
    in a specific Opaque type, 2) sending and receiving\n   application-specific information,
    and 3) if required, informing the\n   application of the change in validity of
    previously received\n   information when topological changes are detected.\n"

  - "3.  The Opaque LSA\n   Opaque LSAs are types 9, 10, and 11 link state advertisements.\n
    \  Opaque LSAs consist of a standard LSA header followed by a 32-bit\n   aligned
    application-specific information field.  Standard link-state\n   database flooding
    mechanisms are used for distribution of Opaque\n   LSAs.  The range of topological
    distribution (i.e., the flooding\n   scope) of an Opaque LSA is identified by
    its link-state type.  This\n   section documents the flooding of Opaque LSAs.\n
    \  The flooding scope associated with each Opaque link-state type is\n   defined
    as follows.\n   o  Link-state type-9 denotes a link-local scope.  Type-9 Opaque
    LSAs\n      are not flooded beyond the local (sub)network.\n   o  Link-state type-10
    denotes an area-local scope.  Type-10 Opaque\n      LSAs are not flooded beyond
    the borders of their associated area.\n   o  Link-state type-11 denotes that the
    LSA is flooded throughout the\n      Autonomous System (AS).  The flooding scope
    of type-11 LSAs are\n      equivalent to the flooding scope of AS-External (type-5)
    LSAs.\n      Specifically, type-11 Opaque LSAs are 1) flooded throughout all\n
    \     transit areas, 2) not flooded into stub areas or Not-So-Stubby\n      Areas
    (NSSAs), see [NSSA], from the backbone, and 3) not\n      originated by routers
    into their connected stub areas or NSSAs.\n      As with type-5 LSAs, if a type-11
    Opaque LSA is received in a stub\n      area or NSSA from a neighboring router
    within the stub area or\n      NSSA, the LSA is rejected.\n   The link-state ID
    of the Opaque LSA is divided into an Opaque type\n   field (the first 8 bits)
    and a type-specific ID (the remaining 24\n   bits).  The packet format of the
    Opaque LSA is given in Appendix A.\n   Section 7 describes Opaque type allocation
    and assignment.\n   The responsibility for proper handling of the Opaque LSA's
    flooding\n   scope is placed on both the sender and receiver of the LSA.  The\n
    \  receiver must always store a valid received Opaque LSA in its link-\n   state
    database.  The receiver must not accept Opaque LSAs that\n   violate the flooding
    scope (e.g., a type-11 (domain-wide) Opaque LSA\n   is not accepted in a stub
    area or NSSA).  The flooding scope affects\n   both the synchronization of the
    link-state database and the flooding\n   procedure.\n   The following describes
    the modifications to these procedures that\n   are necessary to insure conformance
    to the Opaque LSA's Scoping\n   Rules.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Flooding Opaque LSAs\n   The flooding of Opaque LSAs MUST follow the
      rules of flooding scope\n   as specified in this section.  Section 13 of [OSPF]
      describes the\n   OSPF flooding procedure.  Those procedures MUST be followed
      as\n   defined except where modified in this section.  The following\n   describes
      the Opaque LSA's type-specific flooding restrictions.\n   o  If the Opaque LSA
      is type-9 (the flooding scope is link-local) and\n      the interface that the
      LSA was received on is not the same as the\n      target interface (e.g., the
      interface associated with a particular\n      target neighbor), the Opaque LSA
      MUST be discarded and not\n      acknowledged.  An implementation SHOULD keep
      track of the IP\n      interface associated with each Opaque LSA having a link-local\n
      \     flooding scope.\n   o  If the Opaque LSA is type-10 (the flooding scope
      is area-local)\n      and the area associated with the Opaque LSA (as identified
      during\n      origination or from a received LSA's associated OSPF packet\n
      \     header) is not the same as the area associated with the target\n      interface,
      the Opaque LSA MUST be discarded and not acknowledged.\n      An implementation
      SHOULD keep track of the OSPF area associated\n      with each Opaque LSA having
      an area-local flooding scope.\n   o  If the Opaque LSA is type-11 (the LSA is
      flooded throughout the\n      AS) and the target interface is associated with
      a stub area or\n      NSSA, the Opaque LSA MUST NOT be flooded out the interface.
      \ A\n      type-11 Opaque LSA that is received on an interface associated\n
      \     with a stub area or NSSA MUST be discarded and not acknowledged\n      (the
      neighboring router has flooded the LSA in error).\n   When opaque-capable routers
      and non-opaque-capable OSPF routers are\n   mixed together in a routing domain,
      the Opaque LSAs are typically not\n   flooded to the non-opaque-capable routers.
      \ As a general design\n   principle, optional OSPF advertisements are only flooded
      to those\n   routers that understand them.\n   An opaque-capable router learns
      of its neighbor's opaque capability\n   at the beginning of the \"Database Exchange
      Process\" (see Section 10.6\n   of [OSPF] regarding receiving Database Description
      packets from a\n   neighbor in state ExStart).  A neighbor is opaque-capable
      if and only\n   if it sets the O-bit in the Options field of its Database Description\n
      \  packets; the O-bit SHOULD NOT be set and MUST be ignored when\n   received
      in packets other than Database Description packets.  Using\n   the O-bit in
      OSPF packets other than Database Description packets\n   will result in interoperability
      issues.  The setting of the O-bit is\n   a \"SHOULD NOT\" rather than a \"MUST
      NOT\" to remain compatible with\n   earlier specifications.\n   In the next
      step of the Database Exchange process, Opaque LSAs are\n   included in the Database
      summary list that is sent to the neighbor\n   (see Sections 3.2 below and 10.3
      of [OSPF]) when the neighbor is\n   opaque capable.\n   When flooding Opaque
      LSAs to adjacent neighbors, an opaque-capable\n   router looks at the neighbor's
      opaque capability.  Opaque LSAs are\n   only flooded to opaque-capable neighbors.
      \ To be more precise, in\n   Section 13.3 of [OSPF], Opaque LSAs MUST be placed
      on the link-state\n   retransmission lists of opaque-capable neighbors and MUST
      NOT be\n   placed on the link-state retransmission lists of non-opaque-capable\n
      \  neighbors.  However, when sending Link State Update packets as\n   multicasts,
      a non-opaque-capable neighbor may (inadvertently) receive\n   Opaque LSAs.  The
      non-opaque-capable router will then simply discard\n   the LSA (see Section
      13 of [OSPF] regarding receiving LSAs having\n   unknown LS types).\n   Information
      contained in received Opaque LSAs SHOULD only be used\n   when the router originating
      the LSA is reachable.  As mentioned in\n   [OSPFv3], reachability validation
      MAY be done less frequently than\n   every SPF calculation.  Additionally, routers
      processing received\n   Opaque LSAs MAY choose to give priority to processing
      base OSPF LSA\n   types over Opaque LSA types.\n"

      it exists in Section 10.3 of [OSPF] remains\n   unchanged except for the action
      associated with State: ExStart,\n   Event: NegotiationDone, which is where the

      of the\n               Router LSAs, Network LSAs, Summary LSAs, type-9 Opaque\n

      a stub\n               area or NSSA (see Section 3.6 of [OSPF]).\n               Type-9
      Opaque LSAs MUST be omitted from the Database\n               summary list if
      the interface associated with the\n               neighbor is not the interface

      \              Any advertisement whose age is equal to MaxAge MUST be\n               omitted
      from the Database summary list.  It MUST instead\n               be added to
      the neighbor's link-state retransmission\n               list.  A summary of
      the Database summary list will be\n               sent to the neighbor in Database

    title: 4.1.  Additions to the OSPF Neighbor Structure
  title: 4.  Protocol Data Structures
- contents:
  - "5.  Inter-Area Considerations\n   As defined above, link-state type-11 Opaque
    LSAs are flooded\n   throughout the Autonomous System (AS).  One issue related
    to such\n   AS-scoped Opaque LSAs is that there must be a way for OSPF routers
    in\n   remote areas to check availability of the LSA originator.\n   Specifically,
    if an OSPF router originates a type-11 LSA and, after\n   that, goes out of service,
    OSPF routers located outside of the\n   originator's OSPF area have no way of
    detecting this fact and may use\n   the stale information for a considerable period
    of time (up to 60\n   minutes).  This could prove to be suboptimal for some applications\n
    \  and may result in others not functioning.\n   Type-9 Opaque LSAs and type-10
    Opaque LSAs do not have this problem\n   as a receiving router can detect if the
    advertising router is\n   reachable within the LSA's respective flooding scope.
    \ In the case of\n   type-9 LSAs, the originating router must be an OSPF neighbor
    in\n   Exchange state or greater.  In the case of type-10 Opaque LSAs, the\n   intra-area
    SPF calculation will determine the advertising router's\n   reachability.\n   There
    is a parallel issue in OSPF for the AS-scoped AS External LSAs\n   (type-5 LSAs).
    \ OSPF addresses this by using AS border information\n   advertised in AS boundary
    router (ASBR) Summary LSAs (type-4 LSAs);\n   see Section 16.4 of [OSPF].  This
    same mechanism is reused by this\n   document for type-11 Opaque LSAs.\n   To
    enable OSPF routers in remote areas to check availability of the\n   originator
    of link-state type-11 Opaque LSAs, the originators\n   advertise themselves as
    ASBRs.  This will enable routers to track the\n   reachability of the LSA originator
    either directly via the SPF\n   calculation (for routers in the same area) or
    indirectly via type-4\n   LSAs originated by ABRs (for routers in other areas).
    \ It is\n   important to note that per [OSPF], this solution does not apply to\n
    \  OSPF stub areas or NSSAs as AS-scoped Opaque LSAs are not flooded\n   into
    these area types.\n   The procedures related to inter-area Opaque LSAs are as
    follows:\n   (1) An OSPF router that is configured to originate AS-scope opaque\n
    \      LSAs will advertise itself as an ASBR and MUST follow the\n       requirements
    related to setting of the Options field E-bit in\n       OSPF LSA headers as specified
    in [OSPF].\n   (2) When processing a received type-11 Opaque LSA, the router MUST\n
    \      look up the routing table entries (potentially one per attached\n       area)
    for the ASBR that originated the LSA.  If no entries exist\n       for the ASBR
    (i.e., the ASBR is unreachable), the router MUST do\n       nothing with this
    LSA.  It also MUST discontinue using all Opaque\n       LSAs injected into the
    network by the same originator whenever it\n       is detected that the originator
    is unreachable.\n"

    support for Opaque\n   LSAs and SHOULD be used to support implementations of this

    \  section, implementations supporting [RFC4750] will also include\n   Opaque

    no interoperability\n   issues.  In the case that a non-opaque-capable neighbor
    receives\n   Opaque LSAs, per [OSPF], the non-opaque-capable router will simply\n
    \  discard the LSA.\n   Note that OSPF routers that implement [RFC2370] will continue
    using\n   stale type-11 LSAs even when the LSA originator implements the\n   inter-area
    procedures described in Section 6 of this document.\n"
  title: 7.  Backward Compatibility
- contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are two types of issues that need be addressed
    when looking at\n   protecting routing protocols from misconfigurations and malicious\n
    \  attacks.  The first is authentication and certification of routing\n   protocol
    information.  The second is denial-of-service attacks\n   resulting from repetitive
    origination of the same router\n   advertisement or origination of a large number
    of distinct\n   advertisements resulting in database overflow.  Note that both
    of\n   these concerns exist independently of a router's support for the\n   Opaque
    option.\n   To address the authentication concerns, OSPF protocol exchanges are\n
    \  authenticated.  OSPF supports multiple types of authentication; the\n   type
    of authentication in use can be configured on a per-network-\n   segment basis.
    \ One of OSPF's authentication types, namely the\n   Cryptographic authentication
    option, is believed to be secure against\n   passive attacks and provide significant
    protection against active\n   attacks.  When using the Cryptographic authentication
    option, each\n   router appends a \"message digest\" to its transmitted OSPF packets.\n
    \  Receivers then use the shared secret key and received digest to\n   verify
    that each received OSPF packet is authentic.\n   The quality of the security provided
    by the Cryptographic\n   authentication option depends completely on the strength
    of the\n   message digest algorithm (MD5 is currently the only message digest\n
    \  algorithm specified), the strength of the key being used, and the\n   correct
    implementation of the security mechanism in all communicating\n   OSPF implementations.
    \ It also requires that all parties maintain the\n   secrecy of the shared secret
    key.  None of the standard OSPF\n   authentication types provide confidentiality.
    \ Nor do they protect\n   against traffic analysis.  For more information on the
    standard OSPF\n   security mechanisms, see Sections 8.1, 8.2, and Appendix D of
    [OSPF].\n   Repetitive origination of advertisements is addressed by OSPF by\n
    \  mandating a limit on the frequency that new instances of any\n   particular
    LSA can be originated and accepted during the flooding\n   procedure.  The frequency
    at which new LSA instances may be\n   originated is set equal to once every MinLSInterval
    seconds, whose\n   value is 5 seconds (see Section 12.4 of [OSPF]).  The frequency
    at\n   which new LSA instances are accepted during flooding is once every\n   MinLSArrival
    seconds, whose value is set to 1 (see Section 13,\n   Appendix B, and G.5 of [OSPF]).\n
    \  Proper operation of the OSPF protocol requires that all OSPF routers\n   maintain
    an identical copy of the OSPF link-state database.  However,\n   when the size
    of the link-state database becomes very large, some\n   routers may be unable
    to keep the entire database due to resource\n   shortages; we term this \"database
    overflow\".  When database overflow\n   is anticipated, the routers with limited
    resources can be\n   accommodated by configuring OSPF stub areas and NSSAs.  [OVERFLOW]\n

    \  In the case of type-11 Opaque LSAs, this document reuses an ASBR\n   tracking
    mechanism that is already employed in basic OSPF for type-5\n   LSAs.  Therefore,
    applying it to type-11 Opaque LSAs does not create\n   any threats that are not
    already known for type-5 LSAs.\n"

    Options Field followed by\n   the packet format of the Opaque LSA.\n"
  - contents:
    - "A.1.  The Options Field\n   The OSPF Options field is present in OSPF Hello
      packets, Database\n   Description packets, and all link state advertisements.
      \ The Options\n   field enables OSPF routers to support (or not support) optional\n
      \  capabilities, and to communicate their capability level to other OSPF\n   routers.
      \ Through this mechanism, routers of differing capabilities\n   can be mixed
      within an OSPF routing domain.\n   When used in Hello packets, the Options field
      allows a router to\n   reject a neighbor because of a capability mismatch.  Alternatively,\n
      \  when capabilities are exchanged in Database Description packets a\n   router
      can choose not to flood certain link state advertisements to a\n   neighbor
      because of its reduced functionality.  Lastly, listing\n   capabilities in link
      state advertisements allows routers to forward\n   traffic around reduced functionality
      routers by excluding them from\n   parts of the routing table calculation.\n
      \  All 8 bits of the OSPF Options field have been assigned, although\n   only
      the O-bit is described completely by this document.  Each bit is\n   described
      briefly below.  Routers SHOULD reset (i.e., clear)\n   unrecognized bits in
      the Options field when sending Hello packets or\n   Database Description packets
      and when originating link state\n   advertisements.  Conversely, routers encountering
      unrecognized Option\n   bits in received Hello Packets, Database Description
      packets, or link\n   state advertisements SHOULD ignore the capability and process
      the\n   packet/advertisement normally.\n                +--------------------------------------+\n

      LSAs are flooded, as\n        described in Sections 3.6, 9.5, 10.8, and 12.1.2

      router's willingness to receive and\n        forward External-Attributes-LSAs.
      \ While defined, the documents\n        specifying this bit have all expired.
      \ The use of this bit may\n        be deprecated in the future.\n   O-bit\n

      Opaque LSAs as specified in this document.\n   DN-bit\n        This bit is used

    - "A.2.  The Opaque LSA\n   Opaque LSAs are Type 9, 10, and 11 link state advertisements.
      \ These\n   advertisements MAY be used directly by OSPF or indirectly by some\n
      \  application wishing to distribute information throughout the OSPF\n   domain.
      \ The function of the Opaque LSA option is to provide for\n   future OSPF extensibility.\n
      \  Opaque LSAs contain some number of octets (of application-specific\n   data)
      padded to 32-bit alignment.  Like any other LSA, the Opaque LSA\n   uses the
      link-state database distribution mechanism for flooding this\n   information
      throughout the topology.  However, the Opaque LSA has a\n   flooding scope associated
      with it so that the scope of flooding may\n   be link-local (type-9), area-local
      (type-10), or the entire OSPF\n   routing domain (type-11).  Section 3 of this

      types.\n      o  A value of 9 denotes a link-local scope.  Opaque LSAs with
      a\n         link-local scope MUST NOT be flooded beyond the local\n         (sub)network.\n
      \     o  A value of 10 denotes an area-local scope.  Opaque LSAs with an\n         area-local
      scope MUST NOT be flooded beyond their area of\n         origin.\n      o  A
      value of 11 denotes that the LSA is flooded throughout the\n         Autonomous
      System (e.g., has the same scope as type-5 LSAs).\n         Opaque LSAs with
      AS-wide scope MUST NOT be flooded into stub\n         areas or NSSAs.\n   Syntax
      of the Opaque LSA's Link-State ID\n      The link-state ID of the Opaque LSA
      is divided into an Opaque Type\n      field (the first 8 bits) and an Opaque
      ID (the remaining 24 bits).\n      See section 7 of this document for a description
      of Opaque type\n      allocation and assignment.\n"
