  - "1.  Introduction\n   Syndicated Web feeds (using formats such as Atom [1]) are
    often split\n   into multiple documents to save bandwidth, allow \"sliding window\"\n
    \  access, or for other purposes.\n   This specification formalizes two types
    of feeds that can span one or\n   more feed documents; \"paged\" feeds and \"archived\"
    feeds.\n   Additionally, it defines \"complete\" feeds to cover the case when
    a\n   single feed document explicitly represents all of the feed's entries.\n
    \  Each has different properties and trade-offs:\n   o  Complete feeds contain
    the entire set of entries in one document,\n      and can be useful when it isn't
    desirable to \"remember\"\n      previously-seen entries.\n   o  Paged feeds split
    the entries among multiple temporary documents.\n      This can be useful when
    entries in the feed are not long-lived or\n      stable, and the client needs
    to access an arbitrary portion of\n      them, usually in close succession.\n
    \  o  Archived feeds split the entries among multiple permanent\n      documents
    and can be useful when entries are long-lived, and it is\n      important for
    clients to see every one.\n   The semantics of a feed that combines these types
    is undefined by\n   this specification.\n   Although they refer to Atom normatively,
    the mechanisms described\n   herein can be used with similar syndication formats;
    see Appendix B\n   for one such use.\n"

    - "1.1.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
      \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
      and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119 [2].\n   This specification uses XML Namespaces [3] to uniquely identify
      XML\n   element names.  It uses the following namespace prefix for the\n   indicated
      namespace URI;\n   \"fh\": \"http://purl.org/syndication/history/1.0\"\n"

  - contents:
    - "1.2.  Terminology\n   In this specification, \"feed document\" refers to an
      Atom Feed\n   Document or similar syndication instance document.  It may contain\n
      \  any number of entries, and may or may not be a complete\n   representation
      of the logical feed.\n   A \"logical feed\" is the complete set of entries associated
      with a\n   feed (as contrasted with a feed document, which may contain a subset\n
      \  of entries).\n   \"Head section\" refers to a document's feed-wide metadata
      container;\n   e.g., the child elements of the atom:feed element in an Atom
      Feed\n   Document.\n   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset [4].
      \ However,\n   this specification uses a shorthand; the phrase \"Information
      Item\" is\n   omitted when naming Element Information Items.  Therefore, when
      this\n   specification uses the term \"element,\" it is referring to an Element\n
      \  Information Item in Infoset terms.\n   This specification also uses Atom
      link relations to identify\n   different types of links; see the Atom specification
      [1] for\n   information about their syntax, and the IANA link relation registry\n
      \  for more information about specific values.\n   Note that URI references
      in link relation values may be relative, and\n   when they are used they must
      be absolutised, as described in Section\n   5.1 of [5].\n"

  - "2.  Complete Feeds\n   A complete feed is a feed document that contains all of
    the entries\n   of a logical feed; any entry not actually in the feed document
    SHOULD\n   NOT be considered part of that feed.\n   For example, a feed that represents
    a ranking that varies over time\n   (such as \"Top Twenty Records\" or \"Most
    Popular Items\") should not\n   have newer entries displayed alongside older ones.
    \ By marking this\n   feed as complete, old entries are discarded when it is refreshed.\n
    \  The fh:complete element, when present in a feed's head section,\n   indicates
    that the feed document it occurs in is a complete\n   representation of the logical
    feed's entries.  It is an empty\n   element; this specification does not define
    any content for it.\n   Example: Atom-formatted Complete Feed\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\"
    encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n   <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"\n    xmlns:fh=\"http://purl.org/syndication/history/1.0\">\n

  - "3.  Paged Feeds\n   A paged feed is a set of linked feed documents that together
    contain\n   the entries of a logical feed, without any guarantees about the\n
    \  stability of each document's contents.\n   Paged feeds are lossy; that is,
    it is not possible to guarantee that\n   clients will be able to reconstruct the
    contents of the logical feed\n   at a particular time.  Entries may be added or
    changed as the pages\n   of the feed are accessed, without the client becoming
    aware of them.\n   Therefore, clients SHOULD NOT present paged feeds as coherent
    or\n   complete, or make assumptions to that effect.\n   Paged feeds can be useful
    when the number of entries is very large,\n   infinite, or indeterminate.  Clients
    can \"page\" through the feed,\n   only accessing a subset of the feed's entries
    as necessary.\n   For example, a search engine might make query results available
    as a\n   paged feed, so that queries with very large result sets do not\n   overwhelm
    the server, the network, or the client.\n   The feed documents in a paged feed
    are tied together with the\n   following link relations:\n   o  \"first\" - A
    URI that refers to the furthest preceding document in\n      a series of documents.\n
    \  o  \"last\" - A URI that refers to the furthest following document in a\n      series
    of documents.\n   o  \"previous\" - A URI that refers to the immediately preceding\n
    \     document in a series of documents.\n   o  \"next\" - A URI that refers to
    the immediately following document\n      in a series of documents.\n   Paged
    feed documents MUST have at least one of these link relations\n   present, and
    should contain as many as practical and applicable.\n   Example: Atom-formatted
    Paged Feed\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n   <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">\n

  - "4.  Archived Feeds\n   An archived feed is a set of feed documents that can be
    combined to\n   accurately reconstruct the entries of a logical feed.\n   Unlike
    paged feeds, archived feeds enable clients to do this without\n   losing entries.
    \ This is achieved by publishing a single subscription\n   document and (potentially)
    many archive documents.\n   A subscription document is a feed document that always
    contains the\n   most recently added or changed entries available in the logical
    feed.\n   Archive documents are feed documents that contain less recent entries\n
    \  in the feed.  The set of entries contained in an archive document\n   published
    at a particular URI SHOULD NOT change over time.  Likewise,\n   the URI for a
    particular archive document SHOULD NOT change over\n   time.\n   The following
    link relations are used to tie subscription and\n   archived feeds together:\n
    \  o  \"prev-archive\" - A URI that refers to the immediately preceding\n      archive
    document.\n   o  \"next-archive\" - A URI that refers to the immediately following\n
    \     archive document.\n   o  \"current\" - A URI that, when dereferenced, returns
    a feed document\n      containing the most recent entries in the feed.\n   Subscription
    documents and archive documents MUST have a \"prev-\n   archive\" link relation,
    unless there are no preceding archives\n   available.  Archive documents SHOULD
    also have a \"next-archive\" link\n   relation, unless there are no following
    archives available.\n   Archive documents SHOULD indicate their associated subscription\n
    \  documents using the \"current\" link relation.\n   Archive documents SHOULD
    also contain an fh:archive element in their\n   head sections to indicate that
    they are archives. fh:archive is an\n   empty element; this specification does
    not define any content for it.\n   Example: Atom-formatted Subscription Document\n

    \ That document, in turn points to the previous archive\n   \"http://example.org/2003/10/index.atom\",
    and so on.  Note that the\n   \"2003/11\" archive does not have a \"next-archive\"
    relation, because it\n   is the most recent complete archive; although another

  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Publishing Archived Feeds\n   The requirement that archive documents
      be stable allows clients to\n   safely assume that if they have retrieved one
      in the past, it will\n   not meaningfully change in the future.  As a result,
      if an archive\n   document's contents are changed, some clients may not become
      aware of\n   the changes.\n   Therefore, if a publisher requires a change to
      be visible to all\n   users (e.g., correcting factual errors), they should consider\n
      \  publishing the revised entry in the subscription document, in\n   addition
      to (or instead of) the appropriate archive document.\n   Conversely, unimportant
      changes (e.g., spelling corrections) might be\n   only effected in archive documents.\n
      \  Publishers SHOULD construct their feed documents in such a way as to\n   make
      duplicate removal unambiguous (see Section 4.2).\n   Publishers are not required
      to make all archive documents available;\n   they may refuse to serve (e.g.,
      with HTTP status code 403 or 410) or\n   be unable to serve (e.g., with HTTP
      status code 404) an archive\n   document.\n"
    title: 4.1.  Publishing Archived Feeds
  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Consuming Archived Feeds\n   Typically, clients will \"subscribe\" to
      an archived feed by polling\n   the subscription document for recent changes.
      \ If a URI contained in\n   the prev-archive link relation has not been processed
      in the past,\n   the client can \"catch up\" with any missed entries by dereferencing
      it\n   and adding the contained entries to the logical feed.  This process\n
      \  should be repeated recursively until the client encounters a prev-\n   archive
      link relation that has been processed (the end of the archive\n   is indicated
      by a missing prev-archive link relation) or an error is\n   encountered.\n   If
      duplicate entries are found, clients SHOULD consider only the most\n   recently
      updated entry to be part of the logical feed.  If duplicate\n   entries have
      the same update time-stamp, or no time-stamps are\n   available, the entry sourced
      from the most recently updated feed\n   document SHOULD replace all other duplicates
      of that entry.\n   In Atom-formatted archived feeds, two entries are duplicates
      if they\n   have the same atom:id element.  The update time of an entry is\n
      \  determined by its atom:updated element, and likewise the update time\n   of
      a feed document is determined by its feed-level atom:updated\n   element.\n
      \  Clients SHOULD warn users when they are not able to reconstruct the\n   entire
      logical feed (e.g., by alerting the user that an archive\n   document is unavailable,
      or displaying pseudo-entries that inform the\n   user that some entries may
      be missing).\n"

  title: 5.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Feeds using this mechanism have the same security
    considerations as\n   Atom [1].  Encryption and authentication security services
    can be\n   obtained by encrypting and/or signing the feed, as described in [1],\n
    \  and may also be obtained through channel-based mechanisms (e.g., TLS\n   [6],
    HTTP authentication [7]) and/or transport (e.g., IPsec [8]).\n   Feeds using these
    mechanisms could be crafted in such a way as to\n   cause a client to initiate
    excessive (or even an unending sequence\n   of) network requests, causing denial
    of service (either to the\n   client, the target server, and/or intervening networks).
    \ Clients can\n   mitigate this risk by requiring user intervention after a certain\n
    \  number of requests, or by limiting requests either according to a\n   hard
    limit, or with heuristics.  Servers can mitigate this risk by\n   denying requests
    that they consider abusive (e.g., by closing the\n   connection or generating
    an error).\n   Clients should be mindful of resource limits when storing feed\n
    \  documents.  To reiterate, they are not required to always store or\n   reconstruct
    the feed when conforming to this specification; they only\n   need to inform the
    user when the reconstructed feed is not complete.\n   This specification does
    not define what it means when a logical\n   feed's component feed documents have
    different security mechanisms\n   applied.\n"

    extensions are\n   described in terms of the Atom feed format, they are also useful
    in\n   similar formats.  This informative appendix demonstrates how they can\n
    \  be used in an RSS 2.0-formatted [9] feed.\n   In RSS 2.0-formatted feeds, two
    entries are duplicates if they have\n   the same guid element.  The update time
    of an entry is not defined by\n   RSS 2.0, but the feed-level update time can
    be determined by the\n   lastBuildDate element, if present.\n   RSS 2.0-formatted
