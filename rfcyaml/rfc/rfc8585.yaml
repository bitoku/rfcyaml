  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the IPv4 service continuity requirements\
    \ for\n   IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) routers that are provided either by the\n  \
    \ service provider or by vendors who sell through the retail market.\n   Specifically,\
    \ this document extends the basic requirements for IPv6\n   CE routers as described\
    \ in RFC 7084 to allow the provisioning of IPv6\n   transition services for the\
    \ support of IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) by\n   means of new transition mechanisms.\
    \  The document only covers\n   IPv4aaS, i.e., transition technologies for delivering\
    \ IPv4 in\n   IPv6-only access networks.  IPv4aaS is necessary because there aren't\n\
    \   sufficient IPv4 addresses available for every possible customer/\n   device.\
    \  However, devices or applications in the customer Local Area\n   Networks (LANs)\
    \ may be IPv4-only or IPv6-only and still need to\n   communicate with IPv4-only\
    \ services on the Internet.\n"

    \ an\n   IPv6-only network for residential or small office routers (referred\n\
    \   to as \"IPv6 Transition CE Routers\") in order to establish an industry\n\
    \   baseline for transition features to be implemented on such routers.\n   These\

    \ Typical IPv6-Only Access Network\n   This document covers a set of IP transition\
    \ techniques required when\n   ISPs have, or want to have, an IPv6-only access\
    \ network.  This is a\n   common situation when sufficient IPv4 addresses are\
    \ no longer\n   available for every possible customer and device, which causes\
    \ IPv4\n   addresses to become prohibitively expensive.  This, in turn, may\n\
    \   result in service providers provisioning IPv6-only WAN access.  At\n   the\
    \ same time, they need to ensure that both IPv4-only and IPv6-only\n   devices\
    \ and applications in the customer networks can still reach\n   IPv4-only devices\
    \ and applications on the Internet.\n   This document specifies the IPv4 service\
    \ continuity mechanisms to be\n   supported by an IPv6 Transition CE Router and\
    \ relevant provisioning\n   or configuration information differences from [RFC7084].\n\
    \   This document is not a recommendation for service providers to use\n   any\
    \ specific transition mechanism.\n   Automatic provisioning of more complex topology\
    \ than a single router\n   with multiple LAN interfaces may be handled by means\
    \ of the Home\n   Networking Control Protocol (HNCP) [RFC7788], which is out of\
    \ the\n   scope of this document.\n   Since it is impossible to know prior to\
    \ sale which transition\n   mechanism a device will need over its lifetime, an\
    \ IPv6 Transition CE\n   Router intended for the retail market MUST support all\
    \ the IPv4aaS\n   transition mechanisms listed in this document.  Service providers\n\
    \   that specify feature sets for the IPv6 Transition CE Router may\n   define\
    \ a different set of features from those included in this\n   document, for example,\
    \ features that support only some of the\n   transition mechanisms enumerated\
    \ in this document.\n   Appendices A and B contain a complete description of the\
    \ usage\n   scenarios and end-user network architecture, respectively.  These\n\
    \   appendices, along with [RFC7084], will facilitate a clearer\n   understanding\
    \ of this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Transition Technologies Support for IPv4 Service Continuity (IPv4-\n  \
    \    as-a-Service)\n   The main target of this document is the support of IPv6-only\
    \ WAN\n   access.  To enable legacy IPv4 functionality, this document also\n \
    \  includes the support of IPv4-only devices and applications in the\n   customer\
    \ LANs, as well as IPv4-only services on the Internet.  Thus,\n   both IPv4-only\
    \ and IPv6-only devices in the customer-side LANs of the\n   IPv6 Transition CE\
    \ Router are able to reach the IPv4-only services.\n   Note that this document\
    \ only configures IPv4aaS in the IPv6\n   Transition CE Router itself; it does\
    \ not forward such information to\n   devices attached to the LANs.  Thus, the\
    \ WAN configuration and\n   availability of native IPv4 or IPv4aaS are transparent\
    \ for the\n   devices attached to the LANs.\n   This document takes no position\
    \ on simultaneous operation of one or\n   several transition mechanisms and/or\
    \ native IPv4.\n   In order to seamlessly provide IPv4 service continuity in the\n\
    \   customer LANs and allow automated IPv6 transition mechanism\n   provisioning,\
    \ the following general transition requirements are\n   defined.\n   General transition\
    \ requirements:\n   TRANS-1:  The IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST support the DHCPv6\
    \ S46\n             priority options described in [RFC8026] (\"Unified IPv4-in-\n\
    \             IPv6 Softwire Customer Premises Equipment (CPE): A\n           \
    \  DHCPv6-Based Prioritization Mechanism\").\n   TRANS-2:  The IPv6 Transition\
    \ CE Router MUST have a GUI and either a\n             CLI or API (or both) to\
    \ manually enable/disable each of the\n             supported transition mechanisms.\n\
    \   TRANS-3:  If an IPv6 Transition CE Router supports more than one LAN\n   \
    \          subnet, the IPv6 Transition CE Router MUST allow\n             appropriate\
    \ subnetting and configuration of the address\n             space among several\
    \ interfaces.  In some transition\n             mechanisms, this may require differentiating\
    \ mappings/\n             translations on a per-interface basis.\n   In order\
    \ to allow the service provider to disable all the transition\n   mechanisms and/or\
    \ choose the most convenient one, the IPv6 Transition\n   CE Router MUST follow\
    \ the following configuration steps:\n   CONFIG-1:  Request the relevant configuration\
    \ options for each\n              supported transition mechanisms, which MUST\
    \ remain\n              disabled at this step.\n   CONFIG-2:  Following the steps\
    \ in Section 1.4 of [RFC8026], MUST\n              check for a valid match in\
    \ OPTION_S46_PRIORITY, which\n              allows enabling/disabling a transition\
    \ mechanism.\n   CONFIG-3:  Keep disabled all the transition mechanisms if no\
    \ match is\n              found between the priority list and the candidate list,\n\
    \              unless a NAT64 [RFC6146] prefix has been configured, in\n     \
    \         which case, 464XLAT [RFC6877] MUST be enabled.\n   Because 464XLAT has\
    \ no DHCPv6 configuration options, it can't\n   currently be included in the OPTION_S46_PRIORITY.\
    \  In the future, an\n   update of [RFC8026] or a NAT64 DHCPv6 configuration option\
    \ may enable\n   it.  Meanwhile, if an operator provides 464XLAT, it needs to\
    \ ensure\n   that OPTION_S46_PRIORITY is not sent for any other transition\n \
    \  mechanism to the relevant customers.\n   The following subsections describe\
    \ the requirements for supporting\n   each one of the transition mechanisms. \
    \ An IPv6 Transition CE Router\n   intended for the retail market MUST support\
    \ all of them.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Code Considerations\n   At the time of this writing, one of the apparent\
    \ main issues for\n   vendors with regard to including new functionalities, such\
    \ as support\n   for new transition mechanisms, is the lack of space in the flash\
    \ (or\n   equivalent) memory.  However, it has been confirmed from existing\n\
    \   open-source implementations (e.g., OpenWRT/LEDE, Linux, and VPP) that\n  \
    \ adding the support for the new transition mechanisms requires around\n   10-12\
    \ KBs because most of the code base is shared among several\n   transition mechanisms,\
    \ which are already supported by [RFC7084].  A\n   single data plane is common\
    \ to all of them, which typically means, in\n   popular CEs already in the market\
    \ [OpenWRT], the new required code is\n   only about 0.15% of the total existing\
    \ code size.\n   In general, the new requirements don't have extra cost in terms\
    \ of\n   RAM memory, nor other hardware requirements such as more powerful\n \
    \  CPUs, if compared to the cost of NAT44 code.  Thus, existing hardware\n   should\
    \ be able to support all of them with minimal impact.\n   The other issue seems\
    \ to be the cost of developing the code for those\n   new functionalities.  However,\
    \ at the time of writing this document,\n   it has been confirmed that there are\
    \ several open-source versions of\n   the required code for supporting all the\
    \ new transition mechanisms,\n   and several vendors already have implementations\
    \ and provided them to\n   ISPs.  Therefore, the development cost is negligible,\
    \ and only\n   integration and testing cost may become an issue.\n   Finally,\
    \ in some cases, operators supporting several transition\n   mechanisms may need\
    \ to consider training costs for staff in all the\n   techniques for the operation\
    \ and management of these mechanisms, even\n   if the costs are not directly caused\
    \ by supporting this document but\n   because of business decisions.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Usage Scenarios
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Usage Scenarios\n   The situation of ongoing IPv6 deployment and\
    \ a lack of IPv4 addresses\n   is not happening at the same pace in every country\
    \ and even within\n   every country for every ISP.  For different technical, financial,\n\
    \   commercial/marketing, and socio-economic reasons, each network is\n   transitioning\
    \ at their own pace; the global transition timings cannot\n   be reliably estimated.\n\
    \   Different studies (for example, [IPv6Survey]) also show that IPv6\n   deployment\
    \ is a changing situation.  In a single country, not all\n   operators will necessarily\
    \ provide IPv6 support.  Consumers may also\n   switch ISPs and use the same IPv6\
    \ Transition CE Router with either an\n   ISP that provides IPv4-only or an ISP\
    \ that provides IPv6 with\n   IPv4aaS.\n   So, to cover all those evolving situations,\
    \ an IPv6 Transition CE\n   Router is required, at least from the perspective\
    \ of transition\n   support.\n   Moreover, because some services and service providers\
    \ will remain\n   IPv4-only for an undetermined period of time, IPv4 service continuity\n\
    \   is required.  Thus, there is a need for CEs to support IPv4aaS\n   indefinitely.\n\
    \   Based on these premises, this document ensures that the IPv6\n   Transition\
    \ CE Router allows the continued transition from networks\n   that today may provide\
    \ access with dual-stack or IPv6-in-IPv4 (as\n   described in [RFC7084]) to networks\
    \ that provide IPv6-only access\n   with IPv4aaS.\n   Considering that situation\
    \ and different possible usage cases, the\n   IPv6 Transition CE Router described\
    \ in this document is expected to\n   be used in residential/household; small\
    \ office, home office (SOHO);\n   and small/medium enterprise (SME).  Common usage\
    \ is any kind of\n   Internet access (web, email, streaming, online gaming, etc.),\
    \ and\n   more advanced requirements include inbound connections (IP cameras,\n\
    \   web, DNS, email, VPN, etc.).\n   The above is not intended to be a comprehensive\
    \ list of all the\n   possible usage cases, just an overview.  In fact, combinations\
    \ of the\n   above usages are also possible, along with situations where the same\n\
    \   CE is used at different times in different scenarios or even with\n   different\
    \ IPv4aaSes at different service providers.\n   The mechanisms for allowing inbound\
    \ connections are naturally\n   available in any IPv6 router when using IPv6 Global\
    \ Unicast Addresses\n   (GUAs), unless they are blocked by firewall rules, which\
    \ may require\n   some manual configuration.\n   However, in the case of IPv4aaS,\
    \ because of the usage of private IPv4\n   addresses and NAT and depending on\
    \ the specific transition mechanism,\n   inbound connections typically require\
    \ some degree of more complex\n   manual configuration, such as setting up a DMZ,\
    \ setting up virtual\n   servers, or setting up port/protocol forwarding.  In\
    \ general, IPv4 CE\n   Routers already provide a GUI, CLI, or API to manually\
    \ configure\n   them, or provide the possibility to set up the CE in bridge mode,\
    \ so\n   another Router behind the original CE, takes care of inbound\n   connections.\
    \  The requirements for that support are out of the scope\n   of this document.\n\
    \   Who provides the IPv6 Transition CE Router is not relevant.  In most\n   cases,\
    \ the service provider is responsible for provisioning/managing,\n   at least\
    \ on the WAN side.  Commonly, the user has access to configure\n   the LAN interfaces,\
    \ firewall, DMZ, and many other features.  However,\n   in many cases, the user\
    \ must supply or may replace the IPv6\n   Transition CE Router.  This underscores\
    \ the importance of the IPv6\n   Transition CE Routers fulfilling the requirements\
    \ defined in this\n   document.\n   The IPv6 Transition CE Router described in\
    \ this document is not\n   intended for usage in other scenarios, such as large\
    \ enterprises,\n   data centers, content providers, etc.  Even if the documented\n\
    \   requirements meet their needs, they may have additional requirements,\n  \
    \ which are out of the scope of this document.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  End-User Network Architecture
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  End-User Network Architecture\n   An end-user network will likely\
    \ support both IPv4 and IPv6 (see\n   Section 1 and Appendix A).  It is not expected\
    \ that end users will\n   change their existing network topology with the introduction\
    \ of IPv6.\n   There are some differences in how IPv6 works and is provisioned;\n\
    \   these differences have implications for the network architecture.\n   A typical\
    \ IPv4 end-user network consists of a \"plug and play\" router\n   with NAT functionality\
    \ and a single link upstream, connected to the\n   service provider network.\n\
    \   From the perspective of an IPv4 user behind an IPv6 Transition CE\n   Router,\
    \ this doesn't change.\n   However, while a typical IPv4 NAT deployment, by default,\
    \ blocks all\n   incoming connections and may allow opening of ports using a Universal\n\
    \   Plug and Play Internet Gateway Device (UPnP IGD) [UPnP-IGD][OCF-IGD]\n   or\
    \ some other firewall control protocol, in the case of an IPv6-only\n   access\
    \ and IPv4aaS, that may not be feasible depending on specific\n   transition mechanism\
    \ details.  PCP [RFC6887] may be an alternative\n   solution.\n   Another consequence\
    \ of using IPv4 private address space in the end-\n   user network is that it\
    \ provides stable addressing; that is, it\n   doesn't change, even when you change\
    \ service providers, and the\n   addresses are always usable even when the WAN\
    \ interface is down or\n   the customer edge router has not yet been provisioned.\
    \  In the case\n   of IPv6-only access, private IPv4 addresses are also available\
    \ if the\n   IPv4aaS transition mechanism keeps running the NAT interface towards\n\
    \   the LAN side when the WAN interface is down.\n   More advanced routers support\
    \ dynamic routing (which learns routes\n   from other routers), and advanced end\
    \ users can build arbitrary,\n   complex networks using manual configuration of\
    \ address prefixes\n   combined with a dynamic routing protocol.  Once again,\
    \ this is true\n   for both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   In general, the end-user network\
    \ architecture for IPv6 should provide\n   equivalent or better capabilities and\
    \ functionality than the current\n   IPv4 architecture.\n   The end-user network\
    \ is a stub network in the sense that is not\n   providing transit to other external\
    \ networks.  However, HNCP\n   [RFC7788] allows support for automatic provisioning\
    \ of downstream\n   routers.  Figure 2 illustrates the model topology for the\
    \ end-user\n   network.\n                   +---------------+               \\\
