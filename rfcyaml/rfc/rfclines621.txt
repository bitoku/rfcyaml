On Friday evening 8 Mar 74, we will delete all those directories at SRI ARC that belonged to NIC users who were transferred to OFFICE 1.
Simultaneous1y, there is to be a change at each Network Host such that the Hostname "NIC" will refer to OFFICE 1
(Host 53 octal), not to SRI  ARC.
(See RFC# 620, NIC# 21993)
The effect of these changes is that Network mail sent to NIC users in the form "nicusername@NIC" will be delivered to OFFICE 1, as it should.
But if such mail is sent to "nicusername@SRI ARC" it will not be accepted at SRI ARC, because the NIC user's username will be no longer be known there.
THAT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO READ ANY NETWORK MAIL THAT WAS DELIVERED TO YOU
PRIOR TO FRIDAY EVENING 8 MARCH.
THIS MAIL WILL BE DELETED AT THAT TIME.
