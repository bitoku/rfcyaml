  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This RFC consolidates information necessary for the implementation\
    \ of\n   domain style names throughout the DDN/MILNET Internet community.\n  \
    \ Although no official policy has been published, the introduction of\n   domain\
    \ style names will impact all hosts in the DDN/MILNET Internet.\n   The RFC is\
    \ designed as an aid to implementors and administrators by\n   providing 1) an\
    \ overview of the transition process from host tables\n   to domains, 2) a potential\
    \ timetable for the transition, and 3)\n   references to documentation and software\
    \ relating to the DDN/ARPANET\n   domain system.  Distribution of this RFC is\
    \ unlimited.\n"
- title: BACKGROUND
  contents:
  - "BACKGROUND\n   All MILNET hosts are expected to have a way of translating the\
    \ name\n   of any other host into its Internet address.  Although the current\n\
    \   method of name resolution is to look up the information in a table of\n  \
    \ all hosts, this method of operation is cumbersome and relies on a\n   central\
    \ point of information.  The Network Information Center (NIC)\n   maintains a\
    \ table of hosts registered in the MILNET Internet and\n   their addresses.  The\
    \ size of this table and the frequency of updates\n   has reached the limits of\
    \ manageability.  The central host table is\n   FTP'd by a host on a timely basis\
    \ from the NIC, processed locally (to\n   pare or reformat the table), and used\
    \ in name resolution.\n   The domain system uses a distributed database and software\
    \ to perform\n   the same functions as the host table.  In this system, host resolvers\n\
    \   query domain servers for name resolution.  They may cache answers for\n  \
    \ performance improvement.  The domain servers each maintain a portion\n   of\
    \ the hierarchical database under separate administrative authority\n   and control.\
    \  Redundancy is obtained by transferring data between\n   cooperating servers.\n\
    \   The domain system has been operating successfully on the ARPANET for\n   over\
    \ a year.  One indication of success is that the NIC's central\n   host table\
    \ is no longer a complete list (i.e., ARPANET does not\n   depend primarily on\
    \ the host table).  The domain system is being\n   implemented on the MILNET with\
    \ DoD military standard protocols.  The\n   first step in changing to the domain\
    \ system has been taken, as\n   required by DDN Management Bulletin #32 (22 Jan\
    \ 1987).  All host\n   names were converted from a simple, flat namespace to a\
    \ structured\n   name consistent with domains.  In the second step, servers acting\
    \ as\n   the root of the database hierarchy were put in place.  In the next\n\
    \   step, hosts are moving away from host table usage.\n"
- title: MIGRATION PATH
  contents:
  - "MIGRATION PATH\n   All hosts will not change from host table to domain server\
    \ usage at\n   one time.  Accordingly, three stages of conversion to the domain\n\
    \   system are envisaged.  These stages roughly correspond to 1)\n   continuing\
    \ to use the host table for all applications, 2) using the\n   domain system for\
    \ only some applications, and 3) using the domain\n   system for all applications.\
    \  These stages will exist simultaneously\n   as various hosts convert their application\
    \ software according to\n   available resources.  The following paragraphs discuss\
    \ these stages\n   in more detail.\n   Host Table Only\n      In the first stage,\
    \ a host depends entirely on the host table for\n      name resolution.  The table\
    \ is obtained from the NIC's central\n      copy and the resolution is done by\
    \ local table scanning.  Most\n      hosts are in this stage.\n      Certain hosts\
    \ may find it infeasible ever to convert to the domain\n      system, owing to\
    \ older architectures, unchangeable software, or\n      other considerations.\
    \  At the end of the conversion period, the\n      NIC will stop maintaining an\
    \ internet host table.  To continue\n      operations, hosts that do not convert\
    \ will need to obtain an\n      equivalent of the host table from some source.\
    \  This source may be\n      another host with which a bilateral agreement has\
    \ been negotiated\n      offline, a community-of-interest host acting as central\
    \ repository\n      for that community, or a locally-maintained table of host\
    \ names\n      and addresses.  Transfer of the table from the source is a matter\n\
    \      of local implementation and bilateral agreements.\n   Domain System and\
    \ Host Table\n      In the second stage, a host will use both the host table and\
    \ the\n      domain system.  A likely scenario is that applications like TELNET\n\
    \      and FTP will use the domain system and that MAIL will continue to\n   \
    \   use the host table for name resolution.  An alternate scenario is\n      that\
    \ batchstyle applications like MAIL would use the domain system\n      and that\
    \ the interactive applications would convert later.\n      This stage is viewed\
    \ as transitory, as hosts convert over to use\n      the domain system exclusively.\
    \  It is highlighted as a separate\n      stage to emphasize the need during transition\
    \ for both the host\n      table and the domain system.\n   Domain System Only\n\
    \      In the third and final stage, a host will have completed\n      conversion\
    \ and will be using the domain system exclusively.  This\n      includes correct\
    \ processing of the mailbox and mail exchanger\n      resource records.\n"
