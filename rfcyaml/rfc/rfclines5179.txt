Abstract This document describes the mapping of Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS API) domain name based service principal names onto Kerberos V principal names.
Domain Based Names for the Kerberos V GSS API Mechanism
In accordance with [RFC5178], this document provides the mechanism  specific details needed to implement GSS API [RFC2743] domain based service names with the Kerberos V GSS API mechanism [RFC4121].
GSS C NT DOMAINBASED SERVICE name SHOULD be mapped to Kerberos V principal names as follows:
the <service> name becomes the first (0th) component of the Kerberos V principal name;  the <hostname> becomes the second component of the Kerberos V principal name;  the <domain
> name becomes the third component of the Kerberos V principal name;  the realm of the resulting principal name is that which corresponds to the domain name, treated as a hostname.
The same name canonicalization considerations and methods as used elsewhere in the Kerberos V GSS API mechanism [RFC4121] and Kerberos V [RFC4120]
Implementations SHOULD use a Kerberos V name type of NTT SRVT HST DOMAIN (which has the value 12) but MAY use NT UNKNOWN instead.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
It is unclear, at this time, how best to address internationalization of Kerberos V domain based principal names.
This is because the Kerberos V core protocol internationalization project is incomplete.
However, clearly the best way to interoperate when using Kerberos V domain based principal names is to use ACE encoded internationalized domain names [RFC3490] for the hostname and domain name slots of a Kerberos V domain based principal name.
Therefore Kerberos V GSS API mechanism implementations MUST do just that.
The domain based name, of generic form, "ldap@foo.example@ds1.foo.example" may map to a Kerberos V principal name like: "ldap/ds1.foo.example/ foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE"  The domain based name, of generic form, "kadmin@foo.example@kdc1.foo.example" may map to a Kerberos V principal name like: "kadmin/kdc1.foo.example/ foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE" 5.
It is important for the security of protocols using the Kerberos V GSS API mechanism and domain based names, that the realm of domain  based principal names be derived from the hostname, rather than the domain name slots of the input domain based name string.
