    \ for\n   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP\n\
    \   defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, and proposes a family of\n  \

    \ a\n   standard method for encapsulating and transporting serial data over a\n\
    \   PPP link.  The PPP Compression Control Protocol [3] provides a\n   standard\
    \ method for selecting and using a compression protocol to\n   provide for data\
    \ compression on a PPP link.\n   This document defines a specific set of parameters\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is a product of the TR30.1 ad hoc committee\
    \ on\n   compression of synchronous data.  It represents a component of a\n  \
    \ proposal to use PPP to provide compression of synchronous serial data\n   in\
    \ DSU/CSUs.\n   PPP [1] has three main components:\n      1. A method for encapsulating\
    \ multi-protocol datagrams.\n      2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing,\
    \ configuring,\n         and testing the data-link connection.\n      3. A family\
    \ of Network Control Protocols for establishing and\n         configuring different\
    \ network-layer protocols.\n   In addition to providing support for multi-protocol\
    \ datagrams, the\n   Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] has defined an effective\
    \ and robust\n   negotiating mechanism that can be used on point to point links.\
    \  When\n   used in conjunction with the PPP Compression Control Protocol [3]\
    \ and\n   one of the PPP Compression Protocols [4], PPP provides an\n   interoperable\
    \ method of employing data compression on a point-to-\n   point link.\n   The\
    \ PPP Serial Data Transport Protocol (PPP-SDTP) and the PPP Serial\n   Data Control\
    \ Protocol (PPP-SDCP) [2] have been developed to allow\n   serial data to be carried\
    \ within a PPP packet.  PPP-SDTP uses a\n   terminal adaption header based on\
    \ that of ITU-T Recommendation V.120\n   [5].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Specification of Requirements\n   In this document, several words are used\
    \ to signify the requirements\n   of the specification.  These words are often\
    \ capitalized.\n   MUST      This word, or the adjective \"required\", means that\
    \ the\n             definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.\n\
    \   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute\n         \
    \    prohibition of the specification.\n   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective\
    \ \"recommended\", means that there\n             may exist valid reasons in particular\
    \ circumstances to\n             ignore this item, but the full implications must\
    \ be\n             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a\n      \
    \       different course.\n   MAY       This word, or the adjective \"optional\"\
    , means that this\n             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.\
    \  An\n             implementation which does not include this option MUST be\n\
    \             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which\n   \
    \          does include the option.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document frequently uses the following terms:\n  \
    \ datagram  The unit of transmission in the network layer (such as IP).\n    \
    \         A datagram may be encapsulated in one or more packets\n            \
    \ passed to the data link layer.\n   frame     The unit of transmission at the\
    \ data link layer.  A frame\n             may include a header and/or a trailer,\
    \ along with some\n             number of units of data.\n   packet    The basic\
    \ unit of encapsulation, which is passed across the\n             interface between\
    \ the network layer and the data link\n             layer.  A packet is usually\
    \ mapped to a frame; the\n             exceptions are when data link layer fragmentation\
    \ is being\n             performed, or when multiple packets are incorporated\
    \ into a\n             single frame.\n   peer      The other end of the point-to-point\
    \ link.\n   silently discard\n             This means the implementation discards\
    \ the packet without\n             further processing.  The implementation SHOULD\
    \ provide the\n             capability of logging the error, including the contents\
    \ of\n             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event\n\
    \             in a statistics counter.\n"
- title: 2.  Modes of Operation
  contents:
  - "2.  Modes of Operation\n   This document provides for three modes of operation\
    \ for DCE devices:\n   Mode-0 represents transparent operation; Mode-1 a simplified,\n\
    \   predefined compression format; and Mode-2, a full PPP implementation\n   providing\
    \ compression of serial data.\n   Mode-0 represents the operating mode of currently\
    \ deployed DCEs that\n   operate in transparent mode, without any DCE-to-DCE protocols.\n\
    \   Mode-1 devices implement data compression upon detecting an initial\n   handshake,\
    \ which is implemented via an newly defined LCP\n   Configuration Option called\
    \ the DCE-Identifier.  The DCE-Identifier\n   is used both to distinguish DCE\
    \ devices from PPP bridges and routers,\n   and to all Mode-1 and Mode-2 DCE devices\
    \ to interoperate, via its\n   Mode parameter.  In Mode-1, the parameters of operation\
    \ are not\n   negotiable.  Mode-2 devices implement the full LCP state machine\
    \ and\n   are therefore capable of negotiating alternatives to the default set\n\
    \   of paramaters and options.  Mode-2 devices must also support Mode-1\n   operation,\
    \ and fall-back to such operation when connected to a Mode-1\n   device.  The\
    \ mechanism of the Mode-1/Mode-2 handshake is given in\n   Section 7.\n"

- title: 4.  Required PPP Elements
  contents:
  - "4.  Required PPP Elements\n   Unlike PPP's native bridge/router environment,\
    \ the minimum\n   requirement for use of PPP in DCE equipment is not simply\n\
    \   interoperability, but rather interoperability with effective data\n   compression.\
    \  With this in mind, it is desirable to specify a minimum\n   PPP feature set,\
    \ that is somewhat different than that of a normal PPP\n   bridge/router requirement.\n\
    \   This different feature set includes: support for compression, support\n  \
    \ of a single default compression algorithm, support of Protocol-Field\n   compression,\
    \ support of Address-and-Control-Field-Compression,\n   support of PPP-SDTP, etc.\n\
    \   The minimum feature set includes the following protocols:\n      PPP Link\
    \ Control Protocol (Mode-1 must include a subset) [1]\n      PPP in HDLC-like\
    \ Framing [6]\n      PPP Compression Control Protocol (Mode-2 only) [3]\n    \
    \  PPP LZS-DCP Compression Protocol [4]\n      PPP Serial Data Transport Protocol\
    \ [2]\n      PPP Serial Data Control Protocol (Mode-2 only) [2]\n   The Stacker-LZS\
    \ algorithm from Stac Electronics was chosen as the\n   default compression algorithm\
    \ for DCE devices.  This decision was\n   made by the TR30.1 ad hoc based on licensing\
    \ issues (agreeing to\n   non-discriminatory and reasonable terms), compression\
    \ ratios, its\n   efficient use of processor and memory resources, and speed\n\
    \   scalability.  A compression protocol incorporating in-band\n   synchronization\
    \ signaling was defined for the Stacker algorithm and\n   selected for the default\
    \ compression protocol.  This protocol is\n   known as the PPP LZS-DCP Compression\
    \ Protocol [4].  Although the PPP\n   LZS-DCP Compression Protocol specifies a\
    \ number of formats and\n   history management options, only the default format\
    \ with a single\n   history must be implemented.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Required Configuration Options and Parameters
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Required Configuration Options and Parameters\n   To ensure that implementations\
    \ are able to interoperate with\n   effective data compression, a required set\
    \ of Configuration Options\n   are specified.  These Options are assumed in Mode-1,\
    \ and are\n   negotiated in Mode-2, using the standard PPP negotiation state\n\
    \   machine.  (Mode-1 uses a fixed packet format with a predetermined set\n  \

- title: 5.  Mode-1 Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Mode-1 Requirements\n   DSUs that use only Mode-1 (non-negotiate mode) use\
    \ only a\n   predetermined set of PPP packets.  In addition to a fixed data packet\n\
    \   format, two fixed formats are used to differentiate between Mode-1\n   devices\
    \ and Mode-0 (transparent) devices.  Mode-1 devices are\n   designed to operate\
    \ using compression if a peer has the same\n   capability, or revert to transparent\
    \ operation (Mode-0) if the peer\n   does not support standard compression.\n\
    \   Mode-1 devices use LZS-DCP Compression Packets as specified in [4].\n   These\
    \ packets include the capabilities of DCP:  Reset-Request and\n   Acknowledge,\
    \ Compressed/Transparent, etc.  Since the packets include\n   signalling, these\
    \ packets can be sent with an empty data field to\n   signal a reset request if\
    \ no data packets are ready for piggy-backed\n   signalling.\n   Exactly one LZS-DCP\
    \ packet is encapsulated in the PPP Information\n   field, where the PPP Protocol\
    \ field indicates type 00FD (Compression\n   Protocol).  Exactly one SDTP packet\

    \ a set of predetermined values for LCP,\n   LZS-DCP, and SDTP configuration options\
    \ and parameters, using the\n   values listed in the preceding section.\n   The\
    \ following PPP packets are permitted and recognized:\n      LCP Configure-Request\

- title: 6.  Initial Handshake Operation
  contents:
  - "6.  Initial Handshake Operation\n   When a unit is powered up, or when the lower\
    \ layer signals that the\n   peer has gone out of service and returned, the handshake\
    \ procedure is\n   initiated.  The handshake procedure for Mode-1 and Mode-2 devices\
    \ is\n   described below.\n   Mode-1:\n      When starting Mode-1, each DCE sends\
    \ out an LCP Configure-Request\n      packet containing only the DCE-Identifier\
    \ LCP Configuration Option\n      described in Section 3, with the with the Mode\
    \ Field set to a\n      value of 1.  When a DCE device receives such a packet,\
    \ it must\n      answer with an LCP Configure-Ack packet.  In each of these\n\
    \      packets, the identifier field is set to 0.  If the originator of\n    \
    \  the Configure-Request packet does not receive a Configure-Ack\n      response\
    \ within a user configurable time T1, the unit MUST revert\n      to transparent\
    \ (Mode-0) operation.\n   Mode-2:\n      A Mode-2 device will first try to operate\

    \ in [1].  The\n      LCP Configure-Request MUST include the DCE-Identifier\n\
    \      Configuration Option with the Mode Field set to 2.  If the unit\n     \
    \ receives a Configure-Reject Packet Containing the DCE-Identifier,\n      the\
    \ unit MUST revert immediately to transparent (Mode-0)\n      operation.  If the\
    \ LCP state machine times out because a response\n      was not received in user\
    \ configurable time T2, or if a Mode-1\n      Configuration-Request packet is\
    \ received, the unit attempts to\n      operate in Mode-1 by following the procedure\
    \ listed above,\n      ultimately reverting to Mode-0 operation if the Mode-1\
    \ procedure\n      times out.\n   In either case, the unit is not prohibited from\
    \ sending multiple\n   Configuration-Request packets before the applicable timer\
    \ (T1, T2)\n   expires.  A unit may also initiate the handshake procedure at any\n\
    \   time.\n"
