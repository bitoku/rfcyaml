  - "1. Introduction\n   From July 7 to July 9, 1999 the Internet Architecture Board\
    \ (IAB)\n   held a workshop on the architecture of the Internet Network Layer.\n\
    \   The Network Layer is usually referred to as the IP layer.  The goal\n   of\
    \ the workshop was to discuss the current state of the Network Layer\n   and the\
    \ impact various currently deployed or future mechanisms and\n   technologies\
    \ might have on the continued growth and usage of the\n   Internet.\n   The most\
    \ important issues to be discussed were:\n   o  Status of IPv6 deployment and\
    \ transition issues\n   o  Alternative technical strategies in case IPv6 is not\
    \ adopted\n   o  Globally unique addresses and 32 bit address depletion\n   o\
    \  Global connectivity and reachability\n   o  Fragmentation of the Internet\n\
    \   o  End to end transparency and the progressive loss thereof\n   o  End to\
    \ end security\n   o  Complications of address sharing mechanisms (NAT, RSIP)\n\
    \   o  Separation of identification and location in addressing\n   o  Architecture\
    \ and scaling of the current routing system\n   The participants looked into several\
    \ technical scenarios and\n   discussed the feasibility and probability of the\
    \ deployment of each\n   scenario.  Among the scenarios were for example full\
    \ migration to\n   IPv6, IPv6 deployment only in certain segments of the network,\
    \ no\n   significant deployment of IPv6 and increased segmentation of the IPv4\n\
    \   address space due to the use of NAT devices.\n   Based on the discussion of\
    \ these scenarios several trends and\n   external influences were identified which\
    \ could have a large impact\n   on the status of the network layer, such as the\
    \ deployment of\n   wireless network technologies, mobile networked devices and\
    \ special\n   purpose IP devices.\n   The following technical issues were identified\
    \ to be important goals:\n   o  Deployment of end to end security\n   o  Deployment\
    \ of end to end transport\n   o  Global connectivity and reachability should be\
    \ maintained\n   o  It should be easy to deploy new applications\n   o  It should\
    \ be easy to connect new hosts and networks to the\n      Internet (\"plug and\
    \ ping\")\n   By the notion \"deployment of end to end transport\" it is meant\
    \ that\n   it is a goal to be able to deploy new applications that span from any\n\
    \   host to any other host without intermediaries, and this requires\n   transport\
    \ protocols with similar span (see also [1]).\n   This document summarizes the\
    \ conclusions and recommendations made by\n   the workshop.  It should be noted\
    \ that not all participants agreed\n   with all of the statements, and it was\
    \ not clear whether anyone\n   agreed with all of them.  The recommendations made\
    \ however are based\n   on strong consensus among the participants.\n"
- title: 2. Conclusions and Observations
  contents:
  - "2. Conclusions and Observations\n   The participants came to a number of conclusions\
    \ and observations on\n   several of the issues mentioned in section 1.  In the\
    \ following\n   sections 2.1-2.10 these conclusions will be described.\n"
- title: 2.1 Transparency
  contents:
  - "2.1 Transparency\n   In the discussions transparency was referred to as the original\n\
    \   Internet concept of a single universal logical addressing scheme and\n   the\
    \ mechanisms by which packets may flow from source to destination\n   essentially\
    \ unaltered [1].  This traditional end to end transparency\n   has been lost in\
    \ the current Internet, specifically the assumption\n   that IPv4 addresses are\
    \ globally unique or invariant is no longer\n   true.\n   There are multiple causes\
    \ for the loss of transparency, for example\n   the deployment of network address\
    \ translation devices, the use of\n   private addresses, firewalls and application\
    \ level gateways, proxies\n   and caches.  These mechanisms increase fragmentation\
    \ of the network\n   layer, which causes problems for many applications on the\
    \ Internet.\n   It adds up to complexity in applications design and inhibits the\n\
    \   deployment of new applications.  In particular, it has a severe\n   effect\
    \ on the deployment of end to end IP security.\n   Another consequence of fragmentation\
    \ is the deployment of \"split DNS\"\n   or \"two faced DNS\", which means that\
    \ the correspondence between a\n   given FQDN and an IPv4 address is no longer\
    \ universal and stable over\n   long periods (see section 2.7).\n   End to end\
    \ transparency will probably not be restored due to the fact\n   that some of\
    \ the mechanisms have an intrinsic value (e.g. firewalls,\n   caches and proxies)\
    \ and the loss of transparency may be considered by\n   some as a security feature.\
    \  It was however concluded that end to end\n   transparency is desirable and\
    \ an important issue to pursue.\n   Transparency is further explored in [1].\n"
- title: 2.2 NAT, Application Level Gateways & Firewalls
  contents:
  - "2.2 NAT, Application Level Gateways & Firewalls\n   The previous section indicated\
    \ that the deployment of NAT (Network\n   Address Translation), Application Level\
    \ Gateways and firewalls causes\n   loss of network transparency.  Each of them\
    \ is incompatible with\n   certain applications because they interfere with the\
    \ assumption of\n   end to end transparency.  NAT especially complicates setting\
    \ up\n   servers, peer to peer communications and \"always-on\" hosts as the\n\
    \   endpoint identifiers, i.e. IP addresses, used to set up connections\n   are\
    \ globally ambiguous and not stable (see [2]).\n   NAT, application level gateways\
    \ and firewalls however are being\n   increasingly widely deployed as there are\
    \ also advantages to each,\n   either real or perceived.  Increased deployment\
    \ causes a further\n   decline of network transparency and this inhibits the deployment\
    \ of\n   new applications.  Many new applications will require specialized\n \
    \  Application Level Gateways (ALGs) to be added to NAT devices, before\n   those\
    \ applications will work correctly when running through a NAT\n   device.  However,\
    \ some applications cannot operate effectively with\n   NAT even with an ALG.\n"
- title: 2.3 Identification and Addressing
  contents:
  - "2.3 Identification and Addressing\n   In the original IPv4 network architecture\
    \ hosts are globally,\n   permanently and uniquely identified by an IPv4 address.\
    \  Such an IP\n   address is used for identification of the node as well as for\n\
    \   locating the node on the network.  IPv4 in fact mingles the semantics\n  \
    \ of node identity with the mechanism used to deliver packets to the\n   node.\
    \  The deployment of mechanisms that separate the network into\n   multiple address\
    \ spaces breaks the assumption that a host can be\n   uniquely identified by a\
    \ single IP address.  Besides that, hosts may\n   wish to move to a different\
    \ location in the network but keep their\n   identity the same.  The lack of differentiation\
    \ between the identity\n   and the location of a host leads to a number of problems\
    \ in the\n   current architecture.\n   Several technologies at this moment use\
    \ tunneling techniques to\n   overcome the problem or cannot be deployed in the\
    \ case of separate\n   address spaces.  If a node could have some sort of a unique\n\
    \   identifier or endpoint name this would help in solving a number of\n   problems.\n\
    \   It was concluded that it may be desirable on theoretical grounds to\n   separate\
    \ the node identity from the node locator.  This is especially\n   true for IPsec,\
    \ since IP addresses are used (in transport mode) as\n   identifiers which are\
    \ cryptographically protected and hence MUST\n   remain unchanged during transport.\
    \  However, such a separation of\n   identity and location will not be available\
    \ as a near-term solution,\n   and will probably require changes to transport\
    \ level protocols.\n   However, the current specification of IPsec does allow\
    \ to use some\n   other identifier than an IP address.\n"
- title: 2.4 Observations on Address Space
  contents:
  - "2.4 Observations on Address Space\n   There is a significant risk that a single\
    \ 32 bit global address space\n   is insufficient for foreseeable needs or desires.\
    \  The participants'\n   opinions about the time scale over which new IPv4 addresses\
    \ will\n   still be available for assignment ranged from 2 to 20 years.\n   However,\
    \ there is no doubt that at the present time, users cannot\n   obtain as much\
    \ IPv4 address space as they desire.  This is partly a\n   result of the current\
    \ stewardship policies of the Regional Internet\n   Registries (RIRs).\n   It\
    \ was concluded that it ought to be possible for anybody to have\n   global addresses\
    \ when required or desired.  The absence of this\n   inhibits the deployment of\
    \ some types of applications.  It should\n   however be noted that there will\
    \ always be administrative boundaries,\n   firewalls and intranets, because of\
    \ the need for security and the\n   implementation of policies.  NAT is seen as\
    \ a significant\n   complication on these boundaries.  It is often perceived as\
    \ a\n   security feature because people are confusing NATs with firewalls.\n"
- title: 2.5 Routing Issues
  contents:
  - "2.5 Routing Issues\n   A number of concerns were raised regarding the scaling\
    \ of the current\n   routing system.  With current technology, the number of prefixes\
    \ that\n   can be used is limited by the time taken for the routing algorithm\
    \ to\n   converge, rather than by memory size, lookup time, or some other\n  \
    \ factor.  The limit is unknown, but there is some speculation, of\n   extremely\
    \ unclear validity, that it is on the order of a few hundred\n   thousand prefixes.\
    \  Besides the computational load of calculating\n   routing tables, the time\
    \ it takes to distribute routing updates\n   across the network, the robustness\
    \ and security of the current\n   routing system are also important issues.  The\
    \ only known addressing\n   scheme which produces scalable routing mechanisms\
    \ depends on\n   topologically aggregated addresses, which requires that sites\n\
    \   renumber when their position in the global topology changes.\n   Renumbering\
    \ remains operationally difficult and expensive ([3], [4]).\n   It is not clear\
    \ whether the deployment of IPv6 would solve the\n   current routing problems,\
    \ but it should do so if it makes renumbering\n   easier.\n   At least one backbone\
    \ operator has concerns about the convergence\n   time of internetwork-wide routing\
    \ during a failover.  This operator\n   believes that current convergence times\
    \ are on the order of half a\n   minute, and possibly getting worse.  Others in\
    \ the routing community\n   did not believe that the convergence times are a current\
    \ issue. Some,\n   who believe that real-time applications (e.g. telephony) require\n\
    \   sub-second convergence, are concerned about the implications of\n   convergence\
    \ times of a half minute on such applications.\n   Further research is needed\
    \ on routing mechanisms that might help\n   palliate the current entropy in the\
    \ routing tables, and can help\n   reduce the convergence time of routing computations.\n\
    \   The workshop discussed global routing in a hypothetical scenario with\n  \
    \ no distinguished root global address space.  Nobody had an idea how\n   to make\
    \ such a system work.  There is currently no well-defined\n   proposal for a new\
    \ routing system that could solve such a problem.\n   For IPv6 routing in particular,\
    \ the GSE/8+8 proposal and IPNG WG\n   analysis of this proposal ([5]) are still\
    \ being examined by the IESG.\n   There is no consensus in the workshop whether\
    \ this proposal could be\n   made deployable.\n"
- title: 2.6 Observations on Mobility
  contents:
  - "2.6 Observations on Mobility\n   Mobility and roaming require a globally unique\
    \ identifier. This does\n   not have to be an IP address.  Mobile nodes must have\
    \ a widely usable\n   identifier for their location on the network, which is an\
    \ issue if\n   private IP addresses are used or the IP address is ambiguous (see\n\
    \   also section 2.3).  Currently tunnels are used to route traffic to a\n   mobile\
    \ node.  Another option would be to maintain state information\n   at intermediate\
    \ points in the network if changes are made to the\n   packets.  This however\
    \ reduces the flexibility and it breaks the end\n   to end model of the network.\
    \  Keeping state in the network is usually\n   considered a bad thing.  Tunnels\
    \ on the other hand reduce the MTU\n   size.  Mobility was not discussed in detail\
    \ as a separate IAB\n   workshop is planned on this topic.\n"
- title: 2.7 DNS issues
  contents:
  - "2.7 DNS issues\n   If IPv6 is widely deployed, the current line of thinking is\
    \ that site\n   renumbering will be significantly more frequent than today.  This\n\
    \   will have an impact on DNS updates.  It is not clear what the scale\n   of\
    \ DNS updates might be, but in the most aggressive models it could\n   be millions\
    \ a day.  Deployment of the A6 record type which is defined\n   to map a domain\
    \ name to an IPv6 address, with the provision for\n   indirection for leading\
    \ prefix bits, could make this possible ([6]).\n   Another issue is the security\
    \ aspect of frequent updates, as they\n   would have to been done dynamically.\
    \  Unless we have fully secured\n   DNS, it could increase security risks.  Cached\
    \ TTL values might\n   introduce problems as the cached records of renumbered\
    \ hosts will not\n   be updated in time.  This will become especially a problem\
    \ if rapid\n   renumbering is needed.\n   Another already mentioned issue is the\
    \ deployment of split DNS (see\n   section 2.1).  This concept is widely used\
    \ in the Intranet model,\n   where the DNS provides different information to inside\
    \ and outside\n   queries.  This does not necessarily depend on whether private\n\
    \   addresses are used on the inside, as firewalls and policies may also\n   make\
    \ this desirable.  The use of split DNS seems inevitable as\n   Intranets will\
    \ remain widely deployed.  But operating a split DNS\n   raises a lot of management\
    \ and administrative issues.  As a work\n   around, a DNS Application Level Gateway\
    \ ([7]) (perhaps as an\n   extension to a NAT device) may be deployed, which intercepts\
    \ DNS\n   messages and modifies the contents to provide the appropriate\n   answers.\
    \  This has the disadvantage that it interferes with the use\n   of DNSSEC ([8]).\n\
    \   The deployment of split DNS, or more generally the existence of\n   separate\
    \ name spaces, makes the use of Fully Qualified Domain Names\n   (FQDNs) as endpoint\
    \ identifiers more complex.\n"
- title: 2.8 NAT and RSIP
  contents:
  - "2.8 NAT and RSIP\n   Realm-Specific IP (RSIP), a mechanism for use with IPv4,\
    \ is a work\n   item of the IETF NAT WG.  It is intended as an alternative (or\
    \ as a\n   complement) to network address translation (NAT) for IPv4, but other\n\
    \   uses are possible (for example, allowing end to end traffic across\n   firewalls).\
    \  It is similar to NAT, in that it allows sharing a small\n   number of external\
    \ IPv4 addresses among a number of hosts in a local\n   address domain (called\
    \ a 'realm').  However, it differs from NAT in\n   that the hosts know that different\
    \ externally-visible IPv4 addresses\n   are being used to refer to them outside\
    \ their local realm, and they\n   know what their temporary external address is.\
    \  The addresses and\n   other information are obtained from an RSIP server, and\
    \ the packets\n   are tunneled across the first routing realm ([9], [10]).\n \
    \  The difference between NAT and RSIP - that an RSIP client is aware of\n   the\
    \ fact that it uses an IP address from another address space, while\n   with NAT,\
    \ neither endpoint is aware that the addresses in the packets\n   are being translated\
    \ - is significant.  Unlike NAT, RSIP has the\n   potential to work with protocols\
    \ that require IP addresses to remain\n   unmodified between the source and destination.\
    \  For example, whereas\n   NAT gateways preclude the use of IPsec across them,\
    \ RSIP servers can\n   allow it [11].\n   The addition of RSIP to NATs may allow\
    \ them to support some\n   applications that cannot work with traditional NAT\
    \ ([12]), but it\n   does require that hosts be modified to act as RSIP clients.\
    \  It\n   requires changes to the host's TCP/IP stack, any layer-three protocol\n\
    \   that needs to be made RSIP-aware will have to be modified (e.g. ICMP)\n  \
    \ and certain applications may have to be changed.  The exact changes\n   needed\
    \ to host or application software are not quite well known at\n   this moment\
    \ and further research into RSIP is required.\n   Both NAT and RSIP assume that\
    \ the Internet retains a core of global\n   address space with a coherent DNS.\
    \  There is no fully prepared model\n   for NAT or RSIP without such a core; therefore\
    \ NAT and RSIP face an\n   uncertain future whenever the IPv4 address space is\
    \ finally exhausted\n   (see section 2.4).  Thus it is also a widely held view\
    \ that in the\n   longer term the complications caused by the lack of globally\
    \ unique\n   addresses, in both NAT and RSIP, might be a serious handicap ([1]).\n\
    \   If optimistic assumptions are made about RSIP (it is still being\n   defined\
    \ and a number of features have not been implemented yet), the\n   combination\
    \ of NAT and RSIP seems to work in most cases.  Whether\n   RSIP introduces specific\
    \ new problems, as well as removing some of\n   the NAT issues, remains to be\
    \ determined.\n   Both NAT and RSIP may have trouble with the future killer\n\
    \   application, especially when this needs QoS features, security and/or\n  \
    \ multicast.  And if it needs peer to peer communication (i.e. there\n   would\
    \ be no clear distinction between a server and a client) or\n   assumes \"always-on\"\
    \ systems, this would probably be complex with both\n   NAT and RSIP (see also\
    \ section 2.2).\n"
- title: 2.9 NAT, RSIP and IPv6
  contents:
  - "2.9 NAT, RSIP and IPv6\n   Assuming IPv6 is going to be widely deployed, network\
    \ address\n   translation techniques could play an important role in the transition\n\
    \   process from IPv4 to IPv6 ([13]).  The impact of adding RSIP support\n   to\
    \ hosts is not quite clear at this moment, but it is less than\n   adding IPv6\
    \ support since most applications probably don't need to be\n   changed.  And\
    \ RSIP needs no changes to the routing infrastructure,\n   but techniques such\
    \ as automatic tunneling ([14]) and 6to4 ([15])\n   would also allow IPv6 traffic\
    \ to be passed over the existing IPv4\n   routing infrastructure.  While RSIP\
    \ is principally a tool for\n   extending the life of IPv4, it is not a roadblock\
    \ for the transition\n   to IPv6.  The development of RSIP is behind that of IPv6,\
    \ and more\n   study into RSIP is required to determine what the issues with RSIP\n\
    \   might be.\n"
- title: 2.10 Observations on IPv6
  contents:
  - "2.10 Observations on IPv6\n   An important issue in the workshop was whether\
    \ the deployment of IPv6\n   is feasible and probable.  It was concluded that\
    \ the transition to\n   IPv6 is plausible modulo certain issues.  For example\
    \ applications\n   need to be ported to IPv6, and production protocol stacks and\n\
    \   production IPv6 routers should be released.  The core protocols are\n   finished,\
    \ but other standards need to be pushed forward (e.g. MIBs).\n   A search through\
    \ all RFCs for dependencies on IPv4 should be made, as\n   was done for the Y2K\
    \ problem, and if problems are found they must be\n   resolved.  As there are\
    \ serious costs in implementing IPv6 code, good\n   business arguments are needed\
    \ to promote IPv6.\n   One important question was whether IPv6 could help solve\
    \ the current\n   problems in the routing system and make the Internet scale better.\n\
    \   It was concluded that \"automatic\" renumbering is really important\n   when\
    \ prefixes are to be changed periodically to get the addressing\n   topology and\
    \ routing optimized.  This also means that any IP layer\n   and configuration\
    \ dependencies in protocols and applications will\n   have to be removed ([3]).\
    \  One example that was mentioned is the use\n   of IP addresses in the PKI (IKE).\
    \  There might also be security\n   issues with \"automatic\" renumbering as DNS\
    \ records have to be updated\n   dynamically (see also section 2.7).\n   Realistically,\
    \ because of the dependencies mentioned, IPv6\n   renumbering cannot be truly\
    \ automatic or instantaneous, but it has\n   the potential to be much simpler\
    \ operationally than IPv4 renumbering,\n   and this is critical to market and\
    \ ISP acceptance of IPv6.\n   Another issue is whether existing TCP connections\

    \ would\n   make things much more complex and it is foreseen that old and new\n\
    \   addresses would normally overlap for a long time.\n   There was no consensus\
    \ on how often renumbering would take place or\n   how automatic it can be in\
    \ practice; there is not much experience\n   with renumbering (maybe only for\

- title: 3.1 Recommendation on Namespace
  contents:
  - "3.1 Recommendation on Namespace\n   The workshop recommends the IAB to appoint\
    \ a panel to make specific\n   recommendations to the IETF about:\n      i) whether\
    \ we should encourage more parts of the stack to adopt a\n         namespace for\
    \ end to end interactions, so that a) NAT works\n         'better', and b) we\
    \ have a little more independence between the\n         internetwork and transport\
    \ and above layers;\n     ii) if so, whether we should have a single system-wide\
    \ namespace\n         for this function, or whether it makes more sense to allow\n\
    \         various subsystems to chose the namespace that makes sense for\n   \
    \      them;\n    iii) and also, what namespace(s) [depending on the output of\
    \ the\n         point above] that ought to be.\n"
- title: 3.2 Recommendations on RSIP
  contents:
  - "3.2 Recommendations on RSIP\n   RSIP is an interesting idea, but it needs further\
    \ refinement and\n   study.  It does not break the end to end network model in\
    \ the same\n   way as NAT, because an RSIP host has explicit knowledge of its\n\
    \   temporary global address.  Therefore, RSIP could solve some of the\n   issues\
    \ with NAT.  However, it is premature to recommend it as a\n   mainstream direction\
    \ at this time.\n   It is recommended that the IETF should actively work on RSIP,\
    \ develop\n   the details and study the issues.\n"

- title: 3.3.1
  contents:
  - "3.3.1\n   The current model of TLA-based addressing and routing should be\n \
    \  actively pursued.  However, straightforward site renumbering using\n   TLA\
    \ addresses is really needed, should be as nearly automatic as\n   possible, and\
    \ should be shown to be real and credible by the IPv6\n   community.\n"
- title: 3.3.2
  contents:
  - "3.3.2\n   Network address translation techniques, in addition to their\n   immediate\
    \ use in pure IPv4 environments, should also be viewed as\n   part of the starting\
    \ point for migration to IPv6.  Also RSIP, if\n   successful, can be a starting\
    \ point for IPv6 transition.\n   While the basic concepts of the IPv4 specific\
    \ mechanisms NAT and RSIP\n   are also being used in elements of the proposed\
    \ migration path to\n   IPv6 (in NAT-PT for NAT, and SIIT and AIIH for RSIP),\
    \ NAT and RSIP\n   for IPv4 are not directly part of a documented transition path\
    \ to\n   IPv6.\n   The exact implications, for transition to IPv6, of having NAT\
    \ and\n   RSIP for IPv4 deployed, are not well understood.  Strategies for\n \
    \  transition to IPv6, for use in IPv4 domains using NAT and RSIP for\n   IPv4,\
    \ should be worked out and documented by the IETF.\n"
- title: 3.3.3
  contents:
  - "3.3.3\n   The draft analysis of the 8+8/GSE proposal should be evaluated by the\n\
    \   IESG and accepted or rejected, without disturbing ongoing IPv6\n   deployment\
    \ work.  The IESG should use broad expertise, including\n   liaison with the endpoint\
    \ namespace panel (see section 3.1) in their\n   evaluation.\n"
- title: 3.4 Recommendations on IPsec
  contents:
  - "3.4 Recommendations on IPsec\n   It is urgent that we implement and deploy IPsec\
    \ using some other\n   identifier than 32-bit IP addresses (see section 2.3).\
    \  The current\n   IPsec specifications support the use of several different Identity\n\
    \   types (e.g. Domain Name, User@Domain Name).  The IETF should promote\n   implementation\
    \ and deployment of non-address Identities with IPsec.\n   We strongly urge the\
    \ IETF to completely deprecate the use of the\n   binary 32-bit IP addresses within\
    \ IPsec, except in certain very\n   limited circumstances, such as router to router\
    \ tunnels; in\n   particular any IP address dependencies should be eliminated\
    \ from\n   ISAKMP and IKE.\n   Ubiquitous deployment of the Secure DNS Extensions\
    \ ([8]) should be\n   strongly encouraged to facilitate widespread deployment\
    \ of IPsec\n   (including IKE) without address-based Identity types.\n"
- title: 3.5 Recommendations on DNS
  contents:
  - "3.5 Recommendations on DNS\n   Operational stability of DNS is paramount, especially\
    \ during a\n   transition of the network layer, and both IPv6 and some network\n\
    \   address translation techniques place a heavier burden on DNS.  It is\n   therefore\
    \ recommended to the IETF that, except for those changes that\n   are already\
    \ in progress and will support easier renumbering of\n   networks and improved\
    \ security, no fundamental changes or additions\n   to the DNS be made for the\
    \ foreseeable future.\n   In order to encourage widespread deployment of IPsec,\
    \ rapid\n   deployment of DNSSEC is recommended to the operational community.\n"
- title: 3.6 Recommendations on Routing
  contents:
  - "3.6 Recommendations on Routing\n   The only known addressing scheme which produces\
    \ scalable routing\n   mechanisms depends on topologically aggregated addresses,\
    \ which\n   requires that sites renumber when their position in the global\n \
    \  topology changes.  Thus recommendation 3.3.1 is vital for routing\n   IPv6.\n\
    \   Although the same argument applies to IPv4, the installed base is\n   simply\
    \ too large and the PIER working group showed that little can be\n   done to improve\
    \ renumbering procedures for IPv4.  However, NAT and/or\n   RSIP may help.\n \
    \  In the absence of a new addressing model to replace topological\n   aggregation,\
    \ and of clear and substantial demand from the user\n   community for a new routing\
    \ architecture (i.e. path-selection\n   mechanism) there is no reason to start\
    \ work on standards for a \"next\n   generation\" routing system in the IETF.\
    \  Therefore, we recommend that\n   work should continue in the IRTF Routing Research\
    \ Group.\n"
- title: 3.7 Recommendations on Application layer and APIs
  contents:
  - "3.7 Recommendations on Application layer and APIs\n   Most current APIs such\
    \ as sockets are an obstacle to migration to a\n   new network layer of any kind,\
    \ since they expose network layer\n   internal details such as addresses.\n  \
    \ It is therefore recommended, as originally recommended in RFC 1900\n   [3],\
    \ that IETF protocols, and third-party applications, avoid any\n   explicit awareness\
    \ of IP addresses, when efficient operation of the\n   protocol or application\
    \ is feasible in the absence of such awareness.\n   Some applications and services\
    \ may continue to need to be aware of IP\n   addresses.  Until we once again have\
    \ a uniform address space for the\n   Internet, such applications and services\
    \ will necessarily have\n   limited deployability, and/or require ALG support\
    \ in NATs.\n   Also we recommend an effort in the IETF to generalize APIs to offer\n\
    \   abstraction from all network layer dependencies, perhaps as a side-\n   effect\
    \ of the namespace study of section 3.1.\n"

  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   The workshop did not address security as a separate\
    \ topic, but the\n   role of firewalls, and the desirability of end to end deployment\
    \ of\n   IPsec, were underlying assumptions.  Specific recommendations on\n  \
    \ security are covered in sections 3.4 and 3.5.\n"
