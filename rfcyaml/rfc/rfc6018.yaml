- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Darknets, also called \"Network Telescopes\" among other\
    \ things, have\n   been deployed by several organizations (including CAIDA, Team\
    \ Cymru,\n   and the University of Michigan) to look at traffic directed to\n\
    \   addresses in blocks that are not in actual use.  Such traffic becomes\n  \
    \ visible by either direct capture (it is routed to a collector) or by\n   virtue\
    \ of its backscatter (its resulting in ICMP traffic or\n   transport-layer resets).\n\
    \   Darknets, of course, have two problems.  As their address spaces\n   become\
    \ known, attackers stop probing them, so they are less\n   effective.  Also, the\
    \ administrators of those prefixes are pressured\n   by Regional Internet Registry\
    \ (RIR) policy and business requirements\n   to deploy them in active networks.\n\
    \   [Harrop] defines a 'Greynet' by extension, in these words:\n      Darknets\
    \ are often proposed to monitor for anomalous, externally\n      sourced traffic,\
    \ and require large, contiguous blocks of unused IP\n      addresses - not always\
    \ feasible for enterprise network operators.\n      We introduce and evaluate\
    \ the Greynet - a region of IP address\n      space that is sparsely populated\
    \ with \"darknet\" addresses\n      interspersed with active (or \"lit\") IP addresses.\
    \  Based on a\n      small sample of traffic collected within a university campus\n\
    \      network we saw that relatively sparse greynets can achieve useful\n   \
    \   levels of network scan detection.\n   In other words, instead of setting aside\
    \ prefixes that an attacker\n   might attempt to probe and in so doing court discovery,\
    \ Harrop\n   proposed that individual (or small groups of adjacent) addresses\
    \ in\n   subnets be set aside for the purpose, using different host\n   identifiers\
    \ in each subnet to make it more difficult for an address\n   scan to detect them.\
    \  The concept has value in the sense that it is\n   harder to map the addresses\
    \ or prefixes out of an attacker's search\n   pattern, as their presence is more\
    \ obscure.  Harrop's research was\n   carried out using IPv4 [RFC0791] and yielded\
    \ interesting information.\n"
- title: 1.1.  History and Experience
  contents:
  - "1.1.  History and Experience\n   The research supporting this proposal includes\
    \ two prototypes, one\n   with IPv4 [RFC0791] and one with IPv6 [RFC2460].  Both\
    \ have\n   limitations, being research experiments as opposed to deployment of\
    \ a\n   finished product.\n   The original research was done by Warren Harrop\
    \ and documented in\n   [Harrop].  This was IPv4-only.  His premise was that one\
    \ would put a\n   virtual or physical machine on a LAN that one was not otherwise\n\
    \   using, and use it to identify scans of various kinds.  As reported in\n  \
    \ his paper, the concept worked effectively in a prototype deployment\n   at the\
    \ Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures (CAIA), Swinburne\n   University\
    \ of Technology.  The basic reason was that there was a\n   reasonable expectation\
    \ on the part of a potential attacker that a\n   given address might be represented,\
    \ and there was no pattern that\n   would enable the attacker to predict which\
    \ addresses were being used\n   in this way.  CAIA developed and released a prototype\
    \ FreeBSD-based\n   Greynet system in 2008 built around this premise [Armitage].\n\
    \   Baker's addition to his concept started from the router, the idea\n   that\
    \ the router would be highly likely to encounter any such scan if\n   it came\
    \ from off-LAN, and the fact that the router would have to use\n   Address Resolution\
    \ Protocol (ARP) or Neighbor Discovery (ND) to\n   identify -- or fail to identify\
    \ -- the machine in question.  In\n   effect, any address that is not currently\
    \ instantiated in the subnet\n   acts as a Greynet trigger address.  This clearly\
    \ also works for any\n   system that would implement ARP or ND, but the router\
    \ is an obvious\n   focal point in any subnet.\n   Tim Chown, of the School of\
    \ Electronics and Computer Science,\n   University of Southampton, offered privately\
    \ to do some research on\n   it, and had Owen Stephens do a Linux prototype in\
    \ spring 2010.  They\n   demonstrated that the technology was straightforward\
    \ to implement and\n   in fact worked in a prototype IPv6 implementation.\n  \
    \ The question that remains with IPv6 address scanning is the\n   likelihood that\
    \ the attack would occur at all.  Chown originally\n   argued in [RFC5157] that\
    \ address scans were impossible due to the\n   sheer number of possibilities.\
    \  However, in September 2010 a report\n   was made to NANOG of an IPv6 address\
    \ scan.  Additionally, there are\n   ways to limit the field; for example, one\
    \ can observe that a company\n   buys a certain kind of machine or network interface\
    \ card (NIC), and\n   therefore its probable EUI-64 addresses are limited to a\
    \ much smaller\n   range than 2^64 -- more like 2^24 addresses on a given subnet\
    \ -- or\n   one can observe DNS, SMTP envelopes, Extensible Messaging and\n  \
    \ Presence Protocol (XMPP) messages, FTP, HTTP, etc., that carry IP\n   addresses\
    \ in other ways.  Such attacks can be limited by the use of\n   Privacy Addresses\
    \ [RFC4941], which periodically change, rendering\n   historical information less\
    \ useful, but the fact is that such\n   analytic methods exist.\n"
- title: 2.  Deploying Greynets
  contents:
  - "2.  Deploying Greynets\n   Corporate IT departments and other network operators\
    \ frequently run\n   collectors or other kinds of sensors.  A collector is a computer\n\
    \   system on the Internet that is expressly set up to attract and \"trap\"\n\
    \   nefarious attempts to penetrate computer systems.  Such systems may\n   simply\
    \ record the attempt or the datagram that initiated the attempt\n   (darknets/Greynets),\
    \ or they may act as a decoy, luring in potential\n   attacks in order to study\
    \ their activities and study their methods\n   (honeypots).\n   To accomplish\
    \ this, we separate nefarious traffic from that which is\n   likely normal and\
    \ important, studying one and facilitating the other.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Deployment Using Routing - Darknets
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Deployment Using Routing - Darknets\n   One obvious way to isolate and\
    \ identify nefarious traffic is to\n   realize that it is sent to a prefix or\
    \ address that is not\n   instantiated.  If a campus uses an IPv4 /24 prefix or\
    \ an IPv6 /56\n   prefix but contains less than 100 actual subnets, for example,\
    \ we\n   might use only odd numbered subnets (128 of the 256 available in that\n\
    \   prefix), and not quite all of those.  Knowing that the active\n   prefixes\
    \ are more specific and therefore attract appropriate traffic,\n   we might also\
    \ advertise the default prefix from the collector,\n   attracting traffic directed\
    \ to the uninstantiated prefixes in that\n   routing domain.\n   A second question\
    \ involves mimicking a host under attack; the\n   collector may simply record\
    \ this uninvited traffic, or may reply as a\n   honeypot system.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Deployment Using Sparse Address Space - Greynets
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Deployment Using Sparse Address Space - Greynets\n   IPv4 subnets usually\
    \ have some unallocated space in them, if only\n   because Classless Inter-Domain\
    \ Routing (CIDR) allocates O(2^n)\n   addresses to an IP subnet and there are\
    \ not exactly that many systems\n   there.\n   Similarly, with active IPv6 prefixes,\
    \ even a very large switched LAN\n   is likely to use a small fraction of the\
    \ available addresses.  This\n   is by design, as discussed in Section 2.5.1 of\
    \ [RFC4291].  If the\n   addresses are distributed reasonably randomly among the\
    \ possible\n   values, the likelihood of an attacker guessing what addresses are\
    \ in\n   actual use is limited.  This gives us an opportunity with respect to\n\
    \   unused addresses within an IP prefix.\n   Routers use IPv4 ARP [RFC0826] and\
    \ IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861]\n   to determine the MAC (Media Access Control)\
    \ address of a neighbor to\n   which a datagram needs to be sent.  Both specifications\
    \ intend that\n   when a datagram arrives at a router that serves the target prefix,\n\
    \   but that doesn't know the MAC address of the intended destination, it\n  \
    \ should:\n   o  Enqueue the datagram,\n   o  Emit a Neighbor Solicitation or\
    \ ARP Request,\n   o  Await a Neighbor Advertisement or ARP Response, and\n  \
    \ o  On receipt, dequeue and forward the datagram.\n   Once the host's MAC address\
    \ is in the router's tables (and in so\n   doing the address proven valid), the\
    \ matter is not an issue.\n   In [Harrop], the Greynet is described as being instantiated\
    \ on an\n   end-host that replies to ARP Requests for all 'dark' IP addresses.\n\
    \   However, a small modification to router behavior can augment this\n   model.\
    \  As well as queuing or dropping a datagram that has triggered\n   an ARP Request\
    \ or Neighbor Solicitation, the router forwards a copy\n   of this datagram over\
    \ an independent link to the Greynet's analytic\n   equipment.  This independent\
    \ link may be a different physical\n   interface, a circuit, VLAN, tunnel, UDP,\
    \ or other encapsulation, or\n   in fact any place such a datagram could be handled.\
    \  Depending on the\n   requirements of the receiving collector, one could also\
    \ imagine\n   summarizing information in a form similar to IP Flow Information\n\
    \   Export (IPFIX) [RFC5101] [RFC5610].\n   The analytic equipment will now receive\
    \ two types of datagrams.  Of\n   most interest will be those destined for 'dark'\
    \ IP addresses.  Of\n   less interest will be the irregular case where a datagram\
    \ arrives for\n   a legitimate local neighbor who has, for some temporary reason,\
    \ no\n   MAC address in the router's tables.  Datagrams arriving for an IP\n \
    \  destination for which an ARP reply (or Neighbor Advertisement) has\n   not\
    \ yet received might also be forwarded to the analytical equipment\n   over the\
    \ independent link -- or might not, if they are considered to\n   be unlikely\
    \ to provide new analytic information.\n   Analytic equipment, depending on the\
    \ router to recognize 'dark' IP\n   addresses in this manner, can easily track\
    \ arrival patterns of\n   datagrams destined to unused parts of the network. \
    \ It may also\n   optionally choose to respond to such datagrams, acting as a\
    \ honeypot\n   to elicit further datagrams from the remote source.\n   If the\
    \ collector replies directly, the attacker may be able to\n   identify the fact\
    \ through information in or about the datagram -\n   datagrams sent to the same\
    \ IP subnet may come back with different TTL\n   values, for example.  Hence,\
    \ it may be advisable for the collector to\n   send the reply back through the\
    \ tunnel and therefore as if from the\n   same IP subnet.  Naturally, the collector\
    \ in this scenario should not\n   respond to datagrams destined for 'lit' IP addresses\
    \ -- the intended\n   destination will eventually respond to the router's ARP\
    \ or Neighbor\n   Solicitation anyway.\n   One implication of this model is that\
    \ distributed denial-of-service\n   (DDoS) attacks terminate on router subnets\
    \ within a network, as\n   opposed to stopping on inter-router links.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Other Filters
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Other Filters\n   An obvious extension of the concept would include traffic\
    \ identified\n   by other filters as appropriate to send to the collector.  For\n\
    \   example, one might configure the system to forward traffic that fail\n   a\
    \ unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) check [RFC2827] to the\n   collector\
    \ via the same tunnel.\n"
- title: 3.  Implications for Router Design
  contents:
  - "3.  Implications for Router Design\n   The implication for router design applies\
    \ to the IPv4 ARP and IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery algorithms.  It might be interesting\
    \ to provide,\n   under configuration control, the ability to forward to an analytic\n\
    \   system the arriving datagrams that trigger an ARP Request or Neighbor\n  \
    \ Solicit, and then fail to receive the intended response, to an\n   interface,\
    \ circuit, VLAN, or tunnel.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This note describes a tool for managing IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 network\n   security.  Like any tool, it has limitations and possible\
    \ attacks.\n   If discarding traffic under overload is a good thing, then holding\n\
    \   and subsequently forwarding the traffic instead places a potential\n   load\
    \ on the network and the router in question, and as such\n   represents a possible\
    \ attack.  Such an attack has obvious\n   mitigations, however; one simply selects\
    \ (in a manner the operator\n   deems appropriate) a subset of the traffic to\
    \ forward and discards\n   the rest.  In addition, this attack is not new; it\
    \ is only changed in\n   character.  A stream that would instantiate the attack\
    \ today results\n   in a load of ARP or Neighbor Solicit messages that all listening\n\
    \   hosts must intelligently discard.  The new attack additionally\n   consumes\
    \ bandwidth that is presumably set aside specifically for that\n   purpose.\n\
    \   The question of exactly what subset of traffic is interesting and\n   economical\
    \ to forward is intentionally left open.  Key questions in\n   algorithm design\
    \ include what can be learned from a given sample (Are\n   bursts happening? \
    \ If so, with what data?), what the impact on the\n   router and other equipment\
    \ in question is, how that might be\n   mitigated, etc.  Possible selection algorithms\
    \ dependent only on\n   state and algorithms typically available in a router include:\n\
    \   o  Select all datagrams that trigger an ARP Request or Neighbor\n      Solicit.\n\
    \   o  Select the subset of those that are not responded to within some\n    \
    \  stated interval and are therefore likely dark.\n   o  Select the subset of\
    \ those that are new; if the address is\n      currently being solicited, forwarding\
    \ redundant data may not be\n      useful.\n   o  Select all datagrams up to some\
    \ rate.\n   o  Select all datagrams matching (or not matching) a specified filter\n\
    \      rule.\n"

    \ by observing\n   backscatter traffic have been used by CAIDA, University of\
    \ Michigan,\n   Team Cymru, and others.  Harrop extended them in his research.\
    \  This\n   formulation of the notion originated in a discussion among the\n \
    \  authors in 2005.  This note grew out of a conversation with Paul\n   Vixie\
    \ and Rhette Marsh on Internet traffic sensors; they also made\n   useful comments\
    \ on it.  Albert Manfredi commented on the distinction\n   between a LAN (as defined\
    \ by IEEE 802) and an IP subnet.\n   Tim Chown [RFC5157] has observed that, at\
    \ least at the time of\n   writing that RFC, address scanning attacks in IPv6\
    \ have not been\n   reported in the wild.  However, as mentioned in Section 1.1\
    \ above, a\n   (partial) scanning attack was recently reported on the NANOG mailing\n\
    \   list.  Rhette Marsh has suggested the structure of such an attack,\n   however,\
    \ and Fred Baker has suggested approaches based on addressing\n   information\
    \ exchanged by applications.  Hence, we believe that such\n   issues may be relevant\
    \ to IPv6 in the future, when IPv6 is a more\n   interesting target.\n   Tim Chown\
    \ and Owen Stephens tested the proposal, and made useful\n   comments that have\
    \ been incorporated in this text.  His fundamental\n   comment was, however, that\
    \ \"it works\".\n"
