  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a set of mappings which will enable inter\n\
    \   working between systems operating the CCITT X.400 ( 1984 / 1988 )\n   Recommendations\
    \ on Message Handling Systems, and systems running the\n   Mail-11 (also known\
    \ as DECnet mail) protocol. The specifications are\n   valid within DECnet Phase\
    \ IV addressing and routing scheme.\n   The complete scenario of X.400 / RFC822\
    \ / Mail-11 is also considered,\n   in order to cover the possible complex cases\
    \ arising in multiple\n   gateway translations.\n   This document covers mainly\
    \ the O/R address to DECnet from/to address\n   mapping (and vice versa); other\
    \ mappings are based on RFC 1327 and\n   its eventual future updates.\n   This\
    \ is a combined effort of COSINE S2.2, the RARE MSG Working Group,\n   and the\

  contents:
  - "1.4. The user community\n   The community using X.400 messaging system is currently\
    \ growing in\n   the whole world, but there is still a number of very large\n\
    \   communities using Mail-11 based messaging systems willing to\n   communicate\
    \ easily with X.400 based Message Handling Systems. Among\n   these large DECnet\
    \ based networks we can include the High Energy\n   Physics network (HEPnet) and\
    \ the Space Physics Analysis Network\n   (SPAN).\n   These DECnet communities\
    \ will in the future possibly migrate to\n   DECnet Phase V (DECnet-OSI) protocols,\
    \ converting thus their\n   messaging systems to OSI specifications, i.e., merging\
    \ into the X.400\n   MHS; however the transition period could be long, and there\
    \ could\n   always be some DECnet Phase IV communities around.\n   For these reasons\
    \ a set of mapping rules covering conversion between\n   Mail-11 and X.400 is\
    \ described in this document.\n   This document also covers the case of Mail-11\
    \ systems implementing\n   the \"foreign mail protocol\" allowing Mail-11 to interface\
    \ other mail\n   systems, including RFC822 based system.\n"

    \  where a message is relayed between two X.400 MHS via a DECnet network\n   this\
    \ could result in a nearly complete loss of information. To\n   minimise this\
    \ inconvenience most of X.400 service elements will be\n   mapped into Mail-11\
    \ text body parts. To consider also the case when a\n   message originates from\
    \ a network implementing RFC822 protocols and\n   is relayed via Mail-11 to and\
    \ X.400 MHS, the applied mapping from\n   X.400 service elements into Mail-11\

- title: 5.1. Mapping scheme
  contents:
  - "5.1. Mapping scheme\n   DECnet address field is somehow a 'flat land' with some\
    \ obliged\n   routes to reach some hidden areas. Thus a truly hierarchical mapping\n\
    \   scheme using mapping tables as suitable for RFC822 is not the\n   appropriate\
    \ solution. A fixed set of rules using DDAs support is\n   defined in order to\
    \ define the mapping.\n   Another important aspect of the problem is the coexistence\
    \ of many\n   disjoint DECnet networks, using the same DECnet address space, i.e.,\n\
    \   common X.400 and/or RFC822 mailing system acting as glue to connect\n   different\
    \ isolated Mail-11 islands. Thus, to identify uniquely each\n   DECnet network\
    \ we must also introduce the concept of 'DECnet network\n   name', which we will\
    \ refer shortly as 'net' from now onwards. We\n   define as 'net' a unique ASCII\
    \ string identifying the DECnet network\n   we are connected to. To be more specific,\
    \ the 'net' element will\n   identify the DECnet community being served, i.e.,\
    \ it could also\n   differ from the actual official network name. Aliases are\
    \ allowed for\n   the\n       net = 'HEPnet'       the High Energy Physics DECnet\
    \ network\n       net = 'SPAN'         the Space Physics Analysis Network\n  \
    \     net = 'Enet'         the Digital Equipment Corporate Network\n   The need\
    \ of labelling each DECnet network with its name comes also\n   from the requirement\
    \ to implement the 'intelligent' gateway, i.e.,\n   the gateway which is able\
    \ to understand its ability to connect\n   directly to the specified DECnet network,\
    \ even if the O/R address\n   specify a path to a different gateway. A more detailed\
    \ discussion of\n   the problem is in 5.3 and 5.5.\n   A registry of 'net' attributes\
    \ and their correspondent gateways must\n   also be implemented to insure uniqueness\
    \ of names. A simple table\n   coupling 'net' and the gateway address is used,\
    \ in a syntax similar\n   to the 'gate' table used in RFC1327. An example:\n \
    \       HEPnet#OU$Cosine-gw.O$@.PRMD$infn.ADMD$garr.C$IT#\n        SPAN#OU$Cosine-gw.O$@.PRMD$infn.ADMD$garr.C$IT#\n\
    \        SPAN#O$ESRIN1.PRMD$esa.ADMD$Master400.C$it#\n   Ambiguous left entries\
    \ are allowed. Gateway implementations could\n   simply choose among one of them,\
    \ or try them all in cyclic order to\n   obtain better performances.\n   In order\
    \ to keep the mapping rules very simple, avoiding the need to\n   analyse Mail-11\
    \ addresses to distinguish the 'route', 'node' and\n   needed to cover the mapping\
    \ problem.\n"

- title: A.1 Introduction
  contents:
  - "A.1 Introduction\n   The implementation of a Mail-11 - RFC822 gateway was faced\
    \ by many\n   software developers independently, and was included in many mail\n\
    \   products which were running on both VAX/VMS and UNIX systems. As\n   there\
    \ was not a unique standard mapping way, the implementations\n   resulted into\
    \ a number of possible variant methods to map a Mail-11\n   address into an RFC822\
    \ one. Some of these products became then\n   largely widespread, starting to\
    \ create a number of de facto mapping\n   methods.\n   In this small appendix\
    \ some sort of standardisation of the mapping\n   problem is considered, trying\
    \ to be compatible with the existing\n   installed software. We must also remind\
    \ that, in some cases, only\n   simple Mail-11 addresses could be mapped into\
    \ RFC822, having complex\n   ones producing all sort of quite strange results.\n\
    \   On the other hand, the mapping of an RFC822 address in Mail-11 was\n   quite\
    \ straightforward, resulting in a common definition which uses\n   \"Mail-11 foreign\
    \ mail protocol\" to design an RFC822 address:\n      [[node::][node::]...]prot%\"\
    rfc-822-address\"\n   or\n      [node::][node::]...]::\"rfc-822-address\"\n"
- title: A.2 De facto implementations
  contents:
  - "A.2 De facto implementations\n   A considerable number of de-facto implementations\
    \ of Mail-11/RFC822\n   gateways is existing. As said in the introduction, the\
    \ mapping of\n   RFC822 addresses in Mail-11 is accomplished using the foreign\
    \ mail\n   protocol syntax and is thus unique.\n   On the other hand, Mail-11\
    \ addresses are encoded in RFC822 syntax in\n   various ways. Here are the most\
    \ common ones:\n        a) \"node::user\"@gateway-address\n        b) user%node@gateway-address\n\
    \        c) user@node.decnet.domains\n        d) user%node.dnet@gateway-address\n\
    \   Let's have a quick look to these different choices.\n   a - This form simply\
    \ encloses as quoted Left Hand Side string the\n       original Mail-11 address\
    \ into the RFC822 address of the\n       Mail-11/RFC822 gateway. This method is\
    \ fully conformant with\n       RFC822 syntax, and the Mail-11 address is left\
    \ untouched; thus\n       no encoding rules need to applied to it.\n   b - As\
    \ one will immediately notice, this form has nothing in it\n       indicating\
    \ the address is a Mail-11 one; this makes the encoding\n       indistinguishable\
    \ from a similar encoding of RSCS (BITnet)\n       addresses used by some IBM\
    \ VM Mailer systems. It should thus be\n       deprecated.\n   c - In this case\
    \ a sort of 'reserved word' (decnet)  embedded into\n       the address itself\
    \ identifies the presence of a Mail-11 original\n       address preceding it.\
    \ The decoding is possible, dropping\n       'domains' and extracting 'user' and\
    \ 'node' parts. However complex\n       Mail-11 addresses cannot be mapped properly\
    \ in this syntax, and\n       there is no specific rule for adding the 'domains'\
    \ part of the\n       address.\n   d - In this case again there is a 'reserved\
    \ word' (dnet)  which make\n       possible the identification of the original\
    \ Mail-11 address;\n       'gateway-address' points to the Mail-11/RFC822 gateway\
    \ and 'node'\n       and 'user' information can be easily drawn from the address.\n\
    \       However complex Mail-11 addresses cannot be embedded easily into\n   \
    \    this syntax.\n"

    \ no way to specify in these mappings the name of the decnet\n   community owning\
    \ the encoded address, as it was done for X.400, thus\n   the implementation of\
