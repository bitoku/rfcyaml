    \  access.  IEEE 802.16 has specified multiple service-specific\n   Convergence
    Sublayers for transmitting upper-layer protocols.  The\n   Packet CS (Packet Convergence
    Sublayer) is used for the transport of\n   all packet-based protocols such as
    the Internet Protocol (IP) and\n   IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet).  The IP-specific part
    of the Packet CS enables\n   the transport of IPv4 packets directly over the IEEE
    802.16 Media\n   Access Control (MAC) layer.\n   This document specifies the frame
    format, the Maximum Transmission\n   Unit (MTU), and the address assignment procedures
    for transmitting\n   IPv4 packets over the IP-specific part of the Packet Convergence\n

    technology\n   for the last mile.  The IEEE 802.16 specification includes the\n
    \  Physical (PHY) and Media Access Control (MAC) layers.  The MAC layer\n   includes
    various Convergence Sublayers (CSs) for transmitting higher-\n   layer packets,
    including IPv4 packets [IEEE802_16].\n   The scope of this specification is limited
    to the operation of IPv4\n   over the IP-specific part of the Packet CS (referred
    to as \"IPv4 CS\")\n   for hosts served by a network that utilizes the IEEE Std
    802.16 air\n   interface.\n   This document specifies a method for encapsulating
    and transmitting\n   IPv4 [RFC0791] packets over the IPv4 CS of IEEE 802.16.  This\n
    \  document also specifies the MTU and address assignment method for\n   hosts

  - "4.  IPv4 CS Link in 802.16 Networks\n   In 802.16, the transport connection between
    an MS and a BS is used to\n   transport user data, i.e., IPv4 packets in this
    case.  A transport\n   connection is represented by a service flow, and multiple
    transport\n   connections can exist between an MS and a BS.\n   When an AR and
    a BS are co-located, the collection of transport\n   connections to an MS is defined
    as a single IPv4 link.  When an AR\n   and a BS are separated, it is recommended
    that a tunnel be\n   established between the AR and a BS whose granularity is
    no greater\n   than \"per MS\" or \"per service flow\".  (An MS can have multiple\n
    \  service flows, which are identified by a service flow ID.)  Then the\n   tunnel(s)
    for an MS, in combination with the MS's transport\n   connections, forms a single
    point-to-point IPv4 link.\n   Each host belongs to a different IPv4 link and is
    assigned a unique\n   IPv4 address, similar to the recommendations discussed in

    - "4.3.  Maximum Transmission Unit\n   The MTU value for IPv4 packets on an IEEE
      802.16 link is configurable\n   (e.g., see the end of this section for some
      possible mechanisms).\n   The default MTU for IPv4 packets over an IEEE 802.16
      link SHOULD be\n   1500 octets.  Given the possibility for \"in-the-network\"
      tunneling,\n   supporting this MTU at the end hosts has implications on the\n
      \  underlying network, for example, as discussed in [RFC4459].\n   Per [RFC5121],
      Section 6.3, the IP MTU can vary to be larger or\n   smaller than 1500 octets.\n
      \  If an MS transmits 1500-octet packets in a deployment with a smaller\n   MTU,
      packets from the MS may be dropped at the link layer silently.\n   Unlike IPv6,
      in which departures from the default MTU are readily\n   advertised via the
      MTU option in Neighbor Discovery (via router\n   advertisement), there is no
      similarly reliable mechanism in IPv4, as\n   the legacy IPv4 client implementations
      do not determine the link MTU\n   by default before sending packets.  Even though
      there is a DHCP\n   option to accomplish this, DHCP servers are required to
      provide the\n   MTU information only when requested.\n   Discovery and configuration
      of the proper link MTU value ensures\n   adequate usage of the network bandwidth
      and resources.  Accordingly,\n   deployments should avoid packet loss due to
      a mismatch between the\n   default MTU and the configured link MTUs.\n   Some
      of the mechanisms available for the IPv4 CS host to find out the\n   link's
      MTU value and mitigate MTU-related issues are:\n   o  Recent revision of 802.16
      by the IEEE (see IEEE 802.16-2009\n      [IEEE802_16]) to (among other things)
      allow the provision of the\n      Service Data Unit or MAC MTU in the IEEE 802.16
      SBC-REQ/SBC-RSP\n      phase, such that clients that are compliant with IEEE
      802.16 can\n      infer and configure the negotiated MTU size for the IPv4 CS
      link.\n      However, the implementation must communicate the negotiated MTU\n
      \     value to the IP layer to adjust the IP Maximum Payload Size for\n      proper
      handling of fragmentation.  Note that this method is useful\n      only when
      the MS is directly connected to the BS.\n   o  Configuration and negotiation
      of MTU size at the network layer by\n      using the DHCP interface MTU option
      [RFC2132].\n   This document recommends that implementations of IPv4 and IPv4
      CS\n   clients SHOULD use the DHCP interface MTU option [RFC2132] in order\n
      \  to configure its interface MTU accordingly.\n   In the absence of DHCP MTU
      configuration, the client node (MS) has\n   two alternatives: 1) use the default
      MTU (1500 bytes), or 2)\n   determine the MTU by the methods described in IEEE
      802.16-2009\n   [IEEE802_16].\n   Additionally, the clients are encouraged to
      run Path MTU (PMTU)\n   Discovery [RFC1191] or Packetization Layer Path MTU
      Discovery\n   (PLPMTUD) [RFC4821].  However, the PMTU mechanism has inherent\n
      \  problems of packet loss due to ICMP messages not reaching the sender\n   and
      IPv4 routers not fragmenting the packets due to the Don't\n   Fragment (DF)
      bit being set in the IP packet.  The above-mentioned\n   path MTU mechanisms
      will take care of the MTU size between the MS and\n   its correspondent node
      across different flavors of convergence layers\n   in the access networks.\n"

    with a 32-bit\n   prefix length or subnet mask.  The point-to-point link between

    \  (identified by service flows) and an L2 tunnel (e.g., a Generic\n   Routing
    Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel) for each MS between the BS and\n   the AR.  If the
    AR is co-located with the BS, then the set of IEEE\n   802.16 MAC connections
    between the MS and the BS/AR represent the\n   point-to-point connection.\n   The

    MSs using two different Convergence Sublayers (e.g., an\n   MS using Ethernet
    CS only and another MS using IPv4 CS only) cannot\n   communicate at the data
    link layer and require interworking at the IP\n   layer.  For this reason, these
    two nodes must be configured to be on\n   two different subnets.  For more information,

  - "Appendix B.  Sending and Receiving IPv4 Packets\n   IEEE 802.16 MAC is a point-to-multipoint
    connection-oriented air\n   interface, and the process of sending and receiving
    IPv4 packets is\n   different from multicast-capable shared-medium technologies
    like\n   Ethernet.\n   Before any packets are transmitted, an IEEE 802.16 transport\n
    \  connection must be established.  This connection consists of an\n   IEEE 802.16
    MAC transport connection between the MS and the BS and an\n   L2 tunnel between
    the BS and the AR (if these two are not\n   co-located).  This IEEE 802.16 transport
    connection provides a point-\n   to-point link between the MS and the AR.  All
    the packets originating\n   at the MS always reach the AR before being transmitted
    to the final\n   destination.\n   IPv4 packets are carried directly in the payload
    of IEEE 802.16\n   frames when the IPv4 CS is used.  IPv4 CS classifies the packet
    based\n   on upper-layer (IP and transport layers) header fields to place the\n
    \  packet on one of the available connections identified by the CID.\n   The classifiers
    for the IPv4 CS are source and destination IPv4\n   addresses, source and destination
    ports, Type-of-Service, and IP\n   Protocol field.  The CS may employ Packet Header
    Suppression (PHS)\n   after the classification.\n   The BS optionally reconstructs
    the payload header if PHS is in use.\n   It then tunnels the packet that has been
    received on a particular MAC\n   connection to the AR.  Similarly, the packets
    received on a tunnel\n   interface from the AR would be mapped to a particular
    CID using the\n   IPv4 classification mechanism.\n   The AR performs normal routing
    for the packets that it receives,\n   processing them per its forwarding table.
    \ However, the DHCP relay\n   agent in the AR MUST maintain the tunnel interface
    on which it\n   receives DHCP requests so that it can relay the DHCP responses
    to the\n   correct MS.  The particular method is out of scope of this\n   specification
    as it need not depend on any particularities of\n   IEEE 802.16.\n"

  - "Appendix C.  WiMAX IPv4 CS MTU Size\n   The WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability
    for Microwave Access) forum has\n   defined a network architecture [WMF].  Furthermore,
    WiMAX has\n   specified IPv4 CS support for transmission of IPv4 packets between\n
    \  the MS and the BS over the IEEE 802.16 link.  The WiMAX IPv4 CS and\n   this
    specification are similar.  One significant difference, however,\n   is that the
    WiMAX Forum [WMF] has specified the IP MTU as 1400 octets\n   [WMF] as opposed
    to 1500 in this specification.\n   Hence, if an IPv4 CS MS configured with an
    MTU of 1500 octets enters\n   a WiMAX network, some of the issues mentioned in
    this specification\n   may arise.  As mentioned in Section 4.3, the possible mechanisms
    are\n   not guaranteed to work.  Furthermore, an IPv4 CS client is not\n   capable
    of doing ARP probing to find out the link MTU.  On the other\n   hand, it is imperative
    for an MS to know the link MTU size.  In\n   practice, an MS should be able to
    sense or deduce the fact that it is\n   operating within a WiMAX network (e.g.,
    given the WiMAX-specific\n   particularities of the authentication and network
    entry procedures),\n   and adjust its MTU size accordingly.  Even though this
    method is not\n   perfect, and the potential for conflict may remain, this document\n
    \  recommends a default MTU of 1500.  This represents the WG's consensus\n   (after
    much debate) to select the best value for IEEE 802.16 from the\n   point of view
    of the IETF, in spite of the WiMAX Forum's deployment.\n"
