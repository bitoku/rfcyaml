  - "1. Introduction\n   In wireless environments, and especially in cellular systems,\
    \ such as\n   GSM/GPRS, there is a need to maximize the transport efficiency of\n\
    \   data over the radio interface.  The radio spectrum is rather\n   expensive\
    \ and must be carefully used.  Therefore, the cellular\n   systems must support\
    \ a sufficient number of users to make them\n   economically feasible.  Thus,\
    \ there is a limitation in the per user\n   bandwidth.\n   Compressing the headers\
    \ of the network and transport protocols used\n   for carrying user data is one\
    \ way to make more efficient use of the\n   scarce radio resources [ROHC].  However,\
    \ compression of the messages\n   from signaling protocols, such as SIP/SDP, should\
    \ also be considered\n   to increase the radio resource usage even further.  Compression\
    \ will\n   also improve the service quality by reducing the user idle time at\n\
    \   e.g., call setup.  When IP is used end-to-end, new applications, such\n  \
    \ as streaming, will be brought to tiny end-hosts, such as cellular\n   devices.\
    \  This will introduce additional traffic in cellular systems.\n   Compression\
    \ of signaling messages, such as RTSP [RTSP], should also\n   be considered to\
    \ improve both the service availability and quality.\n   New services with their\
    \ corresponding signaling protocols make it\n   reasonable to consider a scheme\
    \ that is generic.  The scheme should\n   be generic in the meaning that the scheme\
    \ can efficiently be applied\n   to arbitrary protocols with certain characteristics,\
    \ such as the\n   ASCII based protocols SIP and RTSP.\n"

  - "1.1. Protocol Characteristics\n   The following application signaling protocols\
    \ are examples of\n   protocols that are expected to be commonly used in the future.\
    \  Some\n   of their characteristics are described below.\n"
- title: 1.1.1 SIP
  contents:
  - "1.1.1 SIP\n   The Session Initiation Protocol [SIP] is an application layer\n\
    \   protocol for establishing, modifying and terminating multimedia\n   sessions\
    \ or calls.  These sessions include Internet multimedia\n   conferences, Internet\
    \ telephony and similar applications.  SIP can be\n   used over either TCP [TCP]\
    \ or UDP [UDP].  SIP is a text based\n   protocol, using ISO 10646 in UTF-8 encoding.\n"
- title: 1.1.2 SDP
  contents:
  - "1.1.2 SDP\n   The Session Description Protocol [SDP] is used to advertise\n \
    \  multimedia conferences and communicate conference addresses and\n   conference\
    \ tool specific information.  It is also used for general\n   real-time multimedia\
    \ session description purposes.  SDP is carried in\n   the message body of SIP\
    \ and RTSP messages.  SDP is text based using\n   the ISO 10646 character set\
    \ in UTF-8 encoding.\n"
- title: 1.1.3 RTSP
  contents:
  - "1.1.3 RTSP\n   The Real Time Streaming Protocol [RTSP] is an application level\n\
    \   protocol for controlling the delivery of data with real-time\n   properties,\
    \ such as audio and video.  RTSP may use UDP or TCP (or\n   other) as a transport\
    \ protocol.  RTSP is text based using the ISO\n   10646 character set in UTF-8\
    \ encoding.\n"
- title: 1.1.4 Protocol Similarities
  contents:
  - "1.1.4 Protocol Similarities\n   The above protocols have many similarities. \
    \ These similarities will\n   have implications on solutions to the problems they\
    \ create in\n   conjunction with e.g., cellular radio access.  The similarities\n\
    \   include:\n   -  Requests and reply characteristics.  When a sender sends a\n\
    \      request, it stays idle until it has received a response.  Hence,\n    \
    \  it typically takes a number of round trip times to conclude e.g.,\n      a\
    \ SIP session.\n   -  They are ASCII based.\n   -  They are generous in size in\
    \ order to provide the necessary\n      information to the session participants.\n\
    \   -  SIP and RTSP share many common header field names, methods and\n      status\
    \ codes.  The traffic patterns are also similar.  The\n      signaling is carried\
    \ out primarily under the set up phase.  For\n      SIP, this means that the majority\
    \ of the signaling is carried out\n      to set up a phone call or multimedia\
    \ session.  For RTSP, the\n      majority of the signaling is done before the\
    \ transmission of\n      application data.\n"
- title: 1.2. Cellular System Radio Characteristics
  contents:
  - "1.2. Cellular System Radio Characteristics\n   Partly to enable high utilization\
    \ of cellular systems, and partly due\n   to the unreliable nature of the radio\
    \ media, cellular links have\n   characteristics that differ somewhat from a typical\
    \ fixed link, e.g.,\n   copper or fiber.  The most important characteristics are\
    \ the lossy\n   behavior of cellular links and the large round trip times.\n \
    \  The quality in a radio system typically changes from one radio frame\n   to\
    \ another due to fading in the radio channel.  Due to the nature of\n   the radio\
    \ media and interference from other radio users, the average\n   bit error rate\
    \ (BER) can be 10e-3 with a variation roughly between\n   10e-2 to 10e-4.  To\
    \ be able to use the radio media with its error\n   characteristics, methods such\
    \ as forward error correction (FEC) and\n   interleaving are used.  If these methods\
    \ were not used, the BER of a\n   cellular radio channel would be around 10 %.\
    \  Thus, radio links are,\n   by nature, error prone.  The final packet loss rate\
    \ may be further\n   reduced by applying low level retransmissions (ARQ) over\
    \ the radio\n   channel; however, this trades decreased packet loss rate for a\
    \ larger\n   delay.  By applying methods to decrease BER, the system delay is\n\
    \   increased.  In some cellular systems, the algorithmic channel round\n   trip\
    \ delay is in the order of 80 ms. Other sources of delays are\n   DSP-processing,\
    \ node-internal delay and transmission.  A general\n   value for the RTT is difficult\
    \ to state, but it might be as high as\n   200 ms.\n   For cellular systems it\
    \ is of vital importance to have a sufficient\n   number of users per cell; otherwise\
    \ the system cost would prohibit\n   deployment.  It is crucial to use the existing\
    \ bandwidth carefully;\n   hence the average user bit rate is typically relatively\
    \ low compared\n   to the average user bit rate in wired line systems.  This is\n\
    \   especially important for mass market services like voice.\n"

    \ of SIP signaling between two termination\n   points with a wireless link between,\
    \ and the resulting delay under\n   certain system assumptions.\n   It should\
    \ be noted that the used figures represent a very narrow band\n   link.  E.g.,\
    \ a WCDMA system can provide maximum bit rates up to 2\n   Mbits/s in ideal conditions,\
    \ but that means one single user would\n   consume all radio resources in the\
    \ cell.  For a mass market service\n   such as voice, it is always crucial to\
    \ reduce the bandwidth\n   requirements for each user.\n   Client            \

- title: 2.1.1 Delay Results
  contents:
  - "2.1.1 Delay Results\n   Applying equation 1 to each SIP/SDP message shown in\
    \ the example of\n   Figure 2.1 gives a total delay of 4131 ms from the first\
    \ SIP/SDP\n   message to the last.  The RSVP and Session Management (Radio Bearer\n\
    \   setup), displayed in Figure 2.1, will add approximately 1.5 seconds\n   to\
    \ the total delay, using equation 1.  However, there will also be\n   RSVP and\
    \ SM signaling prior to the SIP INVITE message to establish\n   the radio bearer,\
    \ which would add approximately another 1.5 seconds.\n   In [TSG] there is a comparison\
    \ between GERAN call setup using SIP and\n   ordinary GSM call setup.  For a typical\
    \ GSM call setup, the time is\n   about 3.6 seconds, and for the case when using\
    \ SIP, the call setup is\n   approximately 7.9 seconds.\n   Another situation\
    \ that would benefit from reduced signaling is\n   carrying signaling messages\
    \ over narrow bandwidth links in mid-call.\n   For GERAN, this will result in\
    \ frame stealing with degraded speech\n   quality as a result.\n   Thus, solutions\
    \ are needed to reduce the signaling delay and the\n   required bandwidth when\
    \ considering both system bandwidth\n   requirements and service setup delays.\n"
- title: 3. Alternatives for Signaling Reduction
  contents:
  - "3. Alternatives for Signaling Reduction\n   More or less attractive solutions\
    \ to the previously mentioned\n   problems can be outlined:\n   -  Increase the\
    \ user bit rate\n      An increase of the bit rate per user will decrease the\
    \ number of\n      users per cell.  There exist systems (for example WCDMA) which\
    \ can\n      provide high bit rates and even variable rates, e.g., at the setup\n\
    \      of new sessions.  However, there are also systems, e.g., GSM/EDGE,\n  \
    \    where it is not possible to reach these high bit rates in all\n      situations.\
    \  At the cell borders, for example, the signal strength\n      to noise ratio\
    \ will be lower and result in a lower bit rate.  In\n      general, an unnecessary\
    \ increase of the bit rate should be avoided\n      due to the higher system cost\
    \ introduced and the possibility of\n      denial of service.  The latter could,\
    \ for example, be caused by\n      lack of enough bandwidth to support the sending\
    \ of the large setup\n      message within a required time period, which is set\
    \ for QoS\n      reasons.\n   -  Decrease the RTT of the cellular link\n     \
    \ Decreasing the RTT would require substantial system changes and is\n      thus\
    \ not feasible in the short term.  Further, the RTT-delay\n      caused by interleaving\
    \ and FEC will always have to be present\n      regardless of which system is\
    \ used.  Otherwise the BER will be too\n      high for the received data to be\
    \ useful, or alternatively trigger\n      retransmissions giving an average total\
    \ delay of the same or\n      higher magnitude.\n   -  Optimize message sequence\
    \ for the protocols\n      If the request/response pattern could be eased up,\
    \ then \"keeping\n      the pipe full\" could be a way forward.  Thus, instead\
    \ of following\n      the message sequence described in Figure 4.2, more than\
    \ one\n      message would be sent in a row, even though no response has been\n\
    \      received.  However, this would entail protocol changes and may be\n   \
    \   difficult at the current date.\n   -  Protocol stripping\n      Removing fields\
    \ from a message would decrease the size of the\n      messages to some extent.\
    \  However, this would cause the loss of\n      transparency and thus violate\
    \ the End-to-End principle and is thus\n      not desirable.\n   -  Compression\n\
    \      By compressing messages, the impact of the mentioned problems\n      could\
    \ be decreased.  Compared to the other possible solutions\n      compression can\
    \ be made, and must be, transparent to the end-user\n      application.  Thus,\
    \ compression seems to be the most attractive\n      way forward.\n"

    \ into two parts.  Section 5.1 sets\n   general requirements concerning the Internet\
    \ infrastructure, while\n   Section 5.2 sets requirements on the scheme itself.\n"
- title: 5.1. General Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.1. General Requirements\n   1.  Transparency: When a message is compressed\
    \ and then decompressed,\n       the result must be bitwise identical to the original\
    \ message.\n       Justification: This is to ensure that the compression scheme\
    \ will\n       not cause problems for any current or future part of the Internet\n\
    \       infrastructure.\n       Note: See also requirement 9.\n   2.  Header compression\
    \ coexistence: The compression scheme must be\n       able to coexist with header\
    \ compression, especially the ROHC\n       protocol.\n       Justification: Signaling\
    \ compression is used because there is a\n       need to conserve bandwidth usage.\
    \  In that case, header\n       compression will likely be needed too.\n   3a.\
    \ Compatibility: The compression scheme must be constructed in such\n       a\
    \ way that it allows the above protocols' mechanisms to negotiate\n       whether\
    \ the compression scheme is to be applied or not.\n       Justification: Two entities\
    \ must be able to communicate\n       regardless if the signaling compression\
    \ scheme is implemented at\n       both entities or not.\n   3b. Ubiquity: Modifications\
    \ to the protocols generating the messages\n       that are to be compressed,\
    \ must not be required for the\n       compression scheme to work.\n       Justification:\
    \ This will simplify deployment of the compression\n       scheme.\n       Note:\
    \ This does not preclude making extensions, which are related\n       to the signaling\
    \ compression scheme, to existing protocols, as\n       long as the extensions\
    \ are backward compatible.\n   4.  Generality: Compression of arbitrary message\
    \ streams must be\n       supported.  The signaling compression scheme must not\
    \ be limited\n       to certain protocols, traffic patterns or sessions.  It must\
    \ not\n       assume any message pattern to be able to perform compression.\n\
    \       Justification: There might be a future need for compression of\n     \
    \  different ASCII based signaling protocols.  This requirement will\n       minimize\
    \ future work.\n       Note: This does not preclude optimization for certain streams.\n\
    \   5.  Unidirectional routes: The compression scheme must be able to\n      \
    \ operate on unidirectional routes, i.e., without explicit feedback\n       messages\
    \ from the decompressor.\n       Note: Implementations on unidirectional routes\
    \ might possibly\n       show a degraded performance compared to implementations\
    \ on bi-\n       directional routes.\n   6.  Transport: The solution must work\
    \ for both unreliable and\n       reliable underlying transport protocols, e.g.,\
    \ UDP and TCP.\n       Justification: The protocols, which generate the messages\
    \ that\n       are to be compressed, may use either an unreliable or a reliable\n\
    \       underlying transport.\n       Note: This should not be taken to mean that\
    \ the same set of\n       solution mechanisms must be used over both unreliable\
    \ and\n       reliable transport.\n"

    \ against\n       errors undetected by lower layers, i.e., the probability of\n\
    \       incorrect decompression caused by such undetected errors must be\n   \
    \    low.\n       Justification: A primary target for the signaling compression\n\
    \       scheme is cellular systems, where undetected errors might be\n       introduced\
    \ on the cellular link.\n   10. Error propagation: Propagation of errors due to\
    \ signaling\n       compression should be kept at an absolute minimum.  Loss or\n\
    \       damage to a single or several messages, between compressor and\n     \
    \  decompressor should not prevent compression and decompression of\n       later\
    \ messages.\n       Justification: Error propagation reduces resource utilization\
    \ and\n       quality.\n   11. Delay: The compression scheme must be able to perform\
    \ compression\n       and decompression of messages under all expected delay\n\
    \       conditions.\n"

  - "5.2.2. Compression Efficiency\n   This section states requirements related to\
    \ compression efficiency.\n   12. Message loss: Loss or damage to a single or\
    \ several messages, on\n       the link between compressor and decompressor, should\
    \ not prevent\n       the usage of later messages in the compression and decompression\n\
    \       process.\n   13. Moderate message misordering: The scheme should allow\
    \ for the\n       correct decompression of messages, that have been moderately\n\
    \       misordered (1-2 messages) between compressor and decompressor.\n     \
    \  The scheme should not prevent the usage of later messages in the\n       compression\
    \ and decompression process.\n       Justification: Misordering is frequent on\
    \ the Internet, and this\n       kind of misordering is common.\n"
