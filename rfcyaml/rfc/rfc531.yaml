  - "                            Feast or famine?\n        A Response to Two Recent\
    \ RFC's About Network Information\nIn RFC 514, Will Kantrowitz returns to the\
    \ theme of his superb RFC 459.\nThere are too many people spending too much time\
    \ asking for too much\ninformation about Network Hosts.  In RFC 519, John Pickens\
    \ returns to\nthe theme of his rather querulous RFC 369.  It's not easy to learn\
    \ how\nto use network Hosts.  On the one hand, it would seem that there's a\n\
    veritable feast of information going around; on the other hand it would\nseem\
    \ that there's a terrible famine.  Can this apparent contradiction be\nresolved?\n\
    I think it can be, and will attempt to do so after making a few\nobservations\
    \ about the respective poles.  In regard to the issues\nKantrowitz raises, matters\
    \ are perhaps even worse for the \"big\" Servers\nthan for the experimental ones;\
    \ we have something like 50 CUBIC feet of\nsystem listings for Multics, plus untold\
    \ user-supplied programs which\nmight be of interest, plus several thousand employees\
    \ (if our \"site\" is\nconstrued to mean M.I.T. as a whole) -- surely they didn't\
    \ want all\nthat, even before the request was withdrawn.\nBut what of the issues\
    \ Pickens raises?  Surely prospective users ought\nto have some means of learning\
    \ about the resources available.   The\npoint, it seems to me, is that they do\
    \ ... but they aren't using them.\nAs Network Technical Liaison for Multics, I've\
    \ never heard from any of\nthe U.C.S.B. investigators.  I don't even recall their\
    \ having requested\na Multics Programmers Manual despite the fact that our Resource\
    \ Notebook\nsection offers one to any Network site, on request.  I do recall seeing\n\
    instance after instance of botched login attempts from them in our error\nlogs,\
    \ though.  I called their Liaison to alert him to the problem but\nthey weren't\
    \ in touch with him either.)  I also recall saying time after\ntime, after seeing\
    \ them floundering around, \"it's a pity nobody reads\nthe Resource Notebook.\"\
    \nThat, I think, is the key: we have a Resource Notebook; it lists\nTechnical\
    \ Liaisons; it gives information about the Hosts thought to be\nrelevant to Network\
    \ users; it gives references to other published\ninformation.  _Why_don't_we_use_it_???\
    \  Sure, not all the sections are\nup to par.  Sure, some sorts of information\
    \ are neither contained nor\npointed to.  But that amounts to a need for seasoning\
    \ -- the meal is\nthere, and it's neither a glutton's portion nor a starvation\
    \ diet.\nLet's work with what we've got instead of charging around demanding MORE\n\
    or sulking around bemoaning the (false) fact that the cupboard is bare.\nPlacing\
    \ the right amount of reliance on the Resource Notebook, then,\nought to lead\
    \ to a solution of the information problem.  In its current\nform, it would have\
    \ solved the U.C.S.B. people's problems fairly\ncompletely, for it already tells\
    \ them to get in touch with me and it\nalready shows them how to log in.  (Assuming,\
    \ of course, that it wasn't\nthe unstated object of their game to do it all with\
    \ only on-line\ninformation.)  The Resource Notebook could even have solved the\
    \ RML\npeople's problems, for had it been made clear to them that global\nrequests\
    \ for Host information are to be handled through the Notebook\nthey'd have been\
    \ in touch with people who could have explained why their\nrequests were inappropriate.\
    \  And on close decisions, the Resource\nNotebook maintainers would know whom\
    \ to consult with in regard to\nappropriateness of results for new categories,\
    \ I believe.\nThis is not meant to push the Resource Notebook as a panacea.  Clearly\n\
    it needs strengthing in terms of content.  Even more clearly, it needs\nwide dissemination.\
    \  (The planned Network New Users' Packet will show\nhow to get at it on-line\
    \ at the NIC, I'm told.  Even better, perhaps we\nmight want to make it available\
    \ in microfiche.)  Also, this is certainly\nnot meant to suggest that the Notebook\
    \ be viewed as supplanting the\nindividual Hosts' users' manuals, although it\
    \ does seem to be the\npartial repository for documentation to any generic commands\
    \ we manage\nto come up with.  But I also think it's important for the NWG to\n\
    understand and agree on the proper perspective in which to view the\nResource\
    \ Notebook -- and I suggest that that perspective should be as\n\"primary source\
    \ of Host information.\" To view it otherwise would, it\nseems to me, be wasting\
    \ both the investment it already represents, and\nthe opportunity it can represent.\n\
