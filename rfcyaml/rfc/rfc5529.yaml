  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the use of the Camellia block cipher\n
    \  algorithm [1] in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, Counter (CTR)\n   mode,
    and Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode as additional, optional-to-\n   implement
    IKEv2 [2] and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [3]\n   mechanisms to provide
    confidentiality, data origin authentication,\n   and connectionless integrity.\n
    \  Since optimized source code is provided under several open source\n   licenses
    [9], Camellia is also adopted by several open source\n   projects (OpenSSL, FreeBSD,
    Linux, and Firefox Gran Paradiso).\n   The algorithm specification and object
    identifiers are described in\n   [1].\n   The Camellia web site [10] contains
    a wealth of information about\n   Camellia, including detailed specification,
    security analysis,\n   performance figures, reference implementation, optimized\n
    \  implementation, test vectors, and intellectual property information.\n   The
    remainder of this document specifies the use of various modes of\n   operation
    for Camellia within the context of IPsec ESP.  For further\n   information on
    how the various pieces of IPsec in general and ESP in\n   particular fit together
    to provide security services, please refer to\n   [11] and [3].\n"

  - "2.  The Camellia Cipher Algorithm\n   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share
    common characteristics\n   and variables, including mode, key size, weak keys,
    block size, and\n   rounds.  The relevant characteristics of Camellia are described
    in\n   [1].\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Block Size and Padding\n   Camellia uses a block size of 16 octets (128
      bits).\n   Padding requirements are described:\n   (a)  Camellia Padding requirement
      is specified in [3],\n   (b)  Camellia-CBC Padding requirement is specified
      in [3],\n   (c)  Camellia-CCM Padding requirement is specified in [5], and\n

      associated\n   Camellia key.  The keying material is used as follows:\n   Camellia-CBC
      with a 128-bit key\n      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CBC key is
      16 octets.  All\n      16 octets are the 128-bit Camellia key.\n   Camellia-CBC
      with a 192-bit key\n      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CBC key is
      24 octets.  All\n      24 octets are the 192-bit Camellia key.\n   Camellia-CBC

      32 octets.  All\n      32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia key.\n   Camellia-CTR
      with a 128-bit key\n      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CTR key is
      20 octets.  The\n      first 16 octets are the 128-bit Camellia key, and the
      remaining\n      four octets are used as the nonce value in the counter block.\n
      \  Camellia-CTR with a 192-bit key\n      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CTR
      key is 28 octets.  The\n      first 24 octets are the 192-bit Camellia key,
      and the remaining\n      four octets are used as the nonce value in the counter
      block.\n   Camellia-CTR with a 256-bit key\n      The KEYMAT requested for each
      Camellia-CTR key is 36 octets.  The\n      first 32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia
      key, and the remaining\n      four octets are used as the nonce value in the
      counter block.\n   Camellia-CCM with a 128-bit key\n      The KEYMAT requested
      for each Camellia-CCM key is 19 octets.  The\n      first 16 octets are the
      128-bit Camellia key, and the remaining\n      three octets are used as the
      salt value in the counter block.\n   Camellia-CCM with a 192-bit key\n      The
      KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CCM key is 27 octets.  The\n      first 24
      octets are the 192-bit Camellia key, and the remaining\n      three octets are
      used as the salt value in the counter block.\n   Camellia-CCM with a 256-bit
      key\n      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CCM key is 35 octets.  The\n
      \     first 32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia key, and the remaining\n      three
      octets are used as the salt value in the counter block.\n"
