  - "                           TENEX FTP PROBLEM\n   Tenex users of FTP should beware\
    \ of a problem in the current Tenex\n   implementation which is likely to cause\
    \ incorrect results when\n   transferring files to a non-Tenex site.  Some Tenex\
    \ programs create\n   an ASCII US (Unit Separator) character as an end-of-line\
    \ indicator,\n   instead of CR LF.  The current Tenex FTP user implementation\
    \ passes\n   these US characters over the Network instead of translating them\
    \ to\n   CR LF as required by FTP protocol.  If the recipient is not a Tenex,\n\
    \   he will not do anything special with these US characters and the line\n  \
    \ spacing will be lost. In the case of sending to CCN, we will treat it\n   as\
    \ a very long logical record and fold it into successive 360\n   records.\n  \
    \ A circumvention is to pass the Tenex file through some Tenex program\n   that\
    \ does the necessary conversion before sending it over the\n   Network.  We know\
    \ that TECO will remove US's; there are probably\n   other means.  Loading and\
    \ saving the file with TECO will replace all\n   US's with CR LF sequences.\n\
