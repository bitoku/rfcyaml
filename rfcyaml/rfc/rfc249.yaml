  - "              Coordination of Equipment and Supplies Purchase\n        The purpose\
    \ of this message is to pass on to all members of the\n   Network an agreement\
    \ reached between Messrs. Steve Crocker of ARPA and\n   R. F. Borelli of the University\
    \ of Illinois.  The Center for Advanced\n   Computation has agreed to study the\
    \ feasibility of a coordinating point\n   for purchases of equipment and supplies\
    \ to be used on the network.\n        To this end, the Center will compile a list\
    \ of common equipment and\n   supplies needed by Network members and ascertain\
    \ the value of contacting\n   the appropriate manufacturers and distributers in\
    \ order to negotiate the\n   best possible group price.  Thereafter, the results\
    \ of the negotiations\n   will be passed on to Network members with a resulting\
    \ listing of items,\n   costs and supplies.\n        The two biggest pitfalls\
    \ with this concept are:\n             1.  Insufficient demand for commonly required\
    \ items.\n             2.  Not satisfying each organization's administrative\n\
    \                 requirements for competitive bidding on items\n            \
    \     which are not sole-source justified.\n        At this time, it appears to\
    \ be premature to allow this to stop the\n   idea.  After the listing of items\
    \ and range of sources are collected and\n   analyzed, these two points can be\
    \ addressed.  In fact, this project may\n   have to be abandoned; however, there\
    \ are sufficient reasons to believe\n   that these problems can be overcome to\
    \ make the venture workable.\n       We request that all members of the Network\
    \ forward to the Center,\n   ATTN. R. F. Borelli, a descriptive listing of equipment\
    \ and supplies\n   they require in this fiscal year.  Particular attention must\
    \ be paid to\n   listing all the acceptable alternates to increase the changes\
    \ of\n   commonality.  For example: TI-725 terminals could be considered a\n \
    \  substitute for Teleterms 1030's, etc.  The only items excluded at this\n  \
    \ time are 2400 ft. Magnetic Computer Tapes, tabulating cards, and\n   conventional\
    \ computer printer paper.  Any added suggestions or ideas are\n   both encouraged\
    \ and welcomed.\n        A sample format of information is attached.\n       \
