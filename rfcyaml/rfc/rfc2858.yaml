  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Currently BGP-4 [BGP-4] is capable of carrying routing information\n\
    \   only for IPv4 [IPv4]. This document defines extensions to BGP-4 to\n   enable\
    \ it to carry routing information for multiple Network Layer\n   protocols (e.g.,\
    \ IPv6, IPX, etc...). The extensions are backward\n   compatible - a router that\
    \ supports the extensions can interoperate\n   with a router that doesn't support\
    \ the extensions.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2283.\n"
- title: 1. Overview
  contents:
  - "1. Overview\n   The only three pieces of information carried by BGP-4 that are\
    \ IPv4\n   specific are (a) the NEXT_HOP attribute (expressed as an IPv4\n   address),\
    \ (b) AGGREGATOR (contains an IPv4 address), and (c) NLRI\n   (expressed as IPv4\
    \ address prefixes). This document assumes that any\n   BGP speaker (including\
    \ the one that supports multiprotocol\n   capabilities defined in this document)\
    \ has to have an IPv4 address\n   (which will be used, among other things, in\
    \ the AGGREGATOR\n   attribute). Therefore, to enable BGP-4 to support routing\
    \ for\n   multiple Network Layer protocols the only two things that have to be\n\
    \   added to BGP-4 are (a) the ability to associate a particular Network\n   Layer\
    \ protocol with the next hop information, and (b) the ability to\n   associated\
    \ a particular Network Layer protocol with NLRI. To identify\n   individual Network\
    \ Layer protocols this document uses Address Family,\n   as defined in [RFC1700].\n\
    \   One could further observe that the next hop information (the\n   information\
    \ provided by the NEXT_HOP attribute) is meaningful (and\n   necessary) only in\
    \ conjunction with the advertisements of reachable\n   destinations - in conjunction\
    \ with the advertisements of unreachable\n   destinations (withdrawing routes\
    \ from service) the next hop\n   information is meaningless. This suggests that\
    \ the advertisement of\n   reachable destinations should be grouped with the advertisement\
    \ of\n   the next hop to be used for these destinations, and that the\n   advertisement\
    \ of reachable destinations should be segregated from the\n   advertisement of\
    \ unreachable destinations.\n   To provide backward compatibility, as well as\
    \ to simplify\n   introduction of the multiprotocol capabilities into BGP-4 this\n\
    \   document uses two new attributes, Multiprotocol Reachable NLRI\n   (MP_REACH_NLRI),\
    \ and Multiprotocol Unreachable NLRI\n   (MP_UNREACH_NLRI). The first one (MP_REACH_NLRI)\
    \ is used to carry the\n   set of reachable destinations together with the next\
    \ hop information\n   to be used for forwarding to these destinations. The second\
    \ one\n   (MP_UNREACH_NLRI) is used to carry the set of unreachable\n   destinations.\
    \  Both of these attributes are optional and non-\n   transitive.  This way a\
    \ BGP speaker that doesn't support the\n   multiprotocol capabilities will just\
    \ ignore the information carried\n   in these attributes, and will not pass it\
    \ to other BGP speakers.\n"

    \ to advertise the Network Layer address of\n          the router that should\
    \ be used as the next hop to the\n          destinations listed in the Network\

    \         associated with the Network Address that follows. Presently\n      \
    \   defined values for this field are specified in RFC 1700 (see\n         the\

    \ length field that contains the Network Address of\n         the next router\
    \ on the path to the destination system\n      Number of SNPAs:\n         A 1\
    \ octet field which contains the number of distinct SNPAs to\n         be listed\
    \ in the following fields.  The value 0 may be used to\n         indicate that\
    \ no SNPAs are listed in this attribute.\n      Length of Nth SNPA:\n        \
    \ A 1 octet field whose value expresses the length of the \"Nth\n         SNPA\
    \ of Next Hop\" field as measured in semi-octets\n      Nth SNPA of Next Hop:\n\
    \         A variable length field that contains an SNPA of the router\n      \
    \   whose Network Address is contained in the \"Network Address of\n         Next\
    \ Hop\" field.  The field length is an integral number of\n         octets in\
    \ length, namely the rounded-up integer value of one\n         half the SNPA length\
    \ expressed in semi-octets; if the SNPA\n         contains an odd number of semi-octets,\
    \ a value in this field\n         will be padded with a trailing all-zero semi-octet.\n\
    \      Network Layer Reachability Information:\n         A variable length field\
    \ that lists NLRI for the feasible routes\n         that are being advertised\
    \ in this attribute. When the\n         Subsequent Address Family Identifier field\
    \ is set to one of the\n         values defined in this document, each NLRI is\
    \ encoded as\n         specified in the \"NLRI encoding\" section of this document.\n\
    \   The next hop information carried in the MP_REACH_NLRI path attribute\n   defines\
    \ the Network Layer address of the border router that should be\n   used as the\
    \ next hop to the destinations listed in the MP_NLRI\n   attribute in the UPDATE\
    \ message.  When advertising a MP_REACH_NLRI\n   attribute to an external peer,\
    \ a router may use one of its own\n   interface addresses in the next hop component\
    \ of the attribute,\n   provided the external peer to which the route is being\
    \ advertised\n   shares a common subnet with the next hop address.  This is known\
    \ as a\n   \"first party\" next hop.  A BGP speaker can advertise to an external\n\
    \   peer an interface of any internal peer router in the next hop\n   component,\
    \ provided the external peer to which the route is being\n   advertised shares\
    \ a common subnet with the next hop address.  This is\n   known as a \"third party\"\
    \ next hop information.  A BGP speaker can\n   advertise any external peer router\
    \ in the next hop component,\n   provided that the Network Layer address of this\
    \ border router was\n   learned from an external peer, and the external peer to\
    \ which the\n   route is being advertised shares a common subnet with the next\
    \ hop\n   address.  This is a second form of \"third party\" next hop\n   information.\n\
    \   Normally the next hop information is chosen such that the shortest\n   available\
    \ path will be taken.  A BGP speaker must be able to support\n   disabling advertisement\
    \ of third party next hop information to handle\n   imperfectly bridged media\
    \ or for reasons of policy.\n   A BGP speaker must never advertise an address\
    \ of a peer to that peer\n   as a next hop, for a route that the speaker is originating.\
    \  A BGP\n   speaker must never install a route with itself as the next hop.\n\
    \   When a BGP speaker advertises the route to an internal peer, the\n   advertising\
    \ speaker should not modify the next hop information\n   associated with the route.\
    \  When a BGP speaker receives the route via\n   an internal link, it may forward\
    \ packets to the next hop address if\n   the address contained in the attribute\
    \ is on a common subnet with the\n   local and remote BGP speakers.\n   An UPDATE\
    \ message that carries the MP_REACH_NLRI must also carry the\n   ORIGIN and the\
    \ AS_PATH attributes (both in EBGP and in IBGP\n   exchanges).  Moreover, in IBGP\
    \ exchanges such a message must also\n   carry the LOCAL_PREF attribute. If such\
    \ a message is received from an\n   external peer, the local system shall check\
    \ whether the leftmost AS\n   in the AS_PATH attribute is equal to the autonomous\
    \ system number of\n   the peer than sent the message. If that is not the case,\
    \ the local\n   system shall send the NOTIFICATION message with Error Code UPDATE\n\
    \   Message Error, and the Error Subcode set to Malformed AS_PATH.\n   An UPDATE\
    \ message that carries no NLRI, other than the one encoded in\n   the MP_REACH_NLRI\
    \ attribute, should not carry the NEXT_HOP attribute.\n   If such a message contains\
    \ the NEXT_HOP attribute, the BGP speaker\n   that receives the message should\
    \ ignore this attribute.\n"
