    \  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   (The
    convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols [5] is to\n   express numbers
    in decimal.  Numbers in hexadecimal format are\n   specified by prefacing them
    with the characters \"0x\".  Numbers in\n   binary format are specified by prefacing
    them with the characters\n   \"0b\".  Data is pictured in \"big-endian\" order.
    \ That is, fields are\n   described left to right, with the most significant byte
    on the left\n   and the least significant byte on the right.  Whenever a diagram\n
    \  shows a group of bytes, the order of transmission of those bytes is\n   the
    normal order in which they are read in English.  Whenever a byte\n   represents
    a numeric quantity the left most bit in the diagram is the\n   high order or most
    significant bit.  That is, the bit labelled 0 is\n   the most significant bit.
    \ Similarly, whenever a multi-byte field\n   represents a numeric quantity the
    left most bit of the whole field is\n   the most significant bit.  When a multi-byte
    quantity is transmitted,\n   the most significant byte is transmitted first.  This
    is the same\n   coding convention as is used in the ATM layer [2] and AAL-5 [3][4].)\n
    \  The LLC/SNAP header contains the bytes: 0xAA 0xAA 0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00\n   0x88
    0x0C.  (0x880C is the assigned Ethertype for GSMP.)\n   The maximum transmission
    unit (MTU) of the GSMP Message field is 1492\n   bytes.\n   The virtual channel
    over which a GSMP session is established between\n   a controller and the switch
    it is controlling is called the GSMP\n   control channel.  The default VPI and
    VCI of the GSMP control channel\n   for LLC/SNAP encapsulated GSMP messages on
    an ATM data link layer is:\n      VPI = 0\n      VCI = 15.\n   The GSMP control

    \  Destination Address\n      For the SYN message of the adjacency protocol the

    MAC address of the destination.  In this case the configured\n      unicast Destination
    Address is used in the SYN message.)  For all\n      other messages the Destination
    Address is the unicast 48-bit\n      IEEE.  MAC address of the destination.  This
    address may be\n      discovered from the Source Address field of messages received\n
    \     during synchronisation of the adjacency protocol.\n   Source Address\n      For
    all messages, the Source Address is the 48-bit IEEE MAC\n      address of the
    sender.\n   Ethertype\n      The assigned Ethertype for GSMP is 0x880C.\n   GSMP
    Message\n      The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the GSMP Message field is\n

    link obtained from the\n      adjacency protocol.  This field is already present
    in the\n      adjacency protocol message.  It is appended to all non-adjacency\n
    \     GSMP messages in the Ethernet encapsulation to offer additional\n      protection
    against the introduction of corrupt state.\n   Receiver Instance\n      The Receiver
    Instance number is what the sender believes is the\n      current instance number
    for the link, allocated by the entity at\n      the far end of the link.  This
    field is already present in the\n      adjacency protocol message.  It is appended
    to all non-adjacency\n      GSMP messages in the Ethernet encapsulation to offer
    additional\n      protection against the introduction of corrupt state.\n   Pad\n
    \     After adjacency has been established the minimum length of the\n      data
    field of an Ethernet packet is 46 bytes.  If necessary,\n      padding should
    be added such that it meets the minimum Ethernet\n      frame size.  This padding
    should be bytes of zero and is not to be\n      considered part of the GSMP message.\n
    \  Frame Check Sequence\n      The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is defined in IEEE
    802.3 [6] as\n      follows:\n         Note: This section is included for informational
    and historical\n         purposes only.  The normative reference can be found
    in IEEE\n         802.3 Standard [6].\n          \"A cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
    is used by the transmit and\n         receive algorithms to generate a CRC value
    for the FCS field.\n         The frame check sequence (FCS) field contains a 4-byte
    (32-bit)\n         cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value.  This value is computed
    as\n         a function of the contents of the source address, destination\n         address,
    length, LLC data and pad (that is, all fields except\n         the preamble, SFD,
    FCS and extension).  The encoding is defined\n         by the following generating
    polynomial.\n         G(x)=x^32+x^26+x^23+x^22+x^16+x^12+x^11+x^10+x^8+x^\n         7+x^5+x^4+x^2+x^1.\"\n
    \        The procedure for the CRC calculation can be found in [6].\n   After
    the adjacency protocol has achieved synchronisation, for every\n   GSMP message
    received with an Ethernet encapsulation, the receiver\n   must check the Source
    Address from the Ethernet MAC header, the\n   Sender Instance, and the Receiver
    Instance.  The incoming GSMP\n   message must be discarded if the Sender Instance
    and the Source\n   Address do not match the values of the Sender Instance and
    the Sender\n   Name stored by the \"Update Peer Verifier\" operation of the GSMP\n
    \  adjacency protocol.  The incoming GSMP message must also be discarded\n   if
    it arrives over any port other than the port over which the\n   adjacency protocol
    has achieved synchronisation.  In addition, the\n   incoming message must also
    be discarded if the Receiver Instance\n   field does not match the current value
    for the Sender Instance of the\n   GSMP adjacency protocol.\n"

  - "4. TCP/IP Encapsulation\n   When GSMP messages are transported over an IP network,
    they MUST be\n   transported using the TCP encapsulation.  TCP provides reliable\n
    \  transport, network flow control, and end-system flow control suitable\n   for
    networks that may have high loss and variable or unpredictable\n   delay.\n   For
    TCP encapsulations of GSMP messages, the controller runs the\n   client code and
    the switch runs the server code.  Upon\n   initialisation, the server is listening
    on GSMP's TCP port number:\n   6068.  The controller establishes a TCP connection
    with each switch\n   it manages.  The switch under control MUST be a multi-connection\n
    \  server (PORT 6068) to allow creation of multiple control sessions\n   from
    N GSMP controller instances.  Adjacency protocol messages, which\n   are used
    to synchronise the controller and switch and maintain\n   handshakes, are sent
    by the controller to the switch after the TCP\n   connection is established.  GSMP
    messages other than adjacency\n   protocol messages MUST NOT be sent until after
    the adjacency protocol\n   has achieved synchronisation.  The actual GSMP message
    flow will\n   occur on other ports.\n"
