    \   communication frame formats and parameters [IEEE802].  These include\n   MAC\
    \ (Media Access Control) identifiers and protocol identifiers.\n   This document\
    \ specifies IANA considerations for the assignment of\n   code points under the\
    \ IANA OUI.  It also discusses several other uses\n   by the IETF of IEEE 802\
    \ code points and provides some values for use\n   in documentation.  As noted\
    \ in [RFC2606] and [RFC5737], the use of\n   designated code values reserved for\
    \ documentation and examples\n   reduces the likelihood of conflicts and confusion\
    \ arising from their\n   duplication of code points assigned for some deployed\
    \ use.\n   [RFC5226] is incorporated herein except where there are contrary\n\
    \   provisions in this document.  In this document, \"IESG Ratification\"\n  \

- title: 2.1.  48-Bit MAC Identifiers, OUIs, and Other Prefixes
  contents:
  - "2.1.  48-Bit MAC Identifiers, OUIs, and Other Prefixes\n   48-bit MAC \"addresses\"\
    \ are the most commonly used Ethernet interface\n   identifiers.  Those that are\
    \ globally unique are also called EUI-48\n   identifiers.  An EUI-48 is structured\
    \ into an initial 3-octet OUI\n   (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and an\
    \ additional 3 octets\n   assigned by the OUI holder or into a larger initial\
    \ prefix assigned\n   to an organization and a shorter sequence of additional\
    \ bits so as to\n   add up to 48 bits in total.  For example, the IEEE has assigned\
    \ IABs\n   (Individual Address Blocks), where the first 4 1/2 octets (36 bits)\n\
    \   are assigned, giving the holder of the IAB 1 1/2 octets (12 bits)\n   they\
    \ can control; however, IABs will become historic, and a wider\n   range of prefix\
    \ lengths will be made available [RAC-OUI].\n   The IEEE describes its assignment\
    \ procedures and policies for IEEE\n   802-related identifiers in [802_O&A], which\
    \ is being revised.\n   Two bits within the initial octet of an EUI-48 have special\n\
    \   significance in MAC addresses: the Group bit (01) and the Local bit\n   (02).\
    \  OUIs and longer MAC prefixes are assigned with the Local bit\n   zero and the\
    \ Group bit unspecified.  Multicast identifiers may be\n   constructed by turning\
    \ on the Group bit, and unicast identifiers may\n   be constructed by leaving\
    \ the Group bit zero.\n   The Local bit is zero for globally unique EUI-48 identifiers\
    \ assigned\n   by the owner of an OUI or owner of a longer prefix.  If the Local\
    \ bit\n   is a one, the identifier has been considered by IEEE 802 to be a\n \
    \  local identifier under the control of the local network\n   administrator;\
    \ however, there may be emerging recommendations from\n   the IEEE Registration\
    \ Authority on management of the local address\n   space.  If the Local bit is\
    \ on, the holder of an OUI has no special\n   authority over MAC identifiers whose\
    \ first 3 octets correspond to\n   their OUI.\n   An AFN and a DNS RRTYPE have\
    \ been assigned for 48-bit MAC addresses\n   (see Section 5.2).\n"

    \ assigned such an\n   identifier can also use the unmodified form as a MAC identifier\
    \ on\n   any link that uses such 64-bit identifiers for interfaces.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  IPv6 Use of Modified EUI-64 Identifiers
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  IPv6 Use of Modified EUI-64 Identifiers\n   MAC-64 identifiers are used\
    \ to form the lower 64 bits of some IPv6\n   addresses (Section 2.5.1 and Appendix\
    \ A of [RFC4291] and Appendix A\n   of [RFC5214]).  When so used, the MAC-64 is\
    \ modified by inverting the\n   Local/Global bit to form an IETF \"Modified EUI-64\
    \ identifier\".  Below\n   is an illustration of a Modified EUI-64 unicast identifier\
    \ under the\n   IANA OUI, where aa-bb-cc-dd-ee is the extension.\n      02-00-5E-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee\n\
    \   The first octet is shown as 02 rather than 00 because, in Modified\n   EUI-64\
    \ identifiers, the sense of the Local/Global bit is inverted\n   compared with\
    \ EUI-48 identifiers.  It is the globally unique values\n   (universal scope)\
    \ that have the 02 bit on in the first octet, while\n   those with this bit off\
    \ are locally assigned and out of scope for\n   global assignment.\n   The Local/Global\
    \ bit was inverted to make it easier for network\n   operators to type in local-scope\
    \ identifiers.  Thus, such Modified\n   EUI-64 identifiers as 1, 2, etc. (ignoring\
    \ leading zeros) are local.\n   Without the modification, they would have to be\n\
    \   02-00-00-00-00-00-00-01, 02-00-00-00-00-00-00-02, etc. to be local.\n   As\
    \ with MAC-48 identifiers, the 01 bit on in the first octet\n   indicates a group\
    \ identifier.\n   When the first two octets of the extension of a Modified EUI-64\n\
    \   identifier are FF-FE, the remainder of the extension is a 24-bit\n   value\
    \ as assigned by the OUI owner for an EUI-48.  For example:\n      02-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy\n\
    \   or\n      03-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy\n   where yy-yy-yy is the portion (of an\
    \ EUI-48 global unicast or\n   multicast identifier) that is assigned by the OUI\
    \ owner (IANA in this\n   case).  Thus, any holder of one or more EUI-48 identifiers\
    \ under the\n   IANA OUI also has an equal number of Modified EUI-64 identifiers\
    \ that\n   can be formed by inserting FF-FE in the middle of their EUI-48\n  \
    \ identifiers and inverting the Local/Global bit.\n      (Note: [EUI-64] defines\
    \ FF-FF as the bits to be inserted to create\n      an IEEE EUI-64 identifier\
    \ from a MAC-48 identifier.  That document\n      says the FF-FE value is used\
    \ when starting with an EUI-48\n      identifier.  The IETF uses only FF-FE to\
    \ create Modified EUI-64\n      identifiers from 48-bit Ethernet station identifiers\
    \ regardless of\n      whether they are EUI-48 or MAC-48 local identifiers.  EUI-48\
    \ and\n      local MAC-48 identifiers are syntactically equivalent, and this\n\
    \      doesn't cause any problems in practice.)\n   In addition, certain Modified\
    \ EUI-64 identifiers under the IANA OUI\n   are reserved for holders of IPv4 addresses\
    \ as follows:\n      02-00-5E-FE-xx-xx-xx-xx\n   where xx-xx-xx-xx is a 32-bit\
    \ IPv4 address.  The owner of an IPv4\n   address has both the unicast- and multicast-derived\
    \ EUI-64 address.\n   Modified EUI-64 identifiers from\n      02-00-5E-FE-F0-00-00-00\
    \ to 02-00-5E-FE-FF-FF-FF-FF\n   are effectively reserved pending the specification\
    \ of IPv4 Class E\n   addresses.  However, for Modified EUI-64 identifiers based\

- title: 3.  Ethernet Protocol Parameters
  contents:
  - "3.  Ethernet Protocol Parameters\n   Ethernet protocol parameters provide a means\
    \ of indicating the\n   contents of a frame -- for example, that its contents\
    \ are IPv4 or\n   IPv6.\n   The concept has been extended to labeling by \"tags\"\
    .  A tag in this\n   sense is a prefix whose type is identified by an Ethertype\
    \ that is\n   then followed by either another tag, an Ethertype, or an LSAP (Link-\n\
    \   Layer Service Access Point) protocol indicator for the \"main\" body of\n\
    \   the frame, as described below.  Traditionally, in the [802_O&A]\n   world,\
    \ tags are a fixed length and do not include any encoding of\n   their own length.\
    \  Any device that is processing a frame cannot, in\n   general, safely process\
    \ anything in the frame past an Ethertype it\n   does not understand.  An example\
    \ is the C-Tag (formerly the Q-Tag)\n   [802.1Q].  It provides customer VLAN and\
    \ priority information for a\n   frame.\n   There are two types of protocol identifier\
    \ parameters that can occur\n   in Ethernet frames after the initial MAC-48 destination\
    \ and source\n   identifiers:\n      Ethertypes: These are 16-bit identifiers\
    \ appearing as the initial\n         two octets after the MAC destination and\
    \ source (or after a\n         tag), which, when considered as an unsigned integer,\
    \ are equal\n         to or larger than 0x0600.\n      LSAPs: These are 8-bit\
    \ protocol identifiers that occur in pairs\n         immediately after an initial\
    \ 16-bit (two-octet) remaining frame\n         length, which is in turn after\
    \ the MAC destination and source\n         (or after a tag).  Such a length must,\
    \ when considered as an\n         unsigned integer, be less than 0x5DC, or it\
    \ could be mistaken\n         as an Ethertype.  LSAPs occur in pairs where one\
    \ is intended to\n         indicate the source protocol handler and one the destination\n\
    \         protocol handler; however, use cases where the two are\n         different\
    \ have been relatively rare.\n   Neither Ethertypes nor LSAPs are assigned by\
    \ IANA; they are assigned\n   by the IEEE Registration Authority (see Section\
    \ 1.3 above and\n   Appendix B).  However, both LSAPs and Ethertypes have extension\n\
    \   mechanisms so that they can be used with five-octet Ethernet protocol\n  \
    \ identifiers under an OUI, including those assigned by IANA under the\n   IANA\
    \ OUI.\n   When using the IEEE 802 Logical Link Control (LLC) format (Subnetwork\n\
    \   Access Protocol (SNAP)) [802_O&A] for a frame, an OUI-based protocol\n   identifier\
    \ can be expressed as follows:\n      xx-xx-AA-AA-03-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz\n   where\
    \ xx-xx is the frame length and, as above, must be small enough\n   not to be\
    \ confused with an Ethertype; \"AA\" is the LSAP that indicates\n   this use and\
    \ is sometimes referred to as the SNAP Service Access\n   Point (SAP); \"03\"\
    \ is the LLC control octet indicating datagram\n   service; yy-yy-yy is an OUI;\
    \ and zz-zz is a protocol number, under\n   that OUI, assigned by the OUI owner.\
    \  The odd five-octet length for\n   such OUI-based protocol identifiers was chosen\
    \ so that, with the LLC\n   control octet (\"03\"), the result is 16-bit aligned.\n\
    \   When using an Ethertype to indicate the main type for a frame body,\n   the\
    \ special \"OUI Extended Ethertype\" 88-B7 is available.  Using this\n   Ethertype,\
    \ a frame body can begin with\n      88-B7-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz\n   where yy-yy-yy and\
    \ zz-zz have the same meaning as in the SNAP format\n   described above.\n   It\
    \ is also possible, within the SNAP format, to use an arbitrary\n   Ethertype.\
    \  Putting the Ethertype as the zz-zz field after an all-\n   zeros OUI (00-00-00)\
    \ does this.  It looks like\n      xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-00-zz-zz\n   where zz-zz\
    \ is the Ethertype.\n      (Note that, at this point, the 802 protocol syntax\
    \ facilities are\n      sufficiently powerful that they could be chained indefinitely.\n\
    \      Whether support for such chaining is generally required is not\n      clear,\
    \ but [802_O&A] requires support for\n         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-00-88-B7-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz\n\
    \      although this could be more efficiently expressed by simply\n      pinching\
    \ out the \"00-00-00-88-B7\" in the middle.)\n   As well as labeling frame contents,\
    \ 802 protocol types appear within\n   NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) Next\
    \ Hop Resolution Protocol\n   [RFC2332] messages.  Such messages have provisions\
    \ for both two-octet\n   Ethertypes and OUI-based protocol types.\n"

    \ OUI-based identifiers.\n   The Expert(s) referred to in this document shall\
    \ consist of one or\n   more persons appointed by and serving at the pleasure\
    \ of the IESG.\n   The procedure described for Expert Review assignments in this\n\
    \   document is fully consistent with the IANA Expert Review policy\n   described\
    \ in [RFC5226].\n   While finite, the universe of code points from which Expert-judged\n\
    \   assignments will be made is felt to be large enough that the\n   requirements\
    \ given in this document and the Experts' good judgment\n   are sufficient guidance.\
    \  The idea is for the Expert to provide a\n   light sanity check for small assignments\
    \ of EUI identifiers, with\n   increased scrutiny by the Expert for medium-sized\
    \ assignments of EUI\n   identifiers and assignments of protocol identifiers and\
    \ other IANA\n   OUI-based parameters.  However, it can make sense to assign very\n\
    \   large portions of the MAC identifier code point space.  (Note that\n   existing\
    \ assignments include one for 1/2 of the entire multicast IANA\n   EUI-48 code\
    \ point space and one for 1/16 of that multicast code point\n   space.)  In those\
    \ cases, and in cases of the assignment of \"reserved\"\n   values, IESG Ratification\
    \ of an Expert Review approval recommendation\n   is required as described below.\
    \  The procedure is as follows:\n      The applicant always completes the appropriate\
    \ template from\n         Appendix A below and sends it to IANA <iana@iana.org>.\n\
    \      IANA always sends the template to an appointed Expert.  If the\n      \

    \ an alternative appointed Expert or, if none is available, will\n         contact\
    \ the IESG.\n      In all cases, if IANA receives a disapproval from an Expert\n\
    \         selected to review an application template, the application\n      \
    \   will be denied.\n      If the assignment is based on Expert Review:\n    \
    \        If IANA receives approval and code points are available,\n          \
    \  IANA will make the requested assignment.\n      If the assignment is based\
    \ on IESG Ratification:\n            The procedure starts with the first steps\
    \ above for Expert\n            Review.  If the Expert disapproves the application,\
    \ they\n            simply inform IANA; however, if the Expert believes the\n\
    \            application should be approved, or is uncertain and believes\n  \
    \          that the circumstances warrant the attention of the IESG,\n       \
    \     the Expert will inform IANA about their advice, and IANA\n            will\
    \ forward the application, together with the reasons for\n            approval\
