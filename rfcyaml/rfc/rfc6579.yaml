- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined a way of indicating relationships\
    \ between\n   resources on the Web.  This document specifies the 'disclosure'\
    \ link\n   relation type.  It designates a list of IPR disclosures made with\n\
    \   respect to the material for which such a relation type is specified.\n   Please\
    \ note that the term \"patent disclosure\" should be considered\n   synonymous\
    \ with \"IPR disclosure\" for the purposes of 'disclosure'\n   link relation type\
    \ semantics, as patent disclosures are a subset of\n   IPR disclosures.\n   The\
    \ W3C already mandates the use of the 'disclosure' link relation\n   type for\
    \ links to patent disclosures in all its documents.  However,\n   it has long\
    \ been used with no proper specification and registration.\n   This document is\
    \ to fill this gap and encourage wider use of the\n   'disclosure' relation type.\
    \  It formally specifies the existing\n   practice of use of the link relation\
    \ type and registers it in the\n   registry created by RFC 5988.\n   Please note\
    \ that the 'disclosure' relation type designates a\n   different resource than\
    \ the 'copyright' type does; the latter refers\n   to the copyright statement\
    \ while the former is used to reference a\n   list of patent disclosures.  Please\
    \ see RFC 5988 [RFC5988] for more\n   information on the 'copyright' relation\
    \ type.\n"

    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  'disclosure' Link Relation Type
  contents:
  - "2.  'disclosure' Link Relation Type\n   Whenever the 'disclosure' relation type\
    \ is used, the resource at the\n   target Internationalized Resource Identifier\
    \ (IRI) [RFC5988] MUST\n   represent a list of patent disclosures made with respect\
    \ to the\n   material referenced by context IRI.  This also covers the case of\
    \ an\n   empty list and a list containing one entry.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Examples
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Examples\n   This section provides an example of possible use of the 'disclosure'\n\
    \   relation type.\n   If the page <http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/> contains\
    \ a list of\n   patent disclosures made with respect to the specification found\
    \ at\n   <http://example.org/specs/meta-spec/spec.html>, the latter would have\n\
    \   the following fragment of HTML source code:\n   <html>\n     ...\n     Please\
    \ visit\n     <a rel=\"disclosure\" href=\"http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/\"\
    >\n     the IPR page</a> for the list of patent disclosures made with\n     respect\
    \ to this specification.\n     ...\n   </html>\n   In the case of Link header\
    \ field, the HTTP response would contain the\n   following header field:\n   \
    \   Link: <http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/>; rel=\"disclosure\";\n         \
    \   title=\"Patent Disclosures List\"\n   (Please note that the actual header\
    \ field will not contain the line\n   break and spaces after the 'rel' parameter.)\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The 'disclosure' relation type is truly believed\
    \ not to raise any new\n   security issues that are not discussed in RFC 5988\
    \ for generic use of\n   the Web linking mechanism.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the 'disclosure' link relation\
    \ type in the \"Link\n   Relations\" registry, with a reference to this document,\
    \ using the\n   following template:\n   o  Relation name: disclosure\n   o  Description:\
    \ Refers to a list of patent disclosures made with\n      respect to material\
    \ for which 'disclosure' relation is specified.\n   o Reference: RFC 6579\n"
