Abstract When the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group was chartered, an object identifier arc was donated by RSA Data Security for use by that working group.
This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that donated arc, transfers control of that arc to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that arc.
When the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group was chartered, an object identifier arc was donated by RSA Data Security for use by that working group.
These object identifiers are primarily used with Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
The ASN.1 specifications continue to evolve, but object identifiers can be used with any and all versions of ASN.1.
The S/MIME object identifier arc is: id
16 } This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that donated arc, transfers control of that arc to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that arc.
Thirteen subordinate object identifier arcs were used, numbered from zero to twelve.
They were assigned as follows:
{ id smime  0 }
test security policies id tsp
symmetric key distribution control attributes i
The values assigned in each of these subordinate object identifier arcs are discussed in the next section.
IANA Considerations IANA is asked to update one registry table and create fourteen additional tables.
Updates to the new tables require both Specification Required and Expert Review as defined in [RFC5226].
The expert is expected to ensure that any new values are strongly related to the work that was done by the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group; examples include content types, attributes, and identifiers for algorithms used with S/MIME and CMS.
Object identifiers for other purposes should not be assigned in this arc.
Update to "SMI Security for Mechanism Codes" Registry
The "SMI Security for Mechanism Codes" table generally contains entries with a positive integer value, but the value donated by RSA Data Security cannot be described in this manner.
An accompanying table is needed with this entry:
