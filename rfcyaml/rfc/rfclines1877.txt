Abstract The Point to Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for transporting multi protocol datagrams over point to point links.
PPP defines an extensible Link Control Protocol and a family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different network layer protocols.
This document extends the NCP for establishing and configuring the Internet Protocol over PPP [2], defining the negotiation of primary and secondary Domain Name System (DNS) [3] and NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS)
The four name server address configuration options, 129 to 132, provide a method of obtaining the addresses of Domain Name System (DNS) servers and (NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS) nodes on the remote network.
Primary and secondary addresses are negotiated independently.
They serve identical purposes, except that when both are present an attempt SHOULD be made to resolve names using the primary address before using the secondary address.
For implementational convenience, these options are designed to be identical in format and behavior to option 3 (IP Address) which is already present in most IPCP implementations.
Since the usefulness of name server address information is dependent on the topology of the remote network and local peer's application, it is suggested that these options not be included in the list of "IPCP Recommended Options".
Primary DNS Server Address Description
This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with the remote peer the address of the primary DNS server to be used on the local end of the link.
If local peer requests an invalid server address (which it will typically do intentionally)
the remote peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and returning the IP address of a valid DNS server.
By default, no primary DNS address is provided.
A summary of the Primary DNS Address Configuration Option format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right. 0
The four octet Primary DNS Address is the address of the primary DNS server to be used by the local peer.
If all four octets are set to zero, it indicates an explicit request that the peer provide the address information in a Config Nak packet.
Default No address is provided.
Primary NBNS Server Address Description This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with the remote peer the address of the primary NBNS server to be used on the local end of the link.
If local peer requests an invalid server address (which it will typically do intentionally)
the remote peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and returning the IP address of a valid NBNS server.
By default, no primary NBNS address is provided.
A summary of the Primary NBNS Address Configuration Option format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right. 0
The four octet Primary NBNS Address is the address of the primary NBNS server to be used by the local peer.
If all four octets are set to zero, it indicates an explicit request that the peer provide the address information in a Config Nak packet.
Default No address is provided.
Secondary DNS Server Address Description
This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with the remote peer the address of the secondary DNS server to be used on the local end of the link.
If local peer requests an invalid server address (which it will typically do intentionally)
the remote peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and returning the IP address of a valid DNS server.
By default, no secondary DNS address is provided.
A summary of the Secondary DNS Address Configuration Option format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right. 0
Type 131 Length 6 Secondary DNS Address
The four octet Secondary DNS Address is the address of the primary NBNS server to be used by the local peer.
If all four octets are set to zero, it indicates an explicit request that the peer provide the address information in a Config Nak packet.
Default No address is provided.
Secondary NBNS Server Address Description This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with the remote peer the address of the secondary NBNS server to be used on the local end of the link.
If local peer requests an invalid server address (which it will typically do intentionally)
the remote peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and returning the IP address of a valid NBNS server.
By default, no secondary NBNS address is provided.
A summary of the Secondary NBNS Address Configuration Option format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right. 0

Type 132 Length 6 Secondary NBNS Address
The four octet Secondary NBNS Address is the address of the secondary NBNS server to be used by the local peer.
If all four octets are set to zero, it indicates an explicit request that the peer provide the address information in a Config Nak packet.
Default No address is provided.
