USING NETWORK REMOTE JOB ENTRY OVERVIEW
As has been mentioned in previous RFCs and at previous Network meetings various groups at Rand have been doing RJE to remote Network sites (UCBS and UCLA) for over a year.
Until recently all this work has been done from our IBM 360/65 which is only a Network using host (not a server).
Recently our PDP 10 has come onto the Network as both a user and server host.
We now have, as well, a program on the PDP 10 allowing access to the Remote Job Service (RJS) at UCLA.
Our normal mode of operation is diagramed below.
To use RJS the user creates a job source "deck" in the Rand File system.
He then instructs the RJS Access Program (RJSAP) to send that file (job) to RJS.
He can then monitor the status of his job via RJSAP (and hence RJS) and ask that RJSAP retrieve his print output to a local file, (or directly to his console, the line printer or whatever).
Recently, several people at other Network sites have expressed an interest in using RJS.
However, they are located at a minimal Host or at a host not providing RJS access.
Since the Rand PDP 10 is a Network server, these people can solve their access problem by logging onto the Rand PDP 10, using Telnet, and running the RJSAP themselves.
The remainder of this RFC describe the steps necessary to run that program.
The Rand PDP 10 operates under the Tenex operating system.
Thus, some understanding of the Tenex Executive is required.
The necessary documents can be obtained from the developers of Tenex: Bolt, Beranek and Newman,
Inc. 50 Moulton Street Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138
Secondly, it is necessary to establish an account on the Rand PDP 10.
This can be done through: Rod Fredrickson
The Rand Corporation 1700 Main Street Santa Monica, California 90406 (213) 393 0411
To use the UCLA IBM 360/91 via RJS it is necessary to: 1) have an account at UCLA 2) have an assigned RJS terminal ID.
These can both be obtained from Bob Braden UCLA Math Sciences Building 3531 Boelter Hall Los Angeles, Calif.
The RJS Access Program (RJSAP)
A sample session using RJSAP is attached below.
The RJSAP is started by typing "RJS<return>" to the Tenex executive.
The program will then initialize and check (via your login information) to see if you are a user recorded in its tables.
This is done to assure you have a valid RJS terminal ID.
If your ID is not found, the program will terminate with appropriate message.
If your ID is found, RJSAP will attempt to connect to RJS.
If UCLA is down, a message to that effect will appear and the program will terminate.
If UCLA is up, RJSAP will connect you to RJS and sign on your terminal ID (see RFC 189).
RJSAP will respond "YOU ARE CONNECTED TO RJS."
At this point RJS will acknowledge your signon and print out messages regarding system status.
The programs (RJSAP and RJS) are now ready to perform RJE functions.
All commands are initially interpreted by RJSAP.
They are listed and explained below.
See RFC 189 for the syntax and semantics of these commands.
An operator input message can be cancelled with the RUB OUT key or backspaced using BACKSPACE.
Send a Job When the user types
"S" RJSAP echoes "SEND SOURCE DECK FROM FILE".
The user then enters the file name containing his job followed by a "return."
Obviously the file must already exist.
If the file is ok and is transmitted successfully, both RJSAP and RJS will print an acknowledgement on the user's terminal (see example below).
The user can retrieve printed output by entering "PR".
RJSAP will echo "PRINT OUTPUT TO FILE".
The user then enters the files name where he wants the output.
This can be a new file or even a device such as the printer or teletype.
When the print output is completely received, the RJSAP will print an acknowledgment (see example).
This function is currently not implemented, pending a decision on the use of this channel between a PDP 10 and a 360. 6.
For long transmissions of job input or output it may be desirable to check on the progress of the transmission.
Typing "R" will cause RJSAP to echo "REPORT ON TRANSMISSIONS ", followed by a record count for the job input and printer output channels.
If the user types a "Q" at the start of a command, RJSAP will echo "QUIT IN PROGRESS" and terminate.
This is the preferred way of terminating the program.
Since RJSAP has not been extensively used, we expect it to be improved and modified in the future.
Thus, the last section of this RFC   the explanation of the use of RJSAP   will be kept in file <HARSLEM
RJSACCESSPROGRAM.EXPLANATION on the Rand PDP 10 and be updated appropriately.
The follows is a sample session using RJS from RJSAP on the Rand PDP 10.
