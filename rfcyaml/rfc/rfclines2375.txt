This document defines the initial assignment of IPv6 multicast addresses.
It is based on the "IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture" [ADDARCH] and current IPv4 multicast address assignment found in <ftp://venera.isi.edu/in notes/iana/assignments/multicast addresses
It adapts the IPv4 assignments that are relevant to IPv6 assignments.
IPv4 assignments that were not relevant were not converted into IPv6 assignments.
Comments are solicited on this conversion.
All other IPv6 multicast addresses are reserved.
Sections 2 and 3 specify reserved and preassigned IPv6 multicast addresses.
[ADDRARCH] defines rules for assigning new IPv6 multicast addresses.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].
These permanently assigned multicast addresses are valid over a specified scope value.
2.1 Node Local Scope FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
These permanently assigned multicast addresses are valid over all scope ranges.
This is shown by an "X" in the scope field of the address that means any legal scope value.
Note that, as defined in [ADDARCH], IPv6 multicast addresses which are only different in scope represent different groups.
Nodes must join each group individually.
The IPv6 multicast addresses with variable scope are as follows:

7.0 Security Considerations This document defines the initial assignment of IPv6 multicast addresses.
As such it does not directly impact the security of the Internet infrastructure or its applications.
