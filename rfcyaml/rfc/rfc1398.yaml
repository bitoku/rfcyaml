- title: 1.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      STD 16/RFC 1155\
    \ [3] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n      describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.  STD\n      16/RFC 1212 [13] defines\
    \ a more concise description mechanism,\n      which is wholly consistent with\
    \ the SMI.\n      RFC 1156 [4] which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects\n\
    \      for the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 [6] defines\n   \
    \   MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience\n      and\
    \ new operational requirements.\n      STD 15/RFC 1157 [5] which defines the SNMP,\
    \ the protocol used for\n      network access to managed objects.\n   The Framework\
    \ permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and\
    \ evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.  Objects
  contents:
  - "2.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 4 contains contains the specification\
    \ of all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are\
    \ defined using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in [13].\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface\n\
    \   to an ethernet-like communications medium.  At present, ethernet-like\n  \
    \ media are identified by three values of the ifType object in the\n   Internet-standard\
    \ MIB:\n          ethernet-csmacd(6)\n          iso88023-csmacd(7)\n         \
    \ starLan(11)\n   For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in\
    \ the\n   MIB-II [6] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:\n          dot3    OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFER ::= { transmission 7 }\n   The definitions presented here are based\
    \ on the IEEE 802.3 Layer\n   Management Specification [9], as originally interpreted\
    \ by Frank\n   Kastenholz of Interlan in [10].  Implementors of these MIB objects\n\
    \   should note that the IEEE document explicitly describes (in the form\n   of\
    \ Pascal pseudocode) when, where, and how various MAC attributes are\n   measured.\
    \  The IEEE document also describes the effects of MAC\n   actions that may be\
    \ invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB\n   objects defined here.\n   To\
    \ the extent that some of the attributes defined in [9] are\n   represented by\
    \ previously defined objects in the Internet- standard\n   MIB or in the Generic\
    \ Interface Extensions MIB [11], such attributes\n   are not redundantly represented\
    \ by objects defined in this memo.\n   Among the attributes represented by objects\
    \ defined in other memos\n   are the number of octets transmitted or received\
    \ on a particular\n   interface, the number of frames transmitted or received\
    \ on a\n   particular interface, the promiscuous status of an interface, the MAC\n\
    \   address of an interface, and multicast information associated with an\n  \
    \ interface.\n   The relationship between an ethernet-like interface and an interface\n\
    \   in the context of the Internet-standard MIB is one-to-one.  As such,\n   the\
    \ value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to\n   identify corresponding\
    \ instances of the objects defined herein.\n"

  - "6.  Acknowledgements\n   This document was produced by the Ethernet MIB Working\
    \ Group.\n   This document is based on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB, RFC\n\
    \   1284 [14], of which John Cook of Chipcom was the editor.  The\n   Ethernet\
    \ MIB Working Group gathered implementation experience of the\n   variables specified\
    \ in RFC 1284 and used that information to develop\n   this revised MIB.\n   RFC\
    \ 1284, in turn, is based on a document written by Frank Kastenholz\n   of Interlan\
    \ entitled IEEE 802.3 Layer Management Draft M compatible\n   MIB for TCP/IP Networks\
    \ [10].  This document has been modestly\n   reworked, initially by the SNMP Working\
    \ Group, and then by the\n   Transmission Working Group, to reflect the current\
    \ conventions for\n   defining objects for MIB interfaces.  James Davin, of the\
    \ MIT\n   Laboratory for Computer Science, and Keith McCloghrie of Hughes LAN\n\
    \   Systems, contributed to later drafts of this memo. Marshall Rose of\n   Performance\
    \ Systems International, Inc. converted the document into\n   its current concise\
    \ format. Anil Rijsinghani of DEC contributed text\n   that more adequately describes\
    \ the TDR test.  Thanks to Frank\n   Kastenholz of Interlan and Louis Steinberg\
    \ of IBM for their\n   experimentation.\n"
