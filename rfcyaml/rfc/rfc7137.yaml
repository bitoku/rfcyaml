  - "1.  Introduction\n   The OSPF-MANET interface [RFC5820] uses the point-to-multipoint\n\
    \   adjacency model over a broadcast media to allow the following:\n   o  All\
    \ router-to-router connections are treated as if they were\n      point-to-point\
    \ links.\n   o  The link metric can be set on a per-neighbor basis.\n   o  Broadcast\
    \ and multicast can be accomplished through the Layer 2\n      broadcast capabilities\
    \ of the media.\n   It is clear that the characteristics of the MANET interface\
    \ can also\n   be beneficial in other types of network deployments -- specifically,\n\
    \   in single-hop broadcast capable networks that may have a different\n   cost\
    \ associated with any pair of nodes.\n   This document updates [RFC5820] by describing\
    \ the use of the MANET\n   interface in single-hop broadcast networks; this consists\
    \ of its\n   simplified operation by not requiring the use of overlapping relays\n\
    \   as well as introducing a new heuristic for smart peering using the\n   Router\
    \ Priority.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Single-Hop Broadcast Networks
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Single-Hop Broadcast Networks\n   The OSPF extensions for MANETs assume\
    \ the ad hoc formation of a\n   network over bandwidth-constrained wireless links,\
    \ where packets may\n   traverse several intermediate nodes before reaching their\
    \ destination\n   (multi-hop paths on the interface).  By contrast, a single-hop\n\
    \   broadcast network (as considered in this document) is one that is\n   structured\
    \ in such a way that all the nodes in it are directly\n   connected to each other.\
    \  An Ethernet interface is a good example of\n   the connectivity model.\n  \
    \ Furthermore, the single-hop networks considered may have different\n   link\
    \ metrics associated to the connectivity between a specific pair\n   of neighbors.\
    \  The OSPF broadcast model [RFC2328] can't accurately\n   describe these differences.\
    \  A point-to-multipoint description is\n   more appropriate given that each node\
    \ can reach every other node\n   directly.\n   In summary, the single-hop broadcast\
    \ interfaces considered in this\n   document have the following characteristics:\n\
    \   o  direct connectivity between all the nodes\n   o  different link metrics\
    \ that may exist per-neighbor\n   o  broadcast/multicast capabilities\n"

- title: 3.  Single-Hop Network Operation
  contents:
  - "3.  Single-Hop Network Operation\n   The operation of the MANET interface doesn't\
    \ change when implemented\n   on a single-hop broadcast interface.  However, the\
    \ operation of some\n   of the proposed enhancements can be simplified.  Explicitly,\
    \ the\n   Overlapping Relay Discovery Process SHOULD NOT be executed, and the\n\
    \   A-bit SHOULD NOT be set by any of the nodes, so that the result is an\n  \
    \ empty set of Active Overlapping Relays.\n   This document describes the use\
    \ of already defined mechanisms and\n   requires no additional on-the-wire changes.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Use of Router Priority
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Use of Router Priority\n   Smart peering [RFC5820] can be used to reduce\
    \ the burden of requiring\n   a full mesh of adjacencies.  In short, a new adjacency\
    \ is not\n   required if reachability to the node is already available through\
    \ the\n   existing shortest path tree (SPT).  In general, the reachability is\n\
    \   verified on a first-come-first-served basis; i.e., in a typical\n   network,\
    \ the neighbors with which a FULL adjacency is set up depend\n   on the order\
    \ of discovery.\n   The state machine for smart peering allows for the definition\
    \ of\n   heuristics, beyond the SPT reachability, to decide whether or not it\n\
    \   considers a new adjacency to be of value.  This section describes one\n  \
    \ such heuristic to be used in Step (3) of the state machine, in place\n   of\
    \ the original one in Section 3.5.3.2 of [RFC5820].\n   The Router Priority (as\
    \ defined in OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3\n   [RFC5340]) is used in the election\
    \ of the (Backup) Designated Router,\n   and can be configured only in broadcast\
    \ and Non-Broadcast Multi-\n   Access (NBMA) interfaces.  The MANET interface\
    \ is a broadcast\n   interface using the point-to-multipoint adjacency model;\
    \ this means\n   that no (Backup) Designated Router is elected.  For its use with\
    \ the\n   MANET interface, the Router Priority is defined as:\n   Router Priority\n\
    \         An 8-bit unsigned integer.  Used to determine the precedence of\n  \
    \       which router(s) to establish a FULL adjacency with during the\n      \
    \   Smart Peering selection process.  When more than one router\n         attached\
    \ to a network is present, the one with the highest\n         Router Priority\
    \ takes precedence.  If there is still a tie, the\n         router with the highest\
    \ Router ID takes precedence.\n   The heuristic for the state machine for smart\
    \ peering is described\n   as:\n           (3)                      |\n      \

    \  In order to avoid churn in the selection and establishment of the\n   adjacencies,\

    \ before running the state machine for smart\n   peering.  Note that this wait\
    \ should cause the selection process to\n   consider all the nodes on the link,\
    \ instead of being triggered based\n   on receiving a Hello message from a potential\
    \ neighbor.  The nodes\n   selected using this process are referred to simply\
    \ as \"smart peers\".\n   It is RECOMMENDED that the maximum number of adjacencies\
    \ be set to 2.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Unsynchronized Adjacencies
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Unsynchronized Adjacencies\n   An unsynchronized adjacency [RFC5820] is\
    \ one for which the database\n   synchronization is postponed, but that is announced\
    \ as FULL because\n   SPT reachability can be proven.  A single-hop broadcast\
    \ network has a\n   connectivity model in which all the nodes are directly connected\
    \ to\n   each other.  This connectivity results in a simplified reachability\n\
    \   check through the SPT: the adjacency to a specific peer MUST be\n   advertised\
    \ as FULL by at least one smart peer.\n   The single-hop nature of the interface\
    \ allows then the advertisement\n   of the reachable adjacencies as FULL without\
    \ additional signaling.\n   Flooding SHOULD be enabled for all the unsynchronized\
    \ adjacencies to\n   take advantage of the broadcast nature of the media.  As\
    \ a result,\n   all the nodes in the interface will be able to use all the LSAs\n\
    \   received.\n"
- title: 4.  Single-Hop Network Detection
  contents:
  - "4.  Single-Hop Network Detection\n   A single-hop network is one in which all\
    \ the nodes are directly\n   connected.  Detection of such an interface can be\
    \ easily done at\n   every node by comparing the speaker's 1-hop neighbors with\
    \ its 2-hop\n   neighborhood.  If for every 1-hop neighbor, the set of 2-hop\n\
    \   neighbors contains the whole set of the remaining 1-hop neighbors,\n   then\
    \ the interface is a single-hop network; this condition is called\n   the Single-Hop\
    \ Condition.\n   A new field is introduced in the MANET interface data structure.\
    \  The\n   name of the field is SingleHop, and it is a flag indicating whether\n\
    \   the interface is operating in single-hop mode (as described in\n   Section\
    \ 3).  The SingleHop flag is set when the node meets the\n   Single-Hop Condition\
    \ on the interface.  If the Single-Hop Condition\n   is no longer met, then the\
    \ SingleHop flag MUST be cleared.\n   A new timer is introduced to guide the transition\
    \ of the interface\n   from/to multi-hop mode (which is the default mode described\
    \ in\n   [RFC5820]) to/from single-hop mode:\n   o  ModeChange: Every time a node\
    \ changes the state of the SingleHop\n      flag for the interface, the corresponding\
    \ ModeChange timer MUST be\n      set.  The ModeChange timer represents the length\
    \ of time in\n      seconds that an interface SHOULD wait before changing between\n\
    \      multi-hop and single-hop modes.  It is RECOMMENDED that this timer\n  \
    \    be set to Wait Time [RFC2328].\n   The following sections describe the steps\
    \ to be taken to transition\n   between interface modes.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Transition from Multi-Hop to Single-Hop Mode
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Transition from Multi-Hop to Single-Hop Mode\n   Detection of the Single-Hop\
    \ Condition triggers the transition into\n   single-hop mode by setting both the\
    \ SingleHop flag and the ModeChange\n   timer.\n   Once the ModeChange timer expires,\
    \ the heuristic defined in\n   Section 3.1 MAY be executed to optimize the set\
    \ of adjacencies on the\n   interface.  Note that an adjacency MUST NOT transition\
    \ from FULL to\n   2-Way unless the simplified reachability check (Section 3.2)\
    \ can be\n   verified.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Transition from Single-Hop to Multi-Hop Mode
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Transition from Single-Hop to Multi-Hop Mode\n   Not meeting the Single-Hop\
    \ Condition triggers the transition into\n   multi-hop mode by clearing the SingleHop\
    \ flag and setting the\n   ModeChange timer.  The A-bit MUST be set if the Single-Hop\
    \ condition\n   is no longer met because of one of the following cases:\n   o\
    \  an increase in the set of 1-hop neighbors, without the\n      corresponding\
    \ increase of the 2-hop neighborhood\n   o  a decrease of the 2-hop neighborhood\
    \ while maintaining all the\n      previous 1-hop neighbors\n   Once the ModeChange\
    \ timer expires, the multi-hop operation described\n   in [RFC5820] takes over.\n\
    \   Note that the cases listed above may result in the interface either\n   gaining\
    \ or losing a node before the ModeChange timer expires.  In\n   both cases, the\
    \ heuristic defined in Section 3.1 MAY be executed to\n   optimize the set of\
    \ adjacencies on the interface.\n   In the case that a node joins the interface,\
    \ the Designated Router\n   and Backup Designated Router fields in the Hello packet\
    \ [RFC2328] MAY\n   be used to inform the new node of the identity (Router ID)\
    \ of the\n   current smart peers (and avoid the optimization).\n"
