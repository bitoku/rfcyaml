  - "Abstract\n   The IANA registry named \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest\n\
    \   Algorithm Values\" defines values for digest algorithms used by\n   Instance\
    \ Digests in HTTP.  Instance Digests in HTTP provide a digest,\n   also known\
    \ as a checksum or hash, of an entire representation of the\n   current state\
    \ of a resource.  This document adds new values to the\n   registry and updates\

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IANA registry named \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\
    \ Digest\n   Algorithm Values\" defines values for digest algorithms used by\n\
    \   Instance Digests in HTTP.\n   Note: This is unrelated to HTTP Digest Authentication.\
    \  Instance\n   Digests in HTTP provide a digest, also known as a checksum or\
    \ hash,\n   of an entire representation of the current state of a resource.\n\
    \   The registry was created by [RFC3230] in 2002.  This document adds\n   new\
    \ values to the registry and updates previous values that had\n   redundant or\
    \ outdated references.\n"
