  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some authentication methods, including EAP-PEAP, EAP-TTLS,
    EAP-SIM\n   and EAP-AKA, can hide the true identity of the user from RADIUS\n
    \  servers outside of the user's home network.  In these methods, the\n   User-Name(1)
    attribute contains an anonymous identity (e.g.,\n   @example.com) sufficient to
    route the RADIUS packets to the home\n   network but otherwise insufficient to
    identify the user.  While this\n   mechanism is good practice in some circumstances,
    there are problems\n   if local and intermediate networks require a surrogate
    identity to\n   bind the current session.\n   This document introduces an attribute
    that serves as an alias or\n   handle (hereafter, it is called Chargeable-User-Identity)
    to the real\n   user's identity.  Chargeable-User-Identity can be used outside
    the\n   home network in scenarios that traditionally relied on User-Name(1)\n
    \  to correlate a session to a user.\n   For example, local or intermediate networks
    may limit the number of\n   simultaneous sessions for specific users; they may
    require a\n   Chargeable-User-Identity in order to demonstrate willingness to
    pay\n   or otherwise limit the potential for fraud.\n   This implies that a unique
    identity provided by the home network\n   should be able to be conveyed to all
    parties involved in the roaming\n   transaction for correlating the authentication
    and accounting\n   packets.\n   Providing a unique identity, Chargeable-User-Identity
    (CUI), to\n   intermediaries, is necessary to fulfill certain business needs.
    \ This\n   should not undermine the anonymity of the user.  The mechanism\n   provided
    by this document allows the home operator to meet these\n   business requirements
    by providing a temporary identity representing\n   the user and at the same time
    protecting the anonymity of the user.\n   When the home network assigns a value
    to the CUI, it asserts that\n   this value represents a user in the home network.
    \ The assertion\n   should be temporary -- long enough to be useful for the external\n
    \  applications and not too long such that it can be used to identify\n   the
    user.\n   Several organizations, including WISPr, GSMA, 3GPP, Wi-Fi Alliance,\n
    \  and IRAP, have been studying mechanisms to provide roaming services,\n   using
    RADIUS.  Missing elements include mechanisms for billing and\n   fraud prevention.\n
    \  The CUI attribute is intended to close operational loopholes in\n   RADIUS
    specifications that have impacted roaming solutions\n   negatively.  Use of the
    CUI is geared toward EAP methods supporting\n   privacy (such as PEAP and EAP-TTLS),
    which are, for the most part,\n   recent deployments.  A chargeable identity reflecting
    the user\n   profile by the home network is needed in such roaming scenarios.\n"

    - "1.1.  Motivation\n   Some other mechanisms have been proposed in place of the
      CUI\n   attribute.  These mechanisms are insufficient or cause other\n   problems.
      \ It has been suggested that standard RADIUS Class(25) or\n   User-Name(1) attributes
      could be used to indicate the CUI.  However,\n   in a complex global roaming
      environment where there could be one or\n   more intermediaries between the
      NAS [RFC4282] and the home RADIUS\n   server, the use of aforementioned attributes
      could lead to problems\n   as described below.\n      - On the use of RADIUS
      Class(25) attribute:\n      [RFC2865] states: \"This Attribute is available
      to be sent by the\n      server to the client in an Access-Accept packet and
      SHOULD be sent\n      unmodified by the client to the accounting server as part
      of the\n      Accounting-Request packet if accounting is supported.  The client\n
      \     MUST NOT interpret the attribute locally.\"  So RADIUS clients or\n      intermediaries
      MUST NOT interpret the Class(25) attribute, which\n      precludes determining
      whether it contains a CUI.  Additionally,\n      there could be multiple class
      attributes in a RADIUS packet, and\n      since the contents of Class(25) attribute
      is not to be interpreted\n      by clients, this makes it hard for the entities
      outside the home\n      network to determine which one contains the CUI.\n      -
      On the use of RADIUS User-Name(1) attribute:\n      The User-Name(1) attribute
      included in the Access-Request packet\n      may be used for the purpose of
      routing the Access-Request packet,\n      and in the process may be rewritten
      by intermediaries.  As a\n      result, a RADIUS server receiving an Access-Request
      packet relayed\n      by a proxy cannot assume that the User-Name(1) attribute
      remained\n      unmodified.\n      On the other hand, rewriting of a User-Name(1)
      attribute sent\n      within an Access-Accept packet occurs more rarely, since
      a\n      Proxy-State(33) attribute can be used to route the Access-Accept\n
      \     packet without parsing the User-Name(1) attribute.  As a result, a\n      RADIUS
      server cannot assume that a proxy stripping routing\n      information from
      a User-Name(1) attribute within an Access-Request\n      packet will add this
      information to a User-Name(1) attribute\n      included within an Access-Accept
      packet.  The result is that when\n      a User-Name(1) attribute is sent in
      an Access-Accept packet, it is\n      possible that the Access-Request packet
      and Accounting-Request\n      packets will follow different paths.  Where this
      outcome is\n      undesirable, the RADIUS client should use the original\n      User-Name(1)
      in accounting packets.  Therefore, another mechanism\n      is required to convey
      a CUI within an Access-Accept packet to the\n      RADIUS client, so that the
      CUI can be included in the accounting\n      packets.\n   The CUI attribute
      provides a solution to the above problems and\n   avoids overloading RADIUS
      User-Name(1) attribute or changing the\n   usage of existing RADIUS Class(25)
      attribute.  The CUI therefore\n   provides a standard approach to billing and
      fraud prevention when EAP\n   methods supporting privacy are used.  It does
      not solve all related\n   problems, but does provide for billing and fraud prevention.\n"

- contents:
  - "2.  Operation\n   This document assumes that the RADIUS protocol operates as
    specified\n   in [RFC2865] and [RFC2866], dynamic authorization as specified in\n
    \  [RFC3576], and the Diameter protocol as specified in [RFC3588].\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Chargeable-User-Identity (CUI) Attribute\n   The CUI attribute serves
      as an alias to the user's real identity,\n   representing a chargeable identity
      as defined and provided by the\n   home network as a supplemental or alternative
      information to\n   User-Name(1).  Typically, the CUI represents the identity
      of the\n   actual user, but it may also indicate other chargeable identities\n
      \  such as a group of users.  RADIUS clients (proxy or NAS) outside the\n   home
      network MUST NOT modify the CUI attribute.\n   The RADIUS server (a RADIUS proxy,
      home RADIUS server) may include\n   the CUI attribute in the Access-Accept packet
      destined to a roaming\n   partner.  The CUI support by RADIUS infrastructure
      is driven by the\n   business requirements between roaming entities.  Therefore,
      a RADIUS\n   server supporting this specification may choose not to send the
      CUI\n   in response to an Access-Request packet from a given NAS, even if the\n
      \  NAS has indicated that it supports CUI.\n   If an Access-Accept packet without
      the CUI attribute was received by\n   a RADIUS client that requested the CUI
      attribute, then the\n   Access-Accept packet MAY be treated as an Access-Reject.\n
      \  If the CUI was included in an Access-Accept packet, RADIUS clients\n   supporting
      the CUI attribute MUST ensure that the CUI attribute\n   appears in the RADIUS
      Accounting-Request (Start, Interim, and Stop).\n   This requirement applies
      regardless of whether the RADIUS client\n   requested the CUI attribute.\n   RFC
      2865 includes the following statements about behaviors of RADIUS\n   client
      and server with respect to unsupported attributes:\n      - \"A RADIUS client
      MAY ignore Attributes with an unknown Type.\"\n      - \"A RADIUS server MAY
      ignore Attributes with an unknown Type.\"\n   Therefore, RADIUS clients or servers
      that do not support the CUI may\n   ignore the attribute.\n   A RADIUS client
      requesting the CUI attribute in an Access-Accept\n   packet MUST include within
      the Access-Request packet a CUI attribute.\n   For the initial authentication,
      the CUI attribute will include a\n   single NUL character (referred to as a
      nul CUI).  And, during\n   re-authentication, the CUI attribute will include
      a previously\n   received CUI value (referred to as a non-nul CUI value) in
      the\n   Access-Accept.\n   Upon receiving a non-nul CUI value in an Access-Request,
      the home\n   RADIUS server MAY verify that the value of CUI matches the CUI
      from\n   the previous Access-Accept.  If the verification fails, then the\n
      \  RADIUS server SHOULD respond with an Access-Reject message.\n   If a home
      RADIUS server that supports the CUI attribute receives an\n   Access-Request
      packet containing a CUI (set to nul or otherwise), it\n   MUST include the CUI
      attribute in the Access-Accept packet.\n   Otherwise, if the Access-Request
      packet does not contain a CUI, the\n   home RADIUS server SHOULD NOT include
      the CUI attribute in the\n   Access-Accept packet.  The Access-Request may be
      sent either in the\n   initial authentication or during re-authentication.\n
      \  A NAS that requested the CUI during re-authentication by including\n   the
      CUI in the Access-Request will receive the CUI in the\n   Access-Accept.  The
      NAS MUST include the value of that CUI in all\n   Accounting Messages.\n"
