  - "Abstract\n   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system\n\
    \   routing protocol designed for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\n   Protocol\
    \ (TCP/IP) networks.  BGP requires that all BGP speakers\n   within a single autonomous\
    \ system (AS) must be fully meshed.  This\n   represents a serious scaling problem\
    \ that has been well documented in\n   a number of proposals.\n   This document\
    \ describes an extension to BGP which may be used to\n   create a confederation\
    \ of autonomous systems that is represented as a\n   single autonomous system\
    \ to BGP peers external to the confederation,\n   thereby removing the \"full\
    \ mesh\" requirement.  The intention of this\n   extension is to aid in policy\
    \ administration and reduce the\n   management complexity of maintaining a large\
    \ autonomous system.\n"

- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   As currently defined, BGP requires that all BGP speakers\
    \ within a\n   single AS must be fully meshed.  The result is that for n BGP\n\
    \   speakers within an AS n*(n-1)/2 unique IBGP sessions are required.\n   This\
    \ \"full mesh\" requirement clearly does not scale when there are a\n   large\
    \ number of IBGP speakers within the autonomous system, as is\n   common in many\
    \ networks today.\n   This scaling problem has been well documented and a number\
    \ of\n   proposals have been made to alleviate this [3,5].  This document\n  \
    \ represents another alternative in alleviating the need for a \"full\n   mesh\"\
    \ and is known as \"Autonomous System Confederations for BGP\", or\n   simply,\
    \ \"BGP Confederations\".  It can also be said the BGP\n   Confederations MAY\
    \ provide improvements in routing policy control.\n   This document is a revision\
    \ of RFC 1965 [4] and it includes editorial\n   changes, clarifications and corrections\
    \ based on the deployment\n   experience with BGP Confederations.  These revisions\
    \ are summarized\n   in Appendix A.\n"

- title: 4. Discussion
  contents:
  - "4. Discussion\n   It may be useful to subdivide autonomous systems with a very\
    \ large\n   number of BGP speakers into smaller domains for purposes of\n   controlling\
    \ routing policy via information contained in the BGP\n   AS_PATH attribute. \
    \ For example, one may choose to consider all BGP\n   speakers in a geographic\
    \ region as a single entity.  In addition to\n   potential improvements in routing\
    \ policy control, if techniques such\n   as those presented here or in [5] are\
    \ not employed, [1] requires BGP\n   speakers in the same autonomous system to\
    \ establish a full mesh of\n   TCP connections among all speakers for the purpose\
    \ of exchanging\n   exterior routing information.  In autonomous systems the number\
    \ of\n   intra-domain connections that need to be maintained by each border\n\
    \   router can become significant.\n   Subdividing a large autonomous system allows\
    \ a significant reduction\n   in the total number of intra-domain BGP connections,\
    \ as the\n   connectivity requirements simplify to the model used for inter-domain\n\
    \   connections.\n   Unfortunately subdividing an autonomous system may increase\
    \ the\n   complexity of routing policy based on AS_PATH information for all\n\
    \   members of the Internet.  Additionally, this division increases the\n   maintenance\
    \ overhead of coordinating external peering when the\n   internal topology of\
    \ this collection of autonomous systems is\n   modified.\n   Finally, dividing\
    \ a large AS may unnecessarily increase the length of\n   the sequence portions\
    \ of the AS_PATH attribute.  Several common BGP\n   implementations can use the\
    \ number of \"AS hops\" required to reach a\n   given destination as part of the\
    \ path selection criteria.  While this\n   is not an optimal method of determining\
    \ route preference, given the\n   lack of other in-band information, it provides\
    \ a reasonable default\n   behavior which is widely used across the Internet.\
    \  Therefore,\n   division of an autonomous system into separate systems may adversely\n\
    \   affect optimal routing of packets through the Internet.\n   However, there\
    \ is usually no need to expose the internal topology of\n   this divided autonomous\
    \ system, which means it is possible to regard\n   a collection of autonomous\
    \ systems under a common administration as a\n   single entity or autonomous system\
    \ when viewed from outside the\n   confines of the confederation of autonomous\
    \ systems itself.\n"
- title: 5. AS_CONFED Segment Type Extension
  contents:
  - "5. AS_CONFED Segment Type Extension\n   Currently, BGP specifies that the AS_PATH\
    \ attribute is a well-known\n   mandatory attribute that is composed of a sequence\
    \ of AS path\n   segments.  Each AS path segment is represented by a triple <path\n\
    \   segment type, path segment length, path segment value>.\n   In [1], the path\
    \ segment type is a 1-octet long field with the two\n   following values defined:\n\
    \   Value     Segment Type\n      1       AS_SET: unordered set of ASs a route\
    \ in the\n              UPDATE message has traversed\n      2       AS_SEQUENCE:\
    \ ordered set of ASs a route in\n              the UPDATE message has traversed\n\
    \   This document reserves two additional segment types:\n      3       AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE:\
    \ ordered set of Member AS Numbers\n              in the local confederation that\
    \ the UPDATE message has\n              traversed\n      4       AS_CONFED_SET:\
    \ unordered set of Member AS Numbers in\n              the local confederation\
    \ that the UPDATE message has\n              traversed\n"
- title: 6. Operation
  contents:
  - "6. Operation\n   A member of a BGP confederation will use its AS Confederation\
    \ ID in\n   all transactions with peers that are not members of its\n   confederation.\
    \  This confederation identifier is considered to be the\n   \"externally visible\"\
    \ AS number and this number is used in OPEN\n   messages and advertised in the\
    \ AS_PATH attribute.\n   A member of a BGP confederation will use its Member AS\
    \ Number in all\n   transactions with peers that are members of the same confederation\
    \ as\n   the given router.\n   A BGP speaker receiving an AS_PATH attribute containing\
    \ an autonomous\n   system matching its own confederation shall treat the path\
    \ in the\n   same fashion as if it had received a path containing its own AS\n\
    \   number.\n   A BGP speaker receiving an AS_PATH attribute containing an\n \
    \  AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET which contains its own Member AS\n   Number\
    \ shall treat the path in the same fashion as if it had received\n   a path containing\
    \ its own AS number.\n"
- title: 6.1. AS_PATH Modification Rules
  contents:
  - "6.1. AS_PATH Modification Rules\n   Section 5.1.2 of [1] is replaced with the\
    \ following text:\n   When a BGP speaker propagates a route which it has learned\
    \ from\n   another BGP speaker's UPDATE message, it shall modify the route's\n\
    \   AS_PATH attribute based on the location of the BGP speaker to which\n   the\
    \ route will be sent:\n   a) When a given BGP speaker advertises the route to\
    \ another BGP\n      speaker located in its own autonomous system, the advertising\n\
    \      speaker shall not modify the AS_PATH attribute associated with the\n  \
    \    route.\n   b) When a given BGP speaker advertises the route to a BGP speaker\n\
    \      located in a neighboring autonomous system that is a member of the\n  \
    \    local autonomous system confederation, then the advertising\n      speaker\
    \ shall update the AS_PATH attribute as follows:\n      1) if the first path segment\
    \ of the AS_PATH is of type\n         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE, the local system shall\
    \ prepend its own AS\n         number as the last element of the sequence (put\
    \ it in the\n         leftmost position).\n      2) if the first path segment\
    \ of the AS_PATH is not of type\n         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE the local system\
    \ shall prepend a new path\n         segment of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE to the\
    \ AS_PATH, including\n         its own confederation identifier in that segment.\n\
    \   c) When a given BGP speaker advertises the route to a BGP speaker\n      located\
    \ in a neighboring autonomous system that is not a member of\n      the current\
    \ autonomous system confederation, the advertising\n      speaker shall update\
    \ the AS_PATH attribute as follows:\n      1) if the first path segment of the\
    \ AS_PATH is of type\n         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE, that segment and any immediately\
    \ following\n         segments of the type AS_CONFED_SET or AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE\
    \ are\n         removed from the AS_PATH attribute, leaving the sanitized\n  \
    \       AS_PATH attribute to be operated on by steps 2, or 3.\n      2) if the\
    \ first path segment of the remaining AS_PATH is of type\n         AS_SEQUENCE,\
    \ the local system shall prepend its own\n         confederation ID as the last\
    \ element of the sequence (put it in\n         the leftmost position).\n     \
    \ 3) if there are no path segments following the removal of the\n         first\
    \ AS_CONFED_SET/AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segments, or if the\n         first path segment\
    \ of the remaining AS_PATH is of type AS_SET\n         the local system shall\
    \ prepend a new path segment of type\n         AS_SEQUENCE to the AS_PATH, including\
    \ its own confederation ID\n         in that segment.\n   When a BGP speaker originates\
    \ a route:\n   a) the originating speaker shall include an empty AS_PATH attribute\n\
    \      in all UPDATE messages sent to BGP speakers located in its own\n      Member\
    \ AS Number.  (An empty AS_PATH attribute is one whose length\n      field contains\
    \ the value zero).\n   b) the originating speaker shall include its own Member\
    \ AS Number in\n      an AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segment of the AS_PATH attribute of\
    \ all\n      UPDATE messages sent to BGP speakers located in neighboring\n   \
    \   Member-AS that are members of the local confederation (i.e., the\n      originating\
    \ speaker's Member AS Number will be the only entry in\n      the AS_PATH attribute).\n\
    \   c) the originating speaker shall include its own autonomous system in\n  \
    \    an AS_SEQUENCE segment of the AS_PATH attribute of all UPDATE\n      messages\
    \ sent to BGP speakers located in neighboring autonomous\n      systems that are\
    \ not members of the local confederation.  (In this\n      case, the autonomous\
    \ system number of the originating speaker's\n      member confederation will\
    \ be the only entry in the AS_PATH\n      attribute).\n"
- title: 7. Common Administration Issues
  contents:
  - "7. Common Administration Issues\n   It is reasonable for member ASs of a confederation\
    \ to share a common\n   administration and IGP information for the entire confederation.\n\
    \   It shall be legal for a BGP speaker to advertise an unchanged\n   NEXT_HOP\
    \ and MULTI_EXIT_DISCRIMINATOR (MED) attribute to peers in a\n   neighboring AS\
    \ within the same confederation.  In addition, the\n   restriction against sending\
    \ the LOCAL_PREFERENCE attribute to peers\n   in a neighboring AS within the same\
    \ confederation is removed.  Path\n   selection criteria for information received\
    \ from members inside a\n   confederation MUST follow the same rules used for\
    \ information\n   received from members inside the same autonomous system, as\
    \ specified\n   in [1].\n"
- title: 8. Compatability Considerations

  - "8. Compatability Considerations\n   All BGP speakers participating in a confederation\
    \ must recognize the\n   AS_CONFED_SET and AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segment type extensions\
    \ to the\n   AS_PATH attribute.\n   Any BGP speaker not supporting these extensions\
    \ will generate a\n   notification message specifying an \"UPDATE Message Error\"\
    \ and a sub-\n   code of \"Malformed AS_PATH\".\n   This compatibility issue implies\
    \ that all BGP speakers participating\n   in a confederation MUST support BGP\
    \ confederations.  However, BGP\n   speakers outside the confederation need not\
    \ support these extensions.\n"
- title: 9. Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "9. Deployment Considerations\n   BGP confederations have been widely deployed\
    \ throughout the Internet\n   for a number of years and are supported by multiple\
    \ vendors.\n   Improper configuration of BGP confederations can cause routing\n\
    \   information within an AS to be duplicated unnecessarily.  This\n   duplication\
    \ of information will waste system resources, cause\n   unnecessary route flaps,\
    \ and delay convergence.\n   Care should be taken to manually filter duplicate\
    \ advertisements\n   caused by reachability information being relayed through\
    \ multiple\n   member autonomous systems based upon the topology and redundancy\n\
    \   requirements of the confederation.\n   Additionally, confederations (as well\
    \ as route reflectors), by\n   excluding different reachability information from\
    \ consideration at\n   different locations in a confederation, have been shown\
    \ to cause\n   permanent oscillation between candidate routes when using the tie\n\
    \   breaking rules required by BGP [1].  Care must be taken when\n   selecting\
    \ MED values and tie breaking policy to avoid these\n   situations.\n   One potential\
    \ way to avoid this is by configuring inter-Member-AS IGP\n   metrics higher than\
    \ intra-Member-AS IGP metrics and/or using other\n   tie breaking policies to\
    \ avoid BGP route selection based on\n   incomparable MEDs.\n"
