  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo is a digest of the user network interface specification\
    \ of\n   NTT Communications' dual stack ADSL access service, which provide\n \
    \  IPv6/IPv4 dual stack services to home users.  In order to simplify\n   user\
    \ setup, these services have a mechanism to configure IPv6\n   specific parameters\
    \ automatically.  The memo focuses on two basic\n   parameters:  the prefix assigned\
    \ to the user and the addresses of\n   IPv6 DNS servers, and it specifies a way\
    \ to deliver these parameters\n   to Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) automatically.\n\
    \   This memo covers two topics: an architecture for IPv6/IPv4 dual stack\n  \
    \ access service and an automatic configuration function for IPv6-\n   specific\
    \ parameters.\n   The architecture is mainly targeted at a leased-line ADSL service\
    \ for\n   home users.  It assumes that there is a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\n\
    \   logical link between Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) and Provider\n   Edge\
    \ (PE) equipment.  In order to exclude factors that are specific\n   to access\
    \ lines, this architecture only specifies PPP and its upper\n   layers.  To satisfy\
    \ [RFC3177], the prefix length that is delegated to\n   the CPE is /48, but /64\
    \ is also a possible option.\n   In this architecture, IPv6/IPv4 dual stack service\
    \ is specified as\n   follows.\n     o IPv6 and IPv4 connectivities are provided\
    \ over a single PPP\n       logical link.\n     o IPv6 connectivity is independent\
    \ of IPv4 connectivity.  IPV6CP\n       and IPCP work independently over a single\
    \ PPP logical link.\n   Figure 1 shows an outline of the service architecture.\
    \  NTT\n   Communications has been providing a commercial service based on this\n\
    \   architecture since the Summer 2002.\n          |                         \

    \ Access Service Architecture  +----------------+\n   The automatic configuration\
    \ function aims at simplification of user\n   setup.  Usually, users have to configure\
    \ at least two IPv6-specific\n   parameters: prefix(es) assigned to them [RFC3769]\
    \ and IPv6 DNS\n   servers' addresses.  The function is composed of two sub-functions:\n\
    \     o Delegation of prefix(es) to be used in the user site.\n     o Notification\
    \ of IPv6 DNS server addresses and/or other server\n       addresses.\n   Section\
    \ 2 of this memo details the user/network interface.  Section 3\n   describes\
    \ an example connection sequence.\n"
- title: 2. User/Network Interface
  contents:
  - "2. User/Network Interface\n   This section describes details of the user/network\
    \ interface\n   specification.  Only PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) and its upper layers\n\
    \   are mentioned; the other layers, such as Ethernet and lower layers,\n   are\
    \ out of scope.  IPv4-related parameter configuration is also out\n   of scope.\n"
- title: 2.1. Below the IP Layer
  contents:
  - "2.1. Below the IP Layer\n   The service uses PPP connection and Challenge Handshake\n\
    \   Authentication Protocol (CHAP) authentication to identify each CPE.\n   The\
    \ CPE and PE handle both the PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol\n   (IPCP)\
    \ [RFC1332] and the Internet Protocol V6 Control Protocol\n   (IPV6CP) [RFC2472]\
    \ identically and simultaneously over a single PPP\n   connection.  This means\
    \ either the CPE or the PE can open/close any\n   Network Control Protocol (NCP)\
    \ session at any time without any side-\n   effect for the other.  It is intended\
    \ that users can choose among\n   three services: IPv4 only, IPv6 only, and IPv4/IPv6\
    \ dual stack.  A\n   CPE connected to an ADSL line discovers a PE with the PPPoE\
    \ mechanism\n   [RFC2516].\n   Note that, because CPE and PE can negotiate only\
    \ their interface\n   identifiers with IPV6CP, PE and CPE can use only link-local-scope\n\
    \   addresses before the prefix delegation mechanism described below is\n   run.\n"
- title: 2.2. IP Layer
  contents:
  - "2.2. IP Layer\n   After IPV6CP negotiation, the CPE initiates a prefix delegation\n\
    \   request.  The PE chooses a global-scope prefix for the CPE with\n   information\
    \ from an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\n   (AAA) server or local\
    \ prefix pools, and it delegates the prefix to\n   the CPE.  Once the prefix is\
    \ delegated, the prefix is subnetted and\n   assigned to the local interfaces\
    \ of the CPE.  The CPE begins sending\n   router advertisements for the prefixes\
    \ on each link.  Eventually,\n   hosts can acquire global-scope prefixes through\
    \ conventional IPv6\n   stateless [RFC2462] or stateful auto-configuration mechanisms\n\
    \   ([RFC3315], etc.) and begin to communicate using global-scope\n   addresses.\n"
- title: 2.3. Prefix Delegation
  contents:
  - "2.3. Prefix Delegation\n   The PE delegates prefixes to CPE using Dynamic Host\
    \ Configuration\n   Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] with the prefix delegation\n\
    \   options [RFC3633].  The sequence for prefix delegation is as follows:\n  \
    \   o The CPE requests prefix(es) from a PE by sending a DHCPv6 Solicit\n    \
    \   message that has a link-local source address negotiated by\n       IPV6CP,\
    \ mentioned in the previous section, and includes an IA_PD\n       option.\n \
    \    o An AAA server provides prefix(es) to the PE or the PE chooses\n       prefix(es)\
    \ from its local pool, and the PE returns an Advertise\n       message that contains\
    \ an IA_PD option and IA_PD Prefix options.\n       The prefix-length in the IA_PD\
    \ Prefix option is 48.\n       IA_PD option and IA_PD Prefix options for the chosen\
    \ prefix(es)\n       back to the PE.\n     o The PE confirms the prefix(es) in\
    \ the Request message in a Reply\n       message.\n   If IPV6CP is terminated\
    \ or restarted by any reason, CPE must initiate\n   a Rebind/Reply message exchange\
    \ as described in [RFC3633].\n"
- title: 2.4. Address Assignment
  contents:
  - "2.4. Address Assignment\n   The CPE assigns global-scope /64 prefixes, subnetted\
    \ from the\n   delegated prefix, to its downstream interfaces.  When the delegated\n\
    \   prefix has an infinite lifetime, the preferred and valid lifetimes of\n  \
    \ assigned /64 prefixes should be the default values in [RFC2461].\n   Because\
    \ a link-local address is already assigned to the CPE's\n   upstream interface,\
    \ global-scope address assignment for that\n   interface is optional.\n"
- title: 2.5. Routing
  contents:
  - "2.5. Routing\n   The CPE and PE use static routing between them, and no routing\n\
    \   protocol traffic is necessary.\n   The CPE configures its PPPoE logical interface\
    \ or the link-local\n   address of PE as the IPv6 default gateway, automatically\
    \ after the\n   prefix delegation exchange.\n   When the CPE receives packets\
    \ that are destined for the addresses in\n   the delegated /48 prefix, the CPE\
    \ must not forward the packets to a\n   PE.  The CPE should return ICMPv6 Destination\
    \ Unreachable message to\n   a source address or silently discard the packets,\
    \ when the original\n   packet is destined for the unassigned prefix in the delegated\
    \ prefix.\n   (For example, the CPE should install a reject route or null interface\n\
    \   as next hop for the delegated prefix.)\n"
- title: 2.6. Obtaining Addresses of DNS Servers
  contents:
  - "2.6. Obtaining Addresses of DNS Servers\n   The service provides IPv6 recursive\
    \ DNS servers in the ISP site.  The\n   PE notifies the global unicast addresses\
    \ of these servers with the\n   Domain Name Server option that is described in\
    \ [RFC3646], in\n   Advertise/Reply messages on the prefix delegation message\
    \ exchange.\n   Devices connected to user network may learn a recursive DNS server\n\
    \   address with the mechanism described in [RFC3736].\n   The CPE may serve as\
    \ a local DNS proxy server and include its address\n   in the DNS server address\
    \ list.  This is easy to implement, because\n   it is analogous to IPv4 SOHO router\
    \ (192.168.0.1 is a DNS proxy\n   server and a default router in most sites).\n"
- title: 2.7. Miscellaneous Information
  contents:
  - "2.7. Miscellaneous Information\n   The PE may notify other IPv6-enabled server\
    \ addresses, such as\n   Network Time Protocol servers [RFC4075], SIP servers\
    \ [RFC3319], etc.,\n   in an Advertise/Reply message on the prefix delegation\
    \ message\n   exchange, if those are available.\n"
- title: 2.8. Connectivity Monitoring
  contents:
  - "2.8. Connectivity Monitoring\n   ICMPv6 Echo Request will be sent to the user\
    \ network for connectivity\n   monitoring in the service.  The CPE must return\
    \ a single IPv6 Echo\n   Reply packet when it receives an ICMPv6 Echo Request\
    \ packet.  The\n   health-check packets are addressed to a subnet-router anycast\
    \ address\n   for the delegated prefix.\n   The old document of APNIC IPv6 address\
    \ assignment policy required\n   that APNIC could ping the subnet anycast address\
    \ to check address\n   usage.\n   To achieve this requirement, for example, once\
    \ the prefix\n   2001:db8:ffff::/48 is delegated, the CPE must reply to the ICMPv6\n\
    \   Echo Request destined for 2001:db8:ffff:: any time that IPV6CP and\n   DHCPv6-PD\
    \ are up for the upstream direction.  Because some\n   implementations couldn't\
    \ reply when 2001:db8:ffff::/64 was assigned\n   to its downstream physical interface\
    \ and the interface was down, such\n   an implementation should assign 2001:db8:ffff::/64\
    \ for the loopback\n   interface, which is always up, and 2001:db8:ffff:1::/64,\n\
    \   2001:db8:ffff:2::/64, etc., to physical interfaces.\n"

- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   In this architecture, the PE and CPE trust the\
    \ point-to-point link\n   between them; they trust that there is no man-in-the-middle\
    \ and they\n   trust PPPoE authentication.  Because of this, DHCP authentication\
    \ is\n   not considered necessary and is not used.\n   The service provides an\
    \ always-on global-scope prefix for users.\n   Each device connected to user network\
    \ has global-scope addresses.\n   Without any packet filters, devices might be\
    \ accessible from outside\n   the user network in that case.  The CPE and each\
    \ device involved in\n   the service should have functionality to protect against\
    \ unauthorized\n   accesses, such as a stateful inspection packet filter.  The\n\
    \   relationship between CPE and devices connected to the user network\n   for\
    \ this problem should be considered in the future.\n"
