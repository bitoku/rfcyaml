- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such\
    \ as\n   patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are\n \
    \  designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as\n   much\
    \ information as possible about any IPR constraints on a technical\n   proposal\
    \ as early as possible in the development process.  The\n   policies are intended\
    \ to benefit the Internet community and the\n   public at large, while respecting\
    \ the legitimate rights of IPR\n   holders.  This document sets out the IETF policies\
    \ concerning IPR\n   related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also\
    \ describes\n   the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This document\n\
    \   updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 5378, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.\n  \
    \ This document also obsoletes RFCs 3979 and 4879.\n"

    \ (e.g., making,\n      using, selling, importing, distribution, copying, etc.)\
    \ with\n      respect to an Implementing Technology.  For purposes of this\n \
    \     definition, \"valid claim\" means a claim of any unexpired patent or\n \
    \     patent application which shall not have been withdrawn, cancelled,\n   \
    \   or disclaimed, nor held invalid by a court of competent\n      jurisdiction\
    \ in an unappealed or unappealable decision.\n   f. \"General Disclosure\": see\

  - "2.  Introduction\n   The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR),\
    \ such as\n   patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are\n\
    \   designed to ensure that IETF working groups and Participants have as\n   much\
    \ information as possible about any IPR constraints on a technical\n   proposal\
    \ as early as possible in the development process.  The\n   policies are intended\
    \ to benefit the Internet community and the\n   public at large, while respecting\
    \ the legitimate rights of IPR\n   holders.  This document details the IETF policies\
    \ concerning IPR\n   related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also\
    \ describes\n   the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This document\n\
    \   updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 5378, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.\n  \
    \ This document also obsoletes RFC 3979 and RFC 4879.\n   There are three basic\
    \ principles regarding how the IETF deals with\n   claims of Intellectual Property\
    \ Rights (originally outlined in\n   Section 10 of [RFC2026]):\n   (a) The IETF\
    \ will make no determination about the validity of any\n       particular IPR\
    \ claim.\n   (b) The IETF, following normal processes, can decide to use\n   \
    \    technology for which IPR disclosures have been made if it decides\n     \
    \  that such a use is warranted.\n   (c) In order for a working group and the\
    \ rest of the IETF to have the\n       information needed to make an informed\
    \ decision about the use of\n       a particular technology, all those contributing\
    \ to the working\n       group's discussions must disclose the existence of any\
    \ IPR the\n       Contributor or any other IETF Participant believes Covers or\
    \ may\n       ultimately Cover the technology under discussion.  This applies\n\
    \       to both Contributors and other Participants, and applies whether\n   \
    \    they contribute in person, via email, or by other means.  The\n       requirement\
    \ applies to all IPR of the Participant, the\n       Participant's employer, sponsor,\
    \ or others represented by the\n       Participant that are reasonably and personally\
    \ known to the\n       Participant.  No patent search is required.\n   Section\
    \ 1 defines the terms used in this document.  Sections 3\n   through 11 set forth\
    \ the IETF's policies and procedures relating to\n   IPR.  Section 13 lists the\
    \ changes between this document and RFCs\n   3979 and 4879.  A separate document\
    \ [RFC5378] deals with rights (such\n   as copyrights and trademarks) in Contributions,\
    \ including the right\n   of the IETF and IETF Participants to publish and create\
    \ derivative\n   works of those Contributions.  This document is not intended\
    \ to\n   address those issues.  See RFC 6702 [RFC6702] for a discussion of\n \
    \  \"Promoting Compliance with Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)\n   Disclosure\
    \ Rules\".\n   This document is not intended as legal advice.  Readers are advised\n\
    \   to consult their own legal advisors if they would like a legal\n   interpretation\
    \ of their rights or the rights of the IETF in any\n   Contributions they make.\n"

    \ A. The IESG, IAB, ISOC, and IETF Trust disclaim any responsibility\n      for\
    \ identifying the existence of or for evaluating the\n      applicability of any\
    \ IPR, disclosed or otherwise, to any IETF\n      technology, specification, or\
    \ standard, and will take no position\n      on the validity or scope of any such\
    \ IPR.\n   B. When the IETF Secretariat has received a notification under\n  \
    \    Section 5.1.3 of the existence of non-participant IPR that\n      potentially\
    \ Covers a technology under discussion at IETF or which\n      is the subject\
    \ of an IETF Document, the IETF Secretariat shall\n      promptly publish such\
    \ notification and will request that the\n      identified third party make an\
    \ IPR disclosure in accordance with\n      the provisions of Section 5.\n   C.\
    \ When an IPR disclosure has been made as provided in Section 5 of\n      this\
    \ document, the IETF Secretariat may request from the purported\n      holder\
    \ of such IPR a written assurance that upon approval by the\n      IESG for publication\
    \ of the relevant IETF specification(s) as one\n      or more RFCs, all persons\
    \ will be able to obtain the right to\n      implement, use, distribute, and exercise\
    \ other rights with respect\n      to Implementing Technology under one of the\
    \ licensing options\n      specified in Section 5.5.A below unless a statement\
    \ identifying\n      one of the licensing options described in Section 5.5.A has\n\
    \      already been received by the IETF Secretariat.  The working group\n   \
    \   proposing the use of the technology with respect to which the\n      Intellectual\
    \ Property Rights are disclosed may assist the IETF\n      Secretariat in this\
    \ effort.\n      The results of this procedure shall not, in themselves, block\n\
    \      publication of an IETF Document or advancement of an IETF Document\n  \
    \    along the Standards Track.  A working group may take into\n      consideration\
    \ the results of this procedure in evaluating the\n      technology, and the IESG\
    \ may defer approval when a delay may\n      facilitate obtaining such assurances.\
    \  The results will, however,\n      be recorded by the IETF Secretariat and be\
    \ made available online.\n   D. The IESG will not make any determination that\
    \ any terms for the\n      use of an Implementing Technology (e.g., the assurance\
    \ of\n      reasonable and non-discriminatory terms) have been fulfilled in\n\
    \      practice.  It will instead apply the normal requirements for the\n    \
    \  advancement of Internet Standards (see RFC 6410).  If the two\n      unrelated\
    \ implementations of the specification that are required\n      to advance from\
    \ Proposed Standard to Internet Standard have been\n      produced by different\
    \ organizations or individuals, or if the\n      \"significant implementation\
    \ and successful operational experience\"\n      required to advance from Proposed\
    \ Standard to Internet Standard\n      has been achieved, the IESG will presume\
    \ that the terms are\n      reasonable and to some degree non-discriminatory.\
    \  Note that this\n      also applies to the case where multiple implementers\
    \ have\n      concluded that no licensing is required.\n      This presumption\
    \ may be challenged at any time, including during\n      the Last Call period\
    \ by sending email to the IESG.\n"

    \ as Internet-Drafts\n   evolve, text may be added or removed, and it is recommended\
    \ that they\n   keep this in mind when composing text for disclosures.\n   A.\
    \ Unless sufficient information to identify the issued patent was\n      disclosed\
    \ when the patent application was disclosed, an IPR\n      disclosure must be\
    \ updated or a new disclosure made promptly after\n      any of the following\
    \ has occurred: (1) the publication of a\n      previously unpublished patent\
    \ application, (2) the abandonment of\n      a patent application, (3) the issuance\
    \ of a patent on a previously\n      disclosed patent application, or (4) a material\
    \ change to the IETF\n      Document covered by the Disclosure that causes the\
    \ Disclosure to\n      be covered by additional IPR.  If the patent application\
    \ was\n      abandoned, then the new IPR disclosure must explicitly withdraw\n\
    \      any earlier IPR disclosures based on the application.  IPR\n      disclosures\

    \ of the Contribution and by any RFCs that\n      are published from the Contribution\
    \ unless the disclosure has been\n      updated or withdrawn.\n   B. If an IPR\

    \ to, and the claims of which are substantially\n      identical to, the claims\
    \ of a patent or patent application\n      previously disclosed in an IPR disclosure,\

    \ only be\n      updated in accordance with Section 5.5.C.\n   D. Any person may\
    \ submit an update to an existing IPR disclosure.  If\n      such update is submitted\
    \ by a person other than the submitter of\n      the original IPR disclosure (as\
    \ identified by name and email\n      address), then the IETF Secretariat shall\

    \ original submitter responds that the proposed update is not valid,\n      the\
    \ IETF Secretariat will not update the IPR disclosure.  If the\n      original\
    \ submitter fails to respond after the IETF Secretariat has\n      made three\
    \ separate inquiries and at least 30 days have elapsed\n      since the initial\
    \ inquiry was made, then the IETF Secretariat will\n      inform the submitter\
    \ of the proposed update that the update was\n      not validated and that the\
    \ updater must produce legally sufficient\n      evidence that the submitter (or\
    \ his/her employer) owns or has the\n      legal right to exercise control over\
    \ the IPR subject to the IPR\n      disclosure.  If such evidence is satisfactory\
    \ to the IETF\n      Secretariat, after consultation with the IETF legal counsel,\
    \ then\n      the IETF Secretariat will make the requested update.  If such\n\

- title: 5.4.3.  Blanket IPR Statements
  contents:
  - "5.4.3.  Blanket IPR Statements\n   The requirement to make an IPR disclosure\

    \   case because the aim of the disclosure requirement is to provide\n   information\
    \ about specific IPR against specific technology under\n   discussion in the IETF.\
    \  The requirement is also not satisfied by a\n   blanket statement of willingness\
    \ or commitment to license all\n   potential IPR Covering such technology under\
    \ fair, reasonable, and\n   non-discriminatory terms for the same reason.  However,\
    \ the\n   requirement for an IPR disclosure is satisfied by a blanket statement\n\

    \ requirements of Section 5.6 (and either Section 5.1.1 or 5.1.2)\n   to implementers\
    \ of an IETF specification on a royalty-free (and\n   otherwise reasonable and\

  - "5.5.  Licensing Information in an IPR Disclosure\n   A. Since IPR disclosures\
    \ will be used by IETF working groups during\n      their evaluation of alternative\
    \ technical solutions, it is helpful\n      if an IPR disclosure includes information\
    \ about licensing of the\n      IPR in case Implementing Technologies require\
    \ a license.\n      Specifically, it is helpful to indicate whether, upon approval\
    \ by\n      the IESG for publication as an RFC of the relevant IETF\n      specification(s),\
    \ all persons will be able to obtain the right to\n      implement, use, distribute,\
    \ and exercise other rights with respect\n      to an Implementing Technology\
    \ a) under a royalty-free and\n      otherwise reasonable and non-discriminatory\
    \ license, or b) under a\n      license that contains reasonable and non-discriminatory\
    \ terms and\n      conditions, including a reasonable royalty or other payment,\
    \ or c)\n      without the need to obtain a license from the IPR holder (e.g.,\
    \ a\n      covenant not to sue with or without defensive suspension, as\n    \
    \  described in Section 7).\n   B. The inclusion of a licensing declaration is\
    \ not mandatory, but it\n      is encouraged so that the working groups will have\
    \ as much\n      information as they can during their deliberations.  If the\n\
    \      inclusion of a licensing declaration in an IPR disclosure would\n     \
    \ significantly delay its submission, then the discloser may submit\n      an\
    \ IPR disclosure without a licensing declaration and then submit\n      a new\
    \ IPR disclosure when the licensing declaration becomes\n      available.  IPR\
    \ disclosures that voluntarily provide text that\n      includes licensing information,\
    \ comments, notes, or URLs for other\n      information may also voluntarily include\
    \ details regarding\n      specific licensing terms that the IPR holder intends\
    \ to offer to\n      implementers of Implementing Technologies, including maximum\n\
    \      royalties.\n   C. It is likely that IETF will rely on licensing declarations\
    \ and\n      other information that may be contained in an IPR disclosure and\n\
    \      that implementers will make technical, legal, and commercial\n      decisions\
    \ on the basis of such commitments and information.  Thus,\n      when licensing\
    \ declarations and other information, comments,\n      notes, or URLs for further\
    \ information are contained in an IPR\n      disclosure, the persons making such\
    \ disclosure agree and\n      acknowledge that the commitments and information\
    \ contained in such\n      disclosure shall be irrevocable and will attach, to\
    \ the extent\n      permissible by law, to the associated IPR, and all implementers\
    \ of\n      Implementing Technologies will be justified and entitled to rely\n\
    \      on such materials in relating to such IPR, whether or not such IPR\n  \
    \    is subsequently transferred to a third party by the IPR holder\n      making\
    \ the commitment or providing the information.  IPR holders\n      making IPR\
    \ disclosures that contain licensing declarations or\n      providing such information,\
    \ comments, notes, or URLs for further\n      information must ensure that such\
    \ commitments are binding on any\n      transferee of the relevant IPR, and that\
    \ such transferee will use\n      reasonable efforts to ensure that such commitments\
    \ are binding on\n      a subsequent transferee of the relevant IPR, and so on.\n\
    \   D. Licensing declarations must be made by people who are authorized\n    \

- title: 7.  Evaluating Alternative Technologies in IETF Working Groups
  contents:
  - "7.  Evaluating Alternative Technologies in IETF Working Groups\n   In general,\
    \ IETF working groups prefer technologies with no known IPR\n   claims or, for\
    \ technologies with claims against them, an offer of\n   royalty-free licensing.\
    \  However, to solve a given technical problem,\n   IETF working groups have the\
    \ discretion to adopt a technology as to\n   which IPR claims have been made if\
    \ they feel that this technology is\n   superior enough to alternatives with fewer\
    \ IPR claims or free\n   licensing to outweigh the potential cost of the licenses.\
    \  To assist\n   these working groups, it is helpful for the IPR claimants to\
    \ declare,\n   in their IPR Declarations, the terms, if any, on which they are\n\
    \   willing to license their IPR Covering the relevant IETF Documents.\n   A.\
    \ When adopting new technologies, the participants in an IETF\n      working group\
    \ are expected to evaluate all the relevant tradeoffs\n      from their perspective.\
    \  Most of the time these considerations are\n      based purely on technical\
    \ excellence, but IPR considerations may\n      also affect the evaluation and\
    \ specific licensing terms may affect\n      the participants' opinion on the\
    \ desirability of adopting a\n      particular technology.\n   B. The IETF has\
    \ no official preference among different licensing\n      terms beyond what was\
    \ stated at the beginning of this section.\n      However, for information and\
    \ to assist participants in\n      understanding what license conditions may imply,\
    \ what follows are\n      some general observations about some common types of\
    \ conditions.\n      The following paragraphs are provided for information only:\n\
    \   C. When there is no commitment to license patents covering the\n      technology,\
    \ this creates uncertainty that obviously is concerning.\n      These concerns\
    \ do not exist when there is a commitment to license,\n      but the license terms\
    \ can still differ greatly.  Some common\n      conditions include 1) terms that\
    \ are fair, reasonable, and non-\n      discriminatory, and which may bear royalties\
    \ or other financial\n      obligations (FRAND or RAND); 2) royalty-free terms\
    \ that are\n      otherwise fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (RAND-z);\
    \ and\n      3) commitments not to assert declared IPR, possibly conditional on\n\
    \      reciprocity.  Open source projects, for instance, often prefer the\n  \
    \    latter two.  Note that licenses often come with complex terms that\n    \
    \  have to be evaluated in detail, and this crude classification may\n      not\
    \ be sufficient to make a proper evaluation.  For instance,\n      licenses may\
    \ also include reciprocity and defensive suspension\n      requirements that require\
    \ careful evaluation.\n   D. The level of use of a technology against which IPR\
    \ is disclosed is\n      also an important factor in weighing IPR encumbrances\
    \ and\n      associated licensing conditions against technical merits.  For\n\
    \      example, if technologies are being considered for a mandatory-to-\n   \
    \   implement change to a widely deployed protocol, the hurdle should\n      be\
    \ very high for encumbered technologies, whereas a similar hurdle\n      for a\
    \ new protocol could conceivably be lower.\n   E. IETF working groups and IETF\
    \ areas may, however, adopt stricter\n      requirements in specific cases.  For\
    \ instance, the IETF Security\n      Area has adopted stricter requirements for\
    \ some security\n      technologies.  It has become common to have a mandatory-to-\n\
    \      implement security technology in IETF technology specifications.\n    \
    \  This is to ensure that there will be at least one common security\n      technology\
    \ present in all implementations of such a specification\n      that can be used\
    \ in all cases.  This does not limit the\n      specification from including other\
    \ security technologies, the use\n      of which could be negotiated between implementations.\
    \  An IETF\n      consensus has developed that no mandatory-to-implement security\n\
    \      technology can be specified in an IETF specification unless it has\n  \
    \    no known IPR claims against it or a royalty-free license is\n      available\
    \ to implementers of the specification.  It is possible to\n      specify such\
    \ a technology in violation of this principle if there\n      is a very good reason\
    \ to do so and if that reason is documented\n      and agreed to through IETF\
    \ consensus.  This limitation does not\n      extend to other security technologies\
    \ in the same specification if\n      they are not listed as mandatory to implement.\n\
    \   F. It should also be noted that the absence of IPR disclosures at any\n  \
    \    given time is not the same thing as the knowledge that there will\n     \
    \ be no IPR disclosure in the future, or that no IPR Covers the\n      relevant\
    \ technology.  People or organizations not currently\n      involved in the IETF\
    \ or people or organizations that discover IPR\n      they feel to be relevant\
    \ in their patent portfolios can make IPR\n      disclosures at any time.\n  \
    \ G. It should be noted that the validity and enforceability of any IPR\n    \
    \  may be challenged for legitimate reasons outside the IETF.  The\n      mere\
    \ existence of an IPR disclosure should not be taken to mean\n      that the disclosed\
    \ IPR is valid or enforceable or actually Covers\n      a particular Contribution.\
    \  Although the IETF can make no actual\n      determination of validity, enforceability,\
    \ or applicability of any\n      particular IPR, it is reasonable that individuals\
    \ in a working\n      group or the IESG will take into account their own views\
    \ of the\n      validity, enforceability, or applicability of IPR in their\n \
    \     evaluation of alternative technologies.\n"
- title: 8.  Change Control for Technologies
  contents:
  - "8.  Change Control for Technologies\n   The IETF must have change control over\
    \ the technology described in\n   any Standards Track IETF Documents in order\
    \ to fix problems that may\n   be discovered or to produce other derivative works.\n\
    \   In some cases, the developer of patented or otherwise controlled\n   technology\
    \ may decide to hand over to the IETF the right to evolve\n   the technology (a.k.a.,\
    \ \"change control\").  The implementation of an\n   agreement between the IETF\
    \ and the developer of the technology can be\n   complex.  (See [RFC1790] and\
    \ [RFC2339] for examples.)\n   Note that there is no inherent prohibition against\
    \ a Standards Track\n   IETF Document making a normative reference to proprietary\
    \ technology.\n   For example, a number of IETF standards support proprietary\n\
    \   cryptographic transforms.\n"
- title: 9.  Licensing Requirements to Advance Standards Track IETF Documents
  contents:
  - "9.  Licensing Requirements to Advance Standards Track IETF Documents\n   Section\
    \ 2.2 of RFC 6410 [RFC6410] states:\n      If the technology required to implement\
    \ the specification requires\n      patented or otherwise controlled technology,\
    \ then the set of\n      implementations must demonstrate at least two independent,\n\
    \      separate and successful uses of the licensing process.\n   A key word in\
    \ this text is \"requires\".  The mere existence of\n   disclosed IPR does not\
    \ necessarily mean that licenses are actually\n   required in order to implement\
    \ the technology.\n"
- title: 10.  No IPR Disclosures in IETF Documents
  contents:
  - "10.  No IPR Disclosures in IETF Documents\n   IETF Documents must not contain\

  contents:
  - "11.  Application to Non-IETF Stream Documents\n   This document has been developed\
    \ for the benefit and use of the IETF\n   community.  As such, the rules set forth\
    \ herein apply to all\n   Contributions and IETF Documents that are in the \"\
    IETF Document\n   Stream\" as defined in Section 5.1.1 of [RFC4844] (i.e., those\
    \ that\n   are contributed, developed, edited, and published as part of the IETF\n\
    \   Standards Process).\n   The rules that apply to documents in Alternate Streams\
    \ are\n   established by the managers of those Alternate Streams (currently the\n\
    \   Internet Architecture Board (IAB), Internet Research Steering Group\n   (IRSG),\
    \ and Independent Submission Editor, as specified in\n   [RFC4844]).  These managers\
    \ may elect, through their own internal\n   processes, to cause this document\
    \ to be applied to documents\n   contributed to them for development, editing,\
    \ and publication in\n   their respective Alternate Streams.  If an Alternate\
    \ Stream manager\n   elects to adopt this document, they must do so in a manner\
    \ that is\n   public and notifies their respective document Contributors that\
    \ this\n   document applies to their respective Alternate Streams.  In such\n\
    \   case, each occurrence of the term \"Contribution\" and \"IETF Document\"\n\
    \   in this document shall be read to mean a contribution or document in\n   such\
    \ Alternate Stream, as the case may be.  It would be advisable for\n   such Alternate\
    \ Stream managers to consider adapting the definitions\n   of \"Contribution\"\
    \ and other provisions in this document to suit their\n   particular needs.\n"
- title: 12.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "12.  Security Considerations\n   This document relates to the IETF process, not\
    \ any particular\n   technology.  There are security considerations when adopting\
    \ any\n   technology, whether IPR protected or not.  A working group should\n\
    \   take those security considerations into account as one part of\n   evaluating\
    \ the technology, just as IPR is one part, but there are no\n   known issues of\
    \ security with IPR procedures.\n"

  contents:
  - "13.  Changes since RFCs 3979 and 4879\n   The material in RFC 3979 was significantly\
    \ reorganized to produce\n   this document.  This section reviews the actual changes\
    \ in content\n   since RFC 3979 and does not detail the reorganization.  These\
    \ changes\n   are listed from the point of view of this document with reference\
    \ to\n   the RFC 3979 section where useful.  This section is intended only as\n\
    \   an informational summary of the text contained in Sections 1-12 of\n   this\
    \ document.  This section does not constitute the official policy\n   of the IETF\
    \ and should not be referred to or quoted as such.  Any\n   discrepancies or ambiguities\
    \ shall be resolved in favor of the\n   language contained in Sections 1-12 of\
    \ this document.\n   Boilerplate - Since the document boilerplate formerly in\
    \ Section 5 of\n      RFC 3979 has been moved to the Trust Legal Provisions since\
    \ 2009,\n      the boilerplate requirements have been deleted from this document.\n\
    \   1 - Definitions\n      1.a - \"Alternate Stream\" definition (new): Added\
    \ to enable IRTF,\n         IAB, and Independent Submission streams to adopt and\
    \ use BCP 79\n         more easily.\n      1.c - \"Contribution\" (was 1.c)\n\
    \            Removed \"IETF\" to more easily enable other Streams to adopt\n \
    \           this policy.\n            Added \"intended to affect the IETF Standards\
    \ Process\", which\n            is needed to prevent information presentations\
    \ (e.g.,\n            plenary guest speakers) from being considered Contributions.\n\
    \            Added BOF, design team, web site, and chat room.\n            Contributions\
    \ can be made in any of these places.\n      1.e - \"Covers\" (was 1.n) - Added\
    \ \"provisional patent application\"\n         - Required to eliminate ambiguity\
    \ whether provisional\n         applications are included.\n      1.h - \"IETF\
    \ Documents\" (was 1.h) - Limited to IETF (not Alternate\n         Stream) documents.\n\
    \      1.i - \"IETF Standards Process\" (was 1.b) - Clarify that\n         Contributions\
    \ can be made in contexts other than traditional\n         IETF standards development.\n\
    \      1.j - \"IPR\" (was 1.o) - Removed reference to copyrights, database\n \
    \        rights, and data rights.  Copyright in IETF Documents and\n         contributions\
    \ is addressed under RFC 5378 and is treated very\n         differently than patents,\
    \ which are the focus of BCP 79.\n         Data/database rights not relevant to\
    \ IETF standards, and cannot\n         be registered or disclosed in the manner\
    \ of patents.\n      1.l - \"Internet-Draft\" (was 1.g) - Reduced to reference\
    \ RFC 2026\n         without additional description for clarity.\n      1.m -\
    \ \"Participating in an IETF discussion or activity\" (new) -\n         Due to\
    \ numerous ambiguities over the years, it was necessary to\n         add a section\
    \ describing what it means to \"participate\" in an\n         IETF activity.\n\
    \      1.o - \"RFC\" (was 1.e) - Added cross-reference to RFC 2026 and\n     \
    \    eliminated textual description of RFC permanence.\n   2 - Introduction -\
    \ Added text that offers an overview of why we have\n      this policy, cut prior\
    \ discussion of Section 10 of RFC 2026 as no\n      longer necessary, and added\
    \ references to subsequent RFCs relating\n      to IPR, including RFC 5378 and\
    \ 6702.\n   3 - Participation in the IETF (was \"Contributions to the IETF\")\
    \ -\n      Changed focus to participation rather than making of Contributions\n\
    \      and explained why we require IPR disclosure.\n   old 3.2.1.C - Deleted\
    \ because all required legends in IETF Documents\n      are now described in RFC\
    \ 5378 and Trust Legal Provisions.\n   3.3 - Obligations on Participants - Added\
    \ to make clear that\n      participation in IETF obligates the participant to\
    \ comply with\n      IETF rules.\n   old 4.A - Removed because inconsistent with\
    \ current and historical\n      practice.  Also, all legends in IETF Documents\
    \ are now addressed\n      in Trust Legal Provisions.\n   4.A - \"The IESG, IAB...\"\
    \ - Added IAB, ISOC, and IETF Trust to\n      disclaimer.\n   4.B - \"When the\
    \ IETF Secretariat...\" - Added description of current\n      procedure used to\
    \ publish third party IPR disclosures.\n   4.C - \"When an IPR disclosure...\"\
    \ - Updated to reflect current\n      practice and roles (e.g., Secretariat rather\
    \ than IETF Exec Dir).\n   4.D - Determination of Provision of Reasonable and\
    \ Non-discriminatory\n      Terms (was Section 4.1) - Various edits made to this\
    \ paragraph to\n      reflect current process for advancement of standards.\n\
    \   old 5 - Deleted because it was not needed.\n   5.1.1 - Contributor's IPR in\
    \ His or Her Contribution (was Section\n      6.1.1) - Limits disclosure obligation\
    \ to written Contributions\n      intended to be used as inputs to the IETF Standards\
    \ Process.  Oral\n      disclosures are now covered in Section 5.7.\n   5.1.2\
    \ - An IETF Participant's IPR in Contributions by Others (was\n      Section 6.1.2)\
    \ - Revisions made consistent with Section 5.1.1\n      above.\n   5.1.3 -  Voluntary\
    \ IPR Disclosures (was Section 6.1.3) - Fixes\n      procedures for making voluntary\
    \ IPR disclosures and adds examples\n      of when voluntary disclosures may be\
    \ appropriate.  In addition to\n      IPR of others, voluntary disclosures are\
    \ encouraged when an IETF\n      Participant is aware of its own IPR that covers\
    \ IETF work in which\n      it is not an active participant and when the technology\
    \ is\n      disclosed in other than an IETF setting.\n   5.2.1 - Timing of Disclosure\
    \ under Section 5.1.1 (was Section 6.2.1)\n      - Trigger for disclosure changed\
    \ from publication of a\n      Contribution in an I-D to \"submitted or made\"\
    ; lengthy example\n      regarding updates deleted in lieu of cross-reference\
    \ to Section\n      5.4.2 regarding updates.\n   5.2.2 - Timing of Disclosure\
    \ under Section 5.1.2 (was Section 6.2.2)\n      - Corresponding changes made\
    \ per Section 5.2.1.\n   5.2.3 - Timing of Disclosure by ADs - Added to clarify\
    \ AD disclosure\n      obligations.\n   5.3 - \"IPR disclosures and other...\"\
    \ - Reflects current practice\n      regarding prohibition of including IPR information\
    \ directly in\n      IETF Documents.\n   5.4.1 - Content of IPR Disclosures (was\
    \ Section 6.4.1) - Added\n      requirement to disclose names of inventors - Disclosing\
    \ the\n      name(s) of inventors on a patent will make it more likely that\n\
    \      IETF Participants will recognize whether the inventor is an IETF\n    \
    \  Participant and what IETF activities that individual participates\n      in.\
    \  This information is easy for the discloser to provide and\n      less convenient\
    \ for every reader of the IPR disclosure to look up\n      in patent office records\
    \ (if even available).\n   5.4.2 - Updating IPR Disclosures (was Section 6.4.2)\
    \ - Significant\n      revisions and additional detail added regarding updating\
    \ of IPR\n      disclosures upon events such as issuance of patents, amendment\
    \ of\n      claims, employee changing jobs, employer acquires another company,\n\
    \      etc.\n   5.4.2.D - Clarify that additional IPR disclosures are not needed\
    \ for\n      foreign counterparts.\n   5.4.3 - Blanket IPR Statements (was Section\
    \ 6.4.3) - wording\n      clarifications and changed \"willingness\" to \"commitment\"\
    .  A\n      blanket IPR disclosure which does not list specific patent numbers\n\
    \      is not compliant with this policy unless the discloser commits\n      (and\
    \ is not just willing) to license such patents on royalty-free\n      and otherwise\
    \ reasonable terms.\n   5.5.C - \"It is likely that IETF will rely ...\" (new\
    \ paragraph) -\n      Makes licensing declarations irrevocable so that they may\
    \ be\n      relied upon in the future by implementers.\n   5.5.D - \"Licensing\
    \ declarations ...\" (new paragraph) - Requires that\n      licensing declarations\
    \ must be made by people authorized to make\n      them.\n   5.6 - Level of Control\
    \ over IPR Requiring Disclosure (was Section\n      6.6) - In addition to ownership\
    \ of IPR, language added to require\n      disclosure when Participants derive\
    \ a pecuniary benefit from the\n      IPR, or the individual is a listed inventor\
    \ - Clarifications to\n      address situations not covered in earlier version.\n\
    \   5.7 - Disclosures for Oral Contributions (new): Describes procedure\n    \
    \  for oral Contributions.  Previously, statements regarding oral\n      statements\
    \ were contradictory.  Some places said that disclosures\n      must be made for\
    \ oral statements, but others talk about\n      disclosures only being required\
    \ following publication as an I-D.\n      Under new text, oral statements don't\
    \ trigger the normal IPR\n      disclosure obligations, as oral statements are\
    \ inherently\n      imprecise and it's hard to know when they describe something\n\
    \      covered by the technical terms of a patent claim.  However, if an\n   \
    \   oral contribution is made and it is not followed by a written\n      contribution,\
    \ then the oral discloser must either make a\n      concurrent oral IPR disclosure\
    \ or file a formal written\n      disclosure.\n   5.8 - General Disclosures (new)\
    \ - Describes the IETF's public\n      disclosure feature, which allows IPR disclosures\
    \ to be made by\n      anyone, whether or not an IETF Participant.  The feature\
    \ has been\n      up and running for years, and this language describes its current\n\
    \      implementation.\n   6 - Failure to Disclose (was Section 7) - Technical\
    \ and clarity\n      corrections, as well as new language describing potential\
    \ remedies\n      for failures to disclose IPR in accordance with IETF rules,\n\
    \      including IESG actions described in RFC 6701.\n   7 - Evaluating Alternative\
    \ Technologies in IETF Working Groups (was\n      Section 8).\n      Paragraph\
    \ 1 - Minor wording changes for clarity.\n      Paragraphs 2-5 (new) - Relate\
    \ to the considerations made by IETF\n          WGs when evaluating patent and\
    \ licensing disclosures\n         concerning IETF standards.\n      Paragraph\
    \ 6 - security technologies (new) - Makes clear that\n         security is only\
    \ one example of stricter requirements.  Also\n         requires that violation\
    \ of requirements for royalty-free\n         licensing in the security area can\
    \ be made only with IETF\n         consensus.\n      Paragraphs 7-8 (were paragraphs\
    \ 3-4) - Wording changes for\n         clarity.\n   9 - Licensing Requirements\
    \ to Advance Standards Track IETF Documents\n      (was Section 10) - Wording\
    \ updated to reflect RFC 6410.\n   10 - No IPR Disclosures in IETF Documents (was\
    \ Section 11) - Wording\n      simplified to refer to Section 5.\n   11 - Application\
    \ to Non-IETF Stream Documents (new) - Adds procedures\n      to be followed by\
    \ Alternate Stream (IAB, IRTF, Independent\n      Submission) managers to adopt\
    \ these rules and procedures.\n      Borrowed and adapted the copyright language\
    \ used in the Trust\n      Legal Provisions.  Each Alternate Stream (Independent\
    \ Submission,\n      IRTF, and IAB) would need to take some action (preferably\
    \ issuing\n      an RFC) to adopt BCP 79 for its stream.  This was done with\n\
    \      copyright already, and pretty smoothly.\n"
