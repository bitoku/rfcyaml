  - "Abstract\n   The document describes a mechanism for basic IPv6 multihoming\n\
    \   support, and its operational requirements.  Unlike currently-\n   practiced\
    \ IPv4 multihoming, the technique does not impact the\n   worldwide routing table\
    \ size, nor IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)\n   routing table size in upstream\
    \ ISPs.  The mechanism can be combined\n   with more sophisticated (or complex)\
    \ multihoming support mechanisms,\n   and can be used as a foundation for other\
    \ mechanisms.  The document\n   is largely based on RFC 2260 by Tony Bates.\n"
- title: 1.  Problem
  contents:
  - "1.  Problem\n   Routing table size has been a major issue for both IPv4 and IPv6.\
    \  As\n   IPv6 addresses are 4 times larger in bit width than IPv4, the routing\n\
    \   table size issue would have more serious negative effects on router\n   memory\
    \ usage, as well as routing table lookup performance.  To cope\n   with this problem,\
    \ the IPv6 addressing architecture [Hinden, 1998] is\n   designed to take advantage\
    \ of aggregated routing announcements to\n   reduce the number of routes in default-free\
    \ zone.  Also, 6bone\n   operation guideline [Rockell, 2000] (which is the currently-practiced\n\
    \   guideline for IPv6 network operation) suggests that ASes not announce\n  \
    \ non-aggregatable announcements to the default-free zone, if there is\n   no\
    \ special agreement with the peer.\n   In IPv4, a multihomed site uses either\
    \ of the following techniques to\n   achieve better reachability:\n   o  Obtain\
    \ a portable IPv4 address prefix, and announce it from\n      multiple upstream\
    \ providers.\n   o  Obtain a single IPv4 address prefix from ISP A, and announce\
    \ it\n      from multiple upstream providers the site is connected to.\n   Since\
    \ the above two methodologies effectively inject additional\n   routes to the\
    \ worldwide routing table, they have negative impact on\n   the worldwide routing\
    \ table size issue.  They also are not compatible\n   with current IPv6 operational\
    \ practice.\n   This document provides a way to configure site exit routers and\
    \ ISP\n   routers, so that the site can achieve better reachability from\n   multihomed\
    \ connectivity, without impacting worldwide routing table\n   size issues.  The\
    \ technique uses multiple distinct IPv6 address\n   prefixes, assigned from multiple\
    \ upstream ISPs.  The technique uses\n   an already-defined routing protocol (BGP\
    \ or RIPng) and tunneling of\n   IPv6 packets; therefore, this document introduces\
    \ no new protocol\n   standard (the document describes how to operate the configuration).\n\
    \   This document is largely based on RFC 2260 [Bates, 1998] by Tony\n   Bates.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Goals and non-goals\n   The goal of this document is to achieve better packet\
    \ delivery from a\n   site to the outside, or from the outside to the site, even\
    \ when some\n   of the site exit links are down.\n   Non goals are:\n   o  Choose\
    \ the \"best\" exit link as possible.  Note that there can be\n      no common\
    \ definition of the \"best\" exit link.\n   o  Achieve load-balancing between\
    \ multiple exit links.\n   o  Cope with breakage of any of the upstream ISPs.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Basic mechanisms\n   We use the technique described in RFC 2260 section 5.2\
    \ in our\n   configuration.  To summarize, for IPv4-only networks, RFC 2260 says\n\
    \   that:\n   o  We assume that our site is connected to 2 ISPs, ISP-A and ISP-B.\n\
    \   o  We are assigned IP address prefixes, Pref-A and Pref-B, from ISP-A\n  \
    \    and ISP-B respectively.  Hosts near ISP-A will get an address from\n    \
    \  Pref-A, and vice versa.\n   o  In the site, we locally exchange routes for\
    \ Pref-A and Pref-B, so\n      that hosts in the site can communicate with each\
    \ other without\n      using external link.\n   o  ISP-A and our site are connected\
    \ by a \"primary link\" between ISP\n      router ISP-BR-A and our router E-BR-A.\
    \  ISP B and our site are\n      connected by a primary link between ISP router\
    \ ISP-BR-B and our\n      router E-BR-B.\n           (ISP A)                 \

    \  The secondary link usually is an\n      IP-over-IP tunnel.  It is important\
    \ to have the secondary link on\n      top of a different medium than the primary\
    \ link, so that one of\n      them survives link failure.  For example, the secondary\
    \ link\n      between ISP-BR-A and E-BR-B should go through a different medium\n\
    \      than the primary link between ISP-BR-A and E-BR-A.  If the\n      secondary\
    \ link is an IPv4-over-IPv4 tunnel, the tunnel endpoint at\n      E-BR-A needs\
    \ to be an address in Pref-A, not in Pref-B (tunneled\n      packet needs to travel\

    \   o  For outbound packets, ISP-BR-A will advertise (1) default route\n     \
    \ (or specific routes) toward E-BR-A with strong preference over the\n      primary\
    \ link, and (2) default route (or specific routes) toward\n      E-BR-B with weak\

    \ routing\n   announcement to the outside of the site.  This meets the suggestions\n\
    \   in 6bone aggregation guidelines [Rockell, 2000].  Also, RFC 2260 does\n  \

- title: 4.2.  Address assignment to the nodes
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Address assignment to the nodes\n   In IPv4, it is usually assumed that\
    \ a node will be assigned a single\n   IPv4 address.  Therefore, RFC 2260 assumed\
    \ that addresses from Pref-A\n   will be assigned to nodes near E-BR-A, and vice\
    \ versa (second bullet\n   in the previous section).\n   With IPv6, multiple IPv6\
    \ addresses can be assigned to a node.  So we\n   can assign (1) one address from\
    \ Pref-A, (2) one address from Pref-B,\n   or (3) addresses from both prefixes,\
    \ to a single node in the site.\n   This will allow more flexibility in node configuration.\n\
    \   When multiple IPv6 global addresses are assigned to an IPv6 node,\n   source\
    \ address selection must take place on packet transmissions.\n   Source address\
    \ selection itself is out of scope of the document.\n   Refer to a separate draft\
    \ [Draves, 2001] for more discussions.\n   One simplifying approach is to place\
    \ the site's Internet hosts on\n   separate subnets, one with addresses in Pref-A\
    \ and connected to E-\n   BR-A, the other having addresses in Pref-B and connected\
    \ to E-BR-B.\n   This approach generalizes to having E-BR-A and E-BR-B at different\n\
    \   sites, where site A and site B have links to the Internet and to each\n  \
    \ other.\n"

    \ 6to4 [Carpenter,\n   2000] IPv6-over-IPv4 encapsulation, or some others.\n \
    \  If tunnel-based connectivity is used in some of primary links,\n   administrators\
    \ may want to avoid IPv6-over-IPv6 tunnels for secondary\n   links.  For example,\
    \ if:\n   o  primary links to ISP-A and ISP-B are RFC 2893 IPv6-over-IPv4\n  \
    \    tunnels, and\n   o  ISP-A, ISP-B and the site have IPv4 connectivity with\

    \ this case, IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel should be used for secondary\n   link.  IPv6-over-IPv4\
    \ configuration has a big advantage against\n   IPv6-over-IPv6-over-IPv4 configuration,\

- title: 5.  Issues with ingress filters in ISP
  contents:
  - "5.  Issues with ingress filters in ISP\n   If the upstream ISP imposes ingress\
    \ filters [Ferguson, 1998] to\n   outbound traffic, the story becomes much more\
    \ complex.  A packet with\n   source address taken from Pref-A must go out from\
    \ ISP-BR-A.\n   Similarly, a packet with source address taken from Pref-B must\
    \ go out\n   from ISP-BR-B.  Since none of the routers in the site network will\n\
    \   route packets based on source address, packets can easily be routed\n   to\
    \ incorrect border router.\n   One possible way is to negotiate with both ISPs,\
    \ to allow both Pref-B\n   and Pref-A to be used as source address.  This approach\
    \ does not work\n   if upstream ISP of ISP-A imposes ingress filtering.  Since\
    \ there will\n   be multiple levels of ISP on top of ISP-A, it will be hard to\n\
    \   understand which upstream ISP imposes the filter.  In reality, this\n   problem\
    \ will be very rare, as ingress filter is not suitable for use\n   in large ISPs\
    \ where smaller ISPs are connected beneath.\n   Another possibility is to use\
    \ source-based routing at E-BR-A and E-\n   BR-B.  Here we assume that IPv6-over-IPv6\
    \ tunnel is used for\n   secondary links.  When an outbound packet arrives to\
    \ E-BR-A with\n   source address in Pref-B, E-BR-A will forward it to the secondary\n\
    \   link (tunnel to ISP-BR-B) based on source-based routing decision.\n   The\
    \ packet will look like this:\n   o  Outer IPv6 header: source = address of E-BR-A\
    \ in Pref-A, dest =\n      ISP-BR-B\n   o  Inner IPv6 header: source = address\
    \ in Pref-B, dest = final dest\n   A tunneled packet will travel across ISP-BR-A\
    \ toward ISP-BR-B.  The\n   packet can go through ingress filter at ISP-BR-A,\
    \ since it has outer\n   IPv6 source address in Pref-A.  The packet will reach\
    \ ISP-BR-B and be\n   decapsulated before ingress filter is applied.  Decapsulated\
    \ packet\n   can go through ingress filter at ISP-BR-B, since it now has source\n\
    \   address in Pref-B (from inner IPv6 header).  Notice the following\n   facts\
    \ when configuring this:\n   o  Not every router implements source-based routing.\n\
    \   o  The interaction between normal routing and source-based routing at\n  \
    \    E-BR-A (and/or E-BR-B) varies by router implementations.\n   o  At ISP-BR-B\
    \ (and/or ISP-BR-A), the interaction between tunnel\n      egress processing and\
    \ filtering rules varies by router\n      implementations and filter configurations.\n"
- title: 6.  Observations
  contents:
  - "6.  Observations\n   The document discussed the cases where a site has two upstream\
    \ ISPs.\n   The document can easily be extended to the cases where there are 3\
    \ or\n   more upstream ISPs.\n   If you have many upstream providers, you would\
    \ not make all ISPs\n   backup each other, as it requires O(N^2) tunnels for N\
    \ ISPs.  Rather,\n   it is better to make N/2 pairs of ISPs, and let each pair\
    \ of ISPs\n   backup each other.  It is important to pick pairs which are unlikely\n\
    \   to be down simultaneously.  In this way, number of tunnels will be\n   O(N).\n\
    \   Suppose that the site is very large and it has ISP links in very\n   distant\
    \ locations, such as in the United States and in Japan.  In\n   such a case, it\
    \ is wiser to use this technique only among ISP links\n   in the US, and only\
    \ among ISP links in Japan.  If you use this\n   technique between ISP link A\
    \ in the US and ISP link B in Japan, the\n   secondary link makes packets travel\
    \ a very long path, for example,\n   from a host in the site in the US, to E-BR-B\
    \ in Japan, to ISP-BR-B\n   (again in Japan), and then to the final destination\
    \ in the US.  This\n   may not make sense for actual use, due to excessive delay.\n\
    \   Similarly, in a large site, addresses must be assigned to end nodes\n   with\
    \ great care, to minimize delays due to extra path packets may\n   travel.  It\
    \ may be wiser to avoid assigning an address in a prefix\n   assigned from Japanese\
    \ ISP, to an end node in the US.\n   If one of the primary links is down for a\
    \ long time, administrators\n   may want to control source address selection on\
    \ end hosts so that\n   secondary link is less likely to be used.  This can be\
    \ achieved by\n   marking the unwanted prefix as deprecated.  Suppose the primary\
    \ link\n   toward ISP-A has been down.  You will issue router advertisement\n\
    \   [Thomson, 1998; Narten, 1998] packets from routers, with preferred\n   lifetime\
    \ set to 0 in prefix information option for Pref-A.  End hosts\n   will consider\
    \ addresses in Pref-A as deprecated, and will not use any\n   of them as source\
    \ address for future connections.  If an end host in\n   the site makes a new\
    \ connection to outside, the host will use an\n   address in Pref-B as source\
    \ address, and the reply packet to the end\n   host will travel the primary link\
    \ from ISP-BR-B toward E-BR-B.  A\n   great care must be taken when you try to\
    \ automate this by using\n   router renumbering protocols [Crawford, 2000] , as\
    \ the approach could\n   lead your site into very unstable state if any of the\
    \ links flap.\n   The author does not recommend to automate it.\n   Some of non-goals\
    \ (such as \"best\" exit link selection) can be\n   achieved by combining the\
    \ technique described in this document, with\n   some other techniques.  One example\
    \ of the technique would be the\n   source/destination address selection [Draves,\
    \ 2001] on the end nodes.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Operational experiences\n   Hal Snyder has been running the technique, with\
    \ two upstream ISPs\n   (lava.net and iijlab), using 2 RFC 2893 IPv6-over-IPv4\
    \ tunnels to\n   each of them (in total 4 tunnels), and BGP4+ peering over them.\n\
    \   As expected, when the primary links goes down the routing switches to\n  \
    \ the secondary link within BGP hold time, i.e., we see approximately\n   the\
    \ relations:\n   o  (hold time - keepalive time) < failover time\n   o  failover\
    \ time < hold time\n   o  failback time < keepalive time\n   This has been tested\
    \ with keepalive and hold times from as low as 3\n   and 10 seconds respectively,\
    \ up to 60 and 180 seconds respectively.\n   The routing change will affect ISP-BR-A\
    \ (or B) only.  Because route\n   instability is not propagated beyond one ISP,\
    \ it should be feasible\n   to use lower hold and keepalive times than in a conventional\
    \ IPv4\n   setting.  If primary and backup links terminate on the same router\
    \ at\n   the ISP, then failover from primary to backup link need not affect\n\
    \   reachability information upstream of that router.\n   Many of the existing\
    \ IPv6 networks (connected to worldwide 6bone) are\n   assigned multiple IPv6\
    \ prefixes from multiple upstreams.  In many\n   cases people assign global IPv6\
