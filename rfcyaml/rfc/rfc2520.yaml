  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an extension to NHRP [1] which would allow\n\
    \   Mobile NHCs to perform a registration with and attach to an NHS in\n   their\
    \ home LIS in an authenticated manner.\n   As described in this document, Mobile\
    \ NHCs are NHCs which are not\n   configured with enough information to find a\
    \ specific serving NHS in\n   their home LIS, but which have a mechanism to find\
    \ an NHS (which may\n   or may not be a serving NHS) to which they will attach.\
    \  As described\n   in [1], an NHC may attach to a 'surrogate' NHS by using a\
    \ mechanism\n   such as an anycast address.  In this case, the NHC may use the\n\
    \   surrogate NHS to send a NHRP Registration Request toward the NHC's\n   home\
    \ LIS where a serving NHS resides.  However, as defined in [1],\n   packet authentication\
    \ is performed on a hop by hop basis.  In the\n   mobile NHC case, it is not practical\
    \ for the mobile NHC be in a\n   security relationship with every surrogate NHS,\
    \ thus it is presumably\n   desirable to have some form of end to end only authentication\
    \ for the\n   case of a mobile NHC's registration.  This document describes an\n\
    \   authentication extension for NHRP which has such end to end only\n   semantics.\n"

- title: 2.0 Definition of the NHRP Mobile NHC Authentication Extension
  contents:
  - "2.0 Definition of the NHRP Mobile NHC Authentication Extension\n    Compulsory\
    \ = 1\n    Type = 10 (proposed)\n    Length = variable\n   The NHRP Mobile NHC\
    \ Authentication Extension is carried in NHRP\n   Registration packets to convey\
    \ end to end authentication Information.\n   This extension is defined in contrast\
    \ to the NHRP Authentication\n   Extension defined in [1] which has hop by hop\
    \ semantics.\n   This new extension is used when a mobile NHC initially connects\
    \ to an\n   NHS which is not one of its serving NHSs and the mobile NHC and\n\
    \   nonserving NHS are not in a security relationship.  The mobile NHC\n   does\
    \ this in order to send an NHRP Registration Request, via normal\n   routing and\
    \ forwarding processes, to one of its serving NHSs with\n   which it does have\
    \ a security relationship.  As defined in [1], a\n   serving NHS is an NHS in\
    \ the NHC's home LIS with which the NHC will\n   register.  Upon receiving such\
    \ an NHRP Registration Request, the\n   serving NHS will do the following: authenticate\
    \ the sender NHC, set\n   up a VC to the NHC, and then send an NHRP Resolution\
    \ Reply in\n   response on that new VC.\n   Note that, as defined in [1], a transit\
    \ NHS (such as the one to which\n   the mobile NHC initially connects) must ignore\
    \ an extension which it\n   does not understand and that an NHS must not change\
    \ the order of\n   extensions in an NHRP packet. Thus, the end to end semantics\
    \ of this\n   extension are preserved without causing changes to existing\n  \
    \ implementations.\n   If a serving NHS receives a packet which fails the hop\
    \ by hop\n   authentication test defined in [1] then the NHS MUST generate an\n\
    \   Error Indication of type 'Authentication Failure' and discard the\n   packet.\
    \  However in the case where the NHRP Mobile NHC Authentication\n   Extension\
    \ is used as described above, sending an Error Indication is\n   not possible\
    \ since no route exists back toward the mobile NHC\n   assuming a VC does not\
    \ already exist between the mobile NHC and the\n   serving NHS which received\
    \ the NHRP Registration Request. In this\n   case, the NHRP Registration Request\
    \ is merely dropped.\n"

    \   Security Parameter Index (SPI) can be thought of as an index into a\n   table\
    \ that maintains the keys and other information such as a hash\n   algorithm.\
    \ Src and Dst communicate either offline using manual keying\n   or online using\
    \ a key management protocol to populate this table. The\n   sending NHRP entity\
    \ always allocates the SPI and the parameters\n   associated with it.\n   The\
    \ Src Addr field is a variable length field which contains the\n   address assigned\
    \ to the outgoing interface. The length of the field\n   is obtained from the\
    \ source protocol length field in the mandatory\n   part of the NHRP header. \
    \ The tuple <spi, src addr> uniquely\n   identifies the key and the other parameters\
    \ that are used in\n   authentication.\n   The length of the authentication data\
    \ field is dependent on the hash\n   algorithm used. The Authentication Data field\
    \ contains the keyed hash\n   calculated over the following fields: fixed part\
    \ (with hop count,\n   packet size and checksum being treated as if set to zero),\
    \ mandatory\n   part, and extensions up to and including the Mobile NHC\n   Authentication\
    \ extension.\n   Note that [1] defines an explicit ordering of extensions such\
    \ that:\n     (a) If the Responder Address extension exists then it must appear\n\
    \         before the Authentication Extension.\n     (b) Any extensions that may\
    \ be modified in transit (e.g., Forward\n         Transit Extension, Hop by Hop\
    \ Authentication Extension) must\n         appear after the Mobile NHC Authentication\
    \ Extension.\n"
- title: 2.2 SPI and Security Parameters Negotiation
  contents:
  - "2.2 SPI and Security Parameters Negotiation\n   SPI's can be negotiated either\
    \ manually or using an Internet Key\n   Management protocol. Manual keying MUST\
    \ be supported. The following\n   parameters are associated with the tuple <SPI,\
    \ src>- lifetime,\n   Algorithm, Key. Lifetime indicates the duration in seconds\
    \ for which\n   the key is valid. In case of manual keying, this duration can\
    \ be\n   infinite. Also, in order to better support manual keying, there may\n\
    \   be multiple tuples active at the same time (Dst being the same).\n   Algorithm\
    \ specifies the hash algorithm agreed upon by the two\n   entities. HMAC-MD5-128\
    \ [2] is the default algorithm and MUST be\n   implemented. Other algorithms MAY\
    \ be supported by defining new\n   values.  IANA will assign the numbers to identify\
    \ the algorithm being\n   used as described in [1].\n   Any Internet standard\
    \ key management protocol MAY so be used to\n   negotiate the SPI and parameters.\n"
- title: 2.3 Message Processing
  contents:
  - "2.3 Message Processing\n   Unauthenticated 'Mobile' Registration Request processing\
    \ proceeds as\n   follows [1]:\n      - the NHC inserts the internetwork address\
    \ of a serving NHS in the\n        'Destination  Protocol Address' field; If the\
    \ NHS address is\n        unknown, then the NHC inserts its own internetwork address.\
    \  A '\n        responder address' extension is optionally added.\n      - the\
    \ non-serving NHS forwards the packet along the routed path\n        based on\
    \ the contents of the 'Destination Protocol Address'\n        field.\n      -\
    \ the serving NHS which receives the NHRP Registration Request\n        will set\
    \ up a direct VCC to NHC after authenticating the request\n      - the serving\
    \ NHS will then send the NHRP Registration Reply back\n        to the NHC on that\
    \ new VCC.  Note that the NHS MUST wait some\n        configured interval before\
    \ doing this reply in order to prevent\n        a race condition from occurring\
    \ between the VC setup and sending\n        the NHRP reply packet.\n      - the\
    \ NHC will subsequently send all NHRP traffic to the serving\n        NHS on the\
    \ direct VCC.\n   When the NHC adds the authentication extension header, it performs\
    \ a\n   table look up in order to fetch the SPI and the security parameters\n\
    \   based on the outgoing interface address. If there are no entries in\n   the\
    \ table and if there is support for key management, the NHC\n   initiates the\
    \ key management protocol to fetch the necessary\n   parameters. The NHC constructs\
    \ the Authentication Extension payload\n   and calculates the hash by zeroing\
    \ out the authentication data field.\n   The result is placed in the authentication\
    \ data field. The src\n   address field in the payload is the internetwork address\
    \ assigned to\n   the outgoing interface.\n   If key management is not supported\
    \ and authentication is mandatory,\n   the packet is dropped and this information\
    \ is logged.\n   On the receiving end, the serving NHS fetches the parameters\
    \ based on\n   the SPI and the internetwork address in the authentication extension\n\
    \   payload. The authentication data field is extracted before being\n   zeroed\
    \ out in order to calculate the hash. It computes the hash on\n   the entire payload\
    \ and if the hash does not match, then an \"abnormal\n   event\" has occurred.\n\
    \   The keys used by the mobile NHC for communicating with the serving\n   NHS\
    \ in NHRP Registration Requests can be used in subsequent\n   resolution and purge\
    \ requests made directly to the serving NHS after\n   receiving the NHRP Registration\
    \ Reply.  However, the authentication\n   extension defined in [1] MUST be used\
    \ when these keys are applied to\n   resolution and purge packets.\n   Hop by\
    \ Hop Authentication[1] and End to End authentication MAY be\n   used in combination\
    \ to provide protection against both spoofing and\n   denial of service attacks.\
    \  If only an end-to-end Mobile NHC\n   Authentication Extension is present, it\
    \ MAY be the policy of each\n   transit NHS to reject the NHRP Registration Request\
    \ based on the\n   requirement for having a Hop by Hop authentication present.\
    \  Such a\n   requirement is a local matter.\n"
- title: 2.4 Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.4 Security Considerations\n   It is important that the keys chosen are strong\
    \ since the security of\n   the entire system depends on the keys being chosen\
    \ properly.\n   End-to-end authentication counters spoofing attacks on the home\n\
    \   subnet through not relying on the potentially compromised chain of\n   trust.\
    \ The use of end-end authentication is further described in [3].\n   Hop-by-hop\
    \ authentication prevents denial of service attacks by\n   introducing access\
    \ control at the first point of contact to the NHRP\n   infrastructure.\n   The\
    \ security of this extension is performed on an end to end basis.\n   The data\
    \ received can be trusted only so much as one trusts the end\n   point entities\
    \ in the path traversed. A chain of trust is established\n   amongst NHRP entities\
    \ in the path of the NHRP Message. If the\n   security in an NHRP entity is compromised,\
    \ then security in the\n   entire NHRP domain is compromised.\n   Data integrity\
    \ covers the entire NHRP payload up to and including the\n   Mobile NHC Authentication\
    \ Extension. This guarantees that the data\n   and extensions covered by this\
    \ authentication hash were not modified\n   and that the source is authenticated\
    \ as well. If the authentication\n   extension is not used or if the security\
    \ is compromised, then NHRP\n   entities are liable to both spoofing attacks,\
    \ active attacks, and\n   passive attacks.\n   There is no mechanism to encrypt\
    \ the messages. It is assumed that a\n   standard layer 3 confidentiality mechanism\
    \ will be used to encrypt\n   and decrypt messages.  It is recommended to use\
    \ an Internet standard\n   key management protocol to negotiate the keys between\
    \ the neighbors.\n   Transmitting the keys in clear text, if other methods of\
    \ negotiation\n   is used, compromises the security completely.\n"
