  - "Discussion\n   Declaring that the address is the message, the IPng WG has selected\
    \ a\n   packet format which includes 1696 bytes of address space.  This\n   length\
    \ is a multiple of 53 and is completely compatible with ATM\n   architecture.\
    \  Observing that it's not what you know but who you\n   know, the IPng focused\
    \ on choosing an addressing scheme that makes it\n   possible to talk to everyone\
    \ while dispensing with the irrelevant\n   overhead of actually having to say\
    \ anything.\n   Security experts hailed this as a major breakthrough.  With no\n\
    \   content left in the packets, all questions of confidentiality and\n   integrity\
    \ are moot.  Intelligence and law enforcement agencies\n   immediately refocused\
    \ their efforts to detect who's talking to whom,\n   and are silently thankful\
    \ they can avoid divisive public debate about\n   key escrow, export control and\
    \ related matters.\n   Although the IPng WG declared there should be more than\
    \ enough\n   address space for everyone, service providers immediately began vying\n\
    \   for reserved portions of the address space.\n"
