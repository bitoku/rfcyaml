- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #5 [RFC2898]\
    \ Password-\n   Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) is used by several protocols\n\
    \   to derive encryption keys from a password.\n   For example, Salted Challenge\
    \ Response Authentication Mechanism\n   (SCRAM) [RFC5802] uses PBKDF2 with Hash-based\
    \ Message Authentication\n   Code (HMAC) [RFC2104] and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)\n\
    \   [FIPS.180-1.1995].\n   Test vectors for the algorithm were not included in\
    \ the original\n   specification, but are often useful for implementers.  This\
    \ document\n   addresses the shortcoming.\n"
