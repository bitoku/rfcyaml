- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RSVP [RFC 2205] is a unicast and multicast signalling protocol,\n\
    \   designed to install and maintain reservation state information at\n   each\
    \ router along the path of a stream of data.  The state handled by\n   RSVP is\
    \ defined by services [RFC 2211] and [RFC 2212] specified by\n   the Integrated\
    \ Services WG.  These services and RSVP are being\n   introduced to the IETF's\
    \ standards track jointly.  From henceforth,\n   the acronym RSVP on its own is\
    \ used as a shorthand for the signalling\n   protocol combined with the integrated\
    \ service specifications.\n   RSVP must be used in conjunction with several additional\
    \ components,\n   described in Table 1.\n          Table 1  Additional Components\
    \ of Resource Reservation\n   1. Message formats in which parameters for desired\
    \ services can be\n      expressed. A proposed standard set of these formats is\
    \ specified\n      in [RFC 2210].\n   2. Router and host mechanisms (e.g. packet\
    \ classification and\n      scheduling, admission control algorithms) to implement\
    \ one or\n      both of the models [RFC 2211] and [RFC 2212], which are also\n\
    \      in the standards track.\n   3. Message formats in which parameters for\
    \ desired policies for\n      admission control and resource use can be expressed.\
    \  A small\n      common subset of these formats for standards track is in the\n\
    \      RSVP WG's charter.  The Policy objects in the RSVP Protocol\n      Specification\
    \ are optional only at this time.\n   4. Diversely located mechanisms implementing\
    \ desired admission\n      control policy functions, including authorization and\
    \ other\n      security mechanisms.\n   In the presence of some form of each component\
    \ in Table 1, RSVP-\n   enabled applications can achieve differentiated qualities\
    \ of service\n   across IP networks.  Networked multimedia applications, many\
    \ of which\n   require (or will benefit from) a predictable end-user experience,\
    \ are\n   likely to be initial users of RSVP-signalled services.\n   Because RSVP\
    \ and the integrated services and other components listed\n   in Table 1 mark\
    \ a significant change to the service model of IP\n   networks, RSVP has received\
    \ considerable interest and press in\n   advance of its release as a standards\
    \ track RFC.  At present, many\n   vendors of operating systems and routers are\
    \ incorporating RSVP and\n   integrated services into their products for near-future\
    \ availability.\n   The goal of this applicability statement is to describe those\
    \ uses of\n   the current RSVP specification that are known to be feasible, and\
    \ to\n   identify areas of limitation and ongoing chartered work addressing\n\
    \   some of these limitations.\n"
- title: 2.  Issues Affecting Deployment of RSVP
  contents:
  - "2.  Issues Affecting Deployment of RSVP\n   Wide scale deployment of RSVP must\
    \ be approached with care, as there\n   remains a number of outstanding issues\
    \ that may affect the success of\n   deployment.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Scalability
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Scalability\n   The resource requirements (processing and storage) for\
    \ running RSVP\n   on a router increase proportionally with the number of separate\n\
    \   sessions (i.e., RSVP reservations).  Thus, supporting numerous small\n   reservations\
    \ on a high-bandwidth link may easily overly tax the\n   routers and is inadvisable.\
    \  Furthermore, implementing the packet\n   classification and scheduling capabilities\
    \ currently used to provide\n   differentiated services for reserved flows may\
    \ be very difficult for\n   some router products or on some of their high-speed\
    \ interfaces (e.g.\n   OC-3 and above).\n   These scaling issues imply that it\
    \ will generally not be appropriate\n   to deploy RSVP on high-bandwidth backbones\
    \ at the present time.\n   Looking forward, the operators of such backbones will\
    \ probably not\n   choose to naively implement RSVP for each separate stream.\
    \  Rather,\n   techniques are being developed that will, at the \"edge\" of the\n\
    \   backbone, aggregate together the streams that require special\n   treatment.\
    \  Within the backbone, various less costly approaches would\n   then be used\
    \ to set aside resources for the aggregate as a whole, as\n   a way of meeting\
    \ end-to-end requirements of individual flows.\n   In the near term, various vendors\
    \ are likely to use diverse\n   approaches to the aggregation of reservations.\
    \  There is not\n   currently chartered work in the IETF for development of standards\
    \ in\n   this space. A BOF, Future Directions of Differential Services, on\n \
    \  April 7, 1997, at the Memphis IETF, is to consider the IETF's next\n   steps\
    \ on this, among other issues.  Public documentation of\n   aggregation techniques\
    \ and experience is encouraged.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Security Considerations\n   The RSVP WG submission for Proposed Standard\
    \ includes two security-\n   related documents [Baker96, RFC 2207]. [Baker96]\
    \ addresses denial and\n   hijacking or theft of service attacks.  [RFC 2207]\
    \ addresses RSVP\n   mechanisms for data flows that themselves use IPSEC.\n  \
    \ The first document is proposed to protect against spoofed reservation\n   requests\
    \ arriving at RSVP routers; such requests might be used to\n   obtain service\
    \ to unauthorized parties or to lock up network\n   resources in a denial of service\
    \ attack.  Modified and spoofed\n   reservation requests are detected by use of\
    \ hop-by-hop MD5 checksums\n   (in an Integrity Object) between RSVP neighbor\
    \ routers.  As\n   described, RSVP hop-by-hop authentication assumes that key\
    \ management\n   and distribution for routers is resolved and deployed.  Until\
    \ an\n   effective key infrastructure is in place, manually keyed session\n  \
    \ integrity might be used.  In addition, [Baker96] may be updated with\n   RFC\
    \ 2085.\n   That RSVP needs an effective key infrastructure among routers is not\n\
    \   unique to RSVP: it is widely acknowledged that there are numerous\n   denial\
    \ of service attacks on the routing infrastructure (quite\n   independent of RSVP)\
    \ that will only be resolved by deployment of a\n   key infrastructure.\n   Theft\
    \ of service risks will require the user to deploy with caution.\n   An elementary\
    \ precaution is to configure management logging of new\n   and changed filter\
    \ specifications in RSVP-enabled infrastructure,\n   e.g. the newFlow trap [RFC\
    \ 2206].\n   The Integrity object defined by [Baker96] may also play a role in\n\
    \   policy control, as will be described in 2.3.\n   The second security-related\
    \ document provides a mechanism for\n   carrying flows in which the transport\
    \ and user octets have been\n   encrypted (RFC 1827).  Although such encryption\
    \ is highly beneficial\n   to certain applications, it is not relevant to the\
    \ functional\n   security of RSVP or reservations.\n   The following section on\
    \ Policy Control includes additional\n   discussion of RSVP authorization security.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Policy Control
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Policy Control\n   Policy control addresses the issue of who can, or cannot,\
    \ make\n   reservations once a reservation protocol can be used to set up\n  \
    \ unequal services.\n   Currently, the RSVP specification defines a mechanism\
    \ for\n   transporting policy information along with reservations.  However,\n\
    \   the specification does not define policies themselves.  At present,\n   vendors\
    \ have stated that they will use the RSVP-defined mechanism to\n   implement proprietary\
    \ policies.\n   The RSVP WG is chartered to specify a simple standardized policy\n\
    \   object and complete simple mechanisms for session use of the\n   Integrity\
    \ object in the near future.  This applicability statement\n   may be updated\
    \ at the completion of the WG's charter.\n   Before any decision to deploy RSVP,\
    \ it would be wise to ensure that\n   the policy control available from a vendor\
    \ is adequate for the\n   intended usage.  In addition to the lack of documented\
    \ policy\n   mechanisms in any of the policy areas (such as access control,\n\
    \   authorization, and accounting), the community has little experience\n   with\
    \ describing, setting and controlling policies that limit Internet\n   service.\
    \  Therefore it is likely that vendor solutions will be\n   revised often, particularly\
    \ before the IETF has developed any policy\n   specification.\n"
- title: 3.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "3.  Recommendations\n   Given the current form of the RSVP specifications, multimedia\n\
    \   applications to be run within an intranet are likely to be the first\n   to\
    \ benefit from RSVP.  SNA/DLSW is another \"application\" considered\n   likely\
    \ to benefit.  Within the single or small number of related\n   administrative\
    \ domains of an intranet, scalability, security and\n   access policy will be\
    \ more manageable than in the global Internet,\n   and risk will be more controllable.\
    \  Use of RSVP and supporting\n   components for small numbers of flows within\
    \ a single Internet\n   Service Provider is similar to an intranet use.\n   Current\
    \ experience with RSVP has been collected only from test runs\n   in limited testbeds\
    \ and intranet deployment.  We recommend that\n   people begin to use RSVP in\
    \ production intranet or limited ISP\n   environments (as mentioned above), in\
    \ which benefits can be realized\n   without having to resolve some of the issues\
    \ described in Section 2.\n   To quote RFC 2026 about the use of Proposed Standard\
    \ technology:\n     Implementors should treat Proposed Standards as immature\n\
    \     specifications.  It is desirable to implement them in order to gain\n  \
    \   experience and to validate, test, and clarify the specification.\n     However,\
    \ since the content of Proposed Standards may be changed if\n     problems are\
    \ found or better solutions are identified, deploying\n     implementations of\
    \ such standards into a disruption-sensitive\n     environment is not recommended.\n\
    \   General issues of scalability, security and policy control as\n   outlined\
    \ in Section 2 are the subjects of active research and\n   development, as are\
    \ a number of topics beyond this applicability\n   statement, such as third-party\
    \ setup of either reservations or\n   differentiated service.\n"
