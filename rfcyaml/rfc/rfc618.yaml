  - "                A Few Observations on NCP Statistics\nThe NCP in use at HARV-10,\
    \ CMU-10A, and CMU-10B collects a number of\noperating and error statistics, which\
    \ may be typed out on demand by\nany user by means of the 'IMP ERROR' command,\
    \ as shown on the sample\ntypescript.\n    The figures shown cover the period\
    \ since the system was last\n    restarted. They are not logged or recorded in\
    \ any more permanent\n    form due to extremely limited on-line storage at HARV-10.\
    \ where\n    the software was implemented. However, due to the small size of\n\
    \    the system and infrequent monitor development work, HARV-10 tends\n    to\
    \ stay up for periods approaching the interval between hardware\n    maintenance,\
    \ which is one week. The attached output was obtained\n    after 168 hours system\
    \ uptime.\nThere are a few things I would like to point out that may be of\ninterest\
    \ to NCP implementers.\nFirst, note that the number of discarded (unexpected)\
    \ RFNMs is equal\nto the number of simulated (timed out) RFNMs. This has been\
    \ the case\nalmost every time I have looked at these statistics. It suggests\n\
    that the RFNMs are not being lost but are rather delayed beyond the\nNCP timeout\
    \ interval, which I believe is 30 seconds.\n    I have heard talk among a few\
    \ people in the Network community\n    about \"lost RFNMs\", and would like to\
    \ suggest this as a possible\n    alternative explanation. Perhaps longer timeouts\
    \ are in order.\nSecond, the observed ratio of received allocates to transmitted\n\
    allocates (on the order of two to one) is also fairly typical. I\nbelieve this\
    \ reflects differences in allocation strategies among\nvarious hosts.\n    Many\
    \ hosts appear to send out an allocate for every data message\n    received. While\
    \ this is reasonable for connections such as FTP\n    data transfer connections,\
    \ it imposes considerable extra traffic\n    in the case of the single character\
    \ messages that seem to be the\n    most common on the network.\n    of allocation\"\
    \ figure to each socket (typically quite small for\n    Telnet connections and\
    \ large for FTP data connections; it is a\n    user program settable parameter).\
    \ When the actual allocation for\n    the socket falls below 50% of this level,\
    \ enough additional\n    allocation is sent to bring it up to the full \"desired\
    \ level\".\n    The effect of this strategy is to significantly reduce the number\n\
    \    of allocates returned for a given number of small messages\n    received.\
    \ This reduces both network traffic and control message\n    overhead at the other\
    \ end. The strategy has no effect on FTP data\n    messages, since each message\
    \ is usually large enough to reduce\n    outstanding allocation by at least half\
    \ at a single blow.\nFinally, I should remark on the appallingly large number\
    \ of NOPs\nreceived (typically 25% of all control messages). Most of these seem\n\
    to be piggy-backed onto other control messages, so the situation is\nnot as awful\
    \ as the figures would indicate. Nevertheless, I am\nforced to wonder why anyone\
    \ would want to send so many.\nTELNET typescript file started at THU 31 JAN 74\
