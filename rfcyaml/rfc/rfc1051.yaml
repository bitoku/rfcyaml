- title: Frame Format
  contents:
  - "Frame Format\n   IP and ARP datagrams are transmitted in standard ARCNET packets.\
    \  As\n   required by Datapoint Corporation, the first octet of the data field\n\
    \   is reserved for the network layer protocol identification (the\n   \"system\
    \ code\" in Datapoint nomenclature), and must contain the value\n   240 (F0 hex)\
    \ for IP or 241 (F1 hex) for ARP.  The ARP hardware\n   address type for ARCNET\
    \ is 7 [9].\n   ARCNET supports packet formats containing 1-253 octets of data\n\
    \   (normal format) and 257-508 octets of data (extended format),\n   inclusive\
    \ of system code.  Note that there exists a range of data\n   lengths (254-256)\
    \ which are 'forbidden'.  IP packets within this\n   range should be padded (with\
    \ octets of zero) to meet the minimum\n   extended packet size of 257 data octets.\
    \  This padding is not part of\n   the IP packet and is not included in the total\
    \ length field of the IP\n   header.\n   On networks where some hosts do not support\
    \ extended packet format,\n   the IP Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) should be\
    \ set to 253, though\n   implementors are encouraged to support the extended packet\
    \ format\n   mode of operation.\n   Because the ARCNET maximum packet length is\
    \ less than the Internet\n   default MTU, implementations are strongly encouraged\
    \ to support IP\n   level fragmentation and reassembly.  Hosts not supporting\
    \ this should\n   take steps to discourage others from sending fragmented packets,\
    \ such\n   as using the TCP Maximum Segment Size option [4].\n      The frame\
    \ format is:\n                  Normal Packet               Extended Packet\n\

  - "Address Mappings\n   The mappings between 32-bit Internet addresses to 8-bit\
    \ ARCNET\n   addresses can be done several ways, recommended are:\n   Host Number\
    \ Extraction\n      The easiest thing to do is to use the last eight bits of host\n\
    \      number part of the Internet address as the host's node id.  This\n    \
    \  has been implemented on Experimental Ethernet [5] and ProNET-10\n      [6].\n\
    \   Dynamic Discovery\n      Mappings between 32-bit Internet addresses and 8-bit\
    \ ARCNET node\n      ids could be accomplished through ARP.  Internet addresses\
    \ are\n      assigned arbitrarily on some Internet networks.  All\n      implementations\
    \ supporting ARP must have a means of disabling ARP\n      and using the above\
    \ Host Number Extraction method of address\n      mapping so that systems may\
    \ interoperate.\n      The use of ARP is optional.  However, ARP is desirable\
    \ when using\n      IP implementations that don't support subnetting [7], as in\
    \ the\n      Proxy ARP scenario [8].\n"
