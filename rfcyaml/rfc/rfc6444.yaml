- title: 1.1.  Emergency Services Architecture
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Emergency Services Architecture\n   The emergency services architecture\
    \ developed in the IETF Emergency\n   Context Resolution with Internet Technology\
    \ (ECRIT) working group,\n   see [RFC6443], describes an architecture where location\
    \ information\n   is provided by access networks to endpoints or VoIP service\
    \ providers\n   in order to determine the correct dial string and information\
    \ to\n   route the call to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).  The\n   Location-to-Service\
    \ Translation (LoST) protocol [RFC5222] allows\n   callers and other call-routing\
    \ entities to determine the PSAP Uniform\n   Resource Identifier (URI) for a specific\
    \ geographical location\n   together with a service URN [RFC5031].  The basic\
    \ architecture is\n   shown in Figure 1 of [RFC6443] and further detailed in the\
    \ message\n   flow in Figure 2 of [RFC6443].\n   For emergency services, location\
    \ information is needed for three\n   purposes:\n   1.  Emergency call routing\
    \ to the PSAP that is responsible for a\n       specific geographical region.\n\
    \   2.  Dispatch of the emergency personnel to the scene of an accident,\n   \
    \    crime, or other type of incident.\n   3.  Additionally, a Voice Service Provider\
    \ (VSP) may need to verify\n       that a call is indeed an emergency call and\
    \ may therefore require\n       location information to ensure that calls routed\
    \ to a specific\n       URI point to a PSAP.\n   This document focuses on items\
    \ (1) and (3).  Providing location\n   information by the ISP to emergency authorities,\
    \ including PSAPs,\n   regional emergency management association, and emergency\
    \ personnel is\n   typically a legal obligation covered by regulatory frameworks.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Location Hiding
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Location Hiding\n   Internet Access Providers (IAPs) and Internet Service\
    \ Providers\n   (ISPs) typically have little incentive to provide location\n \
    \  information to end hosts or independent VSPs (without monetary\n   compensation)\
    \ for any purpose, including for emergency call routing.\n   The decision to deny\
    \ disclosure of location information can be driven\n   by a number of technical\
    \ and business concerns.  Some providers may\n   perceive a risk that allowing\
    \ users to access location information\n   for non-emergency purposes or prior\
    \ to an emergency call will incur\n   additional server load and thus costs. \
    \ Other providers may not want\n   to make location information available without\
    \ the ability to charge\n   for it.  Yet, others fear problems with regard to\
    \ privacy when\n   disclosing location information to potentially unknown third\
    \ parties.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Location by Reference
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Location by Reference\n   The work on the Location Configuration Protocol\
    \ (LCP) indicated the\n   need to provide the capability to obtain Location-by-References\n\
    \   (LbyRs) in addition to Location-by-Value (LbyV) from a Location\n   Information\
    \ Server (LIS).\n   The LCP problem statement and requirements document is [RFC5687].\n\
    \   The requirements for obtaining an LbyR via the LCP and the\n   corresponding\
    \ dereferencing step can be found in [RFC5808].\n   HTTP Enabled Location Delivery\
    \ (HELD), see [RFC5985], is an\n   instantiation of the LCP concept and allows\
    \ LbyVs and LbyRs to be\n   requested.\n   A location reference may already satisfy\
    \ the requirement for location\n   hiding if the PSAP has the appropriate credentials\
    \ to resolve the\n   reference.  These credentials allow the ISP/IAP to authenticate\
    \ and\n   to authorize the party that would like to request location\n   information.\
    \  The policy to obtain these credentials allows ISPs/IAPs\n   to put constraints\
    \ under which these credentials are handed out.\n   ISPs/IAPs ideally might want\
    \ to engage in a business relationship\n   with the VSP to receive a financial\
    \ compensation for the service they\n   provide.  On the Internet, the number\
    \ of VSPs is potentially large\n   and the VSPs would not want to enter a business\
    \ contract with\n   potentially every ISP/IAP worldwide.  The number of potential\n\
    \   contracts between ISPs/IAPs and PSAPs is, however, relatively small\n   as\
    \ they typically need to have a local relationship as PSAPs provide\n   their\
    \ emergency services support in a certain geographical region for\n   which certain\
    \ ISPs/IAPs have networks deployed.\n   Note that the requirement being met here\
    \ is for delivery of location\n   information to the PSAP, not for LoST routing\
    \ or for validation at\n   the VSP.  Since LoST [RFC5222] requires location by\
    \ value, location\n   by reference cannot be used for location-based routing.\
    \  Also, LoST\n   servers may be operated by independent parties, including VSPs,\
    \ which\n   again may not be able to resolve the reference to location by value.\n\
    \   (Note that LoST is a protocol used for determining the location-\n   appropriate\
    \ PSAP based on location information and a Service URN\n   [RFC5031].)\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119],\
    \ with the\n   important qualification that, unless otherwise stated, these terms\n\
    \   apply to the design of an solution supporting location hiding, not\n   its\
    \ implementation or application.\n   This document reuses terminology from [RFC5687].\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements\n   Req-1:   There MUST be a way for the ISP/IAP to withhold\
    \ precise\n            location information from the endpoint and from the VSP.\n\
    \   Req-2:   The ISP/IAP MUST support the ability of the endpoint or the\n   \
    \         VSP to route emergency calls.\n   Req-3:   The VSP MUST be able to validate\
    \ that a call purported to be\n            an emergency call is being routed to\
    \ a bona fide URI, which\n            is denoted by being a URI in LoST for the\
    \ designated\n            emergency service.  This requirement is provided to\
    \ deal\n            with potential security problems described in Section 5.1\
    \ of\n            [RFC5069].\n   Req-4:   The PSAP MUST receive precise location\
    \ information (by\n            value) about emergency callers.  As such, any solution\
    \ MUST\n            be able to provide location information to the PSAP even\n\
    \            while withholding it from the emergency caller.\n   Req-5:   The\
    \ proposed solution MUST NOT assume a business or trust\n            relationship\
    \ between the caller's VSP and the caller's ISP.\n   Req-6:   A solution MUST\
    \ consider deployment scenarios where a VSP\n            does not operate in the\
    \ same jurisdiction as the PSAP.\n   Req-7:   The solution MUST consider that\
    \ service boundaries for the\n            various emergency services responsible\
    \ for a particular\n            location may differ.\n   Req-8:   The steps needed\
    \ by the endpoint for emergency calling\n            SHOULD be no different when\
    \ location is withheld versus when\n            location is not withheld.  In\
    \ particular, user agents cannot\n            require additional configuration\
    \ to discover in which\n            particular environment (hiding or no hiding)\
    \ they find\n            themselves.\n   Req-9:   The solution SHOULD work without\
    \ the ISP/IAP having to\n            support SIP and without the need to utilize\
    \ SIP between the\n            endpoint and the VSP.\n   Req-10:  The solution\
    \ MUST work if PSAP boundaries have holes.  (For\n            a discussion about\
    \ holes in PSAP boundaries and their\n            encoding, the reader is referred\
    \ to [RFC5964].)\n   Req-11:  The solution MUST NOT assume the existence of Emergency\n\
    \            Service Routing Proxies (ESRPs) per country, state, and\n       \
    \     city.\n   Req-12:  The solution MUST consider that service boundaries for\n\
    \            different emergency services may differ, but they overlap at\n  \
    \          the location of the caller.\n   Req-13:  Though the solution MAY add\
    \ steps to the emergency call\n            routing process described in [RFC6443],\
    \ these steps MUST NOT\n            significantly increase call setup latency.\
    \  For example, the\n            revised process MUST NOT include \"trial-and-error\"\
    \n            operations on its critical path, such as attempts at LbyR\n    \
    \        resolutions that may take time to time out.\n   Req-14:  The solution\
    \ MUST allow the end host to determine PSAP/ESRP\n            URLs prior to the\
    \ call, for all emergency services.\n   Req-15:  The solution MUST allow user\
    \ agents (UAs) to discover at\n            least their dial string ahead of the\
    \ emergency call.\n   Req-16:  The solution MUST have minimal impact on UAs, i.e.,\
    \ a\n            solution is preferred if it does not require a substantially\n\
    \            different emergency service procedure compared to the\n         \
    \   procedure of dealing with emergency services where no\n            location\
    \ hiding is applied.\n   Req-17:  The solution MUST NOT interfere with the use\
    \ of LoST for\n            non-emergency services.\n   Req-18:  The solution MUST\
    \ allow emergency calls to reach an IP-to-\n            PSTN gateway rather than\
    \ the IP-based PSAP directly.\n   Req-19:  The solution MUST NOT shift effort\
    \ (externality), i.e., the\n            convenience of the location-hiding ISP\
    \ MUST NOT impose a\n            burden on user agents or non-hiding ISPs/IAPs\
    \ and SHOULD NOT\n            impose a burden on VSPs.\n   Req-20:  The solution\
    \ SHOULD minimize the impact on LoST, SIP\n            conveyance [RFC6442], and\
    \ DHCP.\n   Req-21:  The solution SHOULD NOT break in the presence of NATs and\n\
    \            SHOULD consider the presence of legacy devices, as described\n  \
    \          in [RFC5687].\n"
