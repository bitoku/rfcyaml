- title: 1.  Background and Intent of Use
  contents:
  - "1.  Background and Intent of Use\n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\
    \ (LDAP) [RFC4510][RFC4511]\n   is a client-server protocol that typically operates\
    \ over reliable\n   octet-stream transports, such as the Transport Control Protocol\n\
    \   (TCP).  Generally, the client initiates the stream by connecting to\n   the\
    \ server's listener at some well-known address.\n   There are cases where it is\
    \ desirable for the server to initiate the\n   stream.  Although it certainly\
    \ is possible to write a technical\n   specification detailing how to implement\
    \ server-initiated LDAP\n   sessions, this would require the design of new authentication\
    \ and\n   other security mechanisms to support server-initiated LDAP sessions.\n\
    \   Instead, this document introduces an operation, the Turn operation,\n   which\
    \ may be used to reverse the client-server roles of the protocol\n   peers.  This\
    \ allows the initiating protocol peer to become the server\n   (after the reversal).\n\
    \   As an additional feature, the Turn operation may be used to allow\n   both\
    \ peers to act in both roles.  This is useful where both peers are\n   directory\
    \ servers that desire to request, as LDAP clients, that\n   operations be performed\
    \ by the other.  This may be useful in\n   replicated and/or distributed environments.\n\
    \   This operation is intended to be used between protocol peers that\n   have\
    \ established a mutual agreement, by means outside of the\n   protocol, that requires\
    \ reversal of client-server roles, or allows\n   both peers to act both as client\
    \ and server.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [X.680] with\
    \ implicit\n   tags.  The term \"BER-encoded\" means the element is to be encoded\n\
    \   using the Basic Encoding Rules [X.690] under the restrictions\n   detailed\
    \ in Section 5.1 of [RFC4511].\n"
- title: 2.  Turn Operation
  contents:
  - "2.  Turn Operation\n   The Turn operation is defined as an LDAP-Extended Operation\n\
    \   [Protocol, Section 4.12] identified by the 1.3.6.1.1.19 OID.  The\n   function\
    \ of the Turn Operation is to request that the client-server\n   roles be reversed,\
    \ or, optionally, to request that both protocol\n   peers be able to act both\
    \ as client and server in respect to the\n   other.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Turn Request
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Turn Request\n   The Turn request is an ExtendedRequest where the requestName\
    \ field\n   contains the 1.3.6.1.1.19 OID and the requestValue field is a BER-\n\
    \   encoded turnValue:\n        turnValue ::= SEQUENCE {\n             mutual\
    \         BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,\n             identifier     LDAPString\n   \
    \     }\n   A TRUE mutual field value indicates a request to allow both peers\
    \ to\n   act both as client and server.  A FALSE mutual field value indicates\n\
    \   a request to reserve the client and server roles.\n   The value of the identifier\
    \ field is a locally defined policy\n   identifier (typically associated with\
    \ a mutual agreement for which\n   this turn is be executed as part of).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Turn Response
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Turn Response\n   A Turn response is an ExtendedResponse where the responseName\
    \ and\n   responseValue fields are absent.  A resultCode of success is returned\n\
    \   if and only if the responder is willing and able to turn the session\n   as\
    \ requested.  Otherwise, a different resultCode is returned.\n"
- title: 3.  Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.  Authentication\n   This extension's authentication model assumes separate\
    \ authentication\n   of the peers in each of their roles.  A separate Bind exchange\
    \ is\n   expected between the peers in their new roles to establish identities\n\
    \   in these roles.\n   Upon completion of the Turn, the responding peer in its\
    \ new client\n   role has an anonymous association at the initiating peer in its\
    \ new\n   server role.  If the turn was mutual, the authentication association\n\
    \   of the initiating peer in its pre-existing client role is left intact\n  \
    \ at the responding peer in its pre-existing server role.  If the turn\n   was\
    \ not mutual, this association is void.\n   The responding peer may establish\
    \ its identity in its client role by\n   requesting and successfully completing\
    \ a Bind operation.\n   The remainder of this section discusses some authentication\n\
    \   scenarios.  In the protocol exchange illustrations, A refers to the\n   initiating\
    \ peer (the original client) and B refers to the responding\n   peer (the original\
    \ server).\n"

    \       A->B: Bind(success) Response\n   In this scenario, TLS is started (with\
    \ each peer providing a valid\n   certificate), and the initiating peer (the original\
    \ client)\n   establishes its identity through the use of the EXTERNAL mechanism\
    \ of\n   the SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) [RFC4422] method\n\
    \   of the Bind operation prior to the Turn.  After the turn, the\n   responding\

- title: 3.3.  Use of Mutual Authentication and SASL EXTERNAL
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Use of Mutual Authentication and SASL EXTERNAL\n   A number of SASL mechanisms,\
    \ such as GSSAPI [SASL-K5], support mutual\n   authentication.  The initiating\
    \ peer, in its new server role, may use\n   the identity of the responding peer,\
    \ established by a prior\n   authentication exchange, as its source for \"external\"\
    \ identity in\n   subsequent EXTERNAL exchange.\n       A->B: Bind(SASL(GSSAPI))\
    \ Request\n       <intermediate messages>\n       B->A: Bind(success) Response\n\

    \       B->A: Bind(SASL(EXTERNAL)) Request\n       A->B: Bind(success) Response\n\
    \   In this scenario, a GSSAPI mutual-authentication exchange is\n   completed\
    \ between the initiating peer (the original client) and the\n   responding server\
    \ (the original server) prior to the turn.  After the\n   turn, the responding\
    \ peer, in its new client role, requests that the\n   initiating peer utilize\
    \ an \"external\" identity to establish its LDAP\n   authorization identity.\n"
- title: 4.  TLS and SASL Security Layers
  contents:
  - "4.  TLS and SASL Security Layers\n   As described in [RFC4511], LDAP supports\
    \ both Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS) [RFC4346] and Simple Authentication\
    \ and Security Layer\n   (SASL) [RFC4422] security frameworks.  The following\
    \ table\n   illustrates the relationship between the LDAP message layer, SASL\n\
    \   layer, TLS layer, and transport connection within an LDAP session.\n     \
    \             +----------------------+\n                  |  LDAP message layer\
    \  |\n                  +----------------------+ > LDAP PDUs\n               \
    \   +----------------------+ < data\n                  |      SASL layer     \
    \ |\n                  +----------------------+ > SASL-protected data\n      \
    \            +----------------------+ < data\n                  |       TLS layer\
    \      |\n      Application +----------------------+ > TLS-protected data\n  \
    \    ------------+----------------------+ < data\n        Transport | transport\
    \ connection |\n                  +----------------------+\n   This extension\
    \ does not alter this relationship, nor does it remove\n   the general restriction\
    \ against multiple TLS layers, nor does it\n   remove the general restriction\
    \ against multiple SASL layers.\n   As specified in [RFC4511], the StartTLS operation\
    \ is used to initiate\n   negotiation of a TLS layer.  If a TLS is already installed,\
    \ the\n   StartTLS operation must fail.  Upon establishment of the TLS layer,\n\
    \   regardless of which peer issued the request to start TLS, the peer\n   that\
    \ initiated the LDAP session (the original client) performs the\n   \"server identity\
    \ check\", as described in Section 3.1.5 of [RFC4513],\n   treating itself as\
    \ the \"client\" and its peer as the \"server\".\n   As specified in [RFC4422],\
    \ a newly negotiated SASL security layer\n   replaces the installed SASL security\
    \ layer.  Though the client/server\n   roles in LDAP, and hence SASL, may be reversed\
    \ in subsequent\n   exchanges, only one SASL security layer may be installed at\
    \ any\n   instance.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Implementors should be aware that the reversing\
    \ of client/server\n   roles and/or allowing both peers to act as client and server\
    \ likely\n   introduces security considerations not foreseen by the authors of\n\
    \   this document.  In particular, the security implications of the\n   design\
    \ choices made in the authentication and data security models\n   for this extension\
    \ (discussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively) are\n   not fully studied.  It\
    \ is hoped that experimentation with this\n   extension will lead to better understanding\
    \ of the security\n   implications of these models and other aspects of this extension,\
    \ and\n   that appropriate considerations will be documented in a future\n   document.\
    \  The following security considerations are apparent at this\n   time.\n   Implementors\
    \ should take special care to process LDAP, SASL, TLS, and\n   other events in\
    \ the appropriate roles for the peers.  Note that while\n   the Turn reverses\
    \ the client/server roles with LDAP, and in SASL\n   authentication exchanges,\
    \ it does not reverse the roles within the\n   TLS layer or the transport connection.\n\
    \   The responding server (the original server) should restrict use of\n   this\
    \ operation to authorized clients.  Client knowledge of a valid\n   identifier\
    \ should not be the sole factor in determining authorization\n   to turn.\n  \
    \ Where the peers except to establish TLS, TLS should be started prior\n   to\
    \ the Turn and any request to authenticate via the Bind operation.\n   LDAP security\
    \ considerations [RFC4511][RFC4513] generally apply to\n   this extension.\n"
