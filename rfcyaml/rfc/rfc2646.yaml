  contents:
  - "1.  Abstract\n   Interoperability problems have been observed with erroneous\
    \ labelling\n   of paragraph text as Text/Plain, and with various forms of\n \
    \  \"embarrassing line wrap.\" (See section 3.)\n   Attempts to deploy new media\
    \ types, such as Text/Enriched [RICH] and\n   Text/HTML [HTML] have suffered from\
    \ a lack of backwards compatibility\n   and an often hostile user reaction at\
    \ the receiving end.\n   What is required is a format which is in all significant\
    \ ways\n   Text/Plain, and therefore is quite suitable for display as\n   Text/Plain,\
    \ and yet allows the sender to express to the receiver\n   which lines can be\
    \ considered a logical paragraph, and thus flowed\n   (wrapped and joined) as\
    \ appropriate.\n   This memo proposes a new parameter to be used with Text/Plain,\
    \ and,\n   in the presence of this parameter, the use of trailing whitespace to\n\
    \   indicate flowed lines.  This results in an encoding which appears as\n   normal\
    \ Text/Plain in older implementations, since it is in fact\n   normal Text/Plain.\n"

- title: 3.  The Problem
  contents:
  - "3.  The Problem\n   The Text/Plain media type is the lowest common denominator\
    \ of\n   Internet email, with lines of no more than 997 characters (by\n   convention\
    \ usually no more than 80), and where the CRLF sequence\n   represents a line\
    \ break [MIME-IMT].\n   Text/Plain is usually displayed as preformatted text,\
    \ often in a\n   fixed font.  That is, the characters start at the left margin\
    \ of the\n   display window, and advance to the right until a CRLF sequence is\n\
    \   seen, at which point a new line is started, again at the left margin.\n  \
    \ When a line length exceeds the display window, some clients will wrap\n   the\
    \ line, while others invoke a horizontal scroll bar.\n   Text which meets this\
    \ description is defined by this memo as \"fixed\".\n   Some interoperability\
    \ problems have been observed with this media\n   type:\n"
- title: 3.1.  Paragraph Text
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Paragraph Text\n   Many modern programs use a proportional-spaced font\
    \ and CRLF to\n   represent paragraph breaks.  Line breaks are \"soft\", occurring\
    \ as\n   needed on display.  That is, characters are grouped into a paragraph\n\
    \   until a CRLF sequence is seen, at which point a new paragraph is\n   started.\
    \  Each paragraph is displayed, starting at the left margin\n   (or paragraph\
    \ indent), and continuing to the right until a word is\n   encountered which does\
    \ not fit in the remaining display width.  This\n   word is displayed at the left\
    \ margin of the next line.  This\n   continues until the paragraph ends (a CRLF\
    \ is seen).  Extra vertical\n   space is left between paragraphs.\n   Text which\
    \ meets this description is defined by this memo as\n   \"flowed\".\n   Numerous\
    \ software products erroneously label this media type as\n   Text/Plain, resulting\
    \ in much user discomfort.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Embarrassing Line Wrap
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Embarrassing Line Wrap\n   As Text/Plain messages get quoted in replies\
    \ or forwarded messages,\n   the length of each line gradually increases, resulting\
    \ in\n   \"embarrassing line wrap.\" This results in text which is at best hard\n\
    \   to read, and often confuses attributions.\n      Example:\n            >>>>>>This\
    \ is a comment from the first message to show a\n            >quoting example.\n\
    \            >>>>>This is a comment from the second message to show a\n      \
    \      >quoting example.\n            >>>>This is a comment from the third message.\n\
    \            >>>This is a comment from the fourth message.\n   It can be confusing\
    \ to assign attribution to lines 2 and 4 above.\n   In addition, as devices with\
    \ display widths smaller than 80\n   characters become more popular, embarrassing\
    \ line wrap has become\n   even more prevalent, even with unquoted text.\n   Example:\n\
    \            This is paragraph text that is\n            meant to be flowed across\n\
    \            several lines.\n            However, the sending mailer is\n    \
    \        converting it to fixed text at\n            a width of 72\n         \
    \   characters, which causes it to\n            look like this when shown on a\n\
    \            PDA with only\n            30 character lines.\n"
- title: 3.3.  New Media Types
  contents:
  - "3.3.  New Media Types\n   Attempts to deploy new media types, such as Text/Enriched\
    \ [RICH] and\n   Text/HTML [HTML] have suffered from a lack of backwards compatibility\n\
    \   and an often hostile user reaction at the receiving end.\n   In particular,\
    \ Text/Enriched requires that open angle brackets (\"<\")\n   and hard line breaks\
    \ be doubled, with resulting user unhappiness when\n   viewed as Text/Plain. \
    \ Text/HTML requires even more alteration of\n   text, with a corresponding increase\
    \ in user complaints.\n   A proposal to define a new media type to explicitly\
    \ represent the\n   paragraph form suffered from a lack of interoperability with\n\
    \   currently deployed software.  Some programs treat unknown subtypes of\n  \
    \ Text as an attachment.\n   What is desired is a format which is in all significant\
    \ ways\n   Text/Plain, and therefore is quite suitable for display as\n   Text/Plain,\
    \ and yet allows the sender to express to the receiver\n   which lines can be\

- title: 4.  The Format Parameter to the Text/Plain Media Type
  contents:
  - "4.  The Format Parameter to the Text/Plain Media Type\n   This document defines\
    \ a new MIME parameter for use with Text/Plain:\n      Name:  Format\n      Value:\
    \  Fixed, Flowed\n   (Neither the parameter name nor its value are case sensitive.)\n\
    \   If not specified, a value of Fixed is assumed.  The semantics of the\n   Fixed\
    \ value are the usual associated with Text/Plain [MIME-IMT].\n   A value of Flowed\
    \ indicates that the definition of flowed text (as\n   specified in this memo)\
    \ was used on generation, and MAY be used on\n   reception.\n   This section discusses\
    \ flowed text; section 5 provides a formal\n   definition.\n   Because flowed\
    \ lines are all-but-indistinguishable from fixed lines,\n   currently deployed\
    \ software treats flowed lines as normal Text/Plain\n   (which is what they are).\
    \  Thus, no interoperability problems are\n   expected.\n   Note that this memo\
    \ describes an on-the-wire format.  It does not\n   address formats for local\
    \ file storage.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Generating Format=Flowed
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Generating Format=Flowed\n   When generating Format=Flowed text, lines\
    \ SHOULD be shorter than 80\n   characters.  As suggested values, any paragraph\
    \ longer than 79\n   characters in total length could be wrapped using lines of\
    \ 72 or\n   fewer characters.  While the specific line length used is a matter\
    \ of\n   aesthetics and preference, longer lines are more likely to require\n\
    \   rewrapping and to encounter difficulties with older mailers.  It has\n   been\
    \ suggested that 66 character lines are the most readable.\n   (The reason for\
    \ the restriction to 79 or fewer characters between\n   CRLFs on the wire is to\
    \ ensure that all lines, even when displayed by\n   a non-flowed-aware program,\
    \ will fit in a standard 80-column screen\n   without having to be wrapped.  The\
    \ limit is 79, not 80, because while\n   80 fit on a line, the last column is\
    \ often reserved for a line-wrap\n   indicator.)\n   When creating flowed text,\
    \ the generating agent wraps, that is,\n   inserts 'soft' line breaks as needed.\
    \  Soft line breaks are added\n   between words.  Because a soft line break is\
    \ a SP CRLF sequence, the\n   generating agent creates one by inserting a CRLF\
    \ after the occurance\n   of a space.\n   A generating agent SHOULD NOT insert\
    \ white space into a word (a\n   sequence of printable characters not containing\
    \ spaces).  If faced\n   with a word which exceeds 79 characters (but less than\
    \ 998\n   characters, the [SMTP] limit on line length), the agent SHOULD send\n\
    \   the word as is and exceed the 79-character limit on line length.\n   A generating\
    \ agent SHOULD:\n      1.  Ensure all lines (fixed and flowed) are 79 characters\
    \ or\n          fewer in length, counting the trailing space but not\n       \
    \   counting the CRLF, unless a word by itself exceeds 79\n          characters.\n\
    \      2.  Trim spaces before user-inserted hard line breaks.\n      3.  Space-stuff\
    \ lines which start with a space, \"From \", or\n          \">\".\n   In order\
    \ to create messages which do not require space-stuffing, and\n   are thus more\
    \ aesthetically pleasing when viewed as Format=Fixed, a\n   generating agent MAY\
    \ avoid wrapping immediately before \">\", \"From \",\n   or space.\n   (See sections\
    \ 4.4 and 4.5 for more information on space-stuffing and\n   quoting, respectively.)\n\
    \   A Format=Flowed message consists of zero or more paragraphs, each\n   containing\
    \ one or more flowed lines followed by one fixed line.  The\n   usual case is\
    \ a series of flowed text lines with blank (empty) fixed\n   lines between them.\n\
    \   Any number of fixed lines can appear between paragraphs.\n   [Quoted-Printable]\
    \ encoding SHOULD NOT be used with Format=Flowed\n   unless absolutely necessary\
    \ (for example, non-US-ASCII (8-bit)\n   characters over a strictly 7-bit transport\
    \ such as unextended SMTP).\n   In particular, a message SHOULD NOT be encoded\
    \ in Quoted-Printable\n   for the sole purpose of protecting the trailing space\
    \ on flowed lines\n   unless the body part is cryptographically signed or encrypted\
    \ (see\n   Section 4.6).\n   The intent of Format=Flowed is to allow user agents\
    \ to generate\n   flowed text which is non-obnoxious when viewed as pure, raw\n\
    \   Text/Plain (without any decoding); use of Quoted-Printable hinders\n   this\
    \ and may cause Format=Flowed to be rejected by end users.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Interpreting Format=Flowed
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Interpreting Format=Flowed\n   If the first character of a line is a quote\
    \ mark (\">\"), the line is\n   considered to be quoted (see section 4.5).  Logically,\
    \ all quote\n   marks are counted and deleted, resulting in a line with a non-zero\n\
    \   quote depth, and content. (The agent is of course free to display the\n  \
    \ content with quote marks or excerpt bars or anything else.)\n   Logically, this\
    \ test for quoted lines is done before any other tests\n   (that is, before checking\
    \ for space-stuffed and flowed).\n   If the first character of a line is a space,\
    \ the line has been\n   space-stuffed (see section 4.4).  Logically, this leading\
    \ space is\n   deleted before examining the line further (that is, before checking\n\
    \   for flowed).\n   If the line ends in one or more spaces, the line is flowed.\n\
    \   Otherwise it is fixed.  Trailing spaces are part of the line's\n   content,\
    \ but the CRLF of a soft line break is not.\n   A series of one or more flowed\
    \ lines followed by one fixed line is\n   considered a paragraph, and MAY be flowed\
    \ (wrapped and unwrapped) as\n   appropriate on display and in the construction\
    \ of new messages (see\n   section 4.5).\n   A line consisting of one or more\
    \ spaces (after deleting a stuffed\n   space) is considered a flowed line.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Usenet Signature Convention
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Usenet Signature Convention\n   There is a convention in Usenet news of\
    \ using \"-- \" as the separator\n   line between the body and the signature of\
    \ a message.  When\n   generating a Format=Flowed message containing a Usenet-style\n\
    \   separator before the signature, the separator line is sent as-is.\n   This\
    \ is a special case; an (optionally quoted) line consisting of\n   DASH DASH SP\
    \ is not considered flowed.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Space-Stuffing
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Space-Stuffing\n   In order to allow for unquoted lines which start with\
    \ \">\", and to\n   protect against systems which \"From-munge\" in-transit messages\n\
    \   (modifying any line which starts with \"From \" to \">From \"),\n   Format=Flowed\
    \ provides for space-stuffing.\n   Space-stuffing adds a single space to the start\
    \ of any line which\n   needs protection when the message is generated.  On reception,\
    \ if the\n   first character of a line is a space, it is logically deleted.  This\n\
    \   occurs after the test for a quoted line, and before the test for a\n   flowed\
    \ line.\n   On generation, any unquoted lines which start with \">\", and any\
    \ lines\n   which start with a space or \"From \" SHOULD be space-stuffed.  Other\n\
    \   lines MAY be space-stuffed as desired.\n   (Note that space-stuffing is similar\
    \ to dot-stuffing as specified in\n   [SMTP].)\n   If a space-stuffed message\
    \ is received by an agent which handles\n   Format=Flowed, the space-stuffing\
    \ is reversed and thus the message\n   appears unchanged.  An agent which is not\
    \ aware of Format=Flowed will\n   of course not undo any space-stuffing, thus\
    \ Format=Flowed messages\n   may appear with a leading space on some lines (those\
    \ which start with\n   a space, \">\" which is not a quote indicator, or \"From\
    \ \").  Since\n   lines which require space-stuffing rarely occur, and the aesthetic\n\
    \   consequences of unreversed space-stuffing are minimal, this is not\n   expected\
    \ to be a significant problem.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Quoting
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Quoting\n   In Format=Flowed, the canonical quote indicator (or quote mark)\
    \ is\n   one or more close angle bracket (\">\") characters.  Lines which start\n\
    \   with the quote indicator are considered quoted.  The number of \">\"\n   characters\
    \ at the start of the line specifies the quote depth.\n   Flowed lines which are\
    \ also quoted may require special handling on\n   display and when copied to new\
    \ messages.\n   When creating quoted flowed lines, each such line starts with\
    \ the\n   quote indicator.\n   Note that because of space-stuffing, the lines\n\
    \       >> Exit, Stage Left\n   and\n       >>Exit, Stage Left\n   are semantically\
    \ identical; both have a quote-depth of two, and a\n   content of \"Exit, Stage\
    \ Left\".\n   However, the line\n       > > Exit, Stage Left\n   is different.\
    \  It has a quote-depth of one, and a content of\n   \"> Exit, Stage Left\".\n\
    \   When generating quoted flowed lines, an agent needs to pay attention\n   to\
    \ changes in quote depth.  A sequence of quoted lines of the same\n   quote depth\
    \ SHOULD be encoded as a paragraph, with the last line\n   generated as fixed\
    \ and prior lines generated as flowed.\n   If a receiving agent wishes to reformat\
    \ flowed quoted lines (joining\n   and/or wrapping them) on display or when generating\
    \ new messages, the\n   lines SHOULD be de-quoted, reformatted, and then re-quoted.\
    \  To\n   de-quote, the number of close angle brackets in the quote indicator\n\
    \   at the start of each line is counted.  Consecutive lines with the\n   same\
    \ quoting depth are considered one paragraph and are reformatted\n   together.\
    \  To re-quote after reformatting, a quote indicator\n   containing the same number\
    \ of close angle brackets originally present\n   is prefixed to each line.\n \
    \  On reception, if a change in quoting depth occurs on a flowed line,\n   this\
    \ is an improperly formatted message.  The receiver SHOULD handle\n   this error\
    \ by using the 'quote-depth-wins' rule, which is to ignore\n   the flowed indicator\
    \ and treat the line as fixed.  That is, the\n   change in quote depth ends the\
    \ paragraph.\n   For example, consider the following sequence of lines (using\
    \ '*' to\n   indicate a soft line break, i.e., SP CRLF, and '#' to indicate a\
    \ hard\n   line break, i.e., CRLF):\n      > Thou villainous ill-breeding spongy\
    \ dizzy-eyed*\n      > reeky elf-skinned pigeon-egg!*     <--- problem ---<\n\
    \      >> Thou artless swag-bellied milk-livered*\n      >> dismal-dreaming idle-headed\
    \ scut!#\n      >>> Thou errant folly-fallen spleeny reeling-ripe*\n      >>>\
    \ unmuzzled ratsbane!#\n      >>>> Henceforth, the coding style is to be strictly*\n\
    \      >>>> enforced, including the use of only upper case.#\n      >>>>> I've\
    \ noticed a lack of adherence to the coding*\n      >>>>> styles, of late.#\n\
    \      >>>>>> Any complaints?#\n   The second line ends in a soft line break,\
    \ even though it is the last\n   line of the one-deep quote block.  The question\
    \ then arises as to how\n   this line should be interpreted, considering that\
    \ the next line is\n   the first line of the two-deep quote block.\n   The example\
    \ text above, when processed according to quote-depth wins,\n   results in the\
    \ first two lines being considered as one quoted, flowed\n   section, with a quote\
    \ depth of 1; the third and fourth lines become a\n   quoted, flowed section,\
    \ with a quote depth of 2.\n   A generating agent SHOULD NOT create this situation;\
    \ a receiving\n   agent SHOULD handle it using quote-depth wins.\n"

    \ some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very\n      earnestly.\n     \
    \ `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so I\n      can't\
    \ take more.'\n      `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very\
    \ easy\n      to take MORE than nothing.'\n   This could be encoded as follows\
    \ (using '*' to indicate a soft line\n   break, that is, SP CRLF sequence, and\
    \ '#' to indicate a hard line\n   break, that is, CRLF):\n      `Take some more\

    \ of quoting, here we have the same exchange,\n   presented as a series of direct\
    \ quotes:\n                >>>Take some more tea.#\n                >>I've had\

  contents:
  - "6.1.  Trailing White Space Corruption\n   There are systems in existence which\
    \ alter trailing whitespace on\n   messages which pass through them.  Such systems\
    \ may strip, or in\n   rarer cases, add trailing whitespace, in violation of RFC\
    \ 821 [SMTP]\n   section 4.5.2.\n   Stripping trailing whitespace has the effect\
    \ of converting flowed\n   lines to fixed lines, which results in a message no\
    \ worse than if\n   Format=Flowed had not been used.\n   Adding trailing whitespace\
    \ to a Format=Flowed message may result in a\n   malformed display or reply.\n\
    \   Since most systems which add trailing white space do so to create a\n   line\
    \ which fills an internal record format, the result is almost\n   always a line\
    \ which contains an even number of characters (counting\n   the added trailing\
    \ white space).\n   One possible avoidance, therefore, would be to define Format=Flowed\n\
    \   lines to use either one or two trailing space characters to indicate\n   a\
    \ flowed line, such that the total line length is odd.  However,\n   considering\
    \ the scarcity of such systems today, it is not worth the\n   added complexity.\n"
