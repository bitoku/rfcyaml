Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP E) for use with network management protocols.
Introduction Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP E)
[RFC7597] is a stateless, automatic tunneling mechanism for providing an IPv4 connectivity service to end users over a service provider's IPv6 network.
This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with monitoring MAP E devices.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
Structure of the MIB Module
The IF MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for managing interfaces.
Each logical interface (physical or virtual) has an ifEntry.
Tunnels are handled by creating a logical interface (ifEntry) for each tunnel.
Each MAP E tunnel endpoint also acts as a virtual interface that has a corresponding entry in the IF MIB.
Those corresponding entries are indexed by ifIndex.
The MAP E MIB is configurable on a per interface basis, so it depends on several parts (ifEntry) of the IF MIB [RFC2863].
The mapRule subtree describes managed objects used for managing the multiple mapping rules in MAP E.
According to [RFC7597], the mapping rules are divided into two categories: Basic Mapping Rule (BMR) and Forwarding Mapping Rule (FMR).
According to Section 4.1 of [RFC7598], an F flag specifies whether the rule is to be used for forwarding (FMR).
If set, this rule is used as an FMR; if not set, this rule is BMR only and MUST NOT be used for forwarding.
A BMR can also be used as an FMR for forwarding if the F flag is set.
So, the RuleType definition in the MAP E MIB (see Section 5) defines bmrAndfmr to specify this scenario.
The mapSecurityCheck subtree provides statistics for the number of invalid packets that have been identified.
[RFC7597] defines two kinds of invalid packets:  The Border Relay (BR)
will validate the received packet's source IPv6 address against the configured MAP domain rule and the destination IPv6 address against the configured BR IPv6 address.
The MAP node (Customer Edge (CE) and BR) will check that the received packet's source IPv4 address and port are in the range derived from the matching MAP rule.
The mapMIBConformance subtree provides conformance information of MIB objects.
The following MIB module imports definitions from [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC2863], and [RFC4001].

The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
So, if this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct SNMP SET operations.
Some of the objects in this MIB module may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
This includes INDEX objects with a MAX ACCESS of not accessible, and any indices from other modules exposed via AUGMENTS.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
mapRuleIPv6Prefix mapRuleIPv6PrefixLen mapRuleIPv4Prefix mapRuleIPv4PrefixLen mapRuleBRIPv6Address mapRulePSID
Some of the MIB model's objects are vulnerable because the information that they hold may be used for targeting an attack against a MAP node (CE or BR).
For example, an intruder could use the information to help deduce the customer IPv4 and IPv6 topologies and address sharing ratios in use by the ISP.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
