- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Good, up-to-date documentation of IP multicast is close\
    \ to\n   non-existent.  Particularly, this is an issue with multicast address\n\
    \   allocations (to networks and sites) and assignments (to hosts and\n   applications).\
    \  This problem is stressed by the fact that there\n   exists confusing or misleading\
    \ documentation on the subject\n   [RFC2908].  The consequence is that those who\
    \ wish to learn about IP\n   multicast and how the addressing works do not get\
    \ a clear view of the\n   current situation.\n   The aim of this document is to\
    \ provide a brief overview of multicast\n   addressing and allocation techniques.\
    \  The term \"addressing\n   architecture\" refers to the set of addressing mechanisms\
    \ and methods\n   in an informal manner.\n   It is important to note that Source-Specific\
    \ Multicast (SSM)\n   [RFC4607] does not have these addressing problems because\
    \ SSM group\n   addresses have only local significance; hence, this document focuses\n\
    \   on the Any Source Multicast (ASM) model.\n   This memo obsoletes and re-classifies\
    \ RFC 2908 to Historic, and\n   re-classifies RFCs 2776 and 2909 to Historic.\n"
- title: '1.1.  Terminology: Allocation or Assignment'
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology: Allocation or Assignment\n   Almost all multicast documents\
    \ and many other RFCs (such as DHCPv4\n   [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315]) have\
    \ used the terms \"address\n   allocation\" and \"address assignment\" interchangeably.\
    \  However, the\n   operator and address management communities use these terms\
    \ for two\n   conceptually different processes.\n   In unicast operations, address\
    \ allocations refer to leasing a large\n   block of addresses from the Internet\
    \ Assigned Numbers Authority\n   (IANA) to a Regional Internet Registry (RIR),\
    \ or from an RIR to a\n   Local Internet Registry (LIR), possibly through a National\
    \ Internet\n   Registry (NIR).  Address assignments, on the other hand, are the\n\
    \   leases of smaller address blocks or even single addresses to the end-\n  \
    \ user sites or end-users themselves.\n   Therefore, in this memo, we will separate\
    \ the two different\n   functions: \"allocation\" describes how larger blocks\
    \ of addresses are\n   obtained by the network operators, and \"assignment\" describes\
    \ how\n   applications, nodes, or sets of nodes obtain a multicast address for\n\
    \   their use.\n"
- title: 2.  Multicast Address Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.  Multicast Address Allocation\n   Multicast address allocation, i.e., how\
    \ a network operator might be\n   able to obtain a larger block of addresses,\
    \ can be handled in a\n   number of ways, as described below.\n   Note that these\
    \ are all only pertinent to ASM -- SSM requires no\n   address block allocation\
    \ because the group address has only local\n   significance (however, we discuss\
    \ the address assignment inside the\n   node in Section 3.2).\n"
- title: 2.1.  Derived Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Derived Allocation\n   Derived allocations take the unicast prefix or some\
    \ other properties\n   of the network (e.g., an autonomous system (AS) number)\
    \ to determine\n   unique multicast address allocations.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  GLOP Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  GLOP Allocation\n   GLOP address allocation [RFC3180] inserts the 16-bit\
    \ public AS number\n   in the middle of the IPv4 multicast prefix 233.0.0.0/8,\
    \ so that each\n   AS number can get a /24 worth of multicast addresses.  While\
    \ this is\n   sufficient for multicast testing or small-scale use, it might not\
    \ be\n   sufficient in all cases for extensive multicast use.\n   A minor operational\
    \ debugging issue with GLOP addresses is that the\n   connection between the AS\
    \ and the prefix is not apparent from the\n   prefix when the AS number is greater\
    \ than 255, but has to be\n   calculated (e.g., as described in [RFC3180], AS\
    \ 5662 maps to\n   233.22.30.0/24).  A usage issue is that GLOP addresses are\
    \ not tied\n   to any prefix but to routing domains, so they cannot be used or\n\
    \   calculated automatically.\n   GLOP mapping is not available with 4-byte AS\
    \ numbers [RFC4893].\n   Unicast-prefix-based allocation or an IANA allocation\
    \ from \"AD-HOC\n   Block III\" (the previous so-called \"EGLOP\" (Extended GLOP)\
    \ block)\n   could be used instead, as needed.\n   The GLOP allocation algorithm\
    \ has not been defined for IPv6 multicast\n   because the unicast-prefix-based\
    \ allocation (described below)\n   addresses the same need in a simpler fashion.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Unicast-Prefix-Based Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Unicast-Prefix-Based Allocation\n   RFC 3306 [RFC3306] describes a mechanism\
    \ that embeds up to 64 high-\n   order bits of an IPv6 unicast address in the\
    \ prefix part of the IPv6\n   multicast address, leaving at least 32 bits of group-id\
    \ space\n   available after the prefix mapping.\n   A similar IPv4 mapping is\
    \ described in [RFC6034], but it provides a\n   limited number of addresses (e.g.,\
    \ 1 per IPv4 /24 block).\n   The IPv6 unicast-prefix-based allocations are an\
    \ extremely useful way\n   to allow each network operator, even each subnet, to\
    \ obtain multicast\n   addresses easily, through an easy computation.  Further,\
    \ as the IPv6\n   multicast header also includes the scope value [RFC4291], multicast\n\
    \   groups of smaller scope can also be used with the same mapping.\n   The IPv6\
    \ Embedded Rendezvous Point (RP) technique [RFC3956], used\n   with Protocol Independent\
    \ Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), further\n   leverages the unicast-prefix-based\
    \ allocations, by embedding the\n   unicast prefix and interface identifier of\
    \ the PIM-SM RP in the\n   prefix.  This provides all the necessary information\
    \ needed to the\n   routing systems to run the group in either inter- or intra-domain\n\
    \   operation.  A difference from RFC 3306 is, however, that the hosts\n   cannot\
    \ calculate their \"multicast prefix\" automatically (as the\n   prefix depends\
    \ on the decisions of the operator setting up the RP),\n   but instead require\
    \ an assignment method.\n   All the IPv6 unicast-prefix-based allocation techniques\
    \ provide a\n   sufficient amount of multicast address space for network operators.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Administratively Scoped Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Administratively Scoped Allocation\n   Administratively scoped multicast\
    \ address allocation [RFC2365] is\n   provided by two different means: under 239.0.0.0/8\
    \ in IPv4 or by\n   4-bit encoding in the IPv6 multicast address prefix [RFC4291].\n\
    \   Since IPv6 administratively scoped allocations can be handled with\n   unicast-prefix-based\
    \ multicast addressing as described in\n   Section 2.1.2, we'll only discuss IPv4\
    \ in this section.\n   The IPv4 administratively scoped prefix 239.0.0.0/8 is\
    \ further\n   divided into Local Scope (239.255.0.0/16) and Organization Local\n\
    \   Scope (239.192.0.0/14); other parts of the administrative scopes are\n   either\
    \ reserved for expansion or undefined [RFC2365].  However,\n   RFC 2365 is ambiguous\
    \ as to whether the enterprises or the IETF are\n   allowed to expand the space.\n\
    \   Topologies that act under a single administration can easily use the\n   scoped\
    \ multicast addresses for their internal groups.  Groups that\n   need to be shared\
    \ between multiple routing domains (even if not\n   propagated through the Internet)\
    \ are more problematic and typically\n   need an assignment of a global multicast\
    \ address because their scope\n   is undefined.\n   There are a large number of\
    \ multicast applications (such as \"Norton\n   Ghost\") that are restricted either\
    \ to a link or a site, and it is\n   extremely undesirable to propagate them further\
    \ (beyond the link or\n   the site).  Typically, many such applications have been\
    \ given or have\n   hijacked a static IANA address assignment.  Given the fact\
    \ that\n   assignments to typically locally used applications come from the same\n\
    \   range as global applications, implementing proper propagation\n   limiting\
    \ is challenging.  Filtering would be easier if a separate,\n   identifiable range\
    \ would be used for such assignments in the future;\n   this is an area of further\
    \ future work.\n   There has also been work on a protocol to automatically discover\n\
    \   multicast scope zones [RFC2776], but it has never been widely\n   implemented\
    \ or deployed.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Static IANA Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Static IANA Allocation\n   In some rare cases, organizations may have been\
    \ able to obtain static\n   multicast address allocations (of up to 256 addresses)\
    \ directly from\n   IANA.  Typically, these have been meant as a block of static\n\
    \   assignments to multicast applications, as described in Section 3.4.1.\n  \
    \ If another means of obtaining addresses is available, that approach\n   is preferable.\n\
    \   Especially for those operators that only have a 32-bit AS number and\n   need\
    \ IPv4 addresses, an IANA allocation from \"AD-HOC Block III\" (the\n   previous\
    \ so-called \"EGLOP\" block) is an option [RFC5771].\n"
- title: 2.4.  Dynamic Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Dynamic Allocation\n   RFC 2908 [RFC2908] proposed three different layers\
    \ of multicast\n   address allocation and assignment, where layer 3 (inter-domain\n\
    \   allocation) and layer 2 (intra-domain allocation) could be applicable\n  \
    \ here.  The Multicast Address-Set Claim Protocol (MASC) [RFC2909] is\n   an example\
    \ of the former, and the Multicast Address Allocation\n   Protocol (AAP) [MALLOC-AAP]\
    \ (abandoned in 2000 due to lack of\n   interest and technical problems) is an\
    \ example of the latter.\n   Both of the proposed allocation protocols were quite\
    \ complex, and\n   have never been deployed or seriously implemented.\n   It can\
    \ be concluded that dynamic multicast address allocation\n   protocols provide\
    \ no benefit beyond GLOP/unicast-prefix-based\n   mechanisms and have been abandoned.\n"
- title: 3.  Multicast Address Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.  Multicast Address Assignment\n   There are a number of possible ways for\
    \ an application, node, or set\n   of nodes to learn a multicast address, as described\
    \ below.\n   Any IPv6 address assignment method should be aware of the guidelines\n\
    \   for the assignment of group-IDs for IPv6 multicast addresses\n   [RFC3307].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Derived Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Derived Assignment\n   There are significantly fewer options for derived\
    \ address assignment\n   compared to derived allocation.  Derived multicast assignment\
    \ has\n   only been specified for IPv6 link-scoped multicast [RFC4489], where\n\
    \   the EUI64 is embedded in the multicast address, providing a node with\n  \
    \ unique multicast addresses for link-local ASM communications.\n"
- title: 3.2.  SSM Assignment inside the Node
  contents:
  - "3.2.  SSM Assignment inside the Node\n   While SSM multicast addresses have only\
    \ local (to the node)\n   significance, there is still a minor issue on how to\
    \ assign the\n   addresses between the applications running on the same IP address.\n\
    \   This assignment is not considered to be a problem, because typically\n   the\
    \ addresses for these applications are selected manually or\n   statically, but\
    \ if done using an Application Programming Interface\n   (API), the API could\
    \ check that the addresses do not conflict prior\n   to assigning one.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Manually Configured Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Manually Configured Assignment\n   With manually configured assignment,\
    \ a network operator who has a\n   multicast address prefix assigns the multicast\
    \ group addresses to the\n   requesting nodes using a manual process.\n   Typically,\
    \ the user or administrator that wants to use a multicast\n   address for a particular\
    \ application requests an address from the\n   network operator using phone, email,\
    \ or similar means, and the\n   network operator provides the user with a multicast\
    \ address.  Then\n   the user/administrator of the node or application manually\
    \ configures\n   the application to use the assigned multicast address.\n   This\
    \ is a relatively simple process; it has been sufficient for\n   certain applications\
    \ that require manual configuration in any case,\n   or that cannot or do not\
    \ want to justify a static IANA assignment.\n   The manual assignment works when\
    \ the number of participants in a\n   group is small, as each participant has\
    \ to be manually configured.\n   This is the most commonly used technique when\
    \ the multicast\n   application does not have a static IANA assignment.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Static IANA Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Static IANA Assignment\n   In contrast to manually configured assignment,\
    \ as described above,\n   static IANA assignment refers to getting an assignment\
    \ for the\n   particular application directly from IANA.  There are two main forms\n\
    \   of IANA assignment: global and scope-relative.  Guidelines for IANA\n   are\
    \ described in [RFC5771].\n"
- title: 3.4.1.  Global IANA Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.4.1.  Global IANA Assignment\n   Globally unique address assignment is seen\
    \ as lucrative because it's\n   the simplest approach for application developers,\
    \ since they can then\n   hard-code the multicast address.  Hard-coding requires\
    \ no lease of\n   the usable multicast address, and likewise the client applications\
    \ do\n   not need to perform any kind of service discovery (but depend on\n  \
    \ hard-coded addresses).  However, there is an architectural scaling\n   problem\
    \ with this approach, as it encourages a \"land-grab\" of the\n   limited multicast\
    \ address space.\n"
- title: 3.4.2.  Scope-Relative IANA Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.4.2.  Scope-Relative IANA Assignment\n   IANA also assigns numbers as an integer\
    \ offset from the highest\n   address in each IPv4 administrative scope, as described\
    \ in [RFC2365].\n   For example, the SLPv2 discovery scope-relative offset is\
    \ \"2\", so the\n   SLPv2 discovery address within IPv4 Local-Scope (239.255.0.0/16)\
    \ is\n   \"239.255.255.253\"; within the IPv4 Organization Local-Scope\n   (239.192.0.0/14),\
    \ it is \"239.195.255.253\"; and so on.\n   Similar scope-relative assignments\
    \ also exist with IPv6 [RFC2375].\n   As IPv6 multicast addresses have much more\
    \ flexible scoping, scope-\n   relative assignments are also applicable to global\
    \ scopes.  The\n   assignment policies are described in [RFC3307].\n"
- title: 3.5.  Dynamic Assignments
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Dynamic Assignments\n   Layer 1 as defined in RFC 2908 [RFC2908] described\
    \ dynamic assignment\n   from Multicast Address Allocation Servers (MAAS) to applications\
    \ and\n   nodes, with the Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol\n\
    \   (MADCAP) [RFC2730] as an example.  Since then, other mechanisms have\n   also\
    \ been proposed (e.g., DHCPv6 assignment\n   [MCAST-DHCPv6]), but these have not\
    \ gained traction.\n   It would be rather straightforward to deploy a dynamic\
    \ assignment\n   protocol that would lease group addresses based on a multicast\
    \ prefix\n   to applications wishing to use multicast.  However, only few have\n\
    \   implemented MADCAP (i.e., it is not significantly deployed).  It is\n   not\
    \ clear if the sparse deployment is due to a lack of need for the\n   protocol.\
    \  Moreover, it is not clear how widely, for example, the\n   APIs for communication\
    \ between the multicast application and the\n   MADCAP client operating at the\
    \ host have been implemented [RFC2771].\n   An entirely different approach is\
    \ the Session Announcement Protocol\n   (SAP) [RFC2974].  In addition to advertising\
    \ global multicast\n   sessions, the protocol also has associated ranges of addresses\
    \ for\n   both IPv4 and IPv6 that can be used by SAP-aware applications to\n \
    \  create new groups and new group addresses.  Creating a session (and\n   obtaining\
    \ an address) is a rather tedious process, which is why it\n   isn't done all\
    \ that often.  It is also worth noting that the IPv6 SAP\n   address is unroutable\
    \ in the inter-domain multicast.\n   Conclusions about dynamic assignment protocols\
    \ are that:\n   1.  multicast is not significantly attractive in the first place,\n\
    \   2.  most applications have a static IANA assignment and thus require\n   \
    \    no dynamic or manual assignment,\n   3.  those applications that cannot be\
    \ easily satisfied with IANA or\n       manual assignment (i.e., where dynamic\
    \ assignment would be\n       desirable) are rather marginal, or\n   4.  there\
    \ are other reasons why dynamic assignments are not seen as a\n       useful approach\
    \ (for example, issues related to service\n       discovery/rendezvous).\n   In\
    \ consequence, more work on rendezvous/service discovery would be\n   needed to\
    \ make dynamic assignments more useful.\n"

    \                                 Figure 2\n   o  Manually configured assignment\
    \ is typical today, and works to a\n      sufficient degree in smaller scale.\n\
    \   o  Global IANA assignment has been done extensively in the past.\n      Scope-relative\
    \ IANA assignment is acceptable, but the size of the\n      pool is not very high.\
    \  Inter-domain routing of IPv6 IANA-assigned\n      prefixes is likely going\
    \ to be challenging, and as a result that\n      approach is not very appealing.\n\
    \   o  Dynamic assignment, e.g., MADCAP, has been implemented, but there\n   \
    \   is no wide deployment.  Therefore, either there are other gaps in\n      the\
    \ multicast architecture, or there is no sufficient demand for\n      it in the\
    \ first place when manual and static IANA assignments are\n      available.  Assignments\
    \ using SAP also exist but are not common;\n      global SAP assignment is infeasible\
    \ with IPv6.\n   o  Derived assignments are only applicable in a fringe case of\
    \ link-\n      scoped multicast.\n"

    \      [ADDRDISC-PROB] and [MSA-REQ] for more information.\n   o  The IETF should\

    \ scoped address space for static allocation\n      for applications that should\
    \ not be routed over the Internet (such\n      as backup software, etc. -- so\
    \ that these wouldn't need to use\n      global addresses, which should never\
    \ leak in any case).\n   o  The IETF should consider its static IANA allocations\
    \ policy, e.g.,\n      \"locking it down\" to a stricter policy (like \"IETF Consensus\"\
    ) and\n      looking at developing the discovery/rendezvous functions, if\n  \
    \    necessary.\n"

    \ allocations/assignments were discussed at the\n   MBONED WG session at IETF\
    \ 59 [MBONED-IETF59].\n   Dave Thaler, James Lingard, and Beau Williamson provided\

    \ of scope of this memo.\n   Obviously, the dynamic assignment protocols in particular\
