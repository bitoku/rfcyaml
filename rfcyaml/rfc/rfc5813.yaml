    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed via
    a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.
    \ MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   [RFC2578],
    STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].\n"

  - "2.  Introduction\n   The ForCES MIB module is a read-only MIB module that captures\n
    \  information related to the ForCES protocol ([RFC3654], [RFC3746],\n   [FORCES-APP],
    and [RFC5810]).\n   The ForCES MIB module does not include information that is
    specified\n   in other MIB modules, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.\n
    \  More specifically, the information in the ForCES MIB module relative\n   to
    associations (between Control Elements and Forwarding Elements)\n   that are in
    the UP state includes:\n   o  identifiers of the elements in the association,\n
    \  o  configuration parameters of the association, and\n   o  statistics of the
    association.\n"

  - "4.  ForCES MIB Overview\n   The MIB module contains the latest ForCES protocol
    version supported\n   by the Control Element (CE) (forcesLatestProtocolVersionSupported).\n
    \  Note that the CE must also allow interaction with Forwarding Elements\n   (FEs)
    supporting earlier versions.\n   For each association identified by the pair CE
    ID and FE ID, the\n   following associated information is provided by the MIB
    module as an\n   entry (forcesAssociationEntry) in the association table\n   (forcesAssociationTable):\n
    \  o  Version number of the ForCES protocol running in this association\n      (forcesAssociationRunningProtocolVersion).\n
    \  o  Time when the association entered the UP state\n      (forcesAssociationTimeUp).\n
    \  o  Time when the association left the UP state\n      (forcesAssociationTimeDown).
    \ Note that this is only used for\n      notification purposes as the association
    is removed from the MIB\n      immediately after it leaves the UP state.\n   o
    \ Number of ForCES Heartbeat messages sent from the CE\n      (forcesAssociationHBMsgSent)
    and received by the CE\n      (forcesAssociationHBMsgReceived) since the association
    entered the\n      UP state.\n   o  Number of operational ForCES messages sent
    from the CE\n      (forcesAssociationOperMsgSent) and received by the CE\n      (forcesAssociationOperMsgReceived)
    since the association entered\n      the UP state.  Only messages other than Heartbeat,
    Association\n      Setup, Association Setup Response, and Association Teardown
    are\n      counted.\n   Finally, the MIB module defines the following notifications:\n
    \  o  Whenever an association enters the UP state, a notification\n      (forcesAssociationEntryUp)
    is issued containing the version of the\n      ForCES protocol running.  CE ID
    and FE ID are concatenated to form\n      the table index, hence they appear in
    the OID of the ForCES-\n      protocol running-version object.  Optionally, a
    notification\n      (forcesAssociationEntryUpStats) can instead be issued with
    all\n      associated information for this association, except\n      forcesAssociationTimeDown.\n
    \  o  Whenever an association leaves the UP state, a notification\n      (forcesAssociationEntryDown)
    is issued containing the version of\n      the ForCES protocol running.  Optionally,
    a notification\n      (forcesAssociationEntryDownStats) can instead be issued
    with all\n      associated information for this association.  The reason is that\n
    \     the association and all its associated information will be removed\n      from
    the MIB immediately after this notification has been issued.\n"

    as the CE has sent to the FE\n   an Association Setup Response message containing
    a successful\n   Association Setup Result.  Only associations that are UP are\n
    \  reflected in this MIB module.\n   Associations are removed from the MIB module
    as soon as they leave\n   the UP state, i.e., if the CE has not received any message
    (Heartbeat\n   or other protocol message) from the FE within a given time period
    or\n   if an Association Teardown message has been sent by the CE.\n   Statistics
    counters are initialized to zero when the association is\n   created.  If the
    same association goes down and comes back up, the\n   counters will reset and
    the discontinuity can be discovered by\n   checking the discontinuity timestamp.
    \ In addition, the time-up\n   timestamp in the association allows to distinguish
    new associations\n   from past ones with the same index.  Note that the optional
    down\n   notification contains the statistics with the final values of the\n   statistics

    one or more CEs.  Where there\n   is a single CE, that CE will have knowledge
    of all the associations\n   in the NE and so can provide the information necessary
    to support the\n   managed objects defined in this MIB module.  Where there is
    more than\n   one CE, information about the associations may be distributed among\n
    \  the CEs.  Whether each CE implements the managed objects for the\n   associations
    of which it is aware or whether the CEs cooperate to\n   present the appearance
    of a single set of managed objects for all the\n   associations in the NE is outside
    the scope of this document.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this
    MIB module that have\n   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ So, if this\n   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that
    an\n   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB\n   module
    via direct SNMP SET operations.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module
    (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
    sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important
    to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to
    even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network
    via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \  o  Objects in the forcesMibGroup are protocol versions.  They are\n      neither
    sensitive nor vulnerable.\n   o  Objects in the forcesStatsGroup are statistics.
    \ They are neither\n      sensitive nor vulnerable.\n   SNMP versions prior to
    SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure
    (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on
    the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider
    the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],
    section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
    (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy
    SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n"
