- title: DISCUSSION
  contents:
  - "DISCUSSION\n   An interesting thing happened the other day. Some people were\
    \ up\n   visiting from IBM Federal Systems Division and, during the course of\n\
    \   the conversation, one of them pointed out that they had just as much\n   if\
    \ not more trouble with the operating system purveyors about making\n   OS \"\
    changes\" in behalf of networking as anyone else. At the time I\n   just observed\
    \ that it looked as if we were all victims together and\n   went on to the next\
    \ point, but further reflection prompts me to offer\n   a few thoughts on the\
    \ topic to the RFC community:\n   o   To us, it's axiomatic that networking code\
    \ is system code when it\n       has to be.\n   o   To Them, it's anathema.\n\
    \   o   We haven't really hit very hard on the point in the literature\n     \
    \  (although I guess I have made a few strong assertions along those\n       lines,\
    \ here and there, and it's at least implicit in some of Dave\n       Clark's stuff),\
    \ unless in my usual slipshod fashion I've just\n       missed seeing it.\n  \
    \ o   It would probably be responsible of us to rectify the omission\n       (assuming\
    \ there is one) since the literature is supposed to be\n       the way the researchers\
    \ educate the practioners.\n   o   Therefore, I propose a new subseries of RFCs\
    \ on how the\n       networking code was integrated with various OSs, with an\
    \ eye\n       toward subsequent publication of the collection in the open\n  \
    \     literature (RFCs being only semi-open, after all). I'll even\n       volunteer\
    \ to coordinate, at least to the extent of taking offers\n       from people who\
    \ are willing to tackle various systems and telling\n       them who else is having\
    \ a bash at the same one for purposes of\n       possible collaboration--and possibly\
    \ even merging the results of\n       separate efforts if people just send in\
    \ things they've already\n       done. (I suppose I even have to offer to do a\
    \ bit of editing, if\n       people want.)\n"

  - "All Victims Together\n   What I'd like to see emerge is a bunch of little essays\
    \ along the\n   lines of what I attempted to do on Multics in RFC 928, pp.14-21,\n\
    \   which would probably be a waste of electrons to reproduce here, but I\n  \
    \ will if Jon thinks it's worthwhile at some level. With luck,\n   volunteers\
    \ will emerge to discuss all of the major operating systems\n   currently on the\
    \ net and most of the minor ones as well, since one of\n   the most interesting\
    \ philosophical aspects of the exercise is to see\n   just what cuts and pastes\
    \ get made to any OS if it's networked. My\n   guess is that given more modern\
    \ systems' tendencies to make adding\n   device drivers more straightforward and\
    \ to offer interprocess\n   communication primitives at the system level, the\
    \ likeliest\n   difficulties to encounter would be getting on the process creation\n\
    \   path appropriately for Telnet--but that's reasoning ahead of the\n   data.\
    \ Suffice it to say that each piece should address Host-Host\n   protocol interpreter(s)\
    \ integration as well as Host-Comm Subnet\n   Processor PI (including device driver,\
    \ if one), plus something about\n   Telnet and something else about FTP (at least\
    \ to the extent of\n   whether it's per-user or \"monolithic\"--on the server\
    \ side, that is),\n   and, of course, some relevant anatomizing of the OS itself.\n\
    \   The moral, it seems to me, is that we have a chance to strike back at\n  \
    \ the oppressors by showing them what they should be furnishing with\n   their\
    \ silly off-the-rack systems if they are going to continue to\n   object to our\
    \ alterations to make the bloody things fit anywhere near\n   right. It's a little\
    \ extra effort on our part, but it's probably a\n   worthy goal. Indeed, if anybody\
    \ from IPTO is watching I suppose I'd\n   even go so far as to suggest a pro tem\
    \ System Integration Task force\n   if I hadn't already volunteered once in this\
    \ thing and used up my\n   quota.\n   Think about it.\n"
