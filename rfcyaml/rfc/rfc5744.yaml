- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As the IETF has grown, the process and the community have\
    \ gotten more\n   careful about defining the rights relating to copying documents\
    \ that\n   are granted by authors to the community, and the corresponding rights\n\
    \   that are granted by the community to readers and users of these\n   documents.\n\
    \   This document defines the copyright procedures for RFC Independent\n   Submission\
    \ documents.  It parallels the procedures for IETF-produced\n   documents defined\
    \ in [RFC5377] and [RFC5378].\n   In summary, submissions in the Independent Submission\
    \ stream use the\n   same submission procedures and mechanisms that are defined\
    \ in RFC\n   5378, and hence require the same \"incoming rights\" as IETF-stream\n\
    \   documents.  This document provides advice to the Trustees of the IETF\n  \
    \ Trust on \"outgoing\" rights to be granted to readers and users of\n   Independent\
    \ Submission documents, and it explicitly requests the IETF\n   Trust to manage\
    \ the rights in accordance with this advice.\n   This document also specifies\
    \ the policies regarding the disclosure of\n   Patents and Trademarks that may\
    \ be relevant to a submission intended\n   for the Independent Submission stream.\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The concept of RFC streams in general, and the Independent\
    \ Submission\n   stream in particular, are described in Section 5 of [RFC4844]\
    \ and in\n   RFC 4846 [RFC4846].  In general terms, the Independent Submission\n\
    \   stream continues the long-established tradition in the Internet\n   community\
    \ of allowing and encouraging the RFC Editor to publish\n   documents that are\
    \ relevant to the community but are not products of,\n   and do not conflict with,\
    \ the IETF process.  These may be comments on\n   IETF documents or they may be\
    \ other work relevant to the Internet\n   that, historically, the RFC Editor has\
    \ chosen to publish.\n   With the publication of [RFC5620], the IETF began a process\
    \ shift in\n   which the responsibility for Independent Submission stream\n  \
    \ publication will move to an individual designated by the IAB as the\n   Independent\
    \ Submission Editor (ISE).\n   Section 8 of RFC 4846 presented the copyright rules\
    \ for the\n   Independent Submission stream.  The present document is intended\
    \ to\n   be fully consistent with that section and to update it by clarifying\n\
    \   the formal procedures that the IETF Trust will use to effect those\n   rules.\n"
- title: 3.  Goals
  contents:
  - "3.  Goals\n   The goal of the RFC Independent Submission stream is to publish\n\
    \   information that is intended to advance the state of the art and the\n   interoperability\
    \ of solutions for use in conjunction with the\n   Internet.  As specified in\
    \ Section 8 of RFC 4846, the community has\n   determined that this objective\
    \ will best be met with a liberal\n   copyright policy on Independent Submission\
    \ documents.  Therefore, the\n   Independent Submission policy is to allow any\
    \ individual reading such\n   documents to use the content thereof in any manner.\
    \  The only\n   restriction is that proper credit (\"attribution\") must be given.\n\
    \   Lawyers describe this liberal policy by saying that this stream\n   normally\
    \ permits \"unlimited derivative works\".  (It should be noted\n   that this liberal\
    \ policy was always followed by the original RFC\n   Editor, Jon Postel; in a\
    \ sense, the present document is a\n   formalization of a 30-year-old policy on\
    \ RFC copyrights.)\n   However, for a small subset of documents published as Independent\n\
    \   Submissions, it is not reasonable to permit unlimited derivative\n   works.\
    \  Examples are proprietary protocols and output from other\n   standards bodies.\
    \  In such cases, authors are permitted to request\n   that the published Independent\
    \ Submission documents permit no\n   derivative works.\n   Note also that this\
    \ unlimited derivative works policy applies to all\n   parts of an Independent\
    \ Submission document, including any code.\n   Therefore, no separate licensing\
    \ procedure is required for extracting\n   and adapting code that is contained\
    \ in an Independent Submission\n   document submitted under the (preferred) unlimited\
    \ derivative works\n   terms.  On the other hand, code may not be extracted and\
    \ adapted from\n   Independent Submission documents submitted under the no derivative\n\
    \   works terms.\n"
- title: 4.  Rules for Submission and Use of Material
  contents:
  - "4.  Rules for Submission and Use of Material\n   Independent Submission authors\
    \ will submit their material as\n   Internet-Drafts.  These drafts will be submitted\
    \ to, and stored in,\n   the IETF Internet-Drafts repository in the same fashion\
    \ as IETF\n   Internet-Drafts.\n   During Internet-Draft submission, authors who\
    \ intend to submit their\n   document for publication in the Independent Submission\
    \ stream will\n   grant rights as described in [RFC5378].  To request that the\n\
    \   contribution be published as an RFC that permits no derivative works,\n  \
    \ an author may use the form specified for use with RFC 5378.\n   The IETF Trust\
    \ will indicate that, in cooperation with the\n   Independent Submission Editor,\
    \ the Trust grants to readers and users\n   of material from Independent Submission\
    \ documents the right to make\n   unlimited derivative works, unless the document\
    \ specifies that no\n   derivative works are permitted.  This will permit anyone\
    \ to copy,\n   extract, modify, or otherwise use material from Independent\n \
    \  Submission documents as long as suitable attribution is given.\n   Contributors\
    \ of Internet-Drafts intended for the Independent\n   Submission stream will include\
    \ suitable boilerplate defined by the\n   IETF Trust.  This boilerplate shall\
    \ indicate compliance with RFC 5378\n   and shall explicitly indicate either that\
    \ no derivative works can be\n   based on the contribution or, as is preferred,\
    \ that unlimited\n   derivative works may be crafted from the contribution.\n\
    \   It should be understood that the final publication decision for the\n   Independent\
    \ Submission stream rests with the Independent Submission\n   Editor (ISE).  Compliance\
    \ with these terms is not a guarantee of\n   publication.  In particular, the\
    \ ISE may question the appropriateness\n   of a \"no derivative works\" restriction\
    \ requested by an author.  The\n   appropriateness of such usage must be negotiated\
    \ among the authors\n   and the ISE.\n"
- title: 5.  Procedures Requested of the IETF Trust
  contents:
  - "5.  Procedures Requested of the IETF Trust\n   The Independent Submission Editor\
    \ requests that the IETF Trust and\n   its Trustees assist in meeting the goals\
    \ and procedures set forth in\n   this document.\n   The Trustees are requested\
    \ to publicly confirm their willingness and\n   ability to accept responsibility\
    \ for the Intellectual Property Rights\n   for the Independent Submission stream.\
    \  They are also requested to\n   indicate their willingness and intent to work\
    \ according to the\n   procedures and goals defined by the ISE.\n   Specifically,\
    \ the Trustees are asked to develop the necessary\n   boilerplate to enable the\
    \ suitable marking of documents so that the\n   IETF Trust receives the rights\
    \ as specified in RFC 5378.  These\n   procedures need to also allow documents\
    \ to grant either no rights to\n   make derivative works or, preferentially, the\
    \ right to make unlimited\n   derivative works from the documents.  It is left\
    \ to the Trust to\n   specify exactly how this shall be clearly indicated in each\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 6.  Patent and Trademark Rules for the Independent Submission Stream
  contents:
  - "6.  Patent and Trademark Rules for the Independent Submission Stream\n   As specified\
    \ above, contributors of documents for the Independent\n   Submission stream are\
    \ expected to use the IETF Internet-Draft\n   process, complying therein with\
    \ the rules specified in the latest\n   version of BCP 9, whose version at the\
    \ time of writing was [RFC2026].\n   This includes the disclosure of Patent and\
    \ Trademark issues that are\n   known, or can be reasonably expected to be known,\
    \ by the contributor.\n   Disclosure of license terms for patents is also requested,\
    \ as\n   specified in the most recent version of BCP 79.  The version of BCP\n\
    \   79 at the time of this writing was [RFC3979], updated by [RFC4879].\n   The\
    \ Independent Submission stream has chosen to use the IETF's IPR\n   disclosure\
    \ mechanism, www.ietf.org/ipr/, for this purpose.  The\n   Independent Submission\
    \ Editor would prefer the most liberal terms\n   possible be made available for\
    \ specifications published as\n   Independent Submission documents.  Terms that\
    \ do not require fees or\n   licensing are preferable.  Non-discriminatory terms\
    \ are strongly\n   preferred over those that discriminate among users.  However,\n\
    \   although disclosure is required, there are no specific requirements\n   on\
    \ the licensing terms for intellectual property related to\n   Independent Submission\
    \ publication.\n"
