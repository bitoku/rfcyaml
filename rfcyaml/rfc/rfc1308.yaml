  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   The Internet is growing at a phenomenal rate, with no deceleration\
    \ in\n   sight.  Every month thousands of new users are added. New networks\n\
    \   are added literally almost every day. In fact, it is entirely\n   conceivable\
    \ that in the future every human with access to a computer\n   will be able to\
    \ interact with every other over the Internet and her\n   sister networks. However,\
    \ the ability to interact with everyone is\n   only useful if one can locate the\
    \ people with whom they need to work.\n   Thus, as the Internet grows, one of\
    \ the limitations imposed on the\n   effective use of the network will be determined\
    \ by the quality and\n   coverage of Directory Services available.\n   Directory\
    \ Services in this paper refers not only to the types of\n   services provided\
    \ by the telephone companies' White Pages, but to\n   resource location, Yellow\
    \ Pages services, mail address lookup, etc.\n   We will take a brief look at the\
    \ services available today, and at the\n   problems they have, and then we will\
    \ show how the X.500 standard\n   solves those problems.\n"
- title: 2. CURRENT SERVICES AND THEIR LIMITATIONS
  contents:
  - "2. CURRENT SERVICES AND THEIR LIMITATIONS\n   In the interests of brevity, we\
    \ will only look at the WHOIS service,\n   and at the DNS. Each will illustrate\
    \ a particular philosophy, if you\n   will, of Directory Services.\n   The WHOIS\
    \ service is maintained by the Defense Data Network Network\n   Information Center,\
    \ or DDN NIC.  It is currently maintained at GSI\n   for the IP portion of the\
    \ Internet. It contains information about IP\n   networks, IP network managers,\
    \ a scattering of well-known personages\n   in the Internet, and a large amount\
    \ of information related\n   specifically to the MILNET systems. As the NIC is\
    \ responsible for\n   assigning new networks out of the pool of IP addresses,\
    \ it is very\n   easily able to collect this information when a new network is\n\
    \   registered. However, the WHOIS database is big enough and\n   comprehensive\
    \ enough to exhibit many of the flaws of a large\n   centralized database. First,\
    \ centralized location of the WHOIS\n   database causes slow response during times\
    \ of peak querying activity,\n   storage limitations, and also causes the entire\
    \ service to be\n   unavailable if the link to GSI is broken. Second, centralized\n\
    \   administration of the database, where any changes to the database\n   have\
    \ to be mailed off to GSI for human transcription into the\n   database, increases\
    \ the turnaround time before the changes are\n   propagated, and also introduces\
    \ another source of potential error in\n   the accuracy of the information. These\
    \ particular problems affect to\n   different degrees any system which attempts\
    \ to provide Directory\n   Services through a centralized database.\n   The Domain\
    \ Name Service, or DNS, contains information about the\n   mapping of host and\
    \ domain names, such as, \"home.ans.net\", to IP\n   addresses. This is done so\
    \ that humans can use easily remembered\n   names for machines rather than strings\
    \ of numbers. It is maintained\n   in a distributed fashion, with each DNS server\
    \ providing nameservice\n   for a limited number of domains.  Also, secondary\
    \ nameservers can be\n   identified for each domain, so that one unreachable network\
    \ will not\n   necessarily cut off nameservice. However, even though the DNS is\n\
    \   superlative at providing these services, there are some problems when\n  \
    \ we attempt to provide other Directory Services in the DNS. First, the\n   DNS\
    \ has very limited search capabilities. Second, the DNS supports\n   only a small\
    \ number of data types. Adding new data types, such as\n   photographs, would\
    \ involve very extensive implementation changes.\n"
- title: 3. THE X.500 SOLUTION
  contents:
  - "3. THE X.500 SOLUTION\n   X.500 is a CCITT protocol which is designed to build\
    \ a distributed,\n   global directory. It offers the following features:\n   *\
    \ Decentralized Maintenance:\n     Each site running X.500 is responsible ONLY\
    \ for its local part of\n     the Directory, so updates and maintenance can be\
    \ done instantly.\n   * Powerful Searching Capabilities:\n     X.500 provides\
    \ powerful searching facilities that allow users to\n     construct arbitrarily\
    \ complex queries.\n   * Single Global Namespace:\n     Much like the DNS, X.500\
    \ provides a single homogeneous namespace\n     to users. The X.500 namespace\
    \ is more flexible and expandable\n     than the DNS.\n   * Structured Information\
    \ Framework:\n     X.500 defines the information framework used in the Directory,\n\
    \     allowing local extensions.\n   * Standards-Based Directory Services:\n \
    \    As X.500 can be used to build a standards-based directory,\n     applications\
    \ which require directory information (e-mail,\n     automated resources locators,\
    \ special-purpose directory tools)\n     can access a planet's worth of information\
    \ in a uniform manner,\n     no matter where they are based or currently running.\n\
    \   With these features alone, X.500 is being used today to provide the\n   backbone\
    \ of a global White Pages service. There is almost 3 years of\n   operational\
    \ experience with X.500, and it is being used widely in\n   Europe and Australia\
    \ in addition to North America. In addition, the\n   various X.500 implementations\
    \ add some other features, such as\n   photographs in G3-FAX format, and color\
    \ photos in JPEG format.\n   However, as X.500 is standards based, there are very\
    \ few\n   incompatibilities between the various versions of X.500, and as the\n\
    \   namespace is consistent, the information in the Directory can be\n   accessed\
    \ by any implementation. Also, work is being done in providing\n   Yellow Pages\
    \ services and other information resource location tasks\n   in the Directory.\n\
    \   However, there are some limitations to the X.500 technology as it is\n   currently\
    \ implemented. One price that is paid for the flexibility in\n   searching is\
    \ a decline in the speed of the searching. This is because\n   a) searches over\
    \ a part of the distributed namespace may have to\n   traverse the network, and\
    \ some implementations cache all the\n   responses before giving them to the user,\
    \ and b) some early\n   implementations performed search slowly anyway. A second\
    \ problem with\n   the implementations is that for security reasons only a limited\n\
    \   amount of information is returned to the user; for example, if a\n   search\
    \ turns up 1000 hits, only 20 or so are returned to the user.\n   Although this\
    \ number is tunable, it does mean that someone with a big\n   search will have\
    \ to do a lot of work. The performance of the\n   Directory, while increasing\
    \ rapidly in the last two years, is still\n   not able to provide real-time directory\
    \ services for such things as\n   routing protocols.  However, work is being done\
    \ to speed up service.\n   The X.500 Directory is taking us closer to the day\
    \ when we will\n   indeed have the entire world on our desktops, and X.500 will\
    \ help\n   insure that we can find whom and what we need.\n"
