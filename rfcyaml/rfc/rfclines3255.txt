Abstract This document describes an extension to the mapping of Point to Point Protocol (PPP) into Synchronous Optical NETwork/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) to include the use of SONET/SDH SPE/VC virtual concatenation and the use of both high order and low order payloads.
Introduction Current implementations of PPP over SONET/SDH are required to select transport structures from the relatively limited number of contiguously concatenated signals that are available.
The only currently supported SONET/SDH SPE/VCs in RFC 2615
The use of virtual concatenation means that the right size SONET/SDH bandwidth can be selected for PPP links.
This table is an extended version of the equivalent table in RFC 2615 [3].
Additional information on the above terms can be found in Bellcore GR 253 CORE [4], ANSI T1.105 [5], ANSI T1.105.02 [6] and ITU T G.707 [7].
Rate Comparisons Currently supported WAN bandwidth links for PPP over SONET/SDH:
4 AU 4 4c (620Mbit/s)
STM 16 AU 4 16c (2.4Gbit/s)
Note that AU 4 4c and AU 4 16c are not generally available in SDH networks at present.
With virtual concatenation the following additional WAN bandwidth links would be available for PPP over SONET/SDH:
STS 3c nv (n 1 64)
10Gbit/s Higher levels of virtual concatenation are possible, but not necessarily useful.
Lower levels of virtual concatenation are defined in the telecommunications standards for use if needed.
Table 1 and Table 2, respectively depict the SONET/SDH transport structures that are currently available to carry various popular bit rates.
Each table contains three columns.
The first column shows the bit rates of the service to be transported.
The next column contains two values: a)
the logical signals that are currently available to provide such transport and, b) in parenthesis, the percent efficiency of the given transport signal without the use of virtual concatenation.
Likewise, the final column also contains two values: a)
the logical signals that are currently available to provide such transport and, b) in parenthesis, the percent efficiency of the given transport signal with the use of virtual concatenation.
Note, that Table 1, contains SONET transport signals with the following effective payload capacity: VT 1.5 SPE   1.600
49.536 Mbit/s, STS 3c SPE
149.760 Mbit/s, STS 12c SPE
599.040 Mbit/s, STS 48c SPE
2,396.160 Mbit/s, and STS 192c
Similarly, Table 2, contains SDH transport signals with the following effective payload capacity: VC 12   2.176 Mbit/s, VC 3
149.760 Mbit/s, VC 4 4c
599.040 Mbit/s, VC 4 16c
2,396.160 Mbit/s, and VC 4 64c
VC 4 7v (95%) 3.
There are two minor modifications to the physical layer requirements as defined in RFC 2615 when virtually concatenated SPEs/VCs are used to provide transport for PPP over SONET/SDH.
First, the path signal label (C2 byte) value for SONET/SDH STS 1/VC 3 and above SPE/VCs is required to be the same for all constituent channels.
This is in contrast to the use of a single C2 byte for PPP transport over contiguously concatenated SONET/SDH SPE/VCs.
The values used for the C2 bytes should be in accordance with RFC 2615.
For SONET VT 1.5/2/6 and SDH VC 11/12/2 the path signal label (V5 byte bits 5 7) is required to be the same for all constituent channels per ITU T G.707 [7] and ANSI T1.105.02 [6].
Second, for SONET/SDH STS 1/VC 3 and above SPE/VCs the multi frame indicator (H4) byte will be unused for transport links utilizing contiguously concatenated SONET/SDH SPE/VCs.
When the concatenation scheme is virtual as opposed to contiguous, the H4 byte must be populated as per ITU T G.707 or T1.105.02.
Similarly, for virtual concatenation based on SONET VT 1.5/2/6 and SDH VC 11/12/2 channels bit 2 of the path overhead K4 byte will be set to the value indicated per ITU T G.707 [7] and ANSI T1.105.02 [6].
Standards Status ITU T (SG13/SG15), ANSI T1X1 and ETSI TM1
/WP3 have developed a global standard for SONET/SDH High Order and Low Order payload Virtual Concatenation.
This standard is defined in the following documents: ITU T G.803 Architecture of transport networks based on the synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) ITU T G.707 Network Node Interface for the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) ITU T G.783 Characteristics of Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) Equipment Functional Blocks ANSI T1.105 Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)
Basic Description including Multiplex Structure, Rates and Formats ANSI T1.105.02

Generic requirements of transport functionality of equipment Part 9: Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) concatenated path layer functions.
Requirements Work in ITU T, ANSI T1X1 and ETSI TM1
/WP3 has ensured global standards alignment.
With the completion of a standard for SONET/SDH SPE/VC virtual concatenation it is appropriate to document the use of this standard for PPP transport over SONET/SDH, which is the intent of this document.
The security discussion in RFC 2615 also applies to this document.
No new security features have been explicitly introduced or removed compared to RFC 2615.
