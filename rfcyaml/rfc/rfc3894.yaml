  - "Abstract\n   The Sieve scripting language allows users to control handling and\n
    \  disposal of their incoming e-mail.  By default, an e-mail message\n   that
    is processed by a Sieve script is saved in the owner's \"inbox\".\n   Actions
    such as \"fileinto\" and \"redirect\" cancel this default\n   behavior.\n   This
    document defines a new keyword parameter, \":copy\", to be used\n   with the Sieve
    \"fileinto\" and \"redirect\" actions.  Adding \":copy\" to\n   an action suppresses
    cancellation of the default \"inbox\" save.  It\n   allows users to add commands
    to an existing script without changing\n   the meaning of the rest of the script.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Sieve scripting language [SIEVE] allows users to control
    handling\n   and disposal of their incoming e-mail.  Two frequently used Sieve\n
    \  commands are \"fileinto\" (saving into a local message store, such as\n   an
    IMAP server) and \"redirect\" (forwarding to another e-mail\n   address).  Both
    of these cancel the Sieve default behavior of saving\n   into the user's \"inbox\".\n
    \  But some users have the notion of forwarding an extra copy of a\n   message
    for safekeeping to another e-mail address, or of saving a\n   copy in a folder
    - in addition to the regular message delivery, which\n   shouldn't be affected
    by the copy.\n   If saving an extra copy is all the user wanted to do,\n      fileinto
    \"unfiltered\";\n      keep;\n   would do the job.  The \"keep\" command does
    explicitly what the\n   cancelled default behavior did.  But the explicit \"keep\"
    is a poor\n   substitute for the implicit \"keep\" when more processing follows:\n
    \     fileinto \"unfiltered\";\n      keep;\n      if header \"Subject\" \"MAKE
    MONEY FAST!!!\"\n      {\n              discard;\n      }\n   In this example,
    the \"discard\" is ineffective against the explicit\n   \"keep\"; the discarded
    message still ends up in the user's inbox.\n   It is possible to generate Sieve
    code that perfectly expresses a\n   user's wishes, but such code quickly grows
    unwieldy because it needs\n   to keep track of the state that the implicit \"keep\"
    would have had\n   without the \"fileinto\" or \"redirect\" command.\n   This
    extension tries to make life easier for user interface designers\n   and script
    writers by allowing them to express the \"copy\" semantics\n   directly.\n"

  - "2.  Conventions used\n   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section
    1.1, including\n   use of [KEYWORDS] and \"Syntax:\" label for the definition
    of action\n   and tagged arguments syntax.\n   The capability string associated
    with extension defined in this\n   document is \"copy\".\n"

  - "3.  \":copy\" extension to the \"fileinto\" and \"redirect\" commands\n   Syntax:\n
    \       \"fileinto\" [\":copy\"] <folder: string>\n        \"redirect\" [\":copy\"]
    <address: string>\n   If the optional \":copy\" keyword is specified with \"fileinto\"
    or\n   \"redirect\", the tagged command does not cancel the implicit \"keep\".\n
    \  Instead, it merely files or redirects a copy in addition to whatever\n   else
    is happening to the message.\n   Example:\n      require [\"copy\", \"fileinto\"];\n
    \     fileinto :copy \"incoming\";\n      # ... more processing follows ...\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The \"copy\" extension makes it easier to eavesdrop
    on a user's message\n   stream without the user noticing.  This was technically
    possible\n   before if an attacker gained read/write access to a user's Sieve\n
    \  scripts, but now an attacker no longer needs to parse a script in\n   order
    to modify it.  Write access to Sieve scripts must be protected\n   as strongly
    as read/write access to e-mail, for example by using\n   secure directory protocols
    such as correctly parameterized LDAP over\n   TLS [LDAP].\n   Organizations that
    wish to monitor their users' e-mail traffic must\n   familiarize themselves with
    local data protection laws before\n   creating stores of old e-mail traffic without
    control, or perhaps\n   even knowledge, of the sender or intended recipients.\n
    \  Organizations that legally use \"redirect :copy\" to eavesdrop on\n   correspondence
    (for example, by keeping a log to answer questions\n   about insider trading at
    a later time) can avoid future problems by\n   setting users' privacy expectations
    correctly.\n"
