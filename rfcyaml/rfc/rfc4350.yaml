  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The New Zealand Government has already adopted XML as its\
    \ primary\n   means of storing and exchanging data.  The New Zealand Government\n\
    \   publishes documents, schemas, and other government artefacts.\n   The New\
    \ Zealand Government now wishes to define a namespace\n   convention and structure\
    \ for its agencies by creating and managing\n   globally unique, persistent, location-independent\
    \ identifiers for\n   their schema resources and XML artefacts.\n   This is a\
    \ natural extension of the development of the Dublin Core\n   based New Zealand\
    \ Government metadata standard (New Zealand\n   Government Locator Service, or\
    \ NZGLS) used by government agencies to\n   create metadata and made operational\
    \ to the public through an all-\n   of-government portal.\n   The New Zealand\
    \ Government wishes to provide guidance on namespaces\n   to its agencies so that\
    \ they use a portion of the adopted namespace\n   to minimise the risk of their\
    \ creating different (and potentially\n   conflicting) namespace structures. \
    \ This issue potentially extends to\n   data exchange beyond government into the\
    \ private sector of New\n   Zealand, thus placing the government under an obligation\
    \ to provide\n   guidance in the assignment and management of additional namespaces.\n\
    \   The New Zealand Government wishes to register the country NID, NZL,\n   with\
    \ the Name Specific String (NSS) split into two parts; the first\n   part being\
    \ a specific sub-type <nz-specifier> and the second part as\n   a <nz-specifier\
    \ defined string>.\n   As part of the URN structure, the New Zealand Government\
    \ wishes to\n   define and subsequently manage the \"govt\" specifier.  It will\
    \ also\n   assign additional specifiers requested by other New Zealand\n   organisations\
    \ in accordance with the rules and processes proposed\n   herein.\n   The New\
    \ Zealand Government hoped to make use of the two-letter\n   Namespace Identifier\
    \ (NID) combination for its ubiquitous country\n   code, NZ.  But since there\
    \ is as yet no process to register these\n   (see RFC 3406 [1]) the government\
    \ has opted to request its well-known\n   alternative three-letter country code\
    \ (see ISO 3166 [3]).\n   This namespace specification requests a formal namespace\
    \ (see [6] for\n   more information about formal namespaces).\n   Please note\
    \ that this paper includes a discussion on the use of\n   diacritic marks, in\
    \ particular, Maori macrons.  Maori is an official\n   language of New Zealand.\
    \  In recognition of the established practice\n   of publishing RFCs for a global\
    \ audience in ASCII text where\n   diacritic marks are unable to be recognised,\
    \ the text has been\n   presented without macrons.\n"

    \ Information:\n      Version Number: 1\n      Date: 2005-03-31\n   Declared registrant\
    \ of the namespace:\n      State Services Commission\n      New Zealand Government\n\
    \      100 Molesworth Street\n      Wellington,\n      New Zealand\n      Email:\
    \ e-GIF@ssc.govt.nz\n   Declaration of structure:\n      The identifier has a\
    \ hierarchical structure as follows:\n      urn:nzl:<nz-specifier>[:<nz-specifier\
    \ defined string>]+\n      + denotes one or more occurrences of nz-specifier defined\
    \ strings\n      all delimited by a colon.\n      For example:\n      urn:nzl:govt:registering:dogs:registration:1-0\n\
    \      urn:nzl:govt:registering:firearms:form:1-3\n      urn:nzl:govt:registering:recreational_fishing:form:1-0\n\
    \      The <nz-specifier> and <nz-specifier defined string> can comprise\n   \
    \   any UTF-8 characters compliant with URI syntax and must not\n      contain\
    \ the \":\" character (see STD 66, RFC 3986 [2]).  The\n      exclusion of the\
    \ colon from the list of other characters means\n      that the colon can only\
    \ occur as a delimiter between string\n      values.  The values come from the\
    \ terms listed in the NZGLS.\n      The State Services Commission (SSC) will take\
    \ responsibility for\n      the <nz-specifier> \"govt\" and its sub level <nz-specifier\
    \ defined\n      string> terms; e.g., \"registering\".\n      The SSC will take\
    \ responsibility to assign other <nz-specifiers>\n      to organisations who apply\
    \ and can satisfy the SSC that they have\n      the capability to manage the sub\
    \ level and its applicable <nz-\n      specifier defined string(s)>.\n   Relevant\
    \ ancillary documentation:\n      The function and noun syntax used in the <nz-specifier\
    \ defined\n      string> is based on and taken from the NZGLS\n      (http://www.e.govt.nz/standards/nzgls/thesauri/).\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      Identifiers in the <nz-specifier>\
    \ \"govt\" are defined and assigned\n      in the requested namespace by the SSC\
    \ after ensuring that the URNs\n      to be assigned are unique.  Uniqueness is\
    \ achieved by checking\n      against the registry of previously assigned names.\n\
    \      The SSC will ensure that the URNs to be assigned to other\n      organisations\
    \ applying for other <nz-specifier(s)> (e.g., mil, co,\n      org) are unique\
    \ by checking against the registry of previously\n      assigned names.\n    \
    \  The SSC will develop and publish the process for doing this,\n      which,\
    \ where applicable, is consistent with the process it uses\n      for moderating\
    \ the .govt.nz Top Level Domain (TLD).\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \      The New Zealand Government is committed to maintaining uniqueness\n   \
    \   and persistence of all resources identified by assigned URNs.\n      Given\
    \ that the URN sought is NZL (the long-held ISO 3166 Alpha-3\n      representation\
    \ of the country) and that the country's independence\n      from any other jurisdiction\
    \ expected to continue indefinitely, the\n      URN should also persist indefinitely.\n\
    \      Likewise, the <nz-specifier> \"govt\" has a very long life\n      expectancy\
    \ and can be expected to remain unique for the\n      foreseeable future.  The\
    \ assignment process guarantees that names\n      are not reassigned.  The binding\
    \ between the name and its resource\n      is permanent.\n      The SSC will ensure\
    \ that other organisations applying to manage\n      other <nz-specifier> Second\
    \ Level Name (2LN) sub-levels of the NZL\n      URN namespace (e.g., mil, co,\
    \ org) uniquely assign the namespace\n      at this level.\n   Process of identifier\
    \ assignment:\n      Under the \"NZL\" NID, the New Zealand Government will manage\
    \ the\n      <nz-specifier> \"govt\" and leverage the existing NZGLS thesaurus\n\
    \      for identifier resources to maintain uniqueness.\n      The process of\
    \ assigning URNs at the <nz-specifier> sub-level will\n      be managed by the\
    \ SSC of the New Zealand Government.  (The SSC has\n      managed and maintained\
    \ the NZGLS thesauri since its inception in\n      2002 and has moderated the\
    \ TLD .govt.nz).\n      The SSC will develop and publish the process for doing\
    \ this, which\n      is consistent with the process it uses for moderating the\
    \ .govt.nz\n      TLD, where applicable.  The process for marketing the \".govt.nz\"\
    \n      TLD can be found at these links:\n         http://www.e.govt.nz/moderation/mod-policy/chapter1.html\n\
    \         and\n         http://www.e.govt.nz/moderation/mod-policy/chapter2.html\n\
    \      The process is drawn from the 2LD policies and procedures of the\n    \
    \  New Zealand Office of the Domain Name Commissioner,\n      http://dnc.org.nz\
    \ (and specifically\n      http://www.dnc.org.nz/story/30043-35-1.html).\n   \
    \   Other New Zealand organisations may apply to the SSC to delegate\n      specifiers\
    \ for resolution and management assigned by them.\n      Delegation of this responsibility\
    \ will not be unreasonably\n      withheld provided that the processes for their\
    \ resolution and\n      management are robust and are followed.\n      Organisations\
    \ who apply to have a <nz-specifier> assigned to them\n      must satisfy the\
    \ SSC that they have the capability to manage the\n      2LN sub-level and its\
    \ applicable <nz-specifier defined string(s)>\n      responsibly.  The policies\
    \ and procedures in the links above will\n      be provided to applicants as a\
    \ guide and will be used by the SSC\n      to determine the applicant's capability.\n\
    \   Process of identifier resolution:\n      For the <nz-specifier> \"govt\",\
    \ the SSC will maintain lists of\n      assigned identifiers on its web pages\
    \ at http://www.e.govt.nz/.\n      The SSC will require other organisations that\
    \ apply to manage\n      other <nz-specifier> sub-levels to follow this practice\
    \ unless\n      there are specific reasons (e.g., security) not to do so.\n  \
    \ Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      The lexical equivalence of the NZL namespace-specific\
    \ strings\n      (NSSs) is defined as an exact, but not case-sensitive, string\n\
    \      match.  Best Practice guidelines will specify:\n      a)  NZL in either\
    \ uppercase or lowercase (The New Zealand\n          government will assign names\
    \ as case-insensitive, to ensure\n          that there will not be two NZL URNs\
    \ differing only by case.)\n      b)  The first letter of each <nz-specifier>\
    \ and <nz specifier\n          defined string> in uppercase or the whole value\
    \ in lowercase.\n      c)  Any identifier in NZL namespaces can be compared using\
    \ the\n          normal mechanisms for percent-encoded UTF-8 strings.\n      Note\
    \ that textual data containing diacritic marks (such as Maori\n      macrons)\
    \ will not be treated as lexically equivalent to textual\n      data without diacritic\
    \ marks; i.e., a distinction will be made.\n      It is important to note that\
    \ a macron can change the meaning of a\n      word in the Maori language.\n  \
    \    The following explanation provides guidance in this respect.\n      NSS is\
    \ any UTF-8-encoded string that is compliant with the URN\n      syntax (i.e.,\
    \ following the encoding rules for 8-bit characters).\n      Since Maori is an\
    \ official language in New Zealand and its use of\n      diacritic marks (in this\
    \ case macrons) invokes the requirement to\n      percent-encode reserved characters,\
    \ the following extract from RFC\n      3986 [4] is applicable.\n         When\
    \ a new URI scheme defines a component that represents\n         textual data\
    \ consisting of characters from the Universal\n         Character Set [UCS], the\
    \ data should first be encoded as octets\n         according to the UTF-8 character\
    \ encoding [STD63]; then only\n         those octets that do not correspond to\
    \ characters in the\n         unreserved set should be percent-encoded.  For example,\
    \ the\n         character A would be represented as \"A\", the character LATIN\n\
    \         CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE would be represented as \"%C3%80\",\n  \
    \       and the character KATAKANA LETTER A would be represented as\n        \
    \ \"%E3%82%A2\".\n      As described above, UTF-8 allows the use of diacritic\
    \ marks such\n      as New Zealand Maori macrons.\n      In the New Zealand context,\
    \ the word \"Maori\" carries a diacritic\n      mark over the \"a\".  A URI including\
    \ the macronised word \"Maori\"\n      would be percent-encoded as M%C4%81ori.\n\
    \      Given that the \"govt\" namespaces will draw from the NZGLS\n      thesaurus\
    \ (which does not at present utilise diacritic marks), the\n      \"govt\" <nz-specifier>\
    \ will not utilise UTF-8's percent-encoding\n      convention for diacritic marks.\
    \  An \"a\" with a diacritic mark will\n      be presented simply as an \"a\"\
    .  There is no mapping or equivalence\n      table.  Therefore, the requirement\
    \ to distinguish between terms\n      that have diacritic marks and those that\
    \ do not will not arise in\n      the <nz-specifier> \"govt\".\n      Other organisations\
    \ may use diacritic marks with certain\n      conditions.  Organisations that\
    \ apply to manage other\n      <nz-specifier> sub-levels of the NZL URN namespace\
    \ could utilise\n      UTF-8's diacritic functionality provided that they have\
    \ the\n      applicable processes to separate Maori language terms using\n   \
    \   macrons from those that do not, in order to ensure uniqueness in\n      accordance\
    \ with rule c) above.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      None other than names being derived from the\
    \ NZGLS thesaurus\n      \"dictionary\".\n   Scope:\n      Global, but primarily\
    \ of national interest.\n"
- title: 3.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Namespace Considerations\n   The SSC undertook a preliminary study of the\
    \ URI alternatives against\n   the key requirements.  The options were narrowed\
    \ down to five.  These\n   were a private URI scheme, URL, PURL, IRI, and URN.\
    \  URN was\n   considered the most appropriate URI against the criteria.\n   Consultation\
    \ on the preliminary study was actively sought from the\n   Internet Society of\
    \ NZ (InternetNZ), the NZ Computer Society,\n   applicable vendors, and government\
    \ agencies.  Publication on the\n   e-government web site allowed for public participation.\n\
    \   Points that should be noted are:\n   a)  With respect to the NID, the New\
    \ Zealand Government is the first\n       known jurisdiction to apply its globally\
    \ known ISO 3166 Alpha-3\n       country code to become a URN.  One objective\
    \ of the ISO 3166\n       Alpha-2 and 3-letter country codes was to provide uniqueness.\n\
    \   b)  The namespace follows the logical structure of the NZGLS as shown\n  \
    \     in the examples above.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   Providers of government information for data\
    \ exchange benefit by the\n   publication of the namespace because it provides\
    \ much-needed guidance\n   on generating target namespaces for schema development\
    \ using a\n   process that reflects what they already know; namely, metadata\n\
    \   creation in NZGLS.  The identifiers under the \"govt\" specifier will\n  \
    \ track the terms used in the New Zealand government thesaurus.\n   Consequently,\
    \ New Zealanders will ultimately benefit since the\n   exchange of more structured\
    \ information will potentially improve\n   online experiences in areas such as\
    \ forms design.\n   Any citizen or organisation with Internet web browser capability\
    \ will\n   be entitled to access the namespace and its associated application,\n\
    \   registration, and resolution services.  While the assignment of\n   identifiers\
    \ will be managed by the SSC, additional specifiers (such\n   as mil, co, org,\
    \ and their <nz-specifier defined string(s)>) can be\n   openly applied for and\
    \ registered by anyone following an approved\n   namespace governance process\
