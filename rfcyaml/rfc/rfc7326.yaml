    \   devices and device components within, or connected to, communication\n   networks.\
    \  The framework presents a physical reference model and\n   information model.\
    \  The information model consists of an Energy\n   Management Domain as a set\
    \ of Energy Objects.  Each Energy Object can\n   be attributed with identity,\
    \ classification, and context.  Energy\n   Objects can be monitored and controlled\
    \ with respect to power, Power\n   State, energy, demand, Power Attributes, and\
    \ battery.  Additionally,\n   the framework models relationships and capabilities\
    \ between Energy\n   Objects.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Network Management is often divided into the five main areas\
    \ defined\n   in the ISO Telecommunications Management Network model: Fault,\n\
    \   Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security Management\n   (FCAPS)\
    \ [X.700].  Not covered by this traditional management model is\n   Energy Management,\
    \ which is rapidly becoming a critical area of\n   concern worldwide, as seen\
    \ in [ISO50001].\n   This document defines an Energy Management framework for\
    \ devices\n   within, or connected to, communication networks, per the Energy\n\
    \   Management requirements specified in [RFC6988].  The devices, or the\n   components\
    \ of these devices (such as line cards, fans, and disks),\n   can then be monitored\
    \ and controlled.  Monitoring includes measuring\n   power, energy, demand, and\
    \ attributes of power.  Energy Control can\n   be performed by setting a device's\
    \ or component's state.  The devices\n   monitored by this framework can be either\
    \ of the following:\n   o  consumers of energy (such as routers and computer systems)\
    \ and\n      components of such devices (such as line cards, fans, and disks)\n\
    \   o  producers of energy (like an uninterruptible power supply or\n      renewable\
    \ energy system) and their associated components (such as\n      battery cells,\
    \ inverters, or photovoltaic panels)\n   This framework further describes how\
    \ to identify, classify, and\n   provide context for such devices.  While context\
    \ information is not\n   specific to Energy Management, some context attributes\
    \ are specified\n   in the framework, addressing the following use cases:\n  \
    \ o  How important is a device in terms of its business impact?\n   o  How should\
    \ devices be grouped for reporting and searching?\n   o  How should a device role\
    \ be described?\n   Guidelines for using context for Energy Management are described.\n\
    \   The framework introduces the concept of a Power Interface that is\n   analogous\
    \ to a network interface.  A Power Interface is defined as an\n   interconnection\
    \ among devices where energy can be provided, received,\n   or both.\n   The most\
    \ basic example of Energy Management is a single device\n   reporting information\
    \ about itself.  In many cases, however, energy\n   is not measured by the device\
    \ itself but is measured upstream in the\n   power distribution tree.  For example,\
    \ a Power Distribution Unit\n   (PDU) may measure the energy it supplies to attached\
    \ devices and\n   report this to an Energy Management System.  Therefore, devices\
    \ often\n   have relationships to other devices or components in the power\n \
    \  network.  An Energy Management System (EnMS) generally requires an\n   understanding\
    \ of the power topology (who provides power to whom), the\n   Metering topology\
    \ (who meters whom), and the potential Aggregation\n   (who aggregates values\
    \ of others).\n   The relationships build on the Power Interface concept.  The\n\
    \   different relationships among devices and components, as specified in\n  \
    \ this document, include power source, Metering, and Aggregation\n   Relationships.\n\
    \   The framework does not cover non-electrical equipment, nor does it\n   cover\
    \ energy procurement and manufacturing.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n   In this document, these words will appear with the above\n\
    \   interpretation only when in ALL CAPS.  Lowercase uses of these words\n   are\
    \ not to be interpreted as carrying the significance of RFC 2119\n   key words.\n\
    \   In this section, some terms have a NOTE that is not part of the\n   definition\
    \ itself but accounts for differences between terminologies\n   of different standards\
    \ organizations or further clarifies the\n   definition.\n   The terms are listed\
    \ in an order that aids in reading where terms may\n   build off a previous term,\
    \ as opposed to an alphabetical ordering.\n   Some terms that are common in electrical\
    \ engineering or that describe\n   common physical items use a lowercase notation.\n\
    \   Energy Management\n      Energy Management is a set of functions for measuring,\
    \ modeling,\n      planning, and optimizing networks to ensure that the network\
    \ and\n      network-attached devices use energy efficiently and appropriately\n\
    \      for the nature of the application and the cost constraints of the\n   \
    \   organization.\n      Reference: Adapted from [TMN].\n      NOTES:\n      1.\
    \ \"Energy Management\" refers to the activities, methods,\n         procedures,\
    \ and tools that pertain to measuring, modeling,\n         planning, controlling,\
    \ and optimizing the use of energy in\n         networked systems [NMF].\n   \
    \   2. Energy Management is a management domain that is congruent to\n       \
    \  any of the FCAPS areas of management in the ISO/OSI Network\n         Management\
    \ Model [TMN].  Energy Management for communication\n         networks and attached\
    \ devices is a subset or part of an\n         organization's greater Energy Management\
    \ Policies.\n   Energy Management System (EnMS)\n      An Energy Management System\
    \ is a combination of hardware and\n      software used to administer a network,\
    \ with the primary purpose of\n      Energy Management.\n      NOTES:\n      1.\
    \ An Energy Management System according to [ISO50001] (ISO-EnMS)\n         is\
    \ a set of systems or procedures upon which organizations can\n         develop\
    \ and implement an energy policy, set targets and action\n         plans, and\
    \ take into account legal requirements related to\n         energy use.  An ISO-EnMS\
    \ allows organizations to improve energy\n         performance and demonstrate\
    \ conformity to requirements,\n         standards, and/or legal requirements.\n\
    \      2. Example ISO-EnMS: Company A defines a set of policies and\n        \
    \ procedures indicating that there should exist multiple\n         computerized\
    \ systems that will poll energy measurements from\n         their meters and pricing\
    \ / source data from their local\n         utility.  Company A specifies that\
    \ their CFO (Chief Financial\n         Officer) should collect information and\
    \ summarize it quarterly\n         to be sent to an accounting firm to produce\
    \ carbon accounting\n         reporting as required by their local government.\n\
    \      3. For the purposes of EMAN, the definition herein is the\n         preferred\
    \ meaning of an EnMS.  The definition from [ISO50001]\n         can be referred\
    \ to as an ISO Energy Management System\n         (ISO-EnMS).\n   Energy Monitoring\n\
    \      Energy Monitoring is a part of Energy Management that deals with\n    \
    \  collecting or reading information from devices to aid in Energy\n      Management.\n\
    \   Energy Control\n      Energy Control is a part of Energy Management that deals\
    \ with\n      directing influence over devices.\n   electrical equipment\n   \
    \   This is a general term that includes materials, fittings, devices,\n     \
    \ appliances, fixtures, apparatus, machines, etc., that are used as\n      a part\
    \ of, or in connection with, an electric installation.\n      Reference: [IEEE100].\n\
    \   non-electrical equipment (mechanical equipment)\n      This is a general term\
    \ that includes materials, fittings, devices,\n      appliances, fixtures, apparatus,\

    \ or is capable of doing work.  As\n      used by electric utilities, it is generally\
    \ a reference to\n      electrical energy and is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).\n\
    \      Reference: [IEEE100].\n      NOTE:\n      1. Energy is the capacity of\
    \ a system to produce external activity\n         or perform work [ISO50001].\n\
    \   power\n      Power is the time rate at which energy is emitted, transferred,\

    \ Demand is expressed in\n      kilowatts, kilovolt-amperes, kilovars, or other\
    \ suitable units.\n      Reference: [IEEE100].\n      NOTE:\n      1. While IEEE100\
    \ defines demand in kilo measurements, for EMAN we\n         use watts with any\
    \ suitable metric prefix.\n   provide energy\n      A device (or component) \"\

    \ at a given point in an electrical\n      power system.\n      Reference: Adapted\
    \ from [IEC60050].\n      NOTE:\n      1. Power Attributes are not intended to\
    \ provide any bounds or\n         recommended range for the value.  They are simply\
    \ the reading\n         of the value associated with the attribute in question.\n\
    \   Power Quality\n      \"Power Quality\" refers to characteristics of the electrical\n\
    \      current, voltage, phase, and frequencies at a given point in an\n     \
    \ electric power system, evaluated against a set of reference\n      technical\

    \         information are typically required by customer facility Energy\n   \
    \      Management Systems.  Electrical characteristics are not\n         intended\
    \ to satisfy the detailed requirements of Power Quality\n         monitoring.\
    \  Standards typically also give ranges of allowed\n         values; the information\

- title: 3.  Target Devices
  contents:
  - "3.  Target Devices\n   With Energy Management, there exists a wide variety of\
    \ devices that\n   may be contained in the same deployment as a communication\
    \ network\n   but comprise a separate facility, home, or power distribution\n\
    \   network.\n   Energy Management has special challenges because a power distribution\n\
    \   network supplies energy to devices and components, while a separate\n   communications\
    \ network monitors and controls the power distribution\n   network.\n   The target\
    \ devices for Energy Management are all devices that can be\n   monitored or controlled\
    \ (directly or indirectly) by an Energy\n   Management System (EnMS).  These target\
    \ devices include, for example:\n   o  Simple electrical appliances and fixtures\n\
    \   o  Hosts, such as a PC, a server, or a printer\n   o  Switches, routers, base\
    \ stations, and other network equipment such\n      as middleboxes\n   o  Components\
    \ within devices, e.g., a line card inside a switch\n   o  Batteries functioning\
    \ as a device or component that is a store of\n      energy\n   o  Devices or\
    \ components that charge or produce energy, such as solar\n      cells, charging\
    \ stations, or generators\n   o  Power over Ethernet (PoE) endpoints\n   o  Power\
    \ Distribution Units (PDUs)\n   o  Protocol gateway devices for Building Management\
    \ Systems (BMS)\n   o  Electrical meters\n   o  Sensor controllers with subtended\
    \ sensors\n   Target devices include devices that communicate via the Internet\n\
    \   Protocol (IP) as well as devices using other means for communication.\n  \

  - "5.  Areas Not Covered by the Framework\n   While this framework is intended as\
    \ a framework for Energy Management\n   in general, there are some areas that\
    \ are not covered.\n   Non-Electrical Equipment\n      The primary focus of this\
    \ framework is the management of\n      electrical equipment.  Non-electrical\
    \ equipment, which is not\n      covered in this framework, could nevertheless\
    \ be modeled by\n      providing interfaces that comply with the framework: for\
    \ example,\n      using the same units for power and energy.  Therefore,\n   \
    \   non-electrical equipment that does not \"convert to\" or\n      \"present\
    \ as\" an entity equivalent to electrical equipment is not\n      addressed.\n\
    \   Energy Procurement and Manufacturing\n      While an EnMS may be a central\
    \ point for corporate reporting, cost\n      computation, environmental impact\
    \ analysis, and regulatory\n      compliance reporting, Energy Management in this\
    \ framework excludes\n      energy procurement and the environmental impact of\
    \ energy use.\n      As such, the framework does not include:\n      o  Cost in\
    \ currency or environmental units of manufacturing a\n         device\n      o\
    \  Embedded carbon or environmental equivalences of a device\n      o  Cost in\
    \ currency or environmental impact to dismantle or\n         recycle a device\n\
    \      o  Supply chain analysis of energy sources for device deployment\n    \
    \  o  Conversion of the usage or production of energy to units\n         expressed\
    \ from the source of that energy (such as the\n         greenhouse gas emissions\
    \ associated with the transfer of energy\n         from a diesel source)\n"

    \ to describe a\n   means to monitor and control devices and components.  The\
    \ model will\n   also need to describe the relationships among, and connections\n\
    \   between, devices and components.\n   This section defines a conceptual model\
    \ for devices and components\n   that is similar to the model used in Network\
    \ Management: devices,\n   components, and interfaces.  This section then defines\
    \ the additional\n   attributes specific to Energy Management for those entities\
    \ that are\n   not available in existing Network Management models.\n   For modeling\

  - "6.5.4.  Power State Set: IETF EMAN\n   The EMAN Power States are an expansion\
    \ of the basic Power States as\n   defined in [IEEE1621] plus the addition of\
    \ the Power States defined\n   in [ACPI] and [DMTF].  Therefore, in addition to\
    \ the non-operational\n   states as defined in [ACPI] and [DMTF] standards, several\n\
    \   intermediate operational states have been defined.\n   Physical devices and\
    \ components are expected to support the EMAN\n   Power State Set or to be modeled\
    \ via an Energy Object the supports\n   these states.\n   An Energy Object may\
    \ implement fewer or more Power States than a\n   particular EMAN Power State\
    \ Set specifies.  In that case, the Energy\n   Object implementation can determine\
    \ its own mapping to the predefined\n   EMAN Power States within the EMAN Power\
    \ State Set.\n   There are twelve EMAN Power States that expand on [IEEE1621].\
    \  The\n   expanded list of Power States is derived from [CISCO-EW] and is\n \
    \  divided into six operational states and six non-operational states.\n   The\
    \ lowest non-operational state is 0, and the highest is 5.  Each\n   non-operational\
    \ state corresponds to an [ACPI] Global and System\n   state between G3 (hard-off)\
    \ and G1 (sleeping).  Each operational\n   state represents a performance state\
    \ and may be mapped to [ACPI]\n   states P0 (maximum performance power) through\
    \ P5 (minimum performance\n   and minimum power).\n   In each of the non-operational\
    \ states (from mechoff(0) to ready(5)),\n   the Power State preceding it is expected\
    \ to have a lower Power value\n   and a longer delay in returning to an operational\
    \ state:\n      mechoff(0): An off state where no Energy Object features are\n\
    \         available.  The Energy Object is unavailable.  No energy is\n      \
    \   being consumed, and the power connector can be removed.\n      softoff(1):\
    \ Similar to mechoff(0), but some components remain\n         powered or receive\
    \ trace power so that the Energy Object can be\n         awakened from its off\
    \ state.  In softoff(1), no context is\n         saved, and the device typically\
    \ requires a complete boot when\n         awakened.\n      hibernate(2): No Energy\
    \ Object features are available.  The Energy\n         Object may be awakened\
    \ without requiring a complete boot, but\n         the time for availability is\
    \ longer than sleep(3).  An example\n         for state hibernate(2) is a save-to-disk\
    \ state where DRAM\n         context is not maintained.  Typically, energy consumption\
    \ is\n         zero or close to zero.\n      sleep(3): No Energy Object features\
    \ are available, except for\n         out-of-band management, such as wake-up\
    \ mechanisms.  The time\n         for availability is longer than standby(4).\
    \  An example for\n         state sleep(3) is a save-to-RAM state, where DRAM\
    \ context is\n         maintained.  Typically, energy consumption is close to\
    \ zero.\n      standby(4): No Energy Object features are available, except for\n\
    \         out-of-band management, such as wake-up mechanisms.  This mode\n   \
    \      is analogous to cold-standby.  The time for availability is\n         longer\
    \ than ready(5).  For example, processor context may not\n         be maintained.\
    \  Typically, energy consumption is close to zero.\n      ready(5): No Energy\
    \ Object features are available, except for\n         out-of-band management,\
    \ such as wake-up mechanisms.  This mode\n         is analogous to hot-standby.\
    \  The Energy Object can be quickly\n         transitioned into an operational\
    \ state.  For example,\n         processors are not executing, but processor context\
    \ is\n         maintained.\n      lowMinus(6): Indicates that some Energy Object\
    \ features may not be\n         available and the Energy Object has taken measures\
    \ or selected\n         options to use less energy than low(7).\n      low(7):\

- title: 6.6.  Relationships
  contents:
  - "6.6.  Relationships\n   The Energy Object (Class) contains a set of Relationship\
    \ (Class)\n   attributes to model the relationships between devices and components.\n\
    \   Two Energy Objects can establish an Energy Object Relationship to\n   model\
    \ the deployment topology with respect to Energy Management.\n   Relationships\
    \ are modeled with a Relationship (Class) that contains\n   the UUID of the other\
    \ participant in the relationship and a name that\n   describes the type of relationship\
    \ [CHEN].  The types of\n   relationships are Power Source, Metering, and Aggregations.\n\
    \   o  A Power Source Relationship is a relationship where one Energy\n      Object\
    \ provides power to one or more Energy Objects.  The Power\n      Source Relationship\
    \ gives a view of the physical wiring topology\n      -- for example, a data center\
    \ server receiving power from two\n      specific Power Interfaces from two different\
    \ PDUs.\n      Note: A Power Source Relationship may or may not change as the\n\
    \      direction of power changes between two Energy Objects.  The\n      relationship\
    \ may remain to indicate that the change of power\n      direction was unintended\
    \ or an error condition.\n   o  A Metering Relationship is a relationship where\
    \ one Energy Object\n      measures power, energy, demand, or Power Attributes\
    \ of one or more\n      other Energy Objects.  The Metering Relationship gives\
    \ the view of\n      the Metering topology.  Physical meters can be placed anywhere\
    \ in\n      a power distribution tree.  For example, utility meters monitor\n\
    \      and report accumulated power consumption of the entire building.\n    \
    \  Logically, the Metering topology overlaps with the wiring\n      topology,\
    \ as meters are connected to the wiring topology.  A\n      typical example is\
    \ meters that clamp onto the existing wiring.\n   o  An Aggregation Relationship\
    \ is a relationship where one Energy\n      Object aggregates Energy Management\
    \ information of one or more\n      other Energy Objects.  The Aggregation Relationship\
    \ gives a model\n      of devices that may aggregate (sum, average, etc.) values\
    \ for\n      other devices.  The Aggregation Relationship is slightly different\n\
    \      compared to the other relationships, as this refers more to a\n      management\
    \ function.\n   In some situations, it is not possible to discover the Energy\
    \ Object\n   Relationships, and an EnMS or administrator must set them.  Given\n\
    \   that relationships can be assigned manually, the following sections\n   describe\
    \ guidelines for use.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.6.1.  Relationship Conventions and Guidelines\n   This Energy Management framework\
    \ does not impose many \"MUST\" rules\n   related to Energy Object Relationships.\
    \  There are always corner\n   cases that can be excluded by making stricter specifications\
    \ for\n   relationships.  However, the framework proposes a series of\n   guidelines,\
    \ indicated with \"SHOULD\" and \"MAY\".\n"
- title: '6.6.2.  Guidelines: Power Source'
  contents:
  - "6.6.2.  Guidelines: Power Source\n   Power Source Relationships are intended\
    \ to identify the connections\n   between Power Interfaces.  This is analogous\
    \ to a Layer 2 connection\n   in networking devices (a \"one-hop connection\"\
    ).\n   The preferred modeling would be for Power Interfaces to participate\n \
    \  in Power Source Relationships.  In some cases, Energy Objects may not\n   have\
    \ the capability to model Power Interfaces.  Therefore, a Power\n   Source Relationship\
    \ can be established between two Energy Objects or\n   two non-connected Power\
    \ Interfaces.\n   Strictly speaking, while components and Power Interfaces on\
    \ the same\n   Device do provide or receive energy from each other, the Power\
    \ Source\n   Relationship is intended to show energy transfer between Devices.\n\
    \   Therefore, the relationship is implied when on the same Device.\n   An Energy\
    \ Object SHOULD NOT establish a Power Source Relationship\n   with a component.\n\
    \   o  A Power Source Relationship SHOULD be established with the next\n     \
    \ known Power Interface in the wiring topology.\n   o  The next known Power Interface\
    \ in the wiring topology would be the\n      next device implementing the framework.\
    \  In some cases, the domain\n      of devices under management may include some\
    \ devices that do not\n      implement the framework.  In these cases, the Power\
    \ Source\n      Relationship can be established with the next device in the\n\
    \      topology that implements the framework and logically shows the\n      Power\
    \ Source of the device.\n   o  Transitive Power Source Relationships SHOULD NOT\
    \ be established.\n      For example, if Energy Object A has a Power Source Relationship\n\
    \      \"Poweredby\" with Energy Object B, and if Energy Object B has a\n    \
    \  Power Source Relationship \"Poweredby\" with Energy Object C, then\n      Energy\
    \ Object A SHOULD NOT have a Power Source Relationship\n      \"Poweredby\" with\
    \ Energy Object C.\n"

    \   type can be seen as a set.\n   Some devices may include hardware that can\
    \ measure power for\n   components, outlets, or the entire device.  For example,\
    \ some PDUs\n   may have the ability to measure power for each outlet and are\n\

    \ power at each power outlet but can only measure power at the\n   power inlet\
    \ -- commonly referred to as metered-by-device.\n   While the Metering Relationship\
    \ could be used to represent a device\n   as metered-by-outlet or metered-by-device,\
    \ the Metering Relationship\n   SHOULD be used to model the relationship between\

    \ is to treat the missing value as zero (useful to have\n   continuous data streams).\n\

    \ or vulnerable\n   in some network environments.  It is important to control\
    \ GET and/or\n   NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to encrypt the values\
    \ of\n   these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.\n   The support\
    \ for SET operations in a non-secure environment without\n   proper protection\
    \ can have a negative effect on network operations.\n   For example:\n   o  Unauthorized\
    \ changes to the Energy Management Domain or business\n      context of a device\
    \ will result in misreporting or interruption of\n      power.\n   o  Unauthorized\

    \   o  Unauthorized changes to the demand history will disrupt proper\n      accounting\

    \ SNMPv3 did not\n   include adequate security.  Even if the network itself is\
    \ secure (for\n   example, by using IPsec), there is still no secure control over\
    \ who\n   on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET\n   (read/change/create/delete)\

    \ is not\n   recommended.  Instead, it is recommended to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n\
    \   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility\
