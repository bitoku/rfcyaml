  - "We have noticed a possible deadlock situation which may arise using the\nInitial\
    \ Connection Protocol (ICP) specified in Document #2 (NIC #7101 in\nthe Current\
    \ Network Protocols Notebook NIC #7104).\nIf on both sides one RFC is issued and\
    \ a \"wait for match\" is required\nbefore the second RFC is issued, it is possible\
    \ that the first RFC's\nwill not match.  In particular a deadlock will occur if\
    \ both sides open\ntheir send or both sides open their receive sockets first.\n\
    Briefly the ICP is:\n<where the original uses a script lowercase letter with a\
    \ single digit\nsubscript we use the lower case letter followed by {digit} so\
    \ that\nscript-m-subscript-2 is printed m{2}>\nServer                        \
    \        User\nS1:  Listen on socket L.              U1:  RTS(U, L, l{1})\nS2:\
    \  Wait for a match.                U2:  Wait for match.\nS3:  STR(L, U, s{1})\n\
    S4:  Wait for allocation.             U3:  All(l{1}, m{1}, b{1})\nS5:  Send data\
    \ S in s{1} bit          U4:  Receive data S in s{1}\n     bytes as allowed by\
    \                   bit bytes.\n     allocation m{1}, b{1}.\nS6:  CLS(L, U)  \
    \                      U5:  CLS(U, L)\nS7:  RTS(S, U+3, l{2})                U6:\
    \  STR(U+3, S, s{2})\nS8:  STR(S+1, U+2, s{3})              U7:  RTS(U+2, S+1,\
    \ l{3})\n\"The labels here imply no ordering except that ordering required by\
    \ the\nHost-Host Protocol.  Note that steps S7 and S8 can be reversed as can U6\n\
    and U7.  Also, notice that at any time after S2 the server could\ninitiate steps\
    \ S7 and S8 in parallel with steps S3 through S6, and that\nat any time after\
    \ U4 the user could initiate steps U6 and U7 in parallel\nwith step U5.\"\nissue\
    \ the RFC's in steps 6 and 7 without waiting for the server.  (If\nthe user is\
    \ only Listening then both Listens should be issued without\nwaiting for the server.)\
    \  If for some reason a host must delay between\nissuing RFC's it must issue the\
    \ RFC's involving sockets S and U+3 first.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by Robert\
    \ Barnes 6/97 ]\n"
