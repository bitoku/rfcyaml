  - "Abstract\n   This document defines requirements for signaling across different\n\
    \   network environments, such as across administrative and/or technology\n  \
    \ domains.  Signaling is mainly considered for Quality of Service (Qos)\n   such\
    \ as the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP).  However, in recent\n   years,\
    \ several other applications of signaling have been defined.\n   For example,\
    \ signaling for label distribution in Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS)\
    \ or signaling to middleboxes.  To achieve wide\n   applicability of the requirements,\
    \ the starting point is a diverse\n   set of scenarios/use cases concerning various\
    \ types of networks and\n   application interactions.  This document presents\
    \ the assumptions\n   before listing the requirements.  The requirements are grouped\n\
    \   according to areas such as architecture and design goals, signaling\n   flows,\
    \ layering, performance, flexibility, security, and mobility.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is the product of the Next Steps in Signaling\
    \ (NSIS)\n   Working Group.  It defines requirements for signaling across\n  \
    \ different network environments.  It does not list any problems of\n   existing\
    \ signaling protocols such as [RSVP].\n   In order to derive requirements for\
    \ signaling it is necessary to\n   first have an idea of the scope within which\
    \ they are applicable.\n   Therefore, we list use cases and scenarios where an\
    \ NSIS protocol\n   could be applied.  The scenarios are used to help derive requirements\n\
    \   and to test the requirements against use cases.\n   The requirements listed\
    \ are independent of any application.  However,\n   resource reservation and QoS\
    \ related issues are used as examples\n   within the text.  However, QoS is not\
    \ the only field where signaling\n   is used in the Internet.  Signaling might\
    \ also be used as a\n   communication protocol to setup and maintain the state\
    \ in middleboxes\n   [RFC3234].\n   This document does not cover requirements\
    \ in relation to some\n   networking areas, in particular, interaction with host\
    \ and site\n   multihoming.  We leave these for future analysis.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   We list the most often used terms in the document.  However,\
    \ they\n   cannot be made precise without a more complete architectural model,\n\
    \   and they are not meant to prescribe any solution in the document.\n   Where\
    \ applicable, they will be defined in protocol documents.\n   NSIS Entity (NE):\
    \ The function within a node, which implements an\n   NSIS protocol.  In the case\
    \ of path-coupled signaling, the NE will\n   always be on the data path.\n   NSIS\
    \ Forwarder (NF): NSIS Entity between a NI and NR, which may\n   interact with\
    \ local state management functions in the network.  It\n   also propagates NSIS\
    \ signaling further through the network.\n   NSIS Initiator (NI): NSIS Entity\
    \ that starts NSIS signaling to set up\n   or manipulate network state.\n   NSIS\
    \ Responder (NR): NSIS Entity that terminates NSIS signaling and\n   can optionally\
    \ interact with applications as well.\n   Flow: A traffic stream (sequence of\
    \ IP packets between two end\n   systems) for which a specific packet level treatment\
    \ is provided.\n   The flow can be unicast (uni- or bi-directional) or multicast.\
    \  For\n   multicast, a flow can diverge into multiple flows as it propagates\n\
    \   toward the receiver.  For multi-sender multicast, a flow can also\n   diverge\
    \ when viewed in the reverse direction (toward the senders).\n   Data Path: The\
    \ route across the networks taken by a flow or\n   aggregate, i.e., which domains/subdomains\
    \ it passes through and the\n   egress/ingress points for each.\n   Signaling\
    \ Path: The route across the networks taken by a signaling\n   flow or aggregate,\
    \ i.e., which domains/subdomains it passes through\n   and the egress/ingress\
    \ points for each.\n   Path-coupled signaling: A mode of signaling where the signaling\n\
    \   messages follow a path that is tied to the data packets.  Signaling\n   messages\
    \ are routed only through nodes (NEs) that are in the data\n   path.\n   Path-decoupled\
    \ signaling: Signaling with independent data and\n   signaling paths.  Signaling\
    \ messages are routed to nodes (NEs) which\n   are not assumed to be on the data\
    \ path, but which are (presumably)\n   aware of it.  Signaling messages will always\
    \ be directly addressed to\n   the neighbor NE, and the NI/NR may have no relation\
    \ at all with the\n   ultimate data sender or receiver.\n   Service: A generic\
    \ something provided by one entity and consumed by\n   another.  It can be constructed\
    \ by allocating resources.  The network\n   can provide it to users or a network\
    \ node can provide it to packets.\n"
- title: 3.  Problem Statement and Scope
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement and Scope\n   We provide in the following a preliminary\
    \ architectural picture as a\n   basis for discussion.  We will refer to it in\
    \ the following\n   requirement sections.\n   Note that this model is intended\
    \ not to constrain the technical\n   approach taken subsequently, simply to allow\
    \ concrete phrasing of\n   requirements (e.g., requirements about placement of\
    \ the NSIS\n   Initiator.)\n   Roughly, the scope of NSIS is assumed to be the\
    \ interaction between\n   the NSIS Initiator, NSIS Forwarder(s), and NSIS Responder\
    \ including a\n   protocol to carry the information, and the syntax/semantics\
    \ of the\n   information that is exchanged.  Further statements on\n   assumptions/exclusions\
    \ are given in the next Section.\n   The main elements are:\n   1. Something that\
    \ starts the request for state to be set up in the\n      network, the NSIS Initiator.\n\
    \      This might be in the end system or within some other part of the\n    \
    \  network.  The distinguishing feature of the NSIS Initiator is that\n      it\
    \ acts on triggers coming (directly or indirectly) from the\n      higher layers\
    \ in the end systems.  It needs to map the services\n      requested by them,\
    \ and also provides feedback information to the\n      higher layers, which might\
    \ be used by transport layer algorithms\n      or adaptive applications.\n   2.\
    \ Something that assists in managing state further along the\n      signaling\
    \ path, the NSIS Forwarder.\n      The NSIS Forwarder does not interact with higher\
    \ layers, but\n      interacts with the NSIS Initiator, NSIS Responder, and possibly\n\
    \      one or more NSIS Forwarders on the signaling path, edge-to-edge or\n  \
    \    end-to-end.\n   3. Something that terminates the signaling path, the NSIS\
    \ Responder.\n      The NSIS responder might be in an end-system or within other\n\
    \      equipment.  The distinguishing feature of the NSIS Responder is\n     \
    \ that it responds to requests at the end of a signaling path.\n   4. The signaling\
    \ path traverses an underlying network covering one or\n      more IP hops.  The\
    \ underlying network might use locally different\n      technology.  For instance,\
    \ QoS technology has to be provisioned\n      appropriately for the service requested.\
    \  In the QoS example, an\n      NSIS Forwarder maps service-specific information\
    \ to technology-\n      related QoS parameters and receives indications about\
    \ success or\n      failure in response.\n   5. We can see the network at the\
    \ level of domains/subdomains rather\n      than individual routers (except in\
    \ the special case that the\n      domain contains one link).  Domains are assumed\
    \ to be\n      administrative entities.  So security requirements might apply\n\
    \      differently for the signaling between the domains and within a\n      domain.\
    \  Both cases we deal with in this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Assumptions and Non-Assumptions\n   1. The NSIS signaling could run end-to-end,\
    \ end-to-edge, or edge-to-\n      edge, or network-to-network (between providers),\
    \ depending on what\n      point in the network acts as NSIS initiator, and how\
    \ far towards\n      the other end of the network the signaling propagates.  In\n\
    \      general, we could expect NSIS Forwarders to become more 'dense'\n     \
    \ towards the edges of the network, but this is not a requirement.\n      For\
    \ example, in the case of QoS, an over-provisioned domain might\n      contain\
    \ no NSIS Forwarders at all (and be NSIS transparent); at\n      the other extreme,\
    \ NSIS Forwarders might be placed at every\n      router.  In the latter case,\
    \ QoS provisioning can be carried out\n      in a local implementation-dependent\
    \ way without further signaling,\n      whereas in the case of remote NSIS Forwarders,\
    \ a protocol might be\n      needed to control the routers along the path.  This\
    \ protocol is\n      then independent of the end-to-end NSIS signaling.\n   2.\
    \ We do not consider 'pure' end-to-end signaling that is not\n      interpreted\
    \ anywhere within the network.  Such signaling is a\n      higher-layer issue\
    \ and IETF protocols such as SIP etc. can be\n      used.\n   3. Where the signaling\
    \ does cover several domains, we do not exclude\n      that different signaling\
    \ protocols are used in each domain.  We\n      only place requirements on the\
    \ universality of the control\n      information that is being transported.  (The\
    \ goals here would be\n      to allow the use of signaling protocols, which are\
    \ matched to the\n      characteristics of the portion of the network being traversed.)\n\
    \      Note that the outcome of NSIS work might result in various flavors\n  \
    \    of the same protocol.\n   4. We assume that the service definitions a NSIS\
    \ Initiator can ask\n      for are known in advance of the signaling protocol\
    \ running.  For\n      instance in the QoS example, the service definition includes\
    \ QoS\n      parameters, lifetime of QoS guarantee etc., or any other service-\n\
    \      specific parameters.\n      There are many ways service requesters get\
    \ to know about available\n      services.  There might be standardized services,\
    \ the definition\n      can be negotiated together with a contract, the service\
    \ definition\n      is published in some on-line directory (e.g., at a Web page),\
    \ and\n      so on.\n   5. We assume that there are means for the discovery of\
    \ NSIS entities\n      in order to know the signaling peers (solutions include\
    \ static\n      configuration, automatically discovered, or implicitly runs over\n\
    \      the right nodes along the data path, etc.).  The discovery of the\n   \
    \   NSIS entities has security implications that need to be addressed\n      properly.\
    \  For some security mechanisms (i.e., Kerberos, pre-\n      shared secret) it\
    \ is required to know the identity of the other\n      entity.  Hence the discovery\
    \ mechanism may provide means to learn\n      this identity, which is then later\
    \ used to retrieve the required\n      keys and parameters.\n   6. NSIS assumes\
    \ layer 3 routing and the determination of next data\n      node selection is\
    \ not done by NSIS.\n"

    \      protocols unchanged.  However, NSIS itself can be used for\n       signaling\

    \       generate new requirements for NSIS however.  For example, the\n      \

    \ underlying\n       assumption is that the route comes first (defining the path)\
    \ and\n       the signaling comes after it (following the path).  This doesn't\n\
    \       prevent a signaling application at some node interacting with\n      \
    \ something that modifies the path, but the requirement is then\n       just for\

    \ according to general technical aspects: architecture\n   and design goals, topology\
    \ issues, parameters, performance, security,\n   information, and flexibility.\n\
    \   Two general (and potentially contradictory) goals for the solution\n   are\
    \ that it should be applicable in a very wide range of scenarios,\n   and at the\
    \ same time be lightweight in implementation complexity and\n   resource consumption\

    \ in the discussion of some particular\n   requirements to refer to deployment\
    \ conditions where particular\n   protocol attributes, especially performance\
    \ characteristics, have\n   special importance.  Specifically, 'access' refers\
    \ to lower capacity\n   networks with fewer users and sessions.  'Core' refers\
    \ to high\n   capacity networks with a large number of users and sessions.\n \

- title: 8.1.  Terminal Mobility
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Terminal Mobility\n   The scenario we are looking at is the case where\
    \ a mobile terminal\n   (MT) changes from one access point to another access point.\
    \  The\n   access points are located in separate QoS domains.  We assume Mobile\n\
    \   IP to handle mobility on the network layer in this scenario and\n   consider\
    \ the various extensions (i.e., IETF proposals) to Mobile IP,\n   in order to\
    \ provide 'fast handover' for roaming Mobile Terminals.\n   The goal to be achieved\
    \ lies in providing, keeping, and adapting the\n   requested QoS for the ongoing\
    \ IP sessions in case of handover.\n   Furthermore, the negotiation of QoS parameters\
    \ with the new domain\n   via the old connection might be needed, in order to\
    \ support the\n   different 'fast handover' proposals within the IETF.\n   The\
    \ entities involved in this scenario include a mobile terminal,\n   access points,\
    \ an access network manager, and communication partners\n   of the MT (the other\
    \ end(s) of the communication association).  From\n   a technical point of view,\
    \ terminal mobility means changing the\n   access point of a mobile terminal (MT).\
    \  However, technologies might\n   change in various directions (access technology,\
    \ QoS technology,\n   administrative domain).  If the access points are within\
    \ one specific\n   QoS technology (independent of access technology) we call this\n\
    \   intra-QoS technology handoff.  In the case of an inter-QoS technology\n  \
    \ handoff, one changes from e.g., a DiffServ to an IntServ domain,\n   however\
    \ still using the same access technology.  Finally, if the\n   access points are\
    \ using different access technologies we call it\n   inter-technology hand-off.\n\
    \   The following issues are of special importance in this scenario:\n   1) Handoff\
    \ decision\n   -  The QoS management requests handoff.  The QoS management can\n\
    \      decide to change the access point, since the traffic conditions of\n  \
    \    the new access point are better supporting the QoS requirements.\n      The\
    \ metric may be different (optimized towards a single or a\n      group/class\
    \ of users).  Note that the MT or the network (see\n      below) might trigger\
    \ the handoff.\n   -  The mobility management forces handoff.  This can have several\n\
    \      reasons.  The operator optimizes his network, admission is no\n      longer\
    \ granted (e.g., emptied prepaid condition).  Or another\n      example is when\
    \ the MT is reaching the focus of another base\n      station.  However, this\
    \ might be detected via measurements of QoS\n      on the physical layer and is\
    \ therefore out of scope of QoS\n      signaling in IP.  Note again that the MT\
    \ or the network (see\n      below) might trigger the handoff.\n   -  This scenario\
    \ shows that local decisions might not be enough.  The\n      rest of the path\
    \ to the other end of the communication needs to be\n      considered as well.\
    \  Hand-off decisions in a QoS domain do not\n      only depend on the local resource\
    \ availability, e.g., the wireless\n      part, but involve the rest of the path\
    \ as well.  Additionally,\n      decomposition of an end-to-end signaling might\
    \ be needed, in order\n      to change only parts of it.\n   2) Trigger sources\n\
    \   -  Mobile terminal: If the end-system QoS management identifies\n      another\
    \ (better-suited) access point, it will request the handoff\n      from the terminal\
    \ itself.  This will be especially likely in the\n      case that two different\
    \ provider networks are involved.  Another\n      important example is when the\
    \ current access point bearer\n      disappears (e.g., removing the Ethernet cable).\
    \  In this case, the\n      NSIS Initiator is basically located on the mobile\
    \ terminal.\n   -  Network (access network manager): Sometimes, the handoff trigger\n\
    \      will be issued from the network management to optimize the overall\n  \
    \    load situation.  Most likely this will result in changing the\n      base-station\
    \ of a single providers network.  Most likely the NSIS\n      Initiator is located\
    \ on a system within the network.\n   3) Integration with other protocols\n  \
    \ -  Interworking with other protocol must be considered in one or the\n     \
    \ other form.  E.g., it might be worth combining QoS signaling\n      between\
    \ different QoS domains with mobility signaling at hand-\n      over.\n   4) Handover\
    \ rates\n   In mobile networks, the admission control process has to cope with\n\
    \   far more admission requests than call setups alone would generate.\n   For\
    \ example, in the GSM (Global System for Mobile communications)\n   case, mobility\
    \ usually generates an average of one to two handovers\n   per call.  For third\
    \ generation networks (such as UMTS), where it is\n   necessary to keep radio\
    \ links to several cells simultaneously\n   (macro-diversity), the handover rate\
    \ is significantly higher.\n   5) Fast state installation\n   Handover can also\
    \ cause packet losses.  This happens when the\n   processing of an admission request\
    \ causes a delayed handover to the\n   new base station.  In this situation, some\

    \ other users.  In the worst-case scenario, a delay in handover may\n   cause\

    \ of a wireless\n   system (such as the 3rd generation wireless system 3GPP/UMTS,\n\
    \   3GPP2/cdma2000).  The region between the End Host and the Edge Node\n   (Edge\
    \ Router) connecting the wireless network to another QoS domain\n   is considered\
    \ to be a single QoS domain.\n   The issues in such an environment regarding QoS\
    \ include:\n   1) The wireless networks provide their own QoS technology with\n\
    \      specialized parameters to coordinate the QoS provided by both the\n   \
    \   radio access and wired access networks.  Provisioning of QoS\n      technologies\
    \ within a wireless network can be described mainly in\n      terms of calling\
    \ bearer classes, service options, and service\n      instances.  These QoS technologies\
    \ need to be invoked with\n      suitable parameters when higher layers trigger\
    \ a request for QoS.\n      Therefore these involve mapping of the requested higher\
    \ layer QoS\n      parameters onto specific bearer classes or service instances.\
    \  The\n      request for allocation of resources might be triggered by\n    \
    \  signaling at the IP level that passes across the wireless system,\n      and\
    \ possibly other QoS domains.  Typically, wireless network\n      specific messages\
    \ are invoked to setup the underlying bearer\n      classes or service instances\
    \ in parallel with the IP layer QoS\n      negotiation, to allocate resources\
    \ within the radio access\n      network.\n   2) The IP signaling messages are\
    \ initiated by the NSIS initiator and\n      interpreted by the NSIS Forwarder.\
    \  The most efficient placement\n      of the NSIS Initiator and NSIS Forwarder\
    \ has not been determined\n      in wireless networks, but a few potential scenarios\
    \ can be\n      envisioned. The NSIS Initiator could be located at the End Host\n\
    \      (e.g., 3G User equipment (UE)), the Access Gateway or at a node\n     \
    \ that is not directly on the data path, such as a Policy Decision\n      Function.\
    \  The Access Gateway could act as a proxy NSIS Initiator\n      on behalf of\
    \ the End Host.  The Policy Decision Function that\n      controls per-flow/aggregate\
    \ resources with respect to the session\n      within its QoS domain (e.g., the\
    \ 3G wireless network) may act as a\n      proxy NSIS Initiator for the end host\
    \ or the Access Gateway.\n      Depending on the placement of the NSIS Initiator,\
    \ the NSIS\n      Forwarder may be located at an appropriate point in the wireless\n\
    \      network.\n   3) The need for re-negotiation of resources in a new wireless\

    \ re-negotiation of resources.\n"

    \ admission control in 3G wireless networks.  It receives\n   resource allocation/de-allocation\
    \ requests from the P-CSCF and/or\n   Access Gateway etc. and responds with policy\
    \ decisions.  Hence the\n   PDF may be a candidate entity to host the functionality\
    \ of the NSIS\n   Initiator, initiating the NSIS QoS signaling towards the backbone\
    \ IP\n   network.  On the other hand, the UE/MS may act as the NSIS Initiator\n\
    \   or the Access Gateway may act as a Proxy NSIS Initiator on behalf of\n   the\
    \ UE/MS.  In the former case, the P-CSCF/PDF has to do the mapping\n   from codec\
    \ types and media descriptors (derived from SIP/SDP\n   signaling) to IP traffic\
    \ descriptor.  In the latter case, the UE/MS\n   may use any appropriate QoS signaling\
    \ mechanism as the NSIS\n   Initiator.  If the Access Gateway is acting as the\
    \ Proxy NSIS\n   initiator on behalf of the UE/MS, then it may have to do the\
    \ mapping\n   of parameters from radio access specific QoS to IP QoS traffic\n\
    \   parameters before forwarding the request to the NSIS Forwarder.\n   The NSIS\
    \ Forwarder is currently not part of the standard 3G wireless\n   architecture.\
    \  However, to achieve end-to-end QoS a NSIS Forwarder is\n   needed such that\
    \ the NSIS Initiators can request a QoS connection to\n   the IP network.  As\
    \ in the previous example, the NSIS Forwarder could\n   manage a set of pre-provisioned\
    \ resources in the IP network, i.e.,\n   bandwidth pipes, and the NSIS Forwarder\
    \ perform per-flow admission\n   control into these pipes.  In this way, a connection\
    \ can be made\n   between two 3G wireless access networks, and hence, end-to-end\
    \ QoS\n   can be achieved.  In this case the NSIS Initiator and NSIS Forwarder\n\
    \   are clearly two separate logical entities.  The Access Gateway or/and\n  \
    \ the Edge Router in Fig.1 may contain the NSIS Forwarder\n   functionality, depending\
    \ upon the placement of the NSIS Initiator as\n   discussed in scenario 2 in section\
    \ 8.2.  This use case clearly\n   illustrates the need for an NSIS QoS signaling\
    \ protocol between NSIS\n   Initiator and NSIS Forwarder.  An important application\
    \ of such a\n   protocol may be its use in the end-to-end establishment of a\n\
    \   connection with specific QoS characteristics between a mobile host\n   and\
    \ another party (e.g., end host or content server).\n"

    \ of wireless network\n   Each of these parts of the wireless network impose different\
    \ issues\n   to be solved on the QoS signaling solution being used:\n   1) Wireless\
    \ interface: The solution for the air interface link has to\n      ensure flexibility\
    \ and spectrum efficient transmission of IP\n      packets.  However, this link\
    \ layer QoS can be solved in the same\n      way as any other last hop problem\
    \ by allowing a host to request\n      the proper QoS profile.\n   2) Wired part\
    \ of the wireless network:  This is the part of the\n      network that is closest\
    \ to the base stations/access routers.  It\n      is an IP network although some\
    \ parts logically perform tunneling\n      of the end user data.  In cellular\
    \ networks, the wired part of the\n      wireless network is denoted as a radio\
    \ access network.\n      This part of the wireless network has different requirements\
    \ for\n      signaling protocol characteristics when compared to traditional IP\n\
    \      networks:\n      -  The network must support mobility.  Many wireless networks\
    \ are\n         able to provide a combination of soft and hard handover\n    \
    \     procedures.  When handover occurs, reservations need to be\n         established\
    \ on new paths.  The establishment time has to be as\n         short as possible\
    \ since long establishment times for s degrade\n         the performance of the\
    \ wireless network.  Moreover, for maximal\n         utilization of the radio\
    \ spectrum, frequent handover operations\n         are required.\n      -  These\
    \ links are typically rather bandwidth-limited.\n      -  The wired transmission\
    \ in such a network contains a relatively\n         high volume of expensive leased\
    \ lines.  Overprovisioning might\n         therefore be prohibitively expensive.\n\
    \      -  The radio base stations are spread over a wide geographical\n      \
    \   area and are in general situated a large distance from the\n         backbone.\n\
    \   3) Backbone of the wireless network: the requirements imposed by this\n  \
    \    network are similar to the requirements imposed by other types of\n     \
    \ backbone networks.\n   Due to these very different characteristics and requirements,\
    \ often\n   contradictory, different QoS signaling solutions might be needed in\n\
    \   each of the three network parts.\n"

    \ due to packet loss, latency and jitter.\n   Signaling is used to identify and\
    \ admit a flow for which these\n   impairments are minimized.  In addition, the\
    \ disposition of the\n   signaling request is used to allow the PSTN GW to make\
    \ a call routing\n   decision before the call is actually accepted and delivered\
    \ to the\n   final destination.\n   PSTN gateways may handle thousands of calls\
    \ simultaneously and there\n   may be hundreds of PSTN gateways in a single provider\
    \ network.  These\n   numbers are likely to increase as the size of the network\
    \ increases.\n   The point being that scalability is a major issue.\n   There\

    \ trunks) for the individual\n      traffic flows.  This scenario is not further\
    \ considered here.\n   2. Out-of-band signaling in a single domain, the NSIS forwarder\
    \ is\n      integrated in the Media Gateway Controller (MGC).  In this case no\n\
    \      NSIS protocol is required.\n   3. Out-of-band signaling in a single domain,\
    \ the NSIS forwarder is a\n      separate box.  In this case NSIS signaling is\
    \ used between the MGC\n      and the NSIS Forwarder.\n   4. Out-of-band signaling\
    \ between multiple domains, the NSIS Forwarder\n      (which may be integrated\
    \ in the MGC) triggers the NSIS Forwarder\n      of the next domain.\n   When\
    \ the out-of-band QoS signaling is used the Media Gateway\n   Controller (MGC)\
    \ will be acting as the NSIS Initiator.\n   In the second scenario the voice provider\
    \ manages a set of traffic\n   trunks that are leased from a network provider.\
    \  The MGC does the\n   admission control in this case.  Since the NSIS Forwarder\
    \ acts both\n   as a NSIS Initiator and a NSIS Forwarder, no NSIS signaling is\n\
    \   required.  This scenario is shown in Figure 3.\n    +-------------+    ISUP/SIGTRAN\

  - "8.10.  An Application Requests End-to-End QoS Path from the Network\n   This\
    \ is actually the conceptually simplest case.  A multimedia\n   application requests\
    \ a guaranteed service from an IP network.  We\n   assume here that the application\
    \ is somehow able to specify the\n   network service.  The characteristics here\
    \ are that many hosts might\n   do it, but that the requested service is low capacity\
    \ (bounded by the\n   access line).  Note that there is an issue of scaling in\
    \ the number\n   of applications requesting this service in the core of the network.\n"
- title: 8.11.  QOS for Virtual Private Networks
  contents:
  - "8.11.  QOS for Virtual Private Networks\n   In a Virtual Private Network (VPN),\
    \ a variety of tunnels might be\n   used between its edges.  These tunnels could\
    \ be for example, IPSec,\n   GRE, and IP-IP.  One of the most significant issues\
    \ in VPNs is\n   related to how a flow is identified and what quality a flow gets.\
    \  A\n   flow identification might consist among others of the transport\n   protocol\
    \ port numbers.  In an IP-Sec tunnel this will be problematic\n   since the transport\
    \ protocol information is encrypted.\n   There are two types of L3 VPNs, distinguished\
    \ by where the endpoints\n   of the tunnels exist.  The endpoints of the tunnels\
    \ may either be on\n   the customer (CPE) or the provider equipment or provider\
    \ edge (PE).\n   Virtual Private networks are also likely to request bandwidth\
    \ or\n   other type of service in addition to the premium services the PSTN GW\n\
    \   are likely to use.\n"
- title: 8.11.1.  Tunnel End Points at the Customer Premises
  contents:
  - "8.11.1.  Tunnel End Points at the Customer Premises\n   When the endpoints are\
    \ the CPE, the CPE may want to signal across the\n   public IP network for a particular\
    \ amount of bandwidth and QoS for\n   the tunnel aggregate.  Such signaling may\
    \ be useful when a customer\n   wants to vary their network cost with demand,\
    \ rather than paying a\n   flat rate.  Such signaling exists between the two CPE\
    \ routers.\n   Intermediate access and edge routers perform the same exact call\n\
    \   admission control, authentication and aggregation functions performed\n  \
    \ by the corresponding routers in the PSTN GW scenario with the\n   exception\
    \ that the endpoints are the CPE tunnel endpoints rather than\n   PSTN GWs and\
    \ the 5-tuple used to describe the RTP flow is replaced\n   with the corresponding\
    \ flow spec to uniquely identify the tunnels.\n   Tunnels may be of any variety\
    \ (e.g., IP-Sec, GRE, IP-IP).\n   In such a scenario, NSIS would actually allow\
    \ partly for customer\n   managed VPNs, which means a customer can setup VPNs\
    \ by subsequent\n   NSIS signaling to various end-point.  Plus the tunnel end-points\
    \ are\n   not necessarily bound to an application.  The customer administrator\n\
    \   might be the one triggering NSIS signaling.\n"
- title: 8.11.2.  Tunnel End Points at the Provider Premises
  contents:
  - "8.11.2.  Tunnel End Points at the Provider Premises\n   In the case were the\
    \ tunnel end-points exist on the provider edge,\n   requests for bandwidth may\
    \ be signaled either per flow, where a flow\n   is defined from a customers address\
    \ space, or between customer sites.\n   In the case of per flow signaling, the\
    \ PE router must map the\n   bandwidth request to the tunnel carrying traffic\
    \ to the destination\n   specified in the flow spec.  Such a tunnel is a member\
    \ of an\n   aggregate to which the flow must be admitted.  In this case, the\n\
    \   operation of admission control is very similar to the case of the\n   PSTN\
    \ GW with the additional level of indirection imposed by the VPN\n   tunnel. \
    \ Therefore, authentication, accounting and policing may be\n   required on the\
    \ PE router.\n   In the case of per site signaling, a site would need to be\n\
    \   identified.  This may be accomplished by specifying the network\n   serviced\
    \ at that site through an IP prefix.  In this case, the\n   admission control\
    \ function is performed on the aggregate to the PE\n   router connected to the\
    \ site in question.\n"
