  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is a compilation of special IPv6 addresses\
    \ defined in\n   other RFCs.  It can be used as a checklist of invalid routing\n\
    \   prefixes for developing filtering policies for routes and IP packets.\n  \
    \ It does not discuss addresses that are assigned to operators and\n   users through\
    \ the Regional Internet Registries.\n   The document is structured by address\
    \ types.  The document format is\n   similar to [RFC3330].\n   Some tips about\
    \ filtering are given, but are not mandatory to\n   implement.\n   The addresses\
    \ listed in this document must not be hard-coded into\n   implementations.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Node-Scoped Unicast
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Node-Scoped Unicast\n   ::1/128 is the loopback address [RFC4291].\n  \
    \ ::/128 is the unspecified address [RFC4291].\n   These two addresses should\
    \ not appear on the public Internet.\n"
- title: 2.2.  IPv4-Mapped Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.2.  IPv4-Mapped Addresses\n   ::FFFF:0:0/96 are the IPv4-mapped addresses [RFC4291].\
    \  Addresses\n   within this block should not appear on the public Internet.\n"
- title: 2.3.  IPv4-Compatible Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.3.  IPv4-Compatible Addresses\n   ::<ipv4-address>/96 are the IPv4-compatible\

    \ on the public\n   Internet.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Link-Scoped Unicast
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Link-Scoped Unicast\n   fe80::/10 are the link-local unicast [RFC4291]\
    \ addresses.  Addresses\n   within this block should not appear on the public\
    \ Internet.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Unique-Local
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Unique-Local\n   fc00::/7 are the unique-local addresses [RFC4193].  Addresses\
    \ within\n   this block should not appear by default on the public Internet.\n\
    \   Procedures for advertising these addresses are further described in\n   [RFC4193].\n"
- title: 2.6.  Documentation Prefix
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Documentation Prefix\n   The 2001:db8::/32 are the documentation addresses\
    \ [RFC3849].  They\n   are used for documentation purposes such as user manuals,\
    \ RFCs, etc.\n   Addresses within this block should not appear on the public Internet.\n"
- title: 2.7.  6to4
  contents:
  - "2.7.  6to4\n   2002::/16 are the 6to4 addresses [RFC3056].  The 6to4 addresses\
    \ may\n   be advertised when the site is running a 6to4 relay or offering a\n\
    \   6to4 transit service.  Running such a service [RFC3964] entails\n   filtering\
    \ rules specific to 6to4 [RFC3964].  IPv4 addresses\n   disallowed in 6to4 prefixes\
    \ are listed in section 5.3.1 of [RFC3964].\n"
- title: 2.8.  Teredo
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Teredo\n   2001::/32 are the Teredo addresses [RFC4380].  The Teredo addresses\n\
    \   may be advertised when the site is running a Teredo relay or offering\n  \
    \ a Teredo transit service.\n"
- title: 2.9.  6bone
  contents:
  - "2.9.  6bone\n   5f00::/8 were the addresses of the first instance of the 6bone\n\
    \   experimental network [RFC1897].\n   3ffe::/16 were the addresses of the second\
    \ instance of the 6bone\n   experimental network [RFC2471].\n   Both 5f00::/8\
    \ and 3ffe::/16 were returned to IANA [RFC3701].  These\n   addresses are subject\
    \ to future allocation, similar to current\n   unallocated address space.  Addresses\
    \ within these blocks should not\n   appear on the public Internet until they\
    \ are reallocated.\n"
- title: 2.10.  ORCHID
  contents:
  - "2.10.  ORCHID\n   2001:10::/28 are Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash IDentifiers\n\
    \   (ORCHID) addresses [RFC4843].  These addresses are used as\n   identifiers\
    \ and are not routable at the IP layer.  Addresses within\n   this block should\
    \ not appear on the public Internet.\n"
- title: 2.11.  Default Route
  contents:
  - "2.11.  Default Route\n   ::/0 is the default unicast route address.\n"
- title: 2.12.  IANA Special-Purpose IPv6 Address Registry
  contents:
  - "2.12.  IANA Special-Purpose IPv6 Address Registry\n   An IANA registry (iana-ipv6-special-registry)\
    \ exists [RFC4773] for\n   Special-Purpose IPv6 address block assignments for\
    \ experiments and\n   other purposes.  Addresses within this registry should be\
    \ reviewed\n   for Internet routing considerations.\n"
- title: 2.13.  Multicast
  contents:
  - "2.13.  Multicast\n   ff00::/8 are multicast addresses [RFC4291].  They contain\
    \ a 4-bit\n   scope in the address field where only some values are of global\
    \ scope\n   [RFC4291].  Only addresses with global scope in this block may appear\n\
    \   on the public Internet.\n   Multicast routes must not appear in unicast routing\
    \ tables.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Filtering the invalid routing prefixes listed\
    \ in this document should\n   improve the security of networks.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   To ensure consistency and to provide cross-referencing\
    \ for the\n   benefit of the community, IANA has inserted the following paragraph\n\
    \   in the header of the iana-ipv6-special-registry.\n   \"Other special IPv6\
