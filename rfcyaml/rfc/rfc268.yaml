  - "                    Graphics Facilities Information\n   It was suggested at the\
    \ recent network graphics meeting (@ SAIL\n   21-23 November) that it would be\
    \ a good idea to include in the Resources\n   Notebook information about the graphics\
    \ facilities at each site.  To\n   further this proposal, I request that the Technical\
    \ Liaison (or other\n   knowledgeable person) at each site send me a description\
    \ of their\n   graphics facilities for inclusion in the Resources Notebook.\n\
    \   [It is not intended that this replace any other mechanism for up-\n   dating\
    \ Resource Notebook entries and the information collected will\n   be submitted\
    \ to the normal editorial procedures.]\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp.\
    \ under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96\
    \   ]\n"
