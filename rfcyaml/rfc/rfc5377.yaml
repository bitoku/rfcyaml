- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Under the current operational and administrative structures,\
    \ IETF\n   intellectual property rights are vested in the IETF Trust\n   administered\
    \ by a board of trustees made up of the members of the\n   IAOC [RFC4371].  This\
    \ includes the right to make use of IETF\n   Contributions, as granted by Contributors\
    \ under the rules laid out in\n   [RFC5378].  The Trustees of the IETF Trust are\
    \ therefore responsible\n   for defining the rights to copy granted by the IETF\
    \ to people who\n   wish to make use of the material in these documents.\n   For\
    \ consistency and clarity, this document uses the same terminology\n   laid out\
    \ in [RFC5378] and uses the same meanings as defined in that\n   document.\n \
    \  The IETF Trust, by way of its Trustees, has indicated, as is\n   consistent\
    \ with the IETF structure, that it will respect the wishes\n   of the IETF in\
    \ regard to what these granted rights ought to be.  It\n   is therefore the IETF's\
    \ responsibility to articulate those wishes.\n   This document represents the\
    \ wishes of the IETF regarding the rights\n   granted to all users in regard to\
    \ IETF Contributions, until it is\n   superseded.\n"
- title: 2.  Purpose in Granting Rights
  contents:
  - "2.  Purpose in Granting Rights\n   In providing a description of the wishes of\
    \ the IETF with regard to\n   rights granted in RFCs, it is helpful to keep in\
    \ mind the purpose of\n   granting such rights.\n   The mission of the IETF is\
    \ to produce documents that make the\n   Internet work better (see [RFC3935] for\
    \ more details).  These\n   documents, when completed, are published as RFCs.\n\
    \   An important subclass of RFCs is standards describing protocols; for\n   these,\
    \ the primary value to the Internet is the ability of\n   implementors to build\
    \ solutions (products, software, etc.) that\n   interoperate using these standards.\
    \  Hence, the IETF has a strong\n   interest in seeing accurate, interoperable\
    \ implementations of the\n   material the IETF publishes.  The IETF Trust grants\
    \ rights to copy to\n   people to make use of the text in the RFCs in order to\
    \ encourage\n   accurate and interoperable implementations.\n   As early implementations\
    \ from Internet-Drafts make use of\n   descriptions in those Internet-Drafts,\
    \ similar desires apply to\n   Internet-Drafts.\n   Similar considerations also\
    \ apply to non-standard, non-protocol\n   documents such as BCP (Best Current\
    \ Practice) and Informational\n   documents; in this document, we recommend a\
    \ common approach to the\n   issue of right-to-use licenses for all IETF documents.\n\
    \   Previous documents regarding rights in IETF documents have included\n   in\
    \ the RFC text specific text to be used to achieve the stated goals.\n   This\
    \ has proved problematic.  When problems are found with such text,\n   even when\
    \ the problem is not a change in intent, it is necessary to\n   revise the RFC\
    \ to fix the problem.  At best, this delays fixing legal\n   issues that need\
    \ prompt attention.  As such, this document describes\n   the IETF desires to\
    \ the Trustees of the IETF Trust, but does not\n   provide the specific legal\
    \ wording to address the goals.  The\n   selection, and updating as necessary,\
    \ of legal wording is left to the\n   Trustees of the IETF Trust.  Appeals of\
    \ the actions of the Trustees\n   of the IETF Trust are governed by other documents.\
    \  As the Trustees\n   are the members of the IAOC, the appeals procedure documented\
    \ in BCP\n   101 (currently [RFC4371]) is applicable.\n"
- title: 3.  Powers and Authority
  contents:
  - "3.  Powers and Authority\n   As described in the introduction, and formally specified\
    \ in\n   [RFC5378], the legal authority for determining and granting users\n \
    \  rights to copy material in RFCs and other IETF Contributions rests\n   with\
    \ the Trustees for the IETF Trust, which is made up of the members\n   of the\
    \ IAOC, as described in [RFC4071] and [RFC4371].  This document\n   provides guidance\
    \ to that body, based on the rough consensus of the\n   IETF.  The Trustees of\
    \ the IETF Trust have the authority and\n   responsibility to determine the exact\
    \ text insertions (or other\n   mechanisms), if any, needed in Internet-Drafts,\
    \ RFCs, and all IETF\n   Contributions to meet these goals.  The IETF Trust License\
    \ Policy is\n   available from http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info.\n   The rough\
    \ consensus described in this document reflects the agreement\n   of the IETF\
    \ as of the IETF Last Call, and the Trustees of the IETF\n   Trust are to begin\
    \ drafting license text and other materials to act\n   on these instructions upon\
    \ IESG approval of this document for RFC\n   publication.  Changes to the IETF\
    \ documentation, and document\n   policies themselves, take effect as determined\
    \ by the Trustees of the\n   IETF Trust.\n   This document does not specify what\
    \ rights the IETF Trust receives\n   from others in IETF Contributions.  That\
    \ is left to another document\n   ([RFC5378]).  While care has been taken by the\
    \ working group in\n   developing this document, and care will be taken by the\
    \ Trustees of\n   the IETF Trust, to see that sufficient rights are granted to\
    \ the IETF\n   Trust in IETF Contributions, it is also the case that the Trust\
    \ can\n   not grant rights it has not or does not receive, and it is expected\n\
    \   that policies will be in line with that fact.  Similarly, the rights\n   granted\
    \ for pre-existing documents can not be expanded unless the\n   holders of rights\
    \ in those Contributions choose to grant expanded\n   rights.  Nonetheless, to\
    \ the degree it can, and without embarking on\n   a massive effort, it is desirable\
    \ if similar rights to those\n   described below can be granted in older RFCs.\n"
- title: 4.  Recommended Grants of Right to Copy
  contents:
  - "4.  Recommended Grants of Right to Copy\n   The IETF grants rights to copy and\
    \ modify parts of IETF Contributions\n   in order to meet the objectives described\
    \ earlier.  As such,\n   different circumstances and different parts of documents\
    \ may need\n   different grants.  This section contains subsections for each such\n\
    \   different grant that is currently envisioned.  Each section is\n   intended\
    \ to describe a particular usage, to describe how that usage\n   is recognizable,\
    \ and to provide guidance to the Trustees of the IETF\n   Trust as to what rights\
    \ the IETF would like to see granted in that\n   circumstance and what limitations\
    \ should be put on such granting.\n   These recommendations for outgoing rights\
    \ are structured around the\n   assumptions documented in [RFC5378].  Thus, this\
    \ document is about\n   granting rights derived from those granted to the IETF\
    \ Trust.  The\n   recommendations below are how those granted rights should in\
    \ turn be\n   passed on to others using IETF documents in ways and for purposes\n\
    \   that fit with the goals of the IETF.  This discussion is also\n   separate\
    \ from discussion of the rights the IETF itself requires in\n   documents to do\
    \ its job, as those are not \"outbound\" rights.  It is\n   expected that the\
    \ rights granted to the IETF will be a superset of\n   those copying rights we\
    \ wish to grant to others.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Rights Granted for Reproduction of RFCs
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Rights Granted for Reproduction of RFCs\n   It has long been IETF policy\
    \ to encourage copying of RFCs in full.\n   This permits wide dissemination of\
    \ the material, without risking loss\n   of context or meaning.  The IETF wishes\
    \ to continue to permit anyone\n   to make full copies and translations of RFCs.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Rights Granted for Quoting from IETF Contributions
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Rights Granted for Quoting from IETF Contributions\n   There is rough consensus\
    \ that it is useful to permit quoting without\n   modification of excerpts from\
    \ IETF Contributions.  Such excerpts may\n   be of any length and in any context.\
    \  Translation of quotations is\n   also to be permitted.  All such quotations\
    \ should be attributed\n   properly to the IETF and the IETF Contribution from\
    \ which they are\n   taken.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Rights Granted for Implementing Based on IETF Contributions
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Rights Granted for Implementing Based on IETF Contributions\n   IETF Contributions\
    \ often include components intended to be directly\n   processed by a computer.\
    \  Examples of these include ABNF definitions,\n   XML Schemas, XML DTDs, XML\
    \ RelaxNG definitions, tables of values,\n   MIBs, ASN.1, and classical programming\
    \ code.  These are included in\n   IETF Contributions for clarity and precision\
    \ in specification.  It is\n   clearly beneficial, when such items are included\
    \ in IETF\n   Contributions, to permit the inclusion of such code components in\n\
    \   products that implement the Contribution.  It has been pointed out\n   that\
    \ in several important contexts, use of such code requires the\n   ability to\
    \ modify the code.  One common example of this is simply the\n   need to adapt\
    \ code for use in specific contexts (languages,\n   compilers, tool systems, etc.)\
    \  Such use frequently requires some\n   changes to the text of the code from\
    \ the IETF Contribution.  Another\n   example is that code included in open source\
    \ products is frequently\n   licensed to permit any and all of the code to be\
    \ modified.  Since we\n   want this code included in such products, it follows\
    \ that we need to\n   permit such modification.  While there has been discussion\
    \ of\n   restricting in some way the rights to make such modifications, the\n\
    \   rough consensus of the IETF is that such restrictions are likely a\n   bad\
    \ idea, and are certainly very complex to define.\n   As such, the rough consensus\
    \ is that the IETF Trust is to grant\n   rights such that code components of IETF\
    \ Contributions can be\n   extracted, modified, and used by anyone in any way\
    \ desired.  To\n   enable the broadest possible extraction, modification, and\
    \ usage, the\n   IETF Trust should avoid adding software license obligations beyond\n\
    \   those already present in a Contribution.  The granted rights to\n   extract,\
    \ modify, and use code should allow creation of derived works\n   outside the\
    \ IETF that may carry additional license obligations.  As\n   the IETF Trust can\
    \ not grant rights it does not receive, the rights\n   to extract, modify, and\
    \ use code described in this paragraph can not\n   be granted in IETF Contributions\
    \ that are explicitly marked as not\n   permitting derivative works.\n   While\
    \ it is up to the Trustees of the IETF Trust to determine the\n   best way of\
    \ meeting this objective, two mechanisms are suggested here\n   that are believed\
    \ to be helpful in documenting the intended grant to\n   readers and users of\
    \ IETF Contributions.\n   Firstly, the Trustees of the IETF Trust should maintain,\
    \ in a\n   suitable, easily accessible fashion, a list of common RFC components\n\
    \   that will be considered to be code.  To start, this list should\n   include\
    \ at least the items listed above.  The Trustees of the IETF\n   Trust will add\
    \ to this list as they deem suitable or as they are\n   directed by the IETF.\n\
    \   Additionally, the Trustees of the IETF Trust should define a textual\n   representation\
    \ to be included in an IETF Contribution to indicate\n   that a portion of the\
    \ document is considered by the authors (and\n   later, the working group, and\
    \ upon approval, the IETF) to be code and\n   thus subject to the permissions\
    \ granted to use code.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Rights Granted for Use of Text from IETF Contributions
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Rights Granted for Use of Text from IETF Contributions\n   There is no\
    \ consensus at this time to permit the use of text from\n   RFCs in contexts where\
    \ the right to modify the text is required.  The\n   authors of IETF Contributions\
    \ may be able and willing to grant such\n   rights independently of the rights\
    \ they have granted to the IETF by\n   making the Contribution.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Additional Licenses for IETF Contributions
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Additional Licenses for IETF Contributions\n   There have been contexts\
    \ where the material in an IETF Contribution\n   is also available under other\
    \ license terms.  The IETF wishes to be\n   able to include content that is available\
    \ under such licenses.  It is\n   desirable to indicate in the IETF Contribution\
    \ that other licenses\n   are available.  It would be inappropriate and confusing\
    \ if such\n   additional licenses restricted the rights the IETF intends to grant\n\
    \   in the content of RFCS.\n   However, the IETF does not wish to have IETF Contributions\
    \ contain\n   additional licenses, as that introduces a number of additional\n\
    \   difficulties.  Specifically, additional text in the document, and any\n  \
    \ additional license referred to by permitted additional text, must not\n   in\
    \ any way restrict the rights the IETF intends to grant to others\n   for using\
    \ the contents of IETF Contributions.\n   Authors of Contributions retain all\
    \ rights in their Contributions.\n   As such, an author may directly grant any\
    \ rights they wish separately\n   from what the IETF grants.  However, a reader\
    \ wishing to determine or\n   make use of such grants will need to either consult\
    \ external sources\n   of information, possibly including open source code and\
    \ documents, or\n   contact the author directly.\n"
