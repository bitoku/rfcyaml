- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document establishes an IANA registry for Level of\
    \ Assurance\n   (LoA) Profiles.\n   [SAML] provides the following definition of\
    \ the concept of \"level of\n   assurance\":\n      Many existing (and potential)\
    \ SAML federation deployments have\n      adopted a \"levels of assurance\" (or\
    \ LOA) model for categorizing\n      the wide variety of authentication methods\
    \ into a small number of\n      levels, typically based on some notion of the\
    \ strength of the\n      authentication.  Federation members (service providers\
    \ or \"relying\n      parties\") then decide which level of assurance is required\
    \ to\n      access specific protected resources, based on some assessment of\n\
    \      \"value\" or \"risk\".\n   Another definition of an \"assurance level\"\
    \ is given in RFC 4949\n   [RFC4949], which also identifies the roots of such\
    \ profiles in the\n   NIST special publication series, in particular SP 800-63\
    \ [SP63].\n   Level of Assurance Profiles are used in various protocols, including\n\
    \   the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) version 2.0 and OpenID\n   Connect.\n\
    \   Several so-called trust frameworks and identity federations now\n   exist,\
    \ some of which define one or more LoAs.  The purpose of this\n   specification\
    \ is to create an IANA registry where such LoA\n   definitions can be discovered.\
    \  While the quote above references\n   SAML, the notion of a level of assurance\
    \ has gained widespread\n   acceptance and should be treated as a protocol-independent\
    \ concept.\n   The newly created IANA registry attempts to reflect this.\n   Although\
    \ the registry will contain URIs that reference SAML\n   Authentication Context\
    \ Profiles, other protocols may use such URIs to\n   identify level of assurance\
    \ definitions without relying on or\n   transmitting their SAML XML definitions.\
    \  Use of the registry by\n   protocols other than SAML is encouraged.\n   For\
    \ instance, OpenID Connect defines the standard claim 'acr' as a\n   identifier\
    \ that may reference a SAML Authentication Context Class\n   even though OpenID\
    \ Connect is not itself based on XML or SAML.\n   Protocol designers who want\
    \ to reference the registry should be aware\n   that registered LoAs may depend\
    \ on assumptions that do not carry over\n   to all protocols and that such assumptions\
    \ may vary among the\n   protocols for which the LoAs were originally registered.\n"
- title: 2.  Name of Registry
  contents:
  - "2.  Name of Registry\n   The name of the registry shall be \"Level of Assurance\
    \ (LoA) Profile\",\n   in plural \"Level of Assurance (LoA) Profiles\".\n"
- title: 3.  Registration Template
  contents:
  - "3.  Registration Template\n   The following information must be provided with\
    \ each registration:\n   URI:  A URI referencing a Level of Assurance Profile.\
    \  This is the\n      registry key.\n   Context Class:  A valid XML schema definition\
    \ for the SAML 2.0 LoA\n      Context Class fulfilling the requirements of [SAML].\
    \  The registry\n      key (the URI) is the unique identifier for the Context\
    \ Class.\n   Name:  A string uniquely and unambiguously identifying the LoA for\n\
    \      use in protocols where URIs are not appropriate.\n   Informational URL:\
    \  A URL containing auxiliary information.  This URL\n      must minimally reference\
    \ contact information for the\n      administrative authority of the level of\
    \ assurance definition and\n      must use either the http or https scheme.\n\
    \   Note that it is possible for a single SAML Authentication Context\n   Class\
    \ to contain definitions of multiple URIs.  In that case, a\n   separate registration\
    \ is to be used for each URI.  Both the name and\n   the URI are to uniquely and\
    \ unambiguously identify the LoA.  The name\n   is meant to be used in protocols\
    \ where URIs are not appropriate.  In\n   addition the requester is expected to\
    \ provide basic contact\n   information and the name of the organization on behalf\
    \ of which the\n   LoA definition is registered.\n   The name is defined by the\
    \ following ABNF (as defined in RFC 5234\n   [RFC5234]):\n   label = ( ALPHA /\
    \ DIGIT )\n   name = label 1*( label / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" )\n   The elements\
    \ defined by the following ABNF productions represent a\n   set of reserved values\
    \ for the name element and are not to be\n   registered:\n   reserved = loa /\
    \ al / num\n   loa = ( \"l\" / \"L\" ) ( \"o\" / \"O\" ) ( \"a\" / \"A\") *DIGIT\n\
    \   al = ( \"a\" / \"A\") ( \"l\" / \"L\") *DIGIT\n   num = *DIGIT\n   The reason\
    \ for excluding these productions is a desire to avoid a\n   race to register\
    \ overly generic LoA Profiles under names like \"AL1\"\n   or \"LOA2\".\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Note on the Example\n   The example is borrowed (slightly modified) from\
    \ [SAML].  The example\n   should not be registered.\n"
- title: 4.  Registration Policy
  contents:
  - "4.  Registration Policy\n   The registry is to be operated under the \"Expert\
    \ Review\" policy from\n   RFC 5226 [RFC5226], employing a pool of experts.  IANA\
    \ will be kindly\n   asked to do rough, randomized load-balancing among the experts\
    \ and\n   also to perform an initial review of each submission to ensure that\n\
    \   the name and URI are unique within the registry.  The review criteria\n  \
    \ are outlined below.\n   For registrations that reference multiple LoAs in a\
    \ consistent set of\n   policies -- for instance, when a trust framework defines\
    \ multiple\n   levels of assurance -- the registered LoA name and URIs should\
    \ be\n   consistently named so that they can be identified as belonging to the\n\
    \   same set of registrations.  For instance, fruitLoA1, fruitLoA2, and\n   fruitLoA3\
    \ are preferred over apple, pear, and banana when these names\n   refer to a single\
    \ set of policies defining three LoAs.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Reviewer Expectations
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Reviewer Expectations\n   The expectation of the IANA LoA Registry is that\
    \ it will contain\n   registrations of bona fide Level of Assurance Profiles while\
    \ not\n   presenting a very high bar for entry.\n   Expert reviewers are expected\
    \ to verify that:\n   o  the registration is consistent and that the provided\
    \ XML fulfills\n      the requirements of [SAML].\n   o  the name element is clearly\
    \ associated with the registered LoA\n      Profile and is not a reserved value.\n\
    \   o  the URI and name elements are not already registered.\n   o  the Informational\
    \ URL can be expected to be stable and permanent.\n   Note that multiple registrations\
    \ may share a common Informational\n   URL.\n   The reviewers should exclude registrations\
    \ where the name does not\n   unambiguously identify the LoA definition or where\
    \ the name is a\n   simple variation on one of the reserved names.\n   Expert\
    \ reviewers are expected to allow registrations made in good\n   faith that fulfill\
    \ these requirements.\n"
- title: 5.  Registry Semantics
  contents:
  - "5.  Registry Semantics\n   The intended use for this registry is to serve as\
    \ a basis for\n   discovery of LoA definitions that might, for instance, be used\
    \ by\n   protocol-specific (e.g., SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect) management\n   tools.\n\
    \   Note that consumers of the registry, being implementations of [SAML],\n  \
    \ are expected to allow configuration of LoA URIs at system deployment\n   time.\
    \  If multiple sources of LoA URIs are permitted in addition to\n   the registry\
    \ (e.g., manual input), then it is important to avoid\n   collisions with URIs\
    \ found in the registry.\n   The presence of an entry in the registry does not\
    \ imply any semantics\n   or quality beyond that which results from the review\
    \ done by the\n   expert reviewer as part of the registration process.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document sets up a registry with IANA, making\
    \ the whole document\n   a set of considerations for IANA.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The registry is not a federation or trust framework.\
    \  Consumers of\n   the registry are strongly advised to review the information\
    \ about an\n   LoA before relying on it.\n"

  contents:
  - "8.  Acknowledgements\n   RL \"Bob\" Morgan, Scott Cantor, Lucy Lynch, and John\
    \ Bradley were\n   involved in the initial discussions around this idea and contributed\n\
    \   to the semantics of the registry.  The various versions of the\n   document\
    \ were socialized in the Kantara Federation Interoperability\n   WG and in other\
