Abstract This document moves "
Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers Considered Harmful" (RFC 3627) to Historic status to reflect the updated guidance contained in "Using 127 Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter  Router Links" (RFC 6164).
A Standards Track document supersedes an informational document; therefore, guidance provided in RFC 6164 is to be followed when the two documents are in conflict.
This document links the two RFCs so that the IETF's updated guidance on this topic is clearer.
Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers Considered Harmful
" [RFC3627] to Historic status in accordance with RFC 2026
RFC 3627 has been superseded by "Using 127 Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter Router Links"
A Standards Track document supersedes an informational document; therefore, guidance provided in RFC 6164 is to be followed when the two documents are in conflict.
This may not have been clear to casual readers who are not familiar with the differences in IETF document types.
This document adds the necessary link between the two RFCs so that users referring to RFC 3627 for guidance will see that it has been obsoleted by updated guidance on the matter, thus hopefully eliminating any confusion that may be present.
This document introduces no new security considerations.
