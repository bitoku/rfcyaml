  contents:
  - "1.1.  Notations Used in This Document\n   This document uses hexadecimal notation.\
    \  Each octet (that is, 8-bit\n   byte) is represented by two hexadecimal digits\
    \ giving the value of\n   the octet as an unsigned integer.  Successive octets\
    \ are separated by\n   a hyphen.  This document consistently uses IETF bit ordering\
    \ although\n   the physical order of bit transmission within an octet on an IEEE\n\
    \   [802.3] link is from the lowest order bit to the highest order bit\n   (i.e.,\
    \ the reverse of the IETF's ordering).\n   In this document:\n   \"IAB\" stands\
    \ for Individual Address Block, not for Internet\n         Architecture Board;\n\
    \   \"MAC\" stands for Media Access Control, not for Message Authentication\n\
    \         Code; and\n   \"OUI\" stands for Organizationally Unique Identifier.\n\
    \   \"**\"  indicates exponentiation.  For example, 2**24 is two to the\n    \
    \     twenty-fourth power.\n"

- title: 2.1.  48-Bit MAC Identifiers and OUIs
  contents:
  - "2.1.  48-Bit MAC Identifiers and OUIs\n   48-bit MAC \"addresses\" are the most\
    \ commonly used Ethernet interface\n   identifiers.  Those that are globally unique\
    \ are also called EUI-48\n   identifiers.  An EUI-48 is structured into an initial\
    \ 3-octet OUI\n   (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and an additional 3 octets\n\
    \   assigned by the OUI holder.  For organizations not requiring 3\n   octets'\
    \ worth of identifiers, the IEEE allocates IABs (Individual\n   Address Blocks)\
    \ instead, where the first 4 1/2 octets (36 bits) are\n   assigned, giving the\
    \ holder of the IAB 1 1/2 octets (12 bits) they\n   can control.\n   The IEEE\
    \ describes its assignment procedures and policies for IEEE\n   802 related identifiers\
    \ in [802_O&A].\n   Two bits within the initial 3 octets of an EUI-48 have special\n\
    \   significance: the Group bit (01-00-00) and the Local bit (02-00-00).\n   OUIs\
    \ and IABs are allocated with the Local bit zero and the Group bit\n   unspecified.\
    \  Multicast identifiers may be constructed by turning on\n   the Group bit, and\
    \ unicast identifiers constructed by leaving the\n   Group bit zero.\n   For globally\
    \ unique EUI-48 identifiers allocated by an OUI or IAB\n   owner, the Local bit\
    \ is zero.  If the Local bit is a one, the\n   identifier is considered by IEEE\
    \ 802 to be a local identifier under\n   the control of the local network administrator.\
    \  If the Local bit is\n   on, the holder of an OUI (or IAB) has no special authority\
    \ over\n   48-bit MAC identifiers whose first 3 (or 4 1/2) octets correspond to\n\
    \   their OUI (or IAB).\n"

- title: 2.2.  64-Bit MAC Identifiers
  contents:
  - "2.2.  64-Bit MAC Identifiers\n   IEEE also defines a system of 64-bit MAC identifiers\
    \ including\n   EUI-64s.  Uptake of these \"MAC-64\" identifiers has been limited.\n\
    \   They are currently used in constructing some IPv6 Interface\n   Identifiers\
    \ as described below and by the following IEEE standards:\n   o  IEEE 1394 (also\
    \ known as FireWire and i.Link),\n   o  IEEE 802.15.4 (also known as ZigBee).\n\
    \   Adding a 5-octet (40-bit) extension to a 3-octet (24-bit) OUI forms\n   an\
    \ EUI-64 identifier under that OUI.  As with EUI-48 identifiers, the\n   OUI has\
    \ the same Group/unicast and Local/Global bits.\n   The discussion below is almost\
    \ entirely in terms of the \"Modified\"\n   form of EUI-64 identifiers; however,\
    \ anyone allocated such an\n   identifier also has the unmodified form and may\
    \ use it as a MAC\n   identifier on any link that uses such 64-bit identifiers\
    \ for\n   interfaces.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  IPv6 Use of Modified EUI-64 Identifiers
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  IPv6 Use of Modified EUI-64 Identifiers\n   MAC-64 identifiers are used\
    \ to form the lower 64 bits of some IPv6\n   addresses (Section 2.5.1 and Appendix\
    \ A of [RFC4291] and Appendix A\n   of [RFC5214]).  When so used, the MAC-64 is\
    \ modified by inverting the\n   Local/Global bit to form an IETF \"Modified EUI-64\
    \ identifier\".  Below\n   is an illustration of a Modified EUI-64 identifier\
    \ under the IANA\n   OUI, where aa-bb-cc-dd-ee is the extension.\n         02-00-5E-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee\n\
    \   The first octet is shown as 02 rather than 00 because, in Modified\n   EUI-64\
    \ identifiers, the sense of the Local/Global bit is inverted\n   compared with\
    \ EUI-48 identifiers.  It is the globally unique values\n   (universal scope)\
    \ that have the 02 bit on in the first octet, while\n   those with this bit off\
    \ are locally assigned and out of scope for\n   global allocation.\n   The Local/Global\
    \ bit was inverted to make it easier for network\n   operators to type in local-scope\
    \ identifiers.  Thus, such Modified\n   EUI-64 identifiers as 1, 2, etc.  (ignoring\
    \ leading zeros), are\n   local.  Without the modification, they would have to\
    \ be\n   02-00-00-00-00-00-00-01, 02-00-00-00-00-00-00-02, etc., to be local.\n\
    \   As with MAC-48 identifiers, the 01 bit on in the first octet\n   indicates\
    \ a group identifier.\n   When the first two octets of the extension of a Modified\
    \ EUI-64\n   identifier are FF-FE, the remainder of the extension is a 24-bit\n\
    \   value as assigned by the OUI owner for an EUI-48.  For example:\n        \
    \ 02-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy\n   or\n         03-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy\n   where yy-yy-yy\
    \ is the portion (of an EUI-48 global unicast or\n   multicast identifier) that\
    \ is assigned by the OUI owner (IANA in this\n   case).  Thus, any holder of one\
    \ or more EUI-48 identifiers under the\n   IANA OUI also has an equal number of\
    \ Modified EUI-64 identifiers that\n   can be formed by inserting FF-FE in the\
    \ middle of their EUI-48\n   identifiers and inverting the Local/Global bit.\n\
    \      (Note: [EUI-64] defines FF-FF as the bits to be inserted to create\n  \
    \    an IEEE EUI-64 identifier from a MAC-48 identifier.  That document\n    \
    \  says the FF-FE value is used when starting with an EUI-48\n      identifier.\
    \  The IETF uses only FF-FE to create Modified EUI-64\n      identifiers from\
    \ 48-bit Ethernet station identifiers regardless of\n      whether they are EUI-48\
    \ or MAC-48 local identifiers.  EUI-48 and\n      local MAC-48 identifiers are\
    \ syntactically equivalent, and this\n      doesn't cause any problems in practice.)\n\
    \   In addition, certain Modified EUI-64 identifiers under the IANA OUI\n   are\
    \ reserved for holders of IPv4 addresses as follows:\n         02-00-5E-FE-xx-xx-xx-xx\n\
    \   where xx-xx-xx-xx is a 32-bit IPv4 address.  For Modified EUI-64\n   identifiers\
    \ based on an IPv4 address, the Local/Global bit should be\n   set to correspond\
    \ to whether the IPv4 address is local or global.\n   (Keep in mind that the sense\
    \ of the Modified EUI-64 identifier\n   Local/Global bit is reversed from that\
    \ in (unmodified) MAC-64\n   identifiers.)\n"

- title: 3.  Ethernet Protocol Parameters
  contents:
  - "3.  Ethernet Protocol Parameters\n   Ethernet protocol parameters provide a means\
    \ of indicating the\n   contents of a frame -- for example, that its contents\
    \ are IPv4 or\n   IPv6.\n   The concept has been extended to labeling by \"tags\"\
    .  A tag in this\n   sense is a prefix whose type is identified by an Ethertype\
    \ that is\n   then followed by either another tag, an Ethertype, or an LSAP\n\
    \   protocol indicator for the \"main\" body of the frame, as described\n   below.\
    \  Traditionally in the [802_O&A] world, tags are fixed length\n   and do not\
    \ include any encoding of their own length.  Thus, anything\n   that is processing\
    \ a frame cannot, in general, safely process\n   anything in the frame past an\
    \ Ethertype it does not understand.  An\n   example is the C-tag (formerly the\
    \ Q-tag) [802.1Q].  It provides\n   customer VLAN and priority information for\
    \ a frame.\n   There are two types of protocol identifier parameters that can\
    \ occur\n   in Ethernet frames after the initial MAC-48 destination and source\n\
    \   identifiers:\n      Ethertypes: These are 16-bit identifiers appearing as\
    \ the initial\n         two octets after the MAC destination and source (or after\
    \ a\n         tag) which, when considered as an unsigned integer, are equal\n\
    \         to or larger than 0x0600.\n      LSAPs: These are 8-bit protocol identifiers\
    \ that occur in pairs\n         immediately after an initial 16-bit (two octet)\
    \ remaining frame\n         length, which is in turn after the MAC destination\
    \ and source\n         (or after a tag).  Such a length must, when considered\
    \ as an\n         unsigned integer, be less than 0x5DC or it could be mistaken\
    \ as\n         an Ethertype.  LSAPs (Link-Layer Subnet Access Points) occur in\n\
    \         pairs where one is intended to indicate the source protocol\n      \
    \   handler and one the destination protocol handler; however, use\n         cases\
    \ where the two are different have been relatively rare.\n   Neither Ethertypes\
    \ nor LSAPs are allocated by IANA; instead, they are\n   allocated by the IEEE\
    \ Registration Authority (see Section 1.2 above\n   and the Ethertype Annex below).\
    \  However, both LSAPs and Ethertypes\n   have extension mechanisms so that they\
    \ can be used with five-octet\n   Ethernet protocol identifiers under an OUI,\
    \ including those allocated\n   by IANA under the IANA OUI.\n   When using the\
    \ IEEE 802 LLC format (SNAP) [802_O&A] for a frame, an\n   OUI-based protocol\
    \ identifier can be expressed as follows:\n         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz\n\
    \   where xx-xx is the frame length and, as above, must be small enough\n   not\
    \ to be confused with an Ethertype; \"AA\" is the LSAP that indicates\n   this\
    \ use and is sometimes referred to as the SNAP SAP; \"03\" is the\n   LLC control\
    \ octet indicating datagram service; yy-yy-yy is an OUI;\n   and zz-zz is a protocol\
    \ number, under that OUI, allocated by the OUI\n   owner.  The odd five-octet\
    \ length for such OUI-based protocol\n   identifiers was chosen so that, with\
    \ the LLC control octet (\"03\"),\n   the result is 16-bit aligned.\n   When using\
    \ an Ethertype to indicate the main type for a frame body,\n   the special \"\
    OUI Extended Ethertype\" 88-B7 is available.  Using this\n   Ethertype, a frame\
    \ body can begin with\n         88-B7-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz\n   where yy-yy-yy and zz-zz\
    \ have the same meaning as in the SNAP format\n   described above.\n   It is also\
    \ possible, within the SNAP format, to use an arbitrary\n   Ethertype.  Putting\
    \ the Ethertype as the zz-zz field after an all\n   zeros OUI (00-00-00) does\
    \ this.  It looks like\n         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-00-zz-zz\n   where zz-zz\
    \ is the Ethertype.\n      (Note that, at this point, the 802 protocol syntax\
    \ facilities are\n      sufficiently powerful that they could be chained indefinitely.\n\
    \      Whether support for such chaining is generally required is not\n      clear,\
    \ but [802_O&A] requires support for\n         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-00-88-B7-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz\n\
    \      even though this could be more efficiently expressed by simply\n      pinching\
    \ out the \"00-00-00-88-B7\" in the middle.)\n   As well as labeling frame contents,\
    \ 802 Protocol types appear within\n   NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) Next\
    \ Hop Resolution Protocol\n   [RFC2332] messages.  Such messages have provisions\
    \ for both two octet\n   Ethertypes and OUI based protocol types.\n"

  - "3.1.  Ethernet Protocol Allocation under the IANA OUI\n   Two-octet protocol\

  - "4.  Other OUI-Based Parameters\n   Some IEEE 802 and other protocols provide\
    \ for parameters based on an\n   OUI beyond those discussed above.  Such parameters\
    \ most commonly\n   consist of an OUI plus one octet of additional value.  They\
    \ are\n   usually called \"vendor specific\" parameters, although \"organization\n\
    \   specific\" might be more accurate.  They would look like\n         yy-yy-yy-zz\n\
    \   where yy-yy-yy is the OUI and zz is the additional specifier.  An\n   example\
    \ is the Cipher Suite Selector in IEEE 802.11 ([802.11], page\n   125).\n   Values\
    \ may be allocated under the IANA OUI for such other OUI-based\n   parameter usage\
    \ by Expert Review except that, for each use, the\n   additional specifier values\
    \ consisting of all zero bits and all one\n   bits (0x00 and 0xFF for a one-octet\
    \ specifier) are reserved and\n   require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1)\

    \ IETF Standard or\n   other standard related to IETF work) and be documented\
    \ in an\n   Internet-Draft or RFC.  The first time a value is allocated for a\n\
    \   particular parameter of this type, an IANA registry will be created\n   to\
    \ contain that allocation and any subsequent allocations of values\n   for that\
    \ parameter under the IANA OUI.  The Expert will specify the\n   name of the registry.\n\
    \   (If a different policy from that above is required for such a\n   parameter,\

    \ for Expert Review and IESG\n   Ratification of MAC, protocol, and other IANA\
    \ OUI-based identifiers.\n   The Expert(s) referred to in this document shall\
    \ consist of one or\n   more persons appointed by and serving at the pleasure\
    \ of the IESG.\n   The procedure described for Expert Review allocations in this\n\
    \   document is fully consistent with the IANA Expert Review policy\n   described\
    \ in Section 4.1 of [RFC5226].\n   While finite, the universe of code points from\
    \ which Expert judged\n   allocations will be made is felt to be large enough\
    \ that the\n   requirements given in this document and the Experts' good judgment\n\
    \   are sufficient guidance.  The idea is for the Expert to provide a\n   light\
    \ sanity check for small allocations of EUI identifiers with\n   increased scrutiny\
    \ by the Expert for medium-sized allocations of EUI\n   identifiers, and allocations\
    \ of protocol identifiers and other IANA\n   OUI based parameters.  However, it\
    \ can make sense to allocate very\n   large portions of the MAC identifier code\
    \ point space.  (Note that\n   existing allocations include one for 1/2 of the\
    \ entire multicast code\n   point space and one for 1/16 of the multicast code\
    \ point space.) In\n   those cases, and in cases of the allocation of \"reserved\"\
    \ values,\n   IESG Ratification of an Expert Review approval recommendation is\n\
    \   required as described below.  The procedure is as follows:\n      The applicant\
    \ always completes the appropriate Template from the\n         Template Annex\
    \ below and sends it to IANA <iana@iana.org>.\n      IANA always sends the Template\
    \ to an appointed Expert.  If the\n         Expert recuses themselves or is non-responsive,\
    \ IANA may choose\n         an alternative appointed Expert or, if none are available,\
    \ will\n         contact the IESG.\n      If the allocation is based on Expert\
    \ Review:\n         If IANA receives a disapproval from an Expert selected to\n\
    \            review an application Template, the application will be\n       \
    \     denied.\n         If IANA receives approval and code points are available,\
    \ IANA\n            will make the requested allocation.\n      If the allocation\
    \ is based on IESG Ratification, the procedure\n         starts with the first\
    \ two steps above for Expert Review.  If\n         the Expert disapproves the\
    \ application, they simply inform\n         IANA; however, if the Expert believes\
    \ the application should be\n         approved, or is uncertain and believes that\
    \ the circumstances\n         warrant the attention of the IESG, the Expert will\
    \ inform IANA\n         about their advice and IANA will forward the application,\n\
    \         together with the reasons for approval or uncertainty, to the\n    \
    \     IESG.  The IESG must decide whether the allocation will be\n         granted.\
    \  This can be accomplished by a management item in an\n         IESG telechat\
    \ as done for other types of requests.  If the IESG\n         decides not to ratify\
    \ a favorable opinion by the Expert or\n         decides against an application\
    \ where the Expert is uncertain,\n         the application is denied, otherwise\
    \ it is granted.  The IESG\n         will communicate its decision to the Expert\
