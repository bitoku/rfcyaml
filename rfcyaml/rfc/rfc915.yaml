- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The network mail path service fills the current need of people\
    \ to\n   determine mailbox addresses for hosts that are not part of the\n   ARPA-Internet\
    \ but can be reached by one or more relay hosts that have\n   Unix To Unix Copy\
    \ (UUCP) mail, CSNET mail, MAILNET mail, BITNET mail,\n   etc.\n   Anyone can\
    \ use the service if they have TCP/TELNET to one of the\n   hosts with a mail\
    \ path server.\n"
- title: DISCUSSION
  contents:
  - "DISCUSSION\n   Currently many hosts that are not connected to the ARPA-Internet\n\
    \   network can send mail to and receive mail from the ARPA-Internet\n   community.\
    \  The ARPA-Internet community sends mail using mailbox\n   addresses of the form\
    \ \"user@host\" or \"local-part@domain\" [1, 5].  In\n   an effort to provide\
    \ service to hosts not connected directly to the\n   ARPA-Internet, mail maintainers\
    \ have used the feature that the\n   \"local-part\" of the mailbox address is\
    \ locally interpreted to imbed\n   specially encoded mail routing or relaying\
    \ information.  These\n   encoded mailbox addresses have a variety of forms and\
    \ have become\n   common practice. For example:\n      demco%ucb-ean.cdn%ubc.csnet@CSNET-RELAY.ARPA\n\
    \      \"Rudy.Nedved%CMCCTE@CARNEGIE.MAILNET\"@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA\n      ihnp4!cmucsg!ern@UT-SALLY.ARPA\n\
    \      mss.dartmouth@CSNET-RELAY.ARPA\n      nedved%CMCCTF.BITNET@WISCVM.ARPA\n\
    \   It is important that people be able to communicate, but it is clear\n   from\
    \ the rampant confusion and frustration that something must be\n"

  contents:
  - "Network Mail Path Service\n   provided to make it easier for people to address\
    \ mail to\n   non-ARPA-Internet hosts.  The result, for a variety of reasons,\
    \ has\n   been the work and development of the Domain Name system and\n   facilities\
    \ [2, 3, 7, 9], and it is expected to make mailbox addresses\n   be as simple\
    \ as the current ARPA-Internet mailbox format (e.g.,\n   \"user@domain\").\n \
    \  How do people discover the special encoded addresses for\n   non-ARPA-Internet\
    \ host mailboxes until the domain name system is\n   working and covering the\
    \ majority of hosts in the mail world?  The\n   proposed solution to this problem\
    \ is to provide a network service for\n   the ARPA-Internet and a mail service\
    \ for the non-ARPA-Internet hosts\n   that, given a host and an optional addressing\
    \ system or communication\n   protocol or some other piece of information, supplies\
    \ the mailbox\n   address format for sending mail to that host.  For example,\n\
    \   \"nedved@Carnegie.MAILNET\" would be translated by the server to\n   \"nedved%Carnegie.MAILNET@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA\"\
    . This memo covers the\n   proposed network service.\n"

  contents:
  - "DOCUMENT CONVENTIONS\n   Unless otherwise noted, all numbers are in decimal.\n\
    \   The term \"host\", as used in this document, describes one computer\n   system\
    \ which may have more than one name associated with it. It may\n   have a name\
    \ for each network or mail connection it supports and may\n   have several nicknames\
    \ or aliases for the computer and/or for each\n   set of network names that the\
    \ computer has acquired.\n"
- title: OVERVIEW
  contents:
  - "OVERVIEW\n   The network service is a connection based application on TCP [4].\
    \  A\n   server listens for TCP connections on the assigned port of 117 [8].\n\
    \   It responds to the connection with a coded greeting message and waits\n  \
    \ for a command line. For each command line sent to the server, the\n   server\
    \ will respond with a coded message.  The special command QUIT\n   causes the\
    \ server to respond with a coded closing message and closes\n   the connection.\n"

- title: DESIGN GOALS
  contents:
  - "DESIGN GOALS\n   One of the goals is to provide the service to as many ARPA-Internet\n\
    \   hosts as possible. In the current ARPA-Internet, experience has shown\n  \
    \ that software people first implement TELNET/TCP [6] before any other\n   network\
    \ application or protocol. Therefore, it is a sub-goal that\n   people be able\
    \ to access the service using available programs (with\n   minimal modifications)\
    \ that implement TELNET/TCP.  Therefore,\n   TELNET/TCP on port 117 will work\
    \ correctly.  The server understands\n   TELNET options but refuses all option\
    \ negotiations that disagree with\n   the NVT characteristics defined by the TELNET\
    \ protocol (see [6]),\n   does not echo, and expects command lines to end with\
    \ <CRLF> (ASCII\n   code 13 (octal 15) followed by code 10 (octal 12)).  Character\n\
    \   echoing and line editing is expected to be handled by the user host\n   for\
    \ the benefit of the user.\n   Mail systems and other programs are also expected\
    \ to be able to\n   access and understand the service.  Each command reply can\
    \ have\n   multiple line responses with text understandable by the novice user.\n\
    \   Each command is encoded so as to make it easy for a program to parse\n   the\
    \ lines and extract interesting information, such as whether the\n   operation\
    \ was successful.\n"
- title: THE PROTOCOL
  contents:
  - "THE PROTOCOL\n   Given the developing nature of the protocol and its intent,\
    \ the\n   command lines are composed of a command (case ignored) followed by\n\
    \   white space, the argument(s) and a <CRLF>. The white space is\n   required\
    \ if any arguments are supplied but the arguments are\n   optional.  White space\
    \ following the command and any optional\n   arguments are ignored.\n      <cmdline>\
    \ := <cmd> [<WS> <args>] [<WS>] <CRLF>\n      <WS> := [<WS>] <WS> | <TAB> | <SPACE>\n\
    \   Coded response lines have the rigid format of a 3-digit decimal code\n   followed\
    \ by a space or a dash followed by text composed of characters\n   within the\
    \ ASCII range 32 to 126 (octal 40 to 176) with <CRLF> at the\n   end of the line.\
    \  The dash after the 3-digit code indicates at least\n   one more response line\
    \ will be supplied while the space indicates the\n   current response line is\
    \ the last one.\n      <rspline> := <digit><digit><digit><cont><rtext><CRLF>\n\

    \ information.  If several hosts have the\n   same nickname or alias and lack\
    \ distinguishing domain components, the\n   server returns an error response containing\
    \ all of the hosts found.\n   Some implementation may even break down the host\

- title: CAVEATS
  contents:
  - "CAVEATS\n   The greatest problem with the new service, as implemented, is that\
    \ it\n   reports paths from the service host rather than from the user's host.\n\
    \   This is due to the nature of software.  It would be more convenient\n   if\
    \ it reported a correct path from the caller's host, but this would\n   require\
    \ a different method of database management (a method which\n   could quickly\
    \ compute the path from the caller's machine or a machine\n   which would be willing\
    \ to keep updated databases for each host (which\n   is impractical)).\n   Two\
    \ minor problems exist with the database used by the software. Many\n   relay\
    \ hosts exist in several different protocol or addressing name\n   spaces but\
    \ under different names. The current software cross\n   referencing for the multiple\
    \ protocol relay hosts is done by hand,\n   but, given the seeming reliability\
    \ of these relay hosts, the problem\n   does not appear to be significant.  The\
    \ second problem is that the\n   data should be collected from the actual relay\
    \ hosts to ensure\n   correctness, but in many cases this is impossible.\n"

  - "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n   The original protocol was documented by Marc Elvy for a\
    \ server that\n   he and Alan Langerman built.  The server used the pathalias\
    \ software\n   created by Steve Bellovin, as modified by Peter Honeyman and Robert\n\
    \   T. Morris, to maintain the host to host connection database.  The\n   software\
    \ provided a way for people to make sense out of the jungle of\n   UUCP hosts.\
    \ The Info-Nets@MIT-MC mailing list, created and maintained\n   by Robert Krawitz,\
    \ made the CMU and Harvard mail path projects aware\n   of each other and the\
    \ people on the list provided many of the mail\n   relay databases that are in\
    \ use by the mail path servers.  The\n   original server may be accessed through\
    \ TCP port 117 on harvard.arpa\n   -- the \"pathto\" program that runs under 4.2BSD\
    \ UNIX may be obtained\n   as a front end to the server from RFC915@HARVARD.ARPA.\n\
    \   The current protocol scope was changed by Rudy Nedved to cover\n   BITNET,\
    \ CSNET, MAILNET and other \"mail networks\" and further refined\n   by Marc Elvy,\
    \ Alan Langerman and others.\n   Comments should be sent to RFC-915@HARVARD.ARPA\
    \ or mailed (via the\n   U.S.  Postal Service) to:\n      Marc A. Elvy\n     \
