    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\

- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   SMF provides methods for implementing DPD-based multicast forwarding\n\
    \   with the optional use of CDS-based relay sets.  The CDS provides a\n   complete\
    \ connected coverage of the nodes comprising the MANET.  The\n   MCDS is the smallest\
    \ set of MANET nodes (comprising a connected\n   cluster) that cover all the nodes\
    \ in the cluster with their\n   transmissions.  As the density of the MANET nodes\
    \ increase, the\n   fraction of nodes required in an MCDS decreases.  Using the\
    \ MCDS as a\n   multicast forwarding set then becomes an efficient multicast\n\
    \   mechanism for MANETs.\n   Various algorithms for the construction of estimates\
    \ of the MCDS\n   exist.  The Simplified Multicast Framework [RFC6621] describes\
    \ some\n   of these.  It further defines various operational modes for a node\n\
    \   that is participating in the collective creation of the MCDS\n   estimates.\
    \  These modes depend upon the set of related MANET routing\n   and discovery\
    \ protocols and mechanisms in operation in the specific\n   MANET node.\n   A\
    \ SMF router's MIB module contains SMF process configuration\n   parameters (e.g.,\
    \ specific CDS algorithm), state information (e.g.,\n   current membership in\
    \ the CDS), performance counters (e.g., packet\n   counters), and notifications.\n"

  - "8.  IANA-SMF-MIB Definitions\n   This section contains the IANA-SMF-MIB module.\
    \  This MIB module\n   defines two Textual Conventions for which IANA SHOULD maintain\
    \ and\n   keep synchronized with the registry identified below within the\n  \
    \ IANAsmfOpModeIdTC and the IANAsmfRssaIdTC TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs.\n   The IANAsmfOpModeIdTC\
    \ defines an index that identifies through\n   reference to a specific SMF operations\
    \ mode.  The index is an integer\n   valued named-number enumeration consisting\
    \ of an integer and label.\n   IANA is to create and maintain this Textual Convention.\
    \  Future\n   assignments are made to anyone on a first come, first served basis.\n\
    \   There is no substantive review of the request, other than to ensure\n   that\
    \ it is well-formed and does not duplicate an existing assignment.\n   However,\
    \ requests must include a minimal amount of clerical\n   information, such as\
    \ a point of contact (including an email address)\n   and a brief description\
    \ of the method being identified as a new SMF\n   operations mode.\n   The IANAsmfRssaIdTC\
    \ defines an index that identifies through\n   reference to a specific Reduced\
    \ Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA).  The\n   index is an integer valued named-number\
    \ enumeration consisting of an\n   integer and label.  IANA is to create and maintain\
    \ this Textual\n   Convention.\n   Future assignments to the IANAsmfRssaIdTC for\
    \ the index range 5-127\n   require an RFC publication (either as an IETF submission\
    \ or as an\n   Independent submission [RFC5742]).  The category of RFC MUST be\n\
    \   Standards Track.  The specific RSSAs MUST be documented in sufficient\n  \
    \ detail so that interoperability between independent implementations\n   is possible.\n\
    \   Future assignments to the IANAsmfRssaIdTC for the index range 128-239\n  \
    \ are private or local use only, with the type and purpose defined by\n   the\
    \ local site.  No attempt is made to prevent multiple sites from\n   using the\
    \ same value in different (and incompatible) ways.  There is\n   no need for IANA\
    \ to review such assignments (since IANA will not\n   record these), and assignments\
    \ are not generally useful for broad\n   interoperability.  It is the responsibility\
    \ of the sites making use\n   of the Private Use range to ensure that no conflicts\
    \ occur (within\n   the intended scope of use).\n   Future assignments to the\
    \ IANAsmfRssaIdTC for the index range 240-255\n   are to facilitate experimentation.\
    \  These require an RFC publication\n   (either as an IETF submission or as an\
    \ Independent submission\n   [RFC5742]).  The category of RFC MUST be Experimental.\
    \  The RSSA\n   algorithms MUST be documented in sufficient detail so that\n \
    \  interoperability between independent implementations is possible.\n   This\
    \ MIB module references [RFC3626], [RFC5614], [RFC6621], and\n   [RFC7181].\n\

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This section discusses security implications\
    \ of the choices made in\n   this SMF-MIB module.\n   There are a number of management\
    \ objects defined in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write\
    \ and/or read-create.  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable\
    \ in some network\n   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n\
    \   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network\
    \ operations.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   o  'smfCfgAdminStatus' - this writable configuration object controls\n   \
    \   the operational status of the SMF process.  If this setting is\n      configured\
    \ inconsistently across the MANET multicast domain, then\n      delivery of multicast\
    \ data may be inconsistent across the domain;\n      some nodes may not receive\
    \ multicast data intended for them.\n   o  'smfCfgRouterIDAddrType' and 'smfCfgRouterID'\
    \ - these writable\n      configuration objects define the ID of the SMF process.\
    \  These\n      objects should be configured with a routable address defined on\n\
    \      the local SMF device.  The smfCfgRouterID is a logical\n      identification\
    \ that MUST be configured as unique across\n      interoperating SMF neighborhoods,\
    \ and it is RECOMMENDED to be\n      chosen as the numerically largest address\
    \ contained in a node's\n      'Neighbor Address List' as defined in NHDP.  A\
    \ smfCfgRouterID MUST\n      be unique within the scope of the operating MANET\
    \ network\n      regardless of the method used for selecting it.  If these objects\n\
    \      are misconfigured or configured inconsistently across the MANET,\n    \
    \  then the ability of various RSSAs, e.g., eCDS, may be compromised.\n      This\
    \ would potentially result in some routers within the MANET not\n      receiving\
    \ multicast packets destine to them.  Hence, intentionally\n      misconfiguring\
    \ these objects could pose a form of Denial-of-\n      Service (DoS) attack against\
    \ the MANET.\n   o  'smfCfgOpMode' - this writable configuration object defines\
    \ the\n      operational mode of the SMF process.  The operational mode defines\n\
    \      how the SMF process receives its data to form its local estimate\n    \
    \  of the CDS.  It is recommended that the value for this object be\n      set\
    \ consistently across the MANET to ensure proper operation of\n      the multicast\
    \ packet forwarding.  If the value for this object is\n      set inconsistently\
    \ across the MANET, the result may be that\n      multicast packet delivery will\
    \ be compromised within the MANET.\n      Hence, intentionally misconfiguring\
    \ this object could pose a form\n      DoS attack against the MANET.\n   o  'smfCfgRssa'\
    \ - this writable configuration object sets the\n      specific RSSA for the SMF\
    \ process.  If this object is set\n      inconsistently across the MANET domain,\
    \ multicast delivery of data\n      will likely fail.  Hence, intentionally misconfiguring\
    \ this object\n      could pose a form DoS attack against the MANET.\n   o  'smfCfgRssaMember'\
    \ - this writable configuration object sets the\n      'interest' of the local\
    \ SMF node in participating in the CDS.\n      Setting this object to 'never(3)'\
    \ on a highly connected device\n      could lead to frequent island formation.\
    \  Setting this object to\n      'always(2)' could support data ex-filtration\
    \ from the MANET\n      domain.\n   o  'smfCfgIpv4Dpd' - this writable configuration\
    \ object sets the\n      duplicate packet detection method, i.e., H-DPD or I-DPD,\
    \ for\n      forwarding of IPv4 multicast packets.  Forwarders may operate with\n\
    \      mixed H-DPD and I-DPD modes as long as they consistently perform\n    \
    \  the appropriate DPD routines outlined in [RFC6621].  However, it\n      is\
    \ RECOMMENDED that a deployment be configured with a common mode\n      for operational\
    \ consistency.\n   o  'smfCfgIpv6Dpd' - this writable configuration object sets\
    \ the\n      duplicate packet detection method for the forwarding of IPv6\n  \
    \    multicast packets.  Since IPv6 SMF does specify an option header,\n     \
    \ the interoperability constraints are not as loose as in the IPv4\n      version,\
    \ and forwarders SHOULD NOT operate with mixed H-DPD and\n      I-DPD modes. \
    \ Hence, the value for this object SHOULD be\n      consistently set within the\
    \ forwarders comprising the MANET, else\n      inconsistent forwarding may result\
    \ unnecessary multicast packet\n      dropping.\n   o  'smfCfgMaxPktLifetime'\
    \ - this writable configuration object sets\n      the estimate of the network\
    \ packet traversal time.  If set too\n      small, this could lead to poor multicast\
    \ data delivery ratios\n      throughout the MANET domain.  This could serve as\
    \ a form of DoS\n      attack if this object value is set too small.\n   o  'smfCfgDpdEntryMaxLifetime'\
    \ - this writable configuration object\n      sets the maximum lifetime (in seconds)\
    \ for the cached DPD records\n      for the combined IPv4 and IPv6 methods.  If\
    \ the memory is running\n      low prior to the MaxLifetime being exceeded, the\
    \ local SMF devices\n      should purge the oldest records first.  If this object\
    \ value is\n      set too small, then the effectiveness of the SMF DPD algorithms\n\
    \      may become greatly diminished causing a higher than necessary\n      packet\
    \ load on the MANET.\n   o  'smfCfgNhdpRssaMesgTLVIncluded' - this writable configuration\n\
    \      object indicates whether or not the associated NHDP messages\n      include\
    \ the RSSA Message TLV.  It is highly RECOMMENDED that this\n      object be set\
    \ to 'true(1)' when the SMF operation mode is set to\n      independent as this\
    \ information will inform the local forwarder of\n      the RSSA implemented in\
    \ neighboring forwarders and is used to\n      ensure consistent forwarding across\
    \ the MANET.  While it is\n      possible that SMF neighbors MAY be configured\
    \ differently with\n      respect to the RSSA and still operate cooperatively,\
    \ but these\n      cases will vary dependent upon the algorithm types designated\
    \ and\n      this situation SHOULD be avoided.\n   o  'smfCfgNhdpRssaAddrBlockTLVIncluded'\
    \ - this writable configuration\n      object indicates whether or not the associated\
    \ NHDP messages\n      include the RSSA Address Block TLV.  The\n      smfNhdpRssaAddrBlockTLVIncluded\
    \ is optional in all cases as it\n      depends on the existence of an address\
    \ block that may not be\n      present.  If this SMF device is configured with\
    \ NHDP, then this\n      object should be set to 'true(1)' as this TLV enables\
    \ CDS relay\n      algorithm operation and configuration to be shared among 2-hop\n\
    \      neighborhoods.  Some relay algorithms require 2-hop neighbor\n      configuration\
    \ in order to correctly select relay sets.\n   o  'smfCfgAddrForwardingTable'\
    \ - the writable configuration objects\n      in this table indicate which multicast\
    \ IP addresses are to be\n      forwarded by this SMF node.  Misconfiguration\
    \ of rows within this\n      table can limit the ability of this SMF device to\
    \ properly forward\n      multicast data.\n   o  'smfCfgInterfaceTable' - the\
    \ writable configuration objects in\n      this table indicate which SMF node\
    \ interfaces are participating in\n      the SMF packet forwarding process.  Misconfiguration\
    \ of rows\n      within this table can limit the ability of this SMF device to\n\
    \      properly forward multicast data.\n   Some of the readable objects in this\
    \ MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may\
    \ be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It\
    \ is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects\
    \ and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them\
    \ over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n\
    \   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  'smfNodeRsStatusIncluded' - this readable\
    \ state object indicates\n      whether or not this SMF node is part of the CDS.\
    \  Being part of\n      the CDS makes this node a distinguished device.  It could\
    \ be\n      exploited for data ex-filtration, or DoS attacks.\n   o  'smfStateNeighborTable'\
    \ - the readable state objects in this table\n      indicate current neighbor\
    \ nodes to this SMF node.  Exposing this\n      information to an attacker could\
    \ allow the attacker easier access\n      to the larger MANET domain.\n   The\
    \ remainder of the objects in the SMF-MIB module are performance\n   counter objects.\
    \  While these give an indication of the activity of\n   the SMF process on this\
    \ node, it is not expected that exposing these\n   values poses a security risk\
    \ to the MANET network.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate\
    \ security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n\
    \   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed\
    \ to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB\
    \ module.\n   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by\
    \ the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming\n   compliance\
    \ to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for\n   authentication and\
    \ privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher\
    \ algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for the Transport\
    \ Security Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such\
    \ as SSH\n   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment of SNMP\
    \ versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
- title: 10.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "10.  Applicability Statement\n   This document describes objects for configuring\
    \ parameters of the\n   Simplified Multicast Forwarding [RFC6621] process on a\
    \ Mobile Ad Hoc\n   Network (MANET) router.  This MIB module, denoted SMF-MIB,\
    \ also\n   reports state and performance information and notifications.  This\n\
    \   section provides some examples of how this MIB module can be used in\n   MANET\
    \ network deployments.  A fuller discussion of MANET network\n   management use\
    \ cases and challenges is out of scope for this\n   document.\n   SMF is designed\
    \ to allow MANET routers to forward IPv4 and IPv6\n   packets over the MANET and\
    \ cover the MANET nodes through the\n   automatic discovery of efficient estimates\
    \ of the Minimum Connected\n   Dominating Set (MCDS) of nodes within the MANET.\
    \  The MCDS is\n   estimated using the Relay Set Selection Algorithms (RSSAs)\
    \ discussed\n   within this document.  In the following, three scenarios are listed\n\
    \   where this MIB module is useful:\n   o  For a Parking Lot Initial Configuration\
    \ Situation - it is common\n      for the vehicles comprising the MANET being\
    \ forward deployed at a\n      remote location, e.g., the site of a natural disaster,\
    \ to be off-\n      loaded in a parking lot where an initial configuration of\
    \ the\n      networking devices is performed.  The configuration is loaded into\n\
    \      the devices from a fixed-location Network Operations Center (NOC)\n   \
    \   at the parking lot, and the vehicles are stationary at the parking\n     \
    \ lot while the configuration changes are made.  Standards-based\n      methods\
    \ for configuration management from the co-located NOC are\n      necessary for\
    \ this deployment option.  The set of interesting\n      configuration objects\
    \ for the SMF process are listed within this\n      MIB module.\n   o  For Mobile\
    \ vehicles with Low Bandwidth Satellite Link to a Fixed\n      NOC - Here the\
    \ vehicles carrying the MANET routers carry multiple\n      wireless interfaces,\
    \ one of which is a relatively low-bandwidth\n      on-the-move satellite connection\
    \ that interconnects a fix NOC to\n      the nodes of the MANET.  Standards-based\
    \ methods for monitoring\n      and fault management from the fixed NOC are necessary\
    \ for this\n      deployment option.\n   o  For Fixed NOC and Mobile Local Manager\
    \ in Larger Vehicles - for\n      larger vehicles, a hierarchical network management\
    \ arrangement is\n      useful.  Centralized network management is performed from\
    \ a fixed\n      NOC while local management is performed locally from within the\n\
    \      vehicles.  Standards-based methods for configuration, monitoring,\n   \
    \   and fault management are necessary for this deployment option.\n   Here we\
    \ provide an example of the simplest of configurations to\n   establish an operational\
    \ multicast forwarding capability in a MANET.\n   This discussion only identifies\
    \ the configuration necessary through\n   the SMF-MIB module and assumes that\
    \ other configuration has occurred.\n   Assume that the MANET is to support only\
    \ IPv4 addressing and that the\n   MANET nodes are to be configured in the context\
    \ of the Parking Lot\n   Initialization case above.  Then, the SMF-MIB module\
    \ defines ten\n   configuration OIDs and two configuration tables, i.e., the\n\
    \   smfCfgAddrForwardingTable and the smfCfgInterfaceTable.  Of the ten\n   OIDs\
    \ defined, all but one, i.e., the smfCfgRouterID, have DEFVAL\n   clauses that\
    \ allow for a functional configuration of the SMF process\n   within the MANET.\
    \  The smfCfgRouterIDType defaults to 'ipv4' so the\n   smfCfgRouterID can be\
    \ set as, e.g., (assuming the use of the Net-SNMP\n   toolkit),:\n   snmpset [options]\
    \ <smfCfgRouterID_OID>.0 a 192.0.2.100\n   If the smfCfgAddrForwardingTable is\
    \ left empty, then the SMF local\n   forwarder will forward all multicast addresses.\
    \  So this table does\n   not require configuration if you want to have the MANET\
    \ forward all\n   multicast addresses.\n   All that remains is to configure at\
    \ least one row in the\n   smfCfgInterfaceTable.  Assume that the node has a wireless\
    \ interface\n   with an <ifName>='wlan0' and an <ifIndex>='1'.  All of the objects\
    \ in\n   the rows of the smfCfgInterfaceTable have a DEFVAL clause; hence,\n \
    \  only the RowStatus object needs to be set.  So the SMF process will\n   be\
    \ activated on the 'wlan0' interface by the following network\n   manager snmpset\
    \ command:\n   snmpset [options] <smfCfgIfRowStatus>.1 i active(1)\n   At this\
    \ point, the configured forwarder will begin a Classical\n   Flooding algorithm\
    \ to forward all multicast addresses IPv4 packets it\n   receives.\n   To provide\
    \ a more efficient multicast forwarding within the MANET,\n   the network manager\
    \ could walk the smfCapabilitiesTable to identify\n   other SMF Operational Modes,\
    \ for example:\n   snmpwalk [options] <smfCapabilitiesTable>\n   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesIndex.1\
    \ = INTEGER: 1\n   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesIndex.2 = INTEGER: 2\n   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesOpModeID.1\
    \ = INTEGER: cfOnly(1)\n   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesOpModeiD.2 = INTEGER: independent(2)\n\
    \   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesRssaID.1 = INTEGER: cF(1)\n   SMF-MIB::smfCapabilitiesRssaID.2\
    \ = INTEGER: eCDS(3)\n   In this example, the forwarding device also supports\
    \ the Essential\n   Connected Dominating Set (eCDS) RSSA with the forwarder in\
    \ the\n   'independent(2)' operational mode.  If the network manager were to\n\
    \   then issue an snmpset, for example:\n   snmpset [options] <smfCfgOperationalMode>.0\
    \ i 2\n   then the local forwarder would switch its forwarding behavior from\n\
    \   Classical Flooding to the more efficient eCDS flooding.\n"
