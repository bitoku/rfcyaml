  - "Abstract\n   There are a variety of NAT flavors, as described in [Ref 1]. Of\
    \ the\n   domains supported by NATs, only Realm-Specific IP clients are able to\n\
    \   pursue end-to-end IPsec secure sessions. However, all flavors of NAT\n   are\
    \ capable of offering tunnel-mode IPsec security to private domain\n   hosts peering\
    \ with nodes in external realm. This document describes a\n   security model by\
    \ which tunnel-mode IPsec security can be architected\n   on NAT devices. A section\
    \ is devoted to describing how security\n   policies may be transparently communicated\
    \ to IKE (for automated KEY\n   exchange) during Quick Mode. Also outlined are\
    \ applications that can\n   benefit from the Security Model described.\n"

  - "1. Introduction and Overview\n   NAT devices provide transparent routing to end\
    \ hosts trying to\n   communicate from disparate address realms, by modifying\
    \ IP and\n   transport headers en-route. This solution works best when the end\n\
    \   user identifier (such as host name) is different from the address\n   used\
    \ to locate end user.\n   End-to-end application level payload security can be\
    \ provided for\n   applications that do not embed realm-specific information in\
    \ payloads\n   that is meaningless to one of the end-users. Applications that\
    \ do\n   embed realm-specific information in payload will require an\n   application\
    \ level gateway (ALG) to make the payload meaningful in\n   both realms. However,\
    \ applications that require assistance of an ALG\n   en-route cannot pursue end-to-end\
    \ application level security.\n   All applications traversing a NAT device, irrespective\
    \ of whether\n   they require assistance of an ALG or not, can benefit from IPsec\n\
    \   tunnel-mode security, when NAT device acts as the IPsec tunnel end\n   point.\n\
    \   Section 2 below defines terms specific to this document.\n   Section 3 describes\
    \ how tunnel mode IPsec security can be recognized\n   on NAT devices. IPsec Security\
    \ architecture, format and operation of\n   various types of security mechanisms\
    \ may be found in [Ref 2], [Ref 3]\n   and [Ref 4].  This section does not address\
    \ how session keys and\n   policies are exchanged between a NAT device acting\
    \ as IPsec gateway\n   and external peering nodes. The exchange could have taken\
    \ place\n   manually or using any of known automatic exchange techniques.\n  \
    \ Section 4 assumes that Public Key based IKE protocol [Ref 5] may be\n   used\
    \ to automate exchange of security policies, session keys and\n   other Security\
    \ Association (SA) attributes. This section describes a\n   method by which security\
    \ policies administered for a private domain\n   may be translated for communicating\
    \ with external nodes. Detailed\n   description of IKE protocol operation may\
    \ be found in [Ref 5] and\n   [Ref 6].\n   Section 5 describes applications of\
    \ the security model described in\n   the document. Applications listed include\
    \ secure external realm\n   connectivity for private domain hosts and secure remote\
    \ access to\n   enterprise mobile hosts.\n"

- title: 2.1. Normal-NAT
  contents:
  - "2.1. Normal-NAT\n   The term \"Normal-NAT\" is introduced to distinguish normal\
    \ NAT\n   processing from the NAT processing used for secure packets embedded\n\
    \   within an IPsec secure tunnel. \"Normal-NAT\" is the normal NAT\n   processing\
    \ as described in [Ref 1].\n"
- title: 2.2. IPsec Policy Controlled NAT (IPC-NAT)
  contents:
  - "2.2. IPsec Policy Controlled NAT (IPC-NAT)\n   The term \"IPsec Policy Controlled\
    \ NAT\" (IPC-NAT, for short) is\n   defined to describe the NAT transformation\
    \ applied as an extension of\n   IPsec transformation to packets embedded within\
    \ an IP-IP tunnel, for\n   which the NAT node is a tunnel end point. IPC-NAT function\
    \ is\n   essentially an adaptation of NAT extensions to embedded packets of\n\
    \   tunnel-mode IPsec. Packets subject to IPC-NAT processing are\n   beneficiaries\
    \ of IPsec security between the NAT device and an\n   external peer entity, be\
    \ it a host or a gateway node.\n   IPsec policies place restrictions on what NAT\
    \ mappings are used.  For\n   example, IPsec access control security policies\
    \ to a peer gateway\n   will likely restrict communication to only certain addresses\
    \ and/or\n   port numbers. Thus, when NAT performs translations, it must insure\n\
    \   that the translations it performs are consist with the security\n   policies.\n\
    \   Just as with Normal-NAT, IPC-NAT function can assume any of NAT\n   flavors,\
    \ including Traditional-NAT, Bi-directional-NAT and Twice-NAT.\n   An IPC-NAT\
    \ device would support both IPC-NAT and normal-NAT\n   functions.\n"
- title: 3. Security model of IPC-NAT
  contents:
  - "3. Security model of IPC-NAT\n   The IP security architecture document [Ref 2]\
    \ describes how IP\n   network level security may be accomplished within a globally\
    \ unique\n   address realm. Transport and tunnel mode security are discussed.\
    \ For\n   purposes of this document, we will assume IPsec security to mean\n \
    \  tunnel mode IPsec security, unless specified otherwise. Elements\n   fundamental\
    \ to this security architecture are (a) Security Policies,\n   that determine\
    \ which packets are permitted to be subject to Security\n   processing, and (b)\
    \ Security Association Attributes that identify the\n   parameters for security\
    \ processing, including IPsec protocols,\n   algorithms and session keys to be\
    \ applied.\n   Operation of tunnel mode IPsec security on a device that does not\n\
    \   support Network Address Translation may be described as below in\n   figures\

    \   Figure 2. Operation of Tunnel-Mode IPsec on Incoming packets\n   A NAT device\
    \ that provides tunnel-mode IPsec security would be\n   required to administer\
    \ security policies based on private realm\n   addressing. Further, the security\
    \ policies determine the IPsec tunnel\n   end-point peer. As a result, a packet\
    \ may be required to undergo\n   different type of NAT translation depending upon\
    \ the tunnel end-point\n   the IPsec node peers with. In other words, IPC-NAT\
    \ will need a unique\n   set of NAT maps for each security policy configured.\
    \ IPC-NAT will\n   perform address translation in conjunction with IPsec processing\n\
    \   differently with each peer, based on security policies.  The\n   following\
    \ diagrams (figure 3 and figure 4) illustrate the operation\n   of IPsec tunneling\
    \ in conjunction with NAT. Operation of an IPC-NAT\n   device may be distinguished\
    \ from that of an IPsec gateway that does\n   not support NAT as follows.\n  \
    \      (1) IPC-NAT device has security policies administered using\n         \
    \   private realm addressing. A traditional IPsec gateway will\n            have\
    \ its security policies administered using a single realm\n            (say, external\
    \ realm) addressing.\n        (2) Elements fundamental to the security model of\
    \ an IPC-NAT\n            device includes IPC-NAT address mapping  (and other\
    \ NAT\n            parameter definitions) in conjunction with Security policies\n\
    \            and SA attributes. Fundamental elements of a traditional\n      \
    \      IPsec gateway are limited only to Security policies and SA\n          \
    \  attributes.\n            +---------------+      +-------------------------+\n\

    \ sessions\n   to be translated. All other flavors of NAT are Bi-directional.\
    \  Any\n   and all flavors of NAT mapping may be used in conjunction with the\n\
    \   security policies and secure processing on an IPC-NAT device. For\n   illustration\
    \ purposes in this document, we will assume tunnel mode\n   IPsec on a Bi-directional\
    \ NAT device.\n   Notice however that a NAT device capable of providing security\
    \ across\n   IPsec tunnels can continue to support Normal-NAT for packets that\
    \ do\n   not require IPC-NAT. Address mapping and other NAT parameter\n   definitions\
    \ for Normal-NAT and IPC-NAT are distinct. Figure 3\n   identifies how a NAT device\
    \ distinguishes between outgoing packets\n   that need to be processed through\
    \ Normal-NAT vs. IPC-NAT. As for\n   packets incoming from external realm, figure\
    \ 4 outlines packets that\n   may be subject to IPC-NAT. All other packets are\
    \ subject to Normal-\n   NAT processing only.\n"
- title: 4. Operation of IKE protocol on IPC-NAT device.
  contents:
  - "4. Operation of IKE protocol on IPC-NAT device.\n   IPC-NAT operation described\
    \ in the previous section can be\n   accomplished based on manual session key\
    \ exchange or using an\n   automated key Exchange protocol between peering entities.\
    \ In this\n   section, we will consider adapting IETF recommended Internet Key\n\
    \   Exchange (IKE) protocol on a IPC-NAT device for automatic exchange of\n  \
    \ security policies and SA parameters. In other words, we will focus on\n   the\
    \ operation of IKE in conjunction with tunnel mode IPsec on NAT\n   devices. For\
    \ the reminder of this section, we will refer NAT device\n   to mean IPC-NAT device,\
    \ unless specified otherwise.\n   IKE is based on UDP protocol and uses public-key\
    \ encryption to\n   exchange session keys and other attributes securely across\
    \ an address\n   realm. The detailed protocol and operation of IKE in the context\
    \ of\n   IP may be found in [Ref 3] and [Ref 4]. Essentially, IKE has 2\n   phases.\n\
    \   In the first phase, IKE peers operate in main or aggressive mode to\n   authenticate\
    \ each other and set up a secure channel between\n   themselves. A NAT device\
    \  has an interface to the external realm and\n   is no different from any other\
    \ node in the realm to negotiate phase I\n   with peer external nodes. The NAT\
    \ device may assume any of the valid\n   Identity types and authentication methodologies\
    \ necessary to\n   communicate and authenticate with peers in the realm. The NAT\
    \ device\n   may also interface with a Certification Authority (CA) in the realm\n\
    \   to retrieve certificates  and perform signature validation.\n   In the second\
    \ phase, IKE peers operate in Quick Mode to exchange\n   policies and IPsec security\
    \ proposals to negotiate and agree upon\n   security transformation algorithms,\
    \ policies, keys, lifetime and\n   other security attributes. During this phase,\
    \ IKE process must\n   communicate with IPsec Engine to (a) collect secure session\n\
    \   attributes and other parameters  to negotiate with peer IKE nodes,\n   and\
    \ to (b) notify security parameters agreed upon (with peer) during\n   the negotiation.\n\
    \   An IPC-NAT device, operating as IPsec gateway, has the security\n   policies\
    \ administered based on private realm addressing. An ALG will\n   be required\
    \ to translate policies from private realm addressing into\n   external addressing,\
    \ as the IKE process needs to communicate these\n   policies to peers in external\
    \ realm. Note, IKE datagrams are not\n   subject to any NAT processing. IKE-ALG\
    \ simply translates select\n   portions of IKE payload as per the NAT map defined\
    \ for the policy\n   match. The following diagram illustrates how an IKE-ALG process\n\
    \   interfaces with IPC-NAT to take the security policies and IPC-NAT\n   maps\
    \ and generates security policies that IKE could communicate\n   during quick\
    \ mode to peers in the external realm.\n   Policies in quick mode are exchanged\
    \ with a peer as a combination of\n   IDci and IDcr payloads. The combination\
    \ of IDs (policies) exchanged\n   by each peer must match in order for the SA\
    \ parameters on either end\n   to be applied uniformly. If the IDs are not exchanged,\
    \ the assumption\n   would be that the Quick mode negotiated SA parameters are\
    \ applicable\n   between the IP addresses assumed by the main mode.\n   Depending\
    \ on the nature of security policies in place(ex: end-to-end\n   sessions between\
    \ a pair of nodes vs. sessions with an address range),\n   IKE-ALG may need to\
    \ request NAT to set up address bindings and/or\n   transport bindings for the\
    \ lifetime (in seconds or Kilo-Bytes) the\n   sessions are negotiated. In the\
    \ case the ALG is unable to setup the\n   necessary address bindings or transport\
    \ bindings, IKE-ALG will not be\n   able to translate security policies and that\
    \ will result in IKE not\n   pursuing phase II negotiation for the effected policies.\n\
    \   When the Negotiation is complete and successful, IKE will communicate\n  \
    \ the negotiated security parameters directly to the IPC-NAT gateway\n   engine\
    \ as described in the following diagram.\n                                   \

- title: 5.2. Secure Remote Access to Mobile Users of an Enterprise
  contents:
  - "5.2. Secure Remote Access to Mobile Users of an Enterprise\n   Say, a node from\
    \ an enterprise moves out of the enterprise, and\n   attempts to connect to the\
    \ enterprise from remote site, using a\n   temporary service provider assigned\
    \ address (Care-of-Address). In\n   such a case, the mobile user could setup an\
    \ IPsec tunnel session with\n   the corporate IPC-NAT device using a user-ID and\
    \ authentication\n   mechanism that is agreed upon. Further, the user may be configured\n\
    \   with enterprise DNS server, as an extension of authentication\n   following\
    \ IKE Phase I. This would allow the user to access enterprise\n   resources by\
    \ name.\n   However, many enterprise servers and applications rely on source IP\n\
    \   address for authentication and deny access for packets that do not\n   originate\
    \ from the enterprise address space. In these scenarios,\n   IPC-NAT has the ability\
    \ (unlike a traditional IPsec gateway) to\n   perform Network Address Translation\
    \ (NAT) for remote access users, so\n   their temporary address in external realm\
    \ is translated into a\n   enterprise domain address, while the packets are within\
    \ private\n   realm. The flavor of IPC-NAT performed would be traditional NAT\n\
    \   (i.e., assuming mobile-user address space to be private realm and\n   Enterprise\
    \ address space to be external realm), which can either be\n   Basic NAT (using\
    \ a block of enterprise addresses for translation) or\n   NAPT(using a single\
    \ enterprise address for translation).\n   The secure remote access application\
    \ described is pertinent to all\n   enterprises, irrespective of whether an enterprise\
    \ uses IANA\n   registered addresses or not.\n   The secure remote access application\
    \ described is different from\n   Mobile-IP in that, the mobile node (described\
    \ in this application)\n   does not retain the Home-Network address and simply\
    \ uses the Care-\n   Of-address for communication purposes. It is conceivable\
    \ for the\n   IPC-NAT Gateway to transparently provide Mobile-IP type connectivity\n\
    \   to the Mobile node by binding the mobile node's Care-of-Address with\n   its\
    \ Home Address. Provision of such an address mapping to IPC-NAT\n   gateway, however,\
    \ is not within the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   If NATs and ALGs are not in a trusted boundary,\
    \ that is a major\n   security problem, as ALGs snoop end user traffic payload.\n\
    \   Application level payload could be encrypted end-to-end, so long as\n   the\
    \ payload does not contain IP addresses and/or transport\n   identifiers that\
    \ are valid in only one of the realms. With the\n   exception of Realm-Specific\
    \ IP, end-to-end IP network level security\n   assured by current IPsec techniques\
    \ is not attainable with NATs in\n   between. The IPC-NAT model described in this\
    \ document outlines an\n   approach by which network level security may be obtained\
    \ within\n   external realm.\n   NATs, when combined with ALGs, can ensure that\
    \ the datagrams injected\n   into Internet have no private addresses in headers\
    \ or payload.\n   Applications that do not meet these requirements may be dropped\
    \ using\n   firewall filters. For this reason, it is not uncommon to find that\n\
    \   IPC-NATs, ALGs and firewalls co-exist to provide security at the\n   border\
    \ of a private network.\n"
