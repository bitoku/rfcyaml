- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPP has three main components:\n      1. A method for encapsulating\
    \ multi-protocol datagrams.\n      2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing,\
    \ configuring,\n         and testing the data-link connection.\n      3. A family\
    \ of Network Control Protocols for establishing and\n         configuring different\
    \ network-layer protocols.\n   In order to establish communications over a point-to-point\
    \ link, each\n   end of the PPP link must first send LCP packets to configure\
    \ and test\n   the data link.  After the link has been established and optional\n\
    \   facilities have been negotiated as needed by the LCP, PPP must send\n   BVCP\
    \ packets to choose and configure the VINES network-layer\n   protocol.  Once\
    \ BVCP has reached the Opened state, VINES datagrams\n   can be sent over the\
    \ link.\n   The link will remain configured for communications until explicit\
    \ LCP\n   or BVCP packets close the link down, or until some external event\n\
    \   occurs (an inactivity timer expires or network administrator\n   intervention).\n"
- title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Specification of Requirements\n   In this document, several words are used\
    \ to signify the requirements\n   of the specification.  These words are often\
    \ capitalized.\n   MUST      This word, or the adjective \"required\", means that\
    \ the\n             definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.\n\
    \   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute\n         \
    \    prohibition of the specification.\n   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective\
    \ \"recommended\", means that there\n             may exist valid reasons in particular\
    \ circumstances to\n             ignore this item, but the full implications must\
    \ be\n             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a\n      \
    \       different course.\n   MAY       This word, or the adjective \"optional\"\
    , means that this\n             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.\
    \  An\n             implementation which does not include this option MUST be\n\
    \             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which\n   \
    \          does include the option.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document frequently uses the following terms:\n  \
    \ datagram  The unit of transmission in the network layer (such as IP).\n    \
    \         A datagram may be encapsulated in one or more packets\n            \
    \ passed to the data link layer.\n   frame     The unit of transmission at the\
    \ data link layer.  A frame\n             may include a header and/or a trailer,\
    \ along with some\n             number of units of data.\n   packet    The basic\
    \ unit of encapsulation, which is passed across the\n             interface between\
    \ the network layer and the data link\n             layer.  A packet is usually\
    \ mapped to a frame; the\n             exceptions are when data link layer fragmentation\
    \ is being\n             performed, or when multiple packets are incorporated\
    \ into a\n             single frame.\n   peer      The other end of the point-to-point\
    \ link.\n   silently discard\n             This means the implementation discards\
    \ the packet without\n             further processing.  The implementation SHOULD\
    \ provide the\n             capability of logging the error, including the contents\
    \ of\n             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event\n\
    \             in a statistics counter.\n"
- title: 2.  A PPP Network Control Protocol for VINES
  contents:
  - "2.  A PPP Network Control Protocol for VINES\n   The Banyan VINES Control Protocol\
    \ (BVCP) is responsible for\n   configuring, enabling, and disabling the VINES\
    \ protocol modules on\n   both ends of the point-to-point link.  BVCP uses the\
    \ same packet\n   exchange mechanism as the Link Control Protocol.  BVCP packets\
    \ may\n   not be exchanged until PPP has reached the Network-Layer Protocol\n\
    \   phase.  BVCP packets received before this phase is reached should be\n   silently\
    \ discarded.\n   The Baynan VINES Control Protocol is exactly the same as the\
    \ Link\n   Control Protocol [1] with the following exceptions:\n   Frame Modifications\n\
    \      The packet may utilize any modifications to the basic frame format\n  \
    \    which have been negotiated during the Link Establishment phase.\n   Data\
    \ Link Layer Protocol Field\n      Exactly one BVCP packet is encapsulated in\
    \ the Information field\n      of a PPP Data Link Layer frame where the Protocol\
    \ field indicates\n      type hex 8035 (Banyan VINES Control Protocol).\n   Code\
    \ field\n      Only Codes 1 through 7 (Configure-Request, Configure-Ack,\n   \
    \   Configure-Nak, Configure-Reject, Terminate-Request, Terminate-Ack\n      and\
    \ Code-Reject) are used.  Other Codes should be treated as\n      unrecognized\
    \ and should result in Code-Rejects.\n   Timeouts\n      BVCP packets may not\
    \ be exchanged until PPP has reached the\n      Network-Layer Protocol phase.\
    \  An implementation should be\n      prepared to wait for Authentication and\
    \ Link Quality Determination\n      to finish before timing out waiting for a\
    \ Configure-Ack or other\n      response.  It is suggested that an implementation\
    \ give up only\n      after user intervention or a configurable amount of time.\n\
    \   Configuration Option Types\n      BVCP has a distinct set of Configuration\
    \ Options.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Sending VINES Datagrams
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Sending VINES Datagrams\n   Before any VINES datagrams may be communicated,\
    \ PPP must reach the\n   Network-Layer Protocol phase, and the Banyan VINES Control\
    \ Protocol\n   must reach the Opened state.\n   Exactly one VINES packet is encapsulated\
    \ in the Information field of\n   a PPP Data Link Layer frame where the Protocol\
    \ field indicates type\n   hex 0035 (Banyan VINES datagram).  The maximum length\
    \ of a VINES\n   datagram transmitted over a PPP link is the same as the maximum\n\
    \   length of the Information field of a PPP data link layer frame.\n   The format\
    \ of the Information field itself is the same as that\n   defined in [2].\n"
- title: 2.2.  General Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  General Considerations\n   VINES supports an Address Resolution Protocol,\
    \ VINES ARP, primarily\n   used for address assignment.  Since this protocol is\
    \ part of VINES\n   IP, it is fully supported over BVCP.  VINES also supports\
    \ a data-link\n   Echo Protocol (VINES Echo), used to test connectivity to a VINES\n\
    \   Server in a LAN environment, which is not supported over BVCP.\n"
- title: 3.  BVCP Configuration Options
  contents:
  - "3.  BVCP Configuration Options\n   BVCP Configuration Options allow modifications\
    \ to the standard\n   characteristics of the network-layer protocol to be negotiated.\
    \  If a\n   Configuration Option is not included in a Configure-Request packet,\n\
    \   the default value for that Configuration Option is assumed.\n   BVCP uses\
    \ the same Configuration Option format defined for LCP [1],\n   with a separate\
    \ set of Options.\n   Up-to-date values of the BVCP Option Type field are specified\
    \ in the\n   most recent \"Assigned Numbers\" RFC [3].  Current values are assigned\n\
    \   as follows:\n      Value   Option\n        1     BV-NS-RTP-Link-Type\n   \
    \     2     BV-FRP\n        3     BV-RTP\n        4     BV-Suppress-Broadcast\n\
    \   Note: A suggestion was made to combine the BV-NS-RTP-Link-Type option\n  \
    \ and the BV-RTP option into a single option that could negotiate one\n   of four\
    \ settings (S-RTP, NS-RTP-LAN, NS-RTP-WAN, NO-RTP).  This\n   suggestion has been\
    \ rejected because VINES must already deal with a\n   mix of S-RTP and NS-RTP,\
    \ and that pushing this information down to\n   the PPP layer is not desirable.\n"
- title: 3.1.  BV-NS-RTP-Link-Type
  contents:
  - "3.1.  BV-NS-RTP-Link-Type\n   Description\n      This Configuration Option provides\
    \ a way to negotiate the way the\n      Non-Sequenced Routing Update Protocol\
    \ (NS-RTP) (pre-VINES 5.5,\n      i.e., 4.11 and 5.0) will run on the link.  NS-RTP\
    \ handles updates\n      differently depending on whether the interface is a LAN\
    \ type or a\n      WAN type.  For a LAN type, the full routing table is rebroadcast\n\
    \      every update interval (90 seconds).  For a WAN type, the full\n      routing\
    \ table is only transmitted for the first 3 update intervals\n      after the\
    \ link comes up.  After that only changes are transmitted\n      (for 5 update\
    \ intervals).  Note that this has no effect if\n      Sequenced RTP (VINES 5.5)\
    \ is being used.  More information on this\n      can be found in [2].\n     \
    \ This option negotiates what an implementation is willing to\n      receive,\

    \   sequence number.  With PPP's default MRU of 1500, FRP is not\n      normally\
    \ needed, and no FRP header would be sent with the VINES\n      packet.  If a\
    \ MRU of less than 1484 is negotiated, FRP will be\n      needed to send a full\
