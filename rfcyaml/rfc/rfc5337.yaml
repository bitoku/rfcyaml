- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   When an email message is transmitted using the UTF8SMTP\
    \ [RFC5336]\n   extension and Internationalized Email Headers [RFC5335], it is\n\
    \   sometimes necessary to return that message or generate a Message\n   Disposition\
    \ Notification (MDN) [RFC3798].  As a message sent to\n   multiple recipients\
    \ can generate a status and disposition\n   notification for each recipient, it\
    \ is helpful if a client can\n   correlate these notifications based on the recipient\
    \ address it\n   provided; thus, preservation of the original recipient is important.\n\
    \   This specification describes how to preserve the original recipient\n   and\
    \ updates the MDN and DSN formats to support the new address types.\n"

- title: 3.  UTF-8 Address Type
  contents:
  - "3.  UTF-8 Address Type\n   An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications\n\
    \   [RFC3464] defines the concept of an address type.  The address format\n  \
    \ introduced in Internationalized Email Headers [RFC5335] is a new\n   address\
    \ type.  The syntax for the new address type in the context of\n   status notifications\
    \ is specified at the end of this section.\n   An SMTP [RFC2821] server that advertises\
    \ both the UTF8SMTP extension\n   [RFC5336] and the DSN extension [RFC3461] MUST\
    \ accept a UTF-8 address\n   type in the ORCPT parameter including 8-bit UTF-8\
    \ characters.  This\n   address type also includes a 7-bit encoding suitable for\
    \ use in a\n   message/delivery-status body part or an ORCPT parameter sent to\
    \ an\n   SMTP server that does not advertise UTF8SMTP.\n   This address type has\
    \ 3 forms: utf-8-addr-xtext, utf-8-addr-unitext,\n   and utf-8-address.  The first\
    \ 2 forms are 7-bit safe.\n   The utf-8-address form is only suitable for use\
    \ in newly defined\n   protocols capable of native representation of 8-bit characters.\
    \  That\n   is, the utf-8-address form MUST NOT be used in the ORCPT parameter\n\
    \   when the SMTP server doesn't advertise support for UTF8SMTP or the\n   SMTP\
    \ server supports UTF8SMTP, but the address contains US-ASCII\n   characters not\
    \ permitted in the ORCPT parameter (e.g., the ORCPT\n   parameter forbids unencoded\
    \ SP and the = character), or in a 7-bit\n   transport environment including a\
    \ message/delivery-status Original-\n   Recipient or Final-Recipient field.  In\
    \ the former case, the utf-8-\n   addr-xtext form (see below) MUST be used instead;\
    \ in the latter case,\n   the utf-8-addr-unitext form MUST be used.  The utf-8-address\
    \ form MAY\n   be used in the ORCPT parameter when the SMTP server also advertises\n\
    \   support for UTF8SMTP and the address doesn't contain any US-ASCII\n   characters\
    \ not permitted in the ORCPT parameter.  It SHOULD be used\n   in a message/global-delivery-status\
    \ Original-Recipient or Final-\n   Recipient DSN field, or in an Original-Recipient\
    \ header field\n   [RFC3798] if the message is a UTF8SMTP message.\n   In addition,\
    \ the utf-8-addr-unitext form can be used anywhere where\n   the utf-8-address\
    \ form is allowed.\n   When using in the ORCPT parameter, the UTF-8 address type\
    \ requires\n   that US-ASCII CTLs, SP, \\, +, and = be encoded using xtext encoding\n\
    \   as described in [RFC3461].  This is described by the utf-8-addr-xtext\n  \
    \ form in the ABNF below.  Unicode characters MAY be included in a\n   UTF-8 address\
    \ type using a \"\\x{HEXPOINT}\" syntax\n   (EmbeddedUnicodeChar), where HEXPOINT\
    \ is 2 to 6 hexadecimal digits.\n   When sending data to a UTF8SMTP-capable server,\
    \ native UTF-8\n   characters SHOULD be used instead of the EmbeddedUnicodeChar\
    \ syntax\n   described in details below.  When sending data to an SMTP server\
    \ that\n   does not advertise UTF8SMTP, then the EmbeddedUnicodeChar syntax MUST\n\
    \   be used instead of UTF-8.\n   When the ORCPT parameter is placed in a message/\n\
    \   global-delivery-status Original-Recipient field, the utf-8-addr-xtext\n  \
    \ form of the UTF-8 address type SHOULD be converted to the utf-8-\n   address\
    \ form (see the ABNF below) by removing all xtext encoding\n   first (which will\
    \ result in the utf-8-addr-unitext form), followed by\n   removal of the unitext\
    \ encoding.  However, if an address is labeled\n   with the UTF-8 address type\
    \ but does not conform to utf-8 syntax,\n   then it MUST be copied into the message/global-delivery-status\
    \ field\n   without alteration.\n   The ability to encode characters with the\
    \ EmbeddedUnicodeChar\n   encodings should be viewed as a transitional mechanism.\
    \  It is hoped\n   that as systems lacking support for UTF8SMTP become less common\
    \ over\n   time, these encodings can eventually be phased out.\n   In the ABNF\
    \ below, all productions not defined in this document are\n   defined in Appendix\
    \ B of [RFC5234], in Section 4 of [RFC3629], or in\n   [RFC3464].\n  utf-8-type-addr\

- title: 4.  UTF-8 Delivery Status Notifications
  contents:
  - "4.  UTF-8 Delivery Status Notifications\n   A traditional delivery status notification\
    \ [RFC3464] comes in a\n   three-part multipart/report [RFC3462] container, where\
    \ the first part\n   is human-readable text describing the error, the second part\
    \ is a\n   7-bit-only message/delivery-status, and the optional third part is\n\
    \   used for content (message/rfc822) or header (text/rfc822-headers)\n   return.\
    \  As the present DSN format does not permit returning of\n   undeliverable UTF8SMTP\
    \ messages, three new media types are needed.\n   The first type, message/global-delivery-status,\
    \ has the syntax of\n   message/delivery-status with three modifications.  First,\
    \ the charset\n   for message/global-delivery-status is UTF-8, and thus any field\
    \ MAY\n   contain UTF-8 characters when appropriate (see the ABNF below).  In\n\
    \   particular, the Diagnostic-Code field MAY contain UTF-8 as described\n   in\
    \ UTF8SMTP [RFC5336]; the Diagnostic-Code field SHOULD be in\n   i-default language\
    \ [DEFAULTLANG].  Second, systems generating a\n   message/global-delivery-status\
    \ body part SHOULD use the utf-8-address\n   form of the UTF-8 address type for\
    \ all addresses containing\n   characters outside the US-ASCII repertoire.  These\
    \ systems SHOULD up-\n   convert the utf-8-addr-xtext or the utf-8-addr-unitext\
    \ form of a\n   UTF-8 address type in the ORCPT parameter to the utf-8-address\
    \ form\n   of a UTF-8 address type in the Original-Recipient field.  Third, a\n\
    \   new optional field called Localized-Diagnostic is added.  Each\n   instance\
    \ includes a language tag [LANGTAGS] and contains text in the\n   specified language.\
    \  This is equivalent to the text part of the\n   Diagnostic-Code field.  All\
    \ instances of Localized-Diagnostic MUST\n   use different language tags.  The\

    \ type, used for returning the content, is message/global\n   which is similar\
    \ to message/rfc822, except it contains a message with\n   UTF-8 headers.  This\
    \ media type is described in [RFC5335].\n   The third type, used for returning\
    \ the headers, is message/\n   global-headers and contains only the UTF-8 header\
    \ fields of a message\n   (all lines prior to the first blank line in a UTF8SMTP\
    \ message).\n   Unlike message/global, this body part provides no difficulties\
    \ for\n   the present infrastructure.\n   Note that as far as multipart/report\
    \ [RFC3462] container is\n   concerned, message/global-delivery-status, message/global,\
    \ and\n   message/global-headers MUST be treated as equivalent to message/\n \
    \  delivery-status, message/rfc822, and text/rfc822-headers.  That is,\n   implementations\
    \ processing multipart/report MUST expect any\n   combinations of the 6 MIME types\
    \ mentioned above inside a multipart/\n   report MIME type.\n   All three new\
    \ types will typically use the \"8bit\" Content-Transfer-\n   Encoding.  (In the\
    \ event all content is 7-bit, the equivalent\n   traditional types for delivery\
    \ status notifications MAY be used.  For\n   example, if information in message/global-delivery-status\
    \ part can be\n   represented without any loss of information as message/\n  \
    \ delivery-status, then the message/delivery-status body part may be\n   used.)\
    \  Note that [RFC5335] relaxed restriction from MIME [RFC2046]\n   regarding use\
    \ of Content-Transfer-Encoding in new \"message\" subtypes.\n   This specification\
    \ explicitly allows use of Content-Transfer-Encoding\n   in message/global-headers\
    \ and message/global-delivery-status.  This\n   is not believed to be problematic\
    \ as these new MIME types are\n   intended primarily for use by newer systems\
    \ with full support for\n   8-bit MIME and UTF-8 headers.\n"

  - "5.  UTF-8 Message Disposition Notifications\n   Message Disposition Notifications\
    \ [RFC3798] have a similar design and\n   structure to DSNs.  As a result, they\

    \ (message/\n   global) or header (message/global-headers), same as for DSNs.\

    \ with two modifications.  First, the charset\n   for message/global-disposition-notification\
    \ is UTF-8, and thus any\n   field MAY contain UTF-8 characters when appropriate\
    \ (see the ABNF\n   below).  (In particular, the failure-field, the error-field,\

    \ Original-Recipient or Final-Recipient field.\n   The utf-8-addr-xtext form MUST\

    \ or Final-\n   Recipient DSN field; or in an Original-Recipient header field\n\
    \   [RFC3798] if the message is a UTF8SMTP message.\n   In addition, the utf-8-addr-unitext\
    \ form can be used anywhere where\n   the utf-8-address form is allowed.\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Automated use of report types without authentication\
    \ presents several\n   security issues.  Forging negative reports presents the\
    \ opportunity\n   for denial-of-service attacks when the reports are used for\
    \ automated\n   maintenance of directories or mailing lists.  Forging positive\n\
    \   reports may cause the sender to incorrectly believe a message was\n   delivered\
    \ when it was not.\n   Malicious users can generate report structures designed\
    \ to trigger\n   coding flaws in report parsers.  Report parsers need to use secure\n\
    \   coding techniques to avoid the risk of buffer overflow or denial-of-\n   service\
    \ attacks against parser coding mistakes.  Code reviews of such\n   parsers are\
    \ also recommended.\n   Malicious users of the email system regularly send messages\
    \ with\n   forged envelope return paths, and these messages trigger delivery\n\
    \   status reports that result in a large amount of unwanted traffic on\n   the\
    \ Internet.  Many users choose to ignore delivery status\n   notifications because\
    \ they are usually the result of \"blowback\" from\n   forged messages and thus\
    \ never notice when messages they sent go\n   undelivered.  As a result, support\
    \ for correlation of delivery status\n   and message disposition notification\
    \ messages with sent-messages has\n   become a critical feature of mail clients\
    \ and possibly mail stores if\n   the email infrastructure is to remain reliable.\
    \  In the short term,\n   simply correlating message-IDs may be sufficient to\
    \ distinguish true\n   status notifications from those resulting from forged originator\n\
    \   addresses.  But in the longer term, including cryptographic signature\n  \
    \ material that can securely associate the status notification with the\n   original\
    \ message is advisable.\n   As this specification permits UTF-8 in additional\
    \ fields, the\n   security considerations of UTF-8 [RFC3629] apply.\n"
