- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   A number of RFCs (including [RFC2559], [RFC2560], and [RFC2585])\
    \ have\n   specified operational protocols for retrieval of PKI data, including\n\
    \   public-key certificates and revocation information, from PKI\n   repositories.\
    \  These RFCs assume that a certificate-using system has\n   the information necessary\
    \ to identify, locate, and connect to the PKI\n   repository with a specific protocol.\
    \  Although some tools are\n   available in protocol-specific environments for\
    \ this purpose, such as\n   knowledge references in directory systems, these are\
    \ restricted for\n   use with a single protocol and do not share a common means\
    \ of\n   publication.  This document provides a solution to this problem\n   through\
    \ the use of Service Record (SRV) Resource Records (RRs) in\n   DNS.  This solution\
    \ is expected to be particularly useful in\n   environments where only a domain\
    \ name is available.  In other\n   situations (e.g., where a certificate is available\
    \ that contains the\n   required information), such a DNS lookup is not needed.\n\
    \   [RFC2782] defines a DNS RR for specifying the location of services\n   (SRV).\
    \  This document defines SRV records for a PKI repository\n   locator service\
    \ to enable PKI clients to obtain the necessary\n   information to connect to\
    \ a domain's PKI repository, including\n   information about each protocol that\
    \ is supported by that domain for\n   access to its repository.  This document\
    \ includes the definition of\n   an SRV RR format for this service and an example\
    \ of its potential use\n   in an email environment.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",\n   \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this document (in uppercase,\n   as shown) are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in [RFC2119].\n   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines\
    \ sent by the client and\n   server, respectively.\n"
- title: 2.  SRV RR Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  SRV RR Definition\n   The format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type code is 33,\
    \ is:\n    _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target\n  \
    \ For the PKI repository locator service, this document uses the\n   symbolic\
    \ name \"PKIXREP\".  Note that when used in an SRV RR, this name\n   MUST be prepended\
    \ with an \"_\" character.\n   The protocols that can be included in PKIXREP SRV\
    \ RRs are:\n      Protocol     SRV Prefix\n      LDAP         _LDAP\n      HTTP\
    \         _HTTP\n      OCSP         _OCSP\n"
- title: 2.1.  Assignment of New Protocol Prefixes
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Assignment of New Protocol Prefixes\n   Protocol prefix assignments for\
    \ new PKIX repository protocols SHOULD\n   be defined in the document that specifies\
    \ the protocol.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Use of Multiple Repositories
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Use of Multiple Repositories\n   The existence of multiple repositories\
    \ MAY be determined by making\n   separate DNS queries for each of the protocols\
    \ supported by the\n   client.\n   If this approach is found to be unacceptably\
    \ inefficient due to a\n   proliferation of repository protocols at a future date,\
    \ the service\n   discovery protocol could be extended to allow the repository\
    \ to\n   advertise the protocols supported.\n"
- title: 2.3.  SRV RR Example
  contents:
  - "2.3.  SRV RR Example\n   This example uses the fictional domain \"example.com\"\
    \ as an aid in\n   understanding the use of SRV records by a certificate-using\
    \ system.\n   Assume that Alice is an email client that needs a certificate for\
    \ a\n   recipient.  Alice's client system supports LDAP for certificate\n   retrieval.\
    \  Assume the message recipient is Bob and that Bob's email\n   address is bob@example.com.\
    \  Assume that example.test maintains a\n   \"border directory\" PKI repository\
    \ and that Bob's certificate is\n   available from that directory, \"border.example.com\"\
    , via LDAP.\n   Alice's client system retrieves, via DNS, the SRV record for\n\
    \   _PKIXREP._LDAP.example.com.\n      -  The QNAME of the DNS query is _PKIXREP._LDAP.example.com.\n\
    \      - The QCLASS of the DNS query is IN.\n      -  The QTYPE of the DNS query\
    \ is SRV.\n   The result SHOULD include the host address for example.com's border\n\
    \   directory system.\n   Note that if example.com operated its service on a number\
    \ of hosts,\n   more than one SRV RR would be returned.  In this case, RFC 2782\n\
    \   defines the procedure to be followed in determining which of these\n   should\
    \ be accessed first.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Security issues regarding PKI repositories themselves\
    \ are outside the\n   scope of this document.  For LDAP repositories, for example,\
    \ specific\n   security considerations are addressed in RFC 2559.\n   Security\
    \ issues with respect to the use of SRV records in general are\n   addressed in\
    \ RFC 2782, and these issues apply to the use of SRV\n   records in the context\
    \ of the PKIXREP service defined here.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document reserves the use of \"_PKIXREP\" service\
    \ label.  Since\n   this relates to a service that may pass messages over a number\
    \ of\n   different message transports, each message must be associated with a\n\
    \   specific transport.\n   In order to ensure that the association between \"\
    _PKIXREP\" and their\n   respective underlying services is deterministic, the\
    \ IANA has created\n   a new registry: PKIX SRV Protocol Labels.\n   For this\
    \ registry, an entry shall consist of a label name and a\n   pointer to a specification\
    \ describing how the protocol named in the\n   label uses SRV.  Specifications\
    \ should conform to the requirements\n   listed in [RFC2434] for \"specification\
    \ required\".\n"
