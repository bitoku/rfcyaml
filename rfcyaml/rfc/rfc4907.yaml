    \ which nodes can\n        communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately\
    \ below\n        the Internet Protocol (IP).\n   Link Down\n        An event provided\
    \ by the link layer that signifies a state\n        change associated with the\

    \ model a multi-homed host as a set of\n        logical hosts within the same\
    \ physical host.  In the Strong End\n        System model, addresses refer to\
    \ an interface, rather than to\n        the host to which they attach.  As a result,\
    \ packets sent on an\n        outgoing interface have a source address configured\
    \ on that\n        interface, and incoming packets whose destination address does\n\

    \  received are silently discarded.\n   Weak End System Model\n        In the\
    \ Weak End System model, addresses refer to a host.  As a\n        result, packets\
    \ sent on an outgoing interface need not\n        necessarily have a source address\
    \ configured on that interface,\n        and incoming packets whose destination\
    \ address does not\n        correspond to the physical interface through which\
    \ it is\n        received are accepted.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Overview\n   The use of link indications within the Internet architecture\
    \ has a\n   long history.  In response to an attempt to send to a host that was\n\
    \   off-line, the ARPANET link layer protocol provided a \"Destination\n   Dead\"\
    \ indication, described in \"Fault Isolation and Recovery\"\n   [RFC816].  The\
    \ ARPANET packet radio experiment [PRNET] incorporated\n   frame loss in the calculation\
    \ of routing metrics, a precursor to more\n   recent link-aware routing metrics\
    \ such as Expected Transmission Count\n   (ETX), described in \"A High-Throughput\
    \ Path Metric for Multi-Hop\n   Wireless Routing\" [ETX].\n   \"Routing Information\
    \ Protocol\" [RFC1058] defined RIP, which is\n   descended from the Xerox Network\
    \ Systems (XNS) Routing Information\n   Protocol.  \"The OSPF Specification\"\
    \ [RFC1131] defined Open Shortest\n   Path First, which uses Link State Advertisements\
    \ (LSAs) in order to\n   flood information relating to link status within an OSPF\
    \ area.\n   [RFC2328] defines version 2 of OSPF.  While these and other routing\n\
    \   protocols can utilize \"Link Up\" and \"Link Down\" indications provided\n\
    \   by those links that support them, they also can detect link loss\n   based\
    \ on loss of routing packets.  As noted in \"Requirements for IP\n   Version 4\
    \ Routers\" [RFC1812]:\n   It is crucial that routers have workable mechanisms\
    \ for determining\n   that their network connections are functioning properly.\
    \  Failure to\n   detect link loss, or failure to take the proper actions when\
    \ a\n   problem is detected, can lead to black holes.\n   Attempts have also been\
    \ made to define link indications other than\n   \"Link Up\" and \"Link Down\"\
    .  \"Dynamically Switched Link Control\n   Protocol\" [RFC1307] defines an experimental\
    \ protocol for control of\n   links, incorporating \"Down\", \"Coming Up\", \"\
    Up\", \"Going Down\", \"Bring\n   Down\", and \"Bring Up\" states.\n   \"A Generalized\
    \ Model for Link Layer Triggers\" [GenTrig] defines\n   \"generic triggers\",\
    \ including \"Link Up\", \"Link Down\", \"Link Going\n   Down\", \"Link Going\
    \ Up\", \"Link Quality Crosses Threshold\", \"Trigger\n   Rollback\", and \"Better\
    \ Signal Quality AP Available\".  IEEE 802.21\n   [IEEE-802.21] defines a Media\
    \ Independent Handover Event Service\n   (MIH-ES) that provides event reporting\
    \ relating to link\n   characteristics, link status, and link quality.  Events\
    \ defined\n   include \"Link Down\", \"Link Up\", \"Link Going Down\", \"Link\
    \ Signal\n   Strength\", and \"Link Signal/Noise Ratio\".\n   Under ideal conditions,\
    \ links in the \"up\" state experience low frame\n   loss in both directions and\
    \ are immediately ready to send and receive\n   data frames; links in the \"down\"\
    \ state are unsuitable for sending and\n   receiving data frames in either direction.\n\
    \   Unfortunately, links frequently exhibit non-ideal behavior.  Wired\n   links\
    \ may fail in half-duplex mode, or exhibit partial impairment\n   resulting in\
    \ intermediate loss rates.  Wireless links may exhibit\n   asymmetry, intermittent\
    \ frame loss, or rapid changes in throughput\n   due to interference or signal\
    \ fading.  In both wired and wireless\n   links, the link state may rapidly flap\
    \ between the \"up\" and \"down\"\n   states.  This real-world behavior presents\
    \ challenges to the\n   integration of link indications with the Internet, transport,\
    \ and\n   application layers.\n"

- title: 1.4.1.  Internet Layer
  contents:
  - "1.4.1.  Internet Layer\n   One of the functions of the Internet layer is to shield\
    \ higher layers\n   from the specifics of link behavior.  As a result, the Internet\
    \ layer\n   validates and filters link indications and selects outgoing and\n\
    \   incoming interfaces based on routing metrics.\n   The Internet layer composes\
    \ its routing table based on information\n   available from local interfaces as\
    \ well as potentially by taking into\n   account information provided by routers.\
    \  This enables the state of\n   the local routing table to reflect link conditions\
    \ on both local and\n   remote links.  For example, prefixes to be added or removed\
    \ from the\n   routing table may be determined from Dynamic Host Configuration\n\
    \   Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131][RFC3315], Router Advertisements\n   [RFC1256][RFC2461],\
    \ redirect messages, or route updates incorporating\n   information on the state\
    \ of links multiple hops away.\n   As described in \"Packetization Layer Path\
    \ MTU Discovery\" [RFC4821],\n   the Internet layer may maintain a path information\
    \ cache, enabling\n   sharing of Path MTU information between concurrent or subsequent\n\
    \   connections.  The shared cache is accessed and updated by\n   packetization\
    \ protocols implementing packetization layer Path MTU\n   Discovery.\n   The Internet\
    \ layer also utilizes link indications in order to\n   optimize aspects of Internet\
    \ Protocol (IP) configuration and\n   mobility.  After receipt of a \"Link Up\"\
    \ indication, hosts validate\n   potential IP configurations by Detecting Network\
    \ Attachment (DNA)\n   [RFC4436].  Once the IP configuration is confirmed, it\
    \ may be\n   determined that an address change has occurred.  However, \"Link\
    \ Up\"\n   indications may not necessarily result in a change to Internet layer\n\
    \   configuration.\n   In \"Detecting Network Attachment in IPv4\" [RFC4436],\
    \ after receipt of\n   a \"Link Up\" indication, potential IP configurations are\
    \ validated\n   using a bidirectional reachability test.  In \"Detecting Network\n\
    \   Attachment in IPv6 Networks (DNAv6)\" [DNAv6], IP configuration is\n   validated\
    \ using reachability detection and Router\n   Solicitation/Advertisement.\n  \
    \ The routing sub-layer may utilize link indications in order to enable\n   more\
    \ rapid response to changes in link state and effective\n   throughput.  Link\
    \ rate is often used in computing routing metrics.\n   However, in wired networks\
    \ the transmission rate may be negotiated in\n   order to enhance energy efficiency\
    \ [EfficientEthernet].  In wireless\n   networks, the negotiated rate and Frame\
    \ Error Rate (FER) may change\n   with link conditions so that effective throughput\
    \ may vary on a\n   packet-by-packet basis.  In such situations, routing metrics\
    \ may also\n   exhibit rapid variation.\n   Routing metrics incorporating link\
    \ indications such as Link Up/Down\n   and effective throughput enable routers\
    \ to take link conditions into\n   account for the purposes of route selection.\
    \  If a link experiences\n   decreased rate or high frame loss, the route metric\
    \ will increase for\n   the prefixes that it serves, encouraging use of alternate\
    \ paths if\n   available.  When the link condition improves, the route metric\
    \ will\n   decrease, encouraging use of the link.\n   Within Weak End System implementations,\

- title: 1.4.2.  Transport Layer
  contents:
  - "1.4.2.  Transport Layer\n   The transport layer processes received link indications\
    \ differently\n   for the purposes of transport parameter estimation and connection\n\
    \   management.\n   For the purposes of parameter estimation, the transport layer\
    \ is\n   primarily interested in path properties that impact performance, and\n\
    \   where link indications may be determined to be relevant to path\n   properties\
    \ they may be utilized directly.  Link indications such as\n   \"Link Up\"/\"\
    Link Down\" or changes in rate, delay, and frame loss may\n   prove relevant.\
    \  This will not always be the case, however; where the\n   bandwidth of the bottleneck\
    \ on the end-to-end path is already much\n   lower than the transmission rate,\
    \ an increase in transmission rate\n   may not materially affect path properties.\
    \  As described in Appendix\n   A.3, the algorithms for utilizing link layer indications\
    \ to improve\n   transport parameter estimates are still under development.\n\
    \   Strict layering considerations do not apply in transport path\n   parameter\
    \ estimation in order to enable the transport layer to make\n   use of all available\
    \ information.  For example, the transport layer\n   may determine that a link\
    \ indication came from a link forming part of\n   a path of one or more connections.\
    \  In this case, it may utilize the\n   receipt of a \"Link Down\" indication\
    \ followed by a subsequent \"Link\n   Up\" indication to infer the possibility\
    \ of non-congestive packet loss\n   during the period between the indications,\
    \ even if the IP\n   configuration does not change as a result, so that no Internet\
    \ layer\n   indication would be sent.\n   The transport layer may also find Internet\
    \ layer indications useful\n   for path parameter estimation.  For example, path\
    \ change indications\n   can be used as a signal to reset path parameter estimates.\
    \  Where\n   there is no default route, loss of segments sent to a destination\n\
    \   lacking a prefix in the local routing table may be assumed to be due\n   to\
    \ causes other than congestion, regardless of the reason for the\n   removal (either\
    \ because local link conditions caused it to be removed\n   or because the route\
    \ was withdrawn by a remote router).\n   For the purposes of connection management,\
    \ layering considerations\n   are important.  The transport layer may tear down\
    \ a connection based\n   on Internet layer indications (such as a endpoint address\
    \ changes),\n   but does not take link indications into account.  Just as a \"\
    Link Up\"\n   event may not result in a configuration change, and a configuration\n\
    \   change may not result in connection teardown, the transport layer\n   does\
    \ not tear down connections on receipt of a \"Link Down\"\n   indication, regardless\
    \ of the cause.  Where the \"Link Down\"\n   indication results from frame loss\
    \ rather than an explicit exchange,\n   the indication may be transient, to be\
    \ soon followed by a \"Link Up\"\n   indication.\n   Even where the \"Link Down\"\
    \ indication results from an explicit\n   exchange such as receipt of a Point-to-Point\
    \ Protocol (PPP) Link\n   Control Protocol (LCP)-Terminate or an IEEE 802.11 Disassociate\
    \ or\n   Deauthenticate frame, an alternative point of attachment may be\n   available,\
    \ allowing connectivity to be quickly restored.  As a\n   result, robustness is\
    \ best achieved by allowing connections to remain\n   up until an endpoint address\
    \ changes, or the connection is torn down\n   due to lack of response to repeated\
    \ retransmission attempts.\n   For the purposes of connection management, the\
    \ transport layer is\n   cautious with the use of Internet layer indications.\
    \  Changes in the\n   routing table are not relevant for the purposes of connection\n\
    \   management, since it is desirable for connections to remain up during\n  \
    \ transitory routing flaps.  However, the transport layer may tear down\n   transport\
    \ connections due to invalidation of a connection endpoint IP\n   address.  Where\
    \ the connection has been established based on a Mobile\n   IP home address, a\
    \ change in the Care-of Address need not result in\n   connection teardown, since\
    \ the configuration change is masked by the\n   mobility functionality within\
    \ the Internet layer, and is therefore\n   transparent to the transport layer.\n\
    \   \"Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers\" [RFC1122],\n \
    \  Section 2.4, requires Destination Unreachable, Source Quench, Echo\n   Reply,\
    \ Timestamp Reply, and Time Exceeded ICMP messages to be passed\n   up to the\
    \ transport layer.  [RFC1122], Section 4.2.3.9, requires\n   Transmission Control\
    \ Protocol (TCP) to react to an Internet Control\n   Message Protocol (ICMP) Source\
    \ Quench by slowing transmission.\n   [RFC1122], Section 4.2.3.9, distinguishes\
    \ between ICMP messages\n   indicating soft error conditions, which must not cause\
    \ TCP to abort a\n   connection, and hard error conditions, which should cause\
    \ an abort.\n   ICMP messages indicating soft error conditions include Destination\n\
    \   Unreachable codes 0 (Net), 1 (Host), and 5 (Source Route Failed),\n   which\
    \ may result from routing transients; Time Exceeded; and\n   Parameter Problem.\
    \  ICMP messages indicating hard error conditions\n   include Destination Unreachable\
    \ codes 2 (Protocol Unreachable), 3\n   (Port Unreachable), and 4 (Fragmentation\
    \ Needed and Don't Fragment\n   Was Set).  Since hosts implementing classical\
    \ ICMP-based Path MTU\n   Discovery [RFC1191] use Destination Unreachable code\
    \ 4, they do not\n   treat this as a hard error condition.  Hosts implementing\
    \ \"Path MTU\n   Discovery for IP version 6\" [RFC1981] utilize ICMPv6 Packet\
    \ Too Big\n   messages.  As noted in \"TCP Problems with Path MTU Discovery\"\n\
    \   [RFC2923], classical Path MTU Discovery is vulnerable to failure if\n   ICMP\
    \ messages are not delivered or processed.  In order to address\n   this problem,\
    \ \"Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery\" [RFC4821] does\n   depend on the\
    \ delivery of ICMP messages.\n   \"Fault Isolation and Recovery\" [RFC816], Section\
    \ 6, states:\n   It is not obvious, when error messages such as ICMP Destination\n\
    \   Unreachable arrive, whether TCP should abandon the connection.  The\n   reason\
    \ that error messages are difficult to interpret is that, as\n   discussed above,\
    \ after a failure of a gateway or network, there is a\n   transient period during\
    \ which the gateways may have incorrect\n   information, so that irrelevant or\
    \ incorrect error messages may\n   sometimes return.  An isolated ICMP Destination\
    \ Unreachable may\n   arrive at a host, for example, if a packet is sent during\
    \ the period\n   when the gateways are trying to find a new route.  To abandon\
    \ a TCP\n   connection based on such a message arriving would be to ignore the\n\
    \   valuable feature of the Internet that for many internal failures it\n   reconstructs\
    \ its function without any disruption of the end points.\n   \"Requirements for\
    \ IP Version 4 Routers\" [RFC1812], Section 4.3.3.3,\n   states that \"Research\
    \ seems to suggest that Source Quench consumes\n   network bandwidth but is an\
    \ ineffective (and unfair) antidote to\n   congestion\", indicating that routers\
    \ should not originate them.  In\n   general, since the transport layer is able\
    \ to determine an\n   appropriate (and conservative) response to congestion based\
    \ on packet\n   loss or explicit congestion notification, ICMP Source Quench\n\
    \   indications are not needed, and the sending of additional Source\n   Quench\
    \ packets during periods of congestion may be detrimental.\n   \"ICMP attacks\
    \ against TCP\" [Gont] argues that accepting ICMP messages\n   based on a correct\
    \ four-tuple without additional security checks is\n   ill-advised.  For example,\
    \ an attacker forging an ICMP hard error\n   message can cause one or more transport\
    \ connections to abort.  The\n   authors discuss a number of precautions, including\
    \ mechanisms for\n   validating ICMP messages and ignoring or delaying response\
    \ to hard\n   error messages under various conditions.  They also recommend that\n\
    \   hosts ignore ICMP Source Quench messages.\n   The transport layer may also\
    \ provide information to the link layer.\n   For example, the transport layer\
    \ may wish to control the maximum\n   number of times that a link layer frame\
    \ may be retransmitted, so that\n   the link layer does not continue to retransmit\
    \ after a transport\n   layer timeout.  In IEEE 802.11, this can be achieved by\
    \ adjusting the\n   Management Information Base (MIB) [IEEE-802.11] variables\n\
    \   dot11ShortRetryLimit (default: 7) and dot11LongRetryLimit (default:\n   4),\
    \ which control the maximum number of retries for frames shorter\n   and longer\
    \ in length than dot11RTSThreshold, respectively.  However,\n   since these variables\
    \ control link behavior as a whole they cannot be\n   used to separately adjust\
    \ behavior on a per-transport connection\n   basis.  In situations where the link\
    \ layer retransmission timeout is\n   of the same order as the path round-trip\
    \ timeout, link layer control\n   may not be possible at all.\n"

    \   such as connection teardown.\n   Since applications can typically obtain the\

- title: 2.1.  Model Validation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Model Validation\n   Proposals should avoid the use of link models in circumstances\
    \ where\n   they do not apply.\n   In \"The mistaken axioms of wireless-network\
    \ research\" [Kotz], the\n   authors conclude that mistaken assumptions relating\
    \ to link behavior\n   may lead to the design of network protocols that may not\
    \ work in\n   practice.  For example, the authors note that the three-dimensional\n\
    \   nature of wireless propagation can result in large signal strength\n   changes\
    \ over short distances.  This can result in rapid changes in\n   link indications\
    \ such as rate, frame loss, and signal strength.\n   In \"Modeling Wireless Links\
    \ for Transport Protocols\" [GurtovFloyd],\n   the authors provide examples of\
    \ modeling mistakes and examples of how\n   to improve modeling of link characteristics.\
    \  To accompany the paper,\n   the authors provide simulation scenarios in ns-2.\n\
    \   In order to avoid the pitfalls described in [Kotz] [GurtovFloyd],\n   documents\
    \ that describe capabilities that are dependent on link\n   indications should\
    \ explicitly articulate the assumptions of the link\n   model and describe the\
    \ circumstances in which they apply.\n   Generic \"trigger\" models may include\
    \ implicit assumptions that may\n   prove invalid in outdoor or mesh wireless\
    \ LAN deployments.  For\n   example, two-state Markov models assume that the link\
    \ is either in a\n   state experiencing low frame loss (\"up\") or in a state\
    \ where few\n   frames are successfully delivered (\"down\").  In these models,\n\
    \   symmetry is also typically assumed, so that the link is either \"up\"\n  \
    \ in both directions or \"down\" in both directions.  In situations where\n  \
    \ intermediate loss rates are experienced, these assumptions may be\n   invalid.\n\
    \   As noted in \"Hybrid Rate Control for IEEE 802.11\" [Haratcherev],\n   signal\
    \ strength data is noisy and sometimes inconsistent, so that it\n   needs to be\
    \ filtered in order to avoid erratic results.  Given this,\n   link indications\
    \ based on raw signal strength data may be unreliable.\n   In order to avoid problems,\
    \ it is best to combine signal strength\n   data with other techniques.  For example,\
    \ in developing a \"Going\n   Down\" indication for use with [IEEE-802.21] it\
    \ would be advisable to\n   validate filtered signal strength measurements with\
    \ other indications\n   of link loss such as lack of Beacon reception.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Clear Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Clear Definitions\n   Link indications should be clearly defined, so that\
    \ it is understood\n   when they are generated on different link layers.  For\
    \ example,\n   considerable work has been required in order to come up with the\n\
    \   definitions of \"Link Up\" and \"Link Down\", and to define when these\n \
    \  indications are sent on various link layers.\n   Link indication definitions\
    \ should heed the following advice:\n   (1)  Do not assume symmetric link performance\
    \ or frame loss that is\n        either low (\"up\") or high (\"down\").\n   \
    \     In wired networks, links in the \"up\" state typically experience\n    \
    \    low frame loss in both directions and are ready to send and\n        receive\
    \ data frames; links in the \"down\" state are unsuitable\n        for sending\
    \ and receiving data frames in either direction.\n        Therefore, a link providing\
    \ a \"Link Up\" indication will\n        typically experience low frame loss in\
    \ both directions, and high\n        frame loss in any direction can only be experienced\
    \ after a link\n        provides a \"Link Down\" indication.  However, these assumptions\n\
    \        may not hold true for wireless LAN networks.  Asymmetry is\n        typically\
    \ less of a problem for cellular networks where\n        propagation occurs over\
    \ longer distances, multi-path effects may\n        be less severe, and the base\
    \ station can transmit at much higher\n        power than mobile stations while\
    \ utilizing a more sensitive\n        antenna.\n        Specifications utilizing\
    \ a \"Link Up\" indication should not\n        assume that receipt of this indication\
    \ means that the link is\n        experiencing symmetric link conditions or low\
    \ frame loss in\n        either direction.  In general, a \"Link Up\" event should\
    \ not be\n        sent due to transient changes in link conditions, but only due\n\
    \        to a change in link layer state.  It is best to assume that a\n     \
    \   \"Link Up\" event may not be sent in a timely way.  Large handoff\n      \
    \  latencies can result in a delay in the generation of a \"Link Up\"\n      \
    \  event as movement to an alternative point of attachment is\n        delayed.\n\
    \   (2)  Consider the sensitivity of link indications to transient link\n    \
    \    conditions.  Due to common effects such as multi-path\n        interference,\
    \ signal strength and signal to noise ratio (SNR)\n        may vary rapidly over\
    \ a short distance, causing erratic behavior\n        of link indications based\
    \ on unfiltered measurements.  As noted\n        in [Haratcherev], signal strength\
    \ may prove most useful when\n        utilized in combination with other measurements,\
    \ such as frame\n        loss.\n   (3)  Where possible, design link indications\
    \ with built-in damping.\n        By design, the \"Link Up\" and \"Link Down\"\
    \ events relate to\n        changes in the state of the link layer that make it\
    \ able and\n        unable to communicate IP packets.  These changes are generated\n\
    \        either by the link layer state machine based on link layer\n        exchanges\
    \ (e.g., completion of the IEEE 802.11i four-way\n        handshake for \"Link\
    \ Up\", or receipt of a PPP LCP-Terminate for\n        \"Link Down\") or by protracted\
    \ frame loss, so that the link layer\n        concludes that the link is no longer\
    \ usable.  As a result, these\n        link indications are typically less sensitive\
    \ to changes in\n        transient link conditions.\n   (4)  Do not assume that\
    \ a \"Link Down\" event will be sent at all, or\n        that, if sent, it will\
    \ be received in a timely way.  A good link\n        layer implementation will\
    \ both rapidly detect connectivity\n        failure (such as by tracking missing\
    \ Beacons) while sending a\n        \"Link Down\" event only when it concludes\
    \ the link is unusable,\n        not due to transient frame loss.\n   However,\
    \ existing wireless LAN implementations often do not do a good\n   job of detecting\
    \ link failure.  During a lengthy detection phase, a\n   \"Link Down\" event is\
    \ not sent by the link layer, yet IP packets\n   cannot be transmitted or received\
    \ on the link.  Initiation of a scan\n   may be delayed so that the station cannot\
    \ find another point of\n   attachment.  This can result in inappropriate backoff\
    \ of\n   retransmission timers within the transport layer, among other\n   problems.\
    \  This is not as much of a problem for cellular networks\n   that utilize transmit\
    \ power adjustment.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Implementation Variation\n   Variations in link layer implementations\
    \ may have a substantial\n   impact on the behavior of link indications.  These\
    \ variations need to\n   be taken into account in evaluating the performance of\
    \ proposals.\n   For example, radio propagation and implementation differences\
    \ can\n   impact the reliability of link indications.\n   In \"Link-level Measurements\
    \ from an 802.11b Mesh Network\" [Aguayo],\n   the authors analyze the cause of\
    \ frame loss in a 38-node urban\n   multi-hop IEEE 802.11 ad-hoc network.  In\
    \ most cases, links that are\n   very bad in one direction tend to be bad in both\
    \ directions, and\n   links that are very good in one direction tend to be good\
    \ in both\n   directions.  However, 30 percent of links exhibited loss rates\n\
    \   differing substantially in each direction.\n   As described in [Aguayo], wireless\
    \ LAN links often exhibit loss rates\n   intermediate between \"up\" (low loss)\
    \ and \"down\" (high loss) states,\n   as well as substantial asymmetry.  As a\
    \ result, receipt of a \"Link\n   Up\" indication may not necessarily indicate\
    \ bidirectional\n   reachability, since it could have been generated after exchange\
    \ of\n   small frames at low rates, which might not imply bidirectional\n   connectivity\
    \ for large frames exchanged at higher rates.\n   Where multi-path interference\
    \ or hidden nodes are encountered, signal\n   strength may vary widely over a\
    \ short distance.  Several techniques\n   may be used to reduce potential disruptions.\
    \  Multiple transmitting\n   and receiving antennas may be used to reduce multi-path\
    \ effects;\n   transmission rate adaptation can be used to find a more satisfactory\n\
    \   transmission rate; transmit power adjustment can be used to improve\n   signal\
    \ quality and reduce interference; Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send\n   (RTS/CTS)\
    \ signaling can be used to reduce hidden node problems.\n   These techniques may\
    \ not be completely effective, so that high frame\n   loss may be encountered,\
    \ causing the link to cycle between \"up\" and\n   \"down\" states.\n   To improve\
    \ robustness against spurious link indications, it is\n   recommended that upper\
    \ layers treat the indication as a \"hint\"\n   (advisory in nature), rather than\
    \ a \"trigger\" dictating a particular\n   action.  Upper layers may then attempt\
    \ to validate the hint.\n   In [RFC4436], \"Link Up\" indications are rate limited,\
    \ and IP\n   configuration is confirmed using bidirectional reachability tests\n\
    \   carried out coincident with a request for configuration via DHCP.  As\n  \
    \ a result, bidirectional reachability is confirmed prior to activation\n   of\
    \ an IP configuration.  However, where a link exhibits an\n   intermediate loss\
    \ rate, demonstration of bidirectional reachability\n   may not necessarily indicate\
    \ that the link is suitable for carrying\n   IP data packets.\n   Another example\
    \ of validation occurs in IPv4 Link-Local address\n   configuration [RFC3927].\
    \  Prior to configuration of an IPv4 Link-\n   Local address, it is necessary\

    \ link\n   enablement can result in instability, particularly in multi-homed\n\
    \   hosts.\n   Once a link is in the \"up\" state, its effectiveness in transmission\n\
    \   of data packets can be used to determine an appropriate routing\n   metric.\
    \  In situations where the transmission time represents a large\n   portion of\
    \ the total transit time, minimizing total transmission time\n   is equivalent\
    \ to maximizing effective throughput.  \"A High-Throughput\n   Path Metric for\
    \ Multi-Hop Wireless Routing\" [ETX] describes a\n   proposed routing metric based\
    \ on the Expected Transmission Count\n   (ETX).  The authors demonstrate that\
    \ ETX, based on link layer frame\n   loss rates (prior to retransmission), enables\
    \ the selection of routes\n   maximizing effective throughput.  Where the transmission\
    \ rate is\n   constant, the expected transmission time is proportional to ETX,\
    \ so\n   that minimizing ETX also minimizes expected transmission time.\n   However,\
    \ where the transmission rate may vary, ETX may not represent\n   a good estimate\
    \ of the estimated transmission time.  In \"Routing in\n   multi-radio, multi-hop\
    \ wireless mesh networks\" [ETX-Rate], the\n   authors define a new metric called\
    \ Expected Transmission Time (ETT).\n   This is described as a \"bandwidth adjusted\
    \ ETX\" since ETT = ETX * S/B\n   where S is the size of the probe packet and\
    \ B is the bandwidth of the\n   link as measured by a packet pair [Morgan].  However,\
    \ ETT assumes\n   that the loss fraction of small probe frames sent at 1 Mbps\
    \ data rate\n   is indicative of the loss fraction of larger data frames at higher\n\
    \   rates, which tends to underestimate the ETT at higher rates, where\n   frame\
    \ loss typically increases.  In \"A Radio Aware Routing Protocol\n   for Wireless\
    \ Mesh Networks\" [ETX-Radio], the authors refine the ETT\n   metric further by\
    \ estimating the loss fraction as a function of\n   transmission rate.\n   However,\
    \ prior to sending data packets over the link, the appropriate\n   routing metric\
    \ may not easily be predicted.  As noted in [Shortest],\n   a link that can successfully\
    \ transmit the short frames utilized for\n   control, management, or routing may\
    \ not necessarily be able to\n   reliably transport larger data packets.\n   Therefore,\
    \ it may be necessary to utilize alternative metrics (such\n   as signal strength\
    \ or Access Point load) in order to assist in\n   attachment/handoff decisions.\
    \  However, unless the new interface is\n   the preferred route for one or more\
    \ destination prefixes, a Weak End\n   System implementation will not use the\
    \ new interface for outgoing\n   traffic.  Where \"idle timeout\" functionality\
    \ is implemented, the\n   unused interface will be brought down, only to be brought\
    \ up again by\n   the link enablement algorithm.\n   Within the link layer, metrics\
    \ such as signal strength and frame loss\n   may be used to determine the transmission\
    \ rate, as well as to\n   determine when to select an alternative point of attachment.\
    \  In\n   order to enable stations to roam prior to encountering packet loss,\n\
    \   studies such as \"An experimental study of IEEE 802.11b handover\n   performance\
    \ and its effect on voice traffic\" [Vatn] have suggested\n   using signal strength\
    \ as a mechanism to more rapidly detect loss of\n   connectivity, rather than\
    \ frame loss, as suggested in \"Techniques to\n   Reduce IEEE 802.11b MAC Layer\
    \ Handover Time\" [Velayos].\n   [Aguayo] notes that signal strength and distance\
    \ are not good\n   predictors of frame loss or throughput, due to the potential\
    \ effects\n   of multi-path interference.  As a result, a link brought up due\
    \ to\n   good signal strength may subsequently exhibit significant frame loss\n\
    \   and a low throughput.  Similarly, an Access Point (AP) demonstrating\n   low\
    \ utilization may not necessarily be the best choice, since\n   utilization may\
    \ be low due to hardware or software problems.  \"OSPF\n   Optimized Multipath\

    \ involve combining exchanges within the link layer.\n   For example, in [EAPIKEv2],\

- title: 2.9.  Transport of Link Indications
  contents:
  - "2.9.  Transport of Link Indications\n   Proposals for the transport of link indications\
    \ need to carefully\n   consider the layering, security, and transport implications.\n\
    \   As noted earlier, the transport layer may take the state of the local\n  \
    \ routing table into account in improving the quality of transport\n   parameter\
    \ estimates.  While absence of positive feedback that the\n   path is sending\
    \ data end-to-end must be heeded, where a route that\n   had previously been absent\
    \ is recovered, this may be used to trigger\n   congestion control probing.  While\
    \ this enables transported link\n   indications that affect the local routing\
    \ table to improve the\n   quality of transport parameter estimates, security\
    \ and\n   interoperability considerations relating to routing protocols still\n\
    \   apply.\n   Proposals involving transport of link indications need to demonstrate\n\
    \   the following:\n   (a)  Superiority to implicit signals.  In general, implicit\
    \ signals\n        are preferred to explicit transport of link indications since\n\
    \        they do not require participation in the routing mesh, add no\n     \
    \   new packets in times of network distress, operate more reliably\n        in\
    \ the presence of middle boxes such as NA(P)Ts, are more likely\n        to be\
    \ backward compatible, and are less likely to result in\n        security vulnerabilities.\
    \  As a result, explicit signaling\n        proposals must prove that implicit\
    \ signals are inadequate.\n   (b)  Mitigation of security vulnerabilities.  Transported\
    \ link\n        indications should not introduce new security vulnerabilities.\n\
    \        Link indications that result in modifications to the local\n        routing\
    \ table represent a routing protocol, so that the\n        vulnerabilities associated\
    \ with unsecured routing protocols\n        apply, including spoofing by off-link\
    \ attackers.  While\n        mechanisms such as \"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\"\
    \ [RFC3971]\n        may enable authentication and integrity protection of router-\n\
    \        originated messages, protecting against forgery of transported\n    \
    \    link indications, they are not yet widely deployed.\n   (c)  Validation of\
    \ transported indications.  Even if a transported\n        link indication can\
    \ be integrity protected and authenticated, if\n        the indication is sent\
    \ by a host off the local link, it may not\n        be clear that the sender is\
    \ on the actual path in use, or which\n        transport connection(s) the indication\
    \ relates to.  Proposals\n        need to describe how the receiving host can\
    \ validate the\n        transported link indication.\n   (d)  Mapping of Identifiers.\
    \  When link indications are transported,\n        it is generally for the purposes\
    \ of providing information about\n        Internet, transport, or application\
    \ layer operations at a remote\n        element.  However, application layer sessions\
    \ or transport\n        connections may not be visible to the remote element due\
    \ to\n        factors such as load sharing between links, or use of IPsec,\n \
    \       tunneling protocols, or nested headers.  As a result, proposals\n    \
    \    need to demonstrate how the link indication can be mapped to the\n      \
    \  relevant higher-layer state.  For example, on receipt of a link\n        indication,\
    \ the transport layer will need to identify the set of\n        transport sessions\
    \ (source address, destination address, source\n        port, destination port,\
    \ transport) that are affected.  If a\n        presence server is receiving remote\
    \ indications of \"Link\n        Up\"/\"Link Down\" status for a particular Media\
    \ Access Control\n        (MAC) address, the presence server will need to associate\

    \ indications such as routing\n   table and path changes.  More work is also needed\
    \ in utilization of\n   link layer indications in transport parameter estimation,\
    \ including\n   rate changes, \"Link Up\"/\"Link Down\" indications, link layer\n\
    \   retransmissions, and frame loss of various types (due to contention\n   or\
    \ channel conditions).\n   More work is also needed to determine how link layers\
    \ may utilize\n   information from the transport layer.  For example, it is undesirable\n\
    \   for a link layer to retransmit so aggressively that the link layer\n   round-trip\
    \ time approaches that of the end-to-end transport\n   connection.  Instead, it\
    \ may make sense to do downward rate\n   adjustment so as to decrease frame loss\
    \ and improve latency.  Also,\n   in some cases, the transport layer may not require\
    \ heroic efforts to\n   avoid frame loss; timely delivery may be preferred instead.\n"

    \      Indication validation\n      Denial of service\n"
- title: 4.1.  Spoofing
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Spoofing\n   Where link layer control frames are unprotected, they may\
    \ be spoofed\n   by an attacker.  For example, PPP does not protect LCP frames\
    \ such as\n   LCP-Terminate, and [IEEE-802.11] does not protect management frames\n\
    \   such as Associate/Reassociate, Disassociate, or Deauthenticate.\n   Spoofing\
    \ of link layer control traffic may enable attackers to\n   exploit weaknesses\
    \ in link indication proposals.  For example,\n   proposals that do not implement\
    \ congestion avoidance can enable\n   attackers to mount denial-of-service attacks.\n\
    \   However, even where the link layer incorporates security, attacks may\n  \
    \ still be possible if the security model is not consistent.  For\n   example,\
    \ wireless LANs implementing [IEEE-802.11i] do not enable\n   stations to send\
    \ or receive IP packets on the link until completion\n   of an authenticated key\
    \ exchange protocol known as the \"4-way\n   handshake\".  As a result, a link\
    \ implementing [IEEE-802.11i] cannot\n   be considered usable at the Internet\
    \ layer (\"Link Up\") until\n   completion of the authenticated key exchange.\n\
    \   However, while [IEEE-802.11i] requires sending of authenticated\n   frames\
    \ in order to obtain a \"Link Up\" indication, it does not support\n   management\
    \ frame authentication.  This weakness can be exploited by\n   attackers to enable\
    \ denial-of-service attacks on stations attached to\n   distant Access Points\
    \ (APs).\n   In [IEEE-802.11F], \"Link Up\" is considered to occur when an AP\
    \ sends\n   a Reassociation Response.  At that point, the AP sends a spoofed\n\
    \   frame with the station's source address to a multicast address,\n   thereby\
    \ causing switches within the Distribution System (DS) to learn\n   the station's\
    \ MAC address.  While this enables forwarding of frames\n   to the station at\
    \ the new point of attachment, it also permits an\n   attacker to disassociate\
    \ a station located anywhere within the ESS,\n   by sending an unauthenticated\
    \ Reassociation Request frame.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Indication Validation
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Indication Validation\n   \"Fault Isolation and Recovery\" [RFC816], Section\
    \ 3, describes how\n   hosts interact with routers for the purpose of fault recovery:\n\
    \   Since the gateways always attempt to have a consistent and correct\n   model\
    \ of the internetwork topology, the host strategy for fault\n   recovery is very\
    \ simple.  Whenever the host feels that something is\n   wrong, it asks the gateway\
    \ for advice, and, assuming the advice is\n   forthcoming, it believes the advice\
    \ completely.  The advice will be\n   wrong only during the transient period of\
    \ negotiation, which\n   immediately follows an outage, but will otherwise be\
    \ reliably\n   correct.\n   In fact, it is never necessary for a host to explicitly\
    \ ask a gateway\n   for advice, because the gateway will provide it as appropriate.\
    \  When\n   a host sends a datagram to some distant net, the host should be\n\
    \   prepared to receive back either of two advisory messages which the\n   gateway\
    \ may send.  The ICMP \"redirect\" message indicates that the\n   gateway to which\
    \ the host sent the datagram is no longer the best\n   gateway to reach the net\
    \ in question.  The gateway will have\n   forwarded the datagram, but the host\
    \ should revise its routing table\n   to have a different immediate address for\
    \ this net.  The ICMP\n   \"destination unreachable\" message indicates that as\
    \ a result of an\n   outage, it is currently impossible to reach the addressed\
    \ net or host\n   in any manner.  On receipt of this message, a host can either\
    \ abandon\n   the connection immediately without any further retransmission, or\n\
    \   resend slowly to see if the fault is corrected in reasonable time.\n   Given\
    \ today's security environment, it is inadvisable for hosts to\n   act on indications\
    \ provided by routers without careful consideration.\n   As noted in \"ICMP attacks\
    \ against TCP\" [Gont], existing ICMP error\n   messages may be exploited by attackers\
    \ in order to abort connections\n   in progress, prevent setup of new connections,\
    \ or reduce throughput\n   of ongoing connections.  Similar attacks may also be\
    \ launched against\n   the Internet layer via forging of ICMP redirects.\n   Proposals\
    \ for transported link indications need to demonstrate that\n   they will not\
    \ add a new set of similar vulnerabilities.  Since\n   transported link indications\
    \ are typically unauthenticated, hosts\n   receiving them may not be able to determine\
    \ whether they are\n   authentic, or even plausible.\n   Where link indication\
    \ proposals may respond to unauthenticated link\n   layer frames, they should\
    \ utilize upper-layer security mechanisms,\n   where possible.  For example, even\
    \ though a host might utilize an\n   unauthenticated link layer control frame\
    \ to conclude that a link has\n   become operational, it can use SEND [RFC3971]\
    \ or authenticated DHCP\n   [RFC3118] in order to obtain secure Internet layer\
    \ configuration.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Denial of Service
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Denial of Service\n   Link indication proposals need to be particularly\
    \ careful to avoid\n   enabling denial-of-service attacks that can be mounted\
    \ at a distance.\n   While wireless links are naturally vulnerable to interference,\
    \ such\n   attacks can only be perpetrated by an attacker capable of\n   establishing\
    \ radio contact with the target network.  However, attacks\n   that can be mounted\
    \ from a distance, either by an attacker on another\n   point of attachment within\
    \ the same network or by an off-link\n   attacker, expand the level of vulnerability.\n\
    \   The transport of link indications can increase risk by enabling\n   vulnerabilities\
    \ exploitable only by attackers on the local link to be\n   executed across the\
    \ Internet.  Similarly, by integrating link\n   indications with upper layers,\
    \ proposals may enable a spoofed link\n   layer frame to consume more resources\
    \ on the host than might\n   otherwise be the case.  As a result, while it is\
    \ important for upper\n   layers to validate link indications, they should not\
    \ expend excessive\n   resources in doing so.\n   Congestion control is not only\
    \ a transport issue, it is also a\n   security issue.  In order to not provide\
    \ leverage to an attacker, a\n   single forged link layer frame should not elicit\
    \ a magnified response\n   from one or more hosts, by generating either multiple\
    \ responses or a\n   single larger response.  For example, proposals should not\
    \ enable\n   multiple hosts to respond to a frame with a multicast destination\n\
    \   address.\n"

  - "A.1.  Link Layer\n   The characteristics of wireless links have been found to\
    \ vary\n   considerably depending on the environment.\n   In \"Performance of\
    \ Multihop Wireless Networks: Shortest Path is Not\n   Enough\" [Shortest], the\
    \ authors studied the performance of both an\n   indoor and outdoor mesh network.\
    \  By measuring inter-node throughput,\n   the best path between nodes was computed.\
    \  The throughput of the best\n   path was compared with the throughput of the\
    \ shortest path computed\n   based on a hop-count metric.  In almost all cases,\
    \ the shortest path\n   route offered considerably lower throughput than the best\
    \ path.\n   In examining link behavior, the authors found that rather than\n \
    \  exhibiting a bi-modal distribution between \"up\" (low loss rate) and\n   \"\
    down\" (high loss rate), many links exhibited intermediate loss\n   rates.  Asymmetry\
    \ was also common, with 30 percent of links\n   demonstrating substantial differences\
    \ in the loss rates in each\n   direction.  As a result, on wireless networks\
    \ the measured throughput\n   can differ substantially from the negotiated rate\
    \ due to\n   retransmissions, and successful delivery of routing packets is not\n\
    \   necessarily an indication that the link is useful for delivery of\n   data.\n\
    \   In \"Measurement and Analysis of the Error Characteristics of an\n   In-Building\
    \ Wireless Network\" [Eckhardt], the authors characterize\n   the performance\
    \ of an AT&T Wavelan 2 Mbps in-building WLAN operating\n   in Infrastructure mode\
    \ on the Carnegie Mellon campus.  In this study,\n   very low frame loss was experienced.\
    \  As a result, links could be\n   assumed to operate either very well or not\
    \ at all.\n   In \"Link-level Measurements from an 802.11b Mesh Network\" [Aguayo],\n\
    \   the authors analyze the causes of frame loss in a 38-node urban\n   multi-hop\
    \ 802.11 ad-hoc network.  In most cases, links that are very\n   bad in one direction\
    \ tend to be bad in both directions, and links\n   that are very good in one direction\
    \ tend to be good in both\n   directions.  However, 30 percent of links exhibited\
    \ loss rates\n   differing substantially in each direction.\n   Signal to noise\
    \ ratio (SNR) and distance showed little value in\n   predicting loss rates, and\
    \ rather than exhibiting a step-function\n   transition between \"up\" (low loss)\
    \ or \"down\" (high loss) states,\n   inter-node loss rates varied widely, demonstrating\
    \ a nearly uniform\n   distribution over the range at the lower rates.  The authors\n\
    \   attribute the observed effects to multi-path fading, rather than\n   attenuation\
    \ or interference.\n   The findings of [Eckhardt] and [Aguayo] demonstrate the\
    \ diversity of\n   link conditions observed in practice.  While for indoor\n \
    \  infrastructure networks site surveys and careful measurement can\n   assist\
    \ in promoting ideal behavior, in ad-hoc/mesh networks node\n   mobility and external\
    \ factors such as weather may not be easily\n   controlled.\n   Considerable diversity\
    \ in behavior is also observed due to\n   implementation effects.  \"Techniques\
    \ to reduce IEEE 802.11b MAC layer\n   handover time\" [Velayos] measured handover\
    \ times for a stationary STA\n   after the AP was turned off.  This study divided\
    \ handover times into\n   detection (determination of disconnection from the existing\
    \ point of\n   attachment), search (discovery of alternative attachment points),\
    \ and\n   execution (connection to an alternative point of attachment) phases.\n\
    \   These measurements indicated that the duration of the detection phase\n  \
    \ (the largest component of handoff delay) is determined by the number\n   of\
    \ non-acknowledged frames triggering the search phase and delays due\n   to precursors\
    \ such as RTS/CTS and rate adaptation.\n   Detection behavior varied widely between\
    \ implementations.  For\n   example, network interface cards (NICs) designed for\
    \ desktops\n   attempted more retransmissions prior to triggering search as compared\n\
    \   with laptop designs, since they assumed that the AP was always in\n   range,\
    \ regardless of whether the Beacon was received.\n   The study recommends that\
    \ the duration of the detection phase be\n   reduced by initiating the search\
    \ phase as soon as collisions can be\n   excluded as the cause of non-acknowledged\
    \ transmissions; the authors\n   recommend three consecutive transmission failures\
    \ as the cutoff.\n   This approach is both quicker and more immune to multi-path\n\
    \   interference than monitoring of the SNR.  Where the STA is not\n   sending\
    \ or receiving frames, it is recommended that Beacon reception\n   be tracked\
    \ in order to detect disconnection, and that Beacon spacing\n   be reduced to\
    \ 60 ms in order to reduce detection times.  In order to\n   compensate for more\

  - "A.1.1.  Link Indications\n   Within a link layer, the definition of \"Link Up\"\
    \ and \"Link Down\" may\n   vary according to the deployment scenario.  For example,\
    \ within PPP\n   [RFC1661], either peer may send an LCP-Terminate frame in order\
    \ to\n   terminate the PPP link layer, and a link may only be assumed to be\n\
    \   usable for sending network protocol packets once Network Control\n   Protocol\
    \ (NCP) negotiation has completed for that protocol.\n   Unlike PPP, IEEE 802\
    \ does not include facilities for network layer\n   configuration, and the definition\
    \ of \"Link Up\" and \"Link Down\" varies\n   by implementation.  Empirical evidence\
    \ suggests that the definition\n   of \"Link Up\" and \"Link Down\" may depend\
    \ on whether the station is\n   mobile or stationary, whether infrastructure or\
    \ ad-hoc mode is in\n   use, and whether security and Inter-Access Point Protocol\
    \ (IAPP) is\n   implemented.\n   Where a STA encounters a series of consecutive\
    \ non-acknowledged\n   frames while having missed one or more Beacons, the most\
    \ likely cause\n   is that the station has moved out of range of the AP.  As a\
    \ result,\n   [Velayos] recommends that the station begin the search phase after\n\
    \   collisions can be ruled out; since this approach does not take rate\n   adaptation\
    \ into account, it may be somewhat aggressive.  Only when no\n   alternative workable\
    \ rate or point of attachment is found is a \"Link\n   Down\" indication returned.\n\
    \   In a stationary point-to-point installation, the most likely cause of\n  \
    \ an outage is that the link has become impaired, and alternative\n   points of\
    \ attachment may not be available.  As a result,\n   implementations configured\
    \ to operate in this mode tend to be more\n   persistent.  For example, within\
    \ 802.11 the short interframe space\n   (SIFS) interval may be increased and MIB\
    \ variables relating to\n   timeouts (such as dot11AuthenticationResponseTimeout,\n\
    \   dot11AssociationResponseTimeout, dot11ShortRetryLimit, and\n   dot11LongRetryLimit)\
    \ may be set to larger values.  In addition, a\n   \"Link Down\" indication may\
    \ be returned later.\n   In IEEE 802.11 ad-hoc mode with no security, reception\
    \ of data frames\n   is enabled in State 1 (\"Unauthenticated\" and \"Unassociated\"\
    ).  As a\n   result, reception of data frames is enabled at any time, and no\n\
    \   explicit \"Link Up\" indication exists.\n   In Infrastructure mode, IEEE 802.11-2003\
    \ enables reception of data\n   frames only in State 3 (\"Authenticated\" and\
    \ \"Associated\").  As a\n   result, a transition to State 3 (e.g., completion\
    \ of a successful\n   Association or Reassociation exchange) enables sending and\
    \ receiving\n   of network protocol packets and a transition from State 3 to State\
    \ 2\n   (reception of a \"Disassociate\" frame) or State 1 (reception of a\n \
    \  \"Deauthenticate\" frame) disables sending and receiving of network\n   protocol\
    \ packets.  As a result, IEEE 802.11 stations typically signal\n   \"Link Up\"\
    \ on receipt of a successful Association/Reassociation\n   Response.\n   As described\
    \ within [IEEE-802.11F], after sending a Reassociation\n   Response, an Access\
    \ Point will send a frame with the station's source\n   address to a multicast\
    \ destination.  This causes switches within the\n   Distribution System (DS) to\
    \ update their learning tables, readying\n   the DS to forward frames to the station\
    \ at its new point of\n   attachment.  Were the AP to not send this \"spoofed\"\
    \ frame, the\n   station's location would not be updated within the distribution\n\
    \   system until it sends its first frame at the new location.  Thus, the\n  \
    \ purpose of spoofing is to equalize uplink and downlink handover\n   times. \
    \ This enables an attacker to deny service to authenticated and\n   associated\
    \ stations by spoofing a Reassociation Request using the\n   victim's MAC address,\
    \ from anywhere within the ESS.  Without\n   spoofing, such an attack would only\
    \ be able to disassociate stations\n   on the AP to which the Reassociation Request\
    \ was sent.\n   The signaling of \"Link Down\" is considerably more complex. \
    \ Even\n   though a transition to State 2 or State 1 results in the station\n\
    \   being unable to send or receive IP packets, this does not necessarily\n  \
    \ imply that such a transition should be considered a \"Link Down\"\n   indication.\
    \  In an infrastructure network, a station may have a\n   choice of multiple Access\
    \ Points offering connection to the same\n   network.  In such an environment,\
    \ a station that is unable to reach\n   State 3 with one Access Point may instead\
    \ choose to attach to another\n   Access Point.  Rather than registering a \"\
    Link Down\" indication with\n   each move, the station may instead register a\
    \ series of \"Link Up\"\n   indications.\n   In [IEEE-802.11i], forwarding of\
    \ frames from the station to the\n   distribution system is only feasible after\
    \ the completion of the\n   4-way handshake and group-key handshake, so that entering\
    \ State 3 is\n   no longer sufficient.  This has resulted in several observed\n\
    \   problems.  For example, where a \"Link Up\" indication is triggered on\n \
    \  the station by receipt of an Association/Reassociation Response, DHCP\n   [RFC2131]\
    \ or Router Solicitation/Router Advertisement (RS/RA) may be\n   triggered prior\
    \ to when the link is usable by the Internet layer,\n   resulting in configuration\
    \ delays or failures.  Similarly, transport\n   layer connections will encounter\
    \ packet loss, resulting in back-off\n   of retransmission timers.\n"

  - "A.1.2.  Smart Link Layer Proposals\n   In order to improve link layer performance,\
    \ several studies have\n   investigated \"smart link layer\" proposals.\n   \"\
    Advice to link designers on link Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ)\"\n   [RFC3366]\
    \ provides advice to the designers of digital communication\n   equipment and\
    \ link-layer protocols employing link-layer Automatic\n   Repeat reQuest (ARQ)\
    \ techniques for IP.  It discusses the use of ARQ,\n   timers, persistency in\
    \ retransmission, and the challenges that arise\n   from sharing links between\
    \ multiple flows and from different\n   transport requirements.\n   In \"Link-layer\
    \ Enhancements for TCP/IP over GSM\" [Ludwig], the\n   authors describe how the\
    \ Global System for Mobile Communications\n   (GSM)-reliable and unreliable link\
    \ layer modes can be simultaneously\n   utilized without higher layer control.\
    \  Where a reliable link layer\n   protocol is required (where reliable transports\
    \ such TCP and Stream\n   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC2960] are used),\
    \ the Radio\n   Link Protocol (RLP) can be engaged; with delay-sensitive applications\n\
    \   such as those based on UDP, the transparent mode (no RLP) can be\n   used.\
    \  The authors also describe how PPP negotiation can be optimized\n   over high-latency\
    \ GSM links using \"Quickstart-PPP\".\n   In \"Link Layer Based TCP Optimisation\
    \ for Disconnecting Networks\"\n   [Scott], the authors describe performance problems\
    \ that occur with\n   reliable transport protocols facing periodic network disconnections,\n\
    \   such as those due to signal fading or handoff.  The authors define a\n   disconnection\
    \ as a period of connectivity loss that exceeds a\n   retransmission timeout,\
    \ but is shorter than the connection lifetime.\n   One issue is that link-unaware\
    \ senders continue to back off during\n   periods of disconnection.  The authors\
    \ suggest that a link-aware\n   reliable transport implementation halt retransmission\
    \ after receiving\n   a \"Link Down\" indication.  Another issue is that on reconnection\
    \ the\n   lengthened retransmission times cause delays in utilizing the link.\n\
    \   To improve performance, a \"smart link layer\" is proposed, which\n   stores\
    \ the first packet that was not successfully transmitted on a\n   connection,\
    \ then retransmits it upon receipt of a \"Link Up\"\n   indication.  Since a disconnection\
    \ can result in hosts experiencing\n   different network conditions upon reconnection,\
    \ the authors do not\n   advocate bypassing slow start or attempting to raise\
    \ the congestion\n   window.  Where IPsec is used and connections cannot be differentiated\n\
    \   because transport headers are not visible, the first untransmitted\n   packet\
    \ for a given sender and destination IP address can be\n   retransmitted.  In\
    \ addition to looking at retransmission of a single\n   packet per connection,\
    \ the authors also examined other schemes such\n   as retransmission of multiple\
    \ packets and simulated duplicate\n   reception of single or multiple packets\
    \ (known as rereception).\n   In general, retransmission schemes were superior\
    \ to rereception\n   schemes, since rereception cannot stimulate fast retransmit\
    \ after a\n   timeout.  Retransmission of multiple packets did not appreciably\n\
    \   improve performance over retransmission of a single packet.  Since\n   the\
    \ focus of the research was on disconnection rather than just lossy\n   channels,\
    \ a two-state Markov model was used, with the \"up\" state\n   representing no\
    \ loss, and the \"down\" state representing 100 percent\n   loss.\n   In \"Multi\
    \ Service Link Layers: An Approach to Enhancing Internet\n   Performance over\
    \ Wireless Links\" [Xylomenos], the authors use ns-2 to\n   simulate the performance\
    \ of various link layer recovery schemes (raw\n   link without retransmission,\
    \ go back N, XOR-based FEC, selective\n   repeat, Karn's RLP, out-of-sequence\
    \ RLP, and Berkeley Snoop) in\n   stand-alone file transfer, Web browsing, and\
    \ continuous media\n   distribution.  While selective repeat and Karn's RLP provide\
    \ the\n   highest throughput for file transfer and Web browsing scenarios,\n \
    \  continuous media distribution requires a combination of low delay and\n   low\
    \ loss and the out-of-sequence RLP performed best in this scenario.\n   Since\
    \ the results indicate that no single link layer recovery scheme\n   is optimal\
    \ for all applications, the authors propose that the link\n   layer implement\
    \ multiple recovery schemes.  Simulations of the\n   multi-service architecture\
    \ showed that the combination of a low-error\n   rate recovery scheme for TCP\
    \ (such as Karn's RLP) and a low-delay\n   scheme for UDP traffic (such as out-of-sequence\
    \ RLP) provides for\n   good performance in all scenarios.  The authors then describe\
    \ how a\n   multi-service link layer can be integrated with Differentiated\n \
    \  Services.\n   In \"WaveLAN-II: A High-Performance Wireless LAN for the Unlicensed\n\
    \   Band\" [Kamerman], the authors propose an open-loop rate adaptation\n   algorithm\
    \ known as Automatic Rate Fallback (ARF).  In ARF, the sender\n   adjusts the\
    \ rate upwards after a fixed number of successful\n   transmissions, and adjusts\
    \ the rate downwards after one or two\n   consecutive failures.  If after an upwards\
    \ rate adjustment the\n   transmission fails, the rate is immediately readjusted\
    \ downwards.\n   In \"A Rate-Adaptive MAC Protocol for Multi-Hop Wireless Networks\"\
    \n   [RBAR], the authors propose a closed-loop rate adaptation approach\n   that\
    \ requires incompatible changes to the IEEE 802.11 MAC.  In order\n   to enable\
    \ the sender to better determine the transmission rate, the\n   receiver determines\
    \ the packet length and signal to noise ratio (SNR)\n   of a received RTS frame\
    \ and calculates the corresponding rate based\n   on a theoretical channel model,\
    \ rather than channel usage statistics.\n   The recommended rate is sent back\
    \ in the CTS frame.  This allows the\n   rate (and potentially the transmit power)\
    \ to be optimized on each\n   transmission, albeit at the cost of requiring RTS/CTS\
    \ for every frame\n   transmission.\n   In \"MiSer: An Optimal Low-Energy Transmission\
    \ Strategy for IEEE\n   802.11 a/h\" [Qiao], the authors propose a scheme for\
    \ optimizing\n   transmit power.  The proposal mandates the use of RTS/CTS in\
    \ order to\n   deal with hidden nodes, requiring that CTS and ACK frames be sent\
    \ at\n   full power.  The authors utilize a theoretical channel model rather\n\
    \   than one based on channel usage statistics.\n   In \"IEEE 802.11 Rate Adaptation:\
    \ A Practical Approach\" [Lacage], the\n   authors distinguish between low-latency\
    \ implementations, which enable\n   per-packet rate decisions, and high-latency\
    \ implementations, which do\n   not.  The former implementations typically include\
    \ dedicated CPUs in\n   their design, enabling them to meet real-time requirements.\
    \  The\n   latter implementations are typically based on highly integrated\n \
    \  designs in which the upper MAC is implemented on the host.  As a\n   result,\
    \ due to operating system latencies the information required to\n   make per-packet\
    \ rate decisions may not be available in time.\n   The authors propose an Adaptive\
    \ ARF (AARF) algorithm for use with\n   low-latency implementations.  This enables\
    \ rapid downward rate\n   negotiation on failure to receive an ACK, while increasing\
    \ the number\n   of successful transmissions required for upward rate negotiation.\n\
    \   The AARF algorithm is therefore highly stable in situations where\n   channel\
    \ properties are changing slowly, but slow to adapt upwards\n   when channel conditions\
    \ improve.  In order to test the algorithm, the\n   authors utilized ns-2 simulations\
    \ as well as implementing a version\n   of AARF adapted to a high-latency implementation,\
    \ the AR 5212\n   chipset.  The Multiband Atheros Driver for WiFi (MadWiFi) driver\n\
    \   enables a fixed schedule of rates and retries to be provided when a\n   frame\
    \ is queued for transmission.  The adapted algorithm, known as\n   the Adaptive\
    \ Multi Rate Retry (AMRR), requests only one transmission\n   at each of three\
    \ rates, the last of which is the minimum available\n   rate.  This enables adaptation\
    \ to short-term fluctuations in the\n   channel with minimal latency.  The AMRR\
    \ algorithm provides\n   performance considerably better than the existing MadWifi\
    \ driver.\n   In \"Link Adaptation Strategy for IEEE 802.11 WLAN via Received\
    \ Signal\n   Strength Measurement\" [Pavon], the authors propose an algorithm\
    \ by\n   which a STA adjusts the transmission rate based on a comparison of\n\
    \   the received signal strength (RSS) from the AP with dynamically\n   estimated\
    \ threshold values for each transmission rate.  Upon\n   reception of a frame,\
    \ the STA updates the average RSS, and on\n   transmission the STA selects a rate\
    \ and adjusts the RSS threshold\n   values based on whether or not the transmission\
    \ is successful.  In\n   order to validate the algorithm, the authors utilized\
    \ an OPNET\n   simulation without interference, and an ideal curve of bit error\
    \ rate\n   (BER) vs. signal to noise ratio (SNR) was assumed.  Not surprisingly,\n\
    \   the simulation results closely matched the maximum throughput\n   achievable\
    \ for a given signal to noise ratio, based on the ideal BER\n   vs. SNR curve.\n\
    \   In \"Hybrid Rate Control for IEEE 802.11\" [Haratcherev], the authors\n  \
    \ describe a hybrid technique utilizing Signal Strength Indication\n   (SSI) data\
    \ to constrain the potential rates selected by statistics-\n   based automatic\
    \ rate control.  Statistics-based rate control\n   techniques include:\n   Maximum\
    \ Throughput\n   This technique, which was chosen as the statistics-based technique\
    \ in\n   the hybrid scheme, sends a fraction of data at adjacent rates in\n  \
    \ order to estimate which rate provides the maximum throughput.  Since\n   accurate\
    \ estimation of throughput requires a minimum number of frames\n   to be sent\
    \ at each rate, and only a fraction of frames are utilized\n   for this purpose,\
    \ this technique adapts more slowly at lower rates;\n   with 802.11b rates, the\
    \ adaptation time scale is typically on the\n   order of a second.  Depending\
    \ on how many rates are tested, this\n   technique can enable adaptation beyond\
    \ adjacent rates.  However,\n   where maximum rate and low frame loss are already\
    \ being encountered,\n   this technique results in lower throughput.\n   Frame\
    \ Error Rate (FER) Control\n   This technique estimates the FER, attempting to\
    \ keep it between a\n   lower limit (if FER moves below, increase rate) and upper\
    \ limit (if\n   FER moves above, decrease rate).  Since this technique can utilize\n\
    \   all the transmitted data, it can respond faster than maximum\n   throughput\
    \ techniques.  However, there is a tradeoff of reaction time\n   versus FER estimation\
    \ accuracy; at lower rates either reaction times\n   slow or FER estimation accuracy\
    \ will suffer.  Since this technique\n   only measures the FER at the current\
    \ rate, it can only enable\n   adaptation to adjacent rates.\n   Retry-based\n\
    \   This technique modifies FER control techniques by enabling rapid\n   downward\
    \ rate adaptation after a number (5-10) of unsuccessful\n   retransmissions. \
    \ Since fewer packets are required, the sensitivity\n   of reaction time to rate\
    \ is reduced.  However, upward rate adaptation\n   proceeds more slowly since\
    \ it is based on a collection of FER data.\n   This technique is limited to adaptation\
    \ to adjacent rates, and it has\n   the disadvantage of potentially worsening\
    \ frame loss due to\n   contention.\n   While statistics-based techniques are\
    \ robust against short-lived link\n   quality changes, they do not respond quickly\
    \ to long-lived changes.\n   By constraining the rate selected by statistics-based\
    \ techniques\n   based on ACK SSI versus rate data (not theoretical curves), more\n\
    \   rapid link adaptation was enabled.  In order to ensure rapid\n   adaptation\
    \ during rapidly varying conditions, the rate constraints\n   are tightened when\
    \ the SSI values are changing rapidly, encouraging\n   rate transitions.  The\
    \ authors validated their algorithms by\n   implementing a driver for the Atheros\
    \ AR5000 chipset, and then\n   testing its response to insertion and removal from\
    \ a microwave oven\n   acting as a Faraday cage.  The hybrid algorithm dropped\
    \ many fewer\n   packets than the maximum throughput technique by itself.\n  \
    \ In order to estimate the SSI of data at the receiver, the ACK SSI was\n   used.\
    \  This approach does not require the receiver to provide the\n   sender with\
    \ the received power, so that it can be implemented without\n   changing the IEEE\
    \ 802.11 MAC.  Calibration of the rate versus ACK SSI\n   curves does not require\
    \ a symmetric channel, but it does require that\n   channel properties in both\
    \ directions vary in a proportional way and\n   that the ACK transmit power remains\
    \ constant.  The authors checked\n   the proportionality assumption and found\
    \ that the SSI of received\n   data correlated highly (74%) with the SSI of received\
    \ ACKs.  Low pass\n   filtering and monotonicity constraints were applied to remove\
    \ noise\n   in the rate versus SSI curves.  The resulting hybrid rate adaptation\n\
    \   algorithm demonstrated the ability to respond to rapid deterioration\n   (and\
    \ improvement) in channel properties, since it is not restricted\n   to moving\
    \ to adjacent rates.\n   In \"CARA: Collision-Aware Rate Adaptation for IEEE 802.11\
    \ WLANs\"\n   [CARA], the authors propose Collision-Aware Rate Adaptation (CARA).\n\
    \   This involves utilization of Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) along\n   with\
    \ adaptation of the Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS)\n   mechanism to differentiate\
    \ losses caused by frame collisions from\n   losses caused by channel conditions.\
    \  Rather than decreasing rate as\n   the result of frame loss due to collisions,\
    \ which leads to increased\n   contention, CARA selectively enables RTS/CTS (e.g.,\
    \ after a frame\n   loss), reducing the likelihood of frame loss due to hidden\
    \ stations.\n   CARA can also utilize CCA to determine whether a collision has\n\
    \   occurred after a transmission; however, since CCA may not detect a\n   significant\
    \ fraction of all collisions (particularly when\n   transmitting at low rate),\
    \ its use is optional.  As compared with\n   ARF, in simulations the authors show\
    \ large improvements in aggregate\n   throughput due to addition of adaptive RTS/CTS,\
    \ and additional modest\n   improvements with the additional help of CCA.\n  \
    \ In \"Robust Rate Adaptation for 802.11 Wireless Networks\" [Robust],\n   the\
    \ authors implemented the ARF, AARF, and SampleRate [SampleRate]\n   algorithms\
    \ on a programmable Access Point platform, and\n   experimentally examined the\
    \ performance of these algorithms as well\n   as the ONOE [ONOE] algorithm implemented\
    \ in MadWiFi.  Based on their\n   experiments, the authors critically examine\
    \ the assumptions\n   underlying existing rate negotiation algorithms:\n   Decrease\
    \ transmission rate upon severe frame loss\n        Where severe frame loss is\
    \ due to channel conditions, rate\n        reduction can improve throughput. \
    \ However, where frame loss is\n        due to contention (such as from hidden\
    \ stations), reducing\n        transmission rate increases congestion, lowering\
    \ throughput and\n        potentially leading to congestive collapse.  Instead,\
    \ the\n        authors propose adaptive enabling of RTS/CTS so as to reduce\n\
    \        contention due to hidden stations.  Once RTS/CTS is enabled,\n      \
    \  remaining losses are more likely to be due to channel\n        conditions,\
    \ providing more reliable guidance on increasing or\n        decreasing transmission\
    \ rate.\n   Use probe frames to assess possible new rates\n        Probe frames\
    \ reliably estimate frame loss at a given rate unless\n        the sample size\
    \ is sufficient and the probe frames are of\n        comparable length to data\
    \ frames.  The authors argue that rate\n        adaptation schemes such as SampleRate\
    \ are too sensitive to loss\n        of probe packets.  In order to satisfy sample\
    \ size constraints,\n        a significant number of probe frames are required.\
    \  This can\n        increase frame loss if the probed rate is too high, and can\n\
    \        lower throughput if the probed rate is too low.  Instead, the\n     \
    \   authors propose assessment of the channel condition by tracking\n        the\
    \ frame loss ratio within a window of 5 to 40 frames.\n   Use consecutive transmission\
    \ successes/losses to increase/decrease\n        rate\n        The authors argue\
    \ that consecutive successes or losses are not a\n        reliable basis for rate\
    \ increases or decreases; greater sample\n        size is needed.\n   Use PHY\
    \ metrics like SNR to infer new transmission rate\n        The authors argue that\
    \ received signal to noise ratio (SNR)\n        routinely varies 5 dB per packet\
    \ and that variations of 10-14 dB\n        are common.  As a result, rate decisions\
    \ based on SNR or signal\n        strength can cause transmission rate to vary\
    \ rapidly.  The\n        authors question the value of such rapid variation, since\n\
    \        studies such as [Aguayo] show little correlation between SNR and\n  \
    \      frame loss probability.  As a result, the authors argue that\n        neither\
    \ received signal strength indication (RSSI) nor\n        background energy level\
    \ can be used to distinguish losses due to\n        contention from those due\
    \ to channel conditions.  While multi-\n        path interference can simultaneously\
    \ result in high signal\n        strength and frame loss, the relationship between\
    \ low signal\n        strength and high frame loss is stronger.  Therefore,\n\
    \        transmission rate decreases due to low received signal strength\n   \
    \     probably do reflect sudden worsening in channel conditions,\n        although\
    \ sudden increases may not necessarily indicate that\n        channel conditions\
    \ have improved.\n   Long-term smoothened operation produces best average performance\n\
    \        The authors present evidence that frame losses more than 150 ms\n   \
    \     apart are uncorrelated.  Therefore, collection of statistical\n        data\
    \ over intervals of 1 second or greater reduces\n        responsiveness, but does\
    \ not improve the quality of transmission\n        rate decisions.  Rather, the\
    \ authors argue that a sampling\n        period of 100 ms provides the best average\
    \ performance.  Such\n        small sampling periods also argue against use of\
    \ probes, since\n        probe packets can only represent a fraction of all data\
    \ frames\n        and probes collected more than 150 ms apart may not provide\n\
    \        reliable information on channel conditions.\n   Based on these flaws,\
    \ the authors propose the Robust Rate Adaptation\n   Algorithm (RRAA).  RRAA utilizes\
    \ only the frame loss ratio at the\n   current transmission rate to determine\
    \ whether to increase or\n   decrease the transmission rate; PHY layer information\
    \ or probe\n   packets are not used.  Each transmission rate is associated with\
    \ an\n   estimation window, a maximum tolerable loss threshold (MTL) and an\n\
    \   opportunistic rate increase threshold (ORI).  If the loss ratio is\n   larger\
    \ than the MTL, the transmission rate is decreased, and if it is\n   smaller than\
    \ the ORI, transmission rate is increased; otherwise\n   transmission rate remains\
    \ the same.  The thresholds are selected in\n   order to maximize throughput.\
    \  Although RRAA only allows movement\n   between adjacent transmission rates,\
    \ the algorithm does not require\n   collection of an entire estimation window\
    \ prior to increasing or\n   decreasing transmission rates; if additional data\
    \ collection would\n   not change the decision, the change is made immediately.\n\
    \   The authors validate the RRAA algorithm using experiments and field\n   trials;\
    \ the results indicate that RRAA without adaptive RTS/CTS\n   outperforms the\
    \ ARF, AARF, and Sample Rate algorithms.  This occurs\n   because RRAA is not\
    \ as sensitive to transient frame loss and does not\n   use probing, enabling\
    \ it to more frequently utilize higher\n   transmission rates.  Where there are\
    \ no hidden stations, turning on\n   adaptive RTS/CTS reduces performance by at\
    \ most a few percent.\n   However, where there is substantial contention from\
    \ hidden stations,\n   adaptive RTS/CTS provides large performance gains, due\
    \ to reduction\n   in frame loss that enables selection of a higher transmission\
    \ rate.\n   In \"Efficient Mobility Management for Vertical Handoff between WWAN\n\
    \   and WLAN\" [Vertical], the authors propose use of signal strength and\n  \
    \ link utilization in order to optimize vertical handoff.  WLAN to WWAN\n   handoff\
    \ is driven by SSI decay.  When IEEE 802.11 SSI falls below a\n   threshold (S1),\
    \ Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based decay detection is\n   undertaken to determine\
    \ if the signal is likely to continue to decay.\n   If so, then handoff to the\
    \ WWAN is initiated when the signal falls\n   below the minimum acceptable level\
    \ (S2).  WWAN to WLAN handoff is\n   driven by both PHY and MAC characteristics\
    \ of the IEEE 802.11 target\n   network.  At the PHY layer, characteristics such\
    \ as SSI are examined\n   to determine if the signal strength is greater than\
    \ a minimum value\n   (S3).  At the MAC layer, the IEEE 802.11 Network Allocation\
    \ Vector\n   (NAV) occupation is examined in order to estimate the maximum\n \
    \  available bandwidth and mean access delay.  Note that depending on\n   the\
    \ value of S3, it is possible for the negotiated rate to be less\n   than the\
    \ available bandwidth.  In order to prevent premature handoff\n   between WLAN\
    \ and WWAN, S1 and S2 are separated by 6 dB; in order to\n   prevent oscillation\
    \ between WLAN and WWAN media, S3 needs to be\n   greater than S1 by an appropriate\
    \ margin.\n"

    \  identify the causes of convergence delay, including delays in\n   detection\
    \ of whether an interface is down or up.  While it is fastest\n   for a router\
    \ to utilize link indications if available, there are\n   situations in which\
    \ it is necessary to depend on loss of routing\n   packets to determine the state\
    \ of the link.  Once the link state has\n   been determined, a delay may occur\
    \ within the routing protocol in\n   order to dampen link flaps.  Finally, another\
    \ delay may be introduced\n   in propagating the link state change, in order to\
    \ rate limit link\n   state advertisements, and guard against instability.\n \
    \  \"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection\" [BFD] notes that link layers may\n \
    \  provide only limited failure indications, and that relatively slow\n   \"Hello\"\
    \ mechanisms are used in routing protocols to detect failures\n   when no link\
    \ layer indications are available.  This results in\n   failure detection times\
    \ of the order of a second, which is too long\n   for some applications.  The\
    \ authors describe a mechanism that can be\n   used for liveness detection over\
    \ any media, enabling rapid detection\n   of failures in the path between adjacent\
    \ forwarding engines.  A path\n   is declared operational when bidirectional reachability\
    \ has been\n   confirmed.\n   In \"Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) in IPv4\"\
    \ [RFC4436], a host\n   that has moved to a new point of attachment utilizes a\
    \ bidirectional\n   reachability test in parallel with DHCP [RFC2131] to rapidly\n\
    \   reconfirm an operable configuration.\n   In \"L2 Triggers Optimized Mobile\
    \ IPv6 Vertical Handover: The\n   802.11/GPRS Example\" [Park], the authors propose\
    \ that the mobile node\n   send a router solicitation on receipt of a \"Link Up\"\
    \ indication in\n   order to provide lower handoff latency than would be possible\

    \   immediate invalidation of the Care-of Address (CoA) on receipt of a\n   \"\
    Link Down\" indication.  However, this is problematic where a \"Link\n   Down\"\
    \ indication can be followed by a \"Link Up\" indication without a\n   resulting\
    \ change in IP configuration, as described in [RFC4436].\n   In \"Layer 2 Handoff\
    \ for Mobile-IPv4 with 802.11\" [Mun], the authors\n   suggest that MIPv4 Registration\
    \ messages be carried within\n   Information Elements of IEEE 802.11 Association/Reassociation\
    \ frames,\n   in order to minimize handoff delays.  This requires modification\
    \ to\n   the mobile node as well as 802.11 APs.  However, prior to detecting\n\
    \   network attachment, it is difficult for the mobile node to determine\n   whether\
    \ or not the new point of attachment represents a change of\n   network.  For\
    \ example, even where a station remains within the same\n   ESS, it is possible\
    \ that the network will change.  Where no change of\n   network results, sending\
    \ a MIPv4 Registration message with each\n   Association/Reassociation is unnecessary.\
    \  Where a change of network\n   results, it is typically not possible for the\
    \ mobile node to\n   anticipate its new CoA at Association/Reassociation; for\
    \ example, a\n   DHCP server may assign a CoA not previously given to the mobile\
    \ node.\n   When dynamic VLAN assignment is used, the VLAN assignment is not even\n\
    \   determined until IEEE 802.1X authentication has completed, which is\n   after\
    \ Association/Reassociation in [IEEE-802.11i].\n   In \"Link Characteristics Information\
    \ for Mobile IP\" [Lee], link\n   characteristics are included in registration/Binding\
    \ Update messages\n   sent by the mobile node to the home agent and correspondent\
    \ node.\n   Where the mobile node is acting as a receiver, this allows the\n \
    \  correspondent node to adjust its transport parameters window more\n   rapidly\
    \ than might otherwise be possible.  Link characteristics that\n   may be communicated\
    \ include the link type (e.g., 802.11b, CDMA (Code\n   Division Multiple Access),\
    \ GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), etc.)\n   and link bandwidth.  While the\
    \ document suggests that the\n   correspondent node should adjust its sending\
    \ rate based on the\n   advertised link bandwidth, this may not be wise in some\n\
    \   circumstances.  For example, where the mobile node link is not the\n   bottleneck,\
    \ adjusting the sending rate based on the link bandwidth\n   could cause congestion.\
    \  Also, where the transmission rate changes\n   frequently, sending registration\
    \ messages on each transmission rate\n   change could by itself consume significant\
    \ bandwidth.  Even where the\n   advertised link characteristics indicate the\
    \ need for a smaller\n   congestion window, it may be non-trivial to adjust the\
    \ sending rates\n   of individual connections where there are multiple connections\

    \ on the receipt of a registration message or Binding Update.\n   In \"Hotspot\
    \ Mitigation Protocol (HMP)\" [HMP], it is noted that Mobile\n   Ad-hoc NETwork\
    \ (MANET) routing protocols have a tendency to\n   concentrate traffic since they\
    \ utilize shortest-path metrics and\n   allow nodes to respond to route queries\
    \ with cached routes.  The\n   authors propose that nodes participating in an\
    \ ad-hoc wireless mesh\n   monitor local conditions such as MAC delay, buffer\
    \ consumption, and\n   packet loss.  Where congestion is detected, this is communicated\
    \ to\n   neighboring nodes via an IP option.  In response to moderate\n   congestion,\
    \ nodes suppress route requests; where major congestion is\n   detected, nodes\
    \ rate control transport connections flowing through\n   them.  The authors argue\
    \ that for ad-hoc networks, throttling by\n   intermediate nodes is more effective\
    \ than end-to-end congestion\n   control mechanisms.\n"

  - "A.3.  Transport Layer\n   Within the transport layer, proposals have focused\

    The BU-trigger method for improving TCP performance over Mobile\n   IPv6\" [Kim],\
    \ the authors note that handoff-related packet loss is\n   interpreted as congestion\
    \ by the transport layer.  In the case where\n   the correspondent node is sending\

    \ cwnd and ssthresh values,\n   which may have been reduced due to handoff-induced\
    \ packet loss.  The\n   authors recommend that cwnd and ssthresh be recovered\
    \ to pre-timeout\n   values, regardless of whether the link parameters have changed.\
    \  The\n   paper does not discuss the behavior of a mobile node sending a\n  \
    \ Binding Update, in the case where the mobile node is sending to the\n   correspondent\
    \ node.\n   In \"Effect of Vertical Handovers on Performance of TCP-Friendly Rate\n\
    \   Control\" [Gurtov], the authors examine the effect of explicit\n   handover\
    \ notifications on TCP-friendly rate control (TFRC).  Where\n   explicit handover\
    \ notification includes information on the loss rate\n   and throughput of the\
    \ new link, this can be used to instantaneously\n   change the transmission rate\
    \ of the sender.  The authors also found\n   that resetting the TFRC receiver\

    \   In \"Adapting End Host Congestion Control for Mobility\" [Eddy], the\n   authors\
    \ note that while MIPv6 with route optimization allows a\n   receiver to communicate\

    \ within MIPv4.  To provide a\n   communication vehicle that can be universally\
    \ employed, the authors\n   propose a TCP option that allows a connection endpoint\
    \ to inform a\n   peer of a subnet change.  The document does not advocate utilization\n\
    \   of \"Link Up\" or \"Link Down\" events since these events are not\n   necessarily\
    \ indicative of subnet change.  On detection of subnet\n   change, it is advocated\
    \ that the congestion window be reset to\n   INIT_WINDOW and that transport parameters\
    \ be re-estimated.  The\n   authors argue that recovery from slow start results\

    \ option is reserved for the very few\n      cases when an endpoint knows that\
    \ the congestion properties of a\n      path have changed.  Currently, this reduces\

    \ Using\n   Interarrival Times at the Receiver\" [Biaz], the authors propose a\n\
    \   scheme for differentiating congestive losses from wireless\n   transmission\
    \ losses based on inter-arrival times.  Where the loss is\n   due to wireless\
    \ transmission rather than congestion, congestive\n   backoff and cwnd adjustment\
    \ is omitted.  However, the scheme appears\n   to assume equal spacing between\
    \ packets, which is not realistic in an\n   environment exhibiting link layer\
    \ frame loss.  The scheme is shown to\n   function well only when the wireless\
    \ link is the bottleneck, which is\n   often the case with cellular networks,\
    \ but not with IEEE 802.11\n   deployment scenarios such as home or hotspot use.\n\
    \   In \"Improving Performance of TCP over Wireless Networks\" [Bakshi],\n   the\
    \ authors focus on the performance of TCP over wireless networks\n   with burst\
    \ losses.  The authors simulate performance of TCP Tahoe\n   within ns-2, utilizing\
    \ a two-state Markov model, representing \"good\"\n   and \"bad\" states.  Where\
    \ the receiver is connected over a wireless\n   link, the authors simulate the\
    \ effect of an Explicit Bad State\n   Notification (EBSN) sent by an Access Point\
    \ unable to reach the\n   receiver.  In response to an EBSN, it is advocated that\
    \ the existing\n   retransmission timer be canceled and replaced by a new dynamically\n\
    \   estimated timeout, rather than being backed off.  In the simulations,\n  \
    \ EBSN prevents unnecessary timeouts, decreasing RTT variance and\n   improving\
    \ throughput.\n   In \"A Feedback-Based Scheme for Improving TCP Performance in\
    \ Ad-Hoc\n   Wireless Networks\" [Chandran], the authors proposed an explicit\
    \ Route\n   Failure Notification (RFN), allowing the sender to stop its\n   retransmission\
    \ timers when the receiver becomes unreachable.  On\n   route reestablishment,\
    \ a Route Reestablishment Notification (RRN) is\n   sent, unfreezing the timer.\
    \  Simulations indicate that the scheme\n   significantly improves throughput\
    \ and reduces unnecessary\n   retransmissions.\n   In \"Analysis of TCP Performance\
    \ over Mobile Ad Hoc Networks\"\n   [Holland], the authors explore how explicit\
    \ link failure notification\n   (ELFN) can improve the performance of TCP in mobile\
    \ ad hoc networks.\n   ELFN informs the TCP sender about link and route failures\
    \ so that it\n   need not treat the ensuing packet loss as due to congestion.\
    \  Using\n   an ns-2 simulation of TCP Reno over 802.11 with routing provided\
    \ by\n   the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol, it is demonstrated that\n\
    \   TCP performance falls considerably short of expected throughput based\n  \
    \ on the percentage of the time that the network is partitioned.  A\n   portion\
    \ of the problem was attributed to the inability of the routing\n   protocol to\
    \ quickly recognize and purge stale routes, leading to\n   excessive link failures;\
    \ performance improved dramatically when route\n   caching was turned off.  Interactions\
    \ between the route request and\n   transport retransmission timers were also\
    \ noted.  Where the route\n   request timer is too large, new routes cannot be\
    \ supplied in time to\n   prevent the transport timer from expiring, and where\
    \ the route\n   request timer is too small, network congestion may result.\n \
    \  For their implementation of ELFN, the authors piggybacked additional\n   information\
    \ (sender and receiver addresses and ports, the TCP\n   sequence number) on an\
    \ existing \"route failure\" notice to enable the\n   sender to identify the affected\
    \ connection.  Where a TCP receives an\n   ELFN, it disables the retransmission\
    \ timer and enters \"stand-by\"\n   mode, where packets are sent at periodic intervals\
    \ to determine if\n   the route has been reestablished.  If an acknowledgment\
    \ is received,\n   then the retransmission timers are restored.  Simulations show\
    \ that\n   performance is sensitive to the probe interval, with intervals of 30\n\
    \   seconds or greater giving worse performance than TCP Reno.  The\n   effect\
    \ of resetting the congestion window and RTO values was also\n   investigated.\
    \  In the study, resetting the congestion window to one\n   did not have much\
    \ of an effect on throughput, since the\n   bandwidth/delay of the network was\
    \ only a few packets.  However,\n   resetting the RTO to a high initial value\
    \ (6 seconds) did have a\n   substantial detrimental effect, particularly at high\
    \ speed.  In terms\n   of the probe packet sent, the simulations showed little\
    \ difference\n   between sending the first packet in the congestion window, or\n\
    \   retransmitting the packet with the lowest sequence number among those\n  \
    \ signaled as lost via the ELFNs.\n   In \"Improving TCP Performance over Wireless\
    \ Links\" [Goel], the\n   authors propose use of an ICMP-DEFER message, sent by\
    \ a wireless\n   Access Point on failure of a transmission attempt.  After exhaustion\n\
    \   of retransmission attempts, an ICMP-RETRANSMIT message is sent.  On\n   receipt\
    \ of an ICMP-DEFER message, the expiry of the retransmission\n   timer is postponed\
    \ by the current RTO estimate.  On receipt of an\n   ICMP-RETRANSMIT message,\
    \ the segment is retransmitted.  On\n   retransmission, the congestion window\
    \ is not reduced; when coming out\n   of fast recovery, the congestion window\
    \ is reset to its value prior\n   to fast retransmission and fast recovery.  Using\
    \ a two-state Markov\n   model, simulated using ns-2, the authors show that the\
    \ scheme\n   improves throughput.\n   In \"Explicit Transport Error Notification\
    \ (ETEN) for Error-Prone\n   Wireless and Satellite Networks\" [Krishnan], the\
    \ authors examine the\n   use of explicit transport error notification (ETEN)\
    \ to aid TCP in\n   distinguishing congestive losses from those due to corruption.\
    \  Both\n   per-packet and cumulative ETEN mechanisms were simulated in ns-2,\n\
    \   using both TCP Reno and TCP SACK over a wide range of bit error rates\n  \
    \ and traffic conditions.  While per-packet ETEN mechanisms provided\n   substantial\
    \ gains in TCP goodput without congestion, where congestion\n   was also present,\
    \ the gains were not significant.  Cumulative ETEN\n   mechanisms did not perform\
    \ as well in the study.  The authors point\n   out that ETEN faces significant\
    \ deployment barriers since it can\n   create new security vulnerabilities and\
    \ requires implementations to\n   obtain reliable information from the headers\
    \ of corrupt packets.\n   In \"Towards More Expressive Transport-Layer Interfaces\"\
    \ [Eggert2],\n   the authors propose extensions to existing network/transport\
    \ and\n   transport/application interfaces to improve the performance of the\n\
    \   transport layer in the face of changes in path characteristics\n   varying\
    \ more quickly than the round-trip time.\n   In \"Protocol Enhancements for Intermittently\
    \ Connected Hosts\"\n   [Schuetz], the authors note that intermittent connectivity\
    \ can lead\n   to poor performance and connectivity failures.  To address these\n\
    \   problems, the authors combine the use of the Host Identity Protocol\n   (HIP)\
    \ [RFC4423] with a TCP User Timeout Option and TCP Retransmission\n   trigger,\
    \ demonstrating significant improvement.\n"

  - "A.4.  Application Layer\n   In \"Application-oriented Link Adaptation for IEEE\
    \ 802.11\"\n   [Haratcherev2], rate information generated by a link layer utilizing\n\
    \   improved rate adaptation algorithms is provided to a video\n   application,\
    \ and used for codec adaptation.  Coupling the link and\n   application layers\
    \ results in major improvements in the Peak Signal\n   to Noise Ratio (PSNR).\
    \  Since this approach assumes that the link\n   represents the path bottleneck\
    \ bandwidth, it is not universally\n   applicable to use over the Internet.\n\
    \   At the application layer, the usage of \"Link Down\" indications has\n   been\
    \ proposed to augment presence systems.  In such systems, client\n   devices periodically\
    \ refresh their presence state using application\n   layer protocols such as SIP\
    \ for Instant Messaging and Presence\n   Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) [RFC3428]\
    \ or Extensible Messaging and\n   Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC3921].  If the\
    \ client should become\n   disconnected, their unavailability will not be detected\
    \ until the\n   presence status times out, which can take many minutes.  However,\
    \ if\n   a link goes down, and a disconnect indication can be sent to the\n  \
    \ presence server (presumably by the Access Point, which remains\n   connected),\
    \ the status of the user's communication application can be\n   updated nearly\
    \ instantaneously.\n"
