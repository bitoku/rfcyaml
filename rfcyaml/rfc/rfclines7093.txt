This document specifies additional example methods for generating Key Identifier values for use in the AKI (Authority Key Identifier) and SKI (Subject Key Identifier) certificate extensions.
Introduction [RFC5280] defines the AKI (Authority Key Identifier) and SKI (Subject Key Identifier) certificate extensions.
[RFC5280] describes two example mechanisms for generating AKI and SKI values: a 160 bit SHA 1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) hash of the public key and a four bit type field with the value 0100
followed by the least significant 60 bits of the SHA 1 hash.
Both of these mechanisms were designed to not be critical to security.
This document defines three additional mechanisms for generating Key Identifier values using SHA 256, SHA 384, and SHA 512 [SHS]
that are similar to those examples defined in [RFC5280] as well as one based on hashing the certificate's Subject Public Key Info field.
Additional Methods for Generating Key Identifiers
[RFC5280] specifies two examples for generating key identifiers from public keys.
Four additional mechanisms are as follows:
The keyIdentifier is composed of the leftmost 160 bits of the SHA 256 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused bits).
The keyIdentifier is composed of the leftmost 160 bits of the SHA 384 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused bits).
The keyIdentifier is composed of the leftmost 160 bits of the SHA 512 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused bits).
The keyIdentifier is composed of the hash of the DER encoding of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo value.
This section provides some examples.
The keys and SKIs are presented in hexadecimal (two hex digits per byte).
Given the following DER encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo value holding an P 256 ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
key: 30 59 30 13 06 07
The SHA 256 hash of the 65 bytes 047F7F...
BF37B3E5808FD46D54B28E846311BCCE1CAD2E1A62AA9092EF3EFB3F11451F44 The SHA 1 hash of these 65 bytes is: 6FEF9162C0A3F2E7608956D41C37DA0C8E87F0AE
The SHA 256 hash of the 91 bytes 305930...
6D20896AB8BD833B6B66554BD59B20225D8A75A296088148399D7BF763D57405 Using method 1 from Section 2, the subjectKeyIdentifier would be: 30 1D 06 03
Using method 4 from Section 2 with SHA 256 and no truncation, the subjectKeyIdentifier extensions would be: 30 29 06 03 551D0E
The security considerations of [RFC5280] apply to certificates.
The security considerations of [RFC5758] apply to the hash algorithms.
While hash algorithms provide preimage resistance, second preimage resistance, and collision resistance, none of these properties are needed for key identifiers.
