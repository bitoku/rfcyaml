  - "1.  Introduction\n   Traditional, paper-based communication of individual student\
    \ records\n   protects the rights and interests of all stakeholders -- the\n \
    \  secondary school officials who curate student records, the students\n   who\
    \ are both the subjects and distributors of their own individual\n   records,\
    \ and the college admission officers, prospective employers,\n   and others who,\
    \ with the permission of individual students, receive\n   and review such records.\
    \  In the traditional process, when a\n   graduating student applies for employment\
    \ or admission to an\n   institution of higher learning, she asks the guidance\
    \ counselor at\n   her secondary school for a transcript of her academic achievements\
    \ to\n   support her application.  In response, the guidance counselor\n   prepares\
    \ a paper record of that student's achievements and presents\n   it to her so\
    \ that she might forward that transcript to whomever she\n   pleases.  In order\
    \ to prevent forgery of academic transcripts, the\n   paper record presented to\
    \ the student often includes various marks of\n   its authenticity, such as an\
    \ imprint of the school seal or the\n   signature of an authorized school official.\
    \  In order to prevent\n   unauthorized alteration of transcript content, the\
    \ prepared document\n   is sometimes presented to the student inside a sealed\
    \ postal envelope\n   that cannot easily be opened without detection -- perhaps\
    \ aided by\n   tamper-proof tape, signed envelope flaps, or even imprinted wax\n\
    \   seals.  The integrity of the envelope's physical seal assures the\n   recipient\
    \ that its contents have not been altered in transit; seals\n   and signatures\
    \ affixed to the enclosed document assure the recipient\n   of the transcript's\
    \ legitimacy.  The student's privacy is assured by\n   her ability to forward\
    \ the sealed transcript to whomever she pleases\n   without the knowledge of or\
    \ further consultation with the school.\n                                    \

    \  +---------+\n   Figure 1: Corrupted Model for Exchanging Secondary School Transcripts\n\
    \   While the traditional process of distributing academic transcripts\n   admirably\
    \ protects student privacy and prerogatives, that process\n   also requires manual\
    \ effort from the school staff for the preparation\n   of each transcript.  On\
    \ the premise of reducing that effort, some\n   school officials have gratuitously\
    \ misapplied technology in a way\n   that guts student privacy and effectively\
    \ excludes students from\n   their own business.  Figure 1 illustrates an increasingly\
    \ common\n   aberration.  Rather than adopting standardized, readily available\n\
    \   technology to protect the integrity of transmitted student data -- as\n  \
    \ it had once been protected by their own signatures on sealed\n   envelopes --\
    \ school officials interpose themselves (or their agents)\n   between students\
    \ and transcript recipients, claiming falsely that no\n   other approach adequately\
    \ assures the confidentiality, origin, and\n   integrity of transcript content\
    \ or the reliability of transcript\n   transmission.  By introducing the role\
    \ of \"third-party processor\" in\n   Figure 1, educators disrupt what should\
    \ be private, bilateral\n   relationships between students and their chosen correspondents,\n\
    \   implicitly denying the legitimacy of any technical means by which a\n   student\
    \ might manage and secure his/her own communication.\n   By coercing students\
    \ into a false choice between surrendering their\n   privacy or accepting the\
    \ limitations of a neglected, largely manual\n   system, educators and allied\
    \ service providers gain significant new\n   benefits at student expense.  Among\
    \ these benefits is the creation of\n   an otherwise unneeded educational services\
    \ industry to mediate\n   communication between students and transcript recipients\
    \ --\n   communication that, by the most natural operation of the Internet,\n\
    \   would otherwise be end-to-end.  A second consequence of coerced\n   mediation\
    \ is that the mediators gain unfettered control over school\n   records that would\
    \ otherwise be private and often protected by law.\n   A third consequence of\
    \ coerced mediation is that mediators can\n   harvest candid data on student behavior\
    \ outside the secondary school\n   domain.  Even the most basic information about\
    \ college and employment\n   applications, successful or not, individual or in\
    \ the aggregate, can\n   have significant value for secondary school officials,\
    \ college\n   administrators, employers, and general marketing professionals.\n\
    \   Moreover, although such data is historically private, it is also more\n  \
    \ valuable and legally less well protected than internal secondary\n   school\
    \ records.\n   Mediated transcript distribution vitiates student privacy while\n\
    \   endowing school bureaucrats and their confederates with undeserved\n   privilege,\
    \ but these political concessions are utterly unnecessary to\n   automated transcript\
    \ distribution.  As suggested by Figure 2, the\n   political concessions intrinsic\
    \ to mediated transcript exchange can\n   be largely eliminated by the most straightforward\
    \ automation of the\n   traditional transcript process.\n   This memo specifies\
    \ a common format for exchanging secondary school\n   academic transcripts via\
    \ electronic mail.  Because the defined format\n   supports digital signature\
    \ of transcripts by their originator, a\n   student cannot fabricate or alter\
    \ transcript information provided by\n   school officials.  Because the described\
    \ format supports encrypted\n   transmission of school transcripts, the distribution\
    \ of each\n   student's information can remain private and under his or her\n\
    \   control.  Because the format supports asymmetric cryptography, the\n   origin\
    \ and integrity of received transcripts can be verified\n   independently by the\
    \ recipient; confidential content can be\n   independently recovered by an intended\
    \ recipient while remaining\n   protected from unauthorized access.  Because the\
    \ Internet email\n   protocol provides fail-safe delivery, transcripts are reliably\n\
    \   delivered to their intended recipients, and the sending student is\n   directly\
    \ notified of any exceptions.  No centralized, trusted\n   authority is needed\
    \ to mediate communication between students,\n   transcript originators, or transcript\
    \ recipients.  Thus, a student's\n   need for an authoritative record of his education\
    \ cannot be exploited\n   to restrict or monitor his/her free and private interactions\
    \ with\n   colleges, employers, or others.  Students can reclaim control over\n\
    \   their own personal information and their relationships with\n   prospective\
    \ employers and admissions officers; students can prevent\n   surreptitious harvesting\
    \ of information about their affairs.  Last\n   but not least, specialized software\
    \ is not required by most\n   participants in the school transcript exchange protocol:\
    \ the needs of\n   all students and many transcript recipients can be met by existing,\n\
    \   standards-based, secure email clients.\n                                 \

- title: 2.  Design Motivation
  contents:
  - "2.  Design Motivation\n   Implicit in any protocol definition is some assignment\
    \ of functions\n   to the various protocol participants.  When those participants\
    \ are\n   administratively independent one from another, binding assignments of\n\
    \   protocol function -- which might otherwise seem purely technical\n   choices\
    \ -- are politically significant.  For the sake of\n   transparency, this protocol\
    \ specification explicitly reckons the\n   political consequences of its implicit\
    \ design choices.\n   Preparation and delivery of secondary school transcripts\
    \ most affects\n   the interests of individual students.  After all, the process\
    \ is\n   entirely motivated by a student's need to certify his or her personal\n\
    \   academic achievements as evidence of merit for employment, higher\n   education,\
    \ or other social advancement or reward.  Accordingly,\n   individual student\
    \ needs properly dominate the design of a common\n   system for transcript exchange.\
    \  Because a secondary school\n   transcript certifies a student's personal merit,\
    \ students need\n   transcript documents that are credible to recipients -- for\
    \ which the\n   origin and integrity of transcript content is assured.  Because\
    \ a\n   school transcript records personal information about an individual\n \
    \  student, student privacy is paramount: control of transcript\n   distribution\
    \ must be closely held by the individual student, and each\n   student must be\
    \ able to protect the confidentiality of his or her\n   transcript in transit.\n\
    \   Communication of transcript content between originator, student, and\n   ultimate\
    \ recipient is most secure only if that communication is end-\n   to-end.  While\
    \ the end-to-end argument [Sal84] is fundamental to the\n   design of the Internet,\
    \ it is also critical to the design of secure\n   communication protocols (see\
    \ Section 6.2 of RFC 1958 [RFC1958]).  In\n   contrast, securely communicating\
    \ student information to a centralized\n   (and otherwise uninvolved) third party\
    \ clearly degrades student\n   privacy and increases cost.  Claims to the contrary\
    \ are at best\n   logically absurd and at worst darkly motivated.\n   After students,\
    \ transcript handling must address the interests of\n   transcript recipients,\
    \ which may include college admission officers,\n   prospective employers, and\
    \ scholarship foundations.  Recipients must\n   be able to evaluate the origin\
    \ and integrity of received transcript\n   documents easily and independently.\
    \  Secondarily, recipients may\n   benefit from mechanical extraction and summary\
    \ of transcript content\n   to support their own internal decision processes.\n\
    \   Finally, common transcript handling must address the needs of the\n   transcript\
    \ originator -- typically a secondary school guidance\n   counselor or other school\
    \ official.  An originator's legitimate\n   interests are reducing the cost of\
    \ preparing transcript documents and\n   meeting any legal or moral obligations\
    \ to protect student privacy.\n   Insofar as the very notion of electronic school\
    \ transcripts implies\n   their automated preparation by computers, dramatic cost\
    \ reductions\n   over traditional manual processes are also implicit.  An originator's\n\
    \   obligation to protect student privacy is most elegantly and\n   inexpensively\
    \ met by simply not conveying transcript information\n   about a particular student\
    \ to anyone other than that student.\n   A protocol by which students must request\
    \ transcript distributions\n   addresses no actual student need but, rather, only\
    \ the legal needs of\n   third parties seeking to intervene in otherwise private\n\
    \   communications.  The additional effort of formal transcript requests\n   is\
    \ needed only when a mediating third party is involved, because, in\n   many jurisdictions,\
    \ sharing personal information with the third party\n   legally requires student\
    \ consent, and an electronic transcript\n   request may be conveniently construed\
    \ as implicit consent.  Moreover,\n   a formal transcript request-response protocol\
    \ is not needed to\n   document delivery of a transcript to its intended recipient.\
    \  When\n   the student, rather than a third party, directly conveys his/her\n\
    \   transcript to a chosen recipient, that student has the greatest\n   interest\
    \ in successful communication, can observe any communication\n   failures firsthand,\
    \ and can take corrective action if needed.\n   Familiar, standardized protocols\
    \ provide unambiguous feedback to the\n   student about successful transcript\
    \ delivery.  The SMTP protocol, in\n   particular, is defined and implemented\
    \ to be fail-safe, as described\n   in Section 4.1.1.4 of its specification [RFC5321]:\n\
    \      Receipt of the end of mail data indication requires the server to\n   \
    \   process the stored mail transaction information.  This processing\n      consumes\
    \ the information in the reverse-path buffer, the forward-\n      path buffer,\
    \ and the mail data buffer, and on the completion of\n      this command these\

  - "3.  Protocol Overview\n   Existing, standardized technology simplifies the process\
    \ of preparing\n   and distributing secondary school transcripts.  Using a computerized\n\
    \   procedure, a secondary school administrator prepares a digital\n   transcript\
    \ document that records the academic achievements of a\n   particular student\
    \ and presents that document to that student.  Using\n   postal delivery, secure\
    \ email, or other method, the student conveys\n   digital copies of the prepared\
    \ transcript to recipients of his or her\n   choice.  Using a computerized procedure,\
    \ each recipient may\n   independently verify that the received transcript has\
    \ not been forged\n   or altered in transit.  Because the received transcript\
    \ is digital,\n   each recipient may use computerized procedures to extract and\n\
    \   summarize transcript content for local review and processing.\n   Preparing\
    \ and delivering a secondary school transcript entails\n   interaction among three\
    \ kinds of participant -- transcript\n   originator, student, and transcript recipient\
    \ -- each of whom\n   performs a distinct functional role.  Interactions between\
    \ each kind\n   of participant are proscribed below.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Student and Originator
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Student and Originator\n   A transcript originator assembles and digitally\
    \ signs academic\n   transcripts that document the achievements of individual\
    \ students in\n   a secondary school.  The role of transcript originator is frequently\n\
    \   filled by the director of a high-school guidance department or other\n   secondary\
    \ school official.  At fixed times throughout the school\n   year, using then-current\
    \ information from a student database, the\n   guidance director executes a computer\
    \ program that, for each relevant\n   student, automatically creates an individual\
    \ transcript report and\n   digitally signs that report on the director's behalf.\
    \  The format of\n   each signed transcript document is defined in Section 5 below.\n\
    \   The principal responsibilities of a transcript originator are:\n   1.  Generate\
    \ an OpenPGP key pair that can be used to sign school\n       transcripts.\n \
    \  2.  Create and securely store a key revocation certificate for the\n      \
    \ signing key pair for possible future use should it be\n       compromised.\n\
    \   3.  Publish on the World Wide Web the public component of the\n       transcript\
    \ signing key pair, together with its OpenPGP\n       fingerprint.\n   4.  Securely\
    \ store the private component of the signing key pair and\n       protect its\
    \ use with a judiciously chosen passphrase known only\n       to the transcript\
    \ originator.\n   5.  Use the signing key pair to create and digitally sign transcripts\n\
    \       for individual students.\n   6.  Present each signed transcript confidentially\
    \ to the individual\n       student to which it pertains.\n   Once generated by\
    \ the transcript originator, each transcript is\n   conveyed to the relevant student\
    \ using any means that protects the\n   confidentiality of individual student\
    \ data.  For example, a digital\n   transcript may be written to a CD-ROM storage\
    \ disk and presented to\n   the relevant student when he comes to school.  Alternatively,\
    \ that\n   same CD-ROM could be sealed in an envelope and sent to the student\n\
    \   via postal delivery.  A student could present a USB flash drive in\n   person\
    \ at the school guidance office, and her digital transcript\n   could be copied\
    \ onto that drive.  A digital school transcript could\n   also be presented to\
    \ the relevant student as a MIME attachment to an\n   email message that is encrypted\
    \ according to the OpenPGP\n   specification.  When email is used to convey school\
    \ transcripts to\n   students, formatting such messages as specified in Section\
    \ 6 below\n   will foster security and interoperability.\n   After a student receives\
    \ his/her transcript from its originator, that\n   student is solely responsible\
    \ for conveying that transcript to any\n   recipients of his/her choosing, as\
    \ described in Section 3.2 below.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Transcript Requests
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Transcript Requests\n   For several reasons, how students request generation\
    \ of an academic\n   transcript from their secondary school is a local matter\
    \ that need\n   not and ought not be addressed here.\n   First, the volume of\
    \ requests for transcripts is likely to be\n   relatively low, because transcripts\
    \ can be pre-issued to most\n   students (e.g., graduating seniors) who are likely\
    \ to need them.\n   When transcripts are digital and easily duplicated by the\
    \ student,\n   there is no need to generate a new transcript document for each\n\
    \   desired recipient.  Accordingly, most transcript generation is driven\n  \
    \ not by student requests but rather by content updates arising from\n   the predictable\
    \ passing of marking periods or academic sessions\n   throughout the school year.\
    \  Thus, explicit requests for transcript\n   generation will be the exception\
    \ rather than the rule -- from\n   students who have lost a previously issued\
    \ transcript, or students\n   leaving the school prior to their graduation.\n\
    \   Second, a historical motivation for formalizing transcript requests\n   has\
    \ been to satisfy the school's legal obligation to protect student\n   privacy.\
    \  In many legal jurisdictions, school officials are required\n   to seek student\
    \ authorization for releasing information to a third\n   party.  Elaborate procedures\
    \ for requesting transcripts are attempts\n   to codify or automate that authorization\
    \ process.  However, because,\n   under the procedure defined here, each student's\
    \ information is\n   provided only to that student, no authorization for releasing\n\
    \   information to a third party is required.\n   Third, a codified transcript\
    \ request protocol affords almost no\n   benefit beyond enabling third-party processors\
    \ to assume the role of\n   transcript originator and/or distributor.  Students\
    \ need no formal\n   \"acknowledgment\" of their transcript requests: the transcript\
    \ itself\n   serves that purpose.  Because a digital transcript is easily\n  \
    \ generated by an automated procedure, there is no benefit to returning\n   a\
    \ request acknowledgment rather than the document actually requested.\n   The\
    \ primary goal of this protocol design is to strengthen student\n   privacy and\
    \ agency by eliminating third-party intrusion into what\n   would otherwise be\
    \ private, bilateral interactions between a student\n   and his school.  To codify\
    \ transcript requests is to undercut\n   directly that fundamental purpose, while\
    \ gratuitously restricting\n   local interactions between student and school.\n\
    \   When each student -- rather than a school official or mediating third\n  \
    \ party -- exercises principal control of distributing his or her own\n   transcript\
    \ information, any need for transcript requests is largely\n   obviated.  Thus,\
    \ exchanging and processing such requests is properly\n   a local matter and not\
    \ further addressed here.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Student and Recipient
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Student and Recipient\n   When a student is asked (e.g., by a college admissions\
    \ office or\n   prospective employer) to provide an official transcript of his\
    \ or her\n   academic achievements, that student may send to the requesting party\n\
    \   a copy of the digitally signed transcript document that he has\n   previously\
    \ received from his secondary school.  In this context, the\n   party requesting\
    \ that the student send a transcript is called a\n   transcript recipient.  Because\
    \ it is the student who conveys his own\n   transcript information, he or she\
    \ unambiguously controls the set of\n   recipients, and neither the secondary\
    \ school nor any third party is\n   responsible for or privy to the identities\
    \ of his correspondents.\n   Similarly, the student is responsible for assuring\
    \ the privacy of his\n   or her personal information as he conveys it to these\
    \ recipients.\n   The student may convey his transcript to his chosen recipient\
    \ using\n   any mutually agreeable strategy.  For example, he may print a copy\
    \ of\n   his transcript onto a postcard and send it via postal delivery.  This\n\
    \   strategy does not strongly protect the confidentiality of the\n   student's\
    \ information in transit, nor does this strategy allow the\n   recipient to automate\
    \ verification or other processing of the\n   received transcript information.\
    \  Sending a paper transcript sealed\n   in a postal envelope better protects\
    \ student confidentiality, but\n   similarly restricts the recipient's ability\
    \ to verify or process\n   transcript contents.  By copying his digital transcript\
    \ onto a CD-ROM\n   storage disk and sending that disk, sealed in a postal envelope,\
    \ via\n   surface mail, the recipient can automatically verify and process the\n\
    \   transcript content, although protection of student confidentiality in\n  \
    \ transit might be stronger.\n   Alternatively, a student could send a copy of\
    \ the digital transcript\n   provided by his secondary school merely by attaching\
    \ the relevant\n   computer file to an email message addressed to the recipient.\
    \  If the\n   student completely trusts the end-to-end email transmission path\
    \ from\n   himself to his intended recipient (e.g., if student and recipient are\n\
    \   connected by a common, private network), then the student could send\n   his\
    \ transcript in a plaintext email; otherwise, the student SHOULD\n   encrypt the\
    \ email contents to protect his privacy during\n   transmission.\n   If a student\
    \ chooses to convey his/her school transcript to a\n   transcript recipient via\
    \ electronic mail, then the principal\n   responsibilities of that student are:\n\
    \   1.  Create a personal email account and associated email address from\n  \
    \     which transmissions of the student's signed school transcript may\n    \
    \   be sent.\n   2.  For each potential recipient of the student's signed school\n\
    \       transcript, discover and record the email address and the public\n   \
    \    OpenPGP key published by that transcript recipient.\n   3.  Import the OpenPGP\
    \ public key for each chosen recipient into the\n       local OpenPGP key database.\n\
    \   4.  Use an email client application that implements the OpenPGP/MIME\n   \
    \    specification [RFC3156] in order to encrypt and transmit a copy\n       of\
    \ the signed school transcript to each chosen recipient.\n   Using common formats\
    \ and methods to convey transcript content\n   protects students while also simplifying\
    \ processing for transcript\n   recipients.  The representation of transcripts\
    \ as specified in\n   Section 5 and the use of the transmission formats specified\
    \ in\n   Section 6 afford privacy and autonomy to students.  By using these\n\
    \   formats, recipients may independently verify the origin and integrity\n  \
    \ of the transcript information that students provide.  Common\n   transcript\
    \ representation also allows recipients to automate the\n   storage, analysis,\
    \ and review of received transcripts.\n   However, a student cannot use the format\
    \ specified here to convey\n   his/her transcript to a chosen recipient unless\
    \ that recipient is\n   prepared to participate in the exchange.  The principal\n\
    \   responsibilities of a transcript recipient are:\n   1.  Generate an OpenPGP\
    \ key pair that can be used to encrypt student\n       transmissions of signed\
    \ school transcripts to the recipient.\n   2.  Create and securely store a key\
    \ revocation certificate for the\n       key pair generated above for possible\
    \ future use in the event\n       that the private key component is compromised.\n\
    \   3.  Create a (preferably dedicated) email address and mailbox to\n       which\
    \ students may direct transmissions of signed school\n       transcripts.\n  \
    \ 4.  Publish on the World Wide Web both the dedicated transcript email\n    \
    \   address and the public component of the OpenPGP key pair\n       generated\
    \ above, together with its OpenPGP fingerprint.\n   5.  Securely store the private\
    \ component of the OpenPGP key pair\n       generated above and guard its use\
    \ with a judiciously chosen\n       passphrase known only to the transcript recipient.\n\
    \   6.  Assemble a collection of public OpenPGP keys published by\n       legitimate\
    \ transcript originators.\n   7.  Receive and decrypt transcripts transmitted\
    \ by students.\n   8.  Validate the origin and integrity of each received transcript\n\
    \       using the public OpenPGP key of the relevant transcript\n       originator.\n\
    \   The similarity between the EESST transcript format and generic\n   OpenPGP/MIME\
    \ email messages allows transcript recipients to inspect,\n   verify, and extract\
    \ received school transcripts using existing,\n   widely deployed email clients.\
    \  By using email client applications\n   that support both the MIME and OpenPGP\
    \ specifications, transcript\n   recipients should easily be able to verify the\
    \ signature of the\n   transcript originator and to save the various transcript\
    \ components\n   locally for later review or processing.\n   Using familiar email\
    \ client applications for receiving and reviewing\n   small numbers of received\
    \ school transcripts does not preclude using\n   more automated systems to meet\
    \ the needs of university admissions\n   departments or large employers.  Larger-volume\
    \ transcript recipients\n   might ask students to direct their school transcripts\
    \ to a particular\n   email mailbox.  Transcripts so delivered could be periodically\n\
    \   received, validated, and otherwise organized by specialized\n   application\
    \ software.  Information in the computational component of\n   received transcripts\
    \ might be incorporated into a candidate database\n   to simplify more quantitative\
    \ evaluations of the applicant pool.\n"

  - "4.2.  Computational School Transcript\n   A computational school transcript represents\
    \ the academic\n   accomplishments of an individual student in a form suitable\
    \ for\n   automated processing.  Accordingly, the content of a computational\n\
    \   school transcript is rendered in Extensible Markup Language (XML)\n   [XML11]\
    \ and conveyed as a MIME body part whose content type is\n   \"application/xml\"\
    .  The syntax of the data conveyed by a\n   computational transcript MUST conform\
    \ to the XML schema for High\n   School Transcripts, Version 1.3.0 [Fun12b], published\
    \ by the\n   Postsecondary Electronic Standards Council (PESC).  This XML schema\n\
    \   depends in turn upon the Academic Record XML schema, Version 1.7.0\n   [Fun12a]\
    \ and the Core Main XML schema, Version 1.2.0 [Mar06], also\n   published by PESC.\
    \  Detailed semantics for the data elements defined\n   by these XML schema are\
    \ defined in the PESC XML implementation guide,\n   Version 1.3.0 [Ste12], which\
    \ also provides usage examples.\n   In order to protect student privacy, this\
    \ specification does not\n   require a school transcript to convey any particular\
    \ student\n   information but, rather, defines only a common format for whatever\n\
    \   student information may be voluntarily exchanged between consenting\n   parties.\
    \  The scope of the information exchanged is a completely\n   local matter, and\
    \ a transcript originator MAY omit from transcript\n   content any information\
    \ (e.g., a student's social security number,\n   the identity and location of\
    \ a student's parents, a student's race,\n   ethnicity, or transgender status)\
    \ that might be regarded locally as\n   sensitive or irrelevant.  Indeed, the\
    \ requirement that a\n   computational transcript conform syntactically to the\
    \ PESC XML schema\n   imposes few, if any, constraints upon the transcript originator's\n\
    \   choices regarding transcript content.  Figure 5 illustrates a minimal\n  \
    \ set of XML elements that satisfies the syntactic requirements of the\n   PESC\
    \ XML schema.  A computational transcript need convey no more\n   information\
    \ about an individual student than what little is conveyed\n   by that figure.\n\
    \   In order to prevent implicit monitoring and control of student\n   interactions\
    \ with transcript recipients, this specification restricts\n   certain uses of\
    \ the PESC XML schema by transcript originators.  In\n   every computational transcript,\
    \ the \"Destination\" sub-element of the\n   \"DataTransmission\" element MUST\
    \ convey no distinguishable information\n   and have the particular representation\n\
    \      \"<Destination><Organization/></Destination>\"\n   that is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 5.  This requirement assures that a\n   student may use self-made\
    \ copies of a signed transcript document for\n   whatever purposes he/she chooses\
    \ without further consultation with\n   issuing school officials.  If the transcript\
    \ originator is allowed to\n   brand particular destinations onto each copy of\
    \ a student transcript,\n   then the originator can easily monitor and (to some\
    \ degree) control\n   the set of college admissions officers, prospective employers,\
    \ or\n   other third parties to whom the student is providing that transcript.\n\
    \   Transcript recipients MUST reject any transcript whose content in any\n  \
    \ way specifies or restricts the audience, recipient, or distribution\n   for\
    \ that transcript.  Notwithstanding this restriction upon the\n   \"Destination\"\
    \ element, the \"Source\" element SHOULD be included within\n   a computational\
    \ transcript and convey information sufficient to\n   identify the secondary school\
    \ or other institution by which the\n   relevant transcript is issued.\n   <HSTrn:HighSchoolTranscript\n\

    .\n   6.  With the exception of those XML elements that appear in Figure 5,\n\
    \       information that is not provided in a computational transcript\n     \
    \  MUST be represented by entirely omitting the relevant XML data\n       element;\

- title: 4.3.  Display School Transcript
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Display School Transcript\n   A display school transcript describes the\
    \ academic accomplishments of\n   an individual student in a form suitable for\
    \ human reading and\n   review.  A display school transcript is represented as\
    \ a MIME body\n   part whose content type is \"application/pdf\" and whose content\n\
    \   conforms to the Portable Document Format (PDF) specification [PDF17].\n  \
    \ A display school transcript may comprise one or more physical pages.\n   In\
    \ order to reduce the chance that the recipient of a signed school\n   transcript\
    \ could misinterpret its content, the computational\n   component (described in\
    \ Section 4.2 above) and the display component\n   (defined here) of each signed\
    \ school transcript SHOULD convey, to the\n   greatest degree possible, identical\
    \ information about the academic\n   accomplishments of the relevant student.\n\
    \   Nothing in this specification should be construed as requiring\n   implementation\
    \ or use of digital signature features embedded in\n   individual PDF documents\
    \ pursuant to the PDF specification.  Rather,\n   the data integrity and origin\
    \ identity of all components in a school\n   transcript --- including the PDF\
    \ display transcript --- are\n   adequately protected by the OpenPGP signature\
    \ of the transcript\n   originator, required by this specification.  Accordingly,\n\
    \   implementation of PDF-specific signature features is optional and\n   largely\
    \ unwarranted; although transcript recipients MUST accept\n   transcripts that\
    \ include PDF signatures, recipients SHOULD neither\n   verify nor depend upon\
    \ the embedded signatures themselves.\n   Transcript originators MUST NOT use\
    \ the encryption features described\n   in the PDF specification to encrypt a\
    \ display school transcript.  The\n   OpenPGP encryption mechanisms specified\
    \ in Section 6 below adequately\n   protect the confidentiality of student information\
    \ while in transit.\n   Thus, separately encrypting the display transcript is\
    \ redundant.\n   Double encryption increases implementation complexity while also\n\
    \   increasing security risk by requiring additional key distributions.\n   Transcript\
    \ recipients MUST NOT accept or process school transcripts\n   for which the PDF\
    \ display component is independently encrypted.\n   Previous work [RFC3778] identifies\
    \ security considerations arising\n   from using the PDF as a MIME media type.\
    \  Among these considerations\n   is that PDF documents may include executable\
    \ \"scripts\" or references\n   to external, executable plug-in modules.  Including\
    \ arbitrary\n   executable programs (or references thereto) in a PDF transcript\n\
    \   document poses a security risk to transcript recipients.  Digitally\n   signing\
    \ PDF documents (or even the transcripts that contain them)\n   does not help\
    \ transcript recipients to evaluate the safety of\n   executing any embedded programs\
    \ or plug-ins.  The primary purpose of\n   using PDF is to present static transcript\
    \ information in an\n   attractive format for human review.  Because this limited\
    \ purpose is\n   admirably served without embedding executable elements in PDF\
    \ files,\n   any risk posed by their inclusion is unwarranted.  Accordingly,\n\
    \   transcript originators MUST NOT include in a PDF display transcript\n   any\
    \ executable scripts or external plug-in references.  In order to\n   preclude\
    \ execution of untrusted programs on their local system,\n   transcript recipients\
    \ SHOULD use only trusted tools to process and\n   view display transcripts.\n\
    \   The representation of a display school transcript SHOULD NOT include\n   any\
    \ header fields beyond those enumerated in the specification for\n   the format\
    \ of MIME message bodies [RFC2045].\n"
- title: 5.  Signed School Transcript
  contents:
  - "5.  Signed School Transcript\n   A signed school transcript is a MIME body part\
    \ whose form corresponds\n   to that of a signed OpenPGP/MIME message, as described\
    \ in section 5\n   of the OpenPGP/MIME specification [RFC3156].  Accordingly,\
    \ the MIME\n   content type of a signed school transcript is \"multipart/signed\"\
    , and\n   its form reflects the traditional use of multipart MIME structures to\n\
    \   secure email communication [RFC1847].  Thus, the body of a signed\n   school\
    \ transcript comprises exactly two parts, as illustrated in\n   Figure 6.  The\
    \ first part of the signed transcript body conveys the\n   transcript content,\
    \ in MIME canonical format, including an\n   appropriate set of MIME content headers.\
    \  The form and interpretation\n   of the transcript content is described in Section\
    \ 4 above.  The\n   second part of the signed transcript body is the school transcript\n\
    \   signature.  The signature part represents the OpenPGP digital\n   signature\
    \ of the transcript originator as it has been applied to the\n   transcript content\
    \ conveyed by the first part of the signed\n   transcript.  The transcript signature\

    \                Figure 7: Example Signed School Transcript\n   The \"Eesst-Version\"\
    \ header serves a crucial if non-obvious purpose\n   for protocol implementors.\
    \  The presence of this header unambiguously\n   distinguishes a signed school\
    \ transcript from elements of an\n   enveloping email message by which that transcript\
    \ may be conveyed.\n   For good reason, the format defined here for signed school\n\
    \   transcripts intentionally shares many characteristics with the\n   standard\
    \ format for OpenPGP/MIME messages [RFC3156].  This similarity\n   not only admits\
    \ some code reuse within recipient implementations,\n   but, most importantly,\
    \ also allows transcript recipients to inspect,\n   verify, and extract received\
    \ school transcripts using existing,\n   widely deployed email clients.\n   However,\
    \ the formal similarity between signed school transcripts and\n   generic signed\
    \ messages can complicate recipient implementations of\n   the transcript exchange\
    \ protocol, because every signed body part must\n   be fully evaluated to determine\
    \ its status.  When a signed school\n   transcript is conveyed to its recipient\
    \ enclosed within a signed\n   OpenPGP email message, both transcript and conveying\
    \ message share\n   the common MIME type \"multipart/signed\".  Moreover, both\
    \ signed\n   transcript and its conveying message share a common, high-level\n\
    \   structure comprising exactly two MIME body parts, independently\n   representing\
    \ the signed content and the applied digital signature.\n   When a \"multipart/signed\"\
    \ MIME body part is encountered as part of a\n   received email message, should\
    \ that body part be construed as a\n   proper signed school transcript, a signed\
    \ email message by which a\n   school transcript is conveyed, ill-formed school\
    \ transcript, or\n   something else altogether?  Without additional information,\n\
    \   unambiguously answering these questions requires that every signed\n   body\
    \ part be fully verified, parsed, validated, and checked, because,\n   absent\
    \ additional information, a receiving implementation cannot know\n   what tests\
    \ need to be applied.\n   Thus, the \"Eesst-Version\" header serves at least two\
    \ important\n   functions.  Most obviously, this header identifies what version\
    \ of\n   the EESST format has been applied in preparation of the relevant\n  \
    \ transcript.  Although, currently, the only acceptable version of the\n   EESST\
    \ format is 1.0, to deny even the possibility of future protocol\n   evolution\
    \ is to deny the lessons of history.  Less obviously, the\n   \"Eesst-Version\"\
    \ header allows simple, unambiguous detection of signed\n   school transcripts\
    \ while still allowing transcript recipients to\n   validate and review school\
    \ transcripts using familiar, widely\n   available email clients.  For these reasons,\
    \ the \"Eesst-Version\"\n   header MUST be included in signed school transcripts\
    \ and their\n   content component, but, in order to most fully realize its value\
    \ as\n   syntactic disambiguator, the \"Eesst-Version\" header MUST NOT appear\n\
    \   anywhere else.\n"
- title: 6.  Transcript Transmission
  contents:
  - "6.  Transcript Transmission\n   Provided that the transcript originator is prohibited\
    \ from disclosing\n   personal information without student consent, use of the\
    \ EESST\n   protocol empowers each student to limit sharing of his or her own\n\
    \   school transcript to recipients chosen by that student.  The design\n   of\
    \ the protocol not only protects the confidentiality of transcript\n   content\
    \ in transit but also increases the cost of surveillance by the\n   school or\
    \ other interested parties of the student's interactions with\n   colleges, prospective\
    \ employers, or other third parties.\n   A student may convey his signed school\
    \ transcript to his chosen\n   recipient using any medium or technology that is\
    \ agreeable to them\n   both.  For example, a student may copy his signed digital\
    \ transcript\n   onto a CD-ROM storage disk and send that physical medium to his\n\
    \   intended recipient via a postal mail service.  However, because email\n  \
    \ will frequently be the most convenient means for students to\n   distribute\
    \ their transcripts, this specification defines a common\n   email format by which\
    \ each student may privately convey his/her\n   signed school transcript to each\
    \ recipient.  A common form for\n   transcript transmission simplifies implementations\
    \ of the transcript\n   exchange protocol and fosters their interoperability.\
    \  A common\n   format allows high-volume transcript recipients to automate\n\
    \   decryption and validation of received transcripts as well as their\n   preparation\
    \ for subsequent review and analysis.  A common format that\n   derives from existing\
    \ email standards allows low-volume transcript\n   recipients to use popular email\
    \ client software to receive, decrypt,\n   validate, and review transcripts.\n\
    \   When a student conveys his transcript to a recipient via email, that\n   student's\
    \ confidential transcript information is vulnerable to\n   interception and disclosure.\
    \  In order to mitigate this threat, this\n   specification generally requires\
    \ that the conveying email message be\n   encrypted as described in the OpenPGP\
    \ standard [RFC3156].  Every\n   transcript recipient MUST be prepared to accept\
    \ all transcript\n   transmissions that are encrypted as described in any of the\
    \ sections\n   below.  A student SHOULD use either the encrypted transmission\
    \ format\n   (Section 6.1) or the encrypted and signed transmission format\n \
    \  (Section 6.2), if he or she independently trusts that the\n   transmitting\
    \ computer will correctly transmit his or her transcript\n   according to the\
    \ OpenPGP/MIME specification without disclosing its\n   plaintext content.  Otherwise,\
    \ students MAY use the encrypted file\n   transmission format (Section 6.3) or\
    \ traditional inline transmission\n   format (Section 6.4) below.  These latter\
    \ formats simplify using a\n   more trusted computer to encrypt a student's transcript\
    \ and later\n   transferring its encrypted form to a less trusted computer for\n\
    \   transmission to the chosen recipient.\n   Because transcript transmissions\
    \ must be encrypted in order to assure\n   student privacy, every potential transcript\
    \ recipient MUST generate\n   an OpenPGP key pair and publish its public component\
    \ for use by\n   students in the preparation of those transmissions.  The public\
    \ key\n   for each transcript recipient should be published (together with its\n\
    \   OpenPGP fingerprint) on the web page for that recipient or in the\n   global\
    \ OpenPGP key database.  To protect the privacy of personal\n   information transmitted\
    \ to each chosen recipient, a student need only\n   retrieve the published key\
    \ for that recipient and use it to encrypt\n   the transcript transmission.\n\
    \   With some effort, however, an attacker could, by masquerading as a\n   legitimate\
    \ transcript recipient, perhaps trick a student into\n   transmitting private\
    \ information to the attacker, encrypted in a key\n   that is known to the attacker.\
    \  In order to protect student privacy\n   in the face of such attacks, a transcript\
    \ recipient should resist\n   successful forgery of his/her OpenPGP identity by\
    \ asking other\n   trustworthy individuals (e.g., respected colleagues or institutional\n\
    \   officers) to certify that identity.  An OpenPGP identity is certified\n  \
    \ by affixing another's digital signature to the associated OpenPGP key\n   (see\
    \ Section 12 of the OpenPGP message format specification [RFC4880]\n   and Section\
    \ 3 in the GNU Privacy Handbook [GPH]).  Those who sign a\n   recipient's public\
    \ key are implicitly vouching for the association\n   between that key and the\
    \ true identity of the recipient.  Consistent\n   with the view that the student\
    \ bears primary responsibility for the\n   privacy of his/her transcript information,\
    \ the student is ultimately\n   responsible for evaluating the authenticity of\
    \ public keys that he/\n   she uses to encrypt that information while in transit.\
    \  Adding\n   certifying signatures to a recipient's key reduces the chance that\
    \ a\n   student could be deceived by an imposter.\n   In order to maximize student\
    \ privacy and autonomy, the operation of\n   this protocol sharply separates the\
    \ function of transcript creation\n   from the function of transcript transmission.\
    \  The former function is\n   assigned exclusively to the issuing secondary school\
    \ (the transcript\n   originator), while the latter function is assigned exclusively\
    \ to the\n   individual student.  Participants in the protocol must behave so\
    \ as\n   to preserve the privacy afforded by this separation.  A transcript\n\
    \   originator MUST NOT transmit, share, or distribute a school\n   transcript\
    \ or any component thereof to any party other than the\n   individual student\
    \ to whom it pertains.  A transcript recipient MUST\n   reject any transcript\
    \ that seems to have been transmitted by or on\n   behalf of anyone but the student.\
    \  Although non-student transcript\n   transmission can be difficult to detect\
    \ reliably, certain\n   transmission characteristics unambiguously suggest abuse\
    \ of student\n   prerogatives.  Accordingly, all recipient implementations MUST\
    \ detect\n   and reject transcript transmissions with any of the following\n \
    \  characteristics:\n   o  A transcript recipient MUST reject any transcript that\
    \ is\n      delivered in the same email message or on the same physical\n    \
    \  storage medium as any other.\n   o  A transcript recipient MUST reject any\
    \ transcript for which the\n      transcript originator and the sender of the\
    \ transcript\n      transmission are identical.\n   o  A transcript recipient\
    \ MUST reject any transcript for which the\n      transcript originator (who signs\
    \ that transcript) and the signer\n      of the transcript transmission are identical.\n\
    \   o  A transcript recipient MUST reject any transcript for which the\n     \
    \ received transcript transmission is addressed to multiple\n      recipients.\n"

  - "6.3.  Encrypted File Format\n   Privacy protections afforded by the EESST protocol\
    \ depend upon the\n   assumption that the computer used by the student to transmit\
    \ his or\n   her school transcript reliably executes the required EESST protocol\n\
    \   operations without disclosing confidential information.  In\n   particular,\
    \ the transmitting computer is assumed to prevent any\n   access to the plaintext\
    \ form of a school transcript by anyone but the\n   student.  The hardware and\
    \ software of the transmitting computer is\n   assumed to be free of any flaws\
    \ that could weaken the encryption\n   applied to his or her transcript.  The\
    \ transmitting computer is also\n   assumed to send the transcript reliably and\
    \ directly to each chosen\n   recipient without reporting to any third party either\
    \ the fact of\n   this transmission or the identity of the recipient.  Validating\
    \ these\n   assumptions can be especially problematic when the student does not\n\
    \   unilaterally own and control the transmitting computer.\n   Sometimes the\
    \ computer from which a student must transmit his or her\n   transcript cannot\
    \ reasonably be trusted.  Indeed, some email client\n   implementations manifestly\
    \ do not permit students to compose a secure\n   email message without sharing\
    \ private information with either their\n   email provider, system administrator,\
    \ or other third party.  Web-\n   based email clients are perhaps the most obvious\
    \ and widespread\n   example of intrinsically insecure email platforms: neither\n\
    \   cryptographic keys nor plaintext message content can be safely stored\n  \
    \ or processed on such systems.  Another example of intrinsically\n   insecure\
    \ platforms are computers and email servers provided for\n   student use by schools,\
    \ to which, as a practical matter, school\n   administrators and technical staff\
    \ enjoy unrestricted access.\n   A student may use the encrypted file transmission\

    \   using a more trusted computer to encrypt a student's transcript and\n   later\
    \ transferring its encrypted form to a less trusted computer for\n   transmission\
    \ to the chosen recipient.\n   For example, the student may use an implementation\
    \ of the OpenPGP\n   cryptographic algorithms on a trusted computer to encrypt\
    \ the\n   plaintext version of his or her signed school transcript, received\n\
    \   from the transcript originator.  The key used for this encryption is\n   the\
    \ public OpenPGP key of the intended transcript recipient.  The\n   binary file\
    \ that results from this encryption is then transferred\n   (e.g., via a USB flash\
    \ drive or networked file transfer protocol) to\n   a less trusted computer for\
    \ email transmission to the chosen\n   recipient.  On this less trusted computer,\
    \ the student invokes an\n   email client application to compose and send a plaintext\
    \ email\n   message (for example, see Figure 11) to the recipient that is\n  \
    \ formatted according to the MIME specification [RFC2045].  The binary\n   file\

    \ the message as a MIME attachment whose content type is\n   \"application/octet-stream\"\
    .\n   When the email message is received by the transcript recipient, the\n  \
    \ MIME attachment containing the encrypted school transcript may be\n   detached\

    \ correctly or\n   without disclosing the plaintext transcript.  In common with\
    \ the\n   encrypted file transmission format described above (Section 6.3), the\n\

    \ encrypt a student's transcript and later transferring its encrypted\n   form\
    \ to a less trusted computer for transmission to the chosen\n   recipient.\n \
    \  The traditional inline format allows a student to use an\n   implementation\
    \ of the OpenPGP cryptographic algorithms on a trusted\n   computer to encrypt\
    \ the plaintext version of his or her signed school\n   transcript, received from\
    \ the transcript originator.  The key used\n   for this encryption is the public\
    \ OpenPGP key of the intended\n   transcript recipient.  The encrypted transcript\
    \ is represented as an\n   ASCII-armored text file that is then transferred (e.g.,\
    \ via a USB\n   flash drive or networked file transfer protocol) to a less trusted\n\
    \   computer for email transmission to the chosen recipient.  On this\n   less\
    \ trusted computer, the student invokes an email client\n   application to compose\
    \ and send a plaintext email message to the\n   recipient.  The content of the\
    \ ASCII-armored file containing the\n   encrypted version of the student transcript\
    \ is pasted (or otherwise\n   inserted) into the new email message as the sole\
    \ content of its body.\n   A traditional inline transcript transmission has the\
    \ form of a simple\n   email message (in the Internet Message Format [RFC5322])\
    \ whose body\n   is exclusively and entirely the encrypted form of the signed\
    \ school\n   transcript being transmitted.  Representation of the included\n \
    \  transcript MUST conform to the OpenPGP Message Format specification\n   [RFC4880]\
    \ for the ASCII-armored encoding of the OpenPGP encryption of\n   the canonical\
    \ MIME representation of the relevant signed school\n   transcript.  An example\
    \ inline transcript transmission is illustrated\n   in Figure 12.\n   When the\
    \ email message is received by the transcript recipient, a\n   local OpenPGP implementation\
    \ is invoked to extract and decrypt the\n   inline representation of the encrypted\
    \ school transcript, using the\n   private OpenPGP encryption key generated by\
    \ the transcript recipient.\n   The process of extracting and decrypting the transmitted\
    \ school\n   transcript may be automated by large-volume transcript recipients.\n\
    \   While the traditional inline format is an acceptable method of secure\n  \
    \ transcript transmission, it is probably best suited to students who\n   lack\
    \ ready alternatives.  Because inline representation of OpenPGP\n   messages can\
    \ sometimes be incompatible with other email features and\n   conventions, the\

    \ OpenPGP, although none\n   is strictly relevant to a correctly formed EESST\
    \ transcript\n   transmission.  Accordingly, the traditional inline format may\
    \ be used\n   when needed but only with full consideration of its potential\n\
    \   limitations on interoperability.\n   Return-Path: <hermione@granger-dentistry.com.example>\n\

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security of the EESST protocol depends upon\
    \ the security of the\n   OpenPGP protocols on which it is based.  Although the\
    \ cryptographic\n   algorithms included in OpenPGP are among the strongest used\
    \ in any\n   known protocol, the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality\
    \ of\n   conveyed student information is not assured unless EESST protocol\n \
    \  implementors and users faithfully observe all requirements and\n   recommendations\
    \ of the relevant specifications ([RFC4880], [RFC3156],\n   and [RFC4270]).  In\
    \ particular, the SHA-256 digest algorithm and RSA\n   key lengths of at least\
    \ 2048 bits MUST be used.  Happily, these are\n   supported by all major OpenPGP\
    \ implementations.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Originator Private Key
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Originator Private Key\n   The authority and integrity of generated school\
    \ transcripts depend on\n   the continued secrecy of the private cryptographic\
    \ key by which those\n   transcripts are signed.  For greatest security, the guidance\
    \ director\n   should be physically present when and where the computer program\
    \ is\n   invoked to generate and sign the transcripts.\n   When an OpenPGP public-private\
    \ key pair is generated for use by a\n   transcript originator, a key revocation\
    \ certificate should also be\n   generated and securely stored.  In the event\
    \ that the generated key\n   pair is compromised, the stored revocation certificate\
    \ may be used to\n   notify others to reject subsequent uses of that key.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Originator Public Key
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Originator Public Key\n   The public cryptographic key for each transcript\
    \ originator should be\n   published (together with its OpenPGP fingerprint) on\
    \ the web page for\n   the originating institution and/or in the global OpenPGP\
    \ key\n   database.  Instructions for retrieving and validating the\n   originator's\
    \ public key should be included in the preface of all\n   issued transcripts.\n\
    \   An association of school guidance professionals may wish to publish\n   an\
    \ online collection of OpenPGP public keys submitted by their\n   members.  A\
    \ college admissions officer (or other high-volume\n   transcript recipient) could\
    \ then download and import this key\n   collection into a local key database for\
    \ use in verifying received\n   transcripts.\n"
- title: 7.3.  Originator Certification
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Originator Certification\n   In order to reduce the chance that an imposter\
    \ might successfully\n   masquerade as a particular transcript originator and\
    \ substitute a\n   false key for the authentic one, the identification of each\n\
    \   transcript originator with a particular OpenPGP key should be\n   certified\
    \ by other well-known, trustworthy officials.  To this end,\n   the public key\
    \ for a transcript originator should be signed by other\n   officials of the originating\
    \ secondary school, e.g., its principal,\n   senior faculty, or local school board\
    \ members.  The OpenPGP public\n   keys of these certifying officials should be\
    \ published.\n"

    \ key database.\n"
- title: 7.5.  Secure Clients
  contents:
  - "7.5.  Secure Clients\n   The cryptographic operations upon which the security\
    \ properties of\n   this protocol depend must be performed in private by the relevant\n\
    \   stakeholder.  The confidentiality of a student's personal transcript\n   information\
    \ cannot be sustained if others enjoy unauthorized access\n   to that content\
    \ during the process of encryption.  The integrity of\n   an originator's signature\
    \ on each transcript cannot be assured if\n   others can learn the originator's\
    \ secret key by observing the\n   signature process.  The confidentiality of personal\
    \ information sent\n   by many students to a particular transcript recipient cannot\
    \ be\n   assured if others can learn that recipient's secret key by observing\n\
    \   the decryption of received transcripts.  Therefore, every stakeholder\n  \
    \ should perform the cryptographic operations proscribed here only when\n   present\
    \ at a physically isolated computer that is entirely controlled\n   by that stakeholder\
    \ and that locally stores all keys and confidential\n   information.  Using \"\
    thin clients\" or web-based computing to perform\n   sensitive cryptographic operations\
    \ forfeits whatever protections this\n   protocol might have otherwise afforded.\n"
- title: 7.6.  Automatic Replies
  contents:
  - "7.6.  Automatic Replies\n   Recipient implementations should not reply automatically\
    \ or routinely\n   to received transcript transmissions.  Such replies could provide\n\
    \   valuable feedback to an attacker, especially if they can be elicited\n   at\
    \ will.\n"
- title: 8.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   The EESST exchange format is compatible with and\
    \ entails no\n   alterations to existing email standards.  Indeed, the syntactic\n\
    \   similarity between the exchange format and standardized email message\n  \
    \ formats empowers users to apply widely deployed email tools to\n   verify, interpret,\
    \ or otherwise manipulate secondary school\n   transcripts.\n   In the hope of\
    \ preventing any incompatibilities that could arise from\n   future standards\
    \ evolution or changes in common usage, this section\n   describes the registration\
    \ of two message header fields that are used\n   in the EESST exchange format\
    \ but currently lack any formal definition\n   in existing standards.  Consistent\
    \ with registration procedures\n   defined in RFC 3864 [RFC3864], the subsections\
    \ below describe\n   additions to the \"Message Headers\" registry maintained\
