- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The IP Payload Compression Protocol allows the compression\
    \ of IP\n   datagrams by supporting different compression algorithms.  This\n\
    \   document describes how to integrate the DEFLATE compression algorithm\n  \
    \ [Deutsch96] into IPCOMP [IPCOMP].\n   This document SHOULD be read in conjunction\
    \ with [IPCOMP] and MUST be\n   taken in its context.\n"
- title: 1.1 The DEFLATE Compression Algorithm
  contents:
  - "1.1 The DEFLATE Compression Algorithm\n   The 'deflate' compression format [Deutsch96],\
    \ as used by the PKZIP\n   and gzip compressors and as embodied in the freely\
    \ and widely\n   distributed zlib [Gailly95] library source code, has the following\n\
    \   features:\n   o an apparently unencumbered encoding and compression algorithm,\n\
    \     with an open and publicly-available specification.\n   o low-overhead escape\
    \ mechanism for incompressible data.  The PPP\n     Deflate specification offers\
    \ options to reduce that overhead\n     further.\n   o heavily used for many years\
    \ in networks, on modem and other point-\n     to-point links to transfer files\
    \ for personal computers and\n     workstations.\n   o easily achieves 2:1 compression\
    \ on the Calgary corpus [Corpus90]\n     using less than 64KBytes of memory on\
    \ both sender and receive.\n"

  - "1.3 Specification of Requirements\n   The keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",\n   and \"MAY\" that appear in this document\
    \ are to be interpreted as\n   described in [Bradner97].\n"
- title: 2. DEFLATE Algorithm Implementation
  contents:
  - "2. DEFLATE Algorithm Implementation\n   The DEFLATE compression algorithm was\
    \ designed by Phil Katz and its\n   details are publicly available in [Deutsch96].\
    \  Thus it is a good\n   freely available algorithm to implement within IPCOMP.\n\
    \   Compression and decompression algorithm details should be followed as\n  \
    \ outlined in [Deutsch96] or the use of a software library may be\n   preferable.\
    \  Since IPComp is a stateless protocol, history MUST be\n   cleared between packets\
    \ when either compressing or decompressing.\n"
- title: 2.1 Compression
  contents:
  - "2.1 Compression\n   As defined in [IPCOMP], the compression process is determined\
    \ by the\n   IP Compression Association (IPCA).  The IPCA MUST define the DEFLATE\n\
    \   algorithm for the process within this document to take place.\n   The compression\
    \ process entails compressing the data from the IP\n   datagram and placing the\
    \ result after the IPComp header.  For\n   example, compressing a TCP datagram;\n\
    \   Before:  IP TCP ...\n   After:   IP IPCOMP (TCP ...)\n   Please note how everything\
    \ after the IPCOMP header is compressed.\n   DEFLATE allows for a number of compression\
    \ levels ranging from best\n   compression but slow to fast compression.  The\
    \ level that one\n   compresses data is implementation dependant since it is always\n\
    \   compatible with the decompression algorithm.\n"
- title: 2.2 Decompression
  contents:
  - "2.2 Decompression\n   As in the compression process, the IPCA defines the parameters\
    \ and\n   algorithm to utilize for the decompression process.\n   As defined in\
    \ [IPCOMP] the data after the IPComp header is\n   decompressed and replaces the\
    \ IPComp header within the IP header.\n   Decompression using the DEFLATE algorithm\
    \ follows the decompression\n   process defined in [Deutsch96].\n"
- title: 3. Thresholds
  contents:
  - "3. Thresholds\n   As stated in [IPCOMP], compression on small buffers does not\
    \ usually\n   work as well as on fast links since the time it takes to compress\
    \ is\n   slower than the time to transport the data.  Informal tests show that\n\
    \   the average buffer size that produces larger results is around 90\n   bytes.\
    \  Thus implementations SHOULD NOT attempt to compress buffers\n   smaller than\
    \ 90 bytes.\n   Other than a packet size limit, no compressibility test as defined\
    \ in\n   [IPCOMP] is outlined in this document.\n"
- title: 4. IPSec Transform Identifier
  contents:
  - "4. IPSec Transform Identifier\n   [IPDOI] states that the ISAKMP IPCOMP transform\
    \ ID for the DEFLATE\n   compression algorithm is IPCOMP_DEFLATE.  No other ISAKMP\
    \ parameters\n   are required for the IPCOMP DEFLATE algorithm.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   This document does not add any further security\
    \ considerations that\n   [IPCOMP] and [Deutsch96] have already declared.\n"
