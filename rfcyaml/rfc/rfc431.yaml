  - "                    Update on SMFS Login and Logout\n       This document replaces\
    \ RFC 399, which introduced the Login\nand Logout commands for UCSB's SMFS, but\
    \ was incomplete.  RFC 399\nis restated here, followed by a description of the\
    \ nature of the\nresponse elicted by these commands\n       Two new commands have\
    \ been added to UCSB's Simple Minded\nFile System (SMFS).  They are described\
    \ below.\n       Login (LGI)\n       The Login command is the means whereby the\
    \ user identifies\nhimself and specifies the account number to which his use of\
    \ SMFS\nis to be billed.  The user should issue a LGI command directly\nafter\
    \ completing the ICP and before any command referencing a\nfile.  The user name\
    \ and account number specified remain in\neffect until another LGI command is\
    \ issued, a LGO command is\nissued, or the connection is close.\n       At present,\
    \ the use of SMFS is not billed, and therefore\nuse of the accounting command\
    \ is optional.  It is requested,\nhowever, that users and user processes begin\
    \ to use this command\nas soon as possible, since we would like to collect statistics\
    \ on\nSMFS utilization before implementing billing.  Therefore, at\npresent the\
    \ user name can be any name that identifies the user,\nand the account number\
    \ is completely arbitrary.\n       The format of the LGI command is given below.\
    \  Note that\nthe lengths of the fixed-length fields are given in bits.  The op\n\
    code for LGI is decimal 13.\n           8\n       <op code><user name><account\
    \ number>\nThe <user name> and <account number> fields are further divided\nas\
    \ follows:\n          8     8*length\n      <length><user name>\nWhere <length>\
    \ gives the length in 8-bit characters of the <user\nname> or <account number>\
    \ subfield.  The maximum length of <user\nname> is eight characters and of <account\
    \ number> is four\ncharacters.  The <user name> and <account number> fields must\n\
    consist of characters chosen from the same character set as\nfilenames.\n    \
    \    Logout (LGO)\n       The logout command terminates the association between\
    \ the\nuser and the accounting information specified in the last LGI\ncommand\
    \ issued, if any; it does not cause SMFS to close the\nconnection.  The user should\
    \ then issue another LGI command\nbefore attempting any operation referencing\
    \ a file. It is not\nnecessary to issue a LGO command before issuing another LGI\n\
    command, or before closing the connection.\n       Again, at the present time\
    \ the LGO command is optional,\nand does not affect the user's ability to reference\
    \ files.\n       The format of the LGO command is as follows:\n           8\n\
    \       <op code>\nThe op code for LGO is decimal 14.\n        Login and logout\
    \ each elicit, as their only response, an\neight-bit completion code.  Like the\
    \ other SMFS commands, the\ncompletion code is equal to the command's op code\
    \ if the command\nwas successful.  The following error completion codes, given\
    \ in\ndecimal, are currently defined:\n       47      The length of <user name>\
    \ is zero.\n       48      <user name> is too long.\n       49      <user name>\
    \ contains invalid characters.\n       50      The length of <account number>\
    \ is zero.\n       51      <account number> is too long.\n       52      <account\
    \ number> contains invalid characters.\n       53      <user name) specifies an\
    \ invalid user.\n       54      <account number> specifies an invalid account.\n\
