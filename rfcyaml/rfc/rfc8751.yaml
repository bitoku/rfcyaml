  - "Abstract\n   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information\
    \ on\n   the current network state received from the Path Computation Clients\n\
    \   (PCCs), including computed Label Switched Paths (LSPs), reserved\n   resources\
    \ within the network, and pending path computation requests.\n   This information\
    \ may then be considered when computing the path for a\n   new traffic-engineered\

    \ be applied if applicable, via the use of a\n   hierarchical relationship between\
    \ PCEs.\n   Combining the capabilities of stateful PCE and the hierarchical PCE\n\

  - "1.1.  Background\n   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP)\
    \ [RFC5440]\n   provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform\n\
    \   path computations in response to the requests of Path Computation\n   Clients\
    \ (PCCs).\n   A stateful PCE is capable of considering, for the purposes of path\n\
    \   computation, not only the network state in terms of links and nodes\n   (referred\
    \ to as the Traffic Engineering Database or TED) but also the\n   status of active\
    \ services (previously computed paths, and currently\n   reserved resources, stored\
    \ in the Label Switched Paths Database\n   (LSPDB).\n   [RFC8051] describes general\
    \ considerations for a stateful PCE\n   deployment; it also examines its applicability\
    \ and benefits as well\n   as its challenges and limitations through a number\
    \ of use cases.\n   [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide\
    \ stateful\n   control.  For its computations, a stateful PCE has access to not\
    \ only\n   the information carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol\n\
    \   (IGP), but also the set of active paths and their reserved resources.\n  \
    \ The additional state allows the PCE to compute constrained paths\n   while considering\
    \ individual LSPs and their interactions.  [RFC8281]\n   describes the setup,\
    \ maintenance, and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs\n   under the stateful PCE model.\n\
    \   [RFC8231] also describes the active stateful PCE.  The active PCE\n   functionality\
    \ allows a PCE to reroute an existing LSP, make changes\n   to the attributes\
    \ of an existing LSP, or delegate control of specific\n   LSPs to a new PCE.\n\
    \   The ability to compute constrained paths for Traffic Engineering (TE)\n  \
    \ LSPs in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS\n   (GMPLS)\
    \ networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key\n   motivation\
    \ for PCE development.  [RFC6805] describes a Hierarchical\n   PCE (H-PCE) architecture\
    \ that can be used for computing end-to-end\n   paths for interdomain MPLS TE\
    \ and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs).\n   Within the H-PCE architecture [RFC6805],\
    \ the Parent PCE (P-PCE) is\n   used to compute a multidomain path based on the\
    \ domain connectivity\n   information.  A Child PCE (C-PCE) may be responsible\
    \ for a single\n   domain or multiple domains.  The C-PCE is used to compute the\n\
    \   intradomain path based on its domain topology information.\n   This document\
    \ presents general considerations for stateful PCEs, and\n   not stateless PCEs,\
    \ in the hierarchical PCE architecture.  It focuses\n   on the behavior changes\
    \ and additions to the existing stateful PCE\n   mechanisms (including PCE-initiated\
    \ LSP setup and active stateful PCE\n   usage) in the context of networks using\
    \ the H-PCE architecture.\n   In this document, Sections 3.1 and 3.2 focus on\
    \ end-to-end (E2E)\n   interdomain TE LSP.  Section 3.3.1 describes the operations\
    \ for\n   stitching per-domain LSPs.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Use Cases and Applicability of Hierarchical Stateful PCE
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Use Cases and Applicability of Hierarchical Stateful PCE\n   As per [RFC6805],\
    \ in the hierarchical PCE architecture, a P-PCE\n   maintains a domain topology\
    \ map that contains the child domains and\n   their interconnections.  Usually,\
    \ the P-PCE has no information about\n   the content of the child domains.  But,\
    \ if the PCE is applied to the\n   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN)\
    \ [RFC8453] as described\n   in [RFC8637], the Provisioning Network Controller\
    \ (PNC) can provide\n   an abstract topology to the Multi-Domain Service Coordinator\
    \ (MDSC).\n   Thus, the P-PCE in MDSC could be aware of topology information in\n\
    \   much more detail than just the domain topology.\n   In a PCEP session between\
    \ a PCC (ingress) and a C-PCE, the C-PCE acts\n   as per the stateful PCE operations\
    \ described in [RFC8231] and\n   [RFC8281].  The same C-PCE behaves as a PCC on\
    \ the PCEP session\n   towards the P-PCE.  The P-PCE is stateful in nature; thus,\
    \ it\n   maintains the state of the interdomain LSPs that are reported to it.\n\
    \   The interdomain LSP could also be delegated by the C-PCE to the\n   P-PCE,\
    \ so that the P-PCE could update the interdomain path.  The\n   trigger for this\
    \ update could be the LSP state change reported for\n   this LSP or any other\
    \ LSP.  It could also be a change in topology at\n   the P-PCE, such as interdomain\
    \ link status change.  In case of use of\n   stateful H-PCE in ACTN, a change\
    \ in abstract topology learned by the\n   P-PCE could also trigger the update.\
    \  Some other external factors\n   (such as a measurement probe) could also be\
    \ a trigger at the P-PCE.\n   Any such update would require an interdomain path\
    \ recomputation as\n   described in [RFC6805].\n   The end-to-end interdomain\
    \ path computation and setup is described in\n   [RFC6805].  Additionally, a per-domain\
    \ stitched-LSP model is also\n   applicable in a P-PCE initiation model.  Sections\
    \ 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3\n   describe the end-to-end contiguous LSP setup, whereas\
    \ Section 3.3.1\n   describes the per-domain stitching.\n"
- title: 1.2.1.  Applicability to ACTN
  contents:
  - "1.2.1.  Applicability to ACTN\n   [RFC8453] describes a framework for the Abstraction\
    \ and Control of TE\n   Networks (ACTN), where each Provisioning Network Controller\
    \ (PNC) is\n   equivalent to a C-PCE, and the P-PCE is the Multi-Domain Service\n\
    \   Coordinator (MDSC).  The per-domain stitched LSP is well suited for\n   ACTN\
    \ deployments, as per the hierarchical PCE architecture described\n   in Section\
    \ 3.3.1 of this document and Section 4.1 of [RFC8453].\n   [RFC8637] examines\
    \ the applicability of PCE to the ACTN framework.\n   To support the function\
    \ of multidomain coordination via hierarchy,\n   the hierarchy of stateful PCEs\
    \ plays a crucial role.\n   In the ACTN framework, a Customer Network Controller\
    \ (CNC) can\n   request the MDSC to check whether there is a possibility to meet\n\
    \   Virtual Network (VN) requirements before requesting that the VN be\n   provisioned.\
    \  The H-PCE architecture as described in [RFC6805] can\n   support this function\
    \ using Path Computation Request and Reply (PCReq\n   and PCRep, respectively)\
    \ messages between the P-PCE and C-PCEs.  When\n   the CNC requests VN provisioning,\
    \ the MDSC decomposes this request\n   into multiple interdomain LSP provisioning\
    \ requests, which might be\n   further decomposed into per-domain path segments.\
    \  This is described\n   in Section 3.3.1.  The MDSC uses the LSP initiate request\n\
    \   (PCInitiate) message from the P-PCE towards the C-PCE, and the C-PCE\n   reports\
    \ the state back to the P-PCE via a Path Computation State\n   Report (PCRpt)\
    \ message.  The P-PCE could make changes to the LSP via\n   the use of a Path\
    \ Computation Update Request (PCUpd) message.\n   In this case, the P-PCE (as\
    \ MDSC) interacts with multiple C-PCEs (as\n   PNCs) along the interdomain path\
    \ of the LSP.\n"
- title: 1.2.2.  End-to-End Contiguous LSP
  contents:
  - "1.2.2.  End-to-End Contiguous LSP\n   Different signaling options for interdomain\
    \ RSVP-TE are identified in\n   [RFC4726].  Contiguous LSPs are achieved using\
    \ the procedures of\n   [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to create a single end-to-end\
    \ LSP that spans\n   all domains.  [RFC6805] describes the technique for establishing\
    \ the\n   optimum path when the sequence of domains is not known in advance.\n\
    \   That document shows how the PCE architecture can be extended to allow\n  \
    \ the optimum sequence of domains to be selected and the optimum end-\n   to-end\
    \ path to be derived.\n   A stateful P-PCE has to be aware of the interdomain\
    \ LSPs for it to\n   consider them during path computation.  For instance, when\
    \ a domain-\n   diverse path is required from another LSP, the P-PCE needs to\
    \ be\n   aware of the LSP.  This is the passive stateful P-PCE, as described\n\
    \   in Section 3.1.  Additionally, the interdomain LSP could be delegated\n  \
    \ to the P-PCE, so that P-PCE could trigger an update via a PCUpd\n   message.\
    \  The update could be triggered on receipt of the PCRpt\n   message that indicates\
    \ a status change of this LSP or some other LSP.\n   The other LSP could be an\
    \ associated LSP (such as a protection LSP\n   [RFC8745]) or an unrelated LSP\
    \ whose resource change leads to\n   reoptimization at the P-PCE.  This is the\
    \ active stateful operation,\n   as described in Section 3.2.  Further, the P-PCE\
    \ could be instructed\n   to create an interdomain LSP on its own using the PCInitiate\
    \ message\n   for an E2E contiguous LSP.  The P-PCE would send the PCInitiate\n\
    \   message to the ingress domain C-PCE, which would further instruct the\n  \
    \ ingress PCC.\n   In this document, for the contiguous LSP, the above interactions\
    \ are\n   only between the ingress domain C-PCE and the P-PCE.  The use of\n \
    \  stateful operations for an interdomain LSP between the transit/egress\n   domain\
    \ C-PCEs and the P-PCE is out of the scope of this document.\n"

    \ for a stateful PCE\n   deployment and examines its applicability and benefits,\

    \  These\n   are also applicable to the stateful P-PCE when used for the\n   interdomain\

    \ P-PCE has limited direct visibility inside the\n   child domain, it could still\
    \ trigger reoptimization with the help of\n   child PCEs based on LSP state changes,\
    \ abstract topology changes, or\n   some other external factors.\n   The C-PCE\
    \ would delegate control of the interdomain LSP to the P-PCE\n   so that the P-PCE\

- title: 3.  Hierarchical Stateful PCE
  contents:
  - "3.  Hierarchical Stateful PCE\n   As described in [RFC6805], in the hierarchical\
    \ PCE architecture, a\n   P-PCE maintains a domain topology map that contains\
    \ the child domains\n   (seen as vertices in the topology) and their interconnections\
    \ (links\n   in the topology).  Usually, the P-PCE has no information about the\n\
    \   content of the child domains.  Each child domain has at least one PCE\n  \
    \ capable of computing paths across the domain.  These PCEs are known\n   as Child\
    \ PCEs (C-PCEs) [RFC6805] and have a direct relationship with\n   the P-PCE. \
    \ The P-PCE builds the domain topology map either via\n   direct configuration\
    \ or from learned information received from each\n   C-PCE.  The network policy\
    \ could be applied while building the domain\n   topology map.  This has been\
    \ described in detail in [RFC6805].\n   Note that, in the scope of this document,\
    \ both the C-PCEs and the\n   P-PCE are stateful in nature.\n   [RFC8231] specifies\
    \ new functions to support a stateful PCE.  It also\n   specifies that a function\
    \ can be initiated either from a PCC towards\n   a PCE (C-E) or from a PCE towards\
    \ a PCC (E-C).\n   This document extends these functions to support H-PCE Architecture\n\
    \   from a C-PCE towards P-PCE (EC-EP) or from a P-PCE towards C-PCE (EP-\n  \
    \ EC).  All PCE types herein (EC-EP and EP-EC) are assumed to be\n   \"stateful\
    \ PCE\".\n   A number of interactions are expected in the hierarchical stateful\n\
    \   PCE architecture.  These include:\n   LSP State Report (EC-EP):  A child stateful\
    \ PCE sends an LSP state\n      report to a parent stateful PCE to indicate the\
    \ state of an LSP.\n   LSP State Synchronization (EC-EP):  After the session between\
    \ the\n      child and parent stateful PCEs is initialized, the P-PCE must\n \
    \     learn the state of the C-PCE's TE LSPs.\n   LSP Control Delegation (EC-EP,\
    \ EP-EC):  A C-PCE grants to the P-PCE\n      the right to update LSP attributes\
    \ on one or more LSPs; at any\n      time, the C-PCE may withdraw the delegation\
    \ or the P-PCE may give\n      up the delegation.\n   LSP Update Request (EP-EC):\
    \  A stateful P-PCE requests modification\n      of attributes on a C-PCE's TE\
    \ LSP.\n   PCE LSP Initiation Request (EP-EC):  A stateful P-PCE requests a\n\
    \      C-PCE to initiate a TE LSP.\n   Note that this hierarchy is recursive,\
    \ so a Label Switching Router\n   (LSR), as a PCC, could delegate control to a\
    \ PCE.  That PCE may, in\n   turn, delegate to its parent, which may further delegate\
    \ to its\n   parent (if it exists).  Similarly, update operations can also be\n\
    \   applied recursively.\n   [RFC8685] defines the H-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV that is\
    \ used in the Open\n   message to advertise the H-PCE capability.  [RFC8231] defines\
    \ the\n   STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV used in the Open message to indicate\n \
    \  stateful support.  To indicate the support for stateful H-PCE\n   operations\
    \ described in this document, a PCEP speaker MUST include\n   both TLVs in an\
    \ Open message.  It is RECOMMENDED that any\n   implementation that supports stateful\
    \ operations [RFC8231] and H-PCE\n   [RFC8685] also implement the stateful H-PCE\
    \ operations as described\n   in this document.\n   Further consideration may\
    \ be made for optional procedures for\n   stateful communication coordination\
    \ between PCEs, including\n   procedures to minimize computational loops.  The\
    \ procedures described\n   in [PCE-STATE-SYNC] facilitate stateful communication\
    \ between PCEs\n   for various use cases.  The procedures and extensions as described\
    \ in\n   Section 3 of [PCE-STATE-SYNC] are also applicable to child and parent\n\
    \   PCE communication.  The SPEAKER-IDENTITY-ID TLV (defined in\n   [RFC8232])\
    \ is included in the LSP object to identify the ingress\n   (PCC).  The PCEP-specific\
    \ identifier for the LSP (PLSP-ID [RFC8231])\n   used in the forwarded PCRpt by\
    \ the C-PCE to the P-PCE is the same as\n   the original one used by the PCC.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Passive Operations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Passive Operations\n   Procedures described in [RFC6805] are applied, where\
    \ the ingress PCC\n   triggers a path computation request for the destination\
    \ towards the\n   C-PCE in the domain where the LSP originates.  The C-PCE further\n\
    \   forwards the request to the P-PCE.  The P-PCE selects a set of\n   candidate\
    \ domain paths based on the domain topology and the state of\n   the interdomain\
    \ links.  It then sends computation requests to the\n   C-PCEs responsible for\
    \ each of the domains on the candidate domain\n   paths.  Each C-PCE computes\
    \ a set of candidate path segments across\n   its domain and sends the results\
    \ to the P-PCE.  The P-PCE uses this\n   information to select path segments and\
    \ concatenate them to derive\n   the optimal end-to-end interdomain path.  The\
    \ end-to-end path is then\n   sent to the C-PCE that received the initial path\
    \ request, and this\n   C-PCE passes the path on to the PCC that issued the original\
    \ request.\n   As per [RFC8231], the PCC sends an LSP State Report carried on\
    \ a\n   PCRpt message to the C-PCE, indicating the LSP's status.  The C-PCE\n\
    \   may further propagate the State Report to the P-PCE.  A local policy\n   at\
    \ the C-PCE may dictate which LSPs are reported to the P-PCE.  The\n   PCRpt message\
    \ is sent from C-PCE to P-PCE.\n   State synchronization mechanisms as described\
    \ in [RFC8231] and\n   [RFC8232] are applicable to a PCEP session between C-PCE\
    \ and P-PCE as\n   well.\n   We use the hierarchical domain topology example from\

- title: 3.2.  Active Operations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Active Operations\n   [RFC8231] describes the case of an active stateful\
    \ PCE.  The active\n   PCE functionality uses two specific PCEP messages:\n  \
    \ *  Update Request (PCUpd)\n   *  State Report (PCRpt)\n   The first is sent\
    \ by the PCE to a PCC for modifying LSP attributes.\n   The PCC sends back a PCRpt\
    \ to acknowledge the requested operation or\n   report any change in the LSP's\
    \ state.\n   As per [RFC8051], delegation is an operation to grant a PCE temporary\n\
    \   rights to modify a subset of LSP parameters on the LSPs of one or\n   more\
    \ PCCs.  The C-PCE may further choose to delegate to its P-PCE\n   based on a\
    \ local policy.  The PCRpt message with the \"D\" (delegate)\n   flag is sent\
    \ from C-PCE to P-PCE.\n   To update an LSP, a PCE sends an LSP Update Request\
    \ to the PCC using\n   a PCUpd message.  For an LSP delegated to a P-PCE via the\
    \ C-PCE, the\n   P-PCE can use the same PCUpd message to request a change to the\
    \ C-PCE\n   (the ingress domain PCE).  The C-PCE further propagates the update\n\
    \   request to the PCC.\n   The P-PCE uses the same mechanism described in Section\
    \ 3.1 to compute\n   the end-to-end path using PCReq and PCRep messages.\n   For\
    \ active operations, the following steps are required when\n   delegating the\
    \ LSP, again using the reference architecture described\n   in Figure 1 (\"Hierarchical\
    \ Domain Topology Example\").\n   (A)  The ingress LSR delegates the LSP to PCE1\
    \ via a PCRpt message\n        with D flag set.\n   (B)  PCE1 further delegates\
    \ the LSP to the P-PCE (PCE5).\n   (C)  Steps 4 to 10 in Section 4.6.2 of [RFC6805]\
    \ are executed at\n        P-PCE (PCE5) to determine the end-to-end path.\n  \

  contents:
  - "3.3.  PCE Initiation of LSPs\n   [RFC8281] describes the setup, maintenance,\
    \ and teardown of PCE-\n   initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model, without\
    \ the need for\n   local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic\
    \ network\n   that is centrally controlled and deployed.  To instantiate or delete\n\
    \   an LSP, the PCE sends the Path Computation LSP initiate request\n   (PCInitiate)\
    \ message to the PCC.  In the case of an interdomain LSP\n   in hierarchical PCE\
    \ architecture, the initiation operations can be\n   carried out at the P-PCE.\
    \  In that case, after the P-PCE finishes the\n   E2E path computation, it can\
    \ send the PCInitiate message to the C-PCE\n   (the ingress domain PCE), and the\
    \ C-PCE further propagates the\n   initiate request to the PCC.\n   The following\

    \ architecture described in Figure 1 (\"Hierarchical\n   Domain Topology Example\"\

- title: 3.3.1.  Per-Domain Stitched LSP
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Per-Domain Stitched LSP\n   The hierarchical PCE architecture, as per\
    \ [RFC6805], is primarily\n   used for E2E LSP.  With PCE-initiated capability,\
    \ another mode of\n   operation is possible, where multiple intradomain LSPs are\
    \ initiated\n   in each domain and are further stitched to form an E2E LSP.  The\n\
    \   P-PCE sends PCInitiate message to each C-PCE separately to initiate\n   individual\
    \ LSP segments along the domain path.  These individual per-\n   domain LSPs are\
    \ stitched together by some mechanism, which is out of\n   the scope of this document\
    \ (Refer to [STATEFUL-INTERDOMAIN]).\n   The following steps are performed for\
    \ the per-domain stitched LSP\n   operation, again using the reference architecture\
    \ described in\n   Figure 1 (\"Hierarchical Domain Topology Example\"):\n   (A)\
    \  The P-PCE (PCE5) is requested to initiate an LSP.  Steps 4 to 10\n        in\
    \ Section 4.6.2 of [RFC6805] are executed to determine the end-\n        to-end\
    \ path, which is broken into per-domain LSPs.  For example:\n        *  S-BN41\n\
    \        *  BN41-BN33\n        *  BN33-D\n   It should be noted that the P-PCE\
    \ may use other mechanisms to\n   determine the suitable per-domain LSPs (apart\
    \ from [RFC6805]).\n   For LSP (BN33-D):\n   (B)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate\
    \ request to the child PCE\n        (PCE3) via a PCInitiate message for the LSP\
    \ (BN33-D).\n   (C)  PCE3 further propagates the initiate message to BN33.\n \
    \  (D)  BN33 initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path and reports\n    \
    \    to PCE3 the LSP status (\"GOING-UP\").\n   (E)  PCE3 further reports the\

    \  The node BN41 notifies PCE4 of the LSP state when the state is\n        \"\
    UP\".\n   (M)  PCE4 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE (PCE5).\n\
    \   For LSP (S-BN41):\n   (N)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate request to\

    \   (O)  PCE1 further propagates the initiate message to node S.\n   (P)  S initiates\
    \ the setup of the LSP as per the path and reports to\n        PCE1 the LSP status\
    \ (\"GOING-UP\").\n   (Q)  PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE\
    \ (PCE5).\n   (R)  The node S notifies PCE1 of the LSP state when the state is\n\
    \        \"UP\".\n   (S)  PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE\
    \ (PCE5).\n   Additionally:\n   (T)  Once the P-PCE receives a report of each\
    \ per-domain LSP, it\n        should use a suitable stitching mechanism, which\
    \ is out of the\n        scope of this document.  In this step, the P-PCE (PCE5)\
    \ could\n        also initiate an E2E LSP (S-D) by sending the PCInitiate message\n\
    \        to the ingress C-PCE (PCE1).\n   Note that each per-domain LSP can be\
    \ set up in parallel.  Further, it\n   is also possible to stitch the per-domain\
    \ LSP at the same time as the\n   per-domain LSPs are initiated.  This option\
    \ is defined in\n   [STATEFUL-INTERDOMAIN].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations listed in [RFC8231],\
    \ [RFC6805], and\n   [RFC5440] apply to this document, as well.  As per [RFC6805],\
    \ it is\n   expected that the parent PCE will require all child PCEs to use full\n\
    \   security (i.e., the highest security mechanism available for PCEP)\n   when\
    \ communicating with the parent.\n   Any multidomain operation necessarily involves\
    \ the exchange of\n   information across domain boundaries.  This is bound to\
    \ represent a\n   significant security and confidentiality risk, especially when\
    \ the\n   child domains are controlled by different commercial concerns.  PCEP\n\
    \   allows individual PCEs to maintain the confidentiality of their\n   domain-path\
    \ information using path-keys [RFC5520], and the\n   hierarchical PCE architecture\
    \ is specifically designed to enable as\n   much isolation of information about\
    \ domain topology and capabilities\n   as is possible.  The LSP state in the PCRpt\
    \ message must continue to\n   maintain the internal domain confidentiality when\
    \ required.\n   The security considerations for PCE-initiated LSP in [RFC8281]\
    \ are\n   also applicable from P-PCE to C-PCE.\n   Further, Section 6.3 describes\
    \ the use of a path-key [RFC5520] for\n   confidentiality between C-PCE and P-PCE.\n\
    \   Thus, it is RECOMMENDED to secure the PCEP session (between the P-PCE\n  \
    \ and the C-PCE) using Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8446] (per\n   the recommendations\
    \ and best current practices in BCP 195 [RFC7525])\n   and/or TCP Authentication\
    \ Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925].  The guidance\n   for implementing PCEP with TLS\
    \ can be found in [RFC8253].\n   In the case of TLS, due care needs to be taken\
    \ while exposing the\n   parameters of the X.509 certificate -- such as\n   subjectAltName:otherName,\
    \ which is set to Speaker Entity Identifier\n   [RFC8232] as per [RFC8253] --\
