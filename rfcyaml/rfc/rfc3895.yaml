    \    it as a supported ifType.\n   (15) Textual Conventions for statistics objects\
    \ have been used.\n   (16) A new object, dsx1LoopbackStatus has been introduced\
    \ to reflect\n        the loopbacks established on a DS1 interface and the source\
    \ to\n        the requests.  dsx1LoopbackConfig continues to be the desired\n\
    \        loopback state while dsx1LoopbackStatus reflects the actual\n       \
    \ state.\n   (17) A dual loopback has been added to allow the setting of an inward\n\
    \        loopback and a line loopback at the same time.\n   (18) An object indicating\
    \ which channel to use within a parent object\n        (i.e., DS3) has been added.\n\
    \   (19) An object has been added to indicate whether or not this DS1/E1\n   \

  - "2.  Overview\n   These objects are used when the particular media being used\
    \ to\n   realize an interface is a DS1/E1/DS2/E2 interface.  At present, this\n\
    \   applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-\n   standard\
    \ MIB:\n      ds1 (18)\n   The definitions contained herein are based on the AT&T\
    \ T-1 Superframe\n   (a.k.a., D4) [ANSI-T1.107] and Extended Superframe (ESF)\
    \ formats\n   [AT&T-UM-305] [AT&T-TR-54016], the latter of which conforms to ANSI\n\
    \   specification [ANSI-T1.403], and the CCITT Recommendations\n   [CCITT-G.703]\
    \ [ITU-T-G.704], referred to as E1 for the rest of this\n   memo.\n   The various\
    \ DS1 and E1 line disciplines are similar enough that\n   separate MIBs are unwarranted,\
    \ although there are some differences.\n   For example, Loss of Frame is defined\
    \ more rigorously in the ESF\n   specification than in the D4 specification, but\
    \ it is defined in\n   both.  Therefore, interface types e1(19) and g703at2mb(67)\
    \ have been\n   obsoleted.\n   Where it is necessary to distinguish between the\
    \ flavors of E1 with\n   and without CRC, E1-CRC denotes the \"with CRC\" form\
    \ (G.704 Table 4b)\n   and E1-noCRC denotes the \"without CRC\" form (G.704 Table\

  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Usage of ifStackTable for Routers and DSUs\n   The object dsx1IfIndex\
    \ has been deprecated.  This object previously\n   allowed a very special proxy\
    \ situation to exist for Routers and CSUs.\n   This section now describes how\
    \ to use ifStackTable to represent this\n   relationship.\n   The paragraphs discussing\
    \ dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex have been\n   preserved in Appendix A for informational\
    \ purposes.\n   The ifStackTable is used in the proxy case to represent the\n\
    \   association between pairs of interfaces, e.g., this T1 is attached to\n  \
    \ that T1.  This use is consistent with the use of the ifStackTable to\n   show\
    \ the association between various sub-layers of an interface.  In\n   both cases\
    \ entire PDUs are exchanged between the interface pairs - in\n   the case of a\
    \ T1, entire T1 frames are exchanged; in the case of PPP\n   and HDLC, entire\
    \ HDLC frames are exchanged.  This usage is not meant\n   to suggest the use of\
    \ the ifStackTable to represent Time Division\n   Multiplexing (TDM) connections\
    \ in general.\n   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agent resides\
    \ on a\n   host external from the device supporting DS1 interfaces (e.g., a\n\
    \   router).  The Agent represents both the host and the DS1 device.\n   Example:\n\
    \   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router.  An SNMP Agent residing\n   on\
    \ the router proxies for itself and the CSU.  The router has also an\n   Ethernet\

  - "2.2.5.  Usage of Loopbacks\n   This section discusses the behaviour of objects\
    \ related to loopbacks.\n   The object dsx1LoopbackConfig represents the desired\
    \ state of\n   loopbacks on this interface.  Using this object a Manager can\n\
    \   request:\n      LineLoopback\n      PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)\n   \
    \   InwardLoopback\n      DualLoopback (Line + Inward)\n      NoLoopback\n   The\
    \ remote end can also request loopbacks either through the FDL\n   channel if\
    \ ESF or inband if D4.  The loopbacks that can be requested\n   this way are:\n\
    \      LineLoopback\n      PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)\n      NoLoopback\n\
    \   To model the current state of loopbacks on a DS1 interface, the\n   object\
    \ dsx1LoopbackStatus defines which loopback is currently applied\n   to an interface.\
    \  This objects, which is a bitmap, will have bits\n   turned on which reflect\
    \ the currently active loopbacks on the\n   interface as well as the source of\
    \ those loopbacks.\n   The following restrictions/rules apply to loopbacks:\n\
    \   The far end cannot undo loopbacks set by a manager.\n   A manager can undo\
    \ loopbacks set by the far end.\n   Both a line loopback and an inward loopback\
    \ can be set at the same\n   time.  Only these two loopbacks can co-exist and\
    \ either one may be\n   set by the manager or the far end.  A LineLoopback request\
    \ from the\n   far end is incremental to an existing Inward loopback established\
    \ by\n   a manager.  When a NoLoopback is received from the far end in this\n\
    \   case, the InwardLoopback remains in place.\n"

  - "2.4.1.  Error Events\n   Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error Event\n        A BPV error\
    \ event for an AMI-coded signal is the occurrence of a\n        pulse of the same\
    \ polarity as the previous pulse (See T1.231\n        Section 6.1.1.1.1).  A BPV\
    \ error event for a B8ZS- or HDB3-coded\n        signal is the occurrence of a\
    \ pulse of the same polarity as the\n        previous pulse without being a part\
    \ of the zero substitution\n        code.\n   Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) Error Event\n\
    \        An Excessive Zeroes error event for an AMI-coded signal is the\n    \
    \    occurrence of more than fifteen contiguous zeroes (See T1.231\n        Section\
    \ 6.1.1.1.2).  For a B8ZS coded signal, the defect occurs\n        when more than\
    \ seven contiguous zeroes are detected.\n   Line Coding Violation (LCV) Error\
    \ Event\n        A Line Coding Violation (LCV) is the occurrence of either a\n\
    \        Bipolar Violation (BPV) or Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) Error Event.\n    \
    \    (Also known as CV-L; See T1.231 Section 6.5.1.1.)\n   Path Coding Violation\
    \ (PCV) Error Event\n        A Path Coding Violation error event is a frame synchronization\n\
    \        bit error in the D4 and E1-noCRC formats, or a CRC or frame\n       \
    \ synch. bit error in the ESF and E1-CRC formats.  (Also known as\n        CV-P;\
    \ See T1.231 Section 6.5.2.1.)\n   Controlled Slip (CS) Error Event\n        A\
    \ Controlled Slip is the replication or deletion of the payload\n        bits\
    \ of a DS1 frame (See T1.231 Section 6.1.1.2.3).  A\n        Controlled Slip may\

    \ is the occurrence of a particular density of\n        Framing Error events (See\
    \ T1.231 Section 6.1.2.2.1).\n        For DS1 links, an Out of Frame defect is\
    \ declared when the\n        receiver detects two or more framing errors within\
    \ a 3 msec\n        period for ESF signals and 0.75 msec for D4 signals, or two\
    \ or\n        more errors out of five or fewer consecutive framing-bits.\n   \
    \     For E1 links, an Out Of Frame defect is declared when three\n        consecutive\
    \ frame alignment signals have been received with an\n        error (see G.706\
    \ Section 4.1 [CCITT-G.706]).\n        For DS2 links, an Out of Frame defect is\

    \ are\n        received.  The OOF is cleared when 3 or more consecutive correct\n\
    \        framing patterns are received.\n        Once an Out Of Frame Defect is\
    \ declared, the framer starts\n        searching for a correct framing pattern.\
    \  The Out of Frame\n        defect ends when the signal is in frame.\n      \
    \  In-frame occurs when there are fewer than two frame bit errors\n        within\
    \ 3 msec period for ESF signals and 0.75 msec for D4\n        signals.\n     \
    \   For E1 links, in-frame occurs when a) in frame N the frame\n        alignment\

    \ absent (i.e., bit 2 in TS0 is a one) and c)\n        in frame N+2 the frame\
    \ alignment signal is present and correct.\n        (See G.704 Section 4.1)\n\
    \   Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) Defect\n        For D4 and ESF links, the 'all\

    \ a time equal to or\n        greater than T, where 3 ms <= T <= 75 ms.  The AIS\
    \ is terminated\n        upon observing a signal not meeting the one's density\
    \ or the\n        unframed signal criteria for a period equal to or greater than\
    \ T\n        (See G.775, Section 5.4).\n        For E1 links, the 'all-ones' condition\
    \ is detected at the line\n        interface as a string of 512 bits containing\
    \ fewer than three\n        zero bits (see O.162 [CCITT-O.162] Section 3.3.2).\n\
    \        For DS2 links, the DS2 AIS shall be sent from the NT1 to the\n      \
    \  user to indicate a loss of the 6,312 kbps frame capability on\n        the\
    \ network side.  The DS2 AIS is defined as a bit array of\n        6,312 kbps\
    \ in which all binary bits are set to '1'.\n        The DS2 AIS detection and\
    \ removal shall be implemented according\n        to ITU-T Draft Recommendation\
    \ G.775 [ITU-T-G.775] Section 5.5:\n        - a DS2 AIS defect is detected when\
    \ the incoming signal has\n          two (2) or less ZEROs in a sequence of 3156\
    \ bits (0.5 ms).\n        - a DS2 AIS defect is cleared when the incoming signal\

    \ Available seconds are merely those seconds which are not\n        Unavailable\
    \ as described below.\n   Unavailable Seconds (UAS)\n        Unavailable Seconds\
    \ (UAS) are calculated by counting the number\n        of seconds that the interface\
    \ is unavailable.  The DS1 interface\n        is said to be unavailable from the\
    \ onset of 10 contiguous SESs,\n        or the onset of the condition leading\
    \ to a failure (see Failure\n        States).  If the condition leading to the\
    \ failure was\n        immediately preceded by one or more contiguous SESs, then\
    \ the\n        DS1 interface unavailability starts from the onset of these\n \
    \       SESs.  Once unavailable, and if no failure is present, the DS1\n     \
    \   interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous\n        seconds\
    \ with no SESs.  Once unavailable, and if a failure is\n        present, the DS1\
    \ interface becomes available at the onset of 10\n        contiguous seconds with\
    \ no SESs, if the failure clearing time is\n        less than or equal to 10 seconds.\
    \  If the failure clearing time\n        is more than 10 seconds, the DS1 interface\
    \ becomes available at\n        the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs,\
    \ or the onset\n        period leading to the successful clearing condition, whichever\n\
    \        occurs later.  With respect to the DS1 error counts, all\n        counters\
    \ are incremented while the DS1 interface is deemed\n        available.  While\
    \ the interface is deemed unavailable, the only\n        count that is incremented\
    \ is UASs.\n        Note that this definition implies that the agent cannot\n\
    \        determine until after a ten second interval has passed whether a\n  \
    \      given one-second interval belongs to available or unavailable\n       \
    \ time.  If the agent chooses to update the various performance\n        statistics\
    \ in real time then it must be prepared to\n        retroactively reduce the ES,\
    \ BES, SES, and SEFS counts by 10 and\n        increase the UAS count by 10 when\
    \ it determines that available\n        time has been entered.  It must also be\
    \ prepared to adjust the\n        PCV count and the DM count as necessary since\
    \ these parameters\n        are not accumulated during unavailable time.  It must\
    \ be\n        similarly prepared to retroactively decrease the UAS count by 10\n\
    \        and increase the ES, BES, and DM counts as necessary upon\n        entering\
    \ available time.  A special case exists when the 10\n        second period leading\
    \ to available or unavailable time crosses a\n        900 second statistics window\
    \ boundary, as the foregoing\n        description implies that the ES, BES, SES,\
    \ SEFS, DM, and UAS\n        counts the PREVIOUS interval must be adjusted.  In\
    \ this case\n        successive GETs of the affected dsx1IntervalSESs and\n  \
    \      dsx1IntervalUASs objects will return differing values if the\n        first\
    \ GET occurs during the first few seconds of the window.\n        The agent may\
    \ instead choose to delay updates to the various\n        statistics by 10 seconds\
    \ in order to avoid retroactive\n        adjustments to the counters.  A way to\
    \ do this is sketched in\n        Appendix B.\n   In any case, a linkDown trap\
    \ shall be sent only after the agent has\n   determined for certain that the unavailable\
    \ state has been entered,\n   but the time on the trap will be that of the first\
    \ UAS (i.e., 10\n   seconds earlier).  A linkUp trap shall be handled similarly.\n\
    \   According to ANSI T1.231 unavailable time begins at the _onset_ of 10\n  \
    \ contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is, unavailable time\n   starts\
    \ with the _first_ of the 10 contiguous SESs.  Also, while an\n   interface is\
    \ deemed unavailable all counters for that interface are\n   frozen except for\
    \ the UAS count.  It follows that an implementation\n   which strictly complies\
    \ with this standard must _not_ increment any\n   counters other than the UAS\
    \ count -- even temporarily -- as a result\n   of anything that happens during\
    \ those 10 seconds.  Since changes in\n   the signal state lag the data to which\
    \ they apply by 10 seconds, an\n   ANSI-compliant implementation must pass the\
    \ one-second statistics\n   through a 10-second delay line prior to updating any\
    \ counters.  That\n   can be done by performing the following steps at the end\
    \ of each one\n   second interval.\n   i)   Read near/far end CV counter and alarm\
    \ status flags from the\n        hardware.\n   ii)  Accumulate the CV counts for\
    \ the preceding second and compare\n        them to the ES and SES threshold for\

    \ CV counts and\n        ES/SES flags into the 10-element delay line.  Note that\

  contents:
  - "2.4.4.  Failure States\n   The following failure states are received, or detected\
    \ failures, that\n   are reported in the dsx1LineStatus object.  When a DS1 interface\n\
    \   would, if ever, produce the conditions leading to the failure state\n   is\
    \ described in the appropriate specification.\n   Far End Alarm Failure\n    \
    \    The Far End Alarm failure is also known as \"Yellow Alarm\" in the\n    \
    \    DS1 case, \"Distant Alarm\" in the E1 case, and \"Remote Alarm\" in\n   \
    \     the DS2 case.\n        For D4 links, the Far End Alarm failure is declared\
    \ when bit 6\n        of all channels has been zero for at least 335 ms and is\
    \ cleared\n        when bit 6 of at least one channel is non-zero for a period\
    \ T,\n        where T is usually less than one second and always less than 5\n\
    \        seconds.  The Far End Alarm failure is not declared for D4 links\n  \
    \      when a Loss of Signal is detected.\n        For ESF links, the Far End\
    \ Alarm failure is declared if the\n        Yellow Alarm signal pattern occurs\
    \ in at least seven out of ten\n        contiguous 16-bit pattern intervals and\
    \ is cleared if the Yellow\n        Alarm signal pattern does not occur in ten\
    \ contiguous 16-bit\n        signal pattern intervals.\n        For E1 links,\
    \ the Far End Alarm failure is declared when bit 3\n        of time-slot zero\
    \ is received set to one on two consecutive\n        occasions.  The Far End Alarm\
    \ failure is cleared when bit 3 of\n        time-slot zero is received set to\
    \ zero.\n        For DS2 links, if a loss of frame alignment (LOF or LOS) and/or\n\
    \        DS2 AIS condition, is detected, the RAI signal shall be\n        generated\
    \ and transmitted to the remote side.\n        The Remote Alarm Indication(RAI)\
    \ signal is defined on m-bits as\n        a repetition of the 16bit sequence consisting\
    \ of eight binary\n        '1s' and eight binary '0s' in m-bits(1111111100000000).\
    \  When\n        the RAI signal is not sent (in normal operation),the HDLC flag\n\
    \        pattern (01111110) in the m-bit is sent.\n        The RAI failure is\
    \ detected when 16 or more consecutive RAI-\n        patterns (1111111100000000)\
    \ are received.  The RAI failure is\n        cleared when 4 or more consecutive\
    \ incorrect-RAI-patterns are\n        received.\n   Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)\
    \ Failure\n        The Alarm Indication Signal failure is declared when an AIS\n\
    \        defect is detected at the input and the  AIS defect still exists\n  \
    \      after the Loss Of Frame failure (which is caused by the unframed\n    \
    \    nature of the 'all-ones' signal) is declared.  The AIS failure\n        is\
    \ cleared when the Loss Of Frame failure is cleared.  (See\n        T1.231 Section\
    \ 6.2.1.2.1)\n        An AIS defect at a 6312 kbit/s (G.704) interface is detected\n\
    \        when the incoming signal has two {2} or less ZEROs in a sequence\n  \
    \      of 3156 bits (0.5ms).  The AIS signal defect is cleared when the\n    \
    \    incoming signal has three {3} or more ZEROs in a sequence of\n        3156\
    \ bits (0.5ms).\n   Loss Of Frame Failure\n        For DS1 links, the Loss Of\
    \ Frame failure is declared when an OOF\n        or LOS  defect has persisted\
    \ for T seconds, where 2 <= T <= 10.\n        The Loss Of Frame failure is cleared\
    \ when there have been no OOF\n        or LOS defects during a period T where\
    \ 0 <= T <= 20.  Many\n        systems will perform \"hit integration\" within\
    \ the period T\n        before declaring or clearing the failure e.g., see TR\
    \ 62411\n        [AT&T-TR-62411].\n        For E1 links, the Loss Of Frame Failure\
    \ is declared when an OOF\n        defect is detected.\n   Loss Of Signal Failure\n\
    \        For DS1, the Loss Of Signal failure is declared upon observing\n    \
    \    175 +/- 75 contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either\n        positive\
    \ or negative polarity.  The LOS failure is cleared upon\n        observing an\
    \ average pulse density of at least 12.5% over a\n        period of 175 +/- 75\
    \ contiguous pulse positions starting with\n        the receipt of a pulse.\n\
    \        For E1 links, the Loss Of Signal failure is declared when\n        greater\
    \ than 10 consecutive zeroes are detected (see O.162\n        Section 3.4.4).\n\
    \        A LOS defect at 6312kbit/s interfaces is detected when the\n        incoming\
    \ signal has \"no transitions\", i.e., when the signal\n        level is less\
    \ than or equal to a signal level of 35dB below\n        nominal, for N consecutive\
    \ pulse intervals, where 10 <=N<=255.\n        The LOS defect is cleared when\
    \ the incoming signal has\n        \"transitions\", i.e., when the signal level\
    \ is greater than or\n        equal to a signal level of 9dB below nominal, for\
    \ N consecutive\n        pulse intervals, where 10<=N<=255.\n        A signal\
    \ with \"transitions\" corresponds to a G.703 compliant\n        signal.\n   Loopback\
    \ Pseudo-Failure\n        The Loopback Pseudo-Failure is declared when the near\
    \ end\n        equipment has placed a loopback (of any kind) on the DS1.  This\n\
    \        allows a management entity to determine from one object whether\n   \
    \     the DS1 can be considered to be in service or not (from the\n        point\
    \ of view of the near end equipment).\n   TS16 Alarm Indication Signal Failure\n\
    \        For E1 links, the TS16 Alarm Indication Signal failure is\n        declared\
    \ when time-slot 16 is received as all ones for all\n        frames of two consecutive\
    \ multiframes (see G.732 Section 4.2.6).\n        This condition is never declared\
    \ for DS1.\n   Loss Of MultiFrame Failure\n        The Loss Of MultiFrame failure\
    \ is declared when two consecutive\n        multiframe alignment signals (bits\
    \ 4 through 7 of TS16 of frame\n        0) have been received with an error. \
    \ The Loss Of Multiframe\n        failure is cleared when the first correct multiframe\
    \ alignment\n        signal is received.  The Loss Of Multiframe failure can only\
    \ be\n        declared for E1 links operating with G.732 [CCITT-G.732] framing\n\
    \        (sometimes called \"Channel Associated Signalling\" mode).\n   Far End\
    \ Loss Of Multiframe Failure\n        The Far End Loss Of Multiframe failure is\
    \ declared when bit 2 of\n        TS16 of frame 0 is received set to one on two\
    \ consecutive\n        occasions.  The Far End Loss Of Multiframe failure is cleared\n\
    \        when bit 2 of TS16 of frame 0 is received set to zero.  The Far\n   \
    \     End Loss Of Multiframe failure can only be declared for E1 links\n     \
    \   operating in \"Channel Associated Signalling\" mode (See G.732).\n   DS2 Payload\
    \ AIS Failure\n        The DS2 Payload AIS is detected when the incoming signal\
    \ of the\n        6,312 kbps frame payload (time-slots 1 through 96) has 2 or\
    \ less\n        0's in a sequence of 3072 bits (0.5ms).  The DS2 Payload AIS is\n\
    \        cleared when the incoming signal of the 6,312 kbps frame payload\n  \
    \      has 3 or more 0's in a sequence of 3072 bits (0.5 ms).\n   DS2 Performance\
    \ Threshold\n        DS2 Performance Threshold Failure monitors equipment performance\n\
    \        and is based on the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) Procedure\n       \
    \ defined in G.704.\n        The DS2 Performance Threshold Failure is detected\
    \ when the bit\n        error ratio exceeds 10^-4 (Performance Threshold), and\
    \ the DS2\n        Performance Threshold Failure shall be cleared when the bit\n\
    \        error ratio decreased to less than 10^-6.\"\n"

    \    The table was mandatory for systems dividing a DS1\n            into channels\

    \ Systems which are\n            indifferent to data content, such as CSUs, need\n\

    \ which DS1\n            channels associated with a CSU are being used to\n  \
    \          support a logical interface, i.e., an entry in the\n            interfaces\

    \ second H1 for data to a primary routing peer,\n            and 12 64 kbit/s\
    \ H0 _B_ Channels. Consider that\n            some subset of the H0 channels are\
    \ used for voice\n            and the remainder are available for dynamic data\n\
    \            calls.\n            We count a total of 14 interfaces multiplexed\
    \ onto\n            the DS1 interface. Six DS1 channels (for the sake\n      \
    \      of the example, channels 1..6) are used for Video,\n            six more\
    \ (7..11 and 13) are used for data, and the\n            remaining 12 are in channels\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects\
    \ may be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  The\n   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n\
    \   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  The\n   specific\
    \ objects and their sensitivities/vulnerabilities are as\n   follows.\n   Setting\
    \ the following objects to incorrect values may result in\n   traffic interruptions:\n\
    \      dsx1LineType\n      dsx1LineCoding\n      dsx1SendCode\n      dsx1LoopbackConfig\n\
    \      dsx1SignalMode\n      dsx1TransmitClockSource\n      dsx1Fdl\n      dsx1LineLength\n\
    \      dsx1Channelization\n      dsx1LineMode\n      dsx1LineBuildOut\n   In the\
    \ case of dsx1LineType, for example, both ends of a DS1/E1 must\n   have the same\
    \ value in order for traffic to flow.  In the case of\n   dsx1SendCode and dsx1LoopbackConfig,\
    \ for another example, traffic may\n   stop transmitting when particular loopbacks\
    \ are applied.\n   Setting the following object to an incorrect value will not\
    \ harm the\n   traffic, but it may cause a circuit to be mis-identified and thereby\n\
    \   create difficulties for service personnel when attempting to\n   troubleshoot\
    \ a problem:\n      dsx1CircuitIdentifier\n   Setting the following object can\
    \ cause an increase in the number of\n   traps received by the network management\
    \ station:\n      dsx1LineStatusChangeTrapEnable\n   The readable objects in this\
    \ MIB module (i.e., the objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)\
    \ may be considered sensitive in\n   some environments since, collectively, they\
    \ provide extensive\n   information about the performance of interfaces in DS1/E1/DS2/E2\n\
    \   equipment or networks and can reveal some aspects of their\n   configuration.\
    \  In such environments, it is important to control even\n   GET and NOTIFY access\
    \ to these objects and possibly to encrypt the\n   values of these objects when\
    \ sending them over the network via SNMP.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did\
    \ not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for\
    \ example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the\
    \ secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"

- title: Appendix A - Use of dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex
  contents:
  - "Appendix A - Use of dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex\n   This Appendix exists to\
    \ document the previous use if dsx1IfIndex and\n   dsx1LineIndex and to clarify\
    \ the relationship of dsx1LineIndex as\n   defined in RFC 1406 with the dsx1LineIndex\
    \ as defined in this\n   document.\n   The following shows the old and new definitions\
    \ and the relationship:\n   [New Definition]: \"This object should be made equal\
    \ to ifIndex.  The\n   next paragraph describes its previous usage.  Making the\
    \ object equal\n   to ifIndex allows proper use of ifStackTable and ds0/ds0bundle\
    \ mibs.\n   [Old Definition]: \"This object is the identifier of a DS1 Interface\n\
    \   on a managed device.  If there is an ifEntry that is directly\n   associated\
    \ with this and only this DS1 interface, it should have the\n   same value as\
    \ ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the dsx1LineIndices with an\n   unique identifier\
    \ following the rules of choosing a number that is\n   greater than ifNumber and\
    \ numbering the inside interfaces (e.g.,\n   equipment side) with even numbers\
    \ and outside interfaces (e.g.,\n   network side) with odd numbers.\"\n   When\
    \ the \"Old Definition\" was created, it was described this way to\n   allow a\
    \ manager to treat the value _as if_ it were and ifIndex, i.e.,\n   the value\
    \ would either be: 1) an ifIndex value or 2) a value that was\n   guaranteed to\
    \ be different from all valid ifIndex values.\n   The new definition is a subset\
    \ of that definition, i.e., the value is\n   always an ifIndex value.\n   The\
    \ following is Section 3.1 from RFC 1406:\n   Different physical configurations\
    \ for the support of SNMP with DS1\n   equipment exist.  To accommodate these\
    \ scenarios, two different\n   indices for DS1 interfaces are introduced in this\
    \ MIB.  These indices\n   are dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex.\n   External interface\
    \ scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed\n   DS1 lines as external interfaces\
    \ (for example, an Agent residing on\n   the device supporting DS1 interfaces\
    \ directly):\n   For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value\
    \ equal\n   to ifIndex, and the following applies:\n      ifIndex=dsx1IfIndex=dsx1LineIndex\
    \ for all interfaces.\n   The dsx1IfIndex column of the DS1 Configuration table\
    \ relates each\n   DS1 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the\n\
    \   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II STD 17, RFC 1213) [RFC1213].\n   External&Internal\
    \ interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an\n   host external from the\
    \ device supporting DS1 interfaces (e.g., a\n   router).  The Agent represents\
    \ both the host and the DS1 device.  The\n   index dsx1LineIndex is used to not\
    \ only represent the DS1 interfaces\n   external from the host/DS1-device combination,\
    \ but also the DS1\n   interfaces connecting the host and the DS1 device.  The\
    \ index\n   dsx1IfIndex is always equal to ifIndex.\n   Example:\n   A shelf full\
    \ of CSUs connected to a Router.  An SNMP Agent residing\n   on the router proxies\
    \ for itself and the CSU.  The router has also an\n   Ethernet interface:\n  \

  - "Appendix B - The delay approach to Unavailable Seconds.\n   This procedure is\
    \ illustrated below for a DS1 ESF interface.  Similar\n   rules would apply for\
    \ other DS1, DS2, and E1 interface variants.  The\n   procedure guarantees that\
    \ the statistical counters are correctly\n   updated at all times, although they\
    \ lag real time by 10 seconds.  At\n   the end of each 15 minutes interval the\
    \ current interval counts are\n   transferred to the most recent interval entry\
    \ and each interval is\n   shifted up by one position, with the oldest being discarded\
    \ if\n   necessary in order to make room.  The current interval counts then\n\
    \   start over from zero.  Note, however, that the signal state\n   calculation\
    \ does not start afresh at each interval boundary;  rather,\n   signal state information\
    \ is retained across interval boundaries.\n"
