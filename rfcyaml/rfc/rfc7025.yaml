  - "1.  Introduction\n   The initial effort of the PCE (Path Computation Element)\
    \ WG focused\n   mainly on solving the path computation problem within a domain\
    \ or\n   over different domains in MPLS networks.  As with MPLS, service\n   providers\
    \ (SPs) have also come up with requirements for path\n   computation in GMPLS-controlled\
    \ networks [RFC3945], such as those\n   based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing\
    \ (WDM), Time Division\n   Multiplexing (TDM), or Ethernet.\n   [RFC4655] and\
    \ [RFC4657] discuss the framework and requirements for\n   PCE on both packet\
    \ MPLS networks and GMPLS-controlled networks.  This\n   document complements\
    \ those RFCs by providing considerations of GMPLS\n   applications in the intradomain\
    \ and interdomain networking\n   environments and indicating a set of requirements\
    \ for the extended\n   definition of PCE-related protocols.\n   Note that the\
    \ requirements for interlayer and inter-area traffic\n   engineering (TE) described\
    \ in [RFC6457] and [RFC4927] are outside of\n   the scope of this document.\n\
    \   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) computation within a domain or\n  \
    \ over domains for signaling GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is\n   usually\
    \ more stringent than that of MPLS TE LSPs [RFC4216], because\n   the additional\
    \ constraints, e.g., interface switching capability,\n   link encoding, link protection\
    \ capability, Shared Risk Link Group\n   (SRLG) [RFC4202], and so forth, need\
    \ to be considered to establish\n   GMPLS LSPs.  The GMPLS signaling protocol\
    \ [RFC3473] is designed\n   taking into account bidirectionality, switching type,\
    \ encoding type,\n   and protection attributes of the TE links spanned by the\
    \ path, as\n   well as LSP encoding and switching type of the endpoints,\n   appropriately.\n\
    \   This document provides requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in\n   support\
    \ of GMPLS path computation, included are requirements for both\n   intradomain\
    \ and interdomain environments.\n"

    \ Figure 1: Path Computation in GMPLS Networks\n   For the simplicity in consideration,\
    \ the following basic assumptions\n   are made when the LSP is created.\n   (1)\
    \  Switching capabilities of outgoing links from the ingress and\n        egress\
    \ nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure 1) are consistent\n        with each other.\n\
    \   (2)  Switching capabilities of all transit links, including incoming\n   \
    \     links to the ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) are\n      \
    \  consistent with switching type of an LSP to be created.\n   (3)  Encoding types\
    \ of all transit links are consistent with the\n        encoding type of an LSP\
    \ to be created.\n   GMPLS-controlled networks (e.g., GMPLS-based TDM networks)\
    \ are\n   usually responsible for transmitting data for the client layer.\n  \
    \ These GMPLS-controlled networks can provide different types of\n   connections\

    \         Figure 2: A Simple TDM (SDH) Network\n   Figure 2 shows a simple TDM\
    \ (SDH) network topology, where N1, N2, N3,\n   N4, and N5 are all SDH switches;\
    \ A1 and A2 are client devices (e.g.,\n   Ethernet switches).  Assume that one\
    \ Ethernet service with 100 Mbit/s\n   bandwidth is required from A1 to A2 over\
    \ this network.  The client\n   Ethernet service could be provided by a Virtual\
    \ Container 4 (VC-4)\n   container from N1 to N4; it could also be provided by\
    \ three\n   concatenated VC-3s (contiguous or virtual concatenation) from N1 to\n\
    \   N4.\n   In this scenario, when the ingress node (e.g., N1) receives a client\n\
    \   service transmitting request, the type of containers (one VC-4 or\n   three\
    \ concatenated VC-3s) could be determined by the PCC (Path\n   Computation Client),\
    \ e.g., N1 or Network Management System (NMS).\n   However, it could also be determined\
    \ automatically by the PCE based\n   on policy [RFC5394].  If it is determined\
    \ by the PCC, then the PCC\n   should be capable of specifying the ingress node\
    \ and egress node,\n   signal type, the type of the concatenation, and the number\
    \ of the\n   concatenation in a PCReq (Path Computation Request) message.  The\
    \ PCE\n   should consider those parameters during path computation.  The route\n\
    \   information (co-routing or diverse routing) should be specified in a\n   PCRep\
    \ (Path Computation Reply) message if path computation is\n   performed successfully.\n\
    \   As described above, the PCC should be capable of specifying TE\n   attributes\
    \ defined in the next section, and the PCE should compute a\n   path accordingly.\n\
    \   Where a GMPLS network consists of interdomain (e.g., inter-AS or\n   inter-area)\
    \ GMPLS-controlled networks, requirements on the path\n   computation follow [RFC5376]\
    \ and [RFC4726].\n"

  contents:

    \ of\n   numbered links and unnumbered links, or a P2MP (Point-to-Multipoint)\n\

    \ a path for the\n   bidirectional LSP with asymmetric bandwidth.  This means\
    \ that the PCC\n   should be able to indicate the asymmetric bandwidth requirements\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Requirements on Path Computation Request\n   As for path computation in\
    \ GMPLS-controlled networks as discussed in\n   Section 2, the PCE should appropriately\
    \ consider the GMPLS TE\n   attributes listed below once a PCC or another PCE\
    \ requests a path\n   computation.  The path calculation request message from\
    \ the PCC or\n   the PCE must contain the information specifying appropriate\n\
    \   attributes.  According to [RFC5440], [PCE-WSON-REQ], and RSVP\n   procedures\
    \ such as explicit label control (ELC), the additional\n   attributes introduced\
    \ are as follows:\n   (1)   Switching capability/type: as defined in [RFC3471],\
    \ [RFC4203],\n         and all current and future values.\n   (2)   Encoding type:\

    \   (3)   Signal type: as defined in [RFC4606] and all current and future\n  \
    \       values.\n   (4)   Concatenation type: In SDH/SONET and OTN, two kinds\
    \ of\n         concatenation modes are defined: contiguous concatenation,\n  \
    \       which requires co-routing for each member signal and that all\n      \
    \   the interfaces along the path support this capability, and\n         virtual\
    \ concatenation, which allows diverse routing for member\n         signals and\
    \ requires that only the ingress and egress\n         interfaces support this\
    \ capability.  Note that for the virtual\n         concatenation, it may also\
    \ specify co-routing or diverse\n         routing.  See [RFC4606] and [RFC4328]\
    \ about concatenation\n         information.\n   (5)   Concatenation number: Indicates\
    \ the number of signals that are\n         requested to be contiguously or virtually\
    \ concatenated.  Also\n         see [RFC4606] and [RFC4328].\n   (6)   Technology-specific\

- title: 3.2.  Requirements on Path Computation Reply
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Requirements on Path Computation Reply\n   As described above, a PCE should\
    \ compute the path that satisfies the\n   constraints specified in the PCReq message.\
    \  Then, the PCE should\n   send a PCRep message, including the computation result,\
    \ to the PCC.\n   For a Path Computation Reply message (PCRep) in GMPLS networks,\
    \ there\n   are some additional requirements.  The PCEP (PCE communication\n \
    \  protocol) PCRep message must be extended to meet the following\n   requirements.\n\
    \   (1)  Path computation with concatenation\n        In the case of path computation\
    \ involving concatenation, when a\n        PCE receives the PCReq message specifying\
    \ the concatenation\n        constraints described in Section 3.1, the PCE should\
    \ compute a\n        path accordingly.\n        For path computation involving\
    \ contiguous concatenation, a\n        single route is required, and all the interfaces\
    \ along the route\n        should support contiguous concatenation capability.\
    \  Therefore,\n        the PCE should compute a path based on the contiguous\n\
    \        concatenation capability of each interface and only one ERO that\n  \
    \      should carry the route information for the response.\n        For path\
    \ computation involving virtual concatenation, only the\n        ingress/egress\
    \ interfaces need to support virtual concatenation\n        capability, and there\
    \ may be diverse routes for the different\n        member signals.  Therefore,\
    \ multiple EROs may be needed for the\n        response.  Each ERO may represent\
    \ the route of one or multiple\n        member signals.  When one ERO represents\
    \ multiple member\n        signals, the number must be specified.\n   (2)  Label\
    \ constraint\n        In the case that a PCC does not specify the exact label(s)\
    \ when\n        requesting a label-restricted path and the PCE is capable of\n\
    \        performing the route computation and label assignment\n        computation\
    \ procedure, the PCE needs to be able to specify the\n        label of the path\
    \ in a PCRep message.\n        Wavelength restriction is a typical case of label\
    \ restriction.\n        More generally, label switching and selection constraints\
    \ may\n        apply in GMPLS-controlled networks, and a PCC may request a PCE\n\
    \        to take label constraint into account and return an ERO\n        containing\
    \ the label or set of labels that fulfill the PCC\n        request.\n   (3)  Roles\
    \ of the routes\n        When a PCC specifies the protection type of an LSP, the\
    \ PCE\n        should compute the working route and the corresponding\n      \
    \  protection route(s).  Therefore, the PCRep should allow to\n        distinguish\
    \ the working (nominal) and the protection routes.\n        According to these\
    \ routes, the RSVP-TE procedure appropriately\n        creates both the working\
    \ and the protection LSPs, for example,\n        with the ASSOCIATION object [RFC6689].\n"
