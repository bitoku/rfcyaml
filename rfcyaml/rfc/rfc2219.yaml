- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   It has become a common practice to use symbolic names (usually\n\
    \   CNAMEs) in the Domain Name Service (DNS - [RFC-1034, RFC-1035]) to\n   refer\
    \ to network services such as anonymous FTP [RFC-959] servers,\n   Gopher [RFC-1436]\
    \ servers, and most notably World-Wide Web HTTP\n   [RFC-1945] servers.  This\
    \ is desirable for a number of reasons.  It\n   provides a way of moving services\
    \ from one machine to another\n   transparently, and a mechanism by which people\
    \ or agents may\n   programmatically discover that an organization runs, say,\
    \ a World-\n   Wide Web server.\n   Although this approach has been almost universally\
    \ adopted, there is\n   no standards document or similar specification for these\
    \ commonly\n   used names.  This document seeks to rectify this situation by\n\
    \   gathering together the extant 'folklore' on naming conventions, and\n   proposes\
    \ a mechanism for accommodating new protocols.\n   It is important to note that\
    \ these naming conventions do not provide\n   a complete long term solution to\
    \ the problem of finding a particular\n   network service for a site.  There are\
    \ efforts in other IETF working\n   groups to address the long term solution to\
    \ this problem, such as the\n   Server Location Resource Records (DNS SRV) [RFC-2052]\
    \ work.\n"
- title: 1. Rationale
  contents:
  - "1. Rationale\n   In order to locate the network services offered at a particular\n\
    \   Internet domain one is faced with the choice of selecting from a\n   growing\
    \ number of centralized databases - typically Web or Usenet\n   News \"wanderers\"\
    , or attempting to infer the existence of network\n   services from whatever DNS\
    \ information may be available.  The former\n   approach is not practical in some\
    \ cases, notably when the entity\n   seeking service information is a program.\n\
    \   Perhaps the most visible example of the latter approach at work is in\n  \
    \ the case of World-Wide Web HTTP servers.  It is common practice to\n   try prefixing\
    \ the domain name of an organization with \"http://www.\"\n   in order to reach\
    \ its World-Wide Web site, e.g. taking \"hivnet.fr\"\n   and arriving at \"http://www.hivnet.fr.\"\
    \  Some popular World-Wide Web\n   browsers have gone so far as to provide automatic\
    \ support for this\n   domain name expansion.\n   Ideally, the DNS or some complementary\
    \ directory service would\n   provide a means for programs to determine automatically\
    \ the network\n   services which are offered at a particular Internet domain,\
    \ the\n   protocols which are used to deliver them, and other technical\n   information.\
    \  Unfortunately, although much work has been done to\n   develop said directory\
    \ service technologies and to define new types\n   of DNS resource record to provide\
    \ this type of information, there is\n   no widely agreed upon or widely deployed\
    \ solution to the problem -\n   except in a small number of cases.\n   The first\
    \ case is where the DNS already provides a lookup capability\n   for the type\
    \ of information being sought after.  For example: Mail\n   Exchanger (MX) records\
    \ specify how mail to a particular domain should\n   be routed [RFC-974], the\
    \ Start of Authority (SOA) records make it\n   possible to determine who is responsible\
    \ for a given domain, and Name\n   Server (NS) records indicate which hosts provide\
    \ DNS name service for\n   a given domain.\n   The second case is where the DNS\
    \ does not provide an appropriate\n   lookup capability, but there is some widely\
    \ accepted convention for\n   finding this information.  Some use has been made\
    \ of Text (TXT)\n   [RFC-1035] records in this scenario, but in the vast majority\
    \ of\n   cases a Canonical Name (CNAME) or Address (A) record pointer is used\n\
    \   to indicate the host or hosts which provide the service.  This\n   document\
    \ proposes a slight formalization of this well-known alias\n   approach.\n   It\
    \ should be noted that the DNS provides a Well Known Services (WKS)\n   [RFC-1035]\
    \ lookup capability, which makes it possible to determine\n   the network services\
    \ offered at a given domain name.  In practice\n   this is not widely used, perhaps\
    \ because of the absence of a suitable\n   programming interface.  Use of WKS\
    \ for mail routing was deprecated in\n   the Host Requirements specification [RFC-1123]\
    \ in favour of the MX\n   record, and in the long term it is conceivable that\
    \ SRV records will\n   supersede both WKS and MX.\n"
- title: 2. A generic framework
  contents:
  - "2. A generic framework\n   Our approach to dealing with aliases for protocols\
    \ is\n   straightforward. We define a standard set of DNS aliases for the most\n\
    \   popular network services that currently exist (see the \"Special\n   Cases\"\
    \ section below). For protocols that are not explicitly listed\n   in this document,\
    \ the protocol specification must propose a name.\n"

- title: 4. (Ab)Use of the DNS as a directory service
  contents:
  - "4. (Ab)Use of the DNS as a directory service\n   The widespread use of these\
    \ common aliases effectively means that it\n   is sometimes possible to \"guess\"\
    \ the domain names associated with an\n   organization's network services, though\
    \ this is becoming more\n   difficult as the number of organizations registered\
    \ in the DNS\n   increases.\n   It should be understood by implementors that the\
    \ existence of a DNS\n   entry such as\n        www.hivnet.fr\n   does not constitute\
    \ a registration of a World-Wide Web service.\n   There is no requirement that\
    \ the domain name resolve to an IP address\n   or addresses.  There is no requirement\
    \ that a host be listening for\n   HTTP connections, or if it is, that the HTTP\
    \ server be running on\n   port 80.  Finally, even if all of these things are\
    \ true, there can be\n   no guarantee that the World-Wide Web server will be prepared\
    \ to honor\n   requests from arbitrary clients.\n   Having said this, the aliases\
    \ do provide useful \"hints\" about the\n   services offered.  We propose that\
    \ they be taken in this spirit.\n   The conventions described in this document\
    \ are, essentially, only\n   useful when the organization's domain name can be\
    \ determined - e.g.\n   from some external database.  A number of groups, including\
    \ the IETF,\n   have been working on ways of finding domain names given a set\
    \ of\n   information such as organization name, location, and business type.\n\
    \   It is hoped that one or more of these will eventually make it\n   possible\
    \ to augment the basic lookup service which the DNS provides\n   with a more generalized\
    \ search and retrieval capability.\n"
- title: 5. DNS server configuration
  contents:
  - "5. DNS server configuration\n   In the short term, whilst directory service technology\
    \ and further\n   types of DNS resource record are being developed, domain name\n\
    \   administrators are encouraged to use these common names for the\n   network\
    \ services they run.  They will make it easier for outsiders to\n   find information\
    \ about your organization, and also make it easier for\n   you to move services\
    \ from one machine to another.\n   There are two conventional approaches to creating\
    \ these DNS entries.\n   One is to add a single CNAME record to your DNS server's\n\
    \   configuration, e.g.\n        ph.hivnet.fr. IN CNAME baby.hivnet.fr.\n   Note\
    \ that in this scenario no information about ph.hivnet.fr should\n   exist in\
    \ the DNS other than the CNAME record. For example,\n   ph.hivnet.fr could not\
    \ contain a MX record.\n   An alternative approach would be to create an A record\
    \ for each of\n   the IP addresses associated with ph.hivnet.fr, e.g.\n      \
    \  ph.hivnet.fr. IN A 194.167.157.2\n   It isn't a simple matter of recommending\
    \ CNAMEs over A records. Each\n   site has it's own set of requirements that may\
    \ make one approach\n   better than the other. RFC 1912 [RFC-1912]  discusses\
    \ some of the\n   configuration issues involved in using CNAMEs.\n   Recent DNS\
    \ server implementations provide a \"round-robin\" feature\n   which causes the\
    \ host's IP addresses to be returned in a different\n   order each time the address\
    \ is looked up.\n   Network clients are starting to appear which, when they encounter\
    \ a\n   host with multiple addresses, use heuristics to determine the address\n\
    \   to contact - e.g. picking the one which has the shortest round-trip-\n   time.\
    \  Thus, if a server is mirrored (replicated) at a number of\n   locations, it\
    \ may be desirable to list the IP addresses of the mirror\n   servers as A records\
    \ of the primary server.  This is only likely to\n   be appropriate if the mirror\
    \ servers are exact copies of the original\n   server.\n"
- title: 6. Limitations of this approach
  contents:
  - "6. Limitations of this approach\n   Some services require that a client have\
    \ more information than the\n   server's domain name.  For example, an LDAP client\
    \ needs to know a\n   starting search base within the Directory Information Tree\
    \ in order\n   to have a meaningful dialogue with the server.  This document does\n\
    \   not attempt to address this problem.\n"
- title: 7. CCSO service name
  contents:
  - "7. CCSO service name\n   There are currently at least three different aliases\
    \ in common use\n   for the CCSO nameserver - e.g. \"ph\", \"cso\" and \"ns\"\
    .  It would appear\n   to be in everyone's interest to narrow the choice of alias\
    \ down to a\n   single name.  \"ns\" would seem to be the best choice since it\
    \ is the\n   most commonly used name.  However, \"ns\" is also being used by DNS\
    \ to\n   point to the DNS server.  In fact, the most prevalent use of \"ns\" is\n\
    \   to name DNS servers.  For this reason, we suggest the use of \"ph\" as\n \
    \  the best name to use for CCSO nameservers.\n   Sites with existing CCSO servers\
    \ using some of these aliases may find\n   it desirable to use all three.  This\
    \ increases the likelihood of the\n   service being found.\n   As noted earlier,\
    \ implementations should be resilient in the event\n   that the name does not\
    \ point to the expected service.\n"
- title: 8. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8. Security Considerations\n   The DNS is open to many kinds of \"spoofing\"\
    \ attacks, and it cannot be\n   guaranteed that the result returned by a DNS lookup\
    \ is indeed the\n   genuine information.  Spoofing may take the form of denial\
    \ of\n   service, such as directing of the client to a non-existent address,\n\
    \   or a passive attack such as an intruder's server which masquerades as\n  \
    \ the legitimate one.\n   Work is ongoing to remedy this situation insofar as\
    \ the DNS is\n   concerned [RFC-2065].  In the meantime it should be noted that\n\
    \   stronger authentication mechanisms such as public key cryptography\n   with\
    \ large key sizes are a pre-requisite if the DNS is being used in\n   any sensitive\
    \ situations.  Examples of these would be on-line\n   financial transactions,\
    \ and any situation where privacy is a concern\n   - such as the querying of medical\
    \ records over the network.  Strong\n   encryption of the network traffic may\
    \ also be advisable, to protect\n   against TCP connection \"hijacking\" and packet\
    \ sniffing.\n"
- title: 9. Conclusions
  contents:
  - "9. Conclusions\n   The service names listed in this document provide a sensible\
    \ set of\n   defaults which may be used as an aid in determining the hosts which\n\
    \   offer particular services for a given domain name.\n   This document has noted\
    \ some exceptions which are either inherently\n   unsuitable for this treatment,\
    \ or already have a substantial\n   installed base using alternative aliases.\n"
