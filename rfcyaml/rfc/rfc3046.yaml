  - "Abstract\n   Newer high-speed public Internet access technologies call for a\n
    \  high-speed modem to have a local area network (LAN) attachment to one\n   or
    more customer premise hosts.  It is advantageous to use the\n   Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol (DHCP) as defined in RFC 2131 to\n   assign customer premise host IP
    addresses in this environment.\n   However, a number of security and scaling problems
    arise with such\n   \"public\" DHCP use.  This document describes a new DHCP option
    to\n   address these issues.  This option extends the set of DHCP options as\n
    \  defined in RFC 2132.\n   The new option is called the Relay Agent Information
    option and is\n   inserted by the DHCP relay agent when forwarding client-originated\n
    \  DHCP packets to a DHCP server.  Servers recognizing the Relay Agent\n   Information
    option may use the information to implement IP address or\n   other parameter
    assignment policies.  The DHCP Server echoes the\n   option back verbatim to the
    relay agent in server-to-client replies,\n   and the relay agent strips the option
    before forwarding the reply to\n   the client.\n   The \"Relay Agent Information\"
    option is organized as a single DHCP\n   option that contains one or more \"sub-options\"
    that convey\n   information known by the relay agent.  The initial sub-options
    are\n   defined for a relay agent that is co-located in a public circuit\n   access
    unit.  These include a \"circuit ID\" for the incoming circuit,\n   and a \"remote
    ID\" which provides a trusted identifier for the remote\n   high-speed modem.\n"

    - "1.1 High-Speed Circuit Switched Data Networks\n   Public Access to the Internet
      is usually via a circuit switched data\n   network.  Today, this is primarily
      implemented with dial-up modems\n   connecting to a Remote Access Server.  But
      higher speed circuit\n   access networks also include ISDN, ATM, Frame Relay,
      and Cable Data\n   Networks.  All of these networks can be characterized as
      a \"star\"\n   topology where multiple users connect to a \"circuit access unit\"
      via\n   switched or permanent circuits.\n   With dial-up modems, only a single
      host PC attempts to connect to the\n   central point.  The PPP protocol is widely
      used to assign IP\n   addresses to be used by the single host PC.\n   The newer
      high-speed circuit technologies, however, frequently\n   provide a LAN interface
      (especially Ethernet) to one or more host\n   PCs.  It is desirable to support
      centralized assignment of the IP\n   addresses of host computers connecting
      on such circuits via DHCP.\n   The DHCP server can be, but usually is not, co-implemented
      with the\n   centralized circuit concentration access device.  The DHCP server
      is\n   often connected as a separate server on the \"Central LAN\" to which\n
      \  the central access device (or devices) attach.\n   A common physical model
      for high-speed Internet circuit access is\n   shown in Figure 1, below.\n                   +---------------+

    - "+---------+\n         Figure 1:  DHCP High Speed Circuit Access Model\n   Note
      that in this model, the \"modem\" connects to a LAN at the user\n   site, rather
      than to a single host.  Multiple hosts are implemented\n   at this site.  Although
      it is certainly possible to implement a full\n   IP router at the user site,
      this requires a relatively expensive\n   piece of equipment (compared to typical
      modem costs).  Furthermore, a\n   router requires an IP address not only for
      every host, but for the\n   router itself.  Finally, a user-side router requires
      a dedicated\n   Logical IP Subnet (LIS) for each user.  While this model is\n
      \  appropriate for relatively small corporate networking environments,\n   it
      is not appropriate for large, public accessed networks.  In this\n   scenario,
      it is advantageous to implement an IP networking model that\n   does not allocate
      an IP address for the modem (or other networking\n   equipment device at the
      user site), and especially not an entire LIS\n   for the user side LAN.\n   Note
      that using this method to obtain IP addresses means that IP\n   addresses can
      only be obtained while communication to the central\n   site is available.  Some
      host lan installations may use a local DHCP\n   server or other methods to obtain
      IP addresses for in-house use.\n"

    - "1.2 DHCP Relay Agent in the Circuit Access Unit\n   It is desirable to use
      DHCP to assign the IP addresses for public\n   high-speed circuit access.  A
      number of circuit access units (e.g.,\n   RAS's, cable modem termination systems,
      ADSL access units, etc)\n   connect to a LAN (or local internet) to which is
      attached a DHCP\n   server.\n   For scaling and security reasons, it is advantageous
      to implement a\n   \"router hop\" at the circuit access unit, much like high-capacity\n
      \  RAS's do today.  The circuit access equipment acts as both a router\n   to
      the circuits and as the DHCP relay agent.\n   The advantages of co-locating
      the DHCP relay agent with the circuit\n   access equipment are:\n   DHCP broadcast
      replies can be routed to only the proper circuit,\n   avoiding, say, the replication
      of the DCHP reply broadcast onto\n   thousands of access circuits;\n   The same
      mechanism used to identify the remote connection of the\n   circuit (e.g., a
      user ID requested by a Remote Access Server acting\n   as the circuit access
      equipment) may be used as a host identifier by\n   DHCP, and used for parameter
      assignment.  This includes centralized\n   assignment of IP addresses to hosts.
      \ This provides a secure remote\n   ID from a trusted source -- the relay agent.\n
      \  A number of issues arise when forwarding DHCP requests from hosts\n   connecting
      publicly accessed high-speed circuits with LAN connections\n   at the host.
      \ Many of these are security issues arising from DHCP\n   client requests from
      untrusted sources.  How does the relay agent\n   know to which circuit to forward
      replies?  How does the system\n   prevent  DHCP IP exhaustion attacks?  This
      is when an attacker\n   requests all available IP addresses from a DHCP server
      by sending\n   requests with fabricated client MAC addresses.  How can an IP
      address\n   or LIS be permanently assigned to a particular user or modem?  How\n
      \  does one prevent \"spoofing\" of client identifier fields used to\n   assign
      IP addresses?  How does one prevent denial of service by\n   \"spoofing\" other
      client's MAC addresses?\n   All of these issues may be addressed by having the
      circuit access\n   equipment, which is a trusted component, add information
      to DHCP\n   client requests that it forwards to the DHCP server.\n"

    - "2.1 Agent Operation\n   Overall adding of the DHCP relay agent option SHOULD
      be configurable,\n   and SHOULD be disabled by default.  Relay agents SHOULD
      have separate\n   configurables for each sub-option to control whether it is
      added to\n   client-to-server packets.\n   A DHCP relay agent adding a Relay
      Agent Information field SHALL add\n   it as the last option (but before 'End
      Option' 255, if present) in\n   the DHCP options field of any recognized BOOTP
      or DHCP packet\n   forwarded from a client to a server.\n   Relay agents receiving
      a DHCP packet from an untrusted circuit with\n   giaddr set to zero (indicating
      that they are the first-hop router)\n   but with a Relay Agent Information option
      already present in the\n   packet SHALL discard the packet and increment an
      error count.  A\n   trusted circuit may contain a trusted downstream (closer
      to client)\n   network element (bridge) between the relay agent and the client
      that\n   MAY add a relay agent option but not set the giaddr field.  In this\n
      \  case, the relay agent does NOT add a \"second\" relay agent option, but\n
      \  forwards the DHCP packet per normal DHCP relay agent operations,\n   setting
      the giaddr field as it deems appropriate.\n   The mechanisms for distinguishing
      between \"trusted\" and \"untrusted\"\n   circuits are specific to the type
      of circuit termination equipment,\n   and may involve local administration.
      \ For example, a Cable Modem\n   Termination System may consider upstream packets
      from most cable\n   modems as \"untrusted\", but an ATM switch terminating VCs
      switched\n   through a DSLAM may consider such VCs as \"trusted\" and accept
      a relay\n   agent option added by the DSLAM.\n   Relay agents MAY have a configurable
      for the maximum size of the DHCP\n   packet to be created after appending the
      Agent Information option.\n   Packets which, after appending the Relay Agent
      Information option,\n   would exceed this configured maximum size shall be forwarded
      WITHOUT\n   adding the Agent Information option.  An error counter SHOULD be\n
      \  incremented in this case.  In the absence of this configurable, the\n   agent
      SHALL NOT increase a forwarded DHCP packet size to exceed the\n   MTU of the
      interface on which it is forwarded.\n   The Relay Agent Information option echoed
      by a server MUST be removed\n   by either the relay agent or the trusted downstream
      network element\n   which added it when forwarding a server-to-client response
      back to\n   the client.\n   The agent SHALL NOT add an \"Option Overload\" option
      to the packet or\n   use the \"file\" or \"sname\" fields for adding Relay Agent
      Information\n   option.  It SHALL NOT parse or remove Relay Agent Information
      options\n   that may appear in the sname or file fields of a server-to-client\n
      \  packet forwarded through the agent.\n   The operation of relay agents for
      specific sub-options is specified\n   with that sub-option.\n   Relay agents
      are NOT required to monitor or modify client-originated\n   DHCP packets addressed
      to a server unicast address.  This  includes\n   the DHCP-REQUEST sent when
      entering the RENEWING state.\n   Relay agents MUST NOT modify DHCP packets that
      use the IPSEC\n   Authentication Header or IPSEC Encapsulating Security Payload
      [6].\n"

      an address request from an\n      unauthorized remote ID.\n   IP Spoofing\n
      \     The circuit access device may associate the IP address assigned by\n      a
      DHCP server in a forwarded DHCP Ack packet with the circuit to\n      which
      it was forwarded.  The circuit access device MAY prevent\n      forwarding of
      IP packets with source IP addresses -other than-\n      those it has associated
      with the receiving circuit.  This prevents\n      simple IP spoofing attacks
      on the Central LAN, and IP spoofing of\n      other hosts.\n   Client Identifier
      Spoofing\n      By using the agent-supplied Agent Remote ID option, the untrusted\n
      \     and as-yet unstandardized client identifier field need not be used\n      by
      the DHCP server.\n   MAC Address Spoofing\n      By associating a MAC address
      with an Agent Remote ID, the DHCP\n      server can prevent offering an IP address
      to an attacker spoofing\n      the same MAC address on a different remote ID.\n"

    - "5.0 Security Considerations\n   DHCP as currently defined provides no authentication
      or security\n   mechanisms.  Potential exposures to attack are discussed in
      section 7\n   of the DHCP protocol specification in RFC 2131 [1].\n   This document
      introduces mechanisms to address several security\n   attacks on the operation
      of IP address assignment, including IP\n   spoofing, Client ID spoofing, MAC
      address spoofing, and DHCP server\n   address exhaustion.  It relies on an implied
      trusted relationship\n   between the DHCP Relay Agent and the DHCP server, with
      an assumed\n   untrusted DHCP client.  It introduces a new identifer, the \"Remote\n
      \  ID\", that is also assumed to be trusted.  The Remote ID is provided\n   by
      the access network or modem and not by client premise equipment.\n   Cryptographic
      or other techniques to authenticate the remote ID are\n   certainly possible
      and encouraged, but are beyond the scope of this\n   document.\n   This option
      is targeted towards environments in which the network\n   infrastructure --
      the relay agent, the DHCP server, and the entire\n   network in which those
      two devices reside -- is trusted and secure.\n   As used in this document, the
      word \"trusted\" implies that\n   unauthorized DHCP traffic cannot enter the
      trusted network except\n   through secured and trusted relay agents and that
      all devices\n   internal to the network are secure and trusted.  Potential deployers\n
      \  of this option should give careful consideration to the potential\n   security
      vulnerabilities that are present in this model before\n   deploying this option
      in actual networks.\n   Note that any future mechanisms for authenticating DHCP
      client to\n   server communications must take care to omit the DHCP Relay Agent\n
      \  option from server authentication calculations.  This was the\n   principal
      reason for organizing the DHCP Relay Agent Option as a\n   single option with
      sub-options, and for requiring the relay agent to\n   remove the option before
      forwarding to the client.\n   While it is beyond the scope of this document
      to specify the general\n   forwarding algorithm of public data circuit access
      units, note that\n   automatic reforwarding of IP or ARP broadcast packets back
      downstream\n   exposes serious IP security risks.  For example, if an upstream\n
      \  broadcast DHCP-DISCOVER or DHCP-REQUEST were re-broadcast back\n   downstream,
      any public host may easily spoof the desired DHCP server.\n"

    - "6.0 IANA Considerations\n   IANA is required to maintain a new number space
      of \"DHCP Relay Agent\n   Sub-options\", located in the BOOTP-DHCP Parameters
      Registry.  The\n   initial sub-options are described in section 2.0 of this
      document.\n   IANA assigns future DHCP Relay Agent Sub-options with a \"IETF\n
      \  Consensus\" policy as described in RFC 2434 [3].  Future proposed\n   sub-options
      are to be referenced symbolically in the Internet-Drafts\n   that describe them,
      and shall be assigned numeric codes by IANA when\n   approved for publication
      as an RFC.\n"
