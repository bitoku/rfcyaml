- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This document describes the encoding method being used to represent\n\
    \   Korean characters in both header and body part of the Internet mail\n   messages\
    \ [RFC822].  This encoding method was specified in 1991, and\n   has since then\
    \ been used.  It has now widely being used in Korean IP\n   networks.\n   This\
    \ document also describes the name of the encoding method which is\n   to be used\
    \ in order to match the message header and body format of\n   MIME [MIME1, MIME2].\n\
    \   This document describes only the encoding method for plain text.\n   Other\
    \ text subtypes, rich text and similar forms of text, are beyond\n   the scope\
    \ of this document.\n"
- title: Description
  contents:
  - "Description\n   It is assumed that the starting code of the message is ASCII.\
    \  ASCII\n   and Korean characters can be distinguished by use of the shift\n\
    \   function.  For example, the code SO will alert us that the upcoming\n   bytes\
    \ will be a Korean character as defined in KSC 5601.  To return\n   to ASCII the\
    \ SI code is used.\n   Therefore, the escape sequence, shift function and character\
    \ set used\n   in a message are as follows:\n           SO           KSC 5601\n\
    \           SI           ASCII\n           ESC $ ) C    Appears once in the beginning\
    \ of a line\n                            before any appearance of SO characters.\n\
    \   The KSC 5601 [KSC5601] character set that includes Hangul, Hanja\n   (Chinese\
    \ ideographic characters), graphic and foreign characters,\n   etc., is two bytes\
    \ long for each character.\n   For more information about Korean character sets\
    \ please refer to the\n   KSC 5601-1987 document.  Also, for more detailed information\
    \ about\n   the escape sequence and the shift function you can look for the ISO\n\
    \   2022 [ISO2022] document.\n"
- title: Formal Syntax
  contents:
  - "Formal Syntax\n   Where this document in its formal syntax does not agree with\
    \ the\n   description part, priority should be given to the formal syntax of\n\
    \   the document.\n   The notations used in this section of the document are according\
    \ to\n   those used in STD 11, RFC 822 [RFC822] with the same meaning.\n     \
    \   * (asterisk) has the following meaning :\n             l*m \"anything\"\n\
    \   The above means that \"anything\" has to be used at least l times and\n  \
    \ at most m times.  Default values for l and m are 0 and infinitive,\n   respectively.\n\

- title: MIME and RFC 1522 Considerations
  contents:
  - "MIME and RFC 1522 Considerations\n   The name to be used for the Hangul encoding\
    \ scheme in the contents is\n   \"ISO-2022-KR\".  This name when used in MIME\
    \ message form would be:\n                Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-kr\n\
    \   Since the Hangul encoding is done with 7 bit format in nature, the\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding-header\
    \ does not need to be used. However,\n   while using the Hangul encoding, current\
    \ Hangul message softwares\n   does not support Base64 or Quoted-Printable encoding\
    \ applied on\n   already encoded Hangul messages.\n   The Hangul encoded in the\
    \ header part of the message is Korean EUC\n   [EUC-KR].  In the EUC-KR encoding,\
    \ the bytes with 8th bit set will be\n   recognized as KSC-5601 characters.  To\
    \ use Hangul in the header part,\n   according to the method proposed in RFC 1522,\
    \ the encoded Hangul are\n   \"B\" or \"Q\" encoded. When doing so, the name to\
    \ be used will be EUC-\n   KR.\n"
- title: Background Information
  contents:
  - "Background Information\n   The Hangul encoding system is based on the ISO 2022\
    \ [ISO2022]\n   environment according to its 4/4 announcement.  However, the Hangul\n\
    \   encoding does not include the announcement's escape sequence.\n   The KSC\
    \ 5601 used in this document is, in definition, identical to\n   the KSC 5601-1987,\
    \ KSC 5601-1989 and KSC 5601-1992's 94x94 octet\n   definition.  Therefore, any\
    \ revision that refers to KSC-5601 after\n   1992 is to be considered as having\
    \ the same meaning.\n   At present, the Hangul encoding system is based on the\
    \ experience\n   acquired from the former widely used \"N-Byte Hangul\" among\
    \ UNIX\n   users.  Actually, the encoding method, \"N-Byte Hangul\", using SO\
    \ and\n   SI was the encoding method used in SDN before KSC 5601 was made a\n\
    \   national standard.\n   This code is intended to be used for the information\
    \ interchange of\n   Hangul messages; any other use of the code is not considered\n\
    \   appropriate.\n"
