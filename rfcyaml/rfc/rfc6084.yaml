  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the usage of the General Internet\
    \ Signaling\n   Transport (GIST) protocol [1] and Datagram Transport Layer Security\n\
    \   (DTLS) [2].\n   GIST, in its initial specification for Connection mode (C-mode)\n\
    \   operation, runs on top of a byte-stream-oriented transport protocol\n   providing\
    \ a reliable, in-sequence delivery, i.e., using the\n   Transmission Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) [9] for signaling message\n   transport.  However, some Next Steps in\
    \ Signaling (NSIS) Signaling\n   Layer Protocol (NSLP) [10] context information\
    \ has a definite\n   lifetime; therefore, the GIST transport protocol could benefit\
    \ from\n   flexible retransmission, so stale NSLP messages that are held up by\n\
    \   congestion can be dropped.  Together with the head-of-line blocking\n   and\
    \ multihoming issues with TCP, these considerations argue that\n   implementations\
    \ of GIST should support SCTP as an optional transport\n   protocol for GIST.\
    \  Like TCP, SCTP supports reliability, congestion\n   control, and fragmentation.\
    \  Unlike TCP, SCTP provides a number of\n   functions that are desirable for\
    \ signaling transport, such as\n   multiple streams and multiple IP addresses\
    \ for path failure recovery.\n   Furthermore, SCTP offers an advantage of message-oriented\
    \ transport\n   instead of using the byte-stream-oriented TCP where the framing\n\
    \   mechanisms must be provided separately.  In addition, its Partial\n   Reliability\
    \ extension (PR-SCTP) [3] supports partial retransmission\n   based on a programmable\
    \ retransmission timer.  Furthermore, DTLS\n   provides a viable solution for\
    \ securing SCTP [4], which allows SCTP\n   to use almost all of its transport\
    \ features and its extensions.\n   This document defines the use of SCTP as the\
    \ underlying transport\n   protocol for GIST and the use of DTLS as a security\
    \ mechanism for\n   protecting GIST Messaging Associations and discusses the implications\n\
    \   on GIST state maintenance and API between GIST and NSLPs.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ this document describes how GIST is transported over\n   SCTP and used by NSLPs\
    \ in order to exploit the additional\n   capabilities offered by SCTP to deliver\
    \ GIST C-mode messages more\n   effectively.  More specifically:\n   o  How to\
    \ use the multiple streams feature of SCTP.\n   o  How to use the PR-SCTP extension\
    \ of SCTP.\n   o  How to take advantage of the multihoming support of SCTP.\n\
    \   GIST over SCTP as described in this document does not require any\n   changes\
    \ to the high-level operation and structure of GIST.  However,\n   adding new\
    \ transport options requires additional interface code and\n   configuration support\
    \ to allow applications to exploit the additional\n   transport when appropriate.\
    \  In addition, SCTP implementations to\n   transport GIST MUST support the optional\
    \ feature of fragmentation of\n   SCTP user messages.\n   Additionally, this document\
    \ also specifies how to establish GIST\n   security using DTLS for use in combination\
    \ with, e.g., SCTP and UDP.\n"

    \ option.  In Forwards-SCTP, analog to Forwards-TCP,\n   connections between peers\
    \ are opened in the forwards direction, from\n   the querying node, towards the\
    \ responder.\n"
- title: '3.1.2.  Protocol-Definition: Forwards-SCTP'
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Protocol-Definition: Forwards-SCTP\n   The MA-Protocol-ID \"Forwards-SCTP\"\
    \ denotes a basic use of SCTP\n   between peers.  Support for this protocol is\
    \ OPTIONAL.  If this\n   protocol is offered, MA-protocol-options data MUST also\
    \ be carried in\n   the SCD object.  The MA-protocol-options field formats are:\n\
    \   o  in a Query: no information apart from the field header.\n   o  in a Response:\
    \ 2-byte port number at which the connection will be\n      accepted, followed\
    \ by 2 pad bytes.\n   The connection is opened in the forwards direction, from\
    \ the querying\n   node towards the responder.  The querying node MAY use any\
    \ source\n   address and source port.  The destination for establishing the\n\
    \   message association MUST be derived from information in the Response:\n  \
    \ the address from the interface-address in the Network-Layer-\n   Information\
    \ object and the port from the SCD object as described\n   above.\n   Associations\

    \  If an error occurs on the SCTP connection\n   such as a reset, as can be reported\
    \ by an SCTP socket API\n   notification [11], GIST MUST report this to NSLPs\

    \ a\n   destination address of a GIST-over-SCTP peer encounters a change, the\n\

- title: 3.2.  Effect on GIST State Maintenance
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Effect on GIST State Maintenance\n   As SCTP provides additional functionality\
    \ over TCP, this section\n   discusses the implications of using GIST over SCTP\
    \ on GIST state\n   maintenance.\n   While SCTP defines unidirectional streams,\
    \ for the purpose of this\n   document, the concept of a bidirectional stream\
    \ is used.\n   Implementations MUST establish both downstream and upstream\n \
    \  (unidirectional) SCTP streams and use the same stream identifier in\n   both\
    \ directions.  Thus, the two unidirectional streams (in opposite\n   directions)\
    \ form a bidirectional stream.\n   Due to the multi-streaming support of SCTP,\
    \ it is possible to use\n   different SCTP streams for different resources (e.g.,\
    \ different NSLP\n   sessions), rather than maintaining all messages along the\
    \ same\n   transport connection/association in a correlated fashion as TCP\n \
    \  (which imposes strict (re)ordering and reliability per transport\n   level).\
    \  However, there are limitations to the use of multi-\n   streaming.  When an\
    \ SCTP implementation is used for GIST transport,\n   all GIST messages for a\
    \ particular session MUST be sent over the same\n   SCTP stream to assure the\
    \ NSLP assumption of in-order delivery.\n   Multiple sessions MAY share the same\
    \ SCTP stream based on local\n   policy.\n   The GIST concept of Messaging Association\
    \ re-use is not affected by\n   this document or the use of SCTP.  All rules defined\
    \ in the GIST\n   specification remain valid in the context of GIST over SCTP.\n"
- title: 3.3.  PR-SCTP Support
  contents:
  - "3.3.  PR-SCTP Support\n   A variant of SCTP, PR-SCTP [3] provides a \"timed reliability\"\
    \n   service, which would be particularly useful for delivering GIST\n   Connection\
    \ mode messages.  It allows the user to specify, on a per-\n   message basis,\
    \ the rules governing how persistent the transport\n   service should be in attempting\
    \ to send the message to the receiver.\n   Because of the chunk bundling function\
    \ of SCTP, reliable and\n   partially reliable messages can be multiplexed over\
    \ a single PR-SCTP\n   association.  Therefore, an SCTP implementation for GIST\
    \ transport\n   SHOULD attempt to establish a PR-SCTP association using \"timed\n\
    \   reliability\" service instead of a standard SCTP association, if\n   available,\
    \ to support more flexible transport features for potential\n   needs of different\
    \ NSLPs.\n   When using a normally reliable session (as opposed to a partially\n\
    \   reliable session), if a node has sent the first transmission before\n   the\
    \ lifetime expires, then the message MUST be sent as a normal\n   reliable message.\
    \  During episodes of congestion, this is\n   particularly unfortunate, as retransmission\
    \ wastes bandwidth that\n   could have been used for other (non-lifetime expired)\
    \ messages.  The\n   \"timed reliability\" service in PR-SCTP eliminates this\
    \ issue and is\n   hence RECOMMENDED to be used for GIST over PR-SCTP.\n"
- title: 3.4.  API between GIST and NSLP
  contents:
  - "3.4.  API between GIST and NSLP\n   The GIST specification defines an abstract\
    \ API between GIST and\n   NSLPs.  While this document does not change the API\
    \ itself, the\n   semantics of some parameters have slightly different interpretations\n\
    \   in the context of SCTP.  This section only lists those primitives and\n  \
    \ parameters that need special consideration when used in the context\n   of SCTP.\
    \  The relevant primitives from [1] are as follows:\n   o  The Timeout parameter\
    \ in API \"SendMessage\": According to [1], this\n      parameter represents the\
    \ \"length of time GIST should attempt to\n      send this message before indicating\
    \ an error\".  When used with\n      PR-SCTP, this parameter is used as the timeout\
    \ for the \"timed\n      reliability\" service of PR-SCTP.\n   o  \"NetworkNotification\"\
    : According to [1], this primitive \"is passed\n      from GIST to a signalling\
    \ application.  It indicates that a\n      network event of possible interest\
    \ to the signalling application\n      occurred\".  Here, if SCTP detects a failure\
    \ of the primary path,\n      GIST SHOULD also indicate this event to the NSLP\
    \ by calling this\n      primitive with Network-Notification-Type \"Routing Status\
    \ Change\".\n      This notification should be done even if SCTP was able to retain\n\
    \      an open connection to the peer due to its multihoming\n      capabilities.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Multihoming Support of SCTP
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Multihoming Support of SCTP\n   In general, the multihoming support of\
    \ SCTP can be used to improve\n   fault-tolerance in case of a path or link failure.\
    \  Thus, GIST over\n   SCTP would be able to deliver NSLP messages between peers\
    \ even if the\n   primary path is not working anymore.  However, for the Message\n\
    \   Routing Methods (MRMs) defined in the basic GIST specification, such\n   a\
    \ feature is only of limited use.  The default MRM is path-coupled,\n   which\
    \ means that if the primary path is failing for the SCTP\n   association, it most\
    \ likely is also failing for the IP traffic that\n   is signaled for.  Thus, GIST\
    \ would need to perform a refresh to the\n   NSIS nodes to the alternative path\
    \ anyway to cope with the route\n   change.  When the two endpoints of a multihomed\
    \ SCTP association (but\n   none of the intermediate nodes between them) support\
    \ NSIS, GIST over\n   SCTP provides a robust means for GIST to deliver NSLP messages\
    \ even\n   when the primary path fails but at least one alternative path between\n\
    \   these (NSIS-enabled) endpoints of the multihomed path is available.\n   Additionally,\
    \ the use of the multihoming support of SCTP provides\n   GIST and the NSLP with\
    \ another source to detect route changes.\n   Furthermore, for the time between\
    \ detection of the route change and\n   recovering from it, the alternative path\
    \ offered by SCTP can be used\n   by the NSLP to make the transition more smoothly.\
    \  Finally, future\n   MRMs might have different properties and therefore benefit\
    \ from\n   multihoming more broadly.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Streaming Support in SCTP
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Streaming Support in SCTP\n   Streaming support in SCTP is advantageous\
    \ for GIST.  It allows better\n   parallel processing, in particular by avoiding\
    \ the head-of-line\n   blocking issue in TCP.  Since a single GIST MA may be reused\
    \ by\n   multiple sessions, using TCP as the transport for GIST signaling\n  \
    \ messages belonging to different sessions may be blocked if another\n   message\
    \ is dropped.  In the case of SCTP, this can be avoided, as\n   different sessions\
    \ having different requirements can belong to\n   different streams; thus, a message\
    \ loss or reordering in a stream\n   will only affect the delivery of messages\
    \ within that particular\n   stream, and not any other streams.\n"
- title: 6.  NAT Traversal Issue
  contents:
  - "6.  NAT Traversal Issue\n   NAT traversal for GIST over SCTP will follow Section\
    \ 7.2 of [1] and\n   the GIST extensibility capabilities defined in [12].  This\n\
    \   specification does not define NAT traversal procedures for GIST over\n   SCTP,\
    \ although an approach for SCTP NAT traversal is described in\n   [13].\n"
- title: 7.  Use of DTLS with GIST
  contents:
  - "7.  Use of DTLS with GIST\n   This section specifies a new MA-Protocol-ID \"\
    DTLS\" (value 4) for the\n   use of DTLS in GIST, which denotes a basic use of\
    \ datagram transport\n   layer channel security, initially in conjunction with\
    \ GIST over SCTP.\n   It provides server (i.e., GIST transport receiver) authentication\
    \ and\n   integrity (as long as the NULL ciphersuite is not selected during\n\
    \   ciphersuite negotiation), as well as optionally replay protection for\n  \
    \ control packets.  The use of DTLS for securing GIST over SCTP allows\n   GIST\
    \ to take the advantage of features provided by SCTP and its\n   extensions. \
    \ The usage of DTLS for GIST over SCTP is similar to TLS\n   for GIST as specified\
    \ in [1], where a stack-proposal containing both\n   MA-Protocol-IDs for SCTP\
    \ and DTLS during the GIST handshake phase.\n   The usage of DTLS [2] for securing\
    \ GIST over datagram transport\n   protocols MUST be implemented and SHOULD be\
    \ used.\n   GIST message associations using DTLS may carry messages with transfer\n\
    \   attributes requesting confidentiality or integrity protection.  The\n   specific\
    \ DTLS version will be negotiated within the DTLS layer\n   itself, but implementations\
    \ MUST NOT negotiate to protocol versions\n   prior to DTLS v1.0 and MUST use\
    \ the highest protocol version\n   supported by both peers.  NULL authentication\
    \ and integrity ciphers\n   MUST NOT be negotiated for GIST nodes supporting DTLS.\
    \  For\n   confidentiality ciphers, nodes can negotiate the NULL ciphersuites.\n\
    \   The same rules for negotiating TLS ciphersuites as specified in\n   Section\
    \ 5.7.3 of [1] apply.\n   DTLS renegotiation [7] may cause problems for applications\
    \ such that\n   connection security parameters can change without the application\n\
    \   knowing it.  Hence, it is RECOMMENDED that renegotiation be disabled\n   for\
    \ GIST over DTLS.\n   No MA-protocol-options field is required for DTLS.  The\
    \ configuration\n   information for the transport protocol over which DTLS is\
    \ running\n   (e.g., SCTP port number) is provided by the MA-protocol-options\
    \ for\n   that protocol.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [1], [6], and\
    \ [2] apply.\n   Additionally, although [4] does not support replay detection\
    \ in DTLS\n   over SCTP, the SCTP replay protection mechanisms [6] [8] should\
    \ be\n   able to protect NSIS messages transported using GIST over (DTLS over)\n\
    \   SCTP from replay attacks.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.  IANA Considerations\n   According to this specification, IANA has registered\
    \ the following\n   codepoints (MA-Protocol-IDs) in a registry created by [1]:\n\
    \     +---------------------+------------------------------------------+\n   \
    \  | MA-Protocol-ID      | Protocol                                 |\n     +---------------------+------------------------------------------+\n\
    \     | 3                   | SCTP opened in the forwards direction    |\n   \
    \  |                     |                                          |\n     |\
    \ 4                   | DTLS initiated in the forwards direction |\n     +---------------------+------------------------------------------+\n\
    \   Note that MA-Protocol-ID \"DTLS\" is never used alone but always\n   coupled\
    \ with a transport protocol specified in the stack proposal.\n"
