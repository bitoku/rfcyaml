  - "                 The Nic's View of Standard Host Names\n   The NIC strongly favors\
    \ standardization of host names. People will\n   get used to the names appearing\
    \ on documents coming from or through\n   the NIC and so we would like the ones\
    \ used by NIC and the ones used\n   in Telnets to agree.  In the absence of agreed\
    \ standard names, we\n   have chosen some.  We are not particularly partial to\
    \ the ones we are\n   using, but do feel any standard naming scheme take into\
    \ account most\n   of the following considerations.\n      (1)  Names consist\
    \ of two parts, SITE and HOST, preferably\n      separated by a delimiter such\
    \ as a dash.\n      (2)  Site and Host names have some mnemonic value, if possible\
    \ not\n      involving the name of the computer as computers will change, but\n\
    \      the organization running it will remain.\n      (3)  We strongly recommend\
    \ at least 8 characters be allowed,\n      including one delimiter.  The NIC now\
    \ uses 12 characters maximum.\n      (4)  Assuming 8 character names, we recommend\
    \ that the site name\n      be a maximum of 6 characters and that Host names at\
    \ a given site\n      be unique in the first six characters.  Thus, with the delimiter,\n\
    \      sites desiring to only have 4 characters in their tables can\n      accept\
    \ all characters typed by the user and truncate to 6\n      characters and still\
    \ achieve uniqueness.\n      (5)  Once the NWG has set a standard syntax and names\
    \ for present\n      Hosts, the NIC should be responsible for maintaining the\
    \ standard\n      and assigning names to new hosts and other groups involved in\n\
    \      Network dialogue. Besides hosts there are NIC stations and\n      individuals\
    \ in organizations not on the Net involved in the\n      Network dialogue.  The\
    \ NIC needs to assign names to these Network\n      affiliations and will use\
    \ the rules set by the NWG.\n        [This RFC was put into machine readable form\
    \ for entry]\n     [into the online RFC archives by Hlne Morin, Viagnie 10/99]\n"
