- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the Internet\n\
    \   Architecture Board (IAB), and the at-large IETF representatives to\n   the\
    \ IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) are selected by a\n   \"Nominating\
    \ and Recall Committee\" (universally abbreviated as\n   \"NomCom\").  [RFC3777]\
    \ defines how the NomCom is selected and the\n   processes it follows as it selects\
    \ candidates for these positions.\n   This document describes an issue with [RFC3777]\
    \ that causes an\n   avoidable delay in the NomCom process and specifies a normative\n\
    \   update to resolve the issue.\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   [RFC3777] is the latest in a series of revisions to the NomCom\n\
    \   process.  [RFC3777] has been updated once since 2004, but the update\n   ([RFC5078])\
    \ did not change normative text (it replaced a sample\n   timeline).\n   [RFC5078]\
    \ identifies a serial delay in the process described in\n   [RFC3777], in Section\
    \ 4 (\"Nominating Committee Selection\"), Bullet\n   13, which states:\n     \
    \ The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be\n      reviewed and\
    \ announces it along with a solicitation for names of\n      volunteers from the\
    \ IETF community willing to serve on the\n      nominating committee.\n      The\
    \ solicitation must permit the community at least 30 days during\n      which\
    \ they may choose to volunteer to be selected for the\n      nominating committee.\n\
    \      The list of open positions is published with the solicitation to\n    \
    \  facilitate community members choosing between volunteering for an\n      open\
    \ position and volunteering for the nominating committee.\n   The result is that\
    \ the Incoming NomCom Chair is the only person who\n   can announce the list of\
    \ open positions and solicitation for names of\n   volunteers, a process that\
    \ requires 30 days for public solicitation.\n   Since this is the first step in\
    \ organizing the NomCom, delays in\n   selecting the Incoming NomCom Chair translate\
    \ directly into delays in\n   issuing the solicitation and organizing the NomCom.\n\
    \   This proved problematic in practice in 2008-2009, when Joel Halpern\n   was\
    \ named NomCom Chair less than 30 days prior to the second IETF\n   meeting of\
    \ the year.  If the 30-day solicitation had already taken\n   place, the NomCom\
    \ could have conducted face-to-face interviews at the\n   second IETF meeting,\
    \ but since the required 30-day solicitation\n   didn't start until Joel was named,\
    \ Joel was unable to assemble his\n   NomCom before the second IETF meeting, and\
    \ the NomCom had to carry\n   out these interviews using email and conference\
    \ calls.\n   It is desirable to allow the solicitation and announcement to take\n\
    \   place in a timely manner so that when an Incoming NomCom Chair is\n   named,\
    \ the NomCom Chair can immediately begin executing the NomCom\n   process.\n"
- title: 3.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "3.  Discussion\n   This document proposes that four weeks after the first IETF\
    \ meeting\n   each year, the Internet Society President will either announce an\n\
    \   Incoming NomCom Chair, or will direct the IETF Executive Director to\n   issue\
    \ the announcement of open positions and the solicitation for\n   names of volunteers\
    \ on behalf of the Incoming NomCom Chair.  This\n   allows the search for the\
    \ Incoming NomCom Chair and volunteers to\n   proceed in parallel.\n   This process\
    \ change covers only the announcement of open positions\n   and solicitation for\
    \ names of volunteers.  This process change does\n   not allow the NomCom process\
    \ to move to completion without an\n   Incoming NomCom Chair; it is only to ensure\
    \ that the Incoming NomCom\n   Chair can begin executing the NomCom process without\
    \ an avoidable\n   delay and can use face-to-face time at the second IETF meeting\n\
    \   effectively for this purpose.\n   During discussions in the IETF 74 timeframe,\
    \ it was suggested that we\n   also allow the Secretariat to perform other clerical\
    \ tasks that\n   aren't called out specifically in the NomCom process but that\
    \ clearly\n   do not require NomCom Chair judgment.  This document does not provide\n\
    \   guidance about specific clerical tasks that would be appropriate for\n   the\
    \ Secretariat to carry out.  Instead, either the Incoming NomCom\n   Chair (if\
    \ one has been selected) or the Outgoing NomCom Chair (if the\n   search for an\
    \ Incoming NomCom Chair is still underway) may request\n   the Secretariat to\
    \ perform these tasks, with appropriate notification\n   to the community.\n"
- title: 4.  Updated Text from RFC 3777
  contents:
  - "4.  Updated Text from RFC 3777\n   [RFC3777], Section 4 (\"Nominating Committee\
    \ Selection\"), Bullet 13,\n   states:\n      The Chair obtains the list of IESG\
    \ and IAB positions to be\n      reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation\
    \ for names of\n      volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the\n\
    \      nominating committee.\n   This text is replaced with the following text:\n\
    \      The Chair (or the IETF Executive Director, if no Chair has been\n     \
    \ named four weeks after the first IETF meeting of the year) obtains\n      the\
    \ list of positions to be reviewed and announces it along with a\n      solicitation\
    \ for names of volunteers from the IETF community\n      willing to serve on the\
    \ nominating committee.\n      If the IETF Executive Director issues the solicitation\
    \ for\n      volunteers, the IETF Executive Director must also collect\n     \
    \ responses to the solicitation and provide the names of volunteers\n      to\
    \ the Incoming NomCom Chair when the Incoming NomCom Chair is\n      named.\n\
    \      At the Chair's request, the IETF Secretariat may perform other\n      clerical\
    \ support tasks, as long as the task being performed does\n      not require NomCom\
    \ Chair judgment, in the NomCom Chair's opinion,\n      and as long as the community\
    \ is appropriately notified that this\n      request is being made.  This request\
    \ may come from the Incoming\n      NomCom Chair (if one has been selected for\
    \ this NomCom cycle) or\n      the Outgoing NomCom Chair (if the search for an\
    \ Incoming NomCom\n      Chair is still underway).\n   Note: This text no longer\
    \ specifies the list of bodies that NomCom\n   reviews, rather than adding IAOC\
    \ to the list of bodies in the text,\n   so that this text need not change further\
    \ when NomCom\n   responsibilities change.\n"
- title: 5.  Possible Topics for Later Discussion
  contents:
  - "5.  Possible Topics for Later Discussion\n   This section contains topics that\
    \ came up during discussion of this\n   document but were ruled out of scope,\
    \ because the goal for this\n   document was incremental improvement, and these\
    \ topics were more than\n   incremental changes.  They may be discussed further,\
    \ or not, but\n   we're less likely to forget them completely if we write them\
    \ down.\n   [RFC3777] tightly couples the announcement of open positions and call\n\
    \   for volunteers, and this document didn't try to unravel these two\n   separate\
    \ actions.  We had a request during discussion to separate\n   them, so that a\
    \ NomCom could consider the management structure of the\n   IETF and the position\
    \ descriptions that the leadership bodies\n   provide, before announcing the positions\
    \ being reviewed.\n"
