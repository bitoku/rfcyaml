    \      STATUS:  Required\n      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 791 (in IPTW)\n      COMMENTS:\n\
    \         This is the universal protocol of the Internet.  This datagram\n   \
    \      protocol provides the universal addressing of hosts in the\n         Internet.\n\
    \         A few minor problems have been noted in this document.\n         The\
    \ most serious is a bit of confusion in the route options.\n         The route\
    \ options have a pointer that indicates which octet of\n         the route is\
    \ the next to be used.  The confusion is between the\n         phrases \"the pointer\
    \ is relative to this option\" and \"the\n         smallest legal value for the\
    \ pointer is 4\".  If you are\n         confused, forget about the relative part,\
    \ the pointer begins\n         at 4.\n         Another important point is the\
    \ alternate reassembly procedure\n         suggested in RFC 815.\n         Note\
    \ that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You\n         have not completed\
    \ an implementation of IP if it does not\n         include ICMP.\n      OTHER\

    \ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)  --------------------------------\n    \
    \  STATUS:  Recommended\n      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 793 (in IPTW)\n      COMMENTS:\n\
    \         Provides reliable end-to-end data stream service.\n         Many comments\
    \ and corrections have been received for the TCP\n         specification document.\
    \  These are primarily document bugs\n         rather than protocol bugs.\n  \
    \       Event Processing Section:  There are many minor corrections and\n    \
    \     clarifications needed in this section.\n         Push:  There are still\
    \ some phrases in the document that give a\n         \"record mark\" flavor to\
    \ the push.  These should be further\n         clarified.  The push is not a record\
    \ mark.\n         Listening Servers:  Several comments have been received on\n\
    \         difficulties with contacting listening servers.  There should\n    \
    \     be some discussion of implementation issues for servers, and\n         some\
    \ notes on alternative models of system and process\n         organization for\
    \ servers.\n         Maximum Segment Size:  The maximum segment size option should\n\
    \         be generalized and clarified.  It can be used to either\n         increase\
    \ or decrease the maximum segment size from the default.\n         The default\
    \ should be established more clearly.  The default is\n         based on the default\
    \ maximum Internet Datagram size which is\n         576 octets counting the IP\
    \ and TCP headers.  The option counts\n         only the segment data.  For each\
    \ of IP and TCP the minimum\n         header is 20 octets and the maximum header\
    \ is 60 octets. So the\n         default maximum data segment is could be anywhere\
    \ from 456 to\n         536 octets.  The current proposal is to set it at 536\
    \ data\n         octets.\n         Idle Connections:  There have been questions\
    \ about\n         automatically closing idle connections.  Idle connections are\n\
    \         ok, and should not be closed.  There are several cases where\n     \
    \    idle connections arise, for example, in Telnet when a user is\n         thinking\
    \ for a long time following a message from the server\n         computer before\
    \ his next input.  There is no TCP \"probe\"\n         mechanism, and none is\
    \ needed.\n         Queued Receive Data on Closing:  There are several points\
    \ where\n         it is not clear from the description what to do about data\n"

    \   File Transfer Protocol (FTP)  ---------------------------------------\n  \
    \    STATUS:  Recommended\n      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 765 (in IPTW)\n      COMMENTS:\n\
    \         The protocol for moving files between Internet hosts.  Provides\n  \
    \       for access control and negotiation of file parameters.\n         There\
    \ are a number of minor corrections to be made.  A major\n         change is the\
    \ deletion of the mail commands, and a major\n         clarification is needed\
    \ in the discussion of the management of\n         the data connection.  Also,\
    \ a suggestion has been made to\n         include some directory manipulation\
    \ commands (RFC 775).\n         Even though the MAIL features are defined in this\
    \ document,\n         they are not to be used.  The SMTP protocol is to be used\
    \ for\n         all mail service in the Internet.\n         Data Connection Management:\n\
    \            a.  Default Data Connection Ports:  All FTP implementations\n   \
    \         must support use of the default data connection ports, and\n       \
    \     only the User-PI may initiate the use of non-default ports.\n          \
    \  b.  Negotiating Non-Default Data Ports:   The User-PI may\n            specify\
    \ a non-default user side data port with the PORT\n            command.  The User-PI\
    \ may request the server side to\n            identify a non-default server side\
    \ data port with the PASV\n            command.  Since a connection is defined\
    \ by the pair of\n            addresses, either of these actions is enough to\
    \ get a\n            different data connection, still it is permitted to do both\n"

    \          commands to use new ports on both ends of the data\n            connection.\n\
    \            c.  Reuse of the Data Connection:  When using the stream\n      \
    \      mode of data transfer the end of the file must be indicated\n         \
    \   by closing the connection.  This causes a problem if\n            multiple\
    \ files are to be transfered in the session, due to\n            need for TCP\
    \ to hold the connection record for a time out\n            period to guarantee\
    \ the reliable communication.  Thus the\n            connection can not be reopened\
    \ at once.\n               There are two solutions to this problem.  The first\
    \ is to\n               negotiate a non-default port (as in (b) above).  The\n\
    \               second is to use another transfer mode.\n               A comment\
    \ on transfer modes.  The stream transfer mode is\n               inherently unreliable,\
    \ since one can not determine if the\n               connection closed prematurely\
    \ or not.  The other transfer\n               modes (Block, Compressed) do not\
    \ close the connection to\n               indicate the end of file.  They have\
    \ enough FTP encoding\n               that the data connection can be parsed to\
    \ determine the\n               end of the file.  Thus using these modes one can\
    \ leave\n               the data connection open for multiple file transfers.\n\
    \               Why this was not a problem with the old NCP FTP:\n           \
    \       The NCP was designed with only the ARPANET in mind.\n                \
    \  The ARPANET provides very reliable service, and the\n                  NCP\
    \ counted on it.  If any packet of data from an NCP\n                  connection\
    \ were lost or damaged by the network the NCP\n                  could not recover.\
    \  It is a tribute to the ARPANET\n                  designers that the NCP FTP\
    \ worked so well.\n                  The TCP is designed to provide reliable connections\n\
    \                  over many different types of networks and\n               \
    \   interconnections of networks.  TCP must cope with a\n                  set\
    \ of networks that can not promise to work as well\n                  as the ARPANET.\
    \  TCP must make its own provisions for\n                  end-to-end recovery\
    \ from lost or damaged packets.\n                  This leads to the need for\
    \ the connection phase-down\n                  time-out.  The NCP never had to\
    \ deal with\n                  acknowledgements or retransmissions or many other\n\
    \                  things the TCP must do to make connection reliable in\n   \
    \               a more complex world.\n         LIST and NLST:\n            There\
    \ is some confusion about the LIST an NLST commands, and\n            what is\
    \ appropriate to return.  Some clarification and\n"
