  - "Introduction\n   Currently, IP addresses on the Internet are 32-bit quantities\
    \ which\n   are generally represented as four decimal numbers from 0 to 255,\n\
    \   separated by periods, sometimes called a \"dotted\" decimal number.\n   The\
    \ current numbering scheme provides in general for three classes of\n   networks\
    \ in general use (A,B, and C), and two other classes of\n   networks (D, E).\n\
    \   The Class A networks assign a large address space for the particular\n   network\
    \ to allow up to 254^3 local machines [1].  The Class B network\n   assigns a\
    \ somewhat smaller address space for the particular network\n   to allow up to\
    \ 254^2 local machines.  The Class C network assigns a\n   still smaller address\
    \ space for the particular network to allow up to\n   254 local machines.\n  \
    \ This memo proposes to assign part of the unused Class C address space\n   for\
    \ smaller networks than are currently available.  The term \"Class\n   D\" is\
    \ used for the \"multicast\" capability and addresses in \"Class E\"\n   are reserved\
    \ for future use.  Therefore, these new features for which\n   capability is to\
    \ be added is being referred to as classes F, G, H and\n   K.\n"
- title: Suggestion for new IP address classes
  contents:
  - "Suggestion for new IP address classes\n   The most worrisome problem which appears\
    \ in the literature is the\n   possibility of running out of address space for\
    \ IP addresses. Various\n   schemes are being suggested such as subrouting, introduction\
    \ of\n   additional bits, and other possibilities.\n   There is an even more serious\
    \ matter.  In all probability, I suspect\n   that eventually the Internet backbone\
    \ will either become available to\n   anyone who wants to use it (like public\
    \ highways) and the costs paid\n   for out of taxes or some other method which\
    \ gets someone else to pay\n   for it, or eventually the Internet will be fully\
    \ commercialized and\n   made available to anyone who wants to buy a permanent\
    \ connection.\n   With the cost of hardware and connections dropping, some Computer\n\
    \   Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) which are currently accessible via\n   telephone\
    \ call may become accessible via TELNET or FTP.  When a 9600\n   baud connection\
    \ can be obtained for around the price of a phone line,\n   the demand for internet\
    \ access will skyrocket.  This almost certain\n   eventual availability to virtually\
    \ anyone who wants a connection will\n   cause an even greater demand for internet\
    \ addresses, which will\n   exacerbate this situation.  One problem is in the\
    \ granularity of IP\n   addressing, in that the smallest possible IP address one\
    \ may obtain\n   allows for as high as 254 IP addresses.  If someone wanted only\
    \ to\n   put four or five computers on the Internet, more than 240 addresses\n\
    \   are wasted.\n   Many smaller installations would probably be interested either\
    \ in\n   placing their computers and/or servers on the Internet (and perhaps\n\
    \   helping to pay the cost of running it) or in being able to access the\n  \
    \ Internet directly, and perhaps making facilities on their machines\n   available\
    \ to others; the problem being that IP addresses on Internet\n   are not readily\
    \ available to small classes of users.  Also, the\n   possibility exists of eventually\
    \ placing non-computer and output-only\n   devices such as printers, facsimile\
    \ machines, and visual pagers\n   directly on the Internet to allow people to\
    \ send a message to a local\n   device simply by directing it to a specific internet\
    \ site as an E-\n   Mail message.\n   The scheme proposed by this paper proposes\
    \ to make a slight change in\n   one of the classes of network address in a manner\
    \ which should not be\n   a significant problem for implementing, and should not\
    \ cause a\n   significant hardship as the addresses to use for this purpose are\
    \ not\n   now allocated anyway, and may draw some of the drain which would have\n\
    \   consumed Class C addresses in large quantity into quantities of Class\n  \
    \ F, H, or K addresses which waste less IP address space.\n   This scheme I am\
    \ proposing is to allow for very small networks (1 or\n   2, 1-7, or 1-15, depending\
    \ on the number of addresses the\n   administrator of that site thinks he will\
    \ need), by reconstructing\n   the network address to include what is nominally\
    \ part of the local\n   address.  If bridges and routers (and other hardware and\
    \ software) do\n   not assume that only the last 8 bits make up a local address\
    \ and\n   permit smaller spaces for local addresses, then this method should\n\
    \   not cause problems. Sites needing less than a close order of 256 IP\n   addresses\
    \ could simply apply for 2 or more contiguous blocks of Class\n   F numbers.\n\
    \   Currently, a Class C address consists of a 32-bit number in which the\n  \
    \ leftmost 3 bits consist of \"110\" [2]:\n        The third type of address,\
    \ class C, has a 21-bit network number\n        and a 8-bit local address.  The\
    \ three highest-order bits are set\n        to 1-1-0.  This allows 2,097,152 class\
    \ C networks.\n                        1                   2                 \

    \                        Current Class C Address\n   This memo proposes to change\
    \ Class C addresses to be 4-bit numbers\n   beginning with \"1100\":\n   The third\
    \ type of address, class C, has a 20-bit network number and a\n   8-bit local\
    \ address.  The four highest-order bits are set to 1-1-0-0,\n   This allows 1,048,576\

    \                     Proposed new Class C Address\n   This memo then proposes\
    \ to add four new types of addresses, to be\n   referred to as \"Class F\", \"\
    Class G\", \"Class H\", and \"Class K\" [3].\n   These would all use part of the\
    \ \"old\" class C address by all using IP\n   addresses that begin with the 4-bit\
    \ sequence \"1101\".  The Class F\n   addresses would begin with the binary code\
    \ sequence \"11010\", Class G\n   addresses begin with \"110110\", Class H addresses\
    \ with \"1101110\", and\n   Class K with \"1101111\".\n   Class F addresses will\
    \ be used for networks having from 1-15 sites\n   [4], where the number could\
    \ be expected to exceed 7.  Class F\n   addresses are defined as follows:\n  \
    \ The sixth type of address, class F, has a 23-bit network number, and\n   a 4-bit\
    \ local address.  The five highest-order bits are set to 1-1-\n   0-1-0.  This\

  - "Optional selection of routing codes by region\n   Because of the possibility\
    \ of confusion, some method similar to the\n   international dialing plan might\
    \ be set up, in which bits 5-8 in\n   Class F, bits 7-10 in Class H, and bits\
    \ 6-9 in Class K could be used\n   to define what part of the world the particular\
    \ address is in, in a\n   manner similar to the international telephone dialing\
    \ system, which\n   uses the first digit of the international telephone number\
    \ to\n   determine the region being used.  The current method for assigning\n\
    \   international dialing codes is:\n      1 North America               6 Oceania,\
    \ Australia\n      2 Africa                      7 Ex-Soviet Union Countries\n\
    \      3 Europe                      8 Asia\n      4 Europe                  \
    \    9 Mideast\n      5 South America and Mexico\n   If a similar method is used,\
    \ I would recommend assigning 0,1,10 and\n   11 to North America, 8 and 12 to\
    \ Asia, and leaving 13 through 15 for\n   other areas as needed.  Note that this\
    \ would simply make some routing\n   choices easier, it is not precisely necessary\
    \ that this be done,\n   since currently routing is generally done using the shortest\
    \ path to\n   a site and IP numbers don't really relate to any specific address\n\
    \   anywhere in the world.\n   The number form of a class F, G, H or K address\
    \ could still be listed\n   in the standard form n.n.n.n, as long as it is not\
    \ assumed that the\n   4th chunk number alone identifies a local address and that\
    \ numbers\n   with the same preceding 3 chunks do not necessarily belong to the\n\
    \   same network.\n"

  - "Summary\n   In order to make the address space available, even if the method\

    \   that Class F, G, H, and K address space should be taken out of Class\n   C\
    \ space and reserved for the purpose of allowing smaller-sized\n   networks so\
    \ that this feature may be made available.  Since Class C\n   addresses currently\
    \ are only using the equivalent of one Class A\n   number anyway, this should\
    \ not cause a problem.\n"
- title: Notes
  contents:
  - "Notes\n   [1] Common practice dictates that neither an address 0 nor 255 should\n\
    \       be used in any \"dotted\" address.\n   [2] Reynolds, J., and J. Postel,\
    \ \"Assigned Numbers\", STD 2, RFC 1340,\n       USC/Information Sciences Institute,\
    \ July 1992.\n   [3] To prevent confusion, no class \"I\" or \"J\" address was\
    \ created by\n       this memo.\n   [4] It is expected that if the higher part\
    \ of the network address\n       occupying the 4-bits to the left of the Class\
    \ F address are\n       neither 0 nor 15, that a class F site could have 16 machines.\
    \  If\n       the 4-bits to the left are all 0, the Class F site must not use\n\
    \       number 0.  If the four bits are all 1, the site must not use\n       number\
    \ 15.\n   [5] It may be that Class H numbers are more appropriate for classes\n\
    \       of addresses that will not have as high a demand for access via\n    \
    \   Internet addresses such as facsimile machines and pagers.  (The\n       end\
    \ digit could be used to determine class of service, i.e., 0\n       for tone\
    \ only, 1 and 2 for numeric only, 3 4 and 5 for\n       alphanumeric, and 6 and\
    \ 7 for facsimile machines.  Or some\n       combination of these according to\
    \ the demand.  Remember,\n       Internet won't always be just text messages and\
    \ file transfers;\n       we may eventually see things like voice telephone calls\
    \ or voice\n       data being placed to an Internet address just like calls made\n\
    \       via the telephone system.  This would require a whole change in\n    \
    \   the way things are done, but it's always best to look at the\n       future.\n\
    \   [6] It is suggested that addresses in this range not be assigned\n       where\
    \ the 7 bits to the left of the local number are all the\n       same (all 0 or\
    \ all 1), to allow all Class K addresses to have\n       two local addresses.\n\
    \   [7] Different things can be done with different capabilities.  One\n     \
    \  thought was to set up some group of numbers and use them to\n       indicate\
    \ systems which are \"gateway\" systems, i.e., the top set\n       of numbers\
    \ in Class K could indicate that subnets are required\n       after those numbers,\
    \ similar to the use of an extension number on\n       the switchboard of a large\
    \ organization.   Another possibility is\n       to assign some of the numbers\
    \ to specific classes of devices,\n       such as number-only pagers and electronic\
    \ display devices.\n"
