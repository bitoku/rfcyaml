- title: Executive Summary
  contents:
  - "Executive Summary\n   The U.S. Navy has several efforts exploring the applicability\
    \ of\n   commercial internetworking technology to tactical RF networks.  Some\n\
    \   these include the NATO Communication System Network Interoperability\n   (CSNI)\
    \ project, the Naval Research Laboratory Data/Voice Integration\n   Advanced Technology\
    \ Demonstration (D/V ATD), and the Navy\n   Communication Support System (CSS)\
    \ architecture development.\n   Critical requirements have been identified for\
    \ security, mobility,\n   real-time data delivery applications, multicast, and\
    \ quality-of-\n   service and policy based routing.  Address scaling for Navy\n\
    \   application of internet technology will include potentially very\n   large\
    \ numbers of local (intra-platform) distributed information and\n   weapons systems\
    \ and a smaller number of nodes requiring global\n   connectivity.  The flexibility\
    \ of the current Internet Protocol (IP)\n   for supporting widely different communication\
    \ media should be\n   preserved to meet the needs of the highly heterogeneous\
    \ networks of\n   the tactical environment.  Compact protocol headers are necessary\
    \ for\n   efficient data transfer on the relatively-low throughput RF systems.\n\
    \   Mechanisms which can  enhance the effectiveness of an internet\n   datagram\
    \ protocol to provide resource reservation, priority, and\n   service quality\
    \ guarantees are also very important.  The broadcast\n   nature of many RF networks\
    \ and the need for broad dissemination of\n   information to warfighting participants\
    \ makes multicast the general\n   case for information flow in the tactical environment.\n"
- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   This paper describes requirements for Internet Protocol next\n\
    \   generation (IPng) candidates with respect to their application to\n   military\
    \ tactical radio frequency (RF) communication networks.  The\n   foundation for\
    \ these requirements are experiences in the NATO\n   Communication System Network\
    \ Interoperability (CSNI) project, the\n   Naval Research Laboratory Data/Voice\
    \ Integration Advanced Technology\n   Demonstration (D/V ATD), and the Navy Communication\
    \ Support System\n   (CSS) architecture development.\n   The goal of the CSNI\
    \ project is to apply internetworking technology\n   to facilitate multi-national\
    \ interoperability for typical military\n   communication applications (e.g.,\
    \ electronic messaging, tactical data\n   exchange, and digital voice) on typical\
    \ tactical RF communication\n   links and networks.  The International Standard\
    \ Organization (ISO)\n   Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) protocol suite, including\
    \ the\n   Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP), was selected for this project\n\
    \   for policy reasons.  This paper will address design issues\n   encountered\
    \ in meeting the project goals with this particular\n   protocol stack.\n   The\
    \ D/V ATD is focused on demonstrating  a survivable, self-\n   configuring, self-recovering\
    \ RF subnetwork technology capable of\n   simultaneously supporting data delivery,\
    \ including message transfer,\n   imagery, and tactical data, and real-time digital\
    \ voice applications.\n   Support for real-time interactive communication applications\
    \ was\n   extended to include a \"white board\" and other similar applications.\n\
    \   IP datagram delivery is also planned as part of this demonstration\n   system.\n\
    \   The CSS architecture will provide U.S. Navy tactical platforms with a\n  \
    \ broad array of user-transparent voice and data information exchange\n   services.\
    \  This will include support for sharing and management of\n   limited platform\
    \ communication resources among multiple warfighting\n   communities.  Emphasis\
    \ is placed on attaining interoperability with\n   other military services and\
    \ foreign allies.  Utilization of\n   commercial off-the-shelf communications\
    \ products to take advantage of\n   existing economies of scale is important to\
    \ make any resulting system\n   design affordable.  It is anticipated that open,\
    \ voluntary standards,\n   and flexible communication protocols, such as IP, will\
    \ play a key\n   role in meeting the goals of this architecture.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   Before addressing any IPng requirements as applied to tactical\
    \ RF\n   communications, it is necessary to define what this paper means by\n\
    \   \"IPng requirements\".  To maintain brevity, this paper will focus on\n  \
    \ criteria related specifically to the design of an OSI model's Layer 3\n   protocol\
    \ format and a few other areas suggested by RFC 1550.  There\n   are several additional\
    \ areas of concern in applying internetwork\n   protocols to the military tactical\
    \ RF setting including routing\n   protocol design, address assignment, network\
    \ management, and resource\n   management.  While these areas are equally important,\
    \ this paper will\n   attempt to satisfy the purpose of RFC 1550 and address issues\
    \ more\n   directly applicable to selection of an IPng candidate.\n"
- title: Scaling
  contents:
  - "Scaling\n   The projection given in RFC 1550 that IPng should be able to deal\n\
    \   with 10 to the 12th nodes is more than adequate in the face of\n   military\
    \ requirements.  More important is that it is possible to\n   assign addresses\
    \ efficiently.  For example, although a military\n   platform may have a relatively\
    \ small number of nodes with\n   requirements to communicate with a larger, global\
    \ infrastructure,\n   there will likely be applications of IPng to management\
    \ and control\n   of distributed systems (e.g., specific radio communications\
    \ equipment\n   and processors, weapons systems, etc.) within the platform.  This\n\
    \   local expansion of address space requirements may not necessarily\n   need\
    \ to be solved by \"sheer numbers\" of globally-unique addresses but\n   perhaps\
    \ by alternate delimitation of addressing to differentiate\n   between globally-unique\
    \ and locally-unique addressing.  The\n   advantages of a compact internet address\
    \ header are clear for\n   relatively low capacity RF networks.\n"
- title: Timescale, Transition and Deployment
  contents:
  - "Timescale, Transition and Deployment\n   The U.S. Navy and other services are\
    \ only recently (the last few\n   years) beginning to design and deploy systems\
    \ utilizing open systems\n   internetworking technology.  From this point of view,\
    \ the time scale\n   for selection of IPng must be somewhat rapid.  Otherwise,\
    \ two\n   transition phases will need to be suffered, 1) the move from unique,\n\
    \   \"stove pipe\" systems to open, internetworked (e.g., IP) systems, and\n \
    \  then 2) a transition from deployed IP-based systems to IPng.  In some\n   sense,\
    \ if an IPng is quickly accepted and widely implemented, the\n   transition for\
    \ tactical military systems will be somewhat easier than\n   the enterprise Internet\
    \ where a large investment in current IP\n   already exists.  However, having\
    \ said this, the Department of Defense\n   as a whole already deploys a large\
    \ number  of IP-capable systems, and\n   the issue of transition from IP to IPng\
    \ remains significant.\n"
- title: Security
  contents:
  - "Security\n   As with any military system, information security, including\n \
    \  confidentiality and authenticity of data, is of paramount importance.\n   With\
    \ regards to IPng, network layer security mechanisms for tactical\n   RF networks\
    \ generally important for authentication purposes,\n   including routing protocol\
    \ authentication, source authentication, and\n   user network access control.\
    \  Concerns for denial of service attacks,\n   traffic analysis monitoring, etc.,\
    \ usually dictate that tactical RF\n   communication networks provide link layer\
    \ security mechanisms.\n   Compartmentalization and multiple levels of security\
    \ for different\n   users of common communication resources call for additional\
    \ security\n   mechanisms at the transport layer or above.  In the typical tactical\n\
    \   RF environment, network layer confidentiality and, in some cases,\n   even\
    \ authentication becomes redundant with these other security\n   mechanisms.\n\
    \   The need for network layer security mechanisms becomes more critical\n   when\
    \ the military utilizes commercial telecommunications systems or\n   has tactical\
    \ systems inter-connected with commercial internets.\n   While the Network Encryption\
    \ Server (NES) works in this role today,\n   there is a desire for a more integrated,\
    \ higher performance solution\n   in the future.  Thus, to meet the military requirement\
    \ for\n   confidentiality and authentication, an IPng candidate must be capable\n\
    \   of operating in a secure manner when necessary, but also allow for\n   efficient\
    \ operation on low-throughput RF links when other security\n   mechanisms are\
    \ already in place.\n   In either of these cases, key management is extremely\
    \ important.\n   Ideally, a common key management system could be used to provide\
    \ key\n   distribution for security mechanisms at any layer from the\n   application\
    \ to the link layer.  As a result, it is anticipated,\n   however, that key distribution\
    \ is a function of management, and\n   should not dependent upon a particular\
    \ IPng protocol format.\n"
- title: Mobility
  contents:
  - "Mobility\n   The definition of most tactical systems include mobility in some\n\
    \   form.  Many tactical RF network designs provide means for members to\n   join\
    \ and leave particular RF subnets as their position changes.  For\n   example,\
    \ as a platform moves out of the RF line-of-sight (LOS) range,\n   it may switch\
    \ from a typical LOS RF media such as the ultra-high\n   frequency (UHF) band\
    \ to a long-haul RF media such as high frequency\n   (HF) or satellite communication\
    \ (SATCOM).\n   In some cases, such as the D/V ATD network, the RF subnet will\n\
    \   perform its own routing and management of this dynamic topology.\n   This\
    \ will be invisible to the internet protocol except for\n   (hopefully) subtle\
    \ changes to some routing metrics (e.g., more or\n   less delay to reach a host).\
    \  In this instance, the RF subnetwork\n   protocols serve as a buffer to the\
    \ internet routing protocols and\n   IPng will not need to be too concerned with\
    \ mobility.\n   In other cases, however, the platform may make a dramatic change\
    \ in\n   position and require a major change in internet routing.  IPng must\n\
    \   be able to support this situation.  It is recognized that an internet\n  \
    \ protocol may not be able to cope with large, rapid changes in\n   topology.\
    \  Efforts will be made to minimize the frequency of this in\n   a tactical RF\
    \ communication architecture, but there are instances\n   when a major change\
    \ in topology is required.\n   Furthermore, it should be realized that mobility\
    \ in the tactical\n   setting is not limited to individual nodes moving about,\
    \ but that, in\n   some cases, entire subnetworks may be moving.  An example of\
    \ this is\n   a Navy ship with multiple LANs on board, moving through the domains\n\
    \   of different RF networks.  In some cases, the RF subnet will be\n   moving,\
    \ as in the case of an aircraft strike force, or Navy\n   battlegroup.\n"
- title: Flows and Resource Reservation
  contents:
  - "Flows and Resource Reservation\n   The tactical military has very real requirements\
    \ for multi-media\n   services across its shared and inter-connected RF networks.\
    \  This\n   includes applications from digital secure voice integrated with\n\
    \   applications such as \"white boards\" and position reporting for\n   mission\
    \ planning purposes to low-latency, high priority tactical data\n   messages (target\
    \ detection, identification, location and heading\n   information).  Because of\
    \ the limited capacity of tactical RF\n   networks, resource reservation is extremely\
    \ important to control\n   access to these valuable resources.  Resource reservation\
    \ can play a\n   role in \"congestion avoidance\" for these limited resources\
    \ as well as\n   ensuring that quality-of-service data delivery requirements are\
    \ met\n   for multi-media communication.\n   Note there is more required here\
    \ than can be met by simple quality-\n   of-service (QoS) based path selection\
    \ and subsequent source-routing\n   to get real-time data such as voice delivered.\
    \  For example, to\n   support digital voice in the CSNI project, a call setup\
    \ and resource\n   reservation protocol was designed.  It was determined that\
    \ the QoS\n   mechanisms provided by the CLNP specification were not sufficient\
    \ for\n   our voice application path selection.  Voice calls could not be\n  \
    \ routed and resources reserved based on any single QoS parameter\n   (e.g., delay,\
    \ capacity, etc.) alone.  Some RF subnets in the CSNI\n   test bed simply did\
    \ not have the capability to support voice calls.\n   To perform resource reservation\
    \ for the voice calls, the CLNP cost\n   metric was \"hijacked\" as essentially\
    \ a Type of Service identifier to\n   let the router know which datagrams were\
    \ associated with a voice\n   call.  The cost metric, concatenated with the source\
    \ and destination\n   addresses were used to form a unique identifier for voice\
    \ calls in\n   the router and subnet state tables.  Voice call paths were to be\n\
    \   selected by the router (i.e. the \"cost\" metric was calculated) as a\n  \
    \ rule-based function of each subnet's capability to support voice, its\n   delay,\
    \ and its capacity.  While source routing provided a possible\n   means for voice\
    \ datagrams to find their way from router to router,\n   the network address alone\
    \ was not explicit enough to direct the data\n   to the correct interface, particularly\
    \ in cases where there were\n   multiple communication media interconnecting two\
    \ routers along the\n   path.  Fortunately, exclusive use of the cost QoS indicator\
    \ for voice\n   in CSNI was able to serve as a flag to the router for packets\n\
    \   requiring special handling.\n   While a simple Type of Service field as part\
    \ of an IPng protocol can\n   serve this purpose where there are a limited number\
    \ of well known\n   services (CSNI has a single special service - 2400 bps digital\n\
    \   voice), a more general technique such as RSVP's Flow Specification\n   can\
    \ support a larger set of such services.  And a field, such as the\n   one sometimes\
    \ referred to as a Flow Identification (Flow ID), can\n   play an important role\
    \ in facilitating inter-networked data\n   communication over these limited capacity\
    \ networks.\n   For example, the D/V ATD RF sub-network provides support for both\n\
    \   connectionless datagram delivery and virtual circuit connectivity.\n   To\
    \ utilize this capability, an IPng could establish a virtual circuit\n   connection\
    \ across this RF subnetwork which meets the requirements of\n   an RSVP Flow Specification.\
    \ By creating an association between a\n   particular Flow ID and the subnetwork\
    \ header identifying the\n   established virtual circuit, an IPng gateway could\
    \ forward data\n   across the low-capacity while removing most, if not all, of\
    \ the IPng\n   packet header information.  The receiving gateway could re- construct\n\
    \   these fields based on the Flow Specification of the particular Flow\n   ID/virtual\
    \ circuit association.\n   In summary, a field such as a Flow Identification can\
    \ serve at least\n   two important purposes:\n         1)      It can be used\
    \ by routers (or gateways) to identify\n                 packets with special,\
    \ or pre-arranged delivery\n                 requirements.  It is important to\
    \ realize that it may\n                 not always be possible to \"peek\" at\
    \ internet packet\n                 content for this information if certain security\n\
    \                 considerations are met (e.g., an encrypted transport\n     \
    \            layer).\n         2)      It can aid mapping datagram services to\
    \ different\n                 types of communication services provided by\n  \
    \               specialized subnet/data link layer protocols.\n"
- title: Multicast
  contents:
  - "Multicast\n   Tactical military communication has a very clear requirement for\n\
    \   multicast.  Efficient dissemination of information to distributed\n   warfighting\
    \ participants can be the key to success in a battle.  In\n   modern warfare,\
    \ this information includes imagery, the \"tactical\n   scene\" via tactical data\
    \ messages, messaging information, and real-\n   time interactive applications\
    \ such as digital secure voice.  Many of\n   the tactical RF communication media\
    \ are broadcast by nature, and\n   multicast routing can take advantage of this\
    \ topology to distribute\n   critical data to a large number of participants.\
    \  The throughput\n   limitations imposed by these RF media and the physics of\
    \ potential\n   electronic counter measures (ECM) dictate that this information\
    \ be\n   distributed efficiently.  A multicast architecture is the general\n \
    \  case for information flow in a tactical internetwork.\n"
- title: Quality of Service and Policy-Based Routing
  contents:
  - "Quality of Service and Policy-Based Routing\n   Quality of service and policy\
    \ based routing are of particular\n   importance in a tactical environment with\
    \ limited communication\n   resources, limited bandwidth, and possible degradation\
    \ and/or denial\n   of service.  Priority is a very important criteria in the\
    \ tactical\n   setting.  In the tactical RF world of limited resources (limited\n\
    \   bandwidth, radio assets, etc.) there will be instances when there is\n   not\
    \ sufficient capacity to provide all users with their perception of\n   required\
    \ communication capability.  It is extremely important for a\n   shared, automated\
    \ communication system to delegate capacity higher\n   priority users.  Unlike\
    \ the commercial world, where everyone has a\n   more equal footing, it is possible\
    \ in the military environment to\n   assign priority to users or even individual\
    \ datagrams.  An example of\n   this is the tactical data exchange.  Tactical\
    \ data messages are\n   generally single-datagram messages containing information\
    \ on the\n   location, bearing, identification, etc., of entities detected by\n\
    \   sensors.  In CSNI, tactical data messages were assigned 15 different\n   levels\
    \ of CLNP priority.  This ensured that important messages, such\n   as a rapidly\
    \ approaching enemy missile's trajectory, were given\n   priority over less important\
    \ messages, such as a friendly, slow-\n   moving tanker's heading.\n"
- title: Applicability
  contents:
  - "Applicability\n   There will be a significant amount of applicability to tactical\
    \ RF\n   networks.  The current IP and CLNP protocols are being given\n   considerable\
    \ attention in the tactical RF community as a means to\n   provide communication\
    \ interoperability across a large set of\n   heterogeneous RF networks in use\
    \ by different services and countries.\n   The applicability of IPng can only\
    \ improve with the inclusion of\n   features critical to supporting QoS and Policy\
    \ based routing,\n   security, real-time multi-media data delivery, and extended\n\
    \   addressing.  It must be noted that it is very important that the IPng\n  \
    \ protocol headers not grow overly large.  There is a sharp tradeoff\n   between\
    \ the value added by these headers (interoperability, global\n   addressing, etc.)\
    \ and the degree of communication performance\n   attainable on limited capacity\
    \ RF networks.  Regardless of the data\n   rate that future RF networks will be\
    \ capable of supporting, there is\n   always a tactical advantage in utilizing\
    \ your resources more\n   efficiently.\n"
- title: Datagram Service
  contents:
  - "Datagram Service\n   The datagram service paradigm provides many useful features\
    \ for\n   tactical communication networks.  The \"memory\" provided by datagram\n\
    \   headers, provides an inherent amount of survivability essential to\n   the\
    \ dynamics of the tactical communication environment.  The\n   availability of\
    \ platforms for routing and relaying is never 100%\n   certain in a tactical scenario.\
    \  The efficiency with which multi-cast\n   can be implemented in a connectionless\
    \ network is highly critical in\n   the tactical environment where rapid, efficient\
    \ information\n   dissemination can be a deciding factor.  And, as has been proven,\n\
    \   with several different Internet applications and experiments, a\n   datagram\
    \ service is capable of providing useful connection-oriented\n   and real-time\
    \ communication services.\n   Consideration should be given in IPng to how it\
    \ can co-exist with\n   other architectures such as switching fabrics which offer\
    \ demand-\n   based control over topology and connectivity.  The military owns\
    \ many\n   of its own communication resources and one of the large problems in\n\
    \   managing the military communication infrastructure is directing those\n  \
    \ underlying resources to where they are needed.  Traditional\n   management (SNMP,\
    \ etc.) is of course useful here, but RF\n   communication media can be somewhat\
    \ dynamically allocated.  Circuit\n   switching designs offer some advantages\
    \ here.  Dial-up IP routing is\n   an example of an integrated solution.  The\
    \ IPng should be capable of\n   supporting a similar type of operation.\n"
- title: Support of Communication Media
  contents:
  - "Support of Communication Media\n   The tactical communication environment includes\
    \ a very broad spectrum\n   of communication media from shipboard fiber-optic\
    \ LANs to very low\n   data rate (<2400 bps) RF links.  Many of the RF links,\
    \ even higher\n   speed ones, can exhibit error statistics not necessarily well-\n\
    \   serviced by higher layer reliable protocols (i.e., TCP).  In these\n   cases,\
    \ efficient lower layer protocols can be implemented to provide\n   reliable datagram\
    \ delivery at the link layer, but at the cost of\n   highly variable delay performance.\n\
    \   It is also important to recognize that RF communication cannot be\n   viewed\
    \ from the IPng designer as simple point-to-point  links.\n   Often, highly complex,\
    \ unique subnetwork protocols are utilized to\n   meet requirements of survivability,\
    \ communications performance with\n   limited bandwidth, anti- jam and/or low\
    \ probability of detection\n   requirements.  In some of these cases IPng will\
    \ be one of several\n   Layer 3 protocols sharing the subnetwork.\n   It is understood\
    \ that IPng cannot be the panacea of Layer 3\n   protocols, particularly when\
    \ it comes to providing special mechanisms\n   to support the endangered-specie\
    \ low data rate user.  However, note\n   that there are many valuable low data\
    \ rate applications useful to the\n   tactical user.  And low user data rates,\
    \ coupled with efficient\n   networking protocols can allow many more users share\
    \ limited RF\n   bandwidth.  As a result, any mechanisms which facilitate compression\n\
    \   of network headers can be considered highly valuable in an IPng\n   candidate.\n"
