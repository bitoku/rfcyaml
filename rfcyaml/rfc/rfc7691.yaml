- title: 1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Background\n   Section 4 of RFC 4071 [BCP101] says \"IAOC terms normally\
    \ end at the\n   end of the first IETF meeting of a year.\"  Having the terms\
    \ of the\n   IAOC members expire at the end of the first IETF meeting of the year\n\
    \   has proved impractical for the IAOC to carry out its business and to\n   elect\
    \ its Chair during the meeting week.  For a number of years, the\n   IAOC has\
    \ improvised by defaulting to an informal process of having\n   the transition\
    \ occur during the administrative plenary (as the IESG\n   does).  This informal\
    \ arrangement violates the letter of BCP 101.\n   But even this arrangement is\
    \ problematic if the transfer happens\n   after the IAOC's face-to-face meeting\
    \ takes place that week.  Under\n   the informal arrangement, the IAOC typically\
    \ meets on the morning of\n   the administrative plenary, which means that the\
    \ incoming IAOC\n   members, while present, are not seated.\n   Having the new\
    \ IAOC members take office after the face-to-face\n   meeting has caused difficulties\
    \ in the chair selection and voting\n   processes during the IAOC's face-to-face\
    \ meeting held during the same\n   week.  There has been confusion over who should\
    \ vote in the chair\n   election and on any business actions that require a vote\
    \ of the\n   Trustees.  If the incoming members are not seated, then they should\n\
    \   not vote; however, to select a chair for the next year, for example,\n   they,\
    \ more than the outgoing members, should have a say in the chair\n   selection.\
    \  There is also confusion over who is eligible to be\n   elected as chair --\
    \ if the term of an IAOC member has not yet\n   started, could that IAOC member\
    \ be elected chair (as the chair is\n   selected from among the members).  Having\
    \ the terms expire at the end\n   of the week also risks the IAOC not being able\
    \ to raise a quorum if\n   outgoing members decide to not come to the meeting.\
    \  Because the IAOC\n   members are the Trustees of the IETF Trust, the same issues\
    \ arise\n   with the IETF Trust and its ability to carry out its business and\n\
    \   elect a Chair during the meeting week.\n   An additional issue with BCP 101\
    \ is the current definition of the\n   term length of the IAOC Chair.  RFC 4071\
    \ [BCP101] says \"The term of\n   the IAOC chair shall be one year from the time\
    \ of selection or the\n   remaining time of his or her tenure on the IAOC, whichever\
    \ is less.\"\n   Because the dates for the first IETF meeting of the year vary\
    \ from\n   year to year, the current BCP 101 text could result in there being\
    \ no\n   IAOC chair for weeks before the a meeting or in overlapping terms for\n\
    \   IAOC Chairs.\n"
- title: 2.  Updates to BCP 101
  contents:
  - "2.  Updates to BCP 101\n   This memo updates Section 4 of RFC 4071 [BCP101] to\
    \ remove the\n   following sentence:\n      IAOC terms normally end at the end\
    \ of the first IETF meeting of a\n      year.\n   Furthermore, the following requirements\
    \ are added:\n   1. The IAOC and the IETF Trust each hold a regular meeting close\
    \ to\n      the time of, or during, the first IETF meeting of the year.\n   2.\
    \ The IAOC and the Trust select their chairs as the first order of\n      business\
    \ in their individual meetings in a manner of their\n      choosing.\n   3. The\
    \ IAOC determines the beginning and end of the normal terms of\n      its members\
    \ relative to the above mentioned IAOC meeting; such\n      terms must start and\
    \ end close to the time of this meeting, unless\n      those determinations are\
    \ made by the appointing bodies.\n   A regular meeting has proper notice, minutes\
    \ that are posted, and may\n   be held face-to-face, via teleconference, or as\
    \ a combination of the\n   two.\n"
