The AX.25 Amateur Packet Radio Link Layer Protocol
Amateur Packet Radio Link Layer Protocol is described in the publication by that name [1], incorporated here by reference.
Each AX.25 packet ("frame") is encapsulated in one IP datagram.
Normally no AX.25 frame will exceed 330 octets, so fragmentation at the IP layer should not be necessary.
However, experiments with larger AX.25 frame sizes may require the use of standard IP fragmentation and reassembly procedures.
When an AX.25 frame is encapsulated within an IP packet, HDLC framing elements (flags and zero stuffing) are omitted, as the IP datagram adequately delimits the beginning and end of each AX.25 frame.
The 16 bit CRC CCITT frame check sequence (normally generated by the HDLC transmission hardware) is included.
In all other respects, AX.25 frames are encapsulated unaltered.
Each such IP datagram shall have a protocol number of 93.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
