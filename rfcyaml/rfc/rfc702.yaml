  - "         SEPTEMBER, 1974, SURVEY OF NEW-PROTOCOL TELNET SERVERS\nLAST MONTH'S\
    \ SURVEY PRODUCED A GRATIFYING AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK CLARIFYING\nTHE STATUS OF SEVERAL\
    \ SITES; HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW CHANGES IN\nTHE STATUS OF HOST SERVERS.\
    \  THE CHANGES IN THIS MONTH'S LIST, IN\nNUMERICAL ORDER (HOST NUMBER THROUGHOUT\
    \ ARE OCTAL):\nUCLA-NMC IS NO LONGER A SERVER;\nHOST 205 IS NOW BBN-TENEXD, A\
    \ NEW SYSTEM (BBNB) IS NOW HOST 61;\nRAND-RCC WAS ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED FROM THE\
    \ PREVIOUS LIST;\nSDC-LAB HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY ELIMINATED FROM THE LIST UNTIL\
    \ IT RETURNS\n    TO THE NET;\nI4-TENEXA (117) IS NOT A SERVER--KI4B-TENEX (217)\
    \ IS, AND HAS BEEN ADDED\n    TO THE LIST;\nAMES-67 FIXED A BUG, REVEALING TO\
    \ THE WORLD THE NEW-PROTOCOL SERVER (NO\n    OPTIONS) THAT WAS THERE ALL ALONG;\n\
    ISI-DEVTENEX (226) AND USC-ECL (327) HAVE BEEN ADDED.\nWHAT FOLLOWS IS AN UPDATE\
    \ OF THE SUMMARY AND TABULATION THAT APPEARED\nLAST MONTH.*  THERE IS STILL A\
    \ LONG WAY TO GO TO 100% NEW-PROTOCOL\nIMPLEMENTATION.\n        TOTAL SERVER HOSTS\
    \            34             100%\n        NO NEW-PROT SERVER            21   \

    \           18%\n          NEW-PROT ON 1 AND 27 (3)     6              18%\n \
    \         NEW-PROT ON 1 ONLY           1               3%\nNOTES:\n*   ALL DATA\
    \ IN THIS REPORT WERE GATHERED VIA A SURVEYING PROGRAM RUN AT\n    VARIOUS TIMES,\
    \ PLUS A FEW MANUAL CHECKS TO FILL OUT THE DATA.  WHAT\n    IS REPORTED HERE IS\
    \ THE WAY THE VARIOUS SERVERS WORK AS SEEN BY THE\n    NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNET\
    \ AT BBNA, AS OF 23 SEPT. 1974.\n(2) THESE ARE THE SITES WHOSE OPERATION IS 100%\
    \ CORRECT ACCORDING TO ALL\n    PROTOCOL AND CONVENTIONS, AS I UNDERSTAND THEM.\n\
    (3) WE REALIZE THAT SOME OF THE SERVERS THAT APPEAR HERE AS NEW-PROTOCOL\n   \
    \ SERVERS ON SOCKET 1 ARE ACTUALLY SERVERS WHICH ATTEMPT TO\n    COMMUNICATE WITH\
    \ BOTH OLD- AND NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNETS ACCORDING\n    TO WHAT CONTROL SEQUENCES\
    \ ARE RECEIVED.\n           TABULATION OF SERVER STATUS FOR ALL SERVER SITES:\n\
