  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 5443 describes a mechanism to achieve LDP IGP synchronization\
    \ to\n   prevent black-holing traffic (e.g., VPN) when an Interior Gateway\n \
    \  Protocol (IGP) is operational on a link but Label Distribution\n   Protocol\
    \ (LDP) is not.  If this mechanism is applied to broadcast\n   links that have\
    \ more than one LDP peer, the metric increase procedure\n   can only be applied\
    \ to the link as a whole but not to an individual\n   peer.  When a new LDP peer\
    \ comes up on a broadcast network, this can\n   result in loss of traffic through\
    \ other established peers on that\n   network.  This document describes a mechanism\
    \ to address that use-\n   case without dropping traffic.  The mechanism does\
    \ not introduce any\n   protocol message changes.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In RFC 5443 [LDP-IGP-SYNC], when [LDP] is not fully operational\
    \ on a\n   link, the IGP advertises the link with maximum cost to avoid any\n\
    \   transit traffic on the link if possible.  When LDP becomes\n   operational,\
    \ i.e., all the label bindings have been exchanged, the\n   link is advertised\
    \ with its correct cost.  This tries to ensure that\n   the LDP Label Switch Path\
    \ (LSP) is available all along the IGP\n   shortest path.  The mechanisms in [LDP-IGP-SYNC]\
    \ have limitations\n   when applied to a broadcast link.  These are described\
    \ in Section 3.\n   A solution is defined in Section 4.\n"

- title: 3.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   On broadcast networks, a router's Link State Advertisement\
    \ (LSA)\n   contains a single cost to the broadcast network rather than a\n  \
    \ separate cost to each peer on the broadcast network.  The operation\n   of the\
    \ mechanism in [LDP-IGP-SYNC] is analyzed using the sample\n   topology in Figure\
    \ 1, where routers A, B, C, and E are attached to a\n   common broadcast network.\
    \  Say all links in that topology have a cost\n   of 1 except the link A-PE3,\
    \ which has a cost of 10.  The use-case\n   when router B's link to the broadcast\
    \ network comes up is analyzed.\n   Before that link comes up, traffic between\
    \ PE1 and PE2 flows along\n   the bi-directional path PE1-A-C-D-PE2, and traffic\
    \ between PE1 and\n   PE3 flows along the bi-directional path PE1-A-E-PE3.\n \

    \ 1: LDP IGP Sync on a Broadcast Network\n   In one interpretation of the applicability\
    \ of [LDP-IGP-SYNC] to\n   broadcast networks, when a new router is discovered\
    \ on a broadcast\n   network, that network should avoid transit traffic until\
    \ LDP becomes\n   operational between all routers on that network.  This can be\n\
    \   achieved by having all the attached routers advertise maximum cost to\n  \
    \ that network.  This should result in traffic that is being sent via\n   that\
    \ broadcast network to be diverted.  However, traffic might be\n   inadvertently\
    \ diverted to the link that just came up.  Until LDP\n   becomes operational,\
    \ that traffic will be black-holed.  An additional\n   problem is route churn\
    \ in the entire network that results in traffic\n   that should be unaffected\
    \ taking sub-optimal paths until the high-\n   cost metric is reverted to the\
    \ normal cost.  In Figure 1, when B's\n   link to the broadcast network comes\
    \ up and it is discovered by\n   routers A, C and E, then A, B, C, and E can all\
    \ start advertising\n   maximum cost to the broadcast network.  A will have B\
    \ as next-hop to\n   PE2 and will not have a LDP LSP to PE2, resulting in VPN\
    \ traffic from\n   PE1 to PE2 to be black-holed at A.  The route churn at A also\
    \ results\n   in traffic between PE1 and PE3 to be unnecessarily diverted to the\n\
    \   sub-optimal path PE1-A-PE3 until the maximum-cost advertisement is\n   reverted\
    \ to the normal cost.\n   This interpretation has the additional complexity of\
    \ requiring the\n   maximum-cost advertisement to be reverted by all routers after\
    \ LDP\n   peering between all the routers on the broadcast network is\n   operational.\
    \  This is non-trivial and needs coordination between all\n   the routers.\n \
    \  In another alternative interpretation of the applicability of\n   [LDP-IGP-SYNC]\
    \ to broadcast networks, only the router whose link to\n   the broadcast network\
    \ comes up advertises maximum cost for that link,\n   but other routers continue\
    \ to advertise the normal cost.  In Figure\n   1, when B's link to the broadcast\
    \ network comes up, it advertises a\n   high cost to the broadcast network.  After\
    \ the IGP has converged but\n   the LDP peering A-B is not yet operational, A\
    \ will have B as the\n   next-hop for PE2 and will not have a LDP LSP to PE2.\
    \  Since A's cost\n   to reach B is not high, A-B-PE2 becomes the shortest path.\
    \  VPN\n   traffic from PE1 to PE2 will be dropped at A.\n"
- title: 4.  Solution
  contents:
  - "4.  Solution\n   The problem described above exists because the Link State Database\n\
    \   (LSDB) of the IGP does not describe a link coming up on a broadcast\n   network\
    \ with a high bi-directional cost to all other routers on that\n   broadcast network.\
    \  A broadcast network is advertised as a pseudonode\n   containing a list of\
    \ routers to which the broadcast network is\n   connected, and the cost of all\
    \ these links from the pseudonode to\n   each router is zero when computing SPF\
    \ (Shortest Path First).\n   The solution proposed below removes the link that\
    \ is coming up from\n   the LSDB unless absolutely necessary.  Only the router\
    \ whose link is\n   coming up plays a role in ensuring this.  The other routers\
    \ on the\n   broadcast network are not involved.  The following text describes\n\
    \   this in more detail.\n   During the intra-area SPF algorithm execution, an\
    \ additional\n   computation is made to detect an alternate path to a directly\n\
    \   connected network that does not have any IGP adjacencies.\n   If a router\
    \ has a directly connected network that does not have an\n   alternate path to\
    \ reach it, then the interface to that network is a\n   \"cut-edge\" in the topology\
    \ for that router.  When a \"cut-edge\" goes\n   down, the network is partitioned\
    \ into two disjoint sub-graphs.  This\n   property of whether or not an interface\
    \ is a \"cut-edge\" is used when\n   an IGP adjacency comes up on that interface.\
    \  The method to determine\n   whether an interface is a \"cut-edge\" is described\
    \ in Appendix A.\n   During IGP procedures, when the router's first adjacency\
    \ to the\n   broadcast network is coming up and the LSA is about to be updated\n\
    \   with a link to the pseudonode of the broadcast interface, a check is\n   made\
    \ whether that interface is a \"cut-edge\".  If it is not a\n   \"cut-edge\",\
    \ then the updating of the LSA with that link to the\n   pseudonode is postponed\
    \ until LDP is operational with all the LDP\n   peers on that broadcast interface.\
    \  After LDP is operational, the LSA\n   is updated with that link to the pseudonode\
    \ (and the LSA is flooded).\n   If the interface is a \"cut-edge\", then the updating\
    \ of the LSA MUST\n   NOT be delayed by LDP's operational state.  Note that the\
    \ IGP and LDP\n   adjacency bring-up procedures are unchanged.  The conditional\
    \ check\n   of whether the interface is a \"cut-edge\" must be done just before\
    \ the\n   adjacency is about to be reflected in the LSA.\n   If the IGP is [OSPF],\
    \ the Router-LSA is not updated with a \"Link Type\n   2\" (link to transit network)\
    \ for that subnet until LDP is operational\n   with all neighboring routers on\
    \ that subnet.\n   Similarly, if the IGP is [IS-IS], the \"Link State PDU\" is\
    \ updated\n   with an \"IS Reachability TLV\" (or an \"Extended IS Reachability\
    \ TLV\")\n   to the pseudonode after LDP is operational with all neighboring\n\
    \   routers on that subnet.\n   Note that this solution can be introduced in a\
    \ gradual manner in a\n   network without any backward compatibility issues.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Scope\n   This document is agnostic to the method that detects LDP to be\n\
    \   operational with a neighbor.  It does not define any new method to\n   detect\
    \ that LDP is operational.  At the time of publishing this\n   document, LDP End-of-LIB\
    \ [LDP-EOL] seems to be the preferred method.\n   Issues arising out of LDP not\
    \ being configured on some routers or on\n   some interfaces are not specific\
    \ to the method described in this\n   document and are considered outside the\
    \ scope of this solution.\n"
- title: 6.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "6.  Applicability\n   The method described in this document can be easily extended\
    \ to\n   point-to-point (P2P) links.  However, an implementation may continue\n\
    \   to apply the method described in [LDP-IGP-SYNC] to P2P links but\n   apply\
    \ the method described in this document to broadcast networks.\n   Both methods\
    \ can coexist in a network.\n   The techniques used in this document's solution\
    \ enable LDP IGP\n   synchronization in many scenarios where one end of the IGP\
    \ adjacency\n   does not support any LDP IGP sync method.  This is an optional\n\
    \   benefit and is for further study.  Some ways to apply this technique\n   to\
    \ achieve that benefit are discussed in Appendix B.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce any new security\
    \ considerations\n   beyond those already described in [LDP-IGP-SYNC].\n   Note\
    \ that in [LDP-IGP-SYNC], when a link is advertised with a high\n   metric, an\
    \ alternate path with a large number of hops can result in\n   the end-to-end\
    \ path having more than 255 hops and thus result in\n   unreachability.  This\
    \ fact could be exploited if control of metrics\n   falls into the hands of an\
    \ attacker.\n   This problem can even exist in a plain IP network with a link-state\n\
    \   IGP.  If the directly connected path has a higher metric than an\n   alternate\
    \ path with Time to Live (TTL) greater than 255 hops, then\n   the standard SPF\
    \ algorithm will conclude that the shortest path is\n   the alternate path although\
    \ the neighboring node is unreachable\n   through this path.  In this case, the\
    \ link is advertised with its\n   normal metric yet there is unreachability in\
    \ the network.  Thus, this\n   document does not introduce any new issues beyond\
    \ those in a standard\n   IGP-based IP network, and operators need to apply policy\
    \ and security\n   to the techniques used to determine and distribute the metrics\
    \ used\n   on links in their networks.\n"
- title: 8.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "8.  Conclusions\n   This document complements [LDP-IGP-SYNC] by providing a solution\
    \ to\n   achieve LDP IGP synchronization for broadcast networks.  It can also\n\
    \   coexist with that solution in a network that has a combination of P2P\n  \
    \ links and broadcast networks.  It can also be introduced into a\n   network\
    \ without backward compatibility issues.  The solution in this\n   document can\
    \ also be used exclusively to achieve LDP IGP\n   synchronization since this solution\
    \ applies to both P2P links and\n   broadcast networks.\n   This solution also\
    \ has useful properties that can be optionally used\n   to achieve LDP IGP synchronization\
    \ when only one end of the IGP\n   adjacency supports this solution but the other\
    \ end supports neither\n   this solution nor the one in [LDP-IGP-SYNC].\n"

- title: Appendix B.  Sync without Support at One End
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Sync without Support at One End\n   A useful property of the solution\
    \ described in this document is that\n   LDP IGP synchronization is achievable\
    \ in many scenarios where one end\n   of the IGP adjacency does not support any\
    \ LDP IGP sync method.\n   For P2P links (or broadcast links on which the IGP\
    \ operates in P2P\n   mode) the applicability is straightforward.  An IGP can\
    \ establish a\n   P2P adjacency on a P2P link or a broadcast link with the IGP\
    \ in P2P\n   mode.  When a P2P adjacency comes up, the end of the adjacency that\n\
    \   supports the solution in this document would not advertise the link\n   to\
    \ the other router in its LSA unless the edge is a \"cut-edge\" or\n   until LDP\
    \ becomes operational.  Hence, neither of the two routers\n   will have IGP next-hop\
    \ as the other router unless the link is a\n   \"cut-edge\".  Consider Figure\
    \ 1 modified such that the broadcast\n   network is replaced by P2P links between\
    \ each of A, B, C, and E.  Say\n   link A-B is coming up, but only A has implemented\
    \ the solution in\n   this document whereas B has implemented neither the solution\
    \ in this\n   document nor the solution in [LDP-IGP-SYNC].  Since A's LSA does\
    \ not\n   advertise a link to B until LDP is operational, B does not have A as\n\
    \   next-hop.  After LDP is operational, A advertises the link to B in\n   its\
    \ LSA.  Hence, there is no traffic loss due to LDP LSP not being\n   present.\n\
    \   For broadcast networks, the applicability is not straightforward and\n   should\
    \ be considered a topic for future study.  One way is for the\n   designated router\
    \ (DR) to stop advertising the link in the pseudonode\n   to the router whose\
    \ link is coming up until LDP is operational.\n"
