  - "1.   Introduction\n   In an MPLS or IP network, it is possible to use control
    protocols\n   such as those specified in [RFC4447] to set up \"pseudowires\" (PWs)\n
    \  that carry the Protocol Data Units of layer 2 protocols across the\n   network.
    \ A number of these emulated PWs may be carried in a single\n   tunnel.  The main
    functions required to support frame relay PW by a\n   Provider Edge (PE) include:\n
    \  - encapsulation of frame relay specific information in a suitable\n     pseudowire
    (PW) packet;\n   - transfer of a PW packet across an MPLS network for delivery
    to a\n     peer PE;\n   - extraction of frame relay specific information from
    a PW packet by\n     the remote peer PE;\n   - regeneration of native frame relay
    frames for forwarding across an\n     egress port of the remote peer PE; and\n
    \  - execution of any other operations as required to support frame\n     relay
    service.\n   This document specifies the encapsulation for the emulated frame\n
    \  relay VC over an MPLS PSN.  Although different layer 2 protocols\n   require
    different information to be carried in this encapsulation, an\n   attempt has
    been made to make the encapsulation as common as possible\n   for all layer 2
    protocols.  Other layer 2 protocols are described in\n   separate documents.  [ATM]
    [RFC4448] [RFC4618]\n   The following figure describes the reference models that
    are derived\n   from [RFC3985] to support the frame relay PW emulated services.\n

    one\n   pseudowire.  The second mapping is called \"many-to-one\" mapping or\n
    \  \"port mode\" because multiple frame relay VCs assigned to a port are\n   mapped
    to one pseudowire.  The \"port mode\" encapsulation is identical\n   to High-Level

  - "5.  Applicability Statement\n   Frame relay over PW service is not intended to
    emulate the\n   traditional frame relay service perfectly, but it can be used
    for\n   applications that need frame relay transport service.\n   The following
    are notable differences between traditional frame relay\n   service and the protocol
    described in this document:\n   - Frame ordering can be preserved using the OPTIONAL
    sequence field\n     in the control word; however, implementations are not required
    to\n     support this feature.\n   - The Quality of Service model for traditional
    frame relay can be\n     emulated; however, this is outside the scope of this
    document.\n   - A Frame relay port mode PW does not process any frame relay status\n
    \    messages or alarms as described in [Q922] [Q933]\n   - The frame relay BECN
    and FECN bit are transparent to the MPLS\n     network and cannot reflect the
    status of the MPLS network.\n   - Support for frame relay SVC and Switched Permanent
    Virtual Circuit\n     (SPVC) is outside the scope of this document.\n   - Frame
    relay Local Management Interface (LMI) is terminated locally\n     in the PE connected
    to the frame relay attachment circuit.\n   - The support of PVC link integrity
    check is outside the scope of\n     this document.\n"

      frame\n      size (a notable example is Ethernet), padding is required to reach\n

      of the layer 2 payload plus the length of the control word)\n      is less than
      64 octets, the length field MUST be set to the PW\n      payload length.  Otherwise,
      the length field MUST be set to zero.\n      The value of the length field,

      \  - Sequence number (Bit 16 to 31)\n      Sequence numbers provide one possible
      mechanism to ensure the\n      ordered delivery of PW packets.  The processing
      of the sequence\n      number field is OPTIONAL.  The sequence number space
      is a 16-bit\n      unsigned circular space.  The sequence number value 0 is

- contents:
  - "9.  Congestion Control\n   As explained in [RFC3985], the PSN carrying the PW
    may be subject to\n   congestion, the characteristics of which depend on PSN type,
    network\n   architecture, configuration, and loading.  During congestion, the
    PSN\n   may exhibit packet loss that will impact the service carried by the\n
    \  frame relay PW.  In addition, since frame relay PWs carry a variety\n   of
    services across the PSN, including but not restricted to TCP/IP,\n   they may
    or may not behave in a TCP-friendly manner prescribed by\n   [RFC2914].  In the
    presence of services that reduce transmission\n   rate, frame relay PWs may thus
    consume more than their fair share and\n   in that case SHOULD be halted.\n   Whenever
    possible, frame relay PWs should be run over traffic-\n   engineered PSNs providing
    bandwidth allocation and admission control\n   mechanisms.  IntServ-enabled domains
    providing the Guaranteed Service\n   (GS) or DiffServ-enabled domains using EF
    (expedited forwarding) are\n   examples of traffic-engineered PSNs.  Such PSNs
    will minimize loss\n   and delay while providing some degree of isolation of the
    frame relay\n   PW's effects from neighboring streams.\n   Note that when transporting
    frame relay, DiffServ-enabled domains may\n   use AF (Assured Forwarding) and/or
    DF (Default Forwarding) instead of\n   EF, in order to place less burden on the
    network and to gain\n   additional statistical multiplexing advantage.  In particular,
    if the\n   Committed Information Rate (CIR) of a frame relay VC is zero, then
    it\n   is equivalent to a best-effort UDP over IP stream regarding\n   congestion:
    \ the network is free to drop frames as necessary.  In\n   this case, the \"DF\"
    Per Hop Behavior (PHB) would be appropriate in a\n   diff-serv-TE domain.  Alternatively,
    if the CIR of a frame relay VC\n   is nonzero and the DE bit is zero in the FR
    header, then \"AF31\" would\n   be appropriate to be used, and if the CIR of a
    frame relay VC is\n   nonzero but the DE bit is on, then \"AF32\" would be appropriate\n
    \  [RFC3270].\n   The PEs SHOULD monitor for congestion (by using explicit congestion\n
    \  notification, [VCCV], or by measuring packet loss) in order to ensure\n   that
    the service using the frame relay PW may be maintained.  When a\n   PE detects
    significant congestion while receiving the PW PDUs, the\n   BECN bits of the frame
    relay frame transmitted on the same PW SHOULD\n   be set to notify the remote
    PE and the remote frame relay switch of\n   the congestion situation.  In addition,
    the FECN bits SHOULD be set\n   in the FR frames sent out the attachment circuit,
    to give the FR DTE\n   a chance to adjust its transport layer advertised window,
    if\n   possible.\n   If the PW has been set up using the protocol defined in [RFC4447],\n
    \  then procedures specified in [RFC4447] for status notification can be\n   used
    to disable packet transmission on the ingress PE from the egress\n   PE.  The
    PW may be restarted by manual intervention, or by automatic\n   means after an
    appropriate waiting time.\n"
