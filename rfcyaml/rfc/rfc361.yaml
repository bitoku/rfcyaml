  - "     In response to RFCs 347 and 348, ECHO and DISCARD, MIT-DMCG\n(Host 106)\
    \ now has deamon processes that will respond to RFCs on\nsockets 7 and 9.\n  \
    \   A few administrative type decisions were made, to which I\nwould like to solicit\
    \ comments.\n     First, if our machine is too full to support another deamon\n\
    process, the pro-offered connection will be refused;  that is, a\nCLS will be\
    \ sent in response to the RFC on socket 7 or 9.\nSecond, if no activity takes\
    \ place for two consecutive minutes\n(no characters received on input, or output\
    \ blocked waiting for\nallocation), the connection will be aborted.\n     Does\
    \ anyone see the need or desirability for the third\nservice in this set:  a random\
    \ character generator?  Many systems\nprovide programs like \"TTYTST\" available\
    \ over the standard login\nconnection, but there would be no difficulty in creating\
    \ a server\nconnection (like ECHO) offering just this limited service.  I'm\n\
    sure that it would be useful for new NCPs, as well as statistics\ngathering.\n\
