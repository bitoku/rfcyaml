- title: 2.1.  VPLS
  contents:
  - "2.1.  VPLS\n   VPLS [RFC4761] [RFC4762] is an L2VPN service that provides\n \
    \  multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity for Ethernet across an IP or\n   MPLS-enabled\
    \ IP Packet Switched Network (IP/MPLS PSN).  VPLS emulates\n   the Ethernet VLAN\
    \ functionality of traditional Ethernet networks.\n   Thus, in VPLS, the customer\
    \ Ethernet frame is transported over the\n   IP/MPLS PSN from the ingress Provider\
    \ Edge (PE) to the egress PE\n   where the destination is connected based on the\
    \ Ethernet frame\n   destination Media Access Control (MAC) address in the context\
    \ of the\n   virtual switching instance (VSI) to which it belongs.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Ethernet Virtual Private Network (E-VPN)
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Ethernet Virtual Private Network (E-VPN)\n   E-VPN is an enhanced L2 service\
    \ that emulates an Ethernet VLAN across\n   an IP/MPLS PSN, primarily targeted\
    \ to support large scale L2VPNs with\n   resiliency requirements not satisfied\
    \ by other L2VPN solutions.\n   E-VPN is currently under development.  Please\
    \ refer to [EVPN].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  MEF Multipoint Ethernet Services\n   MEF has defined two multipoint Ethernet\
    \ service types:\n      - E-LAN (Ethernet LAN), multipoint-to-multipoint service\n\
    \      - E-Tree (Ethernet Tree), rooted-multipoint service\n   For the full specifications,\
    \ please refer to [MEF6.1] and [MEF10.2].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Similarities between E-LAN and E-Tree
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Similarities between E-LAN and E-Tree\n   The following are the similarities\
    \ between E-LAN and E-Tree services.\n      - Data frame is an Ethernet frame.\n\
    \      - Data forwarding is MAC-based forwarding.\n      - A generic E-LAN/E-Tree\
    \ service is always bidirectional in the\n        sense that ingress frames can\
    \ originate at any endpoint in the\n        service.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Differences between E-LAN and E-Tree
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Differences between E-LAN and E-Tree\n   Within the context of a multipoint\
    \ Ethernet service, each endpoint is\n   designated as either a Root or a Leaf.\
    \  A Root can communicate with\n   all other endpoints in the same multipoint\
    \ Ethernet service; however,\n   a Leaf can only communicate with Roots but not\
    \ Leaves.\n   The only differences between E-LAN and E-Tree are:\n      - E-LAN\
    \ has Root endpoints only, which implies there is no\n        communication restriction\
    \ between endpoints.\n      - E-Tree has both Root and Leaf endpoints, which implies\
    \ there is\n        a need to enforce communication restriction between Leaf\n\
    \        endpoints.\n"

- title: 3.4.  Generic E-Tree Service
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Generic E-Tree Service\n   A generic E-Tree service supports multiple Root\
    \ endpoints.  The need\n   for multiple Root endpoints is usually driven by a\
    \ redundancy\n   requirement.  Whether a particular E-Tree service needs to support\n\
    \   single or multiple Roots depends on the target application.\n   A generic\
    \ E-Tree service supports all the following traffic flows:\n      - Ethernet Unicast\
    \ from Root to Leaf\n      - Ethernet Unicast from Leaf to Root\n      - Ethernet\
    \ Unicast from Root to Root\n      - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Root to\
    \ other Roots and Leaves\n      - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Leaf to Roots\n\
    \   A particular E-Tree service may need to support all the above or only\n  \
    \ a subset depending on the target application.\n"

  contents:

    \ PSN.\n   Service providers also require E-Tree support in L2VPN.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction\n   In this section, VPLS is used\
    \ to illustrate the problem; however, the\n   same principle applies to other\
    \ L2VPN technologies.\n   VPLS treats all attachment circuits (ACs) equally (essentially\
    \ as\n   Roots, although they not classified into Root or Leaf) and provides\n\
    \   any-to-any connectivity among all ACs.  VPLS does not include any\n   mechanism\
    \ for communication restriction between specific ACs.\n   Therefore, it is insufficient\
    \ for emulating generic E-Tree service\n   over an IP/MPLS PSN.\n   As an example\
    \ of the problems not addressed in VPLS solutions,\n   consider the scenario in\
    \ Figure 1 where there are two PEs, each with\n   a Root AC and a Leaf AC and\
    \ where VPLS is used to emulate an E-Tree\n   service interconnecting these ACs\

    \ Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction\n   When PE2 receives a frame from PE1\
    \ via the Ethernet pseudowire (PW),\n      - PE2 does not know which AC on PE1\
    \ is the ingress AC\n      - PE2 does not know whether or not the ingress AC is\
    \ a Leaf AC\n      - PE2 does not have sufficient information to enforce the Leaf-to-\n\
    \        Leaf communication restriction\n   Examples where the problems arise:\n\
    \      - Customer Edge 2 (CE2) sends a Broadcast/Multicast Ethernet frame\n  \
    \      to PE1 via AC2\n      - CE2 sends a Unicast Ethernet frame to PE1 via AC2\
    \ with a\n        destination MAC address corresponding to CE4's MAC address\n\
    \   Note: Figure 1 is a hypothetical case solely used for explaining the\n   problem;\
    \ it is not meant to represent a typical E-Tree service.\n   There are some possible\
    \ ways to get around this problem that do not\n   require extensions to existing\
    \ VPLS solutions, but they all come with\n   significant design complexity or\
    \ deployment constraints.\n"

  - "A.1.  Are E-Tree Requirements Addressed in the Virtual Private Multicast\n  \
    \    Service (VPMS) Requirements?\n   VPMS requirements are defined in [VPMS].\n\
    \   The focus of VPMS is to provide point-to-multipoint connectivity.\n   VPMS\
    \ provides single coverage of receiver membership (i.e., there is\n   no distinct\
    \ differentiation for multiple multicast groups).  A VPMS\n   service supports\
    \ single or multiple Root ACs.  All traffic from a\n   Root AC will be forwarded\
    \ to all Leaf ACs (i.e., Point-to-Multipoint\n   (P2MP), from Root to all Leaves).\
    \  The destination address in an\n   Ethernet frame is not used in data forwarding.\
    \  As an optional\n   capability, a VPMS service may support reverse traffic from\
    \ a Leaf AC\n   to a Root AC (i.e., point-to-point (P2P), from Leaf to Root).\n\
    \   In contrast, the focus of MEF E-Tree is that a Leaf can only\n   communicate\
    \ with Roots, not Leaves.\n   A generic MEF E-Tree service supports multiple Root\
    \ endpoints.\n   Whether a particular E-Tree service needs to support single or\n\
    \   multiple Root endpoints depends on the target application.\n   As discussion\
    \ in a previous section, a generic MEF E-Tree service\n   supports all the following\
    \ traffic flows:\n      - Ethernet Unicast bidirectional Root to/from Root\n \
    \     - Ethernet Unicast bidirectional Root to/from Leaf\n      - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast\
    \ unidirectional Root to all Roots\n        and Leaves\n      - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast\
    \ unidirectional Leaf to all Roots\n   A particular E-Tree service may need to\
    \ support all the above or only\n   a subset depending on the target application.\n\
    \   The IETF's VPMS definition and MEF's E-Tree definition are\n   significantly\
    \ different.\n   VPMS may be acceptable in cases where E-Tree service is needed,\
    \ such\n   as in the following cases:\n      - No Unicast traffic from Root destined\
    \ for a specific Leaf (or\n        there is no concern if such Unicast traffic\
    \ is forwarded to all\n        Leaves)\n      - No traffic between Roots\n   For\
    \ generic E-Tree service, VPMS will not be able to meet the\n   requirements.\n"
