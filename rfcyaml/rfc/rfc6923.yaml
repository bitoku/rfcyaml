  - contents:
    - "1.3.  Notational Conventions\n   This document uses the notational conventions
      laid out in [RFC6370]:\n      All multiple-word atomic identifiers use underscores
      (_) between\n      the words to join the words.  Many of the identifiers are
      composed\n      of a set of other identifiers.  These are expressed by listing
      the\n      latter identifiers joined with double-colon \"::\" notation.\n      Where
      the same identifier type is used multiple times in a\n      concatenation, they
      are qualified by a prefix joined to the\n      identifier by a dash (-).  For
      example, A1-Node_ID is the Node_ID\n      of a node referred to as A1.\n      The
      notation defines a preferred ordering of the fields.\n      Specifically, the
      designation A1 is used to indicate the lower\n      sort order of a field or
      set of fields and Z9 is used to indicate\n      the higher sort order of the
      same.  The sort is either\n      alphanumeric or numeric depending on the field's
      definition.\n      Where the sort applies to a group of fields, those fields
      are\n      grouped with {...}.\n      Note, however, that the uniqueness of
      an identifier does not\n      depend on the ordering, but rather, upon the uniqueness
      and\n      scoping of the fields that compose the identifier.  Further, the\n
      \     preferred ordering is not intended to constrain protocol designs\n      by
      dictating a particular field sequence ... or even what fields\n      appear
      in which objects.\n"

    those\n   defined in [RFC6370].  The identifiers in [RFC6370] are composed of
    a\n   set of atomic identifiers, and this document defines some new atomic\n   identifiers
    that can be substituted for some of those that have\n   already been defined,
    to create new identifiers.  The set of\n   identifiers defined in [RFC6370] is:\n

  - "3.  Uniquely Identifying an Operator -- the ICC_Operator_ID\n   In [RFC6370],
    an operator is uniquely identified by the Global_ID,\n   which is based on the
    Autonomous System (AS) number of the operator.\n   The ITU-T, however, traditionally
    identifies operators and service\n   providers based on the ITU Carrier Code (ICC)
    as specified in\n   [M1400].\n   The ITU-T Telecommunication Standardization Bureau
    (TSB) maintains a\n   list of assigned ICCs [ICC-list].  Note that ICCs, all of
    which are\n   referenced at [ICC-list], can be assigned to ITU-T members as well
    as\n   non-members.  The national regulatory authorities act as an\n   intermediary
    between the ITU/TSB and operators/service providers.\n   One of the things that
    the national authorities are responsible for\n   in the process of assigning an
    ICC is to ensure that the Carrier\n   Codes are unique within their country.  This
    uniqueness assumption is\n   the basis for creating a globally unique ICC-based
    operator ID.\n   The ICC itself is a string of one to six characters, each character\n
    \  being either alphabetic (i.e., A-Z) or numeric (i.e., 0-9).\n   Alphabetic
    characters in the ICC SHOULD be represented with uppercase\n   letters.\n   Global
    uniqueness is assured by concatenating the ICC with a Country\n   Code (CC).  The
    Country Code (alpha-2) is a string of two alphabetic\n   characters represented
    with uppercase letters (i.e., A-Z).\n   The International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO) establishes\n   internationally recognized codes for the representation
    of names of\n   countries, territories or areas of geographical interest, and
    their\n   subdivisions, published as a list of CCs [CC-list] in ISO Standard\n
    \  3166-1 [ISO3166-1].\n   The ICC and CC characters are coded according to ITU-T
    Recommendation\n   T.50 [T.50].\n   Together, the CC and the ICC form the ICC_Operator_ID
    as:\n      CC::ICC\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Use of the ICC_Operator_ID\n   The ICC_Operator_ID is used as a replacement
      for the Global_ID as\n   specified in [RFC6370], i.e., its purpose is to provide
      a globally\n   unique context for other MPLS-TP identifiers.\n   As an example,
      an Interface Identifier (IF_ID) in [RFC6370] is\n   specified as the concatenation
      of the Node_ID (a unique 32-bit value\n   assigned by the operator) and the
      Interface Number (IF_Num, a 32-bit\n   unsigned integer assigned by the operator
      that is unique within the\n   scope of a Node_ID).  To make this IF_ID globally
      unique, the\n   Global_ID is prefixed.  This memo specifies the ICC_Operator_ID
      as an\n   alternative format that, just like the Global_ID, is prefixed to the\n
      \  IF_ID.  Using the notation from RFC 6370 [RFC6370]:\n      Global_ID::Node_ID::IF_Num\n
      \  is functionally equivalent to:\n      ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID::IF_Num\n
      \  The same substitution procedure applies to all identifiers specified\n   in
      [RFC6370] with the exception of the MEG ID, MEP ID, and MIP ID.\n   MEG, MEP,
      and MIP Identifiers are redefined in this document (see\n   Sections 7.1, 7.2,
      and 7.3, respectively).\n"

  - "4.  Node and Interface Identifiers\n   The format of the Node and Interface Identifiers
    are not changed by\n   this memo except for the case when global uniqueness is
    required.\n   [RFC6370] defines the Node Identifier (Node_ID) as a unique 32-bit\n
    \  value assigned by the operator within the scope of a Global_ID.  The\n   structure
    of the Node_ID itself is not defined as it is left to the\n   operator to choose
    an appropriate value.  The value zero, however, is\n   reserved and MUST NOT be
    used.\n   This document does not change the above definition.  However, in case\n
    \  global uniqueness is required, the Node_ID is prefixed with the\n   ICC_Operator_ID
    as defined in Section 3.\n   [RFC6370] further defines interface numbers (IF_Num)
    as 32-bit\n   unsigned integers that can be freely assigned by the operator and\n
    \  must be unique in the scope of the respective Node_ID.  The IF_Num\n   value
    0 has a special meaning, and therefore, it MUST NOT be used to\n   identify an
    MPLS-TP interface.\n   An Interface Identifier (IF_ID) identifies an interface
    uniquely\n   within the context of an ICC_Operator_ID.  It is formed by\n   concatenating
    the Node_ID with the IF_Num to result in a 64-bit\n   identifier formed as Node_ID::IF_Num.\n
    \  Global uniqueness of the IF_ID, if needed, can be assured by\n   prefixing
    the identifier with the ICC_Operator_ID.\n"

      are based on the end points' Node_IDs and\n   locally assigned tunnel numbers

      is a 16-bit unsigned\n   integer unique within the context of the Node_ID.  A
      full Tunnel ID\n   is represented by the concatenation of these two end-point-specific\n
      \  identifiers.  Using the A1/Z9 convention, the format of a Tunnel_ID\n   is:\n
      \     A1-{Node_ID::Tunnel_Num}::Z9-{Node_ID::Tunnel_Num}\n   Where global uniqueness
      is required, using ITU-T conventions, the\n   ICC_Operator_ID is prefixed to

      \     Z9-{ICC_Operator_ID::Node_ID::Tunnel_Num}\n   As per [RFC6370], when an

        unsigned integer LSP number (LSP_Num) to\n   the Tunnel ID.  Consequently,
        the format of an MPLS-TP co-routed\n   bidirectional LSP_ID is:\n      A1-{Node_ID::Tunnel_Num}::Z9-{Node_ID::Tunnel_Num}::LSP_Num\n

        \  on the A1/Z9 sort ordering\".\n   A co-routed bidirectional LSP is provisioned

        uniqueness is accomplished by using globally unique Node_IDs.\n   A globally
