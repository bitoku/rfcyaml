- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is a voluntary consensus\n\
    \   standards organization.  Founded in 1994, the OGC produces many kinds\n  \
    \ of technical documents, including: standards, working drafts,\n   technical\
    \ reports, discussion papers, and XML schemas.  The OGC\n   wishes to provide\
    \ persistent, location-independent Identifiers for\n   these resources.  Further,\
    \ a number of OGC standards and application\n   schemas of OGC standards are now\
    \ used and/or referenced by standards\n   specifications from other standards\
    \ organizations, including OASIS,\n   the IETF, IEEE, ISO, and OMA.\n   The OGC\
    \ core mission is to develop spatial interface and encoding\n   specifications\
    \ that are openly available and royalty free.  Products\n   and services that\
    \ conform to OGC interface specifications enable\n   users to freely exchange\
    \ and process spatial information across\n   networks, computing platforms, and\
    \ products.  Interoperability in\n   such an environment is facilitated by the\
    \ use of a system of\n   persistent identifiers that are global in scope.  The\
    \ OGC is the only\n   standards organization whose mission is specifically focused\
    \ in\n   interfaces and encodings for geospatial content and services.\n   Motivated\
    \ by these concerns, the OGC would like to assign formal URNs\n   to published\
    \ resources in order to provide persistent, location-\n   independent identifiers\
    \ for them.  The process for registering a\n   namespace identifier is documented\
    \ in RFC 3406 [2].\n   The official IANA registry of URN namespaces is available\
    \ online:\n   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>.\n   2.  URN Specification\
    \ for \"ogc\" NID\n   Namespace ID:\n      ogc\n   Registration Information:\n\
    \      Registration Version Number: 1\n      Registration Date: 2007-08-16\n \
    \  Declared registrant of the namespace:\n      Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.\
    \ (Headquarters)\n      35 Main Street, Suite 5\n      Wayland, MA 01778-5037,\
    \ USA\n      c/o Carl Reed (creed@opengeospatial.org)\n   Declaration of syntactic\
    \ structure:\n      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the\
    \ \"ogc\"\n      NID will have the following structure:\n         urn:ogc:{OGCresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}\n\
    \      where the \"OGCresource\" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the\n \
    \     URN syntax requirements [1] and defines a specific class of\n      resource\
    \ type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme\n      that is covered\
    \ by \"ResourceSpecificString\", which also conforms\n      to the naming requirements\
    \ of [1].  The only exception is that the\n      character \":\" shall not be\
    \ used as part of the \"OGCresource\"\n      string.  This is to avoid possible\
    \ confusion.  Further,\n      \"OGCresource\" is case sensitive.\n      The OGC\
    \ maintains a naming authority, the OGC Naming Authority\n      (ONA), that will\
    \ manage the assignment of  \"OGCresources\" and the\n      specific registration\
    \ values assigned for each resource class.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \      The OGC Naming Authority (ONA) provides information on the\n      registered\
    \ resources and the registrations for each.  More\n      information about ONA,\
    \ the registration activities, and procedures\n      to be followed are available\
    \ at:\n      https://portal.opengeospatial.org/wiki/twiki/bin/view/\n      Member/OGCUrnIntro\n\
    \      An operational OGC URN \"resolver\" is available at\n      http://urn.opengis.net/.\
    \  The resolver provides a registry of the\n      currently member approved OGC\
    \ URN's used in currently approved and\n      implemented OGC standards.\n   \
    \   The OGC Naming Authority is a permanent OGC resource.  The\n      documents\
    \ and related OGC URN resources, such as the URN resolver,\n      have stable\
    \ URLs.  The ONA reference is\n      http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogcna.\n  \
    \    There are a number of OGC Best Practice and Standards documents\n      that\
    \ define member agreements on the definitions for \"OGCresource\"\n      and ResourceSpecificString.\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The ONA manages resources using\
    \ the \"ogc\" NID and will be the\n      authority for managing the resources\
    \ and subsequent strings\n      associated.  In the associated procedures, ONA\
    \ will ensure the\n      uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit\
    \ secondary\n      responsibility for the management of well-defined sub-trees.\n\
    \      The OGC may permit the use of experimental type values that will\n    \
    \  not be registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up\n      using\
    \ the same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is\n      only intended\
    \ for testing purposes, this should not be a real\n      issue.\n   Identifier\
    \ persistence considerations:\n      The OGC provides clear documentation on a\
    \ number of the registered\n      uses of the \"ogc\" NID.  Additional uses developed\
    \ by the OGC\n      membership in the future will be first approved by the ONA\
    \ and\n      then by the entire OGC voting membership.  This is the normal\n \
    \     process for all OGC documents that become OGC standards or other\n     \
    \ permanent resources for use by the community.\n      The OGC Naming Authority\
    \ maintains a permanent registry of\n      approved uses.  This resource is structured\
    \ such that each\n      \"OGCresource\" has a separate description and registration\
    \ table.\n      The registration tables and information are published and\n  \
    \    maintained by the ONA on the OGC web site.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n\
    \      The ONA uses the approved OGC standards policies and procedures\n     \
    \ for discussion, approval, and registration of each type of\n      resource maintained\
    \ [3].\n      Each such resource may have three types of registration\n      activities:\n\
    \         1) Registered values associated with OGC specs or services\n       \
    \  2) Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities\n         3) Name\
    \ models for use in experimental purposes\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n\
    \      The namespace is not listed with a Resolution Discovery System\n      (RDS);\
    \ this is not relevant.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      No special considerations\
    \ except as noted in the declaration of\n      syntactic structure; the rules\
    \ for lexical equivalence of [1]\n      apply.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n\
    \      No special considerations.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.\
    \  URN assignment will be handled by procedures\n      implemented in support\
    \ of ONA activities.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"

  - "3.  Examples\n   The following examples are representative URNs that have been\n\
    \   assigned by the ONA.\n      urn:ogc:specification:gml:doc-is(02-023r4):3.0.0\n\

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   There is currently no available namespace that\
    \ will allow the OGC to\n   uniquely specify and access resources, such as schemas\
    \ and\n   registries, that are required by organizations implementing OGC\n  \
    \ standards.  There is also a need for other standards organizations,\n   such\
    \ as OASIS and the IETF, to be able to access OGC specific\n   resources.\n  \
    \ The geospatial and location services industry will benefit from the\n   publication\
    \ of this namespace by having more permanent and reliable\n   names for the XML\
    \ namespaces, schema locations, standards document\n   reference, and other document\
    \ artifacts required for implementation\n   of an OGC standard.\n   The OGC members\
    \ considered the use of other existing NIDs, such as\n   those for OASIS and OMA.\
    \  However, the semantics for geospatial\n   content and services have a number\
    \ of unique characteristics, such as\n   the expression of coordinate reference\
    \ systems.  The URN syntax used\n   by OASIS and OMA do not support the necessary\
    \ elements to express the\n   full semantics used in and by the geospatial community.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   Both the traditional geospatial and location\
    \ services industry as\n   well as the broader IT community will benefit from\
    \ the publication of\n   this namespace by providing permanent and reliable names\
    \ for the XML\n   namespaces, schema locations, catalogues registries, and other\n\
    \   document artifacts required for implementation of an OGC standard.\n   We\
    \ desire these resources to be freely and openly available as a set\n   of community\
    \ resources.  Not only can OGC members identify and submit\n   new proposals for\
    \ additional resources, but any individual or\n   organization can make a contribution\
    \ by submitting a proposal to the\n   OGC for consideration by the ONA.  Normal\
    \ OGC standards discussion\n   and approval processes will be used to process\
    \ any new community\n   contribution.\n   Since 2003, the OGC membership has been\
    \ developing expertise in using\n   the OGC URN.  The knowledge and experience\
    \ gained through\n   implementation experiments and a variety of operational test\
    \ beds\n   contributed to the current OGC URN specification.  The knowledge is\n\
    \   documented in OGC documents (above) as well as an operational OGC URN\n  \
    \ resolver.  Work is also underway on a publicly accessible OGC URN\n   registry.\
    \  These resources are necessary for a number of reasons,\n   including the fact\
    \ that numerous agencies and organizations, such as\n   NATO and NGA, have mandated\
    \ a procurement policy that requires OGC\n   standards and their related OGC URNs.\n"
