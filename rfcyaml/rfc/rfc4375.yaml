- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The objective of this document is to define a set of requirements\n\
    \   that support ETS within a single domain.  There have been a number of\n  \
    \ discussions in the IEPREP mailing list, as well as working group\n   meetings,\
    \ that have questioned the utility of a given mechanism to\n   support ETS.  Many\
    \ have advocated over-provisioning, while others\n   have favored specific schemas\
    \ to provide a quantifiable measure of\n   service.  One constant in these discussions\
    \ is that the\n   administrative control of the resources plays a significant\
    \ role in\n   the effectiveness of any proposed solution.  Specifically, if one\n\
    \   administers a set of resources, a wide variety of approaches can be\n   deployed\
    \ upon that set.  However, once the approach crosses an\n   administrative boundary,\
    \ its effectiveness comes into question, and\n   at a minimum requires cooperation\
    \ and trust from other administrative\n   domains.  To avoid this question, we\
    \ constrain our scenario to the\n   resources within a single domain.\n   The\
    \ following provides an explanation of some key terms used in this\n   document.\n\
    \   Resource:  A resource can be a viewed from the general level as IP\n     nodes\
    \ such as a router or host as well as the physical media\n     (e.g., fiber) used\
    \ to connect them.  A host can also be referred\n     to in more specific terms\
    \ as a client, server, or proxy.\n     Resources can also be viewed more specifically\
    \ in terms of the\n     elements within a node (e.g., CPU, buffer, memory).  However,\n\
    \     this document shall focus its attention at the node level.\n   Domain: \
    \ This term has been used in many ways.  We constrain its\n     usage in this\
    \ document to the perspective of the network layer,\n     and view it as being\
    \ synonymous with an administrative domain.\n     A domain may span large geographic\
    \ regions and may consist of\n     many types of physical subnetworks.\n   Administrative\
    \ Domain:  The collection of resources under the\n     control of a single administrative\
    \ authority.  This authority\n     establishes the design and operation of a set\
    \ of resources\n     (i.e., the network).\n   Transit Domain:  This is an administrative\
    \ domain used to forward\n     traffic from one domain to another.  An Internet\
    \ Service Provider\n     (ISP) is an example of a transit domain.\n   Stub Domain:\
    \  This is an administrative domain that is either the\n     source or the destination\
    \ of a flow of IP packets.  As a general\n     rule, it does not forward traffic\
    \ that is destined for other\n     domains.  The odd exception to this statement\
    \ is the case of\n     Mobile IP and its use of \"dog-leg\" routing to visiting\
    \ hosts\n     located in foreign networks.  An enterprise network is an example\n\
    \     of a stub domain.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Previous Work
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Previous Work\n   A list of general requirements for support of ETS is\
    \ presented in\n   [RFC3689].  The document articulates requirements when considering\n\
    \   the broad case of supporting ETS over the Internet.  Since that\n   document\
    \ is not constrained to specific applications, administrative\n   boundaries,\
    \ or scenarios, the requirements contained within it tend\n   to be quite general\
    \ in their description and scope.  This follows the\n   philosophy behind its\
    \ inception in that the general requirements are\n   meant to be a baseline followed\
    \ (if necessary) by more specific\n   requirements that pertain to a more narrow\
    \ scope.\n   The requirements presented below in Section 3 are representative\
    \ of\n   the more narrow scope of a single administrative domain.  As in the\n\
    \   case of [RFC3689], the requirements articulated in this document\n   represent\
    \ aspects to be taken into consideration when solutions are\n   being designed,\
    \ specified, and deployed.  Key words such as \"MUST\",\n   \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",\n   \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\n   interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope\n   IETF standards that cover the resources within an administrative\n\
    \   domain are within the scope of this document.  This includes\n   gateways,\
    \ routers, servers, etc., that are located and administered\n   within the domain.\
    \  This document also does not restrict itself to a\n   specific type of application\
    \ such as Voice over IP.\n   Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms are also within\
    \ the scope of this\n   document.  These mechanisms may reside at the application,\
    \ transport,\n   or IP network layer.  While QoS mechanisms may exist at the\n\
    \   link/physical layer, this document only considers potential mappings\n   of\
    \ labels or code points.\n   Finally, since this document focuses on a single\
    \ administrative\n   domain, we do not make any further distinction between transit\
    \ and\n   stub domains within this document.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Out of Scope
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Out of Scope\n   Resources owned or operated by other administrative authorities\
    \ are\n   outside the scope of this document.  One example is a SIP server that\n\
    \   operates in other domains.  Another example is an access link\n   connecting\
    \ the stub domain and its provider.  Controlling only 1/2 of\n   a link (the egress\
    \ traffic from the stub) is considered insufficient\n   for including inter-domain\
    \ access links as a subject for this\n   document.\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements\n   It must be understood that all of the following requirements\
    \ pertain\n   to mechanisms chosen by a domain's administrative authority to\n\
    \   specifically support ETS.  If that authority chooses not to support\n   ETS\
    \ or if these mechanisms exist within the domain exclusively for a\n   different\
    \ purpose, then the associated requirement does not apply.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Label Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Label Mechanisms\n   Application or transport layer label mechanisms used\
    \ for ETS MUST be\n   extensible such that they can support more than one label.\
    \  These\n   mechanism MUST avoid a single off/on type of label (e.g., a single\n\
    \   bit).  In addition, designers of such a mechanism MUST assume that\n   there\
    \ may be more than one set of ETS users.\n   Network layer label mechanisms used\
    \ for ETS SHOULD be extensible such\n   that they can support more than one label.\
    \  We make this distinction\n   in requirements because there may be fewer bits\
    \ (a smaller field)\n   available at the network layer than in the transport or\
    \ application\n   layer.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Proxies
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Proxies\n   Proxies MAY set ETS labels on behalf of the source of a flow.\
    \  This\n   may involve removing labels that have been set by upstream node(s).\n\
    \   If proxies take such action, then the security measures discussed in\n   [RFC3689]\
    \ MUST be considered.  More information about security in the\n   single-domain\
    \ context is found below in Section 5.\n"
- title: 3.3.  QoS mechanisms
  contents:
  - "3.3.  QoS mechanisms\n   [RFC3689] defines a label as an identifier, and the\
    \ set of\n   characteristics associated with the label as policy.  However, QoS\
    \ in\n   the traditional sense of delay or bandwidth is not automatically\n  \
    \ bound to a label.  MPLS [RFC3031] is an example of a labeling\n   mechanism\
    \ that can provide specific QoS or simply traffic engineering\n   of labeled flows.\n\
    \   In the context of ETS, QoS mechanisms, at either the network or\n   application\
    \ layer, SHOULD be used when networks cannot be over-\n   provisioned to satisfy\
    \ high bursts of traffic load.  Examples can\n   involve bridging fiber networks\
    \ to wireless subnetworks, or remote\n   subnetworks connected over expensive\
    \ bandwidth-constrained wide area\n   links.\n   Note well.  Over-provisioning\
    \ is a normal cost-effective practice\n   amongst network administrators/engineers.\
    \  The amount of over-\n   provisioning can be a topic of debate.  More in-depth\
    \ discussion on\n   this topic is presented in the companion Framework document\
    \ [FRAME].\n"
- title: 3.4.  Users
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Users\n   Regarding existing IETF-specified applications, augmentations\
    \ in the\n   form of labeling mechanisms to support ETS MUST NOT adversely affect\n\
    \   its legacy usage by non-ETS users.  With respect to future\n   applications,\
    \ such labeling mechanisms SHOULD allow the application\n   to support a \"normal\"\
    \ (non-emergency) condition.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Policy
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Policy\n   Policy MUST be used to determine the percentage of resources\
    \ of a\n   mechanism used to support the various (ETS and non-ETS) users.  Under\n\
    \   certain conditions, this percentage MAY reach 100% for a specific set\n  \
    \ of users.  However, we recommend that this \"all-or-nothing\" approach\n   be\
    \ considered with great care.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Discovery
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Discovery\n   There should be a means of forwarding ETS labeled flows to\
    \ those\n   mechanisms within the domain used to support ETS.  Discovery\n   mechanisms\
    \ SHOULD be used to determine where ETS labeled flows\n   (either data or control)\
    \ are to be forwarded.\n"
- title: 3.7.  MIB
  contents:
  - "3.7.  MIB\n   Management Information Bases (MIBs) SHOULD be defined for mechanisms\n\
    \   specifically in place to support ETS.  These MIBs MAY include objects\n  \
    \ representing accounting, policy, and authorization.\n"
- title: 4.  Issues
  contents:
  - "4.  Issues\n   This section presents issues that arise in considering solutions\
    \ for\n   the requirements that have been defined for stub domains that support\n\
    \   ETS.  This section does not specify solutions nor is it to be\n   confused\
    \ with requirements.  Subsequent documents that articulate a\n   more specific\
    \ set of requirements for a particular service may make a\n   statement about\
    \ the following issues.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Alternative Services
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Alternative Services\n   The form of the service provided to ETS users\
    \ and articulated in the\n   form of policies may be realized in one of several\
    \ forms.  Better\n   than best effort is probably the service that most ETS users\
    \ would\n   expect when the communication system is stressed and overall quality\n\
    \   has degraded.  However, the concept of best available service should\n   also\
    \ be considered under such stressed conditions.  Further, a\n   measure of degraded\
    \ service may also be desirable to ensure a measure\n   of communication versus\
    \ none.  These services may be made available\n   at the network or application\
    \ layer.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Redundancy
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Redundancy\n   The issue of making networks fault tolerant is important\
    \ and yet not\n   one that can be easily articulated in terms of requirements\
    \ of\n   protocols.  Redundancy in connectivity and nodes (be it routers or\n\
    \   servers) is probably the most common approach taken by network\n   administrators,\
    \ and it can be assumed that administrative domains\n   apply this approach in\
    \ various degrees to their own resources.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document recommends that readers review\
    \ and follow the comments\n   and requirements about security presented in [RFC3689].\
    \  Having said\n   that, there tend to be many instances where intra-domain security\
    \ is\n   held at a lower standard (i.e., less stringent) that inter-domain\n \
    \  security.  For example, while administrators may allow telnet service\n   between\
    \ resources within an administrative domain, they would only\n   allow SSH access\
    \ from other domains.\n   The disparity in security policy can be problematic\
    \ when domains\n   offer services other than best effort for ETS users.  Therefore,\
    \ any\n   support within a domain for ETS should be accompanied by a detailed\n\
    \   security policy for users and administrators.\n   Given the \"SHOULD\" statement\
    \ in Section 3.8 concerning MIBs, there\n   are a number of related security considerations\
    \ that need to be\n   brought to attention to the reader.  Specifically, the following:\n\
    \     - Most current deployments of Simple Network Management Protocol\n     \
    \  (SNMP) are of versions prior to SNMPv3, even though there are\n       well-known\
    \ security vulnerabilities in those versions of SNMP.\n     - SNMP versions prior\
    \ to SNMPv3 cannot support cryptographic\n       security mechanisms.  Hence,\
    \ any use of SNMP prior to version 3\n       to write or modify MIB objects do\
    \ so in a non-secure manner.  As\n       a result, it may be best to constrain\
    \ the use of these objects to\n       read-only by MIB managers.\n     - Finally,\
    \ any MIB defining writable objects should carefully\n       consider the security\
    \ implications of an SNMP compromise on the\n       mechanism(s) being controlled\
    \ by those writable MIB objects.\n"
