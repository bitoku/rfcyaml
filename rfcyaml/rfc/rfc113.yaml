  - "               NETWORK ACTIVITY REPORT:  UCSB <- -> RAND\nUCSB RJE/RJOR\n   \
    \   The UCSB Remote Job Entry (RJE) and Remote Job Out- put\nRetrieval (RJOR)\
    \ Systems described in NWG/RFC #105 have been used and\nvalidated from Rand. \
    \ The facility is now being used on a limited\nbasis as a production tool by another\
    \ research group at Rand.\n     Access to the UCSB facility from Rand is through\
    \ the Network\nService Program (NSP).  This program is driven by Rand Video-Graphic\n\
    consoles and allows a console user access to both local file storage\n(at Rand)\
    \ and to the Network. A small module (UCSBMGR) was added to\nNSP to handle the\
    \ UCSB RJE and RJOR protocols and data formats.\n     In exercising the RJE/RJOR\
    \ facility over the past two months,\ntypical job sizes included input decks of\
    \ 800 to 2800 80-character\ncard images and output files of about 30 pages of\
    \ printer linstings.\nNETWORK OBSERVATIONS\n     In sending files to UCSB we did\
    \ a timing study over several\ntransmissions of the above mentioned 2800 record\
    \ file.  On the average\nthis file was transmitted at a rate of 250 80-character\
    \ cards per\nminute.  (Each 80-character card was a separte Network message.)\
    \  This\nis, of course, much less than the advertised 30 kilobit rate; however,\n\
    it should be remembered that the path from Rand to UCSB is through at\nleast one\
    \ intermediate IMP.  On the other hand, the processes at each\nend of the connection\
    \ were running at maximum priority with very small\nloads on either machine. \
    \ An obvious area for speed-up would be the\nblocking of card images for network\
    \ transmission.\n     In the course of the last two months of networking, we have\n\
    noticed approximately five serious failures in transmitted messages.\nIn two instances,\
    \ the RFNM on the control link from UCSB to Rand was\nlost.  Its loss was not\
    \ reported via a type 9 IMP-to-Host message as\nwould be expected.  We have not\
    \ been able to cause the problem to\noccur; hence we are unable to ascertain whether\
    \ it is an IMP problem\nor a problem with the UCSB Host Interface.\n     The other\
    \ three errors were related to the garbling of a data\nmessage between the Rand\
    \ NSP and UCSB RJE.  In all three instances, it\nwas the second card image trans-\
    \ ferred to RJE.  We were unable to\ncause this problem at will; hence have been\
    \ unable to track it down.\nUnfortun- ately the HASP system at USCB merely ignored\
    \ this image\nrather than printing it so we are not aware of the nature nor source\n\
    early trans- missions to UCSB and has disappeared.  We feel relatively\nconfident,\
    \ however, that our Host software on either end was not at\nfault.\n     Lest\
    \ these last two figures seem too terrifying, it should be\nnoted that we have\
    \ run over 100 jobs at UCSB from Rand, each job\nconsisting of many Network transmissions.\n\
