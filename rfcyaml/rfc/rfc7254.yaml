  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN)\
    \ namespace\n   for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA)\n\
    \   and a Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the International Mobile\n   station\
    \ Equipment Identity (IMEI), as well as an associated parameter\n   for the International\
    \ Mobile station Equipment Identity and Software\n   Version number (IMEISV) as\
    \ per the namespace registration requirement\n   found in RFC 3406 [1].  The Namespace\
    \ Identifier (NID) 'gsma' is for\n   identities used in GSM, Universal Mobile\
    \ Telecommunications System\n   (UMTS), and Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks.\
    \  The IMEI and the\n   IMEISV are managed by the GSMA, so this NID is managed\
    \ by the GSMA.\n   While this specification currently defines only the 'imei'\
    \ NSS under\n   the 'gsma' NID, additional NSS under the 'gsma' NID may be specified\n\
    \   in the future by the GSMA, using the procedure for URN NSS changes\n   and\
    \ additions (currently through the publication of future\n   Informational RFCs\
    \ approved by IETF consensus).\n   The IMEI is 15 decimal digits long and includes\
    \ a Type Allocation\n   Code (TAC) of 8 decimal digits and a Serial Number (SNR)\
    \ of 6 decimal\n   digits plus a Spare decimal digit.  The TAC identifies the\
    \ type of\n   the Mobile Equipment and is chosen from a range of values allocated\n\
    \   to the Mobile Equipment manufacturer in order to uniquely identify\n   the\
    \ model of the Mobile Equipment.  The SNR is an individual serial\n   number that\
    \ uniquely identifies each Mobile Equipment device within\n   the TAC.  The Spare\
    \ digit is used as a Check digit to validate the\n   IMEI and is always set to\
    \ the value 0 when transmitted by the Mobile\n   Equipment.\n   The IMEISV is\
    \ 16 decimal digits long and includes the TAC and SNR,\n   same as for the IMEI,\
    \ but also includes a 2 decimal digit Software\n   Version Number (SVN), which\
    \ is allocated by the Mobile Equipment\n   manufacturer to identify the software\
    \ version of the Mobile\n   Equipment.\n   The information here is meant to be\
    \ a concise guide for those wishing\n   to use the IMEI and IMEISV as URNs.  Nothing\
    \ in this document should\n   be construed to override 3GPP Technical Specification\
    \ (TS) 23.003\n   [2], which specifies the IMEI and IMEISV.\n   The GSMA is a\
    \ global trade association representing nearly 800 mobile\n   phone operators\
    \ across 220 territories and countries of the world.\n   The primary goals of\
    \ the GSMA are to ensure that mobile phones and\n   wireless services work globally\
    \ and are easily accessible.  Further\n   details about the GSMA's role in allocating\
    \ the IMEI and the IMEISV,\n   as well as the IMEI and IMEISV allocation guidelines,\
    \ can be found in\n   GSMA Permanent Reference Document (PRD) TS.06 [3].\n"

    \ [2].\n      To accurately represent an IMEI received in a cellular signaling\n\
    \      message (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [6]) as a URN, it is necessary to\n      convert\

    \ [5];\n      the core rules are not repeated here.\n      A URN with the 'imei'\

    \ for the 'gsma' namespace,\n      including the 'imei' NSS.\n      Additional\
    \ NSS may be added for future identifiers needed by the\n      GSMA, at their\
    \ discretion.  Only URNs with the 'imei' NSS are\n      considered to be \"GSMA\
    \ IMEI URNs\", and use in IETF protocols of\n      other NSS that might be defined\
    \ in the future will require IETF\n      consensus.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \      See IMEI Allocation and Approval Guidelines (GSMA PRD TS.06) [3]\n    \
    \  and 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      Identifiers\
    \ under the 'gsma' NID are defined and assigned by the\n      GSMA after ensuring\
    \ that the URNs to be assigned are unique.\n      Uniqueness is achieved by checking\
    \ against the IANA registry of\n      previously assigned names.\n      Procedures\
    \ are in place to ensure that each IMEI is uniquely\n      assigned by the Mobile\
    \ Equipment manufacturer so that it is\n      guaranteed to uniquely identify\
    \ that particular Mobile Equipment\n      device.\n      Procedures are in place\
    \ to ensure that each IMEISV is uniquely\n      assigned by the Mobile Equipment\
    \ manufacturer so that it is\n      guaranteed to uniquely identify that particular\
    \ Mobile Equipment\n      device and the specific software version installed.\n\
    \   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      The GSMA is committed to maintaining\
    \ uniqueness and persistence of\n      all resources identified by assigned URNs.\n\
    \      As the NID sought is 'gsma' and \"GSMA\" is the long-standing\n      acronym\
    \ for the trade association that represents the mobile phone\n      operators,\
    \ the URN should also persist indefinitely (at least as\n      long as there is\
    \ a need for its use).  The assignment process\n      guarantees that names are\
    \ not reassigned.  The binding between the\n      name and its resource is permanent.\n\
    \      The TAC and SNR portions of the IMEI and IMEISV are permanently\n     \
    \ stored in the Mobile Equipment, so they remain persistent as long\n      as\
    \ the Mobile Equipment exists.  The process for TAC and SNR\n      assignment\
    \ is documented in GSMA PRD TS.06 [3], and once assigned,\n      the TAC and SNR\
    \ values are not reassigned to other Mobile\n      Equipment devices.  The SVN\
    \ portion of the IMEISV may be modified\n      by software when new versions are\
    \ installed but should be\n      persistent for the duration of the installation\
    \ of that specific\n      version of software.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n\
    \      The GSMA will manage the <NSS> (including 'imei') and\n      <future-gsma-specifier>\
    \ identifier resources to maintain\n      uniqueness.\n      The process for IMEI\
    \ and IMEISV assignment is documented in GSMA\n      PRD TS.06 [3].\n   Process\
    \ for identifier resolution:\n      Since the 'gsma' NSS is not currently globally\
    \ resolvable, this is\n      not applicable.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n\
    \      Two GSMA IMEI URNs are equivalent if they have the same 'imeival'\n   \
    \   value, and the same parameter values in the same sequential order,\n     \
    \ with the exception that the 'vers=0' parameter is to be ignored\n      for the\
    \ purposes of comparison.  All of these comparisons are to\n      be case insensitive.\n\
    \      Any identifier in the 'gsma' NSS can be compared using the normal\n   \
    \   mechanisms for percent-encoded UTF-8 strings (see RFC 3629 [7]).\n   Conformance\
    \ with URN Syntax:\n      The string representation of the 'gsma' NID and of the\
    \ 'imei' NSS\n      is fully compatible with the URN syntax (see RFC 2141 [8]).\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      The IMEI can be validated using the mechanism\
    \ defined in Annex B\n      of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].  There is no mechanism defined\
    \ to validate\n      the SVN field of the IMEISV.\n   Scope:  The GSMA URN is\
    \ global in scope.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  IMEI Parameters\n   The optional 'vers' parameter and the 'ext-imei' field\
    \ in the ABNF\n   are included for extensibility of the 'imei' NSS -- for example,\
    \ if\n   the IMEI format is extended in the future (such as with additional\n\
    \   digits or using hex digits).  In this case, the 'vers' parameter\n   would\
    \ contain a non-zero value and the 'ext-imei' would be further\n   defined to\
    \ represent the syntax of the extended IMEI format.  A value\n   of the 'vers'\
    \ parameter equal to 0 or the absence of the 'vers'\n   parameter means the URN\
    \ format is compliant with the format specified\n   here.\n   Any change to the\
    \ format of the 'imei' NSS requires the use of the\n   procedure for URN NSS changes\
    \ and additions (currently through the\n   publication of future Informational\
    \ RFCs approved by IETF consensus).\n   The use of the 'vers' parameter was chosen\
    \ for extensibility instead\n   of defining a new NSS (e.g., 'imei2') because\
    \ it is likely that many\n   applications will only need to perform string compares\
    \ of the\n   'imeival'.  So, even if the format or length of the 'imeival' changes\n\
    \   in the future, such applications should continue to work without\n   having\
    \ to be updated to understand a new NSS.\n   RFC 7255 [10] specifies how the GSMA\
    \ IMEI URN can be used as an\n   instance ID as specified in RFC 5626 [11].  Any\
    \ future value of the\n   'vers' parameter other than 0, or the definition of\
    \ additional\n   parameters that are intended to be used as part of an instance\
    \ ID,\n   will require an update to RFC 7255 [10].\n   For example:\n      urn:gsma:imei:90420156-025763-0;vers=0\n\
    \   The IMEISV is an identifier that uniquely identifies mobile devices\n   and\
    \ their associated software versions used in the GSM, UMTS, and LTE\n   networks.\
    \  The representation of the IMEISV is defined in 3GPP TS\n   23.003 [2].\n  \
    \ To represent the IMEISV, the URN parameter 'svn' is appended to the\n   GSMA\
    \ IMEI URN and set equal to the decimal string representation of\n   the two software\
    \ version number (svn) digits in the IMEISV, and the\n   Spare digit in the IMEI\
    \ 'imeival' is set to zero.\n   For example:\n      urn:gsma:imei:90420156-025763-0;svn=42\n"

- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   GSM, UMTS, and LTE mobile devices will be interoperating\
    \ with\n   Internet devices for a variety of voice and data services.  To do\n\
    \   this, they need to make use of Internet protocols that will operate\n   end\
    \ to end between devices in GSM/UMTS/LTE networks and those in the\n   general\
    \ Internet.  Some of these protocols require the use of URNs as\n   identifiers.\
    \  Within the GSM/UMTS/LTE networks, mobile devices are\n   identified by their\
    \ IMEI or IMEISV.  Internet users will need to be\n   able to receive and include\
    \ the GSMA URN in various Internet protocol\n   elements to facilitate communication\
    \ between pure Internet-based\n   devices and GSM/UMTS/LTE mobile devices.  Thus,\
    \ the existence and\n   syntax of these namespaces need to be available to the\
    \ general\n   Internet community, and the namespace needs to be reserved with\
    \ IANA\n   in order to guarantee uniqueness and prevent potential namespace\n\
    \   conflicts both within the Internet and within GSM/UMTS/LTE networks.\n   Conversely,\
    \ Internet implementations will not generally possess IMEI\n   identifiers.  The\
    \ identifiers generated by such implementations will\n   typically be URNs within\
    \ namespaces other than 'gsma' and may,\n   depending on context, even be non-URN\
    \ URIs.  Implementations are\n   advised to be ready to process URIs other than\
    \ 'gsma' namespaced\n   URNs, so as to aid in interoperability.\n"
- title: 6.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Namespace Considerations\n   A URN was considered the most appropriate URI\
    \ to represent the IMEI\n   and IMEISV, as these identifiers may be used and transported\n\
    \   similarly to the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), which is\n   defined\
    \ as a URN in RFC 4122 [12].  Since specifications for\n   protocols that are\
    \ used to transport device identifiers often require\n   the device identifier\
    \ to be globally unique and in the URN format, it\n   is necessary that the URN\
    \ formats are defined to represent the IMEI\n   and IMEISV.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   In accordance with BCP 66 (RFC 3406) [1], IANA has\
    \ registered the\n   Formal URN Namespace 'gsma' in the \"Uniform Resource Names\
    \ (URN)\n   Namespaces\" registry, using the registration template presented in\n\
    \   Section 3 of this document.\n"
- title: 8.  Security and Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security and Privacy Considerations\n   IMEIs (but with the Spare value set\
    \ to the value of the Check digit)\n   are displayable on most mobile devices\
    \ and in many cases are printed\n   on the case within the battery compartment.\
    \  Anyone with brief\n   physical access to the mobile device can therefore easily\
    \ obtain the\n   IMEI.  Therefore, IMEIs MUST NOT be used as security capabilities\n\
    \   (identifiers whose mere possession grants access).  Unfortunately,\n   there\
    \ are currently examples of some applications that are using the\n   IMEI for\
    \ authorization.  Also, some service provider's customer\n   service departments\
    \ have been known to use knowledge of the IMEI as\n   \"proof\" that the caller\
    \ is the legitimate owner of the mobile device.\n   Both of these are inappropriate\
    \ uses of the IMEI.\n   While the specific software version of the mobile device\
    \ only\n   identifies the lower-layer software that has undergone and passed\n\
    \   certification testing, and not the operating system or application\n   software,\
    \ the software version could identify software that is\n   vulnerable to attacks\
    \ or is known to contain security holes.\n   Therefore, the IMEISV MUST only be\
    \ delivered to trusted entities\n   within carrier networks and not provided to\
    \ the Internet at large, as\n   it could help a malicious device identify that\
    \ the mobile device is\n   running software that is known to be vulnerable to\
    \ certain attacks.\n   This concern is similar to concerns regarding the use of\
    \ the\n   User-Agent header in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as\n   specified\
    \ in RFC 3261 [13].  Therefore, the IMEISV (that is, the IMEI\n   URN with a 'svn'\
    \ parameter) MUST NOT be delivered to devices that are\n   not trusted.  IMEIs\
    \ are almost always personally identifiable\n   information, and so these URNs\
    \ MUST be treated as personally\n   identifiable information in all cases.  In\
    \ order to prevent violating\n   a user's privacy, the IMEI URN MUST NOT be included\
    \ in messages\n   intended to convey any level of anonymity.\n   Since the IMEI\
    \ is permanently assigned to the mobile device and is\n   not modified when the\
    \ ownership of the mobile device changes (even\n   upon a complete software reload\
    \ of the device), the IMEI URN MUST NOT\n   be used as a user identifier or user\
    \ address by an application.\n   Using the IMEI to identify a user or as a user\
    \ address could result\n   in communications destined for a previous owner of\
    \ a device being\n   received by the new device owner or could allow the new device\
    \ owner\n   to access information or services owned by the previous device owner.\n\
    \   Additionally, since the IMEI identifies the mobile device, it\n   potentially\
    \ could be used to identify and track users for the\n   purposes of surveillance\
    \ and call data mining if sent in the clear.\n   Since the IMEI is personally\
    \ identifiable information, uses of the\n   IMEI URN with IETF protocols require\
    \ a specification and IETF Expert\n   Review [14] in order to ensure that privacy\
    \ concerns are\n   appropriately addressed.  Protocols carrying the IMEI URN SHOULD\
    \ at a\n   minimum use channels that are strongly hop-by-hop encrypted, and it\n\
    \   is RECOMMENDED that end-to-end encryption be used.\n   Additional security\
    \ considerations are specified in 3GPP TS 22.016\n   [9].  Specifically, the IMEI\
    \ is to be incorporated in a module that\n   is contained within the terminal.\
    \  The IMEI SHALL NOT be changed\n   after the terminal's production process.\
    \  It SHALL resist tampering,\n   i.e., manipulation and change, by any means\
    \ (e.g., physical,\n   electrical, and software).\n"
