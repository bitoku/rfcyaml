- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its predecessors\
    \ have\n   traditionally separated the publication of protocol specifications\
    \ in\n   immutable Request for Comments (RFCs) and the registries containing\n\
    \   protocol parameters.  Traditionally, the registries are maintained by\n  \
    \ a set of functions known collectively as the Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority\
    \ (IANA).  Dating back to the earliest days of the\n   Internet, specification\
    \ publication and the registry operations were\n   tightly coupled: Jon Postel\
    \ of the Information Sciences Institute\n   (ISI) of the University of Southern\
    \ California (USC) was responsible\n   for both RFC publication and IANA registry\
    \ operation.  This tight\n   coupling had advantages, but it was never a requirement.\
    \  Indeed,\n   today the RFC Editor and IANA registry operation are provided by\n\
    \   different entities.\n   Internet registries are critical to the operation\
    \ of the Internet,\n   because they provide a definitive record of the value and\
    \ meaning of\n   identifiers that protocols use when communicating with each other.\n\
    \   Almost every Internet protocol makes use of registries in some form.\n   At\
    \ the time of writing, the IANA maintains more than two thousand\n   protocol\
    \ parameter registries.\n   Internet registries hold protocol identifiers consisting\
    \ of constants\n   and other well-known values used by Internet protocols.  These\
    \ values\n   can be numbers, strings, addresses, and so on.  They are uniquely\n\
    \   assigned for one particular purpose or use.  Identifiers can be\n   maintained\
    \ in a central list (such as a list of cryptographic\n   algorithms) or they can\
    \ be hierarchically allocated and assigned by\n   separate entities at different\
    \ points in the hierarchy (such as IP\n   addresses and domain names).  To maximize\
    \ trust and usefulness of the\n   IANA registries, the principles in this document\
    \ should be taken into\n   consideration for centralized registries as well as\
    \ hierarchically\n   delegated registries.  In hierarchically delegated registries,\n\
    \   entries nearest to top level have broad scope, but lower-level\n   entries\
    \ have narrow scope.   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\n   will encourage\
    \ support for these principles in all delegations of\n   Internet identifiers.\n\
    \   The registry system is built on trust and mutual cooperation.  The\n   use\
    \ of the registries is voluntary and is not enforced by mandates or\n   certification\
    \ policies.  While the use of registries is voluntary, it\n   is noted that the\
    \ success of the Internet creates enormous pressure\n   to use Internet protocols\
    \ and the identifier registries associated\n   with them.\n   This document provides\
    \ principles for the operation of IANA\n   registries, ensuring that protocol\
    \ identifiers have consistent\n   meanings and interpretations across all implementations\
    \ and\n   deployments, and thus providing the necessary trust in the IANA\n  \
    \ registries.\n"
- title: 2.  Principles for the Operation of IANA Registries
  contents:
  - "2.  Principles for the Operation of IANA Registries\n   The following key principles\
    \ underscore the successful functioning of\n   the IANA registries, and they provide\
    \ a foundation for trust in those\n   registries:\n   Ensure Uniqueness:  The\
    \ same protocol identifier must not be used for\n      more than one purpose.\n\
    \   Stable:  Protocol identifier assignment must be lasting.\n   Predictable:\
    \  The process for making assignments must not include\n      unexpected steps.\n\
    \   Public:  The protocol identifiers must be made available in well-\n      known\
    \ locations in a manner that makes them freely available to\n      everyone.\n\
    \   Open:  The process that sets the policy for protocol identifier\n      assignment\
    \ and registration must be open to all interested\n      parties.\n   Transparent:\
    \  The protocol registries and their associated policies\n      should be developed\
    \ in a transparent manner.\n   Accountable:  Registry policy development and registry\
    \ operations\n      need to be accountable to the affected community.\n"
- title: 3.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "3.  Discussion\n   The principles discussed in Section 2 provide trust and confidence\
    \ in\n   the IANA registries.  This section expands on these principles.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Ensuring Uniqueness, Stability, and Predictability
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Ensuring Uniqueness, Stability, and Predictability\n   Protocol identifier\
    \ assignment and registration must be unique,\n   stable, and predictable.  Developers,\
    \ vendors, customers, and users\n   depend on the registries for unique protocol\
    \ identifiers that are\n   assigned in a stable and predictable manner.\n   A\
    \ protocol identifier may only be reassigned for a different purpose\n   after\
    \ due consideration of the impact of such a reassignment, and if\n   possible,\
    \ with the consent of the original assignee.\n   Recognizing that some assignments\
    \ involve judgment, such as those\n   involving a designated expert [RFC5226],\
    \ a predictable process does\n   not require completion in a predetermined number\
    \ of days.  Rather, it\n   means that no unexpected steps are introduced in the\
    \ process of\n   making an assignment.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Public
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Public\n   Once assigned, the protocol identifiers must be made available\
    \ in a\n   manner that makes them freely available to everyone without\n   restrictions.\
    \  The use of a consistent publication location builds\n   confidence in the registry.\
    \  This does not mean that the publication\n   location can never change, but\
    \ it does mean that it must change\n   infrequently and only after adequate prior\
    \ notice.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Open and Transparent
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Open and Transparent\n   The process that sets the policy for protocol\
    \ identifier assignment\n   and registration must be open to all interested parties\
    \ and operate\n   in a transparent manner.\n   When a registry is established,\
    \ a policy is set for the addition of\n   new entries and the updating of existing\
    \ entries.  While making\n   additions and modifications, the registry operator\
    \ may expose\n   instances where policies lack clarity.  When this occurs, the\n\
    \   registry operator should provide helpful feedback to allow those\n   policies\
    \ to be improved.  In addition, the registry operator not\n   being involved in\
    \ establishing registry policy avoids the risks\n   associated with (perceptions\
    \ of) favoritism and unfairness.\n   Recognizing that some assignments involve\
    \ judgment, such as those\n   involving a designated expert [RFC5226], the recommendations\
    \ by\n   designated experts must be visible to the public to the maximum\n   extent\
    \ possible and subject to challenge or appeal.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Accountable
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Accountable\n   The process that sets the policy for IANA registries and\
    \ the\n   operation of the registries must be accountable to the parties that\n\
    \   rely on the protocol identifiers.  Oversight is needed to ensure\n   these\
    \ are properly serving the affected community.\n   In practice, accountability\
    \ mechanisms for the registry operator may\n   be defined by contract, memoranda\
    \ of understanding, or service level\n   agreements (SLAs).  An oversight body\
    \ uses these mechanisms to ensure\n   that the registry operator is meeting the\
    \ needs of the affected\n   community.  The oversight body is held accountable\
    \ to the affected\n   community by vastly different mechanisms, for instance recall\
    \ and\n   appeal processes.\n   For protocol parameters [RFC6220], the general\
    \ oversight of the IANA\n   function is performed by the IAB as a chartered responsibility\
    \ from\n   [RFC2850].  In addition, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee\n\
    \   (IAOC), a body responsible for IETF administrative and financial\n   matters\
    \ [BCP101], maintains an SLA with the current registry\n   operator, the Internet\
    \ Corporation for Assigned names and Numbers\n   (ICANN), thereby specifying the\
    \ operational requirements with respect\n   to the coordination, maintenance,\
    \ and publication of the protocol\n   parameter registries.  Both the IAB and\
    \ the IAOC are accountable to\n   the larger Internet community and are being\
    \ held accountable through\n   the IETF Nomcom process [BCP10].\n   For the Internet\
    \ Number Registries [RFC7249], oversight is performed\n   by the Regional Internet\
    \ Registries (RIRs) as described RFC 7020\n   [RFC7020].  The RIRs are member-based\
    \ organizations, and they are\n   accountable to the affected community by elected\
    \ governance boards.\n   Furthermore, per agreement between the RIRs and ICANN,\
    \ the policy\n   development for the global IANA number registries is coordinated\
    \ by a\n   community-elected number council and subject to process review before\n\
    \   ratification by the ICANN Board of Trustees [ASOMOU].\n"
