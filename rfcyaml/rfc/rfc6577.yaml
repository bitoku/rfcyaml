- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [AUTHRES] defined a new header field for electronic mail\
    \ messages\n   that presents the results of a message authentication effort in\
    \ a\n   machine-readable format.  That Request for Comments created a\n   registry\
    \ of results for a few message authentication mechanisms, one\n   of which was\
    \ the Sender Policy Framework [SPF].  The registry\n   contains one entry that\
    \ is inconsistent with the latter\n   specification, which was noted in an erratum\
    \ [ERR2617] filed with the\n   RFC Editor.  This memo updates the IANA registries\
    \ accordingly.\n"
- title: 2.  Keywords
  contents:
  - "2.  Keywords\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].\n"
- title: 3.  New 'fail' Definition
  contents:
  - "3.  New 'fail' Definition\n   The new \"fail\" result, replacing the existing\
    \ \"hardfail\" result for\n   [SPF] (and thus also for [SENDER-ID]) has the same\
    \ definition for\n   \"hardfail\" that was used in Section 2.4.2 of [AUTHRES],\
    \ namely:\n      This client is explicitly not authorized to inject or relay mail\n\
    \      using the sender's DNS domain.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This section enumerates requested actions of IANA,\
    \ per [IANA].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Addition of 'Status' Columns
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Addition of 'Status' Columns\n   IANA has amended the Email Authentication\
    \ Methods and Email\n   Authentication Result Names registries, both in the Email\n\
    \   Authentication Parameters group, by adding to each a column called\n   \"\
    Status\" that will indicate for each entry its current status.  Legal\n   values\
    \ for these columns are as follows:\n   active:  The entry is in current use.\n\
    \   deprecated:  The entry is no longer in current use.\n   New registrations\
    \ to either table MUST specify one of these values.\n   All existing entries,\
    \ except as specified below, are to be noted as\n   \"active\" as of publication\
    \ of this memo.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Update to Result Names
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Update to Result Names\n   [AUTHRES] listed \"hardfail\" as the result\
    \ to be used when a message\n   fails an [SPF] evaluation.  However, this latter\
    \ specification used\n   the string \"fail\" to denote such failures.\n   Therefore,\
    \ IANA has marked \"hardfail\" in the Email Authentication\n   Result Names registry\
    \ as \"deprecated\" and amended the \"fail\" entry as\n   follows:\n   Code: \
    \ fail\n   Defined:  [AUTHRES]\n   Auth Method:  spf, sender-id\n   Meaning: \
    \ [this memo] Section 3\n   Status:  active\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This memo corrects a registry error.  It is possible\
    \ that older\n   implementations will not recognize or use the corrected entry.\
    \  Thus,\n   implementers are advised to support both result strings for some\n\
    \   period of time.  However, it is known that some implementations are\n   already\
    \ using the SPF-defined result string.\n"
