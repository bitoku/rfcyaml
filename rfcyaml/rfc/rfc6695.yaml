  - "1.  Introduction\n   The FEC Framework document [RFC6363] defines the FEC Framework\n\
    \   Configuration Information that governs the overall FEC Framework\n   operation\
    \ common to any FEC scheme.  This information must be\n   available at both the\
    \ sender and receiver(s).\n   This document describes how various signaling protocols\
    \ such as the\n   Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [RFC2974], the Session Initiation\n\
    \   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)\n   [RFC2326],\
    \ etc. could be used by the FEC scheme (and/or the Content\n   Delivery Protocol\
    \ (CDP)) to communicate the configuration information\n   between the sender and\
    \ receiver(s).  The configuration information\n   may be encoded in any compatible\
    \ format, such as the Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566], XML, etc.,\
    \ though this document\n   refers to SDP encoding usage quite extensively.\n \
    \     Note that this document doesn't define any new signaling protocol;\n   \
    \   rather, it just provides examples of how existing protocols should\n     \
    \ be used.  Also, the list of signaling protocols for unicast is not\n      intended\
    \ to be a complete list.\n   This document doesn't describe any FEC-Scheme-Specific\
    \ Information\n   (FSSI) (for example, how source blocks are constructed) or any\n\
    \   sender- or receiver-side operation for a particular FEC scheme (for\n   example,\
    \ whether the receiver makes use of one or more repair flows\n   that are received).\
    \  Such FEC scheme specifics should be covered in\n   separate document(s).  This\
    \ document doesn't mandate a particular\n   encoding format for the configuration\
    \ information either.\n   This document is structured as follows: Section 3 describes\
    \ the terms\n   used in this document, Section 4 describes the FEC Framework\n\
    \   Configuration Information, Section 5 describes how to use signaling\n   protocols\
    \ for multicast and unicast applications, and Section 6\n   discusses security\
    \ considerations.\n"

- title: 4.  FEC Framework Configuration Information
  contents:
  - "4.  FEC Framework Configuration Information\n   The FEC Framework [RFC6363] defines\
    \ a minimum set of information that\n   is communicated between the sender and\
    \ receiver(s) for a proper\n   operation of an FEC scheme.  This information is\
    \ referred to as \"FEC\n   Framework Configuration Information\".  This is the\
    \ information that\n   the FEC Framework needs in order to apply FEC protection\
    \ to the\n   transport flows.\n   A single instance of the FEC Framework provides\
    \ FEC protection for\n   all packets of a specified set of source packet flows,\
    \ by means of\n   one or more packet flows consisting of repair packets.  As per\n\
    \   Section 5.5 of the FEC Framework document [RFC6363], the FEC\n   Framework\
    \ Configuration Information includes the following for each\n   FEC Framework\
    \ instance:\n   1. Identification of the repair flow(s)\n   2. Identification\
    \ of source flow(s)\n   3. Identification of FEC scheme\n   4. Length of Explicit\
    \ Source FEC Payload ID\n   5. FSSI\n   FSSI basically provides an opaque container\
    \ to encode FEC-scheme-\n   specific configuration information such as buffer\
    \ size, decoding\n   wait-time, etc.  Please refer to the FEC Framework document\
    \ [RFC6363]\n   for more details.\n   The usage of signaling protocols described\
    \ in this document requires\n   that the application layer responsible for the\
    \ FEC Framework instance\n   provide the value for each of the configuration information\n\
    \   parameters (listed above) encoded as per the chosen encoding format.\n   In\
    \ case of failure to receive the complete information, the signaling\n   protocol\
    \ module must return an error for Operations, Administration,\n   and Maintenance\
    \ (OAM) purposes and optionally convey this error to\n   the application layer.\
    \  Please refer to Figure 1 of the FEC Framework\n   document [RFC6363] for further\
    \ illustration.\n   This document does not make any assumption that the 'FEC Sender'\
    \ and\n   'Media Sender' functionalities are implemented on the same device,\n\
    \   though that may be the case.  Similarly, this document does not make\n   any\
    \ assumption that 'FEC Receiver' and 'Media Receiver'\n   functionalities are\
    \ implemented on the same device, though that may\n   be the case.  There may\
    \ also be more than one Media Sender.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Encoding Format
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Encoding Format\n   The FEC Framework Configuration Information (listed\
    \ above in\n   Section 4) may be encoded in any format, such as SDP, XML, etc.,\
    \ as\n   chosen or preferred by a particular FEC Framework instance.  The\n  \
    \ selection of such encoding formats or syntax is independent of the\n   signaling\
    \ protocol and beyond the scope of this document.\n   Any encoding format that\
    \ is selected for a particular FEC Framework\n   instance must be known to the\
    \ signaling protocol.  This is to provide\n   a means (e.g., a field such as Payload\
    \ Type) in the signaling\n   protocol message(s) to convey the chosen encoding\
    \ format for the\n   configuration information so that the payload (i.e., configuration\n\
    \   information) can be correctly parsed as per the semantics of the\n   chosen\
    \ encoding format at the receiver.  Please note that the\n   encoding format is\
    \ not a negotiated parameter, but rather a property\n   of a particular FEC Framework\
    \ instance and/or its implementation.\n   Additionally, the encoding format for\
    \ each FEC Framework\n   configuration parameter must be defined in terms of a\
    \ sequence of\n   octets that can be embedded within the payload of the signaling\n\
    \   protocol message(s).  The length of the encoding format must either\n   be\
    \ fixed or be derived by examining the encoded octets themselves.\n   For example,\
    \ the initial octets may include some kind of length\n   indication.\n   Independent\
    \ of the encoding formats supported by an FEC scheme, each\n   instance of the\
    \ FEC Framework must use a single encoding format to\n   describe all of the configuration\
    \ information associated with that\n   instance.  The signaling protocol specified\
    \ in this document should\n   not validate the encoded information, though it\
    \ may validate the\n   syntax or length of the encoded information.\n   The reader\
    \ may refer to the SDP elements document [RFC6364], which\n   describes the usage\
    \ of the 'SDP' encoding format as an example\n   encoding format for the FEC Framework\
    \ Configuration Information.\n"
- title: 5.  Signaling Protocol Usage
  contents:
  - "5.  Signaling Protocol Usage\n   The FEC Framework [RFC6363] requires that certain\
    \ FEC Framework\n   Configuration Information be available to both the sender\
    \ and\n   receiver(s).  This configuration information is almost always\n   formulated\
    \ at the sender (or on behalf of the sender) and somehow\n   made available at\
    \ the receiver(s).  While one may envision a static\n   method to populate the\
    \ configuration information at both the sender\n   and receiver(s), it would not\
    \ be optimal, since it would (a) require\n   the knowledge of every receiver in\
    \ advance, (b) require the time and\n   means to configure each receiver and sender,\
    \ and (c) increase the\n   possibility of misconfiguration.  Hence, there is a\
    \ benefit in using\n   a dynamic method (i.e., signaling protocol) to convey the\n\
    \   configuration information between the sender and one or more\n   receivers.\n\
    \   Since the configuration information may be needed at a particular\n   receiver\
    \ versus many receivers (depending on the multimedia stream\n   being unicast\
    \ (e.g., Video on Demand (VoD); or multicast, e.g.,\n   broadcast or IPTV), we\
    \ need two types of signaling protocols -- one\n   to deliver the configuration\
    \ information to many receivers via\n   multicasting (as described in Section\
    \ 5.1), and the other to deliver\n   the configuration information to one and\
    \ only one receiver via\n   unicasting (as described in Section 5.2).\n   Figure\
    \ 1 below illustrates a sample topology showing the FEC Sender\n   and FEC Receiver\
    \ (which may or may not be the Media Sender and Media\n   Receiver, respectively)\
    \ such that FEC_Sender1 is serving\n   FEC_Receiver11, FEC_Receiver12, and FEC_Receiver13\
    \ via the multicast\n   signaling protocol, whereas FEC_Sender2 is serving only\
    \ FEC_Receiver2\n   via the unicast signaling protocol.\n          FEC_Sender2---------|\

- title: 5.1.  Signaling Protocol for Multicasting
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Signaling Protocol for Multicasting\n   This specification describes using\
    \ SAP version 2 [RFC2974] as the\n   signaling protocol to multicast the configuration\
    \ information from\n   one sender to many receivers.  The apparent advantage is\
    \ that the\n   server doesn't need to maintain any state for any receiver using\
    \ SAP.\n      SAP messages are carried over UDP over IP with destination UDP\n\
    \      port 9875, as described in [RFC2974], and a source UDP port of any\n  \
    \    available number.  The SAP message(s) MUST contain an\n      authentication\
    \ header using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)\n      authentication.\n   At the high\
    \ level, a sender, acting as the SAP announcer, signals the\n   FEC Framework\
    \ Configuration Information for each FEC Framework\n   instance available at the\
    \ sender, using the SAP message(s).  The\n   configuration information, encoded\
    \ in a suitable format as per\n   Section 4.1, is carried in the payload of the\
    \ SAP message(s).  A\n   receiver, acting as the SAP listener, listens on a well-known\
    \ UDP\n   port and at least one well-known multicast group IP address (as\n  \
    \ explained in Section 5.1.1).  This enables the receiver to receive\n   the SAP\
    \ message(s) and obtain the FEC Framework Configuration\n   Information for each\
    \ FEC Framework instance.\n   Using the configuration information, the receiver\
    \ becomes aware of\n   available FEC protection options, corresponding multicast\
    \ trees (S,G\n   or *,G addresses), etc.  The receiver may subsequently subscribe\
    \ to\n   one or more multicast trees to receive the FEC streams using out-of-\n\
    \   band multicasting techniques such as PIM [RFC4601].  This, however,\n   is\

- title: 5.1.1.  Sender Procedure
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Sender Procedure\n   The sender signals the FEC Framework Configuration\
    \ Information for\n   each FEC Framework instance in a periodic SAP announcement\
    \ message\n   [RFC2974].  The SAP announcement message is sent to a well-known\n\
    \   multicast IP address and UDP port, as specified in [RFC2974].  The\n   announcement\
    \ is multicast with the same scope as the session being\n   announced.\n   The\
    \ SAP module at the sender obtains the FEC Framework Configuration\n   Information\
    \ per instance from the 'FEC Framework' module and places\n   that in the SAP\
    \ payload accordingly.  A single SAP (announcement)\n   message must carry the\
    \ FEC Framework Configuration Information for a\n   single FEC Framework instance.\
    \  The SAP message is then sent over UDP\n   over IP.\n      While it is possible\
    \ to aggregate multiple SAP (announcement)\n      messages in a single UDP datagram\
    \ as long as the resulting UDP\n      datagram length is less than the IP MTU\
    \ of the outgoing interface,\n      this specification does not recommend it,\
    \ since there is no length\n      field in the SAP header to identify a SAP message\
    \ boundary.\n      Hence, this specification recommends that a single SAP\n  \
    \    announcement message be sent in a UDP datagram.\n   The IP packet carrying\
    \ the SAP message must be sent to a destination\n   IP address of one of the following,\
    \ depending on the selected scope:\n   - 224.2.127.254 (if IPv4 global scope 224.0.1.0-238.255.255.255\
    \ is\n     selected for the FEC stream), or\n   - ff0x:0:0:0:0:0:2:7ffe (if IPv6\
    \ multicasting is selected for the FEC\n     stream, where x is the 4-bit scope\
    \ value), or\n   - the highest multicast address (239.255.255.255, for example)\
    \ in the\n     relevant administrative scope zone (if IPv4 administrative scope\n\
    \     239.0.0.0-239.255.255.255 is selected for the FEC stream)\n   As defined\
    \ in [RFC2974], the IP packet carrying a SAP message must\n   use destination\
    \ UDP port 9875 and a source UDP port of any available\n   number.  The default\
    \ IP Time to Live (TTL) value (or Hop Limit value)\n   should be 255 at the sender,\
    \ though the sender implementation may\n   allow it to be any other value to implicitly\
    \ create the multicast\n   boundary for SAP announcements.  The IP Differentiated\
    \ Services Code\n   Point (DSCP) field may be set to any value that indicates\
    \ a desired\n   QoS treatment in the IP network.\n   The IP packet carrying the\
    \ SAP message must be sent with a source IP\n   address that is reachable by the\
    \ receiver.  The sender may assign the\n   same IP address in the 'originating\
    \ source' field of the SAP message\n   as that used in the source IP address of\
    \ the IP packet.\n   Furthermore, the FEC Framework Configuration Information\
    \ must not\n   include any of the reserved multicast group IP addresses for the\
    \ FEC\n   streams (i.e., source or repair flows), though it may use the same IP\n\
    \   address as the 'originating source' address to identify the FEC\n   streams\
    \ (i.e., source or repair flows).  Please refer to IANA\n   assignments for multicast\
    \ addresses.\n   The sender must periodically send the 'SAP announcement' message\
    \ to\n   ensure that the receiver doesn't purge the cached entry or entries\n\
    \   from the database and doesn't trigger the deletion of the FEC\n   Framework\
    \ Configuration Information.\n   While the time interval between repetitions of\
    \ an announcement can be\n   calculated as per the very sophisticated but complex\
    \ method explained\n   in [RFC2974], this document recommends a simpler method\
    \ in which the\n   user specifies the time interval in the range of 1-200 seconds,\
    \ with\n   a suggested default value of 60 seconds.  In this method, the 'time\n\
    \   interval' may be signaled in the SAP message payload, e.g., within\n   the\
    \ FEC Framework Configuration Information.\n      Note that SAP doesn't allow\
    \ the time interval to be signaled in\n      the SAP header.  Hence, the usage\
    \ of a simpler method requires\n      that the time interval be included in the\
    \ FEC Framework\n      Configuration Information if the default time interval\
    \ (60\n      seconds) for SAP message repetitions is not used.  For example,\n\
    \      the usage of the 'r=' (repeat time) field in SDP may convey the\n     \
    \ time interval value if the SDP encoding format is used.\n   The time interval\
    \ must be chosen to ensure that SAP announcement\n   messages are sent out before\
    \ the corresponding multicast routing\n   entry, e.g., (S,G) or (*,G) (corresponding\
    \ to the SAP multicast\n   tree(s)) on the router(s) times out.  (It is worth\
    \ noting that the\n   default timeout period for the multicast routing entry is\n\
    \   210 seconds, per the PIM specification [RFC4601], though the timeout\n   period\
    \ may be set to another value as allowed by the router\n   implementation.)\n\
    \      A SAP implementation may also support the complex method for\n      determining\
    \ the SAP announcement time interval and provide the\n      option to select it.\n\
    \   The sender may choose to delete the announced FEC Framework\n   Configuration\
    \ Information, as defined in Section 4 of [RFC2974].  The\n   explicit deletion\
    \ is useful if the sender no longer desires to send\n   any more FEC streams.\n\
    \   If the sender needs to modify the announced FEC Framework\n   Configuration\
    \ Information for one or more FEC instances, then the\n   sender must send a new\
    \ announcement message with a different 'Message\n   Identifier Hash' value as\
    \ per the rules described in Section 5 of\n   RFC 2974 [RFC2974].  Such an announcement\
    \ message should be sent\n   immediately (without having to wait for the time\
    \ interval) to ensure\n   that the modifications are received by the receiver\
    \ as soon as\n   possible.  The sender must also send the SAP deletion message\
    \ to\n   delete the previous SAP announcement message (i.e., with the previous\n\
    \   'Message Identifier Hash' value).\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Receiver Procedure
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Receiver Procedure\n   The receiver must listen on UDP port 9875 for\
    \ packets arriving with\n   an IP destination address of either 224.2.127.254\
    \ (if an IPv4 global\n   scope session is used for the FEC stream), ff0x:0:0:0:0:0:2:7ffe\
    \ (if\n   IPv6 is selected, where x is the 4-bit scope value), or the highest\n\
    \   IP address (239.255.255.255, for example) in the relevant\n   administrative\
    \ scope zone (if IPv4 administrative scope 239.0.0.0-\n   239.255.255.255 is selected\
    \ for the FEC stream).  These IP addresses\n   are mandated for SAP usage by RFC\
    \ 2974 [RFC2974].\n   The receiver, upon receiving a SAP announcement message,\
    \ creates an\n   entry, if it doesn't already exist, in a local database and passes\n\
    \   the FEC Framework Configuration Information from the SAP Payload\n   field\
    \ to the 'FEC Framework' module.  Each entry also maintains a\n   timeout value,\
    \ which is (re)set to five times the time interval\n   value, which in turn is\
    \ either the default of 60 seconds or the value\n   signaled by the sender.\n\
    \      Note that SAP doesn't allow the time interval to be signaled in\n     \
    \ the SAP header.  Hence, the time interval should be included in\n      the FEC\
    \ Framework Configuration Information -- for example, the\n      usage of the\
    \ 'r=' (repeat time) field in SDP to convey the time\n      interval value if\
    \ the SDP encoding format is used.\n   The timeout value associated with each\
    \ entry is reset when the\n   corresponding announcement (please see Section 5\
    \ of [RFC2974]) is\n   received.  If the timeout value for any entry reaches zero,\
    \ then that\n   entry must be deleted from the database, as described in Section\
    \ 4 of\n   [RFC2974].  The receiver, upon receiving a SAP delete message, must\n\
    \   delete the matching SAP entry in its database, as described in\n   Section\
    \ 4 of [RFC2974].\n   The deletion of a SAP entry must result in the receiver\
    \ no longer\n   using the relevant FEC Framework Configuration Information for\
    \ the\n   corresponding instance and no longer subscribing to any related FEC\n\
    \   streams.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Signaling Protocol for Unicasting
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Signaling Protocol for Unicasting\n   This document describes leveraging\
    \ any signaling protocol that is\n   already used by the unicast application,\
    \ for exchanging the FEC\n   Framework Configuration Information between two nodes.\n\
    \   For example, a multimedia (VoD) client may send a request via\n   unicasting\
    \ for a particular content to the multimedia (VoD) server,\n   which may offer\
    \ various options such as encodings, bitrates,\n   transport, etc. for the content.\
    \  The client selects the suitable\n   options and answers the server, paving\
    \ the way for the content to be\n   unicast on the chosen transport from the server\
    \ to the client.  This\n   offer/answer signaling, described in [RFC3264], is\
    \ commonly utilized\n   by many application protocols, such as SIP, RTSP, etc.\n\
    \   The fact that two nodes desiring unicast communication almost always\n   rely\
    \ on an application to first exchange the application-related\n   parameters via\
    \ the signaling protocol makes it logical to enhance\n   such signaling protocol(s)\
    \ to (a) convey the desire for the FEC\n   protection and (b) subsequently also\
    \ exchange FEC parameters, i.e.,\n   the FEC Framework Configuration Information.\
    \  This enables the node\n   acting as the offerer to offer 'FEC Framework Configuration\n\
    \   Information' for each available FEC instance and the node acting as\n   the\
    \ answerer to convey the chosen FEC Framework instance(s) to the\n   offerer.\
    \  The usage of the FEC Framework instance is explained in the\n   FEC Framework\
    \ document [RFC6363].\n   While enhancing an application's signaling protocol\
    \ to exchange FEC\n   parameters is one method (briefly explained above), an alternative\n\
    \   method would be to have a unicast-based generic protocol that could\n   be\
    \ used by two nodes, independent of the application's signaling\n   protocol.\
    \  The latter is not covered by this document, of course.\n   The remainder of\
    \ this section provides example signaling protocols\n   and explains how they\
    \ can be used to exchange the FEC Framework\n   Configuration Information.\n"
- title: 5.2.1.  SIP
  contents:
  - "5.2.1.  SIP\n   SIP [RFC3261] is an application-level signaling protocol to create,\n\
    \   modify, and terminate multimedia sessions with one or more\n   participants.\
    \  SIP also enables the participants to discover one\n   another and to agree\
    \ on a characterization of a multimedia session\n   they would like to share.\
    \  SIP runs on either TCP, UDP, or Stream\n   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\
    \ transport and uses SDP as the\n   encoding format to describe multimedia session\
    \ attributes.\n   SIP already uses an offer/answer model with SDP as described\
    \ in\n   [RFC3264] to exchange information between two nodes to establish\n  \
    \ unicast sessions between them.  This document extends the usage of\n   this\
    \ model for exchanging the FEC Framework Configuration Information\n   (described\
    \ in Section 4).  Any SDP-specific enhancements to\n   accommodate the FEC Framework\
    \ are covered in the SDP elements\n   specification [RFC6364].\n"

  contents:
  - "5.2.2.  RTSP\n   RTSP [RFC2326] is an application-level signaling protocol for\
    \ control\n   over the delivery of data with real-time properties.  RTSP provides\n\
    \   an extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of\n   real-time\
    \ data such as audio and video.  RTSP runs on either TCP or\n   UDP transports.\n\
    \   RTSP already provides an ability to extend the existing method with\n   new\
    \ parameters.  This specification defines the\n   'FEC-protection-needed' option\
    \ tag (please see Section 7 for IANA\n   Considerations) and prescribes including\
    \ it in the Require (or\n   Proxy-Require) header of SETUP (method) request messages,\
    \ so as to\n   request FEC protection for the data.\n   The node receiving such\
    \ a request either responds with a '200 OK'\n   message that includes offers,\
    \ i.e., available FEC options (e.g., FEC\n   Framework Configuration Information\
    \ for each instance) or a '551\n   Option not supported' message.  A sample of\

    \             Transport: <omitted for simplicity>\n   The requesting node (Node1)\
    \ may then send a new SETUP message to\n   convey the selected FEC protection\

    \ that if the requesting node (Node1) received a '551\n   Option not supported'\
