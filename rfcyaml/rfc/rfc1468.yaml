  - "Introduction\n   This document describes the encoding used in electronic mail\
    \ [RFC822]\n   and network news [RFC1036] messages in several Japanese networks.\
    \ It\n   was first specified by and used in JUNET [JUNET]. The encoding is now\n\
    \   also widely used in Japanese IP communities.\n   The name given to this encoding\
    \ is \"ISO-2022-JP\", which is intended\n   to be used in the \"charset\" parameter\
    \ field of MIME headers (see\n   [MIME1] and [MIME2]).\n"

  - "Description\n   The text starts in ASCII [ASCII], and switches to Japanese characters\n\
    \   through an escape sequence. For example, the escape sequence ESC $ B\n   (three\
    \ bytes, hexadecimal values: 1B 24 42) indicates that the bytes\n   following\
    \ this escape sequence are Japanese characters, which are\n   encoded in two bytes\
    \ each.  To switch back to ASCII, the escape\n   sequence ESC ( B is used.\n \
    \  The following table gives the escape sequences and the character sets\n   used\
    \ in ISO-2022-JP messages. The ISOREG number is the registration\n   number in\
    \ ISO's registry [ISOREG].\n       Esc Seq    Character Set                  ISOREG\n\
    \       ESC ( B    ASCII                             6\n       ESC ( J    JIS\
    \ X 0201-1976 (\"Roman\" set)    14\n       ESC $ @    JIS X 0208-1978       \
    \           42\n       ESC $ B    JIS X 0208-1983                  87\n   Note\
    \ that JIS X 0208 was called JIS C 6226 until the name was changed\n   on March\
    \ 1st, 1987. Likewise, JIS C 6220 was renamed JIS X 0201.\n   The \"Roman\" character\
    \ set of JIS X 0201 [JISX0201] is identical to\n   ASCII except for backslash\
    \ () and tilde (~). The backslash is\n   replaced by the Yen sign, and the tilde\
    \ is replaced by overline. This\n   set is Japan's national variant of ISO 646\
    \ [ISO646].\n   The JIS X 0208 [JISX0208] character sets consist of Kanji, Hiragana,\n\
    \   Katakana and some other symbols and characters. Each character takes\n   up\
    \ two bytes.\n   For further details about the JIS Japanese national character\
    \ set\n   standards, refer to [JISX0201] and [JISX0208].  For further\n   information\
    \ about the escape sequences, see [ISO2022] and [ISOREG].\n   If there are JIS\
    \ X 0208 characters on a line, there must be a switch\n   to ASCII or to the \"\
    Roman\" set of JIS X 0201 before the end of the\n   line (i.e., before the CRLF).\
    \ This means that the next line starts in\n   the character set that was switched\
    \ to before the end of the previous\n   line.\n   Also, the text must end in ASCII.\n\
    \   Other restrictions are given in the Formal Syntax below.\n"

- title: MIME Considerations

  - "MIME Considerations\n   The name given to the JUNET character encoding is \"\
    ISO-2022-JP\". This\n   name is intended to be used in MIME messages as follows:\n\
    \       Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-jp\n   The ISO-2022-JP encoding\
    \ is already in 7-bit form, so it is not\n   necessary to use a Content-Transfer-Encoding\
    \ header. It should be\n   noted that applying the Base64 or Quoted-Printable\
    \ encoding will\n   render the message unreadable in current JUNET software.\n\
    \   ISO-2022-JP may also be used in MIME Part 2 headers.  The \"B\"\n   encoding\
    \ should be used with ISO-2022-JP text.\n"
- title: Background Information
  contents:
  - "Background Information\n   The JUNET encoding was described in the JUNET User's\
    \ Guide [JUNET]\n   (JUNET Riyou No Tebiki Dai Ippan).\n   The encoding is based\
    \ on the particular usage of ISO 2022 announced\n   by 4/1 (see [ISO2022] for\
    \ details). However, the escape sequence\n   normally used for this announcement\
    \ is not included in ISO-2022-JP\n   messages.\n   The Kana set of JIS X 0201\
    \ is not used in ISO-2022-JP messages.\n   In the past, some systems erroneously\
    \ used the escape sequence ESC (\n   H in JUNET messages. This escape sequence\
    \ is officially registered\n   for a Swedish character set [ISOREG], and should\
    \ not be used in ISO-\n   2022-JP messages.\n   Some systems do not distinguish\
    \ between ESC ( B and ESC ( J or\n   between ESC $ @ and ESC $ B for display.\
    \ However, when relaying a\n   message to another system, the escape sequences\
    \ must not be altered\n   in any way.\n   The human user (not implementor) should\
    \ try to keep lines within 80\n   display columns, or, preferably, within 75 (or\
    \ so) columns, to allow\n   insertion of \">\" at the beginning of each line in\
    \ excerpts. Each JIS\n   X 0208 character takes up two columns, and the escape\
    \ sequences do\n   not take up any columns. The implementor is reminded that JIS\
    \ X 0208\n   characters take up two bytes and should not be split in the middle\
    \ to\n   break lines for displaying, etc.\n   The JIS X 0208 standard was revised\
    \ in 1990, to add two characters at\n   the end of the table. Although ISO 2022\
    \ specifies special additional\n   escape sequences to indicate the use of revised\
    \ character sets, it is\n   suggested here not to make use of this special escape\
    \ sequence in\n   ISO-2022-JP text, even if the two characters added to JIS X\
    \ 0208 in\n   1990 are used.\n   For further information about Japanese character\
    \ encodings such as PC\n   codes, FTP locations of implementations, etc, see \"\
    Electronic\n   Handling of Japanese Text\" [JPN.INF].\n"
