  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol
    (PCEP) as a\n   communication mechanism between a Path Computation Client (PCC)
    and a\n   Path Computation Element (PCE), or between a PCE and a PCE, that\n   enables
    computation of MPLS-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs).\n   [RFC8231] specifies extensions
    to PCEP to enable stateful control of\n   MPLS-TE LSPs.  It describes two modes
    of operation: passive stateful\n   PCE and active stateful PCE.  Further, [RFC8281]
    describes the setup,\n   maintenance, and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs for the
    stateful PCE\n   model.  In this document, the focus is on the active stateful
    PCE,\n   where the LSPs are controlled by the PCE.\n   Over time, based on the
    varying traffic pattern, an LSP established\n   with a certain bandwidth may require
    adjustment of the bandwidth\n   reserved in the network dynamically.  The head-end
    Label Switching\n   Router (LSR) monitors the actual bandwidth demand of the established\n
    \  LSP and periodically computes new bandwidth.  The head-end LSR\n   automatically
    adjusts the bandwidth reservation of the LSP based on\n   the computed bandwidth.
    \ This feature, when available in the head-end\n   LSR implementation, is commonly
    referred to as auto-bandwidth.  The\n   auto-bandwidth feature is described in
    detail in Section 4 of this\n   document.\n   In the model considered in this
    document, the PCC (head-end of the\n   LSP) collects the traffic rate samples
    flowing through the LSP and\n   calculates the new Adjusted Bandwidth.  The PCC
    reports the\n   calculated bandwidth to be adjusted to the PCE.  This is similar
    to\n   the passive stateful PCE model: while the passive stateful PCE uses a\n
    \  path request/reply mechanism, the active stateful PCE uses a report/\n   update
    mechanism.  With a PCE-initiated LSP, the PCC is requested\n   during the LSP
    initiation to monitor and calculate the new Adjusted\n   Bandwidth.  [RFC8051]
    describes the use case for auto-bandwidth\n   adjustment for passive and active
    stateful PCEs.\n   Another approach would be to send the measured values themselves
    to\n   the PCE, which is considered out of scope for this document.\n   This document
    defines the PCEP extensions needed to support an auto-\n   bandwidth feature in
    an active stateful PCE model where the LSP\n   bandwidth to be adjusted is calculated
    on the PCC (head-end of the\n   LSP).  The use of PCE to calculate the bandwidth
    to be adjusted is\n   out of scope of this document.\n"

      PCC is considered to be the head-end LSR of the\n   LSP.  Other types of PCCs
      are not in scope.\n   The following auto-bandwidth terminology is defined in
      this document.\n   Maximum Average Bandwidth (MaxAvgBw):  The maximum average
      bandwidth\n      represents the current 'measured' traffic bandwidth demand
      of the\n      LSP during a time interval.  This is the maximum value of the\n
      \     traffic bandwidth rate samples (Bandwidth-Samples) in a given time\n      interval.\n
      \  Adjusted Bandwidth:  This is the auto-bandwidth 'computed' bandwidth\n      that
      is used to adjust the bandwidth reservation of the LSP.\n   Sample-Interval:
      \ The periodic time interval at which the measured\n      traffic rate of the
      LSP is collected as a Bandwidth-Sample.\n   Bandwidth-Sample:  The Bandwidth-Sample
      of the measured traffic rate\n      of the LSP collected at every Sample-Interval.\n
      \  Maximum-Bandwidth:  The Maximum-Bandwidth that can be reserved for\n      the
      LSP.\n   Minimum-Bandwidth:  The Minimum-Bandwidth that can be reserved for\n
      \     the LSP.\n   Up-Adjustment-Interval:  The periodic time interval at which
      the\n      bandwidth adjustment should be made using the MaxAvgBw when\n      MaxAvgBw
      is greater than the current bandwidth reservation of the\n      LSP.\n   Down-Adjustment-Interval:
      \ The periodic time interval at which the\n      bandwidth adjustment should
      be made using the MaxAvgBw when\n      MaxAvgBw is less than the current bandwidth
      reservation of the\n      LSP.\n   Up-Adjustment-Threshold:  This parameter
      is used to decide when the\n      LSP bandwidth should be adjusted.  If the
      percentage or absolute\n      difference between the current MaxAvgBw and the
      current bandwidth\n      reservation is greater than or equal to the threshold
      value, the\n      LSP bandwidth is adjusted (upsized) to the current bandwidth\n
      \     demand (Adjusted Bandwidth) at the Up-Adjustment-Interval expiry.\n   Down-Adjustment-Threshold:
      \ This parameter is used to decide when the\n      LSP bandwidth should be adjusted.
      \ If the percentage or absolute\n      difference between the current bandwidth
      reservation and the\n      current MaxAvgBw is greater than or equal to the
      threshold value,\n      the LSP bandwidth is adjusted (downsized) to the current
      bandwidth\n      demand (Adjusted Bandwidth) at the Down-Adjustment-Interval\n
      \     expiry.\n   Overflow-Count:  This parameter is used to decide when the
      LSP\n      bandwidth should be adjusted when there is a sudden increase in\n
      \     traffic demand.  This value indicates how many times,\n      consecutively,
      that the percentage or absolute difference between\n      the current MaxAvgBw
      and the current bandwidth reservation of the\n      LSP needs to be greater
      than or equal to the Overflow-Threshold\n      value in order to meet the overflow
      condition.\n   Overflow-Threshold:  This parameter is used to decide when the
      LSP\n      bandwidth should be adjusted when there is a sudden increase in\n
      \     traffic demand.  If the percentage or absolute difference between\n      the
      current MaxAvgBw and the current bandwidth reservation of the\n      LSP is
      greater than or equal to the threshold value, the overflow\n      condition
      is said to be met.  The LSP bandwidth is adjusted to the\n      current bandwidth
      demand, bypassing the Up-Adjustment-Interval if\n      the overflow condition
      is met consecutively for the Overflow-\n      Count.  The Overflow-Threshold
      needs to be greater than or equal\n      to the Up-Adjustment-Threshold.\n   Underflow-Count:
      \ This parameter is used to decide when the LSP\n      bandwidth should be adjusted
      when there is a sudden decrease in\n      traffic demand.  This value indicates
      how many times,\n      consecutively, that the percentage or absolute difference
      between\n      the current MaxAvgBw and the current bandwidth reservation of
      the\n      LSP needs to be greater than or equal to the Underflow-Threshold\n
      \     value in order to meet the underflow condition.\n   Underflow-Threshold:
      \ This parameter is used to decide when the LSP\n      bandwidth should be adjusted
      when there is a sudden decrease in\n      traffic demand.  If the percentage
      or absolute difference between\n      the current MaxAvgBw and the current bandwidth
      reservation of the\n      LSP is greater than or equal to the threshold value,
      the underflow\n      condition is said to be met.  The LSP bandwidth is adjusted
      to the\n      current bandwidth demand, bypassing the Down-Adjustment-Interval\n
      \     if the underflow condition is met consecutively for the Underflow-\n      Count.
      \ The Underflow-Threshold needs to be greater than or equal\n      to the Down-Adjustment-Threshold.\n
      \  Minimum-Threshold:  When percentage-based thresholds are in use, they\n      are
      accompanied by this Minimum-Threshold, which is used to ensure\n      that the
      magnitude of deviation of the calculated LSP bandwidth to\n      be adjusted
      from the current bandwidth reservations exceeds a\n      specific non-percentage-based
      criterion (represented as an\n      absolute bandwidth value) before any adjustments
      are made.  This\n      serves to suppress unnecessary auto-bandwidth adjustments
      and\n      resignaling of the LSP at low bandwidth values.\n"

    - "4.1.  Auto-Bandwidth Overview\n   The auto-bandwidth feature allows automatic
      and dynamic adjustment of\n   the reserved bandwidth of an LSP over time (i.e.,
      without network\n   operator intervention) to accommodate the varying traffic
      demand of\n   the LSP.  If the traffic flowing through the LSP is lower than
      the\n   configured or current reserved bandwidth of the LSP, the extra\n   bandwidth
      is being reserved needlessly and is being wasted.\n   Conversely, if the actual
      traffic flowing through the LSP is higher\n   than the configured or current
      reserved bandwidth of the LSP, it can\n   potentially cause congestion or packet
      loss in the network.  The\n   initial LSP bandwidth can be set to an arbitrary
      value (including\n   zero).  In practice, it can be set to an expected value
      based on\n   design and planning.  The head-end LSR monitors the actual traffic\n
      \  flowing through the LSP and uses that information to adjust the\n   bandwidth

      disruption to the traffic flow\n   carried by the LSP.  One way to achieve this
      is to use the make-\n   before-break signaling method [RFC3209].\n"
    title: 4.1.  Auto-Bandwidth Overview
  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Auto-Bandwidth Theory of Operation\n   This section describes the auto-bandwidth
      feature in a general way.\n   When the auto-bandwidth feature is enabled, the
      measured traffic rate\n   is periodically sampled at each Sample-Interval by
      the PCC when the\n   PCC is the head-end node of the LSP.  The Sample-Interval
      can be\n   configured by an operator, with a default value of 5 minutes.  A
      very\n   low Sample-Interval could have some undesirable interactions with\n
      \  transport protocols (see Section 6.6).\n   The traffic rate samples are accumulated
      over the Adjustment-Interval\n   period (in the Up or Down direction).  The
      period can be configured\n   by an operator, with a default value of 24 hours.
      \ The PCC in charge\n   of calculating the bandwidth to be adjusted can decide
      to adjust the\n   bandwidth of the LSP to the highest traffic rate sample (MaxAvgBw)\n
      \  amongst the set of Bandwidth-Samples collected over the Adjustment-\n   Interval
      period (in the Up or Down direction) depending on the\n   operator policy.\n
      \  Note that the highest traffic rate sample could be higher or lower\n   than
      the current LSP bandwidth.  The LSP is adjusted (upsized) to the\n   current
      bandwidth demand (MaxAvgBW) only if the difference between\n   the current bandwidth
      demand (MaxAvgBw) and the current bandwidth\n   reservation is greater than
      or equal to the Adjustment-Threshold.\n   The Adjustment-Threshold could be
      an absolute value or a percentage.\n   The threshold can be configured by an
      operator, with a default value\n   of 5 percent.  Similarly, if the difference
      between the current\n   bandwidth reservation and the current bandwidth demand
      (MaxAvgBw) is\n   greater than or equal to the Down-Adjustment-Threshold (percentage
      or\n   absolute value), the LSP bandwidth is adjusted (downsized) to the\n   current
      bandwidth demand (MaxAvgBw).  Some LSPs are less eventful,\n   while other LSPs
      may encounter a lot of changes in the traffic\n   pattern.  The thresholds and
      intervals for bandwidth adjustment are\n   configured based on the traffic pattern
      of the LSP.\n   In order to avoid frequent resignaling, an operator may set
      a longer\n   Adjustment-Interval value (Up and/or Down).  However, a longer\n
      \  Adjustment-Interval can result in the undesirable effect of masking\n   sudden
      changes in the traffic demands of an LSP.  To avoid this, the\n   auto-bandwidth
      feature may force the Adjustment-Interval to\n   prematurely expire and adjust
      the LSP bandwidth to accommodate the\n   sudden bursts of increase in traffic
      demand as an overflow condition\n   or decrease in traffic demand as an underflow
      condition.  An operator\n   needs to configure appropriate values for the Overflow-Threshold
      and/\n   or Underflow-Threshold parameters, and they do not have default\n   values
      defined in this document.\n   All thresholds in this document could be represented
      in both absolute\n   value and percentage and could be used together.  This
      is provided to\n   accommodate cases where the LSP bandwidth reservation may
      become very\n   large or very small over time.  For example, an operator may
      use the\n   percentage threshold to handle small to large bandwidth values and\n
      \  absolute values to handle very large bandwidth values.  The auto-\n   bandwidth
      adjustment is made when either one of the two thresholds,\n   the absolute or
      percentage, is crossed.\n   When using the (adjustment/overflow/underflow) percentage
      thresholds,\n   if the LSP bandwidth changes rapidly at very low values, it
      may\n   trigger frequent auto-bandwidth adjustments due to the crossing of\n
      \  the percentage thresholds.  This can lead to unnecessary resignaling\n   of
      the LSPs in the network.  This is suppressed by setting the\n   Minimum-Threshold
      parameters along with the percentage thresholds.\n   The auto-bandwidth adjustment
      is only made if the LSP bandwidth\n   crosses both the percentage threshold
      and the Minimum-Threshold\n   parameters.\n"

  - contents:
    - "4.3.  Scaling Considerations\n   It should be noted that any bandwidth change
      requires resignaling of\n   an LSP, which can further trigger preemption of
      lower-priority LSPs\n   in the network.  When deployed under scale, this can
      lead to a\n   signaling churn in the network.  The auto-bandwidth application\n
      \  algorithm is thus advised to take this into consideration before\n   adjusting
      the LSP bandwidth.  Operators are advised to set the values\n   of various auto-bandwidth
      adjustment parameters appropriate for the\n   deployed LSP scale.\n   If a PCE
      gets overwhelmed, it can notify the PCC to temporarily\n   suspend the reporting
      of the new LSP bandwidth to be adjusted.\n   Similarly, if a PCC gets overwhelmed
      due to signaling churn, it can\n   notify the PCE to temporarily suspend new
      LSP setup requests.  See\n   Section 5.7 of this document.\n"

      successful instantiation of the\n   LSP, the PCC automatically delegates the
      LSP to the PCE and generates\n   a PCRpt message to provide the status report

      delegation, the BANDWIDTH object of type 1 is used to\n   specify the requested

    title: 5.6.  The PCRpt Message
  - contents:
    - "5.7.  The PCNtf Message\n   As per [RFC5440], the PCEP Notification message
      (PCNtf) can be sent\n   by a PCEP speaker to notify its peer of a specific event.\n
      \  A PCEP speaker (PCE or PCC) SHOULD notify its PCEP peer (PCC or PCE)\n   when
      it is in an overwhelmed state due to the auto-bandwidth feature.\n   An implementation
      needs to make an attempt to send this notification\n   (when overwhelmed by
      auto-bandwidth adjustments) unless sending this\n   notification would only
      serve to increase the load further.  Note\n   that when the notification is
      not received, the PCEP speaker would\n   continue to request bandwidth adjustments
      even when they cannot be\n   handled in a timely fashion.\n   Upon receipt of
      an auto-bandwidth overwhelm notification, the peer\n   SHOULD NOT send any PCEP
      messages related to auto-bandwidth\n   adjustment.  If a PCEP message related
      to auto-bandwidth adjustment\n   is received while in an overwhelmed state,
      it MUST be ignored.\n   *  When a PCEP speaker is overwhelmed, it SHOULD notify
      its peer by\n      sending a PCNtf message with Notification-type = 5 (Auto-Bandwidth\n
      \     Overwhelm State) and Notification-value = 1 (Entering Auto-\n      Bandwidth
      Overwhelm State).  Optionally, an OVERLOADED-DURATION\n      TLV [RFC5440] MAY
      be included to specify the time period during\n      which no further PCEP messages
      related to auto-bandwidth\n      adjustment should be sent.\n   *  When the
      PCEP speaker is no longer in the overwhelm state and is\n      available to
      process the auto-bandwidth adjustments, it SHOULD\n      notify its peers by
      sending a PCNtf message with Notification-type\n      = 5 (Auto-Bandwidth Overwhelm
      State) and Notification-value = 2\n      (Clearing Auto-Bandwidth Overwhelm
      State).  A PCEP speaker SHOULD\n      send such notification to all peers if
      a Notification message\n      (Notification-type = 5, Notification-value = 1)
      was sent earlier.\n      This message is not sent if an OVERLOADED-DURATION
      TLV was\n      included and the PCEP speakers wishes for the peer to wait for
      the\n      expiration of that period of time before receiving further PCEP\n
      \     messages related to auto-bandwidth adjustment.\n   When the auto-bandwidth
      feature is deployed, a PCE can send this\n   notification to a PCC when it reports
      frequent auto-bandwidth\n   adjustments.  If a PCC is overwhelmed with resignaling,
      it can also\n   notify the PCE to not adjust the LSP bandwidth while in the
      overwhelm\n   state.\n   Some dampening notification procedure (as per [RFC5440])
      to avoid\n   oscillations of the overwhelm state is RECOMMENDED.  On receipt
      of an\n   auto-bandwidth overwhelm notification from the PCE, a PCC should\n
      \  consider the impact on the entire network.  Moving the delegations of\n   auto-bandwidth-enabled
      LSPs to another PCE could cause further\n   overloading.\n"

      on network operations, an\n   implementation SHOULD allow a limit to be placed
      on the number of\n   LSPs that can be enabled with the auto-bandwidth feature.
      \ For each\n   LSP enabled with the auto-bandwidth feature, there is an extra
      load\n   on the PCC, as it needs to monitor the traffic and report the\n   calculated
      bandwidth to be adjusted to the PCE.  The PCE further\n   recomputes paths based
      on the requested bandwidth and updates the\n   path to the PCC, which, in turn,
      triggers the resignaling of the\n   path.  All these steps add extra load and
      churn in the network; thus,\n   the operator needs to take due care while enabling
      these features on\n   a number of LSPs.\n   An implementation MAY allow a limit
      to be placed on the rate of auto-\n   bandwidth-related messages sent by a PCEP
      speaker and received by a\n   peer.  An implementation SHOULD also allow notifications
      to be sent\n   when a PCEP speaker is overwhelmed or when the rate of messages\n
      \  reaches a threshold.\n   Due care is required by the operator if a Sample-Interval
      value\n   significantly smaller than the default (5 minutes) is used, as small\n
      \  Sample-Interval values, e.g., 1 minute or less, could cause\n   undesirable
      interactions with transport protocols.  These undesirable\n   interactions result
      from providing insufficient time for transport\n   protocol reactions to a prior
      bandwidth adjustment to settle down\n   before Bandwidth-Samples are taken for
