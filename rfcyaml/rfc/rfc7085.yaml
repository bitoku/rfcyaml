  - "Abstract\n   Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and\
    \ the\n   Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Security\n\
    \   and Stability Advisory Committee have focused on the problems that\n   the\
    \ DNS is likely to experience with top-level domains (TLDs) that\n   contain address\
    \ records (so-called \"dotless domains\").  In order to\n   help researchers determine\
    \ the extent of the issues with dotless\n   domains, this document lists the current\
    \ dotless TLDs and gives a\n   script for finding them.  This document lists data\
    \ about dotless TLDs\n   but does not address the policy and technology issues\
    \ other than to\n   point to the statements of others.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the past few years, well-respected groups have issued\
    \ documents\n   about top-level domains in the DNS that contain address records\n\
    \   (so-called \"dotless domains\").  The Security and Stability Advisory\n  \
    \ Committee (SSAC) of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and\n   Numbers\
    \ (ICANN) issued a report called \"Report on Dotless Domains\"\n   [SAC053] in\
    \ February 2012.  The Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\n   issued a statement\
    \ called \"Dotless Domains Considered Harmful\"\n   [IAB-DOTLESS] in July 2013.\
    \  The New gTLD Program Committee of the\n   ICANN Board of Directors (NGPC) approved\
    \ a resolution on dotless\n   domains [NGPC-DOTLESS] in August 2013.  (The authors\
    \ of this document\n   note that they are not on the SSAC, the IAB, or the ICANN\
    \ Board.)\n   All of these documents consider the effects of dotless domains\n\
    \   without describing the extent of their current deployment.  In order\n   to\
    \ help researchers determine the extent of the problems with dotless\n   domains,\
    \ this document lists the known dotless domains at the time of\n   publication\
    \ and shows how researchers can find them in the future.\n   In this document,\
    \ we consider any TLD with an A, AAAA, and/or MX\n   record at the apex to be\
    \ dotless.  This document is meant to provide\n   current data to the Internet\
    \ community but does not give advice.\n   Many people have expressed a belief\
    \ that ICANN prohibits all TLDs\n   from being dotless.  That belief is not true;\
    \ ICANN's policies apply\n   only to their contracted TLDs.  This document shows\
    \ the extent to\n   which dotless domains exist today.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Current Dotless Domains\n   This section shows the dotless domains we found\
    \ on September 3, 2013,\n   using the script in Appendix A.  The data was nearly\
    \ constant for\n   many months, with very few additions or deletions of records.\n\
    \   We checked every TLD in the root zone to see which ones had A, AAAA,\n   or\
    \ MX records.  We found that about 5% of the TLDs did, and all of\n   the TLDs\
    \ that do are two-letter TLDs or country code TLDs (which are\n   also known as\
    \ ccTLDs).\n"
