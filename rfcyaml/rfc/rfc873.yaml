    \                  THE ILLUSION OF VENDOR SUPPORT\n                          \
    \    M.A. PADLIPSKY\n                           THE MITRE CORPORATION\n      \
    \                    Bedford, Massachusetts\f          The sometimes-held position\
    \ that \"vendor supplied\"\n     intercomputer networking protocols based upon\
    \ the International\n     Standards Organization's Reference Model for Open System\n\
    \     Interconnection are worth waiting for, in particular in\n     preference\
    \ to protocols based upon the ARPANET Reference Model\n     (ARM), is shown to\
    \ be fallacious.\n          The paper is a companion piece to M82-47, M82-48,\
    \ M82-50,\n     and M82-51.\n                      THE ILLUSION OF VENDOR SUPPORT\n\
    \                              M. A. Padlipsky\n     Introduction\n          Even\
    \ one or two members of the DoD Protocol Standards\n     Technical Panel join\
    \ with many others (including, apparently,\n     some members of the DoD Protocol\
    \ Standards Steering Group, and\n     clearly, somebody at the GAO) in expressing\
    \ a desire to \"go with\n     vendor-supported intercomputer networking protocols\
    \ instead of\n     using our own.\"  The author's view of the implications of\
    \ this\n     desire should be clear from the title of this paper.  What\n    \
    \ evidence, then, is there to so stigmatize what is clearly a\n     well-meant\
    \ desire to save the Government money?\n     Scope\n          First, we must consider\
    \ what is meant by \"vendor-supported\n     protocols.\"  It can't be just X.25,\
    \ because that only gets you\n     through the network layer whether you're appealing\
    \ to the\n     International Standards Organization's widely-publicized\n    \
    \ Reference Model for Open System Interconnection (ISORM) or to the\n     unfortunately\
    \ rather tacit reference model (ARM) to which the\n     ARPANET protocols (e.g.,\
    \ TCP, IP, Telnet, FTP) were designed.  It\n     also can't be just X.25 and X.28/X.29\
    \ (even with X.75 tossed in\n     to handle \"internetting\" and X.121 for addressing)\
    \ because: 1.\n     They don't serve as a protocol suite for resource sharing\
    \ (also\n     known as OSI), but rather only allow for remote access [1]. 2.\n\
    \     They (coming as they do from the Consultative Committee on\n     International\
    \ Telegraphy and Telephony--and including one or two\n     other protocols, in\
    \ reality) don't even constitute the full\n     protocol suite being worked on\
    \ by the U. S. National Bureau of\n     Standards, much less the somewhat different\
    \ suite being evolved\n     by ISO.  So it must be a suite from NBS or ISO, and\
    \ for present\n     purposes we needn't differentiate between them as their Reference\n\
    \     Models are close enough to be shorthanded as the ISORM.\n     Timeliness\n\
    \          Realizing that we're being asked to consider an\n     ISORM-related\
    \ protocol suite as what the vendors are expected to\n     support has one immediate\
    \ consequence which in some sense can be\n     considered to dominate all of the\
    \ other points to be raised:\n     That is, the DoD procurement process entails\
    \ quite long lead\n     times.  Yet the ISORM suite is by no means complete at\
    \ present.\n     Without prejudice to its\n     RFC 873                      \
    \                      September 1982\n     merits or demerits, only X.25 (as\
    \ levels 1-3, and with some\n     ambiguity as to what level X.75 belongs at)\
    \ is as yet firmly in\n     the ISORM suite (which it will be convenient to refer\
    \ to as\n     \"ISORMS\"), and there is even some doubt as to how firmly they're\n\
    \     there.  (E.g., a British observer at a recent PSTP meeting\n     assured\
    \ the author that \"We in the U.K. don't believe X.25 is\n     officially part\
    \ of the ISORM.\") There are proposals which have\n     been circulating for some\
    \ time at Level 4, and less far along\n     through the international (or even\
    \ national, remembering NBS)\n     standardization process, ones at Level(s) 5-7.\
    \  It must be noted\n     that:  1.  These are by and large \"paper protocols\"\
    \ (that is,\n     they have not been subjected to the test of actual use).  2.\n\
    \     Even ISO and NBS's warmest supporters acknowledge that the\n     standardization\
    \ process \"takes years.\"  So if the DoD is to avoid\n     buying what might\
    \ turn out to be a series of pigs in a series of\n     pokes, it can't wait for\
    \ the ISORMS.\n          On the other side of the coin, the DoD is letting\n \
    \    intercomputer networking contracts right now.  And, right now,\n     there\
    \ does exist a suite of protocols designed to the ARPANET\n     Reference Model\
    \ (ARMS, with no pun intended).  Implementations of\n     the ARMS already exist\
    \ for a number of operating systems already\n     in use in the DoD.  Now, it\
    \ is not argued that the ARMS protocols\n     come \"for free\" in upcoming acquisitions\
    \ (contractors fuss about\n     the style of the available specifications, system\
    \ maintainers\n     fear incursions of non-vendor supplied code into operating\n\
    \     systems, and so on), but it is unarguable that the ARMS can be\n     procured\
    \ significantly more rapidly than the ISORMS.  (It is also\n     unarguable that\
    \ those who speak of their unwillingness to see the\n     DoD \"develop new protocols\
    \ rather than employ international\n     standards\" haven't done their homework;\
    \ we're not talking about\n     new protocols in the ARMS, we're talking about\
    \ protocols that\n     have been in real use for years.)\n     Quality of Support\n\
    \          The timeliness argument can lead to a counterargument that\n     the\
    \ ISORMS is \"worth waiting for,\" though, so we're not done yet.\n     Let's\
    \ look further at what \"vendor support\" means.  Clearly, the\n     proponents\
    \ of the position expect that vendors' implementations\n     of protocols will\
    \ be in conformance with the Standards for those\n     protocols.  Given the nature\
    \ of these specifications, though,\n     what can we infer about the quality of\
    \ support we can expect from\n     the vendors?\n          There are two problem\
    \ areas immediately apparent:\n     ambiguities and options.  Let's take ambiguities\
    \ first.  The\n     following are some of the questions raised by knowledgable\n\
    \     observers about the present state of the ISORMS:\n     RFC 873         \
    \                                   September 1982\n          1.   Can an X.25\
    \ comm subnet offer alternate routing?  (The\n               answer depends on\
    \ whether \"DCE's\" are expected to\n               follow X.25 between themselves.\
    \  The situation is\n               further complicated by the fact that some\
    \ ISORM\n               advocates don't even include the Data Communication\n\
    \               Elements in their depictions of the Model; this leads\n      \
    \         to the metaphorical question* \"Are there parking\n               garages\
    \ between the highrises?\")  If you can conform to\n               X.25 and not\
    \ offer alternate routing--which certainly\n               appears to be consistent\
    \ with the spec, and might even\n               be construed as required by it--the\
    \ DoD's inherent\n               interest in \"survivability\" cannot be served\
    \ by you.\n          2.   Can an X.75 internet offer alternate gatewaying?  (The\n\
    \               answer is almost surely no, unless the X.75 spec is\n        \
    \       re-written.)  If not, again the DoD's interest is not\n              \
    \ served.\n          3.   Does \"Expedited Data\" have semantics with regard to\
    \ the\n               L4-L5/L7 interface?  (Not as I read the spec, by the\n \
    \              way.) If not, the ISORMS lacks the ability to convey an\n     \
    \          \"Out-of-Band-Signal\" to an Application protocol.  (This\n       \
    \        leads to the metaphorical question, \"What good is an\n             \
    \  SST if there's nobody on duty at the Customs Shed?\")\n          4.   Must\
    \ all layers be traversed on each transmission?\n               (There are rumors\
    \ of a new ISORM \"null-layer\" concept;\n               it's not in the last\
    \ version I looked at, however, and\n               apparently the answer is yes\
    \ at present.)  If so, the\n               DoD's inherent interest in efficiency/timeliness\
    \ cannot\n               be served.  (This leads to the metaphorical question,\n\
    \               \"Are there elevators inside the highrises, or just\n        \
    \       staircases?\")\n          5.   Can an implementation be in conformance\
    \ with the ISORM\n               and yet flout the prescription that \"N-entities\
    \ must\n               communicate with each other by means of N-1 entities\"\
    ?\n               (Not as I read the spec.)  If not, again\n               implementations\
    \ must be inefficient, because the\n               prescription represents an\
    \ inappropriate legislation of\n               implementation detail which can\
    \ only lead to\n               inefficient implementations.\n     _______________\n\
    \     *  This and other metaphorical questions are dealt with at\n        greater\
    \ length in reference [2].\n     RFC 873                                     \
    \       September 1982\n          6.   Is each layer one protocol or many?  (The\
    \ point quoted\n               in 5 would seem to imply the latter, but many ISORM\n\
    \               advocates claim it's the former except for L1 and L7.)\n     \
    \          If each layer is a \"monolith\", the DoD's interest is\n          \
    \     not served because there are many circumstances in\n               which\
    \ applications of interest require different L1-3\n               and L4 protocols\
    \ in particular, and almost surely\n               different L5 and L6 protocols.\
    \  (Areas of concern:\n               Packetized Speech, Packet Radio, etc.)\n\
    \          The upshot of these ambiguities (and we haven't exhausted\n     the\
    \ subject) is that different vendors could easily offer\n     ISORMS's in good\
    \ faith which didn't interoperate \"off-the-shelf\".\n     Granted, they could\
    \ almost certainly be fixed, but not cheaply.\n     (It is also interesting to\
    \ note that a recent ANSI X3T5 meeting\n     decided to vote against acceptance\
    \ of the ISORM as a\n     standard--while endorsing it as valuable descriptively--because\n\
    \     of that standards committee's realization of just the point we\n     are\
    \ making here:  that requiring contractual compliance with a\n     Reference Model\
    \ can only be desirable if the Reference Model were\n     articulated with utter--and\
    \ probably humanly\n     unattainable--precision.)\n          The area of options\
    \ is also a source for concern over future\n     interoperability of ISORMS implementations\
    \ from different\n     vendors. There's no need to go into detail because the\
    \ broad\n     concern borders on the obvious:  What happens when Vendor A's\n\
    \     implementations rely on the presence of an optional feature that\n     Vendor\
    \ B's implementations don't choose to supply?  Somebody\n     winds up paying--and\
    \ it's unlikely to be either Vendor.\n          On the other side of the coin,\
    \ the ARMS designers were all\n     colleagues who met together frequently to\
    \ resolve ambiguities and\n     refine optionality in common.  Not that the ARMS\
    \ protocols are\n     held to be flawless, but they're much further along than\
    \ the\n     ISORMS.\n          To conclude this section, then, there are grounds\
    \ to suspect\n     that the quality of vendor support will be low unless the price\n\
    \     of vendor support is high.\n     Nature of the Design Process\n        \
    \  The advantage of having colleagues design protocols touched\n     on above\
    \ leads to another area which gives rise to concern over\n     how valuable vendor-supported\
    \ protocols really are.  Let's\n     consider how international standards are\
    \ arrived at:\n     RFC 873                                            September\
    \ 1982\n          The first problem has to do with just who participates in\n\
    \     the international standardization process.  The author has\n     occasionally\
    \ chided two different acquaintances from NBS that\n     they should do something\
    \ about setting standards for membership\n     on standards committees.  The uniform\
    \ response is to the effect\n     that \"They are, after all, voluntary standard\
    \ organizations, and\n     we take what we're given.\"  Just how much significance\
    \ is\n     properly attached to this insight is problematical.  Even the\n   \
    \  line of argument that runs, \"How can you expect those\n     institutions which\
    \ have votes to send their best technical people\n     to a standards committee?\
    \  Those are precisely the people they\n     want to keep at home, working away,\"\
    \ while enticing, does not,\n     after all, guarantee that standards committees\
    \ will attract only\n     less-competent technicians.  There are even a few Old\
    \ Network\n     Boys from the ARPANET involved with the ISORM, and at least one\n\
    \     at NBS.  However, when it is realized that the rule that only\n     active\
    \ implementers of TCP were allowed on the design team even\n     precluded the\
    \ present author's attendance (one of the oldest of\n     the Old Network Boys,\
    \ and the coiner of the phrase, at that), it\n     should be clear that the ARMS\
    \ enjoys an almost automatic\n     advantage when it comes to technical quality\
    \ over the ISORMS,\n     without even appealing to the acknowledged-by-most politicization\n\
    \     of the international standards arena.\n          What, though, of the NBS's\
    \ independent effort?  They have\n     access to the experienced designers who\
    \ evolved the ARMS, don't\n     they?  One would think so, but in actual practice\
    \ the NBS's\n     perception of the political necessities of their situation led\n\
    \     one of their representatives at a PSTP (the Department of Defense\n    \
    \ Protocol Standards Technical Panel) meeting to reply to a\n     reminder that\
    \ one of the features of their proposed Transport\n     Protocol was a recapitulation\
    \ of an early ARPANET Horror Story\n     and would consume inordinate amounts\
    \ of CPU time on participating\n     Hosts only with a statement that \"the NBS\
    \ Transport Protocol has\n     to be acceptable as ECMA [the European Computer\
    \ Manufacturer's\n     Association] Class 4.\" And even though NBS went to one\
    \ of the\n     traditional ARPANET-related firms for most of their protocol\n\
    \     proposals, curiously enough in all the Features Analyses the\n     author\
    \ has seen the features attributed to protocols in the ARMS\n     are almost as\
    \ likely to be misstated as not.\n          The conclusion we should draw from\
    \ all this is not that\n     there's something wrong with the air in Gaithersburg,\
    \ but rather\n     that there's something bracing in the air that is exhaled by\n\
    \     technical people whose different \"home systems'\" idiosyncracies\n    \
    \ lead naturally to an intellectual cross-fertilization, on the one\n     hand,\
    \ and a tacit agreement that \"doing it right\" takes\n     precedence over \"\
    doing it expediently,\" on the other hand.  (If\n     that sounds too corny, the\
    \ reader should be aware that the author\n     attended a large number of\n  \
    \   RFC 873                                            September 1982\n     ARPANET\
    \ protocol design meetings even if he wasn't eligible for\n     TCP: in order\
    \ to clarify our Host-parochial biases, we screamed\n     at each other a lot,\
    \ but we got the job done.)\n          One other aspect of the international standardization\n\
    \     process has noteworthy unfortunate implications for the resultant\n    \
    \ designs: However one might feel on a technical level about the\n     presence\
    \ of at least seven layers (some seem to be undergoing\n     mitosis and growing\
    \ \"sublayers\"), this leads to a real problem at\n     the organizational--psychological\
    \ level.  For each layer gets its\n     own committee, and each committee is vulnerable\
    \ to Parkinson's\n     Law, and each layer is in danger of becoming an expansionist\n\
    \     fiefdom ....  If your protocol designers are, on the other hand,\n     mainly\
    \ working system programmers when they're at home--as they\n     tend to be in\
    \ the ARPANET--they are far less inclined to make\n     their layers their careers.\
    \  And if experience is weighted\n     heavily--as it usually was in the ARPANET--the\
    \ same designers\n     tend to be involved with all or most of the protocols in\
    \ your\n     suite.  This not only militates against empire building, it also\n\
    \     minimizes misunderstandings over the interfaces between\n     protocols.\n\
    \     \"Space-Time\" Considerations\n          At the risk of beating a downed\
    \ horse, there's one other\n     problem area with the belief that \"Vendor supplied\
    \ protocols will\n     be worth waiting for\" which really must be touched on.\
    \  Let's\n     examine the likely motives of the Vendors with respect to\n   \
    \  \"space-time\" considerations.  That is, the system programmer\n     designers\
    \ of the ARMS were highly motivated to keep protocol\n     implementations small\
    \ and efficient in order to conserve the very\n     resources they were trying\
    \ to make sharable:  the Hosts' CPU\n     cycles and memory locations.  Are Vendors\
    \ similarly motivated?\n          For some, the reminder that \"IBM isn't in business\
    \ to sell\n     computers, it's in business to sell computer time\" (and you can\n\
    \     replace the company name with just about any one you want) should\n    \
    \ suffice.  Especially when you realize that it was the traditional\n     answer\
    \ to the neophyte programmer's query as to how come there\n     were firms making\
    \ good livings selling Sort-Merge utilities for\n     System X when one came with\
    \ the operating system (X = 7094 and\n     the Operating system was IBSYS, to\
    \ date the author).  But that's\n     all somewhat \"cynical\", even if it's accurate.\
    \  Is there any\n     evidence in today's world?\n          Well, by their fruits\
    \ shall you know them:  1.  The feature\n     of the NBS Transport Protocol alluded\
    \ to earlier was an every\n     15-second \"probe\" of an open connection (\"\
    to be sure the other\n     guy's still\n     RFC 873                         \
    \                   September 1982\n     there\").  In the early days of the ARPANET,\
    \ one Host elected to\n     have its Host-Host protocol (popularly miscalled \"\
    NCP\" but more\n     accurately AH-HP, for ARPANET Host-Host Protocol) send an\
    \ echo\n     (\"ECO\") command to each other Host each minute.  The \"Network\n\
    \     Daemon\" on Multics (the process which fielded AH-HP commands)\n     found\
    \ its bill tripled as a result.  The ECMA-desired protocol\n     would generate\
    \ four nuisance commands each minute--from every\n     Host you're talking to!\
    \  (The \"M\", recall, is for\n     Manufacturers.)*  2.  X.25 is meant to be\
    \ a network interface.\n     Even with all the ambiguities of the ISORM, one would\
    \ think the\n     \"peer\" of a \"DTE\" (Host) X.25 module (or \"entity\") would\
    \ be a\n     \"DCE\" (comm subnet processor) X.25 module. But you can also \"\
    talk\n     to\" at least the foreign DCE's X.25 and (one believes) even the\n\
    \     foreign DTE's; indeed, it's hard to avoid it.  Why all these\n     apparently\
    \ extraneous transmissions?  CCITT is a body consisting\n     of the representatives\
    \ of \"the PTT's\"--European for State-owned\n     communications monopolies.\
    \ 3.  The ISORM legislates that\n     \"N-entities\" must communicate through\
    \ \"N-1 entities.\"  Doesn't\n     that make for the needless multiplication of\

    \ likely\n     cheap shot, TCP checksums are necessary to satisfy the design\n\

    \  \"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.\"\n     Achieving interoperability\

    \ that matter, what with all\n     this \"unbundling\"\n     ________________\n\
    \     *  Rumor has it that the probes have since been withdrawn from\n       \
    \ the spec.  Bravo.  However, that they were ever in the spec is\n        still\
    \ extremely disquieting--and how long it took to get them\n        out does not\
    \ engender confidence that the ISORMS will be\n        \"tight\" in the next few\
    \ years.\n     RFC 873                                            September 1982\n\
    \     stuff, who says even the incompatible ones come for free?  You\n     might\
    \ make up those costs by not having to pay your maintenance\n     programmers\
    \ to reinsert the ARMS into each new release of the\n     operating system from\
    \ the vendor, but not only don't good\n     operating systems change all that\
    \ often, but also you'll be\n     paying out microseconds and memory cells at\
    \ rates that can easily\n     add up to ordering the next member up in the family.\
    \  In short,\n     even if the lunch is free, the bread will be stale and the\
    \ cheese\n     will be moldy, more likely than not.  It's also the case that as\n\
    \     operating systems have come to evolve, the \"networking\" code has\n   \
    \  less and less need to be inserted into the hardcore supervisor or\n     equivalent.\
    \  That is, the necessary interprocess communication\n     and process creation\
    \ primitives tend to come with the system now,\n     and device drivers/managers\
    \ of the user's own devising can often\n     be added as options rather than having\
    \ to be built in, so the\n     odds are good that it won't be at all hard to keep\
    \ up with new\n     releases anyway. Furthermore, it turns out that more and more\n\
    \     vendors are supplying (or in process of becoming able to supply)\n     TCP/IP\
    \ anyway, so the whole issue of waiting for vendor support\n     might well soon\
    \ become moot.\n     References\n     [1]  Padlipsky, M. A., \"The Elements of\
