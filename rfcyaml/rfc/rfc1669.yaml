- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   In an open marketplace, adoption of new technology is driven\
    \ by\n   consumer demand.  New technologies that wish to succeed in the\n   marketplace\
    \ must provide new capabilities or reduced costs to gain\n   consumer confidence.\
    \  Internetworking technologies can be\n   particularly difficult to deploy and\
    \ must provide a correspondingly\n   high return on investment.  In order to determine\
    \ market viability of\n   new internetworking technology, it's necessary to compare\
    \ the\n   required deployment effort against the potential benefits as seen by\n\
    \   the customer.  \"Viability in the Marketplace\" is an important\n   requirement\
    \ for any IPng candidate and this paper is an attempt to\n   summarize some important\
    \ factors in determing market viability of\n   IPng proposals.\n"
- title: '"Pushing" Internetworking Technology'
  contents:
  - "\"Pushing\" Internetworking Technology\n   It has been asserted by some that\
    \ the adoption of a single IPng\n   protocol by the computing industry would generate\
    \ general acceptance\n   in the networking industry.  There is ample evidence\
    \ to support this\n   view; for example, some of the today's more prevalent networking\n\
    \   protocols gained initial market acceptance through bundling with\n   computer\
    \ operating systems (e.g. IP via UNIX, DECNET via VMS, etc.)\n   It should be\
    \ noted, however, that this approach to technology\n   deployment is by no means\
    \ assured, and some of today's most popular\n   internetworking software (Novell,\
    \ etc.) have thrived despite\n   alternatives bundled by computing manufacturers.\
    \   Given that IPng\n   will have to compete against an well established and mature\n\
    \   internetworking protocol (IP version 4), promotion of an IPng\n   solution\
    \ by computer system manufacturers should be recognized as\n   highly desirable\
    \ but not sufficient on its own to ensure IPng\n   acceptance in the marketplace.\n"
- title: Can IPng compete against IPv4?
  contents:
  - "Can IPng compete against IPv4?\n   Given the large installed base of IPv4 systems,\
    \ computer system\n   manufacturers will need to continue to provide IPv4 capabilities\
    \ for\n   the foreseeable future.  With both IPng and IPv4 support in their new\n\
    \   systems, users will be facing a difficult choice between using IPv4\n   and\
    \ IPng for internetworking.  Existing IPv4 users will migrate to\n   IPng for\
    \ one of three possible reasons:\n"

  - "New functionality not found in IPv4\n   IPng needs to provide functionality equivalent\
    \ to that currently\n   provided by IPv4.  It remains to be seen whether additional\n\
    \   functionality (such as resource reservation, mobility,\n   autoconfiguration,\
    \ autoregistration, or security) will be included in\n   the base specification\
    \ of any IPng candidate.  In order to provide\n   motivation to migrate to IPng,\
    \ it will be necessary for IPng\n   proposals to offer capabilities beyond those\
    \ already provided IPv4.\n"
- title: Reduced costs by using IPng
  contents:
  - "Reduced costs by using IPng\n   It is quite unlikely that migration to IPng will\
    \ result in cost\n   savings in any organization.  Migration to IPng will certainly\
    \ result\n   in an increased need for training and engineering, and hence\n  \
    \ increased costs.\n"
- title: To gain connectivity to otherwise unreachable IPng hosts
  contents:
  - "To gain connectivity to otherwise unreachable IPng hosts\n   For existing sites\
    \ with valid IPv4 network assignments, connectivity\n   is not affected until\
    \ address depletion occurs.  Systems with\n   globally-unique IPv4 addresses will\
    \ have complete connectivity to any\n   systems since backwards-compatible communication\
    \ is required of new\n   IPng hosts.\n   From the perspective of an existing IPv4\
    \ site, IPng provides little\n   tangible benefit until IPv4 address depletion\
    \ occurs and\n   organizations reachable only via IPng appear.  Given the absence\
    \ of\n   benefits from migration,  it is uncertain whether a significant base\n\
    \   of IPng sites will be occur prior to IPv4 address depletion.\n   Sites which\
    \ are not yet running IP have little motivation to deploy\n   IPng for the immediate\
    \ future.  As long as IPv4 network assignments\n   are available, new sites have\
    \ an choice to use IPv4 which provides\n   the sufficient internetworking capabilities\
    \ (measured in\n   functionality, cost, and connectivity) for many organizations\
    \ today.\n   Given the parity in IPng and IPv4 capabilities, IPv4 (as a more\n\
    \   mature internetworking protocol) is the more probable choice for\n   organizations\
    \ just now selecting an internetworking protocol.\n   Once IPv4 address assignments\
    \ are no longer available, sites wishing\n   to participate in the global Internet\
    \ will have a very difficult\n   decision in selection of an internetworking protocol.\
    \   The current\n   suite of IPng proposals cannot provide complete internetworking\n\
    \   between IPng-only sites and IPv4-only sites since (by definition)\n   there\
    \ will be insufficient space to map all IPng addresses into the\n   IPv4 address\
    \ space.  As none of the proposals currently call for\n   dynamic network address\
    \ translation (NAT), it is inevitable that\n   IPng-only sites will have access\
    \ to a partial set of IPv4 sites at\n   any given moment.\n   Internetworking\
    \ services which do not allow complete access to the\n   global Internet (IPv4\
    \ and IPng in the post-IPv4-address-depletion\n   world) are clearly not as valuable\
    \ as services which offer complete\n   Internet access.  Sites which are unable\
    \ to obtain IPv4 network\n   assignments will be seeking Internet services which\
    \ can provide\n   complete Internet service.   Additionally, some sites will have\n\
    \   \"privately numbered\" IPv4 networks and will desire similar Internet\n  \
    \ services which provide transparent access to the entire Internet. The\n   development\
    \ of network address translation devices and subsequent\n   services is highly\
    \ likely under these market conditions.\n"
- title: Summary
  contents:
  - "Summary\n   No internetworking vendor (whether host, router, or service vendor)\n\
    \   can afford to deploy and support products and services which are not\n   desired\
    \ in the marketplace.  Given the potential proliferation of\n   network address\
    \ translation devices, it is not clear that IPng will\n   secure sufficient following\
    \ to attain market viability.  In the past,\n   we have seen internetworking protocols\
    \ fail in the marketplace\n   despite vendor deployment and IPng cannot succeed\
    \ if it is not\n   deployed by organizations.  As currently envisioned, IPng may\
    \ not be\n   ambitious enough in the delivery of new capabilities to compete\n\
    \   against IPv4 and the inevitable arrival of network address\n   translation\
    \ devices.  In order to meet the requirement for \"viability\n   in the marketplace',\
    \ IPng needs to deliver clearly improved\n   functionality over IPv4 while offering\
    \ some form transparent access\n   between the IPv4 and IPng communities once\
    \ IPv4 address depletion has\n   occurred.\n"
