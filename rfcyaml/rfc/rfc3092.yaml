- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Approximately 212 RFCs, or about 7% of RFCs issued so far,\
    \ starting\n   with [RFC269], contain the terms `foo', `bar', or `foobar' used\
    \ as a\n   metasyntactic variable without any proper explanation or definition.\n\
    \   This may seem trivial, but a number of newcomers, especially if\n   English\
    \ is not their native language, have had problems in\n   understanding the origin\
    \ of those terms.  This document rectifies\n   that deficiency.\n   Section 2\
    \ below describes the definition and etymology of these words\n   and Section\
    \ 3 interprets them as acronyms.\n   As an Appendix, we include a table of RFC\
    \ occurrences of these words\n   as metasyntactic variables.\n"
- title: 2. Definition and Etymology
  contents:
  - "2. Definition and Etymology\n   bar /bar/ n. [JARGON]\n   1. The second metasyntactic\
    \ variable, after foo and before baz.\n      \"Suppose we have two functions:\
    \ FOO and BAR.  FOO calls BAR....\"\n   2. Often appended to foo to produce foobar.\n\
    \   foo /foo/\n   1. interj.  Term of disgust.\n   2. Used very generally as a\
    \ sample name for absolutely anything, esp.\n      programs and files (esp. scratch\
    \ files).\n   3. First on the standard list of metasyntactic variables used in\n\
    \      syntax examples (bar, baz, qux, quux, corge, grault, garply,\n      waldo,\
    \ fred, plugh, xyzzy, thud). [JARGON]\n      When used in connection with `bar'\
    \ it is generally traced to the\n      WW II era Army slang acronym FUBAR (`Fucked\
    \ Up Beyond All\n      Repair'), later modified to foobar.  Early versions of\
    \ the Jargon\n      File [JARGON] interpreted this change as a post-war\n    \
    \  bowdlerization, but it now seems more likely that FUBAR was itself\n      a\
    \ derivative of `foo' perhaps influenced by German `furchtbar'\n      (terrible)\
    \ - `foobar' may actually have been the original form.\n      For, it seems, the\
    \ word `foo' itself had an immediate prewar\n      history in comic strips and\
    \ cartoons.  In the 1938 Warner Brothers\n      cartoon directed by Robert Clampett,\
    \ \"The Daffy Doc\", a very early\n      version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign\
    \ saying \"SILENCE IS FOO!\"\n      `FOO' and `BAR' also occurred in Walt Kelly's\
    \ \"Pogo\" strips.  The\n      earliest documented uses were in the surrealist\
    \ \"Smokey Stover\"\n      comic strip by Bill Holman about a fireman.  This comic\
    \ strip\n      appeared in various American comics including \"Everybody's\"\n\
    \      between about 1930 and 1952.  It frequently included the word\n      \"\
    FOO\" on license plates of cars, in nonsense sayings in the\n      background\
    \ of some frames such as \"He who foos last foos best\" or\n      \"Many smoke\
    \ but foo men chew\", and had Smokey say \"Where there's\n      foo, there's fire\"\
    .  Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled\n      it with odd jokes and personal\
    \ contrivances, including other\n      nonsense phrases such as \"Notary Sojac\"\
    \ and \"1506 nix nix\".\n      According to the Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion\
    \ [WBCC] Holman\n      claimed to have found the word \"foo\" on the bottom of\
    \ a Chinese\n      figurine.  This is plausible; Chinese statuettes often have\n\
    \      apotropaic inscriptions, and this may have been the Chinese word\n    \
    \  `fu' (sometimes transliterated `foo'), which can mean \"happiness\"\n     \
    \ when spoken with the proper tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking\n      the\
    \ steps of many Chinese restaurants are properly called \"fu\n      dogs\") [PERS].\
    \  English speakers' reception of Holman's `foo'\n      nonsense word was undoubtedly\
    \ influenced by Yiddish `feh' and\n      English `fooey' and `fool'. [JARGON,\
    \ FOLDOC]\n      Holman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that\
    \ rode\n      on two wheels.  The comic strip was tremendously popular in the\n\
    \      late 1930s, and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even\n   \
    \   produced an operable version of Holman's Foomobile.  According to\n      the\
    \ Encyclopedia of American Comics [EAC], `Foo' fever swept the\n      U.S., finding\
    \ its way into popular songs and generating over 500\n      `Foo Clubs.' The fad\
    \ left `foo' references embedded in popular\n      culture (including the couple\
    \ of appearances in Warner Brothers\n      cartoons of 1938-39) but with their\
    \ origins rapidly forgotten.\n      [JARGON]\n      One place they are known to\
    \ have remained live is in the U.S.\n      military during the WWII years.  In\
    \ 1944-45, the term `foo\n      fighters' [FF] was in use by radar operators for\
    \ the kind of\n      mysterious or spurious trace that would later be called a\
    \ UFO (the\n      older term resurfaced in popular American usage in 1995 via\
    \ the\n      name of one of the better grunge-rock bands [BFF]).  Informants\n\
    \      connected the term to the Smokey Stover strip [PERS].\n      The U.S. and\
    \ British militaries frequently swapped slang terms\n      during the war.  Period\
    \ sources reported that `FOO' became a\n      semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army\
    \ graffiti more or less\n      equivalent to the American Kilroy [WORDS].  Where\
    \ British troops\n      went, the graffito \"FOO was here\" or something similar\
    \ showed up.\n      Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came from\n\
    \      Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous\n     \
    \ \"FUBAR\") was probably a backronym [JARGON].  Forty years later,\n      Paul\
    \ Dickson's excellent book \"Words\" [WORDS] traced \"Foo\" to an\n      unspecified\
    \ British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows:\n         \"Mr. Foo is a\
    \ mysterious Second World War product, gifted with\n         bitter omniscience\
    \ and sarcasm.\"\n      Earlier versions of the Jargon File suggested the possibility\
    \ that\n      hacker usage actually sprang from \"FOO, Lampoons and Parody\",\
    \ the\n      title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint\n \
    \     project of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in\n   \
    \   his mid-teens) later became one of the most important and\n      influential\
    \ artists in underground comics, this venture was hardly\n      a success; indeed,\
    \ the brothers later burned most of the existing\n      copies in disgust.  The\
    \ title FOO was featured in large letters on\n      the front cover.  However,\
    \ very few copies of this comic actually\n      circulated, and students of Crumb's\
    \ `oeuvre' have established that\n      this title was a reference to the earlier\
    \ Smokey Stover comics.\n      The Crumbs may also have been influenced by a short-lived\
    \ Canadian\n      parody magazine named `Foo' published in 1951-52. [JARGON]\n\
    \      An old-time member reports that in the 1959 \"Dictionary of the\n     \
    \ TMRC Language\", compiled at TMRC (the Tech Model Railroad Club at\n      MIT)\
    \ there was an entry for Foo.  The current on-line version, in\n      which \"\
    Foo\" is the only word coded to appear red, has the\n      following [TMRC]:\n\
    \         Foo:  The sacred syllable (FOO MANI PADME HUM); to be spoken\n     \
    \    only when under obligation to commune with the Deity. Our first\n       \
    \  obligation is to keep the Foo Counters turning.\n      This definition used\
    \ Bill Holman's nonsense word, then only two\n      decades old and demonstrably\
    \ still live in popular culture and\n      slang, to make a \"ha ha only serious\"\
    \ analogy with esoteric\n      Tibetan Buddhism.  Today's hackers would find it\
    \ difficult to\n      resist elaborating a joke like that, and it is not likely\
    \ 1959's\n      were any less susceptible. [JARGON]\n   4. [EF] Prince Foo was\
    \ the last ruler of Pheebor and owner of the\n      Phee Helm, about 400 years\
    \ before the reign of Entharion.  When\n      Foo was beheaded by someone he called\
    \ an \"eastern fop\" from\n      Borphee, the glorious age of Pheebor ended, and\
    \ Borphee rose to\n      the prominence it now enjoys.\n   5. [OED] A 13th-16th\
    \ century usage for the devil or any other enemy.\n      The earliest citation\
    \ it gives is from the year 1366, Chaucer A B\n      C (84): \"Lat not our alder\
    \ foo [devil] make his bobance [boast]\".\n      Chaucer's \"Foo\" is probably\
    \ related to modern English \"foe\".\n   6. Rare species of dog.\n      A spitz-type\
    \ dog discovered to exist after having long been\n      considered extinct, the\
    \ Chinese Foo Dog, or Sacred Dog of\n      Sinkiang, may have originated through\
    \ a crossing of Northern\n      European hunting dogs and the ancient Chow Chow\
    \ from Mongolia or\n      be the missing link between the Chinese Wolf and the\
    \ Chow Chow.\n      It probably derives its name from foochow, of the kind or\
    \ style\n      prevalent in Foochow, of or from the city of Foochow (now Minhow)\n\
    \      in southeast China. [DOG]\n   foobar n.\n      [JARGON] A widely used metasyntactic\
    \ variable; see foo for\n      etymology.  Probably originally propagated through\
    \ DECsystem\n      manuals by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1960s and\
    \ early\n      1970s; confirmed sightings there go back to 1972.  Hackers do not\n\
    \      generally use this to mean FUBAR in either the slang or jargon\n      sense.\
    \  It has been plausibly suggested that \"foobar\" spread among\n      early computer\
    \ engineers partly because of FUBAR and partly\n      because \"foo bar\" parses\
    \ in electronics techspeak as an inverted\n      foo signal.\n   foo-fighter n.\n\
    \      World War II term for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) noted by\n   \
    \   both German and British military.  See [FF] and entry above for\n      \"\
    foo\".\n"
