  - "Abstract\n   This memo gives a mission statement for the IETF, tries to define\
    \ the\n   terms used in the statement sufficiently to make the mission\n   statement\
    \ understandable and useful, argues why the IETF needs a\n   mission statement,\
    \ and tries to capture some of the debate that led\n   to this point.\n"
- title: 1. Mission Statement
  contents:
  - "1. Mission Statement\n   The goal of the IETF is to make the Internet work better.\n\
    \   The mission of the IETF is to produce high quality, relevant\n   technical\
    \ and engineering documents that influence the way people\n   design, use, and\
    \ manage the Internet in such a way as to make the\n   Internet work better. \
    \ These documents include protocol standards,\n   best current practices, and\
    \ informational documents of various kinds.\n   The IETF will pursue this mission\
    \ in adherence to the following\n   cardinal principles:\n   Open process - any\
    \ interested person can participate in the work,\n      know what is being decided,\
    \ and make his or her voice heard on the\n      issue.  Part of this principle\
    \ is our commitment to making our\n      documents, our WG mailing lists, our\
    \ attendance lists, and our\n      meeting minutes publicly available on the Internet.\n\
    \   Technical competence - the issues on which the IETF produces its\n      documents\
    \ are issues where the IETF has the competence needed to\n      speak to them,\
    \ and that the IETF is willing to listen to\n      technically competent input\
    \ from any source.  Technical competence\n      also means that we expect IETF\
    \ output to be designed to sound\n      network engineering principles - this\
    \ is also often referred to as\n      \"engineering quality\".\n   Volunteer Core\
    \ - our participants and our leadership are people who\n      come to the IETF\
    \ because they want to do work that furthers the\n      IETF's mission of \"making\
    \ the Internet work better\".\n   Rough consensus and running code - We make standards\
    \ based on the\n      combined engineering judgement of our participants and our\
    \ real-\n      world experience in implementing and deploying our specifications.\n\
    \   Protocol ownership - when the IETF takes ownership of a protocol or\n    \
    \  function, it accepts the responsibility for all aspects of the\n      protocol,\
    \ even though some aspects may rarely or never be seen on\n      the Internet.\
    \  Conversely, when the IETF is not responsible for a\n      protocol or function,\
    \ it does not attempt to exert control over\n      it, even though it may at times\
    \ touch or affect the Internet.\n"
- title: 2.  Definition of Terms
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition of Terms\n   Mission: What an organization sets out to do.  This\
    \ is in contrast to\n      its goal (which is what it hopes to achieve by fulfilling\
    \ its\n      mission), and to its activities (which is what specific actions it\n\
    \      takes to achieve its mission).\n   The Internet: A large, heterogeneous\
    \ collection of interconnected\n      systems that can be used for communication\
    \ of many different types\n      between any interested parties connected to it.\
    \  The term includes\n      both the \"core Internet\" (ISP networks) and \"edge\
    \ Internet\"\n      (corporate and private networks, often connected via firewalls,\n\
    \      NAT boxes, application layer gateways and similar devices).  The\n    \
    \  Internet is a truly global network, reaching into just about every\n      country\
    \ in the world.\n      The IETF community wants the Internet to succeed because\
    \ we\n      believe that the existence of the Internet, and its influence on\n\
    \      economics, communication, and education, will help us to build a\n    \
    \  better human society.\n   Standard: As used here, the term describes a specification\
    \ of a\n      protocol, system behaviour or procedure that has a unique\n    \
    \  identifier, and where the IETF has agreed that \"if you want to do\n      this\
    \ thing, this is the description of how to do it\".  It does not\n      imply\
    \ any attempt by the IETF to mandate its use, or any attempt\n      to police\
    \ its usage - only that \"if you say that you are doing\n      this according\
    \ to this standard, do it this way\".  The benefit of\n      a standard to the\
    \ Internet is in interoperability - that multiple\n      products implementing\
    \ a standard are able to work together in\n      order to deliver valuable functions\
    \ to the Internet's users.\n   Participants: Individuals who participate in the\
    \ process are the\n      fundamental unit of the IETF organization and the IETF's\
    \ work.\n      The IETF has found that the process works best when focused around\n\
    \      people, rather than around organizations, companies, governments\n    \
    \  or interest groups.  That is not to say that these other entities\n      are\
    \ uninteresting - but they are not what constitutes the IETF.\n   Quality: In\
    \ this context, the ability to express ideas with enough\n      clarity that they\
    \ can be understood in the same way by all people\n      building systems to conform\
    \ to them, and the ability (and\n      willingness) to describe the properties\
    \ of the system well enough\n      to understand important consequences of its\
    \ design, and to ensure\n      that those consequences are beneficial to the Internet\
    \ as a whole.\n      It also means that the specifications are designed with adherence\n\
    \      to sound network engineering principles, so that use for its\n      intended\
    \ purpose is likely to be effective and not harmful to the\n      Internet as\
    \ a whole.\n   Relevant: In this context, useful to some group of people who have\
    \ to\n      make decisions that affect the Internet, including, but not\n    \
    \  limited to, hardware and software implementors, network builders,\n      network\
    \ operators, and users of the Internet.  Note that it does\n      not mean \"\
    correct\" or \"positive\" - a report of an experiment that\n      failed, or a\
    \ specification that clearly says why you should not\n      use it in a given\
    \ situation, can be highly relevant - for deciding\n      what NOT to do.  A part\
    \ of being relevant is being timely - very\n      often, documents delivered a\
    \ year after core decisions have been\n      taken are far less useful than documents\
    \ that are available to the\n      decision-makers at decision time.\n"
- title: 3.  The Need for a Mission Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  The Need for a Mission Statement\n   The IETF has to make decisions.  And\
    \ in some cases, people acting on\n   behalf of the IETF have to make decisions\
    \ without consulting the\n   entire IETF first.\n   There are many reasons for\
    \ this, including the near-impossibility of\n   getting an informed consensus\
    \ opinion on a complex subject out of a\n   community of several thousand people\
    \ in a short time.\n   Having a defined mission is one of the steps we can take\
    \ in order to\n   evaluate alternatives: Does this help or hinder the mission,\
    \ or is it\n   orthogonal to it? If there are limited resources, are there things\n\
    \   that they could be invested in that help the mission better?\n   (Another\
    \ step is to choose leaders that we trust to exercise their\n   good judgement\
    \ and do the right thing.  But we're already trying to\n   do that.)\n"

- title: 4.1.  The Scope of the Internet
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The Scope of the Internet\n   A very difficult issue in discussing the\
    \ IETF's mission has been the\n   scope of the term \"for the Internet\".  The\
    \ Internet is used for many\n   things, many of which the IETF community has neither\
    \ interest nor\n   competence in making standards for.\n   The Internet isn't\
    \ value-neutral, and neither is the IETF.  We want\n   the Internet to be useful\
    \ for communities that share our commitment\n   to openness and fairness.  We\
    \ embrace technical concepts such as\n   decentralized control, edge-user empowerment\
    \ and sharing of\n   resources, because those concepts resonate with the core\
    \ values of\n   the IETF community.  These concepts have little to do with the\n\
    \   technology that's possible, and much to do with the technology that\n   we\
    \ choose to create.\n   At the same time, it is clear that many of the IETF-defined\n\
    \   technologies are useful not only for the Internet, but also for\n   networks\
    \ that have no direct relation to the Internet itself.\n   In attempting to resolve\
    \ the question of the IETF's scope, perhaps\n   the fairest balance is struck\
    \ by this formulation: \"protocols and\n   practices for which secure and scalable\
    \ implementations are expected\n   to have wide deployment and interoperation\
    \ on the Internet, or to\n   form part of the infrastructure of the Internet.\"\
    \n   In addition to this constraint, we are also constrained by the\n   principle\
    \ of competence: Where we do not have, and cannot gather, the\n   competence needed\
    \ to make technically sound standards, we should not\n   attempt to take the leadership.\n"
- title: 4.2.  The Balance Between Research, Invention and Adoption
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The Balance Between Research, Invention and Adoption\n   The IETF has traditionally\
    \ been a community for experimentation with\n   things that are not fully understood,\
    \ standardization of protocols\n   for which some understanding has been reached,\
    \ and publication of\n   (and refinement of) protocols originally specified outside\
    \ the IETF\n   process.\n   All of these activities have in common that they produce\
    \ documents -\n   but the documents should be judged by very different criteria\
    \ when\n   the time to publish comes around, and it's not uncommon to see people\n\
    \   confused about what documents are in which category.\n   In deciding whether\
    \ or not these activities should be done within the\n   IETF, one should not chiefly\
    \ look at the type of activity, but the\n   potential benefit to the Internet\
    \ - an experiment that yields\n   information about the fact that an approach\
    \ is not viable might be of\n   greater benefit to the Internet than publishing\
    \ a standard that is\n   technically competent, but only useful in a few special\
    \ cases.\n   For research of an essentially unbounded nature, with unknown\n \
    \  probability of success, it may be more relevant to charter a research\n   group\
    \ than a standards group.  For activities with a bounded scope -\n   such as specifying\
    \ several alternative protocols to the point where\n   experiments can identify\
    \ the better one for standardization - the\n   IETF's working group mechanism\
    \ may be an appropriate tool.\n"
- title: 4.3.  The Balance Between Mission and Procedures
  contents:
  - "4.3.  The Balance Between Mission and Procedures\n   The mission is intended\
    \ to state what the IETF is trying to achieve.\n   There are many methods that\
    \ can be chosen to achieve these outcomes -\n   for instance, the appeals procedure\
    \ is defined so that we can detect\n   cases where our fundamental principles\
    \ of technical competence and\n   open process has been violated; it is not itself\
    \ a fundamental value.\n   Similarly, the question of what body in the IETF declares\
    \ that a\n   document is ready for publication is entirely outside the mission\n\
    \   statement; we can imagine changing that without in any way impacting\n   what\
    \ the IETF mission is - even though it may significantly impact\n   the ability\
    \ to achieve that mission.\n"
- title: 4.4.  The Reach of the Internet
  contents:
  - "4.4.  The Reach of the Internet\n   The Internet is a global phenomenon.  The\
    \ people interested in its\n   evolution are from every culture under the sun\
    \ and from all walks of\n   life.  The IETF puts its emphasis on technical competence,\
    \ rough\n   consensus and individual participation, and needs to be open to\n\
    \   competent input from any source.  The IETF uses the English language\n   for\
    \ its work is because of its utility for working in a global\n   context.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Protocol Ownership
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Protocol Ownership\n   A problem akin to the problem of deciding on the\
    \ area of the IETF's\n   competence arises when a protocol that is clearly in\
    \ the IETF's scope\n   is used both on and off the Internet - the premier example\
    \ is of\n   course the Internet Protocol itself.\n   Sometimes the IETF defines\
    \ standards that ultimately see the most use\n   outside the global Internet.\
    \  The IETF, having defined the standard,\n   will continue to provide the necessary\
    \ administration of that\n   protocol.\n   Sometimes the IETF leverages standards\
    \ that are defined and\n   maintained by other organizations; we continue to work\
    \ with those\n   organizations on their standards and do not attempt to take them\n\
    \   over.\n"

  - "5. Security Considerations\n   Considering security is one of the core principles\
    \ of sound network\n   engineering for the Internet.  Apart from that, it's not\
    \ relevant to\n   this memo.\n"
