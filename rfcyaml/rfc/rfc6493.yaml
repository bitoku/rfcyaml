  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the operational use of the RPKI, it can become necessary
    to\n   contact, human to human, the party responsible for a resource-holding\n
    \  CA certificate, AKA the certificate's maintainer, be it the holder of\n   the
    certificate's private key or an administrative person in the\n   organization,
    a NOC, etc.  An important example is when the operator\n   of a prefix described
    by a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) sees a\n   problem, or an impending problem,
    with a certificate or Certificate\n   Revocation List (CRL) in the path between
    the ROA and a trust anchor.\n   For example, a certificate along that path has
    expired, is soon to\n   expire, or a CRL associated with a CA along the path is
    stale, thus\n   placing the quality of the routing of the address space described
    by\n   the ROA in jeopardy.\n   As the names in RPKI certificates are not meaningful
    to humans, see\n   [RFC6484], there is no way to use a certificate itself to lead
    to the\n   worrisome certificate's or CRL's maintainer.  So, \"Who you gonna\n
    \  call?\"\n   This document specifies the RPKI Ghostbusters Record, an object\n
    \  verified via an end-entity (EE) certificate, issued under a CA\n   certificate,
    the maintainer of which may be contacted using the\n   payload information in
    the Ghostbusters Record.\n   The Ghostbusters Record conforms to the syntax defined
    in [RFC6488].\n   The payload of this signed object is a severely profiled vCard.\n
    \  Note that the Ghostbusters Record is not an identity certificate, but\n   rather
    an attestation to the contact data made by the maintainer of\n   the CA certificate
    issuing the EE certificate whose corresponding\n   private key signs the Ghostbusters
    Record.\n   This record is not meant to supplant or be used as resource registry\n
    \  whois data.  It gives information about an RPKI CA certificate\n   maintainer,
    not a resource holder.\n   The Ghostbusters Record is optional; CA certificates
    in the RPKI can\n   have zero or more associated Ghostbuster Records.\n   Given
    a certificate, to find the closest Ghostbuster Record, go up\n   until a CA certificate
    is reached, which may be the object itself of\n   course.  That CA certificate
    will have Subject Information Access\n   (SIA) to the publication point where
    all subsidiary objects (until\n   you hit a down-chain CA certificate's signed
    objects) are published.\n   The publication point will contain zero or more Ghostbuster
    Records.\n   This specification has three main sections.  The first, Section 5,
    is\n   the format of the contact payload information, a severely profiled\n   vCard.
    \ The second, Section 6, profiles the packaging of the payload\n   as a profile
    of the RPKI Signed Object Template specification\n   [RFC6488].  The third, Section
    7, describes the proper validation of\n   the signed Ghostbusters Record.\n"

  - "5.  vCard Profile\n   The goal in profiling the vCard is not to include as much
    information\n   as possible, but rather to include as few properties as possible\n
    \  while providing the minimal necessary data to enable one to contact\n   the
    maintainer of the RPKI data that threatens the ROA[s] of concern.\n   The Ghostbusters
    vCard payload is a minimalist subset of the vCard as\n   described in [RFC6350].\n
    \  BEGIN -  pro forma packaging that MUST be the first line in the vCard\n      and
    MUST have the value \"BEGIN:VCARD\" as described in [RFC6350].\n   VERSION -  pro
    forma packaging that MUST be the second line in the\n      vCard and MUST have
    the value \"VERSION:4.0\" as described in\n      Section 3.7.9 of [RFC6350].\n
    \  FN -  the name, as described in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC6350], of a\n      contactable
    person or role who is responsible for the CA\n      certificate.\n   ORG -  an
    organization as described in Section 6.6.4 of [RFC6350].\n   ADR -  a postal address
    as described in Section 6.3 of [RFC6350].\n   TEL -  a voice and/or fax phone
    as described in Section 6.4.1 of\n      [RFC6350].\n   EMAIL -  an Email address
    as described in Section 6.4.2 of [RFC6350]\n   END -  pro forma packaging that
    MUST be the last line in the vCard\n      and MUST have the value \"END:VCARD\"
    as described in [RFC6350].\n   Per [RFC6350], the BEGIN, VERSION, FN, and END
    properties MUST be\n   included in a record.  To be useful, at least one of ADR,
    TEL, and\n   EMAIL MUST be included.  Other properties MUST NOT be included.\n"

  - "6.  CMS Packaging\n   The Ghostbusters Record is a CMS signed-data object conforming
    to the\n   \"Signed Object Template for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure\n
    \  (RPKI)\", [RFC6488].\n   The content-type of a Ghostbusters Record is defined
    as id-ct-\n   rpkiGhostbusters, and has the numerical value of\n   1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.35.
    \ This OID MUST appear both within the\n   eContentType in the encapContentInfo
    object as well as the content-\n   type signed attribute in the signerInfo object.
    \ See [RFC6488].\n   eContent: The content of a Ghostbusters Record is described
    in\n   Section 5.\n   Similarly to a ROA, a Ghostbusters Record is verified using
    an EE\n   certificate issued by the resource-holding CA certificate whose\n   maintainer
    is described in the vCard.\n   The EE certificate used to verify the Ghostbusters
    Record is the one\n   that appears in the CMS data structure that contains the
    payload\n   defined above.\n   This EE certificate MUST describe its Internet
    Number Resources using\n   the \"inherit\" attribute, rather than explicit description
    of a\n   resource set; see [RFC3779].\n"

  - "7.  Validation\n   The validation procedure defined in Section 3 of [RFC6488]
    is applied\n   to a Ghostbusters Record.  After this procedure has been performed,\n
    \  the Version number type within the payload is checked, and the OCTET\n   STRING
    containing the vCard data is extracted.  These data are\n   checked against the
    profile defined in Section 5 of this document.\n   Only if all of these checks
    pass is the Ghostbusters payload deemed\n   valid and made available to the application
    that requested the\n   payload.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Though there is no on-the-wire protocol in this
    specification, there\n   are attacks that could abuse the data described.  As
    the data, to be\n   useful, need to be public, little can be done to avoid this
    exposure.\n   Phone Numbers:  The vCards may contain real world telephone numbers,\n
    \     which could be abused for telemarketing, abusive calls, etc.\n   Email Addresses:
    \ The vCards may contain Email addresses, which could\n      be abused for purposes
    of spam.\n   Relying parties are hereby warned that the data in a Ghostbusters\n
    \  Record are self-asserted.  These data have not been verified by the\n   CA
    that issued the CA certificate to the entity that issued the EE\n   certificate
    used to validate the Ghostbusters Record.\n"
