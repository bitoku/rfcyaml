This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for information related to the Fibre Channel network's Name Server function, which provides a means for Fibre Channel ports to register and discover Fibre Channel attributes.
Such attributes include names, addresses, types, features, etc., at various protocol layers.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Short Overview of Fibre Channel
The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point to point serial data channel, structured for high performance.
Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
command sets, the High  Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.
Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple communication points, called N Ports, interconnected either by a switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point to point link.
A Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N Ports.
A Fabric may consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are switches.
An N Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch called an F Port.
When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port is called an FL Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL Ports.
Nx Port is used to refer to either an N Port or an NL Port.
Fx Port is used to refer to either an F Port or an FL Port.
A switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an Inter Switch Link (ISL), is called an E Port.
A B Port connects a bridge device with an E Port on a switch; a B Port provides a subset of E Port functionality.
Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and most ports, have globally unique names.
These globally unique names are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).
More information on WWNs can be found in [FC FS].
WWNs are expected to be persistent across agent and unit resets.
Fibre Channel frames contain 24 bit address identifiers, which identify the frame's source and destination ports.
Each FC port has both an address identifier and a WWN.
When a fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
Each octet of a 24 bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy, with a Domain ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.
The Fibre Channel Name Server provides a way for N Ports and NL Ports to register and discover Fibre Channel attributes.
Such attributes include names, addresses, types, features, etc., at various protocol layers, including upper layer protocols specific to Fibre Channel (which are sometimes called "FC 4s").
Communication with the Name Server is via Fibre Channel's CT (Common Transport for Generic Services) using "Information Units" (called CT IUs) as either requests, responses, or unsolicited.
Registrations may be performed by a third party.
However, the Name Server may refuse such third party registration for unspecified reasons.
Once registered, the attributes are made available to requestors.
Requestors could learn about new registrations via periodic polling of the Name Server, but such polling would generate a considerable overhead.
To avoid this overhead, the Registered State Change Notification (RSCN) mechanism defined in FC FS
[FC FS] allows an Nx Port to register to receive an RSCN whenever an event occurs that may affect the state of other Nx Port(s), including changes in the information registered with the Name Server.
The Fibre Channel Name Server is defined in the FC GS specification, The latest specification is [FC GS 4]; the previous version was [FC GS 3].
The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focused on Fibre Channel switches.
It was obsoleted by the more generic Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC MGMT], which defines basic information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to the standard IF MIB [IF MIB] for Fibre Channel interfaces.
This MIB extends beyond [FC MGMT] to cover the functionality, in Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's Name Server function.
This MIB also imports some common textual conventions from T11 TC MIB, defined in [FC FAM MIB].
This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of, and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of Fibre Channel Name Server functionality.
(Note that there are no definitions in this MIB module of "managed actions" that can be invoked via SNMP.)
Fibre Channel Management Instance A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC MGMT] as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.
Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for the implementation(s).
For example, one such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX
[RFC2741] sub agents, with each sub agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.
The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB [FC MGMT]
as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel management instance within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411], section 3.3.1).
In addition to allowing for multiple Fibre Channel management instances, this MIB is based on the notion that the information registered with the Name Server is available as one or more subsets.
The MIB allows the different subsets to be accessed either: via different SNMP agents/contexts, via different Fibre Channel management instances within the same SNMP agent/context,
and/or via the same Fibre Channel management instance within the same SNMP agent/context.
The union of these subsets (across all agents/contexts in the network) represents the total set of information registered with the Name Server.
Note that the intersection of the subsets is often non empty, and the use of the term "subset" does not preclude any subset from containing the complete set of Name Server information.
Each of these subsets is identified using an index value called a Name Server Information Subset Index.
Thus, all objects in this MIB are in tables that are INDEXed by
at least fcmInstanceIndex and t11NsInfoSubsetIndex, where the latter contains a Name Server Information Subset Index value.
The [FC SW 3] standard for an interconnecting Fabric consisting of multiple Fabric Switch elements describes the operation of a single Fabric in a physical infrastructure.
The current [FC SW 4] standard also supports the operation of multiple Virtual Fabrics operating within one (or more) physical infrastructures.
In such a scenario, each Fabric has, of course, its own management instrumentation.
In order to accommodate this scenario, this MIB module defines all Fabric related information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index".
In a Fabric that is conformant to [FC SW 3], the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.
This section describes the six MIB groups contained in the MIB.
This group contains information about the operation of the Name Server function acting upon a Name Server Information Subset, including an indication of whether such operation is performed local to a particular Fibre Channel switch, or independently of a Fibre Channel switch.
It also contains the information currently registered in a particular Name Server Information Subset.
RSCNs t11NsRejectStatsGroup    stats about rejects
Each of these groups is conditionally mandatory; specifically, each group contains objects for particular statistics such that implementation of the group is mandatory only for an implementation that counts/captures the group's particular statistics.
The intent here is not to force implementations to capture these statistics, but rather to have all implementations that do capture them, provide access to them via the same MIB objects.
This group contains a set of notifications that provide for monitoring the rejections of Name Server Registration Requests.
This group contains objects for controlling the generation of, and for information to be included in, the notifications defined in the t11NsNotifyGroup group.
The Actual Values of Objects
The objects defined in the t11NsRegTable represent the values registered with the Name Server.
The SNMP agent MUST report the actual values, even if they are incorrectly formatted.
This is the reason why, for example, the two objects that represent IP addresses, t11NsNodeIpAddress and t11NsPortIpAddress, have the SYNTAX of OCTET STRING, so that they are able to represent invalid values (which could not be represented using InetAddressType and InetAddress).
Similarly, each set of (t11NsRejectReasonCode, t11NsRejReasonCodeExp, t11NsRejReasonVendorCode) objects must hold the values of the actual reject, explanation, and vendor specific codes that were present in the generated Reject message (the "Reject CT IU"), irrespective of whether or not such code values were appropriate.

IANA Considerations IANA has assigned a MIB OID to the T11 FC NAME SERVER MIB module under the appropriate subtree.
There is one management object defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
This object and its sensitivity/vulnerability is: t11NsInfoSubsetRejReqNotfyEnable
the ability to enable/disable notifications.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
For example, the ability to change network topology or network speed may afford an attacker the ability to obtain better performance at the expense of other network users.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
t11NsRegTable   contains information about registered Nx Ports.
t11NsStatsTable   contains statistics and state information about the Name Server.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
