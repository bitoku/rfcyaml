    \ Provider Edge (PE) nodes when a\n   failure occurs in one of the Attachment\
    \ Circuits (AC) or PWs.  This\n   PW dual-homing local protection mechanism is\
    \ complementary to\n   existing PW protection mechanisms.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6372] and [RFC6378] describe the framework and mechanism\
    \ of MPLS\n   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection, which can provide\n\
    \   protection for the MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or pseudowire (PW)\n   between\
    \ the edge nodes.  This mechanism does not protect against\n   failure of the\
    \ Attachment Circuit (AC) or the Provider Edge (PE)\n   node.  [RFC6718] and [RFC6870]\
    \ describe the framework and mechanism\n   for PW redundancy to provide protection\
    \ against AC or PE node\n   failure.  The PW redundancy mechanism is based on\
    \ the signaling of\n   the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), which is applicable\
    \ to PWs\n   with a dynamic control plane.  [RFC8104] describes a fast local\n\
    \   repair mechanism for PW egress endpoint failures, which is based on\n   PW\
    \ redundancy, upstream label assignment, and context-specific label\n   switching.\
    \  The mechanism defined in [RFC8104] is only applicable to\n   PWs with a dynamic\
    \ control plane.\n   There is a need to support a dual-homing local protection\
    \ mechanism\n   that avoids unnecessary switches of the AC or PW and can be used\n\
    \   regardless of whether a control plane is used.  In some scenarios,\n   such\
    \ as mobile backhauling, the MPLS PWs are provisioned with dual-\n   homing topology\
    \ in which at least the Customer Edge (CE) node on one\n   side is dual-homed\
    \ to two PEs.  If some fault occurs in the primary\n   AC, operators usually prefer\
    \ to have the switchover only on the dual-\n   homing PE side and keep the working\
    \ pseudowires unchanged if\n   possible.  This is to avoid massive PW switchover\
    \ in the mobile\n   backhaul network due to AC failure in the mobile core site;\
    \ such\n   massive PW switchover may in turn lead to congestion caused by\n  \
    \ migrating traffic away from the preferred paths of network planners.\n   Similarly,\
    \ as multiple PWs share the physical AC in the mobile core\n   site, it is preferable\
    \ to keep using the working AC when one working\n   PW fails in the Packet Switched\
    \ Network (PSN) to potentially avoid\n   unnecessary switchover for other PWs.\
    \  To meet the above\n   requirements, a fast dual-homing local PW protection\
    \ mechanism is\n   needed to protect against the failures of an AC, the PE node,\
    \ and the\n   PSN.\n   This document describes the framework and several typical\
    \ scenarios\n   of PW dual-homing local protection.  A Dual-Node Interconnection\n\
    \   (DNI) PW is used between the dual-homing PE nodes to carry traffic\n   when\
    \ a failure occurs in the AC or PW side.  In order for the dual-\n   homing PE\
    \ nodes to determine the forwarding state of AC, PW, and\n   DNI-PW, necessary\
    \ state exchange and coordination between the\n   dual-homing PEs is needed. \
    \ The necessary mechanisms and protocol\n   extensions are defined in [RFC8185].\n"

    \  In\n   addition to the AC and the service PW between the local and remote\n\
    \   PEs, a DNI-PW is used to connect the forwarders of the dual-homing\n   PEs.\
    \  It can be used to forward traffic between the dual-homing PEs\n   when a failure\

    \ scenario of dual-homing PW local\n   protection where only one of the CEs is\
    \ dual-homed to two PE nodes.\n   CE1 is dual-homed to PE1 and PE2, while CE2\
    \ is single-homed to PE3.\n   A DNI-PW is established between the dual-homing\
    \ PEs, which is used to\n   bridge traffic when a failure occurs in the PSN or\

    \ connect the DNI-PW to PW2.  In this way,\n   the failure in the PSN will not\
    \ impact the state of the ACs.  After\n   the switchover, traffic will go through\
    \ the bidirectional path:\n   CE1-(AC1)-PE1-(DNI-PW)-PE2-(PW2)-PE3-(AC3)-CE2.\n\
    \   When a failure occurs in the working PE (PE1), it is equivalent to a\n   failure\
    \ of the working AC, the working PW, and the DNI-PW.  The state\n   of AC2 changes\
    \ to active based on the AC dual-homing control\n   mechanism.  In addition, according\
    \ to the PW protection mechanism,\n   traffic is switched on to the protection\
    \ PW \"PW2\".  In this case, the\n   forwarder on PE2 needs to connect AC2 to\

    \  When a failure occurs in the working PE (PE1), it is equivalent to\n   the\
    \ failures of the working AC, the working PW, and the DNI-PW.  The\n   state of\
    \ AC2 changes to active based on the AC dual-homing control\n   mechanism.  In\
    \ addition, according to the PW protection mechanism,\n   traffic is switched\
    \ on to the protection PW \"PW2\".  In this case, the\n   forwarder on PE2 needs\
    \ to connect AC2 to PW2, and the forwarder on\n   PE4 needs to connect PW2 to\
    \ DNI-PW2.  After the switchover, traffic\n   will go through the bidirectional\
    \ path:\n   CE1-(AC2)-PE2-(PW2)-PE4-(DNI-PW2)-PE3-(AC3)-CE2.\n"

  - "3.  Generic Dual-Homing PW Protection Mechanism\n   As shown in the above scenarios,\
    \ with the described dual-homing PW\n   protection, failures in the AC side will\
    \ not impact the forwarding\n   behavior of the PWs in the PSN, and vice-versa.\n\
    \   In order for the dual-homing PEs to coordinate traffic forwarding\n   during\
    \ failures, synchronization of the status information of the\n   involved entities\
    \ and coordination of switchover between the dual-\n   homing PEs are needed.\
    \  For PWs with a dynamic control plane, such\n   synchronization and coordination\
    \ information can be achieved with a\n   dynamic protocol, such as that described\
    \ in [RFC7275], possibly with\n   some extensions.  For PWs that are manually\
    \ configured without a\n   control plane, a new mechanism is needed to exchange\
    \ the status\n   information and coordinate switchover between the dual-homing\
    \ PEs,\n   e.g., over an embedded PW control channel.  This is described in\n\
    \   [RFC8185].\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The scenarios defined in this document do not\
    \ affect the security\n   model as defined in [RFC3985].\n   With the proposed\
    \ protection mechanism, the disruption of a dual-\n   homed AC, a component that\
    \ is outside the core network, would have a\n   reduced impact on the traffic\
    \ flows in the core network.  This could\n   also avoid unnecessary congestion\
    \ in the core network.\n   The security consideration of the DNI-PW is the same\
    \ as for service\n   PWs in the data plane [RFC3985].  Security considerations\
    \ for the\n   coordination/control mechanism will be addressed in the companion\n\
    \   document, RFC 8185, which defines the mechanism.\n"
