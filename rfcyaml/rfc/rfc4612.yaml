- title: 3.  Mechanisms for Transporting T.38 over an IP Network
  contents:
  - "3.  Mechanisms for Transporting T.38 over an IP Network\n   When T.38 was first\
    \ approved in 1998, it allowed for the transport of\n   T.38 via UDP (using UDP\
    \ Transport Layer (UDPTL), rather than RTP) or\n   TCP.  As of the time of this\
    \ publication, UDPTL is the predominant\n   means for transporting T.38 data over\
    \ an IP network.  In support of\n   that, RFC 3362 [11] was published in order\
    \ to allow devices to signal\n   their desire to use UDPTL to transport T.38.\n\
    \   A number of issues were raised with respect to the usage of UDPTL for\n  \
    \ the long-term, though.  Specifically, there were concerns over the\n   fact\
    \ that UDPTL does not provide the same kind of statistics\n   reporting as RTP\
    \ Control Protocol (RTCP).  Further, there are no\n   procedures in place for\
    \ encrypting and protecting the integrity of\n   the UDPTL stream.  While the\
    \ latter could be addressed in UDPTL,\n   doing so would require a lot of effort\
    \ and would largely be a\n   duplication of the security work already completed\
    \ within the IETF;\n   e.g., Secure RTP (SRTP) [10].\n   There are clear advantages\
    \ in using RTP for T.38 today.  For example,\n   using RTP allows one to take\
    \ advantage of the redundancy [12], header\n   compression [13][14], and other\
    \ RTP-related work within the IETF.\n   Using RTP, as opposed to UDPTL, for transport\
    \ provides better\n   interoperability with a wider range of devices that know\
    \ and\n   understand RTP.  This includes applications such as firewalls,\n   Network\
    \ Address Translation (NAT) devices, and gateways that bridge\n   two IP networks,\
    \ which generally support RTP before most other real-\n   time media.\n   Lastly,\
    \ since today most T.38 data is generated by gateways that\n   bridge two Public\
    \ Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) networks, it is\n   quite natural to expect\
    \ that the transition from audio to fax should\n   happen within the same media\
    \ stream.  The reason is that the T.38\n   data is simply an alternative representation\
    \ of information received\n   on the PSTN circuit.  If the T.38 data is encapsulated\
    \ in RTP, the\n   gateways can easily transition from audio to fax and back again\
    \ and\n   can simply use the payload type to indicate the type of media that it\n\
    \   is currently transmitting.\n   With these considerations in mind, the ITU-T\
    \ amended T.38 [1] to\n   allow RTP to be used to transport T.38.  With that,\
    \ a new MIME\n   registration (audio/t38) is needed to allow for T.38 to be switched\n\
    \   along with audio within the same RTP session.\n"

- title: 5.  SDP Mapping of MIME Parameters
  contents:
  - "5.  SDP Mapping of MIME Parameters\n   The MIME information described in Section\
    \ 4 is utilized in SDP in\n   order to establish T.38 media streams.  Specifically:\n\
    \   o  The MIME type (\"audio\") goes in SDP \"m=\" as the media name.\n   o \
    \ The MIME subtype (\"t38\") goes in SDP \"a=rtpmap\" as the encoding\n      name.\n\
    \   o  The parameter \"rate\" also goes in \"a=rtpmap\" as clock rate.\n   The\
    \ MIME type defines several required and optional parameters to\n   qualify the\
    \ operation of T.38; these are to be used as defined in RFC\n   3555 [5], Section\
    \ 2.  The parameters are provided as a semi-colon\n   separated list of \"parameter\"\
    \ or \"parameter=value\" pairs using the\n   \"a=fmtp\" parameter defined in SDP\
    \ [2]; the \"parameter\" form is used\n   for boolean values, where presence equals\
    \ \"true\" and absence \"false\".\n   Consider the following example, which describes\
    \ a media stream that\n   allows the transport of G.711 audio and T.38 fax information:\n\
    \   m=audio 6800 RTP/AVP 0 98 a=rtpmap:98 t38/8000 a=fmtp:98\n   T38FaxVersion=2;T38FaxRateManagement=transferredTCF\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   T.38 is vulnerable to attacks that are common\
    \ to other types of RTP\n   and SRTP payloads.  However, unlike audio, T.38 data\
    \ may be\n   manipulated in ways that are more obtrusive than audio.  For example,\n\
    \   rogue packets may cause transmission failure, and manipulated packets\n  \
    \ may alter terminal identity.\n   The security considerations discussed in the\
    \ RTP specification and\n   any applicable RTP profile (for example, [10]) are\
    \ applicable to\n   T.38.  Regarding SRTP configuration, fax payloads SHOULD NOT\
    \ use an\n   HMAC-SHA1 authentication tag that is shorter than 80 bits.\n"
