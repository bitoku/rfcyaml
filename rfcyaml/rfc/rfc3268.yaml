- title: Overview
  contents:
  - "Overview\n   At present, the symmetric ciphers supported by TLS are RC2, RC4,\n\
    \   IDEA, DES, and triple DES.  The protocol would be enhanced by the\n   addition\
    \ of AES [AES] ciphersuites, for the following reasons:\n   1. RC2, RC4, and IDEA\
    \ are all subject to intellectual property\n      claims.  RSA Security Inc. has\
    \ trademark rights in the names RC2\n      and RC4, and claims that the RC4 algorithm\
    \ itself is a trade\n      secret.  Ascom Systec Ltd. owns a patent on the IDEA\
    \ algorithm.\n   2. Triple DES is much less efficient than more modern ciphers.\n\
    \   3. Now that the AES process is completed there will be commercial\n      pressure\
    \ to use the selected cipher.  The AES is efficient and has\n      withstood extensive\
    \ cryptanalytic efforts.  The AES is therefore a\n      desirable choice.\n  \
    \ 4. Currently the DHE ciphersuites only allow triple DES (along with\n      some\
    \ \"export\" variants which do not use a satisfactory key\n      length).  At\
    \ the same time the DHE ciphersuites are the only ones\n      to offer forward\
    \ secrecy.\n   This document proposes several new ciphersuites, with the aim of\n\
    \   overcoming these problems.\n"
- title: Cipher Usage
  contents:
  - "Cipher Usage\n   The new ciphersuites proposed here are very similar to the following,\n\
    \   defined in [TLS]:\n   TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\n   TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\n\
    \   TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\n   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\n \
    \  TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\n   TLS_DH_anon_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\n \
    \  All the ciphersuites described here use the AES in cipher block\n   chaining\
    \ (CBC) mode.  Furthermore, they use SHA-1 [SHA-1] in an HMAC\n   construction\
    \ as described in section 5 of [TLS].  (Although the TLS\n   ciphersuite names\
    \ include the text \"SHA\", this actually refers to the\n   modified SHA-1 version\
    \ of the algorithm.)\n   The ciphersuites differ in the type of certificate and\
    \ key exchange\n   method.  The ciphersuites defined here use the following options\
    \ for\n   this part of the protocol:\n   CipherSuite                        Certificate\
    \ type (if applicable)\n                                      and key exchange\
    \ algorithm\n   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA       RSA\n   TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\
    \    DH_DSS\n   TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA    DH_RSA\n   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\
    \   DHE_DSS\n   TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA   DHE_RSA\n   TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\
    \   DH_anon\n   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA       RSA\n   TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\
    \    DH_DSS\n   TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA    DH_RSA\n   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\
    \   DHE_DSS\n   TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA   DHE_RSA\n   TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\
    \   DH_anon\n   For the meanings of the terms RSA, DH_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA\n\
    \   and DH_anon, please refer to sections 7.4.2 and 7.4.3 of [TLS].\n   The AES\
    \ supports key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits.  However, this\n   document only\
    \ defines ciphersuites for 128- and 256-bit keys.  This\n   is to avoid unnecessary\
    \ proliferation of ciphersuites.  Rijndael\n   actually allows for 192- and 256-bit\
    \ block sizes as well as the 128-\n   bit blocks mandated by the AES process.\
    \  The ciphersuites defined\n   here all use 128-bit blocks.\n   The new ciphersuites\
    \ will have the following definitions:\n   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\
    \      = { 0x00, 0x2F };\n   CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA   = {\
    \ 0x00, 0x30 };\n   CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00, 0x31\
    \ };\n   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x32 };\n   CipherSuite\
    \ TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x33 };\n   CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\
    \  = { 0x00, 0x34 };\n   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,\
    \ 0x35 };\n   CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00, 0x36 };\n\
    \   CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00, 0x37 };\n   CipherSuite\
    \ TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00, 0x38 };\n   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\
    \  = { 0x00, 0x39 };\n   CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,\
    \ 0x3A };\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   It is not believed that the new ciphersuites are\
    \ ever less secure\n   than the corresponding older ones.  The AES is believed\
    \ to be secure,\n   and it has withstood extensive cryptanalytic attack.\n   The\
    \ ephemeral Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites provide forward secrecy\n   without any\
    \ known reduction in security in other areas.  To obtain\n   the maximum benefit\
    \ from these ciphersuites:\n   1. The ephemeral keys should only be used once.\
    \  With the TLS\n      protocol as currently defined there is no significant efficiency\n\
    \      gain from reusing ephemeral keys.\n   2. Ephemeral keys should be destroyed\
    \ securely when they are no\n      longer required.\n   3. The random number generator\
    \ used to create ephemeral keys must not\n      reveal past output even when its\
    \ internal state is compromised.\n   [TLS] describes the anonymous Diffie-Hellman\
    \ (ADH) ciphersuites as\n   deprecated.  The ADH ciphersuites defined here are\
    \ not deprecated.\n   However, when they are used, particular care must be taken:\n\
    \   1. ADH provides confidentiality but not authentication.  This means\n    \
    \  that (if authentication is required) the communicating parties\n      must\
    \ authenticate to each other by some means other than TLS.\n   2. ADH is vulnerable\
    \ to man-in-the-middle attacks, as a consequence\n      of the lack of authentication.\
    \  The parties must have a way of\n      determining whether they are participating\
    \ in the same TLS\n      connection.  If they are not, they can deduce that they\
    \ are under\n      attack, and presumably abort the connection.\n      For example,\
    \ if the parties share a secret, it is possible to\n      compute a MAC of the\
    \ TLS Finished message.  An attacker would have\n      to negotiate two different\
    \ TLS connections; one with each\n      communicating party.  The Finished messages\
    \ would be different in\n      each case, because they depend on the parties'\
    \ public keys (among\n      other things).  For this reason, the MACs computed\
    \ by each party\n      would be different.\n      It is important to note that\
    \ authentication techniques which do\n      not use the Finished message do not\
    \ usually provide protection\n      from this attack.  For example, the client\
    \ could authenticate to\n      the server with a password, but it would still\
    \ be vulnerable to\n      man-in-the-middle attacks.\n      Recent research has\
    \ identified a chosen plaintext attack which\n      applies to all ciphersuites\
    \ defined in [TLS] which use CBC mode.\n      This weakness does not affect the\
    \ common use of TLS on the World\n      Wide Web, but may affect the use of TLS\
    \ in other applications.\n      When TLS is used in an application where this\
    \ attack is possible,\n      attackers can determine the truth or otherwise of\
    \ a hypothesis\n      that particular plaintext data was sent earlier in the session.\n\
    \      No key material is compromised.\n      It is likely that the CBC construction\
    \ will be changed in a future\n      revision of the TLS protocol.\n"
