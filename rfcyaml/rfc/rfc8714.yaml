- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo updates the process for selection of Trustees\
    \ for the IETF\n   Trust.  Previously, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee\n\
    \   (IAOC) members also acted as Trustees, but the IAOC has been\n   eliminated\
    \ as part of an update to the structure of the IETF\n   Administrative Support\
    \ Activity (IASA).  This memo specifies that the\n   Trustees shall be selected\
    \ separately.  See Section 3.\n   This memo obsoletes [RFC4371].  The changes\
    \ relate only to the\n   selection of Trustees.  All other aspects of the IETF\
    \ Trust remain as\n   they are today.  Section 2 copies the definition as it was\
    \ in\n   [RFC4371], only leaving out the part about Trustee selection and\n  \
    \ adding a reference to the IETF Trust website.\n   For a discussion of why this\
    \ change is needed and a rationale for\n   these specific changes, see [RFC8715].\n"
- title: 2.  IETF Trust
  contents:
  - "2.  IETF Trust\n   A Trust (\"the IETF Trust\") has been formed for the purpose\
    \ of\n   acquiring, holding, maintaining, and licensing certain existing and\n\
    \   future intellectual property and other property used in connection\n   with\
    \ the administration of the IETF.  The Trust was formed by the\n   signatures\
    \ of its Settlors and initial Trustees.  The Settlors, who\n   contributed initial\
    \ intellectual property to the Trust, were ISOC and\n   the Corporation for National\
    \ Research Initiatives.  The Beneficiary\n   of the IETF Trust is the IETF as\
    \ a whole.\n   Further details of the IETF Trust may be found at the IETF Trust's\n\
    \   website, <https://trustee.ietf.org/>.\n"
- title: 3.  Selection of Trustees
  contents:
  - "3.  Selection of Trustees\n   This document revises the original Trustee selection\
    \ procedures\n   defined in [RFC4071] and [RFC4371] to eliminate the requirement\
    \ that\n   Trustees be drawn from the members of the IAOC.\n   In this newly revised\
    \ IETF Trust structure, there will be five\n   Trustees.  Three shall be appointed\
    \ by the IETF Nominating Committee\n   (NomCom) and confirmed by the Internet\
    \ Engineering Steering Group\n   (IESG), one shall be appointed by the IESG, and\
    \ one shall be\n   appointed by the Internet Society (ISOC) Board of Trustees.\
    \  The\n   appointments by the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees do not\n  \
    \ require confirmation.\n   The IETF Trust Chair informs the nominating committee\
    \ of the Trustee\n   positions to be reviewed.  The IETF Trust will provide a\
    \ summary of\n   the expertise desired of the Trustee candidates to each appointing\n\
    \   body.\n   A change to the Trust Agreement is required to put this change into\n\
    \   effect, and this document requests that the current Trustees make\n   this\
    \ change at the earliest convenient time and no later than the end\n   of the\
    \ 104th IETF meeting in March 2019.\n   The terms of the appointed Trustees from\
    \ the IETF NomCom shall be\n   three years.  The initial selection shall be one,\
    \ two, and three year\n   terms in order to initially stagger the terms.  The\
    \ other\n   appointments by the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees shall be two\n\
    \   year terms, with the initial terms being one and two years,\n   respectively.\
    \  The goal of the staggered initial terms is to minimize\n   potential Trustee\
    \ turnover in any single year.  To maintain the\n   staggered terms, each appointing\
    \ body may, at its discretion, appoint\n   Trustees for shorter terms as needed\
    \ in exceptional situations, e.g.,\n   for mid-term vacancies or when an appointment\
    \ is not ready by the\n   time of the first IETF meeting of the year.\n   Once\
    \ the initial Trustee selections according to the procedures in\n   this document\
    \ are complete, and at each subsequent annual meeting of\n   the IETF Trust (once\
    \ new Trustees are seated), the Trustees shall\n   elect one Trustee to serve\
    \ as IETF Trust Chair by a majority vote of\n   the IETF Trust.\n   Trustees appointed\
    \ by the IETF NomCom may be recalled according to\n   the recall process described\
    \ in [BCP10].  Trustees appointed by the\n   IESG or by the ISOC Board of Directors\
    \ may be recalled by the\n   appointing body.  For appointments made by the IESG,\
    \ the IESG is\n   expected to run an open selection process and to consider the\n\
    \   necessary skill set and conflicts of interest as part of that\n   process.\n"
