  - "Abstract\n   The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Q.921-User Adaptation\n
    \  Layer (IUA) Protocol, described in RFC 4233, defines the message type\n   of
    Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI) Query Request messages as 5.\n   However, this
    number is already being used by the Digital Private\n   Network Signaling System
    (DPNSS)/Digital Access Signaling System 2\n   (DASS 2) Extensions (DUA) to the
    IUA Protocol described in RFC 4129.\n   This document updates RFC 4233 such that
    the message type of TEI\n   Query Request messages is 8.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Q.921-User
    Adaptation\n   Layer (IUA) protocol, described in [RFC3057], does not define a\n
    \  Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI) Query Request message.  The\n   Digital
    Private Network Signaling System (DPNSS)/Digital Access\n   Signaling System 2
    (DASS 2) Extensions (DUA) to the IUA Protocol,\n   described in [RFC4129], introduces
    Data Link Connection (DLC) Status\n   messages of type 5, 6, and 7.  Then, [RFC4233]
    was published, which\n   updates [RFC3057].  [RFC4233] also introduces the TEI
    Query Request\n   message and uses the message type of 5 for it.  This makes it\n
    \  impossible to differentiate the DLC Status request from a TEI Query\n   Request.\n
    \  This document updates [RFC4233].\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  New Message Type of the TEI Query Message\n   This document updates [RFC4233]
    by introducing the following change:\n   Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI) Query
    messages MUST be encoded\n   with a message type of 8 instead of 5 as described
    in [RFC4233].\n"

  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   In the \"Message Types\" section of the \"Signaling
    User Adaptation\n   Layer Assignments\" registry, IANA has reserved the message
    type 8 of\n   Management Messages for Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI) Query\n
    \  Request messages.\n"
