  - "       COMMENTS ON IMP/HOST PROTOCOL CHANGES, (RFCS 687 AND 690)\nBasically,\
    \ the proposed set of changes in RFC 687 seems reasonable, as\nare the comments\
    \ in RFC 690.\nThe major problem, as pointed out by Postel, is the change in the\n\
    combined length of the IMP and Host leaders to a total of 120 bits,\nwhich is\
    \ not a multiple of both 8 and 36 bits.\nThe suggested solution is to increase\
    \ the length of the host to host\nprotocol leader by 24 bits, creating a total\
    \ length of 144 bits.  The\nproblem, however, is that the only way of compatibly\
    \ changing this\nlength would be to have the IMP either insert or delete the extra\
    \ 24\nbits when converting to/from the old format leader.  The problems with\n\
    this solution are obvious.\nThe better solution is to change the length of the\
    \ new proposed IMP\nleader. I suggest 104 bits instead of 80 bits.  The complaint\
    \ that 104\nis not a multiple of an IMP word is valid, but it should not be that\n\
    difficult if the following rules are observed.\n    1.  The last 8 bits are never\
    \ used to convey information.\n    2.  The network is not required to pass them\
    \ from source to\n        destination, or to return them to the source.\n    3.\
    \  When sending messages of types other than zero, (irregular\n        messages),\
    \ the IMP is allowed to send either 96, 104 or 112 bits\n        of data, the\
    \ choice being at the IMP's convenience.\n    4.  Also, if desired, either 96\
    \ or 112 could be used as the new\n        leader length for irregular messages.\n\
    It must be faster (and cheaper) to just change the IMP program to handle\na 104\
    \ bit leader, than to force additional changes in all hosts using\nthe standard\
    \ protocol.\nAnother suggested extension to the protocol would add a new type\
    \ of IMP\nto Host message.  This message has a table of Host names (people type\n\
    character strings) and Host network addresses.  Send this message(s) to\nthe Host\
    \ after each interface reset, or alternatively, it could be a\nresponse to a new\
    \ Host to IMP request for this information.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie\
