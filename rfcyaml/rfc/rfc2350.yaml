- title: 1 Introduction

  - "1 Introduction\n   The GRIP Working Group was formed to create a document that\
    \ describes\n   the community's expectations of computer security incident response\n\
    \   teams (CSIRTs).  Although the need for such a document originated in\n   the\
    \ general Internet community, the expectations expressed should\n   also closely\
    \ match those of more restricted communities.\n   In the past there have been\
    \ misunderstandings regarding what to\n   expect from CSIRTs.  The goal of this\
    \ document is to provide a\n   framework for presenting the important subjects\
    \ (related to incident\n   response) that are of concern to the community.\n \
    \  Before continuing, it is important to clearly understand what is\n   meant\
    \ by the term \"Computer Security Incident Response Team.\"  For\n   the purposes\
    \ of this document, a CSIRT is a team that performs,\n   coordinates, and supports\
    \ the response to security incidents that\n   involve sites within a defined constituency\
    \ (see Appendix A for a\n   more complete definition).  Any group calling itself\
    \ a CSIRT for a\n   specific constituency must therefore react to reported security\n\
    \   incidents, and to threats to \"their\" constituency in ways which the\n  \
    \ specific community agrees to be in its general interest.\n   Since it is vital\
    \ that each member of a constituent community be able\n   to understand what is\
    \ reasonable to expect of their team, a CSIRT\n   should make it clear who belongs\
    \ to their constituency and define the\n   services the team offers to the community.\
    \ Additionally, each CSIRT\n   should publish its policies and operating procedures.\
    \ Similarly,\n   these same constituents need to know what is expected of them\
    \ in\n   order for them to receive the services of their team.  This requires\n\
    \   that the team also publish how and where to report incidents.\n   This document\
    \ details a template which will be used by CSIRTs to\n   communicate this information\
    \ to their constituents.  The constituents\n   should certainly expect a CSIRT\
    \ to provide the services they describe\n   in the completed template.\n   It\
    \ must be emphasized that without active participation from users,\n   the effectiveness\
    \ of the CSIRT's services can be greatly diminished.\n   This is particularly\
    \ the case with reporting.  At a minimum, users\n   need to know that they should\
    \ report security incidents, and know how\n   and to where they should report\
    \ them.\n   Many computer security incidents originate outside local community\n\
    \   boundaries and affect inside sites, others originate inside the local\n  \
    \ community and affect hosts or users on the outside.  Often,\n   therefore, the\
    \ handling of security incidents will involve multiple\n   sites and potentially\
    \ multiple CSIRTs.  Resolving these incidents\n   will require cooperation between\
    \ individual sites and CSIRTs, and\n   between CSIRTs.\n   Constituent communities\
    \ need to know exactly how their CSIRT will be\n   working with other CSIRTs and\
    \ organizations outside their\n   constituency, and what information will be shared.\n\
    \   The rest of this document describes the set of topics and issues that\n  \
    \ CSIRTs need to elaborate for their constituents. However, there is no\n   attempt\
    \ to specify the \"correct\" answer to any one topic area.\n   Rather, each topic\
    \ is discussed in terms of what that topic means.\n   Chapter two provides an\
    \ overview of three major areas:  the\n   publishing of information by a response\
    \ team, the definition of the\n   response team's relationship to other response\
    \ teams, and the need\n   for secure communications.  Chapter three describes\
    \ in detail all the\n   types of information that the community needs to know\
    \ about their\n   response team.\n   For ease of use by the community, these topics\
    \ are condensed into an\n   outline template found in Appendix D.  This template\
    \ can be used by\n   constituents to elicit information from their CSIRT.\n  \
    \ It is the working group's sincere hope that through clarification of\n   the\
    \ topics in this document, understanding between the community and\n   its CSIRTs\
    \ will be increased.\n"
- title: 2 Scope
  contents:
  - "2 Scope\n   The interactions between an incident response team and its\n   constituent\
    \ community response team require first that the community\n   understand the\
    \ policies and procedures of the response team. Second,\n   since many response\
    \ teams collaborate to handle incidents, the\n   community must also understand\
    \ the relationship between their\n   response team and other teams.  Finally,\
    \ many interactions will take\n   advantage of existing public infrastructures,\
    \ so the community needs\n   to know how those communications will be protected.\
    \ Each of these\n   subjects will be described in more detail in the following\
    \ three\n   sections.\n"
- title: 2.1 Publishing CSIRT Policies and Procedures
  contents:
  - "2.1 Publishing CSIRT Policies and Procedures\n   Each user who has access to\
    \ a Computer Security Incident Response\n   Team should know as much as possible\
    \ about the services of and\n   interactions with this team long before he or\
    \ she actually needs\n   them.\n   A clear statement of the policies and procedures\
    \ of a CSIRT helps the\n   constituent understand how best to report incidents\
    \ and what support\n   to expect afterwards.  Will the CSIRT assist in resolving\
    \ the\n   incident?   Will it provide help in avoiding incidents in the future?\n\
    \   Clear expectations, particularly of the limitations of the services\n   provided\
    \ by a CSIRT, will make interaction with it more efficient and\n   effective.\n\
    \   There are different kinds of response teams: some have very broad\n   constituencies\
    \ (e.g., CERT Coordination Center and the Internet),\n   others have more bounded\
    \ constituencies (e.g., DFN-CERT, CIAC), and\n   still others have very restricted\
    \ constituencies (e.g., commercial\n   response teams, corporate response teams).\
    \  Regardless of the type of\n   response team, the constituency supported by\
    \ it must be knowledgeable\n   about the team's policies and procedures. Therefore,\
    \ it is mandatory\n   that response teams publish such information to their constituency.\n\
    \   A CSIRT should communicate all necessary information about its\n   policies\
    \ and services in a form suitable to the needs of its\n   constituency.  It is\
    \ important to understand that not all policies\n   and procedures need be publicly\
    \ available.  For example, it is not\n   necessary to understand the internal\
    \ operation of a team in order to\n   interact with it, as when reporting an incident\
    \ or receiving guidance\n   on how to analyze or secure one's systems.\n   In\
    \ the past, some teams supplied a kind of Operational Framework,\n   others provided\
    \ a Frequently Asked Questions list (FAQ), while still\n   others wrote papers\
    \ for distribution at user conferences or sent\n   newsletters.\n   We recommend\
    \ that each CSIRT publish its guidelines and procedures on\n   its own information\
    \ server (e.g. a World Wide Web server).  This\n   would allow constituents to\
    \ easily access it, though the problem\n   remains of how a constituent can find\
    \ his or her team; people within\n   the constituency have to discover that there\
    \ is a CSIRT \"at their\n   disposal.\"\n   It is foreseen that completed CSIRT\
    \ templates will soon become\n   searchable by modern search engines,  which will\
    \ aid in distributing\n   information about the existence of CSIRTs and basic\
    \ information\n   required to approach them.\n   It would be very useful to have\
    \ a central repository containing all\n   the completed CSIRT templates.  No such\
    \ repository exists at the time\n   of writing, though this might change in the\
    \ future.\n   Regardless of the source from which the information is retrieved,\
    \ the\n   user of the template must check its authenticity.  It is highly\n  \
    \ recommended that such vital documents be protected by digital\n   signatures.\
    \  These will allow the user to verify that the template\n   was indeed published\
    \ by the CSIRT and that it has not been tampered\n   with. This document assumes\
    \ the reader is familiar with the proper\n   use of digital signatures to determine\
    \ whether a document is\n   authentic.\n"
- title: 2.2 Relationships between different CSIRTs
  contents:
  - "2.2 Relationships between different CSIRTs\n   In some cases a CSIRT may be able\
    \ to operate effectively on its own\n   and in close cooperation with its constituency.\
    \  But with today's\n   international networks it is much more likely that most\
    \ of the\n   incidents handled by a CSIRT will involve parties external to its\n\
    \   constituency.  Therefore the team will need to interact with other\n   CSIRTs\
    \ and sites outside its constituency.\n   The constituent community should understand\
    \ the nature and extent of\n   this collaboration, as very sensitive information\
    \ about individual\n   constituents may be disclosed in the process.\n   Inter-CSIRT\
    \ interactions could include asking other teams for advice,\n   disseminating\
    \ knowledge of problems, and working cooperatively to\n   resolve a security incident\
    \ affecting one or more of the CSIRTs'\n   constituencies.\n   In establishing\
    \ relationships to support such interactions, CSIRTs\n   must decide what kinds\
    \ of agreements can exist between them so as to\n   share yet safeguard information,\
    \ whether this relationship can be\n   disclosed, and if so to whom.\n   Note\
    \ that there is a difference between a peering agreement, where\n   the CSIRTs\
    \ involved agree to work together and share information, and\n   simple co-operation,\
    \ where a CSIRT (or any other organization) simply\n   contacts another CSIRT\
    \ and asks for help or advice.\n   Although the establishment of such relationships\
    \ is very important\n   and affects the ability of a CSIRT to support its constituency,\
    \ it is\n   up to the teams involved to decide about the details.  It is beyond\n\
    \   the scope of this document to make recommendations for this process.\n   However,\
    \ the same set of information used to set expectations for a\n   user community\
    \ regarding sharing of information will help other\n   parties to understand the\
    \ objectives and services of a specific\n   CSIRT, supporting a first contact.\n"
- title: 2.3 Establishing Secure Communications
  contents:
  - "2.3 Establishing Secure Communications\n   Once one party has decided to share\
    \ information with another party,\n   or two parties have agreed to share information\
    \ or work together - as\n   required for the coordination of computer security\
    \ incident response\n   - all parties involved need secure communications channels.\
    \ (In this\n   context, \"secure\" refers to the protected transmission of information\n\
    \   shared between different parties, and not to the appropriate use of\n   the\
    \ information by the parties.)\n   The goals of secure communication are:\n  \
    \    - Confidentiality:\n        Can somebody else access the content of the communication?\n\
    \      - Integrity:\n        Can somebody else manipulate the content of the communication?\n\
    \      - Authenticity:\n        Am I communicating with the \"right\" person?\n\
    \   It is very easy to send forged e-mail, and not hard to establish a\n   (false)\
    \ identity by telephone.    Cryptographic techniques, for\n   example Pretty Good\
    \ Privacy (PGP) or Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) can\n   provide effective ways\
    \ of securing e-mail.  With the correct\n   equipment it is also possible to secure\
    \ telephone communication. But\n   before using such mechanisms, both parties\
    \ need the \"right\"\n   infrastructure, which is to say preparation in advance.\
    \  The most\n   important preparation is ensuring the authenticity of the\n  \
    \ cryptographic keys used in secure communication:\n   - Public keys (for techniques\
    \ like PGP and PEM):\n     Because they are accessible through the Internet, public\
    \ keys must\n     be authenticated before use.  While PGP relies on a \"Web of\
    \ Trust\"\n     (where users sign the keys of other users), PEM relies on a\n\
    \     hierarchy (where certification authorities sign the keys of users).\n  \
    \ - Secret keys (for techniques like DES and PGP/conventional\n     encryption):\
    \  Because these must be known to both sender and\n     receiver, secret keys\
    \ must be exchanged before the communication\n     via a secure channel.\n   Communication\
    \ is critical to all aspects of incident response.  A\n   team can best support\
    \ the use of the above-mentioned techniques by\n   gathering all relevant information,\
    \ in a consistent way.  Specific\n   requirements (such as calling a specific\
    \ number to check the\n   authenticity of keys) should be clear from the start.\
    \  CSIRT\n   templates provide a standardized vehicle for delivering this\n  \
    \ information.\n   It is beyond the scope of this document to address the technical\
    \ and\n   administrative problems of secure communications.  The point is that\n\
    \   response teams must support and use a method to secure the\n   communications\
    \ between themselves and their constituents (or other\n   response teams).  Whatever\
    \ the mechanism is, the level of protection\n   it provides must be acceptable\
    \ to the constituent community.\n"
- title: 3 Information, Policies and Procedures
  contents:
  - "3 Information, Policies and Procedures\n   In chapter 2 it was mentioned that\
    \ the policies and procedures of a\n   response team need to be published to their\
    \ constituent community.\n   In this chapter we will list all the types of information\
    \ that the\n   community needs to receive from its response team.  How this\n\
    \   information is communicated to a community will differ from team to\n   team,\
    \ as will the specific information content.  The intent here is\n   to clearly\
    \ describe the various kinds of information that a\n   constituent community expects\
    \ from its response team.\n   To make it easier to understand the issues and topics\
    \ relevant to the\n   interaction of constituents with \"their\" CSIRT, we suggest\
    \ that a\n   CSIRT publish all information, policies, and procedures addressing\n\
    \   its constituency as a document, following the template given in\n   Appendix\
    \ D.  The template structure arranges items, making it easy to\n   supply specific\
    \ information; in Appendix E we provide an example of a\n   filled-out template\
    \ for the fictitious XYZ University.  While no\n   recommendations are made as\
    \ to what a CSIRT should adopt for its\n   policy or procedures, different possibilities\
    \ are outlined to give\n   some examples.  The most important thing is that a\
    \ CSIRT have a\n   policy and that those who interact with the CSIRT be able to\
    \ obtain\n   and understand it.\n   As always, not every aspect for every environment\
    \ and/or team can be\n   covered.  This outline should be seen as a suggestion.\
    \  Each team\n   should feel free to include whatever they think is necessary\
    \ to\n   support its constituency.\n"

  - "3.1 Obtaining the Document\n   Details of a CSIRT change with time, so the completed\
    \ template must\n   indicate when it was last changed.  Additionally, information\
    \ should\n   be provided concerning how to find out about future updates. Without\n\

  - "3.3 Charter\n   Every CSIRT must have a charter which specifies what it is to\
    \ do, and\n   the authority under which it will do it.  The charter should include\n\
    \   at least the following items:\n   - Mission statement\n   - Constituency\n\
    \   - Sponsorship / affiliation\n   - Authority\n"
- title: 3.3.1 Mission Statement
  contents:
  - "3.3.1 Mission Statement\n   The mission statement should focus on the team's\
    \ core activities,\n   already stated in the definition of a CSIRT.  In order\
    \ to be\n   considered a Computer Security Incident Response Team, the team must\n\
    \   support the reporting of incidents and support its constituency by\n   dealing\
    \ with incidents.\n   The goals and purposes of a team are especially important,\
    \ and\n   require clear, unambiguous definition.\n"
- title: 3.3.2 Constituency
  contents:
  - "3.3.2 Constituency\n   A CSIRT's constituency can be determined in any of several\
    \ ways. For\n   example it could be a company's employees or its paid subscribers,\
    \ or\n   it could be defined in terms of a technological focus, such as the\n\
    \   users of a particular operating system.\n   The definition of the constituency\
    \ should create a perimeter around\n   the group to whom the team will provide\
    \ service.  The policy section\n   of the document (see below) should explain\
    \ how requests from outside\n   this perimeter will be handled.\n   If a CSIRT\
    \ decides not to disclose its constituency, it should\n   explain the reasoning\
    \ behind this decision. For example, for-fee\n   CSIRTs will not list their clients\
    \ but will declare that they provide\n   a service to a large group of customers\
    \ that are kept confidential\n   because of the clients' contracts.\n   Constituencies\
    \ might overlap, as when an ISP provides a CSIRT which\n   delivers services to\
    \ customer sites that also have CSIRTs.  The\n   Authority section of the CSIRT's\
    \ description (see below) should make\n   such relationships clear.\n"
- title: 3.3.3 Sponsoring Organization / Affiliation
  contents:
  - "3.3.3 Sponsoring Organization / Affiliation\n   The sponsoring organization,\
    \ which authorizes the actions of the\n   CSIRT, should be given next.   Knowing\
    \ this will help the users to\n   understand the background and set-up of the\
    \ CSIRT, and it is vital\n   information for building trust between a constituent\
    \ and a CSIRT.\n"
- title: 3.3.4 Authority
  contents:
  - "3.3.4 Authority\n   This section will vary greatly from one CSIRT to another,\
    \ based on\n   the relationship between the team and its constituency.   While\
    \ an\n   organizational CSIRT will be given its authority by the management of\n\
    \   the organization, a community CSIRT will be supported and chosen by\n   the\
    \ community, usually in a advisory role.\n   A CSIRT may or may not have the authority\
    \ to intervene in the\n   operation of all of the systems within its perimeter.\
    \  It should\n   identify the scope of its control as distinct from the perimeter\
    \ of\n   its constituency.  If other CSIRTs operate hierarchically within its\n\
    \   perimeter, this should be mentioned here, and the related CSIRTs\n   identified.\n\
    \   Disclosure of a team's authority may expose it to claims of\n   liability.\
    \  Every team should seek legal advice on these matters.\n   (See section 3.7\
    \ for more on liability.)\n"
- title: 3.4 Policies
  contents:
  - "3.4 Policies\n   It is critical that Incident Response Teams define their policies.\n\
    \   The following sections discuss communication of these policies to the\n  \
    \ constituent community.\n"
- title: 3.4.1 Types of Incidents and Level of Support
  contents:
  - "3.4.1 Types of Incidents and Level of Support\n   The types of incident which\
    \ the team is able to address, and the\n   level of support which the team will\
    \ offer when responding to each\n   type of incident, should be summarized here\
    \ in list form.  The\n   Services section (see below) provides the opportunity\
    \ to give more\n   detailed descriptions, and to address non-incident-related\
    \ topics.\n   The level of support may change depending on factors such as the\n\
    \   team's workload and the completeness of the information available.\n   Such\
    \ factors should be outlined and their impact should be explained.\n   As a list\
    \ of known types of incidents will be incomplete with regard\n   to possible or\
    \ future incidents, a CSIRT should also give some\n   background on the \"default\"\
    \ support for incident types not otherwise\n   mentioned.\n   The team should\
    \ state whether it will act on information it receives\n   about vulnerabilities\
    \ which create opportunities for future\n   incidents.  A commitment to act on\
    \ such information on behalf of its\n   constituency is regarded as an optional\
    \ proactive service policy\n   rather than a core service requirement for a CSIRT.\n"
- title: 3.4.2 Co-operation, Interaction and Disclosure of Information
  contents:
  - "3.4.2 Co-operation, Interaction and Disclosure of Information\n   This section\
    \ should make explicit which related groups the CSIRT\n   routinely interacts\
    \ with.  Such interactions are not necessarily\n   related to the computer security\
    \ incident response provided, but are\n   used to facilitate better cooperation\
    \ on technical topics or\n   services.  By no means need details about cooperation\
    \ agreements be\n   given out; the main objective of this section is to give the\n\
    \   constituency a basic understanding of what kind of interactions are\n   established\
    \ and what their purpose is.\n   Cooperation between CSIRTs can be facilitated\
    \ by the use of unique\n   ticket number assignment combined with explicit handoff\
    \ procedures.\n   This reduces the chance of misunderstandings, duplications of\
    \ effort,\n   assists in incident tracking and prevents 'loops' in communication.\n\
    \   The reporting and disclosure policy should make clear who will be the\n  \
    \ recipients of a CSIRT's report in each circumstance.  It should also\n   note\
    \ whether the team will expect to operate through another CSIRT or\n   directly\
    \ with a member of another constituency over matters\n   specifically concerning\
    \ that member.\n   Related groups a CSIRT will interact with are listed below:\n\
    \   Incident Response Teams:\n      A CSIRT will often need to interact with other\
    \ CSIRTs.  For\n      example a CSIRT within a large company may need to report\n\
    \      incidents to a national CSIRT, and a national CSIRT may need to\n     \
    \ report incidents to national CSIRTs in other countries to deal\n      with all\
    \ sites involved in a large-scale attack.\n      Collaboration between CSIRTs\
    \ may lead to disclosure of\n      information.  The following are examples of\
    \ such disclosure, but\n      are not intended to be an exhaustive list:\n   \
    \    - Reporting incidents within the constituency to other teams.\n         If\
    \ this is done, site-related information may become public\n         knowledge,\
    \ accessible to everyone, in particular the press.\n       - Handling incidents\
    \ occurring within the constituency, but\n         reported from outside it (which\
    \ implies that some information\n         has already been disclosed off-site).\n\
    \       - Reporting observations from within the constituency indicating\n   \
    \      suspected or confirmed incidents outside it.\n       - Acting on reports\
    \ of incidents from outside the constituency.\n       - Passing information about\
    \ vulnerabilities to vendors, to\n         partner CSIRTs or directly to affected\
    \ sites lying within or\n         outside the constituency.\n       - Feedback\
    \ to parties reporting incidents or vulnerabilities.\n       - The provision of\
    \ contact information relating to members of\n         the constituency, members\
    \ of other constituencies, other\n         CSIRTs, or law-enforcement agencies.\n\
    \   Vendors:\n      Some vendors have their own CSIRTs, but some vendors may not.\
    \  In\n      such cases a CSIRT will need to work directly with a vendor to\n\
    \      suggest improvements or modifications, to analyze the technical\n     \
    \ problem or to test provided solutions.  Vendors play a special\n      role in\
    \ handling an incident if their products' vulnerabilities\n      are involved\
    \ in the incident.\n   Law-enforcement agencies:\n      These include the police\
    \ and other investigative agencies.  CSIRTs\n      and users of the template should\
    \ be sensitive to local laws and\n      regulations, which may vary considerably\
    \ in different countries.\n      A CSIRT might advise on technical details of\
    \ attacks or seek\n      advice on the legal implications of an incident. Local\
    \ laws and\n      regulations may include specific reporting and confidentiality\n\
    \      requirements.\n   Press:\n      A CSIRT may be approached by the press\
    \ for information and comment\n      from time to time.\n      An explicit policy\
    \ concerning disclosure to the press can be\n      helpful, particularly in clarifying\
    \ the expectations of a CSIRT's\n      constituency.  The press policy will have\
    \ to clarify the same\n      topics as above more specifically, as the constituency\
    \ will\n      usually be very sensitive to press contacts.\n   Other:\n      This\
    \ might include research activities or the relation to the\n      sponsoring organization.\n\
    \   The default status of any and all security-related information which\n   a\
    \ team receives will usually be 'confidential,' but rigid adherence\n   to this\
    \ makes the team to appear to be an informational 'black hole,'\n   which may\
    \ reduce the likelihood of the team's obtaining cooperation\n   from clients and\
    \ from other organizations.  The CSIRT's template\n   should define what information\
    \ it will report or disclose, to whom,\n   and when.\n   Different teams are likely\
    \ to be subject to different legal\n   restraints requiring or limiting disclosure,\
    \ especially if they work\n   in different jurisdictions.  In addition, they may\
    \ have reporting\n   requirements imposed by their sponsoring organization.  Each\
    \ team's\n   template should specify any such constraints, both to clarify users'\n\
    \   expectations and to inform other teams.\n   Conflicts of interest, particularly\
    \ in commercial matters, may also\n   restrain disclosure by a team; this document\
    \ does not recommend on\n   how such conflicts should be addressed.\n   A team\
    \ will normally collect statistics.  If statistical information\n   is distributed,\
    \ the template's reporting and disclosure policy should\n   say so, and should\
    \ describe how to obtain such statistics.\n"
- title: 3.4.3 Communication and Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.4.3 Communication and Authentication\n   You must have a policy which describes\
    \ methods of secure and\n   verifiable communication that you will use.  This\
    \ is necessary for\n   communication between CSIRTs and between a CSIRT and its\n\
    \   constituents.  The template should include public keys or pointers to\n  \
    \ them, including key fingerprints, together with guidelines on how to\n   use\
    \ this information to check authenticity and how to deal with\n   corrupted information\
    \ (for example where to report this fact).\n   At the moment it is recommended\
    \ that as a minimum every CSIRT have\n   (if possible), a PGP key available. \
    \ A team may also make other\n   mechanisms available (for example PEM, MOSS,\
    \ S/MIME), according to\n   its needs and the needs of its constituents.   Note\
    \ however, that\n   CSIRTs and users should be sensitive to local laws and regulations.\n\
    \   Some countries do not allow strong encryption, or enforce specific\n   policies\
    \ on the use of encryption technology.  In addition to\n   encrypting sensitive\
    \ information whenever possible, correspondence\n   should include digital signatures.\
    \  (Please note that in most\n   countries, the protection of authenticity by\
    \ using digital signatures\n   is not affected by existing encryption regulations.)\n\
    \   For communication via telephone or facsimile a CSIRT may keep secret\n   authentication\
    \ data for parties with whom they may deal, such as an\n   agreed password or\
    \ phrase.  Obviously, such secret keys must not be\n   published, though their\
    \ existence may be.\n"
- title: 3.5 Services
  contents:
  - "3.5 Services\n   Services provided by a CSIRT can be roughly divided into two\n\
    \   categories: real-time activities directly related to the main task of\n  \
    \ incident response, and non-real-time proactive activities, supportive\n   of\
    \ the incident response task. The second category and part of the\n   first category\

- title: 3.6 Incident Reporting Forms

  - "3.6 Incident Reporting Forms\n   The use of reporting forms makes it simpler\

    \ the\n   team, and can therefore come well prepared.  The team gets all the\n\
    \   necessary information at once with the first report and can proceed\n   efficiently.\n\
    \   Depending on the objectives and services of a particular CSIRT,\n   multiple\
    \ forms may be used, for example a reporting form for a new\n   vulnerability\
    \ may be very different from the form used for reporting\n   incidents.\n   It\
    \ is most efficient to provide forms through the online information\n   services\
    \ of the team.  The exact pointers to them should be given in\n   the CSIRT description\
    \ document, together with statements about\n   appropriate use, and guidelines\
    \ for when and how to use the forms. If\n   separate e-mail addresses are supported\

- title: 3.7 Disclaimers
  contents:
  - "3.7 Disclaimers\n   Although the CSIRT description document does not constitute\
    \ a\n   contract, liability may conceivably result from its descriptions of\n\
    \   services and purposes.  The inclusion of a disclaimer at the end of\n   the\
    \ template is therefore recommended and should warn the user about\n   possible\
    \ limitations.\n   In situations where the original version of a document must\
    \ be\n   translated into another language, the translation should carry a\n  \
    \ disclaimer and a pointer to the original.  For example:\n      Although we tried\
    \ to carefully translate the original document\n      from German into English,\
    \ we can not be certain that both\n      documents express the same thoughts in\
    \ the same level of detail\n      and correctness.  In all cases, where there\
    \ is a difference\n      between both versions, the German version will prevail.\n\
    \   The use of and protection by disclaimers is affected by local laws\n   and\

    \ should check the disclaimer with a lawyer.\n"
- title: 'Appendix A: Glossary of Terms'
  contents:
  - "Appendix A: Glossary of Terms\n   This glossary defines terms used in describing\
    \ security incidents and\n   Computer Security Incident Response Teams.  Only\
    \ a limited list is\n   included.  For more definitions please refer to other\
    \ sources, for\n   example to the Internet User's Glossary [RFC 1983].\n   Constituency:\n\
    \      Implicit in the purpose of a Computer Security Incident Response\n    \
    \  Team is the existence of a constituency.  This is the group of\n      users,\
    \ sites, networks or organizations served by the team.  The\n      team must be\
    \ recognized by its constituency in order to be\n      effective.\n   Security\
    \ Incident:\n      For the purpose of this document, this term is a synonym of\n\
    \      Computer Security Incident: any adverse event which compromises\n     \
    \ some aspect of computer or network security.\n      The definition of an incident\
    \ may vary between organizations, but\n      at least the following categories\
    \ are generally applicable:\n      - Loss of confidentiality of information.\n\
    \      - Compromise of integrity of information.\n      - Denial of service.\n\
    \      - Misuse of service, systems or information.\n      - Damage to systems.\n\
    \      These are very general categories.  For instance the replacement\n    \
    \  of a system utility program by a Trojan Horse is an example of '\n      compromise\
    \ of integrity,' and a successful password attack is an\n      example of 'loss\
    \ of confidentiality.'  Attacks, even if they\n      failed because of proper\
    \ protection, can be regarded as Incidents.\n      Within the definition of an\
    \ incident the word 'compromised' is\n      used.  Sometimes an administrator\
    \ may only 'suspect' an incident.\n      During the response it must be established\
    \ whether or not an\n      incident has really occurred.\n   Computer Security\
    \ Incident Response Team:\n      Based on two of the definitions given above,\
    \ a CSIRT is a team\n      that coordinates and supports the response to security\
    \ incidents\n      that involve sites within a defined constituency.\n      In\
    \ order to be considered a CSIRT, a team must:\n      - Provide a (secure) channel\
    \ for receiving reports about\n        suspected incidents.\n      - Provide assistance\
    \ to members of its constituency in\n        handling these incidents.\n     \
    \ - Disseminate incident-related information to its\n        constituency and\
    \ to other involved parties.\n      Note that we are not referring here to police\
    \ or other law\n      enforcement bodies which may investigate computer-related\
    \ crime.\n      CSIRT members, indeed, need not have any powers beyond those of\n\
    \      ordinary citizens.\n   Vendor:\n      A 'vendor' is any entity that produces\
    \ networking or computing\n      technology, and is responsible for the technical\
    \ content of that\n      technology.  Examples of 'technology' include hardware\
    \ (desktop\n      computers, routers, switches, etc.), and software (operating\n\
    \      systems, mail forwarding systems, etc.).\n      Note that the supplier\
    \ of a technology is not necessarily the '\n      vendor' of that technology.\
    \  As an example, an Internet Service\n      Provider (ISP) might supply routers\
    \ to each of its customers, but\n      the 'vendor' is the manufacturer, since\
    \ the manufacturer, rather\n      than the ISP, is the entity responsible for\
    \ the technical content\n      of the router.\n   Vulnerability:\n      A 'vulnerability'\
    \ is a characteristic of a piece of technology\n      which can be exploited to\
    \ perpetrate a security incident.  For\n      example, if a program unintentionally\
    \ allowed ordinary users to\n      execute arbitrary operating system commands\
    \ in privileged mode,\n      this \"feature\" would be a vulnerability.\n"

  - "Appendix C: Known Computer Security Incident Response Teams\n   Today, there\
    \ are many different CSIRTs but no single source lists\n   every team. Most of\
    \ the major and long established teams (the first\n   CSIRT was founded in 1988)\
    \ are nowadays members of FIRST, the\n   worldwide Forum of Incident Response\
    \ and Security Teams.  At the time\n   of writing, more than 55 teams are members\
    \ (1 in Australia, 13 in\n   Europe, all others in North America).  Information\
    \ about FIRST can be\n   found:\n   - http://www.first.org/\n   The current list\
    \ of members is available also, with the relevant\n   contact information and\
    \ some additional information provided by the\n   particular teams:\n   - http://www.first.org/team-info/\n\
    \   For CSIRTs which want to become members of this forum (please note\n   that\
    \ a team needs a sponsor - a team which is already a full member\n   of FIRST\

    \  This is a mail alias that relays mail\n        to the human(s) on duty for\
    \ the XYZ-CERT.\n   2.8 Public Keys and Other Encryption Information\n       \
    \ The XYZ-CERT has a PGP key, whose KeyID is 12345678 and\n        whose fingerprint\
    \ is\n          11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88  88 77 66 55 44 33 22 11.\n        The\
    \ key and its signatures can be found at the usual large\n        public keyservers.\n\
    \        Because PGP is still a relatively new technology at XYZ\n        University,\
    \ this key still has relatively few signatures;\n        efforts are underway\
    \ to increase the number of links to this\n        key in the PGP \"web of trust\"\
    .  In the meantime, since most\n        fellow universities in Quebec have at\
    \ least one staff member\n        who knows the XYZ-CERT coordinator Zoe Doe,\
    \ Zoe Doe has\n        signed the XYZ-CERT key, and will be happy to confirm its\n\
    \        fingerprint and that of her own key to those people who know\n      \
    \  her, by telephone or in person.\n   2.9 Team Members\n        Zoe Doe of Computing\
    \ Services is the XYZ-CERT coordinator.\n        Backup coordinators and other\
    \ team members, along with their\n        areas of expertise and contact information,\
    \ are listed in the\n        XYZ-CERT web pages, at\n          http://www.xyz-univ.ca/xyz-cert/teamlist.html\n\
    \        Management, liaison and supervision are provided by Steve Tree,\n   \
    \     Assistant Director (Technical Services), Computing Services.\n   2.10 Other\
    \ Information\n        General information about the XYZ-CERT, as well as links\
    \ to\n        various recommended security resources, can be found at\n      \
    \    http://www.xyz-univ.ca/xyz-cert/index.html\n   2.11 Points of Customer Contact\n\
    \        The preferred method for contacting the XYZ-CERT is via\n        e-mail\
    \ at <xyz-cert@xyz-univ.ca>; e-mail sent to this address\n        will \"biff\"\
    \ the responsible human, or be automatically\n        forwarded to the appropriate\
    \ backup person, immediately.  If\n        you require urgent assistance, put\
    \ \"urgent\" in your subject\n        line.\n        If it is not possible (or\
    \ not advisable for security reasons)\n        to use e-mail, the XYZ-CERT can\
    \ be reached by telephone during\n        regular office hours.  Telephone messages\
    \ are checked less\n        often than e-mail.\n        The XYZ-CERT's hours of\
    \ operation are generally restricted to\n        regular business hours (09:00-17:00\
    \ Monday to Friday except\n        holidays).\n        If possible, when submitting\
    \ your report, use the form\n        mentioned in section 6.\n   3. Charter\n\
    \   3.1 Mission Statement\n        The purpose of the XYZ-CERT is, first, to assist\
    \ members of XYZ\n        University community in implementing proactive measures\
    \ to\n        reduce the risks of computer security incidents, and second, to\n\
    \        assist XYZ community in responding to such incidents when they\n    \
    \    occur.\n   3.2 Constituency\n        The XYZ-CERT's constituency is the XYZ\
    \ University community,\n        as defined in the context of the \"XYZ University\
    \ Policy on\n        Computing Facilities\".  This policy is available at\n  \
    \        http://www-compserv.xyz-univ.ca/policies/pcf.html\n        However, please\
    \ note that, notwithtanding the above, XYZ-CERT\n        services will be provided\
    \ for on-site systems only.\n   3.3 Sponsorship and/or Affiliation\n        The\
    \ XYZ-CERT is sponsored by the ACME Canadian Research\n        Network.  It maintains\
    \ affiliations with various University\n        CSIRTs throughout Canada and the\
    \ USA on an as needed basis.\n   3.4 Authority\n        The XYZ-CERT operates\
    \ under the auspices of, and with authority\n        delegated by, the Department\
    \ of Computing Services of XYZ\n        University.  For further information on\
    \ the mandate and\n        authority of the Department of Computing Services,\
    \ please\n        refer to the XYZ University \"Policy on Computing Facilities\"\
    ,\n        available at\n          http://www-compserv.xyz-univ.ca/policies/pcf.html\n\
    \        The XYZ-CERT expects to work cooperatively with system\n        administrators\
    \ and users at XYZ University, and, insofar as\n        possible, to avoid authoritarian\
    \ relationships.  However,\n        should circumstances warrant it, the XYZ-CERT\
    \ will appeal to\n        Computing Services to exert its authority, direct or\
    \ indirect,\n        as necessary.  All members of the XYZ-CERT are members of\
    \ the\n        CCSA (Committee of Computer Systems Administrators), and have\n\
    \        all of the powers and responsibilities assigned to Systems\n        Administrators\
    \ by the Policy on Computing Facilities, or are\n        members of University\
    \ management.\n        Members of the XYZ University community who wish to appeal\
    \ the\n        actions of the XYZ-CERT should contact the Assistant Director\n\
    \        (Technical Services), Computing Services.  If this recourse is\n    \
    \    not satisfactory, the matter may be referred to the Director\n        of\
    \ Computing Services (in the case of perceived\n        problems with existing\
    \ policy), or to the XYZ University\n        Office of Rights and Responsibilities\
    \ (in the case of perceived\n        errors in the application of existing policy).\n\
    \   4. Policies\n   4.1 Types of Incidents and Level of Support\n        The XYZ-CERT\
    \ is authorized to address all types of computer\n        security incidents which\
    \ occur, or threaten to occur, at\n        XYZ University.\n        The level\
    \ of support given by XYZ-CERT will vary depending on\n        the type and severity\
    \ of the incident or issue, the type of\n        constituent, the size of the\
    \ user community affected, and the\n        XYZ-CERT's resources at the time,\
    \ though in all cases some\n        response will be made within one working day.\
    \  Resources will\n        be assigned according to the following priorities,\
    \ listed in\n        decreasing order:\n          - Threats to the physical safety\
    \ of human beings.\n          - Root or system-level attacks on any Management\
    \ Information\n            System, or any part of the backbone network infrastructure.\n\
    \          - Root or system-level attacks on any large public service\n      \
    \      machine, either multi-user or dedicated-purpose.\n          - Compromise\
    \ of restricted confidential service accounts or\n            software installations,\
    \ in particular those used for MIS\n            applications containing confidential\
    \ data, or those used\n            for system administration.\n          - Denial\
    \ of service attacks on any of the above three items.\n          - Any of the\
    \ above at other sites, originating from XYZ\n            University.\n      \
    \    - Large-scale attacks of any kind, e.g. sniffing attacks,\n            IRC\
    \ \"social engineering\" attacks, password cracking\n            attacks.\n  \
    \        - Threats, harassment, and other criminal offenses\n            involving\
    \ individual user accounts.\n          - Compromise of individual user accounts\
    \ on multi-user\n            systems.\n          - Compromise of desktop systems.\n\
    \          - Forgery and misrepresentation, and other security-related\n     \
    \       violations of local rules and regulations, e.g. netnews\n            and\
    \ e-mail forgery, unauthorized use of IRC bots.\n          - Denial of service\
    \ on individual user accounts, e.g.\n            mailbombing.\n        Types of\
    \ incidents other than those mentioned above will be\n        prioritized according\
    \ to their apparent severity and extent.\n        Note that no direct support\
    \ will be given to end users; they\n        are expected to contact their system\
    \ administrator, network\n        administrator, or department head for assistance.\
    \  The XYZ-CERT\n        will support the latter people.\n        While the XYZ-CERT\
    \ understands that there exists great\n        variation in the level of system\
    \ administrator expertise at XYZ\n        University, and while the XYZ-CERT will\
    \ endeavor to present\n        information and assistance at a level appropriate\
    \ to each\n        person, the XYZ-CERT cannot train system administrators on\
    \ the\n        fly, and it cannot perform system maintenance on their behalf.\n\
    \        In most cases, the XYZ-CERT will provide pointers to the\n        information\
    \ needed to implement appropriate measures.\n        The XYZ-CERT is committed\
    \ to keeping the XYZ University system\n        administration community informed\
    \ of potential vulnerabilities,\n        and where possible, will inform this\
    \ community of such\n        vulnerabilities before they are actively exploited.\n\
    \   4.2 Co-operation, Interaction and Disclosure of Information\n        While\
    \ there are legal and ethical restrictions on the flow of\n        information\
    \ from XYZ-CERT, many of which are also outlined in\n        the XYZ University\
    \ Policy on Computing Facilities, and all of\n        which will be respected,\
    \ the XYZ-CERT acknowledges its\n        indebtedness to, and declares its intention\
    \ to contribute to,\n        the spirit of cooperation that created the Internet.\n\
    \        Therefore, while appropriate measures will be taken to protect\n    \
    \    the identity of members of our constituency and members of\n        neighbouring\
    \ sites where necessary, the XYZ-CERT will otherwise\n        share information\
    \ freely when this will assist others in\n        resolving or preventing security\
    \ incidents.\n        In the paragraphs below, \"affected parties\" refers to\
    \ the\n        legitimate owners, operators, and users of the relevant\n     \
    \   computing facilities.  It does not refer to unauthorized\n        users, including\
    \ otherwise authorized users making\n        unauthorized use of a facility; such\
    \ intruders may have no\n        expectation of confidentiality from the XYZ-CERT.\
    \  They may or\n        may not have legal rights to confidentiality; such rights\
    \ will\n        of course be respected where they exist.\n        Information\
    \ being considered for release will be classified as\n        follows:\n     \
    \     - Private user information is information about particular\n           \
    \ users, or in some cases, particular applications, which\n            must be\
    \ considered confidential for legal, contractual,\n            and/or ethical\
    \ reasons.\n            Private user information will be not be released in\n\
    \            identifiable form outside the XYZ-CERT, except as provided\n    \
    \        for below.  If the identity of the user is disguised, then\n        \
    \    the information can be released freely (for example to show\n           \
    \ a sample .cshrc file as modified by an intruder, or to\n            demonstrate\
    \ a particular social engineering attack).\n          - Intruder information is\
    \ similar to private user\n            information, but concerns intruders.\n\
    \            While intruder information, and in particular identifying\n     \
    \       information, will not be released to the public (unless it\n         \
    \   becomes a  matter of public record, for example because\n            criminal\
    \ charges have been laid), it will be exchanged\n            freely with system\
    \ administrators and CSIRTs tracking an\n            incident.\n          - Private\
    \ site information is technical information about\n            particular systems\
    \ or sites.\n            It will not be released without the permission of the\
    \ site\n            in question, except as provided for below.\n          - Vulnerability\
    \ information is technical information about\n            vulnerabilities or attacks,\
    \ including fixes and\n            workarounds.\n            Vulnerability information\
    \ will be released freely, though\n            every effort will be made to inform\
    \ the relevant vendor\n            before the general public is informed.\n  \
    \        - Embarrassing information includes the statement that an\n         \
    \   incident has occurred, and information about its extent or\n            severity.\
    \  Embarrassing information may concern a site or\n            a particular user\
    \ or group of users.\n            Embarrassing information will not be released\
    \ without the\n            permission of the site or users in question, except\
    \ as\n            provided for below.\n          - Statistical information is\
    \ embarrassing information with\n            the identifying information stripped\
    \ off.\n            Statistical information will be released at the discretion\n\
    \            of the Computing Services Department.\n          - Contact information\
    \ explains how to reach system\n            administrators and CSIRTs.\n     \
    \       Contact information will be released freely, except where\n          \
    \  the contact person or entity has requested that this not\n            be the\
    \ case, or where XYZ-CERT has reason to believe that\n            the dissemination\
    \ of this information would not be\n            appreciated.\n        Potential\
    \ recipients of information from the XYZ-CERT will be\n        classified as follows:\n\
    \        - Because of the nature of their responsibilities and\n          consequent\
    \ expectations of confidentiality, members of XYZ\n          University management\
    \ are entitled to receive whatever\n          information is necessary to facilitate\
    \ the handling of\n          computer security incidents which occur in their\n\
    \          jurisdictions.\n        - Members of the Office of Rights and Responsibilities\
    \ are\n          entitled to receive whatever information they request\n     \
    \     concerning a computer security incident or related matter\n          which\
    \ has been referred to them for resolution.  The same is\n          true for the\
    \ XYZ Security Department, when its assistance in\n          an investigation\
    \ has been enlisted, or when the investigation\n          has been instigated\
    \ at its request.\n        - System administrators at XYZ University who are members\
    \ of\n          the CCSA are also, by virtue of their responsibilities,\n    \
    \      trusted with confidential information.  However, unless such\n        \
    \  people are also members of XYZ-CERT, they will be given only\n          that\
    \ confidential information which they must have in order\n          to assist\
    \ with an investigation, or in order to secure their\n          own systems.\n\
    \        - Users at XYZ University are entitled to information which\n       \
    \   pertains to the security of their own computer accounts,\n          even if\
    \ this means revealing \"intruder information\", or\n          \"embarrassing\
    \ information\" about another user.  For\n          example, if account aaaa is\
    \ cracked and the intruder attacks\n          account bbbb, user bbbb is entitled\
    \ to know that aaaa was\n          cracked, and how the attack on the bbbb account\
    \ was\n          executed.  User bbbb is also entitled, if she or he requests\n\
    \          it, to information about account aaaa which might enable\n        \
    \  bbbb to investigate the attack.  For example, if bbbb was\n          attacked\
    \ by someone remotely connected to aaaa, bbbb should\n          be told the provenance\
    \ of the connections to aaaa, even\n          though this information would ordinarily\
    \ be considered\n          private to aaaa.  Users at XYZ University are entitled\
    \ to be\n          notified if their account is believed to have been\n      \
    \    compromised.\n        - The XYZ University community will receive no restricted\n\
    \          information, except where the affected parties have given\n       \
    \   permission for the information to be disseminated.\n          Statistical\
    \ information may be made available to the general\n          XYZ community. \
    \ There is no obligation on the part of the\n          XYZ-CERT to report incidents\
    \ to the community, though it may\n          choose to do so; in particular, it\
    \ is likely that the\n          XYZ-CERT will inform all affected parties of the\
    \ ways in\n          which they were affected, or will encourage the affected\
    \ site\n          to do so.\n        - The public at large will receive no restricted\
    \ information.\n          In fact, no particular effort will be made to communicate\n\
    \          with the public at large, though the XYZ-CERT recognizes\n        \
    \  that, for all intents and purposes, information made\n          available to\
    \ the XYZ University community is in effect made\n          available to the community\
    \ at large, and will tailor the\n          information in consequence.\n     \
    \   - The computer security community will be treated the same way\n         \
    \ the general public is treated.  While members of XYZ-CERT may\n          participate\
    \ in discussions within the computer security\n          community, such as newsgroups,\
    \ mailing lists (including the\n          full-disclosure list \"bugtraq\"), and\
    \ conferences, they will\n          treat such forums as though they were the\
    \ public at large.\n          While technical issues (including vulnerabilities)\
    \ may be\n          discussed to any level of detail, any examples taken from\n\
    \          XYZ-CERT experience will be disguised to avoid identifying\n      \
    \    the affected parties.\n        - The press will also be considered as part\
    \ of the general\n          public.  The XYZ-CERT will not interact directly with\
    \ the\n          Press concerning computer security incidents, except to point\n\
    \          them toward information already released to the general\n         \
    \ public.  If necessary, information will be provided to the\n          XYZ University\
    \ Public Relations Department, and to the\n          Customer Relations group\
    \ of the Computing Services\n          Department.  All incident-related queries\
    \ will be referred to\n          these two bodies.  The above does not affect\
    \ the ability of\n          members of XYZ-CERT to grant interviews on general\
    \ computer\n          security topics; in fact, they are encouraged to do to,\
    \ as a\n          public service to the community.\n        - Other sites and\
    \ CSIRTs, when they are partners in the\n          investigation of a computer\
    \ security incident, will in some\n          cases be trusted with confidential\
    \ information.  This will\n          happen only if the foreign site's bona fide\
    \ can be verified,\n          and the information transmitted will be limited\
    \ to that which\n          is likely to be helpful in resolving the incident.\
    \  Such\n          information sharing is most likely to happen in the case of\n\
    \          sites well known to XYZ-CERT (for example, several other\n        \
    \  Quebec universities have informal but well-established\n          working relationships\
    \ with XYZ University in such matters).\n          For the purposes of resolving\
    \ a security incident, otherwise\n          semi-private but relatively harmless\
    \ user information such as\n          the provenance of connections to user accounts\
    \ will not be\n          considered highly sensitive, and can be transmitted to\
    \ a\n          foreign site without excessive precautions.  \"Intruder\n     \
    \     information\" will be transmitted freely to other system\n          administrators\
    \ and CSIRTs.  \"Embarrassing information\" can be\n          transmitted when\
    \ there is reasonable assurance that it will\n          remain confidential, and\
    \ when it is necessary to resolve an\n          incident.\n        - Vendors will\
    \ be considered as foreign CSIRTs for most intents\n          and purposes.  The\
    \ XYZ-CERT wishes to encourage vendors of\n          all kinds of networking and\
    \ computer equipment, software, and\n          services to improve the security\
    \ of their products.  In aid\n          of this, a vulnerability discovered in\
    \ such a product will be\n          reported to its vendor, along with all technical\
    \ details\n          needed to identify and fix the problem.  Identifying details\n\
    \          will not be given to the vendor without the permission of the\n   \
    \       affected parties.\n        - Law enforcement officers will receive full\
    \ cooperation from\n          the XYZ-CERT, including any information they require\
    \ to\n          pursue an investigation, in accordance with the Policy on\n  \
    \        Computing Facilities.\n   4.3 Communication and Authentication\n    \
    \    In view of the types of information that the XYZ-CERT will\n        likely\
    \ be dealing with, telephones will be considered\n        sufficiently secure\
    \ to be used even unencrypted.  Unencrypted\n        e-mail will not be considered\
    \ particularly secure, but will be\n        sufficient for the transmission of\
    \ low-sensitivity data.  If\n        it is necessary to send highly sensitive\
    \ data by e-mail, PGP\n        will be used.  Network file transfers will be considered\
    \ to\n        be similar to e-mail for these purposes: sensitive data should\n\
    \        be encrypted for transmission.\n        Where it is necessary to establish\
    \ trust, for example before\n        relying on information given to the XYZ-CERT,\
    \ or before\n        disclosing confidential information, the identity and bona\n\
    \        fide of the other party will be ascertained to a reasonable\n       \
    \ degree of trust.  Within XYZ University, and with known\n        neighbor sites,\
    \ referrals from known trusted people will\n        suffice to identify someone.\
    \  Otherwise, appropriate methods\n        will be used, such as a search of FIRST\
    \ members, the use of\n        WHOIS and other Internet registration information,\
    \ etc, along\n        with telephone call-back or e-mail mail-back to ensure that\n\
    \        the party is not an impostor.  Incoming e-mail whose data must\n    \
    \    be trusted will be checked with the originator personally, or\n        by\
    \ means of digital signatures (PGP in particular is\n        supported).\n   5.\
    \ Services\n   5.1 Incident Response\n        XYZ-CERT will assist system administrators\
    \ in handling the\n        technical and organizational aspects of incidents.\
    \  In\n        particular, it will provide assistance or advice with respect\n\
    \        to the following aspects of incident management:\n   5.1.1 Incident Triage\n\
    \            - Investigating whether indeed an incident occured.\n           \
    \ - Determining the extent of the incident.\n   5.1.2 Incident Coordination\n\
    \            - Determining the initial cause of the incident\n              (vulnerability\
    \ exploited).\n            - Facilitating contact with other sites which may be\n\
    \              involved.\n            - Facilitating contact with XYZ University\
    \ Security and/or\n              appropriate law enforcement officials, if necessary.\n\
    \            - Making reports to other CSIRTs.\n            - Composing announcements\
    \ to users, if applicable.\n   5.1.3 Incident Resolution\n            - Removing\
    \ the vulnerability.\n            - Securing the system from the effects of the\
    \ incident.\n            - Evaluating whether certain actions are likely to reap\n\
    \              results in proportion to their cost and risk, in\n            \
    \  particular those actions aimed at an eventual prosecution\n              or\
    \ disciplinary action: collection of evidence after the\n              fact, observation\
    \ of an incident in progress, setting\n              traps for intruders, etc.\n\
    \            - Collecting evidence where criminal prosecution, or\n          \
    \    University disciplinary action, is contemplated.\n        In addition, XYZ-CERT\
    \ will collect statistics concerning\n        incidents which occur within or\
    \ involve the XYZ University\n        community, and will notify the community\
    \ as necessary to\n        assist it in protecting against known attacks.\n  \
    \      To make use of XYZ-CERT's incident response services, please\n        send\
    \ e-mail as per section 2.11 above.  Please remember that\n        the amount\
    \ of assistance available will vary according to\n        the parameters described\
    \ in section 4.1.\n   5.2 Proactive Activities\n        The XYZ-CERT coordinates\
    \ and maintains the following\n        services to the extent possible depending\
    \ on its resources:\n          - Information services\n             - List of\
    \ departmental security contacts, administrative\n               and technical.\
    \  These lists will be available to the\n               general public, via commonly-available\
    \ channels such as\n               the World Wide Web and/or the Domain Name Service.\n\
    \             - Mailing lists to inform security contacts of new\n           \
    \    information relevant to their computing environments.\n               These\
    \ lists will be available only to XYZ University\n               system administrators.\n\
    \             - Repository of vendor-provided and other security-related\n   \
    \            patches for various operating systems.  This repository\n       \
    \        will be available to the general public wherever\n               license\
    \ restrictions allow it, and will be provided via\n               commonly-available\
    \ channels such as the World Wide Web\n               and/or ftp.\n          \
    \   - Repository of security tools and documentation for\n               use by\
    \ sysadmins.  Where possible, precompiled\n               ready-to-install versions\
    \ will be supplied.  These will\n               be supplied to the general public\
    \ via www or ftp as\n               above.\n             - \"Clipping\" service\
    \ for various existing resources, such\n               as major mailing lists\
    \ and newsgroups.  The resulting\n               clippings will be made available\
    \ either on the\n               restricted mailing list or on the web site, depending\n\
    \               on their sensitivity and urgency.\n          - Training services\n\
    \             - Members of the XYZ-CERT will give periodic seminars on\n     \
    \          computer security related topics; these seminars will\n           \
    \    be open to XYZ University system administrators.\n          - Auditing services\n\
    \             - Central file integrity checking service for Unix\n           \
    \    machines, and for any other platforms capable of\n               running\
    \ \"tripwire\".\n             - Security level assignments; machines and subnetworks\n\
    \               at XYZ University will be audited and assigned a\n           \
    \    security level.  This security level information will be\n              \
    \ available to the XYZ University community, to facilitate\n               the\
    \ setting of appropriate access privileges.  However,\n               details\
    \ of the security analyses will be confidential,\n               and available\
    \ only to the concerned parties.\n          - Archiving services\n           \
    \  - Central logging service for machines capable of\n               Unix-style\
    \ remote logging.  Incoming log entries will\n               be watched by an\
    \ automated log analysis program, and\n               events or trends indicative\
    \ of a potential security\n               problem will be reported to the affected\
    \ system\n               administrators.\n             - Records of security incidents\
    \ handled will be kept.\n               While the records will remain confidential,\
    \ periodic\n               statistical reports will be made available to the XYZ\n\
    \               University community.\n        Detailed descriptions of the above\
    \ services, along with\n        instructions for joining mailing lists, downloading\n\
    \        information, or participating in certain services such as the\n     \
    \   central logging and file integrity checking services, are\n        available\
    \ on the XYZ-CERT web site, as per section 2.10\n        above.\n   6. Incident\
    \ Reporting Forms\n        There are no local forms developed yet for reporting\
    \ incidents\n        to XYZ-CERT. If possible, please make use of the Incident\n\
    \        Reporting Form of the CERT Coordination Center (Pittsburgh,\n       \
    \ PA).  The current version is available from:\n           ftp://info.cert.org/incident_reporting_form\n\
    \   7. Disclaimers\n        While every precaution will be taken in the preparation\
    \ of\n        information, notifications and alerts, XYZ-CERT assumes no\n   \
    \     responsibility for errors or omissions, or for damages\n        resulting\
    \ from the use of the information contained within.\n"

  - "6 Security Considerations\n   This document discusses the operation of Computer\
    \ Security Incident\n   Response Teams, and the teams' interactions with their\
    \ constituencies\n   and with other organizations.  It is, therefore, not directly\n\
    \   concerned with the security of protocols, applications, or network\n   systems\
    \ themselves.  It is not even concerned with particular\n   responses and reactions\
    \ to security incidents, but only with the\n   appropriate description of the\
    \ responses provided by CSIRTs.\n   Nonetheless, it is vital that the CSIRTs themselves\
    \ operate securely,\n   which means that they must establish secure communication\
    \ channels\n   with other teams, and with members of their constituency.  They\
    \ must\n   also secure their own systems and infrastructure, to protect the\n\
    \   interests of their constituency and to maintain the confidentiality\n   of\
    \ the identity of victims and reporters of security incidents.\n"
