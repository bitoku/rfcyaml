- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   SEND [RFC3971] uses the SHA-1 hash algorithm [SHA1] to generate\
    \ the\n   contents of the Key Hash field and the Digital Signature field of the\n\
    \   RSA Signature option.  It also indirectly uses a hash algorithm\n   (SHA-1,\
    \ MD5, etc.) in the PKIX certificates [RFC5280] used for router\n   authorization\
    \ in the Authorization Delegation Discovery (ADD)\n   process.  Recently there\
    \ have been demonstrated attacks against the\n   collision free property of such\
    \ hash functions [SHA1-COLL] and\n   attacks on the PKIX X.509 certificates that\
    \ use the MD5 hash\n   algorithm [X509-COLL].  The document analyzes the impacts\
    \ of these\n   attacks on SEND and it recommends mechanisms to make SEND resistant\n\
    \   to such attacks.\n"
- title: 2.  Impact of Collision Attacks on SEND
  contents:
  - "2.  Impact of Collision Attacks on SEND\n   [RFC4270] summarizes a study that\
    \ assesses the threat of the\n   aforementioned attacks on the use of cryptographic\
    \ hashes in Internet\n   protocols.  This document analyzes the hash usage in\
    \ SEND following\n   the approach recommended by [RFC4270] and [NEW-HASHES].\n\
    \   The following sections discuss the various aspects of hash usage in\n   SEND\
    \ and determine whether they are affected by the attacks on the\n   underlying\
    \ hash functions.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Attacks against CGAs Used in SEND
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Attacks against CGAs Used in SEND\n   Cryptographically Generated Addresses\
    \ (CGAs) are defined in [RFC3972]\n   and are used to securely associate a cryptographic\
    \ public key with an\n   IPv6 address in the SEND protocol.  Impacts of collision\
    \ attacks on\n   current uses of CGAs are analyzed in [RFC4982].  The basic idea\n\
    \   behind collision attacks, as described in Section 4 of [RFC4270], is\n   on\
    \ the non-repudiation feature of hash algorithms.  However, CGAs do\n   not provide\
    \ non-repudiation features.  Therefore, as [RFC4982] points\n   out CGA-based\
    \ protocols, including SEND, are not affected by\n   collision attacks on hash\
    \ functions.  If pre-image attacks were to\n   become feasible, an attacker can\
    \ find new CGA Parameters that can\n   generate the same CGA as the victim.  This\
    \ class of attacks could be\n   potentially dangerous since the security of SEND\
    \ messages relies on\n   the strength of the CGA.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Attacks against PKIX Certificates in Authorization Delegation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Attacks against PKIX Certificates in Authorization Delegation\n      Discovery\
    \ Process\n   To protect Router Discovery, SEND requires that routers be authorized\n\
    \   to act as routers.  Routers are authorized by provisioning them with\n   certificates\
    \ from a trust anchor, and the hosts are configured with\n   the trust anchor(s)\
    \ used to authorize routers.  Researchers\n   demonstrated attacks against PKIX\
    \ certificates with MD5 signatures in\n   2005 [NEW-HASHES], in 2007 [X509-COLL]\
    \ [STEV2007] [SLdeW2007], and in\n   2009 [SSALMOdeW2009] [SLdeW2009].  An attacker\
    \ can take advantage of\n   these vulnerabilities to obtain a certificate with\
    \ a different\n   identity and use the certificate to impersonate a router.  For\
    \ this\n   attack to succeed, the attacker needs to predict the content of all\n\
    \   fields (some of them are human-readable) appearing before the public\n   key,\
    \ including the serial number and validity periods.  Even though a\n   relying\
    \ party cannot verify the content of these fields, the CA can\n   identify the\
    \ forged certificate, if necessary.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Attacks against the Digital Signature in the SEND RSA Signature
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Attacks against the Digital Signature in the SEND RSA Signature\n     \
    \ Option\n   The digital signature in the RSA Signature option is produced by\n\
    \   signing, with the sender's private key, the SHA-1 hash over certain\n   fields\
    \ in the Neighbor Discovery message as described in Section 5.2\n   of [RFC3971].\
    \  It is possible for an attacker to come up with two\n   different Neighbor Discovery\
    \ messages m and m' that result in the\n   same value in the Digital Signature\
    \ field.  Since the structure of\n   the Neighbor Discovery messages is well defined,\
    \ it is not practical\n   to use this vulnerability in real world attacks.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Attacks against the Key Hash Field of the SEND RSA Signature
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Attacks against the Key Hash Field of the SEND RSA Signature\n      Option\n\
    \   The SEND RSA signature option described in Section 5.2 of [RFC3971]\n   defines\
    \ a Key Hash field.  This field contains a SHA-1 hash of the\n   public key that\
    \ was used to generate the CGA.  To use a collision\n   attack on this field,\
    \ the attacker needs to come up with another\n   public key (k') that produces\
    \ the same hash as the real key (k).  But\n   the real key (k) is already authorized\
    \ through a parallel mechanism\n   (either CGAs or router certificates).  Hence,\
    \ collision attacks are\n   not possible on the Key Hash field.  Pre-image attacks\
    \ on the Key\n   Hash field are not useful for the same reason (any other key\
    \ that\n   hashes into the same Key Hash value will be detected due to a\n   mismatch\
    \ with the CGA or the router certificate).\n"
- title: 3.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "3.  Conclusion\n   Current attacks on hash functions do not constitute any practical\n\
    \   threat to the digital signatures used in SEND (both in the RSA\n   signature\
    \ option and in the X.509 certificates).  Attacks on CGAs, as\n   described in\
    \ [RFC4982], will compromise the security of SEND and they\n   need to be addressed\
    \ by encoding the hash algorithm information into\n   the CGA as specified in\
    \ [RFC4982].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document analyzes the impact that the attacks\
    \ against hash\n   functions have on SEND.  It concludes that the only practical\
    \ attack\n   on SEND stems from a successful attack on an underlying CGA.  It\
    \ does\n   not add any new vulnerabilities to SEND.\n"
