    \  This document illustrates some use cases for\n   SPRING / Segment Routing in\

  - "2.  IPv6 SPRING Use Cases\n   The use cases described in this section do not\
    \ constitute an\n   exhaustive list of all the possible scenarios: this section\
    \ only\n   includes some of the most common envisioned deployment models for\n\
    \   Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6).\n   In addition to the use cases described\
    \ in this document, all the\n   SPRING use cases [RFC7855] are also applicable\
    \ to the SRv6 data\n   plane.\n"
- title: 2.1.  SPRING in the Small Office
  contents:
  - "2.1.  SPRING in the Small Office\n   An IPv6-enabled Small Office, Home Office\
    \ (SOHO) provides ample\n   globally routed IP addresses for all devices in the\
    \ SOHO.  An IPv6\n   small office with multiple egress points and associated provider-\n\
    \   assigned prefixes will, in turn, provide multiple IPv6 addresses to\n   hosts.\
    \  A small office performing source and destination routing\n   [PA-MULTIHOMING]\
    \ will ensure that packets exit the SOHO at the\n   appropriate egress based on\
    \ the associated delegated prefix for that\n   link.\n   A SPRING-enabled SOHO\
    \ provides the ability to steer traffic into a\n   specific path from end hosts\
    \ in the SOHO or from a customer edge\n   router in the SOHO.  If the selection\
    \ of the source-routed path is\n   enabled at the customer edge router, that router\
    \ is responsible for\n   classifying traffic and steering it into the correct\
    \ path.  If hosts\n   in the SOHO have explicit source selection rules, classification\
    \ can\n   be based on the source address or associated network egress point,\n\
    \   thus avoiding the need for implicit classification techniques based\n   on\
    \ Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).  If the traffic is steered into a\n   specific\
    \ path by the host itself, it is important to know which\n   networks can interpret\
    \ the SPRING header.  This information can be\n   provided as part of the host\
    \ configuration as a property of the\n   configured IP address.\n   The ability\
    \ to steer traffic to an appropriate egress or utilize a\n   specific type of\
    \ media (e.g., low power, Wi-Fi, wired, femtocell,\n   Bluetooth, Multimedia over\
    \ Coax Alliance (MoCA), HomePlug, etc.)\n   within the home itself are obvious\
    \ cases that may be of interest to\n   an application running within a SOHO.\n\
    \   Steering to a specific egress point may be useful for a number of\n   scenarios,\
    \ including:\n   o  regulatory compliance;\n   o  performance of a particular\
    \ service associated with a particular\n      link;\n   o  cost imposed due to\
    \ data caps or per-byte charges;\n   o  distinguishing between personal vs. work\
    \ traffic in homes with one\n      or more teleworkers; and\n   o  provision of\
    \ specific services by one ISP vs. another.\n   Information included in the SPRING\
    \ header, whether imposed by the end\n   host itself, a customer edge router,\
    \ or within the access network of\n   the ISP, may be of use at the far ends of\
    \ the data communication as\n   well.  For example, an application running on\
    \ an end host with\n   application support in a data center can utilize the SPRING\
    \ header as\n   a channel to include information that affects its treatment within\n\
    \   the data center itself, which allows for application-level steering\n   and\
    \ load balancing without relying upon implicit application-\n   classification\
    \ techniques at the edge of the data center.  Further,\n   as more and more application\
    \ traffic is encrypted, the ability to\n   extract (and include in the SPRING\
    \ header) just enough information to\n   enable the network and data center to\
    \ load balance and steer traffic\n   appropriately becomes more and more important.\n"
- title: 2.2.  SPRING in the Access Network
  contents:
  - "2.2.  SPRING in the Access Network\n   Access networks deliver a variety of types\
    \ of traffic from the\n   service provider's network to the home environment and\
    \ from the home\n   towards the service provider's network.\n   For bandwidth\
    \ management or related purposes, the service provider\n   may want to associate\
    \ certain types of traffic to specific physical\n   or logical downstream capacity\
    \ pipes.\n   This mapping is not the same thing as classification and scheduling.\n\
    \   In the cable access network, these pipes are represented at the Data-\n  \
    \ Over-Cable Service Interface Specification [DOCSIS] layer as\n   different service\
    \ flows, which are better identified as distinct data\n   links.  As such, creating\
    \ this separation allows an operator to\n   differentiate between different types\
    \ of content and perform a\n   variety of differing functions on these pipes,\
    \ such as byte capping,\n   regulatory compliance functions, and billing.\n  \
    \ In a cable operator's environment, these downstream pipes could be a\n   DOCSIS\
    \ [DOCSIS] service flow, a service group, or a specific\n   Quadrature Amplitude\
    \ Modulation (QAM) as in Annex B of [ITU.J83].\n   Similarly, the operator may\
    \ want to map traffic from the home sent\n   towards the service provider's network\
    \ to specific upstream capacity\n   pipes.  Information carried in a packet's\
    \ SPRING header could provide\n   the target pipe for this specific packet.  The\
    \ access device would\n   not need to know specific details about the packet to\
    \ perform this\n   mapping; instead, the access device would only need to know\
    \ the\n   interpretation of the SPRING header and how to map it to the target\n\
    \   pipe.\n"
- title: 2.3.  SPRING in Data Center
  contents:
  - "2.3.  SPRING in Data Center\n   Some data center operators are transitioning\
    \ their data center\n   infrastructure from IPv4 to native IPv6 only, in order\
    \ to cope with\n   IPv4 address depletion and to achieve larger scale.  In such\
    \ an\n   environment, source routing (as enabled by SRv6) can be used to steer\n\
    \   traffic across specific paths through the network.  The specific path\n  \
    \ may also include a given function that one or more nodes in the path\n   are\
    \ requested to perform.\n   Additionally, one of the fundamental requirements\
    \ for data center\n   architecture is to provide scalable, isolated tenant networks.\
    \  In\n   such scenarios, Segment Routing can be used to build a construct to\n\
    \   steer the traffic across that specific path and to identify specific\n   nodes,\
    \ tenants, and functions.\n"
- title: 2.4.  SPRING in Content Delivery Networks
  contents:
  - "2.4.  SPRING in Content Delivery Networks\n   The rise of online video applications\
    \ and new, video-capable IP\n   devices has led to an explosion of video traffic\
    \ traversing network\n   operator infrastructures.  In the drive to reduce the\
    \ capital and\n   operational impact of the massive influx of online video traffic,\
    \ as\n   well as to extend traditional TV services to new devices and screens,\n\
    \   network operators are increasingly turning to Content Delivery\n   Networks\
    \ (CDNs).\n   Several studies showed the benefits of connecting caches in a\n\
    \   hierarchical structure following the hierarchical nature of the\n   Internet.\
    \  In a cache hierarchy, one cache establishes peering\n   relationships with\
    \ its neighbor caches.  There are two types of\n   relationships: parent and sibling.\
    \  A parent cache is essentially one\n   level up in a cache hierarchy.  A sibling\
    \ cache is on the same level.\n   Multiple levels of hierarchy are commonly used\
    \ in order to build an\n   efficient cache architecture.\n   In an environment\
    \ where each single cache system can be uniquely\n   identified by its own IPv6\
    \ address, a list containing a sequence of\n   the caches in a hierarchy can be\
    \ built.  At each node (cache) in the\n   list, the presence of the requested\
    \ content is checked.  If the\n   requested content is found at the cache (a cache\
    \ hits scenario), the\n   sequence ends even if there are more nodes in the list;\
    \ otherwise,\n   the next element in the list (the next node/cache) is examined.\n"
- title: 2.5.  SPRING in Core Networks
  contents:
  - "2.5.  SPRING in Core Networks\n   While the overall amount of traffic offered\
    \ to the network continues\n   to grow, and considering that multiple types of\
    \ traffic with\n   different characteristics and requirements are quickly converging\n\
    \   over a single network architecture, the network operators are\n   starting\
    \ to face new challenges.\n   Some operators are currently building, or plan to\
    \ build in the near\n   future, an IPv6-only native infrastructure for their core\
    \ network.\n   These operators are also looking at the possibility to set up an\n\
    \   explicit path based on the IPv6 source address for specific types of\n   traffic\
    \ in order to efficiently use their network infrastructure.  In\n   the case of\
    \ IPv6, some operators are currently assigning or plan to\n   assign IPv6 prefix(es)\
    \ to their IPv6 customers based on regions/\n   geography, thus the subscriber's\
    \ IPv6 prefix could be used to\n   identify the region where the customer is located.\
    \  In such an\n   environment, the IPv6 source address could be used by the edge\
    \ nodes\n   of the network to steer traffic and forward it through a specific\n\
    \   path other than the optimal path.\n   The need to set up a source-based path\
    \ that goes through some\n   specific middle/intermediate points in the network\
    \ may be related to\n   different requirements:\n   o  The operator may want to\
    \ be able to use some high-bandwidth links\n      for a specific type of traffic\
    \ (like video) and thus avoid the\n      need for overdimensioning all the links\
    \ of the network;\n   o  The operator may want to be able to set up a specific\
    \ path for\n      delay-sensitive applications;\n   o  The operator may have the\
    \ need to be able to select one (or\n      multiple) specific exit point(s) at\
    \ peering points when different\n      peering points are available;\n   o  The\
    \ operator may have the need to be able to set up a source-based\n      path for\
    \ specific services in order to be able to reach some\n      servers hosted in\
    \ some facilities that are not always reachable\n      through the optimal path;\
    \ or\n   o  The operator may need to be able to provision guaranteed disjoint\n\
    \      paths (a so-called \"dual-plane network\") for diversity purposes.\n  \
    \ All these scenarios would require a form of traffic engineering\n   capabilities\
    \ in an IPv6-only network environment.\n"
