  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3168], a Proposed Standard document, defines the ECN\
    \ field in the\n   IP header, and specifies the semantics for the codepoints for\
    \ the ECN\n   field.  However, end nodes could specify the use of alternate\n\
    \   semantics for the ECN field, e.g., using codepoints in the diffserv\n   field\
    \ of the IP header.\n   There have been a number of proposals in the IETF and\
    \ in the research\n   community for alternate semantics for the ECN codepoint.\
    \  One such\n   proposal, [BCF05], proposes alternate ECN semantics for real-time\n\
    \   inelastic traffic such as voice, video conferencing, and multimedia\n   streaming\
    \ in DiffServ networks.  In this proposal, the alternate ECN\n   semantics would\
    \ provide information about two levels of congestion\n   experienced along the\
    \ path [BCF05].  Another research proposal,\n   [XSSK05], proposes a low-complexity\
    \ protocol, Variable-structure\n   congestion Control Protocol (VCP), that uses\
    \ the two bits in the ECN\n   field to indicate low-load, high-load, and overload\
    \ (congestion),\n   where transport protocols can increase more rapidly during\
    \ the low-\n   load regime.  Some of the proposals for alternate ECN semantics\
    \ are\n   for when ECN is used in an edge-to-edge context between gateways at\n\
    \   the edge of a network region, e.g., for pre-congestion notification\n   for\
    \ admissions control [BESFC06].  Other proposals for alternate ECN\n   semantics\
    \ are listed on the ECN Web Page [ECN].\n   The definition of multiple semantics\
    \ for the ECN field could have\n   significant implications on both host and router\
    \ implementations.\n   There is a huge base of installed hosts and routers in\
    \ the Internet,\n   and in other IP networks, and updating these is an enormous\
    \ and\n   potentially expensive undertaking.  Some existing devices might be\n\
    \   able to support the new ECN semantics with only a software upgrade\n   and\
    \ without significant degradation in performance.  Some other\n   equipment might\
    \ be able to support the new semantics, but with a\n   degradation in performance\
    \ -- which could range from trivial to\n   catastrophic.  Some other deployed\
    \ equipment might be able to support\n   the new ECN semantics only with a hardware\
    \ upgrade, which, in some\n   cases, could be prohibitively expensive to deploy\
    \ on a very wide\n   scale.  For these reasons, it would be difficult and would\
    \ take a\n   significant amount of time to universally deploy any new ECN\n  \
    \ semantics.  In particular, routers can be difficult to upgrade, since\n   small\
    \ routers sometimes are not updated frequently, and large routers\n   commonly\
    \ have specialized forwarding paths to facilitate high\n   performance.\n   This\
    \ document describes some of the technical issues that arise in\n   specifying\
    \ alternate semantics for the ECN field, and gives\n   requirements for a safe\
    \ coexistence in a world using the default ECN\n   semantics (or using no ECN\
    \ at all).\n"
- title: 2.  An Overview of the Issues
  contents:
  - "2.  An Overview of the Issues\n   In this section, we discuss some of the issues\
    \ that arise if some of\n   the traffic in a network consists of alternate-ECN\
    \ traffic (i.e.,\n   traffic using alternate semantics for the ECN field).  The\
    \ issues\n   include the following: (1) how routers know which ECN semantics to\n\
    \   use with which packets; (2) incremental deployment in a network where\n  \
    \ some routers use only the default ECN semantics or do not use ECN at\n   all;\
    \ (3) coexistence of alternate-ECN traffic with competing traffic\n   on the path;\
    \ and (4) a general evaluation of the alternate ECN\n   semantics.\n   (1) The\
    \ first issue concerns how routers know which ECN semantics to\n       use with\
    \ which packets in the network:\n       How does the connection indicate to the\
    \ router that its packets\n       are using alternate ECN semantics?  Is the specification\
    \ of\n       alternate-ECN semantics robust and unambiguous?  If not, is this\n\
    \       a problem?\n       As an example, in most of the proposals for alternate\
    \ ECN\n       semantics, a diffserv field is used to specify the use of\n    \
    \   alternate ECN semantics.  Do all routers that understand this\n       diffserv\
    \ codepoint understand that it uses alternate ECN\n       semantics, or not? \
    \ Diffserv allows routers to re-mark DiffServ\n       Code Point (DSCP) values\
    \ within the network; what is the effect\n       of this on the alternate ECN\
    \ semantics?\n       This is discussed in more detail in Section 3 below.\n  \
    \ (2) A second issue is that of incremental deployment in a network\n       where\
    \ some routers only use the default ECN semantics, and other\n       routers might\
    \ not use ECN at all.  In this document, we use the\n       phrase \"new routers\"\
    \ to refer to the routers that understand the\n       alternate ECN semantics,\
    \ and \"old routers\" to refer to routers\n       that don't understand or aren't\
    \ willing to use the alternate ECN\n       semantics.\n       The possible existence\
    \ of old routers raises the following\n       question:  How does the possible\
    \ presence of old routers affect\n       the performance of the alternate-ECN\
    \ connections?\n   (3) The possible existence of old routers also raises the question\
    \ of\n       how the presence of old routers affects the coexistence of the\n\
    \       alternate-ECN traffic with competing traffic on the path.\n       Issues\
    \ (2) and (3) are discussed in Section 4 below.\n   (4) A final issue is that\
    \ of the general evaluation of the alternate\n       ECN semantics:\n       How\
    \ well does the alternate-ECN traffic perform, and how well\n       does it coexist\
    \ with competing traffic on the path, in a \"clean\"\n       environment with\
    \ new routers and with the unambiguous\n       specification of the use of alternate\
    \ ECN semantics?\n       These issues are discussed in Section 5.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Signalling the Use of Alternate ECN Semantics\n   This section discusses\
    \ question (1) from Section 2:\n   (1) How does the connection indicate to the\
    \ router that its packets\n       are using alternate ECN semantics?  Is the specification\
    \ of\n       alternate ECN semantics robust and unambiguous?  If not, is this\n\
    \       a problem?\n   The assumption of this document is that when alternate\
    \ semantics are\n   defined for the ECN field, a codepoint in the diffserv field\
    \ is used\n   to signal the use of these alternate ECN semantics to the router.\n\
    \   That is, the end host sets the codepoint in the diffserv field to\n   indicate\
    \ to routers that alternate semantics to the ECN field are\n   being used.  Routers\
    \ that understand this diffserv codepoint would\n   know to use the alternate\
    \ semantics for interpreting and setting the\n   ECN field.  Old ECN-capable routers\
    \ that do not understand this\n   diffserv codepoint would use the default ECN\
    \ semantics in\n   interpreting and setting the ECN field.\n   In general, the\
    \ diffserv codepoints are used to signal the per-hop\n   behavior at router queues.\
    \  One possibility would be to use one\n   diffserv codepoint to signal a per-hop\
    \ behavior with the default ECN\n   semantics, and a separate diffserv codepoint\
    \ to signal a similar\n   per-hop behavior with the alternate ECN semantics. \
    \ Another\n   possibility would be to use a diffserv codepoint to signal the use\
    \ of\n   best-effort per-hop queueing and scheduling behavior, but with\n   alternate\
    \ ECN semantics.  A detailed discussion of these issues is\n   beyond the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   We note that this discussion does not exclude the possibility\
    \ of\n   using other methods, including out-of-band mechanisms, for signalling\n\
    \   the use of alternate semantics for the ECN field.  The considerations\n  \
    \ in the rest of this document apply regardless of the method used to\n   signal\
    \ the use of alternate semantics for the ECN field.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Using the Diffserv Field for Signalling
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Using the Diffserv Field for Signalling\n   We note that the default ECN\
    \ semantics defined in RFC 3168 are the\n   current default semantics for the\
    \ ECN field, regardless of the\n   contents of any other fields in the IP header.\
    \  In particular, the\n   default ECN semantics apply for more than best-effort\
    \ traffic with a\n   codepoint of '000000' for the diffserv field - the default\
    \ ECN\n   semantics currently apply regardless of the contents of the diffserv\n\
    \   field.\n   There are two ways to use the diffserv field to signal the use\
    \ of\n   alternate ECN semantics.  One way is to use an existing diffserv\n  \
    \ codepoint, and to modify the current definition of that codepoint,\n   through\
    \ approved IETF processes, to specify the use of alternate ECN\n   semantics with\
    \ that codepoint.  A second way is to define a new\n   diffserv codepoint, and\
    \ to specify the use of alternate ECN semantics\n   with that codepoint.  We note\
    \ that the first of these two mechanisms\n   raises the possibility that some\
    \ routers along the path will\n   understand the diffserv codepoint but will use\
    \ the default ECN\n   semantics with this diffserv codepoint, or won't use ECN\
    \ at all, and\n   that other routers will use the alternate ECN semantics with\
    \ this\n   diffserv codepoint.\n"
- title: 4.  Issues of Incremental Deployment
  contents:
  - "4.  Issues of Incremental Deployment\n   This section discusses questions (2)\
    \ and (3) posed in Section 2:\n   (2) How does the possible presence of old routers\
    \ affect the\n       performance of the alternate-ECN connections?\n   (3) How\
    \ does the possible presence of old routers affect the\n       coexistence of\
    \ the alternate-ECN traffic with competing traffic\n       on the path?\n   When\
    \ alternate semantics are defined for the ECN field, it is\n   necessary to ensure\
    \ that there are no problems caused by old routers\n   along the path that don't\
    \ understand the alternate ECN semantics.\n   One possible problem is that of\
    \ poor performance for the alternate-\n   ECN traffic.  Is it essential to the\
    \ performance of the alternate-ECN\n   traffic that all routers along the path\
    \ understand the alternate ECN\n   semantics?  If not, what are the possible consequences,\
    \ for the\n   alternate-ECN traffic itself, when some old routers along the path\n\
    \   don't understand the alternate ECN semantics?  These issues have to\n   be\
    \ answered in the context of each specific proposal for alternate\n   ECN semantics.\n\
    \   A second specific problem is that of possible unfair competition with\n  \
    \ other traffic along the path.  If there is an old router along the\n   path\
    \ that doesn't use ECN, that old router could drop packets from\n   the alternate-ECN\
    \ traffic, and expect the alternate-ECN traffic to\n   reduce its sending rate\
    \ as a result.  Does the alternate-ECN traffic\n   respond to packet drops as\
    \ an indication of congestion?\n                                  |--------|\n\

    \ ECN traffic ----->  |        | ---> CE-marked packet\n                     \
    \             |--------|\n    Figure 1: Alternate-ECN traffic, an old router,\
    \ using RFC-3168 ECN,\n     that is congested and ready to drop or mark the arriving\
    \ packet.\n   Similarly, what if there is an old router along the path that\n\
    \   understands only the default ECN semantics from RFC 3168, as in\n   Figure\
    \ 1 above?  In times of congestion, the old default-ECN router\n   could see an\
    \ alternate-ECN packet with one of the ECN-Capable\n   Transport (ECT) codepoints\
    \ set in the ECN field in the IP header, as\n   defined in RFC 3168, and set the\
    \ Congestion Experienced (CE)\n   codepoint in the ECN field as an alternative\
    \ to dropping the packet.\n   The router in this case would expect the alternate-ECN\
    \ connection to\n   respond, in terms of congestion control, as it would if the\
    \ packet\n   has been dropped.  If the alternate-ECN traffic fails to respond\n\
    \   appropriately to the CE codepoint being set by an old router, this\n   could\
    \ increase the aggregate traffic arriving at the old router,\n   resulting in\
    \ an increase in the packet-marking and packet-dropping\n   rates at that router,\
    \ further resulting in the alternate-ECN traffic\n   crowding out the other traffic\
    \ competing for bandwidth on that link.\n   Basically, there are three possibilities\
    \ for avoiding scenarios where\n   the presence of old routers along the path\
    \ results in the alternate-\n   ECN traffic competing unfairly with other traffic\
    \ along the path:\n   Option 1:  Alternate-ECN traffic is clearly understood as\
    \ unsafe for\n   deployment in the global Internet; or\n   Option 2:  All alternate-ECN\
    \ traffic deploys some mechanism for\n   verifying that all routers on the path\
    \ understand and agree to use\n   the alternate ECN semantics for this traffic;\
    \ or\n   Option 3:  The alternate ECN semantics are defined in such a way as\n\
    \   to ensure the fair and peaceful coexistence of the alternate-ECN\n   traffic\
    \ with best-effort and other traffic, even in environments that\n   include old\
    \ routers that do not understand the alternate ECN\n   semantics.\n   Each of\
    \ these alternatives is explored in more detail below.\n"
- title: '4.1.  Option 1:  Unsafe for Deployment in the Internet'
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Option 1:  Unsafe for Deployment in the Internet\n   The first option specified\
    \ above is for the alternate-ECN traffic to\n   be clearly understood as only\
    \ suitable for enclosed environments, and\n   as unsafe for deployment in the\
    \ global Internet.  Specifically, this\n   would mean that it would be unsafe\

    \ Internet.  This\n   restriction would prevent the alternate-ECN traffic from\

    \ comment on the chances that this scenario would\n   be considered acceptable\

- title: '4.2.  Option 2:  Verification that Routers Understand the Alternate'
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Option 2:  Verification that Routers Understand the Alternate\n      Semantics\n\
    \   The second option specified above is for the alternate-ECN traffic to\n  \
    \ include a mechanism for ensuring that all routers along the path\n   understand\
    \ and agree to the use of the alternate ECN semantics for\n   this traffic.  As\
    \ an example, such a mechanism could consist of a\n   field in an IP option that\
    \ all routers along the path decrement if\n   they agree to use the alternate\
    \ ECN semantics with this traffic.  (A\n   similar mechanism is proposed for Quick-Start,\
    \ for verifying that all\n   of the routers along the path understand the Quick-Start\
    \ IP Option\n   [QuickStart].)  Using such a mechanism, a sender could have\n\
    \   reasonable assurance that the packets that are sent specifying the\n   use\
    \ of alternate ECN semantics only traverse routers that, in fact,\n   understand\
    \ and agree to use these alternate semantics for these\n   packets.  Note, however,\
    \ that most existing routers are optimized for\n   IP packets with no options,\
    \ or with only some very well-known and\n   simple IP options.  Thus, the definition\
    \ and use of any new IP option\n   may have a serious detrimental effect on the\
    \ performance of many\n   existing IP routers.\n   Such a mechanism should be\
    \ robust in the presence of paths with\n   multi-path routing, and in the presence\
    \ of routing or configuration\n   changes along the path while the connection\
    \ is in use.  In\n   particular, if this option is used, connections could include\
    \ some\n   form of monitoring for changes in path behavior and/or periodic\n \
    \  monitoring that all routers along the path continue to understand the\n   alternate\
    \ ECN semantics.\n"
- title: '4.3.  Option 3:  Friendly Coexistence with Competing Traffic'
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Option 3:  Friendly Coexistence with Competing Traffic\n   The third option\
    \ specified above is for the alternate ECN semantics\n   to be defined so that\
    \ traffic using the alternate semantics would\n   coexist safely in the Internet\
    \ on a path with one or more old routers\n   that use only the default ECN semantics.\
    \  In this scenario, a\n   connection sending alternate-ECN traffic would have\
    \ to respond\n   appropriately to a CE packet (a packet with the ECN codepoint\
    \ \"11\")\n   received at the receiver, using a conformant congestion control\n\
    \   response.  Hopefully, the connection sending alternate-ECN traffic\n   would\
    \ also respond appropriately to a dropped packet, which could be\n   a congestion\
    \ indication from a router that doesn't use ECN.\n   RFC 3168 defines the default\
    \ ECN semantics as follows:\n   \"Upon the receipt by an ECN-Capable transport\
    \ of a single CE packet,\n   the congestion control algorithms followed at the\
    \ end-systems MUST be\n   essentially the same as the congestion control response\
    \ to a *single*\n   dropped packet.  For example, for ECN-Capable TCP the source\
    \ TCP is\n   required to halve its congestion window for any window of data\n\
    \   containing either a packet drop or an ECN indication.\"\n   The only conformant\
    \ congestion control mechanisms currently\n   standardized in the IETF are TCP\
    \ [RFC2581] and protocols using TCP-\n   like congestion control (e.g., SCTP [RFC2960],\
    \ DCCP with CCID-2\n   ([RFC4340], [RFC4341])), and TCP-Friendly Rate Control\
    \ (TFRC)\n   [RFC3448], and protocols with TFRC-like congestion control (e.g.,\n\
    \   DCCP using CCID-3 [RFC4342]).  TCP uses Additive-Increase\n   Multiplicative-Decrease\
    \ congestion control, and responds to the loss\n   or ECN-marking of a single\
    \ packet by halving its congestion window.\n   In contrast, the equation-based\
    \ congestion control mechanism in TFRC\n   estimates the loss event rate over\
    \ some period of time, and uses a\n   sending rate that would be comparable, in\
    \ packets per round-trip-\n   time, to that of a TCP connection experiencing the\
    \ same loss event\n   rate.\n   So what are the requirements for alternate-ECN\
    \ traffic to compete\n   appropriately with other traffic on a path through an\
    \ old router that\n   doesn't understand the alternate ECN semantics (and therefore\
    \ might\n   be using the default ECN semantics)?  The first and second\n   requirements\
    \ below concern compatibility between traffic using\n   alternate ECN semantics\
    \ and routers using default ECN semantics.\n   The first requirement for compatibility\
    \ with routers using default\n   ECN is that if a packet is marked with the ECN\
    \ codepoint \"11\" in the\n   network, this marking is not changed on the packet's\
    \ way to the\n   receiver (unless the packet is dropped before it reaches the\n\
    \   receiver).  This requirement is necessary to ensure that congestion\n   indications\
    \ from a default-ECN router make it to the transport\n   receiver.\n   A second\
    \ requirement for compatibility with routers using default ECN\n   is that the\
    \ end-nodes respond to packets that are marked with the ECN\n   codepoint \"11\"\
    \ in a way that is friendly to flows using IETF-\n   conformant congestion control.\
    \  This requirement is needed because\n   the \"11\"-marked packets might have\
    \ come from a congested router that\n   understands only the default ECN semantics,\
    \ and that expects that\n   end-nodes will respond appropriately to CE packets.\
    \  This requirement\n   would ensure that the traffic using the alternate semantics\
    \ does not\n   `bully' competing traffic that it might encounter along the path,\
    \ and\n   that it does not drive up congestion on the shared link\n   inappropriately.\n\
    \   Additional requirements concern compatibility between traffic using\n   default\
    \ ECN semantics and routers using alternate ECN semantics.\n   This situation\
    \ could occur if a diffserv codepoint using default ECN\n   semantics is redefined\
    \ to use alternate ECN semantics, and traffic\n   from an \"old\" source traverses\
    \ a \"new\" router.  If the router \"knows\"\n   that a packet is from a sender\
    \ using alternate semantics (e.g.,\n   because the packet is using a certain diffserv\
    \ codepoint, and all\n   packets with that diffserv codepoint use alternate semantics\
    \ for the\n   ECN field), then the requirements below are not necessary, and the\n\
    \   rules for the alternate semantics apply.\n   A requirement for compatibility\
    \ with end-nodes using default ECN is\n   that if a packet that *could* be using\
    \ default semantics is marked\n   with the ECN codepoint \"00\", this marking\
    \ must not be changed to\n   \"01\", \"10\", or \"11\" in the network.  This prevents\
    \ the packet from\n   being represented incorrectly to a default-ECN router downstream\
    \ as\n   ECN-Capable.  Similarly, if a packet that *could* be using default\n\
    \   semantics is marked with the ECN codepoint \"01\", then this codepoint\n \
    \  should not be changed to \"10\" in the network (and a \"10\" codepoint\n  \
    \ should not be changed to \"01\").  This requirement is necessary to\n   avoid\
    \ interference with the transport protocol's use of the ECN nonce\n   [RFC3540].\n\
    \   As discussed earlier, the current conformant congestion control\n   responses\
    \ to a dropped or default-ECN-marked packet consist of TCP\n   and TCP-like congestion\
    \ control, and of TFRC (TCP-Friendly Rate\n   Control).  Another possible response\
    \ considered in RFC 3714, but not\n   standardized in a standards-track document,\
    \ is that of simply\n   terminating an alternate-ECN connection for a period of\
    \ time if the\n   long-term sending rate is higher than would be that of a TCP\n\
    \   connection experiencing the same packet dropping or marking rates\n   [RFC3714].\
    \  We note that the use of such a congestion control\n   response to CE-marked\
    \ packets would require specification of time\n   constants for measuring the\
    \ loss rates and for stopping transmission,\n   and would require a consideration\
    \ of issues of packet size.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Verification of Feedback from the Router
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Verification of Feedback from the Router\n   One issue in evaluating the\
    \ alternate ECN semantics concerns\n   mechanisms to discourage lying from the\
    \ transport receiver to the\n   transport sender.  In many cases, the sender is\
    \ a server that has an\n   interest in using the alternate ECN semantics correctly,\
    \ while the\n   receiver has more incentive to lie about the congestion experienced\n\
    \   along the path.\n   In the default ECN semantics, two of the four ECN codepoints\
    \ are used\n   for ECN-Capable(0) and ECN-Capable(1).  The use of two codepoints\
    \ for\n   ECN-Capable, instead of one, permits the data sender to verify the\n\
    \   receiver's reports that packets were actually received unmarked at\n   the\
    \ receiver.  In particular, the sender can specify that the\n   receiver report\
    \ to the sender whether each unmarked packet was\n   received ECN-Capable(0) or\
    \ ECN-Capable(1), as discussed in RFC 3540\n   [RFC3540].  This use of ECN-Capable(0)\
    \ and ECN-Capable(1) is\n   independent of the semantics of the other ECN codepoints,\
    \ and could\n   be used, if desired, with alternate semantics for the other\n\
    \   codepoints.\n   If alternate semantics for the ECN codepoint don't include\
    \ the use of\n   two separate codepoints to indicate ECN-Capable, then the connections\n\
    \   using those semantics have lost the ability to verify that the data\n   receiver\
    \ is accurately reporting the received ECN codepoint to the\n   data sender. \
    \ In this case, it might be necessary for the alternate-\n   ECN framework to\
    \ include alternate mechanisms for ensuring that the\n   data receiver is reporting\
    \ feedback appropriately to the sender.  As\n   one possibility, policers could\
    \ be used in routers to ensure that end\n   nodes are responding appropriately\
    \ to marked packets.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Coexistence with Competing Traffic
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Coexistence with Competing Traffic\n   A second general issue concerns\
    \ the coexistence of alternate-ECN\n   traffic with competing traffic along the\
    \ path, in a clean environment\n   where all routers understand and are willing\
    \ to use the alternate ECN\n   semantics for the traffic that specifies its use.\n\
    \   If the traffic using the alternate ECN semantics is best-effort\n   traffic,\
    \ then it is subject to the general requirement of fair\n   competition with TCP\
    \ and other traffic along the path [RFC2914].\n   If the traffic using the alternate\
    \ ECN semantics is diffserv traffic,\n   then the requirements are governed by\
    \ the overall guidelines for that\n   class of diffserv traffic.  It is beyond\
    \ the scope of this document\n   to specify the requirements, if any, for the\
    \ coexistence of diffserv\n   traffic with other traffic on the link; this should\
    \ be addressed in\n   the specification of the diffserv codepoint itself.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Proposals for Alternate ECN with Edge-to-Edge Semantics
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Proposals for Alternate ECN with Edge-to-Edge Semantics\n   RFC 3168 specifies\
    \ the use of the default ECN semantics by an end-\n   to-end transport protocol,\
    \ with the requirement that \"upon the\n   receipt by an ECN-Capable transport\
    \ of a single CE packet, the\n   congestion control algorithms followed at the\
    \ end-systems MUST be\n   essentially the same as the congestion control response\
    \ to a *single*\n   dropped packet\" ([RFC3168], Section 5).  In contrast, some\
    \ of the\n   proposals for alternate ECN semantics are for ECN used in an edge-\n\
    \   to-edge context between gateways at the edge of a network region,\n   e.g.,\
    \ [BESFC06].\n   When alternate ECN is defined with edge-to-edge semantics, this\n\
    \   definition needs to ensure that the edge-to-edge semantics do not\n   conflict\
    \ with a connection using other ECN semantics end-to-end.  One\n   way to avoid\
    \ conflict would be for the edge-to-edge ECN proposal to\n   include some mechanism\
    \ to ensure that the edge-to-edge ECN is not\n   used for connections that are\
    \ using other ECN semantics (standard or\n   otherwise) end-to-end.  Alternately,\
    \ the edge-to-edge semantics could\n   be defined so that they do not conflict\
    \ with a connection using other\n   ECN semantics end-to-end.\n"
