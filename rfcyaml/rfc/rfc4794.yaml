- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 1264 was written during what was effectively a completely\n\
    \   different time in the life of the Internet.  It prescribed rules to\n   protect\
    \ the Internet against new routing protocols that may have\n   various undesirable\
    \ properties.  In today's Internet, there are so\n   many other pressures against\
    \ deploying unreasonable protocols that we\n   believe that existing controls\
    \ suffice, and the RFC 1264 rules just\n   get in the way.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 1264 [RFC1264] describes various rules to be applied\
    \ when\n   publishing routing protocols on the IETF Standards Track, including\n\
    \   requirements for implementation, MIBs, security, etc.  These rules\n   were\
    \ written in an attempt to protect the Internet from incomplete or\n   unscalable\
    \ new protocols.\n   Today, one of the big problems the IETF faces is timeliness.\n\
    \   Applying additional rules to a certain class of protocols hurts the\n   IETF's\
    \ ability to publish specifications in a timely manner.\n   The current standards\
    \ process [RFC2026] already permits the IESG to\n   require additional implementation\
    \ experience when it appears to be\n   needed.  We do not need any more rules\
    \ than that.  RFC 2026 says:\n      Usually, neither implementation nor operational\
    \ experience is\n      required for the designation of a specification as a Proposed\n\
    \      Standard.  However, such experience is highly desirable, and will\n   \
    \   usually represent a strong argument in favor of a Proposed\n      Standard\
    \ designation.\n      The IESG may require implementation and/or operational experience\n\
    \      prior to granting Proposed Standard status to a specification that\n  \
    \    materially affects the core Internet protocols or that specifies\n      behavior\
    \ that may have significant operational impact on the\n      Internet.\n"
- title: 2.  RFC 1264 Is Obsolete
  contents:
  - "2.  RFC 1264 Is Obsolete\n   Therefore, this document reclassifies RFC 1264 as\
    \ historic.  While\n   that does not prohibit the Routing Area Directors from\
    \ requiring\n   implementation and/or operational experience under the RFC 2026\n\
    \   rules, it removes the broad, general requirement from all routing\n   documents.\n"
- title: 3.  Working Group Procedures
  contents:
  - "3.  Working Group Procedures\n   Some working groups within the Routing Area\
    \ have developed\n   procedures, based on RFC 1264, to require implementations\
    \ before\n   forwarding a document to the IESG.  This action does not prevent\n\
    \   those working groups from continuing with these procedures if the\n   working\
    \ group prefers to work this way.  We encourage working groups\n   to put measures\
    \ in place to improve the quality of their output.\n   RFC 1264 required a MIB\
    \ module to be in development for a protocol;\n   this is still encouraged in\
    \ a broad sense.  This is not meant to be\n   limiting, however; protocol management\
    \ and manageability should be\n   considered in the context of current IETF management\
    \ protocols.  In\n   addition, [RTG-REQS] contains a description of a \"Manageability\n\
    \   Requirements\" section; this is not currently a requirement but should\n \
    \  be considered.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   While RFC 1264's rules placed additional constraints\
    \ on the\n   security-related contents of an RFC, current policies (e.g., the\n\
    \   requirement for a Security Considerations section) suffice.\n"

  - "5.  Acknowledgements\n   Alex Zinin and Bill Fenner spent a great deal of time\
    \ trying to\n   produce an updated version of the RFC 1264 rules that would apply\
    \ to\n   today's Internet.  This work was eventually abandoned when it was\n \
    \  realized (after much public discussion at Routing Area meetings,\n   Internet\
    \ Area meetings, and on the Routing Area mailing list) that\n   there was just\
    \ no way to write the rules in a way that advanced the\n   goals of the IETF.\n"
