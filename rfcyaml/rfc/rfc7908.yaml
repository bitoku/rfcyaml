  - "Abstract\n   A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing\n\
    \   system, known as \"route leaks\", has received significant attention in\n\
    \   recent years.  Frequent incidents that result in significant\n   disruptions\
    \ to Internet routing are labeled route leaks, but to date\n   a common definition\
    \ of the term has been lacking.  This document\n   provides a working definition\
    \ of route leaks while keeping in mind\n   the real occurrences that have received\
    \ significant attention.\n   Further, this document attempts to enumerate (though\
    \ not\n   exhaustively) different types of route leaks based on observed events\n\
    \   on the Internet.  The aim is to provide a taxonomy that covers\n   several\
    \ forms of route leaks that have been observed and are of\n   concern to the Internet\
    \ user community as well as the network\n   operator community.\n"

- title: 2.  Working Definition of Route Leaks
  contents:
  - "2.  Working Definition of Route Leaks\n   A proposed working definition of \"\
    route leak\" is as follows:\n   A route leak is the propagation of routing announcement(s)\
    \ beyond\n   their intended scope.  That is, an announcement from an Autonomous\n\
    \   System (AS) of a learned BGP route to another AS is in violation of\n   the\
    \ intended policies of the receiver, the sender, and/or one of the\n   ASes along\
    \ the preceding AS path.  The intended scope is usually\n   defined by a set of\
    \ local redistribution/filtering policies\n   distributed among the ASes involved.\
    \  Often, these intended policies\n   are defined in terms of the pair-wise peering\
    \ business relationship\n   between ASes (e.g., customer, transit provider, peer).\
    \  For\n   literature related to AS relationships and routing policies, see\n\
    \   [Gao], [Luckie], and [Gill].  For measurements of valley-free\n   violations\
    \ in Internet routing, see [Anwar], [Giotsas], and\n   [Wijchers].\n   The result\
    \ of a route leak can be redirection of traffic through an\n   unintended path\
    \ that may enable eavesdropping or traffic analysis and\n   may or may not result\
    \ in an overload or black hole.  Route leaks can\n   be accidental or malicious\
    \ but most often arise from accidental\n   misconfigurations.\n   The above definition\
    \ is not intended to be all encompassing.  Our aim\n   here is to have a working\
    \ definition that fits enough observed\n   incidents so that the IETF community\
    \ has a basis for developing\n   solutions for route-leak detection and mitigation.\n"

  - "3.  Classification of Route Leaks Based on Documented Events\n   As illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1, a common form of route leak occurs when a\n   multihomed customer\
    \ AS (such as AS3 in Figure 1) learns a prefix\n   update from one transit provider\
    \ (ISP1) and leaks the update to\n   another transit provider (ISP2) in violation\
    \ of intended routing\n   policies, and further, the second transit provider does\
    \ not detect\n   the leak and propagates the leaked update to its customers, peers,\n\
    \   and transit ISPs.\n                                      /\\             \

- title: '3.1.  Type 1: Hairpin Turn with Full Prefix'
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Type 1: Hairpin Turn with Full Prefix\n   Description: A multihomed AS\
    \ learns a route from one upstream ISP and\n   simply propagates it to another\
    \ upstream ISP (the turn essentially\n   resembling a hairpin).  Neither the prefix\
    \ nor the AS path in the\n   update is altered.  This is similar to a straightforward\
    \ path-\n   poisoning attack [Kapela-Pilosov], but with full prefix.  It should\n\
    \   be noted that leaks of this type are often accidental (i.e., not\n   malicious).\
    \  The update basically makes a hairpin turn at the\n   offending AS's multihomed\
    \ AS.  The leak often succeeds (i.e., the\n   leaked update is accepted and propagated)\
    \ because the second ISP\n   prefers customer announcement over peer announcement\
    \ of the same\n   prefix.  Data packets would reach the legitimate destination,\
    \ albeit\n   via the offending AS, unless they are dropped at the offending AS\
    \ due\n   to its inability to handle resulting large volumes of traffic.\n   o\
    \  Example incidents: Examples of Type 1 route-leak incidents are (1)\n      the\
    \ Dodo-Telstra incident in March 2012 [Huston2012], (2) the\n      VolumeDrive-Atrato\
    \ incident in September 2014 [Madory], and (3)\n      the massive Telekom Malaysia\
    \ route leak of about 179,000 prefixes,\n      which in turn Level3 accepted and\
    \ propagated [Toonk2015-B].\n"
- title: '3.2.  Type 2: Lateral ISP-ISP-ISP Leak'
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Type 2: Lateral ISP-ISP-ISP Leak\n   Description: The term \"lateral\"\
    \ here is synonymous with \"non-transit\"\n   or \"peer-to-peer\".  This type\
    \ of route leak typically occurs when,\n   for example, three sequential ISP peers\
    \ (e.g., ISP-A, ISP-B, and\n   ISP-C) are involved, and ISP-B receives a route\
    \ from ISP-A and in\n   turn leaks it to ISP-C.  The typical routing policy between\
    \ laterally\n   (i.e., non-transit) peering ISPs is that they should only propagate\n\
    \   to each other their respective customer prefixes.\n   o  Example incidents:\
    \ In [Mauch-nanog] and [Mauch], route leaks of\n      this type are reported by\
    \ monitoring updates in the global BGP\n      system and finding three or more\
    \ very large ISPs' Autonomous\n      System Numbers (ASNs) in a sequence in a\
    \ BGP update's AS path.\n      [Mauch] observes that its detection algorithm detects\
    \ for these\n      anomalies and potentially route leaks because very large ISPs\
    \ do\n      not, in general, buy transit services from each other.  However,\n\
    \      it also notes that there are exceptions when one very large ISP\n     \
    \ does indeed buy transit from another very large ISP, and\n      accordingly,\
    \ exceptions are made in its detection algorithm for\n      known cases.\n"

    \  These leaked routes typically\n   originate from the customer cone of the lateral\

    \ (1)\n      the Axcelx-Hibernia route leak of Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n   \
    \   prefixes causing disruption of AWS and a variety of services that\n      run\

  - "3.5.  Type 5: Prefix Re-origination with Data Path to Legitimate Origin\n   Description:\
    \ A multihomed AS learns a route from one upstream ISP and\n   announces the prefix\
    \ to another upstream ISP as if it is being\n   originated by it (i.e., strips\
    \ the received AS path and re-originates\n   the prefix).  This can be called\
    \ re-origination or mis-origination.\n   However, somehow a reverse path to the\
    \ legitimate origination AS may\n   be present and data packets reach the legitimate\
    \ destination albeit\n   via the offending AS.  (Note: The presence of a reverse\
    \ path here is\n   not attributable to the use of a path-poisoning trick by the\n\
    \   offending AS.)  But sometimes the reverse path may not be present,\n   and\
    \ data packets destined for the leaked prefix may be simply\n   discarded at the\
    \ offending AS.\n   o  Example incidents: Examples of Type 5 route leak include\
    \ (1) the\n      China Telecom incident in April 2010 [Hiran] [Cowie2010]\n  \
    \    [Labovitz], (2) the Belarusian GlobalOneBel route-leak incidents\n      in\

    \ Kerfi-Simmin route-leak incidents in July-August 2013\n      [Cowie2013], and\
    \ (4) the Indosat route-leak incident in April 2014\n      [Zmijewski].  The reverse\
    \ paths (i.e., data paths from the\n      offending AS to the legitimate destinations)\
    \ were present in\n      incidents #1, #2, and #3 cited above, but not in incident\
    \ #4.  In\n      incident #4, the misrouted data packets were dropped at Indosat's\n\
    \      AS.\n"
- title: '3.6.  Type 6: Accidental Leak of Internal Prefixes and More-Specific'
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Type 6: Accidental Leak of Internal Prefixes and More-Specific\n      Prefixes\n\
    \   Description: An offending AS simply leaks its internal prefixes to\n   one\
    \ or more of its transit-provider ASes and/or ISP peers.  The\n   leaked internal\
    \ prefixes are often more-specific prefixes subsumed by\n   an already announced,\
    \ less-specific prefix.  The more-specific\n   prefixes were not intended to be\
    \ routed in External BGP (eBGP).\n   Further, the AS receiving those leaks fails\
    \ to filter them.\n   Typically, these leaked announcements are due to some transient\n\
    \   failures within the AS; they are short-lived and typically withdrawn\n   quickly\
    \ following the announcements.  However, these more-specific\n   prefixes may\
    \ momentarily cause the routes to be preferred over other\n   aggregate (i.e.,\
    \ less specific) route announcements, thus redirecting\n   traffic from its normal\
    \ best path.\n   o  Example incidents: Leaks of internal routes occur frequently\n\
    \      (e.g., multiple times in a week), and the number of prefixes\n      leaked\
    \ range from hundreds to thousands per incident.  One highly\n      conspicuous\
    \ and widely disruptive leak of internal routes happened\n      in August 2014\
    \ when AS701 and AS705 leaked about 22,000 more-\n      specific prefixes of already-announced\
    \ aggregates [Huston2014]\n      [Toonk2014].\n"
- title: 4.  Additional Comments about the Classification
  contents:
  - "4.  Additional Comments about the Classification\n   It is worth noting that\
    \ Types 1 through 4 are similar in that a route\n   is leaked in violation of\
    \ policy in each case, but what varies is the\n   context of the leaked-route\
    \ source AS and destination AS roles.\n   A Type 5 route leak (i.e., prefix mis-origination\
    \ with data path to\n   legitimate origin) can also happen in conjunction with\
    \ the AS\n   relationship contexts in Types 2, 3, and 4.  While these\n   possibilities\
    \ are acknowledged, simply enumerating more types to\n   consider all such special\
    \ cases does not add value as far as solution\n   development for route leaks\
    \ is concerned.  Hence, the special cases\n   mentioned here are not included\
    \ in enumerating route-leak types.\n"
