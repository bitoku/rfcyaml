  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3323] defines a privacy mechanism for the Session Initiation\n\
    \   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], based on techniques available at the time\n   of\
    \ its publication.  This mechanism relies on the use of a separate\n   privacy\
    \ service to remove privacy-sensitive information from SIP\n   messages sent by\
    \ a User Agent (UA) before forwarding those messages\n   to the final destination.\
    \  Since then, numerous SIP extensions have\n   been proposed and standardized.\
    \  Some of those enable a UA to\n   withhold its user's identity and related information\
    \ without the need\n   for privacy services, which was not possible when RFC 3323\
    \ was\n   defined.\n   The purpose of this document is not to obsolete RFC 3323,\
    \ but to\n   enhance the overall privacy mechanism in SIP by allowing a UA to\
    \ take\n   control of its privacy, rather than being completely dependent on an\n\
    \   external privacy service.\n   The UA-driven privacy mechanism defined in this\
    \ document will not\n   eliminate the need for the RFC 3323 usage defined in [RFC3325],\
    \ which\n   instructs a privacy service not to forward a P-Asserted-Identity\n\
    \   header field outside the Trust Domain.  In order to prevent\n   forwarding\
    \ a P-Asserted-Identity header field outside the Trust\n   Domain, a UA needs\
    \ to include the Privacy header field with value\n   'id' (Privacy:id) in the\
    \ request, even when the UA is utilizing this\n   specification.\n   This document\
    \ defines a guideline in which a UA controls all the\n   privacy functions on\
    \ its own utilizing SIP extensions such as\n   Globally Routable User Agent URIs\
    \ (GRUUs) [RFC5627] and Traversal\n   Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [RFC5766].\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\

- title: 3.  Concept of Privacy
  contents:
  - "3.  Concept of Privacy\n   The concept of privacy in this document is the act\
    \ of concealing\n   privacy-sensitive information.  The protection of network\
    \ privacy\n   (e.g., topology hiding) is outside the scope of this document.\n\
    \   Privacy-sensitive information includes display-name and Uniform\n   Resource\
    \ Identifier (URI) in a From header field that can reveal the\n   user's name\
    \ and affiliation (e.g., company name), and IP addresses or\n   host names in\
    \ a Contact header field, a Via header field, a Call-ID\n   header field, or a\
    \ Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] body\n   that might reveal the\
    \ location of a UA.\n"
- title: 4.  Treatment of Privacy-Sensitive Information
  contents:
  - "4.  Treatment of Privacy-Sensitive Information\n   Some fields of a SIP message\
    \ potentially contain privacy-sensitive\n   information but are not essential\
    \ for achieving the intended purpose\n   of the message and can be omitted without\
    \ any side effects.  Other\n   fields are essential for achieving the intended\
    \ purpose of the\n   message and need to contain anonymized values in order to\
    \ avoid\n   disclosing privacy-sensitive information.  Of the privacy-sensitive\n\
    \   information listed in Section 3, URIs, host names, and IP addresses\n   in\
    \ Contact, Via, and SDP are required to be functional (i.e.,\n   suitable for\
    \ purpose) even when they are anonymized.\n   With the use of GRUU [RFC5627] and\
    \ TURN [RFC5766], a UA can obtain\n   URIs and IP addresses for media and signaling\
    \ that are functional yet\n   anonymous, and do not identify either the UA or\
    \ the user.\n   Instructions on how to obtain a functional anonymous URI and IP\n\
    \   address are given in Section 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.\n   Host names need\
    \ to be concealed because the user's identity can be\n   guessed from them, but\
    \ they are not always regarded as critical\n   privacy-sensitive information.\n\
    \   In addition, a UA needs to be careful not to include any information\n   that\
    \ identifies the user in optional SIP header fields such as\n   Subject and User-Agent.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Obtaining a Functional Anonymous URI Using the GRUU Mechanism
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Obtaining a Functional Anonymous URI Using the GRUU Mechanism\n   A UA\
    \ wanting to obtain a functional anonymous URI MUST support and\n   utilize the\
    \ GRUU mechanism unless it is able to obtain a functional\n   anonymous URI through\
    \ other means outside the scope for this\n   document.  By sending a REGISTER\
    \ request requesting GRUU, the UA can\n   obtain an anonymous URI, which can later\
    \ be used for the Contact\n   header field.\n   The detailed process on how a\
    \ UA obtains a GRUU is described in\n   [RFC5627].\n   In order to use the GRUU\
    \ mechanism to obtain a functional anonymous\n   URI, the UA MUST request GRUU\
    \ in the REGISTER request.  If a \"temp-\n   gruu\" SIP URI parameter and value\
    \ are present in the REGISTER\n   response, the user agent MUST use the value\
    \ of the \"temp-gruu\" as an\n   anonymous URI representing the UA.  This means\
    \ that the UA MUST use\n   this URI as its local target and that the UA MUST place\
    \ this URI in\n   the Contact header field of subsequent requests and responses\
    \ that\n   require the local target to be sent.\n   If there is no \"temp-gruu\"\
    \ SIP URI parameter in the 200 (OK) response\n   to the REGISTER request, a UA\
    \ SHOULD NOT proceed with its\n   anonymization process, unless something equivalent\
    \ to \"temp-gruu\" is\n   provided through some administrative means.\n   It is\
    \ RECOMMENDED that the UA consult the user before sending a\n   request without\
    \ a functional anonymous URI when privacy is requested\n   from the user.\n  \
    \ Due to the nature of how GRUU works, the domain name is always\n   revealed\
    \ when GRUU is used.  If revealing the domain name in the\n   Contact header field\
    \ is a concern, use of a third-party GRUU server\n   is a possible solution, but\
    \ this is outside the scope of this\n   document.  Refer to the Security Considerations\
    \ section for details.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Obtaining a Functional Anonymous IP Address Using the TURN
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Obtaining a Functional Anonymous IP Address Using the TURN\n      Mechanism\n\
    \   A UA that is not provided with a functional anonymous IP address\n   through\
    \ some administrative means MUST obtain a relayed address (IP\n   address of a\
    \ relay) if anonymity is desired for use in SDP and in the\n   Via header field.\
    \  Such an IP address is to be derived from a Session\n   Traversal Utilities\
    \ of NAT (STUN) relay server through the TURN\n   mechanism, which allows a STUN\
    \ server to act as a relay.\n   Anonymous IP addresses are needed for two purposes.\
    \  The first is for\n   use in the Via header field of a SIP request.  By obtaining\
    \ an IP\n   address from a STUN relay server, using that address in the Via\n\
    \   header field of the SIP request, and sending the SIP request to the\n   STUN\
    \ relay server, the IP address of the UA will not be revealed\n   beyond the relay\
    \ server.\n   The second is for use in SDP as an address for receiving media.\
    \  By\n   obtaining an IP address from a STUN relay server and using that\n  \
    \ address in SDP, media will be received via the relay server.  Also,\n   media\
    \ can be sent via the relay server.  In this way, neither SDP nor\n   media packets\
    \ reveal the IP address of the UA.\n   It is assumed that a UA is either manually\
    \ or automatically\n   configured through means such as the configuration framework\n\
    \   [SIPPING-CONFIG] with the address of one or more STUN (Session\n   Traversal\
    \ Utilities for NAT) [RFC5766] relay servers to obtain\n   anonymous IP address.\n"
- title: 5.  UA Behavior
  contents:
  - "5.  UA Behavior\n   This section describes how to generate an anonymous SIP message\
    \ at a\n   UA.\n   A UA fully compliant with this document MUST obscure or conceal\
    \ all\n   the critical UA-inserted privacy-sensitive information in SIP\n   requests\
    \ and responses as shown in Section 5.1 when user privacy is\n   requested.  In\
    \ addition, the UA SHOULD conceal the non-critical\n   privacy-sensitive information\
    \ as shown in Section 5.2.\n   Furthermore, when a UA uses a relay server to conceal\
    \ its identity,\n   the UA MUST send requests to the relay server to ensure request\
    \ and\n   response follow the same signaling path.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Contact Header Field\n   When using this header field in a dialog-forming\
    \ request or response\n   or in a mid-dialog request or response, this field contains\
    \ the local\n   target, i.e., a URI used to reach the UA for mid-dialog requests\
    \ and\n   possibly out-of-dialog requests, such as a REFER request [RFC3515].\n\
    \   The Contact header field can also contain a display-name.  Since the\n   Contact\
    \ header field is used for routing further requests to the UA,\n   the UA MUST\
    \ include a functional URI even when it is anonymized.\n   When using this header\
    \ field in a dialog-forming request or response\n   or in a mid-dialog request\
    \ or response, the UA MUST anonymize the\n   Contact header field using an anonymous\
    \ URI (\"temp-gruu\") obtained\n   through the GRUU mechanism, unless an equivalent\
    \ functional anonymous\n   URI is provided by some other means.  For other requests\
    \ and\n   responses, with the exception of 3xx responses, REGISTER requests and\n\
    \   200 (OK) responses to a REGISTER request, the UA MUST either omit the\n  \
    \ Contact header field or use an anonymous URI.\n   Refer to Section 4.1 for details\
    \ on how to obtain an anonymous URI\n   through GRUU.\n   The UA MUST omit the\
    \ display-name in a Contact header field or set\n   the display-name to \"Anonymous\"\
    .\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  From Header Field in Requests
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  From Header Field in Requests\n   Without privacy considerations, this\
    \ field contains the identity of\n   the user, such as display-name and URI.\n\
    \   RFCs 3261 and 3323 recommend setting\n   \"sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid\"\
    \ as a SIP URI in a From header field\n   when user privacy is requested.  This\
    \ raises an issue when the SIP-\n   Identity mechanism [RFC4474] is applied to\
    \ the message, because SIP-\n   Identity requires an actual domain name in the\
    \ From header field.\n   A UA generating an anonymous SIP message supporting this\n\
    \   specification MUST anonymize the From header field in one of the two\n   ways\
    \ described below.\n   Option 1:\n   A UA anonymizes a From header field using\
    \ an anonymous display-name\n   and an anonymous URI following the procedure noted\
    \ in Section 4.1.1.3\n   of RFC 3323.\n   The example form of the From header\
    \ field of option 1 is as follows:\n      From: \"Anonymous\" <sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid>;tag=1928301774\n\
    \   Option 2:\n   A UA anonymizes a From header field using an anonymous display-name\n\
    \   and an anonymous URI with user's valid domain name instead of\n   \"anonymous.invalid\"\
    .\n   The example form of the From header field of option 2 is as follows:\n \
    \     From: \"Anonymous\" <sip:anonymous@example.com>;tag=1928301774\n   A UA\
    \ SHOULD go with option 1 to conceal its domain name in the From\n   header field.\
    \  However, SIP-Identity cannot be used with a From\n   header field in accordance\
    \ with option 1, because the SIP-Identity\n   mechanism uses authentication based\
    \ on the domain name.\n   If a UA expects the SIP-Identity mechanism to be applied\
    \ to the\n   request, it is RECOMMENDED to go with option 2.  However, the user's\n\
    \   domain name will be revealed from the From header field of option 2.\n   If\
    \ the user wants both anonymity and strong identity, a solution\n   would be to\
    \ use a third-party anonymization service that issues an\n   Address of Record\
    \ (AoR) for use in the From header field of a request\n   and that also provides\
    \ a SIP-Identity Authentication Service.  Third-\n   party anonymization service\
    \ is out of scope for this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This specification uses GRUU and TURN and inherits\
    \ any security\n   considerations described in these documents.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ if the provider of the caller intending to obscure its\n   identity consists\
    \ of a small number of people (e.g., small\n   enterprise, Small Office, Home\
    \ Office (SOHO)), the domain name alone\n   can reveal the identity of the caller.\n\
    \   The same can be true when the provider is large but the receiver of\n   the\
    \ call only knows a few people from the source of call.\n   There are mainly two\
    \ places in the message, the From header field and\n   Contact header field, where\
    \ the domain name is expected to be\n   functional.\n   The domain name in the\
    \ From header field can be obscured as described\n   in Section 5.1.2, whereas\
    \ the Contact header field needs to contain a\n   valid domain name at all times\
    \ in order to function properly.\n   Note: Generally, a device will not show the\
    \ contact address to the\n   receiver, but this does not mean that one cannot\
    \ find the domain name\n   in a message.  In fact, as long as this specification\
    \ is used to\n   obscure identity, the message will always contain a valid domain\
    \ name\n   as it inherits key characteristics of GRUU.\n   Note: For UAs that\
    \ use a temporary GRUU, confidentiality does not\n   extend to parties that are\
    \ permitted to register to the same AoR or\n   are permitted to obtain temporary\
    \ GRUUs when subscribed to the 'reg'\n   event package [RFC3680] for the AoR.\
    \  To limit this, it is suggested\n   that the authorization policy for the 'reg'\
    \ event package permit only\n   those subscribers authorized to register to the\
    \ AoR to receive\n   temporary GRUUs.  With this policy, the confidentiality of\
    \ the\n   temporary GRUU will be the same whether or not the 'reg' event\n   package\
    \ is used.\n   If one wants to assure anonymization, it is suggested that the\
    \ user\n   seek and rely on a third-party anonymization service, which is\n  \
    \ outside the scope of this document.\n   A third-party anonymization service\
    \ provides registrar and TURN\n   service that have no affiliation with the caller's\
    \ provider, allowing\n   caller to completely withhold its identity.\n"
