  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\
    \ [1]\n   Option for the coordinate-based geographic location of the client, to\n\
    \   be provided by the server.\n   The DHCP server is assumed to have determined\
    \ the location from the\n   Circuit-ID Relay Agent Information Option (RAIO) defined\
    \ (as SubOpt\n   1) in [2].  In order to translate the circuit (switch port\n\
    \   identifier) into a location, the DHCP server is assumed to have\n   access\
    \ to a service that maps from circuit-ID to the location at\n   which the circuit\
    \ connected to that port terminates in the building,\n   for example, the location\
    \ of the wall jack.\n   An important feature of this specification is that after\
    \ the relevant\n   DHC exchanges have taken place, the location information is\
    \ stored on\n   the end device rather than somewhere else, where retrieving it\
    \ might\n   be difficult in practice.\n   Another important feature of this LCI\
    \ is its inclusion of a\n   resolution parameter for each of the dimensions of\
    \ location.  Because\n   this resolution parameter need not apply to all dimensions\
    \ equally, a\n   resolution value is included for each of the 3 location elements.\n\
    \   Resolution does not define Geographic Privacy policy.\n   The resulting location\
    \ information using this resolution method is a\n   small fixed length Configuration\
    \ Information that can be easily\n   carried in protocols, such as DHCP, which\
    \ have limited packet size\n   because this LCI is only 18 bytes long.\n   Finally,\
    \ the appendix of this document provides some arithmetic\n   examples of the implication\
    \ of different resolution values on the\n   La/Lo/Alt.\n"

- title: 1.2.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Motivation\n   As applications such as IP Telephony are replacing conventional\n\
    \   telephony, users are expecting the same (or greater) level of\n   services\
    \ with the new technology.  One service offered by\n   conventional telephony\
    \ that is missing in any standardized fashion\n   within IP Telephony is for a\
    \ user to be automatically located by\n   emergency responders, in a timely fashion,\
    \ when the user summons help\n   (by dialing 911 in North America, for example).\
    \  Unless strict\n   administrative rules are followed, the mobility of a wired\
    \ Ethernet\n   device within a campus negates any opportunity for an emergency\n\
    \   responder to locate the device with any degree of expediency.  Users\n   do\
    \ not want to give up the mobility IP Telephony offers.  Informing\n   the host\
    \ device of its geo-location at host configuration time will\n   allow the device\
    \ to utilize this geo-location information to inform\n   others of its current\
    \ geo-location, if the user and/or application so\n   desires.\n   The goal of\
    \ this option is to enable a wired Ethernet host to obtain\n   its location, which\
    \ it could provide to an emergency responder, as\n   one example.\n   Wireless\
    \ hosts can utilize this option to gain knowledge of the\n   location of the radio\
    \ access point used during host configuration,\n   but would need some more exotic\
    \ mechanisms, maybe GPS, or maybe a\n   future DHCP option, which includes a list\
    \ of geo-locations like that\n   defined here, containing the locations of the\
    \ radio access points\n   that are close to the client.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Rationale\n   Within the LCI described here, Latitude and Longitude are\
    \ represented\n   in fixed-point 2s-complement binary degrees, for the economy\
    \ of a\n   smaller option size compared to a string encoding of digits in [7].\n\
    \   The integer parts of these fields are 9 bits long to accommodate +/-\n   180\
    \ degrees.  The fractional part is 25 bits long, better than the\n   precision\
    \ of 7 decimal digits.  The length of each field is 40 bits,\n   34 of which is\
    \ the sum of the integer (9) and fractional (25) bits,\n   plus 6 bits of resolution.\n\
    \   Altitude is determined by the Altitude Type (AT) indicated by the AT\n   field,\
    \ which is 4 bits long.  Two Altitude Types are defined here,\n   meters (code=1)\
    \ and floors (code=2), both of which are 2s-complement\n   fixed-point with 22\
    \ bits of integer part and 8 bits of fractional\n   part.  Additional Altitude\
    \ Types MAY be assigned by IANA.  The\n   \"floors\" Altitude Type is provided\
    \ because altitude in meters may not\n   be known within a building, and a floor\
    \ indication may be more\n   useful.\n   GPS systems today can use WGS84 for horizontal\
    \ and vertical datums;\n   [6] defines WGS84 as a three-dimensional datum.  For\
    \ other datum\n   values that do not include a vertical component, both the horizontal\n\
    \   and vertical datum of reference will be specified in the IANA record.\n  \
    \ Each of these 3 elements begins with an accuracy sub-field of 6 bits,\n   indicating\
    \ the number of bits of resolution.  This resolution sub-\n   field accommodates\
    \ the desire to easily adjust the precision of a\n   reported location.  Contents\
    \ beyond the claimed resolution MAY be\n   randomized to obscure greater precision\
    \ that might be available.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  DHC Location Configuration Information Elements\n   DHCP is a binary Protocol;\
    \ using protocols of LCI are likely to be\n   text based.  Since most coordinate\
    \ systems translate easily between\n   binary-based and text-based location output\

    \          within +/- 90 degrees.  Positive numbers are north of the\n       \
    \       equator and negative numbers are south of the equator.\n   A value of\
    \ 2 in the LaRes field indicates a precision of no greater\n   than 1/6th that\
    \ of the globe (in the first example of the appendix).\n   A value of 34 in the\

    \         the prime meridian and negative (2s complement) numbers\n          \
    \    are West of the prime meridian.\n   A value of 2 in the LoRes field indicates\
    \ precision of no greater\n   than 1/6th that of the globe (see first example\
    \ of the appendix).  A\n   value of 34 in the LoRes field indicates a precision\

    \ converge\n   at the poles, the distance is smaller (better precision) for\n\
    \   locations away from the equator.\n   Altitude:  A 30 bit value defined by\

    \      bit fraction\n   If AT = 1, an AltRes value 0.0 would indicate unknown\
    \ altitude.  The\n   most precise Altitude would have an AltRes value of 30. \
    \ Many values\n   of AltRes would obscure any variation due to vertical datum\n\
    \   differences.\n   2: Floors - in 2s-complement fixed-point 22-bit integer part\
    \ with\n              8-bit fraction\n   AT = 2 for Floors enables representing\
    \ altitude in a form more\n   relevant in buildings which have different floor-to-floor\
    \ dimensions.\n   An altitude coded as AT = 2, AltRes = 30, and Altitude = 0.0\
    \ is\n   meaningful even outside a building, and represents ground level at\n\
    \   the given latitude and longitude.  Inside a building, 0.0 represents\n   the\
    \ floor level associated with ground level at the main entrance.\n   This document\
    \ defines a number; one must arrive at the number by\n   counting floors from\
    \ the floor defined to be 0.0.\n   The values represented by this AT will be of\

    \ control,\n   the values chosen to represent the characteristics of an individual\n\
    \   building will be derived and agreed upon by the operator of the\n   building\
    \ and the intended users of the data.  Attempting to\n   standardize this type\

    \ floor 4 and floor 5 could be\n   represented as values = 4.1 and 4.2 respectively.\n\
    \   Floors located below ground level could be represented by negative\n   values.\n\
    \   Larger values represent floors that are above (higher in altitude)\n   floors\
    \ with lower values.\n   The AltRes field SHOULD be set to maximum precision when\
    \ AT = 2\n   (floors) when a floor value is included in the DHCP Reply, or the\n\
    \   AT = 0 to denote the floor isn't known.\n   Any additional LCI Altitude Types(s)\
