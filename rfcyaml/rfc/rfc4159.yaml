  - "Abstract\n   This document advises of the deprecation of the use of \"ip6.int\"\
    \ for\n   Standards Conformant IPv6 implementations.\n"
- title: 1.  IPv6 Standards Action
  contents:
  - "1.  IPv6 Standards Action\n   In August 2001 the IETF published [RFC3152], which\
    \ advised that the\n   use of \"ip6.int\" as the domain for reverse-mapping of\
    \ IPv6 addresses\n   to DNS names was deprecated.  The document noted that the\
    \ use of\n   \"ip6.int\" would be phased out in an orderly fashion.\n   As of\
    \ 1 September 2005, the IETF advises the community that the DNS\n   domain \"\
    ip6.int\" should no longer be used to perform reverse mapping\n   of IPv6 addresses\
    \ to domain names, and that the domain \"ip6.arpa\"\n   should be used henceforth,\
    \ in accordance with the IANA Considerations\n   described in [RFC3596].  The\
    \ domain \"ip6.int\" is deprecated, and its\n   use in IPv6 implementations that\
    \ conform to the IPv6 Internet\n   Standards is discontinued.\n   The Regional\
    \ Internet Registries (RIRs) are advised that maintenance\n   of delegation of\
    \ entries in \"ip6.int\" is no longer required as part\n   of infrastructure services\
    \ in support of Internet Standards\n   Conformant IPv6 implementations as of 1\
    \ September 2005.  The RIRs are\n   requested to work with their communities to\
    \ adopt a schedule\n   regarding the cessation of support of registration services\
    \ for the\n   \"ip6.int\" domain.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA is advised that the \"ip6.int\" domain for reverse\
    \ mapping of IPv6\n   addresses to domain names is no longer part of Internet\
    \ Standards\n   Conformant support of IPv6 as of 1 September 2005.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   While DNS spoofing of address to name mapping\
    \ has been exploited in\n   IPv4, removal of the \"ip6.int\" zone from the standard\
    \ IPv6\n   specification creates no new threats to the security of the internet.\n"
