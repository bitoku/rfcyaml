Abstract This document defines the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm within the Secure Real time Transport Protocol (SRTP).
It details two modes of operation (CTR and GCM) and the SRTP key derivation functions for ARIA.
Additionally, this document defines DTLS SRTP protection profiles and
(MIKEY) parameter sets for use with ARIA.
This document defines the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm [RFC5794] in the Secure Real time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] for providing confidentiality for Real time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] traffic and for RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
ARIA ARIA is a general purpose block cipher algorithm developed by Korean cryptographers in 2003.
It is an iterated block cipher with 128 , 192 , and 256 bit keys and encrypts 128 bit blocks in 12, 14, and 16 rounds, depending on the key size.
It is secure and suitable for most software and hardware implementations on 32 bit and 8 bit processors.
It was established as a Korean standard block cipher algorithm in 2004
[ARIAKS] and has been widely used in Korea, especially for government to public services.
It was included in Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)
The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in [RFC5794].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
Cryptographic Transforms Block ciphers ARIA and AES share common characteristics including mode, key size, and block size.
ARIA does not have any restrictions for modes of operation that are used with this block cipher.
We define two modes of running ARIA within SRTP:
(1) ARIA in Counter Mode (ARIA CTR) and
(2) ARIA in Galois/Counter Mode (ARIA GCM).
ARIA CTR Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES 128 counter mode encryption, which it refers to as "AES CM".
Section 2 of [RFC6188] defines "AES 256 CM" in SRTP.
ARIA counter modes are defined in the same manner except that each invocation of AES is replaced by that of ARIA [RFC5794] and are denoted by ARIA 128 CTR and ARIA 256 CTR, respectively, according to the key lengths.
The plaintext inputs to the block cipher are formed as in AES CTR (AES CM, AES 256 CM) and the block cipher outputs are processed as in AES CTR.
Note that, ARIA CTR MUST be used only in conjunction with an authentication transform.
Section 3.2 of [RFC6904] defines AES CTR for SRTP header extension keystream generation.
When ARIA CTR is used, the header extension keystream SHALL be generated in the same manner except that each invocation of AES is replaced by that of ARIA [RFC5794].
GCM Galois/Counter Mode [GCM] [RFC5116] is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) block cipher mode.
A detailed description of ARIA GCM is defined similarly as AES GCM found in [RFC5116] and [RFC5282].
[RFC7714] describes the use of AES GCM with SRTP.
The use of ARIA  GCM with SRTP is defined the same as AES GCM except that each invocation of AES is replaced by ARIA [RFC5794].
When encryption of header extensions [RFC6904] is in use, a separate keystream to encrypt selected RTP header extension elements MUST be generated in the same manner defined in [RFC7714] except that AES CTR is replaced by ARIA CTR.
Key Derivation Functions Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines the AES 128 counter mode key derivation function, which it refers to as "AES CM PRF".
Section 3 of [RFC6188] defines the AES 256 counter mode key derivation function, which it refers to as "AES 256 CM PRF".
The ARIA CTR Pseudorandom Function (PRF) is defined in a same manner except that each invocation of AES is replaced by that of ARIA.
According to the key lengths of the underlying encryption algorithm, ARIA CTR PRFs are denoted by "ARIA 128 CTR PRF" and "ARIA 256 CTR PRF".
The usage requirements of [RFC6188] and [RFC7714] regarding the AES CM PRF apply to the ARIA CTR PRF as well.
This section defines SRTP protection profiles that use the ARIA transforms and key derivation functions defined in this document.
The following list indicates the SRTP transform parameters for each protection profile.
Those are described for use with DTLS SRTP [RFC5764].
The parameters cipher key length, cipher salt length, auth key length, and auth tag length express the number of bits in the values to which they refer.
The maximum lifetime parameter indicates the maximum number of packets that can be protected with each single set of keys when the parameter profile is in use.
All of these parameters apply to both RTP and RTCP, unless the RTCP parameters are separately specified.
128 CTR cipher key length:
key derivation function:  ARIA 256 CTR PRF auth function:
key derivation function:  ARIA 256 CTR PRF auth function:
at most 2^31 SRTCP packets and at most 2^48 SRTP packets SRTP AEAD ARIA
128 GCM cipher key length:

96 bits aead auth tag length:
A key derivation function:  ARIA
256 GCM cipher key length:
A key derivation function:  ARIA
HMAC SHA1 with a 160 bit key.
Note that SRTP protection profiles that use AEAD algorithms do not specify an auth function, auth key length, or auth tag length, since they do not use a separate auth function, auth key, or auth tag.
The term aead auth tag length is used to emphasize that this refers to the authentication tag provided by the AEAD algorithm and that this tag is not located in the authentication tag field provided by SRTP/ SRTCP.
The PRFs for ARIA protection profiles are defined by ARIA CTR PRF of the equal key length with the encryption algorithm (see Section 2).
SRTP ARIA 128 CTR HMAC and SRTP AEAD ARIA
128 GCM MUST use the ARIA 128 CTR PRF key derivation function.
And SRTP ARIA 256 CTR HMAC and SRTP AEAD ARIA 256 GCM
MUST use the ARIA 256 CTR PRF key derivation function.
MIKEY specifies the SRTP protection profile definition separately from the key length (which is specified by the session encryption key length) and the authentication tag length.
The DTLS SRTP [RFC5764] protection profiles are mapped to MIKEY parameter sets as shown below.
10 octets    SRTP ARIA 128 CTR HMAC 32
4 octets    SRTP ARIA 256 CTR HMAC 80    ARIA CTR

At the time of publication of this document, no security problem has been found on ARIA.
Previous security analysis results are summarized in [ATY].
The security considerations in [GCM], [RFC3711], [RFC5116], [RFC6188], [RFC6904], and [RFC7714] apply to this document as well.
This document includes crypto suites with authentication tags of a length less than 80 bits.
These suites MAY be used for certain application contexts where longer authentication tags may be undesirable, for example, those mentioned in [RFC3711], Section 7.5.
Otherwise, short authentication tags SHOULD NOT be used, since they may reduce authentication strength.
See [RFC3711], Section 9.5 for a discussion of risks related to weak authentication in SRTP.
At the time of publication of this document, SRTP recommends HMAC  SHA1 as the default and mandatory to implement MAC algorithm.
All currently registered SRTP crypto suites except the GCM based ones use HMAC SHA1 as their HMAC algorithm to provide message authentication.
Due to security concerns with SHA 1
[RFC6194], the IETF is gradually moving away from SHA 1 and towards stronger hash algorithms such as SHA 2 or SHA 3 families.
For SRTP, however, SHA 1 is only used in the calculation of an HMAC, and no security issue is known for this usage at the time of this publication.
DTLS SRTP DTLS SRTP [RFC5764] defines a DTLS SRTP "SRTP protection profile".
In order to allow the use of the algorithms defined in this document in DTLS SRTP, IANA has added the following protection profiles below to the "DTLS SRTP Protection Profiles" registry (see <http://www.iana.org/assignments/srtp protection/>) created by [RFC5764]: SRTP ARIA 128 CTR HMAC SHA1 80
SRTP ARIA 128 CTR HMAC SHA1 32
SRTP ARIA 256 CTR HMAC SHA1 80
{0x00, 0x0D} SRTP ARIA 256 CTR HMAC SHA1 32   {0x00, 0x0E}
SRTP AEAD ARIA 128 GCM   {0x00, 0x0F}
SRTP AEAD ARIA 256 GCM   {0x00, 0x10} 6.2.
MIKEY [RFC3830] and [RFC5748] define encryption algorithms and PRFs for the SRTP policy in MIKEY.
In order to allow the use of the algorithms defined in this document in MIKEY, IANA has updated the "Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)
Payload Name Spaces" registry (see <http://www.iana.org/assignments/mikey payloads/
IANA has registered the following two encryption algorithms in the "Encryption algorithm (Value 0)" subregistry within the "MIKEY Security Protocol Parameters" registry:
key length is 16 octets.
IANA has registered the following PRF in the "SRTP Pseudo Random Function (Value 5)
All values are in hexadecimal and represented by the network order (called big endian).

The encrypted RTP payload is longer than the RTP payload by exactly the GCM authentication tag length (16 octets).
This section provides test vectors for the default key derivation function that uses ARIA in Counter Mode.
In the following, we walk through the initial key derivation for the ARIA Counter Mode cipher that requires a session encryption key of 16/24/32 octets according to the session encryption key length, a 14 octet session salt, and an authentication function that requires a 94 octet session authentication key.
These values are called the cipher key, the cipher salt, and the auth key in the following.
The test vectors are generated in the same way with the test vectors of key derivation functions in [RFC3711] and [RFC6188]
but with each invocation of AES replaced with an invocation of ARIA.
The inputs to the key derivation function are the 16 octet master key and the 14 octet master salt:

ARIA CTR protection profile requires a 14 octet cipher salt while ARIA GCM protection profile requires a 12 octet cipher salt.
Below, the auth key is shown on the left, while the corresponding ARIA input blocks are shown on the right.
The inputs to the key derivation function are the 32 octet master key and the 14 octet master salt:
ARIA CTR protection profile requires a 14 octet cipher salt while ARIA GCM protection profile requires a 12 octet cipher salt.
Below, the auth key is shown on the left, while the corresponding ARIA input blocks are shown on the right.
