  - "Abstract\n   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) update operations,\

    \ act upon an entry.  It is often desirable to update two or\n   more entries\

  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n\
    \   (LDAP) [RFC4510] to allow clients to relate a number of update\n   operations\
    \ [RFC4511] and have them performed as one unit of\n   interaction, a transaction.\
    \  As with distinct update operations, each\n   transaction has atomic, consistency,\
    \ isolation, and durability (ACID)\n   properties [ACID].\n   This extension consists\
    \ of two extended operations, one control, and\n   one unsolicited notification\
    \ message.  The Start Transaction\n   operation is used to obtain a transaction\
    \ identifier.  This\n   identifier is then attached to multiple update operations\
    \ to indicate\n   that they belong to the transaction using the Transaction\n\
    \   Specification control.  The End Transaction is used to settle (commit\n  \
    \ or abort) the transaction.  The Aborted Transaction Notice is\n   provided by\
    \ the server to notify the client that the server is no\n   longer willing or\
    \ able to process an outstanding transaction.\n"

  contents:

    \  with a Start Transaction Response providing a transaction identifier\n   and\

    \ the nature of the failure.\n   The transaction identifier provided upon successful\
    \ start of a\n   transaction is used in subsequent protocol messages to identify\
    \ this\n   transaction.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Specification of a Transaction
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Specification of a Transaction\n   The client then can issue one or more\
    \ update requests, each with a\n   Transaction Specification control containing\
    \ the transaction\n   identifier indicating the updates are to be processed as\
    \ part of the\n   transaction.  Each of these update requests MUST have a different\n\
    \   MessageID value.  If the server is unwilling or unable to attempt to\n   process\
    \ the requested update operation as part of the transaction,\n   the server immediately\
    \ returns the appropriate response to the\n   request with a resultCode indicating\
    \ the nature of the failure.\n   Otherwise, the server immediately returns a resultCode\
    \ of success (0)\n   and the defers further processing of the operation is then\
    \ deferred\n   until settlement.\n   If the server becomes unwilling or unable\
    \ to continue the\n   specification of a transaction, the server issues an Aborted\n\
    \   Transaction Notice with a non-success resultCode indicating the\n   nature\
    \ of the failure.  All operations that were to be processed as\n   part of the\
    \ transaction are implicitly abandoned.  Upon receipt of an\n   Aborted Transaction\
    \ Notice, the client is to discontinue all use of\n   the transaction identifier\
    \ as the transaction is null and void.  Any\n   future use of identifier by the\
    \ client will result in a response\n   containing a non-success resultCode.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Transaction Settlement
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Transaction Settlement\n   A client requests settlement of transaction\
    \ by issuing an End\n   Transaction Request for the transaction indicating whether\
    \ it desires\n   the transaction to be committed or aborted.\n   Upon receipt\
    \ of a request to abort the transaction, the server is to\n   abort the identified\
    \ transaction (abandoning all operations that are\n   part of the transaction)\
    \ and indicate that it has done so by\n   returning an End Transaction Response\
    \ with a resultCode of success\n   (0).\n   Upon receipt of a request to commit\
    \ the transaction, the server\n   processes all update operations of the transaction\
    \ as one atomic,\n   durable, isolated, and consistent action with each requested\
    \ update\n   being processed in turn.  Either all of the requested updates are\
    \ to\n   be successfully applied or none of the requested are to be applied.\n\
    \   The server returns an End Transaction Response with a resultCode of\n   success\
    \ (0) and no responseValue to indicate all the requested\n   updates were applied.\
    \  Otherwise, the server returns an End\n   Transaction Response with a non-success\
    \ resultCode indicating the\n   nature of the failure.  If the failure is associated\
    \ with a\n   particular update request, the txnEndRes.messageID in the\n   responseValue\
    \ is the message id of this update request.  If the\n   failure was not associated\
    \ with any particular update request, no\n   txnEnd.messageID is provided.\n \
    \  There is no requirement that a server serialize transactions or\n   updates\
    \ requested outside of a transaction.  That is, a server MAY\n   process multiple\
    \ commit requests (from one or more clients) acting\n   upon different sets of\
    \ entries concurrently.  A server MUST avoid\n   deadlock.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Miscellaneous Issues
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Miscellaneous Issues\n   Transactions cannot be nested.\n   Each LDAP transaction\
    \ should be initiated, specified, and settled\n   within a stable security context.\
    \  Between the Start Request and the\n   End Response, the peers SHOULD avoid\
    \ negotiating new security\n   associations and/or layers.\n   Upon receipt of\
    \ a Bind or Unbind request, the server SHALL abort any\n   and all outstanding\

- title: 4.4.  Proxied Authorization Control
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Proxied Authorization Control\n   The Proxied Authorization [RFC4370] control\
    \ is appropriate for use\n   with the Start Transaction Extended operation, but\
    \ not the End\n   Transaction Extended operation or any update request specified\
    \ as\n   part of a transaction.\n   To request that a transaction be performed\
    \ under a different\n   authorization, the client provides a Proxied Authorization\
    \ control\n   with the Transaction Start Request.  If the client is not authorized\n\
    \   to assume the requested authorization identity, the server is to\n   return\
    \ the authorizationDenied (123) resultCode in its response.\n   Otherwise, further\
    \ processing of the request and transaction is\n   performed under the requested\
    \ authorization identity.\n   Any proxied authorization request attached to an\
    \ update request\n   specified as part of a transaction, or attached to a Transaction\
    \ End\n   Request, is to be regarded as a protocol error.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Read Entry Controls
  contents:

    \ control are\n   appropriate for use with update requests specified as part of\
    \ a\n   transaction.\n   The response control produced in response to a Pre- or\
    \ Post-Read\n   Entry request control is returned in the txnEndRes.updatesControls\n\
    \   field of responseValue of the End Transaction Response.\n   The Pre- and Post-Read\

  contents:
  - "5.  Distributed Directory Considerations\n   The LDAP/X.500 models provide for\

    \ chasing of referrals.\n   This document does not preclude servers from chaining\
    \ operations that\n   are part of a transaction.  However, if a server does attempt\
    \ such\n   chaining, it MUST ensure that transaction semantics are provided.\n\
    \   The mechanism defined by this document does not support client-side\n   chasing.\
    \  Transaction identifiers are specific to a particular LDAP\n   association (as\
    \ established via the LDAP Bind operation).\n   The LDAP/X.500 models provide\
    \ for a single-master/multiple-shadow\n   replication architecture.  There is\
    \ no requirement that changes made\n   to the directory based upon processing\
    \ a transaction be replicated as\n   one atomic action.  Hence, clients SHOULD\
    \ NOT assume tight data\n   consistency nor fast data convergence of shadow copies\
    \ unless they\n   have prior knowledge that these properties are provided.  Note\
