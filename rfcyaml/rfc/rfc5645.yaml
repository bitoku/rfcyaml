  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4646] provides for a Language Subtag Registry and describes\
    \ its\n   format.  The initial contents of the registry and rules for\n   determining\
    \ them are specified in [RFC4645].\n   [RFC5646] expands on [RFC4646] by adding\
    \ support for approximately\n   7,500 new primary and extended language subtags\
    \ based on [ISO639-3]\n   and [ISO639-5] alpha-3 code elements, and seven new\
    \ region subtags\n   based on [ISO3166-1] exceptionally reserved code elements.\
    \  This memo\n   describes the process of updating the registry to include these\n\
    \   additional subtags and to make secondary changes to the registry that\n  \
    \ result from adding the new subtags and from other decisions made by\n   the\
    \ Language Tag Registry Update (LTRU) Working Group.\n   In writing this document,\
    \ a complete replacement of the contents of\n   the Language Subtag Registry was\
    \ provided to the Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority (IANA) to record the\
    \ necessary updates.\n   The format of the Language Subtag Registry as well as\
    \ the definition\n   and intended purpose of each of the fields are described\
    \ in\n   [RFC5646].\n   The registry is expected to change over time, as new subtags\
    \ are\n   registered and existing subtags are modified or deprecated.  The\n \
    \  process of updating the registry is described in Section 3 of\n   [RFC5646].\n\
    \   Many of the subtags defined in the Language Subtag Registry are based\n  \
    \ on code elements defined in [ISO639-1], [ISO639-2], [ISO639-3],\n   [ISO639-5],\
    \ [ISO3166-1], [ISO15924], and [UN_M.49].  The registry is\n   not a mirror of\
    \ the code lists defined by these standards and should\n   not be used as one.\n"
- title: 2.  Updating the Registry
  contents:
  - "2.  Updating the Registry\n   This section describes the process for determining\
    \ the updated\n   contents of the Language Subtag Registry.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Starting Point
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Starting Point\n   The version of the Language Subtag Registry that was\
    \ current at the\n   time of IESG approval of this memo served as the starting\
    \ point for\n   this update.  This version was created according to the process\n\
    \   described in [RFC4645] and maintained according to the process\n   described\
    \ in [RFC4646].\n   The source data for [ISO639-3] used for this update consisted\
    \ of\n   three files, available from the official site of the ISO 639-3\n   Registration\
    \ Authority.  (Note that this file is updated from time to\n   time.  The version\
    \ used in the preparation of this memo was the one\n   in place on February 24,\
    \ 2009.)\n   o  [iso-639-3_20090210] is a list of all language code elements in\n\
    \      [ISO639-3], including the alpha-3 code element and reference name\n   \
    \   for each code element.  For example, the entry for the Dari\n      language\
    \ contained the code element 'prs' and the name \"Dari\"\n      (among other information).\n\
    \   o  [iso-639-3_Name_Index_20090210] is a list containing all names\n      associated\
    \ with each language according to [ISO639-3], including\n      both inverted and\
    \ non-inverted forms where appropriate.  An\n      \"inverted\" name is one that\
    \ is altered from the usual English-\n      language order by moving adjectival\
    \ qualifiers to the end, after\n      the main language name and separated by\
    \ a comma.  A code element\n      may have more than one entry in this file; the\
    \ reference name and\n      its inverted form are usually, but not always, given\
    \ in the first\n      entry.  For example, this file contained an entry for the\
    \ code\n      element 'prs' with the name \"Dari\" (twice) and another entry with\n\
    \      the names \"Eastern Farsi\" and \"Farsi, Eastern\".\n   o  [iso-639-3-macrolanguages_20090120]\
    \ is a list of all alpha-3 code\n      elements for languages that are encompassed\
    \ by a macrolanguage in\n      [ISO639-3], together with the alpha-3 code element\
    \ for the\n      macrolanguage.  For example, a line containing the code elements\n\
    \      'fas' and 'prs' indicated that the macrolanguage \"Persian\"\n      encompasses\
    \ the individual language \"Dari\".  (Note that these\n      alpha-3 code elements\
    \ may not have corresponded directly to\n      subtags in the registry, which\
    \ uses 2-letter subtags derived from\n      [ISO639-1] when possible.)\n   The\
    \ source data for [ISO639-5] used for this update consisted of one\n   file, available\
    \ from the official site of the ISO 639-5 Registration\n   Authority.  (Note that\
    \ this file is updated from time to time.  The\n   version used in the preparation\
    \ of this memo was the one in place on\n   February 24, 2009.)\n   o  [iso639-5.tab.txt]\
    \ is a list of all language code elements in\n      [ISO639-5], including the\
    \ alpha-3 code elements and English name\n      for each code element.  For example,\
    \ this file includes an entry\n      containing the code element 'ira' and the\
    \ name \"Iranian languages\"\n      (among other information).\n   Language code\
    \ elements that were already retired in all of the source\n   standards prior\
    \ to IESG approval of this memo were not listed in\n   these files and, consequently,\
    \ were not considered in this update.\n   The values of the File-Date field, the\
    \ Added date for each new subtag\n   record, and the Deprecated date for each\
    \ existing grandfathered or\n   redundant tag deprecated by this update were set\
    \ to a date as near as\n   practical to the date this memo was approved for publication\
    \ by IESG.\n"
- title: 2.2.  New Language Subtags
  contents:
  - "2.2.  New Language Subtags\n   For each language in [ISO639-3] that was not already\
    \ represented by a\n   language subtag in the Language Subtag Registry, a new\
    \ language\n   subtag was added to the registry, using the [ISO639-3] code element\n\
    \   as the value for the Subtag field and using each of the non-inverted\n   [ISO639-3]\
    \ names as a separate Description field.  The [ISO639-3]\n   reference name is\
    \ represented by the first Description field.\n   If the language was encompassed\
    \ by one of the [ISO639-3]\n   macrolanguages 'ar' (Arabic), 'kok' (Konkani),\
    \ 'ms' (Malay), 'sw'\n   (Swahili), 'uz' (Uzbek), or 'zh' (Chinese), as determined\
    \ by\n   [iso-639-3-macrolanguages_20090120], an extended language subtag was\n\
    \   also added, with the primary language subtag of the macrolanguage as\n   the\
    \ value for the Prefix field.  These macrolanguage subtags were\n   already present\
    \ in the Language Subtag Registry and were chosen\n   because they were determined\
    \ by the LTRU Working Group to have been\n   used to represent a single dominant\
    \ language as well as the\n   macrolanguage as a whole, making the extended language\
    \ mechanism\n   suitable for languages encompassed by the macrolanguage.\n   If\
    \ the name of the language included the word \"Sign\", an extended\n   language\
    \ subtag was added, with the string \"sgn\" as the value for the\n   Prefix field.\
    \  This is a special case that treats the existing\n   primary language subtag\
    \ for \"Sign languages\" as if it were a\n   macrolanguage encompassing all sign\
    \ languages.\n   All extended language subtags were added with a Preferred-Value\
    \ equal\n   to the corresponding primary language subtag.\n   If the language\
    \ was encompassed by a macrolanguage, as determined by\n   [iso-639-3-macrolanguages_20090120],\
    \ a Macrolanguage field was added\n   for the encompassed language, with a value\
    \ equal to the subtag of the\n   macrolanguage.  (Note that 'sgn' is defined as\
    \ a \"collection code\" by\n   [ISO639-3] and hence is not included in that standard;\
    \ therefore, no\n   Macrolanguage field was added for sign language subtags.)\n\
    \   If the language was assigned a \"Scope\" value of 'M' (Macrolanguage)\n  \
    \ in [iso-639-3_20090210], a Scope value of \"macrolanguage\" was added\n   for\
    \ the language.  Otherwise, if the language was assigned a \"Scope\"\n   value\
    \ of 'S' (Special), a Scope value of \"special\" was added.  Most\n   languages\
    \ in [ISO639-3] have scope 'I' (Individual) and thus were not\n   assigned a Scope\
    \ value in the registry.\n   For each language in [iso639-5.tab.txt] that was\
    \ not already\n   represented by a language subtag in the Language Subtag Registry,\
    \ a\n   new language subtag was added to the registry, using the [ISO639-5]\n\
    \   code element as the value for the Subtag field and using the \"English\n \
    \  name\" field as the Description field.  Each of these languages was\n   assigned\
    \ a Scope value of \"collection\" in the registry.\n   All subtags were added\
    \ to the registry maintaining alphabetical order\n   within each type of subtag:\
    \ all 2-letter \"language\" subtags first,\n   then all 3-letter \"language\"\
    \ subtags, and finally all \"extlang\"\n   subtags.  Some existing records were\
    \ moved to ensure this order.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Modified Language Subtags
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Modified Language Subtags\n   For each language in [ISO639-3] that was\
    \ already represented by a\n   language subtag in the Language Subtag Registry,\
    \ Description fields\n   were added as necessary to reflect all non-inverted names\
    \ listed for\n   that language in [iso-639-3_Name_Index_20090210].  Any existing\n\
    \   Description fields that reflected inverted names or that represented\n   a\
    \ strict subset of the information provided by the [ISO639-3] name\n   were deleted.\
    \  An example of the latter was the name \"Ainu\" for the\n   subtag 'ain', which\
    \ provided less information than the [ISO639-3]\n   name \"Ainu (Japan)\".\n \
    \  The order of Description fields was adjusted to ensure that the\n   reference\
    \ name from [ISO639-3] was listed first, followed by other\n   names from [ISO639-3]\
    \ in the order presented by that standard,\n   followed by any other names already\
    \ existing in the registry.  In\n   some cases, this resulted in a reordering\
    \ of Description fields for\n   existing entries, even when no new values were\
    \ added.\n   For each language that was encompassed by a macrolanguage in\n  \
    \ [ISO639-3], a Macrolanguage field was added, with a value equal to\n   the subtag\
    \ of the macrolanguage.\n   For each language in [iso639-5.tab.txt] that was already\
    \ represented\n   in the Language Subtag Registry, the Description field was adjusted\n\
    \   as necessary to match the \"English name\" field in [iso639-5.tab.txt].\n\
    \   Names in inverted form were rearranged to remove the inversion.  Each\n  \
    \ of these languages was assigned a Scope value of \"collection\".\n   Existing\
    \ language subtags whose code elements were assigned prior to\n   the publication\
    \ of [ISO639-3] or [ISO639-5] and that were identified\n   by the [ISO639-3] Registration\
    \ Authority as representing collections\n   were also assigned a Scope value of\
    \ \"collection\", even though they\n   are not listed as such in [iso639-5.tab.txt].\n\
    \   Note in particular that the change from [ISO639-2] names such as\n   \"Afro-Asiatic\
    \ (Other)\" to [ISO639-5] names such as \"Afro-Asiatic\n   languages\" implies\
    \ a broadening of scope for some of these subtags,\n   designated \"remainder\
    \ groups\" in [ISO639-5].  While\n   [iso639-5.tab.txt] includes a field indicating\
    \ which code elements\n   are designated as \"groups\" or \"remainder groups\"\
    \ in [ISO639-2],\n   [RFC5646] does not make this distinction, and consequently\
    \ this field\n   was not used in updating the Language Subtag Registry.\n   A\
    \ Scope value of \"private-use\" was added for the unique record with\n   Subtag\
    \ value 'qaa..qtz'.  This record has a Description of \"Private\n   use\" (changed\
    \ from \"PRIVATE USE\") and corresponds to a range of code\n   elements that is\
    \ reserved for private use in [ISO639-2].  The\n   Description fields for script\
    \ and region private-use subtags were\n   also capitalized as \"Private use\"\
    .\n"
- title: 2.4.  New Region Subtags
  contents:
  - "2.4.  New Region Subtags\n   [RFC5646] expands the scope of region subtags by\
    \ adding subtags based\n   on code elements defined as \"exceptionally reserved\"\
    \ in [ISO3166-1].\n   These code elements are reserved by the ISO 3166 Maintenance\
    \ Agency\n   \"at the request of national ISO member bodies, governments and\n\
    \   international organizations\".  At the time of IESG approval of this\n   memo,\
    \ ISO 3166/MA had defined nine exceptionally reserved code\n   elements, all of\
    \ which were added to the Language Subtag Registry\n   except for the following:\n\
    \   o  'FX' (Metropolitan France) was already present in the Language\n      Subtag\
    \ Registry because it was an assigned [ISO3166-1] code\n      element from 1993\
    \ to 1997, but was deprecated with a Preferred-\n      Value of \"FR\".\n   o\
    \  'UK' (United Kingdom) was not added because it is associated with\n      the\
    \ same UN M.49 code (826) as the existing region subtag 'GB'.\n      [RFC5646],\
    \ Section 3.4, item 15 (D) states that a new region\n      subtag is not added\
    \ to the Language Subtag Registry if it carries\n      the same meaning as an\
    \ existing region subtag.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Grandfathered and Redundant Tags
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Grandfathered and Redundant Tags\n   As stated in [RFC5646], \"grandfathered\"\
    \ and \"redundant\" tags are\n   complete tags in the Language Subtag Registry\
    \ that were registered\n   under [RFC1766] or [RFC3066] and remain valid.  Grandfathered\
    \ tags\n   cannot be generated from a valid combination of subtags, while\n  \
    \ redundant tags can be.\n   Under certain conditions, registration of a subtag\
    \ under [RFC5646]\n   may cause a grandfathered tag to be reclassified as redundant.\
    \  It\n   may also enable the creation of a generative tag with the same\n   meaning\
    \ as a grandfathered or redundant tag; in that case, the\n   grandfathered or\
    \ redundant tag is marked as Deprecated, and the\n   generative tag (including\
    \ the new subtag) becomes its Preferred-\n   Value.\n   As a result of adding\
    \ the new subtags in this update, each of the\n   following grandfathered tags\
    \ became composable, were reclassified as\n   redundant, and were deprecated with\
    \ the indicated generative tag\n   serving as the Preferred-Value:\n      zh-cmn\

    \ see below)\n      zh-min-nan (Preferred-Value: nan)\n      zh-xiang (Preferred-Value:\
    \ hns)\n   The tag \"zh-min\", originally registered under [RFC1766], is a special\n\
    \   case: it represents a small class of Chinese languages, but is not a\n   true\
    \ macrolanguage.  The string \"min\" could not ever be used to tag\n   these languages\
    \ since the [ISO639-3] code element 'min' is assigned\n   to an individual language\
    \ (Minangkabau) that is not related to\n   Chinese ('zh').  Because it is not\
    \ believed to represent a useful\n   linguistic entity for tagging purposes, it\
    \ was deprecated without a\n   Preferred-Value.\n   The following grandfathered\
    \ and redundant sign language tags were\n   deprecated, with the indicated generative\
    \ tag serving as the\n   Preferred-Value:\n      sgn-BE-FR (Preferred-Value: sfb)\n\

    \ prior to [RFC4646] remain an\n   exception to the general principle that the\
    \ meaning of a non-\n   grandfathered tag can be derived from its component subtags.\n\
    \   In previous versions of the registry, grandfathered tags that had\n   been\
    \ deprecated as a result of adding an ISO 639-based language\n   subtag included\
    \ a Comments field, with a value of the form \"replaced\n   by ISO code xxx\"\
    , where 'xxx' represented the new language subtag.\n   These comments duplicated\
    \ the information contained within the\n   Preferred-Value field and were deleted\
    \ as part of this update.  No\n   changes were made to other Comments fields.\n"

    \ rather than identifying alternative\n   names; these fields were not altered.\n\
    \   This situation does not apply to region subtags taken from\n   [ISO3166-1]\
    \ and [UN_M.49] because those standards do not provide\n   freely available alternative\
    \ names for code elements.\n   Description fields in inverted form for script\
    \ and region subtags\n   were rearranged to remove the inversion, for consistency\
    \ with the\n   handling of language subtags in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.  For example,\n\
    \   the Description field \"Korea, Republic of\" was changed to \"Republic\n \
    \  of Korea\".\n   The capitalization of the Subtag fields for certain grandfathered\
    \ and\n   redundant tags (sgn-BE-fr, sgn-BE-nl, sgn-CH-de, and yi-latn) was\n\
    \   modified to conform with the capitalization conventions described in\n   [RFC5646],\
    \ Section 2.1.1.  This has no effect on the validity or\n   meaning of these tags.\n\
    \   The Description field for subtag 'sgn' was capitalized as \"Sign\n   languages\"\
    \ to match the capitalization used for other languages in\n   [ISO639-5], even\
    \ though this capitalization does not exactly match\n   that used for code element\
    \ 'sgn' in any of the ISO 639 parts.\n   The Deprecated field for the region subtag\
    \ TP was modified from 2002-\n   11-15 to 2002-05-20, to correct a clerical error.\
    \  The corrected date\n   reflects the actual date the code element TP was withdrawn\
    \ in\n   [ISO3166-1].\n   The order of fields within records in the registry was\
    \ adjusted as\n   necessary to match the order in which these fields are described\
    \ in\n   [RFC5646], Section 3.1.2.  This ordering is not required by [RFC5646]\n\
    \   and may not necessarily be reflected in future additions or\n   modifications\
    \ to the registry.\n"
