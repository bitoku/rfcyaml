  - "Received at NIC 21-Sept-73\n         Response to RFC 567 -- Cross-Country Network\
    \ Bandwidth\nThis note serves as a brief correction to several fundamental errors\
    \ in\n1.  Not all packets are 1000 bits long.  This is basic to the network\n\
    \    design.\n2.  RFNMs are 152 bits long (72 bits of hardware framing and 80\
    \ bits of\n    software identification and addressing). Host Host protocol messages\n\
    \    such as single-characters and allocates are 216 bits long (40 bits\n    of\
    \ Host protocol, 8 bits for the character or ALL, and an additional\n    16 bits\
    \ of IMP software header).  This totals to 736 bits in each\n    direction, not\
    \ 4000.\n3.  The number of single-character messages that can be supported is\n\
    \    therefore over 200 per second, not 37.5 per second.  Not only is\n    such\
    \ a traffic pattern unlikely, but it can be supported in the IMP\n    subnetwork\
    \ much more readily than in most Hosts.\n4.  Furthermore, if the demand for remote\
    \ echoing ever exceeds network\n    capacity, the TIPs and Hosts can simply buffer\
    \ 2 characters per\n    message, doubling the effective bandwidth of the network.\
    \  Of\n    course, dozens of characters can be packed into a single message\n\
    \    with nearly proportional increases in effective bandwidth, given the\n  \
    \  size of the overhead.  This buffering happens automatically and\n    incrementally\
    \ with increasing load as the natural consequence of\n    slowed responses.\n\
    5.  It is most likely that the poor echoing response cited by Deutsch is\n   \
    \ not caused by peak network loads.  If echoing was coming in 5-\n    character\
    \ bursts, there would have to be _1000_ characters per\n    second coming from\
    \ users of remote-echo systems to use all the\n    capacity of 3 50-kilobit paths.\n\
    6.  This reasoning points up the more serious error in RFC 567:  the\n    problems\
    \ associated with bad echo response are delay problems, not\n    bandwidth.  In\
    \ designing the IMP software, we have used a bimodal\n    model of traffic, and\
    \ attempted to provide low delay for interactive\n    traffic, and high throughput\
    \ rates for bulk data transfers.  It is\n    pointless to try for high data rates\
    \ with short messages - the\n    overhead in bits, and also in IMP and Host processor\
    \ wake-ups, is\n    too high.  The primary factor in echoing performance is delay.\
    \  As\n    an extreme example, echoing over a megabit per second satellite link\n\
    \    will lag a second or more behind input, with no bandwidth\n    limitations\
    \ at all.\n7.  We agree that changes to TELNET protocol may well improve\n   \
    \ performance by reducing network traffic, and, more importantly,\n    reducing\
    \ demands for Host processing.  In cases of network paths\n    with long delay,\
    \ especially satellite links, such changes are\n    essential for interactive\
    \ echoing.\nJMcQ/jm\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for\
