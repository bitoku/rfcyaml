    \ Requirements to provide an Internet Directory using X.500\nStatus of this Memo\n\
    \    This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It\n    does\
    \ not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo\n    is unlimited.\n\
    Abstract\n    This RFCconsiders certain deficiencies of the 1988 X.500\n    standard,\
    \ which need to be addressed before an effective open\n    Internet Directory\
    \ can be established using these protocols and\n    services [CCI88].  The only\
    \ areas considered are primary\n    problems, to which solutions must be found\
    \ before a pilot can be\nRFC 1275            Replication Requirements        \
    \     November 1991\n1  Distributed Operation Extensions\nThe Internet Directory\
    \ will operate DSAs over TCP/IP using RFC 1006\n[RC87], and DSAs over the an ISO\
    \ Network Service.  Distributed\noperation procedures should not require full\
    \ connectivity.\n2  Knowledge Replication\nKnowledge information is critical to\
    \ resolution of names, and\nperforming searches.  Knowledge information high up\
    \ the tree needs to\nbe widely available.  Consider resolving a name below ``Country=US''.\n\
    To do this, a DSA needs to have full knowledge at this point.  Many\nDSAs need\
    \ to be able to do this, in order to give reasonable response\nand availability.\
    \  It would be an unacceptable bottleneck to force\nsuch resolution to a single\
    \ or small number of DSAs.  To replicate\nthis knowledge widely, a systematic\
    \ approach to replication is needed.\n3  Data Replication\nSearches are often\
    \ made at the root and country level, and this is a\nvital service (e.g., an approximate\
    \ match of an organisation name).\nData needs to be collected in such a way that\
    \ this sort of searching\nis reasonably efficient.  The usual X.500 approach of\
    \ subordinate\nreferences militates against this.  At a node in the DIT, subordinate\n\
    references to the entries below are held.  These entries will be in\nmany DSAs,\
    \ each of which needs to be accessed in order to perform the\nsingle level search.\
    \  It is suggested that replication of data is\nnecessary to achieve this.\nThe\
    \ major requirement for this replication is high up the DIT, where\ninformation\
    \ must be replicated between different implementations.  At\nlower levels of the\
    \ DIT, it is reasonable for DSAs to be of the same\nimplementation and to use\
    \ implementation specific techniques in order\nto achieve performance and availability.\n\
    4  Alternate DSAs\nWhen a DSA Referral is returned, only the master DSA is indicated.\n\
    This will lead to a single point of failure.  It seems important to\nallow for\
    \ additional references to slave copies, in order to get\nRFC 1275           \
    \ Replication Requirements             November 1991\nbetter availability.  This\
    \ needs to be solved in conjunction with the\nproblem described in the previous\
    \ section.\n5  Guidelines for use of Replication\nTo be effective, the replication\
    \ specification needs to provide\nguidelines for deployment in the pilot, in order\
    \ to meet the desired\nservice criteria.\n6  Some scaling targets\nMost techniques\
    \ for replication have scaling limits.  It is important\nthat mechanisms used\
    \ do not stress the limits of the mechanism.  The\norder of magnitude envisioned\
    \ in the pilot is 100 000 non-leaf entries\nand several million leaf entries.\n\
