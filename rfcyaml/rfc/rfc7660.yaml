  - "Abstract\n   This document defines optional Diameter attributes that can be used\n
    \  to help manage networks that use Explicit Congestion Notification\n   (ECN)
    or Diameter traffic filters.  These new attributes allow for\n   improved data
    traffic identification, support of ECN, and minimal\n   Diameter filter administration.\n
    \  RFC 5777 defines a Filter-Rule Attribute Value Pair (AVP) that\n   accommodates
    extensions for classification, conditions, and actions.\n   It, however, does
    not support traffic identification for packets\n   using Explicit Congestion Notification
    as defined in RFC 3168 and\n   does not provide specific actions when the flow(s)
    described by the\n   Filter-Rule are congested.\n   Further, a Filter-Rule can
    describe multiple flows but not the exact\n   number of flows.  Flow count and
    other associated data (e.g.,\n   packets) are not captured by accounting applications,
    leaving\n   administrators without useful information regarding the effectiveness\n
    \  or appropriateness of the filter definition.\n   The optional attributes defined
    in this document are forward and\n   backwards compatible with RFC 5777.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Two optional AVPs related to Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN)\n   [RFC3168] are specified in this document.  The first AVP provides\n
    \  direct support for filtering ECN-marked traffic [RFC3168] and the\n   second
    AVP provides the ability to define alternate traffic treatment\n   when congestion
    is experienced.\n   This document also defines two optional AVPs, Flow-Count and
    Packet-\n   Count, used for conveying flow information within the Diameter\n   protocol
    [RFC6733].  These AVPs were found to be useful for a wide\n   range of applications.
    \ The AVPs provide a way to convey information\n   of the group of flows described
    by the Filter-Rule, IPFilterRule, or\n   other Diameter traffic filters.\n   The
    semantics and encoding of all AVPs can be found in Section 3.\n   Such AVPs are,
    for example, needed by some congestion-management\n   functions to determine the
    number of flows congested or used by\n   administrators to determine the impact
    of filter definitions.\n   Additional parameters may be defined in future documents
    as the need\n   arises.  All parameters are defined as Diameter-encoded Attribute\n
    \  Value Pairs (AVPs), which are described using a modified version of\n   the
    Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF), see [RFC6733].  The data types\n   are also
    taken from [RFC6733].\n"

      \           Figure 1: Example of a Diameter Credit Control with\n                          Congestion
      Information\n   The 'Used-Service-Units' described in RFC 5777 examples is\n
      \  customarily a Service-Units, Time-Units, or Byte-Count AVP.  This is\n   insufficient
      to represent network state and does not differentiate\n   between throughput
      and good-put (good or quality throughput) even\n   though the filters may imply
      good or poor throughput.\n   Flow-Count and Packet-Count AVPs defined in this
      document could be\n   sent with a CCR when the triggering event is related to
      Congestion-\n   Treatment.  This provides the CC Server with a better view of
      the\n   type of congested traffic for improved decision making and charging.\n
      \  Sending such AVPs under any condition permits rudimentary traffic\n   profiling
      regardless of network conditions.  For instance, low byte\n   counts per packet
      is indicative of web traffic and high byte counts\n   per packet with a small
      number of flows may be indicative of video\n   traffic.  Enriched reporting
      described here provides relief from Deep\n   Packet Inspection load and loss
      of information as traffic becomes\n   increasingly encrypted.\n   Some services,
      e.g., streaming services, limit the number of flows,\n   Flow-Count, as opposed
      to other units, i.e. Byte-Count.  In such a\n   case, the Flow-Count AVP may
      be used in place of Service-Units.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes an extension of RFC 5777
    that introduces a\n   new filter parameter applied to ECN as defined by [RFC3168].
    \ It also\n   defines a new Grouped AVP that expresses what action to take should\n
    \  congestion be detected.  The Grouped AVP reuses attributes defined in\n   RFC
    5777.  As these are extensions to RFC 5777, they do not raise new\n   security
    concerns.\n   The Flow-Count and Packet-Count AVPs can be provided in conjunction\n
    \  with customary AVPs, e.g., Bytes, Time, Service units, during\n   accounting
    activities as described in the base protocol [RFC6733] or\n   other Diameter applications.
    \ These new AVPs provide more information\n   that can be privacy sensitive.  The
    privacy sensitivity is directly\n   related to traffic captured by filters and
    associated reports.\n   Narrow filtering, which creates the highest level of privacy\n
    \  sensitivity, is too resource intensive to be widely applied on large\n   networks.
    \ Paradoxically, improving reporting information lessens the\n   depth of inspection
    required to characterize traffic for many\n   congestion management activities
    as noted in Section 5.2.\n   If an administrator can provide congestion actions
    without the need\n   to report them to a Diameter application, they should use
    the\n   Congestion-Treatment AVP, which also reduces Diameter traffic during\n
    \  congestion events.\n   The Security Considerations of the Diameter protocol
    itself have been\n   discussed in RFC 6733 [RFC6733].  Use of the AVPs defined
    in this\n   document MUST take into consideration the security issues and\n   requirements
    of the Diameter base protocol.\n"
