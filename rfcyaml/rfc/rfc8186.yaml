  - "1.  Introduction\n   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) [RFC4656]
    defines\n   that only the NTP format [RFC5905] of a timestamp can be used in the\n
    \  OWAMP-Test protocol.  The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)\n   [RFC5357]
    adopted the OWAMP-Test packet format and extended it by\n   adding a format for
    a reflected test packet.  Both the sender's and\n   reflector's packets timestamps
    are expected to follow the 64-bit-long\n   NTP format [RFC5905].  NTP, when used
    over the Internet, typically\n   achieves clock accuracy within 5 ms to 100 ms.
    \ Surveys conducted\n   recently suggest that 90% of devices achieve accuracy
    better than 100\n   ms and 99% of devices achieve accuracy better than 1 sec.
    \ It should\n   be noted that NTP synchronizes clocks on the control plane, not
    on\n   data plane.  Distribution of clock within a node may be supported by\n
    \  an independent NTP domain or via interprocess communication in a\n   multiprocessor
    distributed system.  Any of the mentioned solutions\n   will be subject to additional
    queuing delays that negatively affect\n   data-plane clock accuracy.\n   The Precision
    Time Protocol (PTP) [IEEE.1588] has gained wide support\n   since the development
    of OWAMP and TWAMP.  PTP, using on-path support\n   and other mechanisms, allows
    sub-microsecond clock accuracy.  PTP is\n   now supported in multiple implementations
    of fast-forwarding engines;\n   thus, accuracy achieved by PTP is the accuracy
    of the clock in the\n   data plane.  Having an option to use a more accurate clock
    as a\n   source of timestamps for IP performance measurements is one of the\n
    \  advantages of this specification.  Another advantage is realized by\n   simplification
    of hardware in the data plane.  To support OWAMP or\n   TWAMP, test protocol timestamps
    must be converted from PTP to NTP.\n   That requires resources, use of microcode
    or additional processing\n   elements, that are always limited.  To address this,
    this document\n   proposes optional extensions to Control and Test protocols to
    support\n   use of the IEEE 1588v2 timestamp format as an optional alternative
    to\n   the NTP timestamp format.\n   One of the goals of this specification is
    not only to allow endpoints\n   of a test session to use a timestamp format other
    than NTP, but to\n   support backwards compatibility with nodes that do not yet
    support\n   this extension.\n"

  - "2.  OWAMP and TWAMP Extensions\n   OWAMP connection establishment follows the
    procedure defined in\n   Section 3.1 of [RFC4656] and additional steps in TWAMP
    described in\n   Section 3.1 of [RFC5357].  In these procedures, the Modes field
    has\n   been used to identify and select specific communication capabilities.\n
    \  At the same time, the Modes field has been recognized and used as an\n   extension
    mechanism [RFC6038].  The new feature requires one bit\n   position for the Server
    and Control-Client to negotiate which\n   timestamp format can be used in some
    or all test sessions invoked\n   with this control connection.  The endpoint of
    the test session,\n   Session-Sender and Session-Receiver (for OWAMP) or Session-Reflector\n
    \  (for TWAMP), that supports this extension MUST be capable of\n   interpreting
    the NTP and PTPv2 timestamp formats.  If the endpoint\n   does not support this
    extension, then the value of the PTPv2\n   Timestamp flag MUST be 0 because it
    is in Must Be Zero field.  If the\n   value of the PTPv2 Timestamp flag is 0,
    then the advertising node can\n   use and interpret only the NTP timestamp format.
    \ Implementations of\n   OWAMP and/or TWAMP MAY provide a configuration knob to
    bypass the\n   timestamp format negotiation process and use the locally configured\n
    \  values instead.\n   Use of PTPv2 Timestamp flags is discussed in the following\n
    \  subsections.  For details on the assigned values and bit positions,\n   see
    the Section 3.\n"

    - "2.1.  Timestamp Format Negotiation in OWAMP Connection Setup\n   In OWAMP-Test
      [RFC4656], the Session-Receiver and/or Fetch-Client\n   interpret collected
      timestamps.  Thus, the Server uses the Modes\n   field timestamp format to indicate
      which formats the Session-Receiver\n   is capable of interpreting.  The Control-Client
      inspects values set\n   by the Server for timestamp formats and sets values
      in the Modes\n   field of the Set-Up-Response message according to the timestamp\n
      \  formats the Session-Sender can use.  The rules for setting timestamp\n   flags
      in the Modes field in Server Greeting and Set-Up-Response\n   messages and interpreting
      them are as follows:\n   o  If the Session-Receiver supports this extension,
      then the Server\n      that establishes test sessions on its behalf MUST set
      the PTPv2\n      Timestamp flag to 1 in the Server Greeting message per the\n
      \     requirement listed in Section 2.  Otherwise, the PTPv2 Timestamp\n      flag
      will be set to 0 to indicate that the Session-Receiver\n      interprets only
      the NTP format.\n   o  If the Control-Client receives a greeting message with
      the PTPv2\n      Timestamp flag set to 0, then the Session-Sender MUST use the
      NTP\n      format for the timestamp in the test session, and the Control-\n
      \     Client SHOULD set the PTPv2 Timestamp flag to 0 in accordance with\n      [RFC4656].
      \ If the Session-Sender cannot use NTP timestamps, then\n      the Control-Client
      SHOULD close the TCP connection associated with\n      the OWAMP-Control session.\n
      \  o  If the Control-Client receives a greeting message with the PTPv2\n      Timestamp
      flag set to 1 and the Session-Sender can set the\n      timestamp in PTPv2 format,
      then the Control-Client MUST set the\n      PTPv2 Timestamp flag to 1 in the
      Modes field in the Set-Up-\n      Response message and the Session-Sender MUST
      use PTPv2 timestamp\n      format.\n   o  If the Session-Sender doesn't support
      this extension and can set\n      the timestamp in NTP format only, then the
      PTPv2 Timestamp flag in\n      the Modes field in the Set-Up-Response message
      will be set to 0 as\n      part of the Must Be Zero field and the Session-Sender
      will use the\n      NTP format.\n   If OWAMP-Control uses Fetch-Session commands,
      then selection and use\n   of one timestamp format or another is a local decision

    - "2.2.  Timestamp Format Negotiation in TWAMP Connection Setup\n   In TWAMP-Test
      [RFC5357], the Session-Sender interprets collected\n   timestamps.  Hence, in
      the Modes field, a Server advertises timestamp\n   formats that the Session-Reflector
      can use in the TWAMP-Test message.\n   The choice of the timestamp format to
      be used by the Session-Sender\n   is a local decision.  The Control-Client inspects
      the Modes field and\n   sets timestamp flag values to indicate the format that
      will be used\n   by the Session-Reflector.  The rules of setting and interpreting
      flag\n   values are as follows:\n   o  The Server MUST set the PTPv2 Timestamp
      flag value to 1 in its\n      greeting message if the Session-Reflector can
      set the timestamp in\n      the PTPv2 format.  Otherwise, the PTPv2 Timestamp
      flag MUST be set\n      to 0.\n   o  If the value of the PTPv2 Timestamp flag
      in the received Server\n      Greeting message is 0, then the Session-Reflector
      does not support\n      this extension and will use the NTP timestamp format.
      \ The\n      Control-Client SHOULD set the PTPv2 Timestamp flag to 0 in the\n
      \     Set-Up-Response message in accordance with [RFC4656].\n   o  The Control-Client
      MUST set the PTPv2 Timestamp flag value to 1 in\n      the Modes field in the
      Set-Up-Response message if the Server\n      advertised that the Session-Reflector
      has the ability to use the\n      PTPv2 format for timestamps.  Otherwise, the
      flag MUST be set to\n      0.\n   o  If the value of the PTPv2 Timestamp flag
      in the Set-Up-Response\n      message is 0, then that means that the Session-Sender
      can only\n      interpret the NTP timestamp format.  Therefore, the Session-\n
      \     Reflector MUST use the NTP timestamp format.  If the Session-\n      Reflector
      does not support the NTP format, then the Server MUST\n      close the TCP connection
      associated with the TWAMP-Control\n      session.\n"

    - "2.3.  OWAMP-Test and TWAMP-Test Updates\n   Participants of a test session
      need to indicate which timestamp\n   format is being used.  Currently, the Z
      field in the Error Estimate\n   defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC4656] is used
      for this purpose.\n   However, this document extends the Error Estimate to indicate
      the\n   format of a collected timestamp, in addition to the estimate of error\n
      \  and synchronization.  This specification also changes the semantics\n   of
      the Z bit field (the field between S and Scale fields) to be\n   referred to
      as the Timestamp format; the value MUST be set as\n   follows:\n   o  0 - NTP
      64-bit format of a timestamp.\n   o  1 - PTPv2-truncated format of a timestamp.\n
      \  As a result of this value of the Z field from the Error Estimate, the\n   Sender
      Error Estimate (in TWAMP) or Send Error Estimate (in OWAMP)\n   and Receive
      Error Estimate SHOULD NOT be ignored and MUST be used\n   when calculating delay
