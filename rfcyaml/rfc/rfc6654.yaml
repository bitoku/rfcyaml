  - "Abstract\n   This document proposes an alternative IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4\n\
    \   Infrastructures (6rd) deployment model to that of RFC 5969.  The\n   basic\
    \ 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 networks\n   across an IPv4\
    \ access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd requires\n   support by a device (the\
    \ 6rd customer edge, or 6rd-CE) on the\n   customer site, which must also be assigned\
    \ an IPv4 address.  The\n   alternative model described in this document initiates\
    \ the 6-in-4\n   tunnels from an operator-owned Gateway collocated with the operator's\n\
    \   IPv4 network edge rather than from customer equipment, and hence is\n   termed\
    \ \"Gateway-initiated 6rd\" (GI 6rd).  The advantages of this\n   approach are\
    \ that it requires no modification to customer equipment\n   and avoids assignment\
    \ of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The\n   latter point means less pressure\
    \ on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth\n   environment.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   6rd [RFC5969] provides a transition tool for connecting\
    \ IPv6 devices\n   across an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network, at which point the\
    \ packets\n   can be routed natively.  The network topology is shown in Figure\

    \  In Figure 1, the CE is the customer edge router.  It is provisioned\n   with\
    \ a delegated IPv6 prefix, but it is also configured with an IPv4\n   address\
    \ so that it is reachable through the IPv4 network.  If a\n   public IPv4 address\
    \ is provisioned to every customer, it will\n   aggravate the pressure due to\
    \ the IPv4 address shortage for operators\n   faced with a high rate of growth\
    \ in the number of broadband\n   subscribers to their network.  The use of private\
    \ addresses with 6rd\n   avoids this particular difficulty but brings other complications.\n"

  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   Consider an operator facing a high subscriber growth\
    \ rate.  As a\n   result of this growth rate, the operator faces pressure on its\
    \ stock\n   of available public IPv4 addresses.  For this reason, the operator\
    \ is\n   motivated to offer IPv6 access as quickly as possible.  Figure 2\n  \
    \ shows the sort of network situation envisioned in the present\n   document.\n\

    \     Host = IPv6 customer host device\n     CPE  = customer edge device (customer-provided)\n\
    \     GW   = provider edge device (Gateway)\n     BR   = border router (dual stack)\n\
    \   Specialized GW and BR functions are described in the next section.\n     \
    \     Figure 2: Typical Network Scenario for IPv6 Transition\n   The backbone\
    \ network will be the first part of the operator's network\n   to support IPv6.\
    \  The metro network is not so easily upgraded to\n   support IPv6, since many\
    \ devices need to be modified and there may be\n   some impact to existing services.\
    \  Thus, any means of providing IPv6\n   access has to minimize the changes required\
    \ to devices in the metro\n   network.\n   In contrast to the situation described\
    \ for basic 6rd [RFC5569],\n   the operator is assumed to have no control over\
    \ the capabilities\n   of the IP devices on the customer premises.  As a result,\
    \ the\n   operator cannot assume that any of these devices are capable of\n  \
    \ supporting 6rd.\n   If the customer equipment is in bridged mode and IPv6 is\
    \ deployed to\n   sites via a Service Provider's (SP's) IPv4 network, the IPv6-only\n\
    \   host needs an IPv6 address to visit the IPv6 service.  In this\n   scenario,\
    \ 6to4 [RFC3056] or 6rd can be used.  However, each IPv6-only\n   host may need\
    \ one corresponding IPv4 address when using a public IPv4\n   address in 6to4\
    \ or 6rd, which puts great address pressure on the\n   operators.\n   If the CPE\
    \ in the above figure is acting in bridging mode, each host\n   behind it needs\
    \ to be directly assigned an IPv6 prefix so it can\n   access IPv6 services. \
    \ If the CPE is acting in routing mode, only the\n   CPE needs to be assigned\
    \ an IPv6 prefix, and it delegates prefixes to\n   the hosts behind it.\n   If\
    \ the Gateway supports IPv4 only, then an IPv4 address must also be\n   assigned\
    \ to each host (bridging mode) or to the CPE (routing mode).\n   Both of these\
    \ cases, but the bridging mode in particular, put\n   pressure on the provider's\
    \ stock of IPv4 addresses.\n   If the Gateway is dual stack, an arrangement may\
    \ be possible whereby\n   all communication between the Gateway and the customer\
    \ site uses IPv6\n   and the need to assign IPv4 addresses to customer devices\
    \ is avoided.\n   A possible solution is presented in the next section.\n"
- title: 3.  Proposed Solution
  contents:
  - "3.  Proposed Solution\n   For basic 6rd [RFC5969], the 6rd CE initiates the 6-in-4\
    \ tunnel to\n   the dual-stack border router (i.e., the 6rd Border Relay in 6rd\n\
    \   terminology) to carry its IPv6 traffic.  To avoid the requirement for\n  \
    \ customer premises equipment to fulfill this role, it is necessary to\n   move\
    \ the tunneling function to a network device.  This document\n   identifies a\
    \ functional element, termed the 6rd Gateway, to perform\n   this task.  In what\
    \ follows, the 6rd Gateway and 6rd Border Relay are\n   referred to simply as\
    \ the Gateway and Border Relay, respectively.\n   The functions of the Gateway\
    \ are as follows:\n   o  to generate and allocate Gateway-initiated 6rd delegated\
    \ prefixes\n      for IPv6-capable customer devices, as described in Section 3.1;\n\
    \   o  to forward outgoing IPv6 packets through a tunnel to a Border\n      Relay,\
    \ which extracts and forwards them to an IPv6 network as\n      for 6rd;\n   o\
    \  to extract incoming IPv6 packets tunneled from the Border Relay\n      and\
    \ forward them to the correct user device.\n   In the proposed solution, there\
    \ is only one tunnel initiated from\n   each Gateway to the Border Relay, which\
    \ greatly reduces the number of\n   tunnels the Border Relay has to handle.  The\
    \ deployment scenario\n   consistent with the problem statement in Section 2 collocates\
    \ the\n   Gateway with the IP edge of the access network.  This is shown in\n\
    \   Figure 2 and is the typical placement of the Broadband Network\n   Gateway\
    \ (BNG) in a fixed broadband network.  By assumption, the metro\n   network beyond\
    \ the BNG is IPv4.  Transport between the customer site\n   and the Gateway is\
    \ over Layer 2.\n   The elements of the proposed solution are as follows:\n  \
    \ o  The IPv6 prefix assigned to the customer site contains the\n      compressed\
    \ IPv4 address of the network-facing side of the Gateway,\n      plus a manually\
    \ provisioned or Gateway-generated customer site\n      identifier.  This is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 3.\n   o  The Border Relay is able to route incoming IPv6 packets\
    \ to the\n      correct Gateway by extracting the compressed Gateway address from\n\
    \      the IPv6 destination address of the incoming packet, expanding it\n   \
    \   to a full 32-bit IPv4 address, and setting it as the destination\n      address\
    \ of the encapsulated packet.\n   o  The Gateway can route incoming packets to\
    \ the correct link after\n      decapsulation using a mapping from either the\
    \ full IPv6 prefix or\n      the customer site identifier extracted from that\
    \ prefix to the\n      appropriate link.\n"

    \   |<------ GI 6rd delegated prefix ------>|\n    Figure 3: Gateway-Initiated\
    \ 6rd Address Format for a Customer Site\n   The common prefix, i.e., the first\
    \ p bits of the GI 6rd delegated\n   prefix, is configured in the Gateway.  This\
    \ part of the prefix is\n   common across multiple customers and multiple Gateways.\
    \  Multiple\n   common prefix values may be used in a network either for service\n\
    \   separation or for scalability.\n   The Gateway Identifier is equal to the\
    \ o low-order bits of the\n   Gateway IPv4 address on the virtual link to the\
    \ Border Relay.  The\n   number of bits o is equal to (32 - IPv4MaskLen), where\
    \ the latter is\n   the length of the IPv4 prefix from which the Gateway IPv4\
    \ addresses\n   are derived.  The value of IPv4MaskLen is configured in both the\n\
    \   Gateways and the Border Relays.\n   The Customer Site Index is effectively\
    \ a sequence number assigned to\n   an individual customer site served by the\
    \ Gateway.  The value of the\n   index for a given customer site must be unique\
    \ across the Gateway.\n   The length n of the Customer Site Index is provisioned\
    \ in the Gateway\n   and must be large enough to accommodate the number of customer\
    \ sites\n   that the Gateway is expected to serve.\n   To give a numerical example,\
    \ consider a 6rd domain containing ten\n   million IPv6-capable customer devices\
    \ (a rather high number given\n   that 6rd is meant for the early stages of IPv6\
    \ deployment).  The\n   estimated number of 6rd Gateways needed to serve this\
    \ domain would be\n   on the order of 3,300, each serving 30,000 customer devices.\n\
    \   Assuming best-case compression for the Gateway addresses, the Gateway\n  \
    \ Identifier field has length o = 12 bits.  If 6-in-4 tunneling is\n   being used,\
    \ this best case is more likely to be achievable than it\n   would be if the IPv4\
    \ addresses belonged to the customer devices.  The\n   customer device index,\
    \ which is a more controllable parameter, has\n   length n = 15 bits.\n   Overall,\
    \ these figures suggest that the length p of the common prefix\n   can be 29 bits\
    \ for a /56 delegated prefix, or 21 bits if /48\n   delegated prefixes need to\
    \ be allocated.\n"
