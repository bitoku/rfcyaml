  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document updates IANA registries to support the SEED\
    \ [RFC4269]\n   block cipher algorithm for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol\n\
    \   (SRTP) and the Secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP)\n   [RFC3711]\

- title: 1.1.  SEED
  contents:
  - "1.1.  SEED\n   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that has been developed\n\
    \   by KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts\n   since\
    \ 1998.  The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit, and the\n   key length\
    \ is also 128-bit.  SEED has a 16-round Feistel structure.\n   SEED is a Korean\
    \ National Industrial Association standard and is\n   widely used in South Korea\
    \ for electronic commerce and various\n   security products such as firewalls,\
    \ VPNs, and so on.\n"
- title: 2.  Additions to MIKEY Payload
  contents:
  - "2.  Additions to MIKEY Payload\n   This section specifies new code points for\
    \ the MIKEY [RFC3830]\n   payload to indicate the use of the SEED cipher algorithm\
    \ for SRTP and\n   SRTCP.  There are three applicable modes of running SEED: SEED\
    \ in\n   Counter Mode (SEED-CTR), SEED in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode (SEED-\n \
    \  CCM), and SEED in Galois/Counter Mode (SEED-GCM) Mode.  These are\n   defined\
    \ in [RFC5669].\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   No security problem has been found on SEED. \
    \ SEED is secure against\n   all known attacks including differential cryptanalysis,\
    \ linear\n   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks.  The only known attack is\
    \ an\n   exhaustive search for the key.  For further security considerations,\n\
    \   the reader is encouraged to read [SEED-EVAL].\n"
