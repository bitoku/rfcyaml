- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides several certificate policy identifiers\
    \ for\n   testing certificate handling software.  These certificate policy\n \
    \  identifiers are not intended for use in the public Internet.\n   The certificate\
    \ policy identifiers provided in this document are\n   consistent with the certificate\
    \ profile specified in [RFC5280].  They\n   are appropriate for testing the certificate\
    \ policy processing,\n   especially the handling of the certificate policy extension,\
    \ the\n   policy constraints extension, and the policy mapping extension.\n"
- title: 2.  Certificate Policy Identifiers for Testing
  contents:
  - "2.  Certificate Policy Identifiers for Testing\n   The following certificate\
    \ policy identifiers are provided for testing\n   certificate handling software.\

- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This specification does not identify particular\
    \ certificate policies\n   for use in the Internet public key infrastructure.\
    \  The actual\n   policies used for production certificates can have a significant\n\
    \   impact on the confidence that one can place in the certificate.  No\n   confidence\
    \ should be placed in any certificate that makes use of\n   these certificate\
    \ policy identifiers, since they are intended only\n   for testing.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   The object identifiers used in this document are\
    \ defined in an arc\n   delegated by IANA to the PKIX Working Group.  No further\
    \ action by\n   IANA is necessary for this document or any anticipated updates.\n"
