  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 4279 specifies cipher suites for supporting TLS using\
    \ pre-shared\n   symmetric keys that (a) use only symmetric key operations for\n\
    \   authentication, (b) use a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with\n   a\
    \ pre-shared key (PSK), or (c) combine public key authentication of\n   the server\
    \ with pre-shared key authentication of the client.\n   RFC 4785 specifies authentication-only\
    \ cipher suites (with no\n   encryption).  These cipher suites are useful when\
    \ authentication and\n   integrity protection is desired, but confidentiality\
    \ is not needed or\n   not permitted.\n   RFC 4492 defines a set of Elliptic Curve\
    \ Cryptography (ECC)-based\n   cipher suites for TLS and describes the use of\
    \ ECC certificates for\n   client authentication.  In particular, it specifies\
    \ the use of\n   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement in a TLS handshake\n\
    \   and the use of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)\n  \
    \ as a new authentication mechanism.\n   This document specifies a set of cipher\
    \ suites that use a PSK to\n   authenticate an ECDH exchange.  These cipher suites\
    \ provide Perfect\n   Forward Secrecy.  Some of these cipher suites provide authentication\n\
    \   only.\n   The reader is expected to become familiar with RFC 4279, RFC 4492,\n\
    \   and RFC 4785 prior to studying this document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Applicability Statement\n   The cipher suites defined in this document\
    \ can be negotiated,\n   whatever the negotiated TLS version is.\n   The applicability\
    \ statement in [RFC4279] applies to this document as\n   well.\n"

  - "2.  ECDHE_PSK Key Exchange Algorithm\n   The cipher suites described in this\
    \ document make use of the elliptic\n   curve (EC) parameter negotiation mechanism\
    \ defined in RFC 4492.  When\n   the cipher suites defined in this document are\
    \ used, the\n   'ec_diffie_hellman_psk' case inside the ServerKeyExchange and\n\
    \   ClientKeyExchange structure MUST be used instead of the 'psk' case\n   defined\
    \ in [RFC4279] (i.e., the ServerKeyExchange and\n   ClientKeyExchange messages\
    \ include the EC Diffie-Hellman parameters\n   in the form specified in Sections\
    \ 5.4 and 5.7 of [RFC4492]).  The PSK\n   identity and identity hint fields have\
    \ the same meaning and encoding\n   as specified in [RFC4279] (note that the ServerKeyExchange\
    \ message is\n   always sent, even if no PSK identity hint is provided).\n   The\
    \ format of the ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange messages is\n   shown\
    \ below.\n      struct {\n          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {\n        \

    \       ClientECDiffieHellmanPublic public;\n          } exchange_keys;\n    \
    \  } ClientKeyExchange;\n   The premaster secret is formed as follows.  First,\
    \ perform the ECDH\n   computation as described in Section 5.10 of [RFC4492].\
    \  Let Z be the\n   octet string produced by this computation.  Next, concatenate\
    \ a\n   uint16 containing the length of Z (in octets), Z itself, a uint16\n  \
    \ containing the length of the PSK (in octets), and the PSK itself.\n   This corresponds\
    \ to the general structure for the premaster secrets\n   (see Note 1 in Section\
    \ 2 of [RFC4279]), with \"other_secret\"\n   containing Z.\n      struct {\n \
    \         opaque other_secret<0..2^16-1>;\n          opaque psk<0..2^16-1>;\n\
