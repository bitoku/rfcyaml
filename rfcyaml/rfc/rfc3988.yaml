  - "Abstract\n   Proper functioning of RFC 1191 path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)\n\
    \   discovery requires that IP routers have knowledge of the MTU for each\n  \
    \ link to which they are connected.  As currently specified, the Label\n   Distribution\
    \ Protocol (LDP) does not have the ability to signal the\n   MTU for a Label Switched\
    \ Path (LSP) to the ingress Label Switching\n   Router (LSR).  In the absence\
    \ of this functionality, the MTU for each\n   LSP must be statically configured\
    \ by network operators or by\n   equivalent off-line mechanisms.\n   This document\
    \ specifies experimental extensions to LDP in support of\n   LSP MTU discovery.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As currently specified in [2], the LDP protocol for MPLS\
    \ does not\n   support signalling of the MTU for LSPs to ingress LSRs.  This\n\
    \   functionality is essential to the proper functioning of RFC 1191 path\n  \
    \ MTU detection [3].  Without knowledge of the MTU for an LSP, edge\n   LSRs may\
    \ transmit packets along that LSP which are, according to [4],\n   too big.  These\
    \ packets may be silently discarded by LSRs along the\n   LSP, effectively preventing\
    \ communication between certain end hosts.\n   The solution proposed in this document\
    \ enables automatic\n   determination of the MTU for an LSP by adding a Type-Length-Value\n\
    \   triplet (TLV) to carry MTU information for a Forwarding Equivalence\n   Class\
    \ (FEC) between adjacent LSRs in LDP Label Mapping messages.\n   This information\
    \ is sufficient for a set of LSRs along the path\n   followed by an LSP to discover\
    \ either the exact MTU for that LSP, or\n   an approximation that is no worse\
    \ than could be generated with local\n   information on the ingress LSR.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Definitions\n   Link MTU: The MTU of a given link.  This size includes\
    \ the IP header\n   and data (or other payload) and the label stack but does not\
    \ include\n   any lower-layer headers.  A link may be an interface (such as\n\
    \   Ethernet or Packet-over-SONET), a tunnel (such as GRE or IPsec), or\n   an\
    \ LSP.\n   Peer LSRs: For LSR A and FEC F, this is the set of LSRs that sent a\n\
    \   Label Mapping for FEC F to A.\n   Downstream LSRs: For LSR A and FEC F, this\
    \ is the subset of A's peer\n   LSRs for FEC F to which A will forward packets\
    \ for the FEC.\n   Typically, this subset is determined via the routing table.\n\
    \   Hop MTU: The MTU of an LSP hop between an upstream LSR, A, and a\n   downstream\
    \ LSR, B.  This size includes the IP header and data (or\n   other payload) and\
    \ the part of the label stack that is considered\n   payload as far as this LSP\
    \ goes.  It does not include any lower-level\n   headers.  (Note: If there are\
    \ multiple links between A and B, the Hop\n   MTU is the minimum of the Hop MTU\
    \ of those links used for\n   forwarding.)\n   LSP MTU: The MTU of an LSP from\
    \ a given LSR to the egress(es), over\n   each valid (forwarding) path.  This\
    \ size includes the IP header and\n   data (or other payload) and any part of\
    \ the label stack that was\n   received by the ingress LSR before it placed the\
    \ packet into the LSP\n   (this part of the label stack is considered part of\
    \ the payload for\n   this LSP).  The size does not include any lower-level headers.\n"

  - "2.2.  Example\n   Consider LSRs A - F, interconnected as follows:\n         \
    \            M       P\n                   _____ C =====\n                  /\

    \      N       Q       R\n   Say that the link MTU for link L is 9216; for links\
    \ M, Q, and R,\n   4470; and for N and P, is 1500.\n   Consider an FEC X for which\
    \ F is the egress, and say that all LSRs\n   advertise X to their neighbors.\n\
    \   Note that although LDP may be running on the C - D link, it is not\n   used\
    \ for forwarding (e.g., because it has a high metric).  In\n   particular, D is\
    \ an LDP neighbor of C, but D is not one of C's\n   downstream LSRs for FEC X.\n\
    \   E's peers for FEC X are C, D, and F.  Say that E chooses F as its\n   downstream\
    \ LSR for X.  E's Hop MTU for link R is 4466.  If F\n   advertised an implicit\
    \ null label to E, then E MAY set the Hop MTU\n   for R to 4470.\n   C's peers\
    \ for FEC X are B, D, and E.  Say that C chooses E as its\n   downstream LSR for\
    \ X.  Similarly, A chooses B, B chooses C and D\n   (equal cost multi-path), D\
    \ chooses E, and E chooses F (respectively)\n   as downstream LSRs.\n   C's Hop\
    \ MTU to E for FEC X is 1496.  B's Hop MTU to C is 4466 and to\n   D is 1496.\
    \  A's LSP MTU for FEC X is 1496.  If A has another LSP for\n   FEC Y to F (learned\
    \ via targeted LDP) that rides over the LSP for FEC\n   X, the MTU for that LSP\
    \ would be 1492.\n   If B had a targeted LDP session to E (e.g., over an RSVP-TE\
    \ tunnel T)\n   and B received a Mapping for FEC X over the targeted LDP session,\n\
    \   then E would also be B's peer, and E may be chosen as a downstream\n   LSR\
    \ for B.  In that case, B's LSP MTU for FEC X would then be the\n   smaller of\
    \ {(T's MTU - 4), E's LSP MTU for X}.\n   This memo describes how A determines\
    \ its LSP MTU for FECs X and Y.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Signalling Procedure
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Signalling Procedure\n   The procedure for signalling the MTU is performed\
    \ hop-by-hop by each\n   LSR L along an LSP for a given FEC, F.  The steps are\
    \ as follows:\n   1. First, L computes its LSP MTU for FEC F:\n      A. If L is\
    \ the egress for F, L sets the LSP MTU for F to 65535.\n      B. [OPTIONAL] If\
    \ L's only downstream LSR is the egress for F\n         (i.e., L is a penultimate\
    \ hop for F) and L receives an implicit\n         null label as its Mapping for\
    \ F, then L can set the Hop MTU for\n         its downstream link to the link\
    \ MTU instead of (link MTU - 4\n         octets).  L's LSP MTU for F is the Hop\
    \ MTU.\n      C. Otherwise (L is not the egress LSR), L computes the LSP MTU for\n\
    \         F as follows:\n         a) L determines its downstream LSRs for FEC\
    \ F.\n         b) For each downstream LSR Z, L computes the minimum of the Hop\n\
    \            MTU to Z and the LSP MTU in the MTU TLV that Z advertised to\n  \
    \          L.  If Z did not include the MTU TLV in its Label Mapping,\n      \
    \      then Z's LSP MTU is set to 65535.\n         c) L sets its LSP MTU to the\
    \ minimum of the MTUs it computed\n            for its downstream LSRs.\n   2.\
    \ For each LDP neighbor (direct or targeted) of L to which L decides\n      to\
    \ send a Mapping for FEC F, L attaches an MTU TLV with the LSP\n      MTU that\
    \ it computed for this FEC.  L MAY (because of policy or\n      for other reasons)\
    \ advertise a smaller MTU than it has computed,\n      but L MUST NOT advertise\
    \ a larger MTU.\n   3. When a new MTU is received for FEC F from a downstream\
    \ LSR or the\n      set of downstream LSRs for F changes, L returns to step 1.\
    \  If the\n      newly computed LSP MTU is unchanged, L SHOULD NOT advertise new\n\
    \      information to its neighbors.  Otherwise, L readvertises its\n      Mappings\
    \ for F to all its peers with an updated MTU TLV.\n      This behavior is standard\
    \ for attributes such as path vector and\n      hop count, and the same rules\
    \ apply, as specified in [2].\n      If the LSP MTU decreases, L SHOULD readvertise\
    \ the new MTU\n      immediately; if the LSP MTU increases, L MAY hold down the\n\
    \      readvertisement.\n"

    \   for an LSP or a segment of an LSP.\n   Note that the U and F bits are set.\
    \  An LSR that doesn't recognize\n   the MTU TLV MUST ignore it when it processes\
    \ the Label Mapping\n   message and forward the TLV to its peers.  This may result\
    \ in the\n   incorrect computation of the LSP MTU; however, silently forwarding\n\
    \   the MTU TLV preserves the maximal amount of information about the LSP\n  \
