- title: 2.  DES Cipher Suites
  contents:
  - "2.  DES Cipher Suites\n   DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a block cipher that\
    \ was originally\n   approved as a US federal standard in 1976, and is specified\
    \ in [DES].\n   For TLS key generation purposes, DES is treated as having a 64-bit\n\
    \   key, but it still provides only 56 bits of protection, as 8 of the 64\n  \
    \ bits are not used by the algorithm.  DES uses a 64-bit block size.\n   The following\
    \ cipher suites have been defined for using DES in Cipher\n   Block Chaining (CBC)\
    \ mode in TLS:\n      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA            = { 0x00,0x09\
    \ };\n      CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA         = { 0x00,0x0C };\n\
    \      CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA         = { 0x00,0x0F };\n    \
    \  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA        = { 0x00,0x12 };\n      CipherSuite\
    \ TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA        = { 0x00,0x15 };\n      CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA\
    \        = { 0x00,0x1A };\n   The key exchange algorithms (RSA, DH_DSS, DH_RSA,\
    \ DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA,\n   and DH_anon) and the MAC (Message Authentication Code)\
    \ algorithm\n   (SHA) are defined in the base TLS specification.\n"
- title: 3.  IDEA Cipher Suite
  contents:
  - "3.  IDEA Cipher Suite\n   IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) is a\
    \ block cipher\n   designed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey [IDEA] [SCH].  IDEA\
    \ uses a\n   128-bit key and operates on 64-bit blocks.\n   The following cipher\
    \ suite has been defined for using IDEA in CBC\n   mode in TLS:\n      CipherSuite\
    \ TLS_RSA_WITH_IDEA_CBC_SHA           = { 0x00,0x07 };\n   The key exchange algorithm\
    \ (RSA) and the MAC algorithm (SHA) are\n   defined in the base TLS specification.\n"

- title: 4.1.  DES Cipher Suites
  contents:
  - "4.1.  DES Cipher Suites\n   DES has an effective key strength of 56 bits, which\
    \ has been known to\n   be vulnerable to practical brute force attacks for over\
    \ 20 years\n   [DH].  A relatively recent 2006 paper by Kumar, et al. [COPA]\n\
    \   describes a system that performs an exhaustive key search in less\n   than\
    \ nine days on average, and costs less than 10,000 USD to build.\n   Given this,\
    \ the single-DES cipher suites SHOULD NOT be implemented by\n   TLS libraries.\
    \  If a TLS library implements these cipher suites, it\n   SHOULD NOT enable them\
    \ by default.  Experience has also shown that\n   rarely used code is a source\
    \ of security and interoperability\n   problems, so existing implementations SHOULD\
    \ consider removing these\n   cipher suites.\n"
- title: 4.2.  IDEA Cipher Suite
  contents:
  - "4.2.  IDEA Cipher Suite\n   IDEA has a 128-bit key, and thus is not vulnerable\
    \ to an exhaustive\n   key search.  However, the IDEA cipher suite for TLS has\
    \ not seen\n   widespread use: most implementations either do not support it,\
    \ do not\n   enable it by default, or do not negotiate it when other algorithms\n\
    \   (such as AES, 3DES, or RC4) are available.\n   Experience has shown that rarely\
    \ used code is a source of security\n   and interoperability problems; given this,\
    \ the IDEA cipher suite\n   SHOULD NOT be implemented by TLS libraries and SHOULD\
    \ be removed from\n   existing implementations.\n"
