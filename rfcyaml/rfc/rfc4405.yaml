- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The practice of falsifying the identity of the sender of\
    \ an e-mail\n   message, commonly called \"spoofing\", is a prevalent tactic used\
    \ by\n   senders of unsolicited commercial e-mail, or \"spam\".  This form of\n\
    \   abuse has highlighted the need to improve identification of the\n   \"responsible\
    \ submitter\" of an e-mail message.\n   In this specification, the responsible\
    \ submitter is the entity most\n   recently responsible for injecting a message\
    \ into the e-mail\n   transport stream.  The e-mail address of the responsible\
    \ submitter\n   will be referred to as the Purported Responsible Address (PRA)\
    \ of the\n   message.  The Purported Responsible Domain (PRD) is the domain\n\
    \   portion of that address.\n   This specification codifies rules for encoding\
    \ the purported\n   responsible address into the SMTP transport protocol.  This\
    \ will\n   permit receiving SMTP servers to efficiently validate whether or not\n\
    \   the SMTP client is authorized to transmit mail on behalf of the\n   responsible\
    \ submitter's domain.\n   Broadly speaking, there are two possible approaches\
    \ for determining\n   the purported responsible address: either from RFC 2821\
    \ [SMTP]\n   protocol data or from RFC 2822 [MSG-FORMAT] message headers.  Each\n\
    \   approach has certain advantages and disadvantages.\n   Deriving the purported\
    \ responsible domain from RFC 2821 data has the\n   advantage that validation\
    \ can be performed before the SMTP client has\n   transmitted the message body.\
    \  If spoofing is detected, then the SMTP\n   server has the opportunity, depending\
    \ upon local policy, to reject\n   the message before it is ever transmitted.\
    \  The disadvantage of this\n   approach is the risk of false positives, that\
    \ is, incorrectly\n   concluding that the sender's e-mail address has been spoofed.\
    \  There\n   are today legitimate reasons why the Internet domain names used in\n\
    \   RFC 2821 commands may be different from those of the sender of an e-\n   mail\
    \ message.\n   Deriving the purported responsible domain from RFC 2822 headers\
    \ has\n   the advantage that validation can usually be based on an identity\n\
    \   that is displayed to recipients by existing Mail User Agents (MUAs)\n   as\
    \ the sender's identity.  This aids in detection of a particularly\n   noxious\
    \ form of spoofing known as \"phishing\" in which a malicious\n   sender attempts\
    \ to fool a recipient into believing that a message\n   originates from an entity\
    \ well known to the recipient.  This approach\n   carries a lower risk of false\
    \ positives since there are fewer\n   legitimate reasons for RFC 2822 headers\
    \ to differ from the true\n   sender of the message.  The disadvantage of this\
    \ approach is that it\n   does require parsing and analysis of message headers.\
    \  In practice,\n   much if not all the message body is also transmitted since\
    \ the SMTP\n   protocol described in RFC 2821 provides no mechanism to interrupt\n\
    \   message transmission after the DATA command has been issued.\n   It is desirable\
    \ to unify these two approaches in a way that combines\n   the benefits of both\
    \ while minimizing their respective disadvantages.\n   This specification describes\
    \ just such a unified approach.  It uses\n   the mechanism described in [SMTP]\
    \ to describe an extension to the\n   SMTP protocol.  Using this extension, an\
    \ SMTP client can specify the\n   e-mail address of the entity most recently responsible\
    \ for submitting\n   the message to the SMTP client in a new SUBMITTER parameter\
    \ of the\n   SMTP MAIL command.  SMTP servers can use this information to validate\n\
    \   that the SMTP client is authorized to transmit e-mail on behalf of\n   the\
    \ Internet domain contained in the SUBMITTER parameter.\n"

    \  Characters such as\n   SP, \"+\", and \"=\" that may occur in Mailbox but are\
    \ not permitted in\n   ESMTP parameter values MUST be encoded as \"xtext\" as\
    \ described in\n   Section 4 of [DSN].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Setting the SUBMITTER Parameter Value
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Setting the SUBMITTER Parameter Value\n   The purpose of the SUBMITTER\
    \ parameter is to allow the SMTP client to\n   indicate to the server the purported\
    \ responsible address of the\n   message directly in the RFC 2821 protocol.\n\
    \   Therefore, SMTP clients that support the Responsible Submitter\n   extension\
    \ MUST include the SUBMITTER parameter on all messages.  This\n   includes messages\
    \ containing a null reverse-path in the MAIL command.\n   SMTP clients MUST set\
    \ the SUBMITTER parameter value to the purported\n   responsible address of the\
    \ message as defined in [PRA].  This also\n   applies to messages containing a\
    \ null reverse-path.\n   In some circumstances, described in Section 7 of [SENDER-ID],\
    \ SMTP\n   clients may need to add RFC 2822 headers to the message in order to\n\
    \   ensure that the correct SUBMITTER parameter value can be set.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Processing the SUBMITTER Parameter
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Processing the SUBMITTER Parameter\n   Receivers of e-mail messages sent\
    \ with the SUBMITTER parameter SHOULD\n   select the domain part of the SUBMITTER\
    \ address value as the\n   purported responsible domain of the message, and SHOULD\
    \ perform such\n   tests, including those defined in [SENDER-ID], as are deemed\n\
    \   necessary to determine whether the connecting SMTP client is\n   authorized\
    \ to transmit e-mail messages on behalf of that domain.\n   If these tests indicate\
    \ that the connecting SMTP client is not\n   authorized to transmit e-mail messages\
    \ on behalf of the SUBMITTER\n   domain, the receiving SMTP server SHOULD reject\
    \ the message and when\n   rejecting MUST use \"550 5.7.1 Submitter not allowed.\"\
    \n   If the receiving SMTP server allows the connecting SMTP client to\n   transmit\
    \ message data, then the server SHOULD determine the purported\n   responsible\
    \ address of the message by examining the RFC 2822 message\n   headers as described\
    \ in [PRA].  If this purported responsible address\n   does not match the address\
    \ appearing in the SUBMITTER parameter, the\n   receiving SMTP server MUST reject\
    \ the message and when rejecting MUST\n   use \"550 5.7.1 Submitter does not match\
    \ header.\"\n   If no purported responsible address is found according to the\n\
    \   procedure defined in [PRA], the SMTP server SHOULD reject the message\n  \
    \ and when rejecting MUST use \"554 5.7.7 Cannot verify submitter\n   address.\"\
    \n   Verifying Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) are strongly urged to validate\n  \
    \ the SUBMITTER parameter against the RFC 2822 headers; otherwise, an\n   attacker\
    \ can trivially defeat the algorithm.\n   Note that the presence of the SUBMITTER\
    \ parameter on the MAIL command\n   MUST NOT change the effective reverse-path\
    \ of a message.  Any\n   delivery status notifications must be sent to the reverse-path,\
    \ if\n   one exists, as per Section 3.7 of [SMTP] regardless of the presence\n\
    \   of a SUBMITTER parameter.  If the reverse-path is null, delivery\n   status\
    \ notifications MUST NOT be sent to the SUBMITTER address.\n   Likewise, the SUBMITTER\
    \ parameter MUST NOT change the effective reply\n   address of a message.  Replies\
    \ MUST be sent to the From address or\n   the Reply-To address, if present, as\
    \ described in Section 3.6.2 of\n   [MSG-FORMAT] regardless of the presence of\
    \ a SUBMITTER parameter.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Transmitting to a Non-SUBMITTER-Aware SMTP Server
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Transmitting to a Non-SUBMITTER-Aware SMTP Server\n   Notwithstanding the\
    \ provisions of Section 4.1 above, when an MTA\n   transmits a message to another\
    \ MTA that does not support the\n   SUBMITTER extension, the forwarding MTA MUST\
    \ transmit the message\n   without the SUBMITTER parameter.  This should involve\
    \ no information\n   loss, since the SUBMITTER parameter is required to contain\n\
    \   information derived from the message headers.\n"

  - "5.  Examples\n   This section provides examples of how the SUBMITTER parameter\
    \ would\n   be used.  The following dramatis personae appear in the examples:\n\

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Mail Submission\n   Under normal circumstances, Alice would configure her\
    \ MUA to submit\n   her message to the mail system using the SUBMIT protocol [SUBMIT].\n\
    \   The MUA would transmit the message without the SUBMITTER parameter.\n   The\
    \ SUBMIT server would validate that the MUA is allowed to submit a\n   message\
    \ through some external scheme, perhaps SMTP Authentication\n   [SMTPAUTH].  Under\
    \ most circumstances, this would look like a normal,\n   authenticated SMTP transaction.\
    \  The SUBMIT server would extract her\n   name from the RFC 2822 headers for\
    \ use in the SUBMITTER parameters of\n   subsequent transmissions of the message.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This extension provides an optimization to allow\
    \ an SMTP client to\n   identify the responsible submitter of an e-mail message\
    \ in the SMTP\n   protocol, and to enable SMTP servers to perform efficient validation\n\
    \   of that identity before the message contents are transmitted.\n   It is, however,\
    \ quite possible for an attacker to forge the value of\n   the SUBMITTER parameter.\
    \  Furthermore, it is possible for an attacker\n   to transmit an e-mail message\
    \ whose SUBMITTER parameter does not\n   match the purported responsible address\
    \ of the message as derived\n   from the RFC 2822 headers.  Therefore, the presence\
    \ of the SUBMITTER\n   parameter provides, by itself, no assurance of the authenticity\
    \ of\n   the message or the responsible submitter.  Rather, the SUBMITTER\n  \
    \ parameter is intended to provide additional information to receiving\n   e-mail\
    \ systems to enable them to efficiently determine the validity\n   of the responsible\
    \ submitter, and specifically, whether the SMTP\n   client is authorized to transmit\
    \ e-mail on behalf of the purported\n   responsible submitter's domain.  Section\
    \ 4.2 describes how receiving\n   e-mail systems should process the SUBMITTER\
    \ parameter.\n"
