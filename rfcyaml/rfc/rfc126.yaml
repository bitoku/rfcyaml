  - "            Ames Graphics Facilities at Ames Research Center\n   This note is\
    \ intended as a response to an RFC which suggested that\n   nodes describe their\
    \ graphics environment. The following graphics\n   facilites are now at Ames for\
    \ the IBM 360/67 TSS:\n      a.   An SC 4020 off line microfilm system.\n    \
    \  b.   Calcomp plotters.\n      c.   ARDS storage tube CRTs.\n      d.   IMLAC\
    \ PDS-1 refresh CRTs.\n      e.   One IBM 2250 CRT.\n   Devices which will be\
    \ in use in the near future are:\n      a.   An Evans and Sutherland LDS-2 system.\n\
    \      b.   Hazeltine alphanumeric CRTs.\n   Because of the diverse nature of\
    \ the devices and the varying software\n   support provided by the manafacturers,\
    \ work has been undertaken to\n   provide a device independent package. This package\
    \ is currently being\n   implemented. The basic entity is a device independent\
    \ intermediate\n   language which describes the picture to be displayed. When\
    \ a device\n   is selected, the intermediate language is converted to specific\n\
    \   device orders.\n   Other features include the definition and storage of subpictures\
    \ for\n   later construction of more complex pictures. An interface has been\n\
    \   specified so that graphic data sets can be transmitted to other\n   installations\
    \ on the TSS network.\n   A note to those who plan to use the ILLIAC IV when it\
    \ becomes a\n   functioning node at Ames. I would like information concerning\
    \ the\n   graphics environment at your sites and any thoughts you have on how\n\
    \   you will be using graphics with the ILLIAC IV.\n         [ This RFC was put\
    \ into machine readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives\
    \ by Andrew Crawford 4/97 ]\n"
