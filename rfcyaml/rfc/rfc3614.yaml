  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace\
    \ for\n   the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) for naming persistent\n   resources\
    \ as part of the MPEG standards.  Example resources include\n   technical documents\
    \ and specifications, eXtensible Markup Language\n   (XML) Schemas, classification\
    \ schemes, XML Document Type Definitions\n   (DTDs), namespaces, style sheets,\
    \ media assets, and other types of\n   resources produced or managed by MPEG.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   MPEG is a working group of the International Organization\
    \ for\n   Standardization (ISO) and International Engineering Consortium (IEC)\n\
    \   in charge of the development of standards for coded representation of\n  \
    \ digital audio and video.  MPEG has produced MPEG-1, the standard on\n   which\
    \ such products as Video CD and MP3 are based, MPEG-2, the\n   standard on which\
    \ such products as Digital Television set top boxes\n   and DVD are based, MPEG-4,\
    \ the standard for multimedia for the fixed\n   and mobile web, and MPEG-7, \"\
    Multimedia Content Description\n   Interface\", the standard for description and\
    \ search of audio and\n   visual content. Work on MPEG-21, \"Multimedia Framework\"\
    \ is currently\n   underway.\n   MPEG would like to assign unique, permanent,\
    \ location-independent\n   names based on URNs for some resources it produces\
    \ or manages.\n   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.\n"

    \          jrsmith@watson.ibm.com\n   Declaration of structure:\n      URNs assigned\
    \ by MPEG will have the following hierarchical\n      structure based on the organizational\
    \ structure of the MPEG\n      standards:\n         urn:mpeg:{standard name}:{assigned\
    \ US-ASCII string}\n      where \"{standard name}\" is a US-ASCII string that\
    \ conforms to URN\n      Syntax requirements ([RFC2141]) and corresponds to the\
    \ name of an\n      MPEG standard (such as \"mpeg1\", \"mpeg2\", \"mpeg4\", \"\
    mpeg7\",\n      \"mpeg21\", and\n      \"{assigned US-ASCII string}\" is a US-ASCII\
    \ string that conforms to\n      URN Syntax requirements ([RFC2141]).\n      The\
    \ individual URNs shall be assigned by MPEG through the process\n      of development\
    \ of MPEG standards.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      None\n   Identifier\
    \ uniqueness considerations:\n      MPEG shall establish unique identifiers as\
    \ appropriate.\n      Uniqueness is guaranteed as long as the assigned string\
    \ is never\n      reassigned for a given standard name and that the standard name\
    \ is\n      never reassigned.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n   \
    \   MPEG is committed to maintaining the accessibility and persistence\n     \
    \ of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by the\n      organization.\n\
    \      Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon suitable delegation\n    \
    \  of resolution at the level of \"standard name\"(s), and persistence\n     \
    \ of standard name assignment.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      Assignment\
    \ is limited to the owner and those authorities that are\n      specifically designated\
    \ by the owner.  MPEG may designate portions\n      of its namespace for assignment\
    \ by other parties.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      The owner will\
    \ develop and maintain \"URN catalogs\" that map all\n      assigned URNs to Uniform\
    \ Resource Locators (URLs) specifically to\n      enable Web-based resolution\
    \ of named resources.  In the future an\n      interactive online resolution system\
    \ may be developed to automate\n      this process.\n      The owner will authorize\
    \ additional resolution services as\n      appropriate.\n   Rules for Lexical\
    \ Equivalence:\n      The \"standard name\" is case-insensitive.  Thus, the portion\
    \ of the\n      URN:\n         urn:mpeg:{standard name}:\n      is case-insensitive\
    \ for matches.  The remainder of the identifier\n      must be considered case-sensitive.\n\
    \   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n   Validation\
    \ mechanism:\n      None specified.  The owner will develop and maintain URN catalogs.\n\
    \      The presence of a URN in a catalog indicates that it is valid.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   URN assignment procedures:\n      The individual\
    \ URNs shall be assigned through the process of\n      development of MPEG standards\
    \ by the Moving Picture Experts Group\n      (MPEG), which is a working group\
    \ of ISO/IEC.\n   URN resolution/delegation:\n      The resolution and delegation\
    \ shall be determined through the\n      process of development of MPEG standards\
    \ by the Moving Picture\n      Experts Group (MPEG).  MPEG has developed requests\
    \ for\n      registration authority for MPEG-7 classification schemes and\n  \
    \    MPEG-21 identification systems. These registration authorities\n      shall\
    \ be responsible for corresponding parts of MPEG namespace.\n   Type of resources\
    \ to be identified:\n      Types of resources to be identified include XML schema\
    \ definition\n      files, classification schemes, identification systems.\n \
    \  Type of services to be supported:\n      Types of services supported include\
    \ controlled term lookup in\n      classification schemes, resolution of ids in\
    \ identification\n      systems.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   Open assignment and use of identifiers within\
    \ the namespace:\n      With on-going development of MPEG standards, MPEG shall\
    \ establish\n      requirements for assignment and use of identifiers within MPEG\n\
    \      namespace.  MPEG has already established requirements for\n      assignment\
    \ and use of MPEG-7 classification schemes under MPEG\n      namespace. A registration\
    \ authority shall have the responsibility\n      for processing third party requests\
    \ for registering classification\n      schemes.\n   Open operation of resolution\
    \ servers for the namespace (server):\n      With on-going development of MPEG\
    \ standards, MPEG shall establish\n      requirements and seek candidates for\
    \ operating resolution servers\n      as appropriate.\n   Creation of software\
    \ that can meaningfully resolve and access\n   services for the namespace (client):\n\
    \      With on-going development of MPEG standards, MPEG shall develop\n     \
    \ reference software implementations of its standards.\n"
