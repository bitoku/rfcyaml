- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many large content providers participated in World IPv6\
    \ Day on June\n   8, 2011.  On that day, IPv6 [RFC2460] was enabled by default\
    \ for 24\n   hours on numerous networks and sites that previously supported only\n\
    \   IPv4.  The aim was to identify any remaining issues with widespread\n   IPv6\
    \ usage in these networks.  Most of the potential problems\n   associated with\
    \ using IPv6 are, after all, of a practical nature,\n   such as ensuring that\
    \ the necessary components have IPv6 turned on,\n   that configurations are correct,\
    \ and that any implementation bugs\n   have been removed.\n   Some content providers\
    \ have been reluctant to enable IPv6.  The\n   reasons for this include delays\
    \ for applications attempting to\n   connect over broken IPv6 links before falling\
    \ back to IPv4 [RFC6555]\n   and unreliable IPv6 connectivity.  Bad IPv6 routing\
    \ has been behind\n   many of the problems.  Among the causes are broken 6to4\
    \ tunneling\n   protocol [RFC3056] connectivity, experimental IPv6 setups that\
    \ are\n   untested and unmonitored, and configuration problems with firewalls.\n\
    \   The situation is improving as more users and operators put IPv6 to\n   use\
    \ and fix the problems that emerge.\n   The World IPv6 Day event was largely unnoticed\
    \ by the general public,\n   which is a good thing since it means that no major\
    \ problems were\n   detected.  Existing IPv4 connectivity was not damaged by IPv6,\
    \ and\n   also new IPv6 connectivity worked as expected in vast majority of\n\
    \   cases.  For the Internet, however, there was a major change on a\n   short\
    \ timescale.  This memo discusses measurements that the authors\n   made from\
    \ the perspective of an end user with well-working IPv4 and\n   IPv6 connectivity.\
    \  Our measurements include the number of the most\n   popular networks providing\
    \ AAAA records for their service, as well as\n   delay and connection failure\
    \ statistics.\n   The rest of this memo is structured as follows.  Section 2 discusses\n\
    \   the goals of our measurements, Section 3 describes our measurement\n   methodology,\
    \ Section 4 gives our preliminary results, and Section 5\n   draws some conclusions.\n"
- title: 2.  Motivation and Goals
  contents:
  - "2.  Motivation and Goals\n   Practical IPv6 deployment plans benefit from accurate\
    \ information\n   about the extent to which IPv6 can be used for communication\
    \ and how\n   its characteristics differ from those of IPv4.  For instance,\n\
    \   operators planning to deploy dual-stack networking may wish to\n   understand\
    \ what fraction of their traffic would move to IPv6.  This\n   information is\
    \ useful for estimating the capacity necessary to deal\n   with the IPv6 traffic\
    \ and the impacts to the operator's IPv4\n   infrastructure or carrier-grade NAT\
    \ devices as their traffic is\n   reduced.  Network owners also wish to understand\
    \ the extent to which\n   they can expect different delay characteristics or problems\
    \ with IPv6\n   connectivity.  The goals of our measurements were to help with\
    \ these\n   topics by answering the following questions:\n   o  What fraction\
    \ of the most popular Internet sites offer AAAA\n      records?  How did World\
    \ IPv6 Day change the situation?\n   o  How do the traffic characteristics differ\
    \ between IPv4 and IPv6 on\n      sites offering AAAA records?  Are the connection\
    \ failure rates\n      similar?  How are round-trip times (RTTs) impacted?\n \
    \  There have been many measurements about some of these aspects from a\n   service\
    \ provider perspective, such as Google studies about broken\n   connectivity between\
    \ Google and its end users.  Our measurements\n   start from a different angle,\
    \ by assuming good dual-stack\n   connectivity at the measurement end, and then\
    \ probing the rest of the\n   Internet to understand, for instance, how likely\
    \ there are to be IPv6\n   connectivity problems or what the delay differences\
    \ are between IPv4\n   and IPv6.  Similar studies have been performed by the University\
    \ of\n   Pennsylvania and Comcast [IPv6Monitor] and RIPE NCC [RIPEv6Day].\n"
- title: 3.  Measurement Methodology
  contents:
  - "3.  Measurement Methodology\n   We used the top 10,000 sites of the Alexa 1 million\
    \ most popular\n   sites list [Alexa] from June 1, 2011.  For each domain name\
    \ in the\n   list, we performed DNS queries with different host names.  For IPv4\n\
    \   addresses (A records), we used host name \"www\" and also performed a\n  \
    \ query with just the domain name.  For IPv6 addresses (AAAA records),\n   we\
    \ used different combinations of host names that have been used for\n   IPv6 sites,\
    \ namely, \"www6\", \"ipv6\", \"v6\", \"ipv6.www\", \"www.ipv6\",\n   \"v6.www\"\
    , and \"www.v6\".\n   All DNS queries were initiated in the order listed above\
    \ (first \"www\"\n   and just the domain name for A records, then \"www\", domain\
    \ name, and\n   different IPv6-host names for AAAA records), but the queries were\n\
    \   done in parallel (i.e., without waiting for the previous query to\n   finish).\
    \  The first response for A and AAAA records and the\n   corresponding host names\
    \ were recorded.  The queries had a 3-second\n   retransmission timeout, and if\
    \ there was no response for 10 seconds,\n   all remaining queries for the site\
    \ were canceled.  We used a custom\n   Perl script and the Net::DNS [net-dns]\
    \ module for the DNS queries.\n   The measurement script used a bind9 DNS server\
    \ running on the same\n   host as was performing the measurement.  The DNS cache\
    \ of the server\n   was flushed before each measurement run in order to detect\
    \ the\n   changes in the DNS records in real time.  The host, and thus the DNS\n\
    \   server, was not part of DNS IPv6 whitelisting agreements.  (See\n   Section\
    \ 4.3 of [RFC6589] for information on DNS resolver\n   whitelisting.)\n   The\
    \ local network where the host performing the measurements was had\n   native\
    \ IPv6 (dual-stack) connectivity.  The IPv6 connectivity to the\n   local network\
    \ was provided by an IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel from the\n   network's default router\
    \ to the ISP's IPv6 peering point.\n   After obtaining IP addresses for the site,\
    \ if a site had both A and\n   AAAA records, a simple C program was used to create\
    \ TCP connections\n   to port 80 (HTTP) simultaneously using both IPv4 and IPv6\
    \ to the\n   (first) IP addresses discovered from the DNS.  The connection setup\n\
    \   was repeated up to 10 times, giving up after the first failed attempt\n  \
    \ (but only after normal TCP retransmissions).  The connection setup\n   delay\
    \ was measured by recording the time immediately before and after\n   the connect\
    \ system call.  The host used for measurements was a\n   regular Linux PC with\
    \ a 2.6.32 version kernel and a dual-stack\n   Internet connection via Ethernet.\n\
    \   The measurements were started one week before World IPv6 Day (on\n   Wednesday,\
    \ June 1, 17:30 UTC) and ran once every three hours until\n   July 11.  One test\
    \ run took from two to two-and-a-half hours to\n   complete.\n   The accuracy\
    \ and generality of the measurement results are limited by\n   several factors.\
    \  While we ran the tests at three different sites,\n   most of the results discussed\
    \ in this document present snapshots of\n   the situation from just one measurement\
    \ point, the Ericsson Research\n   Finland premises, near Helsinki.  Also, since\
    \ one measurement run\n   took quite a long time, the network characteristics\
    \ and DNS records\n   might have changed even during a single run.  The first\
    \ DNS response\n   was used for the TCP connectivity tests, and this selection\
    \ might\n   have resulted in selection of a non-optimal host; yet, a slight\n\
    \   preference was given to the \"www\" and only-domain-name records since\n \
    \  their queries were started before the others.  While the host\n   performing\
    \ the measurements was otherwise idle, the local network was\n   in regular office\
    \ use during the measurements.  The connectivity\n   setup delay was collected\
    \ in user space, with a regular, non-real-\n   time kernel implementation, resulting\
    \ in small inaccuracies in the\n   timing information.\n"

  - "4.1.  DNS AAAA Records\n   The number of top 10,000 sites with AAAA DNS records\
    \ before, during,\n   and after World IPv6 Day is shown in Figure 1.  The measurements\n\
    \   performed during World IPv6 Day are shown on the light gray\n   background.\n\
    \                               [See the PDF.]\n     Figure 1: Number of sites\
    \ with AAAA DNS records in the top 10,000\n                            most popular\
    \ sites\n   When the measurements began on June 1, 245 sites (2.45%) of the top\n\
    \   10,000 sites had both A and AAAA records.  During the following days,\n  \
    \ the number of such sites slowly increased, reaching 306 sites in the\n   measurement\
    \ that was started at 22:30 UTC on June 7, the evening\n   before World IPv6 Day.\
    \  When World IPv6 Day officially started, the\n   following measurement (at 01:30\
    \ UTC) recorded 383 sites, and the next\n   one 472 sites.  During the day, the\
    \ number of sites with AAAA records\n   peaked at 491 (4.91% of the measured 10,000\
    \ sites), at 19:30 UTC.\n   When World IPv6 Day was over, the number of AAAA records\
    \ dropped\n   nearly as fast as it had increased just 24 hours earlier.  However,\n\
    \   the number of sites stabilized at around 310 and did not drop below\n   300\
    \ after that, resulting in over 3% of the top 10,000 sites still\n   having AAAA\
    \ records at the end of our measurements, on July 11.\n   While 274 sites had\
    \ IPv6 enabled in their DNS for some of the tested\n   host names one day before\
    \ World IPv6 Day, only 116 had it for the\n   \"www\" host name that is commonly\
    \ used when accessing a web site.  The\n   number of \"www\" host names with AAAA\
    \ records more than tripled during\n   World IPv6 Day, reaching 374 sites for\
    \ 3 consecutive measurement runs\n   (i.e., for at least 6 hours).  Also, the\
    \ number of AAAA records for\n   the \"www\" host name dropped steeply after the\
    \ day and remained at\n   around 160 sites after that.\n   Similar but more pronounced\
    \ trends can be seen if only the top 100 of\n   the most popular sites are taken\
    \ into considerations, as shown in\n   Figure 2.\n                           \
    \    [See the PDF.]\n    Figure 2: Number of sites with AAAA DNS records in the\
    \ top 100 most\n                               popular sites\n   Here, the number\
    \ of sites with some of the tested host names having a\n   AAAA record was initially\
    \ 14; then, it jumped to 36 during the day\n   and eventually dropped to 13. \
    \ Also, while none of the top 100 sites\n   apparently had a AAAA record for their\
    \ \"www\" host name before and\n   after World IPv6 day, during the day the number\
    \ peaked at 30.  Thus,\n   roughly one third of the 100 most popular sites had\
    \ IPv6 enabled for\n   World IPv6 Day.\n   Two other test sites in Sweden and\
    \ Canada experienced similar trends\n   with the DNS records.  However, one of\
    \ the sites used an external DNS\n   server that was part of whitelisting agreements.\
    \  There, the number\n   of sites with AAAA records before World IPv6 Day was\
    \ already higher\n   (more than 400), and hence the impact of the day was smaller,\
    \ because\n   the amount of sites increased to the same numbers as seen by the\
    \ test\n   site in Finland.  With the whitelisted DNS server, the number of\n\
    \   sites remained above 450 after the day.\n"

  - "4.2.  TCP Connection Setup\n   To test whether the IP addresses given by the\
    \ DNS actually provide\n   connectivity to the web site and whether there is any\
    \ difference in\n   the connection setup delay and failure rates with IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6, we\n   attempted to create TCP connections for all domains that contained\n\
    \   both A and AAAA DNS records.  The fraction of sites for which the\n   first\
    \ DNS response gave addresses that were not accessible with TCP\n   to port 80\
    \ over IPv4 or IPv6 is shown in Figure 3.\n                               [See\
    \ the PDF.]\n      Figure 3: TCP connection setup failure ratio (for the first\
    \ DNS\n                                 response)\n   There was a baseline failure\
    \ rate with IPv4 of around 1-3% that was\n   fairly static throughout the test\
    \ period.  For hosts with AAAA\n   records, the fraction of inaccessible sites\
    \ was much higher: in the\n   beginning, up to one fourth of the tested hosts\
    \ did not respond to\n   TCP connection attempts.  Much of this was likely due\
    \ to the various\n   test sites with different \"IPv6 prefixes\" (as discussed\
    \ in\n   Section 3); in the first run, more than half of the tested sites with\n\
    \   AAAA records used them for the first DNS response.  Also, some of the\n  \
    \ hosts were not even supposed to be accessed with HTTP but provided\n   AAAA\
    \ records for other purposes, while some sites had clear\n   configuration errors,\
    \ such as localhost or link-local IPv6 addresses.\n   As World IPv6 Day came closer,\
    \ the number of inaccessible IPv6 sites\n   decreased slowly and the number of\
    \ sites with AAAA records increased\n   at the same time, resulting in the failure\
    \ ratio dropping to roughly\n   20% before the day.  During the day, the number\
    \ of IPv6 sites\n   increased rapidly, but also the number of failures decreased,\
    \ and\n   hence, at the end of the day, the failure ratio dropped to just above\n\
    \   10%.  After World IPv6 Day, when many of the participating IPv6 hosts\n  \
    \ were taken off-line, the fraction of failed sites for IPv6 increased.\n   However,\
    \ since there was no increase in the absolute number of failed\n   sites, the\
    \ fraction of inaccessible sites remained at a lower level,\n   between 15% and\
    \ 20%, than before the day.\n"
- title: 4.3.  TCP Connection Delays
  contents:
  - "4.3.  TCP Connection Delays\n   For sites that were accessible with both IPv4\
    \ and IPv6, we measured\n   the time difference between establishing a TCP connection\
    \ with IPv4\n   and with IPv6.  We took the median (as defined in Section 11.3\
    \ of\n   [RFC2330]) of the time differences of all 10 connections, and then\n\
    \   the median and mean (of the median) over all sites.  The results are\n   shown\
    \ in Figure 4.\n                               [See the PDF.]\n      Figure 4:\
    \ TCP connection setup delay differences (IPv4 - IPv6)\n   In general, the delay\
    \ differences were small: the median of medians\n   remained less than 3 ms off\
    \ from zero (i.e., IPv4 and IPv6 delays\n   were equal), and even the mean, which\
    \ is more sensitive to outliers,\n   remained within +/-5 ms most of the time,\
    \ with the greatest spikes\n   reaching to roughly -15 ms (i.e., the mean of median\
    \ IPv6 delays was\n   15 ms larger than for IPv4 delays).  Closer inspection of\
    \ the results\n   shows that the spikes were often caused by only one site or\
    \ a handful\n   of sites with bad connectivity and multiple retransmissions of\
    \ TCP\n   SYN and ACK packets, resulting in connection setup delays an order of\n\
    \   magnitude larger than those for the other sites.\n   Surprisingly, the median\
    \ delay for IPv6 connections was, in most\n   cases, equal to or smaller than\
    \ the IPv4 delay, but during World IPv6\n   Day, the IPv6 delays increased slightly\
    \ and became (as a median)\n   slower than their IPv4 counterparts.  One reason\
    \ for such an effect\n   was that some of the sites that enabled IPv6 for World\
    \ IPv6 Day had\n   an extremely low IPv4 delay, less than 10 ms (e.g., due to\
    \ the\n   Content Delivery Network (CDN) provider hosting the IPv4 site), but\
    \ a\n   \"regular\" delay (over 100 ms) for the IPv6 host.\n   More detailed analysis\
    \ of the TCP connection setup delay differences,\n   and the reasons for them,\
    \ is left for future work.\n"
- title: 5.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "5.  Conclusions\n   World IPv6 Day had a very visible impact on the availability\
    \ of\n   content over IPv6, particularly when considering the top 100 content\n\
    \   providers.  It is difficult to find other examples of bigger one-day\n   swings\
    \ in some characteristics of the Internet.  However, the impact\n   on end users\
    \ was small, given that when dual-stack works correctly,\n   it should not be\
    \ visible at the user level, and given that IPv6\n   availability for end users\
    \ themselves is small.\n   The key conclusions are as follows:\n   o  On that\
    \ day, there was a large jump in the number of content\n      providers providing\
    \ AAAA DNS records.\n   o  On that day, there was a smaller but apparently permanent\
    \ increase\n      in the number of content providers supporting AAAA.\n   o  Large\
    \ and sudden swings in the relative amount of IPv4 vs. IPv6\n      traffic are\
    \ possible merely by supporting a dual-stack access\n      network and having\
    \ a few large content providers offer their\n      services either globally or\
    \ to a particular network over IPv6.\n   o  A large fraction of sites that published\
    \ AAAA records for a name\n      under their domain (be it \"www\", \"www6\",\
    \ or something else) were\n      actually not responding to TCP SYN requests on\
    \ IPv6.  This\n      fraction was far higher than that which we've seen in our\
    \ previous\n      measurements, and we are still determining why that was the\
    \ case.\n      Measurement errors or problems on our side of the network cannot\n\
    \      be ruled out at this stage.  In any case, it is also clear that as\n  \
    \    new sites joined, incomplete or in-progress configurations create\n     \
    \ more connectivity problems in the IPv6 Internet than we've seen\n      before.\
    \  Other measurements are needed to verify what the general\n      level of IPv6\
    \ connectivity is to addresses publicly listed in AAAA\n      records.\n   o \
    \ Even if the overall level of connection failures was high,\n      activities\
    \ on and around the IPv6 day appear to have caused a\n      significant permanent\
    \ drop in the number of these failures.\n   o  When IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity\
    \ were both available, their delay\n      characteristics appeared very similar.\
    \  In other words, most of\n      the providers that made IPv6 connectivity available\
    \ appear to have\n      provided a production-quality network.  TCP connection\
    \ setup delay\n      differences due to RTT differences between IPv4 and IPv6\n\
    \      connections were, in general, low.  In the remaining differences\n    \
    \  in our measurements, random packet loss played a major role.\n      However,\
    \ some sites could experience considerable differences\n      simply because of\
    \ different content distribution mechanisms used\n      for IPv4 and IPv6 content.\n\
    \   It is promising that the amount of the most popular Internet content\n   on\
    \ IPv6 was surprisingly high, roughly one third of top 100 sites\n   (during World\
    \ IPv6 Day or with whitelisting enabled).  However, other\n   content on the Internet\
    \ forms a long tail that is harder to move to\n   IPv6.  For instance, only 3%\
    \ of the 10,000 most popular web sites\n   provided their content over IPv6 before\
    \ World IPv6 Day.  On a\n   positive note, the top 100 sites form a very large\
    \ part of overall\n   Internet traffic [Labovitz], and thus even the top sites\
    \ moving to\n   IPv6 could represent a significant fraction of Internet traffic\
    \ on\n   IPv6.  However, this requires that users be enabled to use IPv6 in\n\
    \   their access networks.  We believe that this should be the goal of\n   future\
    \ global IPv6 efforts.\n"
