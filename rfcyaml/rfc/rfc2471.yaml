  - "1.0 Introduction\n   This document describes an allocation plan for IPv6 addresses\
    \ to be\n   used in testing IPv6 prototype software.  These addresses are\n  \
    \ temporary and will be reclaimed in the future.  Any IPv6 system using\n   these\
    \ addresses will have to renumber at some time in the future.\n   These addresses\
    \ will not to be routable in the Internet other than\n   for IPv6 testing.\n \
    \  The address format for the IPv6 test address is consistent with the\n   \"\
    Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Allocation\" [AGGR] and \"TLA and\n   NLA\
    \ Assignment Rules\" [TLAASN].\n   This document is intended to replace RFC 1897\
    \ \"IPv6 Testing Address\n   Allocation\", January 1996.  RFC 1897 will become\
    \ historic.\n   The addresses described in this document are consistent with the\
    \ IPv6\n   Addressing Architecture [ARCH].  They may be assigned to nodes\n  \
    \ manually, with IPv6 Auto Address Allocation [AUTO], or with DHCP for\n   IPv6\
    \ [DHCPv6].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.0 Address Format
  contents:
  - "2.0 Address Format\n   The Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Allocation format\
    \ defined in\n   [AGGR] is as follows:\n      | 3 |  13 |    32     |   16   |\
    \          64 bits               |\n      +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+\n\
    \      |FP | TLA | NLA ID    | SLA ID |         Interface ID           |\n   \
    \   |   | ID  |           |        |                                |\n      +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+\n\
    \   where:\n      FP = 001 = Format Prefix\n           This is the Format Prefix\
    \ used to identify aggregatable\n           global unicast addresses.\n      TLA\
    \ = 0x1FFE = Top-Level Aggregation Identifier\n           This is a TLA ID assigned\
    \ by the IANA for 6bone testing under\n           the auspices of the IETF IPng\
    \ Transition Working Group 6bone\n           testbed activity.  It is to be administered\
    \ by the chair of\n           the 6bone activity (currently Bob Fink <rlfink@lbl.gov>).\n\
    \           The use of this TLA ID is temporary.  All users of these\n       \
    \    addresses in this TLA ID will be required to renumber at some\n         \
    \  time in the future.\n      NLA ID = Next-Level Aggregation Identifier\n   \
    \        The NLA ID space will be assigned, by the TLA ID\n           administrator,\
    \ in an addressing hierarchy sufficient to\n           identify transit networks\
    \ and end user sites consistent with\n           the architecture and topology\
    \ of the 6bone. This will provide\n           a multi-level transit service consistent\
    \ with the 6bone goals\n           of fully testing IPv6 technology in real use\
    \ environments.\n      SLA ID = Site-Level Aggregation Identifier\n          \
    \ The SLA ID field is used by an individual organization to\n           create\
    \ its own local addressing hierarchy and to identify\n           subnets.  Assignment\
    \ of the SLA ID field is the\n           responsibility of each individual organization.\n\
    \      Interface ID\n           This is the interface identifier of the interface\
    \ on the link\n           as defined in the appropriate IPv6 over <link> document,\
    \ such\n           as [ETHER], [FDDI], etc.\n"
