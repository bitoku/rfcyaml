  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo obsoletes RFC 1700 (STD 2) \"Assigned Numbers\", which\n\
    \   contained an October 1994 snapshot of assigned Internet protocol\n   parameters.\n"
- title: Description
  contents:
  - "Description\n   From November 1977 through October 1994, the Internet Assigned\n\
    \   Numbers Authority (IANA) periodically published tables of the\n   Internet\
    \ protocol parameter assignments in RFCs entitled, \"Assigned\n   Numbers\". \
    \ The most current of these Assigned Numbers RFCs had\n   Standard status and\
    \ carried the designation: STD 2.  At this time,\n   the latest STD 2 is RFC 1700.\n\
    \   Since 1994, this sequence of RFCs have been replaced by an online\n   database\
    \ accessible through a web page (currently, www.iana.org).\n   The purpose of\
    \ the present RFC is to note this fact and to officially\n   obsolete RFC 1700,\
    \ whose status changes to Historic.  RFC 1700 is\n   obsolete, and its values\
    \ are incomplete and in some cases may be\n   wrong.\n   We expect this series\
    \ to be revived in the future by the new IANA\n   organization.\n"
