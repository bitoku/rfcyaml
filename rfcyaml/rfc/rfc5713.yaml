  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate\
    \ QoS-\n   related, service-related, and subscriber-related configurations and\n\
    \   operations between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node\n   (e.g.,\
    \ a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)).\n   [ANCP-FRAME] illustrates\
    \ the framework, usage scenarios, and general\n   requirements for ANCP.  This\
    \ document focuses on describing security\n   threats and deriving security requirements\
    \ for the Access Node\n   Control Protocol, considering the ANCP use cases defined\
    \ in\n   [ANCP-FRAME] as well as the guidelines for IETF protocols' security\n\
    \   requirements given in [RFC3365].  Section 5 and Section 6,\n   respectively,\
    \ describe the potential attacks and the different attack\n   forms that are liable\
    \ to take place within ANCP, while Section 7\n   applies the described potential\
    \ attacks to ANCP and its different use\n   cases.  Security policy negotiation,\
    \ including authentication and\n   authorization to define the per-subscriber\
    \ policy at the policy/AAA\n   (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)\
    \ server, is out of the\n   scope of this work.  As a high-level summary, the\
    \ following aspects\n   need to be considered:\n   Message Protection:\n     \
    \ Signaling message content can be protected against eavesdropping,\n      modification,\
    \ injection, and replay while in transit.  This\n      applies to both ANCP headers\
    \ and payloads.\n   Prevention against Impersonation:\n      It is important that\
    \ protection be available against a device\n      impersonating an ANCP node (i.e.,\
    \ an unauthorized device\n      generating an ANCP message and pretending it was\
    \ generated by a\n      valid ANCP node).\n   Prevention of Denial-of-Service\
    \ Attacks:\n      ANCP nodes and the network have finite resources (state storage,\n\
    \      processing power, bandwidth).  It is important to protect against\n   \
    \   exhaustion attacks on these resources and to prevent ANCP nodes\n      from\
    \ being used to launch attacks on other network elements.\n"

- title: 3.  System Overview and Threat Model
  contents:
  - "3.  System Overview and Threat Model\n   As described in [ANCP-FRAME] and schematically\
    \ shown in Figure 1, the\n   Access Node Control system consists of the following\
    \ components:\n   Network Access Server (NAS):\n      A NAS provides access to\
    \ a service (e.g., network access) and\n      operates as a client of the AAA\
    \ protocol.  The AAA client is\n      responsible for passing authentication information\
    \ to designated\n      AAA servers and then acting on the response that is returned.\n\
    \   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server:\n      A AAA server\
    \ is responsible for authenticating users, authorizing\n      access to services,\
    \ and returning authorization information\n      (including configuration parameters)\
    \ back to the AAA client to\n      deliver service to the user.  As a consequence,\
    \ service usage\n      accounting might be enabled and information about the user's\n\
    \      resource usage will be sent to the AAA server.\n   Access Node (AN):\n\
    \      The AN is a network device, usually located at a service provider\n   \
    \   central office or street cabinet, that terminates access-loop\n      connections\
    \ from subscribers.  In case the access loop is a\n      Digital Subscriber Line\
    \ (DSL), this is often referred to as a DSL\n      Access Multiplexer (DSLAM).\n\
    \   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE):\n      A CPE is a device located inside\
    \ a subscriber's premise that is\n      connected at the LAN side of the Home\
    \ Gateway (HGW).\n   Home Gateway (HGW):\n      The HGW connects the different\
    \ Customer Premises Equipments (CPEs)\n      to the Access Node and the access\
    \ network.  In case of DSL, the\n      HGW is a DSL Network Termination (NT) that\
    \ could either operate as\n      a layer 2 bridge or as a layer 3 router.  In\
    \ the latter case, such\n      a device is also referred to as a Routing Gateway\
    \ (RG).\n   Aggregation Network:\n      The aggregation network provides traffic\
    \ aggregation from multiple\n      ANs towards the NAS.  ATM or Ethernet transport\
    \ technologies can\n      be used.\n   For the threat analysis, this document\
    \ focuses on the ANCP\n   communication between the Access Node and the NAS. \
    \ However,\n   communications with the other components (such as HGW, CPE, and\
    \ the\n   AAA server) play a role in the understanding of the system\n   architecture\
    \ and of what triggers ANCP communications.  Note that the\n   NAS and the AN\
    \ might belong to two different administrative realms.\n   The threat model and\
    \ the security requirements in this document\n   consider this latter case.\n\
    \                                                             +--------+\n   \

    \                         Figure 1: System Overview\n   In the absence of an attack,\
    \ the NAS receives configuration\n   information from the AAA server related to\
    \ a CPE attempting to access\n   the network.  A number of parameters, including\
    \ Quality of Service\n   information, need to be conveyed to the Access Node in\
    \ order to\n   become effective.  The Access Node Control Protocol is executed\n\
    \   between the NAS and the AN to initiate control requests.  The AN\n   returns\
    \ responses to these control requests and provides information\n   reports.\n\
    \   For this to happen, the following individual steps must occur:\n   o  The\
    \ AN discovers the NAS.\n   o  The AN needs to start the protocol communication\
    \ with the NAS to\n      announce its presence.\n   o  The AN and the NAS perform\
    \ a capability exchange.\n   o  The NAS sends requests to the AN.\n   o  The AN\
    \ processes these requests, authorizes the actions, and\n      responds with the\
    \ appropriate answer.  In order to fulfill the\n      commands, it might be necessary\
    \ for the AN to communicate with the\n      HGW or other nodes, for example, as\
    \ part of a keep-alive\n      mechanism.\n   o  The AN provides status reports\
    \ to the NAS.\n   Attackers can be:\n   o  off-path, i.e., they cannot see the\
    \ messages exchanged between the\n      AN and the NAS;\n   o  on-path, i.e.,\
    \ they can see the messages exchanged between the AN\n      and the NAS.\n   Both\
    \ off-path and on-path attackers can be:\n   o  passive, i.e., they do not participate\
    \ in the network operation\n      but rather listen to all transfers to obtain\
    \ the maximum possible\n      information;\n   o  active, i.e., they participate\
    \ in the network operation and can\n      inject falsified packets.\n   We assume\
    \ the following threat model:\n   o  An off-path adversary located at the CPE\
    \ or the HGW.\n   o  An off-path adversary located on the Internet or a regional\n\
    \      network that connects one or more NASes and associated access\n      networks\
    \ to Network Service Providers (NSPs) and Application\n      Service Providers\
    \ (ASPs).\n   o  An on-path adversary located at network elements between the\
    \ AN\n      and the NAS.\n   o  An on-path adversary taking control over the NAS.\n\
    \   o  An on-path adversary taking control over the AN.\n"
- title: 4.  Objectives of Attackers
  contents:
  - "4.  Objectives of Attackers\n   Attackers may direct their efforts either against\
    \ an individual\n   entity or against a large portion of the access network. \
    \ Attacks\n   fall into three classes:\n   o  Attacks to disrupt the communication\
    \ for individual customers.\n   o  Attacks to disrupt the communication of a large\
    \ fraction of\n      customers in an access network.  These also include attacks\
    \ to the\n      network itself or a portion of it, such as attacks to disrupt\
    \ the\n      network services or attacks to destruct the network functioning.\n\
    \   o  Attacks to gain profit for the attacker through modifying the QoS\n   \
    \   settings.  Also, through replaying old packets (of another\n      privileged\
    \ client, for instance), an attacker can attempt to\n      configure a better\
    \ QoS profile on its own DSL line, increasing its\n      own benefit.\n"
- title: 5.  Potential Attacks
  contents:
  - "5.  Potential Attacks\n   This section discusses the different types of attacks\
    \ against ANCP,\n   while Section 6 describes the possible means of their occurrence.\n\
    \   ANCP is mainly susceptible to the following types of attacks:\n"
- title: 5.1.  Denial of Service (DoS)
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Denial of Service (DoS)\n   A number of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks\
    \ can cause ANCP nodes to\n   malfunction.  When state is established or certain\
    \ functions are\n   performed without requiring prior authorization, there is\
    \ a chance to\n   mount denial-of-service attacks.  An adversary can utilize this\
    \ fact\n   to transmit a large number of signaling messages to allocate state\
    \ at\n   nodes and to cause consumption of resources.  Also, an adversary,\n \
    \  through DoS, can prevent certain subscribers from accessing certain\n   services.\
    \  Moreover, DoS can take place at the AN or the NAS\n   themselves, where it\
    \ is possible for the NAS (or the AN) to\n   intentionally ignore the requests\
    \ received from the AN (or the NAS)\n   through not replying to them.  This causes\
    \ the sender of the request\n   to retransmit the request, which might allocate\
    \ additional state at\n   the sender side to process the reply.  Allocating more\
    \ state may\n   result in memory depletion.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Integrity Violation
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Integrity Violation\n   Adversaries gaining illegitimate access on the\
    \ transferred messages\n   can act on these messages, causing integrity violation.\
    \  Integrity\n   violation can cause unexpected network behavior, leading to a\n\
    \   disturbance in the network services as well as in the network\n   functioning.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Downgrading
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Downgrading\n   Protocols may be useful in a variety of scenarios with\
    \ different\n   security and functional requirements.  Different parts of a network\n\
    \   (e.g., within a building, across a public carrier's network, or over\n   a\
    \ private microwave link) may need different levels of protection.\n   It is often\
    \ difficult to meet these (sometimes conflicting)\n   requirements with a single\
    \ mechanism or fixed set of parameters;\n   thus, often a selection of mechanisms\
    \ and parameters is offered.  A\n   protocol is required to agree on certain (security)\
    \ mechanisms and\n   parameters.  An insecure parameter exchange or security negotiation\n\
    \   protocol can give an adversary the opportunity to mount a downgrading\n  \
    \ attack to force selection of mechanisms weaker than those mutually\n   desired.\
    \  Thus, without binding the negotiation process to the\n   legitimate parties\
    \ and protecting it, ANCP might only be as secure as\n   the weakest mechanism\
    \ provided (e.g., weak authentication) and the\n   benefits of defining configuration\
    \ parameters and a negotiation\n   protocol are lost.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Traffic Analysis
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Traffic Analysis\n   An adversary can be placed at the NAS, the AN, or\
    \ any other network\n   element capturing all traversing packets.  Adversaries\
    \ can thus have\n   unauthorized information access.  As well, they can gather\n\
    \   information relevant to the network and then use this information in\n   gaining\
    \ later unauthorized access.  This attack can also help\n   adversaries in other\
    \ malicious purposes -- for example, capturing\n   messages sent from the AN to\
    \ the NAS announcing that a DSL line is up\n   and containing some information\
    \ related to the connected client.\n   This could be any form of information about\
    \ the client and could also\n   be an indicator of whether or not the DSL subscriber\
    \ is at home at a\n   particular moment.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Management Attacks
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Management Attacks\n   Since the ANCP sessions are configured in the AN\
    \ and not in the NAS\n   [ANCP-FRAME], most configurations of ANCP are done in\
    \ the AN.\n   Consequently, the management attacks to ANCP mainly concern the\
    \ AN\n   configuration phase.  In this context, the AN MIB module could create\n\
    \   disclosure- and misconfiguration-related attacks.  [ANCP-MIB] defines\n  \
    \ the vulnerabilities on the management objects within the AN MIB\n   module.\
    \  These attacks mainly concern the unauthorized changes of the\n   management\
    \ objects, leading to a number of attacks such as session\n   deletion, a session\
    \ using an undesired/unsupported protocol,\n   disabling certain ANCP capabilities\
    \ or enabling undesired\n   capabilities, ANCP packets being sent out to the wrong\
    \ interface (and\n   thus being received by an unintended receiver), harming the\n\
    \   synchronization between the AN and the NAS, and impacting traffic in\n   the\
    \ network other than ANCP.\n"
- title: 6.  Attack Forms
  contents:
  - "6.  Attack Forms\n   The attacks mentioned above in Section 5 can be carried\
    \ out through\n   the following means:\n   Message Replay:\n      This threat\
    \ scenario covers the case in which an adversary\n      eavesdrops, collects signaling\
    \ messages, and replays them at a\n      later time (or at a different place or\
    \ in a different way; e.g.,\n      cut-and-paste attacks).  Through replaying\
    \ signaling messages, an\n      adversary might mount denial-of-service and theft-of-service\n\
    \      attacks.\n   Faked Message Injection:\n      An adversary may be able to\
    \ inject false error or response\n      messages, causing unexpected protocol\
    \ behavior and succeeding with\n      a DoS attack.  This could be achieved at\
    \ the signaling-protocol\n      level, at the level of specific signaling parameters\
    \ (e.g., QoS\n      information), or at the transport layer.  An adversary might,\
    \ for\n      example, inject a signaling message to request allocation of QoS\n\
    \      resources.  As a consequence, other users' traffic might be\n      impacted.\
    \  The discovery protocol, especially, exhibits\n      vulnerabilities with regard\
    \ to this threat scenario.\n   Messages Modification:\n      This involves integrity\
    \ violation, where an adversary can modify\n      signaling messages in order\
    \ to cause unexpected network behavior.\n      Possible related actions an adversary\
    \ might consider for its\n      attack are the reordering and delaying of messages,\
    \ causing a\n      protocol's process failure.\n   Man-in-the-Middle:\n      An\
    \ adversary might claim to be a NAS or an AN, acting as a man-in-\n      the-middle\
    \ to later cause communication and services disruption.\n      The consequence\
    \ can range from DoS to fraud.  An adversary acting\n      as a man-in-the-middle\
    \ could modify the intercepted messages,\n      causing integrity violation, or\
    \ could drop or truncate the\n      intercepted messages, causing DoS and a protocol's\
    \ process\n      failure.  In addition, a man-in-the-middle adversary can signal\n\
    \      information to an illegitimate entity in place of the right\n      destination.\
    \  In this case, the protocol could appear to continue\n      working correctly.\
    \  This may result in an AN contacting a wrong\n      NAS.  For the AN, this could\
    \ mean that the protocol failed for\n      unknown reasons.  A man-in-the-middle\
    \ adversary can also cause\n      downgrading attacks through initiating faked\
    \ configuration\n      parameters and through forcing selection of weak security\n\
    \      parameters or mechanisms.\n   Eavesdropping:\n      This is related to\
    \ adversaries that are able to eavesdrop on\n      transferred messages.  The\
    \ collection of the transferred packets\n      by an adversary may allow traffic\
    \ analysis or be used later to\n      mount replay attacks.  The eavesdropper\
    \ might learn QoS\n      parameters, communication patterns, policy rules for\
    \ firewall\n      traversal, policy information, application identifiers, user\n\
    \      identities, NAT bindings, authorization objects, network\n      configuration,\
    \ performance information, and more.\n"

    \ transfer between the NAS and the AAA server, when this data is\n   used within\
    \ the ANCP operation.\n   Besides the attacks against the four ANCP use cases\
    \ described in the\n   following subsections, ANCP is susceptible to a number\

    \   the-middle attacks, which could be as follows:\n   o  Attacks during the session\
    \ initiation from the AN to the NAS:\n      DoS attacks could take place affecting\
    \ the session-establishment\n      process.  Also, man-in-the-middle attacks could\
    \ take place,\n      causing message truncation or message modification and leading\
    \ to\n      session-establishment failure.\n   o  Attacks during the peering establishment:\n\
    \      DoS attacks could take place during state synchronization between\n   \
    \   the AN and the NAS.  Also, man-in-the-middle attacks could take\n      place\

  - "7.1.  Dynamic Access-Loop Attributes\n   This use case concerns the communication\
    \ of access-loop attributes\n   for dynamic, access-line topology discovery. \
    \ Since the access-loop\n   rate may change over time, advertisement is beneficial\
    \ to the NAS to\n   gain knowledge about the topology of the access network for\
    \ QoS\n   scheduling.  Besides data rates and access-loop links identification,\n\
    \   other information may also be transferred from the AN to the NAS\n   (examples\
    \ in case of a DSL access loop are DSL type, maximum\n   achievable data rate,\
    \ and maximum data rate configured for the access\n   loop).  This use case is\
    \ thus vulnerable to a number of on-path and\n   off-path attacks that can be\
    \ either active or passive.\n   On-path attacks can take place between the AN\
    \ and the NAS, on the AN\n   or on the NAS, during the access-loop attributes\
    \ transfer.  These\n   attacks may be:\n   o  Active, acting on the transferred\
    \ attributes and injecting\n      falsified packets.  The main attacks here are:\n\
    \      *  Man-in-the-middle attacks can cause access-loop attributes\n       \
    \  transfer between the AN and a forged NAS or a forged AN and the\n         NAS,\
    \ which can directly cause faked attributes and message\n         modification\
    \ or truncation.\n      *  Signaling replay, by an attacker between the AN and\
    \ the NAS, on\n         the AN or on the NAS itself, causing DoS.\n      *  An\
    \ adversary acting as man-in-the-middle can cause downgrading\n         through\
    \ changing the actual data rate of the access loop, which\n         impacts the\

    \ connection state, and thus\n         impacting their privacy protection.\n \
    \     *  Traffic analysis allowing unauthorized information access,\n        \
    \ which could allow later unauthorized access to the NAS.\n   Off-path attacks\
    \ can take place on the Internet, affecting the\n   access-loop attribute sharing\
    \ between the NAS and the AAA/policy\n   server.  These attacks may be:\n   o\
    \  Active attacks, which are mainly concerning:\n      *  DoS through flooding\
    \ the communication links to the AAA/policy\n         server, causing service\

- title: 7.2.  Access-Loop Configuration
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Access-Loop Configuration\n   This use case concerns the dynamic, local-loop\
    \ line configuration\n   through allowing the NAS to change the access-loop parameters\
    \ (e.g.,\n   rate) in a dynamic fashion.  This allows for centralized, subscriber-\n\
    \   related service data.  This dynamic configuration can be achieved,\n   for\
    \ instance, through profiles that are pre-configured on ANs.  This\n   use case\
    \ is vulnerable to a number of on-path and off-path attacks.\n   On-path attacks\
    \ can take place where the attacker is between the AN\n   and the NAS, is on the\
    \ AN, or is on the NAS.  These can be as\n   follows:\n   o  Active attacks, taking\
    \ the following forms:\n      *  DoS attacks of the AN can take place by an attacker,\
    \ through\n         replaying the Configure Request messages.\n      *  An attacker\
    \ on the AN can prevent the AN from reacting on the\n         NAS request for\
    \ the access-loop configuration, leading to the\n         NAS continually sending\
    \ the Configure Request message and,\n         hence, allocating additional states.\n\
    \      *  Damaging clients' profiles at ANs can take place by adversaries\n  \
    \       that gained control on the network through discovery of users'\n     \
    \    information from a previous traffic analysis.\n      *  An adversary can\
    \ replay old packets, modify messages, or inject\n         faked messages.  Such\
    \ adversary can also be a man-in-the-\n         middle.  These attack forms can\
    \ be related to a privileged\n         client profile (having more services) in\
    \ order to configure\n         this profile on the adversary's own DSL line, which\
    \ is less\n         privileged.  In order that the attacker does not expose its\n\
    \         identity, he may also use these attack forms related to the\n      \
    \   privileged client profile to configure a number of illegitimate\n        \
    \ DSL lines.  The adversary can also force configuration\n         parameters\
    \ other than the selected ones, leading to, for\n         instance, downgrading\
    \ the service for a privileged client.\n   o  Passive attacks, where the attacker\
    \ listens to the ANCP messages.\n      This can take place as follows:\n     \
    \ *  Learning configuration attributes is possible during the update\n       \
    \  of the access-loop configuration.  An adversary might profit to\n         see\
    \ the configuration that someone else gets (e.g., one ISP\n         might be interested\
    \ to know what the customers of another ISP\n         get and therefore might\
    \ break into the AN to see this).\n   Off-path attacks can take place as follows:\n\
    \   o  An off-path passive adversary on the Internet can exert\n      eavesdropping\
    \ during the access-loop configuration retrieval by\n      the NAS from the AAA/policy\
    \ server.\n   o  An off-path active adversary on the Internet can threaten the\n\
    \      centralized subscribers-related service data in the AAA/policy\n      server\
    \ through, for instance, making subscribers' records\n      inaccessible.\n"
- title: 7.3.  Remote Connectivity Test
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Remote Connectivity Test\n   In this use case, the NAS can carry out a\
    \ Remote Connectivity Test\n   using ANCP to initiate an access-loop test between\
    \ the AN and the\n   HGW.  Thus, multiple access-loop technologies can be supported.\
    \  This\n   use case is vulnerable to a number of active attacks.  Most of the\n\
    \   attacks in this use case concern the network operation.\n   On-path active\
    \ attacks can take place in the following forms:\n   o  Man-in-the-middle attack\
    \ during the NAS's triggering to the AN to\n      carry out the test, where an\
    \ adversary can inject falsified\n      signals or can truncate the triggering.\n\
    \   o  Message modification can take place during the Subscriber Response\n  \
    \    message transfer from the AN to the NAS announcing the test\n      results,\
    \ causing failure of the test operation.\n   o  An adversary on the AN can prevent\
    \ the AN from sending the\n      Subscriber Response message to the NAS announcing\
    \ the test\n      results, and hence the NAS will continue triggering the AN to\n\
    \      carry out the test, which results in more state being allocated at\n  \
    \    the NAS.  This may result in unavailability of the NAS to the ANs.\n   Off-path\
    \ active attacks can take place as follows:\n   o  An adversary can cause DoS\
    \ during the access-loop test, in case of\n      an ATM-based access loop, when\
    \ the AN generates loopback cells.\n      This can take place through signal replaying.\n\
    \   o  Message truncating can take place by an adversary during the\n      access-loop\
    \ test, which can lead to service disruption due to\n      assumption of test\
    \ failures.\n"
- title: 7.4.  Multicast
  contents:
  - "7.4.  Multicast\n   In this use case, ANCP could be used in exchanging information\n\
    \   between the AN and the NAS, allowing the AN to perform replication\n   inline\
    \ with the policy and configuration of the subscriber.  Also,\n   this allows\
    \ the NAS to follow subscribers' multicast (source, group)\n   membership and\
    \ control replication performed by the AN.  Four\n   multicast use cases are expected\
    \ to take place, making use of ANCP;\n   these are typically multicast conditional\
    \ access, multicast admission\n   control, multicast accounting, and spontaneous\
    \ admission response.\n   This section gives a high-level description of the possible\
    \ attacks\n   that can take place in these cases.  Attacks that can occur are\n\
    \   mostly active attacks.\n   On-path active attacks can be as follows:\n   o\
    \  DoS attacks, causing inability for certain subscribers to access\n      particular\
    \ multicast streams or only access the multicast stream\n      at a reduced bandwidth,\
    \ impacting the quality of the possible\n      video stream.  This can take place\
    \ through message replay by an\n      attacker between the AN and the NAS, on\
    \ the AN or on the NAS.\n      Such DoS attacks can also be done by tempering,\
    \ for instance, with\n      white/black list configuration or by placing attacks\
    \ to the\n      bandwidth-admission-control mechanism.\n   o  An adversary on\
    \ the NAS can prevent the NAS from reacting on the\n      AN requests for white/black/grey\
    \ lists or for admission control\n      for the access line.  The AN in this case\
    \ would not receive a\n      reply and would continue sending its requests, resulting\
    \ in more\n      states being allocated at the AN.  A similar case happens for\n\
    \      admission control when the NAS can also send requests to the AN.\n    \
    \  When the NAS does not receive a response, it could also retransmit\n      requests,\
    \ resulting in more state being allocated at the NAS side\n      to process responses.\
    \  This may result in the unavailability of\n      the NAS to the ANs.\n   o \
    \ Man-in-the-middle, causing the exchange of messages between the AN\n      and\
    \ a forged NAS or a forged AN and the NAS.  This can lead to the\n      following:\n\
    \      *  Message modification, which can cause service downgrading for\n    \
    \     legitimate subscribers -- for instance, an illegitimate change\n       \
    \  of a subscriber's policy.\n      *  Message truncation between the AN and the\
    \ NAS, which can result\n         in the non-continuity of services.\n      *\
    \  Message replay between the AN and the NAS, on the AN or on the\n         NAS,\
    \ leading to a DoS or services fraud.\n      *  Message modification to temper\
    \ with accounting information, for\n         example, in order to avoid service\
    \ charges or, conversely, in\n         order to artificially increase service\
    \ charges on other users.\n   An off-path active attack is as follows:\n   o \
    \ DoS could take place through message replay of join/leave requests\n      by\
    \ the HGW or CPE, frequently triggering the ANCP activity between\n      the AN\
    \ and the NAS.  DoS could also result from generating heaps\n      of IGMP join/leaves\
    \ by the HGW or CPE, leading to very high rate\n      of ANCP query/response.\n"
