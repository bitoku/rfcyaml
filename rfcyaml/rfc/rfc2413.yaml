  - "2. Abstract\n   The Dublin Core Metadata Workshop Series began in 1995 with an\n\
    \   invitational workshop which brought together librarians, digital\n   library\
    \ researchers, content experts, and text-markup experts to\n   promote better\
    \ discovery standards for electronic resources.  The\n   Dublin Core is a 15-element\
    \ set of descriptors that has emerged from\n   this effort in interdisciplinary\
    \ and international consensus\n   building.  This is the first of a set of Informational\
    \ RFCs\n   describing the Dublin Core.  Its purpose is to introduce the Dublin\n\
    \   Core and to describe the consensus reached on the semantics of each\n   of\
    \ the 15 elements.\n"

  contents:
  - "3. Introduction\n   Finding relevant information on the World Wide Web has become\n\
    \   increasingly problematic due to the explosive growth of networked\n   resources.\
    \  Current Web indexing evolved rapidly to fill the demand\n   for resource discovery\
    \ tools, but that indexing, while useful, is a\n   poor substitute for richer\
    \ varieties of resource description.\n   An invitational workshop held in March\
    \ of 1995 brought together\n   librarians, digital library researchers, and text-markup\
    \ specialists\n   to address the problem of resource discovery for networked resources.\n\
    \   This activity evolved into a series of related workshops and\n   ancillary\
    \ activities that have become known collectively as the\n   Dublin Core Metadata\
    \ Workshop Series.\n   The goals that motivate the Dublin Core effort are:\n \
    \      - Simplicity of creation and maintenance\n       - Commonly understood\
    \ semantics\n       - Conformance to existing and emerging standards\n       -\
    \ International scope and applicability\n       - Extensibility\n       - Interoperability\
    \ among collections and indexing systems\n   These requirements work at cross\
    \ purposes to some degree, but all are\n   desirable goals.  Much of the effort\
    \ of the Workshop Series has been\n   directed at minimizing the tensions among\
    \ these goals.\n   One of the primary deliverables of this effort is a set of\
    \ elements\n   that are judged by the collective participants of these workshops\
    \ to\n   be the core elements for cross-disciplinary resource discovery.  The\n\
    \   term \"Dublin Core\" applies to this core of descriptive elements.\n   Early\
    \ experience with Dublin Core deployment has made clear the need\n   to support\
    \ qualification of elements for some applications.  Thus, a\n   Dublin Core element\
    \ may be expressed without qualification (as\n   described in this RFC) or with\
    \ qualifiers that refine its semantics\n   (the subject of future RFCs).  For\
    \ the sake of interoperability,\n   simple indexing and discovery tools should\
    \ be able to ignore any\n   qualifiers provided, while more advanced, semantically\
    \ richer tools\n   should be able to use qualifiers to support more specialized\
    \ or\n   precise discovery.\n   The broad agreements about syntax and semantics\
    \ that have emerged\n   from the workshop series will be expressed in a series\
    \ of\n   Informational RFCs, of which this document is the first.\n"
- title: 4. Description of Dublin Core Elements
  contents:
  - "4. Description of Dublin Core Elements\n   The following is the reference definition\
    \ of the Dublin Core Metadata\n   Element Set.  Further information about the\
    \ Dublin Core Metadata\n   Element Set is available at [1]:\n       http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core\n\
    \   In the element descriptions below, each element has a descriptive\n   name\
    \ intended to convey a common semantic understanding of the\n   element, as well\
    \ as a formal single-word label intended to make the\n   syntactic specification\
    \ of elements simpler for encoding schemes.\n   Although some environments, such\
    \ as HTML, are not case-sensitive, it\n   is recommended best practice always\
    \ to adhere to the case conventions\n   in the element labels given below to avoid\
    \ conflicts in the event\n   that the metadata is subsequently extracted or converted\
    \ to a case-\n   sensitive environment, such as XML (Extensible Markup Language)\
    \ [2].\n   Each element is optional and repeatable.  Metadata elements may\n \
    \  appear in any order.  The ordering of multiple occurrences of the\n   same\
    \ element (e.g., Creator) may have a significance intended by the\n   provider,\
    \ but ordering is not guaranteed to be preserved in every\n   system.\n   To promote\
    \ global interoperability, a number of the element\n   descriptions suggest a\
    \ controlled vocabulary for the respective\n   element values.  It is assumed\
    \ that other controlled vocabularies\n   will be developed for interoperability\
    \ within certain local domains.\n   The metadata elements fall into three groups\
    \ which roughly indicate\n   the class or scope of information stored in them:\
    \ (1) elements\n   related mainly to the Content of the resource, (2) elements\
    \ related\n   mainly to the resource when viewed as Intellectual Property, and\
    \ (3)\n   elements related mainly to the Instantiation of the resource.\n    \
    \    Content          Intellectual Property       Instantiation\n        -----------\
    \      ---------------------       -------------\n        Title              \
    \   Creator                  Date\n        Subject               Publisher   \
