  - "Abstract\n   The Common Indexing Protocol ([CIP1]) is designed to facilitate\
    \ the\n   creation not only of query referral indexes, but also of meshes of\n\
    \   (loosely) affiliated referral indexes.  The purpose of such a mesh of\n  \
    \ servers is to implement some kind of distributed sharing of indexing\n   and/or\
    \ searching tasks across different servers.  So far, the TISDAG\n   (Technical\
    \ Infrastructure for Swedish Directory Access Gateways)\n   project ([TISDAG],\
    \ [DAGEXP]) has focused on creating a single\n   referral index; the obvious next\
    \ step is to integrate that into a\n   larger set of interoperating services.\n"

  - "1.1 Overview of mesh possibilities\n   Two different possibilities are possible\
    \ for extending the TISDAG\n   service to a mesh model (or some combination of\
    \ both).  First, it\n   should be possible to create a mesh of DAG-based services.\
    \  Or, it\n   might be interesting to use the mesh architecture to incorporate\n\
    \   access to other types of services (e.g., the Norwegian Directory of\n   Directories).\
    \  In either case, the basic principle for establishing a\n   mesh is that interoperating\
    \ services should exchange index objects,\n   according to the architecture of\
    \ the mesh (e.g., hierarchical, or\n   graph-like, preferably without loops!).\n\
    \   As is outlined in the CIP documentation ([CIP1]), many possibilities\n   exist\
    \ for mechanisms for creating indexes over multiple referral\n   servers -- for\
    \ example, WDSP index objects could be passed along\n   untouched, or a referral\
    \ index server's contents could be aggregated\n   into a new index object, generating\
    \ referrals back to that server.\n   The proposal is that the mesh should be constructed\
    \ using index\n   objects aggregated over participating services' servers.  That\
    \ is,\n   referrals will be generated to other recognized services, not their\n\
    \   individual participants.  This can be done as a hierarchy or a level\n   mesh\
    \ one-layer deep, but the important reason for not simply passing\n   forward\
    \ index objects (unaggregated) is that individual services may\n   support different\
    \ ranges of access protocols, have particular\n   security requirements, etc.\
    \  Referrals should be directed to a CAP or\n   CAPs -- either the standard ones\
    \ used by the DAG system, or new ones\n   established to support particular semantics\
    \ of remote systems (e.g.,\n   other query types, etc).  Within a given DAG system,\
    \  referrals to\n   these remote servers will look just like any other referral,\
    \ although\n   a particular SAP or SAPs may be established to provide query\n\
    \   fulfillment (again, to enable translations between variations of\n   service,\
    \ to allow secure access if the relationship between the\n   services is restricted,\
    \ etc).\n   In the following scenarios of mesh traversal, the assumption is that\n\
    \   the primary service in discussion (Country A in Scenario 1, Country B\n  \
    \ in Scenario 2) is a DAG-based service.  The scenarios are presented\n   in the\
    \ light of interoperating DAG services, but in most cases it\n   would be equally\
    \ applicable if the remote service was provided by\n   some other service architecture.\
    \  Again, the key element for\n   establishing a mesh of any sort is the exchange\
    \ of the CIP index\n   object, not internal system architecture.\n"

  - "1.1.1  Scenario 1:  Top Down\n   Suppose 2 countries tie their services together.\
    \  A user makes a\n   query in Country A.  A certain number of hits are made against\
    \ the\n   index objects of A's WDSPs.  There is also a hit in the aggregate\n\
    \   index of Country B.  There are 3 possible cases under which this must\n  \
    \ be handled:\n   Case 1:\n   Country A and Country B are running services that\
    \ are essentially the\n   same -- in terms of protocols, queries, and schema that\
    \ are\n   supported.  In this case, one referral should be generated per\n   protocol\
    \ supported by Country B's service.  The referral can be\n   passed back as far\
    \ as the client, if its protocol supports referrals.\n   Alternatively, the CAP\
    \ may chain the referral through an appropriate\n   SAP, in the usual fashion.\
    \  In other words, the CAPs of Country B's\n   service act as WDSPs to Country\
    \ A's service.\n   Consider the following illustration (only relevant CAPs, SAPs,\

    \ that referral, which the client takes\n          to the Country B DAG system\
    \ directly (to find out which, if\n          any, B-WDSP[i] have relevant information)\n\
    \   Case 2:\n   Country A and Country B are running services that address the\
    \ same\n   service type (e.g., whitepages), but are not using an identical\n \
    \  collection of protocols, allowed queries, or schema.  The index\n   object\
    \ that Country B sent to Country A's DAG service must be\n   constructed in terms\
    \ of Country A's service, in order for appropriate\n   hits to be generated against\
    \ the index object (i.e. for referrals to\n   Country B's service).  However,\
    \ to resolve the referral, it will be\n   necessary to do some further protocol/schema/query\
    \ mapping.  This can\n   be done by a special SAP established within Country A's\
    \ service, that\n   maps Country A's service into the published service of Country\
    \ B.\n   Country A may then elect to support only one of Country B's access\n\
    \   protocols, and the designated SAP will always contact one type of CAP\n  \
    \ at Country B.\n   Alternatively, Country B can establish a particular CAP that\
    \ does the\n   mapping from Country A's service into something that is most\n\
    \   appropriate against the internal structure of its service.  In this\n   case,\
    \ Country A's referral will be to a special CAP in Country B's\n   service (which,\
    \ again, will look like a WDSP to the Country A\n   service); in fact, the referral\
    \ may be handled directly by the client\n   software.  The difference between\
    \ the two possible approaches lies in\n   the responsibility of managing the relationship\
    \ between the 2 service\n   types.  On the one hand, Country A could handle it\
    \ if it knows its\n   service as well as the published access to Country B. On\
    \ the other,\n   Country B could be responsible for establishing a CAP for every\n\
    \   country that may want to connect to it.  The latter can, in some\n   cases,\
    \ be justified by the amount of internal optimization that can\n   be done, and\
    \ because it reduces the overhead for Country A's service\n   (can pass the referral\
    \ directly back to the client software).\n   Consider the following illustration\

    \ objects, but to copy them to\n   Country A's server.  Then, Country A's CAPs\
    \ might be given access to\n   the SAPs of Country B in order to carry out chaining\
    \ directly at the\n   remote service (instead of implicating Country A's SAPs\
    \ and Country\n   B's CAPs, as in the first example above).  The answer does not\
    \ come\n   from technology -- it depends entirely on the nature of the\n   relationship\
    \ that can be established between Country A and Country\n   B's services.\n"

  - "1.1.2  Scenario 2:  Working Up\n   The above scenario implicitly assumes that\
    \ Country A's server had\n   received index objects from Country B's server. \
    \ This will be the\n   case if Country A's server is higher in the levels of a\
    \ hierarchy of\n   services (established by agreements between the service operators),\n\
    \   or if the network is comprised of servers that share their index\n   objects\
    \ with all others, for example.  In the latter case, searching\n   at any one\
    \ of the servers in the service yields the full range of\n   results -- referrals\
    \ will be made to any other server that might have\n   data that fulfills the\
    \ user's query.  The sharing of the index\n   objects is a mechanism to allow\
    \ each server to manage local data,\n   while enabling distributed load-sharing\
    \ on the basic query handling.\n   However, if a hierarchical, or at least not-completely-connected\n\
    \   model is used for the server network, queries carried out at a level\n   other\
    \ than the top of the hierarchy, or in one particular branch of\n   the hierarchy,\
    \ will not actually be matched against all index\n   objects.  Therefore, there\
    \ may be other servers to which the query\n   should be directed if the full space\
    \ needs to be searched. Suppose,\n   for example, that in the above example Country\
    \ B is in fact lower in\n   the hierarchy than Country A.  A user sending a query\
    \ to Country B's\n   service may be content to limit the scope of the query to\
    \ that\n   country's information (this is true in enough real-life situations\n\
    \   that this hierarchical relationship becomes an effective mechanism\n   for\
    \ scoping queries and avoiding having to flood the entire network\n   with every\
    \ single query or keep full copies of all data in every\n   server).\n   Still\
    \ in theoretical stages, the DAG/IP provides control constructs\n   to allow DAG\
    \ components to act according to the topology of the mesh.\n   A CAP might use\
    \ the \"polled-by\" system command to establish what\n   other servers in the\
    \ mesh exist in higher levels (and therefore would\n   be worth contacting if\
    \ the scope of the search is to be increased).\n   In the example above, a CAP\
    \ in Country B's system could determine\n   that Country A's service was polling\
    \ Country B, and therefore make it\n   a logical target for expanding the scope\
    \ of the query.  More\n   experience (primarily with server mesh topologies) is\
    \ necessary\n   before it will be clear how to best make use of these capabilities:\n\
    \       .  should the CAP always broaden the scope? only if there are no\n   \
    \       local referrals? under user direction?\n       .  should the CAP use a\
    \ local SAP to contact the remote service's\n          CAP?\n       .  is it better\
    \ to completely connect the mesh of servers, or\n          produce some kind of\
    \ hierarchy?\n       .  etc\n"
