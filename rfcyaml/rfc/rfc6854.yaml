  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Message Format, as far back as RFC 822 [RFC0822],
    has\n   always required a usable address to appear in the \"From:\" header\n   field
    of messages in order to allow replies to be sent.  To this end,\n   the syntax
    of messages, up to and including the current specification\n   [RFC5322], has
    required the use of the mailbox address form in the\n   originator (\"From:\"
    and \"Sender:\") fields of messages and has\n   specifically forbidden the use
    of the group address form, which\n   permits an empty list of addresses (that
    is, an address list with no\n   address included that might be used for a reply).\n
    \  However, the use cases for the \"From:\" field have evolved.  There are\n   numerous
    instances of automated systems that wish to send email but\n   cannot handle replies,
    and a \"From:\" field with no usable addresses\n   would be extremely useful for
    that purpose.  More recently, work with\n   internationalized email addresses
    [RFC6530] creates a real need to\n   take a message with an internationalized
    email address and hand it to\n   an older client that would have no ability to
    reply to such an\n   address but might still wish to display the contents of the
    message.\n   The group construct provides an existing syntax for unusable\n   addresses
    (using the empty list of addresses) and also allows for a\n   text label that
    describes the originator.  For example:\n      From: Automated System:;\n   A
    review of many current email programs finds that all reviewed\n   clients will
    properly display a message with group syntax in the\n   \"From:\" field.  At worst,
    such programs generate an error message\n   when an attempt is made to reply to
    such a message.  No other\n   interoperability problems have been discovered.\n
    \  This document therefore updates the Internet Message Format\n   specification
    [RFC5322] to relax that restriction, allowing group\n   syntax to be used in the
    originator (\"From:\" and \"Sender:\") fields,\n   as well as in their corresponding
    resent (\"Resent-From:\" and\n   \"Resent-Sender:\") fields.  This change permits
    empty groups, as\n   described above, and also permits named groups of mailboxes
    (groups\n   with non-empty lists of addresses; see Section 4).  Nevertheless,\n
    \  this document recommends against the general use of group syntax in\n   these
    fields at this time (see Section 3).\n"

  - "2.  Allowing Group Syntax in \"From:\" and \"Sender:\"\n   Section 3.6.2 of RFC
    5322 defines the \"From:\" header field as\n   containing a <mailbox-list> syntax
    element.  This specification\n   changes that definition to use the <address-list>
    syntax element, as\n   is used in other fields, such as \"To:\", \"CC:\", and
    \"Reply-To:\".  This\n   specification also changes the definition of the \"Sender:\"
    header\n   field from the <mailbox> syntax element to the <address> syntax\n   element.
    \ While the <address> element includes the <mailbox> element\n   already, we have
    chosen to specify both in the updated syntax as a\n   way of highlighting the
    limited use intended for the change (see\n   Section 3).\n   Section 2.1 below
    is a full replacement for Section 3.6.2 of RFC\n   5322, containing the new syntax
    as well as a new description of the\n   semantics for the \"From:\" and \"Sender:\"
    fields.  Section 2.2 below is\n   a replacement of only the ABNF syntax for the
    \"Resent-From:\" and\n   \"Resent-Sender:\" fields in Section 3.6.6 of RFC 5322;
    the rest of the\n   syntax as well as the descriptive text of Section 3.6.6 of
    RFC 5322\n   remains unchanged.\n   [The text in the following section is not
    consistent within itself\n   nor with the rest of this document in how it refers
    to message header\n   fields, sometimes putting the field name in quotation marks
    and\n   sometimes not, sometimes capitalizing the field name and sometimes\n   not,
    and sometimes including the final colon and sometimes not.\n   Because minimizing
    changes to the original text is more important, in\n   this case, than attaining
    consistency, the text in Section 2.1, as\n   well as that in Sections 1.1.1 and
    1.1.2 above, is left as it was in\n   RFC 5322.]\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Replacement of RFC 5322, Section 3.6.2. Originator Fields\n   The originator
      fields of a message consist of the from field, the\n   sender field (when applicable),
      and optionally the reply-to field.\n   The from field consists of the field
      name \"From\" and a\n   comma-separated list of one or more addresses (either
      mailbox or\n   group syntax).  If the from field contains more than one mailbox\n
      \  specification (including all mailboxes included in any groups), then\n   the
      sender field, containing the field name \"Sender\" and a single\n   address,
      MUST appear in the message.  The from field and the sender\n   field SHOULD
      NOT use group syntax; rather, the from field SHOULD use\n   only the mailbox-list
      syntax and the sender field SHOULD use only\n   mailbox syntax (see RFC 6854,
      Section 3).  If the sender field uses\n   group syntax, the group MUST NOT contain
      more than one mailbox.  In\n   either case, an optional reply-to field MAY also
      be included, which\n   contains the field name \"Reply-To\" and a comma-separated
      list of one\n   or more addresses.\n   from = \"From:\" (mailbox-list / address-list)
      CRLF\n   sender = \"Sender:\" (mailbox / address) CRLF\n   reply-to = \"Reply-To:\"
      address-list CRLF\n   The originator fields indicate the mailbox(es) of the
      source of the\n   message.  The \"From:\" field specifies the author(s) of the
      message,\n   that is, the mailbox(es) of the person(s) or system(s) responsible\n
      \  for the writing of the message.  The \"Sender:\" field specifies the\n   mailbox
      of the agent responsible for the actual transmission of the\n   message.  For
      example, if a secretary were to send a message for\n   another person, the mailbox
      of the secretary would appear in the\n   \"Sender:\" field and the mailbox of
      the actual author would appear in\n   the \"From:\" field.  If the originator
      of the message can be indicated\n   by a single mailbox and the author and transmitter
      are identical, the\n   \"Sender:\" field SHOULD NOT be used.  Otherwise, both
      fields SHOULD\n   appear.\n      Note: The transmitter information is always
      present.  The absence\n      of the \"Sender:\" field is sometimes mistakenly
      taken to mean that\n      the agent responsible for transmission of the message
      has not been\n      specified.  This absence merely means that the transmitter
      is\n      identical to the author and is therefore not redundantly placed\n
      \     into the \"Sender:\" field.\n   The originator fields also provide the
      information required when\n   replying to a message.  When the \"Reply-To:\"
      field is present, it\n   indicates the address(es) to which the author of the
      message suggests\n   that replies be sent.  In the absence of the \"Reply-To:\"
      field,\n   replies SHOULD by default be sent to the mailbox(es) specified in
      the\n   \"From:\" field unless otherwise specified by the person composing the\n
      \  reply.\n   In all cases, the \"From:\" field SHOULD NOT contain any mailbox
      that\n   does not belong to the author(s) of the message.  See also Section\n
      \  3.6.3 of RFC 5322 [RFC5322] for more information on forming the\n   destination
      addresses for a reply.\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   Mailbox syntax is the normal syntax to use in
    the \"From:\" and\n   \"Sender:\" header fields; the address syntax defined in
    Section 2.1,\n   which allows the specification of a group, is only for Limited
    Use\n   (see RFC 2026 [RFC2026], Section 3.3, item (d)) for the reasons\n   described
    below.\n   Many Internet email procedures and much software assumes that the\n
    \  addresses in the \"From:\" and \"Sender:\" fields can be replied to and\n   are
    suitable for use in organizing and filtering mail.  The use of\n   groups instead
    of mailboxes can disrupt these uses.  Consequently,\n   while this specification
    legitimizes the use of groups, it does so\n   only to enable circumstances when
    that use is necessary.  Because the\n   use of this mechanism is new, it is important
    that its use be limited\n   to these circumstances and that it be used with caution.
    \ In\n   particular, user agents SHOULD NOT permit the use of groups in those\n
    \  fields in outgoing messages.\n"
  title: 3.  Applicability Statement
- contents:
  - "4.  Examples\n   First, consider an email message that is sent by an automated
    nightly\n   monitor program, to which replies should not be sent.  Such messages\n
    \  commonly include a valid, replyable address that will discard any\n   replies
    that are sent to it, but recipients who do reply might be\n   unaware that their
    replies will be discarded.  If the message is\n   instead presented as follows,
    the recipients' email clients will not\n   allow them to reply in the first place:\n
    \     From: Nightly Monitor Robot:;\n   Second, consider an email message that
    is meant to be \"from\" the two\n   managing partners of a business, Ben and Carol,
    and that is sent by\n   their assistant, Dave.  This message could always have
    been presented\n   this way:\n      From: ben@example.com,carol@example.com\n
    \     Sender: dave@example.com\n   This change allows it to be represented this
    way:\n      From: Managing Partners:ben@example.com,carol@example.com;\n      Sender:
    dave@example.com\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   See the Internet Message Format specification
    [RFC5322] for general\n   discussion of security considerations related to the
    formatting of\n   email messages.\n   The \"From:\" address is special, in that
    most user agents display this\n   address, or the \"friendly\" text associated
    with it, to the end user,\n   and label it so as to identify it as the origin
    of the message (as\n   implied in Section 3.6.2 of RFC 5322).  Group syntax in
    the \"From:\"\n   header field can be used to hide the identity of the message\n
    \  originator.  It is just as easy to use a fabricated \"From:\" address\n   to
    accomplish the same thing, so allowing groups in this field does\n   not exacerbate
    the security problem.\n   Some protocols attempt to validate the originator address
    by matching\n   the \"From:\" address to a particular verified domain (for one
    such\n   protocol, see the Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP) document\n   [RFC5617]).
    \ Such protocols will not be applicable to messages that\n   lack an actual email
    address (whether real or fake) in the \"From:\"\n   field.  Local policy will
    determine how such messages are handled,\n   and senders, therefore, need to be
    aware that using groups in the\n   \"From:\" might adversely affect deliverability
    of the message.\n   Because groups have previously not been allowed in the \"From:\"
    and\n   \"Sender:\" header fields, it is possible that some implementations\n
    \  that conform to RFC 5322 might not be prepared to handle the group\n   syntax,
    and, indeed, might not even recognize that group syntax is\n   being used.  Of
    those implementations, some subset might, when\n   presented with group syntax
    in those header fields, behave in a way\n   that is exploitable by an attacker.
    \ It is deemed unlikely that this\n   will be a serious problem in practice: address
    field parsing is\n   generally an integral component of implementations, and address
    field\n   parsers are required to understand group syntax.  In addition, if any\n
    \  implementations should be exploitable through this mechanism, it is\n   already
    possible for attackers to do it by violating RFC 5322.  Other\n   violations of
    RFC 5322 are commonly used by malefactors.\n"
