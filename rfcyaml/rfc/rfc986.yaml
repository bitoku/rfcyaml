  - "Status of This Memo\n   This RFC suggests a method to allow the existing IP addressing,\n\
    \   including the IP protocol field, to be used for the ISO\n   Connectionless\
    \ Network Protocol (CLNP).  This is a draft solution to\n   one of the problems\
    \ inherent in the use of \"ISO-grams\" in the DOD\n   Internet.  Related issues\
    \ will be discussed in subsequent RFCs.  This\n   RFC suggests a proposed protocol\
    \ for the ARPA-Internet community, and\n   requests discussion and suggestions\
    \ for improvements.  Distribution\n   of this memo is unlimited.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The CLNP is documented in [1], but for matters of completeness\
    \ the\n   following illustration of the CLNP header is included here as\n   Figure\
    \ 1.\n   The addressing part of the header is the subject of this RFC, i.e.,\n\
    \   the source and the destination address, respectively.  These\n   addresses\
    \ are generally discussed in [2] and [3], with this document\n   presenting a\
    \ specific method for addressing in the DOD Internetwork\n   environment, consistent\
    \ with the international standardized NSAP\n   addresses.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Addresses for Use in the Internet\n   This section describes the primary\
    \ addresses used to address NSAPs in\n   the Internet.  A later section will describe\
    \ a separate address\n   format for end systems and individual simple LANs that\
    \ are attached\n   to the Internet only through intervening Public Data Networks.\n\
    \   The appropriate Authority and Format Identifier (AFI) is one octet in\n  \
    \ length.\n      \"The AFI consists of an integer with a value between 0 and 99\
    \ with\n      an abstract syntax of two decimal digits\" [3], that is, the AFI\n\
    \      codes are binary coded decimal (BCD).\n   It specifies an ISO-6523-ICD\
    \ assignment, and also that the Domain\n   Specific Part (DSP) of the address\
    \ is based on binary.  The AFI octet\n   uses the value \"47\".  The ISO-6523-ICD\
    \ format is used to emphasize\n   that this is an administrative assignment. \
    \ The usage of an ISO DCC\n   (Data Country Code) would be possible, but could\
    \ be misleading due to\n   the fairly far spread geographical extent of the Internet-IP.\n\
    \   As required by the ISO addressing standard, the next two octets of\n   the\
    \ address, in this case, specify the Initial Domain Identifier.\n   This two octet\
    \ value is the International Code Designator (ICD)\n   assigned to the DOD Internet,\
    \ \"0006\".\n   The remainder of the NSAP address is the Domain Specific Part\
    \ (DSP).\n   This is assigned by the Internet administration, which is considered\n\
    \   to be an addressing domain.  The remainder of the address specifies a\n  \
    \ one byte version number, the four byte Internet Protocol address and\n   a one\
    \ byte IP user protocol field. The version number allows for\n   future extensions.\
    \  The IP address used is the same as the current\n   four octet IP address. \
    \ The user protocol field is the same as the\n   user protocol field in the current\
    \ IP header.  This is necessary\n   because the ISO protocol considers identification\
    \ of the user\n   protocol to be an addressing issue, and therefore does not allow\
    \ for\n   the user protocol to be specified in the protocol header\n   independently\
    \ from the address.\n"
