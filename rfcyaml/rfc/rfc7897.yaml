  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering\
    \ Label\n   Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n\
    \   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been\n   identified\
    \ as a key requirement.  In this context, a domain is a\n   collection of network\
    \ elements within a common sphere of address\n   management or path computational\
    \ responsibility such as an Interior\n   Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous\
    \ System (AS).  This\n   document specifies a representation and encoding of a\
    \ domain\n   sequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains\n  \
    \ traversed to reach the destination domain to be used by Path\n   Computation\
    \ Elements (PCEs) to compute inter-domain constrained\n   shortest paths across\
    \ a predetermined sequence of domains.  This\n   document also defines new subobjects\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used to compute\
    \ end-to-end\n   paths across multi-domain environments using a per-domain path\n\
    \   computation technique [RFC5152].  The Backward-Recursive PCE-Based\n   Computation\
    \ (BRPC) mechanism [RFC5441] also defines a PCE-based path\n   computation procedure\
    \ to compute an inter-domain constrained path for\n   (G)MPLS TE LSPs.  However,\
    \ both per-domain and BRPC techniques assume\n   that the sequence of domains\
    \ to be crossed from source to destination\n   is known and is either fixed by\
    \ the network operator or obtained by\n   other means.  Also, for inter-domain\
    \ point-to-multipoint (P2MP) tree\n   computation, it is assumed per [RFC7334]\
    \ that the domain tree is\n   known a priori.\n   The list of domains (domain\
    \ sequence) in point-to-point (P2P) or a\n   domain tree in P2MP is usually a\
    \ constraint in inter-domain path\n   computation procedure.\n   The domain sequence\
    \ (the set of domains traversed to reach the\n   destination domain) is either\
    \ administratively predetermined or\n   discovered by some means like Hierarchical\
    \ PCE (H-PCE).\n   [RFC5440] defines the Include Route Object (IRO) and the Explicit\n\
    \   Route Object (ERO).  [RFC5521] defines the Exclude Route Object (XRO)\n  \
    \ and the Explicit Exclusion Route subobject (EXRS).  The use of an\n   Autonomous\
    \ System (albeit with a 2-byte AS number) as an abstract\n   node representing\
    \ a domain is defined in [RFC3209].  In the current\n   document, we specify new\
    \ subobjects to include or exclude domains\n   including an IGP area or an AS\
    \ (4 bytes as per [RFC6793]).\n   Further, the domain identifier may simply act\
    \ as a delimiter to\n   specify where the domain boundary starts and ends in some\
    \ cases.\n   This is a companion document to Resource Reservation Protocol -\n\
    \   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions for the domain identifiers\n   [RFC7898].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope\n   The procedures described in this document are experimental. \
    \ The\n   experiment is intended to enable research for the usage of the domain\n\
    \   sequence at the PCEs for inter-domain paths.  For this purpose, this\n   document\
    \ specifies new domain subobjects as well as how they\n   incorporate with existing\
    \ subobjects to represent a domain sequence.\n   The experiment will end two years\
    \ after the RFC is published.  At\n   that point, the RFC authors will attempt\
    \ to determine how widely this\n   has been implemented and deployed.\n   This\
    \ document does not change the procedures for handling existing\n   subobjects\
    \ in the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP).\n   The new subobjects introduced\
    \ by this document will not be understood\n   by legacy implementations.  If a\
    \ legacy implementation receives one\n   of the subobjects that it does not understand\
    \ in a PCEP object, the\n   legacy implementation will behave according to the\
    \ rules for a\n   malformed object as per [RFC5440].  Therefore, it is assumed\
    \ that\n   this experiment will be conducted only when both the PCE and the Path\n\
    \   Computation Client (PCC) form part of the experiment.  It is possible\n  \
    \ that a PCC or PCE can operate with peers, some of which form part of\n   the\
    \ experiment and some that do not.  In this case, since no\n   capabilities exchange\
    \ is used to identify which nodes can use these\n   extensions, manual configuration\
    \ should be used to determine which\n   peerings form part of the experiment.\n\
    \   When the results of implementation and deployment are available, this\n  \
    \ document will be updated and refined, and then it could be moved from\n   Experimental\
    \ to Standards Track.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Domains
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Domains\n   [RFC4726] and [RFC4655] define a domain as a separate administrative\n\
    \   or geographic environment within the network.  A domain could be\n   further\
    \ defined as a zone of routing or computational ability.  Under\n   these definitions,\
    \ a domain might be categorized as an AS or an IGP\n   area.  Each AS can be made\
    \ of several IGP areas.  In order to encode\n   a domain sequence, it is required\
    \ to uniquely identify a domain in\n   the domain sequence.  A domain can be uniquely\
    \ identified by an\n   area-id, AS number, or both.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Domain Sequence
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Domain Sequence\n   A domain sequence is an ordered sequence of domains\
    \ traversed to\n   reach the destination domain.\n   A domain sequence can be\
    \ applied as a constraint and carried in a\n   path computation request to a PCE(s).\
    \  A domain sequence can also be\n   the result of a path computation.  For example,\
    \ in the case of H-PCE\n   [RFC6805], a parent PCE could send the domain sequence\
    \ as a result in\n   a path computation reply.\n   In a P2P path, the domains\
    \ listed appear in the order that they are\n   crossed.  In a P2MP path, the domain\
    \ tree is represented as a list of\n   domain sequences.\n   A domain sequence\
    \ enables a PCE to select the next domain and the PCE\n   serving that domain\
    \ to forward the path computation request based on\n   the domain information.\n\
    \   A domain sequence can include boundary nodes (ABR or ASBR) or border\n   links\
    \ (inter-AS links) to be traversed as an additional constraint.\n   Thus, a domain\
    \ sequence can be made up of one or more of the\n   following:\n   o  AS Number\n\
    \   o  Area ID\n   o  Boundary Node ID\n   o  Inter-AS Link Address\n   These\
    \ are encoded in the new subobjects defined in this document as\n   well as in\
    \ the existing subobjects that represent a domain sequence.\n   Consequently,\
    \ a domain sequence can be used by:\n   1.  a PCE in order to discover or select\
    \ the next PCE in a\n       collaborative path computation, such as in BRPC [RFC5441];\n\
    \   2.  the parent PCE to return the domain sequence when unknown; this\n    \
    \   can then be an input to the BRPC procedure [RFC6805];\n   3.  a PCC or a PCE\
    \ to constrain the domains used in inter-domain path\n       computation, explicitly\
    \ specifying which domains to be expanded\n       or excluded; and\n   4.  a PCE\
    \ in the per-domain path computation model [RFC5152] to\n       identify the next\
    \ domain.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Domain Sequence Representation
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Domain Sequence Representation\n   A domain sequence appears in PCEP messages,\

    \ used to\n      specify a set of network elements to be traversed to reach the\n\
    \      destination, which includes subobjects used to specify the domain\n   \
    \   sequence.\n   o  Exclude Route Object (XRO): As per [RFC5521], XRO can be\
    \ used to\n      specify certain abstract nodes, to be excluded from the whole\n\
    \      path, which include subobjects used to specify the domain\n      sequence.\n\
    \   o  Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS): As per [RFC5521], EXRS\n   \
    \   can be used to specify exclusion of certain abstract nodes\n      (including\
    \ domains) between a specific pair of nodes.  EXRS is a\n      subobject inside\
    \ the IRO.\n   o  Explicit Route Object (ERO): As per [RFC5440], ERO can be used\
    \ to\n      specify a computed path in the network.  For example, in the case\n\

    \  If the PCE encounters an IP address that is globally routable,\n         then\
    \ it updates the current AS to the AS that owns this IP\n         address.  This\
    \ document does not define how the PCE learns\n         which AS owns the IP address.\n\
    \      *  If the PCE encounters an IP address that is not globally\n         routable,\
    \ then it assumes that it belongs to the current AS.\n      *  If the PCE encounters\
    \ an unnumbered link, then it assumes that\n         it belongs to the current\
    \ AS.\n   o  When a PCE parses an IRO, it interprets each subobject according\n\
    \      to the Area ID associated with the preceding subobject.  We call\n    \
    \  this the \"current area\".  Certain subobjects modify the current\n      area,\
    \ as follows.\n      *  The current area is initialized to the Area ID of the\
    \ PCC.\n      *  If the current AS is changed, the current area is reset and\n\
    \         needs to be determined again by a current or subsequent\n         subobject.\n\
    \      *  If the PCE encounters an area subobject, then it updates the\n     \
    \    current area to this new Area ID.\n      *  If the PCE encounters an IP address\
    \ that belongs to a different\n         area, then it updates the current area\
    \ to the area that has\n         this IP address.  This document does not define\
    \ how the PCE\n         learns which area has the IP address.\n      *  If the\

    \      *  Otherwise, it assumes that the subobject belongs to the current\n  \
    \       area.\n   o  In case the current PCE is not responsible for the path\n\

    \ do not substantially\n   change the nature of PCEP.  Therefore, the security\
    \ considerations\n   set out in [RFC5440] apply unchanged.  Note that further\
    \ security\n   considerations for the use of PCEP over TCP are presented in\n\
    \   [RFC6952].\n   This document specifies a representation of the domain sequence\
    \ and\n   new subobjects, which could be used in inter-domain PCE scenarios as\n\
    \   explained in [RFC5152], [RFC5441], [RFC6805], [RFC7334], etc.  The\n   security\
    \ considerations set out in each of these mechanisms remain\n   unchanged by the\
    \ new subobjects and domain sequence representation in\n   this document.\n  \
    \ But the new subobjects do allow finer and more specific control of\n   the path\
    \ computed by a cooperating PCE(s).  Such control increases\n   the risk if a\
    \ PCEP message is intercepted, modified, or spoofed\n   because it allows the\
    \ attacker to exert control over the path that\n   the PCE will compute or to\
    \ make the path computation impossible.\n   Consequently, it is important that\
    \ implementations conform to the\n   relevant security requirements of [RFC5440].\
    \  These mechanisms\n   include:\n   o  Securing the PCEP session messages using\
    \ TCP security techniques\n      (Section 10.2 of [RFC5440]).  PCEP implementations\
    \ SHOULD also\n      consider the additional security provided by the TCP\n  \
    \    Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] or Transport Layer\n      Security\
    \ (TLS) [PCEPS].\n   o  Authenticating the PCEP messages to ensure the messages\
    \ are intact\n      and sent from an authorized node (Section 10.3 of [RFC5440]).\n\
    \   o  PCEP operates over TCP, so it is also important to secure the PCE\n   \
    \   and PCC against TCP denial-of-service attacks.  Section 10.7.1 of\n      [RFC5440]\
    \ outlines a number of mechanisms for minimizing the risk\n      of TCP-based\
    \ denial-of-service attacks against PCEs and PCCs.\n   o  In inter-AS scenarios,\
    \ attacks may be particularly significant\n      with commercial- as well as service-level\
    \ implications.\n   Note, however, that the domain sequence mechanisms also provide\
    \ the\n   operator with the ability to route around vulnerable parts of the\n\
    \   network and may be used to increase overall network security.\n"
