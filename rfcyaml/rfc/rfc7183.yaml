  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification updates [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] by defining\n
    \  mandatory-to-implement security mechanisms (for integrity and replay\n   protection).
    \ A deployment of these protocols may choose to employ an\n   alternative(s) to
    these mechanisms; in particular, it may choose to\n   protect packets rather than
    messages, it may choose to use an\n   alternative Integrity Check Value (ICV)
    with preferred properties,\n   and/or it may use an alternative timestamp.  A
    deployment may choose\n   to use no such security mechanisms, but this is not
    recommended.\n   The mechanisms specified are the use of an ICV for protection
    of the\n   protocols' control messages and the use of timestamps in those\n   messages
    to prevent replay attacks.  Both use the TLV mechanism\n   specified in [RFC5444]
    to add this information to the messages.\n   These ICV and TIMESTAMP TLVs are
    defined in [RFC7182].  Different ICV\n   TLVs are used for HELLO messages in NHDP
    and TC (Topology Control)\n   messages in OLSRv2, the former also protecting the
    source address of\n   the IP datagram that contains the HELLO message.  This is
    because the\n   IP datagram source address is used by NHDP to determine the address\n
    \  of a neighbor interface, and it is not necessarily otherwise\n   contained
    in the HELLO message, while OLSRv2's TC message is\n   forwarded in a new packet;
    thus, it has no single IP datagram source\n   address.\n   The mechanism specified
    in this document is placed in the packet/\n   message processing flow as indicated
    in Figure 1.  It exists between\n   the packet parsing/generation function of
    [RFC5444] and the message\n   processing/generation function of NHDP and OLSRv2.\n

  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] enable specifications
    of extensions to\n   recognize additional reasons for rejecting a message as \"badly
    formed\n   and therefore invalid for processing\", and mention security\n   (integrity
    protection) as an explicit example.  This document\n   specifies a mechanism that
    provides this functionality.\n   Implementations of [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] MUST
    include this\n   mechanism, and deployments of [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] SHOULD
    use this\n   mechanism, except when a different security mechanism is more\n   appropriate.\n
    \  The applicability of this mechanism is determined by its\n   characteristics,
    which are that it:\n   o  Specifies a security mechanism that is required to be
    included in\n      conforming implementations of [RFC6130] and [RFC7181].\n   o
    \ Specifies an association of ICVs with protocol messages, and\n      specifies

    \"badly formed and therefore invalid for\n      processing\".\n   o  Specifies

  title: 3.  Applicability Statement
- contents:
  - "4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning\n   The mechanism specified in this document
    provides the following\n   functionalities for use with messages specified by
    [RFC6130] and\n   [RFC7181]:\n   o  Generation of ICV Message TLVs (as defined
    in [RFC7182]) for\n      inclusion in an outgoing message.  An implementation
    of [RFC6130]\n      and [RFC7181] MAY use more than one ICV TLV in a message,
    even\n      with the same type extension, but these ICV TLVs MUST each use\n      different
    keys or they MUST use a different algorithm to calculate\n      the ICV, e.g.,
    with different hash and/or cryptographic functions\n      when using type extension
    1 or 2.  An implementation of [RFC6130]\n      and [RFC7181] MUST at least be
    able to generate an ICV TLV using\n      HMAC-SHA-256 and one or more secret keys
    shared by all routers.\n   o  Generation of TIMESTAMP Message TLVs (as defined
    in [RFC7182]) for\n      inclusion in an outgoing message.  An implementation
    of [RFC6130]\n      and [RFC7181] MAY use more than one ICV TLV in a message,
    but it\n      MUST NOT use the same type extension.  An implementation of\n      [RFC6130]
    and [RFC7181] that is able to synchronize the clocks in\n      all routers in
    the network with sufficient precision MUST at least\n      be able to generate
    a TIMESTAMP TLV using POSIX time.\n   o  Verification of ICV Message TLVs contained
    in a message, in order\n      to determine if this message MUST be rejected as
    \"badly formed and\n      therefore invalid for processing\" [RFC6130] [RFC7181].
    \ An\n      implementation of [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] MUST at least be able to\n
    \     verify an ICV TLV using HMAC/SHA-256 and one or more secret keys\n      shared
    by all routers.\n   o  Verification of TIMESTAMP Message TLVs (as defined in [RFC7182])\n
    \     contained in a message, in order to determine if this message MUST\n      be
    rejected as \"badly formed and therefore invalid for processing\"\n      [RFC6130]
    [RFC7181].  An implementation of [RFC6130] and [RFC7181]\n      that is able to
    synchronize the clocks in all routers in the\n      network with sufficient precision
    MUST at least be able to verify\n      a TIMESTAMP TLV using POSIX time.\n   ICV
    Packet TLVs (as defined in [RFC7182]) MAY be used by a deployment\n   of the multiplexing
    process defined in [RFC5444], either as well as\n   or instead of the protection
    of the NHDP and OLSRv2 messages.  (Note\n   that in the case of NHDP, the packet
    protection is equally good, and\n   also protects the packet header.  In the case
    of OLSRv2, the packet\n   protection has different properties than the message
    protection,\n   especially for some forms of ICV.  When packets contain more than
    one\n   message, the packet protection has lower overheads in space and\n   computation
    time.)\n   When a router generates a message on a MANET interface, this\n   mechanism:\n
    \  o  Specifies how to calculate an ICV for the message.\n   o  Specifies how
    to include that ICV using an ICV Message TLV.\n   [RFC6130] and [RFC7181] allow
    for the rejection of incoming messages\n   prior to processing by NHDP or OLSRv2.
    \ This mechanism, when used,\n   specifies that a message MUST be rejected if
    the ICV Message TLV is\n   absent, or its value cannot be verified.  Note that
    this means that\n   routers whose implementation of NHDP and/or OLSRv2 does not
    include\n   this specification will be ignored by routers using this mechanism,\n
    \  and these two sets of routers will, by design, form disjoint MANETs.\n   (The
    unsecured MANET will retain some information about the secured\n   MANET, but
    be unable to use it, not having any recognized symmetric\n   links with the secured
    MANET.)\n"
  title: 4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning
- contents:
  - "5.  Parameters\n   The following router parameters are specified for use by the
    two\n   protocols; the first is required only by NHDP, but may be visible to\n
    \  OLSRv2, the second is required only by OLSRv2:\n   o  MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF
    - The maximum age that a HELLO message to\n      be validated may have.  If the
    current POSIX time of the router\n      validating the HELLO message, minus the
    timestamp indicated in the\n      TIMESTAMP TLV of the HELLO message, is greater
    than\n      MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF, the HELLO message MUST be silently\n      discarded.\n
    \  o  MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF - The maximum age that a TC message to be\n      validated
    may have.  If the current POSIX time of the router\n      validating the TC message,
    minus the timestamp indicated in the\n      TIMESTAMP TLV of the TC message, is
    greater than\n      MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF, the TC message MUST be silently discarded.\n
    \  The following constraints apply to these parameters:\n   o  MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF
    > 0\n   o  MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF > 0\n   However, these bounds are insufficient:
    MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF and\n   MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF MUST be least as great
    as the maximum expected\n   \"age\" of a message (i.e., the time difference between
    a message has\n   been sent by a router and received by all intended destinations).\n
    \  For HELLO messages, this needs only cover a single hop, but TC\n   messages
    may have been forwarded a number of times.  In particular,\n   for TC messages,
    if using jitter as specified in [RFC7181] and\n   [RFC5148], the largest contribution
    the age may be a delay of up to\n   F_MAXJITTER per hop (except the final hop)
    that the message has\n   traveled.  Other factors in the delay of both message
    types, per hop,\n   may include the link-layer that is used in the MANET, and
    CPU and\n   memory resources of routers (e.g., queuing delays, and delays for\n
    \  processing ICVs).  An implementation MAY set lower and/or upper\n   bounds
    on these parameters, if so, then these MUST allow values\n   meeting these requirements.
    \ An implementation MAY make its value of\n   MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF dependent
    on the number of hops that a TC\n   message has traveled.\n   The above constraints
    assume ideal time synchronization of the clock\n   in all routers in the network.
    \ The parameters\n   MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF and MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF (and any\n
    \  constraints on them) MAY be increased to allow for expected timing\n   differences
    between routers (between neighboring routers for\n   MAX_HELLO_TIMESTAMP_DIFF,
    allowing for greater separation, but\n   usually not per hop, for MAX_TC_TIMESTAMP_DIFF).\n
    \  Note that excessively large values of these parameters defeats their\n   objectives,
    so these parameters SHOULD be as large as is required,\n   but not significantly
    larger.\n   Using POSIX time allows a resolution of no more than one second.  In\n
    \  many MANET use cases, time synchronization much below one second is\n   not
    possible because of unreliable and high-delay channels, mobility,\n   interrupted
    communication, and possible resource limitations.\n   In addition, when using
    the default message intervals and validity\n   times as specified in [RFC6130]
    and [RFC7181], where the shortest\n   periodic message interval is 2 seconds,
    repeating the message within\n   a second is actually beneficial rather than harmful
    (at a small\n   bandwidth cost).  Also, the use of [RFC5148] jitter can cause
    a\n   message to take that long or longer to traverse the MANET, thus even\n   in
    a perfectly synchronized network, the TC maximum delay would\n   usually be greater
    than 1 second.\n   A finer granularity than 1 second, and thus the use of an alternative\n
    \  timestamp, is however RECOMMENDED in cases where, possibly due to\n   fast
    moving routers, message validity times are below 1 second.\n"
