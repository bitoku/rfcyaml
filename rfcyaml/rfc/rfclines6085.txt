Abstract When transmitting an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address, the IPv6 destination address is mapped to an Ethernet link  layer multicast address.
This document clarifies that a mapping of an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address may in some circumstances map to an Ethernet link layer unicast address.
Introduction "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks" ([RFC2464], Section 7) specifies how an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address is mapped into an Ethernet link layer address.
This document extends this mapping to explicitly allow for a mapping of an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address into an Ethernet link  layer unicast address, when it is clear that only one address is relevant.
This mapping does not replace the mapping described in [RFC2464], Section 7.
The determination of the unicast Ethernet link layer address and the construction of the outgoing IPv6 packet are out of scope for this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
An IPv6 node receiving an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address and an Ethernet link layer unicast address MUST NOT drop the packet as a result of the use of this form of address mapping.
This document does not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.
