Moving RFC 4693 to Historic Status RFC 4693
[RFC4693] established the IETF Operational Notes (IONs) series of documents on the experimental basis
This series was intended to discuss the set of procedures that the IETF follows, but for which the RFC publication process is an inappropriate documentation vehicle.
Per RFC 3933 [RFC3933], in March 2008, the IESG decided to terminate the IONs process experiment [IESG IONS].
This document moves RFC 4693 to Historic status, per [HISTORIC], to reflect experiment closure.
Please contact the IESG at <iesg@ietf.org
> for further details, including motivation for the termination and further destiny of IONs.
This document is of administrative nature only; therefore, there are no security issues related to it.
