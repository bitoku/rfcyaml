    \ The Definition of a Socket\nA socket is defined to be the unique identification\
    \ to or from which\ninformation is transmitted in the network. The socket is specified\
    \ as a 32\nbit number with even sockets identifying receiving sockets and odd\
    \ sockets\nidentifying sending sockets. A socket is also identified by the host\
    \ in\nwhich the sending or receiving processer is located.\nPrevious network papers\
    \ postulated that a process running under control of\nthe host's operating system\
    \ would have access to a number of ports. A port\nmight be a physical input or\
    \ output device, or a logical I/O device\nsupported by system calls to the host's\
    \ operating system.  The latter\ncategory includes a) I/O directed to a physical\
    \ device which is being\nspooled by the operating system, b) a physical device\
    \ whose basic\ncharacteristics have not been altered but whose access has been\
    \ limited and\npossibly transformed by a mapping algorithm (e.g. device address\
    \ mapping or\ncylinder relocation as in virtual mini disks), c) access to a file\
    \ system\nthrough a directory and access method maintained by the operating system,\n\
    d) a procedure for process to process communications, e) a procedure for\nmachine\
    \ to machine communication (such as defined by the network protocol.)\nA socket\
    \ has been defined to be the identification of a port for machine to\nmachine\
    \ communication through the ARPA network. Sockets allocated to each\nhost must\
    \ be uniquely associated with a known process or be undefined. The\nname of some\
    \ sockets must be universally known and associated with a known\nprocess operating\
    \ with a specified protocol. (e.g., a logger socket, RJE\nsocket, a file transfer\
    \ socket). The name of other sockets might not be\nuniversally known, but given\
    \ in a transmission over a universally known\nsocket, (c. g. the socket pair specified\
    \ by the transmission over the\nlogger socket under the Initial Connection Protocol\
    \ (ICP). In any case,\ncommunication over the network is from one socket to another\
    \ socket, each\nsocket being identified with a process running at a known host.\n\
    The question arises as to whether socket names must be known to users of\nnetwork\
    \ programs or whether the specification of sockets can be made\ntransparent to\
    \ the user. Also, should the socket used at one time by a\nprocess be the same\
    \ socket used at a later time by the same process for the\nsame purpose? If sockets\
    \ are not transparent to the user, then the sockets\nused must not be dependent\
    \ on the order in which network connections are\nmade.\nThe definition of a socket\
    \ is also related to the accounting procedures\nfollowed for network usage.  Network\
    \ Control Programs (NCPs) should log\neach connection made and record the time\
    \ the connection was made, the time\nthe connection was closed, the number of\
    \ messages and number of bits\ntransmitted over the connection, the sending and\
    \ receiving hosts, and the\nsockets at the sending host and receiving host which\
    \ participated in the\nconnection. In order for these sockets to be meaningful,\
    \ they should be\nidentifiable with the user, account, or process name with which\
    \ each socket\nis associated.\nIt has previously been suggested that the sockets\
    \ used by a network user be\nidentified with that user no matter which host he\
    \ used for network\ncommunications. Users would be registered at some host and\
    \ be identified as\na user from that host even if he used the system as a second\
    \ host to\ncommunicate with the system at a third host.\nTo satisfy the above\
    \ requirements within the name space of a 32 bit socket,\nthe following procedure\
    \ is suggested. This procedure has been implemented\nwith the NCP on the Lincoln\
    \ Laboratory 360/67 system and is used by all\nprocesses making use of network\
    \ facilities. ) A 32 bit socket is divided\ninto an 8 bit \"home\" field, a 16\
    \ bit \"user\" field and an 8 bit \"tag\" field.\nThe tag consists of a 7 bit\
    \ \"plug\" and a one bit \"polarity\" where a \"0\"\npolarity indicates a receive\
    \ socket and a \"1\" polarity indicates a send\nsocket. Thus a user on one host\
    \ system may run processes with up to 128\nsend sockets and 128 receive sockets.\
    \  This procedure allows for 256 hosts\nand 65,536 users per host.  The only difficulty\
    \ is in mapping user or\nprocess identifiers at a host into a 16 bit user number.\
    \ This may be done\nthrough a table lookup, possibly using a hash coding technique.\
    \  Though\nmany systems have a unique run time index associated with each process,\
    \ if\nthis index were used as the user number, the user number would not be the\n\
    same each time the process were used for network activity.  What is\nrequired,\
    \ is a unique mapping from a process identifier (usually a\ncharacter string)\
    \ into a 16 bit binary number.\nThe sockets used for facilities following a common\
    \ network protocol, such\nas the ICP, should also follow this socket definition.\
    \ Thus the logger\nsocket at the Lincoln Laboratory 360/67 would be, and is, x'0A0000\
    \ 01, ',\ni.e. home 10, user 0, and tag 1.\nThis procedure for defining sockets\
    \ enables an accounting procedure for\nidentifying users of network facilities\
    \ and for measuring network usage.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable\
