Endnotes [1] I.e., any TELNET commands appearing before the Data Mark are to be interpreted; the Data Mark is to be used to terminate the scan initiated by the INS; characters that are not TELNET commands may be discarded or passed to the user process as the implementer sees fit.
[2] We support Hathaway's proposal to fully parenthesize sub  negotiations.
Further, we believe that the "closing parenthesis" should be a new command rather than a second SB command; this will aid the receiver in recovering from errors, either in parsing at the receiver or in generation at the transmitter.
We disagree with his proposal that sub negotiations be discarded when encountered during processing of a TELNET SYNCH.
For FTP such a data mark character has not yet been defined and, in fact, may not be necessary under the constraint that the FTP command interpreter should look for exactly one command after being interrupted; this is consistent with the general command reply orientation of FTP.
