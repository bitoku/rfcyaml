Abstract This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) protocols.
The following well known numbers are required: a UDP port number, an IP protocol number, and a link local multicast group address.
This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by one or more protocols that conform to [RFC5444].
The following well known numbers are required: a UDP port number, an IP protocol number, and a link local multicast group address.
All interoperable protocols running on these well known IANA allocations MUST conform to [RFC5444].
[RFC5444] provides a common format that enables one or more protocols to share the IANA allocations defined in this document unambiguously.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
UDP Port Number MANET routers require a well known UDP port number [IANA] to send and receive MANET routing protocol packets.
The title of this UDP port is "manet".
The value of this UDP port is 269.
IP Protocol Number MANET routers require a well known IP protocol number [IANA] to send and receive MANET routing protocol packets.
The title of this IP protocol number is "manet".
The value of this IP protocol number is 138.
Link Local Multicast Group for MANET Routers MANET routers require a well known, link local multicast address [RFC4291] to send and receive MANET routing protocol packets.
The name of the multicast address to reach link local
(LL) MANET routers is "LL MANET Routers".
For IPv4, a well known, link local scope multicast address is required.
The address for LL MANET Routers is 224.0.0.109.
For IPv6, a well known, link local scope multicast address is required.
The address for LL MANET Routers is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:6D. 6.
This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by one or more protocols that conform to [RFC5444].
Specifically, the following well known numbers have been assigned: a UDP port (Section 3), an IP protocol number (Section 4), and a link local multicast group address (Section 5).
Action 1: IANA has made the following assignments in the "PORT NUMBERS" registry: sub registry "WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS"
Action 2: IANA has made
the following assignments in the "PROTOCOL NUMBERS" registry: sub registry "
IANA has made the following assignments in the "Internet Multicast Addresses" registry: sub registry "224.0.0.0
IANA has made the following assignments in the "INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION 6 MULTICAST ADDRESSES" registry:
sub registry "Fixed Scope Multicast Addresses" sub sub registry "Link Local Scope"
This document specifies only well known numbers for protocols that conform to [RFC5444], and it not does not specify the protocols that carry the information across the network.
Each protocol using these well known numbers may have its own set of security issues, but those issues are not affected by using the IANA allocations specified herein.
The security issues associated with possibly operating multiple cooperating protocols using the same IANA assignments (e.g., UDP port) MUST be addressed in each protocol's specification.
