- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 2482, \"Language Tagging in Unicode Plain Text\", describes\
    \ a\n   mechanism for using special Unicode language tag characters to\n   identify\
    \ languages when needed without more general markup such as\n   that provided\
    \ by XML.  The Unicode Consortium has deprecated that\n   facility and strongly\
    \ recommends against its use.  RFC 2482 has been\n   moved to Historic status\
    \ to reduce the possibility that Internet\n   implementers would consider that\
    \ system an appropriate mechanism for\n   identifying languages.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 2482, \"Language Tagging in Unicode Plain Text\" [RFC2482],\n\
    \   describes a mechanism for using special Unicode language tag\n   characters\
    \ to identify languages when needed.  It is an idea whose\n   time never quite\
    \ came.  It has been superseded by whole-transaction\n   language identification\
    \ such as the MIME Content-language header\n   [RFC3282] and more general markup\
    \ mechanisms such as those provided\n   by XML.  The Unicode Consortium has deprecated\
    \ the language tag\n   character facility and strongly recommends against its\
    \ use.  RFC 2482\n   has been moved to Historic status to reduce the possibility\
    \ that\n   Internet implementers would consider that tagging system an\n   appropriate\
    \ mechanism for identifying languages.\n   A discussion of the status of the language\
    \ tag characters and their\n   applicability appears in Section 16.9 of The Unicode\
    \ Standard\n   [Unicode52].\n"
- title: 2.  Action
  contents:
  - "2.  Action\n   RFC 2482 has been deprecated and reclassified as Historic.  Internet\n\
    \   protocols and Standards-Track documents should not use the facilities\n  \
    \ described in that document.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   By deprecating RFC 2482, we eliminate a facility\
    \ that is no longer\n   encouraged or supported by the Unicode Consortium and\
    \ that may have\n   been slightly risky in use if misinterpreted or if expectations\
    \ of\n   support were not met.  So, if this action has any effect on Internet\n\
    \   security at all, it should be positive.\n"
