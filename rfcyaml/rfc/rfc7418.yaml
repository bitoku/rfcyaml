- title: 2.  The IRTF Is Not the IETF
  contents:
  - "2.  The IRTF Is Not the IETF\n   A number of proposals from experienced IETF\
    \ participants for new IRTF\n   RGs have encountered problems because the IETF\
    \ participants were\n   making proposals appropriate for the IETF, but not for\
    \ the IRTF.\n   [RFC2014] describes the origin of IRTF RGs but doesn't provide\
    \ much\n   detail about the process, which is intended to be flexible and\n  \
    \ accommodate new types of RGs.  Lacking that detail, experienced IETF\n   participants\
    \ fall back on what they know, assume that chartering an\n   IRTF RG will be similar\
    \ to chartering an IETF working group (WG),\n   follow the suggestions in [RFC6771]\
    \ to gather a group of interested\n   parties, and then follow the suggestions\
    \ in [RFC5434] to prepare for\n   a successful BOF and eventually, a chartered\
    \ WG.\n   Both of these documents are excellent references for proposals in the\n\
    \   IETF, but their suggestions may result in a proposal that is almost\n   the\
    \ opposite of what the IRTF Chair is looking for in a proposal for\n   an IRTF\
    \ RG.  The mismatches fall into some consistent categories, and\n   this document\
    \ lists the ones that come up repeatedly.\n   The target audience of this document\
    \ is IETF participants bringing\n   proposals to the IRTF.\n   It's worth noting\
    \ that the IRTF Chair has substantial autonomy on\n   what RGs are chartered and\
    \ how they reach that stage.  The IRTF Chair\n   at the time of writing is Lars\
    \ Eggert.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Research and Engineering
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Research and Engineering\n      \"To me, the fundamental outcome of research\
    \ is understanding, and\n      the fundamental outcome of engineering is a product.\"\
    \ - Fred Baker\n   In some ways, research is about a journey, and engineering\
    \ is about a\n   destination.  If a researcher answers a question in a way that\
    \ opens\n   another question, that can be success.  If an engineer keeps working\n\
    \   on a product without finishing it, that is usually a failure.\n   Research\
    \ can be open-ended, while engineering can come to a stopping\n   point when the\
    \ result is \"good enough\" -- good enough to ship.\n      \"If it has to work\
    \ when you're finished, it wasn't research, it\n      was engineering.\" - attributed\
    \ to Dave Clark\n"
- title: 2.2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Scope\n   IRTF RGs have a scope large enough to interest researchers, attract\n\
    \   them to the IRTF, and keep them busy doing significant work.  Their\n   charters\
    \ are therefore usually much broader than IETF WG charters,\n   and RGs often\
    \ discuss different topics underneath the charter\n   umbrella at different times,\
    \ based on current research interests in\n   the field.\n   IETF WGs are chartered\
    \ with a limited scope and specific\n   deliverables.  If deliverables and milestones\
    \ are known, the proposal\n   is likely too limited for the IRTF.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Time Frames
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Time Frames\n   IRTF RGs bring researchers together to work on significant\
    \ problems.\n   That takes time.  The effort required by a RG is likely to take\
    \ at\n   least three to five years, significantly longer than IETF WGs\n   envision\
    \ when they are chartered.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Alternatives
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Alternatives\n   IRTF RGs are encouraged to explore more than one alternative\
    \ approach\n   to the chartered problem area.  There is no expectation that the\
    \ RG\n   will \"come to consensus\" on one approach.  The RG may publish\n   multiple\
    \ competing proposals as research produces results.\n   IETF WGs normally use\
    \ the IETF consensus process (as described in\n   [RFC7282]) to drive interoperable\
    \ solutions into the market place.\n   That often includes reducing the number\
    \ of approaches to something\n   manageable for an implementer, preferably one,\
    \ whether that means\n   starting with an approach the WG participants agree on,\
    \ or\n   considering alternatives with a view to picking one rather than\n   spending\
    \ significant effort on alternatives that won't go forward.\n   The IRTF, as an\
    \ organization, may also charter multiple RGs with\n   somewhat overlapping areas\
    \ of interest, which the IETF tries very\n   hard to avoid.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Process
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Process\n   All IRTF participants have the obligation to disclose IPR and\n\
    \   otherwise follow the IRTF's IPR policies, which closely mirror the\n   IETF's\
    \ IPR policies; in all other aspects, IRTF RG operation is much\n   less constrained\
    \ than IETF WG operation.\n   Each IRTF RG is permitted (and encouraged) to agree\
    \ on a way of\n   working together that best supports the specific needs of the\
    \ group.\n   This freedom allows IRTF RGs to bypass fundamental IETF ways of\n\
    \   working, such as the need to reach at least rough consensus, which\n   IRTF\
    \ RGs need not do.  Therefore, the mode of operation of IRTF RGs\n   can also\
    \ change over time, for example, perhaps becoming more like\n   IETF WG operation\
    \ as the research the group has been progressing\n   matures.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Charters
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Charters\n   The purpose of charters in the IRTF is to broadly sketch the\
    \ field of\n   research that a group is interested in pursuing and to serve as\
    \ an\n   advertisement to other researchers who may be wondering if the group\n\
    \   is the right place to participate.\n   IETF WG charters tend to be very narrow.\
    \  They are intended to\n   constrain the work that the working group will be\
    \ doing, and they may\n   contain considerable text about what the working group\
    \ will not be\n   working on.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Deliverables
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Deliverables\n   There is no expectation that IRTF RGs publish RFCs, although\
    \ many do.\n   Some IRTF research groups produce IRTF-stream RFCs, while others\n\
    \   produce Internet-Drafts that form the basis of IETF-stream RFCs, and\n   still\
    \ others may deliver reports, white papers, academic journal\n   articles, or\
    \ even carry out relevant high-level discussions that\n   aren't ever published\
    \ but influence other research.  IRTF RGs are\n   successful when they stimulate\
    \ discussion, produce relevant outputs,\n   and impact the research community.\n\
    \   IETF WG deliverables tend to be specific protocol, deployment, and\n   operational\
    \ specifications, along with problem statements, use cases,\n   requirements,\
    \ and architectures that inform those specifications.\n   Almost all IETF working\
    \ groups are chartered to deliver Internet\n   standards, which isn't an option\
    \ for IRTF RGs.\n"
- title: 2.8.  Completion
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Completion\n   IRTF RGs may produce the outputs they expected to produce\
    \ when they\n   were chartered, but it also happens that researchers consider\
    \ what\n   they've learned and start work on better solutions.  This can happen\n\
    \   whether or not the research underway has been completed, and the\n   process\
    \ can continue until the RG itself decides that it is time to\n   conclude or\
    \ when the IRTF Chair determines that there is no more\n   energy in the group\
    \ to do research.\n   IETF WGs will typically conclude when they meet their chartered\n\
    \   milestones, allowing participants to focus on implementation and\n   deployment,\
    \ although the WG mailing list may remain open for a time.\n"
- title: 3.  Now That You Know What Not to Do
  contents:
  - "3.  Now That You Know What Not to Do\n   The current IRTF Chair, Lars Eggert,\
    \ is fond of saying, \"Just act\n   like an IRTF research group for a year, and\
    \ we'll see if you are\n   one.\"\n   There are many ways to \"act like an IRTF\
    \ research group\".  [RFC4440]\n   contains a number of points to consider when\
    \ proposing a new RG.\n   Some possibilities include:\n   1.  Identify and recruit\
    \ a critical mass of researchers who can\n       review and build off each other's\
    \ work.\n   2.  Identify other venues that may overlap the proposed RG, and\n\
    \       understand what value the proposed RG provides beyond what's\n       already\
    \ underway elsewhere.\n   3.  Hold a workshop to survey work that might set the\
    \ stage for a RG\n       on questions of interest, perhaps in concert with existing\n\
    \       academic events.\n   4.  If the proposed RG expects to have outputs that\
    \ will ultimately\n       be standardized in the IETF, identify and recruit engineers\
    \ who\n       can review and provide feedback on intermediate results.\n   But\
    \ every proposed RG is different, so e-mailing the IRTF Chair to\n   start the\
    \ conversation is a perfectly reasonable strategy.\n"
