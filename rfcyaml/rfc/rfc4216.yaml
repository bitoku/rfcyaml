  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) mechanism documented in\
    \ [TE-RSVP]\n   may be deployed by Service Providers (SPs) to achieve some of\
    \ the\n   most important objectives of network traffic engineering as described\n\
    \   in [TE-OVW].  These objectives are summarized as:\n   - Supporting end-to-end\
    \ services requiring Quality of Service (QoS)\n     guarantees\n   - Performing\
    \ network resource optimization\n   - Providing fast recovery\n   However, this\
    \ traffic engineering mechanism can only be used within\n   an Autonomous System\
    \ (AS).\n   This document discusses requirements for an inter-AS MPLS Traffic\n\
    \   Engineering mechanism that may be used to achieve the same set of\n   objectives\
    \ across AS boundaries within or beyond an SP's\n   administrative domains.\n\
    \   The document will also present a set of application scenarios where\n   the\
    \ inter-AS traffic engineering mechanism may be required.  This\n   mechanism\
    \ could be implemented based upon the requirements presented\n   in this document.\n\
    \   These application scenarios will also facilitate discussions for a\n   detailed\
    \ requirements list for this inter-AS Traffic Engineering\n   mechanism.\n   Please\
    \ note that there are other means of traffic engineering\n   including Interior\
    \ Gateway Protocol (IGP); metrics-based (for use\n   within an AS); and Border\
    \ Gateway Protocol (BGP) attribute-based (for\n   use across ASes, as described\
    \ in Appendix A), which provide coarser\n   control of traffic paths.  However,\
    \ this document addresses\n   requirements for a MPLS-based, fine-grained approach\
    \ for inter-AS TE.\n   This document doesn't make any claims with respect to whether\
    \ it is\n   possible to have a practical solution that meets all the requirements\n\
    \   listed in this document.\n"

    \ areas: 1) Inter-AS bandwidth guarantees; 2) Inter-AS\n   Resource Optimization\
    \ and 3) Fast Recovery across ASes, i.e.,\n   Recovery of Inter-AS Links/SRLG\
    \ and ASBR Nodes.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Inter-AS Bandwidth Guarantees
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Inter-AS Bandwidth Guarantees\n   The Diffserv IETF working group has\
    \ defined a set of mechanisms\n   described in [DIFF_ARCH], [DIFF_AF], and [DIFF_EF]\
    \ or [MPLS-Diff].\n   These mechanisms can be activated at the edge of or over\
    \ a Diffserv\n   domain to contribute to the enforcement of a QoS policy (or a\
    \ set of\n   QoS policies), which can be expressed in terms of maximum one-way\n\
    \   transit delay, inter-packet delay variation, loss rate, etc.\n   Many SPs\
    \ have partial or full deployment of Diffserv implementations\n   in their networks\
    \ today, either across the entire network or\n   minimally on the edge of the\
    \ network across CE-PE links.\n   In situations where strict QoS bounds are required,\
    \ admission control\n   inside the backbone of a network is in some cases required\
    \ in\n   addition to current Diffserv mechanisms.\n   When the propagation delay\
    \ can be bounded, the performance targets,\n   such as maximum one-way transit\
    \ delay, may be guaranteed by providing\n   bandwidth guarantees along the Diffserv-enabled\
    \ path.\n   One typical example of this requirement is to provide bandwidth\n\
    \   guarantees over an end-to-end path for VoIP traffic classified as EF\n   (Expedited\
    \ Forwarding [DIFF_EF]) class in a Diffserv-enabled network.\n   When the EF path\
    \ is extended across multiple ASes, inter-AS bandwidth\n   guarantee is then required.\n\
    \   Another case for inter-AS bandwidth guarantee is the requirement for\n   guaranteeing\
    \ a certain amount of transit bandwidth across one or\n   multiple ASes.\n   Several\
    \ application scenarios are presented to further illustrate\n   this requirement\
    \ in section 4 below.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Inter-AS Resource Optimization
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Inter-AS Resource Optimization\n   In Service Provider (SP) networks,\
    \ the BGP protocol [BGP] is deployed\n   to exchange routing information between\
    \ ASes.  The inter-AS\n   capabilities of BGP may also be employed for traffic\
    \ engineering\n   purposes across the AS boundaries.  Appendix A provides a brief\n\
    \   description of the current BGP-based inter-AS traffic engineering\n   practices.\n\
    \   SPs have managed to survive with this coarse set of BGP-based traffic\n  \
    \ engineering facilities across inter-AS links in a largely best-effort\n   environment.\
    \  Certainly, in many cases, ample bandwidth within an\n   SP's network and across\
    \ inter-AS links reduces the need for more\n   elaborate inter-AS TE policies.\n\
    \   However, in the case where a SP network is deployed over multiple\n   ASes\
    \ (for example, as the number of inter-AS links grows), the\n   complexity of\
    \ the inter-AS policies and the difficulty in inter-AS TE\n   path optimization\
    \ increase to a level such that it may soon become\n   unmanageable.\n   Another\
    \ example is where inter-AS links are established between\n   different SP administrative\
    \ domains.  Nondeterministic factors such\n   as uncoordinated routing and network\
    \ changes, as well as sub-optimum\n   traffic conditions, would potentially lead\
    \ to a complex set of\n   inter-AS traffic engineering policies where current\
    \ traffic\n   engineering mechanisms would probably not scale well.\n   In these\
    \ situations where resource optimization is required and/or\n   specific routing\
    \ requirements arise, the BGP-based inter-AS\n   facilities will need to be complemented\
    \ by a more granular inter-AS\n   traffic engineering mechanism.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Fast Recovery across ASes\n   When extending services such as VoIP across\
    \ ASes, customers often\n   require SPs to maintain the same level of performance\
    \ targets, such\n   as packet loss and service availability, as achieved within\
    \ an AS.\n   As a consequence, fast convergence in a stable fashion upon\n   link/SRLG/node\
    \ failures becomes a strong requirement.  This is\n   clearly difficult to achieve\
    \ with current inter-domain techniques,\n   especially in cases of link/SRLG failures\

    \ applicable case of deploying MPLS TE in an SP's\n   network, an inter-AS TE\

    \ be deployed across inter-AS links\n   where resource optimization, bandwidth\

    \ networks is considered\n   here because of already available implementations\
    \ and operational\n   experiences.\n   Please note that the inter-AS traffic engineering\

  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Scenario IV - TE across multi-AS within a Single SP\n        Administrative\
    \ Domain\n   As mentioned in [TE-APP], SPs have generally admitted that the\n\
    \   current MPLS TE mechanism provides a great deal of tactical and\n   strategic\
    \ value in areas of traffic path optimization [TE-RSVP] and\n   rapid local repair\
    \ capabilities [TE-FRR] via a set of on-line or\n   off-line constraint-based\
    \ path computation algorithms.\n   From a service provider's perspective, another\
    \ way of stating the\n   objectives of traffic engineering is to utilize available\
    \ capacity in\n   the network for delivering customer traffic without violating\n\
    \   performance targets, and/or to provide better QoS services via an\n   improved\
    \ network utilization, more likely operating below congestion\n   thresholds.\n\
    \   It is worth noting that situations where resource provisioning is not\n  \
    \ an issue (e.g., low density in inter-AS connectivity or ample inter-\n   AS\
    \ capacity), it may not require more scalable and granular TE\n   facilities beyond\
    \ BGP routing policies.  This is because such\n   policies can be rather simple\
    \ and because inter-AS resource\n   optimization is not an absolute requirement.\n\
    \   However many SPs, especially those with networks across multiple\n   continents,\
    \ as well as those with sparsely connected networks, have\n   designed their multi-AS\
    \ routing policies along or within the\n   continental or sub-continental boundaries\
    \ where the number of ASes\n   can range from a very few to dozens.  Generally,\
    \ inter-continent or\n   sub-continent capacity is very expensive.  Some Service\
    \ Providers\n   have multiple ASes in the same country and would like to optimize\n\
    \   resources over their inter-region links.  This would demand a more\n   scalable\
    \ degree of resource optimization, which warrants the\n   consideration of extending\
    \ current intra-AS MPLS TE capabilities\n   across inter-AS links.\n   In addition,\
    \ one may only realize higher efficiency in conducting\n   traffic optimization\
    \ and path protection/restoration planning when\n   coordinating all network resources\
    \ as a whole, rather than partially.\n   For a network which may consist of many\
    \ ASes, this could be realized\n   via the establishment of inter-AS TE LSPs,\

  - "Appendix A.  Brief Description of BGP-based Inter-AS Traffic\n             Engineering\n\
    \   In today's Service Provider (SP) network, BGP is deployed to meet two\n  \
    \ different sets of requirements:\n      - Establishing a scalable exterior routing\
    \ plane separate from the\n        data forwarding plane within SP's administrative\
    \ domain\n      - Exchanging network reachability information with different BGP\n\
    \        autonomous systems (ASes) that could belong to a different SP or\n  \
    \      simply, a different AS within a SP network\n   Over connections across\
    \ the AS boundaries, traffic engineering may\n   also be accomplished via a set\
    \ of BGP capabilities by appropriately\n   enforcing BGP-based inter-AS routing\
    \ policies.  The current BGP-based\n   inter-AS traffic engineering practices\
    \ may be summarized as follows:\n      - \"Closest exit\" routing where egress\
    \ traffic from one SP to\n        another follows the path defined by the lowest\
    \ IGP or intra-AS\n        MPLS TE tunnel metrics of the BGP next-HOP of exterior\
    \ routes\n        learned from other ASes over the inter-AS links\n      - \"\
    BGP path attribute\"-based routing selection mechanism where the\n        egress\
    \ traffic path is determined by interconnect (peering or\n        transit) policies\
    \ based upon one or a combination of BGP path\n        attributes, like AS_PATH,\
    \ MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED), and Local_Pref.\n   SPs have often faced a number of\
    \ nondeterministic factors in the\n   practices of inter-AS traffic engineering\
    \ employing the methods\n   mentioned above:\n      - Sub-optimum traffic distribution\
    \ across inter-AS links\n      - Nondeterministic traffic condition changes due\
    \ to uncoordinated\n        IGP routing policies or topology changes within other\
    \ AS and\n        uncoordinated BGP routing policy changes (MED or as-prepend,\n\
    \        etc.)\n   In addition, to achieve some degrees of granularity, SPs may\
    \ choose\n   to enforce BGP inter-AS policies.  These policies are specific to\
    \ one\n   inter-AS link or to a set of inter-AS links for ingress traffic.  By\n\
    \   tagging certain sets of routes with a specific attribute when\n   announcing\
    \ to another AS, the ingress traffic is destined to certain\n   PoPs or to regions\
    \ within SP's network from another AS.  Of course,\n   this operates on the assumption\
    \ that the other AS permits automated\n   egress policy by matching the predefined\
    \ attribute from incoming\n   routes.\n"
