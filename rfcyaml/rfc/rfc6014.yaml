  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2535] specifies that the IANA registry for DNS Security
    Algorithm\n   Numbers be updated by IETF Standards Action only, with the exception\n
    \  of two values -- 253 and 254.  In essence, this means that for an\n   algorithm
    to get its own entry in the registry, the algorithm must be\n   defined in an
    RFC on the Standards Track as defined in [RFC2026].\n   The requirement from RFC
    2535 is repeated in [RFC3755] and the\n   combination of [RFC4033], [RFC4034],
    and [RFC4035].\n   RFC 2535 allows algorithms that are not on the Standards Track
    to use\n   private values 253 and 254 in signatures.  In each case, an\n   unregistered
    private name must be included with each use of the\n   algorithm in order to differentiate
    different algorithms that use the\n   value.\n"

  - "2.  Requirements for Assignments in the DNS Security Algorithm Numbers\n    Registry\n
    \  This document changes the requirement for registration from requiring\n   a
    Standards Track RFC to requiring a published RFC of any type.\n   There are two
    reasons for relaxing the requirement:\n   o  There are some algorithms that are
    useful that may not be able to\n      be in a Standards Track RFC.  For any number
    of reasons, an\n      algorithm might not have been evaluated thoroughly enough
    to be\n      able to be put on the Standards Track.  Another example is that\n
    \     the algorithm might have unclear intellectual property rights that\n      prevents
    the algorithm from being put on the Standards Track.\n   o  Although the size
    of the registry is restricted (about 250\n      entries), new algorithms are proposed
    infrequently.  It could\n      easily be many decades before there is any reason
    to consider\n      restricting the registry again.\n   Some developers will care
    about the standards level of the RFCs that\n   are in the registry.  The registry
    has been updated to reflect the\n   current standards level of each algorithm
    listed.\n   To address concerns about the registry eventually filling up, the\n
    \  IETF should re-evaluate the requirements for entry into this registry\n   when
    approximately 120 of the registry entries have been assigned.\n   That evaluation
    may lead to tighter restrictions or a new mechanism\n   for extending the size
    of the registry.  In order to make this\n   evaluation more likely, IANA has marked
    about half of the currently\n   available entries as \"Reserved\" in order to
    make the timing for that\n   re-evaluation more apparent.\n   The private-use
    values, 253 and 254, are still useful for developers\n   who want to test, in
    private, algorithms for which there is no RFC.\n   This document does not change
    the semantics of those two values.\n"

  - "3.  Expectations for Implementations\n   It is important to note that, according
    to RFC 4034, DNSSEC\n   implementations are not expected to include all of the
    algorithms\n   listed in the IANA registry; in fact, RFC 4034 and the IANA registry\n
    \  list an algorithm that implementations should not include.  This\n   document
    does nothing to change the expectation that there will be\n   items listed in
    the IANA registry that need not be (and in some\n   cases, should not be) included
    in all implementations.\n   There are many reasons why a DNSSEC implementation
    might not include\n   one or more of the algorithms listed, even those on the
    Standards\n   Track.  In order to be compliant with RFC 4034, an implementation\n
    \  only needs to implement the algorithms listed as mandatory to\n   implement
    in that standard, or updates to that standard.  This\n   document does nothing
    to change the list of mandatory-to-implement\n   algorithms in RFC 4034.  This
    document does not change the\n   requirements for when an algorithm becomes mandatory
    to implement.\n   Such requirements should come in a separate, focused document.\n
    \  It should be noted that the order of algorithms in the IANA registry\n   does
    not signify or imply cryptographic strength or preference.\n"

  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document updates allocation requirements for
    unassigned values\n   in the \"Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm
    Numbers\"\n   registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/\n   dns-sec-alg-numbers,
    in the sub-registry titled \"DNS Security\n   Algorithm Numbers\".  The registration
    procedure for values that are\n   assigned after this document is published is
    \"RFC Required\".\n   IANA has marked values 123 through 251 as \"Reserved\".
    \ The registry\n   notes that this reservation is made in RFC 6014 (this RFC)
    so that\n   when most of the unreserved values are taken, future users and IANA\n
    \  will have a pointer to where the reservation originated and its\n   purpose.\n
    \  IANA has added a textual notation to the \"References\" column in the\n   registry
    that gives the current standards status for each RFC that is\n   listed in the
    registry.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   An algorithm described in an RFC that is not
    on the Standards Track\n   may have weaker security than one that is on the Standards
    Track; in\n   fact, that may be the reason that the algorithm was not allowed
    on\n   Standards Track.  Note, however, that not being on the Standards\n   Track
    does not necessarily mean that an algorithm is weaker.\n   Conversely, algorithms
    that are on the Standards Track should not\n   necessarily be considered better
    than algorithms that are not on the\n   Standards Track.  There are other reasons
    (such as intellectual\n   property concerns) that can keep algorithms that are
    widely\n   considered to be strong off the Standards Track.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Experimental and Documentation Values\n   During the early discussion
    of this document, it was proposed that\n   maybe there should be a small number
    of values reserved for\n   \"experimental\" purposes.  This proposal was not included
    in this\n   document because of the long history in the IETF of experimental\n
    \  values that became permanent.  That is, a developer would release\n   (maybe
    \"experimentally\") a version of software that had the\n   experimental value
    associated with a particular extension,\n   competitors would code their systems
    to test interoperability, and\n   then no one wanted to change the values in their
    software to the\n   \"real\" value that was later assigned.\n   There was also
    a proposal that IANA should reserve two values to be\n   used in documentation
    only, similar to the way that \"example.com\" has\n   been reserved as a domain
    name.  That proposal was also not included\n   in this document because all values
    need to be associated with some\n   algorithm, and there is no problem with having
    examples that point to\n   commonly deployed algorithms.\n"
