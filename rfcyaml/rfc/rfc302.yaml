  - "                         EXERCISING THE ARPANET\nQuestions\n---------\n     1.\
    \  Can a technically competent person, initially uninformed\n         as to network\
    \ operation and naive as to the capabilities\n         of various time-shared\
    \ terminal systems attached to the\n         Network, be able to develop problem\
    \ solving competence\n         at server sites on the ARPANET?\n     2.  What\
    \ inherent user problems exist that complicate such\n         adaptation?\n  \
    \   3.  Once proficient in the use, what aspects of the various\n         sites\
    \ limit the usability and what modifications should\n         be considered at\
    \ both server and user sites to meet\n         various needs?\n     4.  Should\
    \ a user select a given site for composing and\n         editing all of his files\
    \ for subsequent transfer to\n         other sites for processing or should he\
    \ learn to compose\n         and edit at each of the sites doing his processing?\n\
    \     5.  What are the problems in starting cooperating processes\n         at\
    \ several sites?  How does a user control such\n         processes?\n     Under\
    \ the direction of UCSB Professor James Howard, a test\ngroup of 14 graduate students\
    \ was formed to pursue the questions\nabove, and any other aspect of ARPANET operation\
    \ that they might\nuncover.\n     The test group has been given access to the\
    \ 16 console On-Line\nSystem classroom in the E.E. Department at UCSB.  The 16\
    \ consoles\nproduce graphic and alphanumeric displays and are tied into the\n\
    UCSB Host 360-75 which gains them access to the network.  Old\nstyle Culler-Fried\
    \ keyboards are being used which provide a\nlimited key set  Jim White has managed\
    \ to program around most of\nthe protocol problems brought about by these keyboards,\
    \ but some\nstill remain.\n     Seminars were given to the test group to familiarize\
    \ them\nwith software and hardware aspects of the ARPANET, the local NIC\nfile\
    \ has been made available to the group, and the group has been\nallowed to sign\
    \ onto the Network to pursue any available system.\n     Following the initial\
    \ period of two weeks, during which the\ngroup developed some familiarity with\
    \ the network, the test group\nhas been divided into working groups with emphasis\
    \ as follows:\n         Patric Timlick      }      BBN-TENEX\n         Dave Stearns\
    \        }      BBN-TENEX B\n         John Pickens        }      SRI-ARC (NIC)\n\
    \         Doug Beaubien       }\n         Dave Whittington    }\n         Richard\
    \ Haraguchi   }      MIT-Multics\n         Maria deGraaf       }      MIT-DMCG\n\
    \         Richard Melton      }\n         Su Sung Won         }\n         Ronald\
    \ Varekamp     }\n         Jeoff Benson        }      UCLA-CCN    HARV-10\n  \
    \       Hasan A. El. Hasan  }      UCLA-NMC    UTAH-10\n         George Engelberg\
    \    }      RAND-CSG    LL-67\n         Rodney Skinner      }\n     The first\
    \ real encounters with the ARPANET at large produced\na series of questions and\
    \ comments.  Test group comments are\nitemized below with additional comments\
    \ by the author {In braces}.\nWe plan subsequent reports on a periodic basis.\n\
    \     1.  We find that we need further information about access\n         to the\
    \ NCPs at various sites.  User manuals from the\n         sites might provide\
    \ this.  {Site response is solicited}\n     2.  We sometimes cannot sign into\
    \ UCLA-NMC directly from\n         UCSB, but can do so readily by way of BBN.\
    \  {Protocol?}\n     3.  After running a Fortran or PL-1 program at some net\n\
    \         location we can only display the results on our consoles\n         but\
    \ cannot store them as files.  {UCSB programming need?}\n     4.  When communications\
    \ break down how can a user be\n         assured that he is logged out of some\
    \ remote site?\n         {Need for automatic Log-out?}\n     5.  How do we make\
    \ contact with programmers at other sites\n         to develop cooperative programs\
    \ for file transfer, etc?\n         {Jim White?}\n     6.  Is there a best time\
    \ of day for operation at each site?\n         Should contact be made with the\
    \ site operator prior to\n         user sessions?   {Server sites please comment}\n\
    \     7.  UCLA-NMC has assigned a separate user identification\n         for test\
    \ group use.  Would other sites prefer to do\n         likewise?  {Comments?}\n\
    \     8.  Is there information regarding uses made of the\n         various time\
    \ shared systems by internal users at each\n         site?  Does a bibliography\
    \ exist to allow contact\n         with such users?  {Check the Resource Notebook}\n\
    \     9.  MIT-DMCG and BBN provide very good user service,\n         especially\
    \ the site survey.  Also these sites have\n         good responses to define events.\
    \  Can UCSB provide\n         local users with similar information?  {Jim White?}\n\
    \       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into\
    \ the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex\
    \ McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n"
