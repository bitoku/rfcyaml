  - "Menlo Park, California 94025\n   The on-line documentation will be maintained\
    \ as (userguides.\n   journal-netsub,).  Hard copies are available from Marcia\
    \ Keeney.\n   The first implementation of a Network Journal Submission and Delivery\n\
    \   system is now experimentally up.  This system allows use of the NIC's\n  \
    \ NLS Journal System without entering NLS.  Network users may submit\n   text\
    \ files written on their host systems using their mail subsystems\n   (e.g. SNDMSG,\
    \ FTP, TELNET).  The mail will then be converted at SRI-\n   ARC into NLS files,\
    \ journalized, and sent to the specified recipients\n   according to their preset\
    \ Journal delivery options.  A newly added\n   option permits the user to receive\
    \ automatic Journal delivery (of\n   citations to journalized documents) at his\
    \ host via the Network mail\n   protocol.\n"
- title: Overview
  contents:
  - "Overview\n   Network mail sent to SRI-ARC (NIC) will be entered into the NIC\n\
    \   Journal system if a slash appears in the user-name.  To get the mail\n   to\
    \ the NIC, you may use either the FTP, TELNET, or mail subsystem\n   provided\
    \ by your local system.\n   The author's NIC Ident(s) are assumed to appear before\
    \ the slash; the\n   recipients' NIC Ident(s) after it.  Idents should be separated\
    \ by\n   spaces.  (See scenarios in branch 3)\n   (e.g. jew / mdk dhc)\n   When\
    \ this format is detected by the NIC, the Network Journal system\n   will be invoked.\
    \  At SRI-ARC the mail will be transformed into an NLS\n   file, assigned a unique\
    \ catalog number, stored permanently under that\n   number, and a notice of it\
    \ will be sent to all the listed recipients.\n   If the slash is not found, the\
    \ mail will be handled in the normal\n   way.\n   Delivery of Journal citations\
    \ may now be obtained via the Network (as\n   well as to an NLS file at SRI-ARC\
    \ and in hard copy).  If you wish to\n   receive your Journal mail at you host\
    \ computer, contact the NIC (see\n   RFC510 -- 16400,).\n   A more detailed description\
    \ follows.\n"
- title: NETWORK JOURNAL SUBMISSION
  contents:
  - "NETWORK JOURNAL SUBMISSION\n   The remote user prepares the text of his Journal\
    \ article in his host\n   using whatever tools he has available to him.  He may\
    \ wish to prepare\n   long articles beforehand using his text editor (e.g. TECO\
    \ if he's a\n   TENEX user).  For short messages, he may be content with the basic\n\
    \   editing features (such as backspace character and line delete)\n   provided\
    \ by his submission subsystem.\n"
- title: Connecting to the NIC
  contents:
  - "Connecting to the NIC\n   To get the mail to the SRI-ARC FTP server, you must\
    \ either:\n      1) via FTP and TELNET mail subsystems, connect to SRI-ARC's FTP\n\
    \         server process, then issue the FTP mail command, or\n      2) use the\
    \ mail subsystem provided by your local system.\n         For TENEX SNDMSG mail:\
    \ put \"@nic\" at the end of the \"User:\"\n         field.\n            (e.g.\
    \ jew / mdk dhc@nic)\n         If you wish to send the mail as a SNDMSG message\
    \ to  some\n         people as well as submit it to the Journal, you may treat\
    \ the\n         Journal form as one name, follow it with a comma, and then list\n\
    \         other names of which SNDMSG is aware, separated by commas.\n       \

- title: Specifying Authors and Recipients
  contents:
  - "Specifying Authors and Recipients\n   The user invokes Network Journal submission\
    \ via his mail subsystem.\n   Network Journal Submission is invoked by a user-name\

    \    dcs rww jcn / sri-arc ;h\n   'Author' is the NIC Ident of (one of) the user(s)\
    \ submitting the\n   article, and 'recipient' the Ident of (one of) its intended\n\
    \   recipient(s).  An Ident, as usual, may designate either a \"group\" or\n \
    \  an \"individual\".  SRI-ARC will verify the idents.  If it finds them\n   correct,\
    \ it will accept the mail.  An invalid Ident will cause the\n   mail to be rejected;\
    \ the user will get an error message and have to\n   start over.  The first author\
    \ Ident will be taken to be the clerk.\n   If the SRI-ARC mail subsystem finds\
    \ the slash in the user-name field,\n   the Network Journal Submission system\
    \ will be invoked; otherwise, the\n   mail will be treated as normal Network mail\
    \ (delivered to the\n   directory specified by the user-name).\n"
- title: Specifying an NLS Conversion Algorithm
  contents:
  - "Specifying an NLS Conversion Algorithm\n   Optionally, the sender may specify\
    \ the algorithm by which his\n   sequential message file is to be converted to\
    \ NLS format.  This\n   choice is made by inserting:\n      ; conversion algorithm\n\
    \   anywhere in the 'user-name' field (e.g. jew/mdk rww;s).  (This should\n  \
    \ be before the \"@nic\" for SNDMSG.)  Legal values for conversion-\n   algorithm\
    \ are:\n      s -- Insert Sequential, each line an NLS statement (default\n  \
    \    conversion-algorithm)\n      a -- Insert Assembler with structure\n     \
    \ m -- Insert Assembler without structure\n      h -- Heuristic Insert Sequential,\
    \ double <CR>s indicating end of\n      statements, assuming no right justification\
    \ in the source file.\n      j -- Heuristic Insert Sequential, double <CR>s indicating\
    \ end of\n      statements, assuming right justification in the source file (for\n\
    \      those who put multiple spaces between words to line up the right\n    \
    \  margin, multiple spaces will be removed)\n         By \"Heuristic Insert Sequential\"\
    , we mean that the Insert\n         Sequential algorithm attempts to be smarter\
    \ about handling\n         statements and levels.  Statements are delimited by\
    \ two\n         successive carriage returns.  Statement level will be\n      \
    \   determined by the amount the statement is indented.  If it is\n         indented\
    \ more than the previous statement, it will be taken to\n         be a substatement\
    \ and put down a level; if it is the same as\n         the previous statement,\
    \ it will be on the same level.  If the\n         statement is indented less than\
    \ the previous statement, the\n         program will look for a past statement\
    \ with the same\n         indentation and put it at that level, The indentation\
    \ of a\n         statement is taken to be that of either the first or second\n\
    \         line of the statement, whichever is less (to ignore paragraph\n    \
    \     indentation, for example).  This is good from 1 to 12 levels.\n        \
    \ Carriage returns at the end of full (within 10 characters of\n         the right\
    \ margin, i.e. 62nd column) lines are replaced by\n         spaces.\n        \
    \ This algorithm is an attempt to answer a very difficult need.\n         It won't\
    \ always do just the right thing, but it should often\n         provide the intended\
    \ result.  The user is encouraged to\n         experiment with it; suggestions\
    \ will be welcomed.\n"
- title: Titling the Message
  contents:
  - "Titling the Message\n      Once the conversion has been performed, an optional\
    \ title,\n      signaled by the label 're:'. 'title:', or 'subject:' is searched\n\
    \      for in the first statement of the message text.  (The label may\n     \
    \ either be all upper or all lower case, or the first character\n      upper and\
    \ the rest lower case.)  If a label is found anywhere in\n      the statement,\
    \ the line of that statement beginning with the first\n      non-blank character\
    \ following the label and going up to the first\n      carriage return (and line\
    \ feed) or else to the end of the\n      statement is taken as the Journal title,\
    \ and the statement\n      containing the title is deleted from the file,  Any\
    \ substructure\n      will be moved up a level.\n   The submission is equivalent\
    \ to the NLS 'Submit Message' command if\n   th NLS file (after the title statement\
    \ (if any) has been deleted) has\n   only one statement in it besides the origin\
    \ statement; in such a\n   case, the message in its entirety will be delivered\
    \ as part of the\n   Journal citation.  Otherwise the Network submission is equivalent\
    \ to\n   'Submit File'; only a reference to the Journal document will be\n   delivered\
    \ to each of the recipients.\n"
