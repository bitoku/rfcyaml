  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is addressed to network operators who are\
    \ considering\n   whether to deploy or operate a distributed service using anycast.\
    \  It\n   describes the best current practice for doing so, but does not\n   recommend\
    \ whether any particular service should or should not be\n   deployed using anycast.\n\
    \   To distribute a service using anycast, the service is first\n   associated\
    \ with a stable set of IP addresses, and reachability to\n   those addresses is\
    \ advertised in a routing system from multiple,\n   independent service nodes.\
    \  Various techniques for anycast deployment\n   of services are discussed in\
    \ [RFC1546], [ISC-TN-2003-1], and\n   [ISC-TN-2004-1].\n   The techniques and\
    \ considerations described in this document apply to\n   services reachable over\
    \ both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   Anycast has in recent years become increasingly popular\
    \ for adding\n   redundancy to DNS servers to complement the redundancy that the\
    \ DNS\n   architecture itself already provides.  Several root DNS server\n   operators\
    \ have distributed their servers widely around the Internet,\n   and both resolver\
    \ and authority servers are commonly distributed\n   within the networks of service\
    \ providers.  Anycast distribution has\n   been used by commercial DNS authority\
    \ server operators for several\n   years.  The use of anycast is not limited to\
    \ the DNS, although the\n   use of anycast imposes some additional limitations\
    \ on the nature of\n   the service being distributed, including transaction longevity,\n\
    \   transaction state held on servers, and data synchronisation\n   capabilities.\n\
    \   Although anycast is conceptually simple, its implementation\n   introduces\
    \ some pitfalls for operation of services.  For example,\n   monitoring the availability\
    \ of the service becomes more difficult;\n   the observed availability changes\
    \ according to the location of the\n   client within the network, and the population\
    \ of clients using\n   individual anycast nodes is neither static, nor reliably\n\
    \   deterministic.\n   This document will describe the use of anycast for both\
    \ local scope\n   distribution of services using an Interior Gateway Protocol\
    \ (IGP) and\n   global distribution using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)\n\
    \   [RFC4271].  Many of the issues for monitoring and data\n   synchronisation\
    \ are common to both, but deployment issues differ\n   substantially.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   Service Address:  an IP address associated with a particular\
    \ service\n      (e.g., the destination address used by DNS resolvers to reach\
    \ a\n      particular authority server).\n   Anycast:  the practice of making\
    \ a particular Service Address\n      available in multiple, discrete, autonomous\

    \ of hosts connected in some more elaborate\n      fashion; in either case, to\

- title: 3.1.  General Description
  contents:
  - "3.1.  General Description\n   Anycast is the name given to the practice of making\
    \ a Service Address\n   available to a routing system at Anycast Nodes in two\
    \ or more\n   discrete locations.  The service provided by each node is generally\n\
    \   consistent regardless of the particular node chosen by the routing\n   system\
    \ to handle a particular request (although some services may\n   benefit from\
    \ deliberate differences in the behaviours of individual\n   nodes, in order to\
    \ facilitate locality-specific behaviour; see\n   Section 4.6).\n   For services\
    \ distributed using anycast, there is no inherent\n   requirement for referrals\
    \ to other servers or name-based service\n   distribution (\"round-robin DNS\"\
    ), although those techniques could be\n   combined with anycast service distribution\
    \ if an application required\n   it.  The routing system decides which node is\
    \ used for each request,\n   based on the topological design of the routing system\
    \ and the point\n   in the network at which the request originates.\n   The Anycast\
    \ Node chosen to service a particular query can be\n   influenced by the traffic\
    \ engineering capabilities of the routing\n   protocols that make up the routing\
    \ system.  The degree of influence\n   available to the operator of the node depends\
    \ on the scale of the\n   routing system within which the Service Address is anycast.\n\
    \   Load-balancing between Anycast Nodes is typically difficult to\n   achieve\
    \ (load distribution between nodes is generally unbalanced in\n   terms of request\
    \ and traffic load).  Distribution of load between\n   nodes for the purposes\
    \ of reliability, and coarse-grained\n   distribution of load for the purposes\
    \ of making popular services\n   scalable, can often be achieved, however.\n \
    \  The scale of the routing system through which a service is anycast\n   can\
    \ vary from a small Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) connecting a\n   small handful\
    \ of components, to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)\n   [RFC4271] connecting\
    \ the global Internet, depending on the nature of\n   the service distribution\
    \ that is required.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Goals
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Goals\n   A service may be anycast for a variety of reasons.  A number\
    \ of\n   common objectives are:\n   1.  Coarse (\"unbalanced\") distribution of\
    \ load across nodes, to allow\n       infrastructure to scale to increased numbers\
    \ of queries and to\n       accommodate transient query peaks;\n   2.  Mitigation\
    \ of non-distributed denial-of-service attacks by\n       localising damage to\
    \ single Anycast Nodes;\n   3.  Constraint of distributed denial-of-service attacks\
    \ or flash\n       crowds to local regions around Anycast Nodes.  Anycast\n  \
    \     distribution of a service provides the opportunity for traffic to\n    \
    \   be handled closer to its source, perhaps using high-performance\n       peering\
    \ links rather than oversubscribed, paid transit circuits;\n   4.  To provide\
    \ additional information to help identify the location\n       of traffic sources\
    \ in the case of attack (or query) traffic which\n       incorporates spoofed\
    \ source addresses.  This information is\n       derived from the property of\
    \ anycast service distribution that\n       the selection of the Anycast Node\
    \ used to service a particular\n       query may be related to the topological\
    \ source of the request.\n   5.  Improvement of query response time, by reducing\
    \ the network\n       distance between client and server with the provision of\
    \ a local\n       Anycast Node.  The extent to which query response time is\n\
    \       improved depends on the way that nodes are selected for the\n       clients\
    \ by the routing system.  Topological nearness within the\n       routing system\
    \ does not, in general, correlate to round-trip\n       performance across a network;\
    \ in some cases, response times may\n       see no reduction, and may increase.\n\
    \   6.  To reduce a list of servers to a single, distributed address.\n      \
    \ For example, a large number of authoritative nameservers for a\n       zone\
    \ may be deployed using a small set of anycast Service\n       Addresses; this\
    \ approach can increase the accessibility of zone\n       data in the DNS without\
    \ increasing the size of a referral\n       response from a nameserver authoritative\
    \ for the parent zone.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Protocol Suitability
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Protocol Suitability\n   When a service is anycast between two or more\
    \ nodes, the routing\n   system makes the node selection decision on behalf of\
    \ a client.\n   Since it is usually a requirement that a single client-server\n\
    \   interaction is carried out between a client and the same server node\n   for\
    \ the duration of the transaction, it follows that the routing\n   system's node\
    \ selection decision ought to be stable for substantially\n   longer than the\
    \ expected transaction time, if the service is to be\n   provided reliably.\n\
    \   Some services have very short transaction times, and may even be\n   carried\
    \ out using a single packet request and a single packet reply\n   (e.g., DNS transactions\
    \ over UDP transport).  Other services involve\n   far longer-lived transactions\
    \ (e.g., bulk file downloads and audio-\n   visual media streaming).\n   Services\
    \ may be anycast within very predictable routing systems,\n   which can remain\
    \ stable for long periods of time (e.g., anycast\n   within a well-managed and\
    \ topologically-simple IGP, where node\n   selection changes only occur as a response\
    \ to node failures).  Other\n   deployments have far less predictable characteristics\
    \ (see\n   Section 4.4.7).\n   The stability of the routing system, together with\
    \ the transaction\n   time of the service, should be carefully compared when deciding\n\
    \   whether a service is suitable for distribution using anycast.  In\n   some\
    \ cases, for new protocols, it may be practical to split large\n   transactions\
    \ into an initialisation phase that is handled by anycast\n   servers, and a sustained\
    \ phase that is provided by non-anycast\n   servers, perhaps chosen during the\
    \ initialisation phase.\n   This document deliberately avoids prescribing rules\
    \ as to which\n   protocols or services are suitable for distribution by anycast;\
    \ to\n   attempt to do so would be presumptuous.\n   Operators should be aware\
    \ that, especially for long running flows,\n   there are potential failure modes\
    \ using anycast that are more complex\n   than a simple 'destination unreachable'\
    \ failure using unicast.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Node Placement
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Node Placement\n   Decisions as to where Anycast Nodes should be placed\
    \ will depend to a\n   large extent on the goals of the service distribution.\
    \  For example:\n   o  A DNS recursive resolver service might be distributed within\
    \ an\n      ISP's network, one Anycast Node per site.\n   o  A root DNS server\
    \ service might be distributed throughout the\n      Internet; Anycast Nodes could\
    \ be located in regions with poor\n      external connectivity to ensure that\
    \ the DNS functions adequately\n      within the region during times of external\
    \ network failure.\n   o  An FTP mirror service might include local nodes located\
    \ at\n      exchange points, so that ISPs connected to that exchange point\n \
    \     could download bulk data more cheaply than if they had to use\n      expensive\
    \ transit circuits.\n   In general, node placement decisions should be made with\n\
    \   consideration of likely traffic requirements, the potential for flash\n  \
    \ crowds or denial-of-service traffic, the stability of the local\n   routing\
    \ system, and the failure modes with respect to node failure or\n   local routing\

- title: 4.3.1.  Anycast within an IGP
  contents:
  - "4.3.1.  Anycast within an IGP\n   There are several common motivations for the\
    \ distribution of a\n   Service Address within the scope of an IGP:\n   1.  to\
    \ improve service response times by hosting a service close to\n       other users\
    \ of the network;\n   2.  to improve service reliability by providing automatic\
    \ fail-over\n       to backup nodes; and\n   3.  to keep service traffic local\
    \ in order to avoid congesting wide-\n       area links.\n   In each case, the\
    \ decisions as to where and how services are\n   provisioned can be made by network\
    \ engineers without requiring such\n   operational complexities as regional variances\
    \ in the configuration\n   of client computers, or deliberate DNS incoherence\
    \ (causing DNS\n   queries to yield different answers depending on where the queries\n\
    \   originate).\n   When a service is anycast within an IGP, the routing system\
    \ is\n   typically under the control of the same organisation that is\n   providing\
    \ the service, and hence the relationship between service\n   transaction characteristics\
    \ and network stability are likely to be\n   well-understood.  This technique\
    \ is consequently applicable to a\n   larger number of applications than Internet-wide\
    \ anycast service\n   distribution (see Section 4.1).\n   An IGP will generally\
    \ have no inherent restriction on the length of\n   prefix that can be introduced\
    \ to it.  In this case, there is no need\n   to construct a covering prefix for\
    \ particular Service Addresses; host\n   routes corresponding to the Service Address\
    \ can instead be introduced\n   to the routing system.  See Section 4.4.2 for\
    \ more discussion of the\n   requirement for a covering prefix.\n   IGPs often\
    \ feature little or no aggregation of routes, partly due to\n   algorithmic complexities\
    \ in supporting aggregation.  There is little\n   motivation for aggregation in\
    \ many networks' IGPs in many cases,\n   since the amount of routing information\
    \ carried in the IGP is small\n   enough that scaling concerns in routers do not\
    \ arise.  For discussion\n   of aggregation risks in other routing systems, see\
    \ Section 4.4.8.\n   By reducing the scope of the IGP to just the hosts providing\
    \ service\n   (together with one or more gateway routers), this technique can\
    \ be\n   applied to the construction of server clusters.  This application is\n\
    \   discussed in some detail in [ISC-TN-2004-1].\n"

- title: 4.4.1.  Signalling Service Availability
  contents:
  - "4.4.1.  Signalling Service Availability\n   When a routing system is provided\
    \ with reachability information for a\n   Service Address from an individual node,\
    \ packets addressed to that\n   Service Address will start to arrive at the node.\
    \  Since it is\n   essential for the node to be ready to accept requests before\
    \ they\n   start to arrive, a coupling between the routing information and the\n\
    \   availability of the service at a particular node is desirable.\n   Where a\
    \ routing advertisement from a node corresponds to a single\n   Service Address,\
    \ this coupling might be such that availability of the\n   service triggers the\
    \ route advertisement, and non-availability of the\n   service triggers a route\
    \ withdrawal.  This can be achieved using\n   routing protocol implementations\
    \ on the same server.  These\n   implementations provide the service being distributed\
    \ and are\n   configured to advertise and withdraw the route advertisement in\n\
    \   conjunction with the availability (and health) of the software on the\n  \
    \ host that processes service requests.  An example of such an\n   arrangement\
    \ for a DNS service is included in [ISC-TN-2004-1].\n   Where a routing advertisement\
    \ from a node corresponds to two or more\n   Service Addresses, it may not be\
    \ appropriate to trigger a route\n   withdrawal due to the non-availability of\
    \ a single service.  Another\n   approach in the case where the service is down\
    \ at one Anycast Node is\n   to route requests to a different Anycast Node where\
    \ the service is\n   working normally.  This approach is discussed in Section\
    \ 4.8.\n   Rapid advertisement/withdrawal oscillations can cause operational\n\
    \   problems, and nodes should be configured such that rapid oscillations\n  \
    \ are avoided (e.g., by implementing a minimum delay following a\n   withdrawal\
    \ before the service can be re-advertised).  See\n   Section 4.4.4 for a discussion\
    \ of route oscillations in BGP.\n"
- title: 4.4.2.  Covering Prefix
  contents:
  - "4.4.2.  Covering Prefix\n   In some routing systems (e.g., the BGP-based routing\
    \ system of the\n   global Internet), it is not possible, in general, to propagate\
    \ a host\n   route with confidence that the route will propagate throughout the\n\
    \   network.  This is a consequence of operational policy, and not a\n   protocol\
    \ restriction.\n   In such cases it is necessary to propagate a route that covers\
    \ the\n   Service Address, and that has a sufficiently short prefix that it\n\
    \   will not be discarded by commonly-deployed import policies.  For IPv4\n  \
    \ Service Addresses, this is often a 24-bit prefix, but there are other\n   well-documented\
    \ examples of IPv4 import polices that filter on\n   Regional Internet Registry\
    \ (RIR) allocation boundaries, and hence\n   some experimentation may be prudent.\
    \  Corresponding import policies\n   for IPv6 prefixes also exist.  See Section\
    \ 4.5 for more discussion of\n   IPv6 Service Addresses and corresponding anycast\
    \ routes.\n   The propagation of a single route per service has some associated\n\
    \   scaling issues, which are discussed in Section 4.4.8.\n   Where multiple Service\
    \ Addresses are covered by the same covering\n   route, there is no longer a tight\
    \ coupling between the advertisement\n   of that route and the individual services\
    \ associated with the covered\n   host routes.  The resulting impact on signalling\

    \ ASes, where the\n       neighbour ASes have selected different nodes for a particular\n\
    \       anycast destination will, in general, cause request packets to be\n  \
    \     distributed across multiple Anycast Nodes.  This will have the\n       effect\
    \ that the anycast service is unavailable to clients\n       downstream of the\
