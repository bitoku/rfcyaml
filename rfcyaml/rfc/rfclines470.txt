Change in Socket for TIP News Facility
The Socket which supports the TIP News Facility has been changed to socket 367 (Octal) at BBN TENEX.
TIP users should be uneffected by this change since the TIP program has already been changed to ICP to the new socket.
Because some user TELNET programs have been implemented a "news" command, the old socket will be maintained until April 15, 1973 to give implementers time to change to the new socket.
