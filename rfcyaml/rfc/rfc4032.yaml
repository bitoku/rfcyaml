  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 3312 [3] defines the framework for SIP [2] preconditions,
    which\n   is a generic framework that allows SIP UAs (User Agents) to suspend\n
    \  the establishment of a session until a set of preconditions are met.\n   Although
    only Quality of Service (QoS) preconditions have been\n   defined so far, this
    framework supports different types of\n   preconditions.  (QoS preconditions are
    defined by RFC 3312 as well).\n   This document updates RFC 3312,  provides guidelines
    for authors of\n   new precondition types and explains which topics they need
    to discuss\n   when defining them.  In addition, it updates some of the procedures\n
    \  in RFC 3312 for using SIP preconditions in situations that involve\n   session
    mobility as described below.\n   RFC 3312 focuses on media sessions that do not
    move around.  That is,\n   media is sent between the same end-points throughout
    the duration of\n   the session.  Nevertheless, media sessions established by
    SIP are not\n   always static.\n   SIP offers mechanisms to provide session mobility,
    namely re-INVITEs\n   and UPDATEs [5].  While existing implementations of RFC
    3312 can\n   probably handle session mobility, there is a need to explicitly point\n
    \  out the issues involved and make a slight update on some of the\n   procedures
    defined there in.  With the updated procedures defined in\n   this document, messages
    carrying precondition information become more\n   explicit about the current status
    of the preconditions.\n   Specifically, we now allow answers to downgrade current
    status values\n   (this was disallowed by RFC 3312).  We consider moving an existing\n
    \  stream to a new location as equivalent to establishing a new stream.\n   Therefore,
    answers moving streams to new locations set all the\n   current status values
    in their answers to \"No\" and start a new\n   precondition negotiation from scratch.\n"

      the expected behavior of a UA on reception of optional\n   preconditions.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.4.  Suspending and Resuming Session Establishment\n   Section 6 of RFC 3312
      describes the behavior of UAs from the moment\n   session establishment is suspended,
      due to a set of preconditions,\n   until it is resumed when these preconditions
      are met.  In general,\n   the called user is not alerted until the preconditions
      are met.\n   In addition to not alerting the user, each precondition type MUST\n
      \  define any extra actions UAs should perform or refrain from\n   performing
      when session establishment is suspended.  The behavior of\n   media streams
      during session suspension is therefore part of the\n   definition of a particular
      precondition type.  Some precondition\n   types may allow media streams to send
      and receive packets during\n   session suspension; others may not.  Consequently,
      the following\n   paragraph from RFC 3312 only applies to QoS preconditions:\n
      \     While session establishment is suspended, user agents SHOULD not\n      send
      any data over any media stream.  In the case of RTP, neither\n      RTP nor
      RTCP packets are sent.\n   To clarify the previous paragraph, the control messages
      used to\n   establish connections in connection-oriented transport protocols\n
      \  (e.g., TCP SYNs) are not affected by the previous rule.  So, user\n   agents
      follow standard rules (e.g., the SDP 'setup' attribute [7]) to\n   decide when
      to establish the connection, regardless of QoS\n   preconditions.\n   New precondition
      types MUST also describe the behaviour of UAs on\n   reception of a re-INVITE
      or an UPDATE with preconditions for an\n   ongoing session.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Issues Related to Session Mobility\n   Section 5 of RFC 3312 describes how
    to use SIP [2] preconditions with\n   the offer/answer model [4].  RFC 3312 gives
    a set of rules that allow\n   a user agent to communicate changes in the current
    status of the\n   preconditions to the remote user agent.\n   The idea is that
    a given user agent knows about the current status of\n   some part of the preconditions
    (e.g., send direction of the QoS\n   precondition) through local information (e.g.,
    an RSVP RESV is\n   received indicating that resource reservation was successful).
    \ The\n   UAC (User Agent Client) informs the UAS (User Agent Server) about\n
    \  changes in the current status by sending an offer to the UAS.  The\n   UAS,
    in turn, could (if needed) send an offer to the UAC informing it\n   about the
    status of the part of the preconditions the UAS has local\n   information about.\n
    \     Note, however, that UASs do not usually send updates about the\n      current
    status to the UAC because UASs are the ones resuming\n      session establishment
    when all the preconditions are met.\n      Therefore, rather than performing an
    offer/answer exchange to\n      inform the UAC that all the preconditions are
    met, they simply\n      send a 180 (Ringing) response indicating that session\n
    \     establishment has been resumed.\n   While RFC 3312 allows updating current
    status information using the\n   methods described above, it does not allow downgrading
    current status\n   values in answers, as shown in the third row of Table 3 of
    RFC 3312.\n   Figure 1 shows how performing such a downgrade in an answer would\n
    \  sometimes be needed.\n                            3pcc\n                 A

    \       |\n                 Figure 1: Session mobility using 3pcc\n   The 3pcc
    (Third Party Call Control) [6] controller in Figure 1 has\n   established a session
    between A and B using dialog 1 towards A and\n   dialog 2 towards B.  At that
    point, the controller wants A to have a\n   session with C instead of B.  To transfer
    A to C (configuration shown\n   at the bottom of Figure 1), the controller sends
    an empty (no offer)\n   re-INVITE to A.  Since A does not know that the session
    will be\n   moved, its offer in the 200 OK states that the current status of the\n
    \  media stream in the send direction is \"Yes\".  After contacting C\n   establishing
    dialog 3, the controller sends back an answer to A.\n   This answer contains a
    new destination for the media (C) and should\n   have downgraded the current status
    of the media stream to \"No\", since\n   there is no reservation of resources
    between A and C.\n"

    - "4.1.  Update to RFC 3312\n   Below is a set of new rules that update RFC 3312
      to address the\n   issues above.\n   The rule below applies to offerers moving
      a media stream to a new\n   address:\n   When a stream is being moved to a new
      transport address, the offerer\n   MUST set all current status values about
      which it does not have local\n   information about to \"No\".\n   Note that
      for streams using segmented status (as opposed to end-to-\n   end status), the
      fact that the address for the media stream at the\n   local segment changes
      may or may not affect the status of\n   preconditions at the remote segment.
      \ However, moving an existing\n   stream to a new location, from the preconditions
      point of view, is\n   like establishing a new stream.  Therefore, it is appropriate
      to set\n   all the current status values to \"No\" and start a new precondition\n
      \  negotiation from scratch.\n   The updated table and rules below apply to
      an answerer that is moving\n   a media stream.  The offerer was not aware of
      the move when it\n   generated the offer.\n   Table 3 of RFC 3312 needs to be
      updated to allow answerers to\n   downgrade current status values.  The following
      table shows the\n   result.\n   Transac status table  Local status table  New
      values transac./local\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n

      on local info\n   An answerer MUST downgrade the current status values received
      in the\n   offer if it has local information about them or if the media stream\n
      \  is being moved to a new transport address.\n   Note that for streams using
      segmented status, the address change at\n   the answerer may or may not affect
      the status of the preconditions at\n   the offerer's segment.  However, as stated
      above, moving an existing\n   stream to a new location, from the preconditions
      point of view, is\n   like establishing a new stream.  Therefore, it is appropriate

    - "4.2.  Desired Status\n   The desired status that a UA wants for a media stream
      after the\n   stream is moved to a new transport address may be different than
      the\n   desired status negotiated for the stream originally.  A UA, for\n   instance,
      may require mandatory QoS over a low bandwidth link but be\n   satisfied with
      optional QoS when the stream is moved to a high\n   bandwidth link.\n   If the
      new desired status is higher than the previous one (e.g.,\n   optional to mandatory),
      the UA, following RFC 3312 procedures, may\n   upgrade its desired status in
      an offer or in an answer.  If the new\n   desired status is lower that the previous
      one (i.e., mandatory to\n   optional), the UA, following RFC 3312 procedures
      as well, may\n   downgrade its desired status only in an offer (i.e., not in
