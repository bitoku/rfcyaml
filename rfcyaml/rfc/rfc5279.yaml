- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   3GPP is a cooperation of international telecommunication\
    \ standards\n   bodies developing technologies for cellular networks.  This activity\n\
    \   is supported by a membership composed of network operators, equipment\n  \
    \ vendors, content providers, and other suppliers to the mobile market.\n   Some\
    \ of the technologies being developed by 3GPP need URN namespaces\n   that are\
    \ managed so that they are unique and persistent.  To assure\n   that the uniqueness\
    \ is absolute, the registration of a specific NID\n   for use by 3GPP was deemed\
    \ appropriate.  Therefore, a full and\n   complete registration will follow the\
    \ namespace specification process\n   as defined in RFC 3406 [RFC3406].\n"

    \      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the\n      \"\
    3gpp\" NID will have the following structure:\n            urn:3gpp:{3gpp-urn}\n\
    \      where the \"3gpp-urn\" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the\n    \
    \  NSS(Namespace Specific String) Syntax described in RFC 2141\n      [RFC2141]\
    \ and defines a specific resource type.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \      3GPP provides information on registration for each URN.  More\n      information\
    \ about 3GPP and the registration activities and\n      procedures to be followed\
    \ are available at:\n            http://www.3gpp.org/tb/Other/URN/URN.htm\n  \
    \ Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      3GPP will manage resources using\
    \ the \"3gpp\" NID and will be the\n      authority for managing the \"3gpp-urn\"\
    \ strings.  In the associated\n      procedures, 3GPP will ensure the uniqueness\
    \ of the strings\n      themselves or shall permit secondary responsibility for\
    \ management\n      of well-defined sub-trees.\n      3GPP may permit use of experimental\
    \ type values that will not be\n      registered.  As a consequence, multiple\
    \ users may end up using the\n      same value for separate uses.  Unregistered\
    \ type values will only\n      be allowed in sub-namespaces clearly marked as\
    \ experimental, to\n      help implementors avoid \"leaking\" experimental values\
    \ into real\n      use.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      3GPP\
    \ will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of\n      the \"3gpp\"\
    \ NID.  This will be structured such that each \"3gpp-\n      urn\", if needed,\
    \ will have a separate description and registration\n      table.\n      The registration\
    \ tables and information will be published and\n      maintained by 3GPP on its\
    \ web site.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      3GPP will provide procedures\
    \ for registration of each type of\n      resource that it maintains.  Each such\
    \ resource may have three\n      types of registration activities:\n      1. \
    \ Registered values associated with 3GPP specifications or\n          services\n\
    \      2.  Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities\n      3.  Name\
    \ models for use in experimental purposes\n   New Namespace Identifier (NID) labels\n\
    \      The Entries in the registration table will be the following:\n        3gpp-urn:\
    \    the registered value;\n        Description: description of the registered\
    \ value;\n        Reference:   3GPP spec that defines the value;\n        Contact:\
    \     person requesting the URN assignment.\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n\
    \      The namespace is not listed with a Resolution Discovery System\n      (RDS),\
    \ as this is not relevant.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      No special\
    \ considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of\n      RFC 2141 [RFC2141]\
    \ apply.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled\
    \ by procedures\n      supported and maintained by 3GPP.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"
- title: 3.  Examples
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples\n   The following examples are representative URNs that could be\
    \ assigned\n   by 3GPP.  They are not actual strings that are assigned.\n   urn:3gpp:featurephones\n\
    \      Defines the \"3gpp-urn\" to be used for \"featurephones\".\n   urn:3gpp:acme.foo-serv\n\
    \      Defines the URN associated with the operator identified by the\n      \"\
    3gpp-urn\" value \"acme\", which has decided to register and provide\n      information\
    \ about its service identified by value \"foo-serv\".\n"
- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project is developing\
    \ a variety of\n   enablers and applications.  Some of these require information\
    \ to be\n   fully specified.\n   For proper operation, descriptions of the needed\
    \ information must\n   exist for the URNs and be available in a unique, reliable,\
    \ and\n   persistent manner.\n   As 3GPP is ongoing and covers many technical\
    \ areas, the possibility\n   of binding to various other namespace repositories\
    \ has been deemed\n   impractical.  Each object or description, as defined in\
    \ 3GPP, could\n   possibly be related to multiple different other namespaces,\
    \ so\n   further conflicts of association could occur.  Thus, the intent is to\n\
    \   utilize the 3GPP specifications manager as the naming authority for\n   3GPP-defined\
    \ URNs and its descriptions.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   The objects and descriptions required for enablers\
    \ produced by 3GPP\n   are generally available for use by other organizations.\
    \  The 3rd\n   Generation Partnership Project Support Office will provide access\
    \ and\n   support for name requests by these organizations.  This support can\n\
    \   be enabled in a timely and responsive fashion as new objects and\n   descriptions\
    \ are produced.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are no security considerations other than\
    \ those normally\n   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   This section registers a new URN NID with the registration\
    \ provided\n   in Section 2.\n   \"3gpp-urn\" strings are identified by label\
    \ managed by 3GPP.  Thus,\n   creating a new label does not require any IANA action.\n"
