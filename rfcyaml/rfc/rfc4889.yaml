  - "Abstract\n   With current Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support, all\n   communications\
    \ to and from Mobile Network Nodes must go through the\n   Mobile Router and Home\
    \ Agent (MRHA) tunnel when the mobile network is\n   away.  This results in increased\
    \ length of packet route and increased\n   packet delay in most cases.  To overcome\
    \ these limitations, one might\n   have to turn to Route Optimization (RO) for\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Network Mobility Route Optimization Problem Statement [1]\
    \ describes\n   operational limitations and overheads incurred in a deployment\
    \ of\n   Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support [2], which could be alleviated\n\
    \   by a set of NEMO Route Optimization techniques to be defined.  The\n   term\
    \ \"Route Optimization\" is used in a broader sense than already\n   defined for\
    \ IPv6 Host Mobility in [3] to loosely refer to any\n   approach that optimizes\
    \ the transmission of packets between a Mobile\n   Network Node and a Correspondent\
    \ Node.\n   Solutions that would fit that general description were continuously\n\
    \   proposed since the early days of NEMO, even before the Working Group\n   was\
    \ formed.  Based on that long-standing stream of innovation, this\n   document\
    \ classifies, at a generic level, the solution space of the\n   possible approaches\
    \ that could be taken to solve the Route\n   Optimization-related problems for\
    \ NEMO.  The scope of the solutions,\n   the benefits, and the impacts to the\
    \ existing implementations and\n   deployments are analyzed.  This work should\
    \ serve as a foundation for\n   the NEMO WG to decide where to focus its Route\
    \ Optimization effort,\n   with a deeper understanding of the relative strengths\
    \ and weaknesses\n   of each approach.\n   It should be beneficial for readers\
    \ to keep in mind the design\n   requirements of NEMO [4].  A point to note is\
    \ that since this\n   document discusses aspects of Route Optimization, the reader\
    \ may\n   assume that a mobile network or a mobile host is away when they are\n\
    \   mentioned throughout this document, unless it is explicitly specified\n  \
    \ that they are at home.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   It is expected that readers are familiar with terminologies\
    \ related\n   to mobility in [3] and [5], and NEMO-related terms defined in [6].\n\
    \   In addition, the following Route Optimization-specific terms are used\n  \
    \ in this document:\n   Correspondent Router (CR)\n      This refers to the router\
    \ that is capable of terminating a Route\n      Optimization session on behalf\
    \ of a Correspondent Node.\n   Correspondent Entity (CE)\n      This refers to\
    \ the entity that a Mobile Router or Mobile Network\n      Node attempts to establish\
    \ a Route Optimization session with.\n      Depending on the Route Optimization\
    \ approach, the Correspondent\n      Entity may be a Correspondent Node or Correspondent\
    \ Router.\n"
- title: 2.  Benefits of NEMO Route Optimization
  contents:
  - "2.  Benefits of NEMO Route Optimization\n   NEMO Route Optimization addresses\
    \ the problems discussed in [1].\n   Although a standardized NEMO Route Optimization\
    \ solution has yet to\n   materialize, one can expect it to show some of the following\n\
    \   benefits:\n   o  Shorter Delay\n      Route Optimization involves the selection\
    \ and utilization of a\n      lesser-cost (thus generally shorter and faster)\
    \ route to be taken\n      for traffic between a Mobile Network Node and its Correspondent\n\
    \      Node.  Hence, Route Optimization should improve the latency of the\n  \
    \    data traffic between the two end nodes.  This may in turn lead to\n     \
    \ better overall Quality of Service characteristics, such as reduced\n      jitter\
    \ and packet loss.\n   o  Reduced Consumption of Overall Network Resources\n \
    \     Through the selection of a shorter route, the total link\n      utilization\
    \ for all links used by traffic between the two end\n      nodes should be much\
    \ lower than that used if Route Optimization is\n      not carried out.  This\
    \ would result in a lighter network load with\n      reduced congestion.\n   o\
    \  Reduced Susceptibility to Link Failure\n      If a link along the bi-directional\
    \ tunnel is disrupted, all\n      traffic to and from the mobile network will\
    \ be affected until IP\n      routing recovers from the failure.  An optimized\
    \ route would\n      conceivably utilize a smaller number of links between the\
    \ two end\n      nodes.  Hence, the probability of a loss of connectivity due\
    \ to a\n      single point of failure at a link should be lower as compared to\n\
    \      the longer non-optimized route.\n   o  Greater Data Efficiency\n      Depending\
    \ on the actual solution for NEMO Route Optimization, the\n      data packets\
    \ exchanged between two end nodes may not require as\n      many levels of encapsulation\
    \ as that in NEMO Basic Support.  This\n      would mean less packet overheads\
    \ and higher data efficiency.  In\n      particular, avoiding packet fragmentation\
    \ that may be induced by\n      the multiple levels of tunneling is critical for\
    \ end-to-end\n      efficiency from the viewpoints of buffering and transport\n\
    \      protocols.\n   o  Reduced Processing Delay\n      In a nested mobile network,\
    \ the application of Route Optimization\n      may eliminate the need for multiple\
    \ encapsulations required by\n      NEMO Basic Support, which may result in less\
    \ processing delay at\n      the points of encapsulation and decapsulation.\n\
    \   o  Avoiding a Bottleneck in the Home Network\n      NEMO Route Optimization\
    \ allows traffic to bypass the Home Agents.\n      Apart from having a more direct\
    \ route, this also avoids routing\n      traffic via the home network, which may\
    \ be a potential bottleneck\n      otherwise.\n   o  Avoid the Security Policy\
    \ Issue\n      Security policy may forbid a Mobile Router from tunneling traffic\n\
    \      of Visiting Mobile Nodes into the home network of the Mobile\n      Router.\
    \  Route Optimization can be used to avoid this issue by\n      forwarding traffic\
    \ from Visiting Mobile Nodes directly to their\n      destinations without going\
    \ through the home network of the Mobile\n      Router.\n      However, it should\
    \ be taken into consideration that a Route\n      Optimization mechanism may not\
    \ be an appropriate solution since\n      the Mobile Router may still be held\
    \ responsible for illegal\n      traffic sent from its Mobile Network Nodes even\
    \ when Route\n      Optimization is used.  In addition, there can be a variety\
    \ of\n      different policies that might conflict with the deployment of\n  \
    \    Route Optimization for Visiting Mobile Nodes.  Being a policy\n      issue,\
    \ solving this with a protocol at the policy plane might be\n      more appropriate.\n\
    \   o  Avoid the Instability and Stalemate\n      [1] described a potential stalemate\
    \ situation when a Home Agent is\n      nested within a mobile network.  Route\
    \ Optimization may circumvent\n      such stalemate situations by directly forwarding\
    \ traffic upstream.\n      However, it should be noted that certain Route Optimization\n\
    \      schemes may require signaling packets to be first routed via the\n    \
    \  Home Agent before an optimized route can be established.  In such\n      cases,\
    \ a Route Optimization solution cannot avoid the stalemate.\n"

  - "3.  Different Scenarios of NEMO Route Optimization\n   There are multiple proposals\
    \ for providing various forms of Route\n   Optimization in the NEMO context. \
    \ In the following sub-sections, we\n   describe the different scenarios that\
    \ would require a Route\n   Optimization mechanism and list the potential solutions\
    \ that have\n   been proposed in that area.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Non-Nested NEMO Route Optimization
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Non-Nested NEMO Route Optimization\n   The Non-Nested NEMO Route Optimization\
    \ involves a Mobile Router\n   sending binding information to a Correspondent\
    \ Entity.  It does not\n   involve nesting of Mobile Routers or Visiting Mobile\
    \ Nodes.  The\n   Correspondent Entity can be a Correspondent Node or a Correspondent\n\
    \   Router.  The interesting case is when the Correspondent Entity is a\n   Correspondent\
    \ Router.  With the use of Correspondent Router, Route\n   Optimization session\
    \ is terminated at the Correspondent Router on\n   behalf of the Correspondent\
    \ Node.  As long as the Correspondent\n   Router is located \"closer\" to the\
    \ Correspondent Node than the Home\n   Agent of the Mobile Router, the route between\
    \ Mobile Network Node and\n   the Correspondent Node can be said to be optimized.\
    \  For this\n   purpose, Correspondent Routers may be deployed to provide an optimal\n\
    \   route as illustrated in Figure 1.\n                  **************************\

    \   This form of optimization can carry traffic in both directions or\n   independently\
    \ for the two directions of traffic:\n   o  From MNN to CN\n      The Mobile Router\
    \ locates the Correspondent Router, establishes a\n      tunnel with that Correspondent\
    \ Router and sets up a route to the\n      Correspondent Node via the Correspondent\
    \ Router over the tunnel.\n      Traffic to the Correspondent Node would no longer\
    \ flow through the\n      Home Agent anymore.\n   o  From CN to MNN\n      The\
    \ Correspondent Router is on the path of the traffic from the\n      Correspondent\
    \ Node to the Home Agent.  In addition, it has an\n      established tunnel with\
    \ the current Care-of Address (CoA) of the\n      Mobile Router and is aware of\
    \ the Mobile Network Prefix(es)\n      managed by the Mobile Router.  The Correspondent\
    \ Router can thus\n      intercept packets going to the mobile network, and forward\
    \ them to\n      the Mobile Router over the established tunnel.\n   A straightforward\
    \ approach to Route Optimization in NEMO is for the\n   Mobile Router to attempt\
    \ Route Optimization with a Correspondent\n   Entity.  This can be viewed as a\
    \ logical extension to NEMO Basic\n   Support, where the Mobile Router would send\
    \ Binding Updates\n   containing one or more Mobile Network Prefix options to\
    \ the\n   Correspondent Entity.  The Correspondent Entity, having received the\n\
    \   Binding Update, can then set up a bi-directional tunnel with the\n   Mobile\
    \ Router at the current Care-of Address of the Mobile Router,\n   and inject a\
    \ route to its routing table so that packets destined for\n   addresses in the\
    \ Mobile Network Prefix will be routed through the bi-\n   directional tunnel.\n\
    \   The definition of Correspondent Router does not limit it to be a\n   fixed\
    \ router.  Here we consider the case where the Correspondent\n   Router is a Mobile\
    \ Router.  Thus, Route Optimization is initiated and\n   performed between a Mobile\
    \ Router and its peer Mobile Router.  Such\n   solutions are often posed with\
    \ a requirement to leave the Mobile\n   Network Nodes untouched, as with the NEMO\
    \ Basic Support protocol, and\n   therefore Mobile Routers handle the optimization\
    \ management on behalf\n   of the Mobile Network Nodes.  Thus, providing Route\
    \ Optimization for\n   a Visiting Mobile Node is often out of scope for such a\
    \ scenario\n   because such interaction would require extensions to the Mobile\
    \ IPv6\n   protocol.  This scenario is illustrated in Figure 2.\n   HAofCR **********************************\

    \ for Nested Mobility scenarios can usually be divided into\n   two cases based\
    \ on whether the nesting involves Mobile IPv6 hosts or\n   only involves Mobile\
    \ Routers.  Since Mobile IPv6 defines its own\n   Route Optimization mechanism,\

    \ in\n   HMIPv6 [13] to optimize routes between themselves.  Another example\n\
    \   is to make use of proxy Home Agent such as defined in the global Home\n  \
    \ Agent to Home Agent (HAHA) protocol [14].  A proxy Home Agent acts as\n   a\
    \ Home Agent for the Mobile Node, and acts as a Mobile Node for the\n   Home Agent,\
    \ Correspondent Node, Correspondent Router, and other\n   proxies.  In particular,\
    \ the proxy Home Agent terminates the MRHA\n   tunnel and the associated encryption,\
    \ extracts the packets, and re-\n   encapsulates them to the destination.  In\
    \ this case, proxy Home\n   Agents are distributed in the infrastructure and each\
    \ Mobile Router\n   binds to the closest proxy.  The proxy, in turn, performs\
    \ a primary\n   binding with a real Home Agent for that Mobile Router.  Then,\
    \ the\n   proxy might establish secondary bindings with other Home Agents or\n\
    \   proxies in the infrastructure, in order to improve the end-to-end\n   path.\
    \  In this case, the proxies discover each other using some form\n   of Next Hop\
    \ Resolution Protocol, establish a tunnel and exchange the\n   relevant Mobile\
    \ Network Prefix information in the form of explicit\n   prefix routes.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ another approach is to use prefix delegation.  Here,\n   each Mobile Router\
    \ in a nested mobile network is delegated a Mobile\n   Network Prefix from the\
    \ access router using DHCP Prefix Delegation\n   [15].  Each Mobile Router also\
    \ autoconfigures its Care-of Address\n   from this delegated prefix.  In this\
    \ way, the Care-of Addresses of\n   each Mobile Router are all formed from an\
    \ aggregatable address space\n   starting from the access router.  This may be\
    \ used to eliminate the\n   multiple tunnels caused by nesting of Mobile Nodes.\n"

    \ depends on the\n   solution, but is likely to exceed the amount required in\
    \ the home\n   Binding Update procedure defined in NEMO Basic Support.  The amount\n\
    \   of signaling is likely to increase with the increasing number of\n   Mobile\
    \ Network Nodes and/or Correspondent Nodes, and may be amplified\n   with nesting\
    \ of mobile networks.  It may scale to unacceptable\n   heights, especially to\
    \ the resource-scarce mobile node, which\n   typically has limited power, memory,\
    \ and processing capacity.\n   This may lead to an issue that impacts NEMO Route\
    \ Optimization, known\n   as the phenomenon of \"Binding Update Storm\", or more\
    \ generally,\n   \"Signaling Storm\".  This occurs when a change in point of attachment\n\
    \   of the mobile network is accompanied with a sudden burst of signaling\n  \
    \ messages, resulting in temporary congestion, packet delays, or even\n   packet\
    \ loss.  This effect will be especially significant for wireless\n   environment\
    \ where bandwidth is relatively limited.\n   It is possible to moderate the effect\
    \ of Signaling Storm by\n   incorporating mechanisms such as spreading the transmissions\
    \ burst of\n   signaling messages over a longer period of time, or aggregating\
    \ the\n   signaling messages.\n   Even so, the amount of signaling required might\
    \ be overwhelming,\n   since large mobile networks (such as those deployed on\
    \ a train or\n   plane) may potentially have a large number of flows with a large\n\
    \   number of Correspondent Nodes.  This might suggest a need to have\n   some\

    \ Another concern is that the resulting\n   path may not be a true optimized one,\
    \ since it depends on the\n   relative positions of the infrastructure entities\
    \ with respect to the\n   mobile network and the Correspondent Node.\n"

  - "5.2.  Who Initiates Route Optimization? When?\n   Having determined the entities\
    \ involved in the Route Optimization in\n   the previous sub-section, the next\
    \ question is which of these\n   entities should initiate the Route Optimization\
    \ session.  Usually,\n   the node that is moving (i.e., Mobile Network Node or\
    \ Mobile Router)\n   is in the best position to detect its mobility.  Thus, in\
    \ general, it\n   is better for the mobile node to initiate the Route Optimization\n\
    \   session in order to handle the topology changes in any kind of\n   mobility\
    \ pattern and achieve the optimized route promptly.  However,\n   when the mobile\
    \ node is within a nested mobile network, the detection\n   of the mobility of\
    \ upstream Mobile Routers may need to be conveyed to\n   the nested Mobile Network\
    \ Node.  This might incur longer signaling\n   delay as discussed in Section 4.3.\n\
    \   Some solution may enable the node on the correspondent side to\n   initiate\
    \ the Route Optimization session in certain situations.  For\n   instance, when\
    \ the Route Optimization state that is already\n   established on the Correspondent\
    \ Entity is about to expire but the\n   communication is still active, depending\
    \ on the policy, the\n   Correspondent Entity may initiate a Route Optimization\
    \ request with\n   the mobile node side.\n   There is also the question of when\
    \ Route Optimization should be\n   initiated.  Because Route Optimization would\
    \ certainly incur\n   tradeoffs of various forms, it might not be desirable for\
    \ Route\n   Optimization to be performed for any kind of traffic.  This is,\n\
    \   however, implementation specific and policy driven.\n   A related question\
    \ is how often signaling messages should be sent to\n   maintain the Route Optimization\
    \ session.  Typically, signaling\n   messages are likely to be sent whenever there\
    \ are topological\n   changes.  The discussion in Section 4.1 should be considered.\
    \  In\n   addition, a Lifetime value is often used to indicate the period of\n\
    \   validity for the Route Optimization session.  Signaling messages\n   would\
    \ have to be sent before the Lifetime value expires in order to\n   maintain the\
    \ Route Optimization session.  The choice of Lifetime\n   value needs to balance\
    \ between different considerations.  On one\n   hand, a short Lifetime value would\
    \ increase the amount of signaling\n   overhead.  On the other hand, a long Lifetime\
    \ value may expose the\n   Correspondent Entity to the risk of having an obsolete\
    \ binding cache\n   entry, which creates an opportunity for an attacker to exploit.\n"
- title: 5.3.  How Is Route Optimization Capability Detected?
  contents:
  - "5.3.  How Is Route Optimization Capability Detected?\n   The question here is\
    \ how the initiator of Route Optimization knows\n   whether the Correspondent\
    \ Entity supports the functionality required\n   to established a Route Optimization\
    \ session.  The usual method is for\n   the initiator to attempt Route Optimization\
    \ with the Correspondent\n   Entity.  Depending on the protocol specifics, the\
    \ initiator may\n   receive (i) a reply from the Correspondent Entity indicating\
    \ its\n   capability, (ii) an error message from the Correspondent Entity, or\n\
    \   (iii) no response from the Correspondent Entity within a certain time\n  \
    \ period.  This serves as an indication of whether or not the\n   Correspondent\
    \ Entity supports the required functionality to establish\n   Route Optimization.\
    \  This form of detection may incur additional\n   delay as a penalty when the\
    \ Correspondent Entity does not have Route\n   Optimization capability, especially\
    \ when the Route Optimization\n   mechanism is using in-band signaling.\n   When\
    \ the Correspondent Entity is not the Correspondent Node but a\n   Correspondent\
    \ Router, an immediate question is how its presence can\n   be detected.  One\
    \ approach is for the initiator to send an Internet\n   Control Message Protocol\
    \ (ICMP) message containing the address of the\n   Correspondent Node to a well-known\
    \ anycast address reserved for all\n   Correspondent Routers [7][8].  Only the\
    \ Correspondent Router that is\n   capable of terminating the Route Optimization\
    \ session on behalf of\n   the Correspondent Node will respond.  Another way is\
    \ to insert a\n   Router Alert Option (RAO) into a packet sent to the Correspondent\n\
    \   Node [9].  Any Correspondent Router en route will process the Router\n   Alert\
    \ Option and send a response to the Mobile Router.\n   Both approaches need to\
    \ consider the possibility of multiple\n   Correspondent Routers responding to\
    \ the initiator, and both\n   approaches will generate additional traffic or processing\
    \ load to\n   other routers.  Furthermore, both approaches have yet to consider\
    \ how\n   the initiator can verify the authenticity of the Correspondent\n   Routers\
    \ that responded.\n"
- title: 5.4.  How is the Address of the Mobile Network Node Represented?
  contents:
  - "5.4.  How is the Address of the Mobile Network Node Represented?\n   Normally,\
    \ Route Optimization would mean that a binding between the\n   address of a Mobile\
    \ Network Node and the location of the mobile\n   network is registered at the\
    \ Correspondent Entity.  Before exploring\n   different ways of binding (see Section\
    \ 5.5), one must first ask how\n   the address of the Mobile Network Node is represented.\
    \  Basically,\n   there are two ways to represent the Mobile Network Node's address:\n\
    \   o  inferred by the use of the Mobile Network Prefix, or\n   o  explicitly\
    \ specifying the address of the Mobile Network Node.\n   Using the Mobile Network\
    \ Prefix would usually mean that the initiator\n   is the Mobile Router, and has\
    \ the benefit of binding numerous Mobile\n   Network Nodes with one signaling.\
    \  However, it also means that if\n   location privacy is compromised, the location\
    \ privacy of an entire\n   Mobile Network Prefix would be compromised.\n   On\
    \ the other hand, using the Mobile Network Node's address would mean\n   that\
    \ either the initiator is the Mobile Network Node itself or the\n   Mobile Router\
    \ is initiating Route Optimization on behalf of the\n   Mobile Network Node. \
    \ Initiation by the Mobile Network Node itself\n   means that the Mobile Network\
    \ Node must have new functionalities\n   implemented, while initiation by the\
    \ Mobile Router means that the\n   Mobile Router must maintain some Route Optimization\
    \ states for each\n   Mobile Network Node.\n"

  - "5.5.  How Is the Mobile Network Node's Address Bound to Location?\n   In order\
    \ for route to be optimized, it is generally necessary for the\n   Correspondent\
    \ Entity to create a binding between the address and the\n   location of the Mobile\
    \ Network Node.  This can be done in the\n   following ways:\n   o  binding the\

    \ to a sequence of upstream Mobile Routers, and\n   o  binding the address to\
    \ the location of the root Mobile Router.\n   These are described in the following\
    \ sub-sections.\n"
- title: 5.5.1.  Binding to the Location of Parent Mobile Router
  contents:
  - "5.5.1.  Binding to the Location of Parent Mobile Router\n   By binding the address\
    \ of Mobile Network Node to the location of its\n   parent Mobile Router, the\
    \ Correspondent Entity would know how to\n   reach the Mobile Network Node via\
    \ the current location of the parent\n   Mobile Router.  This can be done by:\n\
    \   o  Binding Update with Mobile Network Prefix\n      This can be viewed as\
    \ a logical extension to NEMO Basic Support,\n      where the Mobile Router would\
    \ send binding updates containing one\n      or more Mobile Network Prefix options\
    \ to the Correspondent Entity.\n      The Correspondent Entity having received\
    \ the Binding Update, can\n      then set up a bi-directional tunnel with the\
    \ Mobile Router at the\n      current Care-of Address of the Mobile Router, and\
    \ inject a route\n      to its routing table so that packets destined for addresses\
    \ in the\n      Mobile Network Prefix would be routed through the bi-directional\n\
    \      tunnel.\n      Note that in this case, the address of the Mobile Network\
    \ Node is\n      implied by the Mobile Network Prefix (see Section 5.4).\n   o\
    \  Sending Information of Parent Mobile Router\n      This involves the Mobile\
    \ Network Node sending the information of\n      its Mobile Router to the Correspondent\
    \ Entity, thus allowing the\n      Correspondent Entity to establish a binding\
    \ between the address of\n      the Mobile Network Node to the location of the\
    \ parent Mobile\n      Router.  An example of such an approach would be [11].\n\
    \   o  Mobile Router as a Proxy\n      Another approach is for the parent Mobile\
    \ Router to act as a\n      \"proxy\" for its Mobile Network Nodes.  In this case,\
    \ the Mobile\n      Router uses the standard Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization procedure\n\
    \      to bind the address of a Mobile Network Node to the Mobile\n      Router's\
    \ Care-of Address.  For instance, when the Mobile Network\n      Node is a Local\
    \ Fixed Node without Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization\n      functionality, the\
    \ Mobile Router may initiate the Return\n      Routability procedure with a Correspondent\
    \ Node on behalf of the\n      Local Fixed Node.  An example of such an approach\
    \ would be\n      [20][21][22].\n      On the other hand, if the Mobile Network\
    \ Node is a Visiting Mobile\n      Node, it might be necessary for the Visiting\
    \ Mobile Node to\n      delegate the rights of Route Optimization signaling to\
    \ the Mobile\n      Router (see [23] for an example of such delegation).  With\
    \ this\n      delegation, either the Visiting Mobile Network Node or the Mobile\n\
    \      Router can initiate the Return Routability procedure with the\n      Correspondent\
    \ Node.  For the case where the Return Routability\n      procedure is initiated\
    \ by the Visiting Mobile Node, the Mobile\n      Router will have to transparently\
    \ alter the content of the Return\n      Routability signaling messages so that\
    \ packets sent from the\n      Correspondent Node to the Visiting Node will be\
    \ routed to the\n      Care-of Address of the Mobile Router once Route Optimization\
    \ is\n      established.  The case where the Return Routability procedure is\n\
    \      initiated by the Mobile Router is similar to the case where the\n     \
    \ Mobile Network Node is a Local Fixed Node.\n   For all of the approaches listed\
    \ above, when the Mobile Network Node\n   is deeply nested within a Mobile Network,\
    \ the Correspondent Entity\n   would need to gather Binding Updates from all the\
    \ upstream Mobile\n   Routers in order to build the complete route to reach the\
    \ Mobile\n   Network Node.  This increases the complexity of the Correspondent\n\
    \   Entity, as the Correspondent Entity may need to perform multiple\n   binding\
    \ cache look-ups before it can construct the complete route.\n   Other than increasing\
    \ the complexity of the Correspondent Entity,\n   these approaches may incur extra\
    \ signaling overhead and delay for a\n   nested Mobile Network Node.  For instance,\
    \ every Mobile Router on the\n   upstream of the Mobile Network Node needs to\
    \ send Binding Updates to\n   the Correspondent Entity.  If this is done by the\
    \ upstream Mobile\n   Routers independently, it may incur additional signaling\
    \ overhead.\n   Also, since each Binding Update takes a finite amount of time\
    \ to\n   reach and be processed by the Correspondent Entity, the delay from\n\
    \   the time an optimized route is changed till the time the change is\n   registered\
    \ on the Correspondent Entity will increase proportionally\n   with the number\
    \ of Mobile Routers on the upstream of the Mobile\n   Network Node (i.e., the\
    \ level of nesting of the Mobile Network Node).\n   For \"Binding Update with\
    \ Mobile Network Prefix\" and \"Sending\n   Information of Parent Mobile Router\"\
    , new functionality is required\n   at the Correspondent Entity, whereas \"Mobile\
    \ Router as a Proxy\" keeps\n   the functionality of the Correspondent Entity\
    \ the same as a Mobile\n   IPv6 Correspondent Node.  However, this is done at\
    \ an expense of the\n   Mobile Routers, since in \"Mobile Router as a Proxy\"\
    , the Mobile\n   Router must maintain state information for every Route Optimization\n\
    \   session its Mobile Network Nodes have.  Furthermore, in some cases,\n   the\
    \ Mobile Router needs to look beyond the standard IPv6 headers for\n   ingress\
    \ and egress packets, and alter the packet contents\n   appropriately (this may\
    \ impact end-to-end integrity, see 5.8.2).\n   One advantage shared by all the\
    \ approaches listed here is that only\n   mobility protocol is affected.  In other\
    \ words, no modification is\n   required on other existing protocols (such as\
    \ Neighbor Discovery).\n   There is also no additional requirement on existing\
    \ infrastructure\n   (such as the access network).\n   In addition, having upstream\
    \ Mobile Routers send Binding Updates\n   independently means that the Correspondent\
    \ Entity can use the same\n   binding cache entries of upstream Mobile Routers\
    \ to construct the\n   complete route to two Mobile Network Nodes that have common\
    \ upstream\n   Mobile Routers.  This may translate to lower memory consumption\
    \ since\n   the Correspondent Entity need not store one complete route per Mobile\n\
    \   Network Node when it is having Route Optimization sessions with\n   multiple\
    \ Mobile Network Nodes from the same mobile network.\n"
- title: 5.5.2.  Binding to a Sequence of Upstream Mobile Routers
  contents:
  - "5.5.2.  Binding to a Sequence of Upstream Mobile Routers\n   For a nested Mobile\
    \ Network Node, it might be more worthwhile to bind\n   its address to the sequence\
    \ of points of attachment of upstream\n   Mobile Routers.  In this way, the Correspondent\
    \ Entity can build a\n   complete sequence of points of attachment from a single\
    \ transmission\n   of the binding information.  Examples using this approach are\
    \ [10]\n   and [12].\n   Different from Section 5.5.1, this approach constructs\
    \ the complete\n   route to a specific Mobile Network Node at the mobile network\
    \ side,\n   thus offering the opportunity to reduce the signaling overhead.\n\
    \   Since the complete route is conveyed to the Correspondent Entity in a\n  \
    \ single transmission, it is possible to reduce the delay from the time\n   an\
    \ optimized route is changed till the time the change is registered\n   on the\
    \ Correspondent Entity to its minimum.\n   One question that immediately comes\
    \ to mind is how the Mobile Network\n   Node gets hold of the sequence of locations\
    \ of its upstream Mobile\n   Routers.  This is usually achieved by having such\
    \ information\n   inserted as special options in the Router Advertisement messages\n\
    \   advertised by upstream Mobile Routers.  To do so, not only must a\n   Mobile\
    \ Router advertise its current location to its Mobile Network\n   Nodes, it must\
    \ also relay information embedded in Router\n   Advertisement messages it has\
    \ received from its upstream Mobile\n   Routers.  This might imply a compromise\
    \ of the mobility transparency\n   of a mobile network (see Section 4.7).  In\
    \ addition, it also means\n   that whenever an upstream Mobile Router changes\
    \ its point of\n   attachment, all downstream Mobile Network Nodes must perform\
    \ Route\n   Optimization signaling again, possibly leading to a \"Signaling Storm\"\
    \n   (see Section 4.1).\n   A different method of conveying locations of upstream\
    \ Mobile Routers\n   is (such as used in [10]) where upstream Mobile Routers insert\
    \ their\n   current point of attachment into a Reverse Routing Header embedded\n\
    \   within a packet sent by the Mobile Network Node.  This may raise\n   security\
    \ concerns that will be discussed later in Section 5.8.2.\n   In order for a Correspondent\
    \ Entity to bind the address of a Mobile\n   Network Node to a sequence of locations\
    \ of upstream Mobile Routers,\n   new functionalities need to be implemented on\
    \ the Correspondent\n   Entity.  The Correspondent Entity also needs to store\
    \ the complete\n   sequence of locations of upstream Mobile Routers for every\
    \ Mobile\n   Network Node.  This may demand more memory compared to Section 5.5.1\n\
    \   if the same Correspondent Entity has a lot of Route Optimization\n   sessions\
    \ with Mobile Network Nodes from the same nested Mobile\n   Network.  In addition,\
    \ some amount of modifications or extension to\n   existing protocols is also\
    \ required, such as a new type of IPv6\n   routing header or a new option in the\
    \ Router Advertisement message.\n"
- title: 5.5.3.  Binding to the Location of Root Mobile Router
  contents:
  - "5.5.3.  Binding to the Location of Root Mobile Router\n   A third approach is\
    \ to bind the address of the Mobile Network Node to\n   the location of the root\
    \ Mobile Router, regardless of how deeply\n   nested the Mobile Network Node is\
    \ within a nested Mobile Network.\n   Whenever the Correspondent Entity needs\
    \ to forward a packet to the\n   Mobile Network Node, it only needs to forward\
    \ the packet to this\n   point of attachment.  The mobile network will figure\
    \ out how to\n   forward the packet to the Mobile Network Node by itself.  This\
    \ kind\n   of approach can be viewed as flattening the structure of a nested\n\
    \   Mobile Network, so that it seems to the Correspondent Entity that\n   every\
    \ node in the Mobile Network is attached to the Internet at the\n   same network\
    \ segment.\n   There are various approaches to achieve this:\n   o  Prefix Delegation\n\
    \      Here, each Mobile Router in a nested mobile network is delegated a\n  \
    \    Mobile Network Prefix from the access router (such as using\n      Dynamic\
    \ Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Prefix Delegation\n      [15]).  Each Mobile\
    \ Router also autoconfigures its Care-of Address\n      from this delegated prefix.\
    \  In this way, the Care-of Addresses of\n      Mobile Routers are all from an\
    \ aggregatable address space starting\n      from the access router.  A Mobile\
    \ Network Node with Mobile IPv6\n      functionality may also autoconfigure its\
    \ Care-of Address from this\n      delegated prefix, and use standard Mobile IPv6\
    \ mechanism's to bind\n      its Home Address to this Care-of Address.\n     \
    \ Examples of this approach include [24], [25], and [26].\n      This approach\
    \ has the advantage of keeping the implementations of\n      Correspondent Nodes\
    \ unchanged.  However, it requires the access\n      router (or some other entity\
    \ within the access network) and Mobile\n      Router to possess prefix delegation\
    \ functionality, and also\n      maintain information on what prefix is delegated\
    \ to which node.\n      How to efficiently assign a subset of Mobile Network Prefix\
    \ to\n      child Mobile Routers could be an issue because Mobile Network\n  \
    \    Nodes may dynamically join and leave with an unpredictable\n      pattern.\
    \  In addition, a change in the point of attachment of the\n      root Mobile\
    \ Router will also require every nested Mobile Router\n      (and possibly Visiting\
    \ Mobile Nodes) to change their Care-of\n      Addresses and delegated prefixes.\
    \  These will cause a burst of\n      Binding Updates and prefix delegation activities\
    \ where every\n      Mobile Router and every Visiting Mobile Node start sending\
    \ Binding\n      Updates to their Correspondent Entities.\n   o  Neighbor Discovery\
    \ Proxy\n      This approach (such as [27] and [28]) achieves Route Optimization\n\
    \      by having the Mobile Router act as a Neighbor Discovery [29] proxy\n  \
    \    for its Mobile Network Nodes.  The Mobile Router will configure a\n     \
    \ Care-of Address from the network prefix advertised by its access\n      router,\
    \ and also relay this prefix to its subnets.  When a Mobile\n      Network Node\
    \ configures an address from this prefix, the Mobile\n      Router will act as\
    \ a Neighbor Discovery proxy on its behalf.  In\n      this way, the entire mobile\
    \ network and its access network form a\n      logical multilink subnet, thus\
    \ eliminating any nesting.\n      This approach has the advantage of keeping the\
    \ implementations of\n      Correspondent Nodes unchanged.  However, it requires\
    \ the root\n      Mobile Router to act as a Neighbor Discovery proxy for all the\n\
    \      Mobile Network Nodes that are directly or indirectly attached to\n    \
    \  it.  This increases the processing load of the root Mobile Router.\n      In\
    \ addition, a change in the point of attachment of the root\n      Mobile Router\
    \ will require every nested Mobile Router (and\n      possibly Visiting Mobile\
    \ Nodes) to change their Care-of Addresses.\n      Not only will this cause a\
    \ burst of Binding Updates where every\n      Mobile Router and every Visiting\
    \ Mobile Node start sending Binding\n      Updates to their Correspondent Entities,\
    \ it will also cause a\n      burst of Duplicate Address Discovery messages to\
    \ be exchanged\n      between the mobile network and the access network.  Furthermore,\n\
    \      Route Optimization for Local Fixed Nodes is not possible without\n    \
    \  new functionalities implemented on the Local Fixed Nodes.\n   o  Hierarchical\
    \ Registrations\n      Hierarchical Registration involves Mobile Network Nodes\
    \ (including\n      nested Mobile Routers) registering themselves with either\
    \ their\n      parent Mobile Routers or the root Mobile Router itself.  After\n\
    \      registrations, Mobile Network Nodes would tunnel packets directly\n   \
    \   to the upstream Mobile Router they register with.  At the root\n      Mobile\
    \ Router, packets tunneled from sub-Mobile Routers or Mobile\n      Network Nodes\
    \ are tunneled directly to the Correspondent Entities,\n      thus avoiding nested\
    \ tunneling.\n      One form of such an approach uses the principle of Hierarchical\n\
    \      Mobile IPv6 [13], where the root Mobile Router acts as a Mobility\n   \
    \   Anchor Point.  It is also possible for each parent Mobile Router\n      to\
    \ act as Mobility Anchor Points for its child Mobile Routers,\n      thus forming\
    \ a hierarchy of Mobility Anchor Points.  One can also\n      view these Mobility\
    \ Anchor Points as local Home Agents, thus\n      forming a cascade of mobile\
    \ Home Agents.  In this way, each Mobile\n      Router terminates its tunnel at\
    \ its parent Mobile Router.  Hence,\n      although there are equal numbers of\
    \ tunnels as the level of\n      nestings, there is no tunnel encapsulated within\
    \ another.\n      Examples of this approach include [30], [31], [32], and [33].\n\
    \      An advantage of this approach is that the functionalities of the\n    \
    \  Correspondent Nodes are unchanged.\n   o  Mobile Ad-Hoc Routing\n      It is\
    \ possible for nodes within a mobile network to use Mobile Ad-\n      hoc routing\
    \ for packet-forwarding between nodes in the same mobile\n      network.  An approach\
    \ of doing so might involve a router acting as\n      a gateway for connecting\
    \ nodes in the mobile network to the global\n      Internet.  All nodes in the\
    \ mobile network would configure their\n      Care-of Addresses from one or more\
    \ prefixes advertised by that\n      gateway, while their parent Mobile Routers\
    \ use Mobile Ad-hoc\n      routing to forward packets to that gateway or other\
    \ destinations\n      inside the mobile network.\n   One advantage that is common\
    \ to all the approaches listed above is\n   that local mobility of a Mobile Network\
    \ Node within a nested mobile\n   network is hidden from the Correspondent Entity.\n"
- title: 5.6.  How Is Signaling Performed?
  contents:
  - "5.6.  How Is Signaling Performed?\n   In general, Route Optimization signaling\
    \ can be done either in-plane,\n   off-plane, or both.  In-plane signaling involves\
    \ embedding signaling\n   information into headers of data packets.  A good example\
    \ of in-plane\n   signaling would be Reverse Routing Header [10].  Off-plane signaling\n\
    \   uses dedicated signaling packets rather than embedding signaling\n   information\
    \ into headers of data packets.  Proposals involving the\n   sending of Binding\
    \ Updates fall into this category.\n   The advantage of in-plane signaling is\
    \ that any change in the mobile\n   network topology can be rapidly propagated\
    \ to the Correspondent\n   Entity as long as there is a continuous stream of data\
    \ to be\n   transmitted.  However, this might incur a substantial overhead on\
    \ the\n   data packets.  Off-plane signaling, on the other hand, sends\n   signaling\
    \ messages independently from the data packet.  This has the\n   advantage of\
    \ reducing the signaling overhead in situations where\n   there are relatively\
    \ fewer topological changes to the mobile network.\n   However, data packet transmission\
    \ may be disrupted while off-plane\n   signaling takes place.\n   An entirely\
    \ different method of signaling makes use of upper-layer\n   protocols to establish\
    \ the bindings between the address of a Mobile\n   Network Node and the location\
    \ of the mobile network.  Such binding\n   information can then be passed down\
    \ to the IP layer to insert the\n   appropriate entry in the Binding Cache or\
    \ routing table.  An example\n   of such a mechanism is [34], which uses the Session\
    \ Initiation\n   Protocol (SIP) to relay binding information.\n"

  - "5.7.  How Is Data Transmitted?\n   With Route Optimization established, one remaining\
    \ question to be\n   answered is how data packets can be routed to follow the\
    \ optimized\n   route.  There are the following possible approaches:\n   o  Encapsulations\n\
    \      One way to route packets through the optimized path is to use IP-\n   \
    \   in-IP encapsulations [35].  In this way, the original packet can\n      be\
    \ tunneled to the location bound to the address of the Mobile\n      Network Node\
    \ using the normal routing infrastructure.  Depending\n      on how the location\
    \ is bound to the address of the Mobile Network\n      Node, the number of encapsulations\
    \ required might vary.\n      For instance, if the Correspondent Entity knows\
    \ the full sequence\n      of points of attachment, it might be necessary for\
    \ there to be\n      multiple encapsulations in order to forward the data packet\n\
    \      through each point of attachment.  This may lead to the need for\n    \
    \  multiple tunnels and extra packet header overhead.  It is possible\n      to\
    \ alleviate this by using Robust Header Compression techniques\n      [36][37][38]\
    \ to compress the multiple tunnel packet headers.\n   o  Routing Headers\n   \
    \   A second way to route packets through the optimized path is to use\n     \
    \ routing headers.  This is useful especially for the case where the\n      Correspondent\
    \ Entity knows the sequence of locations of upstream\n      Mobile Routers (see\
    \ Section 5.5.2), since a routing header can\n      contain multiple intermediate\
    \ destinations.  Each intermediate\n      destination corresponds to a point of\
    \ attachment bound to the\n      address of the Mobile Network Node.\n      This\
    \ requires the use of a new Routing Header type, or possibly an\n      extension\
    \ of the Type 2 Routing Header as defined by Mobile IPv6\n      to contain multiple\
    \ addresses instead of only one.\n   o  Routing Entries in Parent Mobile Routers\n\
    \      Yet another way is for parent Mobile Routers to install routing\n     \
    \ entries in their routing table that will route Route Optimized\n      packets\
    \ differently, most likely based on source address routing.\n      This usually\
    \ applies to approaches described in Section 5.5.3.\n      For instance, the Prefix\
    \ Delegation approach [24][25][26] would\n      require parent Mobile Routers\
    \ to route packets differently if the\n      source address belongs to the prefix\
    \ delegated from the access\n      network.\n"

- title: 5.8.1.  Security Considerations of Address Binding
  contents:
  - "5.8.1.  Security Considerations of Address Binding\n   The most important security\
    \ consideration in Route Optimization is\n   certainly the security risks a Correspondent\
    \ Entity is exposed to by\n   creating a binding between the address of a Mobile\
    \ Network Node and\n   the specified location(s) of the mobile network.  Generally,\
    \ it is\n   assumed that the Correspondent Entity and Mobile Network Node do not\n\
    \   share any pre-existing security association.  However, the\n   Correspondent\
    \ Entity must have some ways of verifying the\n   authenticity of the binding\
    \ specified, else it will be susceptible to\n   various attacks described in [19],\
    \ such as snooping (sending packets\n   meant for a Mobile Network Node to an\
    \ attacker) or denial-of-service\n   (DoS) (flooding a victim with packets meant\
    \ for a Mobile Network\n   Node) attacks.\n   When the binding is performed between\
    \ the address of the Mobile\n   Network Node and one Care-of Address (possibly\
    \ of the Mobile Router;\n   see Section 5.5.1 and Section 5.5.3), the standard\
    \ Return Routability\n   procedure specified in Mobile IPv6 might be sufficient\
    \ to provide a\n   reasonable degree of assurance to the Correspondent Entity.\
    \  This\n   also allows the Correspondent Entity to re-use existing\n   implementations.\
    \  But in other situations, an extension to the Return\n   Routability procedure\
    \ might be necessary.\n   For instance, consider the case where the Mobile Router\
    \ sends a\n   Binding Update containing Mobile Network Prefix information to the\n\
    \   Correspondent Entity (see Section 5.5.1).  Although the Return\n   Routability\
    \ procedure allows the Correspondent Entity to verify that\n   the Care-of and\
    \ Home Addresses of the Mobile Router are indeed\n   collocated, it does not allow\
    \ the Correspondent Entity to verify the\n   validity of the Mobile Network Prefix.\
    \  If the Correspondent Entity\n   accepts the binding without verification, it\
    \ will be exposed to\n   attacks where the attacker tricks the Correspondent Entity\
    \ into\n   forwarding packets destined for a mobile network to the attacker\n\
    \   (snooping) or victim (DoS); [39] discusses this security threat\n   further.\n\
    \   The need to verify the validity of network prefixes is not\n   constrained\
    \ to Correspondent Entities.  In approaches that involve\n   the Correspondent\
    \ Routers (see Section 5.1.3), there have been\n   suggestions for the Correspondent\
    \ Router to advertise the network\n   prefix(es) of Correspondent Nodes that the\
    \ Correspondent Router is\n   capable of terminating Route Optimization on behalf\
    \ of to Mobile\n   Network Nodes.  In such cases, the Mobile Network Nodes also\
    \ need a\n   mechanism to check the authenticity of such claims.  Even if the\n\
    \   Correspondent Routers do not advertise the network prefix, the Mobile\n  \
    \ Network Nodes also have the need to verify that the Correspondent\n   Router\
    \ is indeed a valid Correspondent Router for a given\n   Correspondent Node.\n\
    \   In Section 5.5.2, the registration signaling involves sending the\n   information\
    \ about one or more upstream Mobile Routers.  The\n   Correspondent Entity (or\
    \ Home Agent) must also have the means to\n   verify such information.  Again,\
    \ the standard Return Routability\n   procedure as defined in [3] is inadequate\
    \ here, as it is not designed\n   to verify the reachability of an address over\
    \ a series of upstream\n   routers.  An extension such as attaching a routing\
    \ header to the\n   Care-of Test (CoT) message to verify the authenticity of the\n\
    \   locations of upstream Mobile Routers is likely to be needed.  The\n   risk,\
    \ however, is not confined to Correspondent Entities.  The Mobile\n   Network\
    \ Nodes are also under the threat of receiving false\n   information from their\
    \ upstream Mobile Routers, which they might pass\n   to Correspondent Entities\
    \ (this also implies that Correspondent\n   Entities cannot rely on any security\
    \ associations they have with the\n   Mobile Network Nodes to establish the validity\
    \ of address bindings).\n   There are some considerations that this kind of on-path\
    \ threat exists\n   in the current Internet anyway especially when no (or weak)\
    \ end-to-\n   end protection is used.\n   All these concerns over the authenticity\
    \ of addresses might suggest\n   that perhaps a more radical and robust approach\
    \ is necessary.  This\n   is currently under extensive study in various Working\
    \ Groups of the\n   IETF, and many related documents might be of interest here.\
    \  For\n   instance, in Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [40], Cryptographically\n\
    \   Generated Addresses (CGAs) [41] could be used to establish the\n   ownership\
    \ of Care-of Addresses. [42] employs the Home Agent to check\n   the signaling\
    \ messages sent by Mobile Routers to provide a way for\n   Correspondent Entities\
    \ to verify the authenticity of Mobile Network\n   Prefixes specified. [18] documents\
    \ various proposed enhancements to\n   the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization mechanism\
    \ that might be applied to\n   NEMO Route Optimization as well, such as [43],\
    \ which allows the\n   Correspondent Entity to authenticate a certain operator's\
    \ Home Agent\n   by verifying the associated certificate.  The Host Identity Protocol\n\
    \   (HIP) [44] with end-host mobility considerations [45] may be extended\n  \
    \ for NEMO Route Optimization as well.\n   In addition, interested readers might\
    \ want to refer to [46], which\n   discussed the general problem of making Route\
    \ Optimization in NEMO\n   secure and explored some possible solution schemes.\
    \  There is also a\n   proposed mechanism in [23] for Mobile Network Node to delegate\
    \ some\n   rights to their Mobile Routers, which may be used to allow the Mobile\n\
    \   Routers to prove their authenticities to Correspondent Entities when\n   establishing\
    \ Route Optimization sessions on behalf of the Mobile\n   Network Nodes.\n"
- title: 5.8.2.  End-to-End Integrity
  contents:
  - "5.8.2.  End-to-End Integrity\n   In some of the approaches, such as \"Mobile\
    \ Router as a Proxy\" in\n   Section 5.5.1, the Mobile Router sends messages using\
    \ the Mobile\n   Network Node's address as the source address.  This is done mainly\
    \ to\n   achieve zero new functionalities required at the Correspondent\n   Entities\
    \ and the Mobile Network Nodes.  However, adopting such a\n   strategy may interfere\
    \ with existing or future protocols, most\n   particularly security-related protocols.\
    \  This is especially true\n   when the Mobile Router needs to make changes to\
    \ packets sent by\n   Mobile Network Nodes.  In a sense, these approaches break\
    \ the end-to-\n   end integrity of packets.  A related concern is that this kind\
    \ of\n   approach may also require the Mobile Router to inspect the packet\n \
    \  contents sent to/by Mobile Network Nodes.  This may prove to be\n   difficult\
    \ or impossible if such contents are encrypted.\n   The concern over end-to-end\
    \ integrity arises for the use of a Reverse\n   Routing Header (see Section 5.5.2)\
    \ too, since Mobile Routers would\n   insert new contents to the header of packets\
    \ sent by downstream\n   Mobile Network Nodes.  This makes it difficult for Mobile\
    \ Network\n   Nodes to protect the end-to-end integrity of such information with\n\
    \   security associations.\n"
- title: 5.8.3.  Location Privacy
  contents:
  - "5.8.3.  Location Privacy\n   Another security-related concern is the issue of\
    \ location privacy.\n   This document currently does not consider the location\
    \ privacy\n   threats caused by an on-path eavesdropper.  For more information\
    \ on\n   that aspect, please refer to [18].  Instead, we consider the\n   following\
    \ three aspects to location privacy:\n   o  Revelation of Location to Correspondent\
    \ Entity\n      Route optimization is achieved by creating a binding between the\n\
    \      address of the Mobile Network Node and the current location of the\n  \
    \    Mobile Network.  It is thus inevitable that the location of the\n      Mobile\
    \ Network Node be revealed to the Correspondent Entity.  The\n      concern may\
    \ be alleviated if the Correspondent Entity is not the\n      Correspondent Node,\
    \ since this implies that the actual traffic end\n      point (i.e., the Correspondent\
    \ Node) would remain ignorant of the\n      current location of the Mobile Network\
    \ Node.\n   o  Degree of Revelation\n      With network mobility, the degree of\
    \ location exposure varies,\n      especially when one considers nested mobile\
    \ networks.  For\n      instance, for approaches that bind the address of the\
    \ Mobile\n      Network Node to the location of the root Mobile Router (see\n\
    \      Section 5.5.3), only the topmost point of attachment of the mobile\n  \
    \    network is revealed to the Correspondent Entity.  For approaches\n      such\
    \ as those described in Section 5.5.1 and Section 5.5.2, more\n      information\
    \ (such as Mobile Network Prefixes and current locations\n      of upstream Mobile\
    \ Routers) is revealed.  Techniques such as\n      exposing only locally-scoped\
    \ addresses of intermediate upstream\n      mobile routers to Correspondent Entities\
    \ may be used to reduce the\n      degree of revelation.\n   o  Control of the\
    \ Revelation\n      When Route Optimization is initiated by the Mobile Network\
    \ Node\n      itself, it is in control of whether or not to sacrifice location\n\
    \      privacy for an optimized route.  However, if it is the Mobile\n      Router\
    \ that initiates Route Optimization (e.g., \"Binding Update\n      with Mobile\
    \ Network Prefix\" and \"Mobile Router as a Proxy\" in\n      Section 5.5.1),\
    \ then control is taken away from the Mobile Network\n      Node.  An additional\
    \ signaling mechanism between the Mobile\n      Network Node and its Mobile Router\
    \ can be used in this case to\n      prevent the Mobile Router from attempting\
    \ Route Optimization for a\n      given traffic stream.\n"
