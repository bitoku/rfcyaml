  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are two well-known approaches in deploying MPLS Traffic\n
    \  Engineering:\n   (1) The so-called \"strategic\" approach that consists of
    setting up a\n   full mesh of TE LSPs between a set of LSRs.\n   (2) The so-called
    \"tactical\" approach, where a set of TE LSPs are\n   provisioned on well-identified
    \"hot spots\" in order to alleviate a\n   congestion resulting, for instance,
    from an unexpected traffic growth\n   in some parts of the network.\n   The setup
    of a full mesh of TE LSPs among a set of LSRs is a common\n   deployment scenario
    of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth\n   optimization, bandwidth guarantees,
    or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast\n   Reroute.  Setting up a full mesh of TE LSPs
    between N LSRs requires\n   the configuration of a potentially large number of
    TE LSPs (O(N^2)).\n   Furthermore, the addition of any new LSR in the mesh requires
    the\n   configuration of N additional TE LSPs on the new LSR and one new TE\n
    \  LSP on every LSR of the existing mesh destined to this new LSR, which\n   gives
    a total of 2*N TE LSPs to be configured.  Such an operation is\n   not only time
    consuming but also risky (prone to misconfiguration)\n   for Service Providers.
    \ Hence, an automatic mechanism for setting up\n   TE LSPs meshes is desirable
    and requires the ability to automatically\n   discover the set of LSRs that belong
    to the mesh.  This document\n   specifies routing extensions so as to automatically
    discover the\n   members of a mesh, also referred to as a \"TE mesh-group\".  Note
    that\n   the mechanism(s) needed for the dynamic creation of TE LSPs is\n   implementation
    specific and outside the scope of this document.\n   Routing extensions have been
    defined in [RFC4970] and [RFC4971] in\n   order to advertise router capabilities.
    \ This document specifies IGP\n   (OSPF and IS-IS) TE Mesh Group (Type Length
    Value) TLVs allowing for\n   the automatic discovery of a TE mesh-group members,
    to be carried in\n   the OSPF Router Information (Link State Advertisement) LSA
    [RFC4970]\n   and IS-IS Router Capability TLV [RFC4971].  The routing extensions\n
    \  specified in this document provide the ability to signal multiple TE\n   mesh
    groups.  An LSR may belong to more than one TE mesh-group(s).\n   There are relatively
    tight real-time constraints on the operation of\n   IGPs (such as OSPF and IS-IS).
    \ For this reason, some care needs to\n   be applied when proposing to carry additional
    information in an IGP.\n   The information described in this document is both
    relatively small\n   in total volume (compared with other information already
    carried in\n   IGPs), and also relatively stable (i.e., changes are based on\n
    \  configuration changes, but not on dynamic events within the network,\n   or
    on dynamic triggers, such as the leaking of information from other\n   routing
    protocols or routing protocol instances).\n"

    OSPF Routing\n   Information LSA and the IS-IS TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV is carried
    within\n   the IS-IS Router capability TLV.  As such, elements of procedure are\n
    \  inherited from those defined in [RFC4970] and [RFC4971] for OSPF and\n   IS-IS
    respectively.  Specifically, a router MUST originate a new\n   LSA/LSP whenever
    the content of this information changes, or whenever\n   required by regular routing
    procedure (e.g., updates).\n   The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST NOT
    include more than one\n   of each of the IPv4 instances or the IPv6 instance.
    \ If either the\n   IPv4 or the IPv6 OSPF TE-MESH-GROUP TLV occurs more than once
    within\n   the OSPF Router Information LSA, only the first instance is\n   processed,
    subsequent TLV(s) SHOULD be silently ignored.  Similarly,\n   if either the IPv4
    or the IPv6 IS-IS TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV occurs\n   more than once within the IS-IS
    Router capability TLV, only the first\n   instance is processed, subsequent TLV(s)
    SHOULD be silently ignored.\n"

    - "5.1.  OSPF\n   The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is advertised within an OSPF Router Information\n
      \  opaque LSA (opaque type of 4, opaque ID of 0) for OSPFv2 [RFC2328]\n   and
      within a new LSA (Router Information LSA) for OSPFv3 [RFC2740].\n   The Router
      Information LSAs for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 are defined in\n   [RFC4970].\n   A router
      MUST originate a new OSPF router information LSA whenever\n   the content of
      any of the advertised TLV changes or whenever required\n   by the regular OSPF
      procedure (LSA update (every LSRefreshTime)).  If\n   an LSR desires to join
      or leave a particular TE mesh group, it MUST\n   originate a new OSPF Router
      Information LSA comprising the updated\n   TE-MESH-GROUP TLV.  In the case of
      a join, a new entry will be added\n   to the TE-MESH-GROUP TLV; conversely,
      if the LSR leaves, a mesh-group\n   the corresponding entry will be removed
      from the TE-MESH-GROUP TLV.\n   Note that both operations can be performed in
      the context of a single\n   LSA update.  An implementation SHOULD be able to
      detect any change to\n   a previously received TE-MESH-GROUP TLV from a specific
      LSR.\n   As defined in [RFC2370] for OSPVv2 and in [RFC2740] for OSPFv3, the\n
      \  flooding scope of the Router Information LSA is determined by the LSA\n   Opaque
      type for OSPFv2 and the values of the S1/S2 bits for OSPFv3.\n   For OSPFv2
      Router Information opaque LSA:\n   -  Link-local scope: type 9;\n   -  Area-local
      scope: type 10;\n   -  Routing-domain scope: type 11.  In this case, the flooding
      scope\n      is equivalent to the Type 5 LSA flooding scope.\n   For OSPFv3
      Router Information LSA:\n   -  Link-local scope: OSPFv3 Router Information LSA
      with the S1 and S2\n      bits cleared;\n   -  Area-local scope: OSPFv3 Router
      Information LSA with the S1 bit\n      set and the S2 bit cleared;\n   -  Routing-domain
      scope: OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with S1 bit\n      cleared and the S2 bit
      set.\n   A router may generate multiple OSPF Router Information LSAs with\n
      \  different flooding scopes.\n   The TE-MESH-GROUP TLV may be advertised within
      an Area-local or\n   Routing-domain scope Router Information LSA, depending
      on the MPLS TE\n   mesh group profile:\n   -  If the MPLS TE mesh-group is contained
      within a single area (all\n      the LSRs of the mesh-group are contained within
      a single area),\n      the TE-MESH-GROUP TLV MUST be generated within an Area-local\n
      \     Router Information LSA.\n   -  If the MPLS TE mesh-group spans multiple
      OSPF areas, the TE mesh-\n      group TLV MUST be generated within a Routing-domain
      scope router\n      information LSA.\n"

    - "5.2.  IS-IS\n   The TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV is advertised within the IS-IS Router\n
      \  CAPABILITY TLV defined in [RFC4971].  An IS-IS router MUST originate\n   a
      new IS-IS LSP whenever the content of any of the advertised sub-TLV\n   changes
      or whenever required by regular IS-IS procedure (LSP\n   updates).  If an LSR

      new LSP comprising the refreshed IS-IS\n   Router capability TLV comprising
      the updated TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV.\n   In the case of a join, a new entry will
      be added to the TE-MESH-GROUP\n   sub-TLV; conversely, if the LSR leaves a mesh-group,
      the\n   corresponding entry will be deleted from the TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV.\n
      \  Note that both operations can be performed in the context of a single\n   update.
      \ An implementation SHOULD be able to detect any change to a\n   previously
      received TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV from a specific LSR.\n   If the flooding scope
      of a TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV is limited to an\n   IS-IS level/area, the sub-TLV
      MUST not be leaked across level/area\n   and the S flag of the Router CAPABILITY
      TLV MUST be cleared.\n   Conversely, if the flooding scope of a TE-MESH-GROUP
      sub-TLV is the\n   entire routing domain, the TLV MUST be leaked across IS-IS\n
      \  levels/areas, and the S flag of the Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST be\n   set.
      \ In both cases, the flooding rules specified in [RFC4971] apply.\n   As specified
      in [RFC4971], a router may generate multiple IS-IS\n   Router CAPABILITY TLVs
      within an IS-IS LSP with different flooding\n   scopes.\n"

    LSR Y would not have any major impact on the\n   network (other than overloading
    the IGP), such as triggering the set\n   up of new MPLS TE LSP: indeed, for a
    new TE LSP originated by another\n   LSR X destined to LSR Y to be set up, the
    same TE Mesh group\n   membership must be configured on both LSRs.  Thus such
    fake\n   advertisement could not amplify any Denial of Service (DoS) attack.\n"
