Abstract This document is one in the series of documents that define various MIB object groups for IPv6.
Specifically, the ICMPv6 group is defined in this document.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the IPv6 based internets.
This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 definitions.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists of three major components.
They are: the SMI, described in RFC 1902
[1] the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
the MIB II, described in RFC 1213/STD 17 [3] the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1157/STD 15 [4] and RFC 1905 [5] which define two versions of the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
This document is the one in the series of documents that define various MIB object groups for IPv6.
These groups are the basic unit of conformance: if the semantics of a group is applicable to an implementation, then it must implement all objects in that group.
For example, an implementation must implement the TCP group if and only if it implements the TCP over IPv6 protocol.
At minimum, implementations must implement the IPv6 General group [9] as well as the ICMPv6 group defined in this document.
This document defines the ICMPv6 group of the IPv6 MIB.

The MIB module for entities implementing the ICMPv6."
This table contains statistics of ICMPv6 messages that are received and sourced by the entity."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
current DESCRIPTION "An ICMPv6 statistics entry containing objects at a particular IPv6 interface.
Note that a receiving interface is the interface to which a given ICMPv6 message is addressed which may not be necessarily the input interface for the message.
Similarly,  the sending interface is the interface that sources a given ICMP message which is usually but not necessarily the output interface for the message."
, ipv6IfIcmpOutGroupMembReductions Counter32 } ipv6IfIcmpInMsgs
"The total number of ICMP messages received by the interface which includes all those counted by ipv6IfIcmpInErrors.
Note that this interface is the interface to which the ICMP messages were addressed which may not be necessarily the input interface for the messages."
"The number of ICMP Time Exceeded messages received by the interface."
"The total number of ICMP messages which this interface attempted to send.
Note that this counter includes all those counted by icmpOutErrors."
"The number of ICMP messages which this interface did not send due to problems discovered within ICMP such as a lack of buffers.
This value should not include errors discovered outside the ICMP layer such as the inability of IPv6 to route the resultant datagram.
In some implementations there may be no types of error which contribute to this counter's value."
"The number of ICMP Destination Unreachable messages sent by the interface."
dest unreachable/communication administratively prohibited messages sent."
"The number of Redirect messages sent.
For a host, this object will always be zero, since hosts do not send redirects."
"The number of ICMPv6 Group Membership Query messages sent."
"The number of ICMPv6 Group Membership Reduction messages sent."
MODULE COMPLIANCE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"The compliance statement for SNMPv2 entities which implement ICMPv6."

Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered sensitive in some network environments.
Therefore, authentication of received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information should be employed in such environments.
