  - "Abstract\n   This document presents a checklist to facilitate evaluation of MIME\n\
    \   capable User Agents. Access to a MIME test-responder, that generates\n   test-messages\
    \ is described.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This document presents a checklist that facilitates evaluation\
    \ of\n   MIME capable E-mail User Agents. It is by no means a conformance or\n\
    \   interoperability (both strictly defined and measurable quantities)\n   checklist,\
    \ but rather an interworking (practical perspective)\n   checklist that is aimed\
    \ at the users and system managers.\n"
- title: Usage and submission
  contents:
  - "Usage and submission\n   If you use this checklist against a specific product\
    \ (regardless of\n   whether you're a vendor, implementor or user) you can submit\
    \ the\n   result to mime-check@relay.surfnet.nl and this information will be\n\
    \   made available (at no cost) through WWW (to be announced) for other\n   people\
    \ to browse through.\n   Although SURFnet will attempt to verify the correctness\
    \ of each\n   submission, all submitted, information is made available as is,\
    \ with\n   no guarantees (SURFnet does not take any responsibility for errors\
    \ in\n   the data that is made available, or for any damages resulting from\n\
    \   usage of that data). Users who want to procure a UA are advised to\n   use\
    \ the data as an orientation, and to perform their own procurement\n   tests (possibly\
    \ using the checklist below as a guideline). Also it is\n   noted that vendors\
    \ and implementors are encouraged to use the results\n   from the checklist to\
    \ improve their products.\n"
- title: Getting test messages
  contents:
  - "Getting test messages\n   For several tests in the checklist a test message is\
    \ required. Test\n   messages can be requested in the following way: Send mail\
    \ to <mime-\n   test@relay.surfnet.nl> with a subject field containing ONE of\
    \ the\n   following:\n   text/plain\n   text/enriched\n   image/gif\n   image/jpeg\n\
    \   audio/basic\n   video/mpeg\n   application/octet-stream\n   application/postscript\n\
    \   message/rfc822\n   message/partial\n   message/external\n   multipart/mixed\n\
    \   multipart/parallel\n   multipart/digest\n   multipart/alternative\n   application/wordperfect5.1\n\
    \   application/msword\n   application/rtf\n   X-local      <to test how your\
    \ UA deals with undefined content-types>\n   nested    <returns a message that\
    \ contains nested multipart contents>\n   iso-8859-1    <returns a message with\
    \ text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1>\n   A message containing the requested content-type\
    \ will be returned to\n   the address contained in the from field.\n"
