  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes the service mechanism for entering a delegation\n\
    \   of DNS servers that provide reverse lookup of 6to4 IPv6 addresses\n   into\
    \ the 6to4 reverse zone file.  The mechanism is based on a\n   conventional DNS\
    \ delegation service interface, allowing the service\n   client to enter the details\
    \ of a number of DNS servers for the\n   delegated domain.  In the context of\
    \ a 6to4 reverse delegation, the\n   client is primarily authenticated by its\
    \ source address used in the\n   delegation request, and is authorized to use\
    \ the function if its IPv6\n   address prefix corresponds to an address from within\
    \ the requested\n   6to4 delegation address block.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   6to4 [RFC3056] defines a mechanism for allowing isolated\
    \ IPv6 sites\n   to communicate using IPv6 over the public IPv4 Internet.  This\
    \ is\n   achieved through the use of a dedicated IPv6 global unicast address\n\
    \   prefix.  A 6to4 'router' can use its IPv4 address value in\n   conjunction\
    \ with this global prefix to create a local IPv6 site\n   prefix.  Local IPv6\
    \ hosts use this site prefix to form their local\n   IPv6 address.\n   This address\
    \ structure allows any site that is connected to the IPv4\n   Internet the ability\
    \ to use IPv6 via automatically created IPv6 over\n   IPv4 tunnels.  The advantage\
    \ of this approach is that it allows the\n   piecemeal deployment of IPv6 using\
    \ tunnels to traverse IPv4 network\n   segments.  A local site can connect to\
    \ an IPv6 network without\n   necessarily obtaining IPv6 services from its adjacent\
    \ upstream\n   network provider.\n   As noted in [6to4-dns], the advantage of\
    \ this approach is that: \"it\n   decouples deployment of IPv6 by the core of\
    \ the network (e.g.\n   Internet Service Providers or ISPs) from deployment of\
    \ IPv6 at the\n   edges (e.g. customer sites), allowing each site or ISP to deploy\
    \ IPv6\n   support in its own time frame according to its own priorities.  With\n\
    \   6to4, the edges may communicate with one another using IPv6 even if\n   one\
    \ or more of their ISPs do not yet provide native IPv6 service.\"\n   The particular\
    \ question here is the task of setting up a set of\n   delegations that allows\
    \ \"reverse lookups\" for this address space.\n      \"[This] requires that there\
    \ be a delegation path for the IP\n      address being queried, from the DNS root\
    \ to the servers for the\n      [DNS] zone which provides the PTR records for\
    \ that IP address.\n      For ordinary IPv6 addresses, the necessary DNS servers\
    \ and records\n      for IPv6 reverse lookups would be maintained by the each\n\
    \      organization to which an address block is delegated; the\n      delegation\
    \ path of DNS records reflects the delegation of address\n      blocks themselves.\
    \  However, for IPv6 addresses beginning with the\n      6to4 address prefix,\
    \ the DNS records would need to reflect IPv4\n      address delegation.  Since\
    \ the entire motivation of 6to4 is to\n      decouple site deployment of IPv6\
    \ from infrastructure deployment of\n      IPv6, such records cannot be expected\
    \ to be present for a site\n      using 6to4 - especially for a site whose ISP\
    \ did not yet support\n      IPv6 in any form.\" [6to4-dns]\n   The desired characteristics\
    \ of a reverse lookup delegation mechanism\n   are that it:\n      *  is deployable\
    \ with minimal overhead or tool development\n      *  has no impact on existing\
    \ DNS software and existing DNS\n         operations\n      *  performs name lookup\
    \ efficiently\n      *  does not compromise any DNS security functions\n"

  - "2.  Potential Approaches\n   There are a number of approaches to this problem,\
    \ ranging from a\n   conventional explicit delegation structure to various forms\
    \ of\n   modified server behaviors that attempt to guess the location of non-\n\
    \   delegated servers for fragments of this address space.  These\n   approaches\
    \ have been explored in some detail in terms of their\n   advantages and drawbacks\
    \ in [6to4-dns], so only a summary of these\n   approaches will be provided here.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Conventional Address Delegation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Conventional Address Delegation\n   The problem with this form of delegation\
    \ is the anticipated piecemeal\n   deployment of 6to4 sites.  The reason why an\
    \ end site would use 6to4\n   is commonly that the upstream Internet Service Provider\
    \ does not\n   support an IPv6 transit service and the end site is using 6to4\
    \ to\n   tunnel through to IPv6 connectivity.  A conventional end site\n   environment\
    \ of this form would have the end site using provider-based\n   IPv4 addresses,\
    \ where the end site's IPv4 address is a more specific\n   address block drawn\
    \ from the upstream provider's address block, and\n   the end site would have\
    \ an entry in the upstream provider's reverse\n   DNS zone file, or it would have\
    \ authoritative local name servers that\n   are delegated from the upstream provider's\
    \ DNS zone.  In the case of\n   the 6to4 mapped IPv6 space, the upstream may not\
    \ be providing any\n   IPv6-based services at all, and therefore would not be\
    \ expected to\n   have a 6to4 reverse DNS delegation for its IPv4 address block.\
    \  The\n   general observation is that 6to4 IPv6 reverse DNS delegations cannot\n\
    \   necessarily always precisely match the corresponding IPv4 reverse DNS\n  \
    \ delegations.\n   Sub-delegations of IPv4 provider address space are not consistently\n\
    \   recorded, and any 6to4 reverse zone operator would be required to\n   undertake\
    \ reverse zone delegations in the absence of reliable current\n   address assignment\
    \ information, undertaking a \"hop over\" of the\n   upstream provider's address\
    \ block.  Similarly, a delegated entity may\n   need to support the same \"hop\
    \ over\" when undertaking further\n   delegations in their reverse zone.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Guessing a Non-Delegated 6to4 Reverse Server
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Guessing a Non-Delegated 6to4 Reverse Server\n   One way to avoid such\
    \ unreliable delegations is to alter server\n   behavior for reverse servers in\
    \ this zone.  Where no explicit\n   delegation information exists in the zone\
    \ file, the server could look\n   up the in-addr.arpa domain for the servers for\
    \ the equivalent IPv4\n   address root used in the 6to4 address.  These servers\
    \ could then be\n   queried for the IPv6 PTR query.\n   The issues with fielding\
    \ altered server behaviors for this domain are\n   not to be taken lightly, and\
    \ the delegation chain for IPv4 will not\n   be the same for 6to4 in any case.\
    \  An isolated 6to4 site uses a\n   single IPv4 /32 address, and it is improbable\
    \ that a single address\n   would have explicit in-addr.arpa delegation.  In other\
    \ words, it is\n   not likely that the delegation for IPv4 would parallel that\
    \ of 6to4.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Locating Local Servers at Reserved Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Locating Local Servers at Reserved Addresses\n   Another approach uses\
    \ an altered server to resolve non-delegated 6to4\n   reverse queries.  The 6to4\
    \ query is decoded to recover the original\n   6to4 IP address.  The site-specific\
    \ part of the address is rewritten\n   to a constant value, and this value is\
    \ used as the target of a lookup\n   query.  This requires that a 6to4 site should\
    \ reserve local\n   addresses, and configure reverse servers on these addresses.\
    \  Again,\n   this is a weak approach in that getting the DNS to query non-\n\
    \   delegated addresses is a case of generation of spurious traffic.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Synthesized Responses
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Synthesized Responses\n   The final approach considered here is to synthesize\
    \ an answer when no\n   explicit delegation exists.  This approach would construct\
    \ a pseudo\n   host name using the IPv6 query address as the seed.  Given that\
    \ the\n   host name has no valid forward DNS mapping, then this becomes a case\n\
    \   of transforming one invalid DNS object into another.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Selecting a Reasonable Approach
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Selecting a Reasonable Approach\n   It would appear that the most reasonable\
    \ approach from this set of\n   potential candidates is to support a model of\
    \ conventional standard\n   delegation.  The consequent task is to reduce the\
    \ administrative\n   overheads in managing the zone, supporting delegation of\
    \ reverse zone\n   files on a basis of providing a delegation capability directly\
    \ to\n   each 6to4 site.\n"

  - "3.  6to4 Networks Address Use\n   A 6to4 client network is an isolated IPv6 network\

- title: 4.  Delegation Administration
  contents:
  - "4.  Delegation Administration\n   This specification uses a single delegation\
    \ level in the\n   2.0.0.2.ip6.arpa zone (the ip6.arpa zone is specified in [RFC3596]),\n\
    \   delegating zones only at the 48th bit position.  This corresponds\n   with\
    \ individual delegations related to a single /32 IPv4 address, or\n   the equivalent\
    \ of a single 6to4 local site.\n   The zone files containing the end site delegations\
    \ are to be operated\n   with a low TTL (configured to be a time value in the\
    \ scale of hours\n   rather than days or weeks), and updates for delegation requests\
    \ in\n   the 2.0.0.2.ipv6.arpa zone are to be made using dynamic DNS updates\n\
    \   [RFC2136].\n   The delegation system is to be self-driven by clients residing\
    \ within\n   6to4 networks.  The 6to4 reverse DNS delegation function is to be\n\
    \   accessible only by clients using 6to4 IPv6 source addresses, and the\n   only\
    \ delegation that can be managed is that corresponding to the /48\n   prefix of\
    \ the IPv6 source address of the client.\n   This service is to operate the delegation\
    \ management service using\n   web-based server access using Transport Layer Security\
    \ (TLS)\n   [RFC4346] (accessible via a \"https:\" URL).  This is intended to\n\
    \   ensure that the source address-driven delegation selection function\n   cannot\
    \ be disrupted through proxy caching of the web server's\n   responses, and also\
    \ to ensure that the delegation service cannot be\n   readily mimicked.\n   The\
    \ service is to be found at https://6to4.nro.net\n   This service is implemented\
    \ by web servers that are operated on a\n   dual-stack IPv4 / IPv6 server, accessible\
    \ via SSL.  The web server's\n   actions will be determined by the source address\
    \ of the client.  If\n   the client uses a 6to4 source address, the server will\
    \ present a\n   delegation interface for the corresponding 6to4 reverse zone.\n\
    \   Otherwise, the server will provide a description of the delegation\n   process.\n\
    \   When accessed by a 6to4 source address, the interface presented by\n   the\
    \ delegation service is a conventional DNS delegation interface,\n   allowing\
    \ the client to enter the details of a number of DNS servers\n   for the corresponding\
    \ reverse domain.  The targets of the DNS\n   delegation are checked by the delegation\
    \ manager using IPv4 and IPv6,\n   according to the addresses of the targets,\
    \ to ensure that they are\n   responding, that they are configured consistently,\
    \ and are\n   authoritative for the delegated domain.  If these conditions are\
    \ met,\n   the delegation details are entered into the zone at the primary\n \
    \  master.  In order to avoid the server being used as a denial of\n   service\
    \ platform, the server should throttle the number of DNS\n   delegation requests\
    \ made to any single IP address, and also throttle\n   the number of redelegation\
    \ requests for any single 6to4 zone.\n   In other cases the system provides diagnostic\
    \ information to the\n   client.\n   The benefits of this structure include a\
    \ fully automated mode of\n   operation.  The service delivery is on demand and\
    \ the system only\n   permits self-operation of the delegation function.\n   The\
    \ potential issues with this structure include:\n   o  Clients inside a 6to4 site\
    \ could alter the delegation details\n      without the knowledge of the site\
    \ administrator.  It is noted that\n      this is intended for small-scale sites.\
    \  Where there are potential\n      issues of unauthorized access to this delegation\
    \ function, the\n      local site administrator could take appropriate access\
    \ control\n      measures.\n   o  IPv4 DHCP-based 6to4 sites, or any 6to4 site\
    \ that uses\n      dynamically-assigned external IPv4 interface addresses, could\n\
    \      inherit nonsense reverse entries created by previous users of the\n   \
    \   dynamically assigned address.  In this case, the client site could\n     \
    \ request delegation of the reverse zone as required.  More\n      generally,\
    \ given the potentially for inheritance of 'stale'\n      reverse DNS information\
    \ in this context, in those cases where the\n      issues of potential inheritance\
    \ of 'stale' reverse DNS information\n      is a concern, it is recommended that\
    \ a 6to4 site either use a\n      static IPv4 address in preference to a dynamically-assigned\n\
    \      address, or ensure that the reverse delegation information is\n      updated\
    \ using the service mechanism described here upon each\n      dynamic address\
    \ assignment event.\n   o  The approach does not scale efficiently, as there is\
    \ the potential\n      that the flat zone file may grow considerably.  However,\
    \ it is\n      noted that 6to4 is intended to be a transition mechanism useful\n\
    \      for a limited period of time in a limited context of an isolated\n    \
    \  network where other forms of a tunnelled connection is not\n      feasible.\
    \  It is envisaged that at some point the density of IPv6\n      adoption in stub\
    \ network would provide adequate drivers for\n      widespread adoption of native\
    \ IPv6 services, obviating the need\n      for continued scaling of 6to4 support\
    \ services.  An estimate of\n      the upper bound of the size of the 6to4 reverse\
    \ delegation zone\n      would be of the order of millions of entries.  It is\
    \ also noted\n      that the value of a reverse delegation is a questionable\n\
    \      proposition and many deployment environments have no form of\n      reverse\
    \ delegation.\n   o  It is also conceivable that an enterprise network could decide\
    \ to\n      use 6to4 internally in some form of private context, with the\n  \
    \    hosts only visible in internal DNS servers.  In this mechanism the\n    \
    \  reverse delegation, if desired, would need to be implemented in an\n      internal\
    \ private (non-delegated) corresponding zone of the 6to4\n      reverse domain\
    \ space.\n   There may be circumstances where an IPv4 address controller wishes\
    \ to\n   \"block\" the ability for users of these addresses to use this 6to4\n\
    \   scheme.  Scenarios that would motivate this concern would include\n   situations\
    \ when the IPv4 provider is also offering an IPv6 service,\n   and native IPv6\
    \ should be deployed instead of 6to4.  In such\n   circumstances the 6to4 reverse\
    \ zone operator should allow for such a\n   6to4 reverse delegation blocking function\
    \ upon application to the\n   delegation zone operator.\n   For a delegation to\
    \ be undertaken the following conditions should\n   hold:\n   o  The 6to4 site\
    \ must have configured a minimum of one primary and\n      one secondary server\
    \ for the 6to4 IPv6 reverse address zone.\n   o  At the time of the delegation\
    \ request, the primary and secondary\n      servers must be online, reachable,\
    \ correctly configured, and in a\n      mutually consistent state with respect\
    \ to the 6to4 reverse zone.\n      In this context, \"mutually consistent\" implies\
    \ the same SOA RR and\n      identical NS RRSets.\n   o  The 6to4 reverse delegation\
    \ service will only accept delegation\n      requests associated with the 6to4\
    \ source address of the requesting\n      client.\n   The approach described here,\
    \ of a fully automated system driven by\n   the site administrators of the 6to4\
    \ client networks, appears to\n   represent an appropriate match of the operational\
    \ requirements of\n   managing reverse DNS domains for 6to4 addresses.\n   For\
    \ maintenance of the reverse delegation zones the service maintains\n   an email\
    \ contact point for each active delegation, derived from the\n   zone's SOA contact\
    \ address (SOA RNAME), or explicitly entered in the\n   delegation interface.\
    \  This contact point would be informed upon any\n   subsequent change of delegation\
    \ details.\n   The 6to4 reverse DNS management system also undertakes a periodic\n\
    \   sweep of all active delegations, so that each delegation is checked\n   every\
    \ 30 days.  If the delegation fails this integrity check the\n   email contact\
    \ point is informed of the problem, and a further check\n   is scheduled for 14\
    \ days later.  If this second check fails, the\n   delegation is automatically\
    \ removed, and a further notice is issued\n   to the contact point.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This system offers a rudimentary level of assurance\
    \ in attempting to\n   ensure that delegation requests from a 6to4 site can only\
    \ direct the\n   delegation of the corresponding 6to4 reverse DNS domain and no\
    \ other.\n   Address-based authentication is not a very robust method from a\n\
    \   security perspective, as addresses can be readily spoofed.\n   Accordingly,\
    \ reverse delegation information does not provide reliable\n   information in\
    \ either validating a domain name or in validating an IP\n   address, and no conclusions\
    \ should be drawn from the presence or\n   otherwise of a reverse DNS mapping\
    \ for any IP address.\n   The service management interface allows a 6to4 client\
    \ to insert any\n   server name as a DNS server, potentially directing the delegation\n\
    \   test system to make a DNS query to any nominated system.  The server\n   throttles\
    \ the number of requests made to any single IP address to\n   mitigate the attendant\
    \ risk of a high volume of bogus DNS queries\n   being generated by the server.\
    \  For similar reasons, the server also\n   throttles the number of redelegation\

    \   appropriate access control measures to prevent clients inside a 6to4\n   site\

    \ in the form of a firewall configuration, regarding control of\n   access to\
