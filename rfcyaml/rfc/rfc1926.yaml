- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This RFC describes a method of encapsulating IP datagrams on top\
    \ of\n   Acoustical Transmission Media (ATM).  This is a non-recommended\n   standard.\
    \  Distribution of this memo is unnecessary.\n"
- title: Overview
  contents:
  - "Overview\n   The modern laptop computer of today often contains the hardware\n\
    \   needed to perform wireless communications by using Acoustical\n   Transmission\
    \ Media, i.e. sound waves.  Until this moment there has\n   been no standard on\
    \ how to run IP on such media.  This document is an\n   attempt to fill this silence.\n"

  - "Frame transmission\n   The IP datagram is divided into four-bit chunks, in network\
    \ beep\n   order, and converted to characters according to the table below.  A\n\
    \   single \"b\" character is prepended as a frame start signal, the\n   characters\
    \ are then transmitted in ordinary morse code by modulating\n   a steady tone\
    \ on and off.  The frequency of this tone is also known\n   as the Acoustical\
    \ Signature (AS number) of the sender.\n        Bits    Character       Bits \
