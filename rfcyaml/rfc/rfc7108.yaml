  - "Abstract\n   Anycast is a deployment technique commonly employed for\n   authoritative-only\
    \ servers in the Domain Name System (DNS).  L-Root,\n   one of the thirteen root\

    \ to inside\n   knowledge about where and how such infrastructure has been deployed.\n\
    \   Motivations for performing such measurement exercises include\n   operational\
    \ troubleshooting and infrastructure risk assessment.  In\n   the specific case\
    \ of L-Root, the ability to measure and map anycast\n   infrastructure using the\
    \ techniques mentioned in this document is\n   provided for reasons of operational\

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and\
    \ [RFC1035].\n   L-Root, one of the thirteen root servers, is deployed using anycast\n\
    \   [RFC4786]; its service addresses, published in the A and AAAA\n   Resource\
    \ Record (RR) Sets for \"L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET\", are made\n   available from a substantial\
    \ number of semi-autonomous servers\n   deployed throughout the Internet.  A list\
    \ of locations served by\n   L-Root can be found at [ROOT-SERVERS].\n   Various\
    \ techniques have been used to map deployed anycast\n   infrastructure externally,\
    \ i.e., without reference to inside\n   knowledge about where and how such infrastructure\
    \ has been deployed.\n   Motivations for performing such measurement exercises\
    \ include\n   operational troubleshooting and infrastructure risk assessment.\
    \  In\n   the specific case of L-Root, the ability to measure and map anycast\n\
    \   infrastructure using the techniques mentioned in this document is\n   provided\
    \ for reasons of operational transparency.\n   This document describes all facilities\
    \ currently provided at L-Root\n   to aid node identification.\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   This document contains several examples\
    \ of commands typed at a Unix\n   (or Unix-like) command line to illustrate use\
    \ of the various\n   mechanisms available to identify L-Root nodes.  Such examples\
    \ are\n   presented in this document with lines typed by the user preceded by\n\
    \   the \"%\" prompt character; a bare \"%\" character indicates the end of\n\
    \   the output resulting from the command.\n   In some cases, the output shown\
    \ in examples is too long to be\n   represented directly in the text.  In those\
    \ cases, a backslash\n   character (\"\\\") is used to indicate continuation.\n"
- title: 3.  Naming Scheme for L-Root Nodes
  contents:
  - "3.  Naming Scheme for L-Root Nodes\n   Individual L-Root nodes have structured\
    \ hostnames that are\n   constructed as follows:\n      <IATA Code><NN>.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG\n\
    \   where\n   o  <IATA Code> is chosen from the list of three-character airport\n\
    \      codes published by the International Air Transport Association\n      (IATA)\
    \ in the IATA Airline Coding Directory [ACD]; and\n   o  <NN> is a two-digit numeric\
    \ code used to distinguish between two\n      different nodes in the vicinity\
    \ of the same airport.\n   Where multiple airports exist in the vicinity of a\
    \ single L-Root\n   node, one is arbitrarily chosen.\n   More granular location\
    \ data published for L-Root nodes (e.g., see\n   Section 4.4) is derived from\
    \ the location of the airport, not the\n   actual location of the node.\n"
- title: 4.  Identification of L-Root Nodes
  contents:
  - "4.  Identification of L-Root Nodes\n   L-Root service is provided using a single\
    \ IPv4 address (199.7.83.42)\n   and a single IPv6 address (2001:500:3::42). \
    \ Note that it is\n   preferable to refer to the service using its DNS name (L.ROOT-\n\
    \   SERVERS.NET) rather than literal addresses, since addresses can\n   change\
    \ from time to time.\n   At the time of writing, there are 273 separate name server\
    \ elements\n   (\"nodes\") deployed in 143 locations: together, these nodes provide\n\
    \   L-Root service.  A DNS query sent to an L-Root service address will\n   be\
    \ routed towards exactly one of those nodes for processing, and the\n   corresponding\
    \ DNS response will be originated from the same node.\n   Queries from different\
    \ clients may be routed to different nodes.\n   Successive queries from the same\
    \ client may also be routed to\n   different nodes.\n   The following sections\
    \ provide a summary of all mechanisms provided\n   by L-Root to allow a client\
    \ to identify which L-Root node is being\n   used.\n   Using HOSTNAME.BIND/CH/TXT\
    \ (Section 4.2), ID.SERVER/CH/TXT\n   (Section 4.3), or IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT\
    \ or IDENTITY.L\n   .ROOT-SERVERS/IN/A (Section 4.4) to identify a node for the\
    \ purposes\n   of reporting a problem is frequently reasonable, but it should\
    \ be\n   acknowledged that there is potential for re-routing between\n   successive\
    \ queries: an observed problem might relate to one node,\n   whilst a subsequent\
    \ query using one of those three techniques could\n   be answered by a different\
    \ node.  Use of the Name Server Identifier\n   (NSID) option on the precise queries\
    \ that yield problematic responses\n   can obviate this possibility (see Section\
    \ 4.1).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Use of NSID
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Use of NSID\n   L-Root supports the use of the Name Server Identifier (NSID)\
    \ option\n   [RFC5001] to return the identity of an L-Root node along with the\n\
    \   response to a DNS query.  The NSID payload of such responses is the\n   fully\
    \ qualified hostname of the responding L-Root node.\n   The NSID option allows\
    \ the identification of a node sending a\n   specific, requested response to the\
    \ client.  This is of particular\n   use if (for example) there is a desire to\
    \ identify unequivocally what\n   node is responding with a particularly troublesome\
    \ response; the\n   output of the diagnostic tool \"dig\" with NSID requested\
    \ provides the\n   problem response with the node identification, and its output\
    \ in that\n   case could form the basis of a useful trouble report.\n   NSID is\
    \ specified as an EDNS(0) option [RFC6891].  Clients that do\n   not support EDNS(0)\
    \ signaling (or depend on other systems that do not\n   support EDNS0) may find\
    \ this mechanism unavailable.\n   The NSID option can be specified using the widely\
    \ used diagnostic\n   tool \"dig\" using the \"+nsid\" option, as shown below.\

- title: 4.4.  Use of IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT and .../IN/A
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Use of IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT and .../IN/A\n   The operator\
    \ of L-Root has distributed a separate DNS service in\n   parallel with L-Root,\
    \ operating on precisely the same set of nodes\n   but listening on addresses\
    \ that are different from the L-Root service\n   addresses.  Measurements of this\
    \ separate service should give results\n   that are representative of L-Root.\
    \  Further discussion of this\n   service can be found in Section 5.\n   The fully\
    \ qualified DNS name IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG (note the\n   use of ORG, not\
    \ NET) has associated TXT and A RR Sets that are unique\n   to the responding\
    \ node.  Clients are hence able to issue queries for\n   IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/A\
    \ and IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/\n   TXT and use the results both to identify\
    \ individual nodes and to\n   distinguish between responses generated by different\
    \ nodes.\n   The TXT record returned in the response to such queries is structured\n\
    \   as follows:\n   1.  The fully qualified hostname of the node responding to\
    \ the query;\n   2.  The city in which the node is located;\n   3.  The region\
    \ in which the node is located, if applicable;\n   4.  The economy in which the\
    \ node is located (in most cases, the name\n       of a country); and\n   5. \
    \ The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)\n       region\
    \ in which the node is located.  A list of ICANN regions at\n       the time of\
    \ writing can be found at <http://meetings.icann.org/\n       regions>.\n   The\
    \ A record returned in the response to such queries is guaranteed\n   to be unique\
    \ to the responding node.  The A RRType was chosen in an\n   effort to make the\
    \ use of this mechanism as widely available to\n   client environments as possible,\
    \ and the ability to map a hostname to\n   an IPv4 address seemed more likely\
    \ to be widespread than the mapping\n   of a hostname to any other value.  It\
    \ should be noted that the\n   availability of this mechanism to any particular\
    \ client is orthogonal\n   to the local availability of IPv4 or IPv6 transport.\n\
    \   In this case, because identity data is published using IN-class\n   resource\
    \ records, it is not necessary to send queries directly\n   towards L-Root in\
    \ order to obtain results.  Responses can be obtained\n   through recursive servers,\
    \ the responses in those cases being the\n   identity of L-Root as observed through\
    \ the recursive server used\n   rather than the \"closest\" L-Root node to the\
    \ client.  This\n   facilitates some degree of remote troubleshooting, since a\
    \ query for\n   IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT or IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/\n\
    \   A directed a remote recursive resolver can help illustrate which\n   L-Root\
    \ node is being used by that server (or was used when the cache\n   was populated).\n\
    \   A related caching effect is that responses to IDENTITY.L.ROOT-\n   SERVERS.ORG/IN/A\
    \ and IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/TXT may be cached\n   at different times,\
    \ and may hence persist in a cache for overlapping\n   periods of time.  One possible\
    \ visible effect is that the responses\n   to IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/A\
    \ and IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/\n   IN/TXT as presented from a cache may appear\
    \ to be incoherent (i.e.,\n   refer to different nodes) despite queries against\
    \ of the cache\n   happening (near) simultaneously.  Caches may also discard the\n\
    \   published Times to Live (TTLs) in responses from the authoritative\n   server\
    \ and replace them with longer TTLs, as a matter of local\n   policy.  Interpretation\
    \ of responses for these queries from caches\n   should therefore be carried out\
    \ with these possible effects in mind.\n   It has been observed that IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG/IN/A\
    \ queries\n   offer a useful mechanism for troubleshooting DNS problems with non-\n\
    \   technical users, since such users can often be walked through the\n   process\
    \ of looking up an A record (e.g., as a side effect of\n   utilities such as ping)\
    \ far easier than they can be instructed on how\n   to use DNS-specific tools\
    \ such as dig.\n  % dig IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG TXT +short\n  \"ytz01.l.root-servers.org\"\

- title: 5.  Provisioning of IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG
  contents:
  - "5.  Provisioning of IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG\n   Individual L-Root nodes run\
    \ a dedicated, separate authority-only DNS\n   server process that serves the\
    \ IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone.  The\n   contents of that zone are unique\
    \ to every node; hence, each\n   responding node will generate a node-specific\
    \ response.\n   The contents of the IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone are hence\n\
    \   deliberately incoherent, the apparent zone contents depending on the\n   node\
    \ responding to the corresponding query.\n   The IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone\
    \ is delegated to the single name\n   server BEACON.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG, numbered\
    \ on IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\n   that are covered by the same routing advertisements\
    \ that cover the\n   L-Root service addresses.  Reachability of BEACON.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG\n\
    \   is hence well-aligned with the reachability of L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET;\n   therefore,\
    \ measurement of the IDENTITY service ought to give similar\n   results to measurement\
    \ of the L-Root service.\n   It is considered best practice always to delegate\
    \ a DNS zone to more\n   than one name server [RFC2182]; however, as described,\
    \ the IDENTITY.L\n   .ROOT-SERVERS.ORG zone is delegated to just one server. \
    \ Ordinarily,\n   this would present a risk of failure if that single server is\
    \ not\n   available; however, given the purpose of the delegation in this case\n\
    \   and that the expected mitigation of a failure in a single node is the\n  \
    \ routing of a query to a different node, delegation to a single server\n   in\
    \ this particular use-case is effective.\n   At the time of writing, the ROOT-SERVERS.ORG\
    \ zone is not signed with\n   DNSSEC.  When DNSSEC is deployed in that zone, the\
    \ L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG\n   zone will also be signed.  This will facilitate secure\
    \ responses for\n   queries for BEACON.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG and NODES.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG.\n\
    \   Secure responses for IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG are unlikely to\n   become\
    \ available even with the deployment of DNSSEC in the parent,\n   since the implementation\
    \ of the IDENTITY.L.ROOT-SERVERS.ORG service\n   involves widely distributed static\

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Some operators of anycast services choose not\
    \ to disclose locations\n   (or even numbers) of nodes, citing security concerns.\
    \  The operator\n   of L-Root considers that none of the published information\
    \ described\n   in this document is truly secret, since any service element that\n\
    \   provides service to the Internet can never truly be obscured from\n   view.\
    \  Given that location information can be found regardless of any\n   conscious,\
    \ deliberate disclosure, and since easy access to this\n   information has diagnostic\
    \ value, the operator of L-Root has adopted\n   a policy of operational transparency.\n\
    \   The information presented in this document presents no new threat to\n   the\
    \ Internet.\n"

  - "7.  Acknowledgements\n   The aspects of the L-Root service that were deployed\
    \ to facilitate\n   IN-class mapping were discussed and implemented as part of\
    \ an\n   informal collaboration with Xun Fan, John Heidemann, and Ramesh\n   Govidan,\
    \ whose contributions are acknowledged.  The motivation to\n   facilitate mapping\
    \ of L-Root as an anycast service using IN-class\n   queries was inspired by [Fan2013].\n\
    \   Helpful reviews and comments from Gaurab Upadhaya, Hugo Salgado,\n   Brian\
    \ Dixon, Bob Harold, Paul Hoffman, Jakob Schlyter, Andrew\n   Sullivan, Bruce\
    \ Campbell, S. Moonesamy, and Stephane Bortzmeyer on\n   earlier versions of this\
    \ document were very much appreciated.\n"
