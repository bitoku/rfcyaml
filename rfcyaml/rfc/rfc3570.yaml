  - "1.  Introduction\n   In [1], the concept of a \"content network\" is introduced\
    \ and\n   described.  In addition to describing some general types of content\n\
    \   networks, it also describes motivations for allowing content networks\n  \
    \ to interconnect (defined as \"content internetworking\").\n   In describing\
    \ content internetworking as a technology targeted for\n   use in production networks,\
    \ it's useful to provide examples of the\n   sequence of events that may occur\
    \ when two content networks decide to\n   interconnect.  Naturally, different\
    \ types of content networks may be\n   created due to different business motivations,\
    \ and so many\n   combinations are likely.\n   This document first provides detailed\
    \ examples of special cases of\n   content networks that are specifically designed\
    \ to participate in\n   content internetworking (Section 2).  We then discuss\
    \ the steps that\n   would be taken in order to \"bring up\" or \"tear down\"\
    \ a content\n   internetworking arrangement (Section 3).  Next we provide some\n\
    \   detailed examples of how content networks (such as those from Section\n  \
    \ 2) could interconnect (Section 4).  Finally, we describe any security\n   considerations\
    \ that arise specifically from the examples presented\n   here (Section 5).\n\
    \   The scenarios presented here answer two distinct needs:\n   1. To provide\
    \ some concrete examples of what content internetworking\n      is, and\n   2.\
    \ To provide a basis for evaluating content internetworking\n      proposals.\n\
    \   A number of content internetworking systems have been implemented,\n   but\
    \ there are few published descriptions. One such description is\n   [2].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   Terms in ALL CAPS are defined in [1] except for the following\
    \ terms\n   defined below in this document: PCN, BCN, and LCN.  Additionally,\
    \ the\n   term SLA is used as an abbreviation for Service Level Agreement.\n"
- title: 2.  Special Cases of Content Networks
  contents:
  - "2.  Special Cases of Content Networks\n   A CN may have REQUEST-ROUTING, DISTRIBUTION,\
    \ and ACCOUNTING\n   interfaces.  However, some participating networks may gravitate\n\
    \   toward particular subsets of the CONTENT INTERNETWORKING interfaces.\n   Others\
    \ may be seen differently in terms of how they relate to their\n   CLIENT bases.\
    \  This section describes these refined cases of the\n   general CN case so they\
    \ may be available for easier reference in the\n   further development of CONTENT\
    \ INTERNETWORKING scenarios.  The\n   special cases described are the Publishing\
    \ Content Network, the\n   Brokering Content Network, and the Local Request-Routing\
    \ Content\n   Network.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Publishing Content Network
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Publishing Content Network\n   A Publishing Content Network (PCN), maintained\
    \ by a PUBLISHER,\n   contains an ORIGIN and has a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with\
    \ two or more\n   CNs.  A PCN may contain SURROGATES for the benefit of serving\
    \ some\n   CONTENT REQUESTS locally, but does not intend to allow its SURROGATES\n\
    \   to serve CONTENT on behalf of other PUBLISHERS.\n   Several implications follow\
    \ from knowing that a particular CN is a\n   PCN.  First, the PCN contains the\
    \ AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING\n   SYSTEM for the PUBLISHER's CONTENT.  This\
    \ arrangement allows the\n   PUBLISHER to determine the distribution of CONTENT\
    \ REQUESTS among\n   ENLISTED CNs.  Second, it implies that the PCN need only\
    \ participate\n   in a subset of CONTENT INTERNETWORKING.  For example, a PCN's\n\
    \   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM need only be able to receive\n   DISTRIBUTION\
    \ ADVERTISEMENTS, it need not send them.  Similarly, a\n   PCN's REQUEST-ROUTING\
    \ INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM has no reason to send\n   AREA ADVERTISEMENTS.  Finally,\
    \ a PCN's ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING\n   SYSTEM need only be able to receive ACCOUNTING\
    \ data, it need not send\n   it.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Brokering Content Network
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Brokering Content Network\n   A Brokering Content Network (BCN) is a network\
    \ that does not operate\n   its own SURROGATES.  Instead, a BCN operates only\
    \ CIGs as a service\n   on behalf other CNs.  A BCN may therefore be regarded\
    \ as a\n   \"clearinghouse\" for CONTENT INTERNETWORKING information.\n   For\
    \ example, a BCN may choose to participate in DISTRIBUTION\n   INTERNETWORKING\
    \ and/or REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING in order to\n   aggregate ADVERTISEMENTS\
    \ from one set of CNs into a single update\n   stream for the benefit of other\
    \ CNs.  To name a single specific\n   example, a BCN could aggregate CONTENT SIGNALS\
    \ from CNs that\n   represent PUBLISHERS into a single update stream for the benefit\
    \ of\n   CNs that contain SURROGATES.  A BCN may also choose to participate in\n\
    \   ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING in order to aggregate utilization data\n   from\
    \ several CNs into combined reports for CNs that represent\n   PUBLISHERS.\n \
    \  This definition of a BCN implies that a BCN's CIGs would implement\n   the\
    \ sending and/or receiving of any combination of ADVERTISEMENTS and\n   ACCOUNTING\
    \ data as is necessary to provide desired services to other\n   CONTENT NETWORKS.\
    \  For example, if a BCN is only interested in\n   aggregating ACCOUNTING data\
    \ on behalf of other CNs, it would only\n   need to have an ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING\
    \ interface on its CIGs.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Local Request-Routing Content Network
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Local Request-Routing Content Network\n   Another type of CN is the Local\
    \ Request-Routing CONTENT NETWORK\n   (LCN).  An LCN is defined as a type of network\
    \ where CLIENTS' CONTENT\n   REQUESTS are always handled by some local SERVER\
    \ (such as a caching\n   proxy [1]).  In this context, \"local\" is taken to mean\
    \ that both the\n   CLIENT and SERVER are within the same administrative domain,\
    \ and\n   there is an administrative motivation for forcing the local mapping.\n\
    \   This type of arrangement is common in enterprises where all CONTENT\n   REQUESTS\
    \ must be directed through a local SERVER for access control\n   purposes.\n \
    \  As implied by the name, the LCN creates an exception to the rule that\n   there\
    \ is a single AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM for a\n   particular item of\
    \ CONTENT.  By directing CONTENT REQUESTS through\n   the local SERVER, CONTENT\
    \ RESPONSES may be given to CLIENTS without\n   first referring to the AUTHORITATIVE\
    \ REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM.  Knowing\n   this to be true, other CNs may seek a NEGOTIATED\
    \ RELATIONSHIP with an\n   LCN in order to perform DISTRIBUTION into the LCN and\
    \ receive\n   ACCOUNTING data from it.  Note that once SERVERS participate in\n\
    \   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING and ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING, they\n   effectively\
    \ take on the role of SURROGATES.  However, an LCN would\n   not intend to allow\
    \ its SURROGATES to be accessed by non-local\n   CLIENTS.\n   This set of assumptions\
    \ implies multiple things about the LCN's\n   CONTENT INTERNETWORKING relationships.\
    \  First, it is implied that the\n   LCN's DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM\
    \ need only be able to send\n   DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS, it need not receive\
    \ them.  Second, it is\n   implied that an LCN's ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM\
    \ need only be\n   able to send ACCOUNTING data, it need not receive it.  Finally,\
    \ due\n   to the locally defined REQUEST-ROUTING, the LCN would not participate\n\
    \   in REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING.\n"
- title: 3.  Content Internetworking Arrangements
  contents:
  - "3.  Content Internetworking Arrangements\n   When the controlling interests of\
    \ two CNs decide to interconnect\n   their respective networks (such as for business\
    \ reasons), it is\n   expected that multiple steps would need to occur.\n   The\
    \ first step would be the creation of a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP.\n   This relationship\
    \ would most likely take the form of a legal document\n   that describes the services\
    \ to be provided, cost of services, SLAs,\n   and other stipulations.  For example,\
    \ if an ORIGINATING CN wished to\n   leverage another CN's reach into a particular\
    \ country, this would be\n   laid out in the NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP.\n   The\
    \ next step would be to configure CONTENT INTERNETWORKING protocols\n   on the\
    \ CIGs of the respective CNs in order to technically support the\n   terms of\
    \ the NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP.  To follow our previous\n   example, this could\
    \ include the configuration of the ENLISTED CN's\n   CIGs in a particular country\
    \ to send DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS to\n   the CIGs of the ORIGINATING CN. \
    \ In order to configure these\n   protocols, technical details (such as CIG addresses/hostnames\
    \ and\n   authentication information) would be exchanged by administrators of\n\
    \   the respective CNs.\n   Note also that some terms of the NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP\
    \ would be\n   upheld through means outside the scope of CDI protocols.  These\
    \ could\n   include non-technical terms (such as financial settlement) or other\n\
    \   technical terms (such as SLAs).\n   In the event that the controlling interests\
    \ of two CNs no longer wish\n   to have their networks interconnected, it is expected\
    \ that these\n   tasks would be undone.  That is, the protocol configurations\
    \ would be\n   changed to cease the movement of ADVERTISEMENTS and/or ACCOUNTING\n\
    \   data between the networks, and the NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP would be\n   legally\
    \ terminated.\n"
- title: 4.  Content Internetworking Scenarios
  contents:
  - "4.  Content Internetworking Scenarios\n   This section provides several scenarios\
    \ that may arise in CONTENT\n   INTERNETWORKING implementations.\n   Note that\
    \ we obviously cannot examine every single permutation.\n   Specifically, it should\
    \ be noted that:\n   o  Any one of the interconnected CNs may have other CONTENT\n\
    \      INTERNETWORKING arrangements that may or may not be transitive to\n   \
    \   the relationships being described in the diagram.\n   o  The graphical figures\
    \ do not illustrate the CONTENT REQUEST paths.\n      It is assumed that a REQUEST-ROUTING\
    \ SYSTEM eventually returns to\n      the CLIENT the IP address of the SURROGATE\
    \ deemed appropriate to\n      honor the CLIENT's CONTENT REQUEST.\n   The scenarios\
    \ described include a general case, two cases in which\n   BCNs provide limited\
    \ interfaces, a case in which a PCN enlists the\n   services of multiple CNs,\
    \ and a case in which multiple CNs enlist the\n   services of an LCN.\n"
- title: 4.1.  General Content Internetworking
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Content Internetworking\n   This scenario considers the general\
    \ case where two or more existing\n   CNs wish to establish a CONTENT INTERNETWORKING\
    \ relationship in order\n   to provide increased scale and reach for their existing\
    \ customers.\n   It assumes that all of these CNs already provide REQUEST-ROUTING,\n\
    \   DISTRIBUTION, and ACCOUNTING services and that they will continue to\n   provide\
    \ these services to existing customers as well as offering them\n   to other CNs.\n\
    \   In this scenario, these CNs would interconnect with others via a CIG\n   that\
    \ provides a REQUEST-ROUTING INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM, a\n   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING\
    \ SYSTEM, and an ACCOUNTING\n   INTERNETWORKING SYSTEM.  The net result of this\
    \ interconnection would\n   be that a larger set of SURROGATES will now be available\
    \ to the\n   CLIENTS.\n   Figure 1 shows three CNs which have interconnected to\
    \ provide greater\n   scale and reach to their existing customers.  They are all\n\
    \   participating in DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING, REQUEST-ROUTING\n   INTERNETWORKING,\
    \ and ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING.\n   As a result of the NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIPS\
    \ it is assumed that:\n   1. CONTENT that has been INJECTED into any one of these\
    \ ORIGINATING\n      CNs may be distributed into any other ENLISTED CN.\n   2.\
    \ Commands affecting the DISTRIBUTION of CONTENT may be issued\n      within the\
    \ ORIGINATING CN, or may also be issued within the\n      ENLISTED CN.  The latter\
    \ case allows local decisions to be made\n      about DISTRIBUTION within the\
    \ ENLISTED CN, but such commands would\n      not control DISTRIBUTION within\
    \ the ORIGINATING CN.\n   3. ACCOUNTING information regarding CLIENT access and/or\
    \ DISTRIBUTION\n      actions will be made available to the ORIGINATING CN by\
    \ the\n      ENLISTED CN.\n   4. The ORIGINATING CN would provide this ACCOUNTING\
    \ information to\n      the PUBLISHER based on existing Service Level Agreements\
    \ (SLAs).\n   5. CONTENT REQUESTS by CLIENTS may be directed to SURROGATES within\n\
    \      any of the ENLISTED CNs.\n   The decision of where to direct an individual\
    \ CONTENT REQUEST may be\n   dependent upon the DISTRIBUTION and REQUEST-ROUTING\
    \ policies\n   associated with the CONTENT being requested as well as the specific\n\
    \   algorithms and methods used for directing these requests.  For\n   example,\
    \ a REQUEST-ROUTING policy for a piece of CONTENT may indicate\n   multiple versions\
    \ exist based on the spoken language of a CLIENT.\n   Therefore, the REQUEST-ROUTING\
    \ SYSTEM of an ENLISTED CN would likely\n   direct a CONTENT REQUEST to a SURROGATE\
    \ known to be holding a version\n   of CONTENT of a language that matches that\
    \ of a CLIENT.\n              Figure 1 - General CONTENT INTERNETWORKING\n   +--------------+\

  - "4.2.  BCN providing ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING and REQUEST-ROUTING\n      INTERNETWORKING\n\
    \   This scenario describes the case where a single entity (BCN A)\n   performs\
    \ ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING and REQUEST-ROUTING\n   INTERNETWORKING functions,\
    \ but has no inherent DISTRIBUTION or\n   DELIVERY capabilities.  A potential\
    \ configuration which illustrates\n   this concept is given in Figure 2.\n   In\
    \ the scenario shown in Figure 2, BCN A is responsible for\n   collecting ACCOUNTING\
    \ information from multiple CONTENT NETWORKS (CN\n   A and CN B) to provide a\
    \ clearinghouse/settlement function, as well\n   as providing a REQUEST-ROUTING\
    \ service for CN A and CN B.\n   In this scenario, CONTENT is injected into either\
    \ CN A or CN B and\n   its DISTRIBUTION between these CNs is controlled via the\
    \ DISTRIBUTION\n   INTERNETWORKING SYSTEMS within the CIGs.  The REQUEST-ROUTING\
    \ SYSTEM\n   provided by BCN A is informed of the ability to serve a piece of\n\

  - "4.4.  PCN ENLISTS multiple CNs\n   In the previously enumerated scenarios, PUBLISHERS\
    \ have not been\n   discussed.  Much of the time, it is assumed that the PUBLISHERS\
    \ will\n   allow CNs to act on their behalf.  For example, a PUBLISHER may\n \
    \  designate a particular CN to be the AUTHORITATIVE REQUEST-ROUTING\n   SYSTEM\
    \ for its CONTENT.  Similarly, a PUBLISHER may rely on a\n   particular CN to\
    \ aggregate all its ACCOUNTING data, even though that\n   data may originate at\
    \ SURROGATES in multiple distant CNs.  Finally, a\n   PUBLISHER may INJECT content\
    \ only into a single CN and rely on that\n   CN to ENLIST other CNs to obtain\
    \ scale and reach.\n   However, a PUBLISHER may wish to maintain more control\
    \ and take on\n   the task of ENLISTING CNs itself, therefore acting as a PCN\
    \ (Section\n   2.1).  This scenario, shown in Figure 4, describes the case where\
    \ a\n   PCN wishes to directly enter into NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIPS with\n   multiple\

  - "5.1.1.1.  Defeat of CLIENT's Security Settings\n   Because the SURROGATE's location\
    \ may differ from that of the ORIGIN,\n   the use of a SURROGATE may inadvertently\
    \ or maliciously defeat any\n   location-based security settings employed by the\
    \ CLIENT.  And since\n   the SURROGATE's location is generally transparent to\
    \ the CLIENT, the\n   CLIENT may be unaware that its protections are no longer\
    \ in force.\n   For example, a CN may relocate CONTENT from a Internet Explorer\n\
    \   user's \"Internet Web Content Zone\" to that user's \"Local Intranet Web\n\
    \   Content Zone\".  If the relocation is visible to the Internet Explorer\n \
    \  browser but otherwise invisible to the user, the browser may be\n   employing\
    \ less stringent security protections than the user is\n   expecting for that\
    \ CONTENT.  (Note that this threat differs, at least\n   in degree, from the substitution\

  - "5.1.2.1.  Delivery of Bad Accounting Information\n   If a CN does not deliver\
    \ accurate accounting information, the\n   PUBLISHER may be unable to charge CLIENTs\
    \ for accessing CONTENT or it\n   may reward CLIENTs inappropriately.  Inaccurate\
    \ accounting\n   information may also cause a PUBLISHER to pay for services (e.g.,\n\
    \   content distribution) that were not actually rendered.  Invalid\n   accounting\
    \ information may also effect PUBLISHERs indirectly by, for\n   example, undercounting\
    \ the number of site visitors (and, thus,\n   reducing the PUBLISHER's advertising\
    \ revenue).\n"

    \ be treated with less care\n   than the PUBLISHER expects.  This threat may also\
    \ manifest itself if\n   the legal jurisdiction of the SURROGATE differs from\
    \ that of the\n   ORIGIN, should, for example, legal differences between the\n\
    \   jurisdictions require or permit different treatment of the CONTENT.\n"
