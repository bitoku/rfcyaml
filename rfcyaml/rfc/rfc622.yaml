  - "                      Scheduling IMP/TIP Down Time\nFrom time to time it is necessary\
    \ for an IMP or TIP to be taken down\nother than during its scheduled Preventive\
    \ Maintenance period.  Examples\nof such cases are retrofit programs and the off-line\
    \ diagnosis and\nrepair of intermittent problems. In the past we have scheduled\
    \ these\ndowns with our \"primary site contact\" at the affected site; in our\
    \ view\nthis individual was responsible for representing all of the hosts (and\n\
    TIP users) connected to that IMP/TIP. Although this policy has worked\nwell in\
    \ the past, the recent proliferation of Very Distant Hosts,\ntogether with complaints\
    \ from representatives of other (local or\ndistant) Hosts, has caused us to review\
    \ our procedures.\nThis note announces a modification of the previous policy.\
    \ We will\ncontinue to schedule IMP/TIP downs with our \"primary site contact.\"\
    \  We\nwill continue to consider this individual a representative of all Hosts\n\
    connected to that IMP/TIP, with the following exception. Any Host\norganization\
    \ wishing to be notified by telephone that down time has been\nscheduled for their\
    \ IMP/TIP may nominate some individual as a \"secondary\ncontact.\"  The name\
    \ of the secondary contact, together with a telephone\nnumber where he/she can\
    \ be reached, should be submitted to me by any of\nthe following methods:\n  \
