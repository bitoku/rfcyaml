  - "A Grant of Rights to Hewlett-Packard US Patents 5,293,635 and 5,421,024\n   HP\
    \ hereby covenants that it will not assert any claims in US Patents\n   5,293,635,\
    \ 5,421,024, any continuations, divisions, or\n   continuations-in-part of either,\
    \ or any non-US counterparts of any of\n   the foregoing against any party that\
    \ makes, uses, sells, imports, or\n   offers for sale, an implementation of an\
    \ IETF standards-track MIB\n   module that includes HP's contributed search address\
    \ technology, or\n   any derivative of that contribution, provided that the MIB\
    \ module is\n   employed to implement the Internet-standard network management\n\
    \   framework.  Such grant of rights is limited in that it does not\n   include\
    \ a right to incorporate such HP search address technology into\n   proprietary\
    \ MIB modules.\n   This grant of rights will permanently terminate with respect\
    \ to any\n   party (and to any subsidiary of a party) that asserts a patent it\n\
    \   owns or controls, either directly or indirectly, against HP or any of\n  \
    \ its subsidiaries for implementation of, or operation of any system\n   utilizing,\
    \ search address technology.  The termination of rights will\n   occur as of the\
    \ date the patent is asserted against HP.\n   A written confirmation of this grant,\
    \ and/or a license under any\n   other HP patent under HP's then-current terms,\
    \ conditions, and\n   royalty rates, can be obtained by sending a request to:\n\
