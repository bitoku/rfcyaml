  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) relies on three\
    \ principles\n   to improve the scalability properties of Internet routing: address\n\
    \   role separation, encapsulation, and mapping.  When invented, LISP was\n  \
    \ targeted at solving the Internet routing scaling problem [RFC4984].\n   There\
    \ have now been years of implementations and experiments\n   examining the impact\
    \ and open questions of using LISP to improve\n   inter-domain routing scalability.\
    \  Experience has shown that because\n   LISP utilizes mapping and encapsulation\
    \ technologies, it can be\n   deployed and used for purposes that go beyond routing\
    \ scalability.\n   For example, LISP provides a mean for a LISP site to precisely\n\
    \   control its inter-domain outgoing and incoming traffic, with the\n   possibility\
    \ to apply different policies to different domains\n   exchanging traffic with\
    \ it.  LISP can also be used to ease the\n   transition from IPv4 to IPv6 as it\
    \ allows the transport of IPv4 over\n   IPv6 or IPv6 over IPv4.  Furthermore,\
    \ LISP also supports inter-domain\n   multicast.\n   Leveraging implementation\
    \ and deployment experience, as well as\n   research work, this document describes,\
    \ at a high level, the impacts\n   and open questions still seen in LISP.  This\
    \ information is\n   particularly useful for considering future approaches and\
    \ to support\n   further experimentation to clarify some large open questions\
    \ (e.g.,\n   around the operations).  LISP utilizes a tunnel-based data plane\
    \ and\n   a distributed control plane.  LISP requires some new functionalities,\n\
    \   such as reachability mechanisms.  Because LISP is more than a simple\n   encapsulation\
    \ technology and is a new technology, until even more\n   deployment experience\
    \ is gained, some open questions related to LISP\n   deployment and operations\
    \ remain.  As an encapsulation technology,\n   there may be concerns on reduced\
    \ Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size\n   in some deployments.  An important\
    \ impact of LISP is on network\n   operations related to resiliency and troubleshooting.\
    \  As LISP relies\n   on cached mappings and on encapsulation, resiliency during\
    \ failures\n   and troubleshooting may be more difficult.  Also, the use of\n\
    \   encapsulation may make failure detection and recovery slower, and it\n   will\
    \ require more coordination than with a single, non-encapsulated,\n   routing\
    \ domain solution.\n"
- title: 2.  LISP in a Nutshell
  contents:
  - "2.  LISP in a Nutshell\n   LISP relies on three principles: address role separation,\n\
    \   encapsulation, and mapping.\n   The address space is divided into two sets\
    \ that have different\n   semantic meanings: the Routing Locators (RLOCs) and\
    \ the Endpoint\n   Identifiers (EIDs).  RLOCs are addresses typically assigned\
    \ from the\n   Provider Aggregatable (PA) address space.  The EIDs are attributed\
    \ to\n   the nodes in the edge networks, by a block of contiguous addresses,\n\
    \   which are typically Provider Independent (PI).  To limit the\n   scalability\
    \ problem, LISP only requires the PA routes towards the\n   RLOCs to be announced\
    \ in the provider infrastructure.  Whereas for\n   non-LISP deployments, the EIDs\
    \ need to be propagated as well.\n   LISP routers are used at the boundary between\
    \ the EID and the RLOC\n   spaces.  Routers used to exit the EID space (towards\
    \ the provider\n   domain) are called Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs), and those\
    \ used to\n   enter the EID space (from the provider domain) are called the Egress\n\
    \   Tunnel Routers (ETRs).  When a host sends a packet to a remote\n   destination,\
    \ it sends it as in the non-LISP Internet.  The packet\n   arrives at the border\
    \ of its site at an ITR.  Because EIDs are not\n   routable on the Internet, the\
    \ packet is encapsulated with the source\n   address set to the ITR RLOC and the\
    \ destination address set to the\n   ETR RLOC.  The encapsulated packet is then\
    \ forwarded in the provider\n   domain until it reaches the selected ETR.  The\
    \ ETR de-encapsulates\n   the packet and forwards it to its final destination.\
    \  The acronym xTR\n   stands for Ingress/Egress Tunnel Router and is used for\
    \ a router\n   playing these two roles.\n   The correspondence between EIDs and\
    \ RLOCs is given by the mappings.\n   When an ITR needs to find ETR RLOCs that\
    \ serve an EID, it queries a\n   mapping system.  With the LISP Canonical Address\
    \ Format (LCAF)\n   [LISP-LCAF], LISP is not restricted to the Internet protocol\
    \ for the\n   EID addresses.  With LCAF, any address type can be used as EID (the\n\
    \   address is only the key for the mapping lookup).  LISP can transport,\n  \
    \ for example, Ethernet frames over the Internet.\n   An introduction to LISP\
    \ can be found in [RFC7215].  The LISP\n   specifications are given in [RFC6830],\
    \ [RFC6833], [LISP-DDT],\n   [RFC6836], [RFC6832], and [RFC6834].\n"
- title: 3.  LISP for Scaling the Internet Routing Architecture
  contents:
  - "3.  LISP for Scaling the Internet Routing Architecture\n   The original goal\
    \ of LISP was to improve the scalability properties\n   of the Internet routing\
    \ architecture.  LISP utilizes traffic\n   engineering and stub Autonomous System\
    \ (AS) prefixes (not announced\n   anymore in the Default-Free Zone (DFZ)), so\
    \ that routing tables are\n   smaller and more stable (i.e., they experience less\
    \ churn).\n   Furthermore, at the edge of the network, information necessary to\n\
    \   forward packets (i.e., the mappings) is obtained on demand using a\n   pull\
    \ model (whereas the current Internet BGP model uses a push\n   model).  Therefore,\
    \ the scalability of edge networks is less\n   dependent on the Internet's size\
    \ and more related to its traffic\n   matrix.  This scaling improvement has been\
    \ proven by several studies\n   (see below).  The research studies cited hereafter\
    \ are based on the\n   following assumptions:\n   o  EID-to-RLOC mappings follow\
    \ the same prefix size as the current\n      BGP routing infrastructure (current\
    \ PI addresses only);\n   o  EIDs are used only at the stub ASes, not in the transit\
    \ ASes; and\n   o  the RLOCs of an EID prefix are deployed at the edge between\
    \ the\n      stubs owning the EID prefix and the providers, allocating the\n \
    \     RLOCs in a PA mode.\n   The above assumptions are inline with [RFC7215]\
    \ and current LISP\n   deployments.  It is recognized these assumptions may change\
    \ in the\n   longer term.  [KIF13] and [CDLC] explore different EID prefix space\n\
    \   sizes and still show results that are consistent and equivalent to\n   the\
    \ above assumptions.\n   Quoitin et al. [QIdLB07] show that the separation between\
    \ locator and\n   identifier roles at the network level improves the routing\n\
    \   scalability by reducing the Routing Information Base (RIB) size (up\n   to\
    \ one order of magnitude) and increases path diversity and thus the\n   traffic\
    \ engineering capabilities.  [IB07] and [KIF13] show, based on\n   real Internet\
    \ traffic traces, that the number of mapping entries that\n   must be handled\
    \ by an ITR of a network with up to 20,000 users is\n   limited to few tens of\
    \ thousands; the signaling traffic (i.e.,\n   Map-Request/Map-Reply packets) is\
    \ in the same order of magnitude\n   similar to DNS request/reply traffic; and\
    \ the encapsulation overhead,\n   while not negligible, is very limited (in the\
    \ order of few percentage\n   points of the total traffic volume).\n   Previous\
    \ studies consider the case of a timer-based cache eviction\n   policy (i.e.,\
    \ mappings are deleted from the cache upon timeout),\n   while [CDLC] has a more\
    \ general approach based on the Least Recently\n   Used (LRU) eviction policy,\
    \ proposing an analytic model for the EID-\n   to-RLOC cache size when prefix-level\
    \ traffic has a stationary\n   generating process.  The model shows that miss\
    \ rate can be accurately\n   predicted from the EID-to-RLOC cache size and a small\
    \ set of easily\n   measurable traffic parameters.  The model was validated using\
    \ four\n   one-day-long packet traces collected at egress points of a campus\n\
    \   network and an academic exchange point considering EID prefixes as\n   being\
    \ of the same size as BGP prefixes.  Consequently, operators can\n   provision\
    \ the EID-to-RLOC cache of their ITRs according to the miss\n   rate they want\
    \ to achieve for their given traffic.\n   Results in [CDLC] indicate that for\
    \ a given target miss ratio, the\n   size of the cache depends only on the parameters\
    \ of the popularity\n   distribution; the size of the cache is independent of\
    \ the number of\n   users (the size of the LISP site) and the number of destinations\
    \ (the\n   size of the EID prefix space).  Assuming that the popularity\n   distribution\
    \ remains constant, this means that as the number of users\n   and the number\
    \ of destinations grow, the cache size needed to obtain\n   a given miss rate\
    \ remains constant O(1).\n   LISP usually populates its EID-to-RLOC cache in a\
    \ pull mode, which\n   means that mappings are retrieved on demand by the ITR.\
    \  The main\n   advantage of this mode is that the EID-to-RLOC cache size only\n\
    \   depends on the traffic characteristics at the ITR and is independent\n   of\
    \ the size of the provider domain.  This benefit comes at the cost\n   of some\
    \ delay to transmit the packets that do not hit an entry in the\n   cache (for\
    \ which a mapping has to be learned).  This delay is bound\n   by the time necessary\
    \ to retrieve the mapping from the mapping\n   system.  Moreover, similarly to\
    \ a push model (e.g., BGP), the pull\n   model induces signaling messages that\
    \ correspond to the retrieval of\n   mappings upon cache miss.  The difference\
    \ being that the signaling\n   load only depends on the traffic at the ITR and\
    \ is not triggered by\n   external events such as in BGP.  [CDLC] shows that the\
    \ miss rate is a\n   function of the EID-to-RLOC cache size and traffic generation\n\
    \   process, and [CDLC], [SDIB08], and [SDIB08] show from traffic traces\n   that,\
    \ in practice, the cache miss rate, and thus the signaling rate,\n   remain low.\n"
- title: 4.  Beyond Scaling the Internet Routing Architecture
  contents:
  - "4.  Beyond Scaling the Internet Routing Architecture\n   LISP is more than just\
    \ a scalability solution; it is also a tool to\n   provide both incoming and outgoing\
    \ traffic engineering [S11]\n   [LISP-TE], it can be used as an IPv6 transition\
    \ at the routing level,\n   and it can be used for inter-domain multicast [RFC6831]\
    \ [LISP-RE].\n   Also, LISP has been identified for use to support devices' Internet\n\
    \   mobility [LISP-MN] and to support virtual machines' mobility in data\n   centers\
    \ and multi-tenant VPNs.  These last two uses are not discussed\n   further as\
    \ they are out of the scope of the current LISP Working\n   Group charter.\n \
    \  A key advantage of the LISP architecture is that it facilitates\n   routing\
    \ in environments where there is little to no correlation\n   between network\
    \ endpoints and topological location.  In service-\n   provider environments,\
    \ this application is needed in a range of\n   consumer use cases that require\
    \ an inline anchor to deliver a service\n   to subscribers.  Inline anchors provide\
    \ one of three types of\n   capabilities:\n   o  enable mobility of subscriber\
    \ endpoints\n   o  enable chaining of middlebox functions and services\n   o \
    \ enable functions to be scaled out seamlessly\n   Without LISP, the approach\
    \ commonly used by operators is to aggregate\n   service anchors in custom-built\
    \ boxes.  This limits deployments as\n   endpoints can only move on the same mobile\
    \ gateway, functions can be\n   chained only if traffic traverses the same wire\
    \ or the same Deep\n   Packet Inspection (DPI) box, and capacity can be scaled\
    \ out only if\n   traffic fans out to/from a specific load balancer.\n   With\
    \ LISP, service providers are able to distribute, virtualize, and\n   instantiate\
    \ subscriber-service anchors anywhere in the network.\n   Typical use cases for\
    \ virtualized inline anchors and network\n   functions include Distributed Mobility\
    \ and Virtualized Evolved Packet\n   Core (vEPC), Virtualized Customer Premise\
    \ Equipment (vCPE), where\n   functionality previously anchored at a customer\
    \ premise is now\n   dynamically allocated in the network, Virtualized SGi LAN,\
    \ Virtual IP\n   Multimedia Subsystems (IMSs), Virtual Session Border Controller\n\
    \   (SBC), etc.\n   ConteXtream [ConteXtream] has been deploying map-assisted\
    \ overlay\n   networks since 2006, first with a proprietary solution, then evolving\n\
    \   to standard LISP.  The solution has been deployed in production in\n   three\
    \ tier-1 operators spanning hundreds of millions of subscribers.\n   Map-assisted\
    \ overlays had been primarily used to map subscriber flows\n   to services resources\
    \ dynamically based on profiles and conditions.\n   Specifically, it has been\
    \ used to map mobile subscribers to value-\n   added/optimization services, broadband\
    \ subscribers to telephony\n   services, and fixed-mobile subscribers to Broadband\
    \ Network Gateway\n   (BNG) functions and Internet access services.  The LISP\
    \ map-assisted\n   overlay architecture is used to optimally resolve subscriber\
    \ to\n   services, functions, instances, and IP overlay aggregation locations\n\
    \   on a per-flow basis and just in time.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Traffic Engineering
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Traffic Engineering\n   In the current (non-LISP) routing infrastructure,\
    \ addresses used by\n   stub networks are globally routable, and the routing system\n\
    \   distributes the routes to reach these stubs.  With LISP, the EID\n   prefixes\
    \ of a LISP site are not routable in the DFZ; mappings are\n   needed in order\
    \ to determine the list of LISP routers to contact to\n   forward packets.  This\
    \ difference is significant for two reasons.\n   First, packets are not forwarded\
    \ to a site but to a specific router.\n   Second, a site can control the entry\
    \ points for its traffic by\n   controlling its mappings.\n   For traffic engineering\
    \ purposes, a mapping associates an EID prefix\n   to a list of RLOCs.  Each RLOC\
    \ is annotated with a priority and a\n   weight.  When there are several RLOCs,\
    \ the ITR selects the one with\n   the highest priority and sends the encapsulated\
    \ packet to this RLOC.\n   If several RLOCs with the highest priority exist, then\
    \ the traffic is\n   balanced proportionally to their weight among such RLOCs.\
    \  Traffic\n   engineering in LISP thus allows the mapping owner to have a fine-\n\
    \   grained control on the primary and backup path for its incoming and\n   outgoing\
    \ packet use.  In addition, it can share the load among its\n   links.  An example\
    \ of the use of such a feature is described by\n   Saucez et al. [SDIB08], which\
    \ shows how to use LISP to direct\n   different types of traffic on different\
    \ links having different\n   capacity.\n   Traffic engineering in LISP goes one\
    \ step further, as every Map-\n   Request contains the source EID address of the\
    \ packet that caused a\n   cache miss and triggered the Map-Request.  It is thus\
    \ possible for a\n   mapping owner to differentiate the answer (Map-Reply) it\
    \ gives to\n   Map-Requests based on the requester.  This functionality is not\n\
    \   available today with BGP because a domain cannot control exactly the\n   routes\
    \ that will be received by domains that are not in the direct\n   neighborhood.\n"
- title: 4.2.  LISP for IPv6 Co-existence
  contents:
  - "4.2.  LISP for IPv6 Co-existence\n   The LISP encapsulation mechanism is designed\
    \ to support any\n   combination of address families for locators and identifiers.\
    \  It is\n   then possible to bind IPv6 EIDs with IPv4 RLOCs and vice versa. \
    \ This\n   allows transporting IPv6 packets over an IPv4 network (or IPv4\n  \
    \ packets over an IPv6 network), making LISP a valuable mechanism to\n   ease\
    \ the transition to IPv6.\n   An example is the case of the network infrastructure\
    \ of a data center\n   being IPv4 only while dual-stack front-end load balancers\
    \ are used.\n   In this scenario, LISP can be used to provide IPv6 access to servers\n\
    \   even though the network and the servers only support IPv4.  Assuming\n   that\
    \ the data center's ISP offers IPv6 connectivity, the data center\n   only needs\
    \ to deploy one (or more) xTR(s) at its border with the ISP\n   and one (or more)\
    \ xTR(s) directly connected to the load balancers.\n   The xTR(s) at the ISP's\
    \ border tunnels IPv6 packets over IPv4 to the\n   xTR(s) directly attached to\
    \ the load balancer.  The load balancer's\n   xTR de-encapsulates the packets\
    \ and forwards them to the load\n   balancer, which act as a proxy, translating\
    \ each IPv6 packet into an\n   IPv4 packet.  IPv4 packets are then sent to the\
    \ appropriate servers.\n   Similarly, when the server's response arrives at the\
    \ load balancer,\n   the packet is translated back into an IPv6 packet and forwarded\
    \ to\n   its xTR(s), which in turn will tunnel it back, over the IPv4-only\n \
    \  infrastructure, to an xTR connected to the ISP.  The packet is then\n   de-encapsulated\
    \ and forwarded to the ISP natively in IPv6.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Inter-domain Multicast
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Inter-domain Multicast\n   LISP has native support for multicast [RFC6831].\
    \  From the data-plane\n   perspective, at a multicast-enabled xTR, an EID-sourced\
    \ multicast\n   packet is encapsulated in another multicast packet and subsequently\n\
    \   forwarded in an RLOC-level distribution tree.  Therefore, xTRs must\n   participate\
    \ in both EID and RLOC-level distribution trees.  Control-\n   plane wise, since\
    \ group addresses have no topological significance,\n   they need not be mapped.\
    \  It is worth noting that, to properly\n   function, LISP-Multicast requires\
    \ that inter-domain multicast be\n   available.\n   LISP Replication Engineering\
    \ (LISP-RE) [LISP-RE] [CDM12] leverages\n   LISP messages [LISP-MULTI-SIGNALING]\
    \ for multicast state distribution\n   to construct xTR-based inter-domain multicast\
    \ distribution trees when\n   inter-domain multicast support is not available.\
    \  Simulations of\n   three different management strategies for low-latency content\n\
    \   delivery show that such overlays can support thousands of member\n   xTRs,\
    \ support hundreds of thousands of end hosts, and deliver content\n   at latencies\
    \ close to unicast ones [CDM12].  It was also observed\n   that high client churn\
    \ has a limited impact on performance and\n   management overhead.\n   Similar\
    \ to LISP-RE, \"Signal-Free LISP Multicast\" [LISP-SFM] can be\n   used when the\
    \ core network does not provide multicast support.  But\n   instead of using signaling\
    \ to build inter-domain multicast trees,\n   signal-free exclusively leverages\
    \ the map server for multicast state\n   storage and distribution.  As a result,\
    \ the source ITR generally\n   performs head-end replication, but it might also\
    \ be used to emulate\n   LISP-RE distribution trees.\n"

    \ that has neither LISP origin nor LISP\n   destination.  However, LISP can have\
    \ a significant impact on traffic\n   between a LISP site and a non-LISP site.\
    \  Traffic between a non-LISP\n   site and a LISP site is subject to the same\
    \ issues as those observed\n   for LISP-to-LISP traffic but also has issues specific\
    \ to the\n   transition mechanism that allow the LISP site to exchange packets\n\
    \   with a non-LISP site [RFC6832] [RFC7215].\n   The transition requires setup\
    \ of proxy tunnel routers (PxTRs).\n   Proxies cause what is referred to as path\
    \ stretch (i.e., a\n   lengthening of the path compared to the topological shortest\
    \ path)\n   and make troubleshooting harder.  There are still questions related\n\
    \   to PxTRs that need to be answered:\n   o  Where to deploy PxTRs?  The placement\
    \ in the topology has an\n      important impact on the path stretch.\n   o  How\
    \ many PxTRs?  The number of PxTRs has a direct impact on the\n      load and\
    \ the impact of the failure of a PxTR on the traffic.\n   o  What part of the\
    \ EID space?  Will all the PxTRs be proxies for the\n      whole EID space, or\
    \ will it be segmented between different PxTRs?\n   o  Who operates PxTRs?  An\
    \ important question to answer is related to\n      the entities that will deploy\
    \ PxTRs: how will they manage their\n      additional Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)\
    \ / Operating Expenses (OPEX)\n      associated with PxTRs?  How will the traffic\
    \ be carried with\n      respect to security and privacy?\n   A PxTR will also\
    \ normally advertise in BGP the EID prefix for which\n   they are proxies.  However,\
    \ if proxies are managed by different\n   entities, they will belong to different\
    \ ASes.  In this case, we need\n   to be sure that this will not cause Multi-Origin\
    \ AS (MOAS) issues\n   that could negatively influence routing.  Moreover, it\
    \ is important\n   to ensure that the way EID prefixes will be de-aggregated by\
    \ the\n   proxies will remain reasonable so as not to contribute to BGP\n   scalability\
    \ issues.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Impact on LISP Traffic and Sites
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Impact on LISP Traffic and Sites\n   LISP is a protocol based on the map-and-encap\
    \ paradigm, which has the\n   positive impacts that we have summarized in the\
    \ above sections.\n   However, LISP also has impacts on operations:\n   MTU issue:\
    \  As LISP uses encapsulation, the MTU is reduced; this has\n      implications\
    \ on potentially all of the traffic.  However, in\n      practice, on the lisp4.net\
    \ network, no major issue due to the MTU\n      has been observed.  This is probably\
    \ due to the fact that current\n      end-host stacks are well designed to deal\
    \ with the problem of MTU.\n   Resiliency issue:  The advantage of flexibility\
    \ and control offered\n      by the Locator/ID separation comes at the cost of\
    \ increasing the\n      complexity of the reachability detection.  Indeed, identifiers\
    \ are\n      not directly routable and have to be mapped to locators, but a\n\
    \      locator may be unreachable while others are still reachable.  This\n  \
    \    is an important problem for any tunnel-based solution.  In the\n      current\
    \ Internet, packets are forwarded independently of the\n      border router of\
    \ the network meaning that, in case of the failure\n      of a border router,\
    \ another one can be used.  With LISP, the\n      destination RLOC specifically\
    \ designates one particular ETR;\n      hence, if this ETR fails, the traffic\
    \ is dropped, even though\n      other ETRs are available for the destination\
    \ site.  Another\n      resiliency issue is linked to the fact that mappings are\
    \ learned\n      on demand.  When an ITR fails, all its traffic is redirected\
    \ to\n      other ITRs that might not have the mappings requested by the\n   \
    \   redirected traffic.  Existing studies [SKI12] [SD12] show, based\n      on\
    \ measurements and traffic traces, that failure of ITRs and RLOC\n      are infrequent\
    \ but that when such failure happens, a critical\n      number of packets can\
    \ be dropped.  Unfortunately, the current\n      techniques for LISP resiliency,\
    \ based on monitoring or probing,\n      are not rapid enough (failure recovery\
    \ on the order of a few\n      seconds).  To tackle this issue, [LISP-PRESERVE]\
    \ and\n      [LISP-ITR-GRACEFUL] propose techniques based on local failure\n \
    \     detection and recovery.\n   Middleboxes/filters:  Because of the increasingly\
    \ common use of\n      encryption as a response to pervasive monitoring [RFC7258]\
    \ with\n      LISP providing the option to encrypt traffic between xTRs\n    \
    \  [LISP-CRYPTO], middleboxes are increasingly likely to be unable to\n      understand\
    \ encapsulated traffic, which can cause them to drop\n      legitimate packets.\
    \  In addition, LISP allows triangular or even\n      rectangular routing, so\
    \ it is difficult to maintain a correct\n      state even if the middlebox understands\
    \ LISP.  Finally, filtering\n      may also have problems because they may think\
    \ only one host is\n      generating the traffic (the ITR), as long as it is not\n\
    \      de-encapsulated.  To deal with LISP encapsulation, LISP-aware\n      firewalls\
    \ that inspect inner LISP packets are proposed\n      [lispfirewall].\n   Troubleshooting/debugging:\
    \  The major issue that LISP experimentation\n      has shown is the difficulty\
    \ of troubleshooting.  When there is a\n      problem in the network, it is hard\
    \ to pinpoint the reason as the\n      operator only has a partial view of the\
    \ network.  The operator can\n      see what is in its EID-to-RLOC cache/database\
    \ and can try to\n      obtain what is potentially elsewhere by querying the Map\n\
    \      Resolvers, but the knowledge remains partial.  On top of that,\n      ICMP\
    \ packets only carry the first few tens of bytes of the\n      original packet,\
    \ which means that when an ICMP arrives at the ITR,\n      it might not contain\
    \ enough information to allow correct\n      troubleshooting.  Deployment in the\
    \ beta network has shown that\n      LISP+ALT [RFC6836] was not easy to maintain\
    \ and control [CCR13],\n      which explains the migration to LISP-DDT [LISP-DDT],\
    \ based on a\n      massively distributed and hierarchical approach [CCR13].\n\
    \   Business/operational related:  Iannone et al. [IL10] have shown that\n   \
    \   there are economical incentives to migrate to LISP; however, some\n      questions\
    \ remain.  For example, how will the EIDs be allocated to\n      allow aggregation\
    \ and hence scalability of the mapping system?\n      Who will operate the mapping\
    \ system infrastructure and for what\n      benefits?  What if several operators\
    \ run different mapping\n      systems?  How will they interoperate or share mapping\
    \ information?\n   Reachability:  The overhead related to RLOC reachability mechanisms\n\
    \      is not known.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   A thorough security and threat analysis of LISP\
    \ is carried out in\n   detail in [RFC7835].  For LISP and other Internet technologies,\
    \ most\n   of the threats can be mitigated using Best Current Practices, meaning\n\
    \   with careful deployment and configuration (e.g., filter), by\n   activating\
    \ only features that are really necessary in the deployment,\n   and by verifying\
    \ all the information obtained from third parties.\n   Unless gleaning (Section\
    \ 6 of [RFC6830] and Section 3.1 of [RFC7835])\n   features are used, the LISP\
    \ data plane shows the same level of\n   security as other IP-over-IP technologies.\
    \  From a security\n   perspective, the control plane remains the critical part\
    \ of the LISP\n   architecture.  To mitigate the threats on the mapping system,\n\
    \   authentication should be used for all control-plane messages.  The\n   current\
    \ specification defines security mechanisms [RFC6836]\n   [LISP-SEC] that can\
    \ reduce threats in open network environments.  The\n   LISP specification defines\
    \ a generic authentication data field for\n   control-plane messages [RFC6836],\
    \ which could be used for a general\n   authentication mechanism for the LISP\
    \ control plane while staying\n   backward compatible.\n"
