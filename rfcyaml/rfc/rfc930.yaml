- title: Status of This Memo
  contents:
  - "Status of This Memo\n   This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.\
    \  Hosts\n   on the ARPA Internet that exchange terminal type information within\n\
    \   the Telnet protocol are expected to adopt and implement this\n   standard.\
    \  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n   This standard supersedes RFC 884.\
    \  The only change is to specify that\n   the TERMINAL-TYPE IS sub-negotiation\
    \ should be sent only in response\n   to the TERMINAL-TYPE SEND sub-negotiation.\
    \  See below for further\n   explanation.\n"

- title: 4. Motivation for the Option
  contents:
  - "4. Motivation for the Option\n   This option allows a telnet server to determine\
    \ the type of terminal\n   connected to a user telnet program.  The transmission\
    \ of such\n   information does not immediately imply any change of processing.\n\
    \   However, the information may be passed to a process, which may alter\n   the\
    \ data it sends to suit the particular characteristics of the\n   terminal. For\
    \ example, some operating systems have a terminal driver\n   that accepts a code\
    \ indicating the type of terminal being driven.\n   Using the TERMINAL TYPE and\
    \ BINARY options, a telnet server program\n   on such a system could arrange to\
    \ have terminals driven as if they\n   were directly connected, including such\
    \ special functions as cursor\n   addressing, multiple colors, etc., not included\
    \ in the Network\n   Virtual Terminal specification.  This option fits into the\
    \ normal\n   structure of TELNET options by deferring the actual transfer of\n\
    \   status information to the SB command.\n"

  - "5. Description of the Option\n   WILL and DO are used only to obtain and grant\
    \ permission for future\n   discussion. The actual exchange of status information\
    \ occurs within\n   option subcommands (IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE...).\n   Once the\
    \ two hosts have exchanged a WILL and a DO, the sender of the\n   DO TERMINAL-TYPE\
    \ is free to request type information.  Only the\n   sender of the DO may send\
    \ requests (IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE SEND IAC SE)\n   and only the sender of the WILL\
    \ may transmit actual type information\n   (within an IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE IS\
    \ ... IAC SE command).  Terminal\n   type information may not be sent spontaneously,\
    \ but only in response\n   to a request.\n   The terminal type information is\
    \ an NVT ASCII string.  Within this\n"

- title: 6.  Implementation Suggestions
  contents:
  - "6.  Implementation Suggestions\n   The \"terminal type\" information may be any\
    \ NVT ASCII string\n   meaningful to both ends of the negotiation.  The list of\
    \ terminal\n   type names in \"Assigned Numbers\" is intended to minimize confusion\n\
    \   caused by alternative \"spellings\" of the terminal type.  For example,\n\
    \   confusion would arise if one party were to call a terminal\n   \"IBM3278-2\"\
    \ while the other called it \"IBM-3278/2\".  There is no\n   negative acknowledgement\
    \ for a terminal type that is not understood,\n   but certain other options (such\
    \ as switching to BINARY mode) may be\n   refused if a valid terminal type name\
    \ has not been specified.  In\n   some cases, a particular terminal may be known\
    \ by more than one name,\n   for example a specific type and a more generic type.\
    \  In such cases,\n   the sender of the TERMINAL-TYPE IS command should reply\
    \ to successive\n   TERMINAL-TYPE SEND commands with the various names, from most\
    \ to\n   least specific.  In this way, a telnet server that does not\n   understand\
    \ the first response can prompt for alternatives.  However,\n   it should cease\
    \ sending TERMINAL-TYPE SEND commands after receiving\n   the same response two\
    \ consecutive times.  Similarly, a sender should\n   indicate it has sent all\
    \ available names by repeating the last one\n   sent.  Note that TERMINAL-TYPE\
    \ IS must only be sent in response to a\n   request (TERMINAL-TYPE SEND), because\
    \ a host that sent TERMINAL-TYPE\n   IS and then received TERMINAL-TYPE SEND couldn't\
    \ determine whether\n   the other host was requesting a second option or the TERMINAL-TYPE\n\
    \   SEND and the TERMINAL-TYPE IS crossed in midstream.\n   The type \"UNKNOWN\"\
    \ should be used if the type of the terminal is\n   unknown or unlikely to be\
    \ recognized by the other party.\n"
