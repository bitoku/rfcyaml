  - "1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management
    Framework consists of four major\n   components.  They are:\n   o    RFC 1441
    which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n        describing and naming
    objects for the purpose of\n        management.\n   o    STD 17, RFC 1213 defines
    MIB-II, the core set of managed objects\n        for the Internet suite of protocols.\n
    \  o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other\n        architectural
    aspects of the framework.\n   o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for
    network\n        access to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects
    to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
      store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB
      are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n   defined
      in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
      an administratively assigned name.  The object\n   type together with an object
      instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation of the object.
      \ For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor,
      to refer to the\n   object type.\n"

    - "2.1.  Textual Conventions\n   Several new data types are introduced as a textual
      convention in this\n   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the
      readability of\n   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications\n
      \  if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the\n   these
      textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the\n   semantics
      of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an\n   artifact of the explanatory
      method used.  Objects defined in terms of\n   one of these methods are always
      encoded by means of the rules that\n   define the primitive type.  Hence, no
      changes to the SMI or the SNMP\n   are necessary to accommodate these textual
      conventions which are\n   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and
      writers in pursuit\n   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous
      MIB documents.\n"

    a network element uses a certain amount  of\n           slack,  Si,  to  reduce
    the amount of resources\n           that it has reserved for a particular flow,
    \ i,\n           the  value  Si  should be stored at the network\n           element.
    \  Subsequently,  if  reservation   re-\n           freshes  are  received  for
    flow i, the network\n           element must use the same slack Si without  any\n
    \          further computation. This guarantees consisten-\n           cy in the
    reservation process.\n           As an example for the use of  the  slack  term,\n
    \          consider the case where the required end-to-end\n           delay,
    Dreq, is larger than the  maximum  delay\n           of the fluid flow system.
    \ In this, Ctot is the\n           sum of the Backlog terms end to end,  and  Dtot\n
    \          is the sum of the delay terms end to end.  Dreq\n           is obtained
    by setting R=r in the  fluid  delay\n           formula, and is given by\n                        b/r
    + Ctot/r + Dtot.\n           In this case the slack term is\n                  S
    = Dreq - (b/r + Ctot/r + Dtot).\n           The slack term may be used by the
    network  ele-\n           ments  to  adjust  their local reservations, so\n           that
    they can admit flows that would  otherwise\n           have been rejected. A service
    element at an in-\n           termediate network element that can  internally\n
    \          differentiate between delay and rate guarantees\n           can now
    take advantage of this  information  to\n           lower the amount of resources
    allocated to this\n           flow. For example, by taking an amount of slack\n
    \          s  <= S, an RCSD scheduler [5] can increase the\n           local delay
    bound, d, assigned to the flow,  to\n           d+s. Given an RSpec, (Rin, Sin),
    it would do so\n           by setting Rout = Rin and Sout = Sin - s.\n           Similarly,
    \ a  network  element  using  a   WFQ\n           scheduler  can  decrease  its
    local reservation\n           from Rin to Rout by using some of the slack  in\n
    \          the  RSpec.  This  can be accomplished by using\n           the transformation
    rules given in the  previous\n           section,  that ensure that the reduced
    reserva-\n           tion level will not increase the  overall  end-\n           to-end
