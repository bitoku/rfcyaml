Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) defined the Content Type parameter "smime type".
As the list of defined values for that parameter has increased, it has become clear that a registry is needed to document these values.
This document creates the registry, registers the current values, and specifies the policies for registration of new values.
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) defined the Content Type "application/pkcs7 mime" and the parameter "smime type", along with four valid values for the parameter [RFC3851].
Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) added two new parameter values [RFC5273].
[RFC5751] replaced RFC 3851 and registered the application/pkcs7 mime media type, but did not create a registry for the smime type values.
Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [RFC2634] and Securing X.400 Content with S/MIME [RFC3854] also add smime type values.
When Enrollment over Secure Transport
[RFC7030] added another parameter value, it became clear that a registry for smime type parameter values is necessary.
Section 2 creates this registry, registers the current values that are defined in previously published documents, and specifies the policies for registration of new values.
IANA Considerations IANA has changed the reference field for the media type application/ pkcs7 mime to refer to [RFC5751] and this document.
This document replaces the references to RFC 5273 and RFC 7030, which are no longer needed.
IANA has created a new sub registry under the "MIME Media Type Sub  Parameter Registries" top level registry.
The new registry is "Parameter Values for the smime type Parameter", and it references this document and [RFC5751].
The S/MIME Message Specification [RFC5751], Section 3.2.2, specifies guidelines for assigning new smime type parameter values, and those guidelines apply to the assignment of values in this registry.
Security Considerations This document is purely administrative and presents no security issues.
