- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   In many cases Network Solutions' maintained directory applications\n\
    \   require some unique and persistent way to talk about an individual or\n  \
    \ organization.  For example, white pages style services need to\n   determine\
    \ if one entry is distinct from another even if some of the\n   data happens to\
    \ be the same.  Also, e-commerce authentication\n   mechanisms needs to identify\
    \ a user and/or company uniquely and\n   possibly over large spans of time.  In\
    \ many cases a customer\n   relationship can last several decades.  Such long\
    \ term customer\n   relationships can outlast any specific email address, Internet\n\
    \   service provider, surname, or possibly even the DNS itself.\n   The intent\
    \ for these applications is that they be used and integrated\n   into other, non-NSI\
    \ maintained applications in much the same way that\n   domain-names that exist\
    \ in Network Solution's database are primarily\n   used in application that Network\
    \ Solutions is _not_ involved in.  In\n   much the same way that ISBNs are maintained\
    \ by specific entities but\n   used in widely varying applications, NSI's PIN\
    \ namespace is intended\n   to be used in many applications where there is a need\
    \ for a well\n   maintained identifier that names a person or organization.\n\
    \   A URN namespace is uniquely suited to solve the persistent\n   identification\
    \ needs of these applications since they are also\n   required to be unique and\
    \ persistent.  The availability of a\n   standardized resolution mechanism makes\
    \ it possible for other\n   applications to reference and resolve PIN URNs in\
    \ their own systems\n   in an open, non-proprietary way.\n   This namespace specification\
    \ is for a formal namespace.\n"

  - "2. Specification Template\n   Namespace ID:\n       \"pin\" requested.\n   Registration\
    \ Information:\n       Registration Version Number: 1\n       Registration Date:\
    \ 2000-09-30\n   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n       Network Solutions\n\
    \       505 Huntmar Park Drive\n       Herndon, VA 22070\n   Declaration of structure:\n\
    \       The structure of the NSS is a flat space of alphanumeric\n         characters\
    \ which have no knowable structure outside of the\n         context of Network\
    \ Solutions internal resolver.  Future changes\n         to the assignment methods\
    \ may allow others to assign\n         sub-spaces of the flat namespace but again,\
    \ this knowledge is\n         only valid internally and should never be inferred\
    \ or relied\n         upon externally.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \       None\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n       Identifiers are\
    \ assigned by Network Solutions proprietary\n         registration system in a\
    \ way that guarantees uniqueness.  At\n         this time the algorithm is to\
    \ iterate from the last assigned\n         number by some positive integer.  In\
    \ the future this algorithm\n         may change to incorporate a full range of\
    \ alphanumeric\n         elements.  In either case, the system will compare the\
    \ newly\n         created identifier with all of the previous ones to ensure\n\
    \         that it has not already been assigned.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \       The assignment process guarantees that names are not reassigned\n    \
    \     and that the binding between the name and the person or\n         organization\
    \ is permanent, regardless of any personal name\n         changes, corporate restructuring,\
    \ death or dissolution.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n       Names are\
    \ granted via Network Solutions proprietary registration\n         procedures.\n\
    \   Process of identifier resolution:\n       PIN URNs are resolved via URN resolvers\
    \ run by Network\n         Solutions.  Since a PIN URN identifies a person or\n\
    \         organization, resolving a PIN URN will only be able to return\n    \
    \     information from an electronic proxy that is merely a\n         representation\
    \ of the actual person or organization being\n         named.\n   Rules for Lexical\
    \ Equivalence:\n       The entire URN is case-insensitive.\n   Conformance with\
    \ URN Syntax:\n       There are no additional characters reserved.\n   Validation\
    \ mechanism:\n       None additional to resolution specified\n   Scope:\n    \
    \   Global\n"

- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   Since the URNs in this namespace are opaque there\
    \ are no additional\n   security considerations other than those normally associated\
    \ with the\n   use and resolution of URNs in general.\n   It is noted however\
    \ that attempting to resolve a PIN URN through a\n   resolver other than the one\
    \ provided by Network Solution is error\n   prone.  In any case it is not considered\
    \ authoritative.\n"
