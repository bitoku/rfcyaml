Abstract This document specifies a new iCalendar (RFC 5545) component that allows the publication of available and unavailable time periods associated with a calendar user.
This component can be used in standard iCalendar free busy lookups, including the iCalendar Transport independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP; RFC 5546) free busy requests, to generate repeating blocks of available or busy time with exceptions as needed.
This document also defines extensions to the Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV) calendar access protocol (RFC 4791) and the associated scheduling protocol (RFC 6638) to specify how this new calendar component can be used when evaluating free busy time.
Introduction Calendar users often have regular periods of time when they are either available to be scheduled or always unavailable.
For example, an office worker will often wish only to appear free to their work colleagues during normal 'office hours' (e.g., Monday through Friday, 9 am through 5 pm).
Or, a university professor might only be available to students during a set period of time (e.g., Thursday afternoons, 2 pm through 5 pm during term time only).
Ideally, users ought be able to specify such periods directly via their calendar user agent and have them automatically considered as part of the normal free busy lookup for that user.
In addition, it ought be possible to present different periods of available time depending on which user is making the request.
iCalendar [RFC5545] defines a "VFREEBUSY" component that can be used to represent fixed busy time periods, but it does not provide a way to specify a repeating period of available or unavailable time.
Since repeating patterns are often the case, "VFREEBUSY" components are not sufficient to solve this problem.
This specification defines a new type of iCalendar component that can be used to publish user availability.
CalDAV [RFC4791] provides a way for calendar users to access and manage calendar data and exchange this data via scheduling operations.
As part of this, the CalDAV calendar access [RFC4791] feature provides a CALDAV:free busy query REPORT that returns free  busy information for a calendar collection or hierarchy of calendar collections.
Also, the CalDAV calendar auto schedule [RFC6638] feature allows free busy information for a calendar user to be determined.
Both of these operations involve examining user calendars for events that 'block time', with the blocked out periods being returned in a "VFREEBUSY" component.
This specification extends the CalDAV calendar access and CalDAV calendar auto schedule features to allow the new iCalendar availability components to be stored and manipulated and to allow free busy lookups to use the information from any such components, if present.

This specification adds a new "VAVAILABILITY" calendar component to iCalendar.
The "VAVAILABILITY" component is itself a container for new "AVAILABLE" subcomponents.
The purpose of the "VAVAILABILITY" calendar component is to provide a grouping of available time information over a specific range of time.
Within that, there are specific time ranges that are marked as available via a set of "AVAILABLE" calendar subcomponents.
Together these can be used to specify available time that can repeat over set periods of time, and which can vary over time.
An illustration of how "VAVAILABILITY" and "AVAILABLE" components work is shown below.
The overall time range is shown at the top.
A "VAVAILABILITY" component spans part of the range.
The time range covered by the "VAVAILABILITY" component is considered to be busy, except for the ranges covered by the "AVAILABLE" components within the "VAVAILABILITY" component.
VAVAILABILITY Component Component Name:  VAVAILABILITY Purpose:
Provide a grouping of component properties and subcomponents that describe the availability associated with a calendar user.
last mod / location / organizer / priority /seq / summary / url /
; ; Either 'dtend' or 'duration' MAY appear ; in an 'availableprop', but 'dtend' and ; 'duration' MUST NOT occur in the same ; 'availabilityprop'.
; ; the following are OPTIONAL ; and MAY occur more than once ; categories / comment / contact / exdate / rdate /
A "VAVAILABILITY" component indicates a period of time within which availability information is provided.
A "VAVAILABILITY" component can specify a start time and an end time or duration.
If "DTSTART" is not present, then the start time is unbounded.
If "DTEND" or "DURATION" are not present, then the end time is unbounded.
Within the specified time period, availability defaults to a free busy type of "BUSY UNAVAILABLE" (see Section 3.2), except for any time periods corresponding to "AVAILABLE" subcomponents. "
" subcomponents are used to indicate periods of free time within the time range of the enclosing "VAVAILABILITY" component.
"AVAILABLE" subcomponents MAY include recurrence properties to specify recurring periods of time, which can be overridden using normal iCalendar recurrence behavior (i.e., use of the "RECURRENCE ID" property).
If specified, the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties in "VAVAILABILITY" components and "AVAILABLE" subcomponents MUST be "DATE TIME" values specified as either the date with UTC time or the date with local time and a time zone reference.
The iCalendar object containing the "VAVAILABILITY" component MUST contain appropriate "VTIMEZONE" components corresponding to each unique "TZID" parameter value used in any DATE TIME properties in all components, unless [RFC7809] is in effect.
When used to publish available time, the "ORGANIZER" property specifies the calendar user associated with the published available time.
If the "PRIORITY" property is specified in "VAVAILABILITY" components, it is used to determine how that component is combined with other "VAVAILABILITY" components.
Other calendar properties MAY be specified in "VAVAILABILITY" or "AVAILABLE" components and are considered attributes of the marked block of time.
Their usage is application specific.
For example, the "LOCATION" property might be used to indicate that a person is available in one location for part of the week and a different location for another part of the week (but see Section 9 for when it is appropriate to add additional data like this).
The following is an example of a "VAVAILABILITY" calendar component used to represent the availability of a user, always available Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm in the America/Montreal time zone:

The following is an example of a "VAVAILABILITY" calendar component used to represent the availability of a user available Monday through Thursday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, at the main office, and Friday, 9:00 am to 12:00 pm, in the branch office in the America/Montreal time zone between October 2nd and December 2nd 2011:

The following is an example of three "VAVAILABILITY" calendar components used to represent the availability of a traveling worker: Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm each day.
However, for three weeks the calendar user is working in Montreal, then one week in Denver, then back to Montreal.
Note that each overall period is covered by separate "VAVAILABILITY" components.
The last of these has no DTEND so it continues on "forever".
This example shows one way "blocks" of available time can be represented.
See Section 4 for another approach using priorities.

Busy Time Type Property Name:
This property specifies the default busy time type.
IANA and nonstandard property parameters can be specified on this property.
This property can be specified within "VAVAILABILITY" calendar components.
This property is used to specify the default busy time type.
The values correspond to those used by the "FBTYPE" parameter used on a "FREEBUSY" property, with the exception that the "FREE" value is not used in this property.
If not specified on a component that allows this property, the default is "BUSY  UNAVAILABLE".
The following is an example of this property: BUSYTYPE:BUSY 4.
The "VAVAILABILITY" component allows a calendar user to describe their availability over extended periods of time through the use of recurrence patterns.
This availability might be relatively constant from year to year.
However, there is usually some degree of irregularity, as people take vacations or perhaps spend a few weeks at a different office.
For that period of time there is a need to redefine their availability.
Rather than modify their existing availability, the "PRIORITY" property allows new "VAVAILABILITY" components to override others of lower ordinal priority.
Note that iCalendar [RFC5545] defines the "PRIORITY" property such that a value of 0 is undefined, 1 is the highest priority, and 9 is the lowest.
When combining "VAVAILABILITY" components, an absence of a "PRIORITY" property or a value of 0 implies the lowest level of priority.
When two or more VAVAILABILITY components overlap, and they have the same PRIORITY value, the overlapping busy time type is determined by the following order: BUSY >
That is, if one component has a BUSYTYPE set to BUSY and the other has BUSYTYPE set to BUSY
UNAVAILABLE, then the effective busy time type over the time range that they overlap would be BUSY.
It is up to the creator of such components to ensure that combining them produces a consistent and expected result.
To calculate the available time, order the intersecting "VAVAILABILITY" components by priority (the lowest to highest "PRIORITY" values are 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).
Step through the resulting list of "VAVAILABILITY" components.
For each, the time range covered by the "VAVAILABILITY" component is set to busy and then portions of it defined by the "AVAILABLE" components in the "VAVAILABILITY" component are set to free.
Note that, if any "VAVAILABILITY" component completely covers the date range of interest, then any lower priority "VAVAILABILITY" components can be ignored.
Typically, a calendar user's "default" availability (e.g., business hours of Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm) would use the lowest level of priority: zero.
Any overrides to the "default" would use higher levels as needed.
To avoid having to keep readjusting the "PRIORITY" property value when an override has to be "inserted" between two existing components, priority values SHOULD be "spaced out" over the full range of values.
The table below illustrates this via an example.
The first row shows the priority range from low to high, the second row shows the corresponding "PRIORITY" property value, and the third row shows which "VAVAILABILITY" component has that priority.
The "default" availability is created with priority zero (shown as {a} in the table), then the first override created with priority 5 (shown as {b} in the table), a subsequent availability can be inserted between the two by using priority 7 (shown as {c} in the table), and another, taking precedence over all existing ones, with priority 3 (shown as {d} in the table).
As seen in the table, additional "slots" are open for more "VAVAILABILITY" components to be added with other priorities if needed.
This section describes how free busy time information for a calendar user is calculated in the presence of "VAVAILABILITY" calendar components.
An iCalendar "VFREEBUSY" component is used to convey "rolled up" free busy time information for a calendar user.
This can be generated as the result of an iTIP [RFC5546] free busy request or through some other mechanism (e.g., a CalDAV calendar access CALDAV:free busy query REPORT).
When one or more "VAVAILABILITY" components are present and intersect the time range for the free busy request, first the available time is calculated, as outlined in Section 4.
Once that is done, regular "VEVENT" and "VFREEBUSY" components can be "overlaid" in the usual way to block out time.
An example procedure for this is as follows:
Initially mark the entire period of the free busy request as free.
For each "VAVAILABILITY" component ordered by PRIORITY (lowest to highest): A.  Determine if the "VAVAILABILITY" intersects the time range of the free busy request.
B.  Determine if the "VAVAILABILITY" is completely overridden by a higher priority component.
For the time period covered by the "VAVAILABILITY" component, mark time in the free busy request result set as busy, using the busy time type derived from the "BUSYTYPE" property in the "VAVAILABILITY" component.
the "VAVAILABILITY" component to a list of components for further processing in step 3, if it has not been ignored.
For each "VAVAILABILITY" component in the list resulting from step 2, in order from the first item to the last item: A.  For each "AVAILABLE" component in the "VAVAILABILITY" component:
For each instance, mark the corresponding time in the free busy request result set as free.
For each "VEVENT" or "VFREEBUSY" component, apply normal free  busy processing within the free busy request time range.
In the examples below, a table is used to represent time slots for the period of a free busy request.
Each time slot is two hours long.
The column header represents the hours from midnight local time.
Each row below the column headers represents a step in the free busy result set determination, following the procedure outlined above.
Each cell in the rows below the column header contains a single character that represents the free busy type for the corresponding time period at the end of the process step represented by the row.
The characters in the row are: F  Represents "FREE" time in that slot.
B  Represents "BUSY" time in that slot.
U  Represents "BUSY UNAVAILABLE" time in that slot.
T  Represents "BUSY TENTATIVE" time in that slot.
I  Represents data to be ignored in that slot (as per step 2.B above).
Simple Example Appendix A shows the user's calendar.
This includes one "VAVAILABILITY" component giving available time within the requested time range of 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, together with one "VEVENT" component representing a two hour meeting starting at 12:00 pm.
A free busy request for Monday, 6th November 2011, midnight to midnight in the America/Montreal time zone would be calculated as follows using the steps described above.
U    U    F    F    B    F
Further Example Appendix B shows another way to represent the availability of the traveling worker shown above.
Here we represent their base availability of Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm each day with a "VAVAILABILITY" with default "PRIORITY" (there is no "DTEND" property so that this availability is unbounded).
For the week the calendar user is working in Denver (October 23rd through October 30th), we represent their availability with a "VAVAILABILITY" component with priority 1, which overrides the base availability.
There is also a two hour meeting starting at 12:00 pm (in the America/Denver time zone).
A free busy request for Monday, 24th October 2011, midnight to midnight in the America/Montreal time zone, would be calculated as follows using the steps described above.
Note that there is a two hour offset in the in the available time, compared to the previous example, due to the two hour difference between the time zone of the free busy request and the time zone of the user's availability and meeting.
"2.P0" shows the base availability, and "2.P1" shows the higher priority availability.
3.P1" only shows the higher priority availability contributing to the overall free busy since the default availability is ignored (as per step 2.B described above).

This specification does not define how "VAVAILABILITY" components are used in scheduling messages sent using the iTIP
It is expected that future specifications will define how iTIP scheduling can make use of "VAVAILABILITY" components.
This section lists what functionality is required of a CalDAV server, which supports "VAVAILABILITY" components in stored calendar data.
A server:  MUST advertise support for "VAVAILABILITY" components in CALDAV:
supported calendar component set properties on calendars that allow storing of such components;  MUST support CALDAV:free busy query REPORTs that aggregate the information in any "VAVAILABILITY" components in the calendar collections targeted by the request;  MUST support "VAVAILABILITY" components stored in a CALDAV:calendar availability Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) property on a CalDAV scheduling Inbox collection, if the CalDAV calendar auto schedule feature is supported;  MUST support iTIP
[RFC5546] free busy requests that aggregate the information in any "VAVAILABILITY" components in calendar collections that contribute to free busy, or in any "VAVAILABILITY" components stored in the CALDAV:
calendar  availability property on the CalDAV scheduling Inbox collection of the calendar user targeted by the iTIP free busy request, if the CalDAV calendar auto schedule feature is available.
Processing of "VAVAILABILITY" components MUST conform to all the requirements CalDAV imposes on calendar object resources (see Section 4.1 of [RFC4791]).
New Features in CalDAV 7.2.1.
A server supporting the features described in this document MUST include "calendar availability" as a field in the DAV response header from an OPTIONS request.
A value of "calendar availability" in the DAV response header indicates to clients that the server supports all the requirements specified in this document.
Using OPTIONS for the Discovery of Calendar Availability Support >
Response << HTTP/1.1 200 OK Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, COPY,
MOVE Allow: PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, REPORT, ACL DAV: 1, 2, 3, access control, calendar access, calendar availability Date:
Fri, 11 Nov 2005 09:32:12 GMT Content Length: 0
In this example, the OPTIONS method returns the value "calendar  availability" in the DAV response header to indicate that the collection "/home/bernard/calendars/" supports the new features defined in this specification.
CalDAV Time Range Queries Section 9.9 of [RFC4791] describes how to specify time ranges to limit the set of calendar components returned by the server.
This specification extends [RFC4791] to describe how to apply time range filtering to "VAVAILABILITY" components.
A "VAVAILABILITY" component is said to overlap a given time range if the condition for the corresponding component state specified in the table below is satisfied.
The conditions depend on the presence of the "DTSTART", "DTEND", and "DURATION" properties in the "VAVAILABILITY" component.
Note that, as specified above, the "DTEND" value MUST be a "DATE TIME" value equal to or after the "DTSTART" value, if specified.
VAVAILABILITY has the DTSTART property?
VAVAILABILITY has the DTEND property?
VAVAILABILITY has the DURATION property?
CALDAV:free busy query REPORT A CALDAV:free busy query REPORT can be executed on a calendar collection that contains iCalendar "VAVAILABILITY" components.
When that occurs, the server MUST aggregate the information in any "VAVAILABILITY" components when generating the free busy response, as described in Section 5.
Defines a "VAVAILABILITY" component that will be used in calculating free busy time when an iTIP free busy request is targeted at the calendar user who owns the Inbox.
This property MAY be protected and SHOULD NOT be returned by a PROPFIND DAV:allprop request.
Support for this property is REQUIRED.
The value of this property MUST be a valid iCalendar object containing
only one "VAVAILABILITY" component, and optionally, "VTIMEZONE" components other iCalendar components MUST NOT be present.
"VTIMEZONE" components SHOULD NOT be present if [RFC7809] is in effect.
For more complex availability scenarios, clients can store multiple "VAVAILABILITY" components in the calendar user's calendar collections.
This property allows a user to specify their availability by including an "VAVAILABILITY" component in the value of this property.
If present, the server MUST use this "VAVAILABILITY" component when determining free busy information as part of an iTIP free busy request being handled by the server.

The CalDAV calendar auto schedule feature (see Section 5 of [RFC6638]) includes a mechanism for free busy information to be requested via the CalDAV protocol.
Any "VAVAILABILITY" components in any calendar collections targeted during such a request MUST be included as part of the calculation of the overall free busy information.
In addition, the "VAVAILABILITY" component specified in the CALDAV:calendar availability property on the owner's Inbox MUST also be included in the free busy calculation.
Processing of all such "VAVAILABILITY" components is done as per Section 5.
Security Considerations Calculation of availability information, particularly with multiple overlapping time ranges, can be complex, and CalDAV servers MUST limit the complexity of such data stored by a client.
An attacker able to "inject" availability information into a calendar user's calendar data could ensure that the user never appears free for meetings or appears free at inappropriate times.
Calendar systems MUST ensure that availability information for a calendar user can only be modified by authorized users.
Security considerations in [RFC5545], [RFC5546], [RFC4791], [RFC6638], and [RFC7809] MUST also be adhered to.
Privacy Considerations Free busy and availability information can be used by attackers to infer the whereabouts or overall level of "activity" of the corresponding calendar user.
Any calendar system that allows a user to expose their free busy and availability information MUST limit access to that information to only authorized users.
When "VAVAILABILITY" components are sent to or shared with other calendar users, care has to be taken not to expose more information than is needed by each recipient.
For example, a business owner will likely not want their customers to know where they might be or what they might be doing, but family members might be willing to expose such information to each other.
Thus, calendaring systems allowing "VAVAILABILITY" components to be sent or shared to other calendar users MUST provide a way for nonessential properties to be removed (e.g., "SUMMARY", "LOCATION", and "DESCRIPTION").
iCalendar "VFREEBUSY" information generated from "VAVAILABILITY" components MUST NOT include information other than busy or free time periods.
In particular, user specified property values such as "SUMMARY", "LOCATION", and "DESCRIPTION" MUST NOT be copied into the free busy result data.
Privacy considerations in [RFC5545], [RFC5546], [RFC4791], [RFC6638], and [RFC7809] MUST also be adhered to.
