  - "                              WEATHER DATA\nwill be ten years of high quality\
    \ surface and upper air weather\nobservations, as well as hemispheric grid point\
    \ analyses.  The\nobservations are generated by approximately 5000 surface and\n\
    1200 upper air stations, distributed all over the world.\nThe data is to be available\
    \ via the datacomputer, a specialized\nnode of the ARPA Network that is dedicated\
    \ to the management of\nshared data bases and designed to accommodate large ones.\
    \  The\ndatacomputer, currently under development by Computer Corporation\nof\
    \ America (CCA), will provide services* for the use of these\ndata bases, including\
    \ the weather data.\nA working group has been formed to design the data base,\n\
    coordinate its implementation with the development of the\ndatacomputer, plan\
    \ testing, project uses, and resolve a variety\nof technical issues associated\
    \ with its size and complexity.\nProspective users, working members, or interested\
    \ parties should\ncontact:\n            Dale H. Stern\n            Computer Corporation\
