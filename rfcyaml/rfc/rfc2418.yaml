  - "1. Introduction\n   The Internet, a loosely-organized international collaboration\
    \ of\n   autonomous, interconnected networks, supports host-to-host\n   communication\
    \ through voluntary adherence to open protocols and\n   procedures defined by\
    \ Internet Standards.  There are also many\n   isolated interconnected networks,\
    \ which are not connected to the\n   global Internet but use the Internet Standards.\
    \ Internet Standards\n   are developed in the Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF).  This\n   document defines guidelines and procedures for IETF working\
    \ groups.\n   The Internet Standards Process of the IETF is defined in [1]. The\n\
    \   organizations involved in the IETF Standards Process are described in\n  \
    \ [2] as are the roles of specific individuals.\n   The IETF is a large, open\
    \ community of network designers, operators,\n   vendors, users, and researchers\
    \ concerned with the Internet and the\n   technology used on it. The primary activities\
    \ of the IETF are\n   performed by committees known as working groups. There are\
    \ currently\n   more than 100 working groups. (See the IETF web page for an up-to-\n\
    \   date list of IETF Working Groups - http://www.ietf.org.) Working\n   groups\
    \ tend to have a narrow focus and a lifetime bounded by the\n   completion of\
    \ a specific set of tasks, although there are exceptions.\n   For management purposes,\
    \ the IETF working groups are collected\n   together into areas, with each area\
    \ having a separate focus.  For\n   example, the security area deals with the\
    \ development of security-\n   related technology.  Each IETF area is managed\
    \ by one or two Area\n   Directors (ADs).  There are currently 8 areas in the\
    \ IETF but the\n   number changes from time to time.  (See the IETF web page for\
    \ a list\n   of the current areas, the Area Directors for each area, and a list\
    \ of\n   which working groups are assigned to each area.)\n   In many areas, the\
    \ Area Directors have formed an advisory group or\n   directorate.  These comprise\
    \ experienced members of the IETF and the\n   technical community represented\
    \ by the area.  The specific name and\n   the details of the role for each group\
    \ differ from area to area, but\n   the primary intent is that these groups assist\
    \ the Area Director(s),\n   e.g., with the review of specifications produced in\
    \ the area.\n   The IETF area directors are selected by a nominating committee,\
    \ which\n   also selects an overall chair for the IETF.  The nominations process\n\
    \   is described in [3].\n   The area directors sitting as a body, along with\
    \ the IETF Chair,\n   comprise the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).\
    \ The IETF\n   Executive Director is an ex-officio participant of the IESG, as\
    \ are\n   the IAB Chair and a designated Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\n \
    \  liaison.  The IESG approves IETF Standards and approves the\n   publication\
    \ of other IETF documents.  (See [1].)\n   A small IETF Secretariat provides staff\
    \ and administrative support\n   for the operation of the IETF.\n   There is no\
    \ formal membership in the IETF.  Participation is open to\n   all.  This participation\
    \ may be by on-line contribution, attendance\n   at face-to-face sessions, or\
    \ both.  Anyone from the Internet\n   community who has the time and interest\
    \ is urged to participate in\n   IETF meetings and any of its on-line working\
    \ group discussions.\n   Participation is by individual technical contributors,\
    \ rather than by\n   formal representatives of organizations.\n   This document\
    \ defines procedures and guidelines for the formation and\n   operation of working\
    \ groups in the IETF. It defines the relations of\n   working groups to other\
    \ bodies within the IETF. The duties of working\n   group Chairs and Area Directors\
    \ with respect to the operation of the\n   working group are also defined.  When\
    \ used in this document the key\n   words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n   \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be\n   interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6].\
    \  RFC 2119 defines the use\n   of these key words to help make the intent of\
    \ standards track\n   documents as clear as possible.  The same key words are\
    \ used in this\n   document to help smooth WG operation and reduce the chance\
    \ for\n   confusion about the processes.\n"

- title: 2. Working group formation
  contents:
  - "2. Working group formation\n   IETF working groups (WGs) are the primary mechanism\
    \ for development\n   of IETF specifications and guidelines, many of which are\
    \ intended to\n   be standards or recommendations. A working group may be established\n\
    \   at the initiative of an Area Director or it may be initiated by an\n   individual\
    \ or group of individuals. Anyone interested in creating an\n   IETF working group\
    \ MUST obtain the advice and consent of the IETF\n   Area Director(s) in whose\
    \ area the working group would fall and MUST\n   proceed through the formal steps\
    \ detailed in this section.\n   Working groups are typically created to address\
    \ a specific problem or\n   to produce one or more specific deliverables (a guideline,\
    \ standards\n   specification, etc.).  Working groups are generally expected to\
    \ be\n   short-lived in nature.  Upon completion of its goals and achievement\n\
    \   of its objectives, the working group is terminated. A working group\n   may\
    \ also be terminated for other reasons (see section 4).\n   Alternatively, with\
    \ the concurrence of the IESG, Area Director, the\n   WG Chair, and the WG participants,\
    \ the objectives or assignment of\n   the working group may be extended by modifying\
    \ the working group's\n   charter through a rechartering process (see section\
    \ 5).\n"
- title: 2.1. Criteria for formation
  contents:
  - "2.1. Criteria for formation\n   When determining whether it is appropriate to\
    \ create a working group,\n   the Area Director(s) and the IESG will consider\
    \ several issues:\n    - Are the issues that the working group plans to address\
    \ clear and\n      relevant to the Internet community?\n    - Are the goals specific\
    \ and reasonably achievable, and achievable\n      within a reasonable time frame?\n\
    \    - What are the risks and urgency of the work, to determine the level\n  \
    \    of effort required?\n    - Do the working group's activities overlap with\
    \ those of another\n      working group?  If so, it may still be appropriate to\
    \ create the\n      working group, but this question must be considered carefully\
    \ by\n      the Area Directors as subdividing efforts often dilutes the\n    \
    \  available technical expertise.\n    - Is there sufficient interest within the\
    \ IETF in the working\n      group's topic with enough people willing to expend\
    \ the effort to\n      produce the desired result (e.g., a protocol specification)?\n\
    \      Working groups require considerable effort, including management\n    \
    \  of the working group process, editing of working group documents,\n      and\
    \ contributing to the document text.  IETF experience suggests\n      that these\
    \ roles typically cannot all be handled by one person; a\n      minimum of four\
    \ or five active participants in the management\n      positions are typically\
    \ required in addition to a minimum of one\n      or two dozen people that will\
    \ attend the working group meetings\n      and contribute on the mailing list.\
    \  NOTE: The interest must be\n      broad enough that a working group would not\
    \ be seen as merely the\n      activity of a single vendor.\n    - Is there enough\
    \ expertise within the IETF in the working group's\n      topic, and are those\
    \ people interested in contributing in the\n      working group?\n    - Does a\
    \ base of interested consumers (end-users) appear to exist\n      for the planned\
    \ work?  Consumer interest can be measured by\n      participation of end-users\
    \ within the IETF process, as well as by\n      less direct means.\n    - Does\
    \ the IETF have a reasonable role to play in the determination\n      of the technology?\
    \  There are many Internet-related technologies\n      that may be interesting\
    \ to IETF members but in some cases the IETF\n      may not be in a position to\
    \ effect the course of the technology in\n      the \"real world\".  This can\
    \ happen, for example, if the technology\n      is being developed by another\
    \ standards body or an industry\n      consortium.\n    - Are all known intellectual\
    \ property rights relevant to the\n      proposed working group's efforts issues\
    \ understood?\n    - Is the proposed work plan an open IETF effort or is it an\
    \ attempt\n      to \"bless\" non-IETF technology where the effect of input from\
    \ IETF\n      participants may be limited?\n    - Is there a good understanding\
    \ of any existing work that is\n      relevant to the topics that the proposed\
    \ working group is to\n      pursue?  This includes work within the IETF and elsewhere.\n\
    \    - Do the working group's goals overlap with known work in another\n     \
    \ standards body, and if so is adequate liaison in place?\n   Considering the\
    \ above criteria, the Area Director(s), using his or\n   her best judgement, will\
    \ decide whether to pursue the formation of\n   the group through the chartering\
    \ process.\n"
- title: 2.2. Charter
  contents:
  - "2.2. Charter\n   The formation of a working group requires a charter which is\n\
    \   primarily negotiated between a prospective working group Chair and\n   the\
    \ relevant Area Director(s), although final approval is made by the\n   IESG with\
    \ advice from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).  A\n   charter is a contract\
    \ between a working group and the IETF to perform\n   a set of tasks.  A charter:\n\
    \   1. Lists relevant administrative information for the working group;\n   2.\
    \ Specifies the direction or objectives of the working group and\n      describes\
    \ the approach that will be taken to achieve the goals;\n      and\n   3. Enumerates\
    \ a set of milestones together with time frames for their\n      completion.\n\
    \   When the prospective Chair(s), the Area Director and the IETF\n   Secretariat\
    \ are satisfied with the charter form and content, it\n   becomes the basis for\
    \ forming a working group. Note that an Area\n   Director MAY require holding\
    \ an exploratory Birds of a Feather (BOF)\n   meeting, as described below, to\
    \ gage the level of support for a\n   working group before submitting the charter\
    \ to the IESG and IAB for\n   approval.\n   Charters may be renegotiated periodically\
    \ to reflect the current\n   status, organization or goals of the working group\
    \ (see section 5).\n   Hence, a charter is a contract between the IETF and the\
    \ working group\n   which is committing to meet explicit milestones and delivering\n\
    \   specific \"products\".\n   Specifically, each charter consists of the following\
    \ sections:\n   Working group name\n      A working group name should be reasonably\
    \ descriptive or\n      identifiable. Additionally, the group shall define an\
    \ acronym\n      (maximum 8 printable ASCII characters) to reference the group\
    \ in\n      the IETF directories, mailing lists, and general documents.\n   Chair(s)\n\
    \      The working group may have one or more Chairs to perform the\n      administrative\
    \ functions of the group. The email address(es) of\n      the Chair(s) shall be\
    \ included.  Generally, a working group is\n      limited to two chairs.\n   Area\
    \ and Area Director(s)\n      The name of the IETF area with which the working\
    \ group is\n      affiliated and the name and electronic mail address of the\n\
    \      associated Area Director(s).\n   Responsible Area Director\n      The Area\
    \ Director who acts as the primary IESG contact for the\n      working group.\n\
    \   Mailing list\n      An IETF working group MUST have a general Internet mailing\
    \ list.\n      Most of the work of an IETF working group will be conducted on\
    \ the\n      mailing list. The working group charter MUST include:\n      1. The\
    \ address to which a participant sends a subscription request\n         and the\
    \ procedures to follow when subscribing,\n      2. The address to which a participant\
    \ sends submissions and\n         special procedures, if any, and\n      3. The\
    \ location of the mailing list archive. A message archive\n         MUST be maintained\
    \ in a public place which can be accessed via\n         FTP or via the web.\n\
    \         As a service to the community, the IETF Secretariat operates a\n   \
    \      mailing list archive for working group mailing lists. In order\n      \
    \   to take advantage of this service, working group mailing lists\n         MUST\
    \ include the address \"wg_acronym-archive@lists.ietf.org\"\n         (where \"\
    wg_acronym\" is the working group acronym) in the\n         mailing list in order\
    \ that a copy of all mailing list messages\n         be recorded in the Secretariat's\
    \ archive.  Those archives are\n         located at ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf-mail-archive.\
    \  For\n         robustness, WGs SHOULD maintain an additional archive separate\n\
    \         from that maintained by the Secretariat.\n   Description of working\
    \ group\n      The focus and intent of the group shall be set forth briefly. By\n\
    \      reading this section alone, an individual should be able to decide\n  \
    \    whether this group is relevant to their own work. The first\n      paragraph\
    \ must give a brief summary of the problem area, basis,\n      goal(s) and approach(es)\
    \ planned for the working group.  This\n      paragraph can be used as an overview\
    \ of the working group's\n      effort.\n      To facilitate evaluation of the\
    \ intended work and to provide on-\n      going guidance to the working group,\
    \ the charter must describe the\n      problem being solved and should discuss\
    \ objectives and expected\n      impact with respect to:\n         - Architecture\n\
    \         - Operations\n         - Security\n         - Network management\n \
    \        - Scaling\n         - Transition (where applicable)\n   Goals and milestones\n\
    \      The working group charter MUST establish a timetable for specific\n   \
    \   work items.  While this may be renegotiated over time, the list of\n     \
    \ milestones and dates facilitates the Area Director's tracking of\n      working\
    \ group progress and status, and it is indispensable to\n      potential participants\
    \ identifying the critical moments for input.\n      Milestones shall consist\
    \ of deliverables that can be qualified as\n      showing specific achievement;\
    \ e.g., \"Internet-Draft finished\" is\n      fine, but \"discuss via email\"\
    \ is not. It is helpful to specify\n      milestones for every 3-6 months, so\
    \ that progress can be gauged\n      easily.  This milestone list is expected\
    \ to be updated\n      periodically (see section 5).\n      An example of a WG\
    \ charter is included as Appendix A.\n"
- title: 2.3. Charter review & approval
  contents:
  - "2.3. Charter review & approval\n   Proposed working groups often comprise technically\
    \ competent\n   participants who are not familiar with the history of Internet\n\
    \   architecture or IETF processes.  This can, unfortunately, lead to\n   good\
    \ working group consensus about a bad design.  To facilitate\n   working group\
    \ efforts, an Area Director may assign a Consultant from\n   among the ranks of\
    \ senior IETF participants.  (Consultants are\n   described in section 6.)  At\
    \ the discretion of the Area Director,\n   approval of a new WG may be withheld\
    \ in the absence of sufficient\n   consultant resources.\n   Once the Area Director\
    \ (and the Area Directorate, as the Area\n   Director deems appropriate) has approved\
    \ the working group charter,\n   the charter is submitted for review by the IAB\
    \ and approval by the\n   IESG.  After a review period of at least a week the\
    \ proposed charter\n   is posted to the IETF-announce mailing list as a public\
    \ notice that\n   the formation of the working group is being considered.  At\
    \ the same\n   time the proposed charter is also posted to the \"new-work\" mailing\n\
    \   list.  This mailing list has been created to let qualified\n   representatives\
    \ from other standards organizations know about pending\n   IETF working groups.\
    \  After another review period lasting at least a\n   week the IESG MAY approve\
    \ the charter as-is, it MAY request that\n   changes be made in the charter, or\
    \ MAY decline to approve chartering\n   of the working group\n   If the IESG approves\
    \ the formation of the working group it remands\n   the approved charter to the\
    \ IETF Secretariat who records and enters\n   the information into the IETF tracking\
    \ database.  The working group\n   is announced to the IETF-announce a by the\
    \ IETF Secretariat.\n"
- title: 2.4. Birds of a Feather (BOF)
  contents:
  - "2.4. Birds of a Feather (BOF)\n   Often it is not clear whether an issue merits\
    \ the formation of a\n   working group.  To facilitate exploration of the issues\
    \ the IETF\n   offers the possibility of a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session, as\
    \ well\n   as the early formation of an email list for preliminary discussion.\n\
    \   In addition, a BOF may serve as a forum for a single presentation or\n   discussion,\
    \ without any intent to form a working group.\n   A BOF is a session at an IETF\
    \ meeting which permits \"market research\"\n   and technical \"brainstorming\"\
    .  Any individual may request permission\n   to hold a BOF on a subject. The request\
    \ MUST be filed with a relevant\n   Area Director who must approve a BOF before\
    \ it can be scheduled. The\n   person who requests the BOF may be asked to serve\
    \ as Chair of the\n   BOF.\n   The Chair of the BOF is also responsible for providing\
    \ a report on\n   the outcome of the BOF.  If the Area Director approves, the\
    \ BOF is\n   then scheduled by submitting a request to agenda@ietf.org with copies\n\
    \   to the Area Director(s). A BOF description and agenda are required\n   before\
    \ a BOF can be scheduled.\n   Available time for BOFs is limited, and BOFs are\
    \ held at the\n   discretion of the ADs for an area.  The AD(s) may require additional\n\
    \   assurances before authorizing a BOF.  For example,\n    - The Area Director\
    \ MAY require the establishment of an open email\n      list prior to authorizing\
    \ a BOF.  This permits initial exchanges\n      and sharing of framework, vocabulary\
    \ and approaches, in order to\n      make the time spent in the BOF more productive.\n\
    \    - The Area Director MAY require that a BOF be held, prior to\n      establishing\
    \ a working group (see section 2.2).\n    - The Area Director MAY require that\
    \ there be a draft of the WG\n      charter prior to holding a BOF.\n    - The\
    \ Area Director MAY require that a BOF not be held until an\n      Internet-Draft\
    \ describing the proposed technology has been\n      published so it can be used\

    \ than to discuss formation of a working group.\n   Usually the outcome of a BOF\
    \ will be one of the following:\n    - There was enough interest and focus in\

  contents:
  - "3.  Working Group Operation\n   The IETF has basic requirements for open and\
    \ fair participation and\n   for thorough consideration of technical alternatives.\
    \  Within those\n   constraints, working groups are autonomous and each determines\
    \ most\n   of the details of its own operation with respect to session\n   participation,\
    \ reaching closure, etc. The core rule for operation is\n   that acceptance or\
    \ agreement is achieved via working group \"rough\n   consensus\".  WG participants\
    \ should specifically note the\n   requirements for disclosure of conflicts of\
    \ interest in [2].\n   A number of procedural questions and issues will arise\
    \ over time, and\n   it is the function of the Working Group Chair(s) to manage\
    \ the group\n   process, keeping in mind that the overall purpose of the group\
    \ is to\n   make progress towards reaching rough consensus in realizing the\n\
    \   working group's goals and objectives.\n   There are few hard and fast rules\
    \ on organizing or conducting working\n   group activities, but a set of guidelines\
    \ and practices has evolved\n   over time that have proven successful. These are\
    \ listed here, with\n   actual choices typically determined by the working group\
    \ participants\n   and the Chair(s).\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1. Session planning\n   For coordinated, structured WG interactions, the Chair(s)\

    \   agenda should contain at least:\n   - The items for discussion;\n   - The\
    \ estimated time necessary per item; and\n   - A clear indication of what documents\
    \ the participants will need to\n     read before the session in order to be well\
    \ prepared.\n   Publication of the working group agenda shall include sending\
    \ a copy\n   of the agenda to the working group mailing list and to\n   agenda@ietf.org.\n\
    \   All working group actions shall be taken in a public forum, and wide\n   participation\
    \ is encouraged. A working group will conduct much of its\n   business via electronic\

    \ task status and progress, to\n   resolve specific issues and to direct future\
    \ activities.  IETF\n   Plenary meetings are the primary venue for these face-to-face\

    \   \"interim\" face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, or video\n   conferences\
    \ may also be held.  Interim meetings are subject to the\n   same rules for advance\
    \ notification, reporting, open participation,\n   and process, which apply to\
    \ other working group meetings.\n   All working group sessions (including those\
    \ held outside of the IETF\n   meetings) shall be reported by making minutes available.\
    \  These\n   minutes should include the agenda for the session, an account of\
    \ the\n   discussion including any decisions made, and a list of attendees. The\n\
    \   Working Group Chair is responsible for insuring that session minutes\n   are\
    \ written and distributed, though the actual task may be performed\n   by someone\
    \ designated by the Working Group Chair. The minutes shall\n   be submitted in\
    \ printable ASCII text for publication in the IETF\n   Proceedings, and for posting\

    \   Electronic mail permits the widest participation; face-to-face\n   meetings\
    \ often permit better focus and therefore can be more\n   efficient for reaching\
    \ a consensus among a core of the working group\n   participants.  In determining\
    \ the balance, the WG must ensure that\n   its process does not serve to exclude\
    \ contribution by email-only\n   participants.  Decisions reached during a face-to-face\
    \ meeting about\n   topics or issues which have not been discussed on the mailing\
    \ list,\n   or are significantly different from previously arrived mailing list\n\
    \   consensus MUST be reviewed on the mailing list.\n   IETF Meetings\n   If a\
    \ WG needs a session at an IETF meeting, the Chair must apply for\n   time-slots\
    \ as soon as the first announcement of that IETF meeting is\n   made by the IETF\
    \ Secretariat to the WG-chairs list.  Session time is\n   a scarce resource at\
    \ IETF meetings, so placing requests early will\n   facilitate schedule coordination\
    \ for WGs requiring the same set of\n   experts.\n   The application for a WG\
    \ session at an IETF meeting MUST be made to\n   the IETF Secretariat at the address\
    \ agenda@ietf.org.  Some Area\n   Directors may want to coordinate WG sessions\
    \ in their area and\n   request that time slots be coordinated through them. \
    \ If this is the\n   case it will be noted in the IETF meeting announcement. A\
    \ WG\n   scheduling request MUST contain:\n   - The working group name and full\
    \ title;\n   - The amount of time requested;\n   - The rough outline of the WG\
    \ agenda that is expected to be covered;\n   - The estimated number of people\
    \ that will attend the WG session;\n   - Related WGs that should not be scheduled\
    \ for the same time slot(s);\n     and\n   - Optionally a request can be added\
    \ for the WG session to be\n     transmitted over the Internet in audio and video.\n\
    \   NOTE: While open discussion and contribution is essential to working\n   group\
    \ success, the Chair is responsible for ensuring forward\n   progress.  When acceptable\
    \ to the WG, the Chair may call for\n   restricted participation (but not restricted\
    \ attendance!) at IETF\n   working group sessions for the purpose of achieving\
    \ progress. The\n   Working Group Chair then has the authority to refuse to grant\
    \ the\n   floor to any individual who is unprepared or otherwise covering\n  \
    \ inappropriate material, or who, in the opinion of the Chair is\n   disrupting\
    \ the WG process.  The Chair should consult with the Area\n   Director(s) if the\
    \ individual persists in disruptive behavior.\n   On-line\n   It can be quite\
    \ useful to conduct email exchanges in the same manner\n   as a face-to-face session,\
    \ with published schedule and agenda, as\n   well as on-going summarization and\
    \ consensus polling.\n   Many working group participants hold that mailing list\
    \ discussion is\n   the best place to consider and resolve issues and make decisions.\
    \ The\n   choice of operational style is made by the working group itself.  It\n\
    \   is important to note, however, that Internet email discussion is\n   possible\
    \ for a much wider base of interested persons than is\n   attendance at IETF meetings,\
    \ due to the time and expense required to\n   attend.\n   As with face-to-face\
    \ sessions occasionally one or more individuals\n   may engage in behavior on\
    \ a mailing list which disrupts the WG's\n   progress.  In these cases the Chair\
    \ should attempt to discourage the\n   behavior by communication directly with\
    \ the offending individual\n   rather than on the open mailing list.  If the behavior\
    \ persists then\n   the Chair must involve the Area Director in the issue.  As\
    \ a last\n   resort and after explicit warnings, the Area Director, with the\n\
    \   approval of the IESG, may request that the mailing list maintainer\n   block\
    \ the ability of the offending individual to post to the mailing\n   list. (If\
    \ the mailing list software permits this type of operation.)\n   Even if this\
    \ is done, the individual must not be prevented from\n   receiving messages posted\
    \ to the list.  Other methods of mailing list\n   control may be considered but\
    \ must be approved by the AD(s) and the\n   IESG.\n"
- title: 3.3. Session management
  contents:
  - "3.3. Session management\n   Working groups make decisions through a \"rough consensus\"\
    \ process.\n   IETF consensus does not require that all participants agree although\n\
    \   this is, of course, preferred.  In general, the dominant view of the\n   working\
    \ group shall prevail.  (However, it must be noted that\n   \"dominance\" is not\
    \ to be determined on the basis of volume or\n   persistence, but rather a more\
    \ general sense of agreement.) Consensus\n   can be determined by a show of hands,\
    \ humming, or any other means on\n   which the WG agrees (by rough consensus,\
    \ of course).  Note that 51%\n   of the working group does not qualify as \"rough\
    \ consensus\" and 99% is\n   better than rough.  It is up to the Chair to determine\
    \ if rough\n   consensus has been reached.\n   It can be particularly challenging\
    \ to gauge the level of consensus on\n   a mailing list.  There are two different\
    \ cases where a working group\n   may be trying to understand the level of consensus\
    \ via a mailing list\n   discussion. But in both cases the volume of messages\
    \ on a topic is\n   not, by itself, a good indicator of consensus since one or\
    \ two\n   individuals may be generating much of the traffic.\n   In the case where\
    \ a consensus which has been reached during a face-\n   to-face meeting is being\
    \ verified on a mailing list the people who\n   were in the meeting and expressed\
    \ agreement must be taken into\n   account.  If there were 100 people in a meeting\
    \ and only a few people\n   on the mailing list disagree with the consensus of\
    \ the meeting then\n   the consensus should be seen as being verified.  Note that\
    \ enough\n   time should be given to the verification process for the mailing\
    \ list\n   readers to understand and consider any objections that may be raised\n\
    \   on the list.  The normal two week last-call period should be\n   sufficient\
    \ for this.\n   The other case is where the discussion has been held entirely\
    \ over\n   the mailing list.  The determination of the level of consensus may\
    \ be\n   harder to do in this case since most people subscribed to mailing\n \
    \  lists do not actively participate in discussions on the list. It is\n   left\
    \ to the discretion of the working group chair how to evaluate the\n   level of\
    \ consensus.  The most common method used is for the working\n   group chair to\
    \ state what he or she believes to be the consensus view\n   and. at the same\
    \ time, requests comments from the list about the\n   stated conclusion.\n   The\
    \ challenge to managing working group sessions is to balance the\n   need for\
    \ open and fair consideration of the issues against the need\n   to make forward\
    \ progress.  The working group, as a whole, has the\n   final responsibility for\
    \ striking this balance.  The Chair has the\n   responsibility for overseeing\
    \ the process but may delegate direct\n   process management to a formally-designated\
    \ Facilitator.\n   It is occasionally appropriate to revisit a topic, to re-evaluate\n\
    \   alternatives or to improve the group's understanding of a relevant\n   decision.\
    \  However, unnecessary repeated discussions on issues can be\n   avoided if the\
    \ Chair makes sure that the main arguments in the\n   discussion (and the outcome)\
    \ are summarized and archived after a\n   discussion has come to conclusion. It\
    \ is also good practice to note\n   important decisions/consensus reached by email\
    \ in the minutes of the\n   next 'live' session, and to summarize briefly the\
    \ decision-making\n   history in the final documents the WG produces.\n   To facilitate\
    \ making forward progress, a Working Group Chair may wish\n   to decide to reject\
    \ or defer the input from a member, based upon the\n   following criteria:\n \
    \  Old\n   The input pertains to a topic that already has been resolved and is\n\
    \   redundant with information previously available;\n   Minor\n   The input is\
    \ new and pertains to a topic that has already been\n   resolved, but it is felt\
    \ to be of minor import to the existing\n   decision;\n   Timing\n   The input\
    \ pertains to a topic that the working group has not yet\n   opened for discussion;\

    \   available to review the work as it moves to Draft Standard and\n   Standard\
    \ status.)\n   If, at some point, it becomes evident that a working group is unable\n\
    \   to complete the work outlined in the charter, or if the assumptions\n   which\
    \ that work was based have been modified in discussion or by\n   experience, the\
    \ Area Director, in consultation with the working group\n   can either:\n   1.\
    \ Recharter to refocus its tasks,\n   2. Choose new Chair(s), or\n   3. Disband.\n\

    \ of WG business.  The Chair must ensure that a number of tasks\n   are performed,\
    \ either directly or by others assigned to the tasks.\n   The Chair has the responsibility\
    \ and the authority to make decisions,\n   on behalf of the working group, regarding\
    \ all matters of working\n   group process and staffing, in conformance with the\
    \ rules of the\n   IETF.  The AD has the authority and the responsibility to assist\
    \ in\n   making those decisions at the request of the Chair or when\n   circumstances\
    \ warrant such an intervention.\n   The Chair's responsibility encompasses at\
    \ least the following:\n   Ensure WG process and content management\n      The\
    \ Chair has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that a working\n      group achieves\
    \ forward progress and meets its milestones.  The\n      Chair is also responsible\
    \ to ensure that the working group\n      operates in an open and fair manner.\
    \  For some working groups,\n      this can be accomplished by having the Chair\
    \ perform all\n      management-related activities.  In other working groups --\n\
    \      particularly those with large or divisive participation -- it is\n    \
    \  helpful to allocate process and/or secretarial functions to other\n      participants.\
    \  Process management pertains strictly to the style\n      of working group interaction\
    \ and not to its content. It ensures\n      fairness and detects redundancy. \
    \ The secretarial function\n      encompasses document editing.  It is quite common\

    \ that discussions on the list are\n      summarized and that the outcome is well\
    \ documented (to avoid\n      repetition).  The Chair also may choose to schedule\
    \ organized on-\n      line \"sessions\" with agenda and deliverables.  These\
    \ can be\n      structured as true meetings, conducted over the course of several\n\
    \      days (to allow participation across the Internet).\n      Organize, prepare\
    \ and chair face-to-face and on-line formal\n      sessions.\n   Plan WG Sessions\n\

    \  (see section 3.1).\n   Communicate results of sessions\n      The Chair and/or\
    \ Secretary must ensure that minutes of a session\n      are taken and that an\
    \ attendance list is circulated (see section\n      3.1).\n      Immediately after\
    \ a session, the WG Chair MUST provide the Area\n      Director with a very short\
    \ report (approximately one paragraph,\n      via email) on the session.\n   Distribute\
    \ the workload\n      Of course, each WG will have participants who may not be\
    \ able (or\n      want) to do any work at all. Most of the time the bulk of the\
    \ work\n      is done by a few dedicated participants. It is the task of the\n\
    \      Chair to motivate enough experts to allow for a fair distribution\n   \
    \   of the workload.\n   Document development\n      Working groups produce documents\
    \ and documents need authors. The\n      Chair must make sure that authors of\
    \ WG documents incorporate\n      changes as agreed to by the WG (see section\
    \ 6.3).\n   Document publication\n      The Chair and/or Document Editor will\
    \ work with the RFC Editor to\n      ensure document conformance with RFC publication\
    \ requirements [5]\n      and to coordinate any editorial changes suggested by\
    \ the RFC\n      Editor.  A particular concern is that all participants are working\n\
    \      from the same version of a document at the same time.\n   Document implementations\n\
    \      Under the procedures described in [1], the Chair is responsible\n     \

  contents:
  - "7.3. Request For Comments (RFC)\n   The work of an IETF working group often results\
    \ in publication of one\n   or more documents, as part of the Request For Comments\
    \ (RFCs) [1]\n   series. This series is the archival publication record for the\n\
    \   Internet community. A document can be written by an individual in a\n   working\
    \ group, by a group as a whole with a designated Editor, or by\n   others not\
    \ involved with the IETF.\n   NOTE: The RFC series is a publication mechanism\
    \ only and publication\n   does not determine the IETF status of a document. \
    \ Status is\n   determined through separate, explicit status labels assigned by\
    \ the\n   IESG on behalf of the IETF.  In other words, the reader is reminded\n\
    \   that all Internet Standards are published as RFCs, but NOT all RFCs\n   specify\

- title: 8. Review of documents
  contents:
  - "8. Review of documents\n   The IESG reviews all documents submitted for publication\
    \ as RFCs.\n   Usually minimal IESG review is necessary in the case of a submission\n\
    \   from a WG intended as an Informational or Experimental RFC. More\n   extensive\
    \ review is undertaken in the case of standards-track\n   documents.\n   Prior\
    \ to the IESG beginning their deliberations on standards-track\n   documents,\
    \ IETF Secretariat will issue a \"Last-Call\" to the IETF\n   mailing list (see\
    \ [1]). This Last Call will announce the intention of\n   the IESG to consider\
    \ the document, and it will solicit final comments\n   from the IETF within a\
    \ period of two weeks.  It is important to note\n   that a Last-Call is intended\
    \ as a brief, final check with the\n   Internet community, to make sure that no\
    \ important concerns have been\n   missed or misunderstood. The Last-Call should\
    \ not serve as a more\n   general, in-depth review.\n   The IESG review takes\
    \ into account responses to the Last-Call and\n   will lead to one of these possible\
    \ conclusions:\n   1. The document is accepted as is for the status requested.\n\
    \      This fact will be announced by the IETF Secretariat to the IETF\n     \
    \ mailing list and to the RFC Editor.\n   2. The document is accepted as-is but\
    \ not for the status requested.\n      This fact will be announced by the IETF\
    \ Secretariat to the IETF\n      mailing list and to the RFC Editor (see [1] for\
    \ more details).\n   3. Changes regarding content are suggested to the author(s)/WG.\n\
    \      Suggestions from the IESG must be clear and direct, so as to\n      facilitate\
    \ working group and author correction of the\n      specification.  If the author(s)/WG\
    \ can explain to the\n      satisfaction of the IESG why the changes are not necessary,\
    \ the\n      document will be accepted for publication as under point 1, above.\n\
    \      If the changes are made the revised document may be resubmitted\n     \
    \ for IESG review.\n   4. Changes are suggested by the IESG and a change in status\
    \ is\n      recommended.\n      The process described above for 3 and 2 are followed\
    \ in that\n      order.\n   5. The document is rejected.\n      Any document rejection\
    \ will be accompanied by specific and\n      thorough arguments from the IESG.\
    \ Although the IETF and working\n      group process is structured such that this\
    \ alternative is not\n      likely to arise for documents coming from a working\
    \ group, the\n      IESG has the right and responsibility to reject documents\
    \ that the\n      IESG feels are fatally flawed in some way.\n      If any individual\
    \ or group of individuals feels that the review\n      treatment has been unfair,\
    \ there is the opportunity to make a\n      procedural complaint. The mechanism\
    \ for this type of complaints is\n      described in [1].\n"

    \   Before Internet telephony can become a widely deployed service, a\n   number\
    \ of protocols must be deployed. These include signaling and\n   capabilities\
    \ exchange, but also include a number of \"peripheral\"\n   protocols for providing\
    \ related services.\n   The primary purpose of this working group is to develop\
    \ two such\n   supportive protocols and a frameword document. They are:\n   1.\
    \ Call Processing Syntax. When a call is setup between two\n   endpoints, the\
    \ signaling will generally pass through several servers\n   (such as an H.323\
    \ gatekeeper) which are responsible for forwarding,\n   redirecting, or proxying\
    \ the signaling messages. For example, a user\n   may make a call to j.doe@bigcompany.com.\
    \ The signaling message to\n   initiate the call will arrive at some server at\
    \ bigcompany. This\n   server can inform the caller that the callee is busy, forward\
    \ the\n   call initiation request to another server closer to the user, or drop\n\
    \   the call completely (among other possibilities). It is very desirable\n  \
    \ to allow the callee to provide input to this process, guiding the\n   server\
    \ in its decision on how to act. This can enable a wide variety\n   of advanced\
    \ personal mobility and call agent services.\n   Such preferences can be expressed\
    \ in a call processing syntax, which\n   can be authored by the user (or generated\
    \ automatically by some\n   tool), and then uploaded to the server. The group\
    \ will develop this\n   syntax, and specify means of securely transporting and\
    \ extending it.\n   The result will be a single standards track RFC.\n   2. In\
    \ addition, the group will write a service model document, which\n   describes\
    \ the services that are enabled by the call processing\n   syntax, and discusses\
    \ how the syntax can be used. This document will\n   result in a single RFC.\n\
    \   3. Gateway Attribute Distribution Protocol. When making a call\n   between\
    \ an IP host and a PSTN user, a telephony gateway must be used.\n   The selection\
    \ of such gateways can be based on many criteria,\n   including client expressed\
    \ preferences, service provider preferences,\n   and availability of gateways,\
    \ in addition to destination telephone\n   number.  Since gateways outside of\
    \ the hosts' administrative domain\n   might be used, a protocol is required to\
    \ allow gateways in remote\n   domains to distribute their attributes (such as\
    \ PSTN connectivity,\n   supported codecs, etc.) to entities in other domains\
    \ which must make\n   a selection of a gateway. The protocol must allow for scalable,\n\
    \   bandwidth efficient, and very secure transmission of these\n   attributes.\
    \ The group will investigate and design a protocol for this\n   purpose, generate\
    \ an Internet Draft, and advance it to RFC as\n   appropriate.\n   Goals and Milestones:\n\
    \   May 98    Issue first Internet-Draft on service framework\n   Jul 98    Submit\
    \ framework ID to IESG for publication as an RFC.\n   Aug 98    Issue first Internet-Draft\
    \ on Call Processing Syntax\n   Oct 98    Submit Call processing syntax to IESG\
    \ for consideration\n             as a Proposed Standard.\n   Dec 98    Achieve\
    \ consensus on basics of gateway attribute\n             distribution protocol\n\
    \   Jan 99    Submit Gateway Attribute Distribution protocol to IESG\n       \
    \      for consideration as a RFC (info, exp, stds track TB\n"
