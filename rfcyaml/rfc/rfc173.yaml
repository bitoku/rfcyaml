  - "         Network Data Management Committee Meeting Announcement\nThe data management\
    \ discussions at the recent NWG meeting resulted in\nthe formation of a Network\
    \ Data Management Committee to be chaired by\nDoug McKay, IBM.  The purpose of\
    \ the committee, as stated in RFC 146,\nis:\n      (a)  to classify the issues\
    \ involved and to propose\n           various approaches;\n      (b)  to integrate\
    \ the hitherto independent network\n           activities that address problems\
    \ in the area of data\n           sharing; and\n      (c)  to set up and coordinate\
    \ appropriate experiments\n           to test the services developed and to evaluate\n\
    \           alternative approaches.\nAn informal meeting was held Wednesday morning,\
    \ 19 May to estab- lish an\napproach for achieving the above objectives.  The\
    \ attendees were:\n         Peggy Karp           MITRE\n         Doug McKay  \
    \         IBM\n         Tom O'Sullivan       Raytheon\n         Ari Ollikainin\
    \       UCLA\n         Dr. Larry Roberts    ARPA\n         Dick Winter       \
    \   CCA\nDue to an overlap with a file transfer committee meeting, membership\
    \ of\nthe data management committee was not established.\nA decision was made\
    \ to hold a data management meeting at CCA in\nCambridge prior to the next general\
    \ NWG meeting.  The structure and\nformat of the meeting will be similar to that\
    \ of the network graphics\nmeeting (RFC 87); that is, the price of admission for\
    \ an organization is\na working paper on one or more of the areas chosen for discussion,\n\
    accompanied by an oral presentation.\neduced, thus fulfilling the committee's\
    \ objective (a).  Compre- hensive\nplans for attaining objectives (b) and (c)\
    \ can then be established.  We\nexpect that responsibilities for carrying out\
    \ objectives (b) and (c)\nwill be assumed by interested committee members.\nOne\
    \ of the original objectives of the meeting was to elicit comments on\nthe data\
    \ language for the data computer, following a presentation of\ndesign specifications\
    \ by CCA.  Due to a change in scheduling at CCA,\nthey will discuss the facilities\
    \ to be provided by the data computer\nrather than language itself.  Therefore\
    \ meeting participants will have\nan opportunity to provide input to the language\
    \ design which will be\nspecifically directed at provision of the facilities.\n\
    \   Some suggested topics for position papers are:\n      (a)  philosophical discussion\
    \ on computer network\n           data sharing;\n      (b)  syntactic and semantic\
    \ considerations for data\n           description and access languages;\n    \
    \  (c)  approaches for the integration of data handling\n           services already\
    \ available;\n      (d)  experimentation methodology for evaluating\n        \
    \   alternative data sharing techniques;\n      (e)  information content and structure\
    \ of a network\n           data directory; and\n      (f)  operational or control\
    \ protocol.\nAny or all of the above topics can be addressed in a single paper.\n\
    Other ideas for position paper topics can be gleaned from RFC #s 144 and\n146.\
    \  Many of the comments made at the data management session, 18 May,\nat the NWG\
    \ meeting (RFC 164, pp. 26-29) can be expanded and expounded\nupon.\nPosition\
    \ papers should be submitted ti Doug McKay by 16 July (received\nno later than\
    \ 19 July).  A meeting agenda, copies of all submitted\npapers, and a background\
    \ bibliography will be distributed to all\nparticipants by 23 July.  The meeting\
    \ will be held at CCA, 565\nTechnology Square, Cambridge, Mass. from 2 August\
    \ until 4 August.  All\nparticipants should contact Marty Ginsberg, CCA (617-491-3670)\
    \ by 16\nJuly for hotel reservations.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by Simone\
    \ Demmel 5/97 ]\n"
