- title: 1.  Introduction/Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction/Background\n   Collisions in the DNS occur in multiple ways.\
    \  One common case is\n   that an organization has used a subdomain (foo) of its\
    \ primary domain\n   (example.com) for corporate infrastructure, and then the\
    \ string 'foo'\n   is delegated as a Top-Level Domain (TLD).  When an employee\
    \ of the\n   organization enters 'www.foo', is the goal to reach a machine in\
    \ the\n   internal namespace (www.foo.example.com) or the hostname 'www' in the\n\
    \   'foo' TLD?\n   This document describes a means of disambiguating this and\
    \ similar\n   cases.\n   Implementation of this method is not recommended; it\
    \ is documented\n   here to explain some of the pitfalls with such an approach.\n"
- title: 2.  Mitigation
  contents:
  - "2.  Mitigation\n   The mitigation described in this document involves presenting\n\
    \   multiple options to the user and allowing them to indicate which of\n   the\
    \ names is the one they are trying to reach.\n   The mitigation would look up\
    \ the name in multiple namespaces.  If a\n   conflict is detected, it would then\
    \ provide a means for the user to\n   indicate which one of the colliding names\
    \ they wish to connect to,\n   and return the disambiguated answer to the application.\
    \  An\n   additional feature of mitigation could be to cache the user's choice\n\
    \   and/or provide a means to set priorities.\n   This could be accomplished in\
    \ a number of ways, including:\n   o  Intercepting the resolution requests from\
    \ the application in a\n      \"shim\" type library\n   o  Replacing the resolver\
    \ library entirely\n   o  Integrating this type of mitigation into applications\
    \ (some web\n      browsers already do something similar to this)\n   o  Proxying\
    \ the request to a server that provides an interstitial\n      page that allows\
    \ the user to indicate the intended name (for\n      applications such as HTTP)\n\
    \   There are a number of issues with this solution, including but not\n   limited\
    \ to:\n   o  There may not be a human available to disambiguate the answer\n \
    \     (unattended machines, mail servers, etc.).\n   o  The human/user may have\
    \ no idea which is the correct choice,\n      especially in the case of a phishing\
    \ attack or other malicious\n      intent.\n   o  The additional latency introduced\
    \ may cause the originating\n      application to time out.\n   o  The experience\
    \ would be time consuming for users as they must\n      select each site and subsite\
    \ intended (e.g., www.intranet,\n      images.intranet, etc.).\n   o  Caching\
    \ the responses could lead to problems when the user changes\n      location (internal\
    \ sites would fail when offsite or otherwise lead\n      to incorrect sites being\
    \ loaded).\n   For these and other reasons, implementation of this technique is\
    \ not\n   recommended.\n"
- title: 3.  Implementation/Disclaimers
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementation/Disclaimers\n   This document does not reference an implementation.\
    \  Due to the\n   numerous issues described above, we do not recommend that this\n\
    \   solution be implemented.  This is a very slight mitigation, and we do\n  \
    \ not recommend that it be viewed as a solution to the namespace\n   collision\
    \ problem.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   While this method may make some users more aware\
    \ of which version of\n   a name they are going to use (and so careful users may\
    \ avoid some\n   phishing attacks), the security risks described above outweigh\
    \ this\n   potential benefit.\n   There are numerous security implications in\
    \ this approach, including\n   leaking internal names (e.g., secret-project.corp.example.com),\
    \ users\n   being tricked into selecting the incorrect choice when trying to\n\
    \   disambiguate answers, etc.\n   For these reasons, it is not recommended that\
    \ this solution be\n   deployed.\n"
