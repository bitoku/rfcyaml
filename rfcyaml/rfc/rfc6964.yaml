- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Many end-user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly\n\
    \   IPv4 internal infrastructures.  These sites range in size from small\n   home/office\
    \ networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but\n   share the commonality\
    \ that IPv4 provides satisfactory internal\n   routing and addressing services\
    \ for most applications.  As more and\n   more IPv6-only services are deployed,\
    \ however, end-user devices\n   within such sites will increasingly require at\
    \ least basic IPv6\n   functionality.  This document therefore provides operational\
    \ guidance\n   for deployment of IPv6 within predominantly IPv4 sites using the\n\
    \   Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   End-user sites in the Internet today internally use IPv4\
    \ routing and\n   addressing for core operating functions, such as web browsing,\
    \ file\n   sharing, network printing, email, teleconferencing, and numerous\n\
    \   other site-internal networking services.  Such sites typically have\n   an\
    \ abundance of public and/or private IPv4 addresses for internal\n   networking\
    \ and are separated from the public Internet by firewalls,\n   packet filtering\
    \ gateways, proxies, address translators, and other\n   site-border demarcation\
    \ devices.  To date, such sites have had little\n   incentive to enable IPv6 services\
    \ internally [RFC1687].\n   End-user sites that currently use IPv4 services internally\
    \ come in\n   endless sizes and varieties.  For example, a home network behind\
    \ a\n   Network Address Translator (NAT) may consist of a single link\n   supporting\
    \ a few laptops, printers, etc.  As a larger example, a\n   small business may\
    \ consist of one or a few offices with several\n   networks connecting considerably\
    \ larger numbers of computers,\n   routers, handheld devices, printers, faxes,\
    \ etc.  Moving further up\n   the scale, large financial institutions, major retailers,\
    \ large\n   corporations, etc., may consist of hundreds or thousands of branches\n\
    \   worldwide that are tied together in a complex global enterprise\n   network.\
    \  Additional examples include personal-area networks, mobile\n   vehicular networks,\
    \ disaster relief networks, tactical military\n   networks, various forms of Mobile\
    \ Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), etc.\n   With the proliferation of IPv6 services,\
    \ however, existing IPv4 sites\n   will increasingly require a means for enabling\
    \ IPv6 services so that\n   hosts within the site can communicate with IPv6-only\
    \ correspondents.\n   Such services must be deployable with minimal configuration\
    \ and in a\n   fashion that will not cause disruptions to existing IPv4 services.\n\
    \   The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)\n   [RFC5214]\
    \ provides a simple-to-use service that sites can deploy in\n   the near term\
    \ to meet these requirements.\n   ISATAP has also often been mentioned with respect\
    \ to IPv6 deployment\n   in enterprise networks [RFC4057] [RFC4852] [ENT-IPv6].\
    \  ISATAP can\n   therefore be considered as an IPv6 solution alternative based\
    \ on\n   candidate enterprise network characteristics.\n   This document provides\
    \ operational guidance for using ISATAP to\n   enable IPv6 services within predominantly\
    \ IPv4 sites while causing no\n   disruptions to existing IPv4 services.  The\
    \ terminology of ISATAP\n   (see [RFC5214], Section 3) applies also to this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Enabling IPv6 Services Using ISATAP
  contents:
  - "2.  Enabling IPv6 Services Using ISATAP\n   Existing sites within the Internet\
    \ will soon need to enable IPv6\n   services.  Larger sites typically obtain provider-independent\
    \ IPv6\n   prefixes from an Internet registry and advertise the prefixes into\n\
    \   the IPv6 routing system on their own behalf, i.e., they act as an\n   Internet\
    \ Service Provider (ISP) unto themselves.  Smaller sites that\n   wish to enable\
    \ IPv6 can arrange to obtain public IPv6 prefixes from\n   an ISP, where the prefixes\
    \ may be either purely native or the near-\n   native prefixes offered by the\
    \ IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 (6rd)\n   [RFC5969].  Alternatively, the site\
    \ can obtain prefixes independently\n   of an ISP, e.g., via a tunnel broker [RFC3053],\
    \ by using one of its\n   public IPv4 addresses to form a 6to4 prefix [RFC3056],\
    \ etc.  In any\n   case, after obtaining IPv6 prefixes, the site can automatically\n\
    \   enable IPv6 services internally by configuring ISATAP.\n   The ISATAP service\
    \ uses a Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA)\n   tunnel virtual interface model\
    \ [RFC2491] [RFC2529] based on IPv6-in-\n   IPv4 encapsulation [RFC4213].  The\
    \ encapsulation format can further\n   use Differentiated Services (DS) [RFC2983]\
    \ and Explicit Congestion\n   Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] mapping between the\
    \ inner and outer IP\n   headers to ensure expected per-hop behavior within well-managed\n\
    \   sites.\n   The ISATAP service is based on two node types known as advertising\n\
    \   ISATAP routers and ISATAP hosts.  (While out of scope for this\n   document,\
    \ a third node type known as non-advertising ISATAP routers\n   is defined in\
    \ [ISATAP-UPDATE].)  Each node may further have multiple\n   ISATAP interfaces\
    \ (i.e., one interface for each site) and may act as\n   an advertising ISATAP\
    \ router on some of those interfaces and a simple\n   ISATAP host on others. \
    \ Hence, the node type is considered on a per-\n   interface basis.\n   Advertising\
    \ ISATAP routers configure their ISATAP interfaces as\n   advertising router interfaces\
    \ (see [RFC4861], Section 6.2.2).  ISATAP\n   hosts configure their ISATAP interfaces\
    \ as simple host interfaces and\n   also coordinate their autoconfiguration operations\
    \ with advertising\n   ISATAP routers.  In this sense, advertising ISATAP routers\
    \ are\n   \"servers\" while ISATAP hosts are \"clients\" in the service model.\n\
    \   Advertising ISATAP routers arrange to add their IPv4 addresses to the\n  \
    \ site's Potential Router List (PRL) so that ISATAP clients can\n   discover them,\
    \ as discussed in Sections 8.3.2 and 9 of [RFC5214].\n   Alternatively, site administrators\
    \ could include IPv4 anycast\n   addresses in the PRL and assign each such address\
    \ to multiple\n   advertising ISATAP routers.  In that case, IPv4 routing within\
    \ the\n   site would direct the ISATAP client to the nearest advertising ISATAP\n\
    \   router.\n   After the PRL is published, ISATAP clients within the site can\n\
    \   automatically perform unicast IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router\n   Solicitation\
    \ (RS) / Router Advertisement (RA) exchanges with\n   advertising ISATAP routers\
    \ using IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation [RFC4861]\n   [RFC5214].  In the exchange,\
    \ the IPv4 source address of the RS and\n   the destination address of the RA\
    \ are an IPv4 address of the client,\n   while the IPv4 destination address of\
    \ the RS and the source address\n   of the RA are an IPv4 address of a server\
    \ found in the PRL.\n   Similarly, the IPv6 source address of the RS is a link-local\
    \ ISATAP\n   address that embeds the client's IPv4 address, while the source\n\
    \   address of the RA is a link-local ISATAP address that embeds the\n   server's\
    \ IPv4 address.  (The destination addresses of the RS and RA\n   may be either\
    \ the neighbor's link-local ISATAP address or a link-\n   scoped multicast address,\
    \ depending on the implementation.)\n   Following router discovery, ISATAP clients\
    \ can configure and assign\n   IPv6 addresses and/or prefixes using Stateless\
    \ Address\n   AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] [RFC5214].  While out of scope\n\
    \   for this document, use of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for\n  \
    \ IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] is also possible, pending future updates (see\n   [ISATAP-UPDATE]).\n"
- title: 3.  SLAAC Services
  contents:
  - "3.  SLAAC Services\n   Predominantly IPv4 sites can enable SLAAC services for\
    \ ISATAP clients\n   that need to communicate with IPv6 correspondents.  SLAAC\
    \ services\n   are enabled using either the \"shared\" or \"individual\" prefix\
    \ model.\n   In the shared prefix model, all advertising ISATAP routers advertise\n\
    \   a common prefix (e.g., 2001:db8::/64) to ISATAP clients within the\n   site.\
    \  In the individual prefix model, advertising ISATAP router\n   advertise individual\
    \ prefixes (e.g., 2001:db8:0:1::/64,\n   2001:db8:0:2::/64, 2001:db8:0:3::/64,\
    \ etc.)  to ISATAP clients within\n   the site.  Note that combinations of the\
    \ shared and individual prefix\n   models are also possible, in which some of\
    \ the site's ISATAP routers\n   advertise shared prefixes and others advertise\
    \ individual prefixes.\n   The following sections discuss operational considerations\
    \ for\n   enabling ISATAP SLAAC services within predominantly IPv4 sites.\n"

    \ ISATAP\n   routers advertise non-link-local IPv6 prefixes in the Prefix\n  \
    \ Information Options (PIOs) with the A flag set to 1 [RFC4861].  When\n   there\
    \ are multiple advertising ISATAP routers, the routers can\n   advertise a shared\
    \ IPv6 prefix or individual IPv6 prefixes.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  ISATAP Host Behavior\n   ISATAP hosts resolve the PRL and send RS messages\

    \   advertised prefixes with the A flag set to 1 as specified in\n   [RFC4862]\
    \ and [RFC5214], then it assigns the addresses to the ISATAP\n   interface.  The\
    \ host also assigns any of the advertised prefixes with\n   the L flag set to\
    \ 1 to the ISATAP interface.  (Note that the IPv6\n   link-local prefix fe80::/64\
    \ is always considered on-link on an ISATAP\n   interface.)\n"

    \ Network Topology Using Shared Prefix Model\n   With reference to Figure 1, advertising\
    \ ISATAP routers 'A' and 'B'\n   within the IPv4 site connect to the IPv6 Internet\
    \ either directly or\n   via a companion gateway.  The routers advertise the shared\
    \ prefix\n   2001:db8::/64 into the IPv6 Internet routing system either as a\n\
    \   singleton /64 or as part of a shorter aggregated IPv6 prefix.  For\n   the\
    \ purpose of this example, we also assume that the IPv4 site is\n   configured\
    \ within multiple IPv4 subnets -- each with an IPv4 prefix\n   length of /28.\n\
    \   Advertising ISATAP routers 'A' and 'B' both configure the IPv4\n   anycast\
    \ address 192.0.2.1 on a site-interior IPv4 interface, then\n   configure an advertising\
    \ ISATAP router interface for the site with\n   link-local ISATAP address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.1.\
    \  The site\n   administrator then places the single IPv4 address 192.0.2.1 in\
    \ the\n   site's PRL.  'A' and 'B' then both advertise the anycast address/\n\
    \   prefix into the site's IPv4 routing system so that ISATAP clients can\n  \
    \ locate the router that is topologically closest.  (Note: advertising\n   ISATAP\
    \ routers can also use individual IPv4 unicast addresses instead\n   of, or in\
    \ addition to, a shared IPv4 anycast address.  In that case,\n   the PRL will\
    \ contain multiple IPv4 addresses of advertising routers\n   -- some of which\
    \ may be anycast and others unicast.)\n   ISATAP host 'C' connects to the site\
    \ via an IPv4 interface with\n   address 192.0.2.18/28 and also configures an\
    \ ISATAP host interface\n   with link-local ISATAP address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.18\
    \ over the IPv4\n   interface.  'C' next resolves the PRL and sends an RS message\
    \ to the\n   IPv4 address 192.0.2.1, where IPv4 routing will direct it to the\n\
    \   closest of either 'A' or 'B'.  Assuming 'A' is closest, 'C' receives\n   an\
    \ RA from 'A' then configures a default IPv6 route with next-hop\n   address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.1\
    \ via the ISATAP interface and processes\n   the IPv6 prefix 2001:db8::/64 advertised\
    \ in the PIO.  If the A flag\n   is set in the PIO, 'C' uses SLAAC to automatically\
    \ configure the IPv6\n   address 2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.18 (i.e., an address with\
    \ an ISATAP\n   interface identifier) and assigns it to the ISATAP interface.\
    \  If the\n   L flag is set, 'C' also assigns the prefix 2001:db8::/64 to the\n\
    \   ISATAP interface, and the IPv6 address becomes a true ISATAP address.\n  \
    \ In the same fashion, ISATAP host 'D' configures its IPv4 interface\n   with\
    \ address 192.0.2.34/28 and configures its ISATAP interface with\n   link-local\
    \ ISATAP address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.34.  'D' next performs\n   an RS/RA exchange\
    \ that is serviced by 'B', then uses SLAAC to\n   autoconfigure the address 2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.34\
    \ and a default\n   IPv6 route with next-hop address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.1.  Finally,\
    \ IPv6\n   host 'E' connects to an IPv6 network outside of the site.  'E'\n  \
    \ configures its IPv6 interface in a manner specific to its attached\n   IPv6\
    \ link and autoconfigures the IPv6 address 2001:db8:1::1.\n   Following this autoconfiguration,\
    \ when host 'C' inside the site has\n   an IPv6 packet to send to host 'E' outside\
    \ the site, it prepares the\n   packet with source address 2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.18\
    \ and destination\n   address 2001:db8:1::1.  'C' then uses IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation\
    \ to\n   forward the packet to the IPv4 address 192.0.2.1, which will be\n   directed\
    \ to 'A' based on IPv4 routing.  'A' in turn decapsulates the\n   packet and forwards\
    \ it into the public IPv6 Internet, where it will\n   be conveyed to 'E' via normal\
    \ IPv6 routing.  In the same fashion,\n   host 'D' uses IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation\
    \ via its default router 'B'\n   to send IPv6 packets to IPv6 Internet hosts such\
    \ as 'E'.\n   When host 'E' outside the site sends IPv6 packets to ISATAP host\
    \ 'C'\n   inside the site, the IPv6 routing system may direct the packet to\n\
    \   either 'A' or 'B'.  If the site is not partitioned internally, the\n   router\
    \ that receives the packet can use ISATAP to statelessly forward\n   the packet\
    \ directly to 'C'.  If the site may be partitioned\n   internally, however, the\
    \ packet must first be forwarded to 'C's\n   serving router based on IPv6 routing\
    \ information.  This implies that,\n   in a partitioned site, the advertising\
    \ ISATAP routers must connect\n   within a full or partial mesh of IPv6 links,\
    \ and they must either run\n   a dynamic IPv6 routing protocol or configure static\
    \ routes so that\n   incoming IPv6 packets can be forwarded to the correct serving\
    \ router.\n   In this example, 'A' can configure the IPv6 route\n   2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.32/124\
    \ with the IPv6 address of the next hop\n   toward 'B' in the mesh network as\
    \ the next hop, and 'B' can configure\n   the IPv6 route 2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.16/124\
    \ with the IPv6 address of\n   the next hop toward 'A' as the next hop.  (Notice\
    \ that the /124\n   prefixes properly cover the /28 prefix of the IPv4 address\
    \ that is\n   embedded within the IPv6 address.)  In that case, when 'A' receives\
    \ a\n   packet from the IPv6 Internet with destination address\n   2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.34,\
    \ it first forwards the packet toward 'B'\n   over an IPv6 mesh link.  'B' in\
    \ turn uses ISATAP to forward the\n   packet into the site, where IPv4 routing\
    \ will direct it to 'D'.  In\n   the same fashion, when 'B' receives a packet\
    \ from the IPv6 Internet\n   with destination address 2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.18,\
    \ it first forwards\n   the packet toward 'A' over an IPv6 mesh link.  'A' then\
    \ uses ISATAP\n   to forward the packet into the site, where IPv4 routing will\
    \ direct\n   it to 'C'.\n   Finally, when host 'C' inside the site connects to\
    \ host 'D' inside\n   the site, it has the option of using the native IPv4 service\
    \ or the\n   ISATAP IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation service.  When there is operational\n\
    \   assurance that IPv4 services between the two hosts are available, the\n  \
    \ hosts may be better served to continue to use legacy IPv4 services in\n   order\
    \ to avoid encapsulation overhead and to avoid communication\n   failures due\
    \ to middleboxes in the path that filter protocol-41\n   packets [RFC4213].  If\
    \ 'C' and 'D' could be in different IPv4 network\n   partitions, however, IPv6-in-IPv4\
    \ encapsulation should be used with\n   one or both of routers 'A' and 'B' serving\
    \ as intermediate gateways.\n"

    \ ISATAP Network Topology Using\n                          Individual Prefix Model\n\
    \   With reference to Figure 2, advertising ISATAP routers 'A' and 'B'\n   within\
    \ the IPv4 site connect to the IPv6 Internet either directly or\n   via a companion\
    \ gateway.  Router 'A' advertises the individual prefix\n   2001:db8:0:1::/64\
    \ into the IPv6 Internet routing system, and router\n   'B' advertises the individual\
    \ prefix 2001:db8:0:2::/64.  The routers\n   could instead both advertise a shorter\
    \ shared prefix such as\n   2001:db8::/48 into the IPv6 routing system, but in\
    \ that case they\n   would need to configure a mesh of IPv6 links between themselves\
    \ in\n   the same fashion as described for the shared prefix model in\n   Section\
    \ 3.3.  For the purpose of this example, we also assume that\n   the IPv4 site\
    \ is configured within multiple IPv4 subnets -- each with\n   an IPv4 prefix length\
    \ of /28.\n   Advertising ISATAP routers 'A' and 'B' both configure individual\
    \ IPv4\n   unicast addresses 192.0.2.17/28 and 192.0.2.33/28 (respectively)\n\
    \   instead of, or in addition to, a shared IPv4 anycast address.  Router\n  \
    \ 'A' then configures an advertising ISATAP router interface for the\n   site\
    \ with link-local ISATAP address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.17, while\n   router 'B' configures\
    \ an advertising ISATAP router interface for the\n   site with link-local ISATAP\
    \ address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.33.  The site\n   administrator then places the IPv4\
    \ addresses 192.0.2.17 and\n   192.0.2.33 in the site's PRL.  'A' and 'B' then\
    \ both advertise their\n   IPv4 addresses into the site's IPv4 routing system.\n\
    \   ISATAP host 'C' connects to the site via an IPv4 interface with\n   address\
    \ 192.0.2.18/28 and also configures an ISATAP host interface\n   with link-local\
    \ ISATAP address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.18 over the IPv4\n   interface.  'C' next\
    \ resolves the PRL and sends an RS message to the\n   IPv4 address 192.0.2.17,\
    \ where IPv4 routing will direct it to 'A'.\n   'C' then receives an RA from 'A'\
    \ then configures a default IPv6 route\n   with next-hop address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.17\
    \ via the ISATAP interface\n   and processes the IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:0:1:/64\
    \ advertised in the PIO.\n   If the A flag is set in the PIO, 'C' uses SLAAC to\
    \ automatically\n   configure the IPv6 address 2001:db8:0:1::5efe:192.0.2.18 (i.e.,\
    \ an\n   address with an ISATAP interface identifier) and assigns it to the\n\
    \   ISATAP interface.  If the L flag is set, 'C' also assigns the prefix\n   2001:db8:0:1::/64\
    \ to the ISATAP interface, and the IPv6 address\n   becomes a true ISATAP address.\n\
    \   In the same fashion, ISATAP host 'D' configures its IPv4 interface\n   with\
    \ address 192.0.2.34/28 and configures its ISATAP interface with\n   link-local\
    \ ISATAP address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.34.  'D' next performs\n   an RS/RA exchange\
    \ that is serviced by 'B', then uses SLAAC to\n   autoconfigure the address 2001:db8:0:2::5efe:192.0.2.34\
    \ and a default\n   IPv6 route with next-hop address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.33.  Finally,\n\
    \   IPv6 host 'E' connects to an IPv6 network outside of the site.  'E'\n   configures\
    \ its IPv6 interface in a manner specific to its attached\n   IPv6 link, and it\
    \ autoconfigures the IPv6 address 2001:db8:1::1.\n   Following this autoconfiguration,\
    \ when host 'C' inside the site has\n   an IPv6 packet to send to host 'E' outside\
    \ the site, it prepares the\n   packet with source address 2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.18\
    \ and destination\n   address 2001:db8:1::1.  'C' then uses IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation\
    \ to\n   forward the packet to the IPv4 address 192.0.2.17, which will be\n  \
    \ directed to 'A' based on IPv4 routing.  'A' in turn decapsulates the\n   packet\
    \ and forwards it into the public IPv6 Internet, where it will\n   be conveyed\
    \ to 'E' via normal IPv6 routing.  In the same fashion,\n   host 'D' uses IPv6-in-IPv4\
    \ encapsulation via its default router 'B'\n   to send IPv6 packets to IPv6 Internet\
    \ hosts such as 'E'.\n   When host 'E' outside the site sends IPv6 packets to\
    \ ISATAP host 'C'\n   inside the site, the IPv6 routing system will direct the\
    \ packet to\n   'A' since 'A' advertises the individual prefix that matches 'C's\n\
    \   destination address.  'A' can then use ISATAP to statelessly forward\n   the\
    \ packet directly to 'C'.  If 'A' and 'B' both advertise the shared\n   shorter\
    \ prefix 2001:db8::/48 into the IPv6 routing system, however,\n   packets coming\
    \ from 'E' may be directed to either 'A' or 'B'.  In\n   that case, the advertising\
    \ ISATAP routers must connect within a full\n   or partial mesh of IPv6 links\
    \ the same as for the shared prefix model\n   and must either run a dynamic IPv6\
    \ routing protocol or configure\n   static routes so that incoming IPv6 packets\
    \ can be forwarded to the\n   correct serving router.\n   In this example, 'A'\
    \ can configure the IPv6 route 2001:db8:0:2::/64\n   with the IPv6 address of\
    \ the next hop toward 'B' in the mesh network\n   as the next hop, and 'B' can\
    \ configure the IPv6 route\n   2001:db8:0.1::/64 with the IPv6 address of the\
    \ next hop toward 'A' as\n   the next hop.  Then, when 'A' receives a packet from\
    \ the IPv6\n   Internet with destination address 2001:db8:0:2::5efe:192.0.2.34,\
    \ it\n   first forwards the packet toward 'B' over an IPv6 mesh link.  'B' in\n\
    \   turn uses ISATAP to forward the packet into the site, where IPv4\n   routing\
    \ will direct it to 'D'.  In the same fashion, when 'B'\n   receives a packet\
    \ from the IPv6 Internet with destination address\n   2001:db8:0:1::5efe:192.0.2.18,\
    \ it first forwards the packet toward\n   'A' over an IPv6 mesh link.  'A' then\
    \ uses ISATAP to forward the\n   packet into the site, where IPv4 routing will\
    \ direct it to 'C'.\n   Finally, when host 'C' inside the site connects to host\
    \ 'D' inside\n   the site, it has the option of using the native IPv4 service\

  contents:
  - "3.5.  SLAAC Site Administration Guidance\n   In common practice, firewalls, gateways,\
    \ and packet filtering devices\n   of various forms are often deployed in order\
    \ to divide the site into\n   separate partitions.  In both the shared and individual\
    \ prefix models\n   described above, the entire site can be represented by the\
    \ aggregate\n   IPv6 prefix assigned to the site, while each site partition can\
    \ be\n   represented by \"sliver\" IPv6 prefixes taken from the aggregate.  In\n\
    \   order to provide a simple service that does not interact poorly with\n   the\
    \ site topology, site administrators should therefore institute an\n   address\
    \ plan to align IPv6 sliver prefixes with IPv4 site partition\n   boundaries.\n\
    \   For example, in the shared prefix model in Section 3.3, the aggregate\n  \
    \ prefix is 2001:db8::/64, and the sliver prefixes are\n   2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.0/124,\
    \ 2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.16/124,\n   2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.32/124, etc.  In the\
    \ individual prefix model\n   in Section 3.4, the aggregate prefix is 2001:db8::/48,\
    \ and the sliver\n   prefixes are 2001:db8:0:0::/64, 2001:db8:0:1::/64, 2001:db8:0:2::/64,\n\
    \   etc.\n   When individual prefixes are used, site administrators can configure\n\
    \   advertising ISATAP routers to advertise different individual prefixes\n  \
    \ to different sets of clients, e.g., based on the client's IPv4 subnet\n   prefix\
    \ such that the IPv6 prefixes are congruent with the IPv4\n   addressing plan.\
    \  (For example, administrators can configure each\n   advertising ISATAP router\
    \ to provide services only to certain sets of\n   ISATAP clients through inbound\
    \ IPv6 Access Control List (ACL) entries\n   that match the IPv4 subnet prefix\
    \ embedded in the ISATAP interface\n   identifier of the IPv6 source address.)\
    \  When a shared prefix is\n   used, site administrators instead configure the\
    \ ISATAP routers to\n   advertise the shared prefix to all clients.\n   Advertising\
    \ ISATAP routers can advertise prefixes with the (A, L)\n   flags set to (1,0)\
    \ so that ISATAP clients will use SLAAC to\n   autoconfigure IPv6 addresses with\
    \ ISATAP interface identifiers from\n   the prefixes and assign them to the receiving\
    \ ISATAP interface, but\n   they will not assign the prefix itself to the ISATAP\
    \ interface.  In\n   that case, the advertising router must assign the sliver\
    \ prefix for\n   the site partition to the advertising ISATAP interface.  In this\
    \ way,\n   the advertising router considers the addresses covered by the sliver\n\
    \   prefix as true ISATAP addresses, but the ISATAP clients themselves do\n  \
    \ not.  This configuration enables a hub-and-spoke architecture, which\n   in\
    \ some cases may be augmented by route optimization based on the\n   receipt of\
    \ ICMPv6 Redirects.\n   Site administrators can implement address selection policy\
    \ rules\n   [RFC6724] through explicit configurations in each ISATAP client in\n\
    \   order to give preference to IPv4 destination addresses over\n   destination\
    \ addresses derived from one of the client's IPv6 sliver\n   prefixes.  For example,\
    \ site administrators can configure each ISATAP\n   client associated with a sliver\
    \ prefix such as\n   2001:db8::5efe:192.0.2.64/124 to add the prefix to its address\n\
    \   selection policy table with a lower precedence than the prefix\n   ::ffff:0:0/96.\
    \  In this way, IPv4 addresses are preferred over IPv6\n   addresses from within\
    \ the same sliver.  The prefix could be added to\n   each ISATAP client either\
    \ manually or through an automated service\n   such as a DHCP option [ADDR-SELECT]\
    \ discovered by the client, e.g.,\n   using Stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736].  In this\
    \ way, clients will use IPv4\n   communications to reach correspondents within\
    \ the same IPv4 site\n   partition and will use IPv6 communications to reach correspondents\
    \ in\n   other partitions and/or outside of the site.\n   It should be noted that\
    \ sliver prefixes longer than /64 cannot be\n   advertised for SLAAC purposes.\
    \  Also, sliver prefixes longer than /64\n   do not allow for interface identifier\
    \ rewriting by address\n   translators.  These factors may favor the individual\
    \ prefix model in\n   some deployment scenarios, while the flexibility afforded\
    \ by the\n   shared prefix model may be more desirable in others.  Additionally,\n\
    \   if the network is small, then the shared prefix model works well.  If\n  \
    \ the network is large, however, a better alternative may be to deploy\n   separate\
    \ ISATAP routers in each partition and have each advertise its\n   own individual\
    \ prefix.\n   Finally, site administrators should configure ISATAP routers to\
    \ not\n   send ICMPv6 Redirect messages to inform a source client of a better\n\
    \   next hop toward the destination unless there is strong assurance that\n  \
    \ the client and the next hop are within the same IPv4 site partition.\n"

    \ set the \"u\" bit to 0.\n   Implementations interpret the ISATAP interface identifier\

    \ cases, filtering\n   rules (e.g., within filtering tables at site-border firewalls)\
    \ may\n   also require renumbering, but this operation can be automated and\n\
    \   limited to only one or a few administrative \"touch points\".\n   In order\
    \ to renumber the ISATAP interfaces of clients within the site\n   using SLAAC,\
    \ advertising ISATAP routers need only schedule the\n   services offered by the\
    \ old ISP for deprecation and begin to\n   advertise the IPv6 prefixes provided\
    \ by the new ISP.  Lifetimes of\n   ISATAP client interface addresses will eventually\
    \ expire, and the\n   host will renumber its interfaces with addresses derived\
    \ from the new\n   prefixes.  ISATAP clients should also eventually remove any\n\
    \   deprecated SLAAC prefixes from their address selection policy tables,\n  \
    \ but this action is not time-critical.\n   Finally, site renumbering in the event\
    \ of a change in an ISP-served\n   IPv6 prefix further entails locating and rewriting\
    \ all IPv6 addresses\n   in naming services, databases, configuration files, packet\
    \ filtering\n   rules, documentation, etc.  If the site has published the IPv6\n\
    \   addresses of any site-internal nodes within the public Internet DNS\n   system,\
    \ then the corresponding resource records will also need to be\n   updated during\
    \ the renumbering operation.  This can be accomplished\n   via secure dynamic\
    \ updates to the DNS.\n"

  - "7.  Path MTU Considerations\n   IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation overhead effectively\
    \ reduces the size of\n   IPv6 packets that can traverse the tunnel in relation\
    \ to the actual\n   Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the underlying IPv4 network\
    \ path\n   between the tunnel ingress and egress.  Two methods for accommodating\n\
    \   IPv6 path MTU discovery over IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels (i.e., the static\n   and\
    \ dynamic methods) are documented in Section 3.2 of [RFC4213].\n   The static\
    \ method places a \"safe\" upper bound on the size of IPv6\n   packets permitted\
    \ to enter the tunnel; however, the method can be\n   overly conservative when\
    \ larger IPv4 path MTUs are available.  The\n   dynamic method can accommodate\
    \ much larger IPv6 packet sizes in some\n   cases, but can fail silently if the\
    \ underlying IPv4 network path does\n   not return the necessary error messages.\n\
    \   This document notes that sites that include well-managed IPv4 links,\n   routers,\
    \ and other network middleboxes are candidates for use of the\n   dynamic MTU\
    \ determination method, which may provide for a better\n   operational IPv6 experience\
    \ in the presence of IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels.\n   Finally, since all ISATAP tunnels\
    \ terminate at a host, transport\n   protocols that perform packet-size negotiations\
    \ will see an IPv6 MTU\n   that accounts for the encapsulation headers and therefore\
    \ will avoid\n   sending encapsulated packets that exceed the IPv4 path MTU.\n"

  - "8.  Alternative Approaches\n   [RFC4554] proposes a use of VLANs for IPv4-IPv6\
    \ coexistence in\n   enterprise networks.  The ISATAP approach provides a more\
    \ flexible\n   and broadly applicable alternative and with fewer administrative\n\
    \   touch points.\n   The tunnel broker service [RFC3053] uses point-to-point\
    \ tunnels that\n   require end users to establish an explicit administrative\n\
    \   configuration of the tunnel's far end, which may be outside of the\n   administrative\
    \ boundaries of the site.\n   6to4 [RFC3056] and Teredo [RFC4380] provide \"last\
    \ resort\" unmanaged\n   automatic tunneling services when no other means for\
    \ IPv6\n   connectivity is available.  These services are given lower priority\n\
    \   when the ISATAP managed service and/or native IPv6 services are\n   enabled.\n\
    \   6rd [RFC5969] enables a stateless prefix delegation capability based\n   on\
    \ IPv4-embedded IPv6 prefixes, whereas ISATAP enables a stateful\n   prefix delegation\
    \ capability based on native IPv6 prefixes.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   In addition to the security considerations documented\
    \ in [RFC5214],\n   sites that use ISATAP should take care to ensure that no routing\n\

    \ are documented in [RFC6169].\n"
