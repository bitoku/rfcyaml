    \ currently undergoing a transition to an environment in\nwhich network resources\
    \ will be made available to a larger user base.\nThis emergent user base already\
    \ contains a significant number of\nterminal users not associated with a server\
    \ site.  Information relative\nto network host services and access characteristics\
    \ is needed to\nencourage and assist new users.\nTo date, the Resources Notebook\
    \ has been the primary outlet for efforts\nto provide users with Network-wide\
    \ information. A separate RFC, from the\nNIC, discusses the past and current history\
    \ more completely. In this\nWorking Group concerned with User Information and\
    \ Services, and we would\nlike to offer a specific suggestion for consideration\
    \ at the NIC's\nproposed meeting.\nPROPOSAL\nMany of the problems associated with\
    \ the lack of adequate Network\ninformation are caused by the many compilation\
    \ steps. Too many resources\n(most of them human) are required. In addition to\
    \ delay, errors are\nintroduced. Part of the solution is to place the acquisition\
    \ of basic\ninformation closer to the source and make the source responsible for\
    \ the\nacquisition and maintenance.\n    The \"source\" is distributed around\
    \ the Network and, therefore, the\n    proposal is to develop and implement a\
    \ distributed and extensible\n    network data-base which contains the desired\
    \ information.  This\n    would require each server site to create and maintain\
    \ an information\n    file locally and/or at the NIC. As a further (more down\
    \ stream)\n    step, a mechanism to access these files could be specified and\n\
    \    implemented.\n        People at different sites would thereby be able to\
    \ use the tools\n        most comfortable and accessible to them.\n        An\
    \ interesting technical issue involves making the disparate\n        files accessible\
    \ by an automaton.  The NIC is currently\n        attempting to smooth out the\
    \ interface between NLS and non-NLS\n        files, and this seems like a reasonable\
    \ object for such efforts.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
    \ for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with   \
    \ ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n"
