The present document registers a media type for the Open eBook Publication Structure (OEBPS)
The OPF file is an XML file that describes an OEBPS Publication [OEBPS].
It identifies all other files in the publication and provides descriptive information about them.
OPF and its related standards are maintained and defined by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).
The media type defined here is needed to correctly identify OPF files when they are edited on disk, referenced in OEBPS Container files, or used in other places where media types are used.
well formed XML conforming to the XML 1.0 specification.
Clearly, it is possible to author malicious files which, for example, contain malformed data.
Most XML parsers protect themselves from such attacks by rigorously enforcing conformance.
All processors that read OPF files should rigorously check the size and validity of data retrieved.
There is no current provision in the OEBPS Package File standard for encryption, signing, or authentication within the file format.
IANA Considerations IANA has registered the media type application/oebps package xml as specified in Section 3.1.
The registration uses the template present in [RFC4288].
OPF files are UTF 8 or UTF 16 encoded XML Security considerations:
