  - "1.  Introduction\n   As IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology matures, large\
    \ scale\n   deployment of WLAN networks is highlighting certain technical\n  \
    \ challenges.  As outlined in [2], management, monitoring, and control\n   of\
    \ large number of Access Points (APs) in the network may prove to be\n   a significant\
    \ burden for network administration.  Distributing and\n   maintaining a consistent\
    \ configuration throughout the entire set of\n   APs in the WLAN is a difficult\
    \ task.  The shared and dynamic nature\n   of the wireless medium also demands\
    \ effective coordination among the\n   APs to minimize radio interference and\
    \ maximize network performance.\n   Network security issues, which have always\
    \ been a concern in WLANs,\n   present even more challenges in large deployments\
    \ and new\n   architectures.\n   Recently many vendors have begun offering partially\
    \ proprietary\n   solutions to address some or all of the above mentioned problems.\n\
    \   Since interoperable systems allow for a broader choice of solutions,\n   a\
    \ standardized interoperable solution addressing the aforementioned\n   problems\
    \ is desirable.  As the first step toward establishing\n   interoperability in\
    \ the market place, this document provides a\n   taxonomy of the architectures\
    \ employed in existing WLAN products.  We\n   hope to provide a cohesive understanding\
    \ of the market practices for\n   the standard bodies involved (including the\
    \ IETF and IEEE 802.11).\n   This document may be reviewed and utilized by the\
    \ IEEE 802.11 Working\n   Group as input in defining the functional architecture\
    \ of an AP.\n"
- title: 1.1.  IEEE 802.11 WLAN Functions
  contents:
  - "1.1.  IEEE 802.11 WLAN Functions\n   The IEEE 802.11 specifications are wireless\
    \ standards that specify an\n   \"over-the-air\" interface between a wireless\
    \ client Station (STA) and\n   an Access Point (AP), and also among wireless clients.\
    \  802.11 also\n   describes how mobile devices can associate into a basic service\
    \ set\n   (BSS).  A BSS is identified by a basic service set identifier (BSSID)\n\
    \   or name.  The WLAN architecture can be considered as a type of 'cell'\n  \
    \ architecture, in which each cell is the Basic Service Set (BSS), and\n   each\
    \ BSS is controlled by the AP.  When two or more APs are connected\n   via a broadcast\
    \ layer 2 network and all are using the same SSID, an\n   extended service set\
    \ (ESS) is created.\n   The architectural component used to interconnect BSSs\
    \ is the\n   distribution system (DS).  An AP is an STA that provides access to\n\
    \   the DS by providing DS services, as well as acting as an STA.\n   Another\
    \ logical architectural component, portal, is introduced to\n   integrate the\
    \ IEEE 802.11 architecture with a traditional wired LAN.\n   It is possible for\
    \ one device to offer both the functions of an AP\n   and a portal.\n   IEEE 802.11\
    \ does not specify the details of DS implementations\n   explicitly.  Instead,\
    \ the 802.11 standard defines services that\n   provide functions that the LLC\
    \ layer requires for sending MAC Service\n   Data Units (MSDUs) between two entities\
    \ on the network.  These\n   services can be classified into two categories: the\
    \ station service\n   (SS) and the distribution system service (DSS).  Both categories\
    \ of\n   service are used by the IEEE 802.11 MAC sublayer.  Station services\n\
    \   consist of the following four services:\n   o  Authentication: Establishes\
    \ the identity of one station as a\n      member of the set of stations that are\
    \ authorized to associate\n      with one another.\n   o  De-authentication: Voids\
    \ an existing authentication relationship.\n   o  Confidentiality: Prevents the\
    \ content of messages from being read\n      by others than the intended recipients.\n\
    \   o  MSDU Delivery: Delivers the MAC service data unit (MSDU) for the\n    \
    \  stations.\n      Distribution system services consist of the following five\n\
    \      services:\n   o  Association: Establishes Access Point/Station (AP/STA)\
    \ mapping and\n      enables STA invocation of the distribution system services.\n\
    \   o  Disassociation: Removes an existing association.\n   o  Reassociation:\
    \ Enables an established association (between AP and\n      STA) to be transferred\
    \ from one AP to another or the same AP.\n   o  Distribution: Provides MSDU forwarding\
    \ by APs for the STAs\n      associated with them.  MSDUs can be either forwarded\
    \ to the\n      wireless destination or to the wired (Ethernet) destination (or\n\
    \      both) using the \"Distribution System\" concept of 802.11.\n   o  Integration:\
    \ Translates the MSDU received from the Distribution\n      System to a non-802.11\
    \ format and vice versa.  Any MSDU that is\n      received from the DS invokes\
    \ the 'Integration' services of the DSS\n      before the 'Distribution' services\
    \ are invoked.  The point of\n      connection of the DS to the wired LAN is termed\
    \ as 'portal'.\n   Apart from these services, the IEEE 802.11 also defines additional\n\
    \   MAC services that must be implemented by the APs in the WLAN.  For\n   example:\n\
    \   o  Beacon Generation\n   o  Probe Response/Transmission\n   o  Processing\
    \ of Control Frames: RTS/CTS/ACK/PS-Poll/CF-End/CF-ACK\n   o  Synchronization\n\
    \   o  Retransmissions\n   o  Transmission Rate Adaptation\n   o  Privacy: 802.11\
    \ Encryption/Decryption\n   In addition to the services offered by the 802.11,\
    \ the IEEE 802.11 WG\n   is also developing technologies to support Quality of\
    \ Service\n   (802.11e), Security Algorithms (802.11i), Inter-AP Protocol (IAPP,\
    \ or\n   802.11F -- recommended practice) to update APs when a STA roams from\n\
    \   one BSS to another, Radio Resource Measurement Enhancements\n   (802.11k),\
    \ etc.\n   IEEE 802.11 does not specify exactly how these functions are\n   implemented,\
    \ nor does it specify that they be implemented in one\n   physical device.  It\
    \ only requires that the APs and the rest of the\n   DS together implement all\
    \ these services.  Typically, vendors\n   implement not only the services defined\
    \ in the IEEE 802.11 standard,\n   but also a variety of value-added services\
    \ or functions, such as load\n   balancing support, QoS, station mobility support,\
    \ and rogue AP\n   detection.  What becomes clear from this document is that vendors\n\
    \   take advantage of the flexibility in the 802.11 architecture, and\n   have\
    \ come up with many different flavors of architectures and\n   implementations\
    \ of the WLAN services.\n   Because many vendors choose to implement these WLAN\
    \ services across\n   multiple network elements, we want to make a clear distinction\n\
    \   between the logical WLAN access network functions and the individual\n   physical\
    \ devices by adopting different terminology.  We use \"AP\" to\n   refer to the\
    \ logical entity that provides access to the distribution\n   services, and \"\
    WTP\" (Wireless Termination Point) to the physical\n   device that allows the\
    \ RF antenna and 802.11 PHY to transmit and\n   receive station traffic in the\
    \ BSS network.  In the Centralized\n   Architecture (see section 5), the combination\
    \ of WTPs with Access\n   Controller (AC) implements all the logical functions.\
    \  Each of these\n   physical devices (WTP or AC) may implement only part of the\
    \ logical\n   functions.  But the DS, including all the physical devices as a\n\
    \   whole, implements all or most of the functions.\n"
- title: 1.2.  CAPWAP Functions
  contents:
  - "1.2.  CAPWAP Functions\n   To address the four problems identified in [2] (management,\n\
    \   consistent configuration, RF control, security) additional functions,\n  \
    \ especially in the control and management plane, are typically offered\n   by\
    \ vendors to assist in better coordination and control across the\n   entire ESS\
    \ network.  Such functions are especially important when the\n   IEEE 802.11 WLAN\
    \ functions are implemented over multiple entities in\n   a large scale network,\
    \ instead of within a single entity.  Such\n   functions include:\n   o  RF monitoring,\
    \ such as Radar detection, noise and interference\n      detection, and measurement.\n\
    \   o  RF configuration, e.g., for retransmission, channel selection,\n      transmission\
    \ power adjustment.\n   o  WTP configuration, e.g., for SSID.\n   o  WTP firmware\
    \ loading, e.g., automatic loading and upgrading of WTP\n      firmware for network\
    \ wide consistency.\n   o  Network-wide STA state information database, including\
    \ the\n      information needed to support value-added services, such as\n   \
    \   mobility and load balancing.\n   o  Mutual authentication between network\
    \ entities, e.g., for AC and\n      WTP authentication in a Centralized WLAN Architecture.\n\
    \   The services listed are concerned with the configuration and control\n   of\
    \ the radio resource ('RF Monitoring' and 'RF Configuration'),\n   management\
    \ and configuration of the WTP device ('WTP Configuration',\n   'WTP Firmware\
    \ upgrade'), and also security regarding the registration\n   of the WTP to an\
    \ AC ('AC/WTP mutual authentication').  Moreover, the\n   device from which other\
    \ services, such as mobility management across\n   subnets and load balancing,\
    \ can obtain state information regarding\n   the STA(s) associated with the wireless\
    \ network, is also reported as\n   a service ('STA state info database').\n  \
    \ The above list of CAPWAP functions is not an exhaustive enumeration\n   of all\
    \ additional services offered by vendors.  We included only\n   those functions\
    \ that are commonly represented in the survey data, and\n   are pertinent to understanding\
    \ the central problem of\n   interoperability.\n   Most of these functions are\
    \ not explicitly specified by IEEE 802.11,\n   but some of the functions are.\
    \  For example, the control and\n   management of the radio-related functions\
    \ of an AP are described\n   implicitly in the MIB, such as:\n   o  Channel Assignment\n\
    \   o  Transmit Power Control\n   o  Radio Resource Measurement (work is currently\
    \ under way in IEEE\n      802.11k)\n   The 802.11h [5] amendment to the base\
    \ 802.11 standard specifies the\n   operation of a MAC management protocol to\
    \ accomplish the requirements\n   of some regulatory bodies (principally in Europe,\
    \ but expanding to\n   others) in the following areas:\n   o  RADAR detection\n\
    \   o  Transmit Power Control\n   o  Dynamic Channel Selection\n"
- title: 1.3.  WLAN Architecture Proliferation
  contents:
  - "1.3.  WLAN Architecture Proliferation\n   This document provides a taxonomy of\
    \ the WLAN network architectures\n   developed by the vendor community in an attempt\
    \ to address some or\n   all of the problems outlined in [2].  As the IEEE 802.11\
    \ standard\n   purposely avoids specifying the details of DS implementations,\n\
    \   different architectures have proliferated in the market.  While all\n   these\
    \ different architectures conform to the IEEE 802.11 standard as\n   a whole,\
    \ their individual functional components are not standardized.\n   Interfaces\
    \ between the network architecture components are mostly\n   proprietary, and\
    \ there is no guarantee of cross-vendor\n   interoperability of products, even\
    \ within the same family of\n   architectures.\n   To achieve interoperability\
    \ in the market place, the IETF CAPWAP\n   working group is first documenting\
    \ both the functions and the network\n   architectures currently offered by the\
    \ existing WLAN vendors.  The\n   end result is this taxonomy document.\n   After\
    \ analyzing more than a dozen different vendors' architectures,\n   we believe\
    \ that the existing 802.11 WLAN access network architectures\n   can be broadly\
    \ categorized into three distinct families, based on the\n   characteristics of\
    \ the Distribution Systems that are employed to\n   provide the 802.11 functions.\n\
    \   o  Autonomous WLAN Architecture: The first architecture family is the\n  \
    \    traditional autonomous WLAN architecture, in which each WTP is a\n      single\
    \ physical device that implements all the 802.11 services,\n      including both\
    \ the distribution and integration services, and the\n      portal function. \
    \ Such an AP architecture is called Autonomous\n      WLAN Architecture because\
    \ each WTP is autonomous in its\n      functionality, and no explicit 802.11 support\
    \ is needed from\n      devices other than the WTP.  In such architecture, the\
    \ WTP is\n      typically configured and controlled individually, and can be\n\
    \      monitored and managed via typical network management protocols\n      like\
    \ SNMP.  The WTPs are the traditional APs with which most\n      people are familiar.\
    \  Such WTPs are sometimes referred to as \"Fat\n      APs\" or \"Standalone APs\"\
    .\n   o  Centralized WLAN Architecture: The second WLAN architecture family\n\
    \      is an emerging hierarchical architecture utilizing one or more\n      centralized\
    \ controllers for managing a large number of WTP\n      devices.  The centralized\
    \ controller is commonly referred to as an\n      Access Controller (AC), whose\
    \ main function is to manage, control,\n      and configure the WTP devices that\
    \ are present in the network.  In\n      addition to being a centralized entity\
    \ for the control and\n      management plane, it may also become a natural aggregation\
    \ point\n      for the data plane since it is typically situated in a centralized\n\
    \      location in the wireless access network.  The AC is often co-\n      located\
    \ with an L2 bridge, a switch, or an L3 router, and may be\n      referred to\
    \ as Access Bridge or Access Router in those particular\n      cases.  Therefore,\
    \ an Access Controller could be either an L3 or\n      L2 device, and is the generic\
    \ term we use throughout this\n      document.  It is also possible that multiple\
    \ ACs are present in a\n      network for purposes of redundancy, load balancing,\
    \ etc.  This\n      architecture family has several distinct characteristics that\
    \ are\n      worth noting.  First, the hierarchical architecture and the\n   \
    \   centralized AC affords much better manageability for large scale\n      networks.\
    \  Second, since the IEEE 802.11 functions and the CAPWAP\n      control functions\
    \ are provided by the WTP devices and the AC\n      together, the WTP devices\
    \ themselves may no longer fully implement\n      the 802.11 functions as defined\
    \ in the standards.  Therefore, it\n      can be said that the full 802.11 functions\
    \ are implemented across\n      multiple physical network devices, namely, the\
    \ WTPs and ACs.\n      Since the WTP devices only implement a portion of the functions\n\
    \      that standalone APs implement, WTP devices in this architecture\n     \
    \ are sometimes referred to as light weight or thin APs.\n   o  Distributed WLAN\
    \ Architecture: The third emerging WLAN\n      architecture family is the distributed\
    \ architecture in which the\n      participating wireless nodes are capable of\
    \ forming a distributed\n      network among themselves, via wired or wireless\
    \ media.  A wireless\n      mesh network is one example within the distributed\
    \ architecture\n      family, where the nodes themselves form a mesh network and\
    \ connect\n      with neighboring mesh nodes via 802.11 wireless links.  Some\
    \ of\n      these nodes also have wired Ethernet connections acting as\n     \
    \ gateways to the external network.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Taxonomy Methodology and Document Organization
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Taxonomy Methodology and Document Organization\n   Before the IETF CAPWAP\
    \ working group started documenting the various\n   WLAN architectures, we conducted\
    \ an open survey soliciting WLAN\n   architecture descriptions via the IETF CAPWAP\
    \ mailing list.  We\n   provided the interested parties with a common template\
    \ that included\n   a number of questions about their WLAN architectures.  We\
    \ received 16\n   contributions in the form of short text descriptions answering\
    \ those\n   questions.  15 of them are from WLAN vendors (AireSpace, Aruba,\n\
    \   Avaya, Chantry Networks, Cisco, Cranite Systems, Extreme Networks,\n   Intoto,\
    \ Janusys Networks, Nortel, Panasonic, Trapeze, Instant802,\n   Strix Systems,\
    \ Symbol) and one from the academic research community\n   (UCLA).  Out of the\
    \ 16 contributions, one describes an Autonomous\n   WLAN Architecture, three are\
    \ Distributed Mesh Architectures, and the\n   remaining twelve entries represent\
    \ architectures in the family of the\n   Centralized WLAN Architecture.\n   The\
    \ main objective of this survey was to identify the general\n   categories and\
    \ trends in WLAN architecture evolution, discover their\n   common characteristics,\
    \ and determine what is performed differently\n   among them and why.  In order\
    \ to represent the survey data in a\n   compact format, a \"Functional Distribution\
    \ Matrix\" is used in this\n   document, (mostly in the Centralized WLAN architecture\
    \ section), to\n   tabulate the various services and functions in the vendors'\n\
    \   offerings.  These services and functions are classified into three\n   main\
    \ categories:\n   o  Architecture Considerations: The choice of the connectivity\n\
    \      between the AC and the WTP.  The design choices regarding the\n      physical\
    \ device on which processing of management, control, and\n      data frames of\
    \ the 802.11 takes place.\n   o  802.11 Functions: As described in Section 1.1.\n\
    \   o  CAPWAP Functions: As described in Section 1.2.\n   For each one of these\
    \ categories, the mapping of each individual\n   function to network entities\
    \ implemented by each vendor is shown in\n   tabular form.  The rows in the Functional\
    \ Distribution Matrix\n   represent individual functions that are organized into\
    \ the above\n   mentioned three categories.  Each column of the Matrix represents\
    \ one\n   vendor's architecture offering in the survey data.  See Figure 7 as\n\
    \   an example of the Matrix.\n   This Functional Distribution Matrix is intended\
    \ for the sole purpose\n   of organizing the architecture taxonomy data, and represents\
    \ the\n   contributors' views of their architectures from an engineering\n   perspective.\
    \  It does not necessarily imply that a product exists or\n   will be shipped,\
    \ nor an intent by the vendor to build such a product.\n   The next section provides\
    \ a list of definitions used in this\n   document.  The rest of this document\
    \ is organized around the three\n   broad WLAN architecture families that were\
    \ introduced in Section 1.3.\n   Each architecture family is discussed in a separate\
    \ section.  The\n   section on Centralized Architecture contains more in-depth\
    \ details\n   than the other two families, largely due to the large number of\

- title: 3.2.  Terminology Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Terminology Used in This Document\n   One of the motivations in defining\
    \ new terminology is to clarify\n   ambiguity and confusion surrounding some conventional\
    \ terms.  One\n   such term is \"Access Point (AP)\".  Typically, when people\
    \ talk about\n   \"AP\", they refer to the physical entity (box) that has an antenna,\n\
    \   implements 802.11 PHY, and receives/transmits the station (STA)\n   traffic\
    \ over the air.  However, the 802.11 Standard [1] describes the\n   AP mostly\
    \ as a logical entity that implements a set of logical\n   services so that station\
    \ traffic can be received and transmitted\n   effectively over the air.  When\
    \ people refer to \"AP functions\", they\n   usually mean the logical functions\
    \ the whole WLAN access network\n   supports, and not just the subset of functions\
    \ supported by the\n   physical entity (box) that the STAs communicate with directly.\
    \  Such\n   confusion can be especially acute when logical functions are\n   implemented\
    \ across a network instead of within a single physical\n   entity.  To avoid further\
    \ confusion, we define the following\n   terminology:\n   CAPWAP: Control and\
    \ Provisioning of Wireless Access Points\n   IEEE 802.11 WLAN Functions: A set\
    \ of logical functions defined by the\n   IEEE 802.11 Working Group, including\
    \ all the MAC services, Station\n   Services, and Distribution Services.  These\
    \ logical functions are\n   required to be implemented in the IEEE 802.11 Wireless\
    \ LAN (WLAN)\n   access networks by the IEEE 802.11 Standard [1].\n   CAPWAP Functions:\
    \ A set of WLAN control functions that are not\n   directly defined by IEEE 802.11\
    \ Standards, but deemed essential for\n   effective control, configuration, and\
    \ management of 802.11 WLAN\n   access networks.\n   Wireless Termination Point\
    \ (WTP): The physical or network entity that\n   contains an RF antenna and 802.11\
    \ PHY to transmit and receive station\n   traffic for the IEEE 802.11 WLAN access\
    \ networks.  Such physical\n   entities were often called \"Access Points\" (AP),\
    \ but \"AP\" can also\n   refer to the logical entity that implements 802.11 services.\
    \  We\n   recommend \"WTP\" as the generic term that explicitly refers to the\n\
    \   physical entity with the above property (e.g., featuring an RF\n   antenna\
    \ and 802.11 PHY), applicable to network entities of both\n   Autonomous and Centralized\
    \ WLAN Architecture (see below).\n   Autonomous WLAN Architecture: The WLAN access\
    \ network architecture\n   family in which all the logical functions, including\
    \ both IEEE 802.11\n   and CAPWAP functions (wherever applicable), are implemented\
    \ within\n   each Wireless Termination Point (WTP) in the network.  The WTPs in\n\
    \   such networks are also called standalone APs, or fat APs, because\n   these\
    \ devices implement the full set of functions that enable the\n   devices to operate\
    \ without any other support from the network.\n   Centralized WLAN Architecture:\
    \ The WLAN access network architecture\n   family in which the logical functions,\
    \ including both IEEE 802.11 and\n   CAPWAP functions (wherever applicable), are\
    \ implemented across a\n   hierarchy of network entities.  At the lower level\
    \ are the WTPs,\n   while at the higher level are the Access Controllers (ACs),\
    \ which are\n   responsible for controlling, configuring, and managing the entire\n\
    \   WLAN access network.\n   Distributed WLAN Architecture: The WLAN access network\
    \ architecture\n   family in which some of the control functions (e.g., CAPWAP\n\
    \   functions) are implemented across a distributed network consisting of\n  \
    \ peer entities.  A wireless mesh network can be considered an example\n   of\
    \ such an architecture.\n   Access Controller (AC): The network entity in the\
    \ Centralized WLAN\n   Architecture that provides WTPs access to the centralized\n\
    \   hierarchical network infrastructure in the data plane, control plane,\n  \
    \ management plane, or a combination therein.\n   Standalone WTP: Refers to the\
    \ WTP in Autonomous WLAN Architecture.\n   Controlled WTP: Refers to the WTP in\
    \ Centralized WLAN Architecture.\n   Split MAC Architecture: A subgroup of the\
    \ Centralized WLAN\n   Architecture whereby WTPs in such WLAN access networks\
    \ only implement\n   the delay sensitive MAC services (including all control frames\
    \ and\n   some management frames) for IEEE 802.11, while all the remaining\n \
    \  management and data frames are tunnelled to the AC for centralized\n   processing.\
    \  The IEEE 802.11 MAC, as defined by IEEE 802.11 Standards\n   in [1], is effectively\
    \ split between the WTP and AC.\n   Remote MAC Architecture: A subgroup of the\
    \ Centralized WLAN\n   Architecture, where the entire set of 802.11 MAC functions\
    \ (including\n   delay-sensitive functions) is implemented at the AC.  The WTP\n\
    \   terminates the 802.11 PHY functions.\n   Local MAC Architecture: A subgroup\
    \ of the Centralized WLAN\n   Architecture, where the majority or entire set of\
    \ 802.11 MAC\n   functions (including most of the 802.11 management frame processing)\n\
    \   are implemented at the WTP.  Therefore, the 802.11 MAC stays intact\n   and\
    \ local in the WTP, along with PHY.\n"

- title: 4.2.  Security
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Security\n   Since both the 802.11 and CAPWAP functions are tightly integrated\n\
    \   into a single physical device, security issues with this architecture\n  \
    \ are confined to the WTP.  There are no extra implications from the\n   client\
    \ authentication and encryption/decryption perspective, as the\n   AAA interface\
    \ and the key generation mechanisms required for 802.11i\n   encryption/decryption\
    \ are integrated into the WTP.\n   One of the security needs in this architecture\
    \ is for mutual\n   authentication between the WTP and the Ethernet infrastructure.\
    \  This\n   can be ensured by existing mechanisms such as 802.1X between the WTP\n\
    \   and the Ethernet switch to which it connects.  Another critical\n   security\
    \ issue is the fact that the WTP is most likely not under lock\n   and key, but\
    \ contains secret information to communicate with back-end\n   systems, such as\
    \ AAA and SNMP.  Because IT personnel uses the common\n   management method of\
    \ pushing a \"template\" to all devices, theft of\n   such a device would potentially\
    \ compromise the wired network.\n"
- title: 5.  Centralized WLAN Architecture
  contents:
  - "5.  Centralized WLAN Architecture\n   Centralized WLAN Architecture is an emerging\
    \ architecture family in\n   the WLAN market.  Contrary to the Autonomous WLAN\
    \ Architecture, where\n   the 802.11 functions and network control functions are\
    \ all\n   implemented within each Wireless Termination Point (WTP), the\n   Centralized\
    \ WLAN Architecture employs one or more centralized\n   controllers, called Access\
    \ Controller(s), to enable network-wide\n   monitoring, improve management scalability,\
    \ and facilitate dynamic\n   configurability.\n   The following figure schematically\
    \ shows the Centralized WLAN\n   Architecture network diagram, where the Access\

  - "5.2.  Overview of Three Centralized WLAN Architecture Variants\n   Dynamic and\
    \ consistent network management is one of the primary\n   motivations for the\
    \ Centralized Architecture.  The survey data from\n   vendors also shows that\
    \ different varieties of this architecture\n   family have emerged to meet a complex\
    \ set of different requirements\n   for various possible deployment scenarios.\
    \  This is also a direct\n   result of the inherent flexibility in the 802.11\
    \ standard [1]\n   regarding the implementation of the logical functions that\
    \ are\n   broadly described under the term \"Access Point (AP)\".  Because there\n\
    \   is no standard mapping of these AP functions to physical network\n   entities,\
    \ several design choices have been made by vendors that offer\n   related products.\
    \  Moreover, the increased demand for monitoring and\n   consistent configuration\
    \ of large wireless networks has resulted in a\n   set of 'value-added' services\
    \ provided by the various vendors, most\n   of which share common design properties\
    \ and service goals.\n   In the following, we describe the three main variants\
    \ observed from\n   the survey data within the family of Centralized WLAN Architecture,\n\
    \   namely the Local MAC, Split MAC, and Remote MAC approaches.  For each\n  \
    \ approach, we provide the mapping characteristics of the various\n   functions\
    \ into the network entities from each vendor.  The naming of\n   Local MAC, Split\
    \ MAC, and Remote MAC reflects how the functions, and\n   especially the 802.11\
    \ MAC functions, are mapped onto the network\n   entities.  Local MAC indicates\
    \ that the MAC functions stay intact and\n   local to WTPs, while Remote MAC denotes\
    \ that the MAC has moved away\n   from the WTP to a remote AC in the network.\
    \  Split MAC shows the MAC\n   being split between the WTPs and ACs, largely along\
    \ the line of\n   realtime sensitivity.  Typically, Split MAC vendors choose to\
    \ put\n   realtime functions on the WTPs while leaving non-realtime functions\n\
    \   to the ACs.  802.11 does not clearly specify what constitutes\n   realtime\
    \ functions versus non-realtime functions, and so a clear and\n   definitive line\
    \ does not exist.  As shown in Section 5.4, each vendor\n   has its own interpretation\
    \ on this, and there are some discrepancies\n   about where to draw the line between\
    \ realtime and non-realtime\n   functions.  However, vendors agree on the characterization\
    \ of the\n   majority of MAC functions.  For example, every vendor classifies\
    \ the\n   DCF as a realtime function.\n   The differences among Local MAC, Split\
    \ MAC and Remote MAC\n   architectures are shown graphically in the following\

- title: 5.3.  Local MAC
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Local MAC\n   The main motivation of the Local MAC architecture model,\
    \ as shown in\n   Figure 6 (a), is to offload network access policies and management\n\
    \   functions (CAPWAP functions described in Section 1.2) to the AC\n   without\
    \ splitting the 802.11 MAC functionality between WTPs and AC.\n   The whole 802.11\
    \ MAC resides on the WTPs locally, including all the\n   802.11 management and\
    \ control frame processing for the STAs.  On the\n   other hand, information related\
    \ to management and configuration of\n   the WTP devices is communicated with\
    \ a centralized AC to facilitate\n   management of the network and maintain a\
    \ consistent network-wide\n   configuration for the WTP devices.\n   Figure 7\
    \ shows a tabular representation of the design choices made by\n   the six vendors\
    \ in the survey that follow the Local MAC approach,\n   with respect to the above\
    \ mentioned architecture considerations.\n   \"WTP-AC connectivity\" shows the\
    \ type connectivity between the WTPs\n   and AC that every vendor's architecture\
    \ can support.  Clearly, all\n   the vendors can support L3 routed network connectivity\
    \ between WTPs\n   and the AC, which implies that direct connections and L2 switched\n\
    \   networks are also supported by all vendors.  By '802.11 mgmt\n   termination',\
    \ and '802.11 control termination', we denote the\n   physical network device\
    \ on which processing of the 802.11 management\n   and control frames is done\
    \ respectively.  All the vendors here choose\n   to terminate 802.11 management\
    \ and control frames at the WTPs.  The\n   last row of the table, '802.11 data\
    \ aggregation', refers to the\n   device on which aggregation and delivery of\
    \ 802.11 data frames from\n   one STA to another (possibly through a DS) is performed.\
    \  As shown by\n   the table, vendors make different choices as to whether all\
    \ the\n   802.11 data traffic is aggregated and routed through the AC.  The\n\
    \   survey data shows that some vendors choose to tunnel or encapsulate\n   all\
    \ the station traffic to or from the ACs, implying that the AC also\n   acts as\
    \ the access router for this WLAN access network.  Other\n   vendors choose to\
    \ separate the control and data plane by letting the\n   station traffic be bridged\
    \ or routed locally, while keeping the\n   centralized control at the AC.\n  \

- title: 5.4.  Split MAC
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Split MAC\n   As depicted in Figure 6 (b), the main idea behind the Split\
    \ MAC\n   architecture is to implement part of the 802.11 MAC functionality on\n\
    \   a centralized AC instead of the WTPs, in addition to providing the\n   required\
    \ services for managing and monitoring the WTP devices.\n   Usually, the decision\
    \ of which functions of the 802.11 MAC need to be\n   provided by the AC is based\
    \ on the time-criticality of the services\n   considered.\n   In the Split MAC\
    \ architecture, the WTP terminates the infrastructure\n   side of the wireless\
    \ physical link, provides radio-related\n   management, and also implements time-critical\
    \ functionality of the\n   802.11 MAC.  In addition, the non-realtime management\
    \ functions are\n   handled by a centralized AC, along with higher level services,\
    \ such\n   as configuration, QoS, policies for load balancing, and access\n  \
    \ control lists.  The key distinction between Local MAC and Split MAC\n   relates\
    \ to non-realtime functions: in Split MAC architecture, the AC\n   terminates\
    \ 802.11 non realtime functions, whereas in Local MAC\n   architecture, the WTP\
    \ terminates the 802.11 non-realtime functions\n   and consequently sends appropriate\
    \ messages to the AC.\n   There are several motivations for taking the Split MAC\
    \ approach.  The\n   first is to offload functionality that is specific and relevant\
    \ only\n   to the locality of each BSS to the WTP, in order to allow the AC to\n\
    \   scale to a large number of 'light weight' WTP devices.  Moreover,\n   realtime\
    \ functionality is subject to latency constraints and cannot\n   tolerate delays\
    \ due to transmission of 802.11 control frames (or\n   other realtime information)\
    \ over multiple-hops.  The latter would\n   limit the available choices for connectivity\
    \ between the AC and the\n   WTP.  Therefore, the realtime criterion is usually\
    \ employed to\n   separate MAC services between the devices.  Another consideration\
    \ is\n   cost reduction of the WTP to make it as cheap and simple as possible.\n\
    \   Finally, moving functions like encryption and decryption to the AC\n   reduces\
    \ vulnerabilities from a compromised WTP, since user encryption\n   keys no longer\
    \ reside on the WTP.  As a result, any advancements in\n   security protocol and\
    \ algorithm designs do not necessarily obsolete\n   the WTPs; the ACs implement\
    \ the new security schemes instead, which\n   simplifies the management and update\
    \ task.  Additionally, the network\n   is protected against LAN-side eavesdropping.\n\
    \   Since there is no clear definition in the 802.11 specification as to\n   which\
    \ 802.11 MAC functions are considered \"realtime\", each vendor\n   interprets\
    \ this in their own way.  Most vendors agree that the\n   following services of\
    \ 802.11 MAC are examples of realtime services,\n   and are chosen to be implemented\
    \ on the WTPs.\n   o  Beacon Generation\n   o  Probe Response/Transmission\n \
    \  o  Processing of Control Frames: RTS/CTS/ACK/PS-Poll/CF-End/CF-ACK\n   o  Synchronization\n\
    \   o  Retransmissions\n   o  Transmission Rate Adaptation\n   The following list\
    \ includes examples of non-realtime MAC functions as\n   interpreted by most vendors:\n\
    \   o  Authentication/De-authentication\n   o  Association/Disassociation/Reassociation/Distribution\n\
    \   o  Integration Services: Bridging between 802.11 and 802.3\n   o  Privacy:\
    \ 802.11 Encryption/Decryption\n   o  Fragmentation/Defragmentation\n   However,\
    \ some vendors may choose to classify some of the above \"non-\n   realtime\"\
    \ functions as realtime functions in order to support\n   specific applications\
    \ with strict QoS requirements.  For example,\n   Reassociation is sometimes implemented\
    \ as a \"realtime\" function to\n   support VoIP applications.\n   The non-realtime\
    \ aspects of the 802.11 MAC are handled by the AC\n   through the processing of\
    \ raw 802.11 management frames (Split MAC).\n   The following matrix in Figure\
    \ 10 offers a tabular representation of\n   the design choices made by the six\
    \ vendors that follow the Split MAC\n   design regarding the architecture considerations.\
    \  While most vendors\n   support L3 connectivity between WTPs and ACs, some can\
    \ only support\n   L2 switched connections due to the tighter delay constraint\
    \ resulting\n   from splitting MAC between two physical entities across a network.\n\
    \   In Figure 7, it is clear that the WTP processes the 802.11 control\n   frames\
    \ in both the Split MAC and Local MAC.  The difference between\n   the two lies\
    \ in the termination point for 802.11 management frames.\n   Local MAC terminates\
    \ 802.11 management frames at WTP, while at least\n   some of the 802.11 management\
    \ frames are terminated at the AC for the\n   Split MAC Architecture.  Since in\
    \ most cases WTP devices are IP-\n   addressable, any of the direct connection,\
    \ L2-switched, or L3-routed\n   connections of Section 1.2 can be used.  If only\
    \ Ethernet-\n   encapsulation is performed (e.g., as in Architecture 4), then\
    \ only\n   direct connection and L2-switched connections are supported.\n    \

  - "5.5.  Remote MAC\n   One of the main motivations for the Remote MAC Architecture\
    \ is to\n   keep the WTPs as light weight as possible, by having only the radio\n\
    \   interfaces on the WTPs and offloading the entire set of 802.11 MAC\n   functions\
    \ (including delay-sensitive ones) to the Access Controller.\n   This leaves all\
    \ the complexities of the MAC and other CAPWAP control\n   functions to the centralized\
    \ controller.\n   The WTP acts only as a pass-through between the Wireless LAN\
    \ clients\n   (STA) and the AC, though they may have an additional feature to\n\
    \   convert the frames from one format (802.11) to the other (i.e.,\n   Ethernet,\
    \ TR, Fiber).  The centralized controller provides network\n   monitoring, management\
    \ and control, an entire set of 802.11 AP\n   services, security features, resource\
    \ management, channel selection\n   features, and guarantees Quality of Service\
    \ to the users.  Because\n   the MAC is separated from the PHY, we call this the\
    \ \"Remote MAC\n   Architecture\".  Typically, such architecture is deployed with\
    \ special\n   attention to the connectivity between the WTPs and AC so that the\n\
    \   delay is minimized.  The Radio over Fiber (RoF) from Architecture 5\n   is\
    \ an example of Remote MAC Architecture.\n"
- title: 5.6.  Comparisons of Local MAC, Split MAC, and Remote MAC
  contents:
  - "5.6.  Comparisons of Local MAC, Split MAC, and Remote MAC\n   Two commonalities\
    \ across all three Centralized Architectures (Local\n   MAC, Split MAC, and Remote\
    \ MAC) are:\n   o  Most of the CAPWAP functions related to network control and\n\
    \      configuration reside on the AC.\n   o  IEEE 802.11 PHY resides on the WTP.\n\
    \   There is a clear difference between Remote MAC and the other two\n   Centralized\
    \ Architectures (namely, Local MAC and Split MAC), as the\n   802.11 MAC is completely\
    \ separated from the PHY in the former, while\n   the other two keep some portion\
    \ of the MAC functions together with\n   PHY at the WTPs.  The implication of\
    \ PHY and MAC separation is that\n   it severely limits the kind of interconnection\
    \ between WTPs and ACs,\n   so that the 802.11 timing constraints are satisfied.\
    \  As pointed out\n   earlier, this usually results in tighter constraint over\
    \ the\n   interconnection between WTP and AC for the Remote MAC Architecture.\n\
    \   The advantage of Remote MAC Architecture is that it offers the\n   lightest\
    \ possible WTPs for certain deployment scenarios.\n   The commonalities and differences\
    \ between Local MAC and Split MAC are\n   most clearly seen by comparing Figure\
    \ 7 to Figure 10.  The\n   commonality is that 802.11 control frames are terminated\
    \ at WTPs in\n   both cases.  The main difference between Local MAC and Split\
    \ MAC is\n   that the WTP terminates only the 802.11 control frames in the Split\n\
    \   MAC, while the WTP may terminate all 802.11 frames in the Local MAC.\n   An\
    \ interesting consequence of this difference is that the Integration\n   Service,\
    \ which essentially refers to bridging between 802.11 and\n   802.3 frames, is\
    \ implemented by the AC in the Split MAC and by the\n   WTP in the Local MAC,\
    \ as shown in Figures 9 and 12, respectively.\n   As a second note, the Distribution\
    \ Service, although usually provided\n   by the AC, can also be implemented at\
    \ the WTP in some Local MAC\n   architectures.  This approach is meant to increase\
    \ performance in\n   delivering STAs data traffic by avoiding tunneling it to\
    \ the AC, and\n   relaxing the dependency of the WTP from the AC.  Therefore,\
    \ it is\n   possible for the data and control planes to be separated in the Local\n\
    \   MAC Architecture.\n   Even though all the 802.11 traffic is aggregated at\
    \ ACs in the case\n   of Split MAC Architecture, the data and control planes can\
    \ still be\n   separated by employing multiple ACs.  For example, one AC can\n\
    \   implement most of the CAPWAP functions (control plane), while other\n   ACs\
    \ can be used for 802.11 frames bridging (data plane).\n   Each of the three architectural\
    \ variants may be advantageous for\n   certain deployment scenarios.  While the\
    \ Local MAC retains most of\n   the STA's state information at the local WTPs,\
    \ Remote MAC centralizes\n   most of the state into the back-end AC.  Split MAC\
    \ sits somewhat in\n   the middle of this spectrum, keeping some state information\
    \ locally\n   at the WTPs, and the rest centrally at the AC.  Many factors should\n\
    \   be taken into account to determine the exact balance desired between\n   the\
    \ centralized and decentralized state.  The impact of such balance\n   on network\
    \ manageability is currently a matter of dispute within the\n   technical community.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.7.  Communication Interface between WTPs and ACs\n   Before any messages can\
    \ be exchanged between an AC and WTP, the WTP\n   needs to discover, authenticate,\
    \ and register with the AC first, then\n   download the firmware and establish\
    \ a control channel with the AC.\n   Message exchanges between the WTP and AC\
    \ for control and\n   configuration can happen after that.  The following list\
    \ outlines the\n   basic operations that are typically performed between the WTP\
    \ and the\n   AC in their typical order:\n   1.  Discovery: The WTPs discover\
    \ the AC with which they will be bound\n       to and controlled by.  The discovery\
    \ procedure can employ either\n       static or dynamic configuration.  In the\
    \ latter case, a protocol\n       is used in order for the WTP to discover candidate\
    \ AC(s).\n   2.  Authentication: After discovery, the WTP device authenticates\n\
    \       itself with the AC.  However, mutual authentication, in which the\n  \
    \     WTP also authenticates the AC, is not always supported since some\n    \
    \   vendors strive for zero-configuration on the WTP side.  This is\n       not\
    \ necessarily secure as it leaves the possible vulnerability of\n       the WTP\
    \ being attached to a rogue AC.\n   3.  WTP Association: After successful authentication,\
    \ a WTP registers\n       with the AC in order to start receiving management and\n\
    \       configuration messages.\n   4.  Firmware Download: After successful association,\
    \ the WTP may\n       pull, or the AC may push, the WTPs firmware, which may be\n\
    \       protected in some manner, such as digital signatures.\n   5.  Control\
    \ Channel Establishment: The WTP establishes either an IP-\n       tunnel or performs\
    \ Ethernet encapsulation with the AC in order to\n       transfer data traffic\
    \ and management frames.\n   6.  Configuration Download: Following the control\

    \ and unique security issues and subsequent requirements.\n"
- title: 5.8.1.  Client Data Security
  contents:
  - "5.8.1.  Client Data Security\n   The survey shows clearly that the termination\
    \ point for \"over the\n   air\" 802.11 encryption [4] can be implemented either\
    \ in the WTP or in\n   the AC.  Furthermore, the 802.1X/EAP [6] functionality\
    \ is distributed\n   between the WTP and the AC where, in most cases, the AC performs\
    \ the\n   necessary functions as the authenticator in the 802.1X exchange.\n \
    \  If the STA and AC are the parties in the 4-way handshake (defined in\n   [4]),\
    \ and 802.11i traffic encryption terminates at the WTP, then the\n   Pairwise\
    \ Transient Key (PTK) has to be transferred from the AC to the\n   WTP.  Since\
    \ the keying material is part of the control and\n   provisioning of the WTPs,\
    \ a secure encrypted tunnel for control\n   frames is employed to transport the\
    \ keying material.\n   The centralized model encourages AC implementations to\
    \ use one PMK\n   for many different WTPs.  This practice facilitates speedy transition\n\
    \   by an STA from one WTP to another that is connected to the same AC\n   without\
    \ establishing a separate PMK.  However, this leaves the STA in\n   a difficult\
    \ position, as the STA cannot distinguish between a\n   compromised PMK and one\
    \ that is intentionally being shared.  This\n   issue must be resolved, but the\
    \ resolution is beyond the scope of the\n   CAPWAP working group.  The venue for\
    \ this resolution is to be\n   determined by the IEEE 802 and IETF liaisons.\n\
    \   When the 802.11i encryption/decryption is performed in the AC, the\n   key\
    \ exchange and state transitions occur between the AC and the STA.\n   Therefore,\
    \ there is no need to transfer any crypto material between\n   the AC and the\
    \ WTP.\n   Regardless of where the 802.11i termination point occurs, the\n   Centralized\
    \ WLAN Architecture records two practices for \"over the\n   wire\" client data\
    \ security.  In some cases there is an encrypted\n   tunnel (IPsec or SSL) between\
    \ the WTP and AC, which assumes that the\n   security boundary is in the AC. \
    \ In other cases, an end-to-end\n   mutually authenticated secure VPN tunnel is\
    \ assumed between the\n   client and AC, other security gateway, or end host entity.\n"

- title: 6.1.  Common Characteristics
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Common Characteristics\n   To provide wider wireless coverage, mesh nodes\
    \ in the network may act\n   as APs to client stations in their respective BSS,\
    \ as well as traffic\n   relays to neighboring mesh nodes via 802.11 wireless\
    \ links.  It is\n   also possible that some mesh nodes in the network may serve\
    \ only as\n   wireless traffic relays for other mesh nodes, but not as APs for\
    \ any\n   client stations.  Instead of pulling Ethernet cable connections to\n\
    \   every AP, wireless mesh networks provide an attractive alternative to\n  \
    \ relaying backhaul traffic.\n   Mesh nodes can also keep track of the state of\
    \ their neighboring\n   nodes, or even nodes beyond their immediate neighborhood\
    \ by\n   exchanging information periodically amongst them; this way, mesh\n  \
    \ nodes can be fully aware of the dynamic network topology and RF\n   conditions\
    \ around them.  Such peer-to-peer communication model allows\n   mesh nodes to\
    \ actively coordinate among themselves to achieve self-\n   configuration and\
    \ self-healing.  This is the major distinction\n   between this Distributed Architecture\
    \ family and the Centralized\n   Architecture -- much of the CAPWAP functions\
    \ can be implemented\n   across the mesh nodes in a distributed fashion, without\
    \ a centralized\n   entity making all the control decisions.\n   It is worthwhile\
    \ to point out that mesh networks do not necessarily\n   preclude the use of centralized\
    \ control.  It is possible that a\n   combination of centralized and distributed\
    \ control co-exists in mesh\n   networks.  Some global configuration or policy\
    \ change may be better\n   served in a coordinated fashion if some form of Access\
    \ Controller\n   (AC) exists in the mesh network (even if not the full blown version\n\
    \   of the AC, as defined in the Centralized WLAN Architecture).  For\n   example,\
    \ a centralized management entity can be used to update every\n   mesh node's\
    \ default configuration.  It may also be more desirable to\n   leave certain functions,\
    \ such as user authentication to a single\n   centralized end point (such as a\
    \ RADIUS server), but mesh networks\n   allow each mesh AP to directly talk to\
    \ the RADIUS server.  This\n   eliminates the single point of failure and takes\
    \ advantage of the\n   client distribution in the network.\n   The backhaul transport\
    \ network of the mesh network can be either an\n   L2 or L3 networking technology.\
    \  Currently, vendors are using\n   proprietary mesh technologies on top of standard\
    \ 802.11 wireless\n   links to enable peer-to-peer communication between the mesh\
    \ nodes.\n   Hence, there is no interoperability among mesh nodes from different\n\
    \   vendors.  The IEEE 802.11 WG has recently started a new Task Group\n   (TGs)\
    \ to define the mesh standard for 802.11.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.2.  Security\n   Similar security concerns for client data security, as described\
    \ in\n   Section 5.8.1, also apply to the Distributed Mesh Architecture.\n   Additionally,\
    \ one important security consideration for the mesh\n   networks is that the mesh\
    \ nodes must authenticate each other within\n   the same administrative domain.\
    \  To protect user and management data\n   that may not be secured at layer 3,\
    \ data transmission among\n   neighboring nodes should be secured by a layer 2\
    \ mechanism of\n   confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Summary and Conclusions\n   We requested existing WLAN vendors and other\
    \ interested parties to\n   submit a short description of existing or desired\
    \ WLAN access network\n   architectures to define a taxonomy of possible WLAN\
    \ access network\n   architectures.  The information from the 16 submissions was\
    \ condensed\n   and summarized in this document.\n   New terminology has been\
    \ defined wherever existing terminology was\n   found to be either insufficient\
    \ or ambiguous in describing the WLAN\n   architectures and supporting functions\
    \ listed in the document.  For\n   example, the broad set of Access Point functions\
    \ has been divided\n   into two categories: 802.11 functions, which include those\
    \ that are\n   required by the IEEE 802.11 standards, and CAPWAP functions, which\n\
    \   include those that are not required by the IEEE 802.11, but are\n   deemed\
    \ essential for control, configuration, and management of 802.11\n   WLAN access\
    \ networks.  Another term that has caused considerable\n   ambiguity is \"Access\
    \ Point\", which usually reflected a physical box\n   that has the antennas, but\
    \ did not have a uniform set of externally\n   consistent behavior across submissions.\
    \  To remove this ambiguity, we\n   have redefined the AP as the set of 802.11\
    \ and CAPWAP functions,\n   while the physical box that terminates the 802.11\
    \ PHY is called the\n   Wireless Termination Point.\n   Based on the submissions\
    \ during the architecture survey phase, we\n   have classified the existing WLAN\
    \ architectures into three broad\n   classes:\n   1. Autonomous WLAN Architecture:\
    \ Indicates a family of architectures\n      in which all the 802.11 functions\
    \ and, where applicable, CAPWAP\n      functions are implemented in the WTPs.\n\
    \   2. Centralized WLAN Architecture: Indicates a family of architectures\n  \
    \    in which the AP functions are split between the WTPs and the AC,\n      with\
    \ the AC acting as a centralized control point for multiple\n      WTPs.\n   3.\
    \ Distributed WLAN Architecture: Indicates a family of architectures\n      in\
    \ which part of the control functions is implemented across a\n      distributed\
    \ network of peer entities.\n   Within the Centralized WLAN Architecture, there\
    \ are a few visible\n   sub-categories that depend on how one maps the MAC functions\
    \ (at a\n   high-level), between the WTP and the AC.  Three prominent sub-\n \
    \  categories emerged from the information in the submissions:\n   1. Split MAC\
    \ Architecture: The 802.11 MAC functions are split between\n      the WTP and\
    \ the AC.  This subgroup includes all architectures that\n      split the 802.11\
    \ MAC functions even though individual submissions\n      differed on the specifics\
    \ of the split.\n   2. Local MAC Architecture: The entire set of 802.11 MAC functions\
    \ is\n      implemented on the WTP.\n   3. Remote MAC Architecture: The entire\
    \ set of 802.11 MAC functions is\n      implemented on the AC.\n   The following\

    \  A majority of the submitted WLAN access network architectures (twelve\n   out\
    \ of sixteen) followed the Centralized WLAN Architecture.  All but\n   one of\
    \ the Centralized WLAN Architecture submissions were grouped\n   into either a\
    \ Split MAC Architecture or a Local MAC Architecture.\n   One submission followed\
    \ the Autonomous WLAN Architecture, and three\n   followed the Distributed WLAN\
    \ Architecture.\n   The WLAN access network architectures in the submissions indicated\n\
    \   that the connectivity assumptions were:\n   o  Direct connection between the\
    \ WTP and the AC.\n   o  L2 switched connection between the WTP and the AC.\n\
    \   o  L3 routed connection between the WTP and the AC.\n   o  Wireless connection\
    \ between the mesh nodes in the distributed mesh\n      architecture.\n   Interoperability\
    \ between equipment from different vendors is one of\n   the fundamental problems\
    \ in the WLAN market today.  To achieve\n   interoperability via open standard\
    \ development, the following steps\n   are suggested for IETF and IEEE 802.11.\n\
    \   Using this taxonomy, a functional model of an Access Point should be\n   defined\
    \ by the new study group recently formed within the IEEE\n   802.11.  The functional\
    \ model will consist of defining functional\n   elements of an 802.11 Access Point\
    \ that are considered atomic, i.e.,\n   not subject to further splitting across\
    \ multiple network elements.\n   Such a functional model should serve as a common\
    \ foundation to\n   support the existing WLAN architectures as outlined in this\
    \ taxonomy,\n   and any further architecture development within or outside the\
    \ IEEE\n   802.11 group.  It is possible, and even recommended, that work on the\n\
    \   functional model definition may also include impact analysis of\n   implementing\
    \ each functional element on either the WTP or the AC.\n   As part of the functional\
    \ model definition, interfaces must be\n   defined as primitives between these\
    \ functional elements.  If a pair\n   of functional elements that have an interface\
    \ defined between them is\n   being implemented on two different network entities,\
    \ then a protocol\n   specification definition between such a pair of network\
    \ elements is\n   required, and should be developed by the IETF.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not intend to provide a comprehensive\
    \ threat\n   analysis of all of the security issues with the different WLAN\n\
    \   architectures.  Nevertheless, in addition to documenting the\n   architectures\
    \ employed in the existing IEEE 802.11 products in the\n   market, this taxonomy\
    \ document also catalogues the security issues\n   that arise and the manner in\
    \ which vendors address these security\n   threats.  The WLAN architectures are\
    \ broadly categorized into three\n   families: Autonomous Architecture, Centralized\
    \ Architecture, and\n   Distributed Architecture.  While Sections 4, 5, and 6\
    \ are devoted to\n   each of these three architecture families, respectively,\
    \ each section\n   also contains a subsection to address the security issues within\
    \ each\n   architecture family.\n   In summary, the main security concern in the\
    \ Autonomous Architecture\n   is the mutual authentication between the WTP and\
    \ the wired (Ethernet)\n   infrastructure equipment.  Physical security of the\
    \ WTPs is also a\n   network security concern because the WTPs contain secret\
    \ information\n   and theft of these devices could potentially compromise even\
    \ the\n   wired network.\n   In the Centralized Architecture there are a few new\
    \ security concerns\n   due to the new network binding between the WTP and AC.\
    \  The following\n   security concerns are raised for this architecture family:\
    \ keying\n   material for mobile client traffic may need to be securely\n   transported\
    \ from the AC to WTP; secure discovery of the WTP and AC is\n   required, as well\
    \ as mutual authentication between the WTPs and AC;\n   man-in-the-middle attacks\
    \ to the control channel between WTP and AC,\n   confidentiality, integrity and\
    \ replay protection of control channel\n   frames, and theft of WTPs for extraction\
    \ of embedded secrets within.\n   Each of the survey results for this broad architecture\
    \ category has\n   presented mechanisms to address these security issues.\n  \
    \ The new security issue in the Distributed Mesh Architecture is the\n   need\
    \ for mesh nodes to authenticate each other before forming a\n   secure mesh network.\
    \  Encrypted communication between mesh nodes is\n   recommended to protect both\
    \ control and user data.\n"
