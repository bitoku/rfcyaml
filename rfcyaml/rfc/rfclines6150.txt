Abstract This document retires RFC 1320, which documents the MD4 algorithm, and discusses the reasons for doing so.
This document moves RFC 1320 to Historic status.
Introduction MD4 [MD4] is a message digest algorithm that takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128 bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.
Specifically, this document moves RFC 1320 [MD4] to Historic status.
The reasons for taking this action are discussed.
[HASH Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in many protocols and discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's one way and collision free properties affect and do not affect Internet protocols.
Familiarity with [HASH Attack] is assumed.
Rationale MD4 was published in 1992 as an Informational RFC.
Since its publication, MD4 has been under attack [denBORBOS1992]
In fact, RSA, in 1996, suggested that MD4 should not be used [RSA AdviceOnMD4].
Microsoft also made similar statements [MS AdviceOnMD4].
In Section 6, this document discusses attacks against MD4 that indicate use of MD4 is no longer appropriate when collision resistance is required.
Section 6 also discusses attacks against MD4's pre image and second pre image resistance.
Additionally, attacks against MD4 used in message authentication with a shared secret (i.e., HMAC MD4) are discussed.
Documents that Reference RFC 1320 Use of MD4 has been specified in the following RFCs: Internet Standard (IS):
A One Time Password System.
: [RFC1629] Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet.
[RFC3961] Encryption and Checksum Specifications for Kerberos 5.
Best Current Practice (BCP): [RFC4086] Randomness Requirements for Security.
The S/KEY One Time Password System.
[RFC2433] Microsoft PPP CHAP Extensions.
[RFC2759] Microsoft PPP CHAP Extensions, Version 2.
US Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1).
The RC4 HMAC Kerberos Encryption Types Used by Microsoft Windows.
CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES).
There are other RFCs that refer to MD2, but they have been either moved to Historic status or obsoleted by a later RFC.
References and discussions about these RFCs are omitted.
The notable exceptions are: [RFC2313]
PKCS #1: RSA Encryption Version 1.5.
PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.0.
Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)
#1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.1.
Impact of Moving MD4 to Historic
The impact of moving MD4 to Historic is minimal with the one exception of Microsoft's use of MD4 as part of RC4 HMAC in Windows, as described below.
Regarding DS, PS, and BCP RFCs:
The initial One Time Password systems, based on [RFC2289], have ostensibly been replaced by HMAC based mechanism, as specified in "HOTP: An HMAC Based One Time Password Algorithm" [RFC4226].
[RFC4226] suggests following recommendations in [RFC4086] for random input, and in [RFC4086] weaknesses of MD4 are discussed.
MD4 was used in the Inter Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP); each IDRP message carries a 16 octet hash that is computed by applying the MD 4 algorithm (RFC 1320) to the context of the message itself.
Over time, IDRP was replaced by BGP 4 [RFC4271], which required at least [MD5].
[RFC3961] specifies the use of MD4 for DES encryption types and checksum types.
They were specified, never really used, and are in the process of being deprecated by [DES DIE].
Further, the mandatory to implement encrypted types and checksum types specified by Kerberos are based on AES 256 and HMAC  SHA1 [RFC3962].
Regarding Informational RFCs: PKCS#1 v1.5
[RFC2313] indicated that there was no reason to not use MD4.
[RFC3447] recommend against MD4 due to cryptoanalytic progress having uncovered weaknesses in the collision resistance of MD4.
Randomness Requirements [RFC4086] does mention MD4, but not in a good way; it explains how the algorithm works and that there have been a number of attacks found against it.
The "Internet Users' Glossary" [RFC1983] provided a definition for Message Digest and listed MD4 as one example.
The IETF OTP specification [RFC2289] was based on S/KEY technology.
So S/KEY was replaced by OTP, at least in theory.
Additionally, the S/KEY implementations in the wild have started to use MD5 in lieu of MD4.
The CAdES document [RFC5126] lists MD4 as a hash algorithm, disparages it, and then does not mention it again.
The SHA 1 document [RFC3174] mentions MD4 in the acknowledgements section.
The three RFCs describing Microsoft protocols, [RFC2433], [RFC2759], and [RFC4757], are very widely deployed as MS CHAP v1, MS CHAP v2, and RC4 HMAC, respectively.
MS CHAP Version 1 is supported in Microsoft's Windows XP, 2000, 98, 95, NT 4.0, NT 3.51, and NT 3.5, but support has been dropped in Vista.
MS CHAP Version 2 is supported in Microsoft's Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2000, 98, 95, and NT 4.0.
Both versions of MS CHAP are also supported by RADIUS [RFC2548] and the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
In 2007, [RFC4962] listed MS CHAP v1 and v2 as flawed and recommended against their use; these incidents were presented as a strong indication for the necessity of built in crypto algorithm agility in Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols.
The RC4 HMAC is supported in Microsoft's Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows for backwards compatibility with Windows 2000.
As [RFC4757] stated, RC4 HMAC doesn't rely on the collision resistance property of MD4, but uses it to generate a key from a password, which is then used as input to HMAC MD5.
For an attacker to recover the password from RC4 HMAC, the attacker first needs to recover the key that is used with HMAC  MD5.
As noted in [RFC6151], key recovery attacks on HMAC MD5 are not yet practical.
Other Considerations rsync [RSYNC], a non IETF protocol, once specified the use of MD4, but as of version 3.0.0 published in 2008, it has adopted MD5 [MD5].
This section addresses attacks against MD4's collisions, pre image, and second pre image resistance.
Additionally, attacks against HMAC  MD4 are discussed.
Some may find the guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in [SP800 57] and [SP800 131] useful.
A practical attack on MD4 was shown by Dobbertin in 1996 with complexity 2^20 of MD4 hash computations [DOBB1996].
In 2004, a more devastating result presented by Xiaoyun Wang showed that the complexity can be reduced to 2^8 of MD4 hash operations.
At the Rump Session of Crypto 2004, Wang said that as a matter of fact, finding a collision of MD4 can be accomplished with a pen on a piece of paper.
The formal result was presented at EUROCRYPT 2005 in [WLDCY2005].
Pre Image and Second Pre Image Resistance
The first pre image attack on full MD4 was accomplished in [LUER2008] with complexity 2^100.
Some improvements are shown on pre image attacks and second pre image attacks of MD4 with certain pre  computations [GLRW2010], where complexity is reduced to 2^78.4 and 2^69.4 for pre image and second pre image, respectively.
The pre  image attacks on MD4 are practical.
It cannot be used as a one way function.
For example, it must not be used to hash a cryptographic key of 80 bits or longer.
The attacks on Hash based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
algorithms [RFC2104] presented so far can be classified in three types: distinguishing attacks, existential forgery attacks, and key recovery attacks.
Of course, among all these attacks, key recovery attacks are the most severe attacks.
The best results on key recovery attacks on HMAC MD4 were published at EUROCRYPT 2008 with 2^72 queries and 2^
Despite MD4 seeing some deployment on the Internet, this specification obsoletes [MD4] because MD4 is not a reasonable candidate for further standardization and should be deprecated in favor of one or more existing hash algorithms (e.g., SHA 256 [SHS]).
RSA Security considers it appropriate to move the MD4 algorithm to Historic status.
It takes a number of years to deploy crypto and it also takes a number of years to withdraw it.
Algorithms need to be withdrawn before a catastrophic break is discovered.
MD4 is clearly showing signs of weakness, and implementations should strongly consider removing support and migrating to another hash algorithm.
