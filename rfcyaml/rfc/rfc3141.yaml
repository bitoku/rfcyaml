- title: 1.1.  Requirements language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements language\n   In this document, the key words \"MAY\", \"MUST,\
    \ \"MUST NOT\", \"optional\",\n   \"recommended\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , are to be interpreted as\n   described in [RFC2119].\n   Please note that the\
    \ requirements specified in this document are to\n   be used in evaluating AAA\
    \ protocol submissions.  As such, the\n   requirements language refers to capabilities\
    \ of these protocols; the\n   protocol documents will specify whether these features\
    \ are required,\n   recommended, or optional.  For example, requiring that a protocol\n\
    \   support confidentiality is NOT the same thing as requiring that all\n   protocol\
    \ traffic be encrypted.\n   A protocol submission is not compliant if it fails\
    \ to satisfy one or\n   more of the MUST or MUST NOT requirements for the capabilities\
    \ that\n   it implements.  A protocol submission that satisfies all the MUST,\n\
    \   MUST NOT, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT requirements for its capabilities is\n   said\
    \ to be \"unconditionally compliant\"; one that satisfies all the\n   MUST and\
    \ MUST NOT requirements but not all the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT\n   requirements\
    \ for its protocols is said to be \"conditionally\n   compliant.\"\n"

    \ requirements.  In\n   these requirements, the serving network and home network\
    \ may or may\n   not have a direct business relationship.  In such cases in which\n\
    \   there is not a direct business relationship, service may be supported\n  \
    \ indirectly via broker.\n      o  Authenticate and authorize a user NAI in a\
    \ roaming environment.\n         The NAI is obtained via CHAP (for traditional\
    \ PPP service) or a\n         Foreign Agent Challenge (for Mobile IP service).\
    \  A shared\n         secret exists between the mobile and its HAAA.  The FAC\
    \ will\n         typically be computed in a manner  consistent with CHAP.\n  \
    \    o  Transport wireless data attributes from the home network to the\n    \
    \     Serving network.  This may often take the form of a user\n         profile.\n\
    \      o  Encrypt or sign one or more AVPs in an AAA message between\n       \
    \  home, serving network, or some broker across multiple AAA\n         server\
    \ hops.\n      o  Support a reliable AAA transport mechanism.\n         o  This\
    \ transport mechanism will be able indicate to an AAA\n            application\
    \ that a message was delivered to the next peer\n            AAA application or\
    \ that a time out occurred.\n         o  Retransmission is controlled by the reliable\
    \ AAA transport\n            mechanism, and not by lower layer protocols such\
    \ as TCP.\n         o  Even if the AAA message is to be forwarded, or the message's\n\
    \            options or semantics do not conform with the AAA protocol,\n    \
    \        the transport mechanism will acknowledge that the peer\n            received\
    \ the AAA message.  However, if the message fails to\n            pass authentication,\

    \ of the AAA peer or path\n            to the AAA peer, to manage failure on a\
    \ proactive basis.\n         o  Transport a digital certificate in an AAA message,\
    \ in order\n            to minimize the number of round trips associated with\

    \        applications and not mobile stations.\n         o  Support both proxy\

    \ terminates an entire request and\n            initiates a new request.  AAA\

    \ messages whereby\n            to operate to in non-proxy or proxy environments.\n\
    \         o  Provide message integrity and identity authentication on a\n    \
    \        per hop (AAA node) basis.\n         o  Support replay protection and\
    \ optional non-repudiation\n            capabilities for all authorization and\
    \ accounting messages.\n            The AAA protocol must provide the capability\
    \ for accounting\n            messages to be matched with prior authorization\
    \ messages.\n         o  Support accounting via both bilateral arrangements and\
    \ via\n            broker AAA servers providing accounting clearinghouse and\n\
    \            reconciliation between serving and home networks.  There is\n   \
    \         an explicit agreement that if the private network or home\n        \
    \    ISP authenticates the mobile station requesting service,\n            then\

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Mobile IP Security Discussion\n   Three Mobile IP security extensions\
    \ are defined in RFC 2002:\n        . HA - FA\n        . MN - FA\n        . HA\
    \ - MN\n   Therefore, Mobile IP and IPsec security models differ in that Mobile\n\
    \   IP provides its own authentication mechanisms calculated within the\n   Mobile\
    \ IP registration procedures whereas IPsec uses IPsec AH.\n   The keys and SPIs\
    \ associated with the MN-FA and HA-FA extensions need\n   to be dynamically established\
    \ in a roaming wireless carrier\n   environment.  The MN-FA extension is useful\
    \ for allowing a new FA\n   (PDSN) to quickly authenticate a mobile using the\
    \ previous foreign\n   agent extension.  The HA-FA extension is useful for the\
    \ HA to ensure\n   that only FAs from carrier's with roaming agreements access\
    \ the HA.\n   The MN-HA is usually provisioned, but for dynamic Home Agent\n \
    \  assignment, this security association must be dynamically created.\n   It is\
    \ possible to use IPsec AH between MN and FA, FA and HA, and MN\n   and HA.  IKE\
    \ may be used to establish security associations between\n   these entities. \
    \ However, use of IKE may pose a problem for smaller\n   mobiles and may introduce\
    \ unacceptable delays for certain\n   applications (e.g., Voice Over IP).  The\
    \ following three sections\n   outline Mobile IP specific functions that benefit\
    \ from AAA based key\n   distribution.\n"

    \ dynamic HA\n   assignment in those cases in which the mobile node requests dynamic\n\
    \   assignment.  If so indicated, the home AAA server may choose to allow\n  \
    \ the visited AAA server to perform the HA assignment.  Otherwise, the\n   home\

  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Fast Handoff\n   To achieve a faster handoff, the mobile may attempt\
    \ to avoid an AAA\n   transaction with the home AAA server.  To accomplish this,\
    \ the mobile\n   may send the PDSN the Previous FA address in the RRQ message\
    \ from the\n   mobile, along with the MN-FA authentication extension.  The new\
    \ PDSN\n   passes the Previous FA address and MN-FA authentication extension to\n\
    \   the visited AAA server.  If the visited AAA server is able\n   authenticate\
    \ the MN-FA authentication extension for the mobile, then\n   the visited AAA\

    \ latency),\n   or where mobile devices have limited computing power.  To achieve\n\
    \   these functions, AAA will be used to securely pass keys and SPIs\n   between\

  contents:
  - "3.3.  IKE and AAA\n   The use of IKE in the cdma2000 wireless architecture requires\

    \ AAA servers based on the\n   requirements in this document, and vice verse.\
    \  The AAA protocol\n   should be designed in a way so as to make conversions\
    \ to and from\n   RADIUS messages straight forward.  This will allow for the\n\
    \   development of gateway processes to aid in interoperability.  Note:\n   The\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document is very much about security.  These\
    \ requirements do not\n   require the serving and home networks to not be in the\
    \ same domain\n   nor must they have a direct relationship.  The serving network\n\
    \   requires authorization from the home network so that the serving\n   network\
    \ obtains proof it will get paid for services rendered to the\n   mobile.  This\
    \ implies the home network must authenticate the user.\n   AAA functions must\
    \ be performed in a secure manner.  The requirements\n   contained in section\
    \ 2 outline the security required.\n   Mobile IP supports authentication mechanisms\
    \ outside IP Security.\n   These mechanism may be enhanced in a cellular wireless\
    \ environment by\n   allowing a home AAA server to distribute keys to the serving\
    \ network.\n   Additionally, the home AAA server may be able to send a pre-shared\n\
    \   key to be used in Phase 1 ISAKMP security association establishment\n   between\
    \ FA and HA.  These keys would sent in encrypted form from the\n   home network\
    \ to the serving network.  As supported in the\n   requirements contained in section\
    \ 2, the encryption could be handled\n   via public cryptography and certificates.\n"
