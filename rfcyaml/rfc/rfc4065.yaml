  - "Abstract\n   The Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol and\
    \ the\n   Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) are experimental protocols designed\n\
    \   to accelerate IP handover between wireless access routers.  These\n   protocols\
    \ require IANA allocations for ICMP type and options, Stream\n   Control Transmission\
    \ Protocol (SCTP) Payload Protocol Identifiers,\n   port numbers, and registries\
    \ for certain formatted message options.\n   This document contains instructions\
    \ to IANA about which allocations\n   are required for the Seamoby protocols.\
    \  The ICMP subtype extension\n   format for Seamoby has been additionally designed\
    \ so that it can be\n   utilized by other experimental mobility protocols, and\
    \ the SCTP port\n   number is also available for other experimental mobility protocols.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol\n\
    \   [RFC4066] and the Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) [RFC4067] are\n   experimental\
    \ protocols designed to accelerate IP handover between\n   wireless access routers.\
    \  These protocols require IANA allocations\n   for ICMP options and type, SCTP\
    \ Payload Protocol Identifiers, port\n   numbers, and the establishment of registries\
    \ for certain formatted\n   message options.  Because the protocols are experimental,\
    \ there is no\n   guarantee that they will ever see widespread deployment in their\n\
    \   current form.  Consequently, it is prudent to conserve Internet\n   numbering\
    \ resources that might be needed for other protocols that\n   could see wider\
    \ deployment.  This document contains instructions to\n   IANA for the Seamoby\
    \ protocols.  Additionally, the ICMP subtype\n   extension format has been designed\
    \ so that it could be used by other\n   experimental mobility protocols.\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n\
    \   Allocation policy names Specification Required, IETF Consensus\n   Action,\
