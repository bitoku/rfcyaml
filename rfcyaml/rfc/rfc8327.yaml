  - "1.  Introduction\n   BGP Session Culling is the practice of ensuring BGP sessions\
    \ are\n   forcefully torn down before maintenance activities on a lower-layer\n\
    \   network commence -- activities that otherwise would affect the flow\n   of\
    \ data between the BGP speakers.  BGP Session Culling is the\n   practice of ensuring\
    \ BGP sessions are forcefully torn down before\n   commencing maintenance activities\
    \ (that otherwise would affect the\n   flow of data between the BGP speakers)\
    \ on a lower-layer network.\n   BGP Session Culling minimizes the amount of disruption\
    \ that lower-\n   layer network maintenance activities cause, by making BGP speakers\n\
    \   preemptively converge onto alternative paths while the lower-layer\n   network's\
    \ forwarding plane remains fully operational.\n   The grace period required for\
    \ a successful application of BGP Session\n   Culling is the sum of the time needed\
    \ to detect the loss of the BGP\n   session plus the time required for the BGP\
    \ speaker to converge onto\n   alternative paths.  The first value is often governed\
    \ by the BGP Hold\n   Timer (see Section 6.5 of [RFC4271]), which is commonly\
    \ between 90\n   and 180 seconds.  The second value is implementation specific,\
    \ but it\n   could be as much as 15 minutes when a router with a slow control\n\
    \   plane is receiving a full set of Internet routes.\n   Throughout this document,\
    \ the \"Caretaker\" is defined to be in control\n   of the lower-layer network,\
    \ while \"Operators\" directly administrate\n   the BGP speakers.  Operators and\
    \ Caretakers implementing BGP Session\n   Culling are encouraged to avoid using\
    \ a fixed grace period, and\n   instead to monitor forwarding-plane activity while\
    \ the culling is\n   taking place and to consider it complete once traffic levels\
    \ have\n   dropped to a minimum (Section 3.3).\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  BGP Session Culling\n   From the viewpoint of the Operator, there are two\
    \ types of BGP\n   Session Culling:\n   Voluntary BGP Session Teardown:  The Operator\
    \ initiates the teardown\n      of the potentially affected BGP session by issuing\
    \ an\n      Administrative Shutdown.\n   Involuntary BGP Session Teardown:  The\
    \ Caretaker of the lower-layer\n      network disrupts (higher-layer) BGP control-plane\
    \ traffic, causing\n      the BGP Hold Timers of the affected BGP session to expire,\n\
    \      subsequently triggering rerouting of end-user traffic.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Voluntary BGP Session Teardown Recommendations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Voluntary BGP Session Teardown Recommendations\n   Before an Operator commences\
    \ activities that can cause disruption to\n   the flow of data through the lower-layer\
    \ network, an Operator can\n   reduce loss of traffic by issuing an administrative\
    \ shutdown to all\n   BGP sessions running across the lower-layer network and\
    \ wait a few\n   minutes for data-plane traffic to subside.\n   While architectures\
    \ exist to facilitate quick network reconvergence\n   (such as BGP Prefix Independent\
    \ Convergence (PIC) [BGP_PIC]), an\n   Operator cannot assume the remote side\
    \ has such capabilities.  As\n   such, a grace period between the Administrative\
    \ Shutdown and the\n   impacting maintenance activities is warranted.\n   After\
    \ the maintenance activities have concluded, the Operator is\n   expected to restore\
    \ the BGP sessions to their original Administrative\n   state.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Maintenance Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Maintenance Considerations\n   Initiators of the Administrative Shutdown\
    \ MAY consider using Graceful\n   Shutdown [RFC8326] to facilitate smooth drainage\
    \ of traffic prior to\n   session tear down, and the Shutdown Communication [RFC8203]\
    \ to inform\n   the remote side on the nature and duration of the maintenance\n\
    \   activities.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Involuntary BGP Session Teardown Recommendations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Involuntary BGP Session Teardown Recommendations\n   In the case where\
    \ multilateral interconnection between BGP speakers\n   is facilitated through\
    \ a switched Layer 2 fabric, such as commonly\n   seen at Internet Exchange Points\
    \ (IXPs), different operational\n   considerations can apply.\n   Operational\
    \ experience shows that many Operators are unable to carry\n   out the Voluntary\
    \ BGP Session Teardown recommendations, because of\n   the operational cost and\
    \ risk of coordinating the two configuration\n   changes required.  This has an\
    \ adverse affect on Internet\n   performance.\n   In the absence of notifications\
    \ from the lower layer (e.g., Ethernet\n   link down) consistent with the planned\
    \ maintenance activities in a\n   switched Layer 2 fabric, the Caretaker of the\
    \ fabric could choose to\n   cull BGP sessions on behalf of the Operators connected\
    \ to the fabric.\n   Such culling of control-plane traffic will preempt the loss\
    \ of end-\n   user traffic by causing the expiration of BGP Hold Timers ahead\
    \ of\n   the moment where the expiration would occur without intervention from\n\
    \   the fabric's Caretaker.\n   In this scenario, BGP Session Culling is accomplished\
    \ as described in\n   the next subsection, through the application of a combined\
    \ Layer 3\n   and Layer 4 (Layer 3/4) packet filter deployed in the Caretaker's\n\
    \   switched fabric.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Packet-Filter Considerations\n   The peering LAN prefixes used by the\
    \ IXP form the control plane, and\n   the following considerations apply to the\
    \ packet-filter design:\n   o  The packet filter MUST only affect BGP traffic\
    \ specific to the\n      Layer 2 fabric, i.e., traffic forming part of the control\
    \ plane of\n      the system described, rather than multihop BGP traffic that\
    \ merely\n      transits.\n   o  The packet filter MUST only affect BGP, i.e.,\
    \ TCP port 179.\n   o  The packet filter SHOULD make provision for the bidirectional\n\
    \      nature of BGP, i.e., sessions may be established in either\n      direction.\n\
    \   o  The packet filter MUST affect all Address Family Identifiers.\n   Appendix\
    \ A contains examples of correct packet filters for various\n   platforms.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Hardware Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Hardware Considerations\n   Not all hardware is capable of deploying\
    \ combined Layer 3/4 filters\n   on Layer 2 ports; even on platforms that claim\
    \ support for such a\n   feature, limitations may exist or hardware resource allocation\n\
    \   failures may occur during filter deployment, which may cause\n   unexpected\
    \ results.  These problems may include:\n   o  Platform inability to apply Layer\
    \ 3/4 filters on ports that\n      already have Layer 2 filters applied.\n   o\
    \  Layer 3/4 filters supported for IPv4 but not for IPv6.\n   o  Layer 3/4 filters\
    \ supported on physical ports, but not on IEEE\n      802.1AX Link Aggregate ports\
    \ [IEEE802.1AX].\n   o  Failure of the Caretaker to apply filters to all IEEE\
    \ 802.1AX Link\n      Aggregate ports [IEEE802.1AX].\n   o  Limitations in Access\
    \ Control List (ACL) hardware mechanisms\n      causing filters not to be applied.\n\
    \   o  Fragmentation of ACL lookup memory causing transient ACL\n      application\
    \ problems that are resolved after ACL removal/\n      reapplication.\n   o  Temporary\
    \ service loss during hardware programming.\n   o  Reduction in hardware ACL capacity\
    \ if the platform enables\n      lossless ACL application.\n   It is advisable\
    \ for the Caretaker to be aware of the limitations of\n   their hardware and to\
    \ thoroughly test all complicated configurations\n   in advance to ensure that\
    \ problems don't occur during production\n   deployments.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Procedural Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Procedural Considerations\n   The Caretaker of the lower-layer network\
    \ can monitor data-plane\n   traffic (e.g., interface counters) and carry out\
    \ the maintenance\n   without impact to traffic once session culling is complete.\n\
    \   It is recommended that the packet filters be deployed for the\n   duration\
    \ of the maintenance only and be removed immediately after the\n   maintenance\
    \ is completed.  To prevent unnecessary troubleshooting, it\n   is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that Caretakers notify the affected Operators before\n   the maintenance takes\
    \ place and make it explicit that the Involuntary\n   BGP Session Culling methodology\
    \ will be applied.\n"
