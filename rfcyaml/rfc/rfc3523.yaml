  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the topology naming conventions that\
    \ are to be\n   used in reference to IEPREP phone calls.  These naming conventions\n\
    \   should be used to focus the IEPREP Working Group (WG) during\n   discussions\
    \ and  when writing requirements, gap analysis and other\n   solutions documents.\n\
    \   There has been much confusion on the IEPREP list as well as within\n   each\
    \ meeting about the topologies IEPREP is considering.  Hopefully\n   this document\
    \ will give each reader and author a reference set of\n   named architectures.\n\
    \   This memo attempts to be agnostic with regard to IP signaling or\n   control\
    \ protocols (SIP, MEGACO, etc), as well as any underlying\n   Quality of Service\
    \ (QOS) mechanisms (Diffserv, RSVP, NSIS, etc).\n"
- title: 1.1 Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.1 Motivation\n   Simply put, to get everyone referencing the same (named) topologies\n\
    \   in order to have useful and less confusing dialog to further this\n   working\
    \ group's efforts.\n"
- title: 1.2 Terms and Definitions
  contents:
  - "1.2 Terms and Definitions\n   The following acronyms need to be exploded for\
    \ clarity:\n      CSN = Circuit Switched Network\n      GW  = Gateway (CSN to\
    \ IP, or IP to CSN)\n"
- title: 2.  IEPREP Topologies
  contents:
  - "2.  IEPREP Topologies\n   There are 4 often mentioned, but very little documented\
    \ topologies\n   discussed within this WG's efforts so far.  The following subsections\n\
    \   name and describe each of the topologies.\n   The 4 topologies are (quickly):\n\
    \      Topology \"IP Bridging\"\n      Topology \"IP at the Start\"\n      Topology\
    \ \"IP at the End\"\n      Topology \"End-to-End IP\"\n"
