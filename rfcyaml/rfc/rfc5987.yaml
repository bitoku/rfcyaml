  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   By default, message header field parameters in HTTP ([RFC2616])\n\
    \   messages cannot carry characters outside the ISO-8859-1 character set\n  \
    \ ([ISO-8859-1]).  RFC 2231 ([RFC2231]) defines an encoding mechanism\n   for\
    \ use in MIME headers.  This document specifies an encoding\n   suitable for use\
    \ in HTTP header fields that is compatible with a\n   profile of the encoding\
    \ defined in RFC 2231.\n      Note: in the remainder of this document, RFC 2231\
    \ is only\n      referenced for the purpose of explaining the choice of features\n\
    \      that were adopted; they are therefore purely informative.\n      Note:\
    \ this encoding does not apply to message payloads transmitted\n      over HTTP,\
    \ such as when using the media type \"multipart/form-data\"\n      ([RFC2388]).\n"
- title: 2.  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n   This specification uses the ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form)\n\
    \   notation defined in [RFC5234].  The following core rules are included\n  \
    \ by reference, as defined in [RFC5234], Appendix B.1: ALPHA (letters),\n   DIGIT\
    \ (decimal 0-9), HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), and LWSP\n   (linear whitespace).\n\
    \   Note that this specification uses the term \"character set\" for\n   consistency\
    \ with other IETF specifications such as RFC 2277 (see\n   [RFC2277], Section\
    \ 3).  A more accurate term would be \"character\n   encoding\" (a mapping of\
    \ code points to octet sequences).\n"
- title: 3.  Comparison to RFC 2231 and Definition of the Encoding
  contents:
  - "3.  Comparison to RFC 2231 and Definition of the Encoding\n   RFC 2231 defines\
    \ several extensions to MIME.  The sections below\n   discuss if and how they\
    \ apply to HTTP header fields.\n   In short:\n   o  Parameter Continuations aren't\
    \ needed (Section 3.1),\n   o  Character Set and Language Information are useful,\
    \ therefore a\n      simple subset is specified (Section 3.2), and\n   o  Language\
    \ Specifications in Encoded Words aren't needed\n      (Section 3.3).\n"
- title: 3.1.  Parameter Continuations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Parameter Continuations\n   Section 3 of [RFC2231] defines a mechanism\
    \ that deals with the length\n   limitations that apply to MIME headers.  These\
    \ limitations do not\n   apply to HTTP ([RFC2616], Section 19.4.7).\n   Thus,\
    \ parameter continuations are not part of the encoding defined by\n   this specification.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Parameter Value Character Set and Language Information
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Parameter Value Character Set and Language Information\n   Section 4 of\
    \ [RFC2231] specifies how to embed language information\n   into parameter values,\
    \ and also how to encode non-ASCII characters,\n   dealing with restrictions both\
    \ in MIME and HTTP header parameters.\n   However, RFC 2231 does not specify a\
    \ mandatory-to-implement character\n   set, making it hard for senders to decide\
    \ which character set to use.\n   Thus, recipients implementing this specification\
    \ MUST support the\n   character sets \"ISO-8859-1\" [ISO-8859-1] and \"UTF-8\"\
    \ [RFC3629].\n   Furthermore, RFC 2231 allows the character set information to\
    \ be left\n   out.  The encoding defined by this specification does not allow\
    \ that.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Definition
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Definition\n   The syntax for parameters is defined in Section 3.6 of\
    \ [RFC2616]\n   (with RFC 2616 implied LWS translated to RFC 5234 LWSP):\n   \
    \  parameter     = attribute LWSP \"=\" LWSP value\n     attribute     = token\n\
    \     value         = token / quoted-string\n     quoted-string = <quoted-string,\
    \ defined in [RFC2616], Section 2.2>\n     token         = <token, defined in\
    \ [RFC2616], Section 2.2>\n   In order to include character set and language information,\
    \ this\n   specification modifies the RFC 2616 grammar to be:\n     parameter\
    \     = reg-parameter / ext-parameter\n     reg-parameter = parmname LWSP \"=\"\
    \ LWSP value\n     ext-parameter = parmname \"*\" LWSP \"=\" LWSP ext-value\n\
    \     parmname      = 1*attr-char\n     ext-value     = charset  \"'\" [ language\
    \ ] \"'\" value-chars\n                   ; like RFC 2231's <extended-initial-value>\n\
    \                   ; (see [RFC2231], Section 7)\n     charset       = \"UTF-8\"\
    \ / \"ISO-8859-1\" / mime-charset\n     mime-charset  = 1*mime-charsetc\n    \
    \ mime-charsetc = ALPHA / DIGIT\n                   / \"!\" / \"#\" / \"$\" /\
    \ \"%\" / \"&\"\n                   / \"+\" / \"-\" / \"^\" / \"_\" / \"`\"\n\
    \                   / \"{\" / \"}\" / \"~\"\n                   ; as <mime-charset>\
    \ in Section 2.3 of [RFC2978]\n                   ; except that the single quote\
    \ is not included\n                   ; SHOULD be registered in the IANA charset\
    \ registry\n     language      = <Language-Tag, defined in [RFC5646], Section\
    \ 2.1>\n     value-chars   = *( pct-encoded / attr-char )\n     pct-encoded  \
    \ = \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\n                   ; see [RFC3986], Section 2.1\n   \
    \  attr-char     = ALPHA / DIGIT\n                   / \"!\" / \"#\" / \"$\" /\
    \ \"&\" / \"+\" / \"-\" / \".\"\n                   / \"^\" / \"_\" / \"`\" /\
    \ \"|\" / \"~\"\n                   ; token except ( \"*\" / \"'\" / \"%\" )\n\
    \   Thus, a parameter is either a regular parameter (reg-parameter), as\n   previously\
    \ defined in Section 3.6 of [RFC2616], or an extended\n   parameter (ext-parameter).\n\
    \   Extended parameters are those where the left-hand side of the\n   assignment\
    \ ends with an asterisk character.\n   The value part of an extended parameter\
    \ (ext-value) is a token that\n   consists of three parts: the REQUIRED character\
    \ set name (charset),\n   the OPTIONAL language information (language), and a\
    \ character\n   sequence representing the actual value (value-chars), separated\
    \ by\n   single quote characters.  Note that both character set names and\n  \
    \ language tags are restricted to the US-ASCII character set, and are\n   matched\
    \ case-insensitively (see [RFC2978], Section 2.3 and [RFC5646],\n   Section 2.1.1).\n\
    \   Inside the value part, characters not contained in attr-char are\n   encoded\
    \ into an octet sequence using the specified character set.\n   That octet sequence\
    \ is then percent-encoded as specified in Section\n   2.1 of [RFC3986].\n   Producers\
    \ MUST use either the \"UTF-8\" ([RFC3629]) or the \"ISO-8859-1\"\n   ([ISO-8859-1])\
    \ character set.  Extension character sets (mime-\n   charset) are reserved for\
    \ future use.\n      Note: recipients should be prepared to handle encoding errors,\n\
    \      such as malformed or incomplete percent escape sequences, or non-\n   \
    \   decodable octet sequences, in a robust manner.  This specification\n     \
    \ does not mandate any specific behavior, for instance, the\n      following strategies\
    \ are all acceptable:\n      *  ignoring the parameter,\n      *  stripping a\
    \ non-decodable octet sequence,\n      *  substituting a non-decodable octet sequence\
    \ by a replacement\n         character, such as the Unicode character U+FFFD (Replacement\n\
    \         Character).\n      Note: the RFC 2616 token production ([RFC2616], Section\
    \ 2.2)\n      differs from the production used in RFC 2231 (imported from\n  \
    \    Section 5.1 of [RFC2045]) in that curly braces (\"{\" and \"}\") are\n  \
    \    excluded.  Thus, these two characters are excluded from the attr-\n     \
    \ char production as well.\n      Note: the <mime-charset> ABNF defined here differs\
    \ from the one in\n      Section 2.3 of [RFC2978] in that it does not allow the\
    \ single\n      quote character (see also RFC Errata ID 1912 [Err1912]).  In\n\
    \      practice, no character set names using that character have been\n     \
    \ registered at the time of this writing.\n"

- title: 3.3.  Language Specification in Encoded Words
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Language Specification in Encoded Words\n   Section 5 of [RFC2231] extends\
    \ the encoding defined in [RFC2047] to\n   also support language specification\
    \ in encoded words.  Although the\n   HTTP/1.1 specification does refer to RFC\

    \ it applies, and\n   whether it is implemented in practice (see\n   <http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/111>\
    \ for details).\n   Thus, this specification does not include this feature.\n"
- title: 4.  Guidelines for Usage in HTTP Header Field Definitions
  contents:
  - "4.  Guidelines for Usage in HTTP Header Field Definitions\n   Specifications\
    \ of HTTP header fields that use the extensions defined\n   in Section 3.2 ought\
    \ to clearly state that.  A simple way to achieve\n   this is to normatively reference\
    \ this specification, and to include\n   the ext-value production into the ABNF\
    \ for that header field.\n   For instance:\n     foo-header  = \"foo\" LWSP \"\
    :\" LWSP token \";\" LWSP title-param\n     title-param = \"title\" LWSP \"=\"\
    \ LWSP value\n                 / \"title*\" LWSP \"=\" LWSP ext-value\n     ext-value\

    \ feature defined in Section\n      3 of [RFC2231] makes it impossible to have\
    \ multiple instances of\n      extended parameters with identical parmname components,\
    \ as the\n      processing of continuations would become ambiguous.  Thus,\n \
    \     specifications using this extension are advised to disallow this\n     \
    \ case for compatibility with RFC 2231.\n"
- title: 4.1.  When to Use the Extension
  contents:
  - "4.1.  When to Use the Extension\n   Section 4.2 of [RFC2277] requires that protocol\
    \ elements containing\n   human-readable text are able to carry language information.\
    \  Thus,\n   the ext-value production ought to be always used when the parameter\n\
    \   value is of textual nature and its language is known.\n   Furthermore, the\
    \ extension ought to also be used whenever the\n   parameter value needs to carry\
    \ characters not present in the US-ASCII\n   ([USASCII]) character set (note that\
    \ it would be unacceptable to\n   define a new parameter that would be restricted\
    \ to a subset of the\n   Unicode character set).\n"
- title: 4.2.  Error Handling
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Error Handling\n   Header field specifications need to define whether multiple\
    \ instances\n   of parameters with identical parmname components are allowed,\
    \ and how\n   they should be processed.  This specification suggests that a\n\
    \   parameter using the extended syntax takes precedence.  This would\n   allow\
    \ producers to use both formats without breaking recipients that\n   do not understand\
    \ the extended syntax yet.\n   Example:\n     foo: bar; title=\"EURO exchange\
    \ rates\";\n               title*=utf-8''%e2%82%ac%20exchange%20rates\n   In this\
    \ case, the sender provides an ASCII version of the title for\n   legacy recipients,\
    \ but also includes an internationalized version for\n   recipients understanding\
    \ this specification -- the latter obviously\n   ought to prefer the new syntax\
    \ over the old one.\n      Note: at the time of this writing, many implementations\
    \ failed to\n      ignore the form they do not understand, or prioritize the ASCII\n\
    \      form although the extended syntax was present.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The format described in this document makes it\
    \ possible to transport\n   non-ASCII characters, and thus enables character \"\
    spoofing\"\n   scenarios, in which a displayed value appears to be something other\n\
    \   than it is.\n   Furthermore, there are known attack scenarios relating to\
    \ decoding\n   UTF-8.\n   See Section 10 of [RFC3629] for more information on\
    \ both topics.\n   In addition, the extension specified in this document makes\
    \ it\n   possible to transport multiple language variants for a single\n   parameter,\
    \ and such use might allow spoofing attacks, where different\n   language versions\
    \ of the same parameter are not equivalent.  Whether\n   this attack is useful\
