Survey of 18 February 1983
A survey was undertaken to determine how many hosts are able to respond to TELNET connections from a user at a class C site.
This requires, in addition to IP and TCP, participation in gateway routing via ICMP and handling of class C addresses.
The list of hosts was taken from RFC843, extracting only those hosts which are listed there as accepting TELNET connections.
The tests were run on 18 Feb 83 from 3 PM to 6:30 PM EST from a terminal concentrator located at 192.1.2.22, at BBN.
This net (192.1.2.xxx) is connected to the internet through a routing gateway, and this terminal concentrator speaks ICMP including redirection and reporting to the user.
The connection attempts were done manually by typing the dotted form addresses, so only three passes were made through the table of hosts.
Therefore a few may have been missed due to being down at these times.
