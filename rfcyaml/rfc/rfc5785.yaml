  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is increasingly common for Web-based protocols to require\
    \ the\n   discovery of policy or other information about a host (\"site-wide\n\
    \   metadata\") before making a request.  For example, the Robots\n   Exclusion\
    \ Protocol <http://www.robotstxt.org/> specifies a way for\n   automated processes\
    \ to obtain permission to access resources;\n   likewise, the Platform for Privacy\
    \ Preferences [W3C.REC-P3P-20020416]\n   tells user-agents how to discover privacy\
    \ policy beforehand.\n   While there are several ways to access per-resource metadata\
    \ (e.g.,\n   HTTP headers, WebDAV's PROPFIND [RFC4918]), the perceived overhead\n\
    \   (either in terms of client-perceived latency and/or deployment\n   difficulties)\
    \ associated with them often precludes their use in these\n   scenarios.\n   When\
    \ this happens, it is common to designate a \"well-known location\"\n   for such\
    \ data, so that it can be easily located.  However, this\n   approach has the\
    \ drawback of risking collisions, both with other such\n   designated \"well-known\
    \ locations\" and with pre-existing resources.\n   To address this, this memo\
    \ defines a path prefix in HTTP(S) URIs for\n   these \"well-known locations\"\
    , \"/.well-known/\".  Future specifications\n   that need to define a resource\
    \ for such site-wide metadata can\n   register their use to avoid collisions and\
    \ minimise impingement upon\n   sites' URI space.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Appropriate Use of Well-Known URIs
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Appropriate Use of Well-Known URIs\n   There are a number of possible ways\
    \ that applications could use Well-\n   known URIs.  However, in keeping with\
    \ the Architecture of the World-\n   Wide Web [W3C.REC-webarch-20041215], well-known\
    \ URIs are not intended\n   for general information retrieval or establishment\
    \ of large URI\n   namespaces on the Web.  Rather, they are designed to facilitate\n\
    \   discovery of information on a site when it isn't practical to use\n   other\
    \ mechanisms; for example, when discovering policy that needs to\n   be evaluated\
    \ before a resource is accessed, or when using multiple\n   round-trips is judged\
    \ detrimental to performance.\n   As such, the well-known URI space was created\
    \ with the expectation\n   that it will be used to make site-wide policy information\
    \ and other\n   metadata available directly (if sufficiently concise), or provide\n\
    \   references to other URIs that provide such metadata.\n"
- title: 2.  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Well-Known URIs
  contents:
  - "3.  Well-Known URIs\n   A well-known URI is a URI [RFC3986] whose path component\
    \ begins with\n   the characters \"/.well-known/\", and whose scheme is \"HTTP\"\
    , \"HTTPS\",\n   or another scheme that has explicitly been specified to use well-\n\
    \   known URIs.\n   Applications that wish to mint new well-known URIs MUST register\n\
    \   them, following the procedures in Section 5.1.\n   For example, if an application\
    \ registers the name 'example', the\n   corresponding well-known URI on 'http://www.example.com/'\
    \ would be\n   'http://www.example.com/.well-known/example'.\n   Registered names\
    \ MUST conform to the segment-nz production in\n   [RFC3986].\n   Note that this\
    \ specification defines neither how to determine the\n   authority to use for\
    \ a particular context, nor the scope of the\n   metadata discovered by dereferencing\
    \ the well-known URI; both should\n   be defined by the application itself.\n\
    \   Typically, a registration will reference a specification that defines\n  \
    \ the format and associated media type to be obtained by dereferencing\n   the\
    \ well-known URI.\n   It MAY also contain additional information, such as the\
    \ syntax of\n   additional path components, query strings and/or fragment identifiers\n\
    \   to be appended to the well-known URI, or protocol-specific details\n   (e.g.,\
    \ HTTP [RFC2616] method handling).\n   Note that this specification does not define\
    \ a format or media-type\n   for the resource located at \"/.well-known/\" and\
    \ clients should not\n   expect a resource to exist at that location.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This memo does not specify the scope of applicability\
    \ of metadata or\n   policy obtained from a well-known URI, and does not specify\
    \ how to\n   discover a well-known URI for a particular application.  Individual\n\
    \   applications using this mechanism must define both aspects.\n   Applications\
    \ minting new well-known URIs, as well as administrators\n   deploying them, will\
    \ need to consider several security-related\n   issues, including (but not limited\
    \ to) exposure of sensitive data,\n   denial-of-service attacks (in addition to\
    \ normal load issues), server\n   and client authentication, vulnerability to\
    \ DNS rebinding attacks,\n   and attacks where limited access to a server grants\
    \ the ability to\n   affect how well-known URIs are served.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  The Well-Known URI Registry\n   This document establishes the well-known\
    \ URI registry.\n   Well-known URIs are registered on the advice of one or more\n\
    \   Designated Experts (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a\n   Specification\
    \ Required (using terminology from [RFC5226]).  However,\n   to allow for the\
    \ allocation of values prior to publication, the\n   Designated Expert(s) may\
    \ approve registration once they are satisfied\n   that such a specification will\
    \ be published.\n   Registration requests should be sent to the\n   wellknown-uri-review@ietf.org\
    \ mailing list for review and comment,\n   with an appropriate subject (e.g.,\
    \ \"Request for well-known URI:\n   example\").\n   Before a period of 14 days\
    \ has passed, the Designated Expert(s) will\n   either approve or deny the registration\
    \ request, communicating this\n   decision both to the review list and to IANA.\
    \  Denials should include\n   an explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as\
    \ to how to make the\n   request successful.  Registration requests that are undetermined\
    \ for\n   a period longer than 21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention\n\
    \   (using the iesg@iesg.org mailing list) for resolution.\n"

    \  For Standards-Track RFCs, state \"IETF\".  For\n      others, give the name\
