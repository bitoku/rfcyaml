Definition of P2MP PW TLV for
Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping Mechanisms Abstract Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks.
This document describes a mechanism to verify connectivity of Point  to Multipoint (P2MP)
Pseudowires (PWs) using LSP Ping.
Introduction A Point to Multipoint (P2MP)
Pseudowire (PW) emulates the essential attributes of a unidirectional P2MP Telecommunications service such as P2MP ATM over a Public Switched Network (PSN).
Requirements for P2MP PWs are described in [RFC7338].
P2MP PWs are carried over a P2MP MPLS LSP.
The procedures for P2MP PW signaling using BGP are described in [RFC7117]; LDP for single segment P2MP PWs is described in [RFC8338].
Many P2MP PWs can share the same P2MP MPLS LSP; this arrangement is called an "Aggregate P2MP Tree".
An Aggregate P2MP Tree requires an upstream assigned label so that on the Leaf PE (L PE), the traffic can be associated with a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) instance.
When a P2MP MPLS LSP carries only one VPN or VPLS service instance, the arrangement is called an "Inclusive P2MP Tree".
For an Inclusive P2MP Tree, the P2MP MPLS
LSP label itself can uniquely identify the VPN or VPLS service being carried over the P2MP MPLS LSP.
The P2MP MPLS LSP can also be used in the Selective P2MP Tree arrangement to carry multicast traffic.
In a Selective P2MP Tree arrangement, traffic to each multicast group in a VPN or VPLS instance is carried by a separate unique P2MP LSP.
In an Aggregate Selective P2MP Tree arrangement, traffic to a set of multicast groups from different VPN or VPLS instances is carried over the same shared P2MP LSP.
The P2MP MPLS LSPs are setup using either P2MP RSVP TE [RFC4875] or Multipoint LDP (mDLP)
Mechanisms for fault detection and isolation for data plane failures for P2MP MPLS
LSPs are specified in [RFC6425].
This document describes a mechanism to detect data plane failures for P2MP PW carried over P2MP MPLS LSPs.
This document defines a new P2MP Pseudowire sub TLV for the Target Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Stack for P2MP PWs.
The P2MP Pseudowire sub TLV is added in the Target FEC Stack TLV by the originator of the echo request at the Root PE (R PE) to inform the receiver at the Leaf PE (L PE) of the P2MP PW being tested.
Support for multi segment PWs is out of scope of this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
This document introduces a new LSP Ping Target FEC Stack sub TLV, the P2MP Pseudowire sub TLV, to identify the P2MP PW under test at the P2MP Leaf PE (L PE).
The P2MP Pseudowire sub TLV has the format shown in Figure 1.
This TLV is included in the echo request sent over P2MP PW by the originator of the request.
The Attachment Group Identifier (AGI), as described in Section 3.4.2 of [RFC4446], in P2MP Pseudowire sub TLV identifies the VPLS instance.
The Originating Router's IP address is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the P2MP PW root.
The address family of the IP address is determined by the IP Addr Len field. 0
P2MP Trees, the echo request is sent using the P2MP MPLS LSP label.
For Aggregate Inclusive and Aggregate Selective P2MP Trees, the echo request is sent using a label stack of [P2MP MPLS LSP label, upstream assigned P2MP PW label].
The P2MP MPLS LSP label is the outer label and the upstream assigned P2MP PW label is the inner label.
Encapsulation of OAM Ping Packets
The LSP Ping echo request packet is encapsulated with the MPLS label stack as described in previous sections, followed by one of the two encapsulation options:  GAL [RFC6426] followed by an IPv4 (0x0021) or IPv6 (0x0057)
type Associated Channel Header (ACH)
To ensure interoperability, implementations of this document MUST support both encapsulations.
In this section, we explain the operation of the LSP Ping over a P2MP PW.
Figure 2 shows a P2MP PW PW1 setup from Root PE R PE1, to Leaf PEs (L PE2, L PE3, and L PE4).
The transport LSP associated with the P2MP PW1 can be mLDP
MPLS LSP or P2MP TE tunnel.
When an operator wants to perform a connectivity check for the P2MP PW1, the operator initiates an LSP Ping echo request from Root PE R PE1, with the Target FEC Stack TLV containing the P2MP Pseudowire sub TLV in the echo request packet.
For an Inclusive P2MP Tree arrangement, the echo request packet is sent over the P2MP MPLS LSP with one of the following two encapsulation options:  {P2MP LSP label, GAL} MPLS label stack and IPv4 or IPv6 ACH.
{P2MP LSP label} MPLS label stack and PW ACH.
For an Aggregate Inclusive Tree arrangement, the echo request packet is sent over the P2MP MPLS LSP with one of the following two encapsulation options:  {P2MP LSP label, P2MP PW upstream assigned label, GAL} MPLS label stack and IPv4 or IPv6 ACH.
{P2MP LSP label, P2MP PW upstream assigned label} MPLS label stack and PW ACH.
The intermediate P routers do MPLS label swap and replication based on the incoming MPLS LSP label.
Once the echo request packet reaches L PEs, L PEs use the GAL and the IPv4/IPv6 ACH Channel header or PW ACH as the case may be, to determine that the packet is an OAM Packet.
The L PEs process the packet and perform checks for the P2MP Pseudowire sub TLV present in the Target FEC Stack TLV as described in Section 4.4 in [RFC8029] and respond according to the processing rules in that document.
The procedures described in [RFC6425] for preventing congestion of Echo Responses (Echo Jitter TLV in Section 3.3 of [RFC6425]) and limiting the echo reply to a single L PE (Node Address P2MP Responder Identifier TLV in Section 3.2 of [RFC6425]) should be applied to P2MP PW LSP Ping.
The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new security considerations beyond those that already apply to [RFC6425].
This document defines a new sub TLV type included in the Target
FEC Stack TLV (TLV Type 1)
IANA has assigned the following sub TLV type value from the "Sub TLVs for TLV Types 1, 16, and 21" sub registry within the "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Ping Parameters" registry: 37 P2MP Pseudowire
