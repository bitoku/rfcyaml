  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   Users and vendors have expressed a strong need for IP routers\
    \ from\n   different vendors that can interoperate using a common Interior\n \
    \  Gateway Protocol (IGP).  There is therefore an urgent requirement for\n   a\
    \ high-functionality non-proprietary 'open' IGP that will be\n   ubiquitously\
    \ available from all IP router vendors.\n   The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)\
    \ routing protocol [1] was\n   developed by the IETF to fill this need.  This\
    \ Applicability\n   Statement specifies the circumstances under which OSPF must\
    \ be\n   implemented by router vendors.  The history of OSPF development and\n\
    \   the reasoning behind this Applicability Statement will be found in\n   [5].\n\
    \   This Applicability Statement places a requirement on vendors claiming\n  \
    \ conformance to this standard, in order to assure that users will have\n   the\
    \ option of deploying OSPF when they need a multivendor,\n   interoperable IGP\
    \ in their environment.  Users are of course free to\n   use whatever routing\
    \ protocol best meets their requirements.\n"
- title: 2.  APPLICABILITY OF OSPF
  contents:
  - "2.  APPLICABILITY OF OSPF\n   An IP router that implements any routing protocol\
    \ (other than static\n   routes) is required to implement OSPF [1] and the OSPF\
    \ MIB [2].\n   Within OSPF, implementation of all features except TOS (Type-of-\n\
    \   Service) routing is required; implementation of TOS routing is\n   recommended.\n\
    \   This requirement does not prevent a router from implementing other\n   routing\
    \ protocols in addition to OSPF.  Complete and definitive\n   requirements on\
    \ all aspects of an IP router will be found in a\n   forthcoming Applicability\
    \ Statement: \"Requirements for IP Routers\"\n   [4], currently in preparation\
    \ in the IETF.  \"Requirements for IP\n   Routers\", when it becomes a Standard,\
    \ will take precedence if its\n   requirements for OSPF should conflict with this\
    \ present RFC.\n   It should be noted that OSPF is intended for use by routers\
    \ for\n   exchanging dynamic routing information, and not for use by hosts.  As\n\
    \   discussed in Section 3.3.1.4 of STD-2, \"Requirements for Internet\n   Hosts\
    \ -- Communication Layers\" [3], 'wiretapping' of routing\n   protocols by hosts\
    \ is not recommended.  Recommended mechanisms for a\n   host to use for discovering\
    \ local routers and detecting dead routers\n   will be found in [3].  In particular,\
    \ the ICMP Router Discovery\n   messages, under development, will provide a standard\
    \ way for a host\n   to learn the addresses of local routers [6].\n"
