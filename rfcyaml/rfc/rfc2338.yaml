- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are a number of methods that an end-host can use to\
    \ determine\n   its first hop router towards a particular IP destination.  These\n\
    \   include running (or snooping) a dynamic routing protocol such as\n   Routing\
    \ Information Protocol [RIP] or OSPF version 2 [OSPF], running\n   an ICMP router\
    \ discovery client [DISC] or using a statically\n   configured default route.\n\
    \   Running a dynamic routing protocol on every end-host may be\n   infeasible\
    \ for a number of reasons, including administrative\n   overhead, processing overhead,\
    \ security issues, or lack of a protocol\n   implementation for some platforms.\
    \  Neighbor or router discovery\n   protocols may require active participation\
    \ by all hosts on a network,\n   leading to large timer values to reduce protocol\
    \ overhead in the face\n   of large numbers of hosts.  This can result in a significant\
    \ delay in\n   the detection of a lost (i.e., dead) neighbor, which may introduce\n\
    \   unacceptably long \"black hole\" periods.\n   The use of a statically configured\
    \ default route is quite popular; it\n   minimizes configuration and processing\
    \ overhead on the end-host and\n   is supported by virtually every IP implementation.\
    \  This mode of\n   operation is likely to persist as dynamic host configuration\n\
    \   protocols [DHCP] are deployed, which typically provide configuration\n   for\
    \ an end-host IP address and default gateway.  However, this\n   creates a single\
    \ point of failure.  Loss of the default router\n   results in a catastrophic\
    \ event, isolating all end-hosts that are\n   unable to detect any alternate path\
    \ that may be available.\n   The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is\
    \ designed to\n   eliminate the single point of failure inherent in the static\
    \ default\n   routed environment.  VRRP specifies an election protocol that\n\
    \   dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the\n  \
    \ VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router controlling the IP\n   address(es) associated\
    \ with a virtual router is called the Master,\n   and forwards packets sent to\
    \ these IP addresses.  The election\n   process provides dynamic fail-over in\
    \ the forwarding responsibility\n   should the Master become unavailable.  Any\
    \ of the virtual router's IP\n   addresses on a LAN can then be used as the default\
    \ first hop router\n   by end-hosts.  The advantage gained from using VRRP is\
    \ a higher\n   availability default path without requiring configuration of dynamic\n\
    \   routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.\n   VRRP provides\
    \ a function similar to a Cisco Systems, Inc. proprietary\n   protocol named Hot\
    \ Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) [HSRP] and to a\n   Digital Equipment Corporation,\
    \ Inc. proprietary protocol named IP\n   Standby Protocol [IPSTB].\n   The key\
    \ words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"\
    SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n\
    \   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].\n   The IESG/IETF\
    \ take no position regarding the validity or scope of any\n   intellectual property\
    \ right or other rights that might be claimed to\n   pertain to the implementation\
    \ or use of the technology, or the extent\n   to which any license under such\
    \ rights might or might not be\n   available.  See the IETF IPR web page at http://www.ietf.org/ipr.html\n\

  - "2.1 IP Address Backup\n   Backup of IP addresses is the primary function of the\
    \ Virtual Router\n   Redundancy Protocol.  While providing election of a Virtual\
    \ Router\n   Master and the additional functionality described below, the protocol\n\

- title: 2.2 Preferred Path Indication
  contents:
  - "2.2 Preferred Path Indication\n   A simple model of Master election among a set\
    \ of redundant routers is\n   to treat each router with equal preference and claim\
    \ victory after\n   converging to any router as Master.  However, there are likely\
    \ to be\n   many environments where there is a distinct preference (or range of\n\
    \   preferences) among the set of redundant routers.  For example, this\n   preference\
    \ may be based upon access link cost or speed, router\n   performance or reliability,\
    \ or other policy considerations.  The\n   protocol should allow the expression\
    \ of this relative path preference\n   in an intuitive manner, and guarantee Master\
    \ convergence to the most\n   preferential router currently available.\n"
- title: 2.3 Minimization of Unnecessary Service Disruptions
  contents:
  - "2.3 Minimization of Unnecessary Service Disruptions\n   Once Master election\
    \ has been performed then any unnecessary\n   transitions between Master and Backup\
    \ routers can result in a\n   disruption in service.  The protocol should ensure\
    \ after Master\n   election that no state transition is triggered by any Backup\
    \ router\n   of equal or lower preference as long as the Master continues to\n\
    \   function properly.\n   Some environments may find it beneficial to avoid the\
    \ state\n   transition triggered when a router becomes available that is more\n\
    \   preferential than the current Master.  It may be useful to support an\n  \
    \ override of the immediate convergence to the preferred path.\n"

  - "2.4 Extensible Security\n   The virtual router functionality is applicable to\
    \ a wide range of\n   internetworking environments that may employ different security\n\
    \   policies.  The protocol should require minimal configuration and\n   overhead\
    \ in the insecure operation, provide for strong authentication\n   when increased\
    \ security is required, and allow integration of new\n   security mechanisms without\
    \ breaking backwards compatible operation.\n"
- title: 2.5 Efficient Operation over Extended LANs
  contents:
  - "2.5 Efficient Operation over Extended LANs\n   Sending IP packets on a multiaccess\
    \ LAN requires mapping from an IP\n   address to a MAC address.  The use of the\
    \ virtual router MAC address\n   in an extended LAN employing learning bridges\
    \ can have a significant\n   effect on the bandwidth overhead of packets sent\
    \ to the virtual\n   router.  If the virtual router MAC address is never used\
    \ as the\n   source address in a link level frame then the station location is\n\
    \   never learned, resulting in flooding of all packets sent to the\n   virtual\
    \ router.  To improve the efficiency in this environment the\n   protocol should:\
    \ 1) use the virtual router MAC as the source in a\n   packet sent by the Master\
    \ to trigger station learning; 2) trigger a\n   message immediately after transitioning\
    \ to Master to update the\n   station learning; and 3) trigger periodic messages\
    \ from the Master to\n   maintain the station learning cache.\n"
- title: 3.0 VRRP Overview
  contents:
  - "3.0 VRRP Overview\n   VRRP specifies an election protocol to provide the virtual\
    \ router\n   function described earlier.  All protocol messaging is performed\n\
    \   using IP multicast datagrams, thus the protocol can operate over a\n   variety\
    \ of multiaccess LAN technologies supporting IP multicast.\n   Each VRRP virtual\
    \ router has a single well-known MAC address\n   allocated to it.  This document\
    \ currently only details the mapping to\n   networks using the IEEE 802 48-bit\
    \ MAC address.  The virtual router\n   MAC address is used as the source in all\
    \ periodic VRRP messages sent\n   by the Master router to enable bridge learning\
    \ in an extended LAN.\n   A virtual router is defined by its virtual router identifier\
    \ (VRID)\n   and a set of IP addresses.  A VRRP router may associate a virtual\n\
    \   router with its real addresses on an interface, and may also be\n   configured\
    \ with additional virtual router mappings and priority for\n   virtual routers\
    \ it is willing to backup.  The mapping between VRID\n   and addresses must be\
    \ coordinated among all VRRP routers on a LAN.\n   However, there is no restriction\
    \ against reusing a VRID with a\n   different address mapping on different LANs.\
    \  The scope of each\n   virtual router is restricted to a single LAN.\n   To\
    \ minimize network traffic, only the Master for each virtual router\n   sends\
    \ periodic VRRP Advertisement messages.  A Backup router will not\n   attempt\
    \ to pre-empt the Master unless it has higher priority.  This\n   eliminates service\
    \ disruption unless a more preferred path becomes\n   available.  It's also possible\
    \ to administratively prohibit all pre-\n   emption attempts.  The only exception\
    \ is that a VRRP router will\n   always become Master of any virtual router associated\
    \ with addresses\n   it owns.  If the Master becomes unavailable then the highest\
    \ priority\n   Backup will transition to Master after a short delay, providing\
    \ a\n   controlled transition of the virtual router responsibility with\n   minimal\
    \ service interruption.\n   VRRP defines three types of authentication providing\
    \ simple\n   deployment in insecure environments, added protection against\n \
    \  misconfiguration, and strong sender authentication in security\n   conscious\
    \ environments.  Analysis of the protection provided and\n   vulnerability of\
    \ each mechanism is deferred to Section 10.0 Security\n   Considerations.  In\
    \ addition new authentication types and data can be\n   defined in the future\
    \ without affecting the format of the fixed\n   portion of the protocol packet,\
    \ thus preserving backward compatible\n   operation.\n   The VRRP protocol design\
    \ provides rapid transition from Backup to\n   Master to minimize service interruption,\
    \ and incorporates\n   optimizations that reduce protocol complexity while guaranteeing\n\
    \   controlled Master transition for typical operational scenarios.  The\n   optimizations\
    \ result in an election protocol with minimal runtime\n   state requirements,\
    \ minimal active protocol states, and a single\n   message type and sender.  The\
    \ typical operational scenarios are\n   defined to be two redundant routers and/or\
    \ distinct path preferences\n   among each router.  A side effect when these assumptions\
    \ are violated\n   (i.e., more than two redundant paths all with equal preference)\
    \ is\n   that duplicate packets may be forwarded for a brief period during\n \
    \  Master election.  However, the typical scenario assumptions are\n   likely\
    \ to cover the vast majority of deployments, loss of the Master\n   router is\
    \ infrequent, and the expected duration in Master election\n   convergence is\
    \ quite small ( << 1 second ).  Thus the VRRP\n   optimizations represent significant\
    \ simplifications in the protocol\n   design while incurring an insignificant\
    \ probability of brief network\n   degradation.\n"

    \ where\n   the topology is not symmetric.\n   The IP source address of an ICMP\

    \  One\n   method to deduce the virtual router used is to examine the\n   destination\
    \ MAC address in the packet that triggered the redirect.\n   It may be useful\

- title: 8.2  Host ARP Requests

    \ router MUST NOT respond with its physical MAC address.  This\n   allows the\
    \ client to always use the same MAC address regardless of\n   the current Master\
    \ router.\n   When a VRRP router restarts or boots, it SHOULD not send any ARP\n\
    \   messages with its physical MAC address for the IP address it owns, it\n  \
    \ should only send ARP messages that include Virtual MAC addresses.\n   This may\
    \ entail:\n    - When configuring an interface, VRRP routers should broadcast\
    \ a\n      gratuitous ARP request containing the virtual router MAC address\n\
    \      for each IP address on that interface.\n    - At system boot, when initializing\
    \ interfaces for VRRP operation;\n      delay gratuitous ARP requests and ARP\

- title: 9.2  Operation over Token Ring
  contents:
  - "9.2  Operation over Token Ring\n   Token ring has several characteristics which\
    \ make running VRRP\n   difficult. These include:\n    - In order to switch to\
    \ a new master located on a different bridge\n      token ring segment from the\
    \ previous master when using source\n      route bridges, a mechanism is required\
    \ to update cached source\n      route information.\n    - No general multicast\
    \ mechanism supported across old and new token\n      ring adapter implementations.\
    \ While many newer token ring adapters\n      support group addresses, token ring\
    \ functional address support is\n      the only generally available multicast\
    \ mechanism. Due to the\n      limited number of token ring functional addresses\
    \ these may\n      collide with other usage of the same token ring functional\n\
    \      addresses.\n   Due to these difficulties, the preferred mode of operation\
    \ over token\n   ring will be to use a token ring functional address for the VRID\n\
    \   virtual MAC address. Token ring functional addresses have the two\n   high\
    \ order bits in the first MAC address octet set to B'1'.  They\n   range from\
    \ 03-00-00-00-00-80 to 03-00-02-00-00-00 (canonical format).\n   However, unlike\
    \ multicast addresses, there is only one unique\n   functional address per bit\
    \ position. The functional addresses\n   addresses  03-00-00-10-00-00 through\
    \ 03-00-02-00-00-00 are reserved\n   by the Token Ring Architecture [TKARCH] for\
    \ user-defined\n   applications.  However, since there are only 12 user-defined\
    \ token\n   ring functional addresses, there may be other non-IP protocols using\n\
    \   the same functional address. Since the Novell IPX [IPX] protocol uses\n  \
    \ the 03-00-00-10-00-00 functional address, operation of VRRP over\n   token ring\
    \ will avoid use of this functional address. In general,\n   token ring VRRP users\
    \ will be responsible for resolution of other\n   user-defined token ring functional\
    \ address conflicts.\n   VRIDs are mapped directly to token ring functional addresses.\
    \ In\n   order to decrease the likelihood of functional address conflicts,\n \
    \  allocation will begin with the largest functional address. Most non-\n   IP\
    \ protocols use the first or first couple user-defined functional\n   addresses\
    \ and it is expected that VRRP users will choose VRIDs\n   sequentially starting\
    \ with 1.\n   VRID      Token Ring Functional Address\n   ----      -----------------------------\n\

    \     11             03-00-00-08-00-00\n   Or more succinctly, octets 3 and 4\
    \ of the functional address are\n   equal to (0x4000 >> (VRID - 1)) in non-canonical\
    \ format.\n   Since a functional address cannot be used used as a MAC level source\n\
    \   address, the real MAC address is used as the MAC source address in\n   VRRP\
    \ advertisements. This is not a problem for bridges since packets\n   addressed\
    \ to functional addresses will be sent on the spanning-tree\n   explorer path\
    \ [802.1D].\n   The functional address mode of operation MUST be implemented by\n\
    \   routers supporting VRRP on token ring.\n   Additionally, routers MAY support\
    \ unicast mode of operation to take\n   advantage of newer token ring adapter\
    \ implementations which support\n   non-promiscuous reception for multiple unicast\
    \ MAC addresses and to\n   avoid both the multicast traffic and usage conflicts\
    \ associated with\n   the use of token ring functional addresses. Unicast mode\
    \ uses the\n   same mapping of VRIDs to virtual MAC addresses as Ethernet.  However,\n\
    \   one important difference exists. ARP request/reply packets contain\n   the\
    \ virtual MAC address as the source MAC address. The reason for\n   this is that\
    \ some token ring driver implementations keep a cache of\n   MAC address/source\
    \ routing information independent of the ARP cache.\n   Hence, these implementations\
    \ need have to receive a packet with the\n   virtual MAC address as the source\
    \ address in order to transmit to\n   that MAC address in a source-route bridged\
    \ network.\n   Unicast mode on token ring has one limitation which should be\n\
    \   considered.  If there are VRID routers on different source-route\n   bridge\
    \ segments and there are host implementations which keep their\n   source-route\
    \ information in the ARP cache and do not listen to\n   gratuitous ARPs, these\
    \ hosts will not update their ARP source-route\n   information correctly when\
    \ a switch-over occurs. The only possible\n   solution is to put all routers with\
    \ the same VRID on the same source-\n   bridge segment and use techniques to prevent\
    \ that bridge segment from\n   being a single point of failure. These techniques\
    \ are beyond the\n   scope this document.\n   For both the multicast and unicast\
    \ mode of operation, VRRP\n   advertisements sent to 224.0.0.18 should be encapsulated\
    \ as described\n   in [RFC1469].\n"

  - "10. Security Considerations\n   VRRP is designed for a range of internetworking\
    \ environments that may\n   employ different security policies.  The protocol\
    \ includes several\n   authentication methods ranging from no authentication,\
    \ simple clear\n   text passwords, and strong authentication using IP Authentication\n\
    \   with MD5 HMAC.  The details on each approach including possible\n   attacks\
    \ and recommended environments follows.\n   Independent of any authentication\
    \ type VRRP includes a mechanism\n   (setting TTL=255, checking on receipt) that\
    \ protects against VRRP\n   packets being injected from another remote network.\
    \  This limits most\n   vulnerabilities to local attacks.\n"
- title: 10.1 No Authentication
  contents:
  - "10.1 No Authentication\n   The use of this authentication type means that VRRP\
    \ protocol\n   exchanges are not authenticated.  This type of authentication SHOULD\n\
    \   only be used in environments were there is minimal security risk and\n   little\
    \ chance for configuration errors (e.g., two VRRP routers on a\n   LAN).\n"
- title: 10.2 Simple Text Password
  contents:
  - "10.2 Simple Text Password\n   The use of this authentication type means that\
    \ VRRP protocol\n   exchanges are authenticated by a simple clear text password.\n\
    \   This type of authentication is useful to protect against accidental\n   misconfiguration\
    \ of routers on a LAN.  It protects against routers\n   inadvertently backing\
    \ up another router.  A new router must first be\n   configured with the correct\
    \ password before it can run VRRP with\n   another router.  This type of authentication\
    \ does not protect against\n   hostile attacks where the password can be learned\
    \ by a node snooping\n   VRRP packets on the LAN.  The Simple Text Authentication\
    \ combined\n   with the TTL check makes it difficult for a VRRP packet to be sent\n\
    \   from another LAN to disrupt VRRP operation.\n   This type of authentication\
    \ is RECOMMENDED when there is minimal risk\n   of nodes on a LAN actively disrupting\
    \ VRRP operation.  If this type\n   of authentication is used the user should\
    \ be aware that this clear\n   text password is sent frequently, and therefore\
    \ should not be the\n   same as any security significant password.\n"
- title: 10.3 IP Authentication Header
  contents:
  - "10.3 IP Authentication Header\n   The use of this authentication type means the\

    \ ESP\n   and AH\", [HMAC].  This provides strong protection against\n   configuration\
    \ errors, replay attacks, and packet\n   corruption/modification.\n   This type\
    \ of authentication is RECOMMENDED when there is limited\n   control over the\
    \ administration of nodes on a LAN.  While this type\n   of authentication does\
    \ protect the operation of VRRP, there are other\n   types of attacks that may\
