    \   the key features of Triggered Extensions to RIP to Support Demand\n   Circuits\

  contents:
  - "1. Protocol Documents\n   \"Triggered Extensions to RIP to Support Demand Circuits\"\
    \ [2] suggests\n   an enhancement to the \"Routing Internet Protocol\" (RIP) [3]\
    \ and\n   \"RIP-2\" [4] to allow them to run more cost-effectively on Wide Area\n\
    \   Networks (WANs).\n"
- title: 2. Applicability
  contents:
  - "2. Applicability\n   Triggered RIP requires that there is an underlying mechanism\
    \ for\n   determining unreachability in a finite predictable period.\n   The triggered\
    \ extensions to RIP are particularly appropriate for WANs\n   where the cost -\
    \ either financial or packet overhead - would make\n   periodic transmission of\
    \ routing (or service advertising) updates\n   unacceptable:\n   o  Connection\
    \ oriented Public Data Networks - for example X.25 packet\n      switched networks\
    \ or ISDN.\n   o  Point-to-point links supporting PPP link quality monitoring\
    \ or\n      echo request to determine link failure.\n   A triggered RIP implementation\
    \ runs standard RIP on Local Area\n   Networks  (LANs) allowing them to interoperate\
    \ transparently with\n   implementations adhering to the original specifications.\n"
- title: 3. Key Features
  contents:
  - "3. Key Features\n   The proposal shares the same basic algorithms as RIP or RIP-2\
    \ when\n   running on LANs; Packet formats, broadcast frequency, triggered\n \
    \  update operation and  database timeouts are all unmodified.\n   The new features\
    \ operate on WANs which use switched circuits on\n   demand to achieve intermittent\
    \ connectivity; Or on permanent WAN\n   connections where there is a desire to\
    \ keep routing packet overhead\n   to a minimum.  Instead of using periodic 'broadcasts',\
    \ information is\n   only sent as triggered updates.  The proposal makes use of\
    \ features\n   of the underlying connection oriented service to provide feedback\
    \ on\n   connectivity.\n"
- title: 3.1 Triggered Updates
  contents:
  - "3.1 Triggered Updates\n   Updates are only sent on the WAN when an event changes\
    \ the routing\n   database.  Each update is retransmitted until acknowledged.\n\
    \   Information received in an update is not timed out.\n   The packet format\
    \ of a RIP response is modified (with a different\n   unique command field) to\
    \ include sequence number information.  An\n   acknowledgement packet is also\
    \ defined.\n"
- title: 3.2 Circuit Manager
  contents:
  - "3.2 Circuit Manager\n   The circuit manager running below the IP network layer\
    \ is responsible\n   for establishing a circuit to the next hop router whenever\
    \ there is\n   data (or a routing update) to transfer.  After a period of inactivity\n\
    \   the circuit will be closed by the circuit manager.\n   If the circuit manager\
    \ fails to make a connection a circuit down\n   indication is sent to the routing\
    \ application.  The circuit manager\n   will then attempt at (increasing) intervals\
    \ to establish a\n   connection.   When successful a circuit up indication is\
    \ sent to the\n   routing application.\n"
- title: 3.3 Technology Restrictions
  contents:
  - "3.3 Technology Restrictions\n   There is a small but nontrivial possiblility\
    \ of an incorrectly\n   configured or poorly operating link causing severe data\
    \ loss,\n   resulting in a 'black hole' in routing. This is often unidirectional\n\
    \   - the link that route updates cross works properly, but not the\n   return\
    \ path.\n   Triggered RIP will NOT fuction properly (and should NOT be used) if\
    \ a\n   routing information will be retained/advertised for an arbitrarily\n \
    \  long period of time (until an update in the opposite direction fails\n   to\
    \ obtain a response).\n   To detect black holes in technologies which use PPP\
    \ encapsulation,\n   either Echo Request/Response or Link Quality Monitoring should\
    \ be\n   used.  When a black hole is detected a circuit down indication must\n\
    \   be sent to the routing application.\n   Current (and future) technologies\
    \ which do not use PPP, need to use\n   an equivalent 'are-you-there' mechanism\
    \ - or should NOT be used with\n   Triggered RIP.\n"
- title: 3.4 Presumption of Reachability
  contents:
  - "3.4 Presumption of Reachability\n   In a stable network there is no requirement\
    \ to propagate routing\n   information on a circuit, so if no routing information\
    \ is (being)\n   received on a circuit it is assumed that:\n   o  The most recently\
    \ received information is accurate.\n   o  The intervening path is operational\
    \ (although there may be no\n      current connection).\n   If the circuit manager\
    \ determines that the intervening path is NOT\n   operational routing information\
    \ previously received on that circuit\n   is timed out.  It is worth stressing\
    \ that it can be ANY routed\n   datagram which triggers the event.\n   When the\
    \ circuit manager re-establishes a connection, the application\n   exchanges full\
    \ routing information with its peer.\n"
- title: 3.5 Routing Information Flow Control
  contents:
  - "3.5 Routing Information Flow Control\n   If the circuit manager reports a circuit\
    \ as down, the routing\n   application is flow controlled from sending further\
    \ information on\n   the circuit.\n"
- title: 4. Relationship to Demand RIP
  contents:
  - "4. Relationship to Demand RIP\n   The Triggered RIP proposal [2] has a number\
    \ of efficiency advantages\n   over the Demand RIP proposal [5]:\n   o  When routing\
    \ information changes Demand RIP sends the full\n      database to its partner.\n\
    \      Once a router has exchanged all routing information with its\n      partner,\
    \ Triggered RIP sends only the changed information to the\n      partner.  This\
    \ can dramatically decrease the quantity of\n      information requiring propagation\
    \ when a route change occurs.\n   o  Demand RIP requires a full routing update\
    \ to be stored by the\n      receiver, before applying changes to the routing\
    \ database.\n      A Triggered RIP receiver is able to apply all changes immediately\n\
    \      upon receiving each packet from its partner.  Systems therefore\n     \
    \ need to use less memory than Demand RIP.\n   o  Demand RIP has an upper limit\
    \ of 255 fragments in an update.  This\n      sets an upper limit on the sizes\
    \ of routing and service\n      advertising databases which can be propagated.\n\
    \      This restriction is lifted in Triggered RIP (which does not use\n     \
    \ fragmentation).\n   In all other respects Demand RIP and Triggered RIP perform\
    \ the same\n   function.\n"
- title: 5. Obsoleting Demand RIP
  contents:
  - "5. Obsoleting Demand RIP\n   While it is possible that systems could be able\
    \ to support Demand RIP\n   and Triggered RIP, the internal maintenance of structures\
    \ is likely\n   to differ significantly.  The method of propagating the information\n\
    \   also differs significantly.  In practice it is unlikely that systems\n   would\
    \ support Demand RIP and Triggered RIP.\n   As a result of the improved characteristics\
    \ of Triggered RIP, it is\n   proposed that Demand RIP [5] be obsoleted.\n"
- title: 6. Implementations
  contents:
  - "6. Implementations\n   At this stage there are believed to be two completed implementation.\n\
    \   The Xyplex implementation supports all the features outlined for IP\n   RIP-1,\
    \ IP RIP-2, IPX RIP, and IPX SAP.  However, it only supports one\n   outstanding\
    \ acknowledgement per partner.  The implementation has been\n   tested against\
    \ itself on X.25, ISDN, Frame Relay, V42bis CSU/DSUs,\n   and asynchronous modems.\
    \  It has also been tested in operation with\n   various router and host implementations\
    \ on Ethernet LANs.\n   The DEC implementation supports IP RIP-1 over ISDN, Frame\
    \ Relay,\n   leased lines and V.25bis.  The Xyplex and DEC IP RIP-1\n   implementations\
    \ have been checked for interoperability over ISDN\n   without problems.\n"
- title: 7. Restrictions
  contents:
  - "7. Restrictions\n   Demand RIP relies on the ability to place a call in either\
    \ direction.\n   Some dialup services - for example DTR dialing - allow calls\
    \ to be\n   made in one direction only.\n   Demand RIP can not operate with third-party\
    \ advertisement of routes\n   on the WAN.  The next hop IP address in RIP-2 should\
    \ always be\n   0.0.0.0 for any routes advertised on the WAN.\n"
- title: 8. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8. Security Considerations\n   Security is provided through authentication of\
    \ the logical and\n   physical address of the sender of the routing update.  Incoming\
    \ call\n   requests are matched by the circuit manager against a list of\n   physical\
    \ addresses (used to make outgoing calls).  The routing\n   application makes\
    \ a further check against the logical address of an\n   incoming update.\n   Additional\
    \ security can be provided by RIP-2 authentication [2] where\n   appropriate.\n"
