    \   which has been produced by the North American Directory Forum (NADF).\n  \
    \                          User Bill of Rights\n                         for entries\
    \ and listings\n                          in the Public Directory\n   The mission\
    \ of the North American Directory Forum is to provide\n   interconnected electronic\
    \ directories which empower users with\n   unprecedented access to public information.\
    \  To address significant\n   security and privacy issues, the North American\
    \ Directory Forum\n   introduces the following \"User Bill of Rights\" for entries\
    \ in the\n   Public Directory.  As a user, you have:\n        I. The right not\
    \ to be listed.\n       II. The right to have you or your agent informed when\n\
    \           your entry is created.\n      III. The right to examine your entry.\n\
    \       IV. The right to correct inaccurate information in your\n           entry.\n\
    \        V. The right to remove specific information from your\n           entry.\n\
    \       VI. The right to be assured that your listing in the\n           Public\
    \ Directory will comply with US or Canadian law\n           regulating privacy\
    \ or access information.\n      VII. The right to expect timely fulfillment of\
    \ these rights.\n"
- title: Scope of Intent - User Bill of Rights
  contents:
  - "Scope of Intent - User Bill of Rights\n   The North American Directory Forum\
    \ is a collection of service\n   providers that plan to offer a cooperative directory\
    \ service in North\n   America.  This is achieved by interconnecting electronic\
    \ directories\n   using a set of internationally developed standards known as\
    \ the CCITT\n   X.500 series.\n   In this context, the \"Directory\" represents\
    \ the collection of\n   electronic directories administered by both service providers\
    \ and\n   private operators.  When an entry containing information about a user\n\
    \   is listed in the Directory, that information can be accessed unless\n   restricted\
    \ by security and privacy controls.\n   A portion of the Directory -- The Public\
    \ Directory -- contains\n   information for public dissemination.  In contrast,\
    \ other portions of\n   the Directory may contain information not intended for\
    \ public access.\n   A user or user's agent may elect to list information in the\
    \ Public\n   Directory, a private directory, or some combination.  For example,\
    \ a\n   user might publicly list a telephone number or an electronic mail\n  \
    \ address, and might designate other information for specific private\n   use.\n\
    \   The User Bill of Rights pertains to the Public Directory.\n"
