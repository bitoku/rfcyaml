- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IS-IS protocol is specified in ISO 10589 [1], with extensions\
    \ for\n   supporting IPv4 specified in RFC 1195 [3].  Each Intermediate System\n\
    \   (IS) (router) advertises one or more IS-IS Link State Protocol Data\n   Units\
    \ (LSPs) with routing information.  Each LSP is composed of a\n   fixed header\
    \ and a number of tuples, each consisting of a Type, a\n   Length, and a Value.\
    \  Such tuples are commonly known as TLVs, and are\n   a good way of encoding\
    \ information in a flexible and extensible\n   format.\n   This document contains\
    \ the design of new TLVs to replace the existing\n   IS Neighbor TLV, IP Reachability\
    \ TLV, and to include additional\n   information about the characteristics of\
    \ a particular link to an IS-\n   IS LSP.  The characteristics described in this\
    \ document are needed\n   for Traffic Engineering [4] (TE).  Secondary goals include\
    \ increasing\n   the dynamic range of the IS-IS metric and improving the encoding\
    \ of\n   IP prefixes.\n   The router id is useful for traffic engineering purposes\
    \ because it\n   describes a single address that can always be used to reference\
    \ a\n   particular router.\n   Mechanisms and procedures to migrate to the new\
    \ TLVs are not\n   discussed in this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Introducing Sub-TLVs
  contents:
  - "2.  Introducing Sub-TLVs\n   This document introduces a new way to encode routing\
    \ information in\n   IS-IS.  The new object is called a sub-TLV.  Sub-TLVs are\
    \ similar to\n   regular TLVs.  They use the same concepts as regular TLVs.  The\n\
    \   difference is that TLVs exist inside IS-IS packets, while sub-TLVs\n   exist\
    \ inside TLVs.  TLVs are used to add extra information to IS-IS\n   packets. \
    \ Sub-TLVs are used to add extra information to particular\n   TLVs.  Each sub-TLV\
    \ consists of three fields, a one-octet Type field,\n   a one-octet Length field,\
    \ and zero or more octets of Value.  The Type\n   field indicates the type of\
    \ items in the Value field.  The Length\n   field indicates the length of the\
    \ Value field in octets.  Each sub-\n   TLV can potentially hold multiple items.\
    \  The number of items in a\n   sub-TLV can be computed from the length of the\
    \ whole sub-TLV, when\n   the length of each item is known.  Unknown sub-TLVs\
    \ are to be ignored\n   and skipped upon receipt.\n   The Sub-TLV type space is\
    \ managed by the IETF IS-IS WG\n   (http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/isis-charter.html).\
    \  New type\n   values are allocated following review on the IETF IS-IS mailing\
    \ list.\n   This will normally require publication of additional documentation\n\
    \   describing how the new type is used.  In the event that the IS-IS\n   working\
    \ group has disbanded the review shall be performed by a\n   Designated Expert\
    \ assigned by the responsible Area Director.\n"
- title: 3.  The Extended IS Reachability TLV
  contents:
  - "3.  The Extended IS Reachability TLV\n   The extended IS reachability TLV is\
    \ TLV type 22.\n   The existing IS reachability (TLV type 2, defined in ISO 10589\
    \ [1])\n   contains information about a series of IS neighbors.  For each\n  \
    \ neighbor, there is a structure that contains the default metric, the\n   delay,\
    \ the monetary cost, the reliability, and the 7-octet ID of the\n   adjacent neighbor.\
    \  Of this information, the default metric is\n   commonly used.  The default\
    \ metric is currently one octet, with one\n   bit used to indicate whether the\
    \ metric is internal or external, and\n   one bit that was originally unused,\
    \ but which was later defined by\n   RFC 2966 to be the up/down bit.  The remaining\
    \ 6 bits are used to\n   store the actual metric, resulting in a possible metric\
    \ range of 0-\n   63.  This limitation is one of the restrictions that we would\
    \ like to\n   lift.\n   The remaining three metrics (delay, monetary cost, and\
    \ reliability)\n   are not commonly implemented and reflect unused overhead in\
    \ the TLV.\n   The neighbor is identified by its system ID, typically 6-octets,\
    \ plus\n   one octet indicating the pseudonode number.  Thus, the existing TLV\n\
    \   consumes 11 octets per neighbor, with 4 octets for metric and 7\n   octets\
    \ for neighbor identification.  To indicate multiple\n   adjacencies, this structure\
    \ is repeated within the IS reachability\n   TLV.  Because the TLV is limited\
    \ to 255 octets of content, a single\n   TLV can describe up to 23 neighbors.\
    \  The IS reachability TLV can be\n   repeated within the LSP fragments to describe\
    \ further neighbors.\n   The proposed extended IS reachability TLV contains a\
    \ new data\n   structure, consisting of:\n      7 octets of system Id and pseudonode\
    \ number\n      3 octets of default metric\n      1 octet of length of sub-TLVs\n\
    \      0-244 octets of sub-TLVs,\n           where each sub-TLV consists of a\
    \ sequence of\n                1 octet of sub-type\n                1 octet of\
    \ length of the value field of the sub-TLV\n                0-242 octets of value\n\
    \   Thus, if no sub-TLVs are used, the new encoding requires 11 octets\n   and\
    \ can contain up to 23 neighbors.  Please note that while the\n   encoding allows\
    \ for 255 octets of sub-TLVs, the maximum value cannot\n   fit in the overall\
    \ IS reachability TLV.  The practical maximum is 255\n   octets minus the 11 octets\
    \ described above, or 244 octets.  Further,\n   there is no defined mechanism\
    \ for extending the sub-TLV space for a\n   particular neighbor.  Thus, wasting\
    \ sub-TLV space is discouraged.\n   The metric octets are encoded as a 24-bit\
    \ unsigned integer.  Note\n   that the metric field in the new extended IP reachability\
    \ TLV is\n   encoded as a 32-bit unsigned integer.  These different sizes were\n\
    \   chosen so that it is very unlikely that the cost of an intra-area\n   route\
    \ has to be chopped off to fit in the metric field of an inter-\n   area route.\n\
    \   To preclude overflow within a traffic engineering SPF implementation,\n  \
    \ all metrics greater than or equal to MAX_PATH_METRIC SHALL be\n   considered\
    \ to have a metric of MAX_PATH_METRIC.  It is easiest to\n   select MAX_PATH_METRIC\
    \ such that MAX_PATH_METRIC plus a single link\n   metric does not overflow the\
    \ number of bits for internal metric\n   calculation.  We assume that this is\
    \ 32 bits.  Therefore, we have\n   chosen MAX_PATH_METRIC to be 4,261,412,864\
    \ (0xFE000000, 2^32 - 2^25).\n   If a link is advertised with the maximum link\
    \ metric (2^24 - 1), this\n   link MUST NOT be considered during the normal SPF\
    \ computation.  This\n   will allow advertisement of a link for purposes other\
    \ than building\n   the normal Shortest Path Tree.  An example is a link that\
    \ is\n   available for traffic engineering, but not for hop-by-hop routing.\n\

- title: 4.  The Extended IP Reachability TLV
  contents:
  - "4.  The Extended IP Reachability TLV\n   The extended IP reachability TLV is\
    \ TLV type 135.\n   The existing IP reachability TLVs (TLV type 128 and TLV type\
    \ 130,\n   defined in RFC 1195 [3]) carry IP prefixes in a format that is\n  \
    \ analogous to the IS neighbor TLV from ISO 10589 [1].  They carry four\n   metrics,\
    \ of which only the default metric is commonly used.  The\n   default metric has\
    \ a possible range of 0-63.  We would like to remove\n   this restriction.\n \
    \  In addition, route redistribution (a.k.a. route leaking) has a key\n   problem\
    \ that was not fully addressed by the existing IP reachability\n   TLVs.  RFC\
    \ 1195 [3] allows a router to advertise prefixes upwards in\n   the level hierarchy.\
    \  Unfortunately there were no mechanisms defined\n   to advertise prefixes downwards\
    \ in the level hierarchy.\n   To address these two issues, the proposed extended\
    \ IP reachability\n   TLV provides for a 32 bit metric and adds one bit to indicate\

  contents:
  - "4.1.  The up/down Bit\n   If routers were allowed to redistribute IP prefixes\
    \ freely in both\n   directions between level 1 and level 2 without any additional\n\
    \   mechanisms, those routers would not be able to determine looping of\n   routing\
    \ information.  A problem occurs when a router learns a prefix\n   via level 2\
    \ routing and advertises that prefix down into a level 1\n   area, where another\
    \ router might pick up the route and advertise the\n   prefix back up into the\
    \ level 2 backbone.  If the original source\n   withdraws the prefix, those two\
    \ routers might end up having a routing\n   loop between them, where part of the\
    \ looped path is via level 1\n   routing and the other part of the looped path\
    \ is via level 2 routing.\n   The solution that RFC 1195 [3] poses is to allow\
    \ only advertising\n   prefixes upward in the level hierarchy, and to disallow\
    \ the\n   advertising of prefixes downward in the hierarchy.\n   To prevent this\
    \ looping of prefixes between levels, a new bit of\n   information is defined\
    \ in the new extended IP reachability TLV.  This\n   bit is called the up/down\
    \ bit.  The up/down bit SHALL be set to 0\n   when a prefix is first injected\
    \ into IS-IS.  If a prefix is\n   advertised from a higher level to a lower level\
    \ (e.g. level 2 to\n   level 1), the bit MUST be set to 1, indicating that the\
    \ prefix has\n   traveled down the hierarchy.  Prefixes that have the up/down\
    \ bit set\n   to 1 may only be advertised down the hierarchy, i.e. to lower levels.\n\
    \   These semantics apply even if IS-IS is extended in the future to have\n  \
    \ additional levels.  By insuring that prefixes follow only the IS-IS\n   hierarchy,\
    \ we have insured that the information does not loop,\n   thereby insuring that\
    \ there are no persistent forwarding loops.\n   If a prefix is advertised from\
    \ one area to another at the same level,\n   then the up/down bit SHALL be set\
    \ to 1.  This situation can arise\n   when a router implements multiple virtual\
    \ routers at the same level,\n   but in different areas.\n   The semantics of\
    \ the up/down bit in the new extended IP reachability\n   TLV are identical to\
    \ the semantics of the up/down bit defined in RFC\n   2966 [2].\n"
