  - "1.  Introduction\n   In order to support new protocols and practices, the IETF\n\
    \   occasionally reserves an address block for a special purpose.  For\n   example,\
    \ [RFC1122] reserves an IPv4 address block (0.0.0.0/8) to\n   represent the local\
    \ (i.e., \"this\") network.  Likewise, [RFC4291]\n   reserves an IPv6 address\
    \ block (fe80::/10) for link-local unicast\n   addresses.\n   Several issues have\
    \ been raised with the documentation of some of the\n   special-purpose address\
    \ blocks in [RFC6890].  Specifically, the\n   definition of \"global\" provided\
    \ in [RFC6890] was misleading as it\n   slightly differed from the generally accepted\
    \ definition of \"global\n   scope\" (i.e., the ability to forward beyond the\
    \ boundaries of an\n   administrative domain, described as \"global unicast\"\
    \ in the IPv6\n   addressing architecture [RFC4291]).\n   This memo updates the\
    \ definition of \"global\" from [RFC6890] for the\n   IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose\
    \ Address Registries, augments the fields\n   contained within the registries\
    \ in order to address the confusion\n   raised by the definition of \"global\"\
    , and corrects some errors in\n   some of the entries in the Special-Purpose Address\
    \ Registries.\n   This memo updates [RFC6890].\n"

- title: 2.1.  Definition of Globally Reachable
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Definition of Globally Reachable\n   [RFC6890] defined the term \"global\"\
    \ without taking into consideration\n   the multiple uses of the term.  Specifically,\
    \ IP addresses can be\n   global in terms of allocation scope as well as global\
    \ in terms of\n   routing/reachability.  To address this ambiguity, the use of\
    \ the term\n   \"global\" defined in [RFC6890] is replaced with \"globally reachable\"\
    .\n   The following definition replaces the definition of \"global\" in the\n\
    \   IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries:\n   o  Globally Reachable - A boolean\
    \ value indicating whether an IP\n      datagram whose destination address is\
    \ drawn from the allocated\n      special-purpose address block is forwardable\
    \ beyond a specified\n      administrative domain.\n   The same relationship between\
    \ the value of \"Destination\" and the\n   values of \"Forwardable\" and \"Global\"\
    \ described in [RFC6890] holds for\n   \"Globally Reachable\".  If the value of\
    \ \"Destination\" is FALSE, the\n   values of \"Forwardable\" and \"Globally Reachable\"\
    \ must also be FALSE.\n   The \"Global\" columns in the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address\
    \ Registry\n   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry) and\
    \ the\n   IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry\n   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry)\
    \ have\n   been renamed to \"Globally Reachable\".\n"
- title: 2.2.  Updates to the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Updates to the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry\n   o  Limited Broadcast\
    \ prefix (255.255.255.255/32) - The Reserved-by-\n      Protocol value has changed\
    \ from False to True.  This change was\n      made to align the registry with\
    \ reservation of the limited\n      broadcast address with Section 7 of [RFC919].\n"
- title: 2.3.  Updates to the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Updates to the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry\n   The following\
    \ changes to the \"IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry\"\n   involved the insertion\
    \ of two new footnotes.  These additions\n   required that the footnotes be renumbered.\n\
    \   o  TEREDO prefix (2001::/32) - The Globally Reachable value has\n      changed\
    \ from False to \"N/A [2]\".  The [2] footnote now states:\n      *  See Section\
    \ 5 of [RFC4380] for details.\n   o  EID Space for LISP (2001:5::/32) - All footnotes\
    \ have been\n      incremented by 1.\n   o  6to4 (2002::/16) - All footnotes have\
    \ been incremented by 1.\n   o  Unique-Local (fc00::/7) - The Globally Reachable\
    \ value has changed\n      from False to \"False [7]\".  The [7] footnote now\
    \ states:\n      *  See [RFC4193] for more details on the routability of Unique-\n\
    \         Local addresses.  The Unique-Local prefix is drawn from the\n      \
    \   IPv6 Global Unicast Address range but is specified as not\n         globally\
    \ routed.\n"
