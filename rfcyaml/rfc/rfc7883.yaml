  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC7880] defines a simplified mechanism for using Bidirectional\n
    \  Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880].  This mechanism depends on\n   network
    nodes knowing the BFD Discriminators that each node in the\n   network has reserved
    for this purpose.  The use of the Intermediate\n   System to Intermediate System
    (IS-IS) [IS-IS] protocol is one\n   possible means of advertising these discriminators.\n
    \  The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n
    \  \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n
    \  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Encoding Format\n   The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV as defined in [RFC4971]
    will be used\n   to advertise Seamless BFD (S-BFD) Discriminators.  A new sub-TLV
    is\n   defined as described below.  S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLVs are\n   formatted
    as specified in [RFC5305].\n                                                  No.
    of octets\n                 +-----------------------------+\n                 |
    Type (20)                   |     1\n                 +-----------------------------+\n
    \                | Length (multiple of 4)      |     1\n                 +-----------------------------+\n
    \                | Discriminator Value(s)      |     4/Discriminator\n                 :
    \                            :\n                 +-----------------------------+\n
    \  The inclusion of an S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLV in a Router\n   CAPABILITY
    TLV is optional.  Multiple S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLVs\n   MAY be advertised
    by an IS.  How a given discriminator is mapped to a\n   specific use case when
    multiple S-BFD Discriminators are advertised\n   is out of scope for this document.\n
    \  S-BFD Discriminator advertisements MAY be flooded within an area or\n   throughout
    the domain, using the procedures specified in [RFC4971].\n   The appropriate flooding
    scope depends on the intended use of S-BFD.\n   If S-BFD usage will be exclusively
    within a Level-1 area, then area\n   scope is appropriate.  If S-BFD usage will
    span different Level-1\n   areas, then domain scope is appropriate.\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has added a new sub-TLV in the \"Sub-TLVs for
    TLV 242\" registry.\n   The registration is as follows:\n      Value  Description\n
    \     -----  --------------------\n      20     S-BFD Discriminators\n"
  title: 3.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security concerns for IS-IS are addressed in
    [IS-IS], [RFC5304], and\n   [RFC5310].  The new S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLV does
    not introduce\n   any new security risks for IS-IS.\n   Advertising the S-BFD
    Discriminators makes it possible for attackers\n   to initiate S-BFD sessions
    using the advertised information.  The\n   vulnerabilities this poses and how
    to mitigate them are discussed in\n   [RFC7880].\n"
