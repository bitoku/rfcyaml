  - "1. Introduction\n   This document provides terminology for Frame Relay switching\
    \ devices.\n   It extends terminology already defined for benchmarking network\n\
    \   interconnect devices in RFCs 1242, 1944 and 2285.  Although some of\n   the\
    \ definitions in this memo may be applicable to a broader group of\n   network\
    \ interconnect devices, the primary focus of the terminology in\n   this memo\
    \ is on Frame Relay Signaling.\n   This memo contains two major sections: Background\
    \ and Definitions.\n   The background section provides the reader with an overview\
    \ of the\n   technology and IETF formalisms.  The definitions section is split\n\
    \   into two sub-sections.  The formal definitions sub-section is\n   provided\
    \ as a courtesy to the reader.  The measurement definitions\n   sub-section contains\
    \ performance metrics with inherent units.\n   The BMWG produces two major classes\
    \ of documents: Benchmarking\n   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology\
    \ documents.  The\n   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related\
    \ terms.\n   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect\n\
    \   the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.\n   For the\
    \ purposes of computing several of the metrics, certain textual\n   conventions\
    \ are required.  Specifically:\n   1) The notation sum {i=1 to N} A_i denotes:\
    \ the summation of N\n   instances of the observable A.  For example, the set\
    \ of observations\n   {1,2,3,4,5} would yield the result 15.\n   2) The notation\
    \ max {I=1 to N} A_i and min {I=1 to N} A_i denotes:\n   the maximum or minimum\
    \ of the observable A over N instances.  For\n   example, given the set of observations\
    \ {1,2,3,4,5}, max {i=1 to 5} =\n   5 and min {I=1 to 5} = 1.\n   The terms defined\
    \ in this memo will be used in addition to terms\n   defined in RFCs 1242, 1944\
    \ and 2285.  This memo is a product of the\n   Benchmarking Methodology Working\
    \ Group (BMWG) of the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force(IETF).\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.1. Access Channel\n   Definition: Access channel refers to the user access\
    \ channel across\n   which frame relay data travels.  Within a given DS-3, T1\
    \ or E1\n   physical line, a channel can be one of the following, depending of\n\
    \   how the line is configured.  Possible line configurations are:\n   A. Unchannelized:\
    \ The entire DS-3/T1/E1 line is considered a channel,\n   where:\n   The DS-3\
    \ line operates at speeds of 45 Mbps and is a single channel.\n   The T1 line\
    \ operates at speeds of 1.536 Mbps and is a single channel\n   consisting of 24\
    \ T1 time slots.  The E1 line operates at speeds of\n   1.984 Mbps and is a single\
    \ channel consisting of 30 DS0 time slots.\n   B. Channelized: The channel is\
    \ any one of N time slots within a given\n   line, where:\n   The T1 line consists\
    \ of any one or more channels.  Each channel is\n   any one of 24 time slots.\
    \  The T1 line operates at speeds in\n   multiples of 56/64 Kbps to 1.536 Mbps,\
    \ with aggregate speed not\n   exceeding 1.536 Mbps.  The E1 line consists of\
    \ one or more channels.\n   Each channel is any one of 31 time slots.  The E1\
    \ line operates at\n   speeds in multiples of 64 Kbps to 1.984 Mbps, with aggregate\
    \ speed\n   not exceeding 1.984 Mbps.\n   C. Fractional: The T1/E1 channel is\
    \ one of the following groupings of\n   consecutively or non-consecutively assigned\
    \ time slots:\n   N DS0 time slots (NX56/64Kbps where N = 1 to 24 DS0 time slots\
    \ per\n   FT1 channel).\n   N E1 time slots (NX64Kbps, where N = 1 to 30 DS0 time\
    \ slots per E1\n   channel).\n   Discussion: Access channels specify the physical\
    \ layer interface\n   speed of a DTE or DCE.  In the case of a DTE, this may not\
    \ correspond\n   to either the CIR or EIR.  Specifically, based on the service\

    \   Discussion: When a DTE receives frames with the BECN bit asserted, it\n  \
    \ should begin congestion avoidance procedures.  Since the BECN frames\n   are\
    \ traveling in the opposite direction as the congested traffic, the\n   DTE will\

    \ -- means of indicating\n   which frames may be dropped in the event of congestion.\
    \  However, DE\n   is not the only means of identifying which frames may be dropped.\n\
    \   There are at least three other cases that apply.\n   In the first case, network\
    \ devices may prioritize frame relay traffic\n   by non-DE means.  For example,\
    \ many service providers prioritize\n   traffic on a per-PVC basis.  In this instance,\
    \ any traffic from a\n   given DLCI (data link channel identifier) may be dropped\
    \ during\n   congestion, regardless of whether DE is set.\n   In the second case,\
    \ some implementations use upper-layer criteria,\n   such as IP addresses or TCP\
    \ or UDP port numbers, to prioritize\n   traffic within a single PVC.  In this\
    \ instance, the network device\n   may evaluate discard eligibility based on upper-layer\
    \ criteria rather\n   than the presence or absence of a DE bit.\n   In the third\
    \ case, the frame is discarded because of an error in the\n   frame.  Specifically,\
    \ frames that are too long or too short, frames\n   that are not a multiple of\
    \ 8 bits in length, frames with an invalid\n   or unrecognized DLCI, frames with\
    \ an abort sequence, frames with\n   improper flag delimitation, and frames that\
