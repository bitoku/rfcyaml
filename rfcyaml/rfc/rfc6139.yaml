  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet is continually required to support more users,\
    \ more\n   internetwork connections, and increasing complexity due to diverse\n\
    \   policy requirements.  This growth and change strains the\n   infrastructure\
    \ and demands new solutions.  Some of the complementary\n   approaches to transform\
    \ Internet technology are being pursued\n   concurrently within the IETF: translation\
    \ (including Network Address\n   Translation (NAT)), tunneling (map and encapsulate),\
    \ and native IPv6\n   [RFC2460] deployment.  Routing and Addressing in Networks\
    \ with Global\n   Enterprise Recursion (RANGER) [RFC5720] describes the architectural\n\
    \   elements of a \"map and encapsulate\" approach that also facilitates\n   the\
    \ other two approaches.  This document discusses RANGER operational\n   scenarios.\n\
    \   RANGER provides an architectural framework for scalable routing and\n   addressing.\
    \  It provides for scalability, provider independence,\n   mobility, multihoming,\
    \ and security for the next-generation Internet.\n   The RANGER architectural\
    \ principles are not new.  They can be traced\n   to the deliberations of the\
    \ ROAD group [RFC1380], and also to still\n   earlier works including NIMROD [RFC1753]\
    \ and the Catenet model for\n   internetworking [CATENET] [IEN48] [RFC2775]. \
    \ [RFC1955] captures the\n   high-level architectural aspects of the ROAD group\
    \ deliberations in a\n   \"New Scheme for Internet Routing and Addressing (ENCAPS)\
    \ for IPNG\".\n   The Internet has grown tremendously since these architectural\n\
    \   principles were first developed, and that evolution increases the\n   need\
    \ for these capabilities.  The Internet has become a critical\n   resource for\
    \ business, for government, and for individual users\n   throughout the developed\
    \ world.  RANGER carries forward these\n   historic architectural principles,\
    \ creating a ubiquitous enterprise\n   network structure that can represent collections\
    \ of network elements\n   ranging from the granularity of a singleton router all\
    \ the way up to\n   an entire Internet.  This enterprise network structure uses\
    \ border\n   routers that configure tunnel endpoints to connect potentially\n\
    \   recursively nested networks.  Each enterprise network may use\n   completely\
    \ independent internal Routing Locator (RLOC) address\n   spaces, supporting a\
    \ virtual overlay network connecting edge networks\n   and devices that are addressed\
    \ with globally unique Endpoint\n   Interface iDentifiers (EIDs).  The RANGER\
    \ virtual overlay can\n   transcend traditional administrative and organizational\
    \ boundaries.\n   In its purest form, this overlay network could therefore span\
    \ the\n   entire Internet and restore the end-to-end transparency envisioned in\n\
    \   [RFC2775].\n   The RANGER architecture drew early observations from the Intra-Site\n\
    \   Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) [RFC5214] [RFC5579] but\n  \
    \ now uses Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) [RFC5558], the Subnetwork\n   Encapsulation\
    \ and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) [RFC5320], and other\n   mechanisms including IPsec\
    \ [RFC4301] as its functional building\n   blocks.  This document describes use\
    \ cases and shows how the RANGER\n   mechanisms apply.  Complementary mechanisms\
    \ (e.g., DNS, DHCP, NAT,\n   etc.) are included to show how the various pieces\
    \ can work together.\n   It expands on the concepts introduced in \"IPv6 Enterprise\
    \ Network\n   Scenarios\" [RFC4057] and \"IPv6 Enterprise Network Analysis - IP\
    \ Layer\n   3 Focus\" [RFC4852], and shows how the enterprise network model\n\
    \   generalizes to a broad range of scenarios.  These use cases are\n   included\
    \ to provide examples, invite criticism and comment, and\n   explore the potential\
    \ for creating the next-generation Internet using\n   the RANGER architecture.\
    \  Familiarity with RANGER, VET, SEAL, and\n   ISATAP are assumed.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   Internet Topology Hierarchy\n      The Internet Protocol\
    \ (IP) natively supports a topology hierarchy\n      comprised of increasing aggregations\
    \ of networked elements.\n      Network interfaces of devices are grouped into\
    \ subnetworks, and\n      subnetworks are grouped into larger aggregations.  Subnetworks\
    \ can\n      be optionally grouped into areas and the areas grouped into an\n\
    \      autonomous system (AS).  Alternatively, subnetworks can be\n      directly\
    \ grouped into an AS.  The foundation of the IP Topology\n      Hierarchy is the\
    \ AS, which determines the administrative\n      boundaries of a network deployment\
    \ including its routing,\n      addressing, quality of service, security, and\
    \ management.\n      Intra-domain routing occurs within an autonomous system,\
    \ and\n      inter-domain routing links autonomous systems into a \"network of\n\
    \      networks\" (Internet).\n   Routing Locator (RLOC)\n      an address assigned\
    \ to an interface in an enterprise-interior\n      routing region.  Note that\
    \ RLOC space is local to each enterprise\n      network.\n      The IPv4 public\
    \ address space currently in use today can be\n      considered as the RLOC space\
    \ for the global Internet as a giant\n      \"enterprise network\".\n   Endpoint\
    \ Interface iDentifier (EID)\n      an address assigned to an edge network interface\
    \ of an end system.\n      Note that EID space is global in scope, and must be\
    \ separate and\n      distinct from any RLOC space.\n   commons\n      an enterprise-interior\
    \ routing region that provides a subnetwork\n      for cooperative peering between\
    \ the border routers of diverse\n      organizations that may have competing interests.\
    \  An example of a\n      commons is the Default-Free Zone (DFZ) of the global\
    \ Internet.\n      The enterprise-interior routing region within the commons uses\
    \ an\n      addressing plan taken from RLOC space.\n   enterprise network\n  \
    \    the same as defined in [RFC4852], where the enterprise network\n      deploys\
    \ a unified RLOC space addressing plan within the commons,\n      but may also\
    \ contain partitions with disjoint RLOC spaces and/or\n      organizational groupings\
    \ that can be considered as enterprises\n      unto themselves.  An enterprise\
    \ network therefore need not be \"one\n      big happy family\", but instead provides\
    \ a commons for the\n      cooperative interconnection of diverse organizations\
    \ that may have\n      competing interests (e.g., such as the case within the\
    \ global\n      Internet Default-Free Zone).\n      Historically, enterprise networks\
    \ are associated with large\n      corporations or academic campuses.  However,\
    \ in RANGER an\n      enterprise network may exist at any IP Topology Hierarchy\
    \ level.\n      The RANGER architectural principles apply to any networked entity\n\
    \      that has some degree of cooperative active management.  This\n      definition\
    \ therefore extends to home networks, small office\n      networks, a wide variety\
    \ of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), and\n      even to the global Internet itself.\n\
    \   site\n      a logical and/or physical grouping of interfaces within an\n \
    \     enterprise network commons, where the topology of the site is a\n      proper\
    \ subset of the topology of the enterprise network.  A site\n      may contain\
    \ many interior sites, which may themselves contain many\n      interior sites\
    \ in a recursive fashion.\n      Throughout the remainder of this document, the\
    \ term \"enterprise\"\n      refers to either enterprise or site; i.e., the RANGER\
    \ principles\n      apply equally to enterprises and sites of any size or shape.\
    \  At\n      the lowest level of recursive decomposition, a singleton\n      Enterprise\
    \ Border Router can be considered as an enterprise unto\n      itself.\n   Enterprise\
    \ Border Router (EBR)\n      a node at the edge of an enterprise network that\
    \ is also\n      configured as a tunnel endpoint in an overlay network.  EBRs\n\
    \      connect their directly attached networks to the overlay network,\n    \
    \  and connect to other networks via IP-in-IP tunneling across the\n      commons\
    \ to other EBRs.  This definition is intended as an\n      architectural equivalent\
    \ of the functional term \"EBR\" defined in\n      [RFC5558], and is synonymous\
    \ with the term \"xTR\" used in other\n      contexts (e.g., [LISP]).\n   Enterprise\
    \ Border Gateway (EBG)\n      an EBR that also connects the enterprise network\
    \ to provider\n      networks and/or to the global Internet.  EBGs are typically\n\
    \      configured as default routers in the overlay, and provide\n      forwarding\
    \ services for accessing IP networks not reachable via an\n      EBR within the\
    \ commons.  This definition is intended as an\n      architectural equivalent\
    \ of the functional term \"EBG\" defined in\n      [RFC5558], and is synonymous\
    \ with the term \"default mapper\" used\n      in other contexts (e.g., [APT]).\n\
    \   overlay network\n      a virtual network manifested by routing and addressing\
    \ over\n      virtual links formed through automatic tunneling.  An overlay\n\
    \      network may span many underlying enterprise networks.\n   6over4\n    \

    \ tunneling of unicast/multicast IPv6 packets over\n      multicast-capable IPv4\
    \ enterprise networks.\n   ISATAP\n      Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing\
    \ Protocol (ISATAP) [RFC5214]\n      [RFC5579]; functional specifications and\

    \      specifications and operational practices that provide a functional\n  \
    \    superset of 6over4 and ISATAP.  In addition to both unicast and\n      multicast\
    \ tunneling, VET also supports address/prefix\n      autoconfiguration as well\
    \ as additional encapsulations such as\n      IPsec, SEAL, UDP, etc.\n   SEAL\n\
    \      Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) [RFC5320]; a\n   \
    \   functional specification for robust packet identification and link\n     \
    \ MTU adaptation over tunnels.  SEAL supports effective ingress\n      filtering\
    \ and adapts to subnetworks configured over links with\n      diverse characteristics.\n\
    \      Within the RANGER architectural context, the SEAL \"subnetwork\" and\n\
    \      RANGER \"enterprise\" should be considered as identical\n      abstractions.\n\
    \   Provider-Independent (PI) prefix\n      an EID prefix (e.g., 2001:DB8::/48,\
    \ 192.0.2/24, etc.) that is\n      routable within a limited scope and may also\
    \ appear in enterprise\n      network mapping tables.  PI prefixes that can appear\
    \ in mapping\n      tables are typically delegated to a BR by a registry, but\
    \ are not\n      aggregated by a provider network.\n   Provider-Aggregated (PA)\
    \ prefix\n      an EID prefix that is either derived from a PI prefix or delegated\n\
    \      directly to a provider network by a registry.  Although not widely\n  \
    \    discussed, it bears specific mention that a prefix taken from a\n      delegating\
    \ router's PI space becomes a PA prefix from the\n      perspective of the requesting\
    \ router.\n   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) Router\n      a residential or\
    \ small office router that provides IPv4 and/or\n      IPv6 support.  The user\
    \ or the service provider may manage the\n      router.\n   Carrier-Grade NAT\
    \ (CGN)\n      a special (usually high capacity) IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT deployed within\n\
    \      the service provider network that serves multiple subnets.\n"

  - "3.  Approach\n   The RANGER [RFC5720] architecture seeks to fulfill the objectives\
    \ set\n   forth in [RFC1955]:\n   o  No Changes to Hosts\n   o  No Changes to\
    \ Most Routers\n   o  No New Routing Protocols\n   o  No New Internet Protocols\n\
    \   o  No Translation of Addresses in Packets\n   o  Reduce the Routing Table\
    \ Size in All Routers\n   o  Use the Current Internet Address Structure\n   The\
    \ RANGER enterprise network is a cooperative networked collective\n   sharing\
    \ a common (business, social, political, etc.) goal.  An\n   enterprise network\
    \ can be simple or complex in composition and can\n   operate at any IP Topology\
    \ Hierarchy level.  Although RANGER focuses\n   on encapsulation, it is also compatible\
    \ with both native and\n   translated routing and addressing.\n   RANGER enables\
    \ a protocol and/or addressing system to be connected in\n   a virtual overlay\
    \ across an untrusted transit network, or \"commons\".\n   While it does not show\
    \ all possible uses, Figure 1 illustrates that\n   RANGER supports the creation\

    \ Networks\n   The RANGER concepts can be applied recursively.  They can be\n\
    \   implemented at any level within the IP Topology Hierarchy to create\n   an\
    \ enterprise-within-enterprise organizational structure extending\n   traditional\
    \ AS, area, or subnetwork boundaries.  This structure uses\n   border routers\
    \ that configure tunnel endpoints to enable\n   communications between potentially\
    \ recursively nested enterprise\n   networks in a virtual overlay network that\
    \ transcends traditional\n   administrative and organizational boundaries.  In\
    \ its purest form,\n   this overlay network could therefore span the entire Internet\
    \ and\n   restore end-to-end transparency [RFC2775].\n   The RANGER architecture\
    \ applies the best current practice insights\n   from previous encapsulation systems\
    \ as they are currently articulated\n   within the Virtual Enterprise Traversal\
    \ [RFC5558], and Subnetwork\n   Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer [RFC5320] functional\n\
    \   specifications.  The result is an architecture and protocol system\n   that\
    \ can be used to create arbitrarily complex, scalable IP\n   deployments that\
    \ support both unicast and multicast routing and\n   addressing systems.\n   RANGER\
    \ supports scalable routing through a recursively nested\n   enterprise-within-enterprise\
    \ network capability.  The fundamental\n   building block is the Enterprise Border\
    \ Router (EBR) (see Figure 2).\n   The EBR is the limiting factor for RANGER recursion,\
    \ and in certain\n   contexts a singleton EBR can be viewed as an enterprise network\
    \ unto\n   itself.  Traditional network infrastructures can be extended to\n \
    \  support complex structures solely with the addition of EBRs with no\n   other\
    \ modification to any networked entity.\n   An EBR can be a commercial off-the-shelf\
    \ router, a tactical military\n   radio, an aircraft mobile router, etc., but\
    \ it can also be an end\n   system (e.g., a laptop computer, a soldiers' handheld\
    \ device, etc.)\n   with an embedded gateway function [RFC1122].\n           \

    \ and end systems to one or more enterprise\n   networks via a repertoire of interface\
    \ types.  Enterprise-interior\n   interfaces attach to a commons.  Provider-edge\
    \ interfaces support\n   traditional routing relationships up the IP Topology\
    \ Hierarchy, and\n   enterprise-edge interfaces support traditional relationships\
    \ down the\n   IP Topology Hierarchy.  Internal virtual interfaces are typically\n\
    \   loopback interfaces or VMware-like host-in-host interfaces.\n   VET interfaces\
    \ support RANGER recursion and IP-in-IP encapsulation.\n   VET interfaces are\
    \ configured over provider-edge, enterprise-\n   interior, or enterprise-edge\
    \ interfaces to allow recursion\n   horizontally or vertically within the IP Topology\
    \ Hierarchy.  A VET\n   interface may be configured over several underlying interfaces\
    \ that\n   all connect to the same enterprise network.  This creates a link-\n\
    \   layer multiplexing capability that can provide several advantages\n   (see\
    \ [RFC1122], Section 3.3.4).  One important advantage is\n   continuous operation\
    \ across failovers between multiple links attached\n   to the same enterprise\
    \ network, without any need for readdressing.\n   Figure 3 shows two enterprise\
    \ networks (each with their own internal\n   addressing and routing systems) that\
    \ communicate over a virtual\n   overlay network across a commons.  The virtual\
    \ overlay is manifested\n   by tunneling, which links enterprise networks separated\
    \ by\n   geographical remoteness, protocol incompatibility, or both.  An\n   ingress\
    \ EBR (iEBR) within the left enterprise network seeks to\n   forward encapsulated\
    \ packets across the commons to the egress EBR\n   (eEBR) within the right enterprise\
    \ network.\n   The figure shows that the eEBR assigns a Routing Locator (RLOC)\n\
    \   address on its interface to the commons' interior IP routing and\n   address\
    \ space, while the destination host assigns an Endpoint\n   Interface iDentifier\
    \ (EID) on its enterprise-edge interface.  The\n   iEBR uses a mapping system\
    \ to discover the RLOC of an eEBR on the\n   path to the destination EID address.\
    \  A distinct mapping system is\n   maintained within each recursively nested\

    \ and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)\n   [RFC4862] are used for this\
    \ purpose.\n   Similarly, EBRs require a means to discover other EBRs and EBGs\

    \   The mapping system is a distributed database that is synchronized\n   among\

    \ by many different protocol alternatives.  The most\n   commonly used alternatives\
    \ are either the Border Gateway Protocol\n   (BGP) [RFC4271] or the Domain Name\
    \ System (DNS) [RFC1035].  Mapping-\n   system databases can be populated by many\
    \ different mechanisms\n   including administrative configuration and automated\
    \ prefix\n   registrations.\n   EBRs forward initial packets for which they have\
    \ no mapping to an\n   EBG.  The EBG in turn forwards the packet toward the final\n\
    \   destination and returns a redirect to inform the EBR of a better next\n  \
    \ hop if necessary.  The EBR then receives a mapping reply that it can\n   use\
    \ to populate its Forwarding Information Base (FIB).  It then\n   encapsulates\
    \ each forwarded packet in an outer IP header for\n   transmission across the\
    \ commons to the remote RLOC address of an\n   eEBR.  The eEBR in turn decapsulates\
    \ the packets and forwards them to\n   the destination EID address.  The Routing\
    \ Information Base (RIB)\n   within the commons only needs to maintain state regarding\
    \ RLOCs and\n   not EIDs.  The synchronized EID-to-RLOC mapping state is not subject\n\
    \   to oscillations due to link state changes within the commons.  RANGER\n  \
    \ supports scalable addressing by selecting a suitably large EID\n   addressing\
    \ range that is distinct from any enterprise-interior RLOC\n   addressing ranges.\n"

    \ has created challenges in routing and\n   addressing that have been recognized\
    \ for many years\n   [RADIR-PROB-STATE].  IPv4 [RFC0791] address space is limited,\
    \ and\n   Regional Internet Registry (RIR) allocation is passing the \"very\n\
    \   painful\" Host Density (HD) ratio threshold of 86% (that is, 192M\n   allocated\
    \ addresses) [RFC3194].  As a result, exhaustion of the IPv4\n   address pool\
    \ is predicted within the next two years [IPv4POOL],\n   [HUSTON-END].  IPv6 promises\
    \ to resolve the address shortage with a\n   much larger address space, but transition\
    \ is costly and could\n   exacerbate BGP problems described below.  Richer interconnection,\n\
    \   increased multihoming (especially with provider-independent (PI)\n   addresses),\
    \ and a desire to support traffic engineering via finer\n   control of routing\
    \ has led to super-linear growth of BGP routing\n   tables in the Default-Free\

    \ Global IPv4 Internet ------------------>\n        Figure 5.  Enterprise Networks\
    \ within the Internet Commons\n   Figure 5 depicts enterprise networks E1 through\
    \ Em connected to the\n   global IPv4 Internet via Enterprise Border Routers (EBRs)\
    \ X1 through\n   X9.  These same border nodes also act as Enterprise Border Gateways\n\
    \   (EBGs) that provide default routing services for nodes within their\n   respective\
    \ enterprise networks.  The global Internet forms a commons\n   across which the\
    \ various enterprise networks connect as cooperating\n   yet potentially competing\
    \ entities.  Within each enterprise network\n   there may be arbitrarily many\
    \ hosts, routers, and networks (not shown\n   in the diagram) that use addresses\
    \ taken from that enterprise\n   network's RLOC space and over which both encapsulated\
    \ IP packets with\n   (global-scoped) EID addresses and unencapsulated IP packets\
    \ with\n   (enterprise-local) RLOC addresses can be forwarded.\n   Each enterprise\
    \ network may encompass lower-tier networks; for\n   instance, the singleton EBR\
    \ \"W\" in network E2 resides in a lower-tier\n   network (say E2.1), and (along\
    \ with any of its attached devices) may\n   be considered as an enterprise unto\
    \ itself.  W sees Y3 and Y4 as\n   EBGs, which in turn see X5 and X6 as EBGs that\
    \ connect to a common\n   provider network (in this case, the Internet).  Each\
    \ enterprise\n   network has one or more Endpoint Interface iDentifier (EID) address\n\
    \   prefixes used for addressing nodes on edge networks.  RANGER's map-\n   and-encaps\
    \ approach separates the mapping of EIDs to Routing Locators\n   (RLOCs) from\
    \ the Routing Information Base (RIB) in the Internet\n   commons that are assigned\
    \ to EBR router interfaces.  Not only does\n   BGP in the Internet commons only\
    \ need to maintain state regarding\n   RLOCs in the Internet commons, it has fewer\
    \ unique routes to maintain\n   because only routes to EBRs are needed; traffic\
    \ engineering can\n   therefore be accommodated via the mapping database.\n  \
    \ In Figure 5, enterprise network E2 represents a corporation that has\n   multiple\
    \ locations and connections to multiple ISPs.  The corporation\n   has recently\
    \ merged with another corporation so that its internal\n   network has two disjoint\
    \ RLOC address spaces, but neither of the\n   formerly separate entities can bear\
    \ the burden of address\n   renumbering.  Enterprise network E2 can use a suitably\
    \ large IPv4\n   and/or IPv6 EID addressing range (that is distinct from any\n\
    \   enterprise-interior RLOC addressing range) to support end systems on\n   enterprise-edge\
    \ networks with no disruption to preexisting address\n   numbering.\n   As EBRs\
    \ are deployed to connect enterprise networks together,\n   ordinary routers within\
    \ the enterprise network continue to function\n   as normal and deliver both ordinary\
    \ and encapsulated packets across\n   the existing Internet infrastructure and\
    \ the network's own RLOC\n   commons.  Legacy IPv4 services that bind to RLOC\
    \ addresses continue\n   to be supported even as EID-based services are rolled\
    \ out.  Where a\n   legacy IP client and server are within the same RLOC address\
    \ space,\n   they simply communicate by using RLOC-based routing across the\n\
    \   enterprise network commons.  If the client and server are not within\n   the\
    \ same RLOC address space, they communicate through some form of\n   network address\
    \ and/or protocol translation (see [RFC5720],\n   Section 3.3.4 for details).\
    \  EBRs from the various enterprise\n   networks publish their EID prefixes to\
    \ an enterprise-specific mapping\n   system, so that other EBRs from the various\
    \ enterprise networks can\n   consult the mapping system to receive the RLOC address\
    \ of one or more\n   EBRs that serve the EID prefix.\n   As an example, when an\
    \ end system connected to W in E2.1 has a packet\n   to send to node Z in enterprise\
    \ network E3, W sends the packet to EBR\n   Y4, which encapsulates the packet\
    \ in an outer IP packet with its own\n   source address and the RLOC address of\
    \ the next-hop EBR as the\n   destination -- in this case, X6.  X6 decapsulates\
    \ the packet and\n   looks up the destination EID prefix, obtaining the RLOC of\
    \ X7 as\n   next-hop.  X6 then encapsulates the IPv6 packet in a packet with RLOC\n\
    \   address X6 as the source and X7 as the destination.  X7 decapsulates\n   the\
    \ packet on receipt and forwards it via its enterprise-edge\n   interface to node\
    \ Z.\n   This example uses one thread out of many that are possible using\n  \
    \ RANGER; see [RFC5720] and [RFC5558] for other options and details.\n   Many\
    \ enterprise networks that use proxies and firewalls at their\n   border routers\
    \ today will wish to maintain that control over their\n   enterprise borders,\
    \ and the use of RANGER does not preclude such\n   configurations (for example,\
    \ see Section 4.3).\n"

  - "4.3.  Small Enterprise Concerns\n   Global enterprise networks operating at the\
    \ autonomous system level\n   of the IP Topology Hierarchy include multiple geographical\
    \ regions,\n   multiple ISPs, and complex internal structures that naturally benefit\n\
    \   from the application of RANGER techniques.  However, all other\n   enterprise\
    \ network instances (both large and small) can also be\n   served by RANGER. \
    \ For example, Small and Home Office (SOHO) networks\n   may comprise only a few\
    \ computers on a single network segment or may\n   extend to larger configurations\
    \ with security islands, internal\n   routers and switches, etc.\n   An important\
    \ concern of the small enterprise network is the ability\n   to grow the network,\
    \ change ISPs, or expand to more locations without\n   readdressing the existing\
    \ network.  Consider a small company that has\n   a single location in California.\
    \  The ISP connection is via a router\n   that acts as a Network Address Translator\
    \ and firewall for the\n   company.  Addresses of the few computers (\"Wksta\"\
    ) are taken from the\n   [RFC1918] private address space.\n                  \

  - "4.4.  IPv4/IPv6 Transition and Coexistence\n   End systems and networks need\
    \ to accommodate long-term support for\n   both IPv4 and IPv6.  Requirements for\
    \ transition include support for\n   IPv4 applications running over IPv4 protocol\
    \ stacks, IPv4\n   applications over IPv6 stacks, IPv4 applications over dual\
    \ stacks,\n   and IPv6 or IPv4/IPv6-capable applications over both IPv6 and dual\n\
    \   stacks.  Both encapsulation and translation will likely be needed to\n   allow\
    \ applications, enterprises, and providers to incorporate IPv6,\n   including\
    \ all intermediate states, without global coordination or a\n   \"flag day\".\n\
    \   The RANGER architecture facilitates the addition of IPv6 addressing\n   to\
    \ existing IPv4 end systems and routers (i.e., via dual stack) as\n   well as\
    \ the addition of IPv6 networks to the existing set of IPv4\n   networks.  RANGER\
    \ (with VET and SEAL) makes it possible to carry\n   packets originated in one\
    \ protocol across a network infrastructure\n   supporting another protocol or\
    \ routing system.  Figure 1 shows how\n   RANGER supports various combinations\
    \ of edge (EID) and core (RLOC\n   commons) technologies, going beyond IP version\
    \ differences to include\n   mixed security, management, and addressing as well.\n\
    \   The RANGER architecture supports end-to-end communications across\n   arbitrarily\
    \ long paths of concatenated enterprise networks connected\n   by EBRs.  When\
    \ IPv6 is used as Endpoint Interface iDentifier (EID)\n   space, each EBR can\
    \ provision a globally unique set of IPv6 EID\n   prefixes without scaling limitations,\
    \ due to the expanded IPv6\n   address space.  For example, Figure 9 shows a pair\
    \ of end systems,\n   \"H\" and \"J\", separated by an intervening set of enterprise\
    \ networks\n   spanned by VET interfaces labeled \"vet1\" through \"vet4\", where\
    \ the\n   path between \"H\" and \"J\" traverses the EBR path \"V->Y1->X2->X7->Z\"\

    \ networks include requirements for nomadic networks, local\n   mobility, and\
    \ global mobility where the connection point between\n   airplane and ground station\
    \ can move from one continent to another.\n   Mobile networks need to be able\

    \ not be\n   unduly disrupted by mobility, so movement of mobile nodes or edge\n\
    \   networks should not cause large ripples of routing protocol traffic,\n   especially\
    \ in the DFZ.\n   When a RANGER enterprise network is overlaid on the Internet,\

  - "4.5.2.  First-Responder Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)\n   Many emerging network\
    \ scenarios require autoconfiguration of Mobile\n   Ad hoc Networks (MANETs).\
    \  Where first responders need networking for\n   communications and coordination\
    \ between teams, RANGER allows each\n   team or agency to quickly stand up a network\
    \ and then use the\n   autoconfiguration described in [RFC5558] to coordinate\
    \ address/prefix\n   autoconfiguration and discover border routers needed for\
    \ teams and\n   agencies to interconnect.\n   For example, Figure 13 shows how\
    \ police units arriving on a scene\n   with no network infrastructure can create\
    \ a wireless network using\n   vehicle-mounted 802.11 hotspots with one or more\
    \ cellular, 802.16, or\n   satellite links in order to reach the Internet.  In\
    \ this example, the\n   California Highway Patrol sets up an incident management\
    \ center with\n   a satellite link to the Internet and vet1 serving network L1.\
    \  The\n   Los Angeles County Sheriff team sets up network L1.1 at their field\n\
    \   headquarters, and the Altadena police force creates the L1.2 network\n   with\
    \ their mobile units.  R2 is the router that serves as an EBG for\n   border routers\
    \ X3 and X4, which connect networks L1.2 and L1.1,\n   respectively.  X3 serves\
    \ vet3, and X4 serves vet2.\n   In like manner, the Angeles National Forest creates\
    \ enterprise\n   network F1, with the San Gabriel Ranger District setting up\n\
    \   enterprise network F1.1 and the Fire Response Team Enterprise Network\n  \
    \ F1.2.  R1 and R2 discover one another and become peer EBRs across the\n   Internet\
    \ by means of manual configuration.  In network L1, individual\n   PI address\
    \ prefixes are announced from L1.2 and L1.1 to L1, and R2\n   advertises them\
    \ to the satellite ISP.  R1 receives a PA prefix from\n   its WiMAX provider and\

  contents:
  - "4.5.3.  Tactical Military MANETs\n   Military networks reflect well-defined policy\
    \ requirements that\n   differ in many ways from civilian networks.  The military's\n\
    \   information security requirements result in information being labeled\n  \
    \ into specific classifications.  The Bell-LaPadula model\n   [BELL-LaPADULA]\
    \ provides a mechanism to extend information security\n   policy into networked\
    \ environments.  This extension creates\n   communications security (COMSEC),\
    \ whose routing and addressing\n   elements are cleanly supported by RANGER concepts.\n\
    \   Figure 3 shows that RANGER supports creation of a VET interface\n   between\
    \ the enterprise-interior (network) interface of two Enterprise\n   Border Routers\
    \ (EBR) located within separate enterprise networks, A\n   and B.  When this concept\
    \ is applied to enterprise networks operating\n   above the subnetwork level of\
    \ the IP Topology Hierarchy, then this\n   VET interface uses IP-in-IP encapsulation.\
    \  This corresponds with a\n   popular COMSEC approach (IPsec -- [RFC4301]). \
    \ When this same RANGER\n   concept is applied to enterprise networks operating\
    \ at the subnetwork\n   level of the IP Topology Hierarchy, then this corresponds\
    \ to an older\n   form of COMSEC (Link Layer Encryption).  When the same RANGER\
    \ concept\n   is applied to enterprise networks being singleton EBR nodes (i.e.,\n\
    \   the interface level of the IP Topology Hierarchy), then this\n   corresponds\
    \ to a third military COMSEC alternative (Link Encryption).\n   The previous paragraph\
    \ shows the flexibility of the RANGER\n   architecture to describe COMSEC approaches\
    \ in terms of IP Topology\n   Hierarchy structured relationships.  The power of\
    \ the RANGER\n   architecture becomes apparent when one recognizes that each of\
    \ the\n   entities in Figure 3 may themselves be simple or complex network\n \
    \  structures operating at any specific level of the IP Topology\n   Hierarchy.\
    \  (Complex structures refer to architectures that have been\n   extended by RANGER\
    \ recursion.)  For example, the commons in the\n   figure may itself be an interface,\
    \ a subnetwork, an autonomous\n   system, or an Internet.  Enterprise networks\
    \ A and B can be a single\n   end system, a subnetwork, an autonomous system,\
    \ or an Internet.\n   Tactical military MANETs differ from traditional networks\
    \ in many\n   ways, the most obvious being the high mobility of tactical\n   deployments\
    \ and self-forming-network attributes of MANETs themselves.\n   Because each networked\
    \ tactical entity supports a radio/router, the\n   numbers of routers within military\
    \ MANETs can be orders of magnitude\n   more numerous (denser) than traditional\
    \ civilian networks.  This\n   means that even small deployments have comparatively\
    \ large router\n   populations when compared to non-MANET deployments.  Larger\
    \ router\n   populations directly create greater sensitivity to protocol\n   scalability\
    \ issues.  Router scalability issues are further\n   exacerbated because IP protocols\
    \ react unfavorably to signal\n   intermittence, which effectively dampens and\
    \ constrains router\n   scaling even when mitigation techniques are employed.\
    \  Signal\n   intermittence itself is a characteristic of mobility and the radio\n\
    \   signal propagation attributes of local deployment environments (e.g.,\n  \
    \ such issues as terrain, foliage, buildings, weather, distance, etc.).\n   War\
    \ fighting also encourages war fighters to locate into more\n   defensible terrain\
    \ features, many of which naturally reduce radio\n   signal propagation, further\
    \ increasing the probability of signal\n   intermittence.\n   RANGER recursion\
    \ enables MANETs that naturally encourage route\n   aggregation and scaling through\
    \ simple \"plug and play\" hierarchical\n   arrangements that parallel organizational\
    \ structures and do not\n   entail complex manual configurations.  For example,\
    \ a MANET\n   autonomous system may benefit from RANGER recursion by being\n \
    \  physically comprised of enterprise networks that are autonomous\n   systems\
    \ themselves.  This relationship can be recursively extended\n   vertically as\
    \ deep as required in order to create route aggregation\n   between entities having\
    \ common mission assignments at differing\n   levels of abstraction.  Since MANET\
    \ routing is an active research\n   topic, it is helpful to realize that these\
    \ structures may or may not\n   use routing protocols similar to their civilian\
    \ IP Topology Hierarchy\n   peers.  For example, because of the behavior of BGP\
    \ within highly\n   mobile environments, the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) used\
    \ to link\n   ASs may or may not be BGP and, if it is BGP, it may have unusual\n\
    \   timer settings.  However, whatever IGP and EGP is used, RANGER\n   constructs\
    \ can increase route aggregation between entities sharing\n   common mission assignments\
    \ to enable route scaling.\n   Tactical military MANETs often have requirements\
    \ to communicate with\n   stationary infrastructures.  By localizing mobility\
    \ into an\n   enterprise network, the specific mobility-friendly protocols can\
    \ then\n   be localized and their aggregation results presented to the\n   stationary\
    \ network using a protocol supported by the stable network.\n   This also reduces\
    \ the impact of mobility upon routing and addressing\n   systems as reported to\
    \ the stationary infrastructure.  Mobility-\n   induced route fluctuations (e.g.,\
    \ routing flaps) can still occur, but\n   their impact can be dampened if RANGER\
    \ constructs are used to\n   localize them in lower tiers of the IP Topology Hierarchy.\
    \  For\n   example, enterprise network A in Figure 3 can be a military MANET,\n\
    \   and enterprise network B may be a stationary military entity.  Recall\n  \
    \ that enterprise networks A and B interface at a specific IP Topology\n   Hierarchy\
    \ level, but they may be physically extended by RANGER\n   mechanisms.  For example,\
    \ enterprise network A can be a MANET\n   enterprise that is physically a network-of-networks\
    \ Internet that\n   interfaces to enterprise network B as if it were an autonomous\n\
    \   system.  This gives enterprise network B a more stable and aggregated\n  \
    \ view of the enterprise network A Internet than would be the case if\n   it were\
    \ directly aware of A's various sub-enterprise components.\n   Another key distinctive\
    \ feature of tactical military networks is\n   that, because radio networks operate\
    \ at a different classification\n   level than the data they convey, tactical\
    \ military networks have\n   several orders of magnitude more COMSEC devices than\
    \ do equivalently\n   sized stationary military deployments (i.e., the number\
    \ of COMSEC\n   devices is a function of the number of mobile war-fighting entities).\n\
    \   This can create significant scalability issues within the overlay\n   COMSEC\
    \ network relationships themselves.  COMSEC scaling problems are\n   manifested\
    \ in several dimensions.  It is important to recognize,\n   however, that just\
    \ as RANGER recursion was used vertically to create\n   IP Topology enterprise-within-enterprise\
    \ structures in order to\n   improve routing aggregation and scaling, so RANGER\
    \ recursion allows\n   for authorization of route-optimized transactions between\
    \ peer\n   enterprises (within the same IP Topology Hierarchy level) to improve\n\
    \   COMSEC aggregation and scaling of the network overlay system.  The\n   RANGER\
    \ use of VET also combines with the Subnetwork Encapsulation and\n   Adaptation\
    \ Layer (SEAL) to provide robust packet identification and\n   maximum transmission\
    \ unit (MTU) link adaptation services over\n   tunnels.  These capabilities protect\
    \ against both source address\n   spoofing and black holes caused by MTU limitations.\n"

  - "4.6.3.  Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN)\n   The Aeronautical Telecommunications\
    \ Network (ATN) is currently based\n   on the OSI and IPv4 protocols and is deployed\
    \ only in limited areas.\n   The future ATN under consideration within the civil\
    \ aviation industry\n   will be IPv6-based.  The IP variant of ATN is expected\
    \ to take the\n   form of a worldwide enterprise network that internally comprises\
    \ an\n   aeronautical-only Internet that has additional external interfaces to\n\
    \   the global Internet.  Within the ATN, there may be many Air\n   Communications\
    \ Service Provider (ACSP) and Air Navigation Service\n   Provider (ANSP) networks\
    \ that are internally organized either as\n   autonomous systems or internets\

    \ illustrated in Figure 14.  The aero\n   overlay forms an enterprise network,\
    \ so that inner packets from ACSP\n   and ANSP edge networks that travel between\
    \ VET interfaces on EBRs see\n   their passage across the Internet as only one\

    \              Figure 14.  Aeronautical Overlay\n   Each Aeronautical Communications\
    \ Service Provider (ACSP), and\n   Aeronautical Navigation Service Provider (ANSP)\
    \ constitute an\n   enterprise network recursively nested below the aero overlay.\n\
    \   Relationships between the various enterprise networks can vary from\n   slight\
    \ to tight integration.  In the example, the ACSP and ANSP might\n   choose to\
    \ exchange full routing information for their edge networks\n   using a coordinated\
    \ global-scope RLOC address space across which ACSP\n   and ANSP EBRs can route\
    \ traffic without further mapping lookups or\n   re-encapsulation at intermediate\
    \ EBRs.  Other enterprise networks\n   that have the aero network as a common\
    \ parent may not have any\n   knowledge of each other's interior routing but will\
    \ merely forward\n   packets on a default route up to the aero overlay.\n   The\
    \ ATN is currently an OSI network but is projected to transition to\n   IPv6 over\
    \ time.  RANGER can bridge OSI networks together across the\n   IPv4 (or IPv6)\
    \ Internet, or bridge IPv4 or IPv6 networks across an\n   OSI network.  A pair\
    \ of EBRs that have IP interfaces on a common\n   enterprise network (whether\
    \ it is the Internet, the aero network, or\n   another parent or child enterprise\
    \ network) can support\n   communications between their attached OSI edge networks\
    \ by looking up\n   ISO network service access point (NSAP) addresses [IS8348]\
    \ instead of\n   IP addresses for RLOC mappings.  OSI ConnectionLess Network Protocol\n\
    \   (CLNP) [IS8473] packets can therefore be encapsulated within IPv4 (or\n  \
    \ IPv6) headers for transmission across an Internet Protocol enterprise\n   network.\
    \  Some OSI networks may transition to IPv6 addressing\n   [RFC4548] while applications\
    \ are adapted by using RFC 2126 [RFC2126]\n   to carry OSI upper layers over TCP/IP,\
    \ with the resulting IP packets\n   carried across and between RANGER enterprises\
    \ in the normal way.\n   Another approach is to use subnetwork convergence to\
    \ tunnel OSI\n   network protocol data units over Internet Protocol networks\n\
    \   [RFC1070].\n   Figure 15 depicts an ACSP and ANSP connected via an IPv4 aero\n\
    \   overlay.  Host H represents a system onboard an aircraft that has a\n   wireless\
    \ link to the ACSP, connected via an enterprise-edge network\n   interface on\
    \ EBR F within the ACSP enterprise network.  H resides on\n   an IPv6 edge network,\
    \ and its EID is taken from the ACSP IPv6 prefix.\n   H needs to send a query\
    \ to server S in the ANSP enterprise network.\n   H starts by sending a DNS query\
    \ to the server at G, and in return it\n   receives the EID of server S.  H then\
    \ creates an IPv6 packet with\n   source EID(H) and destination EID(S) and forwards\
    \ it to its default\n   router, F.  F consults G for a mapping from EID(S) to\
    \ the appropriate\n   RLOC.  In this case, EBR F encapsulates the IPv6 packet\
    \ in an IPv6\n   outer packet and forwards the packet to its default EBG, A. \
    \ A\n   decapsulates the packet and looks up the destination EID(S) by\n   querying\
    \ the DNS server at EBR B.  B returns a mapping with the RLOC\n   of EBR E.  A\
    \ encapsulates the IPv6 inner packet in an IPv4 outer\n   packet with source RLOC(A)\
    \ and destination RLOC(E).  The packet is\n   forwarded via EBRs C and D in the\
    \ aero overlay until it reaches E,\n   where it is decapsulated.  E consults its\
    \ cache of EID/RLOC mappings\n   and finds that the EBR for S is N.  E encapsulates\
    \ the packet in an\n   IPv6 packet with source RLOC(E) and destination RLOC(N).\
    \  When the\n   packet reaches N, it is decapsulated, and the inner IPv6 packet\
    \ is\n   forwarded on the edge network to the server, S.\n             _...--------------------------------------..._\n\

  - "4.6.4.  Unmanaged Networks\n   \"Evaluation of IPv6 Transition Mechanisms for\
    \ Unmanaged Networks\"\n   [RFC3904] considers four cases for support of IPv6-enabled\
    \ routers\n   and end systems connected to an ISP network via a gateway:\n   a.\
    \ a gateway that does not provide IPv6 at all;\n   b. a dual-stack gateway connected\
    \ to a dual-stack ISP;\n   c. a dual-stack gateway connected to an IPv4-only ISP;\
    \ and\n   d. a gateway connected to an IPv6-only ISP.\n   Case a is typified by\
    \ the widespread practice of customer networks\n   using IPv4-only NAT boxes to\
    \ connect to their service providers.\n   RANGER does not address this scenario\
    \ directly; however, the Teredo\n   mechanism [RFC4380] can provide a sufficient\
    \ solution in many cases.\n   Case d is a scenario that has not yet seen widespread\
    \ adoption.  In\n   this scenario, the customer network could be configured as\
    \ IPv6 only,\n   and the deployment could be considered as an IPv6-only extension\
    \ to a\n   RANGER enterprise-edge network.  End systems in this scenario would\n\
    \   still require support for legacy IPv4-only applications, and if the\n   customer\
    \ network contained IPv4-only routers and end systems the\n   RANGER encapsulation\
    \ mechanisms would still apply.\n   Cases b and c correspond to the scenario of\
    \ the customer gateway to\n   the ISP becoming an IPv6 router.  In that case,\
    \ the gateway could\n   become a RANGER EBR, and the scenario becomes the same\
    \ as the SOHO\n   network use cases discussed in Section 4.3.  In particular,\
    \ when\n   traditional home network IPv4 NAT boxes are updated to also support\n\
    \   IPv6 routing, the NAT box becomes a RANGER EBR.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Problem Statement and Call for Solutions\n   The scenarios discussed in this\
    \ document have not closely examined\n   future growth of the native IPv6 and\
    \ IPv4 Internets independently of\n   any growth in RANGER overlay networking.\
    \  For example, it is likely\n   that current-day major Internet services that\
    \ support millions of\n   customers simultaneously (e.g., Google, Yahoo, eBay,\
    \ Amazon, etc.)\n   will continue to be served best by native Internet routing\
    \ and\n   addressing rather than by overlay network arrangements that require\n\
    \   dynamic mapping state coordination.  At the same time, however, more\n   and\
    \ more small end user networks will wish to use provider-\n   independent addressing\
    \ for multihoming via multiple ISPs as well as\n   support traffic engineering\
    \ and mobility management.\n   These requirements call for an overlay network\
    \ solution that is\n   compatible with both RANGER and the IPv6 and IPv4 native\
    \ Internet\n   routing system without adversely affecting Internet routing scaling.\n\
    \   The solution must avoid the mapping and encapsulation concerns\n   discussed\
    \ in Section 3.7 of [RFC5720]; for example, it must provide\n   generally shortest\
    \ path routing without imparting unacceptable delays\n   for initial packets.\
    \  The solution must further provide mobility\n   management capabilities for\
    \ mobile end user networks that can take\n   advantage of route optimization while\
    \ requiring no modifications to\n   end systems.  Finally, the solution must be\
    \ based on a business model\n   that allows end user networks to obtain Internet\
    \ access services from\n   multiple ISPs simultaneously with support for traffic\
    \ engineering and\n   fault tolerance.\n"
- title: 7.  Summary
  contents:
  - "7.  Summary\n   The Internet today can be considered as a giant enterprise network,\n\
    \   with nodes in the Internet addressed from the public IPv4 address\n   space\
    \ as RLOCs.  Due to the 32-bit addressing limitations of IPv4,\n   however, continued\
    \ expansion has occurred through the widespread\n   deployment of IPv4 Network\
    \ Address Translators (NATs) while IPv6 has\n   yet to see wide adoption.\n  \
    \ In many senses, however, this has resulted in a degenerate\n   manifestation\
    \ of the network-of-networks model originally envisaged,\n   e.g., in the Catenet\
    \ model.  Indeed, these NATed domains have the\n   external appearance of being\
    \ a simple host within the global Internet\n   RLOC space even though they may\
    \ be proxying for arbitrarily large\n   networks of end systems.  The end result\
    \ is a loss of transparency in\n   the end-to-end model; it is no longer true\
    \ that any node in the\n   Internet can directly address any other node.\n   RANGER\
    \ enables a true network-within-network (or enterprise-within-\n   enterprise)\
    \ framework.  This is true even across a wide array of\n   deployment scenarios\
    \ as documented here, and even for networks-\n   within-networks that may be recursively\
    \ nested to an arbitrary depth.\n   RANGER therefore brings a unifying architecture\
    \ applied consistently\n   across all layers of recursion, rather than a mixed\
    \ bag of point\n   solutions that may or may not be mutually compatible.  When\
    \ coupled\n   with an overlay network solution that supports coexistence with\
    \ the\n   IPv6 and IPv4 native Internet routing systems, a unified future\n  \
    \ Internet architecture is possible.\n"
