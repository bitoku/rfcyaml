  - "the implementation schedule to which we hope to adhere.\n    - July 18, 1975\
    \ -- Done with the basic design.  A version of the TIP\n      which has a general\
    \ version of the option negotiator, but refuses\n      all options, operational.\n\
    \    - Mid-September, 1975 -- Design of the options done.  A version of\n    \
    \  the TIP which includes any modifications that are necessary to\n      support\
    \ the options operational.\n    - Mid-November -- Operational version of the TIP\
    \ with the basic set\n      of options implemented (Binary Transmission, Echo,\
    \ Suppress Go-\n      Ahead, Timing Mark, RCTE).\n    - End of 1975 -- Any problems\
    \ with hosts worked out, any necessary\n      revisions done, and a solid version\
    \ of the TIP up and running the\n      TELNET Protocol with options.\n       [\
