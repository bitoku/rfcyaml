This memo contains a snapshot of the state of standardization of protocols used in the Internet, as determined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
It is a July 22, 2004 snapshot of the current official protocol standards list and the Best Current Practice list, which is updated daily and is available from the RFC Editor Web site.
The RFC Editor publishes Request for Comments (RFC) documents that are the output of the IETF process or are submitted individually via electronic mail.
Further information about the RFC series is contained in section 2.1, RFC 2026 and at http://www.rfc editor.org.
This memo is published by the RFC Editor for the IESG and IAB in accordance with Section 2.1 of "The Internet Standards Process   Revision 3", RFC 2026, which specifies the rules and procedures by which all Internet standards are set.
3.1 3.7 of this memo contain the lists of protocols in each stage of standardization Standard, Draft Standard, Proposed Standard, Experimental, as well as Best Current Practice documents.
Protocols that are new to this document or have been moved from one protocol level to another, or that differ from the previous edition of this document are marked with an asterisk.
Informational and Historic RFCs are not included.
This memo lists the current standards track, Best Current Practice, and Experimental protocols; it is not a complete index to RFCs.
