  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and\
    \ [RFC1035].\n   The DNS currently supports keyed data retrieval using three\n\
    \   namespaces -- domain names, IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses.\n   Mapping\
    \ of IPv4 addresses to names is accomplished using data\n   published in the IN-ADDR.ARPA\
    \ zone.  For IPv6, the IP6.ARPA zone is\n   used (see [RFC3596]).  The process\
    \ of mapping an address to a name is\n   generally known as a \"reverse lookup\"\
    , and the IN-ADDR.ARPA and\n   IP6.ARPA zones are said to support the \"reverse\
    \ DNS\".\n   The secure and stable hosting of the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones\n\
    \   is critical to the operation of the Internet, since many applications\n  \
    \ rely upon timely responses to reverse lookups to be able to operate\n   normally.\n\
    \   At the time of this writing, the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone is served by a\n   subset\
    \ of the DNS root servers, and IP6.ARPA by servers operated by\n   APNIC, ARIN,\
    \ ICANN, LACNIC, and the RIPE NCC (see Appendix A).\n   This document specifies\
    \ a dedicated and stable set of nameserver\n   names for each of the IN-ADDR.ARPA\
    \ and IP6.ARPA zones.\n   The naming scheme specified in this document allows\
    \ IN-ADDR.ARPA and\n   IP6.ARPA to be delegated to two different sets of nameservers,\
    \ to\n   facilitate operational separation of the infrastructure used to serve\n\
    \   each zone.  This separation might help ensure that an operational\n   failure\
    \ of IN-ADDR.ARPA servers does not impact IPv6 reverse lookups\n   as collateral\
    \ damage, for example.\n   The choice of operators for individual nameservers\
    \ is beyond the\n   scope of this document and is an IANA function that falls\
    \ under the\n   scope of Section 4 of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between\n\
    \   the IETF and ICANN [RFC2860].\n"

    \   The IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA zone has been delegated to the same set of\n   servers\
    \ as IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IPv4 and IPv6 glue records for each of\n   those servers has\
    \ been added to the ARPA zone.\n   The IN-ADDR-SERVERS.ARPA and IN-ADDR.ARPA zones\
    \ are delegated to the\n   same servers, since they are both dedicated for a single\
    \ purpose and\n   hence can reasonably share fate.\n   All servers in the set\
    \ are named under the same domain to facilitate\n   label compression.  Since\
    \ glue for all servers exist in the ARPA\n   zone, the use of a single domain\
    \ does not present a practical single\n   point of failure.\n"

  - "B.1.  Label Compression\n   The choice of names for the respective NS RRSets\
    \ of the IN-ADDR.ARPA\n   and IP6.ARPA zones have a relatively minor impact on\
    \ the delegation\n   response sizes from their parent zones, given other anticipated\n\
    \   contributors such as DNSSEC.  However, it is still considered good\n   practice\
    \ to use a naming scheme that is reasonably compressible:\n   doing so for frequently\
    \ queried zones such as these is likely to have\n   at least measurable impact\
    \ on aggregate DNS traffic in the Internet\n   as a whole, and has potential transport\
    \ benefits to clients whose\n   queries will not result in secure replies.\n \
    \  The naming schemes described in Sections 2 and 3 are highly\n   compressible.\
    \  That is, once a single nameserver name has been\n   encoded in a DNS message,\
    \ subsequent nameservers can be specified\n   with substantially smaller encoding.\n\
    \   In the DNS, a complete encoding of an a-label involves a one-byte\n   length\
    \ field, plus a one-byte-per-character encoding of the a-label\n   itself.  A\
    \ domain name's encoding consists of one or more a-labels,\n   so-encoded, plus\
    \ a single terminating zero byte.  Where a terminating\n   series of a-labels\
    \ has already been encoded as described above,\n   subsequent terminating references\
    \ to the same series can be made\n   using a two-byte pointer to that full encoding.\n\
    \   The non-compressed representation of the nameserver A.IN-ADDR-\n   SERVERS.ARPA\
    \ fills (1 + 1) + (15 + 1) + (4 + 1) + 1 = 24 bytes.\n   The non-compressed representation\
    \ of A.IP6-SERVERS.ARPA fills\n   (1 + 1) + (10 + 1) + (4 + 1) + 1 = 19 bytes.\n\
    \   Subsequent nameservers under either domain are encoded with the\n   initial\
    \ label, plus two bytes for a pointer to the repeated domain\n   elsewhere in\
    \ the message, i.e., (1 + 1) + 2 = 4 bytes.\n   The encoded size of the a-labels\
    \ in a twelve-record NS RRSet named\n   according to Section 2 for IN-ADDR.ARPA\
