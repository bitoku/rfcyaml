  - "2. Definitions\n   For the purposes of this document, the following definitions
    apply:\n   Y: An 8-bit or 10-bit coded \"luminance\" sample.  Luminance in this\n
    \  context refers to the BT.601-5 [3] definition which is not the same\n   as
    a true CIE luminance value.  The value of \"luminance\" refers\n   specifically
    to video luma. However, in order to avoid confusion with\n   the BT.656 and BT.601
    standards, the video luma value is referenced\n   in this document as luminance.
    \ Each value has 220 quantization\n   levels with the black level corresponding
    to level 16 and the peak\n   white level corresponding to 235.\n   Cb, Cr: An
    8-bit or 10-bit coded color-difference sample (as per\n   BT.601-5).  Each color-difference
    value has 225 quantization levels\n   in the centre part of the quantization scale
    with a color-difference\n   of zero having an encoded value of 128.\n   True Black:
    BT.601-5 defines a true black level as the quad-sample\n   sequence 0x80, 0x10,
    0x80, 0x10, representing color-difference values\n   of 128 (0x80) and a luminance
    value of 16 (0x10).\n   SAV, EAV: Video timing reference codes which appear at
    the start and\n   end of a BT.656 scan line.\n"
  title: 2. Definitions
- contents:
  - "3. Payload Design\n   ITU Recommendation BT.656-3 defines a schema for the digital\n
    \  interconnection of television video signals in conjunction with\n   BT.601-5
    which defines the digital representation of the original\n   analog signal.  While
    BT.601-5 refers to images with or without color\n   subsampling, the interconnection
    standard (BT.656-3) specifically\n   requires 4:2:2 subsampling. This specification
    also requires 4:2:2\n   subsampling such that the luminance stream occupies twice
    the\n   bandwidth of each of the two color-difference streams.  For normal\n   4:3
    aspect ratio images, this results in 720 luminance samples per\n   scan line,
    and 360 samples of each of the two chrominance channels.\n   The total number
    of samples per scan line in this case is 1440.\n   While this payload format specification
    can accomodate various image\n   sizes and frame rates, only those in accordance
    with BT.601-5 are\n   currently supported.\n   Due to the lack of any form of
    video compression within the payload\n   and sampling-rate compliance with BT.601-5,
    the resultant video\n   stream can be considered \"studio quality\".  However,
    such a stream\n   can require approximately 20 megabytes per second of network\n
    \  bandwidth.  In order to maximize packet size within a given MTU, and\n   to
    optimize scan line decoding, each video scan line is encoded\n   within one or
    more RTP packets.\n   To allow for scan line synchronization, each packet includes
    certain\n   flag bits (as defined in BT.656-3) and a unique scan line number.\n
    \  The SAV and EAV timing reference codes are removed. Furthermore, no\n   line
    blanking samples are included, so no ancillary data can be\n   included in the
    line blanking period.  It is the responsibility of\n   the receiver to generate
    the timing reference codes, and to insert\n   the correct number of line blanking
    samples.\n   Similarly, there is no requirement that the frame blanking samples
    be\n   provided.  However, it is possible to include frame blanking samples\n
    \  if such samples contain relevant information, such as a vertical-\n   interlace
    time code (VITC), or teletext data.  In the absence of\n   frame blanking samples,
    the receiver MUST generate true black levels\n   as defined above, to complete
    the correct number of scan lines per\n   field.  If frame blanking samples are
    provided, they MUST be copied\n   without modification into the resultant BT.656-3
    stream.\n   Scan lines MUST be sent in sequential order.  Error concealment for\n
    \  missing scan lines or fragments of scan lines is at the discretion of\n   the
    receiver.\n   Both 8-bit and 10-bit quantization types as defined by BT.601-5
    are\n   supported.  10-bit samples are considered to have two extra bits of\n
    \  fixed-point precision such that a binary value of 10111110.11\n   represents
    a sample value of 190.75.  Using 8-bit quantization, this\n   would give a sample
    value of 190.  An application receiving 8-bit\n   samples for a 10-bit device
    MUST consider the sample as reflecting\n   the most-significant 8 bits.  The two
    least-significant bits SHOULD\n   be set to zero.  Similarly, an application sending
    8-bit samples from\n   a 10-bit device MUST drop the two least-significant bits.
    \ For a 10-\n   bit quantization payload, each pair of samples MUST be encoded
    into a\n   40-bit word (five octets) prior to transmission, as specified in\n
    \  Section 6.\n   To allow for scan lines with octet lengths larger than the path\n
    \  maximum transmission unit (MTU), a scan offset field is included in\n   the
    packet header.  Applications SHOULD attempt path MTU discovery\n   [6] and fragment
    scan lines into multiple packets no larger than the\n   MTU.\n   Fragmentation
    MUST occur on a sample-pair boundary, such that the\n   chrominance and luminance
    values are not split across packets.  For\n   8-bit quantization this gives a
    four-octet alignment, and a five-\n   octet alignment for 10-bit quantization.
    \ As a result, the scan\n   offset refers not to the byte offset within the payload,
    but the\n   sample-pair offset.\n"

  - "4. Usage of RTP\n   Due to the unreliable nature of the RTP protocol, and the
    lack of an\n   orderly delivery mechanism, each packet contains enough information\n
    \  to form a single scan line without reference to prior scan lines or\n   prior
    frames.  In addition to the RTP header, a fixed length payload\n   header is included
    in each packet.  This header is four octets in\n   length.\n       0                   1

    - "4.1. RTP Header usage\n   Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header.  The
      following fields\n   of the RTP fixed header are used for BT.656-3 encapsulation:\n
      \  Marker bit (M): The Marker bit of the RTP header is set to 1 for the\n   last
      packet of a frame (or the last fragment of the last scan line if\n   fragmented),
      and set to 0 on all other packets.\n   Payload Type (PT): The Payload Type indicates
      the use of the payload\n   format defined in this document.  A profile MAY assign
      a payload type\n   value for this format either statically or dynamically as
      described\n   in RFC 1890 [4].\n   Timestamp: The RTP Timestamp encodes the
      sampling instant of the\n   video frame currently being rendered.  All scan
      line packets within\n   the same frame will have the same timestamp.  The timestamp
      SHOULD\n   refer to the 'Ov' field synchronization point of the first field.\n

    \  F: 1 bit\n   When 0, indicates the first field of a frame (line 4 through 265\n
    \  inclusive for Type=0 or 2, and line 1 through 312 inclusive for Type=1\n   or
    3).  Any other scan line is considered a component of the second\n   field, and
    the F bit will be set to 1.  This bit is copied directly\n   from the BT.656-compliant
    stream by the transmitter, and inserted into\n   the stream by the receiver.\n
    \  V: 1 bit\n   When 1, indicates that the scan line is part of the vertical interval.\n
    \  Should always be 0 unless frame blanking data is sent.  In which case,\n   the
    V bit SHOULD be set to 1 for scan lines which do not form an\n   integral part
    of the image. This bit is copied directly from the\n   BT.656-compliant stream
    by the transmitter, and inserted into the\n   stream by the receiver.  For receivers
    which do not receive scan lines\n   during the vertical interval, BT.656 vertical
    interval data MUST be\n   generated by repeating the quad-sample sequence 0x80,
    0x10, 0x80,\n   0x10, representing a true black level.\n   Type: 4 bits\n   This
    field indicates the type of frame encoding within the payload.\n   It MUST remain
    unchanged for all scan lines within the same frame.\n   Currently only four types
    of encoding are defined.  These are as\n   follows;\n      0 - NTSC (13.5MHz sample
    rate; 720 samples per line; 60 fields\n          per second; 525 lines per frame)\n

    1144 samples per\n          line; 60 fields per second; 525 lines per frame)\n
    \     3 - High Definition PAL (18MHz sample rate; 1152 samples per\n          line;
    50 fields per second; 625 lines per frame)\n   Further encodings can only be defined
    through the Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority (IANA).  For more information
    refer to Section 8,\n   \"IANA Considerations\".\n   P: 1 bit\n   Indicates the
    required sample quantization size.  When 0, the payload\n   is comprised of 8-bit
    samples.  Otherwise, it carries 10-bit samples.\n   This bit MUST remain unchanged
    for all scan lines within the same\n   frame.\n   Z: 2 bits\n   Reserved for future
    use.  Must be set to zero by the transmitter and\n   ignored by the receiver.\n
    \  Scan Line (SL): 12 bits\n   Indicates the scan line encapsulated in the payload.
    \ Valid values\n   range from 1 through 625 inclusive. If no frame blanking data
    is\n   being transmitted, only scan lines 23 through 310 inclusive, and\n   lines
    336 through 623 inclusive SHOULD be sent in the case of Type=1\n   or 3.  For
    525/60 encoding (Type=0 or 2), scan lines 10 through 263\n   inclusive and lines
    273 through 525 SHOULD be transmitted.\n   If a receiver is generating a BT.656-3
    data stream directly from this\n   packet, the F and V bits MUST be copied from
    the header rather than\n   being generated implicitly from the scan line number.
    \ In the event\n   of a conflict, the F and V bits have precedence.\n   Scan Offset
    (SO): 11 bits\n   Indicates the offset within the scan line for application-level\n
    \  fragmentation.  After doing PMTU discovery, if the path MTU is less\n   than
    the required size for one complete scan line, the data SHOULD be\n   fragmented
    such that a given RTP packet does not exceed the allowable\n   MTU.  The offset
    for the first packet of a scan line MUST be set to\n   zero.  The scan offset
    refers to the sample-pair offset within the\n   scan such that for a scan line
    width of 720, the maximum scan offset\n   is 359.\n"

    to specific\n   schema defined by ITU-R Recommendation BT.656-3.  Future revisions
    of\n   the recommendation may create further encoding types which need to be\n
    \  supported over RTP. The \"Type\" field is four bits wide allowing for a\n   total
    of up to sixteen possible encodings, with twelve currently\n   reserved for future
    use.  Due to the small number of possible\n   encodings and given that it is very
    unlikely that future revisions of\n   BT.656 will introduce any new schema, requests
    to extend the Type\n   field MUST be vetted by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.\n
    \  Furthermore, implementors SHOULD check the IANA repository for new\n   definitions
    of the Type field in order to comply with this document.\n   Applications for
    a new Type value MUST be submitted to the IANA and\n   include the requestors
    name and contact information, the reason for\n   requesting a new Type and references

    the security of a\n   compliant implementation, such security risk MUST be detailed
    in the\n   application.  The application will be reviewed by a Designated Expert\n
