In the process of generating RFC #271 we have discovered a set of errors in BBN Report
The attached page is a corrected version of page 25; in addition the first two lines should be deleted from page 26.
The paragraph at the top of page 25 is changed to show that the Host is NOT marked dead under the stated conditions, and to show that the timeout period is 30 (rather than 40) seconds.
In the footnote, the two changes are underlined; these changes also show the timeout period as 30 seconds.
A more formal update to Report 1822 will be distributed eventually.
Please note that these changes reflect errors in previous versions of Report 1822,  not  changes to the IMP system.
The timeout period has ALWAYS been 30 seconds and the Host was NEVER marked dead under these conditions.
