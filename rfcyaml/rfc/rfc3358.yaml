  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an optional extension to the Intermediate\n\
    \   System to Intermediate System (ISIS) protocol, used today by several\n   Internet\
    \ Service Proviers (ISPs) for routing within their clouds.\n   ISIS is an interior\
    \ gateway routing protocol developed originally by\n   OSI and used with IP extensions\
    \ as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).\n   ISIS originally does not provide Complete\
    \ Sequence Numbers Protocol\n   Data (CSNP) and Partial Sequence Numbers Protocol\
    \ Data Unit (PSNP)\n   checksums, relying on the underlying layers to verify the\
    \ integrity\n   of information provided.  Experience with the protocol shows that\n\
    \   this precondition does not always hold and scenarios can be imagined\n   that\
    \ impact protocol functionality.  This document introduces a new\n   optional\
    \ Type, Length and Value (TLV) providing checksums.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   ISIS [ISO90, Cal90a, Cal90b] CSNPs and PSNPs and IIHs can\
    \ be\n   corrupted in case of faulty implementations of L2 hardware or lack of\n\
    \   checksuming on a specific network technology.  As a particularly ugly\n  \
    \ case, corruption of length and/or TLV length fields may lead to the\n   generation\
    \ of extensive numbers of \"empty\" LSPs in the receiving\n   node.  Since we\
    \ cannot rely on authentication as a checksum\n   mechanism, this document proposes\
    \ an optional TLV to add checksums to\n   the elements.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in [Bra97].\n"
- title: 2.  TLV Description
  contents:
  - "2.  TLV Description\n   This optional TLV MAY BE included in all CSNP, PSNP and\
    \ IIH packets\n   and an implementation that implements optional checksums MUST\
    \ accept\n   PDUs if they do NOT contain the optional checksum.  Implementations\n\
    \   that receive an optional checksum TLV and support it MUST discard the\n  \
    \ PDU if the checksum is incorrect.  An implementation that does NOT\n   implement\
    \ optional checksums MUST accept a PDU that contains the\n   checksum TLV.  An\
    \ implementation that supports optional checksums and\n   receives it within any\
    \ other PDU than CSNP, PSNP or IIH MUST discard\n   the PDU.  Such an implementation\
    \ MUST discard the PDU as well if more\n   than one optional checksum TLVs are\
    \ included within it.\n   Additionally, any implementation supporting optional\
    \ checksums MUST\n   accept PDUs with an optional checksum with the value 0 and\
    \ consider\n   such a checksum as correct.\n"
- title: 3.  Checksum Computation
  contents:
  - "3.  Checksum Computation\n   The checksum is a fletcher checksum computed according\
    \ to [ISO98],\n   Annex C over the complete PDU.  To compute the correct checksum,\
    \ an\n   implementation MUST add the optional checksum TLV to the PDU with the\n\
    \   initial checksum value of 0 and compute the checksum over such a PDU.\n"
- title: 4.  Interaction with TLVs using PDU Data to Compute Signatures
  contents:
  - "4.  Interaction with TLVs using PDU Data to Compute Signatures\n   The implementation\
    \ MUST either omit the optional checksum on an\n   interface or send a 0 checksum\
    \ value if it includes in the PDU\n   signatures that provide equivalent or stronger\
    \ functionality, such as\n   HMAC or MD5.  Otherwise an implementation that handles\
    \ such\n   signatures but does not handle the optional checksums, may fail to\n\
    \   compute the MD5 signature on the packet.  Such a failure would be\n   caused\
    \ by the fact that MD5 is computed with the checksum value set\n   to 0 and only\
    \ as a final step is the checksum value being filled in.\n"
