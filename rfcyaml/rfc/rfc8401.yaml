  - "1.  Introduction\n   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [RFC8279] defines
    an\n   architecture where all intended multicast receivers are encoded as a\n
    \  bitmask in the multicast packet header within different\n   encapsulations
    such as described in [RFC8296].  A router that\n   receives such a packet will
    forward the packet based on the bit\n   position in the packet header towards
    the receiver(s) following a\n   precomputed tree for each of the bits in the packet.
    \ Each receiver\n   is represented by a unique bit in the bitmask.\n   This document
    presents necessary extensions to the currently deployed\n   IS-IS for IP [RFC1195]
    to support distribution of information\n   necessary for operation of BIER domains
    and subdomains.  This\n   document defines a new TLV to be advertised by every
    router\n   participating in BIER signaling.\n   This document defines support
    for MPLS encapsulation as specified in\n   [RFC8296].  Support for other encapsulation
    types and the use of\n   multiple encapsulation types are outside the scope of
    this document.\n"

    bit position.\n   BIER-OL:  BIER Overlay Signaling.  The method for the BFIR to
    learn\n      about BFERs.\n   BFR:  Bit Forwarding Router.  A router that participates
    in Bit Index\n      Multipoint Forwarding.  A BFR is identified by a unique BFR-prefix\n
    \     in a BIER domain.\n   BFIR:  Bit Forwarding Ingress Router.  The ingress
    border router that\n      inserts the BitString into the packet.  Each BFIR must
    have a\n      valid BFR-id assigned.\n   BFER:  Bit Forwarding Egress Router.
    \ A router that participates in\n      Bit Index Forwarding as a leaf.  Each BFER
    must be a BFR.  Each\n      BFER must have a valid BFR-id assigned.\n   BFT:  Bit
    Forwarding Tree used to reach all BFERs in a domain.\n   BIER subdomain:  A further
    distinction within a BIER domain\n      identified by its unique subdomain identifier.
    \ A BIER subdomain\n      can support multiple BitString Lengths.\n   BFR-id:
    \ An optional, unique identifier for a BFR within a BIER\n      subdomain.\n   Invalid
    BFR-id:  Unassigned BFR-id.  The special value 0 is reserved\n      for this purpose.\n

    Algorithm.  May be used to modify, enhance, or replace the\n      calculation

    - "4.1.  BIER Domains and Subdomains\n   An IS-IS-signaled BIER domain is aligned
      with the scope of\n   distribution of BFR-prefixes that identify the BFRs within
      IS-IS.  In\n   such a case, IS-IS acts as the supporting BIER underlay.\n   Within
      such a domain, the extensions defined in this document\n   advertise BIER information
      for one or more BIER subdomains.  Each\n   subdomain is uniquely identified
      by a subdomain-id (SD).  Each\n   subdomain is associated with a single IS-IS
      topology (MT) [RFC5120],\n   which may be any of the topologies supported by
      IS-IS.  Local\n   configuration controls which <MT,SD> pairs are supported by
      a router.\n   The mapping of subdomains to topologies MUST be consistent within
      the\n   IS-IS flooding domain used to advertise BIER information.\n   Each BIER
      subdomain has as its unique attributes the encapsulation\n   used and the type
      of tree it uses to forward BIER frames (currently\n   always SPF).  Additionally,
      per supported BitString length in the\n   subdomain, each router will advertise
      the necessary label ranges to\n   support it.\n"

    - "4.2.  Advertising BIER Information\n   BIER information advertisements are
      associated with a new sub-TLV in\n   the extended reachability TLVs.  BIER information
      is always\n   associated with a host prefix, which MUST be a node address for
      the\n   advertising node.  If this is not the case, the advertisement MUST be\n
      \  ignored.  Therefore, the following restrictions apply:\n   o  Prefix length
      MUST be 32 for an IPv4 prefix or 128 for an IPv6\n      prefix.\n   o  When
      the Prefix Attributes Flags sub-TLV [RFC7794] is present, the\n      N flag
      MUST be set and the R flag MUST NOT be set.\n   o  BIER sub-TLVs MUST be included
      when a prefix reachability\n      advertisement is leaked between levels.\n"

      one and only one topology.  All\n   routers in the flooding scope of the BIER
      sub-TLVs MUST advertise the\n   same subdomain within the same multi-topology.
      \ A router receiving an\n   <MT,SD> advertisement that does not match the locally
      configured pair\n   MUST report a misconfiguration of the received <MT,SD> pair.
      \ All\n   received BIER advertisements associated with the conflicting <MT,SD>\n
      \  pair MUST be ignored.  Note that in the presence of such a\n   misconfiguration,
      this will lead to partitioning of the subdomain.\n   Example:\n   The following
      combination of advertisements are valid: <0,0> <0,1>,\n   and <2,2>.\n   The
      following combination of advertisements are invalid: <0,0> <0,1>,\n   and <2,0>.

      BFR-id MUST be\n   unique within the flooding scope of the BIER advertisements.
      \ All\n   BFERs/BFIRs MUST detect advertisement of duplicate valid BFR-IDs for\n
      \  a given <MT,SD>.  When such duplication is detected, all of the\n   routers

      to avoid\n   excessive output.\n"

      is not\n   met for an extended period of time (more than a few seconds of\n
      \  burstiness), changes will increase the number of Link State PDU (LSP)\n   updates
      and negatively impact performance in the network.\n   Implementations SHOULD

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Security concerns for IS-IS are addressed in
    [RFC5304] and [RFC5310].\n   The Security Considerations section of [RFC8279]
    discusses the\n   possibility of performing a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by
    setting\n   too many bits in the BitString of a BIER-encapsulated packet.\n   However,
    this sort of DoS attack cannot be initiated by modifying the\n   IS-IS BIER advertisements
    specified in this document.  A BFIR decides\n   which systems are to receive a
    BIER-encapsulated packet.  In making\n   this decision, it is not influenced by
    the IS-IS control messages.\n   When creating the encapsulation, the BFIR sets
    one bit in the\n   encapsulation for each destination system.  The information
    in the\n   IS-IS BIER advertisements is used to construct the forwarding tables\n
    \  that map each bit in the encapsulation into a set of next hops for\n   the
    host that is identified by that bit, but it is not used by the\n   BFIR to decide
    which bits to set.  Hence, an attack on the IS-IS\n   control plane cannot be
    used to cause this sort of DoS attack.\n   While a BIER-encapsulated packet is
    traversing the network, a BFR\n   that receives a BIER-encapsulated packet with
    n bits set in its\n   BitString may have to replicate the packet and forward multiple\n
    \  copies.  However, a given bit will only be set in one copy of the\n   packet.
    \ This means that each transmitted replica of a received\n   packet has fewer
    bits set (i.e., is targeted to fewer destinations)\n   than the received packet.
    \ This is an essential property of the BIER-\n   forwarding process as defined
    in [RFC8279].  While a failure of this\n   process might cause a DoS attack (as
    discussed in the Security\n   Considerations of [RFC8279]), such a failure cannot
    be caused by an\n   attack on the IS-IS control plane.\n   Further discussion
    of BIER-specific security considerations can be\n   found in [RFC8279].\n"
