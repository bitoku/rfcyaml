  - "                        DOCUMENTATION CONVENTIONS\nThe Network Working Group\
    \ seems to consist of Steve Carr of Utah, Jeff\nRulifson and Bill Duvall at SRI,\
    \ and Steve Crocker and Gerard Deloche\nat UCLA.  Membership is not closed.\n\
    The Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software, the\nstrategies\
    \ for using the network, and initial experiments with the network.\nDocumentation\
    \ of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.  Notes\nmay be produced at\
    \ any site by anybody and included in this series.\nCONTENT\nThe content of a\
    \ NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related to\nthe HOST software\
    \ or other aspect of the network.  Notes are encouraged to\nbe timely rather than\
    \ polished.  Philosophical positions without examples\nor other specifics, specific\
    \ suggestions or implementation techniques\nwithout introductory or background\
    \ explication, and explicit questions\nwithout any attempted answers are all acceptable.\
    \  The minimum length for \na NWG note is one sentence.\nThese standards (or lack\
    \ of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.\nFirst, there is a tendency\
    \ to view a written statement as ipso facto \nauthoritative, and we hope to promote\
    \ the exchange and discussion of \nconsiderably less than authoritative ideas.\
    \  Second, there is a natural\nhesitancy to publish something unpolished, and\
    \ we hope to ease this\ninhibition.\nFORM\nEvery NWG note should bear the following\
    \ information:\n        1.  \"Network Working Group\"\n            \"Request for\
    \ Comments:\" x\n            where x is a serial number.\n            Serial numbers\
    \ are assigned by Bill Duvall at SRI\n        2.  Author and affiliation\n   \
    \     3.  Date\n        4.  Title.  The title need not be unique.\nDISTRIBUTION\n\
    One copy only will be sent from the author's site to\"\n        1.  Bob Kahn,\
    \ BB&N\n        2.  Larry Roberts, ARPA\n        3.  Steve Carr, UCLA\n      \
    \  4.  Jeff Rulifson, UTAH\n        5.  Ron Stoughton, UCSB\n        6.  Steve\
    \ Crocker, UCLA\nReproduction if desired may be handled locally.  \nOTHER NOTES\n\
    Two notes (1 & 2) have been written so far.  These are both titled HOST\nSoftware\
    \ and are by Steve Crocker and Bill Duvall, separately.\nOther notes planned are\
    \ on\n        1.  Network Timetable\n        2.  The Philosophy of NIL\n     \
    \   3.  Specifications for NIL\n        4.  Deeper Documentation of HOST Software.\n"
