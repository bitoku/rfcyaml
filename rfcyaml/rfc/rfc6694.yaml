- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the \"about\" Uniform Resource Identifier\
    \ (URI)\n   scheme.  The \"about\" URI scheme is currently widely used by Web\n\
    \   browsers to designate access to their internal resources, such as\n   settings,\
    \ application information, and so-called \"Easter eggs\" (i.e.,\n   a hidden feature\
    \ or joke in an application).\n"

- title: 2.1.  URI Scheme Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.1.  URI Scheme Syntax\n   The \"about\" URI syntactically conforms to the <about-uri>\
    \ rule below,\n   expressed using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]:\n\
    \     about-uri = \"about:\" about-token [ about-query ] [ about-fragment ]\n\
    \     about-token = *pchar\n     about-query = \"?\" query\n     about-fragment\
    \ = \"#\" fragment\n     pchar     = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>\n\
    \     query     = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>\n     fragment  = <as\
    \ specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>\n"
- title: 2.2.  URI Scheme Semantics
  contents:
  - "2.2.  URI Scheme Semantics\n   The resource that is referenced by a particular\
    \ \"about\" URI is\n   denoted by the <about-token> part of the URI.  It is not\
    \ a\n   hierarchical element for a naming authority.  The <about-query> part\n\
    \   specifies additional information about its handling and/or the\n   information\
    \ that should be returned by the resource referenced by\n   the URI.\n   It is\
    \ impossible to specify a binding between all the possible tokens\n   and the\
    \ semantics of \"about\" URIs that would contain such tokens.\n   Therefore, the\
    \ resource referenced by the URI is generally considered\n   to be specific to\
    \ a Web browser implementation.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Well-Known "about" URIs
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Well-Known \"about\" URIs\n   Some <about-token>s have been reserved,\
    \ as the behavior of the\n   resource that is referenced is well-known (well-known\
    \ tokens).\n   A well-known \"about\" URI is a URI that has a well-known token\
    \ as its\n   <about-token> part.  It is recommended that such URIs be handled\
    \ in\n   accordance with the specification referenced in the \"about\" URI\n \
    \  Tokens registry (see Section 5.2).\n   Well-known \"about\" URIs are intended\
    \ to be registered when there is a\n   need to codify the behavior of a particular\
    \ <about-token>.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Encoding Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Encoding Considerations\n   \"about\" URIs are subject to encoding rules\
    \ as defined in RFC 3986\n   [RFC3986].\n"
- title: 3.  "about:blank"
  contents:
  - "3.  \"about:blank\"\n   This document defines one well-known token: \"blank\"\
    .  The\n   \"about:blank\" URI refers to a resource represented in the browser\
    \ by\n   a blank page.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for URIs are discussed\
    \ in Section 7 of\n   RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  However, most of those provisions do\
    \ not apply\n   to the \"about\" URI scheme, as they are mainly scoped to schemes\
    \ used\n   in the Internet.\n   \"about\" URIs can sometimes refer to sensitive\
    \ information, such as\n   user passwords stored in a cache, or parameters that,\
    \ if changed,\n   could affect a user's data.  The application therefore needs\
    \ to\n   ensure that the user's data is secured and no threats are imposed by\n\
    \   \"about\" URIs.\n"

- title: 5.2.1.  Registration Procedure
  contents:
  - "5.2.1.  Registration Procedure\n   The registration policy for this registry\
    \ is \"First Come First\n   Served\", as described in RFC 5226 [RFC5226].  The\
    \ registrant of the\n   token should provide the information mentioned in the\
    \ following\n   registration template:\n   o  Registered token:  The desired well-known\
    \ token to be used in\n      \"about\" URIs.\n   o  Intended usage:  A short description\
    \ of how \"about\" URIs with the\n      registered token are handled, including\
    \ information about the\n      referenced resource.\n   o  Contact/change controller:\
    \  Person (including contact information)\n      authorized to change this registration.\n\
    \   o  Specification:  A stable reference to a document that specifies\n     \
    \ the registered \"about\" URI.  The question of interoperability does\n     \
    \ not arise.  The key motivation is to have a reference to a\n      specification\
    \ documenting well-known behavior of the \"about\" URI\n      in Web browsers.\
    \  As a rule of thumb, if the behavior is common to\n      two or more Web browser\
    \ implementations, it can be considered\n      well-known.  An existing assignment\
    \ may be duplicated if the\n      registered token is used in more than one Web\
    \ browser\n      implementation.\n   The following is a template for the \"blank\"\
    \ token:\n   o  Registered token:  blank\n   o  Intended usage:  The about:blank\
    \ URI references a blank page.\n   o  Contact/change controller:  IESG <iesg@ietf.org>\
    \ (on behalf of the\n      IETF).\n   o  Specification:  RFC 6694\n"
