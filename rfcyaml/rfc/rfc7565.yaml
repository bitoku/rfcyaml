  - "1.  Introduction\n   Existing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes that
    enable\n   interaction with, or that identify resources associated with, a\n   user's
    account at a service provider are tied to particular services\n   or application
    protocols.  Two examples are the 'mailto' scheme\n   (which enables interaction
    with a user's email account) and the\n   'http' scheme (which enables retrieval
    of web files controlled by a\n   user or interaction with interfaces providing
    information about a\n   user).  However, there exists no URI scheme that generically\n
    \  identifies a user's account at a service provider without specifying\n   a
    particular protocol to use when interacting with the account.  This\n   specification
    fills that gap.\n"

    in\n   [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Rationale\n   During formalization of the WebFinger protocol [RFC7033], much\n
    \  discussion occurred regarding the appropriate URI scheme to include\n   when
    specifying a user's account as a web link [RFC5988].  Although\n   both the 'mailto'
    [RFC6068] and 'http' [RFC7230] schemes were\n   proposed, not all service providers
    offer email services or web\n   interfaces on behalf of user accounts (e.g., a
    microblogging or\n   instant messaging provider might not offer email services,
    or an\n   enterprise might not offer HTTP interfaces to information about its\n
    \  employees).  Therefore, the participants in the discussion recognized\n   that
    it would be helpful to define a URI scheme that could be used to\n   generically
    identify a user's account at a service provider,\n   irrespective of the particular
    application protocols used to interact\n   with the account.  The result was the
    'acct' URI scheme defined in\n   this document.\n   (Note that a user is not necessarily
    a human; it could be an\n   automated application such as a bot, a role-based
    alias, etc.\n   However, an 'acct' URI is always used to identify something that
    has\n   an account at a service, not the service itself.)\n"
  title: 3.  Rationale
- contents:
  - "4.  Definition\n   The syntax of the 'acct' URI scheme is defined under Section
    7 of\n   this document.  Although 'acct' URIs take the form \"user@host\", the\n
    \  scheme is designed for the purpose of identification instead of\n   interaction
    (regarding this distinction, see Section 1.2.2 of\n   [RFC3986]).  The \"Internet
    resource\" identified by an 'acct' URI is a\n   user's account hosted at a service
    provider, where the service\n   provider is typically associated with a DNS domain
    name.  Thus, a\n   particular 'acct' URI is formed by setting the \"user\" portion
    to the\n   user's account name at the service provider and by setting the \"host\"\n
    \  portion to the DNS domain name of the service provider.\n   Consider the case
    of a user with an account name of \"foobar\" on a\n   microblogging service \"status.example.net\".
    \ It is taken as\n   convention that the string \"foobar@status.example.net\"
    designates\n   that account.  This is expressed as a URI using the 'acct' scheme
    as\n   \"acct:foobar@status.example.net\".\n   A common scenario is for a user
    to register with a service provider\n   using an identifier (such as an email
    address) that is associated\n   with some other service provider.  For example,
    a user with the email\n   address \"juliet@capulet.example\" might register with
    a commerce\n   website whose domain name is \"shoppingsite.example\".  In order
    to use\n   her email address as the localpart of the 'acct' URI, the at-sign\n
    \  character (U+0040) needs to be percent-encoded as described in\n   [RFC3986].
    \ Thus, the resulting 'acct' URI would be\n   \"acct:juliet%40capulet.example@shoppingsite.example\".\n
    \  It is not assumed that an entity will necessarily be able to interact\n   with
    a user's account using any particular application protocol, such\n   as email;
    to enable such interaction, an entity would need to use the\n   appropriate URI
    scheme for such a protocol, such as the 'mailto'\n   scheme.  While it might be
    true that the 'acct' URI minus the scheme\n   name (e.g., \"user@example.com\"
    derived from \"acct:user@example.com\")\n   can be reached via email or some other
    application protocol, that\n   fact would be purely contingent and dependent upon
    the deployment\n   practices of the provider.\n   Because an 'acct' URI enables
    abstract identification only and not\n   interaction, this specification provides
    no method for dereferencing\n   an 'acct' URI on its own, e.g., as the value of
    the 'href' attribute\n   of an HTML anchor element.  For example, there is no
    behavior\n   specified in this document for an 'acct' URI used as follows:\n   <a
    href='acct:bob@example.com'>find out more</a>\n   Any protocol that uses 'acct'
    URIs is responsible for specifying how\n   an 'acct' URI is employed in the context
    of that protocol (in\n   particular, how it is dereferenced or resolved; see [RFC3986]).
    \ As a\n   concrete example, an \"Account Information\" application of the\n   WebFinger
    protocol [RFC7033] might take an 'acct' URI, resolve the\n   host portion to find
    a WebFinger server, and then pass the 'acct' URI\n   as a parameter in a WebFinger
    HTTP request for metadata (i.e., web\n   links [RFC5988]) about the resource.
    \ For example:\n   GET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct%3Abob%40example.com
    HTTP/1.1\n   The service retrieves the metadata associated with the account\n
    \  identified by that URI and then provides that metadata to the\n   requesting
    entity in an HTTP response.\n   If an application needs to compare two 'acct'
    URIs (e.g., for\n   purposes of authentication and authorization), it MUST do
    so using\n   case normalization and percent-encoding normalization as specified
    in\n   Sections 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.2 of [RFC3986].\n"
  title: 4.  Definition
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Because the 'acct' URI scheme does not directly
    enable interaction\n   with a user's account at a service provider, direct security
    concerns\n   are minimized.\n   However, an 'acct' URI does provide proof of existence
    of the\n   account; this implies that harvesting published 'acct' URIs could\n
    \  prove useful to spammers and similar attackers -- for example, if\n   they
    can use an 'acct' URI to leverage more information about the\n   account (e.g.,
    via WebFinger) or if they can interact with protocol-\n   specific URIs (such
    as 'mailto' URIs) whose user@host portion is the\n   same as that of the 'acct'
    URI.\n   In addition, protocols that make use of 'acct' URIs are responsible\n
    \  for defining security considerations related to such usage, e.g., the\n   risks
    involved in dereferencing an 'acct' URI, the authentication and\n   authorization
    methods that could be used to control access to\n   personal data associated with
    a user's account at a service, and\n   methods for ensuring the confidentiality
    of such information.\n   The use of percent-encoding allows a wider range of characters
    in\n   account names but introduces some additional risks.  Implementers are\n
    \  advised to disallow percent-encoded characters or sequences that\n   would
    (1) result in space, null, control, or other characters that\n   are otherwise
    forbidden, (2) allow unauthorized access to private\n   data, or (3) lead to other
    security vulnerabilities.\n"
  title: 5.  Security Considerations

  - "6.  Internationalization Considerations\n   As specified in [RFC3986], the 'acct'
    URI scheme allows any character\n   from the Unicode repertoire [Unicode] encoded
    as UTF-8 [RFC3629] and\n   then percent-encoded into valid ASCII [RFC20].  Before
    applying any\n   percent-encoding, an application MUST ensure the following about
    the\n   string that is used as input to the URI-construction process:\n   o  The
    userpart consists only of Unicode code points that conform to\n      the PRECIS
    IdentifierClass specified in [RFC7564].\n   o  The host consists only of Unicode
    code points that conform to the\n      rules specified in [RFC5892].\n   o  Internationalized
    domain name (IDN) labels are encoded as A-labels\n      [RFC5890].\n"

  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   In accordance with the guidelines and registration
    procedures for new\n   URI schemes [RFC4395], this section provides the information
    needed\n   to register the 'acct' URI scheme.\n   URI Scheme Name:  acct\n   Status:
    \ permanent\n   URI Scheme Syntax:  The 'acct' URI syntax is defined here in\n
    \     Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234], borrowing the 'host',\n      'pct-encoded',
    'sub-delims', and 'unreserved' rules from\n      [RFC3986]:\n      acctURI      =
    \"acct\" \":\" userpart \"@\" host\n      userpart     = unreserved / sub-delims\n
    \                    0*( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )\n      Note that
    additional rules regarding the strings that are used as\n      input to construction
    of 'acct' URIs further limit the characters\n      that can be percent-encoded;
    see the Encoding Considerations as\n      well as Section 6 of this document.\n
    \  URI Scheme Semantics:  The 'acct' URI scheme identifies accounts\n      hosted
    at service providers.  It is used only for identification,\n      not interaction.
    \ A protocol that employs the 'acct' URI scheme is\n      responsible for specifying
    how an 'acct' URI is dereferenced in\n      the context of that protocol.  There
    is no media type associated\n      with the 'acct' URI scheme.\n   Encoding Considerations:
    \ See Section 6 of this document.\n   Applications/Protocols That Use This URI
    Scheme Name:  At the time of\n      this writing, only the WebFinger protocol
    uses the 'acct' URI\n      scheme.  However, use is not restricted to the WebFinger
    protocol,\n      and the scheme might be considered for use in other protocols.\n
    \  Interoperability Considerations:  There are no known interoperability\n      concerns
    related to use of the 'acct' URI scheme.\n   Security Considerations:  See Section
    5 of this document.\n   Contact:  Peter Saint-Andre, peter@andyet.com\n   Author/Change
    Controller:  This scheme is registered under the IETF\n      tree.  As such, the
    IETF maintains change control.\n   References:  None.\n"
