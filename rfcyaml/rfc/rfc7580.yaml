  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some data-plane technologies that require the use of a GMPLS
    control\n   plane impose additional constraints on switching capability and label\n
    \  assignment.  In addition, some of these technologies should be\n   capable
    of performing non-local label assignment based on the nature\n   of the technology,
    e.g., wavelength continuity constraint in\n   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
    (WSONs) [RFC6163].  Such\n   constraints can lead to the requirement for link-by-link
    label\n   availability in path computation and label assignment.\n   [RFC7579]
    provides efficient encodings of information needed by the\n   routing and label
    assignment process in technologies such as WSON.\n   These encodings are potentially
    applicable to a wider range of\n   technologies as well.  The encoding provided
    in [RFC7579] is\n   protocol-neutral and can be used in routing, signaling, and/or
    Path\n   Computation Element communication protocol extensions.\n   This document
    defines extensions to the OSPF routing protocol based\n   on [RFC7579] to enhance
    the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of\n   GMPLS TE that are defined in [RFC3630],
    [RFC4202], and [RFC4203].\n   The enhancements to the TE properties of GMPLS TE
    links can be\n   advertised in OSPF-TE Link State Advertisements (LSAs).  The
    TE LSA,\n   which is an opaque LSA with area flooding scope [RFC3630], has only\n
    \  one top-level Type-Length-Value (TLV) triplet and has one or more\n   nested
    sub-TLVs for extensibility.  The top-level TLV can take one of\n   three values:
    Router Address [RFC3630], Link [RFC3630], or Node\n   Attribute [RFC5786].  In
    this document, we enhance the sub-TLVs for\n   the Link TLV in support of the
    general network element constraints\n   under the control of GMPLS.\n   The detailed
    encoding of OSPF extensions is not defined in this\n   document.  [RFC7579] provides
    encoding details.\n"

  - "2.  Node Information\n   According to [RFC7579], the additional node information
    representing\n   node switching asymmetry constraints includes device type and\n
    \  connectivity matrix.  Except for the device type, which is defined in\n   [RFC7579],
    the other pieces of information are defined in this\n   document.\n   Per [RFC7579],
    this document defines the Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV\n   of the Node Attribute
    TLV defined in [RFC5786].  The new sub-TLV has\n   Type 14.\n   Depending on the
    control-plane implementation being used, the\n   Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV may
    be optional in some specific\n   technologies, e.g., WSON networks.  Usually,
    for example, in WSON\n   networks, the Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV may be advertised
    in the\n   LSAs since WSON switches are currently asymmetric.  If no\n   Connectivity
    Matrix sub-TLV is included, it is assumed that the\n   switches support symmetric
    switching.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Connectivity Matrix\n   If the switching devices supporting certain data-plane
      technology are\n   asymmetric, it is necessary to identify which input ports
      and labels\n   can be switched to some specific labels on a specific output
      port.\n   The connectivity matrix, which can represent either the potential\n
      \  connectivity matrix for asymmetric switches (e.g., Reconfigurable\n   Optical
      Add/Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs) and such) or fixed\n   connectivity for an asymmetric
      device such as a multiplexer as\n   defined in [RFC7446], is used to identify
      these restrictions.\n   The Connectivity Matrix is a sub-TLV of the Node Attribute
      TLV.  The\n   length is the length of the value field in octets.  The meaning
      and\n   format of this sub-TLV value field are defined in Section 2.1 of\n   [RFC7579].
      \ One sub-TLV contains one matrix.  The Connectivity Matrix\n   sub-TLV may
      occur more than once to contain multiple matrices within\n   the Node Attribute
      TLV.  In addition, a large connectivity matrix can\n   be decomposed into smaller
      sub-matrices for transmission in multiple\n   LSAs as described in Section 5.\n"

  title: 2.  Node Information
- contents:
  - "3.  Link Information\n   The most common link sub-TLVs nested in the top-level
    Link TLV are\n   already defined in [RFC3630] and [RFC4203].  For example, Link
    ID,\n   Administrative Group, Interface Switching Capability Descriptor\n   (ISCD),
    Link Protection Type, Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG), and\n   Traffic Engineering
    Metric are among the typical link sub-TLVs.\n   Per [RFC7579], this document defines
    the Port Label Restrictions sub-\n   TLV of the Link TLV defined in [RFC3630].
    \ The new sub-TLV has Type\n   34.\n   Generally, all the sub-TLVs above are optional,
    depending on control-\n   plane implementations being used.  The Port Label Restrictions
    sub-\n   TLV will not be advertised when there are no restrictions on label\n
    \  assignment.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Port Label Restrictions\n   Port label restrictions describe the label
      restrictions that the\n   network element (node) and link may impose on a port.
      \ These\n   restrictions represent what labels may or may not be used on a link\n
      \  and are intended to be relatively static.  For increased modeling\n   flexibility,
      port label restrictions may be specified relative to the\n   port in general
      or to a specific connectivity matrix.\n   For example, the port label restrictions
      describe the wavelength\n   restrictions that the link and various optical devices
      such as\n   Optical Cross-Connects (OXCs), ROADMs, and waveband multiplexers
      may\n   impose on a port in WSON.  These restrictions represent which\n   wavelengths
      may or may not be used on a link and are relatively\n   static.  Detailed information
      about port label restrictions is\n   provided in [RFC7446].\n   The Port Label
      Restrictions sub-TLV is a sub-TLV of the Link TLV.\n   The length is the length
      of value field in octets.  The meaning and\n   format of this sub-TLV value
      field are defined in Section 2.2 of\n   [RFC7579].  The Port Label Restrictions
      sub-TLV may occur more than\n   once to specify a complex port constraint within
      the Link TLV.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Routing Procedures\n   All sub-TLVs are nested in top-level TLV(s) and contained
    in Opaque\n   LSAs.  The flooding rules of Opaque LSAs are specified in [RFC2328],\n
    \  [RFC5250], [RFC3630], and [RFC4203].\n   Considering the routing scalability
    issues in some cases, the routing\n   protocol should be capable of supporting
    the separation of dynamic\n   information from relatively static information to
    avoid unnecessary\n   updates of static information when dynamic information is
    changed.  A\n   standards-compliant approach is to separate the dynamic information\n
    \  sub-TLVs from the static information sub-TLVs, each nested in a\n   separate
    top-level TLV (see [RFC3630] and [RFC5786]), and advertise\n   them in the separate
    OSPF-TE LSAs.\n   For node information, since the connectivity matrix information
    is\n   static, the LSA containing the Node Attribute TLV can be updated with\n
    \  a lower frequency to avoid unnecessary updates.\n   For link information, a
    mechanism MAY be applied such that static\n   information and dynamic information
    of one TE link are contained in\n   separate Opaque LSAs.  For example, the Port
    Label Restrictions sub-\n   TLV could be nested in separate top-level Link TLVs
    and advertised in\n   the separate LSAs.\n   As with other TE information, an
    implementation typically takes\n   measures to avoid rapid and frequent updates
    of routing information\n   that could cause the routing network to become swamped.
    \ See\n   Section 3 of [RFC3630] for related details.\n"

  - "5.  Scalability and Timeliness\n   This document defines two sub-TLVs for describing
    generic routing\n   constraints.  The examples given in [RFC7579] show that very
    large\n   systems, in terms of label count or ports, can be very efficiently\n
    \  encoded.  However, because there has been concern expressed that some\n   possible
    systems may produce LSAs that exceed the IP Maximum\n   Transmission Unit (MTU),
    methods should be given to allow for the\n   splitting of general constraint LSAs
    into smaller LSAs that are under\n   the MTU limit.  This section presents a set
    of techniques that can be\n   used for this purpose.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Different Sub-TLVs into Multiple LSAs\n   Two sub-TLVs are defined in
      this document:\n   1.  Connectivity Matrix (carried in the Node Attribute TLV)\n
      \  2.  Port Label Restrictions (carried in the Link TLV)\n   The Connectivity
      Matrix sub-TLV can be carried in the Node Attribute\n   TLV (as defined in [RFC5786]),
      whereas the Port Label Restrictions\n   sub-TLV can be carried in a Link TLV,
      of which there can be at most\n   one in an LSA (as defined in [RFC3630]).  Note
      that the port label\n   restrictions are relatively static, i.e., only would
      change with\n   hardware changes or significant system reconfiguration.\n"
    title: 5.1.  Different Sub-TLVs into Multiple LSAs
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Decomposing a Connectivity Matrix into Multiple Matrices\n   In the highly
      unlikely event that a Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV by\n   itself would result
      in an LSA exceeding the MTU, a single large\n   matrix can be decomposed into
      sub-matrices.  Per [RFC7579], a\n   connectivity matrix just consists of pairs
      of input and output ports\n   that can reach each other; hence, this decomposition
      would be\n   straightforward.  Each of these sub-matrices would get a unique\n
      \  matrix identifier per [RFC7579].\n   From the point of view of a path computation
      process, prior to\n   receiving an LSA with a Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV, no
      connectivity\n   restrictions are assumed, i.e., the standard GMPLS assumption
      of any\n   port to any port reachability holds.  Once a Connectivity Matrix
      sub-\n   TLV is received, path computation would know that connectivity is\n
      \  restricted and use the information from all Connectivity Matrix sub-\n   TLVs
      received to understand the complete connectivity potential of\n   the system.
      \ Prior to receiving any Connectivity Matrix sub-TLVs,\n   path computation
      may compute a path through the system when, in fact,\n   no path exists.  In
      between the reception of an additional\n   Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV, path
      computation may not be able to find\n   a path through the system when one actually
      exists.  Both cases are\n   currently encountered and handled with existing
      GMPLS mechanisms.\n   Due to the reliability mechanisms in OSPF, the phenomena
      of late or\n   missing Connectivity Matrix sub-TLVs would be relatively rare.\n
      \  In the case where the new sub-TLVs or their attendant encodings are\n   malformed,
      the proper action would be to log the problem and ignore\n   just the sub-TLVs
      in GMPLS path computations rather than ignoring the\n   entire LSA.\n"

  - "7.  Manageability\n   No existing management tools handle the additional TE parameters
    as\n   defined in this document and distributed in OSPF-TE.  The existing\n   MIB
    module contained in [RFC6825] allows the TE information\n   distributed by OSPF-TE
    to be read from a network node; this MIB\n   module could be augmented (possibly
    by a sparse augmentation) to\n   report this new information.\n   The current
    environment in the IETF favors the Network Configuration\n   Protocol (NETCONF)
    [RFC6241] and YANG [RFC6020] over SNMP and MIB\n   modules.  Work is in progress
    in the TEAS working group to develop a\n   YANG module to represent the generic
    TE information that may be\n   present in a Traffic Engineering Database (TED).
    \ This model may be\n   extended to handle the additional information described
    in this\n   document to allow that information to be read from network devices
    or\n   exchanged between consumers of the TED.  Furthermore, links state\n   export
    using BGP [BGP-LS] enables the export of TE information from a\n   network using
    BGP.  Work could realistically be done to extend BGP-LS\n   to also carry the
    information defined in this document.\n   It is not envisaged that the extensions
    defined in this document will\n   place substantial additional requirements on
    Operations,\n   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms currently used
    to\n   diagnose and debug OSPF systems.  However, tools that examine the\n   contents
    of opaque LSAs will need to be enhanced to handle these new\n   sub-TLVs.\n"
