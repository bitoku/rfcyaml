Abstract This document specifies the initial version of a YANG module "iana  tunnel type", which contains a collection of IANA maintained YANG identities used as interface types for tunnel interfaces.
The module reflects the "tunnelType" registry maintained by IANA.
The latest revision of this YANG module can be obtained from the IANA website.
Tunnel type values are not directly added to the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module; they must instead be added to the "tunnelType" IANA registry.
Once a new tunnel type registration is made by IANA for a new tunneling scheme or even an existing one that is not already listed in the current registry (e.g., LISP, NSH), IANA will update the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module accordingly.
Some of the IETF defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the current IANA registry.
It is not the intent of this document to update the existing IANA registry with a comprehensive list of tunnel technologies.
Registrants must follow the IETF registration procedure for interface types whenever a new tunnel type is needed.
This document specifies the initial version of the iana tunnel type YANG module containing a collection of IANA maintained YANG identities identifying tunnel interface types.
The module reflects IANA's tunnelType registry under the SMI Numbers registry [TUNNELTYPE IANA REGISTRY].
The latest revision of this module can be obtained from the IANA website.
Tunnel specific extensions may be added to the Interface module [RFC8343] as a function of the tunnel type.
An example of this is provided in Appendix A.
It is not the intention of this document to define tunnel specific extensions for every tunnel encapsulation technology; those are discussed in dedicated documents such as [RFC8676].
Likewise, it is out of the scope of this document to update the existing IANA tunnelType registry [TUNNELTYPE IANA REGISTRY] with a comprehensive list of tunnel technologies.
Guidelines and registration procedures for interface types and sub types are discussed in [IFTYPE REG].
This document uses the common YANG types defined in [RFC6991] and adopts the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA [RFC8342]).
The terminology for describing YANG modules is defined in [RFC7950].
The meanings of the symbols used in the tree diagram are defined in [RFC8340].
IANA Tunnel Type YANG Module
The iana tunnel type module imports the 'iana if type' module defined in [RFC7224].
The initial version of the module includes tunnel types defined in [RFC4087], [RFC7856], [RFC7870], and [RFC6346].

The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].
The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].
The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM)
[RFC8341] provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
The module defined in this document defines YANG identities for the iana tunnel types registry.
These identities are intended to be referenced by other YANG modules, and by themselves do not expose any nodes which are writable, contain read only state, or RPCs.
As such, there are no additional security issues to be considered relating to the module defined in this document.
YANG Module IANA has registered the following URI in the "ns" subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:
yang:iana tunnel type Registrant Contact:  IANA XML:
N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.
IANA registered the following YANG module in the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC7950] within the "YANG Parameters" registry.
This document defines the initial version of the IANA maintained iana tunnel type YANG module.
IANA has added this note to the registry: Tunnel type values must not be directly added to the iana tunnel  type YANG module.
They must instead be added to the "tunnelType" subregistry (under the "ifType definitions" registry) at [IANA registry smi numbers].
When a tunnel type is added to the "tunnelType" subregistry, a new "identity" statement must be added to the iana tunnel type YANG module.
The name of the "identity" is the lower case of the corresponding enumeration in the IANAifType MIB (i.e., IANAtunnelType).
Unassigned or reserved values are not present in the module.
When the iana tunnel type YANG module is updated, a new "revision" statement must be added in front of the existing revision statements.
IANA has added the following note to "tunnelType" subregistry: When this registry is modified, the YANG module iana tunnel type must be updated as defined in RFC 8675.
Updates to the IANA tunnelType Table IANA has updated the following entries in the tunnelType registry under the SMI Numbers registry [TUNNELTYPE IANA REGISTRY].
The following example illustrates how the Interface YANG module can be augmented with tunnel specific parameters.
In this example, the module is augmented with a 'remote endpoint' for the tunnel.
A tree structure is provided below: module: example iftunnel extension augment /if
The 'example iftunnel extension' module imports the modules defined in [RFC6991] and [RFC8343] in addition to the "iana tunnel type" module defined in this document.
