- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   [SPPI] describes a structure for specifying policy information\
    \ that\n   can then be transmitted to a network device for the purpose of\n  \
    \ configuring policy at that device.  The model underlying this\n   structure\
    \ is one of well-defined provisioning classes and instances\n   of these classes\
    \ residing in a virtual information store called the\n   Policy Information Base\
    \ (PIB).\n   This document specifies a set of provisioning classes specifically\n\
    \   for configuring QoS Policy for Differentiated Services [DSARCH].\n   One way\
    \ to provision policy is by means of the COPS protocol [COPS],\n   with the extensions\
    \ for provisioning [COPS-PR].  This protocol\n   supports multiple clients, each\
    \ of which may provision policy for a\n   specific policy domain such as QoS.\
    \  The PRCs defined in this\n   DiffServ QoS PIB are intended for use by the COPS-PR\
    \ diffServ client\n   type.  Furthermore, these PRCs are in addition to any other\
    \ PIBs that\n   may be defined for the diffServ client type in the future, as\
    \ well as\n   the PRCs defined in the Framework PIB [FR-PIB].\n"
- title: 3.  Relationship to the DiffServ Informal Management Model
  contents:
  - "3.  Relationship to the DiffServ Informal Management Model\n   This PIB is designed\
    \ according to the Differentiated Services\n   Informal Management Model documented\
    \ in [MODEL].  The model describes\n   the way that ingress and egress interfaces\
    \ of a 'n'-port router are\n   modeled.  It describes the configuration and management\
    \ of a DiffServ\n   interface in terms of a Traffic Conditioning Block (TCB) which\n\
    \   contains, by definition, zero or more classifiers, meters, actions,\n   algorithmic\
    \ droppers, queues and schedulers.  These elements are\n   arranged according\
    \ to the QoS policy being expressed, and are always\n   in that order.  Traffic\
    \ may be classified; classified traffic may be\n   metered; each stream of traffic\
    \ identified by a combination of\n   classifiers and meters may have some set\
    \ of actions performed on it;\n   it may have dropping algorithms applied and\
    \ it may ultimately be\n   stored into a queue before being scheduled out to its\
    \ next\n   destination, either onto a link or to another TCB.  When the\n   treatment\
    \ for a given packet must have any of those elements repeated\n   in a way that\
    \ breaks the permitted sequence {classifier, meter,\n   action, algorithmic dropper,\
    \ queue, scheduler}, this must be modeled\n   by cascading multiple TCBs.\n  \
    \ The PIB represents this cascade by following the \"Next\" attributes of\n  \
    \ the various elements.  They indicate what the next step in DiffServ\n   processing\
    \ will be, whether it be a classifier, meter, action,\n   algorithmic dropper,\
    \ queue, scheduler or a decision to now forward a\n   packet.\n   The PIB models\
    \ the individual elements that make up the TCBs.  The\n   higher level concept\
    \ of a TCB is not required in the parameterization\n   or in the linking together\
    \ of the individual elements, hence it is\n   not used in the PIB itself and is\
    \ only mentioned in the text for\n   relating the PIB with the [MODEL].  The actual\
    \ distinguishing of\n   which TCB a specific element is a part of is not needed\
    \ for the\n   instrumentation of a device to support the functionalities of\n\
    \   DiffServ, but it is useful for conceptual reasons.  By not using the\n   TCB\
    \ concept, this PIB allows any grouping of elements to construct\n   TCBs, using\
    \ rules indicated by the [MODEL].  This will minimize\n   changes to this PIB\
    \ if rules in [MODEL] change.\n   The notion of a Data Path is used in this PIB\
    \ to indicate the\n   DiffServ processing a packet may experience.  This Data\
    \ Path is\n   distinguished based on the Role Combination, Capability Set, and\
    \ the\n   Direction of the flow the packet is part of.  A Data Path Table Entry\n\
    \   indicates the first of possibly multiple elements that will apply\n   DiffServ\
    \ treatment to the packet.\n"
- title: 3.1.  PIB Overview
  contents:
  - "3.1.  PIB Overview\n   This PIB is structured based on the need to configure\
    \ the sequential\n   DiffServ treatments being applied to a packet, and the\n\
    \   parameterization of these treatments.  These two aspects of the\n   configuration\
    \ are kept separate throughout the design of the PIB, and\n   are fulfilled using\
    \ separate tables and data definitions.\n   In addition, the PIB includes tables\
    \ describing the capabilities and\n   limitations of the device using a general\
    \ extensible framework.\n   These tables are reported to the PDP and assist the\
    \ PDP with the\n   configuration of functional elements that can be realized by\
    \ the\n   device.\n   This capabilities and limitations exchange allows a single\
    \ or\n   multiple devices to support many different variations of a functional\n\
    \   datapath element.  Allowing diverse methods of providing a general\n   functional\
    \ datapath element.\n   In this PIB, the ingress and egress portions of a router\
    \ are\n   configured independently but in the same manner.  The difference is\n\
    \   distinguished by an attribute in a table describing the start of the\n   data\
    \ path.  Each interface performs some or all of the following\n   high-level functions:\n\
    \   - Classify each packet according to some set of rules.\n   - Determine whether\
    \ the data stream the packet is part of is within\n     or outside its metering\
    \ parameters.\n   - Perform a set of resulting actions such as counting and marking\
    \ of\n     the traffic with a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) as\n \
    \    defined in [DSFIELD].\n   - Apply the appropriate drop policy, either simple\
    \ or complex\n     algorithmic drop functionality.\n   - Enqueue the traffic for\
    \ output in the appropriate queue, whose\n     scheduler may shape the traffic\
    \ or simply forward it with some\n     minimum rate or maximum latency.\n   The\
    \ PIB therefore contains the following elements:\n   Data Path Table\n      This\
    \ describes the starting point of DiffServ data paths within a\n      single DiffServ\
    \ device.  This class describes interface role\n      combination and interface\
    \ direction specific data paths.\n   Classifier Tables\n      A general extensible\
    \ framework for specifying a group of filters.\n   Meter Tables\n      A general\
    \ extensible framework and one example of a\n      parameterization table - TBParam\
    \ table, applicable for Simple\n      Token Bucket Meter, Average Rate Meter,\
    \ Single Rate Three Color\n      Meter, Two Rate Three Color Meter, and Sliding\
    \ Window Three Color\n      Meter.\n   Action Tables\n      A general extensible\
    \ framework and example of parameterization\n      tables for Mark action.  The\
    \ \"multiplexer\" and \"null\" actions\n      described in [MODEL] are accomplished\
    \ implicitly by means of the\n      Prid structures of the other elements.\n \
    \  Algorithmic Dropper Tables\n      A general extensible framework for describing\
    \ the dropper\n      functional datapath element.  This includes the absolute\
    \ dropper\n      and other queue measurement dependent algorithmic droppers.\n\
    \   Queue and Scheduler Tables\n      A general extensible framework for parameterizing\
    \ queuing and\n      scheduler systems.  Notice Shaper is considered as a type\
    \ of\n      scheduler and is included here.\n   Capabilities Tables\n      A general\

- title: 4.1.  General Conventions
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Conventions\n   The PIB consists of PRCs that represent functional\
    \ elements in the\n   data path (e.g., classifiers, meters, actions), and classes\
    \ that\n   specify parameters that apply to a certain type of functional element\n\
    \   (e.g., a Token Bucket meter or a Mark action).  Parameters are\n   typically\
    \ specified in a separate PRC to enable the use of parameter\n   classes by multiple\
    \ policies.\n   Functional element PRCs use the Prid TC (defined in [SPPI]) to\n\
    \   indicate indirection.  A Prid is an object identifier that is used to\n  \
    \ specify an instance of a PRC in another table.  A Prid is used to\n   point\
    \ to parameter PRC that applies to a functional element, such as\n   which filter\
    \ should be used for a classifier element.  A Prid is also\n   used to specify\
    \ an instance of a functional element PRC that\n   describes what treatment should\
    \ be applied next for a packet in the\n   data path.\n   Note that the use of\
    \ Prids to specify parameter PRCs allows the same\n   functional element PRC to\
    \ be extended with a number of different\n   types of parameter PRC's.  In addition,\
    \ using Prids to indicate the\n   next functional datapath element allows the\
    \ elements to be ordered in\n   any way.\n"

    \  Please\n   refer to [MODEL] for discussions on the valid sequencing and grouping\n\
    \   of DiffServ Functional Elements.  Given some basic information, e.g.,\n  \
    \ the interface capability, role combination and direction, the first\n   DiffServ\
    \ Functional Element is determined.  Subsequent DiffServ\n   Functional Elements\
    \ are provided by the \"Next\" pointer attribute of\n   each entry of data path\
    \ tables.  A description of how this \"Next\"\n   pointer is used in each table\
    \ is provided in their respective\n   DESCRIPTION clauses.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Data Path PRC
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Data Path PRC\n   The Data Path PRC provides the DiffServ treatment starting\
    \ points for\n   all packets of this DiffServ device.  Each instance of this PRC\n\
    \   specifies the interface capability, role combination and direction\n   for\
    \ the packet flow.  There should be at most two entries for each\n   instance\
    \ (interface type, role combination, interface capability),\n   one for ingress\
    \ and one for egress.  Each instance provides the first\n   DiffServ Functional\
    \ Element that each packet, at a specific interface\n   (identified by the roles\
    \ assigned to the interface) traveling in a\n   specific relative direction, should\
    \ experience.  Notice this class is\n   interface specific, with the use of interface\
    \ type capability set and\n   RoleCombination.  To indicate explicitly that there\
    \ are no DiffServ\n   treatments for a particular interface type capability set,\
    \ role\n   combination and direction, an instance of the Data Path PRC can be\n\
    \   created with zeroDotZero in the dsDataPathStart attribute.  This\n   situation\
    \ can also be indicated implicitly by not supplying an\n   instance of a Data\
    \ Path PRC for that particular interface type\n   capability set, role combination\
    \ and direction.  The\n   explicit/implicit selection is up to the implementation.\
    \  This means\n   that the PEP should perform normal IP device processing when\n\
    \   zeroDotZero is used in the dsDataPathStart attribute, or when the\n   entry\
    \ does not exist.  Normal IP device processing will depend on the\n   device;\
    \ for example, this can be forwarding the packet.\n   Based on implementation\
    \ experience of network devices where data path\n   functional elements are implemented\
    \ in separate physical processors\n   or application specific integrated circuits,\
    \ separated by switch\n   fabric, it seems that more complex notions of data path\
    \ are required\n   within the network device to correlate the different physically\n\
    \   separate data path functional elements.  For example, ingress\n   processing\
    \ may have determined a specific ingress flow that gets\n   aggregated with other\
    \ ingress flows at an egress data path functional\n   element.  Some of the information\
    \ determined at the ingress data path\n   functional element may need to be used\
    \ by the egress data path\n   functional element.  In numerous implementations,\
    \ such information\n   has been carried by adding it to the frame/memory block\
    \ used to carry\n   the flow within the network device; some implementers have\
    \ called\n   such information a \"preamble\" or a \"frame descriptor\".  Different\n\
    \   implementations use different formats for such information.\n   Initially,\
    \ one may think such information has implementation details\n   within the network\
    \ device that does not need to be exposed outside of\n   the network device. \
    \ But from Policy Control point of view, such\n   information will be very useful\
    \ in determining network resource usage\n   feedback from the network device to\
    \ the policy server.  This is\n   accomplished by using the Internal Label Marker\
    \ and Filter PRCs\n   defined in [FR-PIB].\n"
- title: 4.3.  Classifiers
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Classifiers\n   The classifier and classifier element tables determine\
    \ how traffic is\n   sorted out.  They identify separable classes of traffic,\
    \ by reference\n   to appropriate filters, which may select anything from an individual\n\
    \   micro-flow to aggregates identified by DSCP.\n   The classification is used\
    \ to send these separate streams to\n   appropriate Meter, Action, Algorithmic\
    \ Dropper, Queue and Scheduler\n   elements.  For example, to indicate a multi-stage\
    \ meter, sub-classes\n   of traffic may be sent to different meter stages: e.g.,\
    \ in an\n   implementation of the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB [AF-PHB], AF11\n\
    \   traffic might be sent to the first meter, AF12 traffic might be sent\n   to\
    \ the second and AF13 traffic sent to the second meter stage's out-\n   of-profile\
    \ action.\n   The concept of a classifier is the same as described in [MODEL].\
    \  The\n   structure of the classifier and classifier element tables, is the\n\
    \   same as the classifier described in [MODEL].  Classifier elements\n   have\
    \ an associated precedence order solely for the purpose of\n   resolving ambiguity\
    \ between overlapping filters.  A filter with\n   higher values of precedence\
    \ are compared first; the order of tests\n   for entries of the same precedence\
    \ is unimportant.\n   A datapath may consist of more than one classifier.  There\
    \ may be an\n   overlap of filter specification between filters of different\n\
    \   classifiers.  The first classifier functional datapath element\n   encountered,\
    \ as determined by the sequencing of diffserv functional\n   datapath elements,\
    \ will be used first.\n   An important form of classifier is \"everything else\"\
    : the final stage\n   of the classifier i.e., the one with the lowest precedence,\
    \ must be\n   \"complete\" since the result of an incomplete classifier is not\n\
    \   necessarily deterministic - see [MODEL] section 4.1.2.\n   When a classifier\
    \ PRC is instantiated at the PEP, it should always\n   have at least one classifier\
    \ element table entry, the \"everything\n   else\" classifier element, with its\
    \ filter matching all IP packets.\n   This \"everything else\" classifier element\
    \ should be created by the\n   PDP as part of the classifier setup.  The PDP has\
    \ full control of all\n   classifier PRIs instantiated at the PEP.\n   The definition\
    \ of the actual filter to be used by the classifier is\n   referenced via a Prid:\
    \ this enables the use of any sort of filter\n   table that one might wish to\
    \ design, standard or proprietary.  No\n   filters are defined in this PIB.  However,\
    \ standard filters for IP\n   packets are defined in the Framework PIB [FR-PIB].\n"

- title: 4.4.  Meters
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Meters\n   A meter, according to [MODEL] section 5, measures the rate at\
    \ which\n   packets composing a stream of traffic pass it, compares this rate\
    \ to\n   some set of thresholds, and produces some number (two or more) of\n \
    \  potential results.  A given packet is said to \"conform\" to the meter\n  \
    \ if, at the time the packet is being looked at, the stream appears to\n   be\
    \ within the meter's profile.  PIB syntax makes it easiest to define\n   this\
    \ as a sequence of one or more cascaded pass/fail tests, modeled\n   here as if-then-else\
    \ constructs.  It is important to understand that\n   this way of modeling does\
    \ not imply anything about the implementation\n   being \"sequential\": multi-rate/multi-profile\
    \ meters, e.g., those\n   designed to support [SRTCM], [TRTCM], or [TSWTCM] can\
    \ still be\n   modeled this way even if they, of necessity, share information\n\
    \   between the stages: the stages are introduced merely as a notational\n   convenience\
    \ in order to simplify the PIB structure.\n"

    \ dsActionTable to organize one Action's\n   relationship with the element(s)\
    \ before and after it.  It allows\n   Actions to be cascaded to enable that multiple\
    \ Actions be applied to\n   a single traffic stream by using each entry's dsActionNext\
    \ attribute.\n   The dsActionNext attribute of the last action entry in the chain\n\
    \   points to the next element in the TCB, if any, e.g., a Queueing\n   element.\
    \  It may also point at a next TCB.\n   The parameters needed for the Action element\
    \ will depend on the type\n   of Action to be taken.  Hence the PIB allows for\
    \ specific Action\n   Tables for the different Action types.  This flexibility\
    \ allows\n   additional Actions to be specified in other PIBs and also allows\
    \ for\n   the use of proprietary Actions without impact on those defined here.\n\

  - "4.6.1.  Algorithmic Dropper PRC\n   Algorithmic Droppers are represented in this\
    \ PIB by instances of the\n   Algorithmic Dropper PRC.  An Algorithmic Dropper\
    \ is assumed to\n   operate indiscriminately on all packets that are presented\
    \ at its\n   input; all traffic separation should be done by classifiers and\n\
    \   meters preceding it.\n   Algorithmic Dropper includes many types of droppers,\
    \ from the simple\n   always dropper to the more complex random dropper.  This\
    \ is indicated\n   by the dsAlgDropType attribute.\n   Algorithmic Droppers have\
    \ a close relationship with queuing; each\n   Algorithmic Dropper Table entry\
    \ contains a dsAlgDropQMeasure\n   attribute, indicating which queue's state affects\
    \ the calculation of\n   the Algorithmic Dropper.  Each entry also contains a\
    \ dsAlgDropNext\n   attribute that indicates to which queue the Algorithmic Dropper\
    \ sinks\n   its traffic.\n   Algorithmic Droppers may also contain a pointer to\
    \ a specific detail\n   of the drop algorithm, dsAlgDropSpecific.  This PIB defines\
    \ the\n   detail for three drop algorithms:  Tail Drop, Head Drop, and Random\n\
    \   Drop; other algorithms are outside the scope of this PIB module, but\n   the\
    \ general framework is intended to allow for their inclusion via\n   other PIB\
    \ modules.\n   One generally-applicable parameter of a dropper is the specification\n\
    \   of a queue-depth threshold at which some drop action is to start.\n   This\
    \ is represented in this PIB, as a base attribute,\n   dsAlgDropQThreshold, of\
    \ the Algorithmic Dropper entry.  The\n   attribute, dsAlgDropQMeasure, specifies\
    \ which queue's depth\n   dsAlgDropQThreshold is to be compared against.\n   o\
    \  An Always Dropper drops every packet presented to it.  This type\n      of\
    \ dropper does not require any other parameter.\n   o  A Tail Dropper requires\
    \ the specification of a maximum queue depth\n      threshold:  when the queue\
    \ pointed at by dsAlgDropQMeasure reaches\n      that depth threshold, dsAlgDropQThreshold,\
    \ any new traffic\n      arriving at the dropper is discarded.  This algorithm\
    \ uses only\n      parameters that are part of the dsAlgDropEntry.\n   o  A Head\
    \ Dropper requires the specification of a maximum queue depth\n      threshold:\
    \  when the queue pointed at by dsAlgDropQMeasure reaches\n      that depth threshold,\
    \ dsAlgDropQThreshold, traffic currently at\n      the head of the queue is discarded.\
    \  This algorithm uses only\n      parameters that are part of the dsAlgDropEntry.\n\
    \   o  Random Droppers are recommended as a way to control congestion, in\n  \
    \    [QUEUEMGMT] and called for in the [AF-PHB].  Various\n      implementations\

    \ with TCP-like protocols about\n      congestion avoidance, but differ markedly\
    \ on their specific\n      parameters.  This PIB attempts to offer a minimal set\
    \ of controls\n      for any random dropper, but expects that vendors will augment\
    \ the\n      PRC with additional controls and status in accordance with their\n\
    \      implementation.  This algorithm requires additional parameters on\n   \
    \   top of those in dsAlgDropEntry; these are discussed below.\n   A Dropper Type\
    \ of other is provided for the implementation of dropper\n   types not defined\
    \ here.  When the Dropper Type is other, its full\n   specification will need\

  contents:
  - "4.6.2.  Random Dropper PRC\n   One example of a random dropper is a RED-like\
    \ dropper.  An example of\n   the representation chosen in this PIB for this element\
    \ is shown in\n   Figure 1.\n   Random droppers often have their drop probability\
    \ function described\n   as a plot of drop probability (P) against averaged queue\
    \ length (Q).\n   (Qmin, Pmin) then defines the start of the characteristic plot.\n\
    \   Normally Pmin=0, meaning that with average queue length below Qmin,\n   there\
    \ will be no drops.  (Qmax, Pmax) defines a \"knee\" on the plot,\n   after which\
    \ point the drop probability become more progressive\n   (greater slope).  (Qclip,\
    \ 1) defines the queue length at which all\n   packets will be dropped.  Notice\
    \ this is different from Tail Drop\n   because this uses an averaged queue length.\
    \  Although it is possible\n   for Qclip = Qmax.\n   In the PIB module, dsRandomDropMinThreshBytes\
    \ and\n   dsRandomDropMinThreshPkts represent Qmin.  dsRandomDropMaxThreshBytes\n\
    \   and dsRandomDropMaxThreshPkts represent Qmax.  dsAlgDropQThreshold\n   represents\
    \ Qclip.  dsRandomDropProbMax represents Pmax.  This PIB\n   does not represent\
    \ Pmin (assumed to be zero unless otherwise\n   represented).\n   In addition,\
    \ since message memory is finite, queues generally have\n   some upper bound above\
    \ which they are incapable of storing additional\n   traffic.  Normally this number\
    \ is equal to Qclip, specified by\n   dsAlgDropQThreshold.\n   Each random dropper\
    \ specification is associated with a queue.  This\n   allows multiple drop processes\
    \ (of same or different types) to be\n   associated with the same queue, as different\

- title: 4.6.3.  Queues and Schedulers
  contents:
  - "4.6.3.  Queues and Schedulers\n   The Queue PRC models simple FIFO queues, as\
    \ described in [MODEL]\n   section 7.1.1.  The Scheduler PRC allows flexibility\
    \ in constructing\n   both simple and somewhat more complex queueing hierarchies\
    \ from those\n   queues.  Of course, since TCBs can be cascaded multiple times\
    \ on an\n   interface, even more complex hierarchies can be constructed that way\n\
    \   also.\n   Queue PRC instances are pointed at by the \"next\" attributes of\
    \ the\n   upstream elements e.g., dsMeterSucceedNext.  Note that multiple\n  \
    \ upstream elements may direct their traffic to the same Queue PRI.\n   For example,\
    \ the Assured Forwarding PHB suggests that all traffic\n   marked AF11, AF12,\
    \ or AF13 be placed in the same queue after\n   metering, without reordering.\
    \  This would be represented by having\n   the dsMeterSucceedNext of each upstream\
    \ meter point at the same Queue\n   PRI.\n   NOTE:  Queue and Scheduler PRIs are\
    \ for data path description; they\n   both use Scheduler Parameterization Table\
    \ entries for diffserv\n   treatment parameterization.\n   A Queue Table entry\
    \ specifies the scheduler it wants service from by\n   use of its Next pointer.\n\
    \   Each Scheduler Table entry represents the algorithm in use for\n   servicing\
    \ the one or more queues that feed it.  [MODEL] section 7.1.2\n   describes a\
    \ scheduler with multiple inputs:  this is represented in\n   the PIB by having\
    \ the scheduling parameters be associated with each\n   input.  In this way, sets\
    \ of Queues can be grouped together as inputs\n   to the same Scheduler.  This\
    \ class serves to represent the example\n   scheduler described in the [MODEL]:\
    \  other more complex\n   representations might be created outside of this PIB.\n\
    \   Both the Queue PRC and the Scheduler PRC use instances of the\n   Scheduler\
    \ Parameterization PRC to specify diffserv treatment\n   parameterization.  Scheduler\
    \ Parameter PRC instances are used to\n   parameterize each input that feeds into\
    \ a scheduler.  The inputs can\n   be a mixture of Queue PRI's and Scheduler PRI's.\
    \  Scheduler Parameter\n   PRI's can be used/reused by one or more Queue and/or\
    \ Scheduler Table\n   entries.\n   For representing a Strict Priority scheduler,\
    \ each scheduler input is\n   assigned a priority with respect to all the other\
    \ inputs feeding the\n   same scheduler, with default values for the other parameters.\
    \  A\n   higher-priority input which contains traffic that is not being\n   delayed\
    \ for shaping will be serviced before a lower-priority input.\n   For Weighted\
    \ Scheduling methods e.g., WFQ, WRR, the \"weight\" of a\n   given scheduler input\
    \ is represented with a Minimum Service Rate\n   leaky-bucket profile that provides\
    \ a guaranteed minimum bandwidth to\n   that input, if required.  This is represented\
    \ by a rate\n   dsMinRateAbsolute; the classical weight is the ratio between that\n\
    \   rate and the interface speed, or perhaps the ratio between that rate\n   and\
    \ the sum of the configured rates for classes.  Alternatively, the\n   rate may\
    \ be represented by a relative value, as a fraction of the\n   interface's current\
    \ line rate, dsMinRateRelative to assist in cases\n   where line rates are variable\
    \ or where a higher-level policy might be\n   expressed in terms of fractions\
    \ of network resources.  The two rate\n   parameters are inter-related and changes\
    \ in one may be reflected in\n   the other.\n   For weighted scheduling methods,\
    \ one can say loosely, that WRR\n   focuses on meeting bandwidth sharing, without\
    \ concern for relative\n   delay amongst the queues, where WFQ control both queue\
    \ service order\n   and amount of traffic serviced, providing meeting bandwidth\
    \ sharing\n   and relative delay ordering amongst the queues.\n   A queue or scheduled\
    \ set of queues (which is an input to a scheduler)\n   may also be capable of\
    \ acting as a non-work-conserving [MODEL]\n   traffic shaper:  this is done by\
    \ defining a Maximum Service Rate\n   leaky-bucket profile in order to limit the\
    \ scheduler bandwidth\n   available to that input.  This is represented by a rate\n\
    \   dsMaxRateAbsolute; the classical weight is the ratio between that\n   rate\
    \ and the interface speed, or perhaps the ratio between that rate\n   and the\
    \ sum of the configured rates for classes.  Alternatively, the\n   rate may, be\
    \ represented by a relative value, as a fraction of the\n   interface's current\
    \ line rate, dsMaxRateRelative.  There was\n   discussion in the working group\
    \ about alternative modeling\n   approaches, such as defining a shaping action\
    \ or a shaping element.\n   We did not take this approach because shaping is in\
    \ fact something a\n   scheduler does to its inputs, (which we model as a queue\
    \ with a\n   maximum rate or a scheduler whose output has a maximum rate) and\
    \ we\n   felt it was simpler and more elegant to simply describe it in that\n\
    \   context.  Additionally, multi-rate shaper [SHAPER] can be represented\n  \
    \ by the use of multiple dsMaxRateTable entries.\n   Other types of priority and\
    \ weighted scheduling methods can be\n   defined using existing parameters in\
    \ dsMinRateEntry.  NOTE:\n   dsSchedulerMethod uses AutonomousType syntax, with\
    \ the different\n   types of scheduling methods defined as OBJECT-IDENTITY.  Future\n\
    \   scheduling methods may be defined in other PIBs.  This requires an\n   OBJECT-IDENTITY\
    \ definition, a description of how the existing objects\n   are reused, if they\
    \ are, and any new objects they require.\n   NOTE:  Hierarchical schedulers can\
    \ be parameterized using this PIB by\n   having Scheduler Table entries feeds\
    \ into Scheduler Table entry.\n"

    \ Queue Random Dropper Usage Example\n   For this example, we have two queues,\
    \ Q_AF1 and Q_AF2, sharing the\n   same buffer resources.  We want to make sure\
    \ the common buffer\n   resource is sufficient to service the AF11 traffic, and\
    \ we want to\n   measure the two queues for determining the drop algorithm for\
    \ AF11\n   traffic feeding into Q_AF1.  Notice mQDrop is used for dsAlgDropType\n\
    \   of dsAlgDropEntry to indicate Multiple Queue Dropping Algorithm.\n   The common\
    \ shared buffer resource is indicated by the use of\n   dsAlgDropEntry, with their\
    \ attributes used as follows:\n   - dsAlgDropType indicates the algorithm used,\
    \ mQDrop.\n   - dsAlgDropNext is used to indicate the next functional data path\n\
    \     element to handle the flow when no drop occurs.\n   - dsAlgDropQMeasure\
    \ is used as the anchor for the list of\n     dsMQAlgDropEntry, one for each queue\
    \ being measured.\n   - dsAlgDropQThreshold is used to indicate the size of the\
    \ shared\n     buffer pool.\n   - dsAlgDropSpecific can be used to reference instances\
    \ of additional\n     PRC (not defined in this PIB) if more parameters are required\
    \ to\n     describe the common shared buffer resource.\n   For this example, there\
    \ are two subsequent dsMQAlgDropEntrys, one for\n   each queue being measured,\
    \ with its attributes used as follows:\n   - dsMQAlgDropType indicates the algorithm\
    \ used, for this example,\n     both dsMQAlgDropType uses randomDrop.\n   - dsMQAlgDropQMeasure\
    \ indicates the queue being measured.\n   - dsMQAlgDropNext indicates the next\
    \ functional data path element\n     to handle the flow when no drop occurs.\n\
    \   - dsMQAlgDropExceedNext is used to indicate the next queue's\n     dsMQAlgDropEntry.\
    \  With the use of zeroDotZero to indicate the\n     last queue.\n   - dsMQAlgDropQMeasure\
    \ is used to indicate the queue being measured.\n     For this example, Q_AF1\
    \ and Q_AF2 are the two queues used.\n   - dsAlgDropQThreshold is used as in single\
    \ queue Random Dropper.\n   - dsAlgDropSpecific is used to reference the PRID\
    \ that describes\n     the dropper parameters as in its normal usage.  For this\
    \ example\n     both dsAlgDropSpecifics reference dsRandomDropEntrys.\n   Notice\
    \ the anchoring dsAlgDropEntry and the two dsMQAlgDropEntrys\n   all have their\
    \ Next attribute pointing to Q_AF1.  This indicates:\n   - If the packet does\
    \ not need to be checked with the individual\n     queue's drop processing because\
    \ of abundance of common shared\n     buffer resources, then the packet is sent\
    \ to Q_AF1.\n   - If the packet is not dropped due to current Q_AF1 conditions,\
    \ then\n     it is sent to Q_AF1.\n   - If the packet is not dropped due to current\
    \ Q_AF2 conditions, then\n     it is sent to Q_AF1.\n   This example also uses\
    \ two dsRandomDropEntrys for the two queues it\n   measures.  Their attribute\
    \ usage is the same as if for single queue\n   random dropper.\n   Other more\
    \ complex result combinations can be achieved by specifying\n   a new PRC and\
    \ referencing this new PRC with the dsAlgDropSpecific of\n   the anchoring dsAlgDropEntry.\
    \  A more simple usage can also be\n   achieved when a single set of drop parameters\
    \ are used for all queues\n   being measured.  This, again, can be referenced\
    \ by the anchoring of\n   dsAlgDropSpecific.  These are not defined in this PIB.\n"

    \   This example shows the queuing system for handling EF, AF1, AF2, and\n   AF3\
    \ traffic.  It is assumed that AF11, AF12, and AF13 traffic feeds\n   into Queue\
    \ AF1.  And likewise for AF2x and AF3x traffic.\n   The AF1, AF2, and AF3 Queues\
    \ are serviced by the AF Scheduler using a\n   Weighed Round Robin method.  The\
    \ AF Scheduler will service each of\n   the queues feeding into it based on the\
    \ minimum rate parameters of\n   each queue.\n   The AF and EF traffic are serviced\
    \ by the DiffServ Scheduler using a\n   Strict Priority method.  The DiffServ\
    \ Scheduler will service each of\n   its inputs based on their priority parameter.\n\
    \   Notice there is an upper bound to the servicing of EF traffic by the\n   DiffServ\
    \ Scheduler.  This is accomplished with the use of maximum\n   rate parameters.\
    \  The DiffServ Scheduler uses both the maximum rate\n   and priority parameters\
    \ when servicing the EF Queue.\n   The DiffServ Scheduler is the last DiffServ\
    \ datapath functional\n   element in this datapath.  It uses zeroDotZero in its\
    \ Next attribute.\n"

  - "6.  Summary of the DiffServ PIB\n   The DiffServ PIB consists of one module containing\
    \ the base PRCs for\n   setting DiffServ policy, queues, classifiers, meters,\
    \ etc., and also\n   contains capability PRC's that allow a PEP to specify its\
    \ device\n   characteristics to the PDP.  This module contains two groups that\
    \ are\n   summarized in this section.\n   DiffServ Capabilities Group\n      This\
    \ group consists of PRCs to indicate to the PDP the types of\n      interface\
    \ supported on the PEP in terms of their DiffServ\n      capabilities and PRCs\
    \ that the PDP can install in order to\n      configure these interfaces (queues,\
    \ scheduling parameters, buffer\n      sizes, etc.) to affect the desired policy.\
    \  This group describes\n      capabilities in terms of the types of interfaces\
    \ and takes\n      configuration in terms of interface types and role combinations\n\
    \      [FR-PIB]; it does not deal with individual interfaces on the\n      device.\n\
    \   DiffServ Policy Group\n      This group contains configurations of the functional\
    \ elements that\n      comprise the DiffServ policy that applies to an interface\
    \ and the\n      specific parameters that describe those elements.  This group\n\
    \      contains classifiers, meters, actions, droppers, queues and\n      schedulers.\
    \  This group also contains the PRC that associates the\n      datapath elements\
    \ with role combinations.\n"
- title: 7.  PIB Operational Overview
  contents:
  - "7.  PIB Operational Overview\n   This section provides an operational overview\
    \ of configuring DiffServ\n   QoS policy.\n   After the initial PEP to PDP communication\
    \ setup, using [COPS-PR] for\n   example, the PEP will provide to the PDP the\
    \ PIB Provisioning classes\n   (PRCs), interface types, and interface type capabilities\
    \ it supports.\n   The PRCs supported by the PEP are reported to the PDP in the\
    \ PRC\n   Support Table, frwkPrcSupportTable, defined in the framework PIB\n \
    \  [FR-PIB].  Each instance of the frwkPrcSupportTable indicates a PRC\n   that\
    \ the PEP understands and for which the PDP can send class\n   instances as part\
    \ of the policy information.\n   The capabilities of interface types the PEP supports\
    \ are described by\n   rows in the capability set table, frwkCapabilitySetTable.\
    \  Each row,\n   or instance of this class contains a pointer to an instance of\
    \ a PRC\n   that describes the capabilities of the interface type.  The\n   capability\
    \ objects may reside in the dsIfClassifierCapsTable, the\n   dsIfMeteringCapsTable,\
    \ the dsIfSchedulerCapsTable, the\n   dsIfElmDepthCapsTable, the dsIfElmLinkCapsTable,\
    \ or in a table\n   defined in another PIB.\n   The PDP, with knowledge of the\
    \ PEP's capabilities, then provides the\n   PEP with administrative domain and\
    \ interface-type-specific policy\n   information.\n   Instances of the dsDataPathTable\
    \ are used to specify the first\n   element in the set of functional elements\
    \ applied to an interface\n   type.  Each instance of the dsDataPathTable applies\
    \ to an interface\n   type defined by its roles and direction (ingress or egress).\n"

    \       that describes the algorithm.  For this\n       algorithm, dsAlgQThreshold\
    \ is understood to be\n       the absolute maximum size of the queue and additional\n\
    \       parameters are described in dsRandomDropTable.\n       The alwaysDrop(5)\

    \ be all set to zeroDotZero.\n       The mQDrop(6) algorithm measures multiple\

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   The information contained in a PIB when transported\
    \ by the COPS\n   protocol [COPS-PR] may be sensitive, and its function of provisioning\n\
    \   a PEP requires that only authorized communication take place.\n   In this\
    \ PIB, there are no PRCs which are sensitive in their own\n   right, such as passwords\
    \ or monetary amounts.  But there are a number\n   of PRCs in this PIB that may\
    \ contain information that may be\n   sensitive from a business perspective, in\
    \ that they may represent a\n   customer's service contract or the filters that\
    \ the service provider\n   chooses to apply to a customer's traffic.  These PRCs\
    \ have a PIB-\n   ACCESS clause of install:\n   dsDataPathTable, dsClfrTable,\
    \ dsClfrElementTable, dsMeterTable,\n   dsTBParamTable, dsActionTable, dsDscpMarkActTable,\
    \ dsAlgDropTable,\n   dsMQAlgDropTable, dsRandomDropTable, dsQTable, dsSchedulerTable,\n\
    \   dsMinRateTable, dsMaxRateTable\n   Malicious altering of the above PRCs may\
    \ affect the DiffServ behavior\n   of the device being provisioned.\n   Malicious\
    \ access of the above PRCs exposes policy information\n   concerning how the device\
    \ is provisioned.\n   This PIB also contain PRCs with PIB-ACCESS clause of notify:\n\
    \   dsBaseIfCapsTAble, dsIfClassificationCapsTable,\n   dsIfMeteringCapsTable,\
    \ dsIfAlgDropCapsTable, dsIfQueueCapsTable,\n   dsIfSchedulerCapsTable, dsIfMaxRateCapsTable,\
    \ dsIfElmDepthCapsTable,\n   dsIfElmLinkCapsTable\n   Malicious access of the\
    \ above PRCs exposes information concerning the\n   device being provisioned.\n\
    \   The use of IPSEC between PDP and PEP, as described in [COPS],\n   provides\
    \ the necessary protection.\n"

    \ for SUBJECT-CATEGORIES follow the same requirements as\n   specified in [COPS]\
    \ IANA Considerations for COPS Client Types.  The\n   DiffServ QoS PIB defines\
    \ a new COPS Client Type in the Standards\n   space.  The IANA has assigned a\
    \ COPS client type diffServ (2) as\n   described in [COPS] IANA Considerations.\
