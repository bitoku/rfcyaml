- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Because Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) transmits data in frames\n\
    \   of bytes, it is fairly easy to envision ways to compress SONET frames\n  \
    \ to yield higher bandwidth over a given fiber optic link.  This memo\n   describes\
    \ a particular method, SONET Over Novel English Translation\n   (SONNET).\n"
- title: Protocol Overview
  contents:
  - "Protocol Overview\n   In brief, SONNET is a method for compressing 810-byte (9\
    \ lines by 90\n   bytes) SONET OC-1 frames into approximately 400-byte (fourteen\
    \ line\n   decasyllabic) English sonnets.  This compression scheme yields a\n\
    \   roughly 50% average compression, and thus SONNET compression speeds\n   are\
    \ designated OCh-#, where 'h' indicates 50% (one half) compression\n   and the\
    \ # is the speed of the uncompressed link.  The acronym is\n   pronounced \"owch.\"\
    \n   Mapping of the 2**704 possible SONET payloads is achieved by matching\n \
    \  each possible payload pattern with its equivalent Cerf catalog number\n   (see\
    \ [1], which lists a vast number of sonnets in English, many of\n   which are\
    \ truly terrible but suffice for the purposes of this memo).\n"
- title: Basic Transmission Rules
  contents:
  - "Basic Transmission Rules\n   The basic transmission rules are quite simple. \
    \ The basic SONET OC-1\n   frame is replaced with the corresponding sonnet at\
    \ the transmission\n   end converted back from the sonnet to SONET at the receiving\
    \ end.\n   Thus, for example, SONET frame 12 is transmitted as:\n        When\
    \ do I count the clock that tells the time\n        And see the brave day sunk\
    \ in hideous night;\n        When I behold the violet past prime,\n        And\
    \ sable curls,...\n   For rates higher than OC-1, the OC-1 frames may either come\n\
    \   interleaved or concatenated into larger frames.  Under SONNET\n   conversion\
    \ rules, interleaved frames have their corresponding sonnet\n   representations\
    \ interleaved.  Thus SONET frames 33, 29 and 138 in an\n   OC-3 frame would be\
    \ converted to the sequence:\n        Full many a glorious morning have I seen\n\
    \        When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\n        When my loves\
    \ swears that she is made of truth\n        Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign\
    \ eye\n        I all alone beweep my outcast state,\n        I do believe her,\
    \ though I know she lies\n        Kissing with golden face...\n   while in an\
    \ OC-3c frame, the individual OC-1 frames concatenated, one\n   after another,\
    \ viz.:\n        Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain-\n\
    \        tops with sovereign eye Kissing with golden face...\n        When, in\
    \ disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone\n        beweep my outcast\
    \ state,...\n        When my loves swears that she is made of truth I do believe\
    \ her,\n        though I know she lies...\n   (This example, perhaps, makes clear\
    \ why data communications experts\n   consider concatenated SONET more efficient\
    \ and esthetically\n   pleasing).\n"
- title: Timing Issues
  contents:
  - "Timing Issues\n   It is critical in this translation scheme to maintain consistent\n\
    \   timing within a frame.  If SONET frames or converted sonnets shift in\n  \
    \ time, the SONET pointers, or worse, poetic meter, may suffer.\n"
