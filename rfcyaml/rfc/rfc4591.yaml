  - "2.  Control Connection Establishment\n   In order to tunnel a Frame Relay circuit
    over IP using L2TPv3, an\n   L2TPv3 Control Connection MUST first be established
    as described in\n   [RFC3931].  The L2TPv3 SCCRQ Control Message and corresponding
    SCCRP\n   Control Message MUST include the Frame Relay Data Link Connection\n
    \  Identifier (DLCI) PW Type of 0x0001 (see IANA Considerations), in the\n   Pseudowire
    Capabilities List, as defined in Section 5.4.3 of\n   [RFC3931].  This identifies
    the control connection as able to\n   establish L2TP sessions to support Frame
    Relay Pseudowires (FRPWs).\n   An LCCE MUST be able to identify itself uniquely
    in the SCCRQ and\n   SCCRP messages via a globally unique value.  By default,
    this is\n   advertised via the structured Router ID Attribute Value Pairs (AVP)\n
    \  [RFC3931], though the unstructured Hostname AVP [RFC3931] MAY be used\n   to
    identify LCCEs as well.\n"

    how the status of a PVC is reported between\n   two LCCEs.  This includes what
    should happen when a PVC is created,\n   deleted or when it changes state between
    ACTIVE and INACTIVE.  When\n   emulating a Frame Relay service, if the procedures
    for PVC status\n   management defined in [Q933] Annex A are being used between
    an LCCE\n   and the attached Remote System, an LCCE MUST participate in them (see\n
    \  Section 3.3).\n"

    - "3.1.  L2TPv3 Session Establishment\n   PVC creation (provisioning) results
      in establishment of an L2TP\n   session via the standard three-way handshake
      described in Section\n   3.4.1 of [RFC3931].  An LCCE MAY initiate the session
      immediately\n   upon PVC creation or wait until the PVC state transitions to
      ACTIVE\n   before attempting to establish a session for the PVC.  Waiting until\n
      \  the PVC transitions to ACTIVE may be preferred, as it delays\n   allocation
      of L2TP resources until it is absolutely necessary.\n   The Pseudowire Type
      AVP defined in Section 5.4.4 of [RFC3931],\n   Attribute Type 68, MUST be present
      in the Incoming-Call-Request\n   (ICRQ) messages and MUST include the Frame
      Relay DLCI PW Type of\n   0x0001 for FRPWs.\n   The Circuit Status AVP (see
      Section 3.4) MUST be present in the ICRQ\n   and Incoming-Call-Reply (ICRP)
      messages and MAY be present in the Set\n   Link Info (SLI) message for FRPWs.\n
      \  The Frame Relay Header Length AVP (see Section 3.5) MAY be present in\n   the
      ICRQ and ICRP messages.\n   The following is an example of the L2TP messages
      exchanged for an\n   FRPW that is initiated after a new PVC is provisioned and
      becomes\n   ACTIVE.\n         LCCE (LAC) A                     LCCE (LAC) B\n

      to send data into tunnel\n   In the example above, an ICRQ is sent after the
      PVC is created and\n   becomes ACTIVE.  The Circuit Status AVP indicates that
      this PVC is\n   ACTIVE and New (0x03).  The Remote End ID AVP [RFC3931] MUST
      be\n   present in the ICRQ in order to identify the PVC (together with the\n
      \  identity of the LCCE itself, as defined in Section 2) to associate\n   the
      L2TP session with.  The Remote End ID AVP, defined in [RFC3931],\n   is of opaque
      form and variable length, though one MUST at a minimum\n   support use of an
      unstructured four-octet value that is known to both\n   LCCEs (either by direct
      configuration, or some other means).  The\n   exact method of how this value
      is configured, retrieved, discovered,\n   or otherwise determined at each LCCE
      is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n   As with the ICRQ, the ICRP is
      sent only after the FR PVC transitions\n   to ACTIVE as well.  If LCCE B had
      not been provisioned for the PVC\n   identified in the ICRQ, a Call-Disconnect-Notify
      (CDN) would have\n   been immediately returned indicating that the circuit was
      not\n   provisioned or available at this LCCE.  LCCE A SHOULD then exhibit a\n
      \  periodic retry mechanism.  If so, the period and maximum number of\n   retries
      MUST be configurable.\n   An Implementation MAY send an ICRQ or ICRP before
      a PVC is ACTIVE, as\n   long as the Circuit Status AVP reflects that the PVC
      is INACTIVE and\n   an SLI is sent when the PVC becomes ACTIVE (see Section
      3.3).\n   The Incoming-Call-Connected (ICCN) is the final stage in the session\n
      \  establishment, confirming the receipt of the ICRP with acceptable\n   parameters
      to allow bidirectional traffic.\n"

      at either LCCE,\n   the associated L2TP session MUST be torn down via the CDN
      message\n   defined in Section 3.4.3 of [RFC3931].\n   General Result Codes
      regarding L2TP session establishment are defined\n   in [RFC3931].  Additional
      Frame Relay result codes are defined as\n   follows:\n      17: FR PVC was deleted
      permanently (no longer provisioned) 18: FR\n      PVC has been INACTIVE for
      an extended period of time 19:\n      Mismatched FR Header Length\n"

    - "3.3.  L2TPv3 Session Maintenance\n   FRPW over L2TP makes use of the SLI control
      message defined in\n   [RFC3931] to signal Frame Relay link status notifications
      between\n   LCCEs.  This includes ACTIVE or INACTIVE notifications of the VC,
      and\n   any other parameters that may need to be shared between the tunnel\n
      \  endpoints or LCCEs in order to provide proper PW emulation.  The SLI\n   message
      is a single message that is sent over the L2TP control\n   channel signalling
      the state change.  Since the message is delivered\n   reliably, there is no
      additional response or action required of the\n   PW subsystem to ensure that
      the state change notification was\n   received by the tunnel peer.\n   The SLI
      message MUST be sent any time there is a circuit status\n   change that may
      be reported by any values identified in the Circuit\n   Status AVP.  The only
      exceptions to this are the initial ICRQ, ICRP,\n   and CDN messages, which establish
      and tear down the L2TP session\n   itself when the PVC is created or deleted.
      \ The SLI message may be\n   sent from either LCCE at any time after the first
      ICRQ is sent (and\n   perhaps before an ICRP is received, requiring that the
      peer to\n   perform a reverse Session ID lookup).\n   An LCCE participating
      in the procedures for PVC status management\n   defined in [Q933], Annex A,
      MUST transmit an SLI message including\n   the Circuit Status AVP (see Section
      3.4) when it detects a change in\n   the status for a particular local FR PVC
      (i.e., when it detects a\n   service-affecting condition or the clearing of
      such a condition).  An\n   LCCE receiving an SLI message indicating a change
      in the status of a\n   particular FRPW SHOULD generate corresponding updates
      for the FR PVC\n   towards the Remote System, as defined in [Q933], Annex A.\n
      \  All sessions established by a given control connection utilize the\n   L2TP
      Hello facility, defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC3931], for session\n   keepalive.
      \ This gives all sessions basic dead peer and path\n   detection between LCCEs.\n"

    document allows a\n   service provider to offer a Frame Relay PVC-based service
    across an\n   IP packet-switched network (PSN).  A Frame Relay port-based service\n
    \  can be offered using [RFC4349].\n   The FRPW emulation has the following characteristics
    in relationship\n   to the native service:\n   o There is a one-to-one mapping
    between a Frame Relay PVC and an\n     FRPW, supporting bi-directional transport
    of variable length\n     frames.  The Frame Relay frame is transported in its
    entirety,\n     including the DLCI and the C/R, FECN, BECN, and DE bits, but\n
    \    excluding the opening and closing flags and the FCS.  The egress\n     LCCE
    re-writes the DLCI and regenerates the FCS.\n   o Two- and four-octet address
    fields are supported.  The length is\n     negotiated between LCCEs during session
    establishment (see Section\n     3.5).\n   o The availability or unavailability
    of the PVC is signalled between\n     LCCEs using the Circuit Status AVP (see
    Section 3.4).  Loss of\n     connectivity between LCCEs can be detected by the
    L2TPv3 keepalive\n     mechanism (see Section 4.4 in [RFC3931]).  These indications
    can be\n     used to determine the PVC status to be signalled through [Q933]\n

    can be supported is limited by the PSN\n     MTU, unless fragmentation and reassembly
    is used (see Section 4.1.4\n     of [RFC3931]).\n   o Sequencing may be enabled

    Service Type\n   for L2TP\", was published in February of 2001, by Nishit Vasavada,
    Jim\n   Boyle, Chris Garner, Serge Maskalik, and Vijay Gill.  This document\n
    \  is substantially different, but the basic concept of carrying Frame\n   Relay
    over L2TP is the same.\n   Thanks to Lloyd Wood for a razor-sharp review.\n   Carlos
    Pignataro helped with review and editing of the document.\n   During IETF Last
    Call, Mark Lewis provided thorough review and\n   comments.\n"
