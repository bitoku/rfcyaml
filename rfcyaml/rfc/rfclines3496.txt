Abstract This document specifies a Resource ReSerVation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP TE) signaling extension for support of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Service Class aware Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering.
This document defines a Resource ReSerVation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP TE) protocol addition to support ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
Service Class aware MPLS (MultiProtocol Label Switching)
This protocol addition is used with all MPLS Label Switched Routers (LSRs) and link types (including, but not restricted to, Packet over SONET, Ethernet, and ATM links) to signal traffic engineered paths that can support the ATM service classes as defined by the ATM Forum [TM].
This document does not specify HOW to actually implement the functionality in the MPLS LSRs to emulate the ATM Forum service classes (such as necessary queuing and scheduling mechanisms), only how to signal that the TE path must support the ATM Forum service classes.
A useful application for such paths is the carriage of ATM cells encapsulated in IP or MPLS packets in order to use MPLS networks as functional replacements for ATM networks.
Extended RSVP TE Path Message Format One new RSVP TE Object is defined in this document: the ATM SERVICECLASS Object.
Detailed description of this Object is provided below.
This new Object is applicable to PATH messages.
This specification only defines the use of the ATM SERVICECLASS Object in PATH messages used to establish LSP (Label Switched Path) Tunnels in accordance with [RSVP TE].
Such PATH messages contain a Session Object with a C Type equal to LSP TUNNEL IPv4 and a LABEL REQUEST object.
Restrictions defined in [RSVP TE] for support of establishment of LSP Tunnels via RSVP TE are also applicable to the establishment of LSP Tunnels supporting ATM Service Class aware traffic engineering.
For instance, only unicast LSPs are supported and Multicast LSPs are for further study.
This new ATM SERVICECLASS object is optional with respect to RSVP TE so that general RSVP TE implementations not concerned with ATM Service Class aware traffic engineering MPLS LSP setup do not have to support this object.
The format of the extended PATH message is as follows:
[ <RECORD ROUTE> ] 3.
ATM SERVICECLASS Object The ATM SERVICECLASS object format is as follows:
It must be set to zero on transmission and must be ignored on receipt.
3 bits Indicates the ATM Service Class.
0: UBR (Unspecified Bit Rate) 1: VBR NRT (Variable Bit Rate, Non Real Time) 2: VBR RT (Variable Bit Rate, Real Time) 3: CBR (Constant Bit Rate) 4 7: reserved 4.
Handling the ATM SERVICECLASS Object
To establish an LSP tunnel with RSVP TE, the sender LSR creates a PATH message with a session type of LSP Tunnel IPv4 and with a LABEL REQUEST object as per [RSVP TE].
The sender LSR may also include the DIFFSERV object as per [DIFF MPLS].
If the LSP is associated with an ATM Service Class, the sender LSR must include the ATM SERVICECLASS object in the PATH message with the Service Class (SC) field set to signify the desired ATM Service Class.
If a path message contains multiple ATM SERVICECLASS objects, only the first one is meaningful; subsequent ATM SERVICECLASS object(s) must be ignored and must not be forwarded.
Each LSR along the path that is ATM SERVICECLASS aware records the ATM SERVICECLASS object, when present, in its path state block.
The destination LSR responds to the PATH message by sending a RESV message without an ATM SERVICECLASS object (whether the PATH message contained an ATM SERVICECLASS object or not).
Non support of the ATM SERVICECLASS Object An LSR that does not recognize the ATM SERVICECLASS object Class Number must behave in accordance with the procedures specified in [RSVP] for an unknown Class Number with the binary format 11bbbbbb, where b 0 or 1 (i.e., RSVP will ignore the object but forward it unexamined and unmodified).
An LSR that recognizes the ATM SERVICECLASS object Class Number but does not recognize the ATM SERVICECLASS object C Type, must behave in accordance with the procedures specified in [RSVP] for an unknown C type (i.e., it must send a PathErr with the error code 'Unknown object C Type' toward the sender).
In both situations, this causes the path setup to fail.
The sender should notify management that a LSP cannot be established and possibly might take action to retry reservation establishment without the ATM SERVICECLASS object.
The solution is not expected to add specific security requirements beyond those of Diff Serv and existing TE.
The security mechanisms currently used with Diff Serv and existing TE can be used with this solution.
The IANA has registered a new RSVP Class Number for ATM SERVICECLASS (227).
