  - "1.  Introduction\n   MSDP [RFC3618] is used primarily in two deployment scenarios:\n\
    \   o  Between PIM Domains\n      MSDP can be used between Protocol Independent\
    \ Multicast Sparse\n      Mode (PIM-SM) [RFC4601] domains to convey information\
    \ about active\n      sources available in other domains.  MSDP peering used in\
    \ such\n      cases is generally one-to-one peering, and utilizes the\n      deterministic\
    \ peer-RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) rules described\n      in the MSDP specification\
    \ (i.e., it does not use mesh-groups).\n      Peerings can be aggregated on a\
    \ single MSDP peer.  Such a peer can\n      typically have from one to hundreds\
    \ of peerings, which is similar\n      in scale to BGP peerings.\n   o  Within\
    \ a PIM Domain\n      MSDP is often used between Anycast Rendezvous Points (Anycast-RPs)\n\
    \      [RFC3446] within a PIM domain to synchronize information about the\n  \
    \    active sources being served by each Anycast-RP peer (by virtue of\n     \
    \ IGP reachability).  MSDP peering used in this scenario is\n      typically based\
    \ on MSDP mesh groups, where anywhere from two to\n      tens of peers can comprise\
    \ a given mesh group, although more than\n      ten is not typical.  One or more\
    \ of these mesh-group peers may\n      also have additional one-to-one peerings\
    \ with MSDP peers outside\n      that PIM domain for discovery of external sources.\
    \  MSDP for\n      anycast-RP without external MSDP peering is a valid deployment\n\
    \      option and common.\n   Current best practice for MSDP deployment utilizes\
    \ PIM-SM and the\n   Border Gateway Protocol with multi-protocol extensions (MBGP)\n\
    \   [RFC4271, RFC2858].  This document outlines how these protocols work\n   together\
    \ to provide an intra-domain and inter-domain Any Source\n   Multicast (ASM) service.\n\
    \   The PIM-SM specification assumes that SM operates only in one PIM\n   domain.\
    \  MSDP is used to enable the use of multiple PIM domains by\n   distributing\
    \ the required information about active multicast sources\n   to other PIM domains.\
    \  Due to breaking the Internet multicast\n   infrastructure down to multiple\
    \ PIM domains, MSDP also enables the\n   possibility of setting policy on the\
    \ visibility of the groups and\n   sources.\n   Transit IP providers typically\
    \ deploy MSDP to be part of the global\n   multicast infrastructure by connecting\
    \ to their upstream and peer\n   multicast networks using MSDP.\n   Edge multicast\
    \ networks typically have two choices: to use their\n   Internet providers' RP,\
    \ or to have their own RP and connect it to\n   their ISP using MSDP.  By deploying\
    \ their own RP and MSDP, they can\n   use internal multicast groups that are not\
    \ visible to the provider's\n   RP.  This helps internal multicast be able to\
    \ continue to work in the\n   event that there is a problem with connectivity\
    \ to the provider or\n   that the provider's RP/MSDP is experiencing difficulties.\
    \  In the\n   simplest cases, where no internal multicast groups are necessary,\n\
    \   there is often no need to deploy MSDP.\n"
- title: 1.1.  BCP, Experimental Protocols, and Normative References
  contents:
  - "1.1.  BCP, Experimental Protocols, and Normative References\n   This document\
    \ describes the best current practice for a widely\n   deployed Experimental protocol,\
    \ MSDP.  There is no plan to advance\n   the MSDP's status (for example, to Proposed\
    \ Standard).  The reasons\n   for this include:\n   o  MSDP was originally envisioned\
    \ as a temporary protocol to be\n      supplanted by whatever the IDMR working\
    \ group produced as an\n      inter-domain protocol.  However, the IDMR WG (or\
    \ subsequently, the\n      BGMP WG) never produced a protocol that could be deployed\
    \ to\n      replace MSDP.\n   o  One of the primary reasons given for MSDP to\
    \ be classified as\n      Experimental was that the MSDP Working Group came up\
    \ with\n      modifications to the protocol that the WG thought made it better\n\
    \      but that implementors didn't see any reasons to deploy.  Without\n    \
    \  these modifications (e.g., UDP or GRE encapsulation), MSDP can\n      have\
    \ negative consequences to initial packets in datagram streams.\n   o  Scalability:\
    \ Although we don't know what the hard limits might be,\n      readvertising everything\
    \ you know every 60 seconds clearly limits\n      the amount of state you can\
    \ advertise.\n   o  MSDP reached nearly ubiquitous deployment as the de facto\
    \ standard\n      inter-domain multicast protocol in the IPv4 Internet.\n   o\
    \  No consensus could be reached regarding the reworking of MSDP to\n      address\
    \ the many concerns of various constituencies within the\n      IETF.  As a result,\
    \ a decision was taken to document what is\n      (ubiquitously) deployed and\
    \ to move that document to Experimental.\n      While advancement of MSDP to Proposed\
    \ Standard was considered, for\n      the reasons mentioned above, it was immediately\
    \ discarded.\n   o  The advent of protocols such as source-specific multicast\
    \ and bi-\n      directional PIM, as well as embedded RP techniques for IPv6,\
    \ have\n      further reduced consensus that a replacement protocol for MSDP for\n\
    \      the IPv4 Internet is required.\n   The RFC Editor's policy regarding references\
    \ is that they be split\n   into two categories known as \"normative\" and \"\
    informative\".\n   Normative references specify those documents that must be read\
    \ for\n   one to understand or implement the technology in an RFC (or whose\n\
    \   technology must be present for the technology in the new RFC to work)\n  \
    \ [RFCED].  In order to understand this document, one must also\n   understand\
    \ both the PIM and MSDP documents.  As a result, references\n   to these documents\
    \ are normative.\n   The IETF has adopted the policy that BCPs must not have normative\n\
    \   references to Experimental protocols.  However, this document is a\n   special\
    \ case in that the underlying Experimental document (MSDP) is\n   not planned\
    \ to be advanced to Proposed Standard.\n   The MBONED Working Group has requested\
    \ approval under the Variance\n   Procedure as documented in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].\
    \  The IESG followed the\n   Variance Procedure and, after an additional 4 week\
    \ IETF Last Call,\n   evaluated the comments and status, and has approved this\
    \ document.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

    \ most common inter-domain MSDP\n   peering possibilities and their deployment\
    \ options.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Peering between PIM Border Routers
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Peering between PIM Border Routers\n   In this case, the MSDP peers within\
    \ the domain have their own RP\n   located within a bounded PIM domain.  In addition,\
    \ the domain will\n   typically have its own Autonomous System (AS) number and\
    \ one or more\n   MBGP speakers.  The domain may also have multiple MSDP speakers.\n\
    \   Each border router has an MSDP and MBGP peering with its peer\n   routers.\
    \  These external MSDP peering deployments typically configure\n   the MBGP peering\
    \ and MSDP peering using the same directly connected\n   next hop peer IP address\
    \ or other IP address from the same router.\n   Typical deployments of this type\
    \ are providers who have a direct\n   peering with other providers, providers\
    \ peering at an exchange, or\n   providers who use their edge router to MSDP/MBGP\
    \ peer with customers.\n   For a direct peering inter-domain environment to be\
    \ successful, the\n   first AS in the MBGP best path to the originating RP should\
    \ be the\n   same as the AS of the MSDP peer.  As an example, consider the\n \
    \  following topology:\n         AS1----AS2----AS4\n         |    /\n        \
    \ |   /\n         |  /\n         AS3\n   In this case, AS4 receives a Source Active\
    \ (SA) message, originated\n   by AS1, from AS2.  AS2 also has an MBGP peering\
    \ with AS4.  The MBGP\n   first hop AS from AS4, in the best path to the originating\
    \ RP, is\n   AS2.  The AS of the sending MSDP peer is also AS2.  In this case,\
    \ the\n   peer-Reverse Path Forwarding check (peer-RPF check) passes, and the\n\
    \   SA message is forwarded.\n   A peer-RPF failure would occur in this topology\
    \ when the MBGP first\n   hop AS, in the best path to the originating RP, is AS2\
    \ and the origin\n   AS of the sending MSDP peer is AS3.  This reliance upon BGP\
    \ AS PATH\n   information prevents endless looping of SA packets.\n   Router code,\
    \ which has adopted the latest rules in the MSDP document,\n   will relax the\
    \ rules between AS's a bit.  In the following topology,\n   we have an MSDP peering\
    \ between AS1<->AS3 and AS3<->AS4:\n                               RP\n      \
    \   AS1----AS2----AS3----AS4\n   If the first AS in best path to the RP does not\
    \ equal the MSDP peer,\n   MSDP peer-RPF fails.  So AS1 cannot MSDP peer with\
    \ AS3, since AS2 is\n   the first AS in the MBGP best path to AS4 RP.  With the\
    \ latest MSDP\n   document compliant code, AS1 will choose the peer in the closest\
    \ AS\n   along best AS path to the RP.  AS1 will then accept SA's coming from\n\
    \   AS3.  If there are multiple MSDP peers to routers within the same AS,\n  \
    \ the peer with the highest IP address is chosen as the RPF peer.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Peering between Non-Border Routers
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Peering between Non-Border Routers\n   For MSDP peering between border\
    \ routers, intra-domain MSDP\n   scalability is restricted because it is necessary\
    \ to also maintain\n   MBGP and MSDP peerings internally towards their border\
    \ routers.\n   Within the intra-domain, the border router becomes the announcer\
    \ of\n   the next hop towards the originating RP.  This requires that all\n  \
    \ intra-domain MSDP peerings mirror the MBGP path back towards the\n   border\
    \ router.  External MSDP (eMSDP) peerings rely upon AS path for\n   peer RPF checking,\
    \ while internal MSDP (iMSDP) peerings rely upon the\n   announcer of the next\
    \ hop.\n   While the eMBGP peer is typically directly connected between border\n\
    \   routers, it is common for the eMSDP peer to be located deeper into\n   the\
    \ transit provider's AS.  Providers, which desire more flexibility\n   in MSDP\
    \ peering placement, commonly choose a few dedicated routers\n   within their\
    \ core networks for the inter-domain MSDP peerings to\n   their customers.  These\
    \ core MSDP routers will also typically be in\n   the provider's intra-domain\
    \ MSDP mesh group and be configured for\n   Anycast RP.  All multicast routers\
    \ in the provider's AS should\n   statically point to the Anycast RP address.\
    \  Static RP assignment is\n   the most commonly used method for group-to-RP mapping\
    \ due to its\n   deterministic nature.  Auto-RP [RFC4601] and/or the Bootstrap\
    \ Router\n   (BSR) [BSR] dynamic RP mapping mechanisms could also be used to\n\
    \   disseminate RP information within the provider's network\n   For an SA message\
    \ to be accepted in this (multi-hop peering)\n   environment, we rely upon the\
    \ next (or closest, with latest MSDP\n   spec) AS in the best path towards the\
    \ originating RP for the RPF\n   check.  The MSDP peer address should be in the\
    \ same AS as the AS of\n   the border router's MBGP peer.  The MSDP peer address\
    \ should be\n   advertised via MBGP.\n   For example, in the diagram below, if\
    \ customer R1 router is MBGP\n   peering with the R2 router and if R1 is MSDP\
    \ peering with the R3\n   router, then R2 and R3 must be in the same AS (or must\
    \ appear, to\n   AS1, to be from the same AS in the event that private AS numbers\
    \ are\n   deployed).  The MSDP peer with the highest IP address will be chosen\n\
    \   as the MSDP RPF peer.  R1 must also have the MSDP peer address of R3\n   in\
    \ its MBGP table.\n         +--+    +--+    +--+\n         |R1|----|R2|----|R3|\n\
    \         +--+    +--+    +--+\n         AS1     AS2     AS2\n   From R3's perspective,\
    \ AS1 (R1) is the MBGP next AS in the best path\n   towards the originating RP.\
    \  As long as AS1 is the next AS (or\n   closest) in the best path towards the\
    \ originating RP, RPF will\n   succeed on SAs arriving from R1.\n   In contrast,\
    \ with the single hop scenario, with R2 (instead of R3)\n   border MSDP peering\
    \ with R1 border, R2's MBGP address becomes the\n   announcer of the next hop\
    \ for R3, towards the originating RP, and R3\n   must peer with that R2 address.\
    \  Moreover, all AS2 intra-domain MSDP\n   peers need to follow iMBGP (or other\
    \ IGP) peerings towards R2 since\n   iMSDP has a dependence upon peering with\
    \ the address of the MBGP (or\n   other IGP) announcer of the next hop.\n"
- title: 2.3.  MSDP Peering without BGP
  contents:
  - "2.3.  MSDP Peering without BGP\n   In this case, an enterprise maintains its\
    \ own RP and has an MSDP\n   peering with its service provider but does not BGP\
    \ peer with them.\n   MSDP relies upon BGP path information to learn the MSDP\
    \ topology for\n   the SA peer-RPF check.  MSDP can be deployed without BGP, however,\n\
    \   and as a result, there are some special cases where the requirement\n   to\
    \ perform a peer-RPF check on the BGP path information is suspended.\n   These\
    \ cases are:\n   o  There is only a single MSDP peer connection.\n   o  A default\
    \ peer (default MSDP route) is configured.\n   o  The originating RP is directly\
    \ connected.\n   o  A mesh group is used.\n   o  An implementation is used that\
    \ allows for an MSDP peer-RPF check\n      using an IGP.\n   An enterprise will\
    \ typically configure a unicast default route from\n   its border router to the\
    \ provider's border router and then MSDP peer\n   with the provider's MSDP router.\
    \  If internal MSDP peerings are also\n   used within the enterprise, then an\
    \ MSDP default peer will need to be\n   configured on the border router that points\
    \ to the provider.  In this\n   way, all external multicast sources will be learned,\
    \ and internal\n   sources can be advertised.  If only a single MSDP peering was\
    \ used\n   (no internal MSDP peerings) towards the provider, then this stub site\n\
    \   will MSDP default peer towards the provider and skip the peer-RPF\n   check.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Peering between MSDP- and MBGP-Configured Routers\n   The next hop IP address\
    \ of the iBGP peer is typically used for the\n   MSDP peer-RPF check (IGP can\
    \ also be used).  This is different from\n   the inter-domain BGP/MSDP case, where\
    \ AS path information is used for\n   the peer-RPF check.  For this reason, it\

    \ a loop.\n   This deployment could also fail on an update from Ra to RP2 if RP2\n\
    \   was MBGP peering to an address other than 2.2.2.2 on Ra.  Intra-\n   domain\
    \ deployments must have MSDP and MBGP (or other IGP) peering\n   addresses that\

- title: 3.2.  MSDP Peer Is Not BGP Peer (or No BGP Peer)
  contents:
  - "3.2.  MSDP Peer Is Not BGP Peer (or No BGP Peer)\n   This is a common MSDP intra-domain\
    \ deployment in environments where\n   few routers are running MBGP or where the\
    \ domain is not running MBGP.\n   The problem here is that the MSDP peer address\
    \ needs to be the same\n   as the MBGP peer address.  To get around this requirement,\
    \ the intra-\n   domain MSDP RPF rules have been relaxed in the following topologies:\n\
    \   o  By configuring the MSDP peer as a mesh group peer.\n   o  By having the\
    \ MSDP peer be the only MSDP peer.\n   o  By configuring a default MSDP peer.\n\
    \   o  By peering with the originating RP.\n   o  By relying upon an IGP for MSDP\
    \ peer-RPF.\n   The common choice around the intra-domain BGP peering requirement,\n\
    \   when more than one MSDP peer is configured, is to deploy MSDP mesh\n   groups.\
    \  When an MSDP mesh group is deployed, there is no RPF check\n   on arriving\
    \ SA messages when they are received from a mesh group\n   peer.  Subsequently,\
    \ SA messages are always accepted from mesh group\n   peers.  MSDP mesh groups\
    \ were developed to reduce the amount of SA\n   traffic in the network since SAs,\
    \ which arrive from a mesh group\n   peer, are not flooded to peers within that\
    \ same mesh group.  Mesh\n   groups must be fully meshed.\n   If recent (but not\
    \ currently widely deployed) router code is running\n   that is fully compliant\
    \ with the latest MSDP document, another\n   option, to work around not having\
    \ BGP to MSDP RPF peer, is to RPF\n   using an IGP like OSPF, IS-IS, RIP, etc.\
    \  This new capability will\n   allow for enterprise customers, who are not running\
    \ BGP and who don't\n   want to run mesh groups, to use their existing IGP to\
    \ satisfy the\n   MSDP peer-RPF rules.\n"

    \ MSDP peers.  Allowing\n   multiple mesh groups to forward to one another can\
    \ reduce the number\n   of MSDP peerings per router (due to the full mesh requirement)\
    \ and\n   hence reduce router load.  A good hierarchical mesh group\n   implementation\
    \ (one that prevents looping) contains a core mesh group\n   in the backbone,\
    \ and these core routers serve as mesh group\n   aggregation routers:\n      \
    \                [R2]{A,2}\n                      /  \\\n                    \
    \ /    \\\n                    /      \\\n                   /        \\\n   \
    \               /          \\\n                 /            \\\n            \
    \    /              \\\n         {A,1}[R1]-------------[R3]{A,3}\n   In this example,\
    \ R1, R2, and R3 are in MSDP mesh group A (the core\n   mesh group), and each\
    \ serves as MSDP aggregation routers for their\n   leaf (or second tier) mesh\
    \ groups 1, 2, and 3.  Since SA messages\n   received from a mesh group peer are\
    \ not forwarded to peers within\n   that same mesh group, SA messages will not\
    \ loop.  Do not create\n   topologies that connect mesh groups in a loop.  In\
    \ the above example,\n   for instance, second-tier mesh groups 1, 2, and 3 must\
    \ not directly\n   exchange SA messages with each other or an endless SA loop\
    \ will\n   occur.\n   Redundancy between mesh groups will also cause a loop and\
    \ is\n   subsequently not available with hierarchical mesh groups.  For\n   instance,\
    \ assume that R3 had two routers connecting its leaf mesh\n   group 3 with the\
    \ core mesh group A.  A loop would be created between\n   mesh group 3 and mesh\
    \ group A because each mesh group must be fully\n   meshed between peers.\n"
- title: 3.4.  MSDP and Route Reflectors
  contents:
  - "3.4.  MSDP and Route Reflectors\n   BGP requires all iBGP speakers that are not\
    \ route-reflector clients\n   or confederation members be fully meshed to prevent\
    \ loops.  In the\n   route reflector environment, MSDP requires that the route\
    \ reflector\n   clients peer with the route reflector since the router reflector\
    \ (RR)\n   is the BGP announcer of the next hop towards the originating RP.  The\n\
    \   RR is not the BGP next hop, but is the announcer of the BGP next hop.\n  \
    \ The announcer of the next hop is the address typically used for MSDP\n   peer-RPF\
    \ checks.  For example, consider the following case:\n               Ra--------RR\n\
    \                         /|\\\n                        / | \\\n             \
    \          A  B  C\n   Ra is forwarding MSDP SAs to the route reflector RR.  Routers\
    \ A, B,\n   and C also MSDP peer with RR.  When RR forwards the SA to A, B, and\n\
    \   C, these RR clients will accept the SA because RR is the announcer of\n  \
    \ the next hop to the originating RP address.\n   An SA will peer-RPF fail if\
    \ Ra MSDP peers directly with Routers A, B,\n   or C because the announcer of\
    \ the next hop is RR but the SA update\n   came from Ra.  Proper deployment is\
    \ to have RR clients MSDP peer with\n   the RR.  MSDP mesh groups may be used\
    \ to work around this\n   requirement.  External MSDP peerings will also prevent\
    \ this\n   requirement since the next AS is compared between MBGP and MSDP\n \
    \  peerings, rather than the IP address of the announcer of the next\n   hop.\n\
    \   Some recent MSDP implementations conform to the latest MSDP document,\n  \
    \ which relaxes the requirement of peering with the Advertiser of the\n   next\
    \ hop (the Route Reflector).  This new rule allows for peering\n   with the next\
    \ hop, in addition to the Advertiser of the next hop.  In\n   the example above,\
    \ for instance, if Ra is the next hop (perhaps due\n   to using BGP's next hop\
    \ self attribute), and if routers A, B, and C\n   are peering with Ra, the SA's\
    \ received from Ra will now succeed.\n"
- title: 3.5.  MSDP and Anycast RPs
  contents:
  - "3.5.  MSDP and Anycast RPs\n   A network with multiple RPs can achieve RP load\
    \ sharing and\n   redundancy by using the Anycast RP mechanism in conjunction\
    \ with MSDP\n   mesh groups [RFC3446].  This mechanism is a common deployment\n\
    \   technique used within a domain by service providers and enterprises\n   that\
    \ deploy several RPs within their domains.  These RPs will each\n   have the same\
    \ IP address configured on a Loopback interface (making\n   this the Anycast address).\
    \  These RPs will MSDP peer with each other\n   using a separate loopback interface\
    \ and are part of the same fully\n   meshed MSDP mesh group.  This loopback interface,\
    \ used for MSDP\n   peering, will typically also be used for the MBGP peering.\
    \  All\n   routers within the provider's domain will learn of the Anycast RP\n\
    \   address through Auto-RP, BSR, or a static RP assignment.  Each\n   designated\
    \ router in the domain will send source registers and group\n   joins to the Anycast\
    \ RP address.  Unicast routing will direct those\n   registers and joins to the\
    \ nearest Anycast RP.  If a particular\n   Anycast RP router fails, unicast routing\
    \ will direct subsequent\n   registers and joins to the nearest Anycast RP.  That\
    \ RP will then\n   forward an MSDP update to all peers within the Anycast MSDP\
    \ mesh\n   group.  Each RP will then forward (or receive) the SAs to (from)\n\
    \   external customers and providers.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   An MSDP service should be secured by explicitly\
    \ controlling the state\n   that is created by, and passed within, the MSDP service.\
    \  As with\n   unicast routing state, MSDP state should be controlled locally,\
    \ at\n   the edge origination points.  Selective filtering at the multicast\n\
    \   service edge helps ensure that only intended sources result in SA\n   message\
    \ creation, and this control helps to reduce the likelihood of\n   state-aggregation\
    \ related problems in the core.  There are a variety\n   of points where local\
    \ policy should be applied to the MSDP service.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Filtering SA Messages
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Filtering SA Messages\n   The process of originating SA messages should\
    \ be filtered to ensure\n   that only intended local sources are resulting in\
    \ SA message\n   origination.  In addition, MSDP speakers should filter which\
    \ SA\n   messages get received and forwarded.\n   Typically, there is a fair amount\
    \ of (S,G) state in a PIM-SM domain\n   that is local to the domain.  However,\
    \ without proper filtering, SA\n   messages containing these local (S,G) announcements\
    \ may be advertised\n   to the global MSDP infrastructure.  Examples of this include\
    \ domain-\n   local applications that use global IP multicast addresses and sources\n\
    \   that use RFC 1918 addresses [RFC1918].  To improve on the scalability\n  \
    \ of MSDP and to avoid global visibility of domain local (S,G)\n   information,\
    \ an external SA filter list is recommended to help\n   prevent unnecessary creation,\
    \ forwarding, and caching of well-known\n   domain local sources.\n"
- title: 4.2.  SA Message State Limits
  contents:
  - "4.2.  SA Message State Limits\n   Proper filtering on SA message origination,\
    \ receipt, and forwarding\n   will significantly reduce the likelihood of unintended\
    \ and unexpected\n   spikes in MSDP state.  However, an SA-cache state limit SHOULD\
    \ be\n   configured as a final safeguard to state spikes.  When an MSDP\n   peering\
    \ has reached a stable state (i.e., when the peering has been\n   established\
    \ and the initial SA state has been transferred), it may\n   also be desirable\
    \ to configure a rate limiter for the creation of new\n   SA state entries.\n"
