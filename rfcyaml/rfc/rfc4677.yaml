  - "1.  Introduction\n   Since its early years, attendance at Internet Engineering\
    \ Task Force\n   (IETF) face-to-face meetings has grown phenomenally.  Many of\
    \ the\n   attendees are new to the IETF at each meeting, and many of those go\n\
    \   on to become regular attendees.  When the meetings were smaller, it\n   was\
    \ relatively easy for a newcomer to get into the swing of things.\n   Today, however,\
    \ a newcomer meets many more new people, some\n   previously known only as the\
    \ authors of documents or thought-\n   provoking email messages.\n   This document\
    \ describes many aspects of the IETF, with the goal of\n   explaining to newcomers\
    \ how the IETF works.  This will give them a\n   warm, fuzzy feeling and enable\
    \ them to make the meeting and the\n   Working Group discussions more productive\
    \ for everyone.\n   Of course, it's true that many IETF participants don't go\
    \ to the\n   face-to-face meetings at all.  Instead, they're active on the mailing\n\
    \   list of various IETF Working Groups.  Since the inner workings of\n   Working\
    \ Groups can be hard for newcomers to understand, this document\n   provides the\
    \ mundane bits of information that newcomers will need in\n   order to become\
    \ active participants.\n   The IETF is always in a state of change.  Although\
    \ the principles in\n   this document are expected to remain largely the same\
    \ over time,\n   practical details may well have changed by the time you read\
    \ it; for\n   example, a web-based tool may have replaced an email address for\n\
    \   requesting some sort of action.\n   Many types of IETF documentation are mentioned\
    \ in the Tao, from BCPs\n   to RFCs and FYIs and STDs.  BCPs make recommendations\
    \ for Best\n   Current Practices in the Internet; RFCs are the IETF's main technical\n\
    \   documentation series, politely known as \"Requests for Comments\"; FYIs\n\
    \   provide topical and technical overviews that are introductory or\n   appeal\
    \ to a broad audience; and STDs are RFCs identified as\n   \"standards\".  See\
    \ Section 8 for more information.\n   The acronyms and abbreviations used in this\
    \ document are usually\n   expanded in place and are explained fully in Appendix\
    \ A.\n   This document is intended to obsolete FYI 17, RFC 3160.  See Section\n\
    \   3.2.5 for information on what it means for one RFC to obsolete\n   another.\n"

- title: 3.  What Is the IETF?
  contents:
  - "3.  What Is the IETF?\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force is a loosely self-organized\
    \ group\n   of people who contribute to the engineering and evolution of Internet\n\
    \   technologies.  It is the principal body engaged in the development of\n  \
    \ new Internet standard specifications.  The IETF is unusual in that it\n   exists\
    \ as a collection of happenings, but is not a corporation and\n   has no board\
    \ of directors, no members, and no dues; see [BCP95], \"A\n   Mission Statement\
    \ for the IETF\", for more detail.\n   Its mission includes the following:\n \
    \  o  Identifying, and proposing solutions to, pressing operational and\n    \
    \  technical problems in the Internet\n   o  Specifying the development or usage\
    \ of protocols and the near-term\n      architecture to solve such technical problems\
    \ for the Internet\n   o  Making recommendations to the Internet Engineering Steering\
    \ Group\n      (IESG) regarding the standardization of protocols and protocol\n\
    \      usage in the Internet\n   o  Facilitating technology transfer from the\
    \ Internet Research Task\n      Force (IRTF) to the wider Internet community\n\
    \   o  Providing a forum for the exchange of information within the\n      Internet\
    \ community between vendors, users, researchers, agency\n      contractors, and\
    \ network managers\n   The IETF meeting is not a conference, although there are\
    \ technical\n   presentations.  The IETF is not a traditional standards organization,\n\
    \   although many specifications are produced that become standards.  The\n  \
    \ IETF is made up of volunteers, many of whom meet three times a year\n   to fulfill\
    \ the IETF mission.\n   There is no membership in the IETF.  Anyone may register\
    \ for and\n   attend any meeting.  The closest thing there is to being an IETF\n\
    \   member is being on the IETF or Working Group mailing lists (see\n   Section\
    \ 3.3).  This is where the best information about current IETF\n   activities\
    \ and focus can be found.\n   Of course, no organization can be as successful\
    \ as the IETF is\n   without having some sort of structure.  In the IETF's case,\
    \ that\n   structure is provided by other organizations, as described in\n   [BCP11],\
    \ \"The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards Process\".\n   If you participate\
    \ in the IETF and read only one BCP, this is the one\n   you should read.\n  \
    \ In many ways, the IETF runs on the beliefs of its members.  One of\n   the \"\
    founding beliefs\" is embodied in an early quote about the IETF\n   from David\
    \ Clark: \"We reject kings, presidents and voting.  We\n   believe in rough consensus\
    \ and running code\".  Another early quote\n   that has become a commonly-held\
    \ belief in the IETF comes from Jon\n   Postel: \"Be conservative in what you\
    \ send and liberal in what you\n   accept\".\n   The IETF is really about its\
    \ members.  Because of the unrestrictive\n   membership policies, IETF members\
    \ come from all over the world and\n   from many different parts of the Internet\
    \ industry.  See Section 4.11\n   for information about the ways that many people\
    \ fit into the IETF.\n   One more thing that is important for newcomers: the IETF\
    \ in no way\n   \"runs the Internet\", despite what some people mistakenly might\
    \ say.\n   The IETF makes standards that are often adopted by Internet users,\n\
    \   but it does not control, or even patrol, the Internet.  If your\n   interest\
    \ in the IETF is because you want to be part of the overseers,\n   you may be\
    \ badly disappointed by the IETF.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Humble Beginnings
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Humble Beginnings\n   The first IETF meeting was held in January 1986 at\
    \ Linkabit in San\n   Diego, with 21 attendees.  The 4th IETF, held at SRI in\
    \ Menlo Park in\n   October 1986, was the first that non-government vendors attended.\n\
    \   The concept of Working Groups was introduced at the 5th IETF meeting\n   at\
    \ the NASA Ames Research Center in California in February 1987.  The\n   7th IETF,\
    \ held at MITRE in McLean, Virginia, in July 1987, was the\n   first meeting with\
    \ more than 100 attendees.\n   The 14th IETF meeting was held at Stanford University\
    \ in July 1989.\n   It marked a major change in the structure of the IETF universe.\
    \  The\n   IAB (then Internet Activities Board, now Internet Architecture\n  \
    \ Board), which until that time oversaw many \"task forces\", changed its\n  \
    \ structure to leave only two: the IETF and the IRTF.  The IRTF is\n   tasked\
    \ to consider long-term research problems in the Internet.  The\n   IETF also\
    \ changed at that time.\n   After the Internet Society (ISOC) was formed in January\
    \ 1992, the IAB\n   proposed to ISOC that the IAB's activities should take place\
    \ under\n   the auspices of the Internet Society.  During INET92 in Kobe, Japan,\n\
    \   the ISOC Trustees approved a new charter for the IAB to reflect the\n   proposed\
    \ relationship.\n   The IETF met in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in July 1993.\
    \  This was\n   the first IETF meeting held in Europe, and the US/non-US attendee\n\
    \   split was nearly 50/50.  About one in three IETF meetings are now\n   held\
    \ in Europe or Asia, and the number of non-US attendees continues\n   to be high\
    \ -- about 50%, even at meetings held in the United States.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  ISOC (Internet Society)\n   The Internet Society is an international,\
    \ non-profit, membership\n   organization that fosters the expansion of the Internet.\
    \  One of the\n   ways that ISOC does this is through financial and legal support\
    \ of\n   the other \"I\" groups described here, particularly the IETF.  ISOC\n\
    \   provides insurance coverage for many of the people in the IETF\n   process\
    \ and acts as a public relations channel for the times that one\n   of the \"\
    I\" groups wants to say something to the press.  The ISOC is\n   one of the major\
    \ unsung (and under-supported) heroes of the Internet.\n   Starting in spring\
    \ 2005, the ISOC also became home base for the\n   IETF's directly employed administrative\
    \ staff.  This is described in\n   more detail in [BCP101], \"Structure of the\
    \ IETF Administrative\n   Support Activity (IASA)\".  The staff initially includes\
    \ only an\n   Administrative Director (IAD) who works full-time overseeing IETF\n\
    \   meeting planning, operational aspects of support services (the\n   secretariat,\
    \ IANA (the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), and the\n   RFC Editor, which\
    \ are described later in this section), and the\n   budget.  He or she (currently\
    \ it's a he) leads the IETF\n   Administrative Support Activity (IASA), which\
    \ takes care of tasks\n   such as collecting meeting fees and paying invoices,\
    \ and also\n   supports the tools for the work of IETF working groups, the IESG,\
    \ the\n   IAB, and the IRTF (more about these later in this section).\n   As well\
    \ as staff, the IASA comprises volunteers and ex officio\n   members from the\
    \ ISOC and IETF leadership.  The IASA and the IAD are\n   directed by the IETF\
    \ Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), which\n   is selected by the IETF\
    \ community.  Here's how all this looks:\n                          Internet Society\n\
    \                                 |\n                                IAOC\n  \

    \ which we turn to now.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group)
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group)\n   The IESG is responsible\
    \ for technical management of IETF activities\n   and the Internet standards process.\
    \  It administers the process\n   according to the rules and procedures that have\
    \ been ratified by the\n   ISOC Trustees.  However, the IESG doesn't do much direct\
    \ leadership,\n   such as the kind you will find in many other standards organizations.\n\
    \   As its name suggests, its role is to set directions rather than to\n   give\
    \ orders.  The IESG ratifies or corrects the output from the\n   IETF's Working\
    \ Groups (WGs), gets WGs started and finished, and makes\n   sure that non-WG\
    \ drafts that are about to become RFCs are correct.\n   The IESG consists of the\
    \ Area Directors (ADs), who are selected by\n   the Nominations Committee (which\
    \ is usually called \"the NomCom\") and\n   are appointed for two years.  The\
    \ process for choosing the members of\n   the IESG is detailed in [BCP10], \"\
    IAB and IESG Selection,\n   Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the\
    \ Nominating and\n   Recall Committees\".\n   The current areas and abbreviations\

    \                    email and the web\n   General (GEN)           Catch-all for\
    \ WGs that don't fit in other\n                           areas (which is very\
    \ few)\n   Internet (INT)          Different ways of moving IP packets and\n \
    \                          DNS information\n   Operations and          Operational\

    \ packets to their destinations\n   Security (SEC)          Authentication and\
    \ privacy\n   Transport (TSV)         Special services for special packets\n \
    \  Because the IESG has a great deal of influence on whether Internet\n   Drafts\
    \ become RFCs, many people look at the ADs as somewhat godlike\n   creatures.\
    \  IETF participants sometimes reverently ask Area Directors\n   for their opinion\
    \ on a particular subject.  However, most ADs are\n   nearly indistinguishable\
    \ from mere mortals and rarely speak from\n   mountaintops.  In fact, when asked\
    \ for specific technical comments,\n   the ADs may often defer to members at large\
    \ whom they feel have more\n   knowledge than they do in that area.\n   The ADs\
    \ for a particular area are expected to know more about the\n   combined work\
    \ of the WGs in that area than anyone else.  On the other\n   hand, the entire\
    \ IESG reviews each Internet Draft that is proposed to\n   become an RFC.  Any\
    \ AD may record a \"DISCUSS\" ballot position against\n   a draft if he or she\
    \ has serious concerns.  If these concerns cannot\n   be resolved by discussion,\
    \ an override procedure is defined such that\n   at least two IESG members must\
    \ express concerns before a draft can be\n   blocked from moving forward.  These\
    \ procedures help ensure that an\n   AD's \"pet project\" doesn't make it onto\
    \ the standards track if it\n   will have a negative effect on the rest of the\
    \ IETF protocols and\n   that an AD's \"pet peeve\" cannot indefinitely block\
    \ something.\n   This is not to say that the IESG never wields power.  When the\
    \ IESG\n   sees a Working Group veering from its charter, or when a WG asks the\n\
    \   IESG to make the WG's badly designed protocol a standard, the IESG\n   will\
    \ act.  In fact, because of its high workload, the IESG usually\n   moves in a\
    \ reactive fashion.  It eventually approves most WG requests\n   for Internet\
    \ Drafts to become RFCs, and usually only steps in when\n   something has gone\
    \ very wrong.  Another way to think about this is\n   that the ADs are selected\
    \ to think, not to just run the process.  The\n   quality of the IETF standards\
    \ comes both from the review they get in\n   the Working Groups and the scrutiny\
    \ that the WG review gets from the\n   ADs.\n   The IETF is run by rough consensus,\
    \ and it is the IESG that judges\n   whether a WG has come up with a result that\
    \ has community consensus.\n   (See Section 5.2 for more information on WG consensus.)\
    \  Because of\n   this, one of the main reasons that the IESG might block something\n\
    \   that was produced in a WG is that the result did not really gain\n   consensus\
    \ in the IETF as a whole, that is, among all of the Working\n   Groups in all\
    \ areas.  For instance, the result of one WG might clash\n   with a technology\
    \ developed in a different Working Group.  An\n   important job of the IESG is\
    \ to watch over the output of all the WGs\n   to help prevent IETF protocols that\
    \ are at odds with each other.\n   This is why ADs are supposed to review the\
    \ drafts coming out of areas\n   other than their own.\n"

  - "3.2.3.  IAB (Internet Architecture Board)\n   The IAB is responsible for keeping\
    \ an eye on the \"big picture\" of the\n   Internet, and it focuses on long-range\
    \ planning and coordination\n   among the various areas of IETF activity.  The\
    \ IAB stays informed\n   about important long-term issues in the Internet, and\
    \ it brings these\n   topics to the attention of people it thinks should know\
    \ about them.\n   The IAB web site is at http://www.iab.org/.\n   IAB members\
    \ pay special attention to emerging activities in the IETF.\n   When a new IETF\
    \ Working Group is proposed, the IAB reviews its\n   charter for architectural\
    \ consistency and integrity.  Even before the\n   group is chartered, the IAB\
    \ members are more than willing to discuss\n   new ideas with the people proposing\
    \ them.\n   The IAB also sponsors and organizes the Internet Research Task Force\n\
    \   and convenes invitational workshops that provide in-depth reviews of\n   specific\
    \ Internet architectural issues.  Typically, the workshop\n   reports make recommendations\
    \ to the IETF community and to the IESG.\n   The IAB also:\n   o  Approves NomCom's\
    \ IESG nominations\n   o  Acts as the appeals board for appeals against IESG actions\n\
    \   o  Appoints and oversees the RFC Editor\n   o  Approves the appointment of\
    \ the IANA\n   o  Acts as an advisory body to ISOC\n   o  Oversees IETF liaisons\
    \ with other standards bodies\n   Like the IESG, the IAB members are selected\
    \ for multi-year positions\n   by the NomCom and are approved by the ISOC Board\
    \ of Trustees.\n"
- title: 3.2.4.  IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
  contents:
  - "3.2.4.  IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)\n   The core registrar for\
    \ the IETF's activities is the IANA.  Many\n   Internet protocols require that\
    \ someone keep track of protocol items\n   that were added after the protocol\
    \ came out.  Typical examples of the\n   kinds of registries needed are for TCP\
    \ port numbers and MIME types.\n   The IAB has designated the IANA organization\
    \ to perform these tasks,\n   and the IANA's activities are financially supported\
    \ by ICANN, the\n   Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.\n   Ten\
    \ years ago, no one would have expected to see the IANA mentioned\n   on the front\
    \ page of a newspaper.  IANA's role had always been very\n   low key.  The fact\
    \ that IANA was also the keeper of the root of the\n   domain name system forced\
    \ it to become a much more public entity, one\n   that was badly maligned by a\
    \ variety of people who never looked at\n   what its role was.  Nowadays, the\
    \ IETF is generally no longer\n   involved in the IANA's domain name and IP address\
    \ assignment\n   functions, which are overseen by ICANN.\n   Even though being\
    \ a registrar may not sound interesting, many IETF\n   participants will testify\
    \ to how important IANA has been for the\n   Internet.  Having a stable, long-term\
    \ repository run by careful and\n   conservative operators makes it much easier\
    \ for people to experiment\n   without worrying about messing things up.  IANA's\
    \ founder, Jon\n   Postel, was heavily relied upon to keep things in order while\
    \ the\n   Internet kept growing by leaps and bounds, and he did a fine job of\n\
    \   it until his untimely death in 1998.\n"
- title: 3.2.5.  RFC Editor
  contents:
  - "3.2.5.  RFC Editor\n   The RFC Editor edits, formats, and publishes Internet\
    \ Drafts as RFCs,\n   working in conjunction with the IESG.  An important secondary\
    \ role is\n   to provide one definitive repository for all RFCs (see\n   http://www.rfc-editor.org).\
    \  Once an RFC is published, it is never\n   revised.  If the standard it describes\
    \ changes, the standard will be\n   re-published in another RFC that \"obsoletes\"\
    \ the first.\n   One of the most popular misconceptions in the IETF community\
    \ is that\n   the role of the RFC Editor is performed by IANA.  In fact, the RFC\n\
    \   Editor is a separate job, although both the RFC Editor and IANA\n   involved\
    \ the same people for many years.  The IAB approves the\n   organization that\
    \ will act as RFC Editor and the RFC Editor's general\n   policy.  The RFC Editor\
    \ is funded by IASA and can be contacted by\n   email at mailto:rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.6.  IETF Secretariat\n   There are, in fact, a few people who are paid to\
    \ maintain the IETF.\n   The IETF Secretariat provides day-to-day logistical support,\
    \ which\n   mainly means coordinating face-to-face meetings and running the\n\
    \   IETF-specific mailing lists (not the WG mailing lists).  The\n   Secretariat\
    \ is also responsible for keeping the official Internet\n   Drafts directory up\
    \ to date and orderly, maintaining the IETF web\n   site, and helping the IESG\
    \ do its work.  It provides various tools\n   for use by the community and the\
    \ IESG.  The IETF Secretariat is under\n   contract to IASA, which in turn is\
    \ financially supported by the fees\n   of the face-to-face meetings.\n"
- title: 3.3.  IETF Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "3.3.  IETF Mailing Lists\n   Anyone who plans to attend an IETF meeting should\
    \ join the IETF\n   announcement mailing list, mailto:ietf-announce@ietf.org.\
    \  This is\n   where all of the meeting information, RFC announcements, and IESG\n\
    \   Protocol Actions and Last Calls are posted.  People who would like to\n  \
    \ \"get technical\" may also join the IETF general discussion list,\n   ietf@ietf.org.\
    \  This is where discussions of cosmic significance are\n   held (Working Groups\
    \ have their own mailing lists for discussions\n   related to their work).  Another\
    \ mailing list, mailto:i-d-\n   announce@ietf.org, announces each new version\
    \ of every Internet Draft\n   as it is published.\n   Subscriptions to these and\
    \ other IETF-run mailing lists are handled\n   by a program called \"mailman\"\
    .  Mailman can be somewhat finicky about\n   the format of subscription messages,\
    \ and sometimes interacts poorly\n   with email programs that make all email messages\
    \ into HTML files.\n   Mailman will treat you well, however, if you format your\
    \ messages\n   just the way it likes.\n   To join the IETF announcement list,\
    \ for example, send email to\n   mailto:ietf-announce-request@ietf.org.  Enter\
    \ the word 'subscribe'\n   (without the quotes) in the Subject line of the message\
    \ and in the\n   message body.  To join the IETF discussion list, send email to\n\
    \   <mailto:ietf-request@ietf.org> and enter the word 'subscribe' as\n   explained\
    \ above.  If you decide to withdraw from either list, use the\n   word 'unsubscribe'.\
    \  Your messages to mailman should have nothing\n   other than the commands 'subscribe'\
    \ or 'unsubscribe' in them.  Both\n   lists are archived on the IETF web site,\n\
    \   http://www.ietf.org/maillist.html.\n   Do not, ever, under any circumstances,\
    \ for any reason, send a request\n   to join a list to the list itself!  The thousands\
    \ of people on the\n   list don't need, or want, to know when a new person joins.\n\
    \   Similarly, when changing email addresses or leaving a list, send your\n  \
    \ request only to the \"-request\" address, not to the main list.  This\n   means\
    \ you!!\n   The IETF discussion list is unmoderated.  This means that all can\n\
    \   express their opinions about issues affecting the Internet.  However,\n  \
    \ it is not a place for companies or individuals to solicit or\n   advertise,\
    \ as noted in [BCP45], \"IETF Discussion List Charter\".  It\n   is a good idea\
    \ to read the whole RFC (it's short!) before posting to\n   the IETF discussion\
    \ list.  Actually, the list does have two\n   \"sergeants at arms\" who keep an\
    \ eye open for inappropriate postings,\n   and there is a process for banning\
    \ persistent offenders from the\n   list, but fortunately this is extremely rare.\n\
    \   Only the Secretariat and certain IETF office holders can approve\n   messages\
    \ sent to the announcement list, although those messages can\n   come from a variety\
    \ of people.\n   Even though the IETF mailing lists \"represent\" the IETF membership\
    \ at\n   large, it is important to note that attending an IETF meeting does\n\
    \   not mean you'll be automatically added to either mailing list.\n"
- title: 4.  IETF Meetings
  contents:
  - "4.  IETF Meetings\n   The computer industry is rife with conferences, seminars,\n\
    \   expositions, and all manner of other kinds of meetings.  IETF face-\n   to-face\
    \ meetings are nothing like these.  The meetings, held three\n   times a year,\
    \ are week-long \"gatherings of the tribes\" whose primary\n   goal is to reinvigorate\
    \ the WGs to get their tasks done, and whose\n   secondary goal is to promote\
    \ a fair amount of mixing between the WGs\n   and the areas.  The cost of the\
    \ meetings is paid by the people\n   attending and by the corporate host for each\
    \ meeting (if any),\n   although IASA kicks in additional funds for things such\
    \ as the audio\n   broadcast of some Working Group sessions.\n   For many people,\
    \ IETF meetings are a breath of fresh air when\n   compared to the standard computer\
    \ industry conferences.  There is no\n   exposition hall, few tutorials, and no\
    \ big-name industry pundits.\n   Instead, there is lots of work, as well as a\
    \ fair amount of time for\n   socializing.  IETF meetings are of little interest\
    \ to sales and\n   marketing folks, but of high interest to engineers and developers.\n\
    \   Most IETF meetings are held in North America, because that's where\n   most\
    \ of the participants are from; however, meetings are held on\n   other continents\
    \ about once every year.  The past few meetings have\n   had about 1,300 attendees.\
    \  There have been more than 65 IETF\n   meetings so far, and a list of upcoming\
    \ meetings is available on the\n   IETF web pages, http://www.ietf.org/meetings/0mtg-sites.txt.\n\
    \   Newcomers to IETF face-to-face meetings are often in a bit of shock.\n   They\
    \ expect them to be like other standards bodies, or like computer\n   conferences.\
    \  Fortunately, the shock wears off after a day or two,\n   and many new attendees\
    \ get quite animated about how much fun they are\n   having.  One particularly\
    \ jarring feature of recent IETF meetings is\n   the use of wireless Internet\
    \ connections throughout the meeting\n   space.  It is common to see people in\
    \ a WG meeting apparently reading\n   email or perusing the web during presentations\
    \ they find\n   uninteresting.  Remember, however, that they may also be consulting\n\
    \   the drafts under discussion, looking up relevant material online, or\n   following\
    \ another meeting using instant messaging.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Registration
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Registration\n   To attend an IETF meeting, you have to register and you\
    \ have to pay\n   the registration fee.  The meeting site and advance registration\
    \ are\n   announced about two months ahead of the meeting -- earlier if\n   possible.\
    \  An announcement goes out via email to the IETF-announce\n   mailing list, and\
    \ information is posted on the IETF web site,\n   http://www.ietf.org, that same\
    \ day.\n   To pre-register, you must submit your registration on the web.  You\n\
    \   may pre-register and pre-pay, pre-register and return to the web site\n  \
    \ later to pay with a credit card, pre-register and pay on-site at the\n   meeting,\
    \ or register and pay on-site.  To get a lower registration\n   fee, you must\
    \ pay by the early registration deadline (about one week\n   before the meeting).\
    \  The registration fee covers all of the week's\n   meetings, the Sunday evening\
    \ reception (cash bar), daily continental\n   breakfasts, and afternoon coffee\
    \ and snack breaks.\n   Credit card payments on the web are encrypted and secure,\
    \ or, if you\n   prefer, you can use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) to send your payment\n\
    \   information to the Registrar (mailto:ietf-registrar@ietf.org).\n   Registration\
    \ is open throughout the week of the meeting.  However,\n   the Secretariat highly\
    \ recommends that attendees arrive for early\n   registration, usually beginning\
    \ at noon on Sunday and continuing\n   throughout the Sunday evening reception.\
    \  The reception is a popular\n   event where you can get a small bite to eat\
    \ and socialize with other\n   early arrivals.\n   Registered attendees (and there\
    \ aren't any other kind) receive a\n   registration packet.  It contains much\
    \ useful information, including\n   a general orientation sheet, the most recent\
    \ agenda, and a name tag.\n   Attendees who pre-paid will also find their receipt\
    \ in their packet.\n   It's worth noting that neither attendee names and addresses\
    \ nor IETF\n   mailing lists are ever offered for sale.\n   In your registration\
    \ packet is a sheet titled \"Note Well\".  You\n   should indeed read it carefully\
    \ because it lays out the rules for\n   IETF intellectual property rights.\n \
    \  If you need to leave messages for other attendees, you can do so at\n   the\
    \ cork boards that are often near the registration desk.  These\n   cork boards\
    \ will also have last-minute meeting changes and room\n   changes.\n   You can\
    \ also turn in lost-and-found items to the registration desk.\n   At the end of\
    \ the meeting, anything left over from the lost and found\n   will usually be\
    \ turned over to the hotel or brought back to the\n   Secretariat's office.\n\
    \   Incidentally, the IETF registration desk is often a convenient place\n   to\
    \ arrange to meet people.  If someone says \"meet me at\n   registration\", they\
    \ almost always mean the IETF registration desk,\n   not the hotel registration\
    \ desk.\n"

    \ to\n   benefit from cross-fertilization between Working Groups and from\n  \
    \ corridor discussions.  As noted below, the agenda is fluid, and there\n   have\
    \ been many instances of participants missing important sessions\n   due to last-minute\
    \ scheduling changes after their travel plans were\n   fixed.  Being present the\
    \ whole week is the only way to avoid this\n   annoyance.\n   If you cannot find\
    \ meetings all week to interest you, you can still\n   make the most of the IETF\
    \ meeting by working between sessions.  Most\n   IETF attendees carry laptop computers,\
    \ and it is common to see many\n   of them in the terminal room or in the hallways\
    \ working during\n   meeting sessions.  There is often good wireless Internet\
    \ coverage in\n   many places of the meeting venue (restaurants, coffee shops,\

    \ is\n   organized and conducted by the IETF EDU team and is intended to\n   provide\
    \ useful introductory information.  The session covers what's\n   in the attendee\

    \ morning in suits, to discover that everybody else is wearing T-\n   shirts,\
    \ jeans (shorts, if weather permits) and sandals.  There are\n   those in the\
    \ IETF who refuse to wear anything other than suits.\n   Fortunately, they are\
    \ well known (for other reasons) so they are\n   forgiven this particular idiosyncrasy.\
    \  The general rule is \"dress\n   for the weather\" (unless you plan to work\

  contents:
  - "4.6.  Terminal Room\n   One of the most important (depending on your point of\
    \ view) things\n   the host does is provide Internet access for the meeting attendees.\n\
    \   In general, wired and wireless connectivity is excellent.  This is\n   entirely\
    \ due to the Olympian efforts of the local hosts and their\n   ability to beg,\
    \ borrow, and steal.  The people and companies that\n   donate their equipment,\
    \ services, and time are to be heartily\n   congratulated and thanked.\n   Although\
    \ preparation far in advance of the meeting is encouraged,\n   there may be some\
    \ unavoidable \"last minute\" things that can be\n   accomplished in the terminal\
    \ room.  It may also be useful to people\n   who need to make trip reports or\
    \ status reports while things are\n   still fresh in their minds.\n   You need\
    \ to be wearing your badge in order to get into the terminal\n   room.  The terminal\
    \ room provides lots of power strips, lots of\n   Ethernet ports for laptops,\
    \ wireless (for the people who don't need\n   Ethernet but want power), usually\
    \ a printer for public use, and\n   sometimes workstations.  What it doesn't provide\
    \ are terminals; the\n   name is historical.  The help desk in the terminal room\
    \ is a good\n   place to ask questions about network failures, although they might\n\
    \   point you off to different networking staff.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.7.  Meals and Other Delights\n   Marshall Rose once remarked that the IETF\

    \ own; lunches and\n   dinners are not included in the registration fee.  The\
    \ Secretariat\n   does provide appetizers at the Sunday evening reception (not\
    \ meant to\n   be a replacement for dinner), continental breakfast every morning,\n\
    \   and (best of all) cookies, brownies, and other yummies during\n   afternoon\
    \ breaks.\n   If you prefer to get out of the hotel for meals, the local host\n\

- title: 4.8.  Social Event
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Social Event\n   Another of the most important things organized and managed\

    \   computer- or high-tech-related event.  At one Boston IETF, for\n   example,\
    \ the social was dinner at the Computer Museum.  Other times,\n   the social might\
    \ be a dinner cruise or a trip to an art gallery.\n   Note, however, that not\
    \ all IETF meetings have social events.\n   Newcomers to the IETF are encouraged\
    \ to attend the social event.  All\n   are encouraged to wear their name tags\

- title: 4.9.  Agenda
  contents:
  - "4.9.  Agenda\n   The agenda for the IETF meetings is a very fluid thing.  It\
    \ is\n   typically sent to the IETF announcement list a few times prior to the\n\
    \   meeting, and it is also available on the web.  The final agenda is\n   included\
    \ in the registration packets.  Of course, \"final\" in the IETF\n   doesn't mean\
    \ the same thing as it does elsewhere in the world.  The\n   final agenda is simply\
    \ the version that went to the printer.  The\n   Secretariat will post agenda\
    \ changes on the bulletin board near the\n   IETF registration desk (not the hotel\
    \ registration desk).  These late\n   changes are not capricious: they are made\
    \ \"just in time\" as session\n   chairs and speakers become aware of unanticipated\
    \ clashes.  The IETF\n   is too dynamic for agendas to be tied down weeks in advance.\n\
    \   Assignments for breakout rooms (where the Working Groups and BOFs\n   meet)\
    \ and a map showing the room locations are also shown on the\n   agenda.  Room\
    \ assignments can change as the agenda changes.  Some\n   Working Groups meet\

    \ the Internet industry next year.  You can safely assume that going to\n   Working\
    \ Group meetings will confuse you more than it will help you\n   understand what\
    \ is happening, or will be happening, in the industry.\n   This is not to say\
    \ that no one from the industry should go to IETF\n   meetings.  As an IS manager,\
    \ you might want to consider sending\n   specific people who are responsible for\
    \ technologies that are under\n   development in the IETF.  As these people read\
    \ the current Internet\n   Drafts and the traffic on the relevant Working Group\
    \ lists, they will\n   get a sense of whether or not their presence would be worthwhile\
    \ for\n   your company or for the Working Groups.\n"

  - "4.11.3.  Networking Hardware and Software Vendors\n   The image of the IETF being\
    \ mostly ivory tower academics may have\n   been true in the past, but the jobs\
    \ of typical attendees are now in\n   industry.  In most areas of the IETF, employees\
    \ of vendors are the\n   ones writing the protocols and leading the Working Groups,\
    \ so it's\n   completely appropriate for vendors to attend.  If you create Internet\n\
    \   hardware or software, and no one from your company has ever attended\n   an\
    \ IETF meeting, it behooves you to come to a meeting if for no other\n   reason\
    \ than to tell the others how relevant the meeting was or was\n   not to your\
    \ business.\n   This is not to say that companies should close up shop during\
    \ IETF\n   meeting weeks so everyone can go to the meeting.  Marketing folks,\n\
    \   even technical marketing folks, are usually safe in staying away from\n  \
    \ the IETF as long as some of the technical people from the company are\n   at\
    \ the meeting.  Similarly, it isn't required, or likely useful, for\n   everyone\
    \ from a technical department to go, particularly if they are\n   not all reading\
    \ the Internet Drafts and following the Working Group\n   mailing lists.  Many\
    \ companies have just a few designated meeting\n   attendees who are chosen for\
    \ their ability to do complete and useful\n   trip reports.  In addition, many\
    \ companies have internal coordination\n   efforts and a standards strategy. \
    \ If a company depends on the\n   Internet for some or all of its business, the\

- title: 4.13.  Other General Things
  contents:
  - "4.13.  Other General Things\n   The IETF Secretariat, and IETFers in general,\
    \ are very approachable.\n   Never be afraid to approach someone and introduce\
    \ yourself.  Also,\n   don't be afraid to ask questions, especially when it comes\
    \ to jargon\n   and acronyms.\n   Hallway conversations are very important.  A\
    \ lot of very good work\n   gets done by people who talk together between meetings\
    \ and over\n   lunches and dinners.  Every minute of the IETF can be considered\
    \ work\n   time (much to some people's dismay).\n   A \"bar BOF\" is an unofficial\
    \ get-together, usually in the late\n   evening, during which a lot of work gets\
    \ done over drinks.  Bar BOFs\n   spring up in many different places around an\
    \ IETF meeting, such as\n   restaurants, coffee shops, and (if we are so lucky)\
    \ pools.\n   It's unwise to get between a hungry IETFer (and there isn't any other\n\
    \   kind) and coffee break brownies and cookies, no matter how\n   interesting\
    \ a hallway conversation is.\n   IETFers are fiercely independent.  It's safe\
    \ to question opinions and\n   offer alternatives, but don't expect an IETFer\
    \ to follow orders.\n   The IETF meetings, and the plenary session in particular,\
    \ are not\n   places for vendors to try to sell their wares.  People can certainly\n\
    \   answer questions about their company and its products, but bear in\n   mind\
    \ that the IETF is not a trade show.  This does not preclude\n   people from recouping\
    \ costs for IETF-related T-shirts, buttons, and\n   pocket protectors.\n   There\
    \ is always a \"materials distribution table\" near the\n   registration desk.\
    \  This desk is used to make appropriate information\n   available to the attendees\
    \ (e.g., copies of something discussed in a\n   Working Group session, descriptions\
    \ of online IETF-related\n   information).  Please check with the Secretariat\
    \ before placing\n   materials on the desk; the Secretariat has the right to remove\n\
    \   material that he or she feels is not appropriate.\n   If you rely on your\
    \ laptop during the meeting, it is a good idea to\n   bring an extra battery.\
    \  It is not always easy to find a spare outlet\n   in some meeting rooms, and\
    \ using the wireless access can draw down\n   your battery faster than you might\
    \ expect.  If you are sitting near a\n   power-strip in a meeting room, expect\
    \ to be asked to plug and unplug\n   for others around you.  Many people bring\
    \ an extension cord with\n   spare outlets, which is a good way to make friends\
    \ with your neighbor\n   in a meeting.  If you need an outlet adapter, you should\
    \ try to buy\n   it in advance because the one you need is usually easier to find\
    \ in\n   your home country.\n"
- title: 5.  Working Groups
  contents:
  - "5.  Working Groups\n   The vast majority of the IETF's work is done in many Working\
    \ Groups;\n   at the time of this writing, there are about 115 different WGs.\
    \  (The\n   term \"Working Group\" is often seen capitalized, but probably not\
    \ for\n   any good reason.)  [BCP25], \"IETF Working Group Guidelines and\n  \
    \ Procedures\", is an excellent resource for anyone participating in WG\n   discussions.\n\
    \   A WG is really just a mailing list with a bit of adult supervision.\n   You\
    \ \"join\" the WG by subscribing to the mailing list; all mailing\n   lists are\
    \ open to anyone.  Anyone can post to a WG mailing list,\n   although most lists\
    \ require non-subscribers to have their postings\n   moderated.  Each Working\
    \ Group has one or two chairs.\n   More important, each WG has a charter that\
    \ the WG is supposed to\n   follow.  The charter states the scope of discussion\
    \ for the Working\n   Group, as well as its goals.  The WG's mailing list and\
    \ face-to-face\n   meetings are supposed to focus on just what is in the charter\
    \ and not\n   to wander off on other \"interesting\" topics.  Of course, looking\
    \ a\n   bit outside the scope of the WG is occasionally useful, but the large\n\
    \   majority of the discussion should be on the topics listed in the\n   charter.\
    \  In fact, some WG charters actually specify what the WG will\n   not do, particularly\
    \ if there were some attractive but nebulous\n   topics brought up during the\
    \ drafting of the charter.  The list of\n   all WG charters makes interesting\
    \ reading for folks who want to know\n   what the different Working Groups are\
    \ supposed to be doing.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Working Group Chairs
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Working Group Chairs\n   The role of the WG chairs is described in both\
    \ [BCP11] and [BCP25].\n   The IETF EDU team also offers special training for\
    \ WG chairs on\n   Sunday afternoons preceding IETF.\n   As volunteer cat-herders,\
    \ a chair's first job is to determine the WG\n   consensus goals and milestones,\
    \ keeping the charter up to date.\n   Next, often with the help of WG secretaries\
    \ or document editors, the\n   chair must manage WG discussion, both on the list\
    \ and by scheduling\n   meetings when appropriate.  Sometimes discussions get\
    \ stuck on\n   contentious points and the chair may need to steer people toward\n\
    \   productive interaction and then declare when rough consensus has been\n  \
    \ met and the discussion is over.  Sometimes chairs also manage\n   interactions\
    \ with non-WG participants or the IESG, especially when a\n   WG document approaches\
    \ publication.  Chairs have responsibility for\n   the technical and non-technical\
    \ quality of WG output.  As you can\n   imagine given the mix of secretarial,\
    \ interpersonal, and technical\n   demands, some Working Group chairs are much\
    \ better at their jobs than\n   others.\n   When a WG has fulfilled its charter,\
    \ it is supposed to cease\n   operations.  (Most WG mailing lists continue on\
    \ after a WG is closed,\n   still discussing the same topics as the Working Group\
    \ did.)  In the\n   IETF, it is a mark of success that the WG closes up because\
    \ it\n   fulfilled its charter.  This is one of the aspects of the IETF that\n\
    \   newcomers who have experience with other standards bodies have a hard\n  \
    \ time understanding.  However, some WG chairs never manage to get\n   their WG\
    \ to finish, or keep adding new tasks to the charter so that\n   the Working Group\
    \ drags on for many years.  The output of these aging\n   WGs is often not nearly\
    \ as useful as the earlier products, and the\n   messy results are sometimes attributed\
    \ to what's called \"degenerative\n   Working Group syndrome\".\n   There is an\
    \ official distinction between WG drafts and independent\n   drafts, but in practice,\
    \ sometimes there is not much procedural\n   difference.  For example, many WG\
    \ mailing lists also discuss\n   independent drafts (at the discretion of the\
    \ WG chair).  Procedures\n   for Internet Drafts are covered in much more detail\
    \ later in this\n   document.\n   WG chairs are strongly advised to go to the\
    \ WG leadership training\n   that usually happens on the Sunday preceding the\
    \ IETF meeting.  There\n   is also usually a WG chairs lunch mid-week during the\
    \ meeting where\n   chair-specific topics are presented and discussed.  If you're\n\
    \   interested in what they hear there, take a look at the slides at\n   http://edu.ietf.org/.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Getting Things Done in a Working Group
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Getting Things Done in a Working Group\n   One fact that confuses many\
    \ novices is that the face-to-face WG\n   meetings are much less important in\
    \ the IETF than they are in most\n   other organizations.  Any decision made at\
    \ a face-to-face meeting\n   must also gain consensus on the WG mailing list.\
    \  There are numerous\n   examples of important decisions made in WG meetings\
    \ that are later\n   overturned on the mailing list, often because someone who\
    \ couldn't\n   attend the meeting pointed out a serious flaw in the logic used\
    \ to\n   come to the decision.  Finally, WG meetings aren't \"drafting\n   sessions\"\
    , as they are in some other standards bodies: in the IETF,\n   drafting is done\
    \ elsewhere.\n   Another aspect of Working Groups that confounds many people is\
    \ the\n   fact that there is no formal voting.  The general rule on disputed\n\
    \   topics is that the Working Group has to come to \"rough consensus\",\n   meaning\
    \ that a very large majority of those who care must agree.  The\n   exact method\
    \ of determining rough consensus varies from Working Group\n   to Working Group.\
    \  Sometimes consensus is determined by \"humming\" --\n   if you agree with a\
    \ proposal, you hum when prompted by the chair; if\n   you disagree, you keep\
    \ your silence.  Newcomers find it quite\n   peculiar, but it works.  It is up\
    \ to the chair to decide when the\n   Working Group has reached rough consensus.\n\
    \   The lack of formal voting has caused some very long delays for some\n   proposals,\
    \ but most IETF participants who have witnessed rough\n   consensus after acrimonious\
    \ debates feel that the delays often result\n   in better protocols.  (And, if\
    \ you think about it, how could you have\n   \"voting\" in a group that anyone\
    \ can join, and when it's impossible to\n   count the participants?)  Rough consensus\
    \ has been defined in many\n   ways; a simple version is that it means that strongly\
    \ held objections\n   must be debated until most people are satisfied that these\
    \ objections\n   are wrong.\n   Some Working Groups have complex documents or\
    \ a complex set of\n   documents (or even both).  Shaking all the bugs out of\
    \ one or more\n   complex documents is a daunting task.  In order to help relieve\
    \ this\n   problem, some Working Groups use \"issue trackers\", which are online\n\
    \   lists of the open issues with the documents, the status of the issue,\n  \
    \ proposed fixes, and so on.  Using an issue tracker not only helps the\n   WG\
    \ not to forget to do something important, it helps when someone\n   asks a question\
    \ later about why something was done in a particular\n   fashion.\n   Another\
    \ method that some Working Groups adopt is to have a Working\n   Group \"secretary\"\
    \ to handle the juggling of the documents and the\n   changes.  The secretary\
    \ can run the issue tracker if there is one, or\n   can simply be in charge of\
    \ watching that all of the decisions that\n   are made on the mailing list are\
    \ reflected in newer versions of the\n   documents.\n   One thing you might find\
    \ helpful, and possibly even entertaining,\n   during Working Group sessions is\
    \ to follow the running commentary on\n   the Jabber room associated with that\
    \ Working Group.  The running\n   commentary is often used as the basis for the\
    \ minutes of the meeting,\n   but it can also include jokes, sighs, and other\
    \ extraneous chatter.\n   Jabber is a free, streaming XML technology mainly used\
    \ for instant\n   messaging.  You can find pointers to Jabber clients for many\n\
    \   platforms at http://www.jabber.org.  The Jabber chatrooms have the\n   name\
    \ of the Working Group followed by \"@jabber.ietf.org\".  Those\n   rooms are,\
    \ in fact, available year-round, not just during IETF\n   meetings, and some are\
    \ used by active Working Group participants\n   during protocol development.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Preparing for Working Group Meetings
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Preparing for Working Group Meetings\n   The most important thing that\
    \ everyone (newcomers and seasoned\n   experts) should do before coming to a face-to-face\
    \ meeting is to read\n   the Internet Drafts and RFCs ahead of time.  WG meetings\
    \ are\n   explicitly not for education: they are for developing the group's\n\
    \   documents.  Even if you do not plan to say anything in the meeting,\n   you\
    \ should read the group's documents before attending so you can\n   understand\
    \ what is being said.\n   It's up to the WG chair to set the meeting agenda, usually\
    \ a few\n   weeks in advance.  If you want something discussed at the meeting,\
    \ be\n   sure to let the chair know about it.  The agendas for all the WG\n  \
    \ meetings are available in advance (see\n   http://www.ietf.org/meetings/wg_agenda_xx.html,\
    \ where 'xx' is the\n   meeting number), but many WG chairs are lax (if not totally\n\
    \   negligent) about turning them in.\n   The Secretariat only schedules WG meetings\
    \ a few weeks in advance,\n   and the schedule often changes as little as a week\
    \ before the first\n   day.  If you are only coming for one WG meeting, you may\
    \ have a hard\n   time booking your flight with such little notice, particularly\
    \ if the\n   Working Group's meeting changes schedule.  Be sure to keep track\
    \ of\n   the current agenda so you can schedule flights and hotels.  But, when\n\
    \   it comes down to it, you probably shouldn't be coming for just one WG\n  \
    \ meeting.  It's likely that your knowledge could be valuable in a few\n   WGs,\
    \ assuming that you've read the drafts and RFCs for those groups.\n   If you are\
    \ on the agenda at a face-to-face meeting, you should\n   probably come with a\
    \ few slides prepared.  But don't come with a\n   tutorial; people are supposed\
    \ to read the drafts in advance.\n   Projectors for laptop-based presentations\
    \ are available in all the\n   meeting rooms.\n   And here's a tip for your slides\
    \ in WG or plenary presentations:\n   don't put your company's logo on every one,\
    \ even though that is a\n   common practice outside the IETF.  The IETF frowns\
    \ on this kind of\n   corporate advertising (except for the meeting sponsor in\
    \ the plenary\n   presentation), and most presenters don't even put their logo\
    \ on their\n   opening slide.  The IETF is about technical content, not company\n\
    \   boosterism.  Slides are often plain black and white for legibility,\n   with\
    \ color used only when it really adds clarity.  Again, the content\n   is the\
    \ most important part of the slides, not how it's presented.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Working Group Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Working Group Mailing Lists\n   As we mentioned earlier, the IETF announcement\
    \ and discussion mailing\n   lists are the central mailing lists for IETF activities.\
    \  However,\n   there are many other mailing lists related to IETF work.  For\n\
    \   example, every Working Group has its own discussion list.  In\n   addition,\
    \ there are some long-term technical debates that have been\n   moved off of the\
    \ IETF list onto lists created specifically for those\n   topics.  It is highly\
    \ recommended that you follow the discussions on\n   the mailing lists of the\
    \ Working Groups that you wish to attend.  The\n   more work that is done on the\
    \ mailing lists, the less work that will\n   need to be done at the meeting, leaving\
    \ time for cross pollination\n   (i.e., attending Working Groups outside one's\
    \ primary area of\n   interest in order to broaden one's perspective).\n   The\
    \ mailing lists also provide a forum for those who wish to follow,\n   or contribute\
    \ to, the Working Groups' efforts, but can't attend the\n   IETF meetings.  That's\
    \ why IETF procedures require all decisions to\n   be confirmed \"on the list\"\
    \ and you will often hear a WG chair say,\n   \"Let's take it to the list\" to\
    \ close a discussion.\n   Many IETF discussion lists use either mailman or another\
    \ list\n   manager, Majordomo.  They usually have a \"-request\" address that\n\
    \   handles the administrative details of joining and leaving the list.\n   (See\
    \ Section 3.3 for more information on mailman.)  It is generally\n   frowned upon\
    \ when such administrivia appears on the discussion\n   mailing list.\n   Most\
    \ IETF discussion lists are archived.  That is, all of the\n   messages sent to\
    \ the list are automatically stored on a host for\n   anonymous HTTP or FTP access.\
    \  Many such archives are listed online\n   at ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf-mail-archive/\
    \ or they are in a web-based\n   archive.  If you don't find the list you're looking\
    \ for, send a\n   message to the list's \"-request\" address (not to the list\
    \ itself!).\n   The Working Group charter listings at\n   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/wg-dir.html\
    \ are a useful source;\n   note that the page has links to old, concluded WGs.\n\
    \   Some WG lists apply size limits on messages, particularly to avoid\n   large\
    \ documents or presentations landing in everyone's mailbox.  It\n   is well worth\
    \ remembering that participants do not all have broadband\n   connections (and\
    \ even those with broadband connections sometimes get\n   their mail on slow connections\
    \ when they travel), so shorter messages\n   are greatly appreciated.  Documents\
    \ can be posted as Internet Drafts;\n   presentation material can be posted to\
    \ a web site controlled by the\n   sender or sent personally to people who ask\
    \ for it.  Some WGs set up\n   special sites to hold these large documents so\
    \ that senders can post\n   there first, then just send to the list the URL of\
    \ the document.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Interim Working Group Meetings
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Interim Working Group Meetings\n   Working Groups sometimes hold interim\
    \ meetings between IETFs.\n   Interim meetings aren't a substitute for IETF meetings,\
    \ however -- a\n   group can't decide to skip a meeting in a location they're\
    \ not fond\n   of and meet in Cancun (or even someplace mundane) three weeks later,\n\
    \   for example.  Interim meetings require AD approval and need to be\n   announced\
    \ at least one month in advance.  Location and timing need to\n   allow fair access\
    \ for all participants.  Like regular IETF meetings,\n   someone needs to take\
    \ notes and send them to\n   mailto:proceedings@ietf.org, and the group needs\
    \ to take attendance.\n   Decisions tentatively made during an interim WG meeting\
    \ still must be\n   ratified on the mailing list.\n"
- title: 6.  BOFs
  contents:
  - "6.  BOFs\n   In order to form a Working Group, you need a charter and someone\
    \ who\n   is able to be chair.  In order to get those things, you need to get\n\
    \   people interested so that they can help focus the charter and\n   convince\
    \ an Area Director that the project is worthwhile.  A face-\n   to-face meeting\
    \ is useful for this.  In fact, very few WGs get\n   started by an Area Director;\
    \ most start after a face-to-face BOF\n   because attendees have expressed interest\
    \ in the topic.\n   A Birds of a Feather (BOF) meeting has to be approved by the\
    \ Area\n   Director in the relevant area before it can be scheduled.  If you\n\
    \   think you really need a new WG, approach an AD informally with your\n   proposal\
    \ and see what he or she thinks.  The next step is to request\n   a meeting slot\
    \ at the next face-to-face meeting.  Of course, you\n   don't need to wait for\
    \ that meeting to get some work done, such as\n   setting up a mailing list and\
    \ starting to discuss a charter.\n   BOF meetings have a very different tone than\
    \ do WG meetings.  The\n   purpose of a BOF is to make sure that a good charter\
    \ with good\n   milestones can be created and that there are enough people willing\
    \ to\n   do the work needed in order to create standards.  Some BOFs have\n  \
    \ Internet Drafts already in process, whereas others start from\n   scratch.\n\
    \   An advantage of having a draft before the BOF is to help focus the\n   discussion.\
    \  On the other hand, having a draft might tend to limit\n   what the other folks\
    \ in the BOF want to do in the charter.  It's\n   important to remember that most\
    \ BOFs are held in order to get support\n   for an eventual Working Group, not\
    \ to get support for a particular\n   document.\n   Many BOFs don't turn into\
    \ WGs for a variety of reasons.  A common\n   problem is that not enough people\
    \ can agree on a focus for the work.\n   Another typical reason is that the work\
    \ wouldn't end up being a\n   standard -- if, for example, the document authors\
    \ don't really want\n   to relinquish change control to a WG.  (We'll discuss\
    \ change control\n   later in this document.)  Only two meetings of a BOF can\
    \ be scheduled\n   on a particular subject; either a WG has to form or the topic\

- title: 8.1.  Getting an RFC Published
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Getting an RFC Published\n   One of the most common questions seasoned\
    \ IETFers hear from newcomers\n   is, \"How do I get an IETF standard published?\"\
    \  A much better\n   question is, \"Should I write an IETF standard?\" since the\
    \ answer is\n   not always \"yes.\"  If you do decide to try to write a document\
    \ that\n   becomes an IETF standard, be warned that the overall process may be\n\
    \   arduous, even if the individual steps are fairly straightforward.\n   Lots\
    \ of people get through the process unscathed, though, and there's\n   plenty\
    \ of written guidance that helps authors emerge with their ego\n   more or less\
    \ intact.\n   Every IETF standard is published as an RFC (a \"Request for Comments,\"\
    \n   but everyone just calls them RFCs), and every RFC starts out as an\n   Internet\
    \ Draft (often called an \"I-D\").  The basic steps for getting\n   something\
    \ published as an IETF standard are as follows:\n   1.  Publish the document as\
    \ an Internet Draft.\n   2.  Receive comments on the draft.\n   3.  Edit your\
    \ draft based on the comments.\n   4.  Repeat steps 1 through 3 a few times.\n\
    \   5.  Ask an Area Director to take the draft to the IESG (if it's an\n     \
    \  individual submission).  If the draft is an official Working\n       Group\
    \ product, the WG chair asks the AD to take it to the IESG.\n   6.  Make any changes\
    \ deemed necessary by the IESG (this might include\n       giving up on becoming\
    \ a standard).\n   7.  Wait for the document to be published by the RFC Editor.\n\
    \   A much more complete explanation of these steps is contained in\n   [BCP9],\
    \ \"The Internet Standards Process\".  Those who write drafts\n   that they hope\
    \ will become IETF standards must read BCP 9 so that\n   they can follow the path\
    \ of their document through the process.  BCP\n   9 (and various other documents\
    \ that update it) goes into great detail\n   on a topic that is very often misunderstood,\
    \ even by seasoned IETF\n   participants: different types of RFCs go through different\
    \ processes\n   and have different rankings.  There are six kinds of RFCs:\n \
    \  o  Proposed standards\n   o  Draft standards\n   o  Internet standards (sometimes\
    \ called \"full standards\")\n   o  Informational documents\n   o  Experimental\
    \ protocols\n   o  Historic documents\n   Only the first three (proposed, draft,\
    \ and full) are standards within\n   the IETF.  A good summary of this can be\
    \ found in the aptly titled\n   [RFC1796], \"Not All RFCs Are Standards\".\n \
    \  There are also three sub-series of RFCs, known as FYIs, BCPs, and\n   STDs.\
    \  The For Your Information RFC sub-series was created to\n   document overviews\
    \ and topics that are introductory or that appeal to\n   a broad audience; however,\
    \ that series has not been added to in a\n   long time.  Best Current Practice\
    \ documents describe the application\n   of various technologies in the Internet.\
    \  The STD RFC sub-series was\n   created to identify RFCs that do in fact specify\
    \ Internet standards.\n   Some STDs are actually sets of more than one RFC, and\
    \ the \"standard\"\n   designation applies to the whole set of documents.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Letting Go Gracefully
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Letting Go Gracefully\n   The biggest reason some people do not want their\
    \ documents put on the\n   IETF standards track is that they must give up change\
    \ control of the\n   protocol.  That is, as soon as you propose that your protocol\
    \ become\n   an IETF standard, you must fully relinquish control of the protocol.\n\
    \   If there is general agreement, parts of the protocol can be\n   completely\
    \ changed, whole sections can be ripped out, new things can\n   be added, and\
    \ the name can be changed.\n   Some authors find it very hard to give up control\
    \ of their pet\n   protocol.  If you are one of those people, don't even think\
    \ about\n   trying to get your protocol to become an IETF standard.  On the other\n\
    \   hand, if your goal is the best standard possible with the widest\n   implementation,\
    \ then you might find the IETF process to your liking.\n   Incidentally, the change\
    \ control on Internet standards doesn't end\n   when the protocol is put on the\
    \ standards track.  The protocol itself\n   can be changed later for a number\
    \ of reasons, the most common of\n   which is that implementors discover a problem\
    \ as they implement the\n   standard.  These later changes are also under the\
    \ control of the\n   IETF, not the editors of the standards document.\n   IETF\
    \ standards exist so that people will use them to write Internet\n   programs\
    \ that interoperate.  They don't exist to document the\n   (possibly wonderful)\
    \ ideas of their authors, nor do they exist so\n   that a company can say, \"\
    We have an IETF standard\".  If a standards-\n   track RFC only has one implementation\
    \ (whereas two are required for\n   it to advance on the standards track), it\
    \ was probably a mistake to\n   put it on the standards track in the first place.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Internet Drafts
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Internet Drafts\n   First things first.  Every document that ends up in\
    \ the RFC\n   repository starts life as an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts are\n\
    \   tentative documents -- they're meant for readers to comment on, so\n   authors\
    \ can mull over those comments and decide which ones to\n   incorporate in the\
    \ draft.  In order to remind folks of their\n   tentativeness, Internet Drafts\
    \ are automatically removed from the\n   online directories after six months.\
    \  They are most definitely not\n   standards or even specifications.  As [BCP9]\
    \ says:\n   \"An Internet Draft is NOT a means of 'publishing' a specification;\n\
    \   specifications are published through the RFC mechanism....  Internet\n   Drafts\
    \ have no formal status, and are subject to change or removal at\n   any time.\
    \  Under no circumstances should an Internet Draft be\n   referenced by any paper,\
    \ report, or Request-for-Proposal, nor should\n   a vendor claim compliance with\
    \ an Internet Draft\".\n   You can always tell a person who doesn't understand\
    \ the IETF (or is\n   intentionally trying to fool people) when he or she brags\
    \ about\n   having published an Internet Draft; it takes no significant effort.\n\
    \   When you submit an Internet Draft, you give some publication rights\n   to\
    \ the IETF.  This is so that your Internet Draft is freely available\n   to everyone\
    \ who wants to read and comment on it.  The rights you do\n   and don't give to\
    \ the IETF are described in [BCP78], \"IETF Rights in\n   Contributions\".\n \
    \  There is a very useful checking tool at\n   http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/idnits.pyht.\
    \  Using this tool\n   before you turn in an Internet Draft will help prevent\
    \ the draft from\n   being rejected due to errors in form and formatting.\n  \
    \ An I-D should have approximately the same format as an RFC.  Contrary\n   to\
    \ many people's beliefs, an I-D does not need to look exactly like\n   an RFC,\
    \ but if you can use the same formatting procedures used by the\n   RFC Editor\
    \ when you create your I-Ds, it will simplify the RFC\n   Editor's work when your\
    \ draft is published as an RFC.  [RFC2223],\n   \"Instructions to RFC Authors\"\
    , describes the nroff formatting used by\n   the RFC Editor.  There is also a\
    \ tool called \"xml2rfc\", available\n   from http://xml.resource.org/, that takes\
    \ XML-formatted text and\n   turns it into a valid Internet Draft.\n   An Internet\
    \ Draft can be either a Working Group draft or an\n   individual submission. \
    \ Working Group drafts are usually reviewed by\n   the Working Group before being\
    \ accepted as a WG item, although the\n   chairs have the final say.\n   If you're\
    \ interested in checking the status of a particular draft, or\n   can't remember\
    \ its exact name, or want to find out which drafts a WG\n   is working on, two\
    \ handy tools are available.  The \"Internet Drafts\n   Database Interface\",\
    \ at\n   https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/idindex.cgi, lets you search for\n\
    \   a draft by author, Working Group, date, or filename.  The \"I-D\n   Tracker\"\
    , at https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/pidtracker.cgi, is\n   especially useful\
    \ for authors who want to track the progress of their\n   draft as it makes its\
    \ way through the publication process.\n   There are some informal rules for Internet\
    \ Draft naming that have\n   evolved over the years.  Internet Drafts that revise\
    \ existing RFCs\n   often have draft names with \"bis\" in them, meaning \"again\"\
    \ or\n   \"twice\"; for example, a draft might be called \"draft-someone-\n  \
    \ rfc2345bis-00.txt\".\n"

    \ Draft, send it to the\n   Internet Drafts administrator at mailto:internet-drafts@ietf.org.\n\
    \   There is a real person at the other end of this mail address, whose\n   job\
    \ is to make sure you've included the minimum items you need for\n   the Internet\
    \ Draft to be published.  When you submit the first\n   version of the draft,\
    \ you also tell the draft administrator your\n   proposed filename for the draft.\
    \  If the draft is an official Working\n   Group product, the name will start\
    \ with \"draft-ietf-\" followed by the\n   designation of the WG, followed by\
    \ a descriptive word or two,\n   followed by \"00.txt\".\n   For example, a draft\
    \ in the S/MIME WG about creating keys might be\n   named \"draft-ietf-smime-keying-00.txt\"\
    .  If it's not the product of a\n   Working Group, the name will start with \"\

    \ word or two, followed by\n   \"00.txt\".  For example, a draft that someone\

- title: 8.4.  Standards-Track RFCs
  contents:
  - "8.4.  Standards-Track RFCs\n   The procedure for creating and advancing a standard\
    \ is described in\n   [BCP9].  After an Internet Draft has been sufficiently discussed\
    \ and\n   there is rough consensus that what it says would be a useful\n   standard,\
    \ it is presented to the IESG for consideration.  If the\n   draft is an official\
    \ WG draft, the WG chair sends it to the\n   appropriate Area Director after it\
    \ has gone through Working Group\n   last call.  If the draft is an individual\
    \ submission, the draft's\n   author or editor submits it to the appropriate Area\
    \ Director.  BCP 9\n   also describes the appeals process for people who feel\
    \ that a Working\n   Group chair, an AD, or the IESG has made the wrong decision\
    \ in\n   considering the creation or advancement of a standard.\n   After the\
    \ I-D is submitted to the IESG, the IESG announces an IETF-\n   wide last call.\
    \  This helps get the attention of people who weren't\n   following the progress\
    \ of the draft, and it can sometimes cause\n   further changes to the draft. \
    \ It is also a time when people in the\n   WG who feel that they weren't heard\
    \ can make their comments to\n   everyone.  The IETF last call is two weeks for\
    \ drafts coming from WGs\n   and four weeks for individual submissions.\n   If\
    \ the IESG approves the draft to become an Internet standard, they\n   ask the\
    \ RFC Editor to publish it as a Proposed standard.  After it\n   has been a Proposed\
    \ standard for at least six months, the RFC's\n   author (or the appropriate WG\
    \ chair) can ask for it to become a Draft\n   standard.  Before that happens,\
    \ however, someone needs to convince\n   the appropriate Area Director that there\
    \ are at least two\n   independent, interoperable implementations of each part\
    \ of the\n   standard.  This is a good test of the usefulness of the standard\
    \ as a\n   whole, as well as an excellent way to check if the standard was\n \
    \  really readable.\n   A few things typically happen at this point.  First, it's\
    \ common to\n   find that some of the specifications in the standard need to be\n\
    \   reworded because one implementor thought they meant one thing whereas\n  \
    \ another implementor thought they meant something else.  Another\n   common occurrence\
    \ is that none of the implementations actually tried\n   to implement a few of\
    \ the features of the standard; these features\n   get removed not just because\
    \ no one tested them but also because they\n   weren't needed.\n   Don't be surprised\
    \ if a particular standard doesn't progress from\n   Proposed to Draft.  In fact,\
    \ most of the standards in common use are\n   Proposed standards and never move\
    \ forward.  This may be because no\n   one took the time to try to get them to\
    \ Draft, or some of the\n   normative references in the standard are still at\
    \ Proposed standard,\n   or it may be that everyone found more important things\
    \ to do.\n   A few years after a document has been a Draft standard, it can become\n\
    \   an Internet standard, also known as \"full standard\" (it can happen in\n\
    \   as little as four months, but this is rare).  This doesn't happen\n   often,\
    \ and it is usually reserved for protocols that are absolutely\n   required for\
    \ the Internet to function.  The IESG goes over the\n   document with a fine-tooth\
    \ comb and looks for evidence of widespread\n   deployment before making a Draft\
    \ standard an Internet standard.\n"
- title: 8.4.1.  Telling It Like It Is -- Using MUST and SHOULD and MAY
  contents:
  - "8.4.1.  Telling It Like It Is -- Using MUST and SHOULD and MAY\n   Writing specifications\
    \ that get implemented the way you want is a bit\n   of an art.  You can keep\
    \ the specification very short, with just a\n   list of requirements, but that\
    \ tends to cause implementors to take\n   too much leeway.  If you instead make\
    \ the specification very wordy\n   with lots of suggestions, implementors tend\
    \ to miss the requirements\n   (and often disagree with your suggestions anyway).\
    \  An optimal\n   specification is somewhere in between.\n   One way to make it\
    \ more likely that developers will create\n   interoperable implementations of\
    \ standards is to be clear about\n   what's being mandated in a specification.\
    \  Early RFCs used all kinds\n   of expressions to explain what was needed, so\
    \ implementors didn't\n   always know which parts were suggestions and which were\
    \ requirements.\n   As a result, standards writers in the IETF generally agreed\
    \ to limit\n   their wording to a few specific words with a few specific meanings.\n\
    \   [STD3], \"Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support\",\n\
    \   written way back in 1989, had a short list of words that had appeared\n  \
    \ to be useful, namely, \"must\", \"should\", and \"may\".  These definitions\n\
    \   were updated and further refined in [BCP14], \"Key words for use in\n   RFCs\
    \ to Indicate Requirement Levels\", which is widely referenced in\n   current\
    \ Internet standards.  BCP 14 also specifically defines \"must\n   not\" and \"\
    should not\", and it lists a few synonyms for the words\n   defined.\n   In a\
    \ standard, in order to make it clear that you're using the\n   definitions from\
    \ BCP 14, you should do two things.  First, refer to\n   BCP 14 (although most\
    \ people refer to it as RFC 2119, because that's\n   what BCP 14 tells you to\
    \ do), so that the reader knows how you're\n   defining your words.  Second, you\
    \ should point out which instances of\n   the words you are using come from BCP\
    \ 14.  The accepted practice for\n   this is to capitalize the words.  That is\
    \ why you see \"MUST\" and\n   \"SHOULD\" capitalized in IETF standards.\n   BCP\
    \ 14 is a short document, and it should be read by everyone who is\n   reading\
    \ or writing IETF standards.  Although the definitions of\n   \"must\" and \"\
    must not\" are fairly clear, the definitions of \"should\"\n   and \"should not\"\
    \ cause a great deal of discussion in many WGs.  When\n   reviewing an Internet\
    \ Draft, the question is often raised, \"Should\n   that sentence have a MUST\
    \ or a SHOULD in it?\"  This is, indeed, a\n   very good question, because specifications\
    \ shouldn't have gratuitous\n   MUSTs, but also should not have SHOULDs where\
    \ a MUST is needed for\n   interoperability.  This goes to the crux of the question\
    \ of over-\n   specifying and under-specifying requirements in standards.\n"

  contents:
  - "8.4.2.  Normative References in Standards\n   One aspect of writing IETF standards\
    \ that trips up many novices (and\n   quite a few long-time IETF folks) is the\
    \ rule about how to make\n   \"normative references\" to non-IETF documents or\
    \ to other RFCs in a\n   standard.  A normative reference is a reference to a\
    \ document that\n   must be followed in order to implement the standard.  A non-normative\n\
    \   reference (sometimes called an \"informative reference\") is one that\n  \
    \ is helpful to an implementor but is not needed.\n   An IETF standard may make\
    \ a normative reference to any other\n   standards-track RFC that is at the same\
    \ standards level or higher, or\n   to any \"open standard\" that has been developed\
    \ outside the IETF.  The\n   \"same level or higher\" rule means that before a\
    \ standard can move\n   from Proposed to Draft, all of the RFCs for which there\
    \ is a\n   normative reference must also be at Draft or Internet standard.  This\n\
    \   rule gives implementors assurance that everything in a Draft standard\n  \
    \ or Internet standard is quite stable, even the things referenced\n   outside\
    \ the standard.  This can also delay the publication of the\n   Draft or Internet\
    \ standard by many months (sometimes even years)\n   while the other documents\
    \ catch up.\n   There is no hard-and-fast rule about what is an \"open standard\"\
    , but\n   generally this means a stable standard that anyone can get a copy of\n\
    \   (although they might have to pay for it) and that was made by a\n   generally\
    \ recognized standards group.  If the external standard\n   changes, you have\
    \ to reference the particular instantiation of that\n   standard in your specification,\
    \ as with a designation of the date of\n   the standard.  Some external standards\
    \ bodies don't make old\n   standards available, which is a problem for IETF standards\
    \ that need\n   to be used in the future.  When in doubt, a draft author should\
    \ ask\n   the WG chair or appropriate Area Director if a particular external\n\
    \   standard can be used in an IETF standard.\n"

- title: 8.4.5.  Patents in IETF Standards
  contents:
  - "8.4.5.  Patents in IETF Standards\n   The problems of intellectual property have\
    \ cropped up more and more\n   often in the past few years, particularly with\
    \ respect to patents.\n   The goal of the IETF is to have its standards widely\
    \ used and\n   validated in the marketplace.  If creating a product that uses\
    \ a\n   standard requires getting a license for a patent, people are less\n  \
    \ likely to implement the standard.  Not surprisingly, then, the\n   general rule\
    \ has been \"use good non-patented technology where\n   possible\".\n   Of course,\
    \ this isn't always possible.  Sometimes patents appear\n   after a standard has\
    \ been established.  Sometimes there's a patent on\n   something that is so valuable\
    \ that there isn't a non-patented\n   equivalent.  Sometimes the patent holder\
    \ is generous and promises to\n   give all implementors of a standard a royalty-free\
    \ license to the\n   patent, thereby making it almost as easy to implement as\
    \ it would\n   have been if no patent existed.\n   The IETF's methods for dealing\
    \ with patents in standards are a\n   subject of much debate.  The official rules\
    \ for all intellectual\n   property rights (IRP) in IETF documents (not just patents)\
    \ are\n   covered in [BCP78] and [BCP79], \"Intellectual Property Rights in IETF\n\
    \   Technology\".  Everyone who participates in IETF Working Groups will\n   probably\
    \ find these documents interesting because they lay out the\n   rules that everyone\
    \ agrees to follow.\n   Patent holders who freely allow their patents to be used\
    \ by people\n   implementing IETF standards often get a great deal of goodwill\
    \ from\n   the folks in the IETF.  Such generosity is more common than you might\n\
    \   think.  For example, RFC 1822 is a license from IBM for one of its\n   security\
    \ patents, and the security community has responded very\n   favorably to IBM\
    \ for this (whereas a number of other companies have\n   made themselves pariahs\
    \ for their intractability on their security\n   patents).\n   If you are writing\
    \ an Internet Draft and you know of a patent that\n   applies to the technology\
    \ you're writing about, don't list the patent\n   in the document.  Instead, consult\
    \ the IETF IPR Disclosure Page\n   linked off the main IETF web site to determine\
    \ how to proceed.\n   Intellectual property rights aren't mentioned in RFCs because\
    \ RFCs\n   never change after they are published, but knowledge of IPR can\n \
    \  change at any time.  Therefore, an IPR list in an RFC could be\n   incomplete\
    \ and mislead the reader.  [BCP9] provides specific text\n   that should be added\
    \ to RFCs where the author knows of IPR issues.\n"
- title: 8.5.  Informational and Experimental RFCs
  contents:
  - "8.5.  Informational and Experimental RFCs\n   As we noted earlier, not all RFCs\
    \ are standards.  In fact, plenty of\n   important RFCs are not on the standards\
    \ track at all.  Currently,\n   there are two designations for RFCs that are not\
    \ meant to be\n   standards: Informational, like the Tao, and Experimental.  (There\
    \ is\n   actually a third designation, Historic, but that is reserved for\n  \
    \ documents that were on the standards track and have been removed due\n   to\
    \ lack of current use, or that more recent thinking indicates the\n   technology\
    \ is actually harmful to the Internet.)\n   The role of Informational RFCs is\
    \ often debated in the IETF.  Many\n   people like having them, particularly for\
    \ specifications that were\n   created outside the IETF but are referenced by\
    \ IETF documents.  They\n   are also useful for specifications that are the precursors\
    \ for work\n   being done by IETF Working Groups.  On the other hand, some people\n\
    \   refer to Informational RFCs as \"standards\" even though the RFCs are\n  \
    \ not standards, usually to fool the gullible public about something\n   that\
    \ the person is selling or supporting.  When this happens, the\n   debate about\
    \ Informational RFCs is renewed.\n   Experimental RFCs are for specifications\
    \ that may be interesting, but\n   for which it is unclear if there will be much\
    \ interest in\n   implementing them, or whether they will work once deployed.\
    \  That is,\n   a specification might solve a problem, but if it is not clear\
    \ that\n   many people think that the problem is important, or think that they\n\
    \   will bother fixing the problem with the specification, the\n   specification\
    \ might be labeled an Experimental RFC.  If, later, the\n   specification becomes\
    \ popular (or proves that it works well), it can\n   be re-issued as a standards-track\
    \ RFC.  Experimental RFCs are also\n   used to get people to experiment with a\
    \ technology that looks like it\n   might be standards-track material, but for\
    \ which there are still\n   unanswered questions.\n   The IESG has created guidelines\
    \ on how it chooses between\n   Informational and Experimental status:\n   http://www.ietf.org/u/ietfchair/info-exp.html.\
    \  If you are creating a\n   document that you think might become an Experimental\
    \ RFC, knowing the\n   current thinking will help you justify your proposed choice.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.1.  What You Can Do\n   *Read* -- Review the Internet Drafts in your area of\
    \ expertise and\n   comment on them in the Working Groups.  Participate in the\
    \ discussion\n   in a friendly, helpful fashion, with the goal being the best\
    \ Internet\n   standards possible.  Listen much more than you speak.  If you\n\
    \   disagree, debate the technical issues: never attack the people.\n   *Implement*\
    \ -- Write programs that use the current Internet\n   standards.  The standards\
    \ aren't worth much unless they are available\n   to Internet users.  Implement\
    \ even the \"minor\" standards, since they\n   will become less minor if they\
    \ appear in more software.  Report any\n   problems you find with the standards\
    \ to the appropriate Working Group\n   so that the standard can be clarified in\
    \ later revisions.  One of the\n   oft-quoted tenets of the IETF is \"running\
    \ code wins\", so you can help\n   support the standards you want to become more\
    \ widespread by creating\n   more running code.\n   *Write* -- Edit or co-author\
    \ Internet Drafts in your area of\n   expertise.  Do this for the benefit of the\
    \ Internet community, not to\n   get your name (or, even worse, your company's\
    \ name) on a document.\n   Draft authors are subject to all kinds of technical\
    \ (and sometimes\n   personal) criticism; receive it with equanimity and use it\
    \ to improve\n   your draft in order to produce the best and most interoperable\n\
    \   standard.\n"
- title: 9.2.  What Your Company Can Do
  contents:
  - "9.2.  What Your Company Can Do\n   *Share* -- Avoid proprietary standards.  If\
    \ you are an implementor,\n   exhibit a strong preference for IETF standards.\
    \  If the IETF\n   standards aren't as good as the proprietary standards, work\
    \ to make\n   the IETF standards better.  If you're a purchaser, avoid products\n\
    \   that use proprietary standards that compete with the open standards\n   of\
    \ the IETF and tell the companies you buy from that you are doing\n   so.\n  \
    \ *Open Up* -- If your company controls a patent that is used in an\n   IETF standard,\
    \ convince the company to make the patent available at\n   no cost to everyone\
    \ who is implementing the standard.  In the past\n   few years, patents have caused\
    \ a lot of serious problems for Internet\n   standards because they prevent some\
    \ companies from being able to\n   freely implement the standards.  Fortunately,\
    \ many companies have\n   generously offered unlimited licenses for particular\
    \ patents in order\n   to help the IETF standards flourish.  These companies are\
    \ usually\n   rewarded with positive publicity for the fact that they are not\
    \ as\n   greedy or short-sighted as other patent-holders.\n   *Join* -- Become\
    \ a member of ISOC.  More important, urge any company\n   that has benefited from\
    \ the Internet to become a corporate member of\n   ISOC, since this has the greatest\
    \ financial benefit for the group.\n   It will, of course, also benefit the Internet\
    \ as a whole.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.1.  IETF and Other Standards Groups\n   As much as many IETF participants\
    \ would like to think otherwise, the\n   IETF does not exist in a standards vacuum.\
    \  There are many (perhaps\n   too many) other standards organizations whose decisions\
    \ affect the\n   Internet.  There are also a fair number of standards bodies that\n\
    \   ignored the Internet for a long time and now want to get a piece of\n   the\
    \ action.\n   In general, the IETF tries to have cordial relationships with other\n\
    \   significant standards bodies.  This isn't always easy, since many\n   other\
    \ bodies have very different structures than the IETF does, and\n   the IETF is\
    \ mostly run by volunteers who would probably prefer to\n   write standards rather\
    \ than meet with representatives from other\n   bodies.  Even so, some other standards\
    \ bodies make a great effort to\n   interact well with the IETF despite the obvious\
    \ cultural differences.\n   At the time of this writing, the IETF has some liaisons\
    \ with large\n   standards bodies, including the ITU (International Telecommunication\n\
    \   Union), the W3C, the Unicode Consortium, and ISO/IEC JTC1 (Joint\n   Technical\
    \ Committee of the International Organization for\n   Standardization and International\
    \ Electrotechnical Commission).  As\n   stated in the IAB Charter [BCP39], \"\
    Liaisons are kept as informal as\n   possible and must be of demonstrable value\
    \ in improving the quality\n   of IETF specifications\".  In practice, the IETF\
    \ prefers liaisons to\n   take place directly at Working Group level, with formal\
    \ relationships\n   and liaison documents in a backup role.\n   Some of these\
    \ liaison tasks fall to the IESG, whereas others fall to\n   the IAB.  Detail-oriented\
    \ readers will learn much about the formal\n   methods for dealing with other\
    \ standards bodies in [BCP102], \"IAB\n   Processes for Management of IETF Liaison\
    \ Relationships\", and\n   [BCP103], \"Procedures for Handling Liaison Statements\
    \ to and from the\n   IETF\".  The best place to check to see whether the IETF\
    \ has any\n   formal liaison at all is the list of IETF liaisons,\n   www.ietf.org/liaisonActivities.html.\
    \  The list shows that there are\n   many different liaisons to ISO/IEC JTC1 subcommittees.\n"
- title: 10.2.  Press Coverage of the IETF
  contents:
  - "10.2.  Press Coverage of the IETF\n   Given that the IETF is one of the best-known\
    \ bodies that is helping\n   move the Internet forward, it's natural for the computer\
    \ press (and\n   even the trade press) to want to cover its actions.  In recent\
    \ years,\n   a small number of magazines have assigned reporters and editors to\n\
    \   cover the IETF in depth over a long period of time.  These reporters\n   have\
    \ ample scars from articles that they got wrong, incorrect\n   statements about\
    \ the status of Internet Drafts, quotes from people\n   who are unrelated to the\
    \ IETF work, and so on.\n   Major press errors fall into two categories: saying\
    \ that the IETF is\n   considering something when in fact there is just an Internet\
    \ Draft in\n   a Working Group, and saying that the IETF approved something when\
    \ all\n   that happened was that an Informational RFC was published.  In both\n\
    \   cases, the press is not fully to blame for the problem, since they\n   are\
    \ usually alerted to the story by a company trying to get publicity\n   for a\
    \ protocol that they developed or at least support.  Of course, a\n   bit of research\
    \ by the reporters would probably get them in contact\n   with someone who could\
    \ straighten them out, such as a WG chair or an\n   Area Director.  The default\
    \ press contact for the IETF is the IAD,\n   who can be reached at mailto:iad@ietf.org.\n\
    \   The fact that those reporters who've gotten it wrong once still come\n   back\
    \ to IETF meetings shows that it is possible to get it right\n   eventually. \
    \ However, IETF meetings are definitely not for reporters\n   who are naive about\
    \ the IETF process (although if you are a reporter\n   the fact that you are reading\
    \ this document is a very good sign!).\n   Furthermore, if you think that you'll\
    \ get a hot story from attending\n   an IETF meeting, you are likely to be disappointed.\n\
    \   Considering all this, it's not surprising that some IETFers would\n   prefer\
    \ to have the press stay as far away from meetings as possible.\n   Having a bit\
    \ of press publicity for protocols that are almost near\n   completion and will\
    \ become significant in the industry in the next\n   year can be a good thing.\
    \  However, it is the rare reporter who can\n   resist over-hyping a nascent protocol\
    \ as the next savior for the\n   Internet.  Such stories do much more harm than\
    \ good, both for the\n   readers of the article and for the IETF.\n   The main\
    \ reason why a reporter might want to attend an IETF meeting\n   is not to cover\
    \ hot technologies (since that can be done in the\n   comfort of your office by\
    \ reading the mailing lists) but to meet\n   people face-to-face.  Unfortunately,\
    \ the most interesting people are\n   the ones who are also the busiest during\
    \ the IETF meeting, and some\n   folks have a tendency to run away when they see\
    \ a press badge.\n   However, IETF meetings are excellent places to meet and speak\
    \ with\n   document authors and Working Group chairs; this can be quite valuable\n\
    \   for reporters who are covering the progress of protocols.\n   Reporters who\
    \ want to find out about \"what the IETF is doing\" on a\n   particular topic\
    \ would be well-advised to talk to more than one\n   person who is active on that\
    \ topic in the IETF, and should probably\n   try to talk to the WG chair in any\
    \ case.  It's impossible to\n   determine what will happen with a draft by looking\
    \ at the draft or\n   talking to the draft's author.  Fortunately, all WGs have\
    \ archives\n   that a reporter can look through for recent indications about what\n\
    \   the progress of a draft is; unfortunately, few reporters have the\n   time\
    \ or inclination to do this kind of research.  Because the IETF\n   doesn't have\
    \ a press liaison, magazines or newspapers that run a\n   story with errors won't\
    \ hear directly from the IETF and therefore\n   often won't know what they did\
    \ wrong, so they might easily do it\n   again later.\n"

  - "Appendix B.  IETF Guiding Principles\n   If you've gotten this far in the Tao,\
    \ you've learned a lot about how\n   the IETF works.  What you'll find in this\
    \ appendix summarizes much of\n   what you've read and adds a few new points to\
    \ ponder.  Be sure to\n   read through all the principles; taken as a whole, they'll\
    \ give you a\n   new slant on what makes the IETF work.\n"
- title: B.1.  General
  contents:
  - "B.1.  General\n   P1.   The IETF works by an open process and by rough consensus.\
    \  This\n         applies to all aspects of the operation of the IETF, including\n\
    \         creation of IETF documents and decisions on the processes that\n   \
    \      are used.  But the IETF also observes experiments and running\n       \
    \  code with interest, and this should also apply to the\n         operational\
    \ processes of the organization.\n   P2.   The IETF works in areas where it has,\
    \ or can find, technical\n         competence.\n   P3.   The IETF depends on a\
    \ volunteer core of active participants.\n   P4.   Membership of the IETF or of\
    \ its WGs is not fee-based or\n         organizationally defined, but is based\
    \ upon self-identification\n         and active participation by individuals.\n"
- title: B.2.  Management and Leadership
  contents:
  - "B.2.  Management and Leadership\n   P5.   The IETF recognizes leadership positions\
    \ and grants power of\n         decision to the leaders, but decisions are subject\
    \ to appeal.\n   P6.   Delegation of power and responsibility are essential to\
    \ the\n         effective working of the IETF.  As many individuals as possible\n\
    \         will be encouraged to take on leadership of IETF tasks.\n   P7.   Dissent,\
    \ complaint, and appeal are a consequence of the IETF's\n         nature and should\
    \ be regarded as normal events, but ultimately\n         it is a fact of life\
    \ that certain decisions cannot be\n         effectively appealed.\n   P8.   Leadership\
    \ positions are for fixed terms (although we have no\n         formal limitation\
    \ on the number of terms that may be served).\n   P9.   It is important to develop\
    \ future leaders within the active\n         community.\n   P10.  A community\
    \ process is used to select the leadership.\n   P11.  Leaders are empowered to\
    \ make the judgment that rough\n         consensus has been demonstrated.  Without\
    \ formal membership,\n         there are no formal rules for consensus.\n"
- title: B.3.  Process
  contents:
  - "B.3.  Process\n   P12.  Although the IETF needs clear and publicly documented\
    \ process\n         rules for the normal cases, there should be enough flexibility\n\
    \         to allow unusual cases to be handled according to common sense.\n  \
    \       We apply personal judgment and only codify when we're certain.\n     \
    \    (But we do codify who can make personal judgments.)\n   P13.  Technical development\
    \ work should be carried out by tightly\n         chartered and focused Working\
    \ Groups.\n   P14.  Parts of the process that have proved impractical should be\n\
    \         removed or made optional.\n"
- title: B.4.  Working Groups
  contents:
  - "B.4.  Working Groups\n   P15.  Working Groups (WGs) should be primarily responsible\
    \ for the\n         quality of their output, and therefore for obtaining early\n\
    \         review; WG chairs as WG leaders, backed up by the IETF\n         leadership,\
    \ should act as a quality backstop.\n   P16.  WGs should be primarily responsible\
    \ for assessing the negative\n         impact of their work on the Internet as\
    \ a whole, and therefore\n         for obtaining cross-area review; the IETF leadership\
    \ should act\n         as a cross-area backstop.\n   P17.  Early review of documents\
    \ is more effective in dealing with\n         major problems than late review.\n\
    \   P18.  Area Directors (ADs) are responsible for guiding the formation\n   \
    \      and chartering of WGs, for giving them direction as necessary,\n      \
    \   and for terminating them.\n   P19.  WG chairs are responsible for ensuring\
    \ that WGs execute their\n         charters, meet their milestones, and produce\
    \ deliverables that\n         are ready for publication.\n   P20.  ADs are responsible\
    \ for arranging backstop review and final\n         document approval.\n"
- title: B.5.  Documents
  contents:
  - "B.5.  Documents\n   P21.  IETF documents often start as personal drafts, may\
    \ become WG\n         drafts, and are approved for permanent publication by a\n\
    \         leadership body independent of the WG or individuals that\n        \
    \ produced them.\n   P22.  IETF documents belong to the community, not to their\
    \ authors.\n         But authorship is recognized and valued, as are lesser\n\
    \         contributions than full authorship.\n   P23.  Technical quality and\
    \ correctness are the primary criteria for\n         reaching consensus about\
    \ documents.\n   P24.  IETF specifications may be published as Informational,\n\
    \         Experimental, Standards Track, or Best Current Practice.\n   P25.  IETF\
    \ Standards Track specifications are not considered to be\n         satisfactory\
    \ standards until interoperable independent\n         implementations have been\
    \ demonstrated.  (This is the\n         embodiment of the \"running code\" slogan.)\
    \  But, on legal\n         advice, the IETF does not take responsibility for\n\
    \         interoperability tests and does not certify interoperability.\n   P26.\
    \  IETF processes are currently published as Best Current Practice\n         documents.\n\
    \   P27.  Useful information that is neither a specification nor a\n         process\
    \ may be published as Informational.\n   P28.  Obsolete or deprecated specifications\
    \ and processes may be\n         downgraded to Historic.\n   P29.  The standards\
    \ track should distinguish specifications that have\n         been demonstrated\
    \ to interoperate.\n   P30.  Standards Track and Best Current Practice documents\
    \ must be\n         subject to IETF wide rough consensus (Last Call process).\
    \  WG\n         rough consensus is normally sufficient for other documents.\n\
    \   P31.  Substantive changes made after a document leaves a WG must be\n    \
    \     referred back to the WG.\n   P32.  The IETF determines requirements for\
    \ publication and archiving\n         of its documents.\n"
