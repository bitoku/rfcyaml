- title: 2.1.  Solicited Multicast RAs on Large Networks
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Solicited Multicast RAs on Large Networks\n   On links with a large number\
    \ of battery-powered devices, sending\n   solicited multicast Router Advertisements\
    \ can severely impact host\n   power consumption.  This is because every time\
    \ a device joins the\n   network, all devices on the network receive a multicast\
    \ Router\n   Advertisement.  In the worst case, if devices are continually joining\n\
    \   and leaving the network, and the network is large enough, then all\n   devices\
    \ on the network will receive solicited Router Advertisements\n   at the maximum\
    \ rate specified by Section 6.2.6 of [RFC4861], which is\n   one every 3 seconds.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Frequent Periodic Router Advertisements
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Frequent Periodic Router Advertisements\n   Some networks send periodic\
    \ multicast Router Advertisements very\n   frequently (e.g., once every few seconds).\
    \  This may be due to a\n   desire to minimize customer impact of network renumbering\
    \ events,\n   which in some large residential networks occur relatively frequently.\n\
    \   In the presence of hosts that ignore RAs or even all IPv6 packets\n   when\
    \ in sleep mode, such networks may see a need to send RAs\n   frequently in order\
    \ to avoid leaving devices with non-functional IPv6\n   configurations for extended\
    \ periods of time.  Unfortunately, this has\n   severe impact on battery life.\n"
- title: 3.  Consequences
  contents:
  - "3.  Consequences\n   Observed effects of frequently sending Router Advertisement\
    \ messages\n   to battery-powered devices include:\n   o  Some hosts simply experience\
    \ bad battery life on these networks\n      and otherwise operate normally.  This\
    \ is frustrating for users of\n      these networks.\n   o  Some hosts react by\
    \ dropping all Router Advertisement messages\n      when in power-saving mode\
    \ on any network, e.g.,\n      <https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=32662>.\
    \  This\n      causes devices to lose connectivity when in power-saving mode,\n\
    \      potentially disrupting background network communications, because\n   \
    \   the device is no longer able to send packets or acknowledge\n      received\
    \ traffic.\n   o  Some hosts react by dropping *all* IPv6 packets when in power-\n\
    \      saving mode, <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nsp/\n      ipv6/54641>.\
    \  This disrupts network communications.\n   Compounding the problem, when dealing\
    \ with devices that drop Router\n   Advertisements when in power saving mode,\
    \ some network administrators\n   work around the problem by sending RAs even\
    \ more frequently.  This\n   causes devices to engage in even more aggressive\
    \ filtering.\n"
- title: 4.  Router Advertisement Frequency
  contents:
  - "4.  Router Advertisement Frequency\n   The appropriate frequency of periodic\
    \ RAs depends on how constrained\n   the network devices are.\n   o  Laptop-class\
    \ devices will likely experience no noticeable battery-\n      life impact, even\
    \ if RAs are sent every few seconds.\n   o  Tablets, phones, and watches experience\
    \ it more noticeably.  At\n      the time of writing, current-generation devices\
    \ might consume on\n      the order of 5 mA when the main processor is asleep.\
    \  Upon\n      receiving a packet, they might consume on the order of 200 mA for\n\
    \      250 ms, as the packet causes the main processor to wake up,\n      process\
    \ the RA, attend to other pending tasks, and then go back to\n      sleep.  Thus,\
    \ on such devices, the cost of receiving one RA will\n      be approximately 0.014\
    \ mAh.\n      In order to limit the amount of power used to receive Router\n \
    \     Advertisements to, say, 2% of idle power (i.e., to impact idle\n      battery\
    \ life by no more than 2%), the average power budget for\n      receiving RAs\
    \ must be no more than 0.1 mA, or approximately 7 RAs\n      per hour.  Due to\
    \ background multicast loss and the tendency of\n      current devices to rate-limit\
    \ multicast when asleep, many of these\n      RAs might not reach the device.\
    \  Thus, the minimum lifetimes for\n      RA configuration parameters such as\
    \ default router lifetime might\n      reasonably be 5-10 times the RA period,\
    \ or roughly 45-90 minutes.\n      An impact of 2% relative to measured idle current\
    \ is negligible,\n      since on this sort of device average power consumption\
    \ is\n      typically much higher than idle power consumption.\n   o  Specialized\
    \ devices in non-general-purpose networks such as sensor\n      networks might\
    \ have tighter requirements.  In these environments,\n      even longer RA intervals\
    \ might be appropriate.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Network-Side Recommendations
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Network-Side Recommendations\n   1.  Router manufacturers SHOULD allow\
    \ network administrators to\n       configure the routers to respond to Router\
    \ Solicitations with\n       unicast Router Advertisements if:\n       *  The\
    \ Router Solicitation's source address is not the\n          unspecified address,\
    \ and:\n       *  The solicitation contains a valid Source Link-Layer Address\n\
    \          option.\n   2.  Administrators of networks that serve large numbers\
    \ (tens or\n       hundreds) of battery-powered devices SHOULD enable this behavior.\n\
    \   3.  Networks that serve battery-powered devices SHOULD NOT send\n       multicast\
    \ RAs too frequently (see Section 4) unless the\n       information in the RA\
    \ packet has substantially changed.  If there\n       is a desire to ensure that\
    \ hosts pick up configuration changes\n       quickly, those networks MAY send\
    \ frequent Router Advertisements\n       for a limited period of time (e.g., not\
    \ more than one minute)\n       immediately after a configuration change.\n  \
    \ No protocol changes are required.  Responding to Router Solicitations\n   with\
    \ unicast Router Advertisements is already allowed by Section\n   6.2.6 of [RFC4861],\
    \ and Router Advertisement intervals are already\n   configurable by the administrator\
    \ to a wide range of values.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Device-Side Recommendations
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Device-Side Recommendations\n   1.  Maintaining IPv6 connectivity requires\
    \ that hosts be able to\n       receive periodic multicast RAs [RFC4861].  Therefore,\
    \ hosts that\n       process unicast packets sent while they are asleep MUST also\n\
    \       process multicast RAs sent while they are asleep.  Battery-\n       powered\
    \ hosts MAY rate-limit identical RAs if they are sent too\n       frequently.\n\
    \   2.  Battery-powered devices that do not intend to maintain IPv6\n       connectivity\
    \ while asleep SHOULD either disconnect from the\n       network, abandoning all\
    \ IPv6 configuration on that network, or\n       perform Detecting Network Attachment\
    \ in IPv6 (DNAv6) procedures\n       [RFC6059] when waking up.\n"
