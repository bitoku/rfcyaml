  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] specifies stateful autoconfiguration for\
    \ IPv6 hosts.\n   However, many hosts will use stateless autoconfiguration as\
    \ specified\n   in [RFC2462] for address assignment, and use DHCPv6 only for other\n\
    \   configuration data; see [RFC3736].  This other configuration data\n   will\
    \ typically have no associated lifetime, hence there may be no\n   information\
    \ telling a host when to refresh its DHCPv6 configuration\n   data.  Therefore,\
    \ an option that can be used from server to client to\n   inform the client when\
    \ it should refresh the other configuration data\n   is needed.\n   This option\
    \ is useful in many situations:\n      - Unstable environments where unexpected\
    \ changes are likely to\n        occur.\n      - For planned changes, including\
    \ renumbering.  An administrator\n        can gradually decrease the time as the\
    \ event nears.\n      - Limit the amount of time before new services or servers\
    \ are\n        available to the client, such as the addition of a new NTP\n  \
    \      server or a change of address of a DNS server.  See [RFC4076].\n"

- title: 3.  Information Refresh Time Option Definition
  contents:
  - "3.  Information Refresh Time Option Definition\n   The information refresh time\
    \ option specifies an upper bound for how\n   long a client should wait before\
    \ refreshing information retrieved\n   from DHCPv6.  It is only used in Reply\
    \ messages in response to\n   Information-Request messages.  In other messages\
    \ there will usually\n   be other options that indicate when the client should\
    \ contact the\n   server, e.g., addresses with lifetimes.\n   Note that it is\
    \ only an upper bound.  If the client has any reason to\n   make a DHCPv6 request\
    \ before the refresh time expires, it should\n   attempt to refresh all the data.\n\
    \   A client may contact the server before the refresh time expires.\n   Reasons\
    \ it may do this include the need for additional configuration\n   parameters\
    \ (such as by an application), a new IPv6 prefix announced\n   by a router, or\
    \ that it has an indication that it may have moved to a\n   new link.\n   The\
    \ refresh time option specifies a common refresh time for all the\n   data.  It\
    \ doesn't make sense to have different refresh time values\n   for different data,\
    \ since when the client has reason to refresh some\n   of its data, it should\
    \ also refresh the remaining data.  Because of\n   this, the option must only\
    \ appear in the options area of the Reply\n   message.\n   The expiry of the refresh\
    \ time in itself does not in any way mean\n   that the client should remove the\
    \ data.  The client should keep its\n   current data while attempting to refresh\
    \ it.  However, the client is\n   free to fall back to mechanisms other than DHCPv6\
    \ if it cannot\n   refresh the data within a reasonable amount of time.\n   When\
    \ a client receives a Reply to an Information-Request that\n   contains configuration\
    \ information, it should install that new\n   configuration information after\
    \ removing any previously received\n   configuration information.  It should also\
    \ remove information that is\n   missing from the new information set, e.g., an\
    \ option might be left\n   out or contain only a subset of what it did previously.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Constants
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Constants\n   We define two constants for use by the protocol.  How they\
    \ are used\n   is specified in the sections below.\n      IRT_DEFAULT 86400\n\
    \         In some cases the client uses a default refresh time\n         IRT_DEFAULT.\
    \  The recommended value for IRT_DEFAULT is 86400\n         (24 hours).  The client\
    \ implementation SHOULD allow for this\n         value to be configurable.\n \
    \     IRT_MINIMUM 600\n         This defines a minimum value for the refresh time.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Client Behaviour
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Client Behaviour\n   A client MUST request this option in the Option Request\
    \ Option (ORO)\n   when sending Information-Request messages to the DHCPv6 server.\
    \  A\n   client MUST NOT request this option in the ORO in any other messages.\n\
    \   If the Reply to an Information-Request message does not contain this\n   option,\
    \ the client MUST behave as if the option with value\n   IRT_DEFAULT was provided.\n\
    \   A client MUST use the refresh time IRT_MINIMUM if it receives the\n   option\
    \ with a value less than IRT_MINIMUM.\n   As per section 5.6 of [RFC3315], the\
    \ value 0xffffffff is taken to\n   mean \"infinity\" and implies that the client\
    \ should not refresh its\n   configuration data without some other trigger (such\
    \ as detecting\n   movement to a new link).\n   If a client contacts the server\
    \ to obtain new data or refresh some\n   existing data before the refresh time\
    \ expires, then it SHOULD also\n   refresh all data covered by this option.\n\
    \   When the client detects that the refresh time has expired, it SHOULD\n   try\
    \ to update its configuration data by sending an Information-\n   Request as specified\
    \ in section 18.1.5 of [RFC3315], except that the\n   client MUST delay sending\
    \ the first Information-Request by a random\n   amount of time between 0 and INF_MAX_DELAY.\n\
    \   A client MAY have a maximum value for the refresh time, where that\n   value\
    \ is used whenever the client receives this option with a value\n   higher than\
    \ the maximum.  This also means that the maximum value is\n   used when the received\
    \ value is \"infinity\".  A maximum value might\n   make the client less vulnerable\
    \ to attacks based on forged DHCP\n   messages.  Without a maximum value, a client\
    \ may be made to use wrong\n   information for a possibly infinite period of time.\
    \  There may\n   however be reasons for having a very long refresh time, so it\
    \ may be\n   useful for this maximum value to be configurable.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Server Behaviour
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Server Behaviour\n   A server sending a Reply to an Information-Request\
    \ message SHOULD\n   include this option if it is requested in the ORO of the\
    \ Information-\n   Request.\n   The option value MUST NOT be smaller than IRT_MINIMUM.\
    \  The server\n   SHOULD give a warning if it is configured with a smaller value.\n\
    \   The option MUST only appear in the options area of Reply messages.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Section 23 of [RFC3315] outlines the DHCPv6 security\
    \ considerations.\n   This option does not change these in any significant way.\
    \  An\n   attacker could send faked Reply messages with a low information\n  \
    \ refresh time value, which would trigger use of IRT_MINIMUM to\n   minimize this\
    \ threat.  Another attack might be to send a very large\n   value, to make the\
    \ client use forged information for a long period of\n   time.  A possible maximum\
    \ limit at the client is suggested, which\n   would reduce this problem.\n"
