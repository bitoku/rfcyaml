This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for monitoring and controlling network devices with HPR (High Performance Routing) capabilities.
This memo identifies managed objects for the HPR protocol.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
The SNMP Network Management Framework consists of several components.
For the purpose of this specification, the applicable components of the Framework are the SMI and related documents [1, 2, 3], which define the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
This document identifies objects for monitoring the configuration and active characteristics of devices with HPR capabilities.
HPR is an enhancement to the Advanced Peer to Peer Network (APPN) architecture that provides fast data routing and improved session reliability.
APPN is one of the protocols that can use the HPR transport mechanism.
See the SNANAU APPN MIB [4] for management of APPN and APPN use of the HPR transport.
The HPR terms and overall architecture [5] are available at http://www.networking.ibm.com/app/aiwdoc/aiwsrc.htm.
Automatic Network Routing (ANR) is a fast low level routing technique.
Each node assigns a unique (within that node)
ANR label for each out bound link as it is activated.
The label size is defined by the ANR node, and nodes only need to know how to interpret their own labels.
The ANR string is a group of ANR labels encoded in a header in front of the message being sent.
At each hop the node strips off its own ANR label and forwards the message onto the link with that label.
The last label in the string is the Network Connection Endpoint (NCE), which identifies the component within the destination node that is to receive the message.
Rapid Transport Protocol (RTP) is an end to end full duplex transport connection (pipe).
It provides for high speed transport of data using ANR.
RTP is connection oriented, and delivers data in correct order reliably.
Error recovery is done efficiently with selective retransmission of data.
An RTP path can be switched without disrupting the sessions using it.
An RTP path switch may be done automatically if a link in the path fails and another RTP path is available, or on demand to attempt to restore the optimal path.
RTP performs flow/congestion control with the Adaptive Rate Based (ARB) algorithm, described in [5].
ARB is done only at the endpoints of the RTP pipe, so intermediate hops are not involved.
ARB regulates the flow of data over an RTP connection by adaptively changing the sender's rate based on feedback on the receiver's rate.
It is designed to prevent congestion rather than react to it.
In this document, we describe HPR managed objects.
Identifying how incoming packets are routed based on ANR labels.
Monitoring the RTP connections between nodes.
Ability to trigger an RTP path switch.
The MIB only supports a path switch with no specified path.
Some implementations may have a product specific option to specify a new path.
The hprOperatorPathSwitchSupport object identifies this support.
Historical information about RTP path switch attempts.
Protocol specific uses of HPR (such as APPN).
The APPN MIB contains a trap for Alert conditions that may affect HPR resources.
The value for the affectedObject object contained in the alertTrap is determined by the implementation.
It may contain a VariablePointer from the HPR MIB.
The APPN/HPR Alerts are defined in [6].
Although HPR is an extension to APPN, the HPR MIB relies very little upon the APPN MIB.
The appnNodeCounterDisconTime object in the APPN MIB is used to detect discontinuities in HPR MIB counters.
The hprNodeCpName object in this MIB has the same value as the appnNodeCpName object in the APPN MIB.
hprAnrRouting objects related to the ANR routing table.
hprTransportUser objects related to users of the HPR transport.
hprRtp objects related to the HPR Transport Tower.
These are described below in more detail.
The hprGlobal group consists of general objects such as the APPN CP (control point) name of the HPR node and the level of support for operator requested path switches.
The hprAnrRouting group consists objects to monitor and control the counting of ANR packets received and the following table: The hprAnrRoutingTable correlates incoming ANR labels to the outbound transmission group (TG) or local NCE to which incoming packet will be forwarded.
An entry defines the label type as identifying a local NCE or a TG, identifies the NCE or TG, and counts the number of packets received with the entry's ANR label.
hprTransportUser group The hprTransportUser group consists of the following table: The hprNceTable identifies network connection endpoints and their function types.
The function type can be any combination of a CP, logical unit (LU), boundary function, and route setup.
The hprRtp group consists of the following objects and tables:
These objects contain information about the number of RTP connection setups, and control of RTP counters.
This table contains one entry for each RTP connection.
The information includes local and remote NCE IDs and TCIDs (transport connection identifiers), timers, send rates, and statistics.
A path switch can be triggered by the hprRptPathSwitchTrigger object if the agent node supports it; however, a new path cannot be specified.
This table contains statistics and historical information for RTP path switches attempts, including old and new ANR strings and Route Selection Control Vectors (RSCVs), why the path switch was initiated, and the result (successful or reason for failure).

"The value of the sysUpTime object when the counters for this RTP connection last experienced a discontinuity.

This table contains statistics and historical information related to    both successful and unsuccessful RTP path switches.
This    information can be important for both trend analysis and problem    determination.
Note the terminology here:  when RTP is triggered to find a new path    for a connection, this initiates a 'path switch,' which will end up    being either successful or unsuccessful.
This 'new' path may be the same path that the connection was    using before the path switch.

Security Considerations In most cases, MIBs are not themselves security risks; if SNMP security is operating as intended, the use of a MIB to view information about a system, or to change some parameter at the system, is a tool, not a threat.
None of the read only objects in the HPR MIB reports a password, user data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.
Some enterprises view their network configuration itself, as well as information about network usage and performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to restrict SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.
One read write object in the MIB can affect network operations:
Setting this object to 'switchPathNow' triggers an immediate path switch attempt.
An HPR path switch does not itself disrupt the SNA sessions using the RTP connection undergoing the path switch.
However, frequent path switches for many RTP connections can have an adverse impact on overall network performance.
It is recommended that SNMP access to this object be restricted.
Other read write objects control the gathering of network management data;
controlling access to these objects is less critical.
