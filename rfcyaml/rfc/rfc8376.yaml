  - "Abstract\n   Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are wireless technologies\
    \ with\n   characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly\n\
    \   very small packet and application-layer data sizes, and long battery\n   life\
    \ operation.  This memo is an informational overview of the set of\n   LPWAN technologies\
    \ being considered in the IETF and of the gaps that\n   exist between the needs\
    \ of those technologies and the goal of running\n   IP in LPWANs.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides background material and an overview\
    \ of the\n   technologies being considered in the IETF's IPv6 over Low Power Wide-\n\
    \   Area Networks (LPWAN) Working Group (WG).  It also provides a gap\n   analysis\
    \ between the needs of these technologies and currently\n   available IETF specifications.\n\
    \   Most technologies in this space aim for a similar goal of supporting\n   large\
    \ numbers of very low-cost, low-throughput devices with very low\n   power consumption,\
    \ so that even battery-powered devices can be\n   deployed for years.  LPWAN devices\
    \ also tend to be constrained in\n   their use of bandwidth, for example, with\
    \ limited frequencies being\n   allowed to be used within limited duty cycles\
    \ (usually expressed as a\n   percentage of time per hour that the device is allowed\
    \ to transmit).\n   As the name implies, coverage of large areas is also a common\
    \ goal.\n   So, by and large, the different technologies aim for deployment in\n\
    \   very similar circumstances.\n   While all constrained networks must balance\
    \ power consumption /\n   battery life, cost, and bandwidth, LPWANs prioritize\
    \ power and cost\n   benefits by accepting severe bandwidth and duty cycle constraints\n\
    \   when making the required trade-offs.  This prioritization is made in\n   order\
    \ to get the multiple-kilometer radio links implied by \"Wide\n   Area\" in LPWAN's\
    \ name.\n   Existing pilot deployments have shown huge potential and created much\n\
    \   industrial interest in these technologies.  At the time of writing,\n   essentially\
    \ no LPWAN end devices (other than for Wi-SUN) have IP\n   capabilities.  Connecting\
    \ LPWANs to the Internet would provide\n   significant benefits to these networks\
    \ in terms of interoperability,\n   application deployment, and management (among\
    \ others).  The goal of\n   the LPWAN WG is to, where necessary, adapt IETF-defined\
    \ protocols,\n   addressing schemes, and naming conventions to this particular\n\
    \   constrained environment.\n   This document is largely the work of the people\
    \ listed in the\n   Contributors section.\n"

  - "2.1.1.  Provenance and Documents\n   LoRaWAN is a wireless technology based on\
    \ Industrial, Scientific, and\n   Medical (ISM) that is used for long-range low-power\
    \ low-data-rate\n   applications developed by the LoRa Alliance, a membership\
    \ consortium\n   <https://www.lora-alliance.org/>.  This document is based on\
    \ Version\n   1.0.2 of the LoRa specification [LoRaSpec].  That specification\
    \ is\n   publicly available and has already seen several deployments across\n\
    \   the globe.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Characteristics\n   LoRaWAN aims to support end devices operating on\
    \ a single battery for\n   an extended period of time (e.g., 10 years or more),\
    \ extended\n   coverage through 155 dB maximum coupling loss, and reliable and\n\
    \   efficient file download (as needed for remote software/firmware\n   upgrade).\n\
    \   LoRaWAN networks are typically organized in a star-of-stars topology\n   in\
    \ which Gateways relay messages between end devices and a central\n   \"network\
    \ server\" in the backend.  Gateways are connected to the\n   network server via\
    \ IP links while end devices use single-hop LoRaWAN\n   communication that can\
    \ be received at one or more Gateways.\n   Communication is generally bidirectional;\
    \ uplink communication from\n   end devices to the network server is favored in\
    \ terms of overall\n   bandwidth availability.\n   Figure 1 shows the entities\
    \ involved in a LoRaWAN network.\n   +----------+\n   |End Device| * * *\n   +----------+\

    \                      Figure 1: LoRaWAN Architecture\n   o  End Device: a LoRa\
    \ client device, sometimes called a \"mote\".\n      Communicates with Gateways.\n\
    \   o  Gateway: a radio on the infrastructure side, sometimes called a\n     \
    \ \"concentrator\" or \"base station\".  Communicates with end devices\n     \
    \ and, via IP, with a network server.\n   o  Network Server: The Network Server\
    \ (NS) terminates the LoRaWAN\n      Medium Access Control (MAC) layer for the\
    \ end devices connected to\n      the network.  It is the center of the star topology.\n\
    \   o  Join Server: The Join Server (JS) is a server on the Internet side\n  \
    \    of an NS that processes join requests from an end devices.\n   o  Uplink\
    \ message: refers to communications from an end device to a\n      network server\
    \ or application via one or more Gateways.\n   o  Downlink message: refers to\
    \ communications from a network server\n      or application via one Gateway to\
    \ a single end device or a group\n      of end devices (considering multicasting).\n\
    \   o  Application: refers to application-layer code both on the end\n      device\
    \ and running \"behind\" the NS.  For LoRaWAN, there will\n      generally only\
    \ be one application running on most end devices.\n      Interfaces between the\
    \ NS and the application are not further\n      described here.\n   In LoRaWAN\
    \ networks, end device transmissions may be received at\n   multiple Gateways,\
    \ so, during nominal operation, a network server may\n   see multiple instances\
    \ of the same uplink message from an end device.\n   The LoRaWAN network infrastructure\
    \ manages the data rate and Radio\n   Frequency (RF) output power for each end\
    \ device individually by means\n   of an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme.  End\
    \ devices may transmit on\n   any channel allowed by local regulation at any time.\n\
    \   LoRaWAN radios make use of ISM bands, for example, 433 MHz and 868\n   MHz\
    \ within the European Union and 915 MHz in the Americas.\n   The end device changes\
    \ channels in a pseudorandom fashion for every\n   transmission to help make the\
    \ system more robust to interference and/\n   or to conform to local regulations.\n\
    \   Figure 2 shows that after a transmission slot, a Class A device turns\n  \
    \ on its receiver for two short receive windows that are offset from\n   the end\
    \ of the transmission window.  End devices can only transmit a\n   subsequent\
    \ uplink frame after the end of the associated receive\n   windows.  When a device\
    \ joins a LoRaWAN network, there are similar\n   timeouts on parts of that process.\n\

    \         Table 2: Minima and Maxima for Various LoRaWAN Parameters\n   Note that,\
    \ in the case of the smallest frame size (19 octets), 8\n   octets are required\
    \ for LoRa MAC layer headers, leaving only 11\n   octets for payload (including\
    \ MAC layer options).  However, those\n   settings do not apply for the join procedure\
    \ -- end devices are\n   required to use a channel and data rate that can send\
    \ the 23-byte\n   Join-Request message for the join procedure.\n   Uplink and\
    \ downlink higher-layer data is carried in a MACPayload.\n   There is a concept\
    \ of \"ports\" (an optional 8-bit value) to handle\n   different applications\
    \ on an end device.  Port zero is reserved for\n   LoRaWAN-specific messaging,\
    \ such as the configuration of the end\n   device's network parameters (available\
    \ channels, data rates, ADR\n   parameters, Rx Delay 1 and 2, etc.).\n   In addition\
    \ to carrying higher-layer PDUs, there are Join-Request and\n   Join-Response\
    \ (aka Join-Accept) messages for handling network access.\n   And so-called \"\
    MAC commands\" (see below) up to 15 bytes long can be\n   piggybacked in an options\
    \ field (\"FOpts\").\n   There are a number of MAC commands for link and device\
    \ status\n   checking, ADR and duty cycle negotiation, and managing the RX windows\n\
    \   and radio channel settings.  For example, the link check response\n   message\
    \ allows the NS (in response to a request from an end device)\n   to inform an\
    \ end device about the signal attenuation seen most\n   recently at a Gateway\
    \ and to tell the end device how many Gateways\n   received the corresponding\
    \ link request MAC command.\n   Some MAC commands are initiated by the network\
    \ server.  For example,\n   one command allows the network server to ask an end\
    \ device to reduce\n   its duty cycle to only use a proportion of the maximum\
    \ allowed in a\n   region.  Another allows the network server to query the end\
    \ device's\n   power status with the response from the end device specifying whether\n\
    \   it has an external power source or is battery powered (in which case,\n  \
    \ a relative battery level is also sent to the network server).\n   In order to\
    \ operate nominally on a LoRaWAN network, a device needs a\n   32-bit device address,\
    \ which is assigned when the device \"joins\" the\n   network (see below for the\
    \ join procedure) or that is pre-provisioned\n   into the device.  In case of\
    \ roaming devices, the device address is\n   assigned based on the 24-bit network\
    \ identifier (NetID) that is\n   allocated to the network by the LoRa Alliance.\
    \  Non-roaming devices\n   can be assigned device addresses by the network without\
    \ relying on a\n   NetID assigned by the LoRa Alliance.\n   End devices are assumed\
    \ to work with one or quite a limited number of\n   applications, identified by\
    \ a 64-bit AppEUI, which is assumed to be a\n   registered IEEE EUI64 value [EUI64].\
    \  In addition, a device needs to\n   have two symmetric session keys, one for\
    \ protecting network artifacts\n   (port=0), the NwkSKey, and another for protecting\
    \ application-layer\n   traffic, the AppSKey.  Both keys are used for 128-bit\
    \ AES\n   cryptographic operations.  So, one option is for an end device to\n\
    \   have all of the above plus channel information, somehow\n   (pre-)provisioned;\
    \ in that case, the end device can simply start\n   transmitting.  This is achievable\
    \ in many cases via out-of-band means\n   given the nature of LoRaWAN networks.\

    \                Table 4: Values Required for Join Procedure\n   The join procedure\
    \ involves a special exchange where the end device\n   asserts the AppEUI and\
    \ DevEUI (integrity protected with the long-term\n   AppKey, but not encrypted)\
    \ in a Join-Request uplink message.  This is\n   then routed to the network server,\
    \ which interacts with an entity\n   that knows that AppKey to verify the Join-Request.\
    \  If all is going\n   well, a Join-Accept downlink message is returned from the\
    \ network\n   server to the end device.  That message specifies the 24-bit NetID,\n\
    \   32-bit DevAddr, and channel information and from which the AppSKey\n   and\
    \ NwkSKey can be derived based on knowledge of the AppKey.  This\n   provides\
    \ the end device with all the values listed in Table 3.\n   All payloads are encrypted\
    \ and have data integrity.  MAC commands,\n   when sent as a payload (port zero),\
    \ are therefore protected.\n   However, MAC commands piggybacked as frame options\
    \ (\"FOpts\") are sent\n   in clear.  Any MAC commands sent as frame options and\
    \ not only as\n   payload, are visible to a passive attacker, but they are not\n\
    \   malleable for an active attacker due to the use of the Message\n   Integrity\
    \ Check (MIC) described below.\n   For LoRaWAN version 1.0.x, the NwkSKey session\
    \ key is used to provide\n   data integrity between the end device and the network\
    \ server.  The\n   AppSKey is used to provide data confidentiality between the\
    \ end\n   device and network server, or to the application \"behind\" the network\n\
    \   server, depending on the implementation of the network.\n   All MAC-layer\
    \ messages have an outer 32-bit MIC calculated using AES-\n   CMAC with the input\
    \ being the ciphertext payload and other headers\n   and using the NwkSkey.  Payloads\
    \ are encrypted using AES-128, with a\n   counter-mode derived from [IEEE.802.15.4]\
    \ using the AppSKey.\n   Gateways are not expected to be provided with the AppSKey\
    \ or NwkSKey,\n   all of the infrastructure-side cryptography happens in (or \"\
    behind\")\n   the network server.  When session keys are derived from the AppKey\
    \ as\n   a result of the join procedure, the Join-Accept message payload is\n\
    \   specially handled.\n   The long-term AppKey is directly used to protect the\
    \ Join-Accept\n   message content, but the function used is not an AES-encrypt\n\
    \   operation, but rather an AES-decrypt operation.  The justification is\n  \
    \ that this means that the end device only needs to implement the AES-\n   encrypt\
    \ operation.  (The counter-mode variant used for payload\n   decryption means\
    \ the end device doesn't need an AES-decrypt\n   primitive.)\n   The Join-Accept\
    \ plaintext is always less than 16 bytes long, so\n   Electronic Code Book (ECB)\
    \ mode is used for protecting Join-Accept\n   messages.  The Join-Accept message\
    \ contains an AppNonce (a 24-bit\n   value) that is recovered on the end device\
    \ along with the other Join-\n   Accept content (e.g., DevAddr) using the AES-encrypt\
    \ operation.  Once\n   the Join-Accept payload is available to the end device,\
    \ the session\n   keys are derived from the AppKey, AppNonce, and other values,\
    \ again\n   using an ECB mode AES-encrypt operation, with the plaintext input\n\
    \   being a maximum of 16 octets.\n"

- title: 2.2.2.  Characteristics
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Characteristics\n   Specific targets for NB-IoT include: module cost\
    \ that is Less than US\n   $5, extended coverage of 164 dB maximum coupling loss,\
    \ battery life\n   of over 10 years, ~55000 devices per cell, and uplink reporting\n\
    \   latency of less than 10 seconds.\n   NB-IoT supports Half Duplex Frequency\
    \ Division Duplex (FDD) operation\n   mode with 60 kbit/s peak rate in uplink\
    \ and 30 kbit/s peak rate in\n   downlink, and a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)\
    \ size of 1600 bytes,\n   limited by PDCP layer (see Figure 4 for the protocol\
    \ structure),\n   which is the highest layer in the user plane, as explained later.\n\
    \   Any packet size up to the said MTU size can be passed to the NB-IoT\n   stack\
    \ from higher layers, segmentation of the packet is performed in\n   the RLC layer,\
    \ which can segment the data to transmission blocks with\n   a size as small as\
    \ 16 bits.  As the name suggests, NB-IoT uses\n   narrowbands with bandwidth of\
    \ 180 kHz in both downlink and uplink.\n   The multiple access scheme used in\
    \ the downlink is Orthogonal\n   Frequency-Division Multiplex (OFDMA) with 15\
    \ kHz sub-carrier spacing.\n   In uplink, Sub-Carrier Frequency-Division Multiplex\
    \ (SC-FDMA) single\n   tone with either 15kHz or 3.75 kHz tone spacing is used,\
    \ or\n   optionally multi-tone SC-FDMA can be used with 15 kHz tone spacing.\n\
    \   NB-IoT can be deployed in three ways.  In-band deployment means that\n   the\
    \ narrowband is deployed inside the LTE band and radio resources\n   are flexibly\
    \ shared between NB-IoT and normal LTE carrier.  In Guard-\n   band deployment,\
    \ the narrowband uses the unused resource blocks\n   between two adjacent LTE\
    \ carriers.  Standalone deployment is also\n   supported, where the narrowband\
    \ can be located alone in dedicated\n   spectrum, which makes it possible, for\
    \ example, to reframe a GSM\n   carrier at 850/900 MHz for NB-IoT.  All three\
    \ deployment modes are\n   used in licensed frequency bands.  The maximum transmission\
    \ power is\n   either 20 or 23 dBm for uplink transmissions, while for downlink\n\
    \   transmission the eNodeB may use higher transmission power, up to 46\n   dBm\
    \ depending on the deployment.\n   A Maximum Coupling Loss (MCL) target for NB-IoT\
    \ coverage enhancements\n   defined by 3GPP is 164 dB.  With this MCL, the performance\
    \ of NB-IoT\n   in downlink varies between 200 bps and 2-3 kbit/s, depending on\
    \ the\n   deployment mode.  Stand-alone operation may achieve the highest data\n\
    \   rates, up to a few kbit/s, while in-band and guard-band operations\n   may\
    \ reach several hundreds of bps.  NB-IoT may even operate with an\n   MCL higher\
    \ than 170 dB with very low bit rates.\n   For signaling optimization, two options\
    \ are introduced in addition to\n   the legacy LTE RRC connection setup; mandatory\
    \ Data-over-NAS (Control\n   Plane optimization, solution 2 in [TGPP23720]) and\
    \ optional RRC\n   Suspend/Resume (User Plane optimization, solution 18 in [TGPP23720]).\n\
    \   In the control-plane optimization, the data is sent over Non-Access\n   Stratum\
    \ (NAS), directly to/from the Mobile Management Entity (MME)\n   (see Figure 3\
    \ for the network architecture) in the core network to\n   the User Equipment\
    \ (UE) without interaction from the base station.\n   This means there is no Access\
    \ Stratum security or header compression\n   provided by the PDCP layer in the\
    \ eNodeB, as the Access Stratum is\n   bypassed, and only limited RRC procedures.\
    \  Header compression based\n   on Robust Header Compression (RoHC) may still\
    \ optionally be provided\n   and terminated in the MME.\n   The RRC Suspend/Resume\
    \ procedures reduce the signaling overhead\n   required for UE state transition\
    \ from RRC Idle to RRC Connected mode\n   compared to a legacy LTE operation in\
    \ order to have quicker user-\n   plane transaction with the network and return\
    \ to RRC Idle mode\n   faster.\n   In order to prolong device battery life, both\
    \ Power-Saving Mode (PSM)\n   and extended DRX (eDRX) are available to NB-IoT.\
    \  With eDRX, the RRC\n   Connected mode DRX cycle is up to 10.24 seconds; in\
    \ RRC Idle, the\n   eDRX cycle can be up to 3 hours.  In PSM, the device is in\
    \ a deep\n   sleep state and only wakes up for uplink reporting.  After the\n\
    \   reporting, there is a window (configured by the network) during which\n  \
    \ the device receiver is open for downlink connectivity or for\n   periodical\
    \ \"keep-alive\" signaling (PSM uses periodic TAU signaling\n   with additional\
    \ reception windows for downlink reachability).\n   Since NB-IoT operates in a\
    \ licensed spectrum, it has no channel\n   access restrictions allowing up to\
    \ a 100% duty cycle.\n   3GPP access security is specified in [TGPP33203].\n \

    \ 3GPP Radio Protocol Architecture for the Control Plane\n   The radio protocol\
    \ architecture of NB-IoT (and LTE) is separated into\n   the control plane and\
    \ the user plane.  The control plane consists of\n   protocols that control the\
    \ radio-access bearers and the connection\n   between the UE and the network.\
    \  The highest layer of control plane\n   is called the Non-Access Stratum (NAS),\
    \ which conveys the radio\n   signaling between the UE and the Evolved Packet\
    \ Core (EPC), passing\n   transparently through the radio network.  The NAS is\
    \ responsible for\n   authentication, security control, mobility management, and\
    \ bearer\n   management.\n   The Access Stratum (AS) is the functional layer below\
    \ the NAS; in the\n   control plane, it consists of the Radio Resource Control\
    \ (RRC)\n   protocol [TGPP36331], which handles connection establishment and\n\
    \   release functions, broadcast of system information, radio-bearer\n   establishment,\
    \ reconfiguration, and release.  The RRC configures the\n   user and control planes\
    \ according to the network status.  There exist\n   two RRC states, RRC_Idle or\
    \ RRC_Connected, and the RRC entity\n   controls the switching between these states.\
    \  In RRC_Idle, the\n   network knows that the UE is present in the network, and\
    \ the UE can\n   be reached in case of an incoming call/downlink data.  In this\
    \ state,\n   the UE monitors paging, performs cell measurements and cell\n   selection,\
    \ and acquires system information.  Also, the UE can receive\n   broadcast and\
    \ multicast data, but it is not expected to transmit or\n   receive unicast data.\
    \  In RRC_Connected state, the UE has a\n   connection to the eNodeB, the network\
    \ knows the UE location on the\n   cell level, and the UE may receive and transmit\
    \ unicast data.  An RRC\n   connection is established when the UE is expected\
    \ to be active in the\n   network, to transmit or receive data.  The RRC connection\
    \ is\n   released, switching back to RRC_Idle, when there is no more traffic;\n\
    \   this is in order to preserve UE battery life and radio resources.\n   However,\
    \ as mentioned earlier, a new feature was introduced for\n   NB-IoT that allows\
    \ data to be transmitted from the MME directly to\n   the UE and then transparently\
    \ to the eNodeB, thus bypassing AS\n   functions.\n   The PDCP's [TGPP36323] main\
    \ services in the control plane are\n   transfer of control-plane data, ciphering,\
    \ and integrity protection.\n   The RLC protocol [TGPP36322] performs transfer\
    \ of upper-layer PDUs\n   and, optionally, error correction with Automatic Repeat\
    \ reQuest\n   (ARQ), concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of RLC Service\n\
    \   Data Units (SDUs), in-sequence delivery of upper-layer PDUs,\n   duplicate\
    \ detection, RLC SDU discarding, RLC-re-establishment, and\n   protocol error\
    \ detection and recovery.\n   The MAC protocol [TGPP36321] provides mapping between\
    \ logical\n   channels and transport channels, multiplexing of MAC SDUs, scheduling\n\
    \   information reporting, error correction with Hybrid ARQ (HARQ),\n   priority\
    \ handling, and transport format selection.\n   The PHY [TGPP36201] provides data-transport\
    \ services to higher\n   layers.  These include error detection and indication\
    \ to higher\n   layers, Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoding, HARQ soft-combining,\n\
    \   rate-matching, mapping of the transport channels onto physical\n   channels,\
    \ power-weighting and modulation of physical channels,\n   frequency and time\
    \ synchronization, and radio characteristics\n   measurements.\n   The user plane\
    \ is responsible for transferring the user data through\n   the Access Stratum.\
    \  It interfaces with IP and the highest layer of\n   the user plane is the PDCP,\
    \ which, in the user plane, performs header\n   compression using RoHC, transfer\
    \ of user-plane data between eNodeB\n   and the UE, ciphering, and integrity protection.\
    \  Similar to the\n   control plane, lower layers in the user plane include RLC,\
    \ MAC, and\n   the PHY performing the same tasks as they do in the control plane.\n"

  - "2.3.2.  Characteristics\n   Sigfox LPWAN autonomous battery-operated devices\
    \ send only a few\n   bytes per day, week, or month, in principle, allowing them\
    \ to remain\n   on a single battery for up to 10-15 years.  Hence, the system\
    \ is\n   designed as to allow devices to last several years, sometimes even\n\
    \   buried underground.\n   Since the radio protocol is connectionless and optimized\
    \ for uplink\n   communications, the capacity of a Sigfox base station depends\
    \ on the\n   number of messages generated by devices, and not on the actual number\n\
    \   of devices.  Likewise, the battery life of devices depends on the\n   number\
    \ of messages generated by the device.  Depending on the use\n   case, devices\
    \ can vary from sending less than one message per device\n   per day to dozens\
    \ of messages per device per day.\n   The coverage of the cell depends on the\
    \ link budget and on the type\n   of deployment (urban, rural, etc.).  The radio\
    \ interface is compliant\n   with the following regulations:\n      Spectrum allocation\
    \ in the USA [fcc_ref]\n      Spectrum allocation in Europe [etsi_ref1] [etsi_ref2]\n\
    \      Spectrum allocation in Japan [arib_ref]\n   The Sigfox radio interface\
    \ is also compliant with the local\n   regulations of the following countries:\
    \ Australia, Brazil, Canada,\n   Kenya, Lebanon, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand,\
    \ Oman, Peru,\n   Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Thailand.\n   The\
    \ radio interface is based on Ultra Narrow Band (UNB)\n   communications, which\
    \ allow an increased transmission range by\n   spending a limited amount of energy\
    \ at the device.  Moreover, UNB\n   allows a large number of devices to coexist\
    \ in a given cell without\n   significantly increasing the spectrum interference.\n\
    \   Both uplink and downlink are supported, although the system is\n   optimized\
    \ for uplink communications.  Due to spectrum optimizations,\n   different uplink\
    \ and downlink frames and time synchronization methods\n   are needed.\n   The\
    \ main radio characteristics of the UNB uplink transmission are:\n   o  Channelization\
    \ mask: 100 Hz / 600 Hz (depending on the region)\n   o  Uplink baud rate: 100\
    \ baud / 600 baud (depending on the region)\n   o  Modulation scheme: DBPSK\n\
    \   o  Uplink transmission power: compliant with local regulation\n   o  Link\
    \ budget: 155 dB (or better)\n   o  Central frequency accuracy: not relevant,\
    \ provided there is no\n      significant frequency drift within an uplink packet\
    \ transmission\n   For example, in Europe, the UNB uplink frequency band is limited\
    \ to\n   868.00 to 868.60 MHz, with a maximum output power of 25 mW and a duty\n\
    \   cycle of 1%.\n   The format of the uplink frame is the following:\n   +--------+--------+--------+------------------+-------------+-----+\n\
    \   |Preamble|  Frame | Dev ID |     Payload      |Msg Auth Code| FCS |\n   |\

    \                       Figure 5: Uplink Frame Format\n   The uplink frame is\
    \ composed of the following fields:\n   o  Preamble: 19 bits\n   o  Frame sync\
    \ and header: 29 bits\n   o  Device ID: 32 bits\n   o  Payload: 0-96 bits\n  \
    \ o  Authentication: 16-40 bits\n   o  Frame check sequence: 16 bits (Cyclic Redundancy\
    \ Check (CRC))\n   The main radio characteristics of the UNB downlink transmission\
    \ are:\n   o  Channelization mask: 1.5 kHz\n   o  Downlink baud rate: 600 baud\n\
    \   o  Modulation scheme: GFSK\n   o  Downlink transmission power: 500 mW / 4W\
    \ (depending on the region)\n   o  Link budget: 153 dB (or better)\n   o  Central\
    \ frequency accuracy: the center frequency of downlink\n      transmission is\
    \ set by the network according to the corresponding\n      uplink transmission.\n\
    \   For example, in Europe, the UNB downlink frequency band is limited to\n  \
    \ 869.40 to 869.65 MHz, with a maximum output power of 500 mW with 10%\n   duty\
    \ cycle.\n   The format of the downlink frame is the following:\n   +------------+-----+---------+------------------+-------------+-----+\n\

    \                      Figure 6: Downlink Frame Format\n   The downlink frame\
    \ is composed of the following fields:\n   o  Preamble: 91 bits\n   o  Frame sync\
    \ and header: 13 bits\n   o  Error Correcting Code (ECC): 32 bits\n   o  Payload:\
    \ 0-64 bits\n   o  Authentication: 16 bits\n   o  Frame check sequence: 8 bits\
    \ (CRC)\n   The radio interface is optimized for uplink transmissions, which are\n\
    \   asynchronous.  Downlink communications are achieved by devices\n   querying\
    \ the network for available data.\n   A device willing to receive downlink messages\
    \ opens a fixed window\n   for reception after sending an uplink transmission.\
    \  The delay and\n   duration of this window have fixed values.  The network transmits\
    \ the\n   downlink message for a given device during the reception window, and\n\
    \   the network also selects the BS for transmitting the corresponding\n   downlink\
    \ message.\n   Uplink and downlink transmissions are unbalanced due to the\n \
    \  regulatory constraints on ISM bands.  Under the strictest\n   regulations,\
    \ the system can allow a maximum of 140 uplink messages\n   and 4 downlink messages\
    \ per device per day.  These restrictions can\n   be slightly relaxed depending\
    \ on system conditions and the specific\n   regulatory domain of operation.\n\

    \          Figure 7: Sigfox Network Architecture\n   Figure 7 depicts the different\
    \ elements of the Sigfox network\n   architecture.\n   Sigfox has a \"one-contract\
    \ one-network\" model allowing devices to\n   connect in any country, without\
    \ any need or notion of either roaming\n   or handover.\n   The architecture consists\
    \ of a single cloud-based core network, which\n   allows global connectivity with\
    \ minimal impact on the end device and\n   radio access network.  The core network\
    \ elements are the Service\n   Center (SC) and the Registration Authority (RA).\
    \  The SC is in charge\n   of the data connectivity between the BS and the Internet,\
    \ as well as\n   the control and management of the BSs and End Points (EPs). \
    \ The RA\n   is in charge of the EP network access authorization.\n   The radio\
    \ access network is comprised of several BSs connected\n   directly to the SC.\
    \  Each BS performs complex L1/L2 functions,\n   leaving some L2 and L3 functionalities\
    \ to the SC.\n   The Devices (DEVs) or EPs are the objects that communicate\n\
    \   application data between local Device Applications (DAs) and Network\n   Applications\
    \ (NAs).\n   Devices (or EPs) can be static or nomadic, as they associate with\
    \ the\n   SC and they do not attach to any specific BS.  Hence, they can\n   communicate\
    \ with the SC through one or multiple BSs.\n   Due to constraints in the complexity\
    \ of the Device, it is assumed\n   that Devices host only one or very few device\
    \ applications, which\n   most of the time communicate each to a single network\
    \ application at\n   a time.\n   The radio protocol authenticates and ensures\
    \ the integrity of each\n   message.  This is achieved by using a unique device\
    \ ID and an\n   AES-128-based message authentication code, ensuring that the message\n\
    \   has been generated and sent by the device with the ID claimed in the\n   message.\
    \  Application data can be encrypted at the application level\n   or not, depending\
    \ on the criticality of the use case, to provide a\n   balance between cost and\
    \ effort versus risk.  AES-128 in counter mode\n   is used for encryption.  Cryptographic\
    \ keys are independent for each\n   device.  These keys are associated with the\
    \ device ID and separate\n   integrity and confidentiality keys are pre-provisioned.\
    \  A\n   confidentiality key is only provisioned if confidentiality is to be\n\
    \   used.  At the time of writing, the algorithms and keying details for\n   this\
    \ are not published.\n"

- title: 2.4.2.  Characteristics
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  Characteristics\n   The FAN profile is an IPv6 wireless mesh network\
    \ with support for\n   enterprise-level security.  The frequency-hopping wireless\
    \ mesh\n   topology aims to offer superior network robustness, reliability due\n\
    \   to high redundancy, good scalability due to the flexible mesh\n   configuration,\
    \ and good resilience to interference.  Very low power\n   modes are in development\
    \ permitting long-term battery operation of\n   network nodes.\n   The following\
    \ list contains some overall characteristics of Wi-SUN\n   that are relevant to\
    \ LPWAN applications.\n   o  Coverage: The range of Wi-SUN FAN is typically 2\
    \ - 3 km in line of\n      sight, matching the needs of neighborhood area networks,\
    \ campus\n      area networks, or corporate area networks.  The range can also\
    \ be\n      extended via multi-hop networking.\n   o  High-bandwidth, low-link\
    \ latency: Wi-SUN supports relatively high\n      bandwidth, i.e., up to 300 kbit/s\
    \ [FANOV], enables remote update\n      and upgrade of devices so that they can\
    \ handle new applications,\n      extending their working life.  Wi-SUN supports\
    \ LPWAN IoT\n      applications that require on-demand control by providing low\
    \ link\n      latency (0.02 s) and bidirectional communication.\n   o  Low-power\
    \ consumption: FAN devices draw less than 2 uA when\n      resting and only 8\
    \ mA when listening.  Such devices can maintain a\n      long lifetime, even if\
    \ they are frequently listening.  For\n      instance, suppose the device transmits\
    \ data for 10 ms once every\n      10 s; theoretically, a battery of 1000 mAh\
    \ can last more than 10\n      years.\n   o  Scalability: Tens of millions of\
    \ Wi-SUN FAN devices have been\n      deployed in urban, suburban, and rural environments,\
    \ including\n      deployments with more than 1 million devices.\n   A FAN contains\
    \ one or more networks.  Within a network, nodes assume\n   one of three operational\
    \ roles.  First, each network contains a\n   Border Router providing WAN connectivity\
    \ to the network.  The Border\n   Router maintains source-routing tables for all\
    \ nodes within its\n   network, provides node authentication and key management\
    \ services,\n   and disseminates network-wide information such as broadcast\n\
    \   schedules.  Second, Router nodes, which provide upward and downward\n   packet\
    \ forwarding (within a network).  A Router also provides\n   services for relaying\
    \ security and address management protocols.\n   Finally, Leaf nodes provide minimum\
    \ capabilities: discovering and\n   joining a network, sending/receiving IPv6\
    \ packets, etc.  A low-power\n   network may contain a mesh topology with Routers\
    \ at the edges that\n   construct a star topology with Leaf nodes.\n   The FAN\
    \ profile is based on various open standards developed by the\n   IETF (including\
    \ [RFC768], [RFC2460], [RFC4443], and [RFC6282]).\n   Related IEEE 802 standards\
    \ include [IEEE.802.15.4] and\n   [IEEE.802.15.9].  For Low-Power and Lossy Networks\
    \ (LLNs), see ANSI/\n   TIA [ANSI-4957-210].\n   The FAN profile specification\
    \ provides an application-independent\n   IPv6-based transport service.  There\
    \ are two possible methods for\n   establishing IPv6 packet routing: the Routing\
    \ Protocol for Low-Power\n   and Lossy Networks (RPL) at the Network layer is\
    \ mandatory, and\n   Multi-Hop Delivery Service (MHDS) is optional at the Data\
    \ Link layer.\n   Figure 8 provides an overview of the FAN network stack.\n  \
    \ The Transport service is based on UDP (defined in [RFC768]) or TCP\n   (defined\
    \ in [RFC793].\n   The Network service is provided by IPv6 as defined in [RFC2460]\
    \ with\n   an IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN)\n\
    \   adaptation as defined in [RFC4944] and [RFC6282].  ICMPv6, as defined\n  \
    \ in [RFC4443], is used for the control plane during information\n   exchange.\n\
    \   The Data Link service provides both control/management of the PHY and\n  \
    \ data transfer/management services to the Network layer.  These\n   services\
    \ are divided into MAC and Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-\n   layers.  The LLC\
    \ sub-layer provides a protocol dispatch service that\n   supports 6LoWPAN and\
    \ an optional MAC sub-layer mesh service.  The MAC\n   sub-layer is constructed\
    \ using data structures defined in\n   [IEEE.802.15.4].  Multiple modes of frequency\
    \ hopping are defined.\n   The entire MAC payload is encapsulated in an [IEEE.802.15.9]\n\
    \   Information Element to enable LLC protocol dispatch between upper-\n   layer\
    \ 6LoWPAN processing and MAC sub-layer mesh processing, etc.\n   These areas will\
    \ be expanded once [IEEE.802.15.12] is completed.\n   The PHY service is derived\
    \ from a subset of the SUN FSK specification\n   in [IEEE.802.15.4].  The 2-FSK\
    \ modulation schemes, with a channel-\n   spacing range from 200 to 600 kHz, are\
    \ defined to provide data rates\n   from 50 to 300 kbit/s, with FEC as an optional\
    \ feature.  Towards\n   enabling ultra-low-power applications, the PHY layer design\
    \ is also\n   extendable to low-energy and critical infrastructure-monitoring\n\
    \   networks.\n   +----------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n\

- title: 4.1.  Naive Application of IPv6
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Naive Application of IPv6\n   IPv6 [RFC8200] has been designed to allocate\
    \ addresses to all the\n   nodes connected to the Internet.  Nevertheless, the\
    \ header overhead\n   of at least 40 bytes introduced by the protocol is incompatible\
    \ with\n   LPWAN constraints.  If IPv6 with no further optimization were used,\n\
    \   several LPWAN frames could be needed just to carry the IP header.\n   Another\
    \ problem arises from IPv6 MTU requirements, which require the\n   layer below\
    \ to support at least 1280 byte packets [RFC2460].\n   IPv6 has a configuration\
    \ protocol: Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)\n   [RFC4861]).  For a node to learn\
    \ network parameters, NDP generates\n   regular traffic with a relatively large\
    \ message size that does not\n   fit LPWAN constraints.\n   In some LPWAN technologies,\
    \ L2 multicast is not supported.  In that\n   case, if the network topology is\
    \ a star, the solution and\n   considerations from Section 3.2.5 of [RFC7668]\
    \ may be applied.\n   Other key protocols (such as DHCPv6 [RFC3315], IPsec [RFC4301]\
    \ and\n   TLS [RFC5246]) have similarly problematic properties in this context.\n\
    \   Each protocol requires relatively frequent round-trips between the\n   host\
    \ and some other host on the network.  In the case of\n   cryptographic protocols\
    \ (such as IPsec and TLS), in addition to the\n   round-trips required for secure\
    \ session establishment, cryptographic\n   operations can require padding and\
    \ addition of authenticators that\n   are problematic when considering LPWAN lower\
    \ layers.  Note that mains\n   powered Wi-SUN mesh router nodes will typically\
    \ be more resource\n   capable than the other LPWAN technologies discussed.  This\
    \ can enable\n   use of more \"chatty\" protocols for some aspects of Wi-SUN.\n"
- title: 4.2.  6LoWPAN
  contents:
  - "4.2.  6LoWPAN\n   Several technologies that exhibit significant constraints in\
    \ various\n   dimensions have exploited the 6LoWPAN suite of specifications\n\
    \   ([RFC4944], [RFC6282], and [RFC6775]) to support IPv6 [USES-6LO].\n   However,\
    \ the constraints of LPWANs, often more extreme than those\n   typical of technologies\
    \ that have (re-)used 6LoWPAN, constitute a\n   challenge for the 6LoWPAN suite\
    \ in order to enable IPv6 over LPWAN.\n   LPWANs are characterized by device constraints\
    \ (in terms of\n   processing capacity, memory, and energy availability), and\n\
    \   especially, link constraints, such as:\n   o  tiny L2 payload size (from ~10\
    \ to ~100 bytes),\n   o  very low bit rate (from ~10 bit/s to ~100 kbit/s), and\n\
    \   o  in some specific technologies, further message rate constraints\n     \
    \ (e.g., between ~0.1 message/minute and ~1 message/minute) due to\n      regional\
    \ regulations that limit the duty cycle.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Header Compression
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Header Compression\n   6LoWPAN header compression reduces IPv6 (and UDP)\
    \ header overhead by\n   eliding header fields when they can be derived from the\
    \ link layer\n   and by assuming that some of the header fields will frequently\
    \ carry\n   expected values. 6LoWPAN provides both stateless and stateful header\n\
    \   compression.  In the latter, all nodes of a 6LoWPAN are assumed to\n   share\
    \ compression context.  In the best case, the IPv6 header for\n   link-local communication\
    \ can be reduced to only 2 bytes.  For global\n   communication, the IPv6 header\
    \ may be compressed down to 3 bytes in\n   the most extreme case.  However, in\
    \ more practical situations, the\n   smallest IPv6 header size may be 11 bytes\
    \ (one address prefix\n   compressed) or 19 bytes (both source and destination\
    \ prefixes\n   compressed).  These headers are large considering the link-layer\n\
    \   payload size of LPWAN technologies, and in some cases, are even\n   bigger\
    \ than the LPWAN PDUs. 6LoWPAN was initially designed for\n   [IEEE.802.15.4]\
    \ networks with a frame size up to 127 bytes and a\n   throughput of up to 250\
    \ kbit/s, which may or may not be duty cycled.\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  Address Autoconfiguration
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Address Autoconfiguration\n   Traditionally, Interface Identifiers (IIDs)\
    \ have been derived from\n   link-layer identifiers [RFC4944].  This allows optimizations\
    \ such as\n   header compression.  Nevertheless, recent guidance has given advice\n\
    \   on the fact that, due to privacy concerns, 6LoWPAN devices should not\n  \
    \ be configured to embed their link-layer addresses in the IID by\n   default.\
    \  [RFC8065] provides guidance on better methods for\n   generating IIDs.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  Fragmentation
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Fragmentation\n   As stated above, IPv6 requires the layer below to support\
    \ an MTU of\n   1280 bytes [RFC8200].  Therefore, given the low maximum payload\
    \ size\n   of LPWAN technologies, fragmentation is needed.\n   If a layer of an\
    \ LPWAN technology supports fragmentation, proper\n   analysis has to be carried\
    \ out to decide whether the fragmentation\n   functionality provided by the lower\
    \ layer or fragmentation at the\n   adaptation layer should be used.  Otherwise,\
    \ fragmentation\n   functionality shall be used at the adaptation layer.\n   6LoWPAN\
    \ defined a fragmentation mechanism and a fragmentation header\n   to support\
    \ the transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE.802.15.4\n   networks [RFC4944].\
    \  While the 6LoWPAN fragmentation header is\n   appropriate for the 2003 version\
    \ of [IEEE.802.15.4] (which has a\n   frame payload size of 81-102 bytes), it\
    \ is not suitable for several\n   LPWAN technologies, many of which have a maximum\
    \ payload size that is\n   one order of magnitude below that of the 2003 version\
    \ of\n   [IEEE.802.15.4].  The overhead of the 6LoWPAN fragmentation header is\n\
    \   high, considering the reduced payload size of LPWAN technologies, and\n  \
    \ the limited energy availability of the devices using such\n   technologies.\
    \  Furthermore, its datagram offset field is expressed in\n   increments of eight\
    \ octets.  In some LPWAN technologies, the 6LoWPAN\n   fragmentation header plus\
    \ eight octets from the original datagram\n   exceeds the available space in the\
    \ layer two payload.  In addition,\n   the MTU in the LPWAN networks could be\
    \ variable, which implies a\n   variable fragmentation solution.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.4.  Neighbor Discovery\n   6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery [RFC6775] defines optimizations\

    \ ND may be used in not so severely constrained LPWAN networks.\n   The relative\

    \ if appropriate).  In certain LPWAN\n   setups (with a maximum payload size above\
    \ ~60 bytes and duty-cycle-\n   free or equivalent operation), an RS/RA/NS/NA\

  contents:

    \   multimedia flows in a point-to-point channel.  RoHC uses three levels\n  \
    \ of compression, each level having its own header format.  In the\n   first level,\
    \ RoHC sends 52 bytes of header; in the second level, the\n   header could be\
    \ from 34 to 15 bytes; and in the third level, header\n   size could be from 7\
    \ to 2 bytes.  The level of compression is managed\n   by a Sequence Number (SN),\
    \ which varies in size from 2 bytes to 4\n   bits in the minimal compression.\
    \  SN compression is done with an\n   algorithm called Window-Least Significant\
    \ Bits (W-LSB).  This window\n   has a 4-bit size representing 15 packets, so\
    \ every 15 packets, RoHC\n   needs to slide the window in order to receive the\
    \ correct SN, and\n   sliding the window implies a reduction of the level of compression.\n\
    \   When packets are lost or errored, the decompressor loses context and\n   drops\

    \ estimate the performance of RoHC, an average header\n   size is used.  This\
    \ average depends on the transmission conditions,\n   but most of the time is\
    \ between 3 and 4 bytes.\n   RoHC has not been adapted specifically to the constrained\
    \ hosts and\n   networks of LPWANs: it does not take into account energy limitations\n\
    \   nor the transmission rate.  Additionally, RoHC context is\n   synchronized\

    \ query/answer protocol as a precursor to other communication\n   within the Time-To-Live\
    \ (TTL) of a DNS answer is clearly problematic\n   in an LPWAN, say where only\
    \ one round-trip per hour can be used, and\n   with a TTL that is less than 3600\
    \ seconds.  It is currently unclear\n   whether and how DNS-like functionality\
    \ might be provided in LPWANs.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Most LPWAN technologies integrate some authentication\
    \ or encryption\n   mechanisms that were defined outside the IETF.  The LPWAN\
    \ WG may need\n   to do work to integrate these mechanisms to unify management.\
    \  A\n   standardized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\n  \
    \ infrastructure [RFC2904] may offer a scalable solution for some of\n   the security\
    \ and management issues for LPWANs.  AAA offers\n   centralized management that\
    \ may be of use in LPWANs, for example\n   [LoRaWAN-AUTH] and [LoRaWAN-RADIUS]\
    \ suggest possible security\n   processes for a LoRaWAN network.  Similar mechanisms\
    \ may be useful to\n   explore for other LPWAN technologies.\n   Some applications\
    \ using LPWANs may raise few or no privacy\n   considerations.  For example, temperature\
    \ sensors in a large office\n   building may not raise privacy issues.  However,\
    \ the same sensors, if\n   deployed in a home environment, and especially if triggered\
    \ due to\n   human presence, can raise significant privacy issues: if an end\n\
    \   device emits a (encrypted) packet every time someone enters a room in\n  \
    \ a home, then that traffic is privacy sensitive.  And the more that\n   the existence\
    \ of that traffic is visible to network entities, the\n   more privacy sensitivities\
    \ arise.  At this point, it is not clear\n   whether there are workable mitigations\
    \ for problems like this.  In a\n   more typical network, one would consider defining\
    \ padding mechanisms\n   and allowing for cover traffic.  In some LPWANs, those\
    \ mechanisms may\n   not be feasible.  Nonetheless, the privacy challenges do\
    \ exist and\n   can be real; therefore, some solutions will be needed.  Note that\n\
    \   many aspects of solutions in this space may not be visible in IETF\n   specifications\
    \ but can be, e.g., implementation or deployment\n   specific.\n   Another challenge\
    \ for LPWANs will be how to handle key management and\n   associated protocols.\
    \  In a more traditional network (e.g., the Web),\n   servers can \"staple\" Online\
    \ Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)\n   responses in order to allow browsers\
    \ to check revocation status for\n   presented certificates [RFC6961].  While\
    \ the stapling approach is\n   likely something that would help in an LPWAN, as\
    \ it avoids an RTT,\n   certificates and OCSP responses are bulky items and will\
    \ prove\n   challenging to handle in LPWANs with bounded bandwidth.\n"
