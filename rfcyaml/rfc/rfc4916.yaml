  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (RFC 3261 [1]) initiates\n
    \  sessions but also provides information on the identities of the\n   parties
    at both ends of a session.  Users need this information to\n   help determine
    how to deal with communications initiated by a SIP.\n   The identity of the party
    who answers a call can differ from that of\n   the initial called party for various
    reasons such as call forwarding,\n   call distribution and call pick-up.  Furthermore,
    once a call has\n   been answered, a party can be replaced by a different party
    with a\n   different identity for reasons such as call transfer, call park and\n
    \  retrieval, etc.  Although in some cases there can be reasons for not\n   disclosing
    these identities, it is desirable to have a mechanism for\n   providing this information.\n
    \  This document extends the use of the From header field to allow it to\n   convey
    what is commonly called \"connected identity\" information (the\n   identity of
    the connected user) in either direction within the\n   context of an existing
    INVITE-initiated dialog.  It can be used to\n   convey:\n   o  the callee identity
    to a caller when a call is answered;\n   o  the identity of a potential callee
    prior to answer; or\n   o  the identity of a user that replaces the caller or
    callee\n      following a call rearrangement such as call transfer carried out\n
    \     within the PSTN or within a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) using\n      third
    party call control techniques.\n      Note that the use of standard SIP call transfer
    techniques,\n      involving the REFER method, leads to the establishment of a
    new\n      dialog and hence normal mechanisms for caller and callee identity\n
    \     apply.\n   The provision of the identity of the responder in a response\n
    \  (commonly called \"response identity\") is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n
    \     Note that even if identity were to be conveyed somehow in a\n      response,
    there would in general be difficulty authenticating the\n      UAS.  Providing
    identity in a separate request allows normal\n      authentication techniques
    to be used.\n"

  - "3.  Overview of Solution\n   A mid-dialog request is used to provide connected
    identity.  The User\n   Agent Client (UAC) for that request inserts its identity
    in the From\n   header field of the request.  To provide authentication, the Identity\n
    \  header field (RFC 4474 [3]) is inserted by a suitable Authentication\n   Service
    on the path of the mid-dialog request.  Unless provided at\n   the UAC, the Authentication
    Service is expected to be at a proxy that\n   record routes and is able to authenticate
    the UAC.\n   A request in the opposite direction to the INVITE request prior to
    or\n   at the time the call is answered can indicate the identity of the\n   potential
    callee or callee respectively.  A request in the same\n   direction as the INVITE
    request prior to answer can indicate a change\n   of caller.  A request in either
    direction after answering can\n   indicate a change of the connected user.  In
    all cases, a dialog\n   (early or confirmed) has to be established before such
    a request can\n   be sent.\n   This solution uses the UPDATE method (RFC 3311
    [4]) for the request,\n   or in some circumstances the re-INVITE method.  To send
    the callee\n   identity, the UAS for the INVITE request sends the UPDATE request\n
    \  after sending the 2xx response to the INVITE request and after\n   receiving
    an ACK request.  To send the potential callee identity, RFC\n   3262 [5] is expected
    to be supported.  In this case, the UAS for the\n   INVITE request sends the UPDATE
    request after receiving and\n   responding to a PRACK request (which occurs after
    sending a reliable\n   1xx response to the INVITE request).  The UPDATE request
    could\n   conceivably be used for other purposes too, e.g., it could be used\n
    \  during an early dialog to send the potential callee identity at the\n   same
    time as a Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer for early\n   media.  To indicate
    a connected identity change during an established\n   call, either the UPDATE
    method or the re-INVITE method can be used.\n   The re-INVITE method would be
    used if required for other purposes\n   (e.g., when a B2BUA performs transfer
    using Third Party Call Control\n   (3PCC) techniques it has to issue a re-INVITE
    request without an SDP\n   offer to solicit an SDP offer from the UA).\n   This
    solution involves changing the URI (not the tags) in the To and\n   From header
    fields of mid-dialog requests and their responses,\n   compared with the corresponding
    values in the dialog forming request\n   and response.  Changing the To and From
    header field URIs was\n   contemplated in Section 12.2.1.1 of RFC 3261 [1], which
    says:\n      \"Usage of the URI from the To and From fields in the original\n
    \     request within subsequent requests is done for backwards\n      compatibility
    with RFC 2543 [6], which used the URI for dialog\n      identification.  In this
    specification, only the tags are used for\n      dialog identification.  It is
    expected that mandatory reflection\n      of the original To and From URI in mid-dialog
    requests will be\n      deprecated in a subsequent revision of this specification.\"\n
    \  This document therefore deprecates mandatory reflection of the\n   original
    To and From URIs in mid-dialog requests and their responses,\n   which constitutes
    a change to RFC 3261 [1].  This document makes no\n   provision for proxies that
    are unable to tolerate a change of URI,\n   since changing the URI has been expected
    for a considerable time.  To\n   cater for any UAs that are not able to tolerate
    a change of URI, a\n   new option tag \"from-change\" is introduced for providing
    a positive\n   indication of support in the Supported header field.  By sending
    a\n   request with a changed From header field URI only to targets that\n   have
    indicated support for this option, there is no need to send this\n   option tag
    in a Require header field.\n   In addition to allowing the From header field URI
    to change during a\n   dialog to reflect the connected identity, this document
    also requires\n   a UA that has received a connected identity in the URI of the
    From\n   header field of a mid-dialog request to use that URI in the To header\n
    \  field of any subsequent mid-dialog request sent by that UA.\n   In the absence
    of a suitable Authentication Service on the path of\n   the mid-dialog request,
    the UAS will receive an unauthenticated\n   connected identity (i.e., without
    a corresponding Identity header\n   field).  The implications of this are discussed
    in Section 7\n"

        a UA MUST observe the requirements\n   of RFC 4474 [3] when populating the
        From header field URI, including\n   provisions for achieving anonymity.\n
        \     This will allow an Authentication Service on the path of the mid-\n
        \     dialog request to insert an Identity header field.\n   When sending
        a mid-dialog request, a UA MUST populate the To header\n   field URI with
        the current value of the remote URI for that dialog,\n   where this is subject
        to update in accordance with the rules of\n   Section 4.4.2 of this document
        rather than being fixed at the\n   beginning of the dialog in accordance with
        RFC 3261 [1].\n   After sending a request with a revised From header field
        URI (i.e.,\n   revised compared to the URI sent in the From header field of
        the\n   previous request on this dialog or in the To header field of the\n
        \  received dialog-forming INVITE request if no request has been sent),\n
        \  the UA MUST send the same URI in the From header field of any future\n
        \  requests on the same dialog, unless the identity changes again.\n   Also,
        the UA MUST be prepared to receive the revised URI in the To\n   header field
        of subsequent mid-dialog requests and MUST also continue\n   to be prepared
        to receive the old URI at least until a request\n   containing the revised
        URI in the To header field has been received.\n   The mid-dialog request can
        be rejected in accordance with RFC 4474\n   [3] if the UAS does not accept
        the connected identity.  If the UAC\n   receives a 428, 436, 437, or 438 response
        to a mid-dialog request it\n   SHOULD regard the dialog as terminated in the
        case of a dialog-\n   terminating request and SHOULD take no action in the
        case of any\n   other request.\n      Any attempt to repeat the request or
        send any other mid-dialog\n      request is likely to result in the same response,

      a call is established between Alice and Bob, where\n   Bob (not shown) lies
      behind a B2BUA.  Bob's identity is conveyed by\n   an UPDATE request.  Then
      the B2BUA executes call transfer using third\n   party call control (3PCC) techniques
      as described in RFC 3725 [7]\n   (e.g., under the control of a click-to-dial
      application).  As a\n   result, Alice becomes connected to Carol (also not shown),
      and a re-\n   INVITE request is issued allowing the session to be renegotiated.\n
      \  The B2BUA provides the Authentication Service and thus generates the\n   Identity

    title: 5.2.  Sending Revised Connected Identity during a Call
  title: 5.  Examples
- contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification registers a new SIP option tag,
    as per the\n   guidelines in Section 27.1 of RFC 3261 [1].\n   This document defines
    the SIP option tag \"from-change\".\n   The following row has been added to the
    \"Option Tags\" section of the\n   SIP Parameter Registry:\n   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+\n
    \  | Name       | Description                              | Reference |\n   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+\n
    \  | from-change| This option tag is used to indicate that | [RFC4916] |\n   |
    \           | a UA supports changes to URIs in From    |           |\n   |            |
    and To header fields during a dialog.    |           |\n   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+\n"
  title: 6.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security considerations\n   RFC 4474 [3] discusses security considerations
    relating to the\n   Identity header field in some detail.  Those same considerations\n
    \  apply when using the Identity header field to authenticate a\n   connected
    identity in the From header field URI of a mid-dialog\n   request.\n   A received
    From header field URI in a mid-dialog request for which no\n   valid Identity
    header field (or other means of authentication) has\n   been received either in
    this request or in an earlier request on this\n   dialog cannot be trusted (except
    in very closed environments) and is\n   expected to be treated in a similar way
    to a From header field in a\n   dialog-initiating request that is not backed up
    by a valid Identity\n   header field.  However, it is recommended not to reject
    a mid-dialog\n   request on the grounds that the Identity header field is missing\n
    \  (since this would interfere with ongoing operation of the call).  The\n   absence
    of a valid Identity header field can influence the\n   information given to the
    user.  A UA can clear the call if policy or\n   user preference dictates.\n   A
    signed connected identity in a mid-dialog request (URI in the From\n   header
    field accompanied by a valid Identity header field) provides\n   information about
    the peer UA in a dialog.  In the case of the UA\n   that was the UAS in the dialog-forming
    request, this identity is not\n   necessarily the same as that in the To header
    field of the dialog-\n   forming request.  This is because of retargeting during
    the routing\n   of the dialog-forming request.  A signed connected identity says\n
    \  nothing about the legitimacy of such retargeting, but merely reflects\n   the
    result of that retargeting.  History information (RFC 4244 [8])\n   can provide
    additional hints as to how the connected user has been\n   reached.\n   Likewise,
    when a signed connected identity indicates a change of\n   identity during a dialog,
    it conveys no information about the reason\n   for such a change of identity or
    its legitimacy.\n   Use of the sips URI scheme can minimize the chances of attacks
    in\n   which inappropriate connected identity information is sent, either at\n
    \  call establishment time or during a call.\n   Anonymity can be required by
    the user of a connected UA.  For\n   anonymity the UA is expected to populate
    the URI in the From header\n   field of a mid-dialog request in the way described
    in RFC 4474 [3].\n"
