  - "Introduction\n   The Address Lifetime Expectancy (ALE) Working Group of the IETF\
    \ has\n   recorded the allocation of Internet addresses from the unallocated\n\
    \   address pool. ALE has noted that the existing practice of drawing\n   addresses\
    \ from the Class C space (192/3 address prefix) will result\n   in near to medium\
    \ term exhaustion of this section of the unallocated\n   address pool. The largest\
    \ remaining pool is in the Class A space,\n   where some 25% of Internet addresses\
    \ (the upper half of the Class A\n   space) remain, to date, unallocated.\n  \
    \ This document is a commentary on the potential recommendation that\n   the Internet\
    \ Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), through delegated\n   registries, commence\
    \ allocation of the presently unallocated\n   components of the Class A  address\
    \ space to registries, for\n   deployment within the Internet through the mechanism\
    \ of allocation of\n   class-less address prefixes.\n   The deployment of class-less\
    \ address prefixes from the Class A space\n   within the Internet will require\
    \ some changes to the routing\n   structure within Internet component network\
    \ domains. The motivation\n   for, and nature of, such changes as they effect\
    \ network domains and\n   network service providers are outlined in this document.\n"
- title: Current Practice with Address Allocations
  contents:
  - "Current Practice with Address Allocations\n   To date the allocation of class-less\
    \ network prefixed address blocks\n   has followed a conservative practice of\
    \ using address allocations\n   which are compatible superblocks of Class C addresses,\
    \ while the\n   allocation of addresses within the space of Class A and Class\
    \ B\n   networks has continued to be aligned with the class-based prefix\n   structure.\n\
    \   Within this address allocation environment for non-transit network\n   domains\
    \ there is accordingly the option to continue to use address\n   deployment strategies\
    \ which involve fixed subnet address structures\n   within contiguous areas, and\
    \ use Class-full interior routing\n   protocols. In the situation where variable\
    \ length subnet masks or\n   disconnected subnets are deployed within the network\
    \ domain's routing\n   structure, interior routing protocols which use subnet-based\
    \ routing\n   of Class-full networks can still be successfully deployed and the\
    \ end\n   network has the option of using an explicit or implicit sink subnet\n\
    \   default route. Where such non-transit network domains are connected\n   to\
    \ the Internet infrastructure the boundary exchange between the\n   non-transit\
    \ network and the network service provider (this term is\n   used as a synonym\
    \ for a transit network domain, which provides a\n   traffic transit service to\
    \ other non-transit and peer transit network\n   domains) is either a class-full\
    \ advertisement of routes, or an\n   aggregated address advertisement where the\
    \ aggregate is a superblock\n   of the deployed component class-full networks.\
    \ At the boundary points\n   of the non-transit network it is a requirement that\
    \ the non-transit\n   network's subnet default route (if used explicitly) not\
    \ be directed\n   to the network service provider's domain, to avoid a routing\
    \ loop at\n   the domain boundary point.\n   For network service providers the\
    \ interior routing protocol can use\n   either aggregated routing or explicit\
    \ class-full routing within this\n   environment. At the network service provider's\
    \ boundary peering\n   points the strongly recommended practice is to advertise\
    \ aggregated\n   routes to transit peers, which in turn may be further aggregated\n\
    \   across the Internet, within the parameters of permissible policies.\n"

- title: Network Service Providers Must Use Class-less Routing
  contents:
  - "Network Service Providers Must Use Class-less Routing\n   For network service\
    \ providers within the deployed Internet the\n   implications from this recommendation\
    \ to deploy prefixes from the\n   Class A address space add more pressure to the\
    \ requirement to\n   uniformly deploy class-less routing protocols. While this\
    \ is already\n   a mandatory requirement for any domain which operates without\
    \ a\n   default  route (ie. the provider carries full Internet routing and\n \
    \  effectively  calculates default), other providers currently can use\n   an\
    \ imported default route and operate within a class-full routing\n   configuration.\
    \ This mode of operation is sub-optimal, in so far as\n   the task of aggregating\
    \ routes falls on peer network service\n   providers performing proxy aggregation\
    \ of contiguous class-full\n   address blocks.\n   In deploying components of\
    \ the Class A the use of proxy aggregation\n   is no longer sufficient. Where\
    \ a domain sees a default route and a\n   subnet of a Class A route the routing\
    \ structure, in a class-full\n   configuration, may not necessarily follow the\
    \ default route to reach\n   other parts of the Class A network not covered by\
    \ the advertised\n   Class A subnet route.\n   Accordingly for Network Service\
    \ Providers operating within the\n   Internet domain the deployment of components\
    \ of the Class A space\n   entails a requirement to deploy class-less routing\
    \ protocols, even in\n   the presence of a default route. It is noted that this\
    \ absolute\n   requirement is not the case at present.\n"
- title: Consideration of Non-Transit Network Configurations
  contents:
  - "Consideration of Non-Transit Network Configurations\n   For disconnected network\
    \ environments, where the network domain is\n   operated with no links to any\
    \ peer networking domain, such networks\n   can continue to use class-full interior\
    \ routing protocols with subnet\n   support. Allocation of addresses using prefix\
    \ blocks from the Class A\n   space within such environments is possible without\
    \ adding any\n   additional routing or address deployment restrictions on the\
    \ network\n   domain.\n   For non-transit network domains which are connected\
    \ to one or more\n   peer network domains the situation does involve consideration\
    \ of\n   additional factors. The observation which is made in the context of\n\
    \   this consideration is that there are at present relatively few non-\n   transit\
    \ networks operating a fully class-less interior routing\n   protocol, as there\
    \ has been no absolute requirement for this\n   functionality when using single\
    \ class-full network addresses, or when\n   using block prefixed address allocations\
    \ which are clusters of class-\n   full network addresses.\n   For non-transit\
    \ network domains which support external peer\n   connections to a network service\
    \ provider, deployment of a component\n   of the Class A space would be supportable\
    \ using a fully class-less\n   interior routing protocol.\n   In this case there\
    \ is an additional constraint placed on the external\n   connection such that\
    \ the non-transit domain either agrees that the\n   network service will undertake\
    \ proxy aggregation of the advertised\n   class-less address components, or the\
    \ network domain is configured to\n   advertise to the provider an aggregate route.\
    \ In both cases the\n   aggregate route must be either the allocated address block,\
    \ or a\n   fully contained sub-block. Advertising aggregatable address blocks\n\
    \   without proxy aggregation permission, or advertising multiple sub-\n   blocks\
    \ of the registry allocated address block is considered overly\n   deleterious\
    \ to the provider's internetworking environment due to\n   considerations of consequent\
    \ growth in routing table size.\n   If the externally connected non-transit network\
    \ domain uses class-\n   full interior routing protocols then deployment of Class\
    \ A address\n   space prefixes implies that the domain must configure the Class\
    \ A\n   subnet default route along the same path as the default route to the\n\
    \   network service provider (which is noted to be the exact opposite of\n   the\
    \ necessary routing configuration for those address prefixes which\n   are either\
    \ aligned to class-full address boundaries or are super\n   blocks of such class-full\
    \ address blocks). The network service\n   provider may also receive leaked explicit\
    \ subnet reachability\n   information in such a routing configuration, potentially\
    \ placing the\n   responsibility for advertising the correct aggregate address\
    \ block\n   with the network service provider as a case of proxied aggregation.\n\
    \   Within this configuration model, even when explicit subnet default\n   routing\
    \ is deployed, there is the risk of unintentional traffic\n   leakage and routing\
    \ loops. If the network service provider is\n   undertaking proxy aggregation\
    \ using the registry allocated address\n   block then traffic originating within\
    \ the non-transit domain which is\n   (mis)directed to non-deployed components\
    \ of the address block will\n   loop at the interface between the network domain\
    \ and the provider. If\n   the network service provider is configured to explicitly\
    \ route only\n   those address components which are also explicitly routed within\
    \ the\n   non-transit domain, such (mis)directed traffic will be passed through\n\
    \   the internetworking environment along the default route until a\n   default-less\
    \ routing point is encountered, where it can then be\n   discarded. The outcome\
    \ of this consideration is that the non-transit\n   network domain should explicitly\
    \ configure sink subnet routes for all\n   non-deployed components of the allocated\
    \ address block, and\n   conservative operational practice would be to configure\
    \ the proxy\n   aggregation undertaken by the network service provider to aggregate\n\
    \   according to the registry allocated address block.\n   There is an additional\
    \ constraint placed on the non-transit network\n   domain using class-full interior\
    \ routing protocols, such that the\n   domain has no other exterior peer connections\
    \ to other network\n   domains which deploy class-full routing interior routing\
    \ protocols.\n   There is the further constraint placed on the of use of interior\n\
    \   class-full routing protocols within a non-transit network domain. In\n   the\
    \ case where the non-transit network domain has multiple exterior\n   connections\
    \ to Network Service Providers (ie the network domain is\n   multiply homed within\
    \ a number of network providers) there is the\n   possibility that each provider\
    \ may wish to announce components of the\n   same Class A parent. Accordingly\
    \ the network domain must use a class-\n   less interior routing protocol in the\
    \ case where the network domain\n   is multiply homed within network service providers.\n\
    \   There are also additional constraints placed on the non-transit\n   network\
    \ domain where the network has exterior connections to other\n   peer networks.\
    \ Even in the case where the network domain uses a\n   class-less interior routing\
    \ protocol, there is the additional\n   consideration that this requirement for\
    \ use of a class-less routing\n   domain is transitive to other connected network\
    \ domains. An second\n   network domain, externally connected to the class-less\
    \ domain routing\n   part of the Class A space, will interpret the boundary reachability\n\
    \   advertisement as a complete Class A network advertisement, if using\n   class-full\
    \ routing. Even if both network domains are connected to the\n   same network\
    \ provider the provider's default routing  advertisement\n   default to the class-full\
    \ domain will be overridden by the assumed\n   class A advertisement through the\
    \ domain-to-domain connection,\n   leading to unintended traffic diversion. The\
    \ diversion occurs in this\n   case as the traffic directed to parts of the Class\
    \ A network which\n   are not deployed within the first domain will transit the\
    \ first\n   domain before entering the network service provider's domain.\n  \
    \ It is also possible to have configurations with unintended routing\n   holes.\
    \ An example of such a configuration is two stub clients of\n   different network\
    \ service providers, both using class-less interior\n   routing (X and Y), both\
    \ directly connected to a third network domain\n   (Z), which uses class-full\
    \ interior routing, which is configured as a\n   transit between X and Y. X's\
    \ advertisement of a component of a Class\n   A to Z will be assumed by Z to be\
    \ a complete Class A network, and as\n   such will be advertised to Y, overriding\
    \ Y's default route received\n   from the network service provider. Y will pass\
    \ all Class A addressed\n   traffic to Z, who will in turn pass it to X. As X\
    \ is configured as a\n   non-transit stub network X must discard all non-locally\
    \ addressed\n   traffic.\n   Thus reasonable operational practice would be to\
    \ ensure that if a\n   network domain deploys a component of the Class A address\
    \ space, the\n   network domain is configured to use class-less interior routing\n\
    \   protocols, and the network has a single exterior connection to a\n   class-less\
    \ network provider domain, with the boundary configured as a\n   class-less routing\
    \ exchange. Multiply homed network domains do infer\n   a common requirement of\
    \ class-less routing exchanges and interior\n   class-less routing protocols across\
    \ all peer connected network\n   domains.\n   It is possible to propose that multi\
    \ homed network domains should\n   probably not get subnets of a class A for these\
    \ reasons, although\n   with an increasing diversity of network service providers\
    \ instances\n   of multi-homed network domains may become more prevalent, and\
    \ the\n   requirement to transition to an interior class-less routing structure\n\
    \   as a consequence of moving to a multi-homed configuration may not be\n   explicitly\
    \ apparent to all network domains.\n"

  - "Potential Guidelines for Allocation of an Address Prefix from the Class\n   A\
    \ Address Space\n   To summarise the possible guidelines for allocation from the\
    \ Class A\n   space, such addresses should only be assigned to network domains\n\
    \   which:\n    - have no exterior connection (in which case the domain can use\n\
    \      either class-full or class-less interior routing protocols without\n  \
    \    further implication),\n    or\n    - are a component of a private internet\

    \ scenario\n      given a probable direction to use the Class A space as the major\n\
    \      resource for the unallocated pool of addresses for allocation),\n    or\n\

    \ to nominate a transition objective to\n   the final configuration (uniform use\
    \ of class-less routing domains\n   within the Internet) which would enable deployment\
    \ of components of\n   the Class A space uniformly across the Internet.\n"
- title: Related Potential Activities
  contents:
  - "Related Potential Activities\n   Given the pressures on the remaining Class C\
    \ address space in the\n   unallocated address pool, it is noted that there would\
    \ be widespread\n   deployment of components of the remaining Class A space in\
    \ class-less\n   allocation guidelines. There is a consequent requirement for\n\
    \   widespread deployment of class-less interior routing protocols in\n   order\
    \ to ensure continued correct operation of the routed Internet.\n   This is a\
    \ more significant transition than that deployed to date with\n   the network\
    \ service providers' deployment of Class-less Inter-Domain\n   Routing (CIDR)\
    \ protocols, in that there is a necessary transition to\n   deploy Class-less\
    \ Interior Routing Protocols (CIRP) within a large\n   number of network domains\
    \ which are currently configured with class-\n   full routing.\n   However this\
    \ would appear to be a necessary task if we wish to\n   continue to utilise a\
    \ pool of globally unique Internet addresses to\n   allocate to new systems and\
    \ networks, but one requiring significant\n   effort considering the space of\
    \ the routing transition required to\n   make this work.\n   There are a number\
    \ of directed activities which can assist in this\n   transition:\n    - The network\
    \ registries commence initial class-less allocation from\n      the unallocated\
    \ Class A space to those entities who either:\n      o  operate a CIRP environment,\
    \ and either have no external\n         connectivity, or are singly homed to a\
    \ network service provider\n         using a CIDR environment, with no other exterior\
    \ connections,\n      or\n      o  operate a class-full routing protocol, and\
    \ either have no\n         external connectivity, or are singly homed to a network\
    \ service\n         provider using a CIDR environment, with no other exterior\n\
    \         connections, and are willing to point the subnet default route\n   \
    \      towards the network service provider.\n    - In deploying the Class A space\
    \ there is a requirement within the\n      vendors' product sets to allow explicit\
    \ configuration of whether\n      the router operates in a class-less or class-full\
    \ mode, with\n      correct behaviour of the default route in each case. Class-full\n\
    \      mode of operation must also allow explicit configuration of\n      subnet\
    \ default behaviour as to whether to follow the default\n      route, or to operate\
    \ a subnet default sink.\n    - There is a similar, but longer term, activity\
    \ within the host\n      configuration environment to support a mode of address\n\
    \      configuration which uses a local network prefix and host address,\n   \
    \   possibly in addition to the current configuration mode of class-\n      full\
    \ network, subnet and host address\n    - Internet Service Providers also must\
    \ support full class-less\n      configurations in both interior routing configurations\
    \ and\n      interdomain peering routing exchanges, and provide support to\n \
    \     client network domains operating a class-less boundary routing\n      exchange\
    \ configuration and be able to undertake proxy aggregation\n      as permitted.\n"
