Abstract LSP Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks.
However, in the present form, this mechanism is inadequate to verify connectivity of a segment of a Multi Segment Pseudowire (MS PW)
and/or bidirectional co routed Label Switched Path (LSP) from any node on the path of the MS PW and/or bidirectional co routed LSP.
This document defines a TLV to address this shortcoming.
An MS PW may span across multiple service provider networks.
In order to allow Service Providers (SPs) to verify segments of such MS PWs from any node on the path of the MS PW, any node along the path of the MS PW, should be able to originate an MPLS Echo Request packet to any other node along the path of the MS PW and receive the corresponding MPLS Echo Reply.
If the originator of the MPLS Echo Request is at the end of a MS PW, the receiver of the request can send the reply back to the sender without knowing the hop count distance of the originator.
The reply will be intercepted by the originator regardless of the TTL value on the reply packet.
But, if the originator is not at the end of the MS PW, the receiver of the MPLS Echo Request may need to know how many hops away the originator of the MPLS Echo Request is so that it can set the TTL value on the MPLS header for the MPLS Echo Reply to be intercepted at the originator node.
In MPLS networks, for bidirectional co routed LSPs, if it is desired to verify connectivity from any intermediate node Label Switching Router (LSR) on the LSP to the any other LSR on the LSP the receiver may need to know the TTL to send the MPLS Echo Reply with, so as the packet is intercepted by the originator node.
A new optional TTL TLV is defined in this document.
This TLV will be added by the originator of the MPLS Echo Request to inform the receiver how many hops away the originator is on the path of the MS PW or bidirectional LSP.
This mechanism only works if the MPLS Echo Reply is sent down the co routed LSP; hence, the scope of this TTL TLV is currently limited to MS PW or bidirectional co routed
The presence of the TLV implies the use of the return path of the co routed LSP, if the return path is any other mechanism, then the TLV in the MPLS
Echo Request MUST be ignored.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119

Time To Live TLV Format
The TTL TLV has the format shown in Figure 1.
One flag is defined for now, the R flag.
The rest of the flags are Reserved MUST be zero (MBZ) when sending and ignored on receipt.
The R flag (Reply TTL) is set signify that the value is meant to be used as the TTL for the reply packet.
Other bits may be defined later to enhance the scope of this TLV.
The TTL TLV MAY be included in the MPLS Echo Request by the originator of the request.
If the TTL TLV is present and the receiver does not understand TTL TLVs, it will simply ignore the TLV, as is the case for all optional TLVs.
If the TTL TLV is not present or is not processed by the receiver, any determination of the TTL value used in the MPLS label on the LSP Ping echo reply is beyond the scope of this document.
If the TTL TLV is present and the receiver understands TTL TLVs, one of the following two conditions apply:  If the TTL TLV value field is zero, the LSP Ping echo request packet SHOULD be dropped.
Otherwise, the receiver MUST use the TTL value specified in the TTL TLV when it creates the MPLS header of the MPLS Echo Reply.
The TTL value in the TTL TLV takes precedence over any TTL value determined by other means, such as from the Switching Point TLV in the MS PW.
This precedence will aid the originator of the LSP  Ping echo request in analyzing the return path.
In this section, we explain a use case for the TTL TLV with an MPLS MS PW.
Use Case with MS PWs
Let us assume an MS PW going through LSRs A, B, C, D, and E. Furthermore, assume that an operator wants to perform a connectivity check between B and D, from B.
Thus, an MPLS Echo Request with the TTL TLV is originated from B and sent towards D.
The MPLS Echo Request packet contains the FEC of the PW Segment between C and D.
The value field of the TTL TLV and the TTL field of the MPLS label are set to 2, the choice of the value 2 will be based on the operator input requesting the MPLS Echo Request or from the optional LDP switching point TLV.
The MPLS Echo Request is intercepted at D because of TTL expiry.
D detects the TTL TLV in the request and uses the TTL value (i.e., 2) specified in the TLV on the MPLS label of the MPLS Echo Reply.
The MPLS Echo Reply will be intercepted by B because of TTL expiry.
The same operation will apply when we have a co routed bidirectional LSP
and we want to check connectivity from an intermediate LSR "B" to another LSR "D".
In traceroute mode, the TTL value in the TLV is set to 1 for the first Echo Request, then to 2 for the next, and so on.
This is similar to the TTL values used for the label set on the packet.
It is possible that the MPLS Echo Request packet was intercepted before the intended destination for reasons other than label TTL expiry.
This could be due to network faults, misconfiguration, or other reasons.
In such cases, if the return TTL is set to the value specified in the TTL TLV, then the echo response packet will continue beyond the originating node.
This becomes a security issue.
To prevent this, the label TTL value used in the MPLS Echo Reply packet MUST be modified by deducting the incoming label TTL on the received packet from TTL TLV value.
If the MPLS Echo Request packet is punted to the CPU before the incoming label TTL is deducted, then another 1 MUST be added.
In other words: Return TTL Value on the MPLS Echo Reply packet
(Incoming Label TTL)   1 5.
This document allows the setting of the TTL value in the MPLS Label of an MPLS Echo Reply, so that it can be intercepted by an intermediate device.
This can cause a device to get a lot of LSP  Ping packets that get redirected to the CPU.
However, the same is possible even without the changes mentioned in this document.
A device should rate limit
the LSP Ping packets redirected to the CPU so that the CPU is not overwhelmed.
The recommendation in the Security Considerations of [RFC4379] applies, to check the source address of the MPLS Echo Request; however, the source address can now be any node along the LSP path.
A faulty transit node changing the TTL TLV value could make the wrong node reply to the MPLS Echo Request,
and/or the wrong node to receive the MPLS Echo Reply.
An LSP trace may help identify the faulty transit node.
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned a TLV type value to the following TLV from the "Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" registry in the "TLVs" subregistry.
To Live TLV (see Section 3).
IANA has allocated the value 32769.
