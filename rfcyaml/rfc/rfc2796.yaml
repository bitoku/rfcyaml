  - "Abstract\n   The Border Gateway Protocol [1] is an inter-autonomous system routing\n\
    \   protocol designed for TCP/IP internets. Currently in the Internet BGP\n  \
    \ deployments are configured such that that all BGP speakers within a\n   single\
    \ AS must be fully meshed so that any external routing\n   information must be\
    \ re-distributed to all other routers within that\n   AS. This represents a serious\
    \ scaling problem that has been  well\n   documented with several alternatives\
    \ proposed [2,3].\n   This document describes the use and design of a method known\
    \ as\n   \"Route Reflection\" to alleviate the the need for \"full mesh\" IBGP.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Currently in the Internet, BGP deployments are configured\
    \ such that\n   that all BGP speakers within a single AS must be fully meshed\
    \ and any\n   external routing information must be re-distributed to all other\n\
    \   routers within that AS.  For n BGP speakers within an AS that\n   requires\
    \ to maintain n*(n-1)/2 unique IBGP sessions.  This \"full\n   mesh\" requirement\
    \ clearly does not scale when there are a large\n   number of IBGP speakers each\
    \ exchanging a large volume of routing\n   information, as is common in many of\
    \ todays internet networks.\n   This scaling problem has been well documented\
    \ and a number of\n   proposals have been made to alleviate this [2,3]. This document\n\
    \   represents another alternative in alleviating the need for a \"full\n   mesh\"\
    \ and is known as \"Route Reflection\". This approach allows a BGP\n   speaker\
    \ (known as \"Route Reflector\") to advertise IBGP learned routes\n   to certain\
    \ IBGP peers.  It represents a change in the commonly\n   understood concept of\
    \ IBGP, and the addition of two new optional\n   transitive BGP attributes to\
    \ prevent loops in routing updates.\n   This document is a revision of RFC1966\
    \ [4], and it includes editorial\n   changes, clarifications and corrections based\
    \ on the deployment\n   experience with route reflection. These revisions are\
    \ summarized in\n   the Appendix.\n"
- title: 2.  Design Criteria
  contents:
  - "2.  Design Criteria\n   Route Reflection was designed to satisfy the following\
    \ criteria.\n      o  Simplicity\n         Any alternative must be both simple\
    \ to configure as well as\n         understand.\n      o  Easy Transition\n  \
    \       It must be possible to transition from a full mesh\n         configuration\
    \ without the need to change either topology or AS.\n         This is an unfortunate\
    \ management overhead of the technique\n         proposed in [3].\n      o  Compatibility\n\
    \         It must be possible for non compliant IBGP peers to continue be\n  \
    \       part of the original AS or domain without any loss of BGP\n         routing\
    \ information.\n   These criteria were motivated by operational experiences of\
    \ a very\n   large and topology rich network with many external connections.\n"

  - "4.  Terminology and Concepts\n   We use the term \"Route Reflection\" to describe\
    \ the operation of a BGP\n   speaker advertising an IBGP learned route to another\
    \ IBGP peer.  Such\n   a BGP speaker is said to be a \"Route Reflector\" (RR),\
    \ and such a\n   route is said to be a reflected route.\n   The internal peers\
    \ of a RR are divided into two groups:\n           1) Client Peers\n         \
    \  2) Non-Client Peers\n   A RR reflects routes between these groups, and may\
    \ reflect routes\n   among client peers.  A RR along with its client peers form\
    \ a Cluster.\n   The Non-Client peer must be fully meshed but the Client peers\
    \ need\n   not be fully meshed.  Figure 3 depicts a simple example outlining the\n\

- title: 5. Operation
  contents:
  - "5. Operation\n   When a RR receives a route from an IBGP peer, it selects the\
    \ best\n   path based on its path selection rule. After the best path is\n   selected,\
    \ it must do the following depending on the type of the peer\n   it is receiving\
    \ the best path from:\n      1) A Route from a Non-Client IBGP peer\n        \
    \ Reflect to all the Clients.\n      2) A Route from a Client peer\n         Reflect\
    \ to all the Non-Client peers and also to the Client\n         peers. (Hence the\
    \ Client peers are not required to be fully\n         meshed.)\n   An Autonomous\
    \ System could have many RRs. A RR treats other RRs just\n   like any other internal\
    \ BGP speakers. A RR could be configured to\n   have other RRs in a Client group\
    \ or Non-client group.\n   In a simple configuration the backbone could be divided\
    \ into many\n   clusters. Each RR would be configured with other RRs as Non-Client\n\
    \   peers (thus all the RRs will be fully meshed.). The Clients will be\n   configured\
    \ to maintain IBGP session only with the RR in their\n   cluster. Due to route\
    \ reflection, all the IBGP speakers will receive\n   reflected routing information.\n\
    \   It is possible in a Autonomous System to have BGP speakers that do\n   not\
    \ understand the concept of Route-Reflectors (let us call them\n   conventional\
    \ BGP speakers). The Route-Reflector Scheme allows such\n   conventional BGP speakers\
    \ to co-exist. Conventional BGP speakers\n   could be either members of a Non-Client\
    \ group or a Client group. This\n   allows for an easy and gradual migration from\
    \ the current IBGP model\n   to the Route Reflection model. One could start creating\
    \ clusters by\n   configuring a single router as the designated RR and configuring\n\
    \   other RRs and their clients as normal IBGP peers. Additional clusters\n  \
    \ can be created gradually.\n"
- title: 6.  Redundant RRs
  contents:
  - "6.  Redundant RRs\n   Usually a cluster of clients will have a single RR. In\
    \ that case, the\n   cluster will be identified by the ROUTER_ID of the RR. However,\
    \ this\n   represents a single point of failure so to make it possible to have\n\
    \   multiple RRs in the same cluster, all RRs in the same cluster can be\n   configured\
    \ with a 4-byte CLUSTER_ID so that an RR can discard routes\n   from other RRs\
    \ in the same cluster.\n"
- title: 7.  Avoiding Routing Information Loops
  contents:
  - "7.  Avoiding Routing Information Loops\n   When a route is reflected, it is possible\
    \ through mis-configuration\n   to form route re-distribution loops. The Route\
    \ Reflection method\n   defines the following attributes to detect and avoid routing\n\
    \   information loops:\n   ORIGINATOR_ID\n   ORIGINATOR_ID is a new optional,\
    \ non-transitive BGP attribute of Type\n   code 9. This attribute is 4 bytes long\
    \ and it will be created by a RR\n   in reflecting a route.  This attribute will\
    \ carry the ROUTER_ID of\n   the originator of the route in the local AS. A BGP\
    \ speaker should not\n   create an ORIGINATOR_ID attribute if one already exists.\
    \  A router\n   which recognizes the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute should ignore a route\n\
    \   received with its ROUTER_ID as the ORIGINATOR_ID.\n   CLUSTER_LIST\n   Cluster-list\
    \ is a new optional, non-transitive BGP attribute of Type\n   code 10. It is a\
    \ sequence of CLUSTER_ID values representing the\n   reflection path that the\
    \ route has passed. It is encoded as follows:\n             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\
    \ 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3\n    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \    |  Attr. Flags  |Attr. Type Code|   Length      | value ...\n    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   Where Length is the number of octets.\n   When a RR reflects a route, it must\
    \ prepend the local CLUSTER_ID to\n   the CLUSTER_LIST.  If the CLUSTER_LIST is\
    \ empty, it must create a new\n   one. Using this attribute an RR can identify\
    \ if the routing\n   information is looped back to the same cluster due to mis-\n\
    \   configuration. If the local CLUSTER_ID is found in the cluster-list,\n   the\
    \ advertisement received should be ignored.\n"
- title: 8. Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "8. Implementation Considerations\n   Care should be taken to make sure that none\
    \ of the BGP path\n   attributes defined above can be modified through configuration\
    \ when\n   exchanging internal routing information between RRs and Clients and\n\
    \   Non-Clients. Their modification could potential result in routing\n   loops.\n\
    \   In addition, when a RR reflects a route, it should not modify the\n   following\
    \ path attributes: NEXT_HOP, AS_PATH, LOCAL_PREF, and MED.\n   Their modification\
    \ could potential result in routing loops.\n"
- title: 9. Configuration and Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "9. Configuration and Deployment Considerations\n   The BGP protocol provides\
    \ no way for a Client to identify itself\n   dynamically as a Client of an RR.\
    \  The simplest way to achieve this\n   is by manual configuration.\n   One of\
    \ the key component of the route reflection approach in\n   addressing the scaling\
    \ issue is that the RR summarizes routing\n   information and only reflects its\
    \ best path.\n   Both MEDs and IGP metrics may impact the BGP route selection.\n\
    \   Because MEDs are not always comparable and the IGP metric may differ\n   for\
    \ each router, with certain route reflection topologies the route\n   reflection\
    \ approach may not yield the same route selection result as\n   that of the full\
    \ IBGP mesh approach. A way to make route selection\n   the same as it would be\
    \ with the full IBGP mesh approach is to make\n   sure that route reflectors are\
    \ never forced to perform the BGP route\n   selection based on IGP metrics which\
    \ are significantly different from\n   the IGP metrics of their clients, or based\
    \ on incomparable MEDs. The\n   former can be achieved by configuring the intra-cluster\
    \ IGP metrics\n   to be better than the inter-cluster IGP metrics, and maintaining\
    \ full\n   mesh within the cluster. The latter can be achieved by:\n      o  setting\
    \ the local preference of a route at the border router to\n         reflect the\
    \ MED values.\n      o  or by making sure the AS-path lengths from different ASs\
    \ are\n         different when the AS-path length is used as a route selection\n\
    \         criteria.\n      o  or by configuring community based policies using\
    \ which the\n         reflector can decide on the best route.\n   One could argue\
    \ though that the latter requirement is overly\n   restrictive, and perhaps impractical\
    \ in some cases.  One could\n   further argue that as long as there are no routing\
    \ loops, there are\n   no compelling reasons to force route selection with route\
    \ reflectors\n   to be the same as it would be with the full IBGP mesh approach.\n\
    \   To prevent routing loops and maintain consistent routing view, it is\n   essential\
    \ that the network topology be carefully considered in\n   designing a route reflection\
    \ topology. In general, the route\n   reflection topology should congruent with\
    \ the network topology when\n   there exist multiple paths for a prefix. One commonly\
    \ used approach\n   is the POP-based reflection, in which each POP maintains its\
    \ own\n   route reflectors serving clients in the POP, and all route reflectors\n\
    \   are fully meshed. In addition, clients of the reflectors in each POP\n   are\
    \ often fully meshed for the purpose of optimal intra-POP routing,\n   and the\
    \ intra-POP IGP metrics are configured to be better than the\n   inter-POP IGP\
    \ metrics.\n"
