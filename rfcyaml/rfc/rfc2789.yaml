  - "1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently
    consists of five major\n   components:\n   o   An overall architecture, described
    in RFC 2571 [1].\n   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
    for the\n       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of\n
    \      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n       16,
    RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The\n       second version,
    called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n       [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6]
    and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].\n   o   Message protocols for transferring management
    information. The\n       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
    SNMPv1 and\n       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the
    SNMP\n       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n       protocol,
    is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC\n       1906 [10].  The
    third version of the message protocol is called\n       SNMPv3 and described in
    RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574\n       [12].\n   o   Protocol operations
    for accessing management information. The\n       first set of protocol operations
    and associated PDU formats is\n       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second
    set of protocol\n       operations and associated PDU formats is described in
    RFC 1905\n       [13].\n   o   A set of fundamental applications described in
    RFC 2573 [14] and\n       the view-based access control mechanism described in
    RFC 2575\n       [15].\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
    store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB
    are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies
    a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1
    can be produced through the appropriate\n   translations. The resulting translated
    MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted
    because no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable\n
    \  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1
    during the translation process. However, this loss of machine\n   readable information
    is not considered to change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"

  - "2.  Message Flow Model\n   A general model of message flow inside an MTA has
    to be presented\n   before a MIB can be described. Generally speaking, message
    flow is\n   modelled as occurring in four steps:\n   (1) Messages are received
    by the MTA from User Agents, Message\n       Stores, other MTAs, and gateways.\n
    \  (2) The \"next hop\" for the each message is determined. This is simply\n       the
    destination the message is to be transmitted to; it may or\n       may not be
    the final destination of the message. Multiple \"next\n       hops\" may exist
    for a single message (as a result of either\n       having multiple recipients
    or distribution list expansion); this\n       may make it necessary to duplicate
    messages.\n   (3) If necessary messages are converted into the format that's\n
    \      appropriate for the next hop. Conversion operations may be\n       successful
    or unsuccessful.\n   (4) Messages are transmitted to the appropriate destination,
    which\n       may be a User Agent, Message Store, another MTA, or gateway.\n   Storage
    of messages in the MTA occurs at some point during this\n   process.  However,
    it is important to note that storage may occur at\n   different and possibly even
    multiple points during this process. For\n   example, some MTAs expand messages
    into multiple copies as they are\n   received. In this case (1), (2), and (3)
    may all occur prior to\n   storage. Other MTAs store messages precisely as they
    are received and\n   perform all expansions and conversions during retransmission\n
    \  processing. So here only (1) occurs prior to storage.  This leads to\n   situations
    where, in general, a measurement of messages received may\n   not equal a measurement
    of messages in store, or a measurement of\n   messages stored may not equal a
    measurement of messages\n   retransmitted, or both.\n"

  - "3.  MTA Objects\n   If there are one or more MTAs on the host, the following
    MIB may be\n   used to monitor them. Any number of the MTAs on a single host or\n
    \  group of hosts may be monitored. Each MTA is dealt with as a separate\n   network
    service and has its own applTable entry in the Network\n   Services Monitoring
    MIB.\n   The MIB described in this document covers only the portion which is\n
    \  specific to the monitoring of MTAs. The network service related part\n   of
    the MIB is covered in RFC 2788 [16].\n   This MIB defines four tables. The first
    of these contains per-MTA\n   information that isn't specific to any particular
    part of MTA. The\n   second breaks each MTA down into a collection of separate
    components\n   called groups. Groups are described in detail in the comments\n
    \  embedded in the MIB below. The third table provides a means of\n   correlating
    associations tracked by the network services MIB with\n   specific groups within
    different MTAs. Finally, the fourth table\n   provides a means of tracking any
    errors encountered during the\n   operation of the MTA. The first two tables must
    be implemented to\n   conform with this MIB; the last two are optional.\n"

    for each\n   -- different entity that receives messages and for each entity\n
    \  -- the MTA stores messages for and delivers messages to.  Other\n   -- MTAs
    may elect to treat all reception equally, all queue\n   -- storage equally, all

    \  -- variables across groups may not produce values equal to those in\n   --
    the mtaTable. mtaTable should always provide accurate information\n   -- about
    the MTA as a whole.\n   -- The term \"channel\" is often used in MTA implementations;
    channels\n   -- are usually, but not always, equivalent to a group. However,\n
    \  -- this MIB does not use the term \"channel\" because there is no\n   -- requirement
    that an MTA supporting this MIB has to map its\n   -- \"channel\" abstraction
    one-to-one onto the MIB's group abstraction.\n   -- An MTA may create a group
    or group of groups at any time. Once\n   -- created, however, an MTA cannot delete
    an entry for a group from\n   -- the group table.  Deletion is only allowed when
    the MTA is\n   -- reinitialized, and is not required even then.  This restriction\n
    \  -- is imposed so that monitoring agents can rely on group\n   -- assignments
    being consistent across multiple query operations.\n   -- Groups may be laid out
    so as to form a hierarchical arrangement,\n   -- with some groups acting as subgroups
    for other groups.\n   -- Alternately, disjoint groups of groups may be used to
    provide\n   -- different sorts of \"snapshots\" of MTA operation.  The\n   --
    mtaGroupHierarchy variable provides an indication of how each\n   -- group fits
    into the overall arrangement being used.\n   -- Note that SNMP also defines and
    uses term \"group\". MTA groups are\n   -- NOT the same as SNMP groups.\n   mtaGroupTable

    technical errors in the\n   construction of the mail monitoring MIB in RFC 2249
    [18]:\n   (1) All DisplayStrings have been changed to SnmpAdminStrings,\n   (2)
    the conformance groups for different versions of this MIB have\n       been corrected,\n
    \  (3) the required mtaStatusCode entry has been added to\n       MtaGroupErrorEntry
    (which does not affect the bits on the wire in\n       any way), and\n   (4) the
    recommendation that an empty string be returned if the last\n       operation
    was successful has been removed from\n       mtaGroupInboundRejectionReason and\n
    \      mtaGroupOutboundConnectFailureReason as it conflicts with the\n       stated

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this
    MIB that have a MAX-\n   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So,
    if this MIB is\n   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
    can\n   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP\n   SET
    operations.\n   However, this MIB does provide passive information about the\n
    \  existence, type, and configuration of applications on a given host\n   that
    could potentially indicate some sort of vulnerability. Finally,\n   the information
    MIB provides about network usage could be used to\n   analyze network traffic
    patterns.\n   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n
    \  itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control
    as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider
    the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,
    the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based\n
    \  Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user
    responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance
    of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to
    those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n
    \  (change/create/delete) them.\n"
