- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) [XACML-3]\n\
    \   defines an architecture and a language for access control\n   (authorization).\
    \  The language consists of requests, responses, and\n   policies.  Clients send\
    \ a request to a server to query whether a\n   given action should be allowed.\
    \  The server evaluates the request\n   against the available policies and returns\
    \ a response.  The policies\n   implement the organization's access control requirements.\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification details the registry of an XML-based\
    \ media type\n   for the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) that\
    \ has\n   been registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\n\
    \   following the \"Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures\"\n\
    \   [RFC6838].  The XACML media type represents an XACML request,\n   response,\
    \ or policy in the XML-based format defined by the core XACML\n   specification\
    \ [XACML-3].\n"
- title: 2.1.  XACML Media Type application/xacml+xml
  contents:
  - "2.1.  XACML Media Type application/xacml+xml\n   This specification details the\
    \ registration of an XML-based media\n   type for the eXtensible Access Control\
    \ Markup Language (XACML).\n   Media Type Name: application\n   Subtype Name:\
    \ xacml+xml\n   Required Parameters: none\n   Optional Parameters:\n      charset:\
    \ The charset parameter is the same as the charset\n      parameter of application/xml\
    \ [RFC3023], including the same default\n      (see Section 3.2 of RFC 3023).\n\
    \      version: The version parameter indicates the version of the XACML\n   \
    \   specification.  It can be used for content negotiation when\n      dealing\
    \ with clients and servers that support multiple XACML\n      versions.  Its range\
    \ is the range of published XACML versions.  As\n      of this writing, that is\
    \ 1.0 [XACML-1], 1.1 [XACML-1.1], 2.0\n      [XACML-2], and 3.0 [XACML-3].  These\
    \ and future version\n      identifiers must follow the Organization for the Advancement\
    \ of\n      Structured Information Standards (OASIS) patterns for versions\n \
    \     [OASIS-Version].  If this parameter is not specified by the\n      client,\
    \ the server is free to return any version it deems fit.  If\n      a client cannot\
    \ or does not want to deal with that, it should\n      explicitly specify a version.\n\
    \   Encoding Considerations: Same as for application/xml [RFC3023].\n   Security\
    \ Considerations:\n      Per their specification, objects of type application/xacml+xml\
    \ do\n      not contain executable content.  However, these objects are XML-\n\
    \      based, and thus they have all of the general security\n      considerations\
    \ presented in Section 10 of RFC 3023 [RFC3023].\n      XACML [XACML-3] contains\
    \ information about whose integrity and\n      authenticity is important -- identity\
    \ provider and service\n      provider public keys and endpoint addresses, for\
    \ example.\n      Sections 9.2.1 \"Authentication\" and 9.2.4 \"Policy Integrity\"\
    \ in\n      XACML [XACML-3] describe requirements and considerations for such\n\
    \      authentication and integrity protection.\n      To counter potential issues,\
    \ the publisher may sign objects of\n      type application/xacml+xml.  Any such\
    \ signature should be verified\n      -- both as a valid signature and as being\
    \ the signature of the\n      publisher -- by the recipient of the data.  The\
    \ XACML v3.0 XML\n      Digital Signature Profile [XACML-3-DSig] describes how\
    \ to use XML-\n      based digital signatures with XACML.\n      Additionally,\
    \ various possible publication protocols, for example,\n      HTTPS, offer means\
    \ for ensuring the authenticity of the publishing\n      party and for protecting\
    \ the policy in transit.\n      Interoperability Considerations: Different versions\
    \ of XACML use\n      different XML namespace URIs:\n      *  1.0 and 1.1 use\
    \ the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy XML\n         namespace URI for policies\
    \ and the\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context XML namespace URI for\n\
    \         requests and responses\n      *  2.0 uses the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:policy\
    \ XML namespace\n         URI for policies and the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context\n\
    \         XML namespace URI for requests and responses\n      *  3.0 uses the\
    \ urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17 XML\n         namespace URI for\
    \ policies, requests, and responses\n      Signed XACML has a wrapping Security\
    \ Assertion Markup Language\n      (SAML) 2.0 assertion [SAML-2], which uses the\n\
    \      urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion namespace URI.\n      Interoperability\
    \ with SAML is defined by the SAML 2.0 Profile of\n      XACML [XACML-3-SAML]\
    \ for all versions of XACML.\n   Applications That Use This Media Type:\n    \
    \  Potentially, any application implementing or using XACML, as well\n      as\
    \ those applications implementing or using specifications based\n      on XACML.\
    \  In particular, applications using the Representational\n      State Transfer\
    \ (REST) Profile [XACML-REST] can benefit from this\n      media type.\n   Magic\
    \ Number(s):\n      In general, this is the same as for application/xml [RFC3023].\
    \  In\n      particular, the XML document element of the returned object will\n\
    \      be one of xacml:Policy, xacml:PolicySet, context:Request, or\n      context:Response.\
    \  The xacml and context namespace prefixes bind\n      to the respective namespace\
    \ URIs for the various versions of XACML\n      as follows:\n      *  1.0 and\
    \ 1.1: The xacml prefix maps to\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy;\
    \ the context prefix maps to\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context\n\
    \      *  2.0: The xacml prefix maps to\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:policy;\
    \ the context prefix maps to\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context\n\
    \      *  3.0: Both the xacml and context prefixes map to the namespace\n    \
    \     URI urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17\n      For signed XACML\
    \ [XACML-3-DSig], the XML document element is saml:\n      Assertion, where the\
    \ saml prefix maps to the SAML 2.0 namespace\n      URI urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\
    \ [SAML-2].\n   File Extension(s): none\n   Macintosh File Type Code(s): none\n\
