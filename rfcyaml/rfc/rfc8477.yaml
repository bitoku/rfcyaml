- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops\n\
    \   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the\n   Internet,\
    \ and to suggest future directions for the Internet\n   architecture.  The investigated\
    \ topics often require coordinated\n   efforts from many organizations and industry\
    \ bodies to improve an\n   identified problem.  One of the targets of the workshops\
    \ is to\n   establish communication between relevant organizations, especially\n\
    \   when the topics are out of the scope of the Internet Engineering Task\n  \
    \ Force (IETF).  This long-term planning function of the IAB is\n   complementary\
    \ to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working\n   groups of the IETF.\n\
    \   With the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), interoperability\n   becomes\
    \ more and more important.  Standards Developing Organizations\n   (SDOs) have\
    \ done a tremendous amount of work to standardize new\n   protocols and profile\
    \ existing protocols.\n   At the application layer and at the level of solution\
    \ frameworks,\n   interoperability is not yet mature.  Particularly, the work\
    \ on data\n   formats (in the form of data models and information models) has\
    \ not\n   seen the same level of consistency throughout SDOs.\n   One common problem\
    \ is the lack of an encoding-independent\n   standardization of the information,\
    \ the so-called information model.\n   Another problem is the strong relationship\
    \ between data formats and\n   the underlying communication architecture, such\
    \ as a design in Remote\n   Procedure Call (RPC) style or a RESTful design (where\
    \ REST refers to\n   Representational State Transfer).  Furthermore, groups develop\n\
    \   solutions that are very similar on the surface but differ slightly in\n  \
    \ their standardized outcome, leading to interoperability problems.\n   Finally,\
    \ some groups favor different encodings for use with various\n   application-layer\
    \ protocols.\n   Thus, the IAB decided to organize a workshop to reach out to\
    \ relevant\n   stakeholders to explore the state of the art and identify commonality\n\
    \   and gaps [IOTSIAG] [IOTSIWS].  In particular, the IAB was interested\n   to\
    \ learn about the following aspects:\n   o  What is the state of the art in data\
    \ and information models?  What\n      should an information model look like?\n\
    \   o  What is the role of formal languages, such as schema languages, in\n  \
    \    describing information and data models?\n   o  What is the role of metadata,\
    \ which is attached to data to make it\n      self-describing?\n   o  How can\
    \ we achieve interoperability when different organizations,\n      companies,\
    \ and individuals develop extensions?\n   o  What is the experience with interworking\
    \ various data models\n      developed from different groups, or with data models\
    \ that evolved\n      over time?\n   o  What functionality should online repositories\
    \ for sharing schemas\n      have?\n   o  How can existing data models be mapped\
    \ against each other to offer\n      interworking?\n   o  Is there room for harmonization,\
    \ or are the use cases of different\n      groups and organizations so unique\
    \ that there is no possibility\n      for cooperation?\n   o  How can organizations\
    \ better work together to increase awareness\n      and information sharing?\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The first roadblock to interoperability at the level of data\
    \ models\n   is the lack of a common vocabulary to start the discussion.\n   [RFC3444]\
    \ provides a starting point by separating conceptual models\n   for designers,\
    \ or \"information models\", from concrete detailed\n   definitions for implementers,\
    \ or \"data models\".  There are concepts\n   that are undefined in that RFC and\
    \ elsewhere, such as the interaction\n   with the resources of an endpoint, or\
    \ \"interaction model\".\n   Therefore, the three \"main\" common models that\
    \ were identified were:\n   Information Model\n      An information model defines\
    \ an environment at the highest level\n      of abstraction and expresses the\
    \ desired functionality.\n      Information models can be defined informally (e.g.,\
    \ in prose) or\n      more formally (e.g., Unified Modeling Language (UML), Entity-\n\
    \      Relationship Diagrams, etc.).  Implementation details are hidden.\n   Data\
    \ Model\n      A data model defines concrete data representations at a lower\n\
    \      level of abstraction, including implementation- and protocol-\n      specific\
    \ details.  Some examples are SNMP Management Information\n      Base (MIB) modules,\
    \ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Thing\n      Description (TD) Things, YANG modules,\
    \ Lightweight Machine-to-\n      Machine (LwM2M) Schemas, Open Connectivity Foundation\
    \ (OCF)\n      Schemas, and so on.\n   Interaction Model\n      An interaction\
    \ model defines how data is accessed and retrieved\n      from the endpoints,\
    \ being, therefore, tied to the specific\n      communication pattern that the\
    \ system has (e.g., REST methods,\n      Publish/Subscribe operations, or RPC\
    \ calls).\n   Another identified terminology issue is the semantic meaning overload\n\
    \   that some terms have.  The meaning can vary depending on the context\n   in\
    \ which the term is used.  Some examples of such terms are as\n   follows: semantics,\
    \ models, encoding, serialization format, media\n   types, and encoding types.\
    \  Due to time constraints, no concrete\n   terminology was agreed upon, but work\
    \ will continue within each\n   organization to create various terminology documents.\
    \  The\n   participants agreed to set up a GitHub repository [IOTSIGIT] for\n\
    \   sharing information.\n"
- title: 3.  What Problems to Solve
  contents:
  - "3.  What Problems to Solve\n   The participants agreed that there is not simply\
    \ a single problem to\n   be solved but rather a range of problems.  During the\
    \ workshop, the\n   following problems were discussed:\n   o  Formal Languages\
    \ for Documentation Purposes\n   To simplify review and publication, SDOs need\
    \ formal descriptions of\n   their data and interaction models.  Several of them\
    \ use a tabular\n   representation found in the specification itself but use a\
    \ formal\n   language as an alternative way of describing objects and resources\n\
    \   for formal purposes.  Some examples of formal language use are as\n   follows.\n\
    \   The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), now OMA SpecWorks, used an XML Schema\n  \
    \ [LWM2M-Schema] to describe their object and resource definitions.\n   The XML\
    \ files of standardized objects are available for download at\n   [OMNA].\n  \
    \ The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) defined Generic Attribute\n   Profile\
    \ (GATT) services and characteristics for use with Bluetooth\n   Smart/Low Energy.\
    \  The services and characteristics are shown in a\n   tabular form on the Bluetooth\
    \ SIG website [SIG] and are defined as\n   XML instance documents.\n   The Open\
    \ Connectivity Foundation (OCF) uses JSON Schemas to formally\n   define data\
    \ models and RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) to define\n   interaction models.\
    \  The standard files are available online at\n   <oneIoTa.org>.\n   The AllSeen\
    \ Alliance uses AllJoyn Introspection XML to define data\n   and interaction models\
    \ in the same formal language, tailored for\n   RPC-style interaction.  The standard\
    \ files are available online on\n   the AllSeen Alliance website, but both standard\
    \ and vendor-defined\n   model files can be obtained by directly querying a device\
    \ for them at\n   runtime.\n   The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) uses the Resource\
    \ Description\n   Framework (RDF) to define data and interaction models using\
    \ a format\n   tailored for the web.\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ uses YANG to define data\n   and interaction models.  Other SDOs may use various\
    \ other formats.\n   o  Formal Languages for Code Generation\n   Code-generation\
    \ tools that use formal data and information modeling\n   languages are needed\
    \ by developers.  For example, the AllSeen Visual\n   Studio Plugin [AllSeen-Plugin]\
    \ offers a wizard to generate code based\n   on the formal description of the\
    \ data model.  Another example of a\n   data modeling language that can be used\
    \ for code generation is YANG.\n   A popular tool to help with code generation\
    \ of YANG modules is pyang\n   [PYANG].  An example of a tool that can generate\
    \ code for multiple\n   ecosystems is OpenDOF [OpenDOF].  Use cases discussed\
    \ for code\n   generation included easing development of server-side device\n\
    \   functionality, clients, and compliance tests.\n   o  Debugging Support\n \
    \  Debugging tools are needed that implement generic object browsers,\n   which\
    \ use standard data models and/or retrieve formal language\n   descriptions from\
    \ the devices themselves.  As one example, the nRF\n   Bluetooth Smart sniffer\
    \ from Nordic Semiconductor [nRF-Sniffer] can\n   be used to display services\
    \ and characteristics defined by the\n   Bluetooth SIG.  As another example, AllJoyn\
    \ Explorer\n   [AllJoynExplorer] can be used to browse and interact with any\n\
    \   resource exposed by an AllJoyn device, including both standard and\n   vendor-defined\
    \ data models, by retrieving the formal descriptions\n   from the device at runtime.\n\
    \   o  Translation\n   The working assumption is that devices need to have a common\
    \ data\n   model with a priori knowledge of data types and actions.  However,\n\
    \   that would imply that each consortium/organization will try to define\n  \
    \ their own data model.  That would cause a major interoperability\n   problem,\
    \ possibly a completely intractable one given the number of\n   variations, extensions,\
    \ compositions, or versioning changes that will\n   happen for each data model.\n\
    \   Another potential approach is to have a minimal amount of information\n  \
    \ on the device to allow for a runtime binding to a specific model, the\n   objective\
    \ being to require as little prior knowledge as possible.\n   Moreover, gateways,\
    \ bridges and other similar devices need to\n   dynamically translate (or map)\
    \ one data model to another one.\n   Complexity will increase as there are also\
    \ multiple protocols and\n   schemas that make interoperability harder to achieve.\n\
    \   o  Runtime Discovery\n   Runtime discovery allows IoT devices to exchange\
    \ metadata about the\n   data, potentially along with the data exchanged itself.\
    \  In some\n   cases, the metadata not only describes data but also the interaction\n\
    \   model as well.  An example of such an approach has been shown with\n   Hypermedia\
    \ as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) [HATEOAS].\n   Another example\
    \ is that all AllJoyn devices support such runtime\n   discovery using a protocol\
    \ mechanism called \"introspection\", where\n   the metadata is queried from the\
    \ device itself [AllSeen].\n   There are various models, whether deployed or possible,\
    \ for such\n   discovery.  The metadata might be extracted from a specification,\n\
    \   looked up on a cloud repository (e.g., oneIoTa for OCF models),\n   looked\
    \ up via a vendor's site, or obtained from the device itself\n   (such as in the\
    \ AllJoyn case).  The relevant metadata might be\n   obtained from the same place\
    \ or different pieces might be obtained\n   from different places, such as separately\
    \ obtaining (a) syntax\n   information, (b) end-user descriptions in a desired\
    \ language, and (c)\n   developer-specific comments for implementers.\n"
- title: 4.  Translation
  contents:
  - "4.  Translation\n   In an ideal world where organizations and companies cooperate\
    \ and\n   agree on a single data model standard, there is no need for gateways\n\
    \   that translate from one data model to another one.  However, this is\n   far\
    \ from reality today, and there are many proprietary data models in\n   addition\
    \ to the already standardized ones.  As a consequence,\n   gateways are needed\
    \ to translate between data models.  This leads to\n   (n^2)-n combinations, in\
    \ the worst case.\n   There are analogies with gateways back in the 1980s that\
    \ were used to\n   translate between network layer protocols.  Eventually, IP\
    \ took over,\n   providing the necessary end-to-end interoperability at the network\n\
    \   layer.  Unfortunately, the introduction of gateways leads to the loss\n  \
    \ of expressiveness due to the translation between data models.  The\n   functionality\
    \ of IP was so valuable in the market that advanced\n   features of other networking\
    \ protocols became less attractive and\n   were not used anymore.\n   Participants\
    \ discussed an alternative that they called a \"red star\",\n   shown in Figure\
    \ 1, where data models are translated to a common data\n   model shown in the\
    \ middle.  This reduces the number of translations\n   that are needed down to\
    \ 2n (in the best case).  The problem, of\n   course, is that everyone wants their\
    \ own data model to be the red\n   star in the center.\n      +-----+        \

    \n            Figure 1: The \"Red Star\" in Data/Information Models\n   While\
    \ the workshop itself was not a suitable forum to discuss the\n   design of such\
    \ translation in detail, several questions were raised:\n   o  Do we need a \"\
    red star\" that does everything, or could we design\n      something that offers\
    \ a more restricted functionality?\n   o  How do we handle loss of data and functionality?\n\
    \   o  Should data be translated between data models, or should data\n      models\
    \ themselves be translated?\n   o  How can interaction models be translated? \
    \ They need to be dealt\n      with in addition to the data models.\n   o  Many\
    \ (if not all) data and interaction models have some bizarre\n      functionality\
    \ that cannot be translated easily.  How can those be\n      handled?\n   o  What\
    \ limitations are we going to accept in these translations?\n   The participants\
    \ also addressed the question of when translation\n   should be done.  Two use\
    \ cases were discussed:\n   (a)  Design time: A translation between data model\
    \ descriptions, such\n        as translating a YANG module to a RAML/JSON model,\
    \ can be\n        performed once, during design time.  A single information model\n\
    \        might be mapped to a number of different data models.\n   (b)  Run time:\
    \ Runtime translation of values in two standard data\n        models can only\
    \ be algorithmically done when the data model on\n        one side is algorithmically\
    \ derived from the data model on the\n        other side.  This was called a \"\
    derived model\".  It was\n        discussed that the availability of runtime discovery\
    \ can aid in\n        semantic translation, such as when a vendor-specific data\
    \ model\n        on one side of a protocol bridge is resolved and the translator\n\
    \        can algorithmically derive the semantically equivalent vendor-\n    \
    \    specific data model on the other side.  This situation is\n        discussed\
    \ in [BridgeTaxonomy].\n   The participants agreed that algorithm translation\
    \ will generally\n   require custom code whenever one is translating to anything\
    \ other\n   than a derived model.\n   Participants concluded that it is typically\
    \ easier to translate data\n   between systems that follow the same communication\
    \ architecture.\n"
- title: 5.  Dealing with Change
  contents:
  - "5.  Dealing with Change\n   A large part of the workshop was dedicated to the\
    \ evolution of\n   devices and server-side applications.  Interactions between\
    \ devices\n   and services and how their relationship evolves over time is\n \
    \  complicated by their respective interaction models.\n   The workshop participants\
    \ discussed various approaches to deal with\n   change.  In the most basic case,\
    \ a developer might use a description\n   of an API and implement the protocol\
    \ steps.  Sometimes, the data or\n   information model can be used to generate\
    \ code stubs.  Subsequent\n   changes to an API require changes on the clients\
    \ to upgrade to the\n   new version, which requires some development of new code\
    \ to satisfy\n   the needs of the new API.\n   These interactions could be made\
    \ machine understandable in the first\n   place, enabling for changes to happen\
    \ at runtime.  In that scenario,\n   a machine client could discover the possible\
    \ interactions with a\n   service, adapting to changes as they occur without specific\
    \ code\n   being developed to adapt to them.\n   The challenge seems to be to\
    \ code the human-readable specification\n   into a machine-readable format.  Machine-readable\
    \ languages require a\n   shared vocabulary to give meaning to the tags.\n   These\
    \ types of interactions are often based on the REST architectural\n   style. \
    \ Its principle is that a device or endpoint only needs a\n   single entry point,\
    \ with a host providing descriptions of the API\n   in-band by means of web links\
    \ and forms.\n   By defining IoT-specific relation types, it is possible to drive\n\
    \   interactions through links instead of hard-coding URIs into a RESTful\n  \
    \ client, thus making the system flexible enough for later changes.\n   The definition\
    \ of the basic hypermedia formats for IoT is still a\n   work in progress.  However,\
    \ some of the existing mechanisms can be\n   reused, such as resource discovery,\
    \ forms, or links.\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There were two types of security considerations\
    \ discussed: use of\n   formal data models for security configuration and security\
    \ of data\n   and data models in general.\n   It was observed that the security\
    \ assumptions and configuration, or\n   \"security model\", varies by ecosystem\
    \ today, making the job of a\n   translator difficult.  For example, there are\
    \ different types of\n   security principals (e.g., user vs. device vs. application),\
    \ the use\n   of Access Control Lists (ACLs) versus capabilities, and what types\
    \ of\n   policies can be expressed, all vary by ecosystem.  As a result, the\n\
    \   security model architecture generally dictates where translation can\n   be\
    \ done.\n   One approach discussed was whether two endpoints might be able to\
    \ use\n   some overlay security model across a translator between two\n   ecosystems,\
    \ which only works if the two endpoints agree on a common\n   data model for their\
    \ communication.  Another approach discussed was\n   simply having a translator\
    \ act as a trusted intermediary, which\n   enables the translator to translate\
    \ between different data models.\n   One suggestion discussed was either adding\
    \ metadata into the formal\n   data model language or having it accompany the\
    \ data values over the\n   wire, tagging the data with privacy levels.  However,\
    \ sometimes even\n   the privacy level of information might itself be sensitive.\
    \  Still,\n   it was observed that being able to dynamically learn security\n\
    \   requirements might help provide better UIs and translators.\n"
- title: 8.  Collaboration
  contents:
  - "8.  Collaboration\n   The participants discussed how best to share information\
    \ among their\n   various organizations.  One discussion was around having joint\n\
    \   meetings.  One current challenge reported was that organizations were\n  \
    \ not aware of when and where each other's meetings were scheduled, and\n   sharing\
    \ such information could help organizations better collocate\n   meetings.  To\
    \ facilitate this exchange, the participants agreed to\n   add links to their\
    \ respective meeting schedules from a common page in\n   the IOTSI repository\
    \ [IOTSIGIT].\n   Another challenge reported was that organizations did not know\
    \ how to\n   find each other's published data models, and sharing such information\n\
    \   could better facilitate reuse of the same information model.  To\n   facilitate\
    \ this exchange, the participants discussed whether a common\n   repository might\
    \ be used by multiple organizations.  The OCF's\n   oneIoTa repository was discussed\
    \ as one possibility, but it was\n   reported that its terms of use at the time\
    \ of the workshop prevented\n   this.  The OCF agreed to take this back and look\
    \ at updating the\n   terms of use to allow other organizations to use it, as\
    \ the\n   restriction was not the intent.  <schema.org> was discussed as\n   another\
    \ possibility.  In the meantime, the participants agreed to add\n   links to their\
    \ respective repositories from a common page in the\n   IOTSI repository [IOTSIGIT].\n\
    \   It was also agreed that the iotsi@iab.org mailing list would remain\n   open\
    \ and available for sharing information between all relevant\n   organizations.\n"
