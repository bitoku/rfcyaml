  - "Abstract\n   All BGP routers in the Default-Free Zone (DFZ) are required to carry\n\
    \   all routes in the Default-Free Routing Table (DFRT).  This document\n   describes\
    \ a technique, Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA), that allows\n   some BGP routers\
    \ not to install all of those routes into the\n   Forwarding Information Base\
    \ (FIB).\n   Some routers in an Autonomous System (AS) announce an aggregate (the\n\
    \   VA prefix) in addition to the routes they already announce.  This\n   enables\
    \ other routers not to install the routes covered by the VA\n   prefix into the\
    \ FIB as long as those routes have the same next-hop as\n   the VA prefix.\n \
    \  The VA prefixes that are announced within an AS are not announced to\n   any\
    \ other AS.  The described functionality is of very low operational\n   complexity,\
    \ as it proposes a confined BGP speaker solution without\n   any dependency on\
    \ network-wide configuration or requirement for any\n   form of intra-domain tunneling.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a technique called Simple Virtual\
    \ Aggregation\n   (S-VA).  It allows some routers not to store some routes in\
    \ the\n   Forwarding Information Base (FIB) while still advertising and\n   receiving\
    \ the full Default-Free Routing Table (DFRT) in BGP.\n   A typical scenario is\
    \ as follows.  Core routers in the ISP maintain\n   the full DFRT in the FIB and\
    \ Routing Information Base (RIB).  Edge\n   routers maintain the full DFRT in\
    \ the BGP Local RIB (Loc-RIB), but do\n   not install certain routes in the RIB\
    \ and FIB.  Edge routers may\n   install a default route to core routers, to Area\
    \ Border Routers (ABR)\n   that are installed on the Point of Presence (POP),\
    \ to core boundary\n   routers, or to Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs).\n\
    \   S-VA must be enabled on an edge router that needs to save its RIB and\n  \
    \ FIB space.  The core routers must announce a new prefix called\n   Virtual Aggregate\
    \ (VA prefix).\n"

- title: 2.  Operation of S-VA
  contents:
  - "2.  Operation of S-VA\n   There are three types of routers in S-VA: FIB-Installing\
    \ routers\n   (FIR), FIB-Suppressing routers (FSR), and, optionally, legacy\n\
    \   routers.  While any router can be an FIR or an FSR, the simplest form\n  \
    \ of deployment is for AS border routers to be configured as FIRs and\n   for\
    \ customer facing edge routers to be configured as FSRs.\n   When a FIR announces\
    \ a VA prefix, it sets the path attributes as\n   follows.  The ORIGIN MUST be\
    \ set to INCOMPLETE (value 2).  The\n   NEXT_HOP MUST be set to the same value\
    \ as that of the routes that are\n   intended to be covered by the VA prefix.\
    \  The ATOMIC_AGGREGATE and\n   AGGREGATOR attributes SHOULD NOT be included.\
    \  The FIR MUST attach a\n   NO_EXPORT community attribute [RFC1997].  The NLRI\
    \ SHOULD be 0/0.\n   A FIR SHOULD NOT FIB-suppress any routes.\n   An FSR must\
    \ detect the VA prefix or prefixes (including 0/0) and\n   install them in all\
    \ of Loc-RIB, RIB, and FIB.  The FSR MAY suppress\n   any more-specific routes\
    \ that carry the same next-hop as the VA\n   prefix.\n   Generally, any more-specific\
    \ route that carries the same next-hop as\n   the VA prefix is eligible for suppression.\
    \  However, provided that\n   there is at least one less-specific prefix with\
    \ a different next-hop\n   between the VA prefix and the suppressed prefixes,\
    \ then those\n   suppressed prefixes must be reinstalled.\n   An example with\
    \ three prefixes can be considered where the VA-prefix\n   (prefix 1) is the least\
    \ specific and covers prefix 2 and prefix 3.\n   Prefix 2 is less specific than\
    \ prefix 3 and covers the latter.  If\n   all three have the same next-hop, then\
    \ only the bigger one, i.e.,\n   VA-Prefix, is announced.  However, if prefix\
    \ 2 has a different\n   next-hop, then it will need to be announced separately.\
    \  In this\n   case, it is important to also announce prefix 3 separately.\n \
    \  Similarly, when Internal BGP (IBGP) multipath is enabled, and when\n   multiple\
    \ VA prefixes form a multipath, only those more-specific\n   prefixes of which\
    \ the set of next-hops are identical to the set of\n   next-hops of the VA prefix\
    \ multipath are subject to suppression.\n   The expected behavior is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1.  This figure shows\n   an AS with a FIR, FIR1, and an FSR, FSR1.\
    \  FSR1 is an ASBR and is\n   connected to two external ASBRs, EP1 and EP2.\n\

    \                            Figure 1\n   Suppose that FSR1 has been enabled to\
    \ perform S-VA.  Originally, it\n   receives all routes from FIR1 (doing next-hop-self)\
    \ as well as from\n   EP1 and EP2.  FIR1 now will advertise a VA prefix 0/0 with\
    \ the next-\n   hop set to itself.  This will cause FSR1 to suppress all routes\
    \ with\n   the same next-hop as the VA prefix.  However, FSR1 will not suppress\n\
    \   any routes received from EP1 and EP2, because their next-hops are\n   different\
    \ from that of the VA prefix.\n   Several FIRs may announce different S-VA prefixes.\
    \  For example, in a\n   POP, each edge router can announce into the POP an S-VA\
    \ prefix that\n   covers the addresses of the customers it services.\n   Several\
    \ FIRs may announce the same S-VA prefix.  In this case, an FSR\n   must choose\
    \ to install only one of them.  For example, two redundant\n   ASBRs, both of\
    \ which announce the complete DFRT, may each also\n   announce the default route\
    \ as an S-VA prefix into the AS.\n   S-VA may be used to split traffic among redundant\
    \ exit routers.  For\n   example, suppose in Figure 1 that EP1 and EP2 are two\
    \ redundant ASBRs\n   that announce the complete DFRT.  Each may also announce\
    \ two S-VA\n   prefixes into the AS: 0/1 and 128/1.  EP1 might announce 0/1 with\n\
    \   higher preference and EP2 might announce 128/1 with higher\n   preference.\
    \  FIR1 will now install into its FIB 0/1 pointing to EP1\n   and 128/1 pointing\
    \ to EP2.  If either EP1 or EP2 were to fail, then\n   FSR1 would switch the traffic\
    \ to the other exit router with a single\n   FIB installation of one S-VA prefix.\n"
- title: 3.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Deployment Considerations\n   BGP routes may be used to resolve next-hops\
    \ for static routes or\n   other BGP routes.  Because the default route does not\
    \ imply\n   reachability of any destination, a router can be configured to not\n\
    \   resolve next-hops using the default route.  In this case, S-VA should\n  \
    \ not suppress a route that may be used to resolve a next-hop for\n   another\
    \ route from installation into the RIB.  It may still suppress\n   it from installation\
    \ into the FIB.\n   Selected BGP routes in the RIB may be redistributed to other\n\
    \   protocols.  If they no longer exist in the RIB, they will not be\n   redistributed.\
    \  This is especially important when the conditional\n   redistribution is taking\
    \ place based on the length of the prefix,\n   community value, etc.  In those\
    \ cases where a redistribution policy\n   is in place, S-VA implementation should\
    \ refrain from suppressing\n   installation into the RIB routes matching such\
    \ policy.  It may still\n   suppress them from installation into the FIB.\n  \
    \ A router may originate a network route or an aggregate route into\n   BGP. \
    \ Some addresses covered by such a route may not exist.  If this\n   router were\
    \ to receive a packet for an unreachable address within an\n   originated route,\
    \ it must not send that packet to the VA prefix\n   route.  There are several\
    \ ways to achieve this.  One way is to have\n   the FIR aggregate the routes instead\
    \ of the FSR.  Another way is to\n   install a black hole route for the nonexistent\
    \ addresses on the\n   originating router.  This issue is not specific to S-VA,\
    \ but\n   applicable to the general use of default routes.\n   Like any aggregate,\
    \ an S-VA prefix may include more address space\n   than the sum of the prefixes\
    \ it covers.  As such, the S-VA prefix may\n   provide a route for a packet for\
    \ which no real destination exists.\n   An FSR will forward such a packet to the\
    \ FIR.\n   If an S-VA prefix changes its next-hop or is removed, then many\n \
    \  routes may need to be downloaded into the FIB to achieve convergence.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The authors are not aware of any new security\
    \ considerations due to\n   S-VA.  The local nature of the proposed optimization\
    \ eliminates any\n   external exposure of the functionality.  The presence of\
    \ more\n   specifics that are used as VA prefixes is also a normal BGP behavior\n\
    \   in current networks.\n"
