  - "Abstract\n   Early last year, as the concluding effort of an 18 month appointment\n\
    \   at the US Congress Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), I drafted a\n  \
    \ potential policy framework for Congressional action on the National\n   Research\
    \ and Education Network (NREN).\n   The Internet community needs to be asking\
    \ what the most important\n   policy issues facing the network are.  And given\
    \ agreement on any\n   particular set of policy issues, the next thing we should\
    \ be asking\n   is, what would be some of the political choices that would follow\
    \ for\n   Congress to make?\n   It is unfortunate that this was never officially\
    \ done for or by the\n   Congress by OTA.  What we have as a result is network\
    \ policy making\n   being carried out now by the Science Subcommittee on the House\
    \ side\n   in consultation with a relatively small group of interested parties.\n\
    \   The debate seems to be more focused on preserving turf than on any\n   sweeping\
    \ understanding of what the legislation is doing.  That is\n   unfortunate.\n\
    \   In the hope that it may contain some useful ideas, I offer a\n   shortened\
    \ version of the suggested policy draft as information for\n   the Internet community.\n"

  - "Environment\n   As currently structured, the NSFnet and american Internet provide\n\
    \   access to several million researchers and educators, hundreds of\n   thousands\
    \ of remote computers, hundreds of databases, and hundreds of\n   library catalogues.\
    \  Money being invested in the network as a result\n   of the High Performance\
    \ Computing and Communications (HPCC) initiative\n   should considerably increase\
    \ the numbers and variety behind this\n   unprecedented collection of resources.\
    \  No other computer network on\n   earth currently comes close to providing access\
    \ to the breadth and\n   depth of people and information.  If access to information\
    \ is access\n   to power, access to the national computer network will mean access\
    \ to\n   very significant power.\n   Furthermore, access to the american Internet\
    \ and NREN is also\n   access to the worldwide Internet.  According to the Director\
    \ for\n   International Programs at the NSF in February 1992, the development\n\
    \   of the Internet over the past twelve years has been one of\n   exponential\
    \ growth:\n               Date           Connected Hosts\n               August\
    \ 1981    213\n               October 1985   1,961\n               December 1987\
    \  28,174\n               January 1989   80,000\n               January 1991 \
    \  376,000\n               January 1992   727,000\n   These hosts are computers\
    \ to which anyone in the world with Internet\n   access can instantaneously connect\
    \ and use if there are publically\n   available files.  Any host may also be used\
    \ for remote computing if\n   the system administrator gives the user private\
    \ access.  These seven\n   hundred thousand plus hosts are located in more than\
    \ 38 nations.  But\n   they are only part of the picture.  By system-to-system\
    \ transfer of\n   electronic mail they are linked to probably a million additional\n\
    \   hosts.  According to Dr. Larry Landweber of the University of\n   Wisconsin,\
    \ as of February 10, 1992, Internet electronic mail was\n   available in 106 nations\
    \ and territories.\n   Unfortunately, our current regulatory system does not distinguish\n\
    \   between the unique nature of the Internet and commercial systems like\n  \
    \ Prodigy and Compuserve where perhaps a million people pay monthly\n   fees for\
    \ access to systems offering a few dozen databases run from\n   two or three hosts\
    \ and electronic mail to several hundred thousand\n   people instead of many millions.\
    \  (The picture is made somewhat fuzzy\n   by the fact that Compuserve does provide\
    \ electronic mail access to\n   the Internet through a gateway and for an extra\
    \ charge.)  The Federal\n   Communications Commission (FCC) considers all three\
    \ to be Value Added\n   Networks (VANs) run by Enhanced Service Providers.  All\
    \ use common\n   carriers to provide their enhanced services and the FCC, in refusing\n\
    \   to regulate them, reasons that all services are roughly alike.  If,\n   for\
    \ example, Compuserve charges too much, the consumer can quit\n   Compuserve and\
    \ move to Prodigy.  Or, if the monthly cost of access to\n   the Internet were\
    \ to become too much, access to Prodigy or Compuserve\n   would be basically the\
    \ same thing.  Here unfortunately the analogy\n   fails: the Internet now and\
    \ the NREN to be, with its unparalleled\n   resources, is not the same.  Nevertheless,\
    \ the FCC points out that\n   without Congressional action it is powerless to\
    \ regulate NREN service\n   providers.\n"

  - "Regulation is a key NREN policy issue.\n   Perhaps there will be no need for\
    \ regulation.  Hopefully, the\n   marketplace for the provision of network services\
    \ will remain\n   competitive and higher prices and cream skimming will not keep\
    \ the\n   national network out of the reach of the general public who wish to\n\
    \   avail themselves of what it has to offer.  However, given the scope\n   and\
    \ power of what is contemplated here, Congress should realize that\n   there are\
    \ important considerations of social and economic equity\n   behind the question\
    \ of access to the network.  This is especially\n   true since libraries and groups\
    \ representing primary and secondary\n   schools are demanding what could be considered\
    \ as universal access to\n   the network without having any knowledge of how such\
    \ access might be\n   funded.\n   The economic stakes are huge.  Other players\
    \ such as US West's\n   Advanced Communications division are entering the market\
    \ and AT&T is\n   expected to do so by the spring.  When combined with the award\
    \ of the\n   EINet backbone to Uunet, their entry should help to level the playing\n\
    \   field.  While one company is less likely to dominate such an\n   uncontrolled,\
    \ unregulated market, those concerned about widespread\n   affordable access to\
    \ the network would do well to watch unfolding\n   events with care.\n"
- title: Technology Transfer Goals Achieved?
  contents:
  - "Technology Transfer Goals Achieved?\n   Policy makers may ask how much priority\
    \ the Federal government should\n   continue to give technology transfer in a\
    \ market where the technology\n   that allegedly still needs aiding is showing\
    \ remarkable signs of\n   maturity?  As they debate the course on which they wish\
    \ to take the\n   network over the next five years, policy makers may find that\
    \ one\n   answer to the apparent disparity between the emphasis in the\n   legislation\
    \ on the provision of the network by the government, and\n   the growing number\
    \ of commercial sources of network availability is\n   that the market matured\
    \ very rapidly while the HPCC legislation\n   remained unchanged.\n   In view\
    \ of all the remarkable commercial achievements (outlined in\n   this essay) in\
    \ the four years since the NREN idea arose, perhaps the\n   policy objective of\
    \ technology transfer for economic competitiveness\n   could be considered to\
    \ be achieved!  A commercially viable high speed\n   data networking industry,\
    \ with the entrance of Sprint in January 1992\n   and the anticipated entrance\
    \ of AT&T, has reached maturity.\n   Therefore, having successfully achieved its\
    \ technology transfer\n   goals, the Congress must decide whether to continue\
    \ to underwrite the\n   network as a tool in support of science and education\
    \ goals.  It\n   seems reasonable to assume that this support could be undertaken\
    \ in a\n   way that would not seriously undermine the commercial TCP/IP data\n\
    \   networking market place.\n"
- title: The Context for Policy Setting
  contents:
  - "The Context for Policy Setting\n   In order to make informed choices of goals\
    \ for the network, Congress\n   must understand the context of a rapidly commercializing\
    \ network.\n   The resulting context is likely to produce serious impacts both\
    \ on\n   the user community and the development of future network technology.\n\
    \   It is likely to make some goals more easily attainable than others.\n   Given\
    \ its maturity, the commercialization of TCP/IP wide area\n   networking technology\
    \ is inevitable.\n   Some have already begun to question whether the government\
    \ should be\n   providing backbone services where commercial alternatives are\n\
    \   currently available and are expected to grow in number.\n   Supporters of\
    \ the NREN vision argue that the NSF is using government\n   funds to build a\
    \ leading edge network faster than the commercial\n   alternatives.  They say\
    \ that use of public funds on such technology\n   development is appropriate.\
    \  Their critics state that the T-3\n   technology (also called DS-3) is dead\
    \ end and point out that the next\n   logical step is refining the network so\
    \ that it can use ATM and\n   SONET.  For aggregate gigabit speeds along the backbone,\
    \ use of ATM\n   and SONET will be necessary.  Critics claim that the T-1 backbone\n\
    \   could be engineered to accommodate the network for a while longer\n   while\
    \ Federal funds would be more appropriately invested now in an\n   ATM and SONET\
    \ development effort.  They say that Federal policy is\n   being used to enable\
    \ IBM to have a testbed for the development of\n   DS-3 TCP/IP routers when Network\
    \ Technologies makes a comparable\n   product that is already proven and reliable.\
    \  Whether the Federal\n   Government should be providing backbone services or\
    \ merely support\n   for access and improved network features is a key policy\
    \ issue.\n   Finding the best answer to the questions raised by this issue is\n\
    \   likely to center on the ability of the Federal mission agencies\n   involved\
    \ in high speed network development to articulate a long term\n   plan for the\
    \ development of new network technology over the next\n   decade.  How we shall\
    \ use what is learned in the gigabit testbeds has\n   not yet been clearly addressed\
    \ by policy makers.  Continuation of the\n   testbeds is currently uncertain.\
    \ There is also no plan to apply the\n   outcome to the production NREN.  These\
    \ are areas deserving of federal\n   involvement.  The current players seem to\
    \ be incapable of addressing\n   them.  Some possible courses of Federal action\
    \ will be identified in\n   the discussion of a Corporation for Public Networking\
    \ to follow.\n   In the meantime, we face a period of four to five years where\
    \ the NSF\n   is scheduled to take the NSFnet backbone through one more bid. \
    \ While\n   Federal support for the current production backbone may be\n   questionable\
    \ on technology grounds, policy makers, before setting\n   different alternatives:\n\
    \          -    must understand very clearly the dual policy drivers\n       \
    \        behind the NREN,\n          -    must define very clearly the objectives\
    \ of the network,\n               and\n          -    must carefully define a\
    \ both a plan and perhaps a\n               governing mechanism for their achievement.\n\
    \   A sudden withdrawal of Federal support for the backbone would be\n   likely\
    \ to make a chaotic situation more so.  However, the application\n   of focused\
    \ planning could define potentially productive alternatives\n   to current policies\
    \ that could be applied by the time of the backbone\n   award announcement in\
    \ April of 1993.\n"
- title: Whom Shall the Network Serve?
  contents:
  - "Whom Shall the Network Serve?\n   The HPCC legislation gives the FCCSET a year\
    \ to prepare a report to\n   the Congress on goals for the network's eventual\
    \ privatization.\n   Thanks to the NSF's decision to rebid the backbone, this\
    \ task may no\n   longer be rendered moot by premature network privatization.\
    \  The\n   FCCSET Report needs to address many questions.\n   One question is\
    \ the extent to which, in the higher education\n   environment, Congress through\
    \ the National Science Foundation, or\n   perhaps through another entity of its\
    \ own choosing will continue to\n   underwrite networking.  A related question\
    \ is whether or when\n   Congress should act in order to preserve a competitive\
    \ networking\n   provider environment.  A question subsidiary to this is whether\
    \ a\n   competitive commercial environment is adequate to ensure a fertile\n \
    \  data networking technical R&D environment?  Another related question\n   centers\
    \ on what is necessary to preserve network access that is as\n   widely available\
    \ to post-secondary education as possible?  Further\n   issues center on what\
    \ type of access to promote.  Should Congress\n   support the addition to the\
    \ network of many of the expensive\n   capabilities promoted by the advocates\
    \ of the NREN vision?   What if\n   funds spent here mean that other constituencies\
    \ such as K-12 do not\n   get adequate support?\n"

  - "Access to the NREN is a key policy issue.\n   If network use is as important\
    \ for improving research and education\n   as its supporters allege it to be,\
    \ Congress may wish to address the\n   issue of why, at institutions presently\
    \ connected to the network,\n   only a small minority of students and faculty\
    \ are active users.  If\n   it examines the network reality carefully, Congress\
    \ may sense that it\n   is time to leverage investment in the network by improving\
    \ the\n   network's visibility and usability within the communities it is\n  \
    \ supposed to serve through improved documentation and training rather\n   than\
    \ by blindly underwriting massive increases in speed.\n"
- title: How Far To Extend Network Access?
  contents:
  - "How Far To Extend Network Access?\n   With the broadening discussion of the NREN\
    \ vision, expectations of\n   many segments of the population not originally intended\
    \ to be served\n   by the network have been raised.  An avid group of educators\
    \ wishing\n   to use the network in K-12 education has arisen.  If\n   commercialization\
    \ brought significant price increases, it could\n   endanger the very access these\
    \ educators now have to the network.\n   Native Americans have begun to ask for\
    \ access to the network.  How\n   will Congress respond to them?  And to the general\
    \ library community\n   which with the Coalition for Networked Information has\
    \ been avidly\n   pressing its desires for NREN funds?  And to state and local\n\
    \   government networks?\n   Congress should recognize that choices about network\
    \ access for these\n   broader constituencies will be made at two levels.  Access\
    \ for large\n   numbers could be purchased by the government from commercial\n\
    \   providers at considerable expense - an unlikely development in view\n   of\
    \ the Federal budget deficit.  In the meantime, given the current\n   mix of government\
    \ supported and commercial providers, the environment\n   for these user classes\
    \ is quite competitive.  Those who are able to\n   pay their own way can generally\
    \ gain access to the network from a\n   choice of providers at reasonable cost.\
    \  Congress can act on behalf\n   of these constituencies by ensuring that the\
    \ market for the\n   provisioning of network services remains open and competitive.\
    \  Short\n   of either regulating the industry or establishing a new government\n\
    \   operated network, careful use of subsidies will have the most impact\n   on\
    \ ensuring an open and competitive network.  Congress can also\n   choose to view\
    \ access as a function of price.  If Congress does opt\n   for this course, it\
    \ has several choices to ensure that prices will be\n   affordable.  It could\
    \ seek to impose regulations on the network\n   providers through the FCC at a\
    \ national level or urge the state PUCs\n   to do it at the local level.  (Of\
    \ course the viability of state PUC\n   regulation, becomes questionable by the\
    \ near certainty that there\n   would be little uniformity in how the PUCs in\
    \ each state would treat\n   a national service.)  Congress also could impose\
    \ a tariff on network\n   providers profits and use the tariff to subsidize universal\
    \ access.\n   It should, of course, understand that these courses of action would\n\
    \   raise touchy questions of conflicts between Federal and state\n   jurisdiction.\n\
    \   Congress may also have been vague in dealing with these broader\n   network\
    \ constituencies, because it wishes to sidestep making these\n   difficult choices.\
    \  The origin of most of these choices may be traced\n   to the addition of education\
    \ policy goals for the Network symbolized\n   by the changing of its name from\
    \ the National Research Network to the\n   National Research and Education Network\
    \ in the OSTP Program Plan in\n   September 1989. While this action got the attention\
    \ and support of\n   new constituencies for the Network, it did not bring any\
    \ significant\n   shift to the science and mission agency oriented direction of\
    \ network\n   development.  The legislation remained essentially unchanged:\n\
    \   \"educators and educational institutions\" were as specific as the\n   language\
    \ of the bills ever got.  Perhaps this was almost on purpose?\n   Having goals\
    \ that were more specific might imply the need to justify\n   with some precision\
    \ why some individual segments of the networking\n   community deserved service\
    \ while some did not.\n   Unless Congress were able to construct a separate rationale\
    \ for the\n   needs of each of the network constituencies - from supercomputer\n\
    \   users to grade school students - specific goal setting by Congress\n   might\
    \ imply that Congress was arbitrarily judging some network\n   constituencies\
    \ to be more worthy than others.  This would be a\n   difficult course to follow\
    \ because those who were left out would want\n   to know what the basis for such\
    \ a judgment would be?  Solid answers\n   would be difficult to come by because\
    \ networking as enabling\n   educational technology is so new that no one is as\
    \ yet quite sure how\n   to measure its value.  Without such assurances, it may\
    \ be difficult\n   for Congress to know how to justify its spread on any other\
    \ grounds\n   than equity of opportunity.\n   Indeed there is a constituency of\
    \ grass roots-oriented, small-scale\n   network builders allied with elements\
    \ of the library community.  This\n   constituency suggests that computer networks\
    \ will very quickly become\n   such powerful means of access to information that\
    \ lack of access to\n   them will soon will carry serious implications for social\
    \ and\n   economic equity within the nation.\n   These groups can be expected\
    \ to be very vocal in their demands that\n   some minimal level of access to the\
    \ national network be widely\n   available and affordable.  They are likely to\
    \ ask that Congress turn\n   its attention to the feasibility of establishing\
    \ the goal of\n   universal access to the national network.  Although the technology\n\
    \   and economic conditions are quite different from the conditions of\n   the\
    \ 1934 Communications Act, they are likely to demand action\n   analogous to that.\n\
    \   Motivated by these concerns, Mitch Kapor has been arguing very\n   eloquently\
    \ for the building of the NREN as a National Public Network.\n   Asked to define\
    \ what he saw as being at stake, he said the following\n   to the author in September\
    \ 1991:\n      \"Information networking is the ability to communicate by means\
    \ of\n      digitally-encoded information, whether text, voice, graphics, or\n\
    \      video.  Increasingly, it will become the major means for\n      participation\
    \ in education, commerce, entertainment, and other\n      important social functions.\
    \  It is therefore important that all\n      citizens, not just the affluent,\
    \ have the opportunity to\n      participate in this new medium.  To exclude some\
    \ is to cut them\n      off from the very means by which they can advance themselves\
    \ to\n      join the political social and economic mainstream and so consign\n\
    \      them to second-class status forever.  This argument is analogous\n    \
    \  to that which was made in favor of universal voice telephone\n      service\
    \ - full social participation in American life would require\n      access to\
    \ a telephone in the home.\"\n   Kapor through his Electronic Frontier Foundation,\
    \ (EFF) is working\n   hard to make sure that Congress is compelled to address\
    \ the question\n   of universal network access.  The EFF has also begun to press\
    \ for the\n   use of ISDN as a technologically affordable means of bringing the\n\
    \   benefits of a national network to all Americans.\n   If Congress wishes to\
    \ promote widespread access to the network and to\n   design an network that is\
    \ amenable to widespread use, it will do well\n   to examine carefully the position\
    \ that the EFF is articulating.  It\n   would also do well to look outside the\
    \ confines of the Federal\n   Networking Council (FNC) and the FNC Advisory Commission\
    \ that is made\n   up of members similar in orientation to the FNC and is scheduled\
    \ for\n   only four meetings and a two-year-long existence.  If it wishes to\n\
    \   increase secondary and elementary school access to the network, it\n   could\
    \ investigate enlarging the very small role granted by the\n   legislation to\
    \ the Department of Education.  Unfortunately, without\n   careful planning what\
    \ would be gained by this is unclear.  The\n   Department of Education has never\
    \ played a significant role in\n   computer networking.  The immediate needs of\
    \ the K-12 arena are\n   focused mainly around maintaining the existence of affordable\
    \ low\n   bandwidth access and the support of successful pioneering efforts.\n\
    \   When Congress states its intentions for the scope of access to the\n   network\
    \ and, as a part of doing so, sets priorities for investment in\n   network bandwidth\
    \ versus ease of use, it can then turn its attention\n   only to one other area.\n"

    \ of a national\n   public data network infrastructure a matter of national priority.\
    \ It\n   could make it clear the government will, as it does in issues of\n  \
    \ national transportation systems, the national financial system, and\n   national\
    \ communications systems, maintain an interest in the\n   development and control\
    \ of a system that serves both the goals of\n   improved education and new technology\
    \ development.\n   To carry out such a mandate, a Corporation for Public Networking\n\
    \   (CPN) could have fifteen governors nominated by the members of the\n   network\
    \ community and subject to the approval of the Congress.\n   Each governor would\
    \ represent a network constituency.\n               1. The NSF\n             \
    \  2. Department of Energy\n               3. National Aeronautics & Space Administration\n\
    \               4. Advanced Research Projects Agency\n               5. Corporate\
    \ Users\n               6. K-12\n               7. Higher Education\n        \
    \       8. Public Libraries & State and Local Networks\n               9. Commercial\
    \ Network Information Service Providers\n              10. Interexchange Carriers\
    \ such as AT&T, MCI, Sprint, etc.\n              11. The Regional Bell Operating\
    \ Companies\n              12. Personal Computer Users\n              13. Computer\
    \ Manufacturers\n              14. Disabled Users\n              15. University\
    \ Computing\n   Since the legislation calls for backbone nodes in all 50 states,\
    \ such\n   a structure would be a reasonable way to coordinate Federal support\n\
    \   for the network on a truly national basis - one that, by\n   acknowledging\
    \ the network as a national resource, would give\n   representation to the full\
    \ breadth of its constituencies.  Governors\n   could use the network to sample\
    \ and help to articulate the national\n   concerns of their respective constituencies.\n\
    \   If it adopted these goals, Congress could give a CPN a range of\n   powers:\n\
    \         1.   The CPN could be a forum for the expression of the\n          \
    \    interests of all NREN constituencies.  In the event the\n              network\
    \ were to be administered by the NSF, it could be\n              serve as a much\
    \ more accurate sounding board of network\n              user concerns than the\
    \ FNC or the FNC Advisory Council.\n         2.   The CPN could be authorized\
    \ to make recommendations to NSF\n              and other agencies about how funds\
    \ should be distributed.\n              Such recommendations could include truly\
    \ independent\n              assessments of the technical needs of the network\n\
    \              community and the most cost effective ways of achieving\n     \
    \         them.\n         3.   The CPN could itself be given responsibility for\
    \ funding\n              distribution.  Such responsibilities would incur an\n\
    \              increase in administrative costs and staff.  Nevertheless,\n  \
    \            by creating an opportunity to start a process from scratch\n    \
    \          and one that would consequently be free of the vested\n           \
    \   interests of the National Science Foundation in high-end\n              network\
    \ solutions, Congress would likely get a clearer\n              picture of where\
    \ and how effectively public monies were\n              being expended. With such\
    \ responsibility the CPN could\n              also keep extensive pressure on\
    \ network providers to\n              remain interconnected.  When thinking about\
    \ cost, Congress\n              should also remember that effective oversight\
    \ of subsidies\n              funneled through NSF would imply the hiring of extra\
    \ staff\n              within that agency as well.\n         4.   Congress might\
    \ want to ask a CPN to examine the use of the\n              $200 million in NREN\
    \ R&D monies. Policy direction\n              dictating the spending of Federal\
    \ funds is still suffering\n              from the fuzzy boundaries between the\
    \ network as a tool\n              for leveraging technology competitiveness into\
    \ commercial\n              networking environments and the network as a tool\
    \ to\n              facilitate science and education.  If Congress decides\n \
    \             that the major policy direction of the network should be\n     \
    \         to develop the network for use as a tool in support of\n           \
    \   science and education, then it may want monies directed\n              toward\
    \ ARPA to be focused on improved databases, user\n              interfaces and\
    \ user tools like knowbots rather than a\n              faster network used by\
    \ fewer and fewer people.  A CPN that\n              was representative of the\
    \ breadth of the network's user\n              constituencies could provide better\
    \ guidance than the\n              FCCSET or ARPA for spending Federal subsidies\
    \ aimed at\n              adding new capabilities to the network.\n         5.\
    \   Additional levels of involvement could have the CPN act as\n             \
    \ a national quasi-board of networking public utilities.  It\n              could\
    \ be given an opportunity to promote low cost access\n              plans developed\
    \ by commercial providers.  If it borrowed\n              some of the fund raising\
    \ structure of National Public\n              Radio, it should be able to raise\
    \ very significant funds\n              from grass roots users at the individual\
    \ and small\n              business level who are made to feel that they have\
    \ a stake\n              in its operation.\n         6.   If congress wanted to\
    \ increase further the role given the\n              CPN, it could decide that\
    \ with network commercialization\n              and technology transfer goals\
    \ completed, the majority of\n              the NREN funds go to the CPN which\
    \ could then put out a\n              bid for a CPN backbone.  In effect Congress\
    \ could dictate\n              that the backbone announced by the NSF for implementation\n\
    \              in 1993 be implemented and run as a joint project between\n   \
    \           the NSF and a CPN.\n              All entities should be considered\
    \ eligible to join and use\n              the CPN in support of research and education.\
    \  Commercial\n              companies who wanted to use the CPN to interact with\
    \ the\n              academic community should pay a commercial rate to do so.\n\
    \              With the availability of a parallel commercial network,\n     \
    \         commercial restrictions on the CPN could be very much\n            \
    \  loosened to include anything in support of research and\n              education.\
    \  The CPN would study and report to Congress on\n              how gateways between\
    \ commercial TCP/IP networks and the\n              CPN network could be maintained.\n\
    \         7.   Some suggest that the Congress go even further. These\n       \
    \       people emphasize that a replacement for the R&D aspects of\n         \
    \     the Internet in the context of commercialization and\n              privatization\
    \ is uncertain.  Bell Labs and Bellcore remain\n              as the research\
    \ arms of the Public Switched Telephone\n              Network.  However neither\
    \ of them have ever developed\n              major strengths in wide area data\
    \ networking. Nor do they\n              appear to be likely to do so in the near\
    \ future.  Despite\n              this situation, the major private investment\
    \ made in the\n              Gigabit Testbeds indicate that the american\n   \
    \           telecommunications industry feels a need to invest in\n          \
    \    continued research.  This is something that the current\n              commercial\
    \ players are too small to do.  Furthermore, it\n              is something that\
    \ the larger players driven by pressure to\n              report quarterly profits\
    \ may find difficult to do.\n              Congress could make a decision that\
    \ Federal investment in\n              the technology should emphasize less pump-priming\
    \ to\n              increase the pace of what most see as inevitable\n       \
    \       commercialization and more the continued building of new\n           \
    \   networking technology for both technology transfer and\n              support\
    \ of the technology as an enabling tool.  In this\n              case Congress\
    \ could direct the CPN to plan, deploy and\n              manage a state of the\
    \ art public information\n              infrastructure. With goals for constituencies\
    \ and levels\n              of service defined, the CPN could produce for Congress\n\
    \              multiple scenarios for developing and maintaining two\n       \
    \       networks.\n              The first would be an experimental network where\
    \ the very\n              newest technologies could be explored.  It could be\
    \ very\n              similar to the current gigabit testbeds but this time with\n\
    \              all five projects linked together.  The second would be a\n   \
    \           state-of-the-art operational network that can provide wide\n     \
    \         spread field trials of technology developed on the\n              experimental\
    \ network. With the maturation of the\n              technology on the operational\
    \ network it would be\n              available for open transfer to commercial\
    \ service.  It\n              should be remembered that such a continuous widespread\n\
    \              network R&D environment would provide wide spread training\n  \
    \            experience for graduate students that would otherwise be\n      \
    \        unavailable.\n              Initial seed money would come from public\
    \ funds. However,\n              the bulk of support could come from a percentage\
    \ of\n              profits (as cash or in kind contributions) that\n        \
    \      participating companies would be required to contribute to\n          \
    \    the CPN as the price of admission for developing and\n              benefiting\
    \ from new technology.  Care should be taken in\n              structuring contributions\
    \ in a way that small start-up\n              firms would not be locked out. \
    \ To ensure this, Congress\n              could mandate that the CPN commissioners\
    \ (perhaps with\n              appropriate oversight from the National Academy\
    \ of\n              Sciences, the IEEE, or the ACM) develop a plan to ensure\n\
    \              that the cost of entry to such a testbed not exceed the\n     \
    \         capitalization of the current small commercial players.\n          \
    \    It could also require the development of proposals to\n              handle\
    \ the issues of interconnection billing, billing for\n              actual use\
    \ versus size of connection, and interoperability\n              among network\
    \ providers.\n              A different financing model could be explored if the\
    \ CPN\n              were instructed to report on the feasibility of selling\n\
    \              shares to commercial carriers in a national networking\n      \
    \        testbed and R&E network where carriers could, over a long\n         \
    \     term basis, develop and mature new networking technologies\n           \
    \   before transferring them to the commercial marketplace.\n        8.    In\
    \ its November 1, 1991 recommendations to the National\n              Science\
    \ Foundation, FARNET suggested that the NSF should\n              consider the\
    \ issuance of several separate solicitations\n              for the development\
    \ of software tools for end-user\n              applications and network management\
    \ and operations.  To\n              emphasize its point it added:  \"we believe\
    \ that the lack\n              of useful tools for information retrieval and display\
    \ is\n              one of the biggest impediments to the productive use of\n\
    \              the network and has impaired the credibility of the NREN\n    \
    \          in the eyes of the target user populations.\"  FARNET\n           \
    \   admonished the NSF to emphasize open architectures and\n              standards\
    \ in its solicitations, adding that \"where\n              standards are not adequately\
    \ understood or developed, the\n              NSF should support programs to test,\
    \ evaluate and improve\n              them.\"\n              FARNET concluded\
    \ by recommending\n                   \"that the NSF, working with the user community\
    \ and\n                   the providers, define and implement clear criteria\n\
    \                   for the award of additional funding to mid-level and\n   \
    \                campus networks . . . The new criteria should be\n          \
    \         designed to further . . . goals such as the extension\n            \
    \       of network services to new or underserved communities\n              \
    \     (for ubiquity); the improvement of network\n                   operations,\
    \ procedures and tools (for reliability);\n                   the enhancement\
    \ of existing services through\n                   development activities, upgrading\
    \ of existing\n                   connections to 'have not' institutions; leveraging\
    \ of\n                   state, local, and private funds (to maximize the\n  \
    \                 impact of Federal investment), and training and\n          \
    \         support for end-users (in cooperation with national\n              \
    \     and local programs).\"\n              If a CPN is created, it should be\
    \ directly involved with\n              working toward these important goals.\
    \  If implementation\n              of the network is left to the National Science\
    \ Foundation,\n              Congress should emphasize the importance of the NSF's\n\
    \              meeting these goals.\n         9.   Finally, a strong and broad-based\
    \ CPN might be able to\n              make recommendations to Congress on the\
    \ identification and\n              resolution of problems of telecommunications\
    \ policy\n              engendered by the continued growth of this network\n \
    \             technology.  It could perhaps play an educational role in\n    \
    \          advising state Public Utilities Commissions on the long\n         \
    \     term implications of their decisions.\n"
- title: Summary
  contents:
  - "Summary\n   Policy makers must soon decide whether the National Research and\n\
    \   Education Network is a public or a private good.  Although\n   privatization\
    \ appears to be proceeding apace, since the network\n   backbone will be rebid,\
    \ there should be time for some careful\n   planning for the development and evolution\
    \ of what can, within 10 to\n   20 years, become an extraordinarily powerful system\
    \ that is as\n   ubiquitous as the current telephone network and provides all\n\
    \   Americans with access to information in much the same way as public\n   libraries\
    \ were created for a similar purpose a century ago.\n   Congress must understand\
    \ that the NREN is not just a new technology\n   (indeed much is of it is old\
    \ technology), but has the potential to\n   become the most powerful means of\
    \ access to information ever created.\n   Within this context it must decide whom\
    \ the NREN shall serve.  It\n   must decide whom shall have access to the NREN.\n\
    \   Once it has done this further options fall into four major areas:\n      \
    \        First:    Congress must decide degree of oversight\n                \
    \        that is necessary to extend to the network. Such\n                  \
    \      oversight could range from legislating that the\n                     \
    \   FCC regulate the network, to strict reviews of\n                        the\
    \ NSF's actions, to vesting oversight powers\n                        in a Corporation\
    \ for Public Networking.\n              Second:   It must decide whether the appropriate\
    \ place to\n                        subsidize technology transfer is within a\n\
    \                        privatized operational NREN or within the\n         \
    \               experimental gigabit testbeds.  Without a better\n           \
    \             understanding both of how the technologies are\n               \
    \         evolving in the commercial market place, and the\n                 \
    \       evolution of both the testbeds and the NREN, it\n                    \
    \    will be difficult to make make a wise decision.\n                       \
    \ In addition, we must expect that the nature of\n                        its\
    \ choice will be further influenced by its\n                        decision on\
    \ whom the network is to serve.\n              Third:    It must decide whether\
    \ to subsidize a backbone\n                        for an NREN.  If it does subsidize\
    \ such a\n                        backbone, it must decide whether it shall be\n\
    \                        built as a private network or as a part of the\n    \
    \                    PSTN.\n              Fourth:   It must decide whether to\
    \ subsidize additional\n                        connectivity or broader use within\
    \ connected\n                        institutions or both.  In other words, should\n\
    \                        more institutions be connected to the network,\n    \
    \                    or should the network be made easier to use by\n        \
    \                the members of those institutions already\n                 \
    \       connected?\n   To the extent that Congress chooses to pursue options three\
    \ and four,\n   it will want to explore the scenario for the Corporation for Public\n\
    \   Networking discussed above.\n   Access to information is access to power.\
    \  The creation of a National\n   Research and Education Network based on the\
    \ NSFnet and the remainder\n   of the american Internet will mean the creation\
    \ of a national\n   information access system of unprecedented power.  In its\
    \ ability to\n   affect the lives and well being of Americans, the NREN, if properly\n\
    \   designed, will be just as significant as the national Interstate\n   highway\
    \ system and the national electric power grid.  The national\n   highway, or the\
    \ national power grid, or the national telephone system\n   could serve as models\
    \ for implementation.  The Federal Government\n   provides a public but otherwise\
    \ unregulated Interstate highway system\n   with universal access available to\
    \ all Americans.  Private industry\n   provides our electric power.  However,\
    \ it was allowed to do so only\n   in return for submitting to Federal and state\
    \ regulation designed to\n   ensure affordable national access by all citizens.\
    \ The national\n   telephone system has been established under a similar \"social\n\
    \   contract\".  If the nation is not to be dangerously split into\n   information\
    \ rich and information poor classes, policy makers have\n   about five years in\
    \ which to choose a Federally provided National\n   network, or a privately provided\
    \ but nationally regulated network.\n   During the development and maturation\
    \ of the national network, policy\n   makers should also be very attentive to\
    \ its impact on the public\n   switched telephone network (PSTN). The technology\
    \ involved and the\n   speed with which it is changing will only increase the\
    \ potentially\n   serious impact from the freedom of unregulated components of\
    \ the\n   telecommunications industry to pursue market solutions that will keep\n\
    \   regulated companies from becoming viable players.  We must realize\n   that\
    \ we are about to enter a power struggle for the control of the\n   information\
    \ resources of the 21st century that promises to be every\n   bit as harsh and\
    \ bruising as the power struggle for natural resources\n   was at the end of the\
    \ last century.\n   While the intentions of most appear to be good, as this study\
    \ has\n   shown, the playing field is terribly confused. Gigabit technology (if\n\
    \   properly understood) is desirable. Still we should take great care\n   that\
    \ its cost does not raise the price of low bandwidth or \"low end\"\n   entry\
    \ into the network.\n   Lack of a specific definition of communities to be served,\
    \ lack of an\n   agreed upon plan for how they shall be served, and lack of funds\
    \ to\n   serve everyone have combined to create the present chaotic situation\n\
    \   in which many of the players have been motivated primarily by a\n   desire\
    \ to increase their institutional role in order to get larger\n   Federal allocations\
    \ of funds.\n   In the absence of both a well-thought-out plan agreed to by all\n\
    \   parties and adequate monetary support, the grand push to accelerate\n   both\
    \ the speed and scope of the technology could have the ironic role\n   of weakening\
    \ the entire foundation of the network.  Until the\n   Congress provides more\
    \ direction, the squabbling that has developed\n   is likely to continue.  In\
    \ the absence of such direction, at best\n   large sums of public funds may be\
    \ ineffectively spent, and at worst a\n   picture of empire building could emerge\
    \ that would make any Federal\n   support for research or educational networking\
    \ unlikely.\n   Such an outcome should be avoided because the potential of a well\n\
    \   designed and developed network to do great good in both policy arenas\n  \
    \ is very significant.  Unfortunately with the NSF under mounting\n   criticism,\
    \ ANS on the defensive and rumored to be financially\n   weakened, and Congressional\
    \ hearings scheduled for mid-March, the\n   potential for a destructive free-for-all\
    \ is very great.\n"
