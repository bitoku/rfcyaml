  - "1.  Abstract\n   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method
    for\n   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP\n
    \  also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP), which allows\n   negotiation
    of an Authentication Protocol for authenticating its peer\n   before allowing
    Network Layer protocols to transmit over the link.\n   Both LCP and Authentication
    Protocol packets may contain text which\n   is intended to be human-readable [2,3,4].
    \ This document defines an\n   LCP configuration option for the negotiation of
    character set and\n   language usage, as required by RFC 2277 [5].\n"

    \"MUST, \"MUST NOT\", \"optional\",\n   \"recommended\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD
    NOT\" are to be interpreted as\n   described in [6].\n"

  - "3.  Additional LCP Configuration Option\n   The Configuration Option format and
    basic options are already defined\n   for LCP [1].\n   Up-to-date values of the
    LCP Option Type field are specified in STD 2\n   [7].  This document concerns
    the following value:\n      28  Internationalization\n   The Internationalization
    option described here MAY be negotiated\n   independently in each direction.\n
    \  Only one instance of this option SHOULD be sent by an implementation,\n   representing
    its preferred language and charset.\n   If Internationalization option is rejected
    by the peer, the default\n   language and charset MUST be used to construct all
    human-readable\n   messages sent to the peer.\n"
  - "4.1.  Internationalization\n   Description\n      This Configuration Option provides
    a method for an implementation\n      to indicate to the peer both the language
    in which human-readable\n      messages it sends should be composed and the charset
    in which that\n      language should be represented.\n   A summary of the Internationalization
    option format is shown below.\n   The fields are transmitted from left to right.\n
    \   0                   1                   2                   3\n    0 1 2 3
    4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  |     Type      |    Length     |          MIBenum\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \            MIBenum (cont)        |        Language-Tag...\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  Type\n      28\n   Length\n      >= 7\n   MIBenum\n      The MIBenum field
    is four octets in length.  It contains a unique\n      integer value identifying
    a charset [5,11].\n      This value MUST represent one of the set of charsets
    listed in the\n      IANA charset registry [7].\n      The charset registration
    procedure is described in RFC 2278 [9].\n      The default charset value is UTF-8
    [10].  The MIBenum value for\n      the UTF-8 charset is 106.\n   Language-Tag\n
    \     The Language-Tag field is an ASCII string which contains a\n      language
    tag, as defined in RFC 1766 [8].\n      Language tags are in principle case-insensitive;
    however, since\n      the capitalization of a tag does not carry any meaning,\n
    \     implementations SHOULD send only lower-case Tag fields.\n      The default
    Tag value is \"i-default\" [8].\n"
