- title: 4.  Contexts of Use Cases
  contents:
  - "4.  Contexts of Use Cases\n   Use cases are sorted into two general groups: static\
    \ and on-demand\n   peering [RFC5486].  Each group can be further sub-divided\
    \ into Direct\n   Peering and Indirect Peering [RFC5486].  Although there may\
    \ be some\n   overlap among the use cases in these categories, there are different\n\
    \   requirements between the scenarios.  Each use case must specify a\n   basic\
    \ set of required operations to be performed by each SSP when\n   peering.\n \
    \  These can include:\n   o  Peer Discovery - Peer discovery via a Lookup Function\
    \ (LUF) to\n      determine the Session Establishment Data (SED) [RFC5486] of\
    \ the\n      request.  In VoIP use cases, a request normally contains a phone\n\
    \      number.  The O-SSP will input the phone number to the LUF and the\n   \
    \   LUF will normally return a SIP address of record (AOR) [RFC3261]\n      that\
    \ contains a domain name.\n   o  Next-Hop Routing Determination - Resolving the\
    \ SED information is\n      necessary to route the request to the T-SSP.  The\
    \ LRF is used for\n      this determination.  After obtaining the SED, the O-SSP\
    \ may use\n      the standard procedure defined in [RFC3263] to discover the next-\n\
    \      hop address.\n   o  Call setup - SSPs that are interconnecting to one another\
    \ may also\n      define specifics on what peering policies need to be used when\n\
    \      contacting the next hop in order to a) reach the next hop at all\n    \
    \  and b) prove that the sender is a legitimate peering partner.\n      Examples:\
    \ hard-code transport (TCP/UDP/TLS), non-standard port\n      number, specific\
    \ source IP address (e.g., in a private Layer 3\n      network), which TLS client\
    \ certificate [RFC5246] to use, and other\n      authentication schemes.\n   o\
    \  Call reception - This step ensures that the type of relationship\n      (static\
    \ or on-demand, indirect or direct) is understood and\n      acceptable.  For\
    \ example, the receiving SBE needs to determine\n      whether the INVITE it received\
    \ really came from a trusted member.\n"
- title: 5.  Use Cases
  contents:
  - "5.  Use Cases\n   Please note there are intra-domain message flows within the\
    \ use cases\n   to serve as supporting background information.  Only inter-domain\n\
    \   communications are germane to this document.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Static Peering Use Cases
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Static Peering Use Cases\n   Static peering [RFC5486] describes the use\
    \ case when two SSPs form a\n   peering relationship with some form of association\
    \ established prior\n   to the exchange of traffic.  Pre-association is a prerequisite\
    \ to\n   static peering.  Static peering is used in cases when two peers want\n\
    \   a consistent and tightly controlled approach to peering.  In this\n   scenario,\
    \ a number of variables, such as an identification method\n   (remote proxy IP\
    \ address) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters,\n   can be defined upfront\
    \ and known by each SSP prior to peering.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Static Direct Peering Use Case
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Static Direct Peering Use Case\n   This is the simplest form of a peering\
    \ use case.  Two SSPs negotiate\n   and agree to establish a SIP peering relationship.\
    \  The peer\n   connection is statically configured and the peer SSPs are directly\n\
    \   connected.  The peers may exchange interconnection parameters such as\n  \
    \ Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) [RFC2474] policies, the\n   maximum\
    \ number of requests per second, and proxy location prior to\n   establishing\
    \ the interconnection.  Typically, the T-SSP only accepts\n   traffic originating\
    \ directly from the trusted peer.\n         +--------------------+           \

    \   The following is a high-level depiction of the use case:\n   1.   The User\
    \ Agent Client (UAC) initiates a call via SIP INVITE to\n        O-Proxy.  O-Proxy\
    \ is the home proxy for UAC.\n         INVITE sip:+19175550100@example.com;user=phone\
    \ SIP/2.0\n         Via: SIP/2.0/TCP client.example.com:5060\n           ;branch=z9hG4bK74bf9\n\
    \         Max-Forwards: 10\n         From: Alice <sip:+14085550101@example.com;user=phone>\n\
    \           ;tag=12345\n         To: Bob <sip:+19175550100@example.com;user=phone>\n\
    \         Call-ID: abcde\n         CSeq: 1 INVITE\n         <allOneLine>\n   \
    \      Contact: <sip:+19175550100@client.example.com;user=phone;\n         transport=tcp>\n\
    \         </allOneLine>\n   Note that UAC inserted its Fully Qualified Domain\
    \ Name (FQDN) in the\n   VIA and CONTACT headers.  This example assumes that UAC\
    \ has its own\n   FQDN.\n   2.   UAC knows the User Agent Server's (UAS's) TN,\
    \ but does not know\n        UAS's domain.  It appends its own domain to generate\
    \ the SIP URI\n        in the Request-URI and TO header.  O-Proxy checks the Request-\n\
    \        URI and discovers that the Request-URI contains the user\n        parameter\
    \ \"user=phone\".  This parameter signifies that the\n        Request-URI is a\
    \ phone number.  So O-Proxy will extract the TN\n        from the Request-URI\
    \ and query the LUF for SED information from\n        a routing database.  In\
    \ this example, the LUF is an ENUM\n        [RFC6116] database.  The ENUM entry\
    \ looks similar to this:\n          $ORIGIN 0.0.1.0.5.5.5.7.1.9.1.e164.arpa.\n\
    \          IN NAPTR (\n            10\n            100\n            \"u\"\n  \
    \          \"E2U+SIP\"\n            \"!^.*$!sip:+19175550100@example.net!\"\n\
    \            . )\n   This SED data can be provisioned by O-SSP or populated by\
    \ the T-SSP.\n   3.   O-Proxy examines the SED and discovers the domain is external.\n\
    \        Given the O-Proxy's internal routing policy, O-Proxy decides to\n   \
    \     use O-SBE to reach T-SBE.  O-Proxy routes the INVITE request to\n      \
    \  O-SBE and adds a Route header that contains O-SBE.\n         INVITE sip:+19175550100@example.net;user=phone\
    \ SIP/2.0\n         Via: SIP/2.0/TCP o-proxy.example.com:5060\n           ;branch=z9hG4bKye8ad\n\
    \         Via: SIP/2.0/TCP client.example.com:5060\n           ;branch=z9hG4bK74bf9;received=192.0.1.1\n\
    \         Max-Forwards: 9\n         Route: <sip:o-sbe1.example.com;lr>\n     \
    \    Record-Route: <sip:o-proxy.example.com;lr>\n         From: Alice <sip:+14085550101@example.com;user=phone>\n\
    \           ;tag=12345\n         To: Bob <sip:+19175550100@example.com;user=phone>\n\
    \         Call-ID: abcde\n         CSeq: 1 INVITE\n         <allOneLine>\n   \
    \      Contact: <sip:+19175550100@client.example.com;user=phone;\n         transport=tcp>\n\
    \         </allOneLine>\n   4.   O-SBE receives the requests and pops the top\
    \ entry of the Route\n        header that contains \"o-sbe1.example.com\".  O-SBE\
    \ examines the\n        Request-URI and does an LRF for \"example.net\".  In this\
    \ example,\n        the LRF is a Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) DNS query\n\
    \        [RFC3403] of the domain name.  O-SBE receives a NAPTR response\n    \
    \    from the LRF.  The response looks similar to this:\n          IN NAPTR (\n\
    \            50\n            50\n            \"S\"\n            \"SIP+D2T\"\n\
    \            \"\"\n            _sip._tcp.t-sbe.example.net. )\n          IN NAPTR\
    \ (\n            90\n            50\n            \"S\"\n            \"SIP+D2U\"\
    \n            \"\"\n            _sip._udp.t-sbe.example.net. )\n   5.   Given\
    \ the lower order for TCP in the NAPTR response, O-SBE\n        decides to use\
    \ TCP as the transport protocol, so it sends an SRV\n        DNS query for the\
    \ SRV record [RFC2782] for \"_sip._tcp.t-\n        sbe.example.net.\" to O-LRF.\n\
    \        ;;     priority  weight   port  target\n        IN SRV 0         2  \
    \      5060  t-sbe1.example.net.\n        IN SRV 0         1        5060  t-sbe2.example.net.\n\
    \   6.   Given the higher weight for \"t-sbe1.example.net\", O-SBE sends an\n\
    \        A record DNS query for \"t-sbe1.example.net.\" to get the A\n       \
    \ record:\n          ;; DNS ANSWER\n          t-sbe1.example.net.   IN A   192.0.2.100\n\
    \          t-sbe1.example.net.   IN A   192.0.2.101\n   7.   O-SBE sends the INVITE\
    \ to T-SBE.  O-SBE is the egress point to\n        the O-SSP domain, so it should\
    \ ensure subsequent mid-dialog\n        requests traverse via itself.  If O-SBE\
    \ chooses to act as a\n        back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) [RFC3261], it will\

    \ Normally, the operator\n   will deploy the SBE at the edge of its administrative\
    \ domain.  The\n   signaling traffic will pass between two networks through the\
    \ SBEs.\n   The operator has many reasons to deploy an SBE.  For example, the\n\
    \   O-SSP may use [RFC1918] addresses for their UA and proxies.  These\n   addresses\
    \ are not routable in the target network.  The SBE can\n   perform a NAT function.\
    \  Also, the SBE eases the operation cost for\n   deploying or removing Layer\
    \ 5 network elements.  Consider the\n   deployment architecture where multiple\
    \ proxies connect to a single\n   SBE.  An operator can add or remove a proxy\
    \ without coordinating with\n   the peer operator.  The peer operator \"sees\"\
    \ only the SBE.  As long\n   as the SBE is maintained in the path, the peer operator\
    \ does not need\n   to be notified.\n   When an operator deploys SBEs, the operator\
    \ is required to advertise\n   the SBE to the peer LRF so that the peer operator\
    \ can locate the SBE\n   and route the traffic to the SBE accordingly.\n   SBE\
    \ deployment is a decision within an administrative domain.  Either\n   one or\
    \ both administrative domains can decide to deploy SBE(s).  To\n   the peer network,\
    \ most important is to identify the next-hop address.\n   This decision does not\

  contents:
  - "5.4.  Static Indirect Peering Use Case - Assisting LUF and LRF\n   The difference\
    \ between a Static Direct Use Case and a Static Indirect\n   Use Case lies within\
    \ the Layer 5 relationship maintained by the O-SSP\n   and T-SSP.  In the Indirect\
    \ use case, the O-SSP and T-SSP do not have\n   direct Layer 5 connectivity. \
    \ They require one or multiple Indirect\n   Domains to assist with routing the\
    \ SIP messages and possibly the\n   associated media.\n   In this use case, the\
    \ O-SSP and T-SSP want to form a peer\n   relationship.  For some reason, the\
    \ O-SSP and T-SSP do not have\n   direct Layer 5 connectivity.  The reasons may\
    \ vary, for example,\n   business demands and/or domain policy controls.  Due\
    \ to this indirect\n   relationship, the signaling will traverse from the O-SSP\
    \ through one\n   or multiple I-SSPs to reach the T-SSP.\n   In addition, the\
    \ O-SSP is using a LUF/LRF Provider.  This LUF/LRF\n   Provider stores the T-SSP's\
    \ SED pre-populated by the T-SSP.  One\n   important motivation to use the LUF/LRF\
    \ Provider is that the T-SSP\n   only needs to populate its SED once to the provider.\
    \  Using an LUF/\n   LRF Provider allows the T-SSP to populate its SED once, while\
    \ any\n   O-SSP T-SSP's SED can use this LUF/LRF Provider.  Current practice\n\
    \   has shown that it is rather difficult for the T-SSP to populate its\n   SED\
    \ to every O-SSP who must reach the T-SSP's subscribers.  This is\n   especially\
    \ true in the Enterprise environment.\n   Note that the LUF/LRF Provider and the\

    \ the UAS's domain.\n        It appends its own domain to generate the SIP URI\

    \ that the response shows the next-hop is the SBE in I-SSP.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ the O-SSP may have a pre-association with the I-SSP.\n   As such, the O-SSP\
    \ will forward all requests that contain an external\n   domain in the Request-URI\
    \ or an unknown TN to the I-SSP.  The O-SSP\n   will rely on the I-SSP to determine\
    \ the T-SSP and route the request\n   correctly.  In this configuration, the O-SSP\
    \ can skip Steps 2, 4, 5,\n   and 6 and forward the request directly to the I-SBE.\

    \ difference is the O-SSP\n   and T-SSP do not have direct Layer 5 connectivity.\
    \  Instead, O-SSP\n   connects to the T-SSP indirectly via the I-SSP.\n   Typically,\
    \ an LUF/LRF Provider serves multiple O-SSPs.  Two O-SSPs\n   may use different\
    \ I-SSPs to reach the same T-SSP.  For example,\n   O-SSP1 may use I-SSP1 to reach\
    \ T-SSP, but O-SSP2 may use I-SSP2 to\n   reach T-SSP.  Given the O-SSP and T-SSP\
    \ pair as input, the LUF/LRF\n   Provider will return the SED of I-SSP that is\
    \ trusted by O-SSP to\n   forward the request to T-SSP.\n   In this use case,\
    \ there are two levels of trust relationship.  The\n   first trust relationship\
    \ is between the O-SSP and the LUF/LRF\n   Provider.  The O-SSP trusts the LUF/LRF\
    \ to provide the T-SSP's SED.\n   The second trust relationship is between the\
    \ O-SSP and I-SSP.  The\n   O-SSP trusts the I-SSP to provide Layer 5 connectivity\
    \ to assist the\n   O-SSP in reaching the T-SSP.  The O-SSP and I-SSP have a pre-arranged\n\
    \   agreement for policy.  Note that Figure 4 shows a single provider to\n   supply\
