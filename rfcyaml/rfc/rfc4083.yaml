  - "Abstract\n   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has selected Session\n\
    \   Initiation Protocol (SIP) as the session establishment protocol for\n   the\
    \ 3GPP IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS).  IMS is part of\n   Release\
    \ 5 of the 3GPP specifications.  Although SIP is a protocol\n   that fulfills\
    \ most of the requirements for establishing a session in\n   an IP network, SIP\
    \ has never been evaluated against the specific 3GPP\n   requirements for operation\
    \ in a cellular network.  In this document,\n   we express the requirements identified\
    \ by 3GPP to support SIP for\n   Release 5 of the 3GPP IMS in cellular networks.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   3GPP has selected SIP [2] as the protocol to establish and\
    \ tear down\n   multimedia sessions in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).  3GPP\n\
    \   Technical Specification 23.228 [28] describes the IMS.  3GPP\n   Technical\
    \ Specification 24.228 [29] contains a comprehensive set of\n   session flows.\
    \  3GPP Technical Specification 24.229 [30] describes\n   the usage of SIP by\
    \ the various IMS nodes.\n   This document is an effort to define the requirements\
    \ applicable to\n   the usage of the SIP protocol suite in cellular networks,\n\
    \   particularly in the 3GPP IMS for Release 5 of the 3GPP\n   specifications.\
    \  Further releases of the 3GPP specifications may\n   contain additional SIP\
    \ requirements.  This document focuses on the\n   requirements identified for\
    \ the 3GPP Release 5 IMS.\n   The rest of this document is structured as follows:\n\
    \   o  Section 3 offers an overview of the 3GPP IMS.  Readers who are not\n  \
    \    familiar with it should carefully read this section.\n   o  Section 4 contains\
    \ the 3GPP requirements to SIP.  Requirements are\n      grouped by category.\
    \  Some requirements include statements on\n      possible solutions that would\
    \ be able to fulfill them.  Note that,\n      as a particular requirement might\
    \ be fulfilled by different\n      solutions, not all the solutions might have\
    \ an impact on SIP.\n   This document is advisory in nature.  Its primary purpose\
    \ is to help\n   the IETF understand the IMS environment.  Given this better\n\
    \   understanding, we expect that the IETF can more effectively evolve\n   the\
    \ SIP protocol.  The IETF will not respond to the requirements\n   given in this\
    \ document on a point-for-point basis.  Some requirements\n   have been and/or\
    \ will be met by extensions to the SIP protocol.\n   Others may be addressed by\
    \ effectively using existing capabilities in\n   SIP or other protocols, and we\
    \ expect that individual members of the\n   SIP community will work with 3GPP\
    \ to achieve a better understanding\n   of these mechanisms.  Some of the requirements\
    \ in this document may\n   not be addressed at all by the IETF, although we believe\
    \ that the act\n   of documenting and discussing them is in itself helpful in\
    \ achieving\n   a better all-around understanding of the task at hand.\n"

- title: 3.  Overview of the 3GPP IMS
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview of the 3GPP IMS\n   This section gives the reader an overview of\
    \ the 3GPP IM CN Subsystem\n   (IMS).  It is not intended to be comprehensive,\
    \ but it provides\n   enough information to understand the basis of the 3GPP IMS.\
    \  Readers\n   are encouraged to find a more detailed description in the 3GPP\n\
    \   Technical Specifications 23.060 [27], 23.228 [28], and 24.228 [29].\n   For\
    \ a particular cellular device, the 3GPP IMS network is further\n   decomposed\
    \ in a home network and a visited network.\n   An IMS subscriber belongs to his\
    \ or her home network.  Services are\n   triggered and may be executed in the\
    \ home network.  One or more SIP\n   servers are deployed in the SIP home network\
    \ to support the IP\n   Multimedia Subsystem.  Among those SIP servers, there\
    \ is a SIP\n   serving proxy, which is also acting as a SIP registrar.\n   Authentication/Authorization\
    \ servers may be part of the home network\n   as well.  Users are authenticated\
    \ in the home network.\n   A SIP outbound proxy is provided to support the User\
    \ Agent (UA).  The\n   SIP outbound proxy is typically located in the visited\
    \ network,\n   although it may be located in the home network as well.  The SIP\n\
    \   outbound proxy maintains security associations between itself and the\n  \
    \ terminals, and interworks with the resource management in the packet\n   network.\n\
    \   The SIP outbound proxy is assigned after the mobile device has\n   connected\
    \ to the access network.  Once this proxy is assigned, it\n   does not change\
    \ while the mobile remains connected to the access\n   network.  Thus the mobile\
    \ can move freely within the access network\n   without SIP outbound proxy reassignment.\n\
    \   The home network may also support one or more SIP edge proxies.\n   These\
    \ nodes may act as the first entry points for SIP signaling to\n   the home network\
    \ and may determine (with the help of location\n   servers) which SIP registrar\
    \ server to assign to a particular user.\n   Typically the address of the home\
    \ network SIP edge proxy is\n   configured in DNS in the form of a DNS Naming\
    \ Authority Pointer\n   (NAPTR) and Service (SRV) records for SIP.\n   Additionally,\
    \ home and visited networks may deploy, if required, a\n   SIP-hiding proxy. \
    \ The main purpose of the SIP-hiding proxy is to\n   hide the network configuration.\n\
    \   The 3GPP IM CN Subsystem is designed to be access independent.\n   Access\
    \ is granted from 3GPP cellular terminals or from other\n   terminals that use\
    \ other accesses out of the scope of 3GPP.\n   3GPP cellular IP Multimedia terminals\
    \ use the existing General Packet\n   Radio Service (GPRS) [27] as a transport\
    \ network for IP datagrams.\n   The terminals first connect to the GPRS network\
    \ to get an IPv6\n   prefix.  In order to do this, the terminals must perform\
    \ a GPRS\n   Attach procedure followed by a GPRS PDP Context Activation procedure.\n\
    \   These GPRS procedures are required to be completed before any IP\n   Multimedia\
    \ session can be established.\n   As a result of the above-mentioned GPRS procedures,\
    \ the terminal has\n   built an IPv6 address.  The IPv6 address belongs to the\
    \ same network\n   address space as does the SIP outbound proxy.  The address\
    \ does not\n   change, as the mobile terminal moves while still attached to the\
    \ same\n   network address space.\n   If the terminal moves from a GPRS access\
    \ to another GPRS access, the\n   above-mentioned GPRS procedures needs to start\
    \ from the beginning to\n   allocate an IPv6 address to the terminal.\n   Figure\
    \ 1 shows an overview of the 3GPP architecture for IM CN\n   Subsystem.\n    \

    \ SIP proxy server\n   (such as the SIP serving proxy at home) is involved in\

    \ must be provided.  We assume that there is a mechanism by which\n   the SIP\

    \ session termination.  This allows transforming the\n   ungraceful session release\
    \ into a graceful session release ordered by\n   the network (see the next section).\
    \  For example, upon reception of\n   the notification of loss of mobile radio\

    \ SIP signaling.\n   o  The addresses of the charging functions are passed by\
    \ the serving\n      SIP proxy to all IMS network entities in the session signaling\n\

    \ IDs are passed by the outbound SIP proxy to the\n      serving SIP proxy and\
    \ the Application Servers using SIP signaling.\n      They are not transferred\
    \ from one home IMS (e.g., caller's home)\n      to another (e.g., callee's home).\n\

    \   The scope for security of the 3GPP IMS is the SIP signaling between\n   the\
    \ various SIP entities.  Protecting the end-to-end media streams\n   may be a\
    \ future extension, but it is not considered in the Release 5\n   version of the\
    \ IMS specifications.\n   Each operator providing IMS services acts as its own\
    \ domain of trust\n   and shares a long-term security association with its subscribers\n\
    \   (e.g., pre-shared keys).  Operators may enter into roaming agreements\n  \
    \ with other operators, in which case a certain level of trust exists\n   between\
    \ their respective domains.\n   SIP UAs must authenticate to their home network\
    \ before the use of IMS\n   resources is authorized.  In Release 5 of the 3GPP\
    \ IMS\n   specifications, authentication is performed during registration and\n\
    \   re-registrations.\n   Portions of the SIP signaling must be protected hop\

    \ zones where\n   the required security is unique:\n   o  Access Domain:  Between\

    \ Domain: Between the visited and home networks, or inside\n                 \
    \     the home network.\n   Characteristics needed in the Access Domain are quite\
    \ different from\n   those of the Network Domain because of the terminal's requirements\n\
    \   for mobility, computation restriction, battery limit, bandwidth\n   conservation,\
    \ and radio interface.  SIP entities in the access domain\n   should be able to\
    \ maintain security contexts with a large group of\n   users in parallel.  Furthermore,\
    \ Access Domain provides user-specific\n   security associations, whereas Network\
    \ Domain provides security\n   associations between network nodes.  Therefore,\
    \ the weight of\n   protocols and algorithms and their compliance with compression\n\

  - "4.24.2.1.  Authentication Method\n   A strong, mutual authentication must be\
    \ provided.\n   The authentication method must be able to work when there are\
    \ zero or\n   more SIP proxies in the SIP path between the authenticator and the\n\
    \   authenticated user.\n   It must be possible to support extensible authentication\
    \ methods.\n   Therefore, authentication using an extensible authentication\n\
    \   framework is strongly recommended.\n   Authentication methods based on the\
    \ secure storage of long-term keys\n   used for authentication and the secure\
    \ execution of authentication\n   algorithms must be supported.\n   The SIP client's\
    \ credentials must not be transferred as plain text.\n   3GPP intends to reuse\
    \ UMTS AKA [13].  UMTS AKA applies a symmetric\n   cryptographic scheme, provides\
    \ mutual authentication, and is\n   typically implemented on a so-called SIM card\
    \ that provides secure\n   storage on the user's side.\n   Additional requirements\
    \ related to message protection that apply to\n   the authentication method are\
    \ stated in Section 4.24.3.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.24.3.1.  Message Protection Mechanisms\n   SIP entities (typically a SIP client\
    \ and a SIP proxy) must be able to\n   communicate using integrity.  By integrity,\
    \ we mean the ability for\n   the receiver of a message to verify that the message\
    \ has not been\n   modified in transit.  SIP entities should be able to communicate\n\
    \   confidentially.  In 3GPP IMS, these protection modes must be based on\n  \
    \ initial authentication.  Integrity protection and confidentiality\n   must be\
    \ possible using symmetric cryptographic keys.\n   It must also be possible to\
    \ handle error conditions in a satisfactory\n   manner as to allow recovery (see\
    \ also sections 4.3.6.3 and 4.14).\n   It must be possible to provide this protection\
    \ between two adjacent\n   SIP entities.  In future network scenarios, it may\
    \ also be necessary\n   to provide this protection through proxies, though the\
    \ 3GPP Release 5\n   IMS does not require this.\n   The security mechanism must\
    \ be able to protect a complete SIP\n   message.\n   If header compression/removal\
    \ or SIP compression is applied to SIP\n   messages, it must be compatible with\
    \ message protection.\n"
- title: 4.24.3.2.  Delegation
  contents:
  - "4.24.3.2.  Delegation\n   3GPP IMS implements distributed security functions\
    \ responsible for\n   authentication and message protection.\n   It must be possible\
    \ to perform an initial authentication based on\n   long-term authentication credentials,\
    \ followed by subsequent\n   protected signaling that uses short-term authentication\
    \ credentials,\n   such as session keys created during initial authentication.\
    \  The\n   authentication mechanism used is able to provide such session keys.\n\
    \   It must be possible to apply subsequent message protection as soon as\n  \
    \ possible, even during the initial authentication period.\n   Initial authentication\
    \ is performed between the SIP UA and the\n   authenticating SIP serving proxy\
    \ in the home network.  However, the\n   authentication mechanism must not require\
    \ access to the long-term\n   authentication credentials in these nodes.  In the\
    \ home network, the\n   authenticating SIP serving proxy must support interaction\
    \ with a\n   dedicated authentication server in order to accomplish the\n   authentication\
    \ task.  At the client side, a secured\n   (tamper-resistant) device storing the\
    \ long-term credentials of the\n   user must perform the authentication.\n   Additionally,\
    \ the SIP serving proxy that performed the initial\n   authentication must be\
    \ able to delegate subsequent SIP signaling\n   protection (e.g., session keys\
    \ for integrity or encryption) securely\n   to an authorized SIP proxy further\
    \ downstream.  The tamper-resistant\n   device at the client side must be able\
    \ to delegate the session keys\n   securely to the SIP UA.\n"
- title: 4.24.4.  Negotiation of Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "4.24.4.  Negotiation of Mechanisms\n   A method must be provided to negotiate\
    \ the security mechanisms to be\n   used in the access domain securely.\n   This\
    \ method must at least support the negotiation of different\n   security mechanisms\
    \ providing integrity protection and encryption,\n   algorithms used within these\
    \ mechanisms, and additional parameters\n   that they require in order to be exchanged.\n\
    \   The negotiation mechanism must protect against attackers who do not\n   have\
    \ access to authentication credentials.  In particular, the\n   negotiation mechanism\
    \ must be able to detect a possible\n   man-in-the-middle attacker who could influence\
    \ the negotiation result\n   so that services with weaker security or with none\
    \ are negotiated.\n   A negotiation mechanism is generally required in all secure\
    \ protocols\n   to decide which security services to use and when they should\
    \ be\n   started.  This security mechanism serves algorithm and protocol\n   development\
    \ as well as interoperability.  Often, the negotiation is\n   handled within a\
    \ security service.  For example, the HTTP\n   authentication scheme includes\
    \ a selection mechanism for choosing\n   among appropriate algorithms.  Note that\
    \ when referring to\n   negotiation we mean just the negotiation, not all functions\
    \ in\n   protocols such as IKE.  For instance, we expect that the session key\n\
    \   generation is to be a part of the initial authentication.\n   SIP entities\
    \ must be able to use the same security mode parameters to\n   protect several\
    \ SIP sessions without re-negotiation.  For example,\n   security mode parameters\
    \ may be assumed to be valid within the\n   lifetime of a registration.  Note\
    \ that it is necessary to amortize\n   the cost of security association setup\
    \ and parameter negotiation over\n   several INVITEs.\n"
