  - "1.  Introduction\n   The network-based localized mobility management (NETLMM)\
    \ architecture\n   [1] supports movement of IPv6 mobile nodes locally within a\
    \ domain\n   without requiring mobility support in the mobile nodes' network\n\
    \   stacks.  A mobile node can keep its IP address constant as it moves\n   from\
    \ link to link, avoiding the signaling overhead and latency\n   associated with\
    \ changing the IP address.  Software specifically for\n   localized mobility management\
    \ is not required on the mobile node,\n   whereas IP-layer movement detection\
    \ software may be necessary, and\n   driver software for link-layer mobility is\
    \ prerequisite.\n   The IP addresses of mobile nodes have a prefix that routes\
    \ to a\n   localized mobility anchor (LMA) [3].  The LMA maintains an individual\n\
    \   route for each registered mobile node.  Any particular mobile node's\n   route\
    \ terminates at a mobile access gateway (MAG) [3], to which the\n   mobile node\
    \ attaches at its current access link.  MAGs are\n   responsible for updating\
    \ the mobile node's route on the LMA as the\n   mobile node moves.  A MAG detects\
    \ the arrival of a mobile node on its\n   local access link based on handoff signaling\
    \ that the mobile node\n   pursues.  The MAG may additionally monitor connectivity\
    \ of the mobile\n   node in order to recognize when the mobile node has left the\
    \ local\n   access link.  The localized mobility management architecture\n   therefore\
    \ has two interfaces:\n   1.  The interface between a MAG and an LMA where route\
    \ update\n       signaling occurs.\n   2.  The interface between a mobile node\
    \ and its current MAG where\n       handoff signaling and other link maintenance\
    \ signaling occur.\n   The localized mobility management architecture demands\
    \ no specific\n   protocol for a MAG to detect the arrival or departure of mobile\
    \ nodes\n   to and from its local access link and accordingly initiate route\n\
    \   update signaling with an LMA.  An appropriate mechanism may be\n   entirely\
    \ implemented at the link layer, such as is common for\n   cellular networks.\
    \  In that case, the IP layer never detects any\n   movement, even when a mobile\
    \ node moves from one link to another\n   handled by a different MAG.  If the\
    \ link layer does not provide the\n   necessary functionality, the mobile node\
    \ must perform IP-layer\n   movement detection and auto-configuration signaling,\
    \ thereby\n   providing the trigger for the MAG to update its route on the LMA.\
    \  A\n   mobile node identity, established by the localized mobility\n   management\
    \ domain when the mobile node initially connects and\n   authenticates, enables\
    \ the MAG to ascribe the decisive link- or IP-\n   layer signaling to the correct\
    \ mobile node.  Some wireless access\n   technologies may require the mobile node\
    \ identity to be reestablished\n   on every link-layer handoff.\n   Vulnerabilities\
    \ in either interface of the localized mobility\n   management architecture may\
    \ entail new security threats that go\n   beyond those that already exist in IPv6.\
    \  Potential attack objectives\n   may be to consume network services at the cost\
    \ of a legitimate mobile\n   node, interpose in a mobile node's communications\
    \ and possibly\n   impersonate the mobile node from a position off-link, operate\
    \ under\n   the disguise of a false or non-existing identity, or cause denial\
    \ of\n   service to a mobile node or to the localized mobility management\n  \
    \ domain as a whole.  This document identifies and discusses security\n   threats\
    \ on both interfaces of the localized mobility management\n   architecture.  It\
    \ is limited to threats that are peculiar to\n   localized mobility management;\
    \ threats to IPv6 in general are\n   documented in [4].\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The terminology in this document follows the definitions\
    \ in [2], with\n   those revisions and additions from [1].  In addition, the following\n\
    \   definition is used:\n   Mobile Node Identity\n      An identity established\
    \ for the mobile node when initially\n      connecting to the localized mobility\
    \ management domain.  It allows\n      the localized mobility management domain\
    \ to definitively and\n      unambiguously identify the mobile node upon handoff\
    \ for route\n      update signaling purposes.  The mobile node identity is\n \
    \     conceptually independent of the mobile node's IP or link-layer\n      addresses,\
    \ but it must be securely bound to the mobile node's\n      handoff signaling.\n"

  - "2.  Threats to Interface between LMA and MAG\n   The localized mobility management\
    \ protocol executed on the interface\n   between an LMA and a MAG serves to establish,\

    \ to this\n   interface can be separated into compromise or impersonation of a\n\
    \   legitimate LMA, compromise or impersonation of a legitimate MAG, and\n   man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks.\n"
- title: 2.1.  LMA Compromise or Impersonation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  LMA Compromise or Impersonation\n   A compromised LMA can ignore route\
    \ updates from a legitimate MAG in\n   order to deny service to a mobile node.\
    \  It may also be able to trick\n   a legitimate MAG into creating a new, incorrect\
    \ route, thereby\n   preparing the MAG to receive redirected traffic of a mobile\
    \ node; it\n   may cause the traffic forwarded by a MAG to be redirected to a\n\
    \   different LMA; or it may simply have the MAG drop an existing route\n   in\
    \ order to deny the mobile node service.  Since data plane traffic\n   for mobile\
    \ nodes routes through the LMA, a compromised LMA can also\n   intercept, inspect,\
    \ modify, or drop such traffic, or redirect it to a\n   destination in collusion\
    \ with the attacker.  The attack can be\n   conducted transiently to selectively\
    \ disable traffic for any\n   particular mobile node or MAG at particular times.\n\
    \   Moreover, a compromised LMA may manipulate its routing table such\n   that\
    \ all packets are directed towards a single MAG.  This may result\n   in a denial-of-service\
    \ attack against that MAG and its attached\n   access link.\n   These threats\
    \ also emanate from an attacker which tricks a MAG into\n   believing that it\
    \ is a legitimate LMA.  This attacker can cause the\n   MAG to conduct route update\
    \ signaling with the attacker instead of\n   with the legitimate LMA, enabling\
    \ it to ignore route updates from the\n   MAG, or induce incorrect route changes\
    \ at the MAG as described above,\n   in order to redirect or deny a mobile node's\
    \ traffic.  The attacker\n   does not necessarily have to be on the original control\
    \ plane path\n   between the legitimate LMA and the MAG, provided that it can\
    \ somehow\n   make its presence known to the MAG.  Failure to mutually authenticate\n\
    \   when establishing an association between an LMA and a MAG would allow\n  \
    \ an attacker to establish itself as a rogue LMA.\n   The attacker may further\
    \ be able to intercept, inspect, modify, drop,\n   or redirect data plane traffic\
    \ to and from a mobile node.  This is\n   obvious if the attacker is on the original\
    \ data plane path between\n   the legitimate LMA and the mobile node's current\
    \ MAG, which may\n   happen independently of whether the attacker is on the original\n\
    \   control plane path.  If the attacker is not on this path, it may be\n   able\
    \ to leverage the localized mobility management protocol to\n   redefine the prefix\
    \ that the mobile node uses in IP address\n   configuration.  The attacker can\
    \ then specify a prefix that routes to\n   itself.  Whether or not outgoing data\
    \ plane packets sourced by the\n   mobile node can be interfered with by an attacker\
    \ off the original\n   data plane path depends on the specific data plane forwarding\n\
    \   mechanism within the localized mobility management domain.  For\n   example,\
    \ if IP-in-IP encapsulation or an equivalent approach is used\n   for outbound\
    \ data plane packets, the packets can be forced to be\n   routed through the attacker.\
    \  On the other hand, standard IP routing\n   may cause the packets to be relayed\
    \ via a legitimate LMA and hence to\n   circumvent the attacker.\n"
- title: 2.2.  MAG Compromise or Impersonation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  MAG Compromise or Impersonation\n   A compromised MAG can redirect a mobile\
    \ node's traffic onto its local\n   access link arbitrarily, without authorization\
    \ from the mobile node.\n   This threat is similar to an attack on a typical routing\
    \ protocol\n   where a malicious stub router injects a bogus host route for the\n\
    \   mobile node.  In general, forgery of a subnet prefix in link state or\n  \
    \ distance vector routing protocols requires support of multiple\n   routers in\
    \ order to obtain a meaningful change in forwarding\n   behavior.  But a bogus\
    \ host route is likely to take precedence over\n   the routing information advertised\
    \ by legitimate routers, which is\n   usually less specific; hence, the attack\
    \ should succeed even if the\n   attacker is not supported by other routers. \
    \ A difference between\n   redirection in a routing protocol and redirection in\
    \ localized\n   mobility management is that the former impacts the routing tables\
    \ of\n   multiple routers, whereas the latter involves only the compromised\n\
    \   MAG and an LMA.\n   Moreover, a compromised MAG can ignore the presence of\
    \ a mobile node\n   on its local access link and refrain from registering the\
    \ mobile node\n   at an LMA.  The mobile node then loses its traffic.  The compromised\n\
    \   MAG may further be able to cause interruption to a mobile node by\n   deregistering\
    \ the mobile node at the serving LMA, pretending that the\n   mobile node has\
    \ powered down.  The mobile node then needs to\n   reinitiate the network access\
    \ authentication procedure, which the\n   compromised MAG may prevent repeatedly\
    \ until the mobile node moves to\n   a different MAG.  The mobile node should\
    \ be able to handle this\n   situation, but the recovery process may be lengthy\
    \ and hence impair\n   ongoing communication sessions to a significant extent.\n\
    \   Denial of service against an LMA is another threat of MAG subversion.\n  \
    \ The compromised MAG can trick an LMA into believing that a high\n   number of\
    \ mobile nodes have attached to the MAG.  The LMA will then\n   establish a routing\
    \ table entry for each of the non-existing mobile\n   nodes.  The unexpected growth\
    \ of the routing table may eventually\n   cause the LMA to reject legitimate route\
    \ update requests.  It may\n   also decrease the forwarding speed for data plane\
    \ packets due to\n   higher route lookup latencies, and it may, for the same reason,\
    \ slow\n   down the responsiveness to control plane packets.  Another adverse\n\
    \   side effect of a high number of routing table entries is that the\n   LMA,\
    \ and hence the localized mobility management domain as a whole,\n   becomes more\
    \ susceptible to flooding packets from external attackers\n   (see Section 4).\
    \  The high number of superfluous routes increase the\n   probability that a flooding\
    \ packet, sent to a random IP address\n   within the localized mobility management\
    \ domain, matches an existing\n   routing table entry at the LMA and gets tunneled\
    \ to a MAG, which in\n   turn performs address resolution on the local access\
    \ link.  At the\n   same time, fewer flooding packets can be dropped directly\
    \ at the LMA\n   on the basis of a nonexistent routing table entry.\n   All of\
    \ these threats apply not just to a compromised MAG, but also to\n   an attacker\
    \ that manages to counterfeit the identity of a legitimate\n   MAG in interacting\
    \ with both mobile nodes and an LMA.  Such an\n   attacker can behave towards\
    \ mobile nodes like an authorized MAG and\n   engage an LMA in route update signaling.\
    \  In a related attack, the\n   perpetrator eavesdrops on signaling packets exchanged\
    \ between a\n   legitimate MAG and an LMA, and replays these packets at a later\
    \ time.\n   These attacks may be conducted transiently, to selectively disable\n\
    \   traffic for any particular mobile node at particular times.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Man-in-the-Middle Attack
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Man-in-the-Middle Attack\n   An attacker that manages to interject itself\
    \ between a legitimate LMA\n   and a legitimate MAG can act as a man in the middle\
    \ with respect to\n   both control plane signaling and data plane traffic.  If\
    \ the attacker\n   is on the original control plane path, it can forge, modify,\
    \ or drop\n   route update packets so as to cause the establishment of incorrect\n\
    \   routes or the removal of routes that are in active use.  Similarly,\n   an\
    \ attacker on the original data plane path can intercept, inspect,\n   modify,\
    \ drop, and redirect data plane packets sourced by or destined\n   to a mobile\
    \ node.\n   A compromised switch or router located between an LMA and a MAG can\n\
    \   cause similar damage.  Any switch or router on the control plane path\n  \
    \ can forge, modify, or drop control plane packets, and thereby\n   interfere\
    \ with route establishment.  Any switch or router on the data\n   plane path can\
    \ intercept, inspect, modify, and drop data plane\n   packets, or rewrite IP headers\
    \ so as to divert the packets from their\n   original path.\n   An attacker between\
    \ an LMA and a MAG may further impersonate the MAG\n   towards the LMA, and vice\
    \ versa in route update signaling.  The\n   attacker can interfere with a route\
    \ establishment even if it is not\n   on the original control plane path between\
    \ the LMA and the MAG.  An\n   attacker off the original data plane path may undertake\
    \ the same to\n   cause inbound data plane packets destined to the mobile node\
    \ to be\n   routed first from the LMA to the attacker, then to the mobile node's\n\
    \   MAG, and finally to the mobile node itself.  As explained in\n   Section 2.1,\
    \ here, too, it depends on the specific data plane\n   forwarding mechanism within\
    \ the localized mobility management domain\n   whether or not the attacker can\
    \ influence the route of outgoing data\n   plane packets sourced by the mobile\
    \ node.\n"

    \ attacks.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Mobile Node Compromise or Impersonation
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Mobile Node Compromise or Impersonation\n   An attacker that is able to\
    \ forge the mobile node identity of a\n   mobile node can trick a MAG into redirecting\
    \ data plane packets for\n   the mobile node to the attacker.  The attacker can\
    \ launch such an\n   impersonation attack against a mobile node that resides on\
    \ the same\n   link as the attacker, or against a mobile node on a different link.\n\
    \   If the attack is on-link, the redirection of packets from the mobile\n   node\
    \ to the attacker is internal to the MAG, and it involves no route\n   update\
    \ signaling between the MAG and an LMA.  On-link attacks are\n   possible in a\
    \ regular IPv6 network [4] that does not use Secure\n   Neighbor Discovery [5].\n\
    \   Off-link impersonation requires the attacker to fabricate handoff\n   signaling\
    \ of the mobile node and thus trick the MAG into believing\n   that the mobile\
    \ node has handed over onto the MAG's access link.  The\n   attack is conceivable\
    \ both if the attacker and the mobile node are on\n   separate links that connect\
    \ to different MAGs, as well as if they are\n   on separate, possibly virtual\
    \ per-mobile-node links that connect to\n   the same MAG.  In the former case,\
    \ two MAGs would think they see the\n   mobile node and both would independently\
    \ perform route update\n   signaling with the LMA.  In the latter case, route\
    \ update signaling\n   is likely to be performed only once, and the redirection\
    \ of packets\n   from the mobile node to the attacker is internal to the MAG.\
    \  The\n   mobile node can always recapture its traffic back from the attacker\n\
    \   through another run of handoff signaling.  But standard mobile nodes\n   are\
    \ generally not prepared to counteract this kind of attack, and\n   even where\
    \ network stacks include suitable functionality, the attack\n   may not be noticeable\
    \ early enough at the link or IP layer to quickly\n   institute countermeasures.\
    \  The attack is therefore disruptive at a\n   minimum, and may potentially persist\
    \ until the mobile node initiates\n   signaling again upon a subsequent handoff.\n\
    \   Impersonation attacks can be prevented at the link layer,\n   particularly\
    \ with cellular technologies where the handoff signaling\n   between the mobile\
    \ node and the network must be authenticated and is\n   completely controlled\
    \ by the wireless link layer.  Cellular access\n   technologies provide a variety\
    \ of cryptographic and non-cryptographic\n   attack barriers at the link layer,\
    \ which makes mounting an\n   impersonation attack, both on-link and off-link,\
    \ very difficult.\n   However, for non-cellular technologies that do not require\
    \ link-layer\n   authentication and authorization during handoff, impersonation\n\
    \   attacks may be possible.\n   An attacker that can forge handoff signaling\
    \ may also cause denial of\n   service against the localized mobility management\
    \ domain.  The\n   attacker can trick a MAG into believing that a large number\
    \ of mobile\n   nodes have attached to the local access link and thus induce it\
    \ to\n   initiate route update signaling with an LMA for each mobile node\n  \
    \ assumed on link.  The result of such an attack is both superfluous\n   signaling\
    \ overhead on the control plane as well as a high number of\n   needless entries\
    \ in the LMA's and MAG's routing tables.  The\n   unexpected growth of the routing\
    \ tables may eventually cause the LMA\n   to reject legitimate route update requests,\
    \ and it may cause the MAG\n   to ignore handoffs of legitimate mobile nodes onto\
    \ its local access\n   link.  It may also decrease the LMA's and MAG's forwarding\
    \ speed for\n   inbound and outbound data plane packets due to higher route lookup\n\
    \   latencies, and it may for the same reason slow down their\n   responsiveness\
    \ to control plane packets.  An adverse side effect of\n   this attack is that\
    \ the LMA, and hence the localized mobility\n   management domain as a whole,\
    \ becomes more susceptible to flooding\n   packets from external attackers (see\
    \ Section 4).  The high number of\n   superfluous routes increases the probability\
    \ that a flooding packet,\n   sent to a random IP address within the localized\
    \ mobility management\n   domain, matches an existing routing table entry at the\
    \ LMA and gets\n   tunneled to a MAG, which in turn performs address resolution\
    \ on the\n   local access link.  At the same time, fewer flooding packets can\
    \ be\n   dropped directly at the LMA on the basis of a nonexistent routing\n \
    \  table entry.\n   A threat related to the ones identified above, but not limited\
    \ to\n   handoff signaling, is IP spoofing [6].  Attackers use IP spoofing\n \
    \  mostly for reflection attacks or to hide their identities.  The\n   threat\
    \ can be reasonably contained by a wide deployment of network\n   ingress filtering\
    \ [7] in routers, especially within access networks.\n   This technique prevents\
    \ IP spoofing to the extent that it ensures\n   topological correctness of IP\
    \ source address prefixes in to-be-\n   forwarded packets.  Where the technique\
    \ is deployed in an access\n   router, packets are forwarded only if the prefix\
    \ of their IP source\n   address is valid on the router's local access link. \
    \ An attacker can\n   still use a false interface identifier in combination with\
    \ an on-link\n   prefix.  But since reflection attacks typically aim at off-link\n\
    \   targets, and the enforcement of topologically correct IP address\n   prefixes\
    \ also limits the effectiveness of identity concealment,\n   network ingress filtering\
    \ has proven adequate so far.  On the other\n   hand, prefixes are not limited\
    \ to a specific link in a localized\n   mobility management domain, so merely\
    \ ensuring topological\n   correctness through ingress filtering becomes insufficient.\
    \  An\n   additional mechanism for IP address ownership verification is\n   necessary\
    \ to prevent an attacker from sending packets with an off-\n   link IP source\
    \ address.\n"

    \ by sending\n   packets to arbitrary IP addresses that are potentially in use\
    \ by\n   mobile nodes within the localized mobility management domain.  Like a\n\
    \   border router, the LMA is in a topological position through which a\n   substantial\
    \ amount of data plane traffic goes, so it must process the\n   flooding packets\
    \ and perform a routing table lookup for each of them.\n   The LMA can discard\
    \ packets for which the IP destination address is\n   not registered in its routing\
    \ table.  But other packets must be\n   encapsulated and forwarded.  A target\
    \ MAG as well as any mobile nodes\n   attached to that MAG's local access link\
    \ are also likely to suffer\n   damage because the unrequested packets must be\
    \ decapsulated and\n   consume link bandwidth as well as processing capacities\
    \ on the\n   receivers.  This threat is in principle the same as for denial of\n\
    \   service on a regular IPv6 border router, but because the routing\n   table\
    \ lookups may enable the LMA to drop part of the flooding packets\n   early on\
    \ or, on the contrary, additional tunneling workload is\n   required for packets\
    \ that cannot be dropped, the impact of an attack\n   against localized mobility\
    \ management may be different.\n   In a related attack, the attacker manages to\
    \ obtain a globally\n   routable IP address of an LMA or a different network entity\
    \ within\n   the localized mobility management domain and perpetrates a denial-of-\n\
    \   service attack against that IP address.  Localized mobility\n   management\
    \ is, in general, somewhat resistant to such an attack\n   because mobile nodes\
    \ need never obtain a globally routable IP address\n   of any entity within the\
    \ localized mobility management domain.\n   Hence, a compromised mobile node cannot\
    \ pass such an IP address off\n   to a remote attacker, limiting the feasibility\
    \ of extracting\n   information on the topology of the localized mobility management\n\
    \   domain.  It is still possible for an attacker to perform IP address\n   scanning\
    \ if MAGs and LMAs have globally routable IP addresses, but\n   the much larger\
    \ IPv6 address space makes scanning considerably more\n   time consuming.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes threats to network-based\
    \ localized mobility\n   management.  These may either occur on the interface\
    \ between an LMA\n   and a MAG, or on the interface between a MAG and a mobile\
    \ node.\n   Mitigation measures for the threats, as well as the security\n   considerations\
    \ associated with those measures, are described in the\n   respective protocol\
    \ specifications [3][8] for the two interfaces.\n"
