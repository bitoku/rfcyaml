  - "Abstract\n   This document defines extensions to BGP-4 to enable it to carry\n
    \  routing information for multiple Network Layer protocols (e.g., IPv6,\n   IPX,
    L3VPN, etc.).  The extensions are backward compatible - a router\n   that supports
    the extensions can interoperate with a router that\n   doesn't support the extensions.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The only three pieces of information carried by BGP-4 [BGP-4]
    that\n   are IPv4 specific are (a) the NEXT_HOP attribute (expressed as an\n   IPv4
    address), (b) AGGREGATOR (contains an IPv4 address), and (c)\n   NLRI (expressed
    as IPv4 address prefixes).  This document assumes\n   that any BGP speaker (including
    the one that supports multiprotocol\n   capabilities defined in this document)
    has to have an IPv4 address\n   (which will be used, among other things, in the
    AGGREGATOR\n   attribute).  Therefore, to enable BGP-4 to support routing for\n
    \  multiple Network Layer protocols, the only two things that have to be\n   added
    to BGP-4 are (a) the ability to associate a particular Network\n   Layer protocol
    with the next hop information, and (b) the ability to\n   associate a particular
    Network Layer protocol with NLRI.  To identify\n   individual Network Layer protocols
    associated with the next hop\n   information and semantics of NLRI, this document
    uses a combination\n   of Address Family, as defined in [IANA-AF], and Subsequent
    Address\n   Family (as described in this document).\n   One could further observe
    that the next hop information (the\n   information provided by the NEXT_HOP attribute)
    is meaningful (and\n   necessary) only in conjunction with the advertisements
    of reachable\n   destinations - in conjunction with the advertisements of unreachable\n
    \  destinations (withdrawing routes from service), the next hop\n   information
    is meaningless.  This suggests that the advertisement of\n   reachable destinations
    should be grouped with the advertisement of\n   the next hop to be used for these
    destinations, and that the\n   advertisement of reachable destinations should
    be segregated from the\n   advertisement of unreachable destinations.\n   To provide
    backward compatibility, as well as to simplify\n   introduction of the multiprotocol
    capabilities into BGP-4, this\n   document uses two new attributes, Multiprotocol
    Reachable NLRI\n   (MP_REACH_NLRI) and Multiprotocol Unreachable NLRI (MP_UNREACH_NLRI).\n
    \  The first one (MP_REACH_NLRI) is used to carry the set of reachable\n   destinations
    together with the next hop information to be used for\n   forwarding to these
    destinations.  The second one (MP_UNREACH_NLRI)\n   is used to carry the set of
    unreachable destinations.  Both of these\n   attributes are optional and non-transitive.
    \ This way, a BGP speaker\n   that doesn't support the multiprotocol capabilities
    will just ignore\n   the information carried in these attributes and will not
    pass it to\n   other BGP speakers.\n"

    \  (a) to advertise a feasible route to a peer\n   (b) to permit a router to advertise
    the Network Layer address of the\n       router that should be used as the next
    hop to the destinations\n       listed in the Network Layer Reachability Information
    field of the\n       MP_NLRI attribute.\n   The attribute is encoded as shown

    \        Identifier field identifies the set of Network Layer protocols\n         to
    which the address carried in the Next Hop field must belong,\n         the way
    in which the address of the next hop is encoded, and\n         the semantics of
    the Network Layer Reachability Information\n         that follows.  If the Next
    Hop is allowed to be from more than\n         one Network Layer protocol, the

    Layer protocol.\n         Presently defined values for the Address Family Identifier\n

    Next Hop must belong, the way in\n         which the address of the next hop is

    Address:\n         A 1-octet field whose value expresses the length of the\n         \"Network

    Hop:\n         A variable-length field that contains the Network Address of\n
    \        the next router on the path to the destination system.  The\n         Network
    Layer protocol associated with the Network Address of\n         the Next Hop is
    identified by a combination of <AFI, SAFI>\n         carried in the attribute.\n
    \     Reserved:\n         A 1 octet field that MUST be set to 0, and SHOULD be

    information carried in the MP_REACH_NLRI path attribute\n   defines the Network
    Layer address of the router that SHOULD be used\n   as the next hop to the destinations
    listed in the MP_NLRI attribute\n   in the UPDATE message.\n   The rules for the
    next hop information are the same as the rules for\n   the information carried
    in the NEXT_HOP BGP attribute (see Section\n   5.1.3 of [BGP-4]).\n   An UPDATE
    message that carries the MP_REACH_NLRI MUST also carry the\n   ORIGIN and the
    AS_PATH attributes (both in EBGP and in IBGP\n   exchanges).  Moreover, in IBGP
    exchanges such a message MUST also\n   carry the LOCAL_PREF attribute.\n   An
    UPDATE message that carries no NLRI, other than the one encoded in\n   the MP_REACH_NLRI
    attribute, SHOULD NOT carry the NEXT_HOP attribute.\n   If such a message contains
    the NEXT_HOP attribute, the BGP speaker\n   that receives the message SHOULD ignore
    this attribute.\n   An UPDATE message SHOULD NOT include the same address prefix
    (of the\n   same <AFI, SAFI>) in more than one of the following fields: WITHDRAWN\n
    \  ROUTES field, Network Reachability Information fields, MP_REACH_NLRI\n   field,
    and MP_UNREACH_NLRI field.  The processing of an UPDATE\n   message in this form
