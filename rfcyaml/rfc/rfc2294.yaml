  - "1  The O/R Address Hierarchy\n   An O/R Address hierarchy is represented in the
    X.500 directory by\n   associating directory name components with O/R Address
    components.\n   An example of this is given in Figure 1.  The object classes and\n
    \  attributes required to support this representation are defined in\n   Figure
    2.  The schema, which defines the hierarchy in which these\n   objects are represented
    in the directory information tree is\n   specified in Table 1.  A given object
    class defined in the table will\n   always be higher in the DIT than an object
    class defined lower down\n   the table.  Valid combinations of O/R Address components
    are defined\n   in X.400.\n                                  /\\\n                                 /

    \                   Figure 2:  O/R Address Hierarchy\n   The hierarchy is defined
    so that:\n   1.  The representation is defined so that it is straightforward to\n
    \      make a mechanical transformation in either direction.  This\n       requires
    that each node is named by an attribute whose type can\n       determine the mapping.\n
    \  2.  Where there are multiple domain defined attributes, the first\n       in
    the sequence is the most significant.\n   3.  Physical Delivery (postal) addresses
    are not represented in\n       this hierarchy.  This is primarily because physical
    delivery can\n       be handled by the Access Unit routing mechanisms defined
    in [4],\n       and there is no need for this representation.\n   4.  Terminal
    and network forms of address are not handled, except\n       for X.121 form, which
    is useful for addressing faxes.\n   5.  MHSCountry is defined as a subclass of
    Country, and so the\n       same entry will be used for MHS Routing as for the
    rest of the\n       DIT.\n   6.  The numeric country code will be an alias.\n
    \  7.  ADMD will always be present in the hierarchy.  This is true\n       in
    the case of \" \" and of \"0\".  This facilitates an easy\n       mechanical transformation
    between the two forms of address.\n   8.  Each node is named by the relevant part
    of the O/R Address.\n   9.  Aliases may be used in other parts of the tree, in
    order to\n       normalize alternate values.  Where an alias is used, the value
    of\n       the alias should be present as an alternate value in the node\n       aliased
    to.  Aliases may not be used for domain defined\n       attributes.\n   10. Domain
    Defined Attributes are named by a multi-valued RDN\n       (Relative Distinguished
    Name), consisting of the type and value.\n       This is done so that standard
    attribute syntaxes can be used.\n   11. Where an O/R Address has a valid Printable
    String and T.61 form,\n       both must be present, with one as an alias for the
    other.  This\n       is so that direct lookup of the name will work, independent
    of\n       the variant used.  When both are present in an O/R Address being\n
    \      looked up, either may be used to construct the distinguished\n       name.\n
    \  12. Personal name is handled by use of the mHSPerson object class.\n       Each
    of the components of the personal name will be present in\n       the relative
    distinguished name, which will usually be multi-\n       valued.\n   The relationship
    between X.400 O/R Addresses and the X.400 Entries\n   (Attribute Type and Object
    Class) are given in Table 2.  Where there\n   are multiple Organizational Units
    or Domain Defined Attributes, each\n   component is mapped onto a single X.500
    entry.\n   Note: When an X.121 address is used for addressing fax transmission,\n
    \      this may only be done relative to the PRMD or ADMD. This is in\n       line
    with the current X.400 standards position.  This means that\n       it is not
    possible to use this form of addressing for an\n       organizational or departmental
    fax gateway service.\n"

  - "4  Mapping from O/R Address to Directory Name\n   The primary application of
    this mapping is to take an X.400 encoded\n   O/R Address and to generate an equivalent
    directory name.  This\n   mapping is only used for selected types of O/R Address:\n
    \   o  Mnemonic form\n    o  Numeric form\n    o  Terminal form, where country
    is present and X121 addressing\n       is used\n   Other forms of O/R address
    are handled by Access Unit mechanisms.\n   The O/R Address is treated as an ordered
    list, with the order as\n   defined in Table 1.  For each O/R Address attribute,
    generate the\n   equivalent directory naming attribute.  In most cases, the mapping
    is\n   mechanical.  Printable String or Teletex encodings are chosen as\n   appropriate.
    \ Where both forms are present in the O/R Address, either\n   form may be used
    to generate the distinguished name.  Both will be\n   represented in the DIT.
    There are two special cases:\n   1.  A DDA generates a multi-valued RDN\n   2.
    \ The Personal Name is mapped to a multi-valued RDN\n   In many cases, an O/R
    Address will be provided, and only the higher\n   components of the address will
    be represented in the DIT. In this\n   case, the \"longest possible match\" should
    be returned.\n"
