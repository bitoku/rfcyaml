  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPv6 deployment in 3GPP mobile networks is the only viable\
    \ solution\n   to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses in those networks.  Several\n\
    \   mobile operators have already deployed IPv6 [RFC2460] or are in the\n   pre-deployment\
    \ phase.  One of the major hurdles as perceived by some\n   mobile operators is\
    \ the lack of availability of working IPv6\n   implementation in mobile devices\
    \ (e.g., Section 3.3 of [OECD]).\n   [RFC7066] lists a set of features to be supported\
    \ by cellular hosts\n   to connect to 3GPP mobile networks.  In the light of recent\
    \ IPv6\n   production deployments, additional features to facilitate IPv6-only\n\
    \   deployments while accessing IPv4-only services should be considered.\n   This\
    \ document fills this void.  Concretely, this document lists means\n   to ensure\
    \ IPv4 service over an IPv6-only connectivity given the\n   adoption rate of this\
    \ model by mobile operators.  Those operators\n   require that no service degradation\
    \ is experienced by customers\n   serviced with an IPv6-only model compared to\
    \ the level of service of\n   customers with legacy IPv4-only devices.\n   This\
    \ document defines an IPv6 profile for mobile devices listing\n   specifications\
    \ produced by various Standards Developing Organizations\n   (including 3GPP,\
    \ IETF, and the Global System for Mobile\n   Communications Association (GSMA)).\
    \  The objectives of this effort\n   are as follows:\n   1.  List in one single\
    \ document a comprehensive list of IPv6 features\n       for a mobile device,\
    \ including both IPv6-only and dual-stack\n       mobile deployment contexts.\
    \  These features cover various packet\n       core architectures such as General\
    \ Packet Radio Service (GPRS) or\n       Evolved Packet Core (EPC).\n   2.  Help\
    \ operators with the detailed device requirement list\n       preparation (to\
    \ be exchanged with device suppliers).  This is\n       also a contribution to\
    \ harmonize operators' requirements towards\n       device vendors.\n   3.  Inform\
    \ vendors of a set of features to allow for IPv6\n       connectivity and IPv4\
    \ service continuity (over an IPv6-only\n       transport).\n   The recommendations\
    \ do not include 3GPP release details.  For more\n   information on the 3GPP release\
    \ details, the reader may refer to\n   Section 6.2 of [RFC6459].  More details\
    \ can be found at [R3GPP].\n   Some of the features listed in this profile document\
    \ could require\n   that dedicated functions be activated at the network side.\
    \  It is out\n   of scope of this document to list these network-side functions.\n\
    \   A detailed overview of IPv6 support in 3GPP architectures is provided\n  \
    \ in [RFC6459].  IPv6-only considerations in mobile networks are\n   further discussed\
    \ in [RFC6342].\n   This document is organized as follows:\n   o  Section 2 lists\
    \ generic recommendations, including functionalities\n      to provide IPv4 service\
    \ over an IPv6-only connectivity.\n   o  Section 3 enumerates a set of recommendations\
    \ for cellular devices\n      with Local Area Network (LAN) capabilities (e.g.,\
    \ Customer Edge\n      (CE) routers with cellular access link, dongles with tethering\n\
    \      features).\n   o  Section 4 identifies a set of advanced recommendations\
    \ to fulfill\n      requirements of critical services such as VoLTE (Voice over\
    \ LTE).\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC6459].\
    \  In\n   addition, the following terms are used:\n   o  3GPP cellular host (or\
    \ \"cellular host\" for short): denotes a 3GPP\n      device that can be connected\
    \ to 3GPP mobile networks.\n   o  3GPP cellular device (or \"cellular device\"\
    \ for short): refers to a\n      cellular host that supports the capability to\
    \ share its 3GPP\n      mobile connectivity.\n   o  IPv4 service continuity: denotes\
    \ the features used to provide\n      access to IPv4-only services to customers\
    \ serviced with an\n      IPv6-only connectivity.  A typical example of IPv4 service\n\
    \      continuity technique is Network Address and Protocol Translation\n    \
    \  from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64) [RFC6146].\n   PREFIX64 denotes an\
    \ IPv6 prefix used to build IPv4-converted IPv6\n   addresses [RFC6052].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Scope\n   A 3GPP mobile network can be used to connect various User Equipment\n\
    \   (UE) such as a mobile telephone or a CE router.  Because of this\n   diversity\
    \ of terminals, it is necessary to define a set of IPv6\n   functionalities valid\
    \ for any node directly connecting to a 3GPP\n   mobile network.  This document\
    \ describes these functionalities.\n   The machine-to-machine (M2M) devices profile\
    \ is out of scope.\n   This document is structured to provide the generic IPv6\n\
    \   recommendations that are valid for all nodes, whatever their function\n  \
    \ (e.g., host or CE router) or service (e.g., Session Initiation\n   Protocol\
    \ (SIP) [RFC3261]) capability.  The document also contains\n   sections covering\
    \ specific functionalities for devices providing some\n   LAN functions (e.g.,\
    \ mobile CE router or broadband dongles).\n   The recommendations listed below\
    \ are valid for both 3GPP GPRS and\n   3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS).  For\
    \ EPS, the term \"PDN-Connection\"\n   is used instead of PDP-Context.  Other\
    \ non-3GPP accesses [TS.23402]\n   are out of scope of this document.\n   This\
    \ profile is a superset of that of the IPv6 profile for 3GPP\n   Cellular Hosts\
    \ [RFC7066], which is in turn a superset of IPv6 Node\n   Requirements [RFC6434].\
    \  It targets cellular nodes, including GPRS\n   and EPC, that require features\
    \ to ensure IPv4 service delivery over\n   an IPv6-only transport in addition\
    \ to the base IPv6 service.\n   Moreover, this profile also covers cellular CE\
    \ routers that are used\n   in various mobile broadband deployments.  Recommendations\
    \ inspired\n   from real deployment experiences (e.g., roaming) are included in\
    \ this\n   profile.  Also, this profile sketches recommendations for the sake\
    \ of\n   deterministic behaviors of cellular devices when the same\n   configuration\
    \ information is received over several channels.\n   For conflicting recommendations\
    \ in [RFC7066] and [RFC6434] (e.g.,\n   Neighbor Discovery Protocol), this profile\
    \ adheres to [RFC7066].\n   Indeed, the support of Neighbor Discovery Protocol\
    \ is mandatory in\n   3GPP cellular environment as it is the only way to convey\
    \ an IPv6\n   prefix towards the 3GPP cellular device.  In particular, Maximum\n\
    \   Transmission Unit (MTU) communication via Router Advertisement (RA)\n   must\
    \ be supported since many 3GPP networks do not have a standard MTU\n   setting.\n\
    \   This profile uses a stronger language for the support of Prefix\n   Delegation\
    \ compared to [RFC7066].  The main motivation is that\n   cellular networks are\
    \ more and more perceived as an alternative to\n   fixed networks for home IP-based\
    \ services delivery; especially with\n   the advent of smartphones and 3GPP data\
    \ dongles.  There is a need for\n   an efficient mechanism to assign larger prefixes\
    \ to cellular hosts so\n   that each LAN segment can get its own /64 prefix and\
    \ multi-link\n   subnet issues to be avoided.  The support of this functionality\
    \ in\n   both cellular and fixed networks is key for fixed-mobile convergence.\n\
    \   The use of address-family-dependent Application Programming\n   Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) or hard-coded IPv4 address literals may lead to\n   broken applications\
    \ when IPv6 connectivity is in use.  As such, means\n   to minimize broken applications\
    \ when the cellular host is attached to\n   an IPv6-only network should be encouraged.\
    \  Particularly, (1) name\n   resolution libraries (e.g., [RFC3596]) must support\
    \ both IPv4 and\n   IPv6; (2) applications must be independent of the underlying\
    \ IP\n   address family; and (3) applications relying upon Uniform Resource\n\
    \   Identifiers (URIs) must follow [RFC3986] and its updates.  Note, some\n  \
    \ IETF specifications (e.g., SIP [RFC3261]) contains broken IPv6\n   Augmented\
    \ Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) and rules to compare URIs with\n   embedded IPv6 addresses;\
    \ fixes (e.g., [RFC5954]) must be used\n   instead.\n   The recommendations included\
    \ in each section are listed in a priority\n   order.\n   This document is not\
    \ a standard, and conformance with it is not\n   required in order to claim conformance\
    \ with IETF standards for IPv6.\n   Compliance with this profile does not require\
    \ the support of all\n   enclosed items.  Obviously, the support of the full set\
    \ of features\n   may not be required in some deployment contexts.  However, the\n\
    \   authors believe that not supporting relevant features included in\n   this\
    \ profile (e.g., Customer-Side Translator (CLAT) [RFC6877]) may\n   lead to a\
    \ degraded level of service.\n"
- title: 2.  Connectivity Recommendations
  contents:
  - "2.  Connectivity Recommendations\n   This section identifies the main connectivity\
    \ recommendations to be\n   followed by a cellular host to attach to a network\
    \ using IPv6 in\n   addition to what is defined in [RFC6434] and [RFC7066].  Both\
    \ dual-\n   stack and IPv6-only deployment models are considered.  IPv4 service\n\
    \   continuity features are listed in this section because these are\n   critical\
    \ for operators with an IPv6-only deployment model.  These\n   recommendations\
    \ apply also for cellular devices (see Section 3).\n   C_REC#1:  In order to allow\
    \ each operator to select their own\n             strategy regarding IPv6 introduction,\
    \ the cellular host\n             must support both IPv6 and IPv4v6 PDP-Contexts\
    \ [TS.23060].\n             IPv4, IPv6, or IPv4v6 PDP-Context request acceptance\n\
    \             depends on the cellular network configuration.\n   C_REC#2:  The\
    \ cellular host must comply with the behavior defined in\n             [TS.23060],\
    \ [TS.23401], and [TS.24008] for requesting a\n             PDP-Context type.\n\
    \             In particular, the cellular host must request by default an\n  \
    \           IPv6 PDP-Context if the cellular host is IPv6-only and\n         \
    \    request an IPv4v6 PDP-Context if the cellular host is dual-\n           \
    \  stack or when the cellular host is not aware of\n             connectivity\
    \ types requested by devices connected to it\n             (e.g., a cellular host\
    \ with LAN capabilities as discussed\n             in Section 3):\n          \
    \   *  If the requested IPv4v6 PDP-Context is not supported by\n             \
    \   the network but IPv4 and IPv6 PDP types are allowed,\n                then\
    \ the cellular host will be configured with an IPv4\n                address or\
    \ an IPv6 prefix by the network.  It must\n                initiate another PDP-Context\
    \ activation of the other\n                address family in addition to the one\
    \ already activated\n                for a given Access Point Name (APN).  The\
    \ purpose of\n                initiating a second PDP-Context is to achieve dual-stack\n\
    \                connectivity by means of two PDP-Contexts.\n             *  If\
    \ the subscription data or network configuration allows\n                only\
    \ one IP address family (IPv4 or IPv6), the cellular\n                host must\
    \ not request a second PDP-Context to the same\n                APN for the other\
    \ IP address family.\n             The network informs the cellular host about\
    \ allowed Packet\n             Data Protocol (PDP) types by means of Session Management\n\
    \             (SM) cause codes.  In particular, the following cause codes\n  \
    \           can be returned:\n             *  cause #50 \"PDP type IPv4 only allowed\"\
    \ - This cause code\n                is used by the network to indicate that only\
    \ PDP type\n                IPv4 is allowed for the requested Public Data Network\n\
    \                (PDN) connectivity.\n             *  cause #51 \"PDP type IPv6\
    \ only allowed\" - This cause code\n                is used by the network to\
    \ indicate that only PDP type\n                IPv6 is allowed for the requested\
    \ PDN connectivity.\n             *  cause #52 \"single address bearers only allowed\"\
    \ - This\n                cause code is used by the network to indicate that the\n\
    \                requested PDN connectivity is accepted with the\n           \
    \     restriction that only single IP version bearers are\n                allowed.\n\
    \             The text above focuses on the specification (an excerpt\n      \
    \       from [TS.23060], [TS.23401], and [TS.24008]) that explains\n         \
    \    the behavior for requesting IPv6-related PDP-Context(s).\n   C_REC#3:  The\
    \ cellular host must support the Protocol Configuration\n             Options\
    \ (PCOs) [TS.24008] to retrieve the IPv6 address(es)\n             of the Recursive\
    \ DNS server(s).\n                The 3GPP network communicates parameters by\
    \ means of the\n                protocol configuration options information element\
    \ when\n                activating, modifying, or deactivating a PDP-Context.\n\
    \                PCO is a convenient method to inform the cellular host\n    \
    \            about various services, including DNS server\n                information.\
    \  It does not require additional protocol to\n                be supported by\
    \ the cellular host and it is already\n                deployed in IPv4 cellular\
    \ networks to convey such DNS\n                information.\n   C_REC#4:  The\
    \ cellular host must support IPv6-aware Traffic Flow\n             Templates (TFTs)\
    \ [TS.24008].\n                Traffic Flow Templates are employing a packet filter\
    \ to\n                couple an IP traffic with a PDP-Context.  Thus, a\n    \
    \            dedicated PDP-Context and radio resources can be\n              \
    \  provided by the cellular network for certain IP traffic.\n   C_REC#5:  If the\
    \ cellular host receives the DNS information in\n             several channels\
    \ for the same interface, the following\n             preference order must be\
    \ followed:\n                1.  PCO\n                2.  RA\n               \
    \ 3.  DHCPv6\n             The purpose of this recommendation is to guarantee\
    \ for a\n             deterministic behavior to be followed by all cellular hosts\n\
    \             when the DNS information is received in various channels.\n   C_REC#6:\
    \  Because of potential operational deficiencies to be\n             experienced\
    \ in some roaming situations, the cellular host\n             must be able to\
    \ be configured with a home PDP-Context\n             type(s) and a roaming PDP-Context\
    \ type(s).  The purpose of\n             the roaming profile is to limit the PDP\
    \ type(s) requested\n             by the cellular host when out of the home network.\
    \  Note\n             that distinct PDP type(s) and APN(s) can be configured for\n\
    \             home and roaming cases.\n                A detailed analysis of\
    \ roaming failure cases is included\n                in [RFC7445].\n         \
    \       The configuration can be either local to the device or\n             \
    \   be managed dynamically using, for example, Open Mobile\n                Alliance\
    \ (OMA) management.  The support of dynamic means\n                is encouraged.\n\
    \   C_REC#7:  In order to ensure IPv4 service continuity in an IPv6-only\n   \
    \          deployment context, the cellular host should support a\n          \
    \   method to learn PREFIX64(s).\n                In the context of NAT64, IPv6-enabled\
    \ applications\n                relying on address referrals will fail because\
    \ an\n                IPv6-only client will not be able to make use of an IPv4\n\
    \                address received in a referral.  This feature allows for\n  \
    \              solving the referral problem (because an IPv6-enabled\n       \
    \         application can construct IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses\n           \
    \     [RFC6052]) and, also, for distinguishing between\n                IPv4-converted\
    \ IPv6 addresses and native IPv6 addresses.\n                In other words, this\
    \ feature contributes to offload both\n                the CLAT module and NAT64\
    \ devices.  Refer to Section 3\n                of [RFC7051] for an inventory\
    \ of the issues related to\n                the discovery of PREFIX64(s).\n  \
    \              In environments based on the Port Control Protocol\n          \
    \      (PCP), cellular hosts should follow [RFC7225] to learn\n              \
    \  the IPv6 Prefix used by an upstream PCP-controlled NAT64\n                device.\
    \  If PCP is not enabled, the cellular host should\n                implement\
    \ the method specified in [RFC7050] to retrieve\n                the PREFIX64.\n\
    \   C_REC#8:  In order to ensure IPv4 service continuity in an IPv6-only\n   \
    \          deployment context, the cellular host should implement the\n      \
    \       CLAT [RFC6877] function in compliance with [RFC6052],\n             [RFC6145],\
    \ and [RFC6146].\n                The CLAT function in the cellular host allows\
    \ for\n                IPv4-only application and IPv4 referrals to work on an\n\
    \                IPv6-only connectivity.  The more applications are\n        \
    \        address family independent, the less the CLAT function\n            \
    \    is solicited.  The CLAT function requires a NAT64\n                capability\
    \ [RFC6146] in the network.\n                The cellular host should only invoke\
    \ CLAT in the absence\n                of IPv4 connectivity on the cellular side,\
    \ i.e., when\n                the network does not assign an IPv4 address on the\n\
    \                cellular interface.  Note, NAT64 assumes an IPv6-only\n     \
    \           mode [RFC6146].\n                The IPv4 Service Continuity Prefix\
    \ used by CLAT is\n                defined in [RFC7335].\n                CLAT\
    \ and/or NAT64 do not interfere with native IPv6\n                communications.\n\
    \                CLAT may not be required in some contexts, e.g., if\n       \
    \         other solutions such as Bump-in-the-Host (BIH) [RFC6535]\n         \
    \       are supported.\n                The cellular device can act as a CE router\
    \ connecting\n                various IP hosts on a LAN segment; this is also\
    \ the case\n                with using WLAN (Wireless LAN) tethering or a WLAN\n\
    \                hotspot from the cellular device.  Some of these IP\n       \
    \         hosts can be dual-stack, others are IPv6-only or\n                IPv4-only.\
    \  IPv6-only connectivity on the cellular\n                device does not allow\

    \ the LAN segment of\n                the cellular device.  IPv4 session establishment\n\
    \                initiated from hosts located on the LAN segment side and\n  \
    \              destined for IPv4 nodes must be maintained.  A solution\n     \
    \           is to integrate the CLAT function to the LAN segment in\n        \
    \        the cellular device.\n   C_REC#9:  The cellular host may be able to be\

    \ mode is to allow all\n             supported PDP types.  Note, C_REC#2 discusses\
    \ the default\n             behavior for requesting PDP-Context type(s).\n   \
    \             This feature is useful to drive the behavior of the UE\n       \
    \         to be aligned with (1) service-specific constraints such\n         \
    \       as the use of IPv6-only for VoLTE, (2) network\n                conditions\
    \ with regard to the support of specific PDP\n                types (e.g., IPv4v6\

    \ (4) subscription data, etc.\n                Note, a cellular host changing\
    \ its connection between an\n                IPv6-specific APN and an IPv4-specific\
    \ APN will\n                interrupt related network connections.  This may be\n\
    \                considered as a brokenness situation by some\n              \
    \  applications.\n                The configuration can be either local to the\

  - "3.  Recommendations for Cellular Devices with LAN Capabilities\n   This section\
    \ focuses on cellular devices (e.g., CE routers,\n   smartphones, or dongles with\
    \ tethering features) that provide IP\n   connectivity to other devices connected\
    \ to them.  In this case, all\n   connected devices are sharing the same 2G, 3G,\
    \ or LTE connection.  In\n   addition to the generic recommendations listed in\
    \ Section 2, these\n   cellular devices have to meet the recommendations listed\
    \ below.\n   L_REC#1:  For deployments that require that the same /64 prefix be\n\
    \             shared, the cellular device should support [RFC7278] to\n      \
    \       enable sharing a /64 prefix between the LAN and the WAN\n            \
    \ interfaces.  The WAN interface is the one towards the\n             Gateway\
    \ GPRS Support Node (GGSN) / Packet Data Network\n             Gateway (PGW).\n\
    \                Prefix Delegation (refer to L_REC#2) is the target\n        \
    \        solution for distributing prefixes in the LAN side but,\n           \
    \     because the device may attach to earlier 3GPP release\n                networks,\
    \ a means to share a /64 prefix is also\n                recommended [RFC7278].\n\
    \                [RFC7278] must be invoked only if Prefix Delegation is\n    \
    \            not in use.\n   L_REC#2:  The cellular device must support Prefix\
    \ Delegation\n             capabilities [RFC3633] and must support the Prefix\
    \ Exclude\n             Option for DHCPv6-based Prefix Delegation as defined in\n\
    \             [RFC6603].  Particularly, it must behave as a Requesting\n     \
    \        Router.\n                Cellular networks are more and more perceived\
    \ as an\n                alternative to fixed broadband networks for home IP-\n\
    \                based services delivery; especially with the advent of\n    \
    \            smartphones and 3GPP data dongles.  There is a need for\n       \
    \         an efficient mechanism to assign larger prefixes (other\n          \
    \      than /64s) to cellular hosts so that each LAN segment\n               \
    \ can get its own /64 prefix and multi-link subnet issues\n                to\
    \ be avoided.\n                In case a prefix is delegated to a cellular host\
    \ using\n                DHCPv6, the cellular device will be configured with two\n\
    \                prefixes:\n                (1)  one for the 3GPP link allocated\
    \ using the Stateless\n                     Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)\
    \ mechanism and\n                (2)  another one delegated for LANs acquired\
    \ during the\n                     Prefix Delegation operation.\n            \
    \    Note that the 3GPP network architecture requires both\n                the\
    \ WAN and the delegated prefix to be aggregatable so\n                the subscriber\
    \ can be identified using a single prefix.\n                Without the Prefix\
    \ Exclude Option, the delegating router\n                (GGSN/PGW) will have\
    \ to ensure compliance with [RFC3633]\n                (e.g., halving the delegated\
    \ prefix and assigning the\n                WAN prefix out of the first half and\
    \ the prefix to be\n                delegated to the terminal from the second\
    \ half).\n                Because Prefix Delegation capabilities may not be\n\
    \                available in some attached networks, L_REC#1 is strongly\n  \
    \              recommended to accommodate early deployments.\n   L_REC#3:  The\
    \ cellular CE router must be compliant with the\n             requirements specified\
    \ in [RFC7084].\n                There are several deployments, particularly in\
    \ emerging\n                countries, that rely on mobile networks to provide\n\
    \                broadband services (e.g., customers are provided with\n     \
    \           mobile CE routers).\n                Note, this profile does not require\
    \ IPv4 service\n                continuity techniques listed in Section 4.4 of\
    \ [RFC7084]\n                because those are specific to fixed networks.  IPv4\n\
    \                service continuity techniques specific to the mobile\n      \
    \          networks are included in this profile.\n                This recommendation\
    \ does not apply to handsets with\n                tethering capabilities; it\
    \ is specific to cellular CE\n                routers in order to ensure the same\
    \ IPv6 functional\n                parity for both fixed and cellular CE routers.\
    \  Note,\n                modern CE routers are designed with advanced functions\n\
    \                such as link aggregation that consists in optimizing the\n  \
    \              network usage by aggregating the connectivity resources\n     \
    \           offered via various interfaces (e.g., Digital Subscriber\n       \
    \         Line (DSL), LTE, WLAN, etc.) or offloading the traffic\n           \
    \     via a subset of interfaces.  Ensuring IPv6 feature\n                parity\
    \ among these interface types is important for the\n                sake of specification\
    \ efficiency, service design\n                simplification, and validation effort\
    \ optimization.\n   L_REC#4:  If an RA MTU is advertised from the 3GPP network,\
    \ the\n             cellular device should send RAs to the downstream attached\n\
    \             LAN devices with the same MTU as seen on the mobile\n          \
    \   interface.\n                Receiving and relaying RA MTU values facilitates\
    \ a more\n                harmonious functioning of the mobile core network where\n\
    \                end nodes transmit packets that do not exceed the MTU\n     \
    \           size of the mobile network's tunnels that use the GPRS\n         \
    \       Tunneling Protocol (GTP).\n                [TS.23060] indicates providing\
    \ a link MTU value of 1358\n                octets to the 3GPP cellular device\
    \ will prevent the IP\n                layer fragmentation within the transport\
    \ network between\n                the cellular device and the GGSN/PGW.  More\

- title: 4.  Advanced Recommendations
  contents:
  - "4.  Advanced Recommendations\n   This section identifies a set of advanced recommendations\
    \ to fulfill\n   requirements of critical services such as VoLTE.  These\n   recommendations\
    \ apply for mobile hosts, including mobile devices.\n   A_REC#1:  The cellular\
    \ host must support the RObust Header\n             Compression (ROHC) RTP Profile\
    \ (0x0001) and the ROHC UDP\n             Profile (0x0002) for IPv6 [RFC5795].\
    \  Other ROHC profiles\n             may be supported.\n                Bandwidth\
    \ in cellular networks must be optimized as much\n                as possible.\
    \  ROHC provides a solution to reduce\n                bandwidth consumption and\
    \ to reduce the impact of having\n                bigger packet headers in IPv6\
    \ compared to IPv4.\n                The \"RTP/UDP/IP\" ROHC profile (0x0001)\
    \ to compress RTP\n                packets and the \"UDP/IP\" ROHC profile (0x0002)\
    \ to\n                compress Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)\n \
    \               packets are required for VoLTE by Section 4.1 of\n           \
    \     IR.92.7.0 [IR92].  Note, [IR92] indicates that the host\n              \
    \  must be able to apply the compression to packets that\n                are\
    \ carried over the voice-media-dedicated radio bearer.\n   A_REC#2:  The cellular\
    \ host should support PCP [RFC6887].\n                The support of PCP is seen\
    \ as a driver to save battery\n                consumption exacerbated by keep-alive\
    \ messages.  PCP\n                also gives the possibility of enabling incoming\n\
    \                connections to the cellular device.  Indeed, because\n      \
    \          several stateful devices may be deployed in wireless\n            \
    \    networks (e.g., NAT64 and/or IPv6 Firewalls), PCP can be\n              \
    \  used by the cellular host to control network-based NAT64\n                and\
    \ IPv6 Firewall functions that will reduce per-\n                application signaling\
    \ and save battery consumption.\n                According to [Power], the consumption\
    \ of a cellular\n                device with a keep-alive interval equal to 20\
    \ seconds\n                (which is the default value in [RFC3948], for example)\n\
    \                is 29 mA (2G) / 34 mA (3G).  This consumption is reduced\n  \
    \              to 16 mA (2G) / 24 mA (3G) when the interval is\n             \
    \   increased to 40 seconds, to 9.1 mA (2G) / 16 mA (3G) if\n                the\
    \ interval is equal to 150 seconds, and to 7.3 mA (2G)\n                / 14 mA\
    \ (3G) if the interval is equal to 180 seconds.\n                When no keep-alive\
    \ is issued, the consumption would be\n                5.2 mA (2G) / 6.1 mA (3G).\
    \  The impact of keepalive\n                messages would be more severe if multiple\
    \ applications\n                are issuing those messages (e.g., SIP, IPsec,\
    \ etc.).\n                Deploying PCP allows cellular hosts to manage protocols\n\
    \                that convey IP addresses and/or port numbers (see\n         \
    \       Section 2.2 of [RFC6889]) without requiring Application\n            \
    \    Level Gateways (ALGs) to be enabled at the network side\n               \
    \ (e.g., NAT64).  Avoiding soliciting ALGs makes it easier\n                to\
    \ develop a service without any adherence with the\n                underlying\
    \ transport network.\n   A_REC#3:  In order for host-based validation of DNS Security\n\
    \             Extensions (DNSSEC) to continue to function in an IPv6-only\n  \
    \           connectivity with NAT64 deployment context, the cellular\n       \
    \      host should embed a DNS64 function ([RFC6147]).\n                This is\
    \ called \"DNS64 in stub-resolver mode\" in\n                [RFC6147].\n    \
    \            As discussed in Section 5.5 of [RFC6147], a security-\n         \
    \       aware and validating host has to perform the DNS64\n                function\
    \ locally.\n                Because synthetic AAAA records cannot be successfully\n\
    \                validated in a host, learning the PREFIX64 used to\n        \
    \        construct IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses allows the use\n            \
    \    of DNSSEC [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035].  Means to\n                configure\
    \ or discover a PREFIX64 are required on the\n                cellular device\
    \ as discussed in C_REC#7.\n                [RFC7051] discusses why a security-aware\
    \ and validating\n                host has to perform the DNS64 function locally\
    \ and why\n                it has to be able to learn the proper PREFIX64(s).\n\
    \   A_REC#4:  When the cellular host is dual-stack connected (i.e.,\n        \
    \     configured with an IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix), it should\n          \
    \   support means to prefer a native IPv6 connection over a\n             connection\
    \ established through translation devices (e.g.,\n             NAT44 and NAT64).\n\
    \                When both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS servers are configured, a\n     \
    \           dual-stack host must first contact its IPv6 DNS server.\n        \
    \        This preference allows it to offload IPv4-only DNS\n                servers.\n\
    \                Cellular hosts should follow the procedure specified in\n   \
    \             [RFC6724] for source address selection.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations identified in [RFC7066]\
    \ and [RFC6459] are\n   to be taken into account.\n   In the case of cellular\
    \ CE routers, compliance with L_REC#3 entails\n   compliance with [RFC7084], which\
    \ in turn recommends compliance with\n   Recommended Simple Security Capabilities\
    \ in Customer Premises\n   Equipment (CPE) for Providing Residential IPv6 Internet\
    \ Service\n   [RFC6092].  Therefore, the security considerations in Section 6\
    \ of\n   [RFC6092] are relevant.  In particular, it bears repeating here that\n\
    \   the true impact of stateful filtering may be a reduction in security\n   and\
    \ that the IETF makes no statement, expressed or implied, as to\n   whether using\
    \ the capabilities described in any of these documents\n   ultimately improves\
    \ security for any individual users or for the\n   Internet community as a whole.\n\
    \   The cellular host must be able to generate IPv6 addresses that\n   preserve\
    \ privacy.  The activation of the privacy extension (e.g.,\n   using [RFC7217])\
    \ makes it more difficult to track a host over time\n   when compared to using\
    \ a permanent Interface Identifier.  Tracking a\n   host is still possible based\
    \ on the first 64 bits of the IPv6\n   address.  Means to prevent against such\
    \ tracking issues may be\n   enabled in the network side.  Note, privacy extensions\
    \ are required\n   by regulatory bodies in some countries.\n   Host-based validation\
    \ of DNSSEC is discussed in A_REC#3 (see\n   Section 4).\n"
