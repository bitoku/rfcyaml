- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the Internet\n\
    \   Architecture Board (IAB), and at-large IETF representatives to the\n   IETF\
    \ Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) are selected by a\n   \"Nominating\
    \ and Recall Committee\" (universally abbreviated as\n   \"NomCom\").  [RFC3777]\
    \ defines how the NomCom is selected, and the\n   processes it follows as it selects\
    \ candidates for these positions.\n   The NomCom is responsible for filling positions\
    \ across the breadth of\n   the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The NomCom\
    \ needs\n   relevant information about nominees being considered for these\n \
    \  positions, but current [RFC3777] requirements for confidentiality\n   limit\
    \ the ability of the NomCom to solicit that information.  The\n   process change\
    \ described in this document allows the NomCom to openly\n   solicit information\
    \ about nominees who are willing to be considered.\n"
- title: 2.  Current Rules on Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "2.  Current Rules on Confidentiality\n   [RFC3777] is the latest in a series\
    \ of revisions to the NomCom\n   process, and it describes the confidential nature\
    \ of NomCom\n   deliberations in Section 3, \"General\", bullet 6, which states:\n\
    \      All deliberations and supporting information that relates to\n      specific\
    \ nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are\n      confidential.\n  \
    \    The nominating committee and confirming body members will be\n      exposed\
    \ to confidential information as a result of their\n      deliberations, their\
    \ interactions with those they consult, and\n      from those who provide requested\
    \ supporting information.  All\n      members and all other participants are expected\
    \ to handle this\n      information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.\n\
    \      It is consistent with this rule for current nominating committee\n    \
    \  members who have served on prior nominating committees to advise\n      the\
    \ current committee on deliberations and results of the prior\n      committee,\
    \ as necessary and appropriate.\n"
- title: 3.  Problems with Existing Rules
  contents:
  - "3.  Problems with Existing Rules\n   There are two problems with existing practice\
    \ -- nominee lists aren't\n   as confidential as [RFC3777] would lead the reader\
    \ to believe, but\n   they aren't visible to the entire IETF community, either.\n\
    \   Since at least 1996, most NomComs have sent out a \"short list\" of\n   nominees\
    \ under consideration to a variety of audiences.  The target\n   audiences differ\
    \ from year to year, but have included members of\n   specific leadership bodies,\
    \ working group chairs in a specific area\n   (for IESG positions), all working\
    \ group chairs (for IAB and IAOC\n   positions), and all document authors.  The\
    \ combined target audience\n   for all short lists includes hundreds of recipients\
    \ -- recent NomComs\n   have sent out about 1500 requests for short list feedback.\n\
    \   This practice is unavoidable, because most NomCom members will not\n   have\
    \ personal experience with most nominees for most positions, but\n   it is periodically\
    \ challenged because it's not explicitly allowed as\n   an exception to the blanket\
    \ requirement for confidentiality.\n   In an attempt to maintain the required\
    \ level of confidentiality, past\n   NomComs have also included \"ringers\" (as\
    \ \"padding\") on the short list\n   -- nominees who are NOT under active consideration\
    \ for a specific\n   position.  Since anyone who sees the short list does not\
    \ know who the\n   ringers are, conscientious IETF participants also provide feedback\
    \ on\n   nominees who have already declined.  This is a waste of precious\n  \
    \ IETF-participant cycles, and there are widespread reports that strict\n   confidentiality\
    \ about which candidates are \"real\", and which are\n   included as \"padding\"\
    , is not successfully maintained in practice.\n   Even if confidentiality about\
    \ padding is maintained, the community is\n   aware that some nominees on the\
    \ short list aren't under active\n   consideration.  In some cases, people have\
    \ guessed incorrectly that\n   an actual nominee is part of the padding, and didn't\
    \ provide needed\n   feedback to the NomCom about a nominee who was actively being\n\
    \   considered.\n   We also note that the practice of disclosing a \"short list\"\
    \ penalizes\n   IETF participants who aren't members of one of the target audiences\n\
    \   being surveyed -- they have no way of knowing who is being\n   considered,\
    \ except for incumbent(s), and have little incentive to\n   provide feedback to\
    \ the NomCom on individuals who might not even be\n   nominees.\n"
- title: 4.  Asking the Entire Community for Feedback
  contents:
  - "4.  Asking the Entire Community for Feedback\n   NomComs are not required to\
    \ ask for community input at all, but at\n   the current IETF scale, many NomComs\
    \ do request community input,\n   because members do not have personal experience\
    \ with all nominees for\n   all positions under review.\n   We assume that asking\
    \ the larger community for feedback about these\n   nominees is preferable to\
    \ NomCom members without personal experience\n   simply deferring to the members\
    \ of the NomCom who do have personal\n   experience with specific nominees.\n\
    \   We assume that asking for feedback from the entire community is\n   preferable\
    \ to asking for feedback from large segments of the\n   community, while keeping\
    \ the rest of the community \"in the dark\".\n"
- title: 5.  Disclosing a Nominee List
  contents:
  - "5.  Disclosing a Nominee List\n   In proposing that a nominee list be disclosed\
    \ as part of the NomCom's\n   request for feedback from the community, we considered\
    \ three\n   possibilities:\n   1.  Asking for feedback on all nominees, whether\
    \ or not they are\n       willing to be considered.\n   2.  Asking for feedback\
    \ on all nominees who are willing to be\n       considered.\n   3.  Asking for\
    \ feedback on the nominees that the NomCom is seriously\n       considering (the\
    \ \"short list\").\n   Asking for feedback on nominees who are not willing to\
    \ be considered\n   is a waste of precious IETF-participant cycles, and may make\
    \ it less\n   likely that the NomCom would receive feedback on some nominees who\n\
    \   ARE willing to be considered.\n   Asking for feedback on all nominees who\
    \ are willing to be considered\n   allows the community to point out specific\
    \ strengths and weaknesses\n   of all willing nominees, and this feedback should\
    \ be useful to the\n   NomCom in deciding which nominees to seriously consider.\
    \  It also\n   allows the NomCom to receive feedback on nominees who might not\n\
    \   appear on a \"short list\" initially, in the event that a strong\n   nominee\
    \ is suddenly unwilling or unable to serve.\n   We also note that the list of\
    \ willing nominees will include\n   incumbents who are willing to be considered\
    \ for an additional term.\n"
- title: 6.  Updated Text from RFC 3777
  contents:
  - "6.  Updated Text from RFC 3777\n   At the end of the three paragraphs in [RFC3777],\
    \ Section 3,\n   \"General\", bullet 6, which are currently:\n      All deliberations\
    \ and supporting information that relates to\n      specific nominees, candidates,\
    \ and confirmed candidates are\n      confidential.\n      The nominating committee\
    \ and confirming body members will be\n      exposed to confidential information\
    \ as a result of their\n      deliberations, their interactions with those they\
    \ consult, and\n      from those who provide requested supporting information.\
    \  All\n      members and all other participants are expected to handle this\n\
    \      information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.\n      It is consistent\

    \ on prior nominating committees to advise\n      the current committee on deliberations\
    \ and results of the prior\n      committee, as necessary and appropriate.\n \
    \  add the following paragraphs:\n      The list of nominees willing to be considered\
    \ for positions under\n      review in the current NomCom cycle is not confidential.\
    \  The\n      NomCom may disclose a list of names of nominees who are willing\
    \ to\n      be considered for positions under review to the community, in\n  \
    \    order to obtain feedback from the community on these nominees.\n      The\
    \ list of nominees disclosed for a specific position should\n      contain only\
    \ the names of nominees who are willing to be\n      considered for the position\
    \ under review.\n      The NomCom may choose not to include some names in the\
    \ disclosed\n      list, at their discretion.\n      The NomCom may disclose an\
    \ updated list, at their discretion.  For\n      example, the NomCom might disclose\
    \ an updated list if the NomCom\n      identifies errors/omissions in a previously\
    \ disclosed version of\n      the disclosed list, or if the NomCom finds it necessary\
    \ to call\n      for additional nominees, and these nominees indicate a willingness\n\
    \      to be considered before the NomCom has completed its\n      deliberations.\n\
    \      Nominees may choose to ask people to provide feedback to the\n      NomCom,\
    \ but should not encourage any public statements of support.\n      NomComs should\
    \ consider nominee-encouraged lobbying and\n      campaigning to be unacceptable\
    \ behavior.\n      IETF community members are encouraged to provide feedback on\n\
    \      nominees to the NomCom, but should not post statements of support/\n  \
    \    non-support for nominees in any public forum.\n"

    \ discussions.  Thanks to\n   Leslie Daigle for providing this set of concerns\
    \ to the document\n   editor.\n   One concern is that nominees who are willing\
    \ to be considered if the\n   nominee list is not disclosed would not be willing\
    \ to be considered\n   if the nominee list is disclosed.  This reluctance might\
    \ be cultural,\n   the result of personal pride, or the result of the fear of\n\
    \   retribution for a nominee being considered as a replacement for the\n   nominee's\
    \ managing Area Director (this concern is usually raised in\n   an IESG context).\n\
    \   Another concern is that publishing the nominee list publicly would\n   lead\
    \ to \"lobbying\", public statements supporting nominees on the IETF\n   mailing\
    \ list, etc.\n"
