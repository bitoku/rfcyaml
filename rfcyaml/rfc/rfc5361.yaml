  - "1.  Introduction\n   The framework for consent-based communications in the Session\n
    \  Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC5360] identifies the need for a format\n   to
    create permission documents.  Such permission documents are used\n   by SIP [RFC3261]
    relays to request permission to perform\n   translations.  A relay is defined
    as any SIP server, be it a proxy,\n   B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent), or some
    hybrid, which receives a\n   request and translates the Request-URI into one or
    more next-hop URIs\n   to which it then delivers a request.\n   The format for
    permission documents specified in this document is\n   based on Common Policy
    [RFC4745], an XML document format for\n   expressing privacy preferences.\n"

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n
    \  This document uses the terms defined in [RFC5360].  For completeness,\n   these
    terms are repeated here.  Figure 1 of [RFC5360] shows the\n   relationship between
    target and recipient URIs in a translation\n   operation.\n   Recipient URI:\n
    \     The Request-URI of an outgoing request sent by an entity (e.g., a\n      user
    agent or a proxy).  The sending of such request can have been\n      the result
    of a translation operation.\n   Relay:\n      Any SIP server, be it a proxy, B2BUA
    (Back-to-Back User Agent), or\n      some hybrid, that receives a request, translates
    its Request-URI\n      into one or more next-hop URIs (i.e., recipient URIs),
    and\n      delivers the request to those URIs.\n   Target URI:\n      The Request-URI
    of an incoming request that arrives to a relay\n      that will perform a translation
    operation.\n   Translation logic:\n      The logic that defines a translation
    operation at a relay.  This\n      logic includes the translation's target and
    recipient URIs.\n   Translation operation:\n      Operation by which a relay translates
    the Request-URI of an\n      incoming request (i.e., the target URI) into one
    or more URIs\n      (i.e., recipient URIs) that are used as the Request-URIs of
    one or\n      more outgoing requests.\n"

    formatted according to the\n   schema defined in [RFC4745].  Permission documents
    inherit the MIME\n   type of common policy documents, 'application/auth-policy+xml'.
    \ As\n   described in [RFC4745], this type of document is composed of three\n
    \  parts: conditions, actions, and transformations.\n   This section defines the
    new conditions and actions defined by this\n   specification.  This specification
    does not define any new\n   transformation.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Conditions\n   The conditions in a permission document are a set of expressions,\n
      \  each of which evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE.  Note that, as\n   discussed
      in [RFC4745], a permission document applies to a\n   translation if all the
      expressions in its conditions part evaluate to\n   TRUE.\n"
    - contents:
      - "3.1.1.  Recipient Condition\n   The recipient condition is matched against
        the recipient URI of a\n   translation.  Recipient conditions can contain
        the same elements and\n   attributes as identity conditions.\n   When performing
        a translation, a relay matches the recipient\n   condition of the permission
        document that was used to request\n   permission for that translation against
        the destination URI of the\n   outgoing request.  When receiving a request
        granting or denying\n   permissions (e.g., a SIP PUBLISH request as described
        in [RFC5360]),\n   the relay matches the recipient condition of the permission
        document\n   that was used to request permission against the identity of the\n
        \  entity granting or denying permissions (i.e., the sender of the\n   PUBLISH
        request).  If there is a match, the recipient condition\n   evaluates to TRUE.
        \ Otherwise, the recipient condition evaluates to\n   FALSE.\n   Since only
        authenticated identities can be matched, this section\n   defines acceptable
        means of authentication, which are in line with\n   those described in Section
        5.6.1 of [RFC5360].\n   The 'id' attribute in the elements <one> and <except>
        MUST contain a\n   scheme when these elements appear in a permission document.\n
        \  When used with SIP, a recipient granting or denying a relay\n   permissions
        is considered authenticated if one of the following\n   techniques is used:\n
        \  SIP Identity  [RFC4474], as described in Section 5.6.1.1 of\n      [RFC5360].
        \ For PUBLISH requests that are authenticated using the\n      SIP Identity
        mechanism, the identity of the sender of the PUBLISH\n      request is equal
        to the SIP URI in the From header field of the\n      request, assuming that
        the signature in the Identity header field\n      has been validated.\n   P-Asserted-Identity
        \ [RFC3325] (which can only be used in closed\n      network environments)
        as described in Section 5.6.1.2 of\n      [RFC5360].  For PUBLISH requests
        that are authenticated using the\n      P-Asserted-Identity mechanism, the
        identity of the sender of the\n      PUBLISH request is equal to the P-Asserted-Identity
        header field\n      of the request.\n   Return Routability Test, as described
        in Section 5.6.1.3 of\n      [RFC5360].  It can be used for SIP PUBLISH and
        HTTP GET requests.\n      No authentication is expected to be used with return
        routability\n      tests and, therefore, no identity matching procedures are
        defined.\n   SIP digest, as described in Section 5.6.1.4 of [RFC5360].  The\n
        \     identity of the sender is set equal to the SIP Address of Record\n      (AOR)
        for the user that has authenticated themselves.\n"

        is used as input\n   for a translation.\n   When performing a translation,
        a relay matches the identity condition\n   against the identity of the sender
        of the incoming request.  If they\n   match, the identity condition evaluates
        to TRUE.  Otherwise, the\n   identity condition evaluates to FALSE.\n   Since
        only authenticated identities can be matched, the following\n   subsections
        define acceptable means of authentication, the procedure\n   for representing
        the identity of the sender as a URI, and the\n   procedure for converting
        an identifier of the form user@domain,\n   present in the 'id' attribute of

          request sent by a sender is considered\n   authenticated if one of the following
          techniques is used:\n   SIP Digest:  the relay authenticates the sender
          using SIP digest\n      authentication [RFC2617].  However, if the anonymous\n
          \     authentication described on page 194 of [RFC3261] is used, the\n      sender
          is not considered authenticated.\n   Asserted Identity:  if a request contains
          a P-Asserted-ID header\n      field [RFC3325] and the request is coming
          from a trusted element,\n      the sender is considered authenticated.\n
          \  Cryptographically Verified Identity:  if a request contains an\n      Identity
          header field as defined in [RFC4474], and it validates\n      the From header
          field of the request, the request is considered to\n      be authenticated.
          \ Note that this is true even if the request\n      contained a From header
          field of the form\n      sip:anonymous@example.com.  As long as the signature
          verifies that\n      the request legitimately came from this identity, it
          is considered\n      authenticated.\n"

        - "3.1.2.2.  Computing a URI for the Sender\n   For requests that are authenticated
          using SIP Digest, the identity of\n   the sender is set equal to the SIP
          Address of Record (AOR) for the\n   user that has authenticated themselves.
          \ For example, consider the\n   following \"user record\" in a database:\n
          \     SIP AOR: sip:alice@example.com\n      digest username: ali\n      digest
          password: f779ajvvh8a6s6\n      digest realm: example.com\n   If the relay
          receives a request and challenges it with the realm set\n   to \"example.com\",
          and the subsequent request contains an\n   Authorization header field with
          a username of \"ali\" and a digest\n   response generated with the password
          \"f779ajvvh8a6s6\", the identity\n   used in matching operations is \"sip:alice@example.com\".\n
          \  For requests that are authenticated using [RFC3325], the identity of\n
          \  the sender is equal to the SIP URI in the P-Asserted-ID header field.\n
          \  If there are multiple values for the P-Asserted-ID header field\n   (there
          can be one sip URI and one tel URI [RFC3966]), then each of\n   them is
          used for the comparisons outlined in [RFC4745]; if either of\n   them match
          a <one> or <except> element, it is considered a match.\n   For requests
          that are authenticated using the SIP Identity mechanism\n   [RFC4474], identity
          of the sender is equal to the SIP URI in the From\n   header field of the
          request, assuming that the signature in the\n   Identity header field has
          been validated.\n   SIP also allows for anonymous requests.  If a request
          is anonymous\n   because the digest challenge/response used the \"anonymous\"
          username,\n   the request is considered unauthenticated and will not match
          the\n   <identity> condition.  If a request is anonymous because it contains\n
          \  a Privacy header field [RFC3323], but still contains a P-Asserted-ID\n
          \  header field, the identity in the P-Asserted-ID header field is still\n
          \  used in the authorization computations; the fact that the request was\n
          \  anonymous has no impact on the identity processing.  However, if the\n
          \  request had traversed a trust boundary and the P-Asserted-ID header\n
          \  field and the Privacy header field had been removed, the request will\n
          \  be considered unauthenticated when it arrives at the relay, and thus\n
          \  not match the <sender> condition.  Finally, if a request contained an\n
          \  Identity header field that was validated, and the From header field\n
          \  contained a URI of the form sip:anonymous@example.com, then the\n   sender
          is considered authenticated, and it will have an identity\n   equal to sip:anonymous@example.com.
          \ Had such an identity been placed\n   into a <one> or <except> element,
          there will be a match.\n"
