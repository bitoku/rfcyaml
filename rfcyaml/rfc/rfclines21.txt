Revisions to NWG/RFC 11 3.
Transmission of multiple control messages 1.
As informally communicated by Dave Wa p. 11
"The IMP program can handle up to 63 active transmit links and 63 active receive links at a time.
If the Host attempts to send a message on a new link when 63 active transmit links already exist, a "Link Table Full" message will be sent from the IMP to the Host, and the message will be discarded."
Any link that is not used for a period of 26 seconds will have its entry automatically deleted by the IMP program."
[Cerf:  How about deleting only if the transmit link table is full?
No, because there is no other way for links to be deleted so they would always tend to accumulate.
Furthermore, the table at one site may be full while another site may not be.]
" This allows IMP systems to generate traffic which never actually reaches any Hosts since it will be discarded when it reaches the top of the IMP HOST queue in the destination Host's IMP.
The Network Measurement Center will make use of this feature.
Message type 6 is no longer assigned, and message type 10 is really in octal
so is actually type 8.
Types 9 15 are unassigned.
Type 10 is really type 8.
This memo has been obsoleted by developments at UCLA and discussions with other nodes.
NWG/RFC 22 contains some of the major changes.
An updated version of NWG/RFC 11 is forthcoming.
George Gregg of UCSB will publish NWG/RFC 23 concerning the transmission of multiple control messages over control links.
