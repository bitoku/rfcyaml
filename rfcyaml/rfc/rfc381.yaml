  - "1.  Scheduled Software Maintenance\n   As the ARPA Network has grown larger,\
    \ we have found it difficult to\n   find times when necessary new software can\
    \ be slipped into the\n   network without disrupting anyone.  For instance, there\
    \ is always\n   intrasite traffic between the machines at MIT, and there is almost\n\
    \   always traffic between the AMES TIP and IMP--the sun never sets on\n   the\
    \ ARPA Network.  To minimize unscheduled disruptions and to\n   simultaneously\
    \ let us do what we have to do, we propose to schedule 7\n   A.M. - 8 A.M. eastern\
    \ time every Tuesday as a time when the IMPs can\n   be reloaded.  We will probably\
    \ not use this period every Tuesday, but\n   we do reserve this period every Tuesday.\
    \  The above period is in\n   addition to the several hours a month already scheduled\
    \ at each site\n   for hardware preventative maintenance.\n   Because a network\
    \ user may not know when his machine is scheduled for\n   maintenance or because\
    \ he may forget and work through the Tuesday\n   morning software period, we propose\
    \ to generalize the IMP-Going-Down\n   IMP-to-Host control message so it may be\
    \ used to remind the user.\n   This message (described in detail below) will contain\
    \ information\n   that the IMP is going down in m times five minutes, for n times\
    \ 5\n   minutes, for a given reason.  Hosts (and the TIP) should use this\n  \
    \ information to remind all their Network users that the IMP will be\n   going\
    \ down after the stated interval.\n   Occasionally there is an emergency reason\
    \ for restarting or reloading\n   an IMP.  For instance, while three Hosts at\
    \ a site are functioning\n   well, one Host cannot communicate with the IMP. \
    \ This sort of\n   situation sometimes requires the IMP to be restarted.  Such\
    \ a restart\n   will be preceded by several minutes by an IMP-Going-Down Message\
    \ to\n   allow working users to save their work in such a way that they can\n\
    \   restart once the IMP is back up.\n   In both of these cases, as well as cases\
    \ where an IMP is performing\n   so poorly that is must be shut down quickly,\
    \ a type 2 IMP-to-HOST\n   message will be transmitted to the HOST about 30 seconds\
    \ before the\n   IMP goes down.  Finally, of course, there may be occasions when\
    \ the\n   IMP crashes so quickly that no warning is given, but the IMP will\n\
    \   never be intentionally shut down in this way.\n"

  - "2.  IMP-to-Host Communication\n   There have long been complaints that the IMP-to-Host\
    \ error messages\n   were not precise enough or were just plain ambiguous.  In\
    \ RFC #312 we\n   proposed some additional error messages.  These and other IMP-to-Host\n\
    \   message changes will be made on August 14, 1972 and we encourage\n   Hosts\
    \ to modify their NCP's as appropriate by then.  Unmodified NCPs\n   will probably\
    \ continue to work after this change, but each site\n   should look into this\
    \ question carefully.  The table below lists all\n   the IMP-to-Host messages\
    \ and clearly indicates the changes which will\n   be made.\n   Type      Old\
