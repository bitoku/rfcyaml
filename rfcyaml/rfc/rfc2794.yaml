- contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   AAA servers are in use within the Internet today to provide\n
    \  authentication and authorization services for dial-up computers.\n   Such services
    are likely to be equally valuable for mobile nodes\n   using Mobile IP when the
    nodes are attempting to connect to foreign\n   domains with AAA servers.  AAA
    servers today identify clients by\n   using the Network Access Identifier (NAI)
    [1].  This document\n   specifies the Mobile Node NAI extension to the Mobile
    IP Registration\n   Request [7] message from the mobile node.\n   Since the NAI
    is typically used to uniquely identify the mobile node,\n   the mobile node's
    home address is not always necessary to provide\n   that function.  Thus, it is
    possible for a mobile node to\n   authenticate itself, and be authorized for connection
    to the foreign\n   domain, without even having a home address.  A message containing
    the\n   Mobile Node NAI extension MAY set the Home Address field to zero (0)\n
    \  in the Registration Request, to request that a home address be\n   assigned.\n
    \  The \"Mobile-IPv4 Configuration\" option to IPCP has been specified in\n   RFC
    2290 [8] for proper interaction between a mobile node and a peer,\n   through
    which the mobile node connects to the network using PPP.\n   According to that
    specification the Mobile Node's Home Address field\n   of the option MUST not
    be zero.  However, in the context of this memo\n   which allows a mobile node
    to be identified by its NAI and to obtain\n   an address after the PPP phase of
    connection establishment, the Home\n   Address field is allowed to be zero while
    maintaining all other\n   aspects of RFC 2290.  Interpretation of various scenarios
    from RFC\n   2290 is given in section 4.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described
    in [3].\n"

  - "3. Foreign Agent Considerations\n   If Home Address is zero in the Registration
    Request, the foreign\n   agent MUST use the NAI instead in its pending registration
    request\n   records, along with the Identification field as usual.  If the\n   foreign
    agent cannot manage pending registration request records in\n   this way, it MUST
    return a Registration Reply with Code indicating\n   NONZERO_HOMEADDR_REQD (see
    section 5).\n   If the mobile node includes the Mobile Node NAI extension in its\n
    \  Registration Request, then the Registration Reply from the home agent\n   MUST
    include the Mobile Node NAI extension.  If not, the foreign\n   agent SHOULD send
    the Registration Reply to the mobile node, changing\n   the Code to the value
    MISSING_NAI (see section 5).  The Registration\n   Reply MUST include a nonzero
    Home Agent address and mobile node's\n   Home Address.  If not, the foreign agent
    SHOULD send the Registration\n   Reply to the mobile node, changing the Code to
    the value\n   MISSING_HOME_AGENT or MISSING_HOMEADDR, respectively (see section
    5).\n"

  - "4. Interactions with Mobile-IPv4 Configuration Option to IPCP\n   In the Mobile-IPv4
    Configuration Option to IPCP [8], the Mobile\n   Node's Home Address field may
    be zero.  In this section, we specify\n   the action to be taken in that case,
    when the mobile node is using\n   the Mobile Node NAI extension in the Mobile
    IP Registration Request.\n   Whether or not the IP Address Configuration Option
    contains a nonzero\n   IP address, the mobile node will subsequently attempt to
    obtain a\n   home address from the Mobile IP Registration Reply.\n   If the IP
    Address Configuration Option to IPCP has IP address equal\n   to zero, the PPP
    peer is expected to allocate and assign a co-located\n   care-of address to the
    Mobile Node.  If, on the other hand, the IP\n   Address Configuration Option to
    IPCP has a nonzero IP address, the\n   PPP peer is expected to assign that address
    to the Mobile Node as its\n   co-located care-of address.\n   Finally, if the
    IP Address Configuration Option is left out of the\n   IPCP Configure-Request,
    then no co-located care of address is\n   assigned during IPCP. The mobile node
    will acquire a co-located care\n   of address during a later stage of configuration
    or will use an FA-\n   located care-of address.\n"

  - "8. IPv6 Considerations\n   Supporting NAI-based registrations for Mobile IPv6
    [4] is outside the\n   scope of this document.  This section contains some ideas
    how\n   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [9] and DHCPv6 [2] might be\n   extended
    to support NAI-based Mobile IPv6 registrations.\n   For mobile nodes using IPv6,
    there are no commonly deployed\n   mechanisms by which a mobile node may present
    its credentials, such\n   as exist today with IPv4.  Nevertheless, a mobile node
    using IPv6\n   mobility may wish to specify the domain in which their credentials\n
    \  may be checked, by using a NAI just as this specification proposes\n   for
    IPv4.  In the case of IPv6, however, there is no foreign agent in\n   place to
    manage the connectivity of the mobile node, and thus to\n   manage the verification
    of the credentials offered by the mobile\n   node.  To identify the HDAF (see
    appendix A) that has the expected\n   relationship with the mobile node, the NAI
    would have to be forwarded\n   to a local AAA by the local agent involved with
    configuring the\n   care-of address of the mobile node.\n   This agent can either
    be a router sending out Router Advertisements\n   [9], or a DHCPv6 server.  In
    the former case, the router could signal\n   its ability to handle the NAI by
    attaching some yet to be defined\n   option to the Router Advertisement.  In the
    latter case, for managed\n   links, the mobile node could include a yet to be
    defined NAI\n   extension in its DHCP Solicitation message.  Such an NAI extension\n
    \  and appropriate authentication would also be required on the\n   subsequent
    DHCP Request sent by the mobile node to the DHCP Server\n   selected on the basis
    of received DHCP Advertisements.  Once a care-\n   of address on the foreign network
    has been obtained, the mobile node\n   can use regular MIPv6 [4].\n"

    function named the Home Domain\n   Allocation Function (HDAF) that can dynamically
    assign a Home Address\n   to the mobile node.\n   Figure 2 illustrates the Home
    HDAF, which receives messages from\n   foreign agents (e.g., FA) and assigns a
    Home Address within the Home\n   Domain.  The HDAF does not perform any Mobile
    IP processing on the\n   Registration Request, but simply forwards the request
    to a Home Agent\n   (HA) within the network that is able to handle the request.\n
