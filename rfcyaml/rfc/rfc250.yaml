  - "                     Some Thoughts on File Transfer\n   There are several aspects\
    \ of the proposed Data Transfer Protocol (RFC\n   #171) and File Transfer Protocol\
    \ (RFC #172) which we believe could\n   use further clarification and perhaps\
    \ revision.  Interest in\n   transferring larger amounts of data than is typically\
    \ sent via the\n   usual TELNET connection is increasing, and at least at UCLA-NMC\n\
    \   implementation attempts have pointed out several difficulties with\n   the\
    \ proposed protocols.\n   First, and probably most easily decided, is the ambiguity\
    \ in RFC #171\n   with regards to the sequence number field of the descriptor\
    \ and count\n   transaction.  The description provided for the transaction header\n\
    \   provides for 16 bit sequence number.  However, the sequence number\n   field\
    \ in the error codes transaction only provides for 8 bits.  We\n   are of the\
    \ opinion that 8 bits is sufficient for a sequence number\n   field.  If the sequence\
    \ number is reduced to 8 bits, and the two NUL\n   bytes are deleted from the\
    \ descriptor and count header, then its size\n   is reduced to 48 bits, which\
    \ would seem to be as convenient to handle\n   as the proposed 72 bit transaction\
    \ header.\n   Another source of difficulty lies in the implementation of the (the\n\
    \   SEX time-sharing system) the 'end' of a file (which presumably would\n   be\
    \ the begin point of an Append transaction) is almost com- pletely\n   context-defined--i.e.,\
    \ the program reading the file determines when\n   it has reached the end of the\
    \ file.  Therefore, the meaning of\n   'Append' is somewhat hazy, and since the\
    \ proposed Mail Box Protocol\n   uses the Append feature, not implementing this\
    \ command in a File\n   Transfer service is costly in terms of lost useability.\n\
    \   We believe that resolution of these ambiguities will lead to a\n   greatly\
    \ accelerated implementation schedule, at least here at UCLA-\n   NMC.\n     \
