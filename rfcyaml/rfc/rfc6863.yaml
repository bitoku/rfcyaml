  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document analyzes the current state of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3\n\
    \   according to the requirements of [RFC6518].  It builds on several\n   previous\
    \ analysis efforts regarding routing security.  The OPSEC\n   working group put\
    \ together an analysis of cryptographic issues with\n   routing protocols [RFC6039].\
    \  Earlier, the RPSEC working group put\n   together a detailed analysis of OSPF\
    \ vulnerabilities [OSPF-SEC].\n   Work on solutions to address gaps identified\
    \ in this analysis is\n   underway [OSPF-MANKEY] [RFC6506].\n   OSPF meets many\
    \ of the requirements expected from a manually keyed\n   routing protocol.  Integrity\
    \ protection is provided with modern\n   cryptographic algorithms.  Algorithm\
    \ agility is provided: the\n   algorithm can be changed as part of rekeying an\
    \ interface or peer.\n   Intra-connection rekeying is provided by the specifications,\
    \ although\n   apparently some implementations have trouble with this in practice.\n\
    \   OSPFv2 security does not interfere with prioritization of packets.\n   However,\
    \ some gaps remain between the current state and the\n   requirements for manually\
    \ keyed routing security expressed in\n   [RFC6862].  This document explores these\
    \ gaps and proposes directions\n   for addressing the gaps.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements to Meet
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements to Meet\n   There are a number of requirements described in\
    \ Section 3 of\n   [RFC6862] that OSPF does not currently meet.  The gaps are\
    \ as\n   follows:\n   o  Secure Simple Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs): Today, OSPF directly\
    \ uses\n      the key as specified.  Related key attacks, such as those\n    \
    \  described in Section 4.1 of [OPS-MODEL], are possible.\n   o  Replay Protection:\
    \ The requirements document addresses\n      requirements for both inter-connection\
    \ replay protection and\n      intra-connection replay protection.  OSPFv3 has\
    \ no replay\n      protection at all.  OSPFv2 has most of the mechanisms necessary\n\
    \      for intra-connection replay protection.  Unfortunately, OSPFv2\n      does\
    \ not securely identify the neighbor with whom replay\n      protection state\
    \ is associated in all cases.  This weakness can be\n      used to create significant\
    \ denial-of-service issues using intra-\n      connection replays.  OSPFv2 has\
    \ no inter-connection replay\n      protection; this creates significant denial-of-service\n\
    \      opportunities.\n   o  Packet Prioritization: OSPFv3 uses IPsec [RFC4301]\
    \ to process\n      packets.  This complicates implementations that wish to process\n\
    \      some packets, such as Hellos and Acknowledgements, above others.\n    \
    \  In addition, if IPsec replay mechanisms were used, packets would\n      need\
    \ to be processed at least by IPsec even if they were low\n      priority.\n \
    \  o  Neighbor Identification: In some cases, OSPF identifies a neighbor\n   \
    \   based on the IP address.  This operation is never protected with\n      OSPFv2\
    \ and is not typically protected with OSPFv3.\n   The remainder of this document\
    \ explains how OSPF fails to meet these\n   requirements, and it proposes mechanisms\
    \ for addressing them.\n"

- title: 2.  Current State
  contents:
  - "2.  Current State\n   This section describes the security mechanisms built into\
    \ OSPFv2 and\n   OSPFv3.  There are two goals to this section.  First, this section\n\
    \   gives a brief explanation of the OSPF security mechanisms to those\n   familiar\
    \ with connectionless integrity mechanisms but not with OSPF.\n   Second, this\
    \ section provides the background necessary to understand\n   how OSPF fails to\
    \ meet some of the requirements proposed for routing\n   security.\n"
- title: 2.1.  OSPFv2
  contents:
  - "2.1.  OSPFv2\n   Appendix D of [RFC2328] describes the basic procedure for\n\
    \   cryptographic authentication in OSPFv2.  An authentication data field\n  \
    \ in the OSPF packet header contains a key ID, the length of the\n   authentication\
    \ data, and a sequence number.  A Message Authentication\n   Code (MAC) is appended\
    \ to the OSPF packet.  This code protects all\n   fields of the packet including\
    \ the sequence number but not the IP\n   header.\n   RFC 2328 defines the use\
    \ of a keyed-MD5 MAC.  While MD5 has not been\n   broken as a MAC, it is not the\
    \ algorithm of choice for new MACs.\n   However, RFC 5709 [RFC5709] adds support\
    \ for the SHA family of hashes\n   [FIPS180] to OSPFv2.  The cryptographic authentication\
    \ described in\n   RFC 5709 meets modern standards for per-packet integrity protection.\n\
    \   Thus, OSPFv2 meets the requirement for strong algorithms.  Since\n   multiple\
    \ algorithms are defined and a new algorithm can be selected\n   with each key,\
    \ OSPFv2 meets the requirement for algorithm agility.\n   In order to provide\
    \ cryptographic algorithms believed to have a\n   relatively long useful life,\
    \ RFC 5709 mandates support for SHA-2\n   rather than SHA-1.\n   These security\
    \ services provide integrity protection on each packet.\n   In addition, limited\
    \ replay detection is provided.  The sequence\n   number is non-decreasing.  So,\
    \ once a router has increased its\n   sequence number, an attacker cannot replay\
    \ an old packet.\n   Unfortunately, sequence numbers are not required to increase\
    \ for each\n   packet.  For instance, because existing OSPF security solutions\
    \ do\n   not specify how to set the sequence number, it is possible that some\n\
    \   implementations use, for example, \"seconds since reboot\" as their\n   sequence\
    \ numbers.  The sequence numbers are thus increased only every\n   second, permitting\
    \ an opportunity for intra-connection replay.  Also,\n   no mechanism is provided\
    \ to deal with the loss of anti-replay state;\n   if sequence numbers are reused\
    \ when a router reboots, then inter-\n   connection replays are straight forward.\
    \  In [OSPF-MANKEY], the\n   OSPFv2 sequence number is expanded to 64 bits, with\
    \ the least\n   significant 32-bit value containing a strictly increasing sequence\n\
    \   number and the most significant 32-bit value containing the boot\n   count.\
    \  The boot count is retained in non-volatile storage for the\n   deployment life\
    \ of an OSPF router.  Therefore, the sequence number\n   will never decrease,\
    \ even after a cold reboot.\n   Also, because the IP header is not protected,\
    \ the sequence number may\n   not be associated with the correct neighbor, a situation\
    \ that opens\n   up opportunities for outsiders to perform replay attacks.  See\n\
    \   Section 3 for analysis of these attacks.  In [OSPF-MANKEY], this\n   issue\
    \ is addressed by changing the definition of Apad from a constant\n   defined\
    \ in [RFC5709] to the source address in the IP header of the\n   OSPFv2 protocol\
    \ packet.  In this way, the source address from the IP\n   header is incorporated\
    \ in the cryptographic authentication\n   computation, and any change of the IP\
    \ source address will be\n   detected.\n   The mechanism provides good support\
    \ for key rollover.  There is a key\n   ID.  In addition, mechanisms are described\
    \ for managing key lifetimes\n   and starting the use of a new key in an orderly\
    \ manner.  Performing\n   orderly key rollover requires that implementations support\
    \ accepting\n   a new key for received packets before using that key to generate\n\
    \   packets.  Section D.3 of RFC 2328 requires this support in the form\n   of\
    \ four configurable lifetimes for each key: two lifetimes control\n   the beginning\
    \ and ending period for acceptance, while two other\n   lifetimes control the\
    \ beginning and ending period for generation.\n   These lifetimes provide a superset\
    \ of the functionality in the key\n   table [CRYPTO-KEYS] regarding lifetime.\n\
    \   The OSPFv2 replay mechanism does not handle prioritized transmission\n   of\
    \ OSPF Hello and Link State Acknowledgement (LSA) packets as\n   recommended in\
    \ [RFC4222].  When OSPF packets are transmitted with\n   varied prioritization,\
    \ they can arrive out of order, which results in\n   packets with lower prioritization\
    \ being discarded.\n"
- title: 2.2.  OSPFv3
  contents:
  - "2.2.  OSPFv3\n   \"Authentication/Confidentiality for OSPFv3\" [RFC4552] describes\
    \ how\n   the IPsec authentication header and encapsulating security payload\n\
    \   mechanism can be used to protect OSPFv3 packets.  This mechanism\n   provides\
    \ per-packet integrity and optional confidentiality using a\n   wide variety of\
    \ cryptographic algorithms.  Because OSPF uses\n   multicast traffic, only manual\
    \ key management is supported.  This\n   mechanism meets requirements related\
    \ to algorithm selection and\n   agility.\n   The Security Parameter Index (SPI)\
    \ [RFC4301] provides an identifier\n   for the security association.  This identifier,\
    \ along with other\n   IPsec facilities, provides a mechanism for moving from\
    \ one key to\n   another, meeting the key rollover requirements.\n   Because manual\
    \ keying is used, no replay protection is provided for\n   OSPFv3.  Thus, the\
    \ intra-connection and inter-connection replay\n   requirements are not met.\n\
    \   There is another serious problem with the OSPFv3 security: rather\n   than\
    \ being integrated into OSPF, it is based on IPsec.  In practice,\n   this has\
    \ lead to deployment problems.\n   OSPF implementations generally prioritize packets\
    \ in order to\n   minimize disruption when router resources such as CPU or memory\n\
    \   experience contention.  When IPsec is used with OSPFv3, the offset of\n  \
    \ the packet type, which is used to prioritize packets, depends on\n   which integrity\
    \ transform is used.  For this reason, prioritizing\n   packets may be more complex\
    \ for OSPFv3.  One approach is to establish\n   per-SPI filters to find the packet\
    \ type and then act accordingly.\n"
- title: 3.  Impacts of OSPF Replays
  contents:
  - "3.  Impacts of OSPF Replays\n   As discussed, neither version of OSPF meets the\
    \ requirements of\n   inter-connection or intra-connection replay protection.\
    \  In order to\n   mount a replay, an attacker needs some mechanism to inject\
    \ a packet.\n   Physical security can limit a particular deployment's vulnerability\n\
    \   to replay attacks.  This section discusses the impacts of OSPF\n   replays.\n\
    \   In OSPFv2, two facilities limit the scope of replay attacks.  First,\n   when\
    \ cryptographic authentication is used, each packet includes a\n   sequence number\
    \ that is non-decreasing.  In the current\n   specifications, the sequence number\
    \ is remembered as part of an\n   adjacency: if an attacker can cause an adjacency\
    \ to go down, then\n   replay state is lost.  Database Description packets also\
    \ include a\n   per-LSA sequence number that is part of the information that is\n\
    \   flooded.  Even if a packet is replayed, the per-LSA sequence number\n   will\
    \ prevent an old LSA from being installed.  Unlike the per-packet\n   sequence\
    \ number, the per-LSA sequence number must increase when an\n   LSA is changed.\
    \  As a result, replays cannot be used to install old\n   routing information.\n\
    \   While the LSA sequence number provides some defense, the Routing\n   Protocol\
    \ Security Requirements (RPSEC) analysis [OSPF-SEC] describes\n   a number of\
    \ attacks that are possible because of per-packet replays.\n   The most serious\
    \ appear to be attacks against Hello packets, which\n   may cause an adjacency\
    \ to fail.  Other attacks may cause excessive\n   flooding or excessive use of\
    \ CPU.\n   Another serious attack concerns Database Description packets.  In\n\
    \   addition to the per-packet sequence number that is part of\n   cryptographic\
    \ authentication for OSPFv2 and the per-LSA sequence\n   numbers, Database Description\
    \ packets also include a Database\n   Description sequence number.  If a Database\
    \ Description packet with\n   the incorrect sequence number is received, then\
    \ the database exchange\n   process will be restarted.\n   The per-packet OSPFv2\
    \ sequence number can be used to reduce the\n   window in which a replay is valid.\
    \  A receiver will harmlessly reject\n   a packet whose per-packet sequence number\
    \ is older than the one most\n   recently received from a neighbor.  Replaying\
    \ the most recent packet\n   from a neighbor does not appear to create problems.\
    \  So, if the per-\n   packet sequence number is incremented on every packet sent,\
    \ then\n   replay attacks should not disrupt OSPFv2.  Unfortunately, OSPFv2 does\n\
    \   not have a procedure for dealing with sequence numbers reaching the\n   maximum\
    \ value.  It may be possible to figure out a set of rules\n   sufficient to disrupt\
    \ the damage of packet replays while minimizing\n   the use of the sequence number\
    \ space.\n   As mentioned previously, when an adjacency is dropped, replay state\n\
    \   is lost.  So, after rebooting or when all adjacencies are lost, a\n   router\
    \ may allow its sequence number to decrease.  An attacker can\n   cause significant\
    \ damage by replaying a packet captured before the\n   sequence number decrease\
    \ at a time after the sequence number\n   decrease.  If this happens, then the\
    \ replayed packet will be accepted\n   and the sequence number will be updated.\
    \  However, the legitimate\n   sender will be using a lower sequence number, so\
    \ legitimate packets\n   will be rejected.  A similar attack is possible in cases\
    \ where OSPF\n   identifies a neighbor based on source address.  An attacker can\n\
    \   change the source address of a captured packet and replay it.  If the\n  \
    \ attacker causes a replay from a neighbor with a high sequence number\n   to\
    \ appear to be from a neighbor with a low sequence number, then\n   connectivity\
    \ with that neighbor will be disrupted until the adjacency\n   fails.\n   OSPFv3\
    \ lacks the per-packet sequence number but has the per-LSA\n   sequence number.\
    \  As such, OSPFv3 has no defense against denial-of-\n   service attacks that\
    \ exploit replay.\n"
- title: 4.  Gap Analysis and Specific Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Gap Analysis and Specific Requirements\n   The design guide requires each\
    \ design team to enumerate a set of\n   requirements for the routing protocol.\
    \  The only concerns identified\n   with OSPF are areas in which it fails to meet\
    \ the general\n   requirements outlined in the threats and requirements document.\
    \  This\n   section explains how some of these general requirements map\n   specifically\
    \ onto the OSPF protocol and enumerates the specific gaps\n   that need to be\
    \ addressed.\n   There is a general requirement for inter-connection replay\n\
    \   protection.  In the context of OSPF, this means that if an adjacency\n   goes\
    \ down between two neighbors and later is re-established,\n   replaying packets\
    \ from before the adjacency went down cannot disrupt\n   the adjacency.  In the\
    \ context of OSPF, intra-connection replay\n   protection means that replaying\
    \ a packet cannot prevent an adjacency\n   from forming or cannot disrupt an existing\
    \ adjacency.  In terms of\n   meeting the requirements for intra-connection and\
    \ inter-connection\n   replay protection, a significant gap exists between the\
    \ optimal state\n   and where OSPF is today.\n   Since OSPF uses fields in the\
    \ IP header, the general requirement to\n   protect the IP header and handle neighbor\
    \ identification applies.\n   This is another gap that needs to be addressed.\
    \  Because the replay\n   protection will depend on neighbor identification, the\
    \ replay\n   protection cannot be adequately addressed without handling this issue\n\
    \   as well.\n   In order to encourage deployment of OSPFv3 security, an\n   authentication\
    \ option is required that does not have the deployment\n   challenges of IPsec.\n\
    \   In order to support the requirement for simple pre-shared keys, OSPF\n   needs\
    \ to make sure that when the same key is used for two different\n   purposes,\
    \ no problems result.\n   In order to support packet prioritization, it is desirable\
    \ for the\n   information needed to prioritize OSPF packets (the packet type)\
    \ to be\n   at a constant location in the packet.\n"
- title: 5.  Solution Work
  contents:
  - "5.  Solution Work\n   It is recommended that the OSPF Working Group develop a\
    \ solution for\n   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 based on the OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication\n\
    \   option.  This solution would have the following improvements over the\n  \
    \ existing OSPFv2 option:\n      Address most inter-connection replay attacks\
    \ by splitting the\n      sequence number and requiring preservation of state\
    \ so that the\n      sequence number increases on every packet.\n      Add a form\
    \ of simple key derivation so that if the same pre-shared\n      key is used for\
    \ OSPF and other purposes, cross-protocol attacks do\n      not result.\n    \
    \  Support OSPFv3 authentication without use of IPsec.\n      Specify processing\
    \ rules sufficient to permit replay detection and\n      packet prioritization.\n\
    \      Emphasize requirements already present in the OSPF specification\n    \
    \  sufficient to permit key migration without disrupting adjacencies.\n      Specify\
    \ the proper use of the key table for OSPF.\n      Protect the source IP address.\n\
    \      Require that sequence numbers be incremented on each packet.\n   The key\
    \ components of this solution work are already underway.\n   OSPFv3 now supports\
    \ an authentication option [RFC6506] that meets the\n   requirements of this section;\
    \ however, this document does not\n   describe how the key tables are used for\
    \ OSPF.  OSPFv2 is being\n   enhanced [OSPF-MANKEY] to protect the source address,\
    \ provide inter-\n   connection replay and describe how to use the key table.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This memo discusses and compiles vulnerabilities\
    \ in the existing OSPF\n   cryptographic handling.\n   In analyzing proposed improvements\
    \ to OSPF per-packet security, it is\n   desirable to consider how these improvements\
    \ interact with potential\n   improvements in overall routing security.  For example,\
    \ the impact of\n   replay attacks currently depends on the LSA sequence number\n\
    \   mechanism.  If cryptographic protections against insider attackers\n   are\
    \ considered by future work, then that work will need to provide a\n   solution\
    \ that meets the needs of the per-packet replay defense as\n   well as protects\
    \ routing data from insider attack.  An experimental\n   solution is discussed\
    \ in [RFC2154] that explores end-to-end\n   protection of routing data in OSPF.\
    \  It may be beneficial to consider\n   how improvements to the per-packet protections\
    \ would interact with\n   such a mechanism to future-proof these mechanisms.\n\
    \   Implementations have a number of options in minimizing the potential\n   denial-of-service\
    \ impact of OSPF cryptographic authentication.  The\n   Generalized TTL Security\
    \ Mechanism (GTSM) [RFC5082] might be\n   appropriate for OSPF packets except\
    \ for those traversing virtual\n   links.  Using this mechanism requires support\
    \ of the sender; new OSPF\n   cryptographic authentication could specify this\
    \ behavior if desired.\n   Alternatively, implementations can limit the source\
    \ addresses from\n   which they accept packets.  Non-Hello packets need only be\
    \ accepted\n   from existing neighbors.  If a system is under attack, Hello packets\n\
    \   from existing neighbors could be prioritized over Hello packets from\n   new\
    \ neighbors.  These mechanisms can be considered to limit the\n   potential impact\
    \ of denial-of-service attacks on the cryptographic\n   authentication mechanism\
    \ itself.\n"
