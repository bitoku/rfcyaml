- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multihoming is an important component of service for many\
    \ Internet\n   sites.  Current IPv4 multihoming practices have been added on to\
    \ the\n   Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR) architecture [RFC1519], which\n\
    \   assumes that routing table entries can be aggregated based upon a\n   hierarchy\
    \ of customers and service providers.\n   Multihoming is a mechanism by which\
    \ sites can satisfy a number of\n   high-level requirements.  It is widely used\
    \ in the IPv4 Internet.\n   There are some practical limitations, however, including\
    \ concerns as\n   to how it would scale with future Internet growth.  This document\n\
    \   aims to document common IPv4 multihoming practices and enumerate\n   their\
    \ features for comparison with other multihoming approaches.\n   There are a number\
    \ of different ways to route and manage traffic in\n   and out of a multihomed\
    \ site: the majority rely on the routing policy\n   capabilities of the inter-domain\
    \ routing protocol, the Border Gateway\n   Protocol, version 4 (BGP) [RFC1771].\
    \  This document also discusses a\n   multi-homing strategy which does not rely\
    \ on the capabilities of BGP.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   A \"site\" is an entity autonomously operating a network\
    \ using IP, and\n   in particular, determining the addressing plan and routing\
    \ policy for\n   that network.  This definition is intended to be equivalent to\n\
    \   'enterprise' as defined in [RFC1918].\n   A \"transit provider\" operates\
    \ a site that directly provides\n   connectivity to the Internet to one or more\
    \ external sites.  The\n   connectivity provided extends beyond the transit provider's\
    \ own site\n   and its own direct customer networks.  A transit provider's site\
    \ is\n   directly connected to the sites for which it provides transit.\n   A\
    \ \"multihomed\" site is one with more than one transit provider.\n   \"Site-multihoming\"\
    \ is the practice of arranging a site to be\n   multihomed.\n   The term \"re-homing\"\
    \ denotes a transition of a site between two\n   states of connectedness, due\
    \ to a change in the connectivity between\n   the site and its transit providers'\
    \ sites.\n   A \"multi-attached\" site has more than one point of layer-3\n  \
    \ interconnection to a single transit provider.\n   Provider-Independent (PI)\
    \ addresses are globally-unique addresses\n   which are not assigned by a transit\
    \ provider, but are provided by\n   some other organisation, usually a Regional\
    \ Internet Registry (RIR).\n   Provider-Aggregatable (PA) addresses are globally-unique\
    \ addresses\n   assigned by a transit provider to a customer.  The addresses are\n\
    \   considered \"aggregatable\" because the set of routes corresponding to\n \
    \  the PA addresses are usually covered by an aggregate route set\n   corresponding\
    \ to the address space operated by the transit provider,\n   from which the assignment\
    \ was made.\n   Note that the words \"assign\" and \"allocate\" have specific\
    \ meanings in\n   Regional Internet Registry (RIR) address management policies,\
    \ but are\n   used more loosely in this document.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Multihoming with BGP
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Multihoming with BGP\n   The general approach for multihoming with BGP\
    \ is to announce a set of\n   routes to two or more transit providers.  This provides\
    \ the rest of\n   the Internet with multiple paths back to the multihomed sites,\
    \ and\n   each transit provider provides an additional possible path for the\n\
    \   site's outbound traffic.\n"

  - '3.1.1.  Addressing Considerations

    '
- title: 3.1.1.1.  PI Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.1.  PI Addresses\n   The site uses PI addresses, and a set of routes covering\
    \ those PI\n   addresses is announced or propagated by two or more transit\n \
    \  providers.\n   Using PI addresses has long been the preferred approach for\
    \ IPv4\n   multihoming.  Until the mid-1990s this was relatively easy to\n   accomplish,\
    \ as the maximum generally accepted prefix length in the\n   global routing table\
    \ was a /24, and little justification was needed\n   to obtain a /24 PI assignment.\
    \  Since then, RIR address management\n   policies have become less liberal in\
    \ this respect.  Not all RIRs\n   support the assignment of address blocks to\
    \ small, multihomed end-\n   users, and those that do support it require justification\
    \ for blocks\n   as large as a /24, which cannot be met by small sites.  As a\n\
    \   consequence, PI addresses are not available to many sites who wish to\n  \
    \ multihome.\n   Each site that uses PI addresses introduces an additional prefix\
    \ into\n   the global routing system.  If this scheme for multihoming became\n\
    \   widespread, it would present scaling concerns.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.2.  PA Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.2.  PA Addresses\n   The site uses PA addresses assigned by a single transit\
    \ provider.\n   The set of routes covering those PA addresses (the \"site route\
    \ set\")\n   is announced or propagated by one or more additional transit\n  \
    \ providers.  The transit provider which assigned the PA addresses (the\n   \"\
    primary transit provider\") originates a set of routes which cover\n   the site\
    \ route set.  The primary transit provider often originates or\n   propagates\
    \ the site route set as well as the covering aggregates.\n   The use of PA addresses\
    \ is applicable to sites whose addressing\n   requirements are not sufficient\
    \ to meet the requirements for PI\n   assignments by RIRs.  However, in the case\
    \ where the site route set\n   is to be announced or propagated by two or more\
    \ different transit\n   providers, common operational practice still dictates\
    \ minimum /24\n   prefixes, which may be larger than the allocation available\
    \ to small\n   sites.\n   There have been well-documented examples of sites filtering\
    \ long-\n   prefix routes which are covered by a transit-providers aggregate.\
    \  If\n   this practice were to become very widespread, it might limit the\n \
    \  effectiveness of multihoming using PA addresses.  However, limited\n   filtering\
    \ of this kind can be tolerated because the aggregate\n   announcements of the\
    \ primary transit provider should be sufficient to\n   attract traffic from autonomous\
    \ systems which do not accept the\n   covered site route set.  The more traffic\
    \ that follows the primary\n   transit provider's aggregate in the absence of\
    \ the covered, more-\n   specific route, the greater the reliance on that primary\
    \ transit\n   provider.  In some cases, this reliance might result in an effective\n\
    \   single point of failure.\n   Traffic following the primary transit provider's\
    \ aggregate routes may\n   still be able to reach the multihomed site, even in\
    \ the case where\n   the connection between the primary transit provider and the\
    \ site has\n   failed.  The site route set will still be propagating through the\n\
    \   site's other transit providers.  If that route set reaches (and is\n   accepted\
    \ by) the primary transit provider, connectivity for traffic\n   following the\
    \ aggregate route will be preserved.\n   Sites that use PA addresses are usually\
    \ obliged to renumber if they\n   decide not to retain connectivity to the primary\
    \ transit provider.\n   While this is a common requirement for all sites using\
    \ PA addresses\n   (and not just those that are multihomed), it is one that may\
    \ have\n   more frequent impact on sites whose motivation to multihome is to\n\
    \   facilitate changes of ISP.  A multihomed site using PA addresses can\n   still\
    \ add or drop other service providers without having to renumber.\n"

- title: 3.1.2.1.  Consistent Origin AS
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.1.  Consistent Origin AS\n   A multihomed site may choose to announce routes\
    \ to two or more\n   transit providers from a globally-unique Autonomous System\
    \ (AS)\n   number assigned to the site.  This causes the origin of the route to\n\
    \   appear consistent when viewed from all parts of the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.2.  Inconsistent Origin AS
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.2.  Inconsistent Origin AS\n   A multihomed site may choose to use a private-use\
    \ AS number [RFC1930]\n   to originate routes to transit providers.  It is normal\
    \ practice for\n   private-use AS numbers to be stripped from AS_PATH attributes\
    \ before\n   they are allowed to propagate from transit providers towards peers.\n\
    \   Therefore, routes observed from other parts of the Internet may\n   appear\
    \ to have inconsistent origins.\n   When using private-use AS numbers, collisions\
    \ between the use of\n   individual numbers by different transit providers are\
    \ possible.\n   These collisions are arguably best avoided by not using private-use\n\
    \   AS numbers for applications which involve routing across\n   administrative\
    \ domain boundaries.\n   A multihomed site may request that their transit providers\
    \ each\n   originate the site's routes from the transit providers' ASes.\n   Dynamic\
    \ routing (for the purposes of withdrawing the site's route in\n   the event that\
    \ connectivity to the site is lost) is still possible,\n   in this case, using\
    \ the transit providers' internal routing systems\n   to trigger the externally-visible\
    \ announcements.\n   Operational troubleshooting is facilitated by the use of\
    \ a consistent\n   origin AS.  This allows import policies to be based on a route's\
    \ true\n   origin rather than on intermediate routing details, which may change\n\
    \   (e.g., as transit providers are added and dropped by the multihomed\n   site).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Multiple Attachments to a Single Transit Provider
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Multiple Attachments to a Single Transit Provider\n   Multihoming can be\
    \ achieved through multiple connections to a single\n   transit provider.  This\
    \ imposes no additional load on the global\n   routing table beyond that involved\
    \ in the site being single-attached.\n   A site that has solved its multihoming\
    \ needs in this way is commonly\n   referred to as \"multi-attached\".\n   It\
    \ is not a requirement that the multi-attached site exchange routing\n   information\
    \ with its transit provider using BGP.  However, in the\n   event of failure,\
    \ some mechanism for re-routing inbound and outbound\n   traffic over remaining\
    \ circuits is required.  BGP is often used for\n   this purpose.\n   Multi-attached\
    \ sites gain no advantages from using PI addresses or\n   (where BGP is used)\
    \ globally-unique AS numbers, and have no need to\n   be able to justify address\
    \ assignments of a particular minimum size.\n   However, multi-attachment does\
    \ not protect a site from the failure of\n   the single transit provider.\n"
- title: 3.3.  NAT- or RFC2260-based Multihoming
  contents:
  - "3.3.  NAT- or RFC2260-based Multihoming\n   This method uses PA addresses assigned\
    \ by each transit provider to\n   which the site is connected.  The addresses\
    \ are either allocated to\n   individual hosts within the network according to\
    \ [RFC2260], or the\n   site uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to translate\
    \ the various\n   provider addresses into a single set of private-use addresses\n\
    \   [RFC1918] within the site.  The site is effectively singlehomed to\n   more\
    \ than one transit provider.  None of the transit providers need\n   to make any\
    \ accommodations beyond those typically made for a non-\n   multihomed customer.\n\
    \   This approach accommodates a wide range of sites, from residential\n   Internet\
    \ users to very large enterprises, requires no PI addresses or\n   AS numbers,\
    \ and imposes no additional load on the Internet's global\n   routing system.\
    \  However, it does not address several common\n   motivations for multihoming,\
    \ most notably transport-layer\n   survivability.\n"

    \  Detailed\n   descriptions and rationale for these goals can be found in that\n\
    \   document.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Redundancy
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Redundancy\n   All the methods described provide redundancy, which can\
    \ protect a\n   site from some single-point failures.  The degree of protection\n\
    \   depends on the choice of transit providers and the methods used to\n   interconnect\
    \ the site to those transit providers.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Load Sharing
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Load Sharing\n   All of the methods described provide some measure of load-sharing\n\
    \   capability.  Outbound traffic can be shared across ISPs using\n   appropriate\
    \ exit selection policies; inbound traffic can be\n   distributed using appropriate\
    \ export policies designed to influence\n   the exit selection of remote sites\
    \ sending traffic back towards the\n   multihomed site.\n   In the case of RFC2260/NAT\
    \ multihoming, distribution of inbound\n   traffic is controlled by address selection\
    \ on the host or NAT.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Performance
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Performance\n   BGP-speaking sites can employ import policies that cause\
    \ exit\n   selection to avoid paths known to be problematic.  For inbound\n  \
    \ traffic, sites can often employ route export policy, which affords\n   different\
    \ treatment of traffic towards particular address ranges\n   within their network.\n\
    \   It should be noted that this is not a comprehensive capability.  In\n   general,\
    \ there are many traffic engineering goals which can only be\n   loosely approximated\
    \ using this approach.\n   In the case of RFC2260/NAT multihoming in the absence\
    \ of BGP routing\n   information, management of outbound traffic is not possible.\
    \  The\n   path taken by inbound traffic for a particular session can be\n   controlled\
    \ by source address selection on the host or NAT.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Policy
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Policy\n   In some circumstances, it is possible to route traffic of a\n\
    \   particular type (e.g., protocol) via particular transit providers.\n   This\
    \ can be done if the devices in the site which source or sink that\n   traffic\
    \ can be isolated to a set of addresses to which a special\n   export policy can\
    \ be applied.\n   An example of this capability is the grouping of budget, best-effort\n\
    \   Internet customers into a particular range of addresses that is\n   covered\
    \ by a route which is announced preferentially over a single,\n   low-quality\
    \ transit path.\n   In the case of RFC2260/NAT multihoming, policies such as those\n\
    \   described here can be accommodated by appropriate address selection\n   on\
    \ the host or NAT.  More flexible implementations may be possible\n   for sessions\
    \ originated from the multihomed site by selecting an\n   appropriate source address\
    \ on a host or NAT, according to criteria\n   such as transport-layer protocols\
    \ and addresses (ports).\n"

    \ event,\n   sessions may time out.\n   Transport-layer sessions will not, in\
    \ general, survive over a re-\n   homing event when using RFC2260/NAT multihoming.\
    \  Transport protocols\n   which support multiple volatile endpoint addresses\

    \ hardware requirements it imposes and the impact on the stability of\n   the\
    \ routing system.  This issue is discussed in greater detail in\n   [RFC3221].\n\
    \   Of the methods presented in this document, RFC2260/NAT multihoming\n   and\
    \ multi-attaching to a single transit provider provide no\n   additional state\
    \ to be held in the global routing system.  All other\n   strategies contribute\
    \ to routing system state bloat.\n   Globally-unique AS numbers are a finite resource.\
