- title: 1.2.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Background\n   Traditional transport technologies include SONET/SDH, TDM,\
    \ and ATM.\n   There is a transition away from these transport technologies to\
    \ new\n   packet transport technologies.  In addition to the increasing demand\n\
    \   for bandwidth, packet transport technologies offer the following key\n   advantages:\n\
    \   Bandwidth efficiency:\n   Traditional TDM transport technologies support fixed\
    \ bandwidth with\n   no statistical multiplexing.  The bandwidth is reserved in\
    \ the\n   transport network, regardless of whether or not it is used by the\n\
    \   client.  In contrast, packet technologies support statistical\n   multiplexing.\
    \  This is the most important motivation for the\n   transition from traditional\
    \ transport technologies to packet\n   transport technologies.  The proliferation\
    \ of new distributed\n   applications that communicate with servers over the network\
    \ in a\n   bursty fashion has been driving the adoption of packet transport\n\
    \   techniques, since packet multiplexing of traffic from bursty sources\n   provides\
    \ more efficient use of bandwidth than traditional circuit-\n   based TDM technologies.\n\
    \   Flexible data rate connections:\n   The granularity of data rate connections\
    \ of traditional transport\n   technologies is limited to the rigid Plesiochronous\
    \ Digital Hierarchy\n   (PDH) hierarchy (e.g., DS1, DS3) or SONET hierarchy (e.g.,\
    \ OC3,\n   OC12).  Packet technologies support flexible data rate connections.\n\
    \   The support of finer data rate granularity is particularly important\n   for\
    \ today's wireline and wireless services and applications.\n   QoS support:\n\
    \   Traditional transport technologies (such as TDM) provide bandwidth\n   guarantees,\
    \ but they are unaware of the types of traffic they carry.\n   They are not packet\
    \ aware and do not provide packet-level services.\n   Packet transport can provide\
    \ the differentiated services capability\n   needed to support oversubscription\
    \ and to deal with traffic\n   prioritization upon congestion: issues that arise\
    \ only in packet\n   networks.\n   The root cause for transport moving to packet\
    \ transport is the shift\n   of applications from TDM to packet -- for example,\
    \ Voice TDM to VoIP,\n   Video to Video over IP, TDM access lines to Ethernet,\
    \ and TDM VPNs to\n   IP VPNs and Ethernet VPNs.  In addition, network convergence\
    \ and\n   technology refreshes contribute to the demand for a common and\n   flexible\
    \ infrastructure that provides multiple services.\n   As part of the MPLS family,\
    \ MPLS-TP complements existing IP/MPLS\n   technologies; it closes the gaps in\
    \ the traditional access and\n   aggregation transport to enable end-to-end packet\
    \ technology\n   solutions in a cost efficient, reliable, and interoperable manner.\n\
    \   After several years of industry debate on which packet technology to\n   use,\
    \ MPLS-TP has emerged as the next generation transport technology\n   of choice\
    \ for many Service Providers worldwide.\n   The Unified MPLS strategy -- using\
    \ MPLS from core to aggregation and\n   access (e.g., IP/MPLS in the core, IP/MPLS\
    \ or MPLS-TP in aggregation\n   and access) -- appears to be very attractive to\
    \ many SPs.  It\n   streamlines the operation, reduces the overall complexity,\
    \ and\n   improves end-to-end convergence.  It leverages the MPLS experience\n\
    \   and enhances the ability to support revenue-generating services.\n   MPLS-TP\
    \ is a subset of MPLS functions that meet the packet transport\n   requirements\
    \ defined in [RFC5654].  This subset includes: MPLS data\n   forwarding, pseudowire\
    \ encapsulation for circuit emulation, and\n   dynamic control plane using GMPLS\
    \ control for LSP and tLDP for\n   pseudowire (PW).  MPLS-TP also extends previous\
    \ MPLS OAM functions,\n   such as the BFD extension for proactive Connectivity\
    \ Check and\n   Connectivity Verification (CC-V) [RFC6428], Remote Defect Indication\n\
    \   (RDI) [RFC6428], and LSP Ping Extension for on-demand CC-V [RFC6426].\n  \
    \ New tools have been defined for alarm suppression with Alarm\n   Indication\
    \ Signal (AIS) [RFC6427] and switch-over triggering with\n   Link Down Indication\
    \ (LDI) [RFC6427].  Note that since the MPLS OAM\n   feature extensions defined\
    \ through the process of MPLS-TP development\n   are part of the MPLS family,\
    \ the applicability is general to MPLS and\n   not limited to MPLS-TP.\n   The\
    \ requirements of MPLS-TP are provided in the MPLS-TP requirements\n   document\
    \ [RFC5654], and the architectural framework is defined in the\n   MPLS-TP framework\
    \ document [RFC5921].  This document's intent is to\n   provide the use case studies\
    \ and design considerations from a\n   practical point of view based on Service\
    \ Providers' deployments plans\n   as well as actual deployments.\n   The most\
    \ common use cases for MPLS-TP include Metro access and\n   aggregation, mobile\
    \ backhaul, and packet optical transport.  MPLS-TP\n   data-plane architecture,\
    \ path protection mechanisms, and OAM\n   functionality are used to support these\
    \ deployment scenarios.\n   The design considerations discussed in this document\
    \ include the role\n   of MPLS-TP in the network, provisioning options, standards\n\
    \   compliance, end-to-end forwarding and OAM consistency, compatibility\n   with\
    \ existing IP/MPLS networks, and optimization vs. simplicity\n   design trade-offs.\n"

    '
- title: 2.1.  Metro Access and Aggregation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Metro Access and Aggregation\n   The use of MPLS-TP for Metro access and\
    \ aggregation transport is the\n   most common deployment scenario observed in\
    \ the field.\n   Some operators are building green-field access and aggregation\n\
    \   transport infrastructure, while others are upgrading or replacing\n   their\
    \ existing transport infrastructure with new packet technologies.\n   The existing\
    \ legacy access and aggregation networks are usually based\n   on TDM or ATM technologies.\
    \  Some operators are replacing these\n   networks with MPLS-TP technologies,\
    \ since legacy ATM/TDM aggregation\n   and access are becoming inadequate to support\
    \ the rapid business\n   growth and too expensive to maintain.  In addition, in\
    \ many cases the\n   legacy devices are facing End of Sale and End of Life issues.\
    \  As\n   operators must move forward with the next-generation packet\n   technology,\
    \ the adoption of MPLS-TP in access and aggregation becomes\n   a natural choice.\
    \  The statistical multiplexing in MPLS-TP helps to\n   achieve higher efficiency\
    \ compared with the time-division scheme in\n   the legacy technologies.  MPLS-TP\
    \ OAM tools and protection mechanisms\n   help to maintain high reliability of\
    \ transport networks and achieve\n   fast recovery.\n   As most Service Providers'\
    \ core networks are MPLS enabled, extending\n   the MPLS technology to the aggregation\
    \ and access transport networks\n   with a Unified MPLS strategy is very attractive\
    \ to many Service\n   Providers.  Unified MPLS strategy in this document means\
    \ having\n   end-to-end MPLS technologies through core, aggregation, and access.\n\
    \   It reduces operating expenses by streamlining the operation and\n   leveraging\
    \ the operational experience already gained with MPLS\n   technologies; it also\
    \ improves network efficiency and reduces end-to-\n   end convergence time.\n\
    \   The requirements from the SPs for ATM/TDM aggregation replacement\n   often\
    \ include:\n   -  maintaining the previous operational model, which means providing\n\
    \      a similar user experience in NMS,\n   -  supporting the existing access\
    \ network (e.g., Ethernet, ADSL, ATM,\n      TDM, etc.) and connections with the\
    \ core networks, and\n   -  supporting the same operational capabilities and services\
    \ (L3VPN,\n      L2VPN, E-LINE/E-LAN/E-VLAN, Dedicated Line, etc.).\n   MPLS-TP\
    \ can meet these requirements and, in general, the requirements\n   defined in\
    \ [RFC5654] to support a smooth transition.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Packet Optical Transport
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Packet Optical Transport\n   Many SPs' transport networks consist of both\
    \ packet and optical\n   portions.  The transport operators are typically sensitive\
    \ to network\n   deployment cost and operational simplicity.  MPLS-TP supports\
    \ both\n   static provisioning through NMS and dynamic provisioning via the\n\
    \   GMPLS control plane.  As such, it is viewed as a natural fit in\n   transport\
    \ networks where the operators can utilize the MPLS-TP LSPs\n   (including the\
    \ ones statically provisioned) to manage user traffic as\n   \"circuits\" in both\
    \ packet and optical networks.  Also, when the\n   operators are ready, they can\
    \ migrate the network to use the dynamic\n   control plane for greater efficiency.\n\
    \   Among other attributes, bandwidth management, protection/recovery,\n   and\
    \ OAM are critical in packet/optical transport networks.  In the\n   context of\
    \ MPLS-TP, LSPs may be associated with bandwidth allocation\n   policies.  OAM\
    \ is to be performed on each individual LSP.  For some\n   of the performance\
    \ monitoring functions, the OAM mechanisms need to\n   be able to transmit and\
    \ process OAM packets at very high frequency.\n   An overview of the MPLS-TP OAM\
    \ toolset is found in [RFC6669].\n   Protection, as defined in [RFC6372], is another\
    \ important element in\n   transport networks.  Typically, ring and linear protection\
    \ can be\n   readily applied in metro networks.  However, as long-haul networks\n\
    \   are sensitive to bandwidth cost and tend to have mesh-like topology,\n   shared\
    \ mesh protection is becoming increasingly important.\n   In some cases, SPs plan\
    \ to deploy MPLS-TP from their long-haul\n   optical packet transport all the\
    \ way to the aggregation and access in\n   their networks.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Mobile Backhaul
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Mobile Backhaul\n   Wireless communication is one of the fastest growing\
    \ areas in\n   communication worldwide.  In some regions, the tremendous mobile\n\
    \   growth is fueled by the lack of existing landline and cable\n   infrastructure.\
    \  In other regions, the introduction of smart phones\n   is quickly driving mobile\
    \ data traffic to become the primary mobile\n   bandwidth consumer (some SPs have\
    \ already observed that more than 85%\n   of total mobile traffic is data traffic).\
    \  MPLS-TP is viewed as a\n   suitable technology for mobile backhaul.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.  2G and 3G Mobile Backhaul
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  2G and 3G Mobile Backhaul\n   MPLS-TP is commonly viewed as a very good\
    \ fit for 2G/3G mobile\n   backhaul.  2G (GSM/CDMA) and 3G (UMTS/HSPA/1xEVDO)\
    \ mobile backhaul\n   networks are still currently dominating the mobile infrastructure.\n\
    \   The connectivity for 2G/3G networks is point to point (P2P).  The\n   logical\
    \ connections have a hub-and-spoke configuration.  Networks are\n   physically\
    \ constructed using a star or ring topology.  In the Radio\n   Access Network\
    \ (RAN), each mobile Base Transceiver Station (BTS/Node\n   B) is communicating\
    \ with a Base Station Controller (BSC) or Radio\n   Network Controller (RNC).\
    \  These connections are often statically set\n   up.\n   Hierarchical or centralized\
    \ architectures are often used for\n   pre-aggregation and aggregation layers.\
    \  Each aggregation network\n   interconnects with multiple access networks. \
    \ For example, a single\n   aggregation ring could aggregate traffic for 10 access\
    \ rings with a\n   total of 100 base stations.\n   The technology used today is\
    \ largely ATM based.  Mobile providers are\n   replacing the ATM RAN infrastructure\
    \ with newer packet technologies.\n   IP RAN networks with IP/MPLS technologies\
    \ are deployed today by many\n   SPs with great success.  MPLS-TP is another suitable\
    \ choice for\n   Mobile RAN.  The P2P connections from base station to Radio\n\
    \   Controller can be set statically to mimic the operation of today's\n   RAN\
    \ environments; in-band OAM and deterministic path protection can\n   support\
    \ fast failure detection and switch-over to satisfy service\n   level agreements\
    \ (SLAs).  Bidirectional LSPs may help to simplify the\n   provisioning process.\
    \  The deterministic nature of MPLS-TP LSP setup\n   can also support packet-based\
    \ synchronization to maintain predictable\n   performance regarding packet delay\
    \ and jitter.  The traffic-\n   engineered and co-routed bidirectional properties\
    \ of an MPLS-TP LSP\n   are of benefit in transporting packet-based Time and Frequency\n\
    \   Synchronization (TFS) protocols, such as [TICTOC].  However, the\n   choice\
    \ between an external, physical-layer method or a packet-based\n   TFS method\
    \ is network dependent and thus is out of scope of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  4G/LTE Mobile Backhaul
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  4G/LTE Mobile Backhaul\n   One key difference between LTE and 2G/3G mobile\
    \ networks is that the\n   logical connection in LTE is a mesh, while in 2G/3G\
    \ it is a P2P star.\n   In LTE, each base station (eNB/BTS) communicates with\
    \ multiple\n   network controllers (e.g., Packet Data Network Gateway, Packet\
    \ Data\n   Network Serving Gateway, Access Service Network Gateway), and the\n\
    \   radio elements communicate with one another for signal exchange and\n   traffic\
    \ offload to wireless or wireline infrastructures.\n   IP/MPLS has a great advantage\
    \ in any-to-any connectivity\n   environments.  Thus, the use of mature IP or\
    \ L3VPN technologies is\n   particularly common in the design of an SP's LTE deployment\
    \ plans.\n   The extended OAM functions defined in MPLS-TP, such as in-band OAM\n\
    \   and path protection mechanisms, bring additional advantages to\n   support\
    \ SLAs.  The dynamic control plane with GMPLS signaling is\n   especially suited\
    \ for the mesh environment, to support dynamic\n   topology changes and network\
    \ optimization.\n   Some operators are using the same model as in 2G and 3G mobile\n\
    \   backhaul, which uses IP/MPLS in the core and MPLS-TP with static\n   provisioning\
    \ (through NMS) in aggregation and access.  The reasoning\n   is as follows: currently,\
    \ the X2 traffic load in LTE networks may be\n   a very small percentage of the\
    \ total traffic.  For example, one large\n   mobile operator observed that X2\
    \ traffic was less than one percent of\n   the total S1 traffic.  Therefore, optimizing\
    \ the X2 traffic may not\n   be the design objective in this case.  The X2 traffic\
    \ can be carried\n   through the same static tunnels together with the S1 traffic\
    \ in the\n   aggregation and access networks and further forwarded across the\n\
    \   IP/MPLS core.  In addition, mesh protection may be more efficient\n   with\
    \ regard to bandwidth utilization, but linear protection and ring\n   protection\
    \ are often considered simpler by some operators from the\n   point of view of\
    \ operation maintenance and troubleshooting, and so\n   are widely deployed. \
    \ In general, using MPLS-TP with static\n   provisioning for LTE backhaul is a\
    \ viable option.  The design\n   objective of using this approach is to keep the\
    \ operation simple and\n   use a common model for mobile backhaul, especially\
    \ during the\n   transition period.\n   The TFS considerations stated in Section\
    \ 2.3.1 apply to the 4G/LTE\n   mobile backhaul case as well.\n"

  - "3.1.  The Role of MPLS-TP\n   The role of MPLS-TP is to provide a solution to\
    \ help evolve\n   traditional transport towards packet transport networks.  It\
    \ is\n   designed to support the transport characteristics and behavior\n   described\
    \ in [RFC5654].  The primary use of MPLS-TP is largely to\n   replace legacy transport\
    \ technologies, such as SONET/SDH.  MPLS-TP is\n   not designed to replace the\
    \ service support capabilities of IP/MPLS,\n   such as L2VPN, L3VPN, IPTV, Mobile\

    \ to the transport-centric operational\n   model (e.g., NMS configuration without\
    \ control plane) typically\n   prefer the static provisioning mode.  This is the\
    \ most common choice\n   in current deployments.  The dynamic provisioning mode\
    \ can be more\n   powerful, but it is more suited to operators who are familiar\
    \ with\n   the operation and maintenance of IP/MPLS technologies or are ready\
    \ to\n   step up through training and planned transition.\n   There may also be\
    \ cases where operators choose to use the combination\n   of both modes.  This\
    \ is appropriate when parts of the network are\n   provisioned in a static fashion,\
    \ and other parts are controlled by\n   dynamic signaling.  This combination may\
    \ also be used to transition\n   from static provisioning to dynamic control plane.\n"

    \ highly desirable in order to\n   enable Service Providers to deploy an end-to-end\
    \ MPLS solution.  As\n   MPLS-TP adds OAM function to the MPLS toolkit, it cannot\
    \ be expected\n   that a full-function end-to-end LSP with MPLS-TP OAM can be\
    \ achieved\n   when the LSP traverses a legacy MPLS/IP core.  Although it may\
    \ be\n   possible to select a subset of MPLS-TP OAM that can be gatewayed to\n\
    \   the legacy MPLS/IP OAM, a better solution is achieved by tunneling\n   the\
    \ MPLS-TP LSP over the legacy MPLS/IP network.  In that mode of\n   operation,\
    \ legacy OAM may be run on the tunnel in the core, and the\n   tunnel endpoints\
    \ may report issues in as much detail as possible to\n   the MIPs in the MPLS-TP\
    \ LSP.  Note that over time it is expected that\n   routers in the MPLS/IP core\
    \ will be upgraded to fully support MPLS-TP\n   features.  Once this has occurred,\
    \ it will be possible to run\n   end-to-end MPLS-TP LSPs seamlessly across the\

- title: 3.5.  PW Design Considerations in MPLS-TP Networks
  contents:
  - "3.5.  PW Design Considerations in MPLS-TP Networks\n   In general, PWs in MPLS-TP\
    \ work the same as in IP/MPLS networks.\n   Both Single-Segment PW (SS-PW) and\
    \ Multi-Segment PW (MS-PW) are\n   supported.  For dynamic control plane, Targeted\
    \ LDP (tLDP) is used.\n   In static provisioning mode, PW status is a new PW OAM\
    \ feature for\n   failure notification.  In addition, both directions of a PW\
    \ must be\n   bound to the same transport bidirectional LSP.\n   In the common\
    \ network topology involving multi-tier rings, the design\n   choice is between\
    \ using SS-PW or MS-PW.  This is not a discussion\n   unique to MPLS-TP, as it\
    \ applies to PW design in general.  However,\n   it is relevant here, since MPLS-TP\
    \ is more sensitive to the\n   operational complexities, as noted by operators.\
    \  If MS-PW is used,\n   Switching PE (S-PE) must be deployed to connect the rings.\
    \  The\n   advantage of this choice is that it provides domain isolation, which\n\
    \   in turn facilitates troubleshooting and allows for faster PW failure\n   recovery.\
    \  On the other hand, the disadvantage of using S-PE is that\n   it adds more\
    \ complexity.  Using SS-PW is simpler, since it does not\n   require S-PEs, but\
    \ it is less efficient because the paths across\n   primary and secondary rings\
    \ are longer.  If operational simplicity is\n   a higher priority, some SPs choose\
    \ SS-PW.\n   Another design trade-off is whether to use PW protection in addition\n\
    \   to LSP protection or rely solely on LSP protection.  When the MPLS-TP\n  \
    \ LSPs are protected, if the working LSP fails, the protecting LSP\n   assures\
    \ that the connectivity is maintained and the PW is not\n   impacted.  However,\
    \ in the case of simultaneous failure of both the\n   working and protecting LSPs,\
    \ the attached PW would fail.  By adding\n   PW protection and attaching the protecting\
    \ PW to a diverse LSP not in\n   the same Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG), the PW\
    \ is protected even when\n   the primary PW fails.  Clearly, using PW protection\
    \ adds considerably\n   more complexity and resource usage, and thus operators\
    \ often may\n   choose not to use it and consider protection against a single\
    \ point\n   of failure as sufficient.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.6.  Proactive and On-Demand MPLS-TP OAM Tools\n   MPLS-TP provides both proactive\
    \ and on-demand OAM tools.  As a\n   proactive OAM fault management tool, BFD\
    \ Connectivity Check (CC) can\n   be sent at regular intervals for Connectivity\
    \ Check; three (or a\n   configurable number) of missed CC messages can trigger\
    \ the failure\n   protection switch-over.  BFD sessions are configured for both\
    \ working\n   and protecting LSPs.\n   A design decision is choosing the value\
    \ of the BFD CC interval.  The\n   shorter the interval, the faster the detection\
    \ time is, but also the\n   higher the resource utilization is.  The proper value\
    \ depends on the\n   application and the service needs, as well as the protection\n\
    \   mechanism provided at the lower layer.\n   As an on-demand OAM fault management\
    \ mechanism (for example, when\n   there is a fiber cut), a Link Down Indication\
    \ (LDI) message [RFC6427]\n   can be generated from the failure point and propagated\
    \ to the\n   Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs) to trigger immediate\n\
    \   switch-over from working to protecting path.  An Alarm Indication\n   Signal\
    \ (AIS) can be propagated from the Maintenance Entity Group\n   Intermediate Point\
    \ (MIP) to the MEPs for alarm suppression.\n   In general, both proactive and\
    \ on-demand OAM tools should be enabled\n   to guarantee short switch-over times.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Under the use case of Metro access and aggregation,\
    \ in the scenario\n   where some of the access equipment is placed in facilities\
    \ not owned\n   by the SP, the static provisioning mode of MPLS-TP is often preferred\n\
    \   over the control-plane option because it eliminates the possibility\n   of\
    \ a control-plane attack, which may potentially impact the whole\n   network.\
    \  This scenario falls into the Security Reference Model 2 as\n   described in\
    \ [RFC6941].\n   Similar location issues apply to the mobile use cases since equipment\n\
    \   is often placed in remote and outdoor environment, which can increase\n  \
    \ the risk of unauthorized access to the equipment.\n   In general, NMS access\
    \ can be a common point of attack in all MPLS-TP\n   use cases, and attacks to\
    \ GAL or G-ACh are unique security threats to\n   MPLS-TP.  The MPLS-TP security\
    \ considerations are discussed in the\n   MPLS-TP security framework [RFC6941].\
