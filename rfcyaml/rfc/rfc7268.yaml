    - "2.1.  Allowed-Called-Station-Id\n   Description\n      The Allowed-Called-Station-Id
      Attribute allows the RADIUS server\n      to specify the authenticator MAC addresses
      and/or networks to\n      which the user is allowed to connect.  One or more
      Allowed-Called-\n      Station-Id Attributes MAY be included in an Access-Accept,
      CoA-\n      Request, or Accounting-Request packet.\n      The Allowed-Called-Station-Id
      Attribute can be useful in\n      situations where pre-authentication is supported
      (e.g., IEEE\n      802.11 pre-authentication).  In these scenarios, a Called-Station-\n
      \     Id Attribute typically will not be included within the Access-\n      Request
      so that the RADIUS server will not know the network that\n      the user is
      attempting to access.  The Allowed-Called-Station-Id\n      enables the RADIUS
      server to restrict the networks and attachment\n      points to which the user
      can subsequently connect.\n      A summary of the Allowed-Called-Station-Id
      Attribute format is\n      shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left
      to right.\n       0                   1                   2                   3\n
      \      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
      \     |     Type      |  Length       |            String...\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
      \  Type\n      174\n   Length\n      >=3\n   String\n      The String field
      is one or more octets, specifying a Called-\n      Station-Id that the user
      MAY connect to; if the Called-Station-Id\n      that the user connects to does
      not match one of the Allowed-\n      Called-Station-Id Attributes, the Network
      Access Server (NAS) MUST\n      NOT permit the user to access the network.\n
      \     In the case of IEEE 802, the Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute\n      is
      used to store the Medium Access Control (MAC) address,\n      represented as
      an uppercase ASCII character string in Canonical\n      format and with octet
      values separated by a \"-\", for example,\n      \"00-10-A4-23-19-C0\".  Where
      restrictions on both the network and\n      authenticator MAC address usage
      are intended, the network name\n      MUST be appended to the authenticator
      MAC address, separated from\n      the MAC address with a \":\", for example,
      \"00-10-A4-23-19-C0:AP1\".\n      Where no MAC address restriction is intended,
      the MAC address\n      field MUST be omitted, but \":\" and the network name
      field MUST be\n      included, for example, \":AP1\".\n      Within IEEE 802.11
      [IEEE-802.11], the Service Set Identifier\n      (SSID) constitutes the network
      name; within IEEE 802.1X\n      [IEEE-802.1X] wired networks, the Network-Id
      Name (NID-Name)\n      constitutes the network name.  Since a NID-Name can be
      up to 253\n      octets in length, when used with [IEEE-802.1X] wired networks,\n
      \     there may not be sufficient room within the Allowed-Called-\n      Station-Id
      Attribute to include both a MAC address and a network\n      name.  However,
      as the Allowed-Called-Station-Id Attribute is\n      expected to be used largely
      in wireless access scenarios, this\n      restriction is not considered serious.\n"

    - "2.2.  EAP-Key-Name\n   Description\n      The EAP-Key-Name Attribute, defined
      in \"Diameter Extensible\n      Authentication Protocol (EAP) Application\"
      [RFC4072], contains the\n      EAP Session-Id, as described in \"Extensible
      Authentication\n      Protocol (EAP) Key Management Framework\" [RFC5247].  Exactly
      how\n      this attribute is used depends on the link layer in question.\n      It
      should be noted that not all link layers use this name.  An\n      EAP-Key-Name
      Attribute MAY be included within Access-Request,\n      Access-Accept, and CoA-Request
      packets.  A summary of the EAP-Key-\n      Name Attribute format is shown below.
      \ The fields are transmitted\n      from left to right.\n       0                   1

      \  Type\n      102 [RFC4072]\n   Length\n      >=3\n   String\n      The String
      field is one or more octets, containing the EAP\n      Session-Id, as defined
      in \"Extensible Authentication Protocol\n      (EAP) Key Management Framework\"
      [RFC5247].  Since the NAS operates\n      as a pass-through in EAP, it cannot
      know the EAP Session-Id before\n      receiving it from the RADIUS server.  As
      a result, an EAP-Key-Name\n      Attribute sent in an Access-Request MUST only
      contain a single NUL\n      character.  A RADIUS server receiving an Access-Request
      with an\n      EAP-Key-Name Attribute containing anything other than a single
      NUL\n      character MUST silently discard the attribute.  In addition, the\n
      \     RADIUS server SHOULD include this attribute in an Access-Accept or\n      CoA-Request
      only if an EAP-Key-Name Attribute was present in the\n      Access-Request.
      \ Since a NAS will typically only include an EAP-\n      Key-Name Attribute
      in an Access-Request in situations where the\n      attribute is required to
      provision service, if an EAP-Key-Name\n      Attribute is included in an Access-Request
      but is not present in\n      the Access-Accept, the NAS SHOULD treat the Access-Accept
      as\n      though it were an Access-Reject.  If an EAP-Key-Name Attribute was\n
      \     not present in the Access-Request but is included in the Access-\n      Accept,
      then the NAS SHOULD silently discard the EAP-Key-Name\n      Attribute.  As
      noted in Section 6.2.2 of [IEEE-802.1X], the\n      Connectivity Association
      Key Name (CKN) is derived from the EAP\n      Session-Id, and, as described
      in Section 9.3.3 of [IEEE-802.1X],\n      the CKN is subsequently used in the
      derivation of the Key\n      Encrypting Key (KEK) and the Integrity Check Value
      Key (ICK),\n      which protect the Secure Association Keys (SAKs) utilized
      by Media\n      Access Control Security (MACsec).  As a result, for the NAS
      to\n      acquire information needed in the MACsec Key Agreement (MKA)\n      exchange,
      it needs to include the EAP-Key-Name Attribute in the\n      Access-Request
      and receive it from the RADIUS server in the\n      Access-Accept.\n"

      a Peer-Id generated by the EAP\n      method.  Exactly how this name is used
      depends on the link layer\n      in question.  See [RFC5247] for more discussion.
      \ The EAP-Peer-Id\n      Attribute MAY be included in Access-Request, Access-Accept,
      and\n      Accounting-Request packets.  More than one EAP-Peer-Id Attribute\n
      \     MUST NOT be included in an Access-Request; one or more EAP-Peer-Id\n      Attributes
      MAY be included in an Access-Accept.\n      It should be noted that not all
      link layers use this name, and\n      existing EAP method implementations do
      not generate it.  Since the\n      NAS operates as a pass-through in EAP [RFC3748],
      it cannot know\n      the EAP-Peer-Id before receiving it from the RADIUS server.
      \ As a\n      result, an EAP-Peer-Id Attribute sent in an Access-Request MUST\n

      to utilize the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) derived as a\n      result of pre-authentication
      within the time specified by the\n      Preauth-Timeout Attribute, the PMK MAY

      (which is a maximum of 32 octets in\n      length), the NID-Name may be up to
      253 octets in length.\n      Consequently, if the MAC address is included within

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Since this document describes the use of RADIUS
    for purposes of\n   authentication, authorization, and accounting in IEEE 802
    networks,\n   it is vulnerable to all of the threats that are present in other\n
    \  RADIUS applications.  For a discussion of these threats, see\n   [RFC2607],
    [RFC2865], [RFC3162], [RFC3579], [RFC3580], and [RFC5176].\n   In particular,
    when RADIUS traffic is sent in the clear, the\n   attributes defined in this document
    can be obtained by an attacker\n   snooping the exchange between the RADIUS client
    and server.  As a\n   result, RADIUS confidentiality is desirable; for a review
    of RADIUS\n   security and crypto-agility requirements, see [RFC6421].\n   While
    it is possible for a RADIUS server to make decisions on whether\n   to accept
    or reject an Access-Request based on the values of the\n   WLAN-Pairwise-Cipher,
    WLAN-Group-Cipher, WLAN-AKM-Suite, WLAN-Group-\n   Mgmt-Cipher, and WLAN-RF-Band
    Attributes, the value of doing this is\n   limited.  In general, an Access-Reject
    should not be necessary,\n   except where Access Points and Stations are misconfigured
    so as to\n   enable connections to be made with unacceptable values.  Rather than\n
    \  rejecting access on an ongoing basis, users would be better served by\n   fixing
    the misconfiguration.\n   Where access does need to be rejected, the user should
    be provided\n   with an indication of why the problem has occurred, or else they
    are\n   likely to become frustrated.  For example, if the values of the WLAN-\n
    \  Pairwise-Cipher, WLAN-Group-Cipher, WLAN-AKM-Suite, or WLAN-Group-\n   Mgmt-Cipher
    Attributes included in the Access-Request are not\n   acceptable to the RADIUS
    server, then a WLAN-Reason-Code Attribute\n   with a value of 29 (Requested service
    rejected because of service\n   provider ciphersuite or AKM requirement) SHOULD
    be returned in the\n   Access-Reject.  Similarly, if the value of the WLAN-RF-Band
    Attribute\n   included in the Access-Request is not acceptable to the RADIUS\n
    \  server, then a WLAN-Reason-Code Attribute with a value of 11\n   (Disassociated
    because the information in the Supported Channels\n   element is unacceptable)
    SHOULD be returned in the Access-Reject.\n"
