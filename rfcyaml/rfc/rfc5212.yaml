  - "Abstract\n   Most of the initial efforts to utilize Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\
    \ have\n   been related to environments hosting devices with a single switching\n\
    \   capability.  The complexity raised by the control of such data planes\n  \
    \ is similar to that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks.  By extending\n   MPLS\
    \ to support multiple switching technologies, GMPLS provides a\n   comprehensive\
    \ framework for the control of a multi-layered network of\n   either a single\
    \ switching technology or multiple switching\n   technologies.\n   In GMPLS, a\
    \ switching technology domain defines a region, and a\n   network of multiple\
    \ switching types is referred to in this document\n   as a multi-region network\
    \ (MRN).  When referring in general to a\n   layered network, which may consist\
    \ of either single or multiple\n   regions, this document uses the term multi-layer\
    \ network (MLN).  This\n   document defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region\
    \ / multi-\n   layer networks and lists a set of functional requirements.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS to handle multiple\
    \ switching\n   technologies: packet switching, Layer-2 switching, TDM (Time-Division\n\
    \   Multiplexing) switching, wavelength switching, and fiber switching\n   (see\
    \ [RFC3945]).  The Interface Switching Capability (ISC) concept is\n   introduced\
    \ for these switching technologies and is designated as\n   follows: PSC (packet\
    \ switch capable), L2SC (Layer-2 switch capable),\n   TDM capable, LSC (lambda\
    \ switch capable), and FSC (fiber switch\n   capable).\n   The representation,\
    \ in a GMPLS control plane, of a switching\n   technology domain is referred to\
    \ as a region [RFC4206].  A switching\n   type describes the ability of a node\
    \ to forward data of a particular\n   data plane technology, and uniquely identifies\
    \ a network region.  A\n   layer describes a data plane switching granularity\
    \ level (e.g., VC4,\n   VC-12).  A data plane layer is associated with a region\
    \ in the\n   control plane (e.g., VC4 is associated with TDM, MPLS is associated\n\
    \   with PSC).  However, more than one data plane layer can be associated\n  \
    \ with the same region (e.g., both VC4 and VC12 are associated with\n   TDM).\
    \  Thus, a control plane region, identified by its switching type\n   value (e.g.,\
    \ TDM), can be sub-divided into smaller-granularity\n   component networks based\
    \ on \"data plane switching layers\".  The\n   Interface Switching Capability\
    \ Descriptor (ISCD) [RFC4202],\n   identifying the interface switching capability\
    \ (ISC), the encoding\n   type, and the switching bandwidth granularity, enables\
    \ the\n   characterization of the associated layers.\n   In this document, we\
    \ define a multi-layer network (MLN) to be a\n   Traffic Engineering (TE) domain\
    \ comprising multiple data plane\n   switching layers either of the same ISC (e.g.,\
    \ TDM) or different ISC\n   (e.g., TDM and PSC) and controlled by a single GMPLS\
    \ control plane\n   instance.  We further define a particular case of MLNs.  A\
    \ multi-\n   region network (MRN) is defined as a TE domain supporting at least\n\
    \   two different switching types (e.g., PSC and TDM), either hosted on\n   the\
    \ same device or on different ones, and under the control of a\n   single GMPLS\
    \ control plane instance.\n   MLNs can be further categorized according to the\
    \ distribution of the\n   ISCs among the Label Switching Routers (LSRs):\n   -\
    \ Each LSR may support just one ISC.\n     Such LSRs are known as single-switching-type-capable\
    \ LSRs.  The MLN\n     may comprise a set of single-switching-type-capable LSRs\
    \ some of\n     which support different ISCs.\n   - Each LSR may support more\
    \ than one ISC at the same time.\n     Such LSRs are known as multi-switching-type-capable\
    \ LSRs, and can\n     be further classified as either \"simplex\" or \"hybrid\"\
    \ nodes as\n     defined in Section 4.2.\n   - The MLN may be constructed from\
    \ any combination of single-\n     switching-type-capable LSRs and multi-switching-type-capable\
    \ LSRs.\n   Since GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of\n\
    \   different switching capabilities, a single GMPLS instance may be used\n  \
    \ to control the MLN/MRN.  This enables rapid service provisioning and\n   efficient\
    \ traffic engineering across all switching capabilities.  In\n   such networks,\
    \ TE links are consolidated into a single Traffic\n   Engineering Database (TED).\
    \  Since this TED contains the information\n   relative to all the different regions\
    \ and layers existing in the\n   network, a path across multiple regions or layers\
    \ can be computed\n   using this TED.  Thus, optimization of network resources\
    \ can be\n   achieved across the whole MLN/MRN.\n   Consider, for example, a MRN\
    \ consisting of packet-switch-capable\n   routers and TDM cross-connects.  Assume\
    \ that a packet Label Switched\n   Path (LSP) is routed between source and destination\
    \ packet-switch-\n   capable routers, and that the LSP can be routed across the\
    \ PSC region\n   (i.e., utilizing only resources of the packet region topology).\
    \  If\n   the performance objective for the packet LSP is not satisfied, new TE\n\
    \   links may be created between the packet-switch-capable routers across\n  \
    \ the TDM-region (for example, VC-12 links) and the LSP can be routed\n   over\
    \ those TE links.  Furthermore, even if the LSP can be\n   successfully established\
    \ across the PSC-region, TDM hierarchical LSPs\n   (across the TDM region between\
    \ the packet-switch capable routers) may\n   be established and used if doing\
    \ so is necessary to meet the\n   operator's objectives for network resource availability\
    \ (e.g., link\n   bandwidth).  The same considerations hold when VC4 LSPs are\n\
    \   provisioned to provide extra flexibility for the VC12 and/or VC11\n   layers\
    \ in an MLN.\n   Sections 3 and 4 of this document provide further background\n\
    \   information of the concepts and motivation behind multi-region and\n   multi-layer\
    \ networks.  Section 5 presents detailed requirements for\n   protocols used to\
    \ implement such networks.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope\n   Early sections of this document describe the motivations and\n\
    \   reasoning that require the development and deployment of MRN/MLN.\n   Later\
    \ sections of this document set out the required features that\n   the GMPLS control\
    \ plane must offer to support MRN/MLN.  There is no\n   intention to specify solution-specific\
    \ and/or protocol elements in\n   this document.  The applicability of existing\
    \ GMPLS protocols and any\n   protocol extensions to the MRN/MLN is addressed\
    \ in separate documents\n   [MRN-EVAL].\n   This document covers the elements\
    \ of a single GMPLS control plane\n   instance controlling multiple layers within\
    \ a given TE domain.  A\n   control plane instance can serve one, two, or more\
    \ layers.  Other\n   possible approaches such as having multiple control plane\
    \ instances\n   serving disjoint sets of layers are outside the scope of this\n\
    \   document.  It is most probable that such a MLN or MRN would be\n   operated\
    \ by a single service provider, but this document does not\n   exclude the possibility\
    \ of two layers (or regions) being under\n   different administrative control\
    \ (for example, by different Service\n   Providers that share a single control\
    \ plane instance) where the\n   administrative domains are prepared to share a\
    \ limited amount of\n   information.\n   For such a TE domain to interoperate\
    \ with edge nodes/domains\n   supporting non-GMPLS interfaces (such as those defined\
    \ by other\n   standards development organizations (SDOs)), an interworking function\n\
    \   may be needed.  Location and specification of this function are\n   outside\
    \ the scope of this document (because interworking aspects are\n   strictly under\
    \ the responsibility of the interworking function).\n   This document assumes\
    \ that the interconnection of adjacent MRN/MLN TE\n   domains makes use of [RFC4726]\
    \ when their edges also support inter-\n   domain GMPLS RSVP-TE extensions.\n"

    \ (MLN)\n   since the network devices on region boundaries bring together\n  \
    \ different ISCs.  A MLN, however, is not necessarily a MRN since\n   multiple\

- title: 3.1.  Data Plane Layers and Control Plane Regions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Data Plane Layers and Control Plane Regions\n   A data plane layer is a\
    \ collection of network resources capable of\n   terminating and/or switching\
    \ data traffic of a particular format\n   [RFC4397].  These resources can be used\
    \ for establishing LSPs for\n   traffic delivery.  For example, VC-11 and VC4-64c\
    \ represent two\n   different layers.\n   From the control plane viewpoint, an\
    \ LSP region is defined as a set\n   of one or more data plane layers that share\
    \ the same type of\n   switching technology, that is, the same switching type.\
    \  For example,\n   VC-11, VC-4, and VC-4-7v layers are part of the same TDM region.\
    \  The\n   regions that are currently defined are: PSC, L2SC, TDM, LSC, and FSC.\n\
    \   Hence, an LSP region is a technology domain (identified by the ISC\n   type)\
    \ for which data plane resources (i.e., data links) are\n   represented into the\
    \ control plane as an aggregate of TE information\n   associated with a set of\
    \ links (i.e., TE links).  For example, VC-11\n   and VC4-64c capable TE links\
    \ are part of the same TDM region.\n   Multiple layers can thus exist in a single\
    \ region network.\n   Note also that the region may produce a distinction within\
    \ the\n   control plane.  Layers of the same region share the same switching\n\
    \   technology and, therefore, use the same set of technology-specific\n   signaling\
    \ objects and technology-specific value setting of TE link\n   attributes within\
    \ the control plane, but layers from different\n   regions may use different technology-specific\
    \ objects and TE\n   attribute values.  This means that it may not be possible\
    \ to simply\n   forward the signaling message between LSRs that host different\n\
    \   switching technologies.  This is due to changes in some of the\n   signaling\
    \ objects (for example, the traffic parameters) when crossing\n   a region boundary\
    \ even if a single control plane instance is used to\n   manage the whole MRN.\
    \  We may solve this issue by using triggered\n   signaling (see Section 4.3.1).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Service Layer Networks
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Service Layer Networks\n   A service provider's network may be divided\
    \ into different service\n   layers.  The customer's network is considered from\
    \ the provider's\n   perspective as the highest service layer.  It interfaces\
    \ to the\n   highest service layer of the service provider's network.\n   Connectivity\
    \ across the highest service layer of the service\n   provider's network may be\
    \ provided with support from successively\n   lower service layers.  Service layers\
    \ are realized via a hierarchy of\n   network layers located generally in several\
    \ regions and commonly\n   arranged according to the switching capabilities of\
    \ network devices.\n   For instance, some customers purchase Layer-1 (i.e., transport)\n\
    \   services from the service provider, some Layer 2 (e.g., ATM), while\n   others\
    \ purchase Layer-3 (IP/MPLS) services.  The service provider\n   realizes the\
    \ services by a stack of network layers located within one\n   or more network\
    \ regions.  The network layers are commonly arranged\n   according to the switching\
    \ capabilities of the devices in the\n   networks.  Thus, a customer network may\
    \ be provided on top of the\n   GMPLS-based multi-region/multi-layer network.\
    \  For example, a Layer-1\n   service (realized via the network layers of TDM,\
    \ and/or LSC, and/or\n   FSC regions) may support a Layer-2 network (realized\
    \ via ATM Virtual\n   Path / Virtual Circuit (VP/VC)), which may itself support\
    \ a Layer-3\n   network (IP/MPLS region).  The supported data plane relationship\
    \ is a\n   data plane client-server relationship where the lower layer provides\n\
    \   a service for the higher layer using the data links realized in the\n   lower\
    \ layer.\n   Services provided by a GMPLS-based multi-region/multi-layer network\n\
    \   are referred to as \"multi-region/multi-layer network services\".  For\n \
    \  example, legacy IP and IP/MPLS networks can be supported on top of\n   multi-region/multi-layer\
    \ networks.  It has to be emphasized that\n   delivery of such diverse services\
    \ is a strong motivator for the\n   deployment of multi-region/multi-layer networks.\n\
    \   A customer network may be provided on top of a server GMPLS-based\n   MRN/MLN\
    \ which is operated by a service provider.  For example, a pure\n   IP and/or\
    \ an IP/MPLS network can be provided on top of GMPLS-based\n   packet-over-optical\
    \ networks [RFC5146].  The relationship between the\n   networks is a client/server\
    \ relationship and, such services are\n   referred to as \"MRN/MLN services\"\
    .  In this case, the customer\n   network may form part of the MRN/MLN or may\
    \ be partially separated,\n   for example, to maintain separate routing information\
    \ but retain\n   common signaling.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Vertical and Horizontal Interaction and Integration
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Vertical and Horizontal Interaction and Integration\n   Vertical interaction\
    \ is defined as the collaborative mechanisms\n   within a network element that\
    \ is capable of supporting more than one\n   layer or region and of realizing\
    \ the client/server relationships\n   between the layers or regions.  Protocol\
    \ exchanges between two\n   network controllers managing different regions or\
    \ layers are also a\n   vertical interaction.  Integration of these interactions\
    \ as part of\n   the control plane is referred to as vertical integration.  Thus,\
    \ this\n   refers to the collaborative mechanisms within a single control plane\n\
    \   instance driving multiple network layers that are part of the same\n   region\
    \ or not.  Such a concept is useful in order to construct a\n   framework that\
    \ facilitates efficient network resource usage and rapid\n   service provisioning\
    \ in carrier networks that are based on multiple\n   layers, switching technologies,\
    \ or ISCs.\n   Horizontal interaction is defined as the protocol exchange between\n\
    \   network controllers that manage transport nodes within a given layer\n   or\
    \ region.  For instance, the control plane interaction between two\n   TDM network\
    \ elements switching at OC-48 is an example of horizontal\n   interaction.  GMPLS\
    \ protocol operations handle horizontal\n   interactions within the same routing\
    \ area.  The case where the\n   interaction takes place across a domain boundary,\
    \ such as between two\n   routing areas within the same network layer, is evaluated\
    \ as part of\n   the inter-domain work [RFC4726], and is referred to as horizontal\n\
    \   integration.  Thus, horizontal integration refers to the\n   collaborative\
    \ mechanisms between network partitions and/or\n   administrative divisions such\
    \ as routing areas or autonomous systems.\n   This distinction needs further clarification\
    \ when administrative\n   domains match layer/region boundaries.  Horizontal interaction\
    \ is\n   extended to cover such cases.  For example, the collaborative\n   mechanisms\
    \ in place between two LSC areas relate to horizontal\n   integration.  On the\
    \ other hand, the collaborative mechanisms in\n   place between a PSC (e.g., IP/MPLS)\
    \ domain and a separate TDM capable\n   (e.g., VC4 Synchronous Digital Hierarchy\
    \ (SDH)) domain over which it\n   operates are part of the horizontal integration,\
    \ while it can also be\n   seen as a first step towards vertical integration.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Motivation\n   The applicability of GMPLS to multiple switching technologies\n\
    \   provides a unified control and management approach for both LSP\n   provisioning\
    \ and recovery.  Indeed, one of the main motivations for\n   unifying the capabilities\
    \ and operations of the GMPLS control plane\n   is the desire to support multi-LSP-region\
    \ [RFC4206] routing and TE\n   capabilities.  For instance, this enables effective\
    \ network resource\n   utilization of both the Packet/Layer2 LSP regions and the\
    \ TDM or\n   Lambda LSP regions in high-capacity networks.\n   The rationales\
    \ for GMPLS-controlled multi-layer/multi-region networks\n   are summarized below:\n\
    \   - The maintenance of multiple instances of the control plane on\n     devices\
    \ hosting more than one switching capability not only\n     increases the complexity\
    \ of the interactions between control plane\n     instances, but also increases\
    \ the total amount of processing each\n     individual control plane instance\
    \ must handle.\n   - The unification of the addressing spaces helps in avoiding\
    \ multiple\n     identifiers for the same object (a link, for instance, or more\n\
    \     generally, any network resource).  On the other hand such\n     aggregation\
    \ does not impact the separation between the control\n     plane and the data\
    \ plane.\n   - By maintaining a single routing protocol instance and a single\
    \ TE\n     database per LSR, a unified control plane model removes the\n     requirement\
    \ to maintain a dedicated routing topology per layer and\n     therefore does\
    \ not mandate a full mesh of routing adjacencies as is\n     the case with overlaid\
    \ control planes.\n   - The collaboration between technology layers where the\
    \ control\n     channel is associated with the data channel (e.g., packet/framed\n\
    \     data planes) and technology layers where the control channel is not\n  \
    \   directly associated with the data channel (SONET/SDH, G.709, etc.)\n     is\
    \ facilitated by the capability within GMPLS to associate in-band\n     control\
    \ plane signaling to the IP terminating interfaces of the\n     control plane.\n\
    \   - Resource management and policies to be applied at the edges of such\n  \
    \   an MRN/MLN are made more simple (fewer control-to-management\n     interactions)\
    \ and more scalable (through the use of aggregated\n     information).\n   - Multi-region/multi-layer\
    \ traffic engineering is facilitated as TE\n     links from distinct regions/layers\
    \ are stored within the same TE\n     Database.\n"

  - "4.1.  Interface Switching Capability\n   The Interface Switching Capability (ISC)\
    \ is introduced in GMPLS to\n   support various kinds of switching technology\
    \ in a unified way\n   [RFC4202].  An ISC is identified via a switching type.\n\
    \   A switching type (also referred to as the switching capability type)\n   describes\
    \ the ability of a node to forward data of a particular data\n   plane technology,\
    \ and uniquely identifies a network region.  The\n   following ISC types (and,\
    \ hence, regions) are defined:  PSC, L2SC,\n   TDM capable, LSC, and FSC.  Each\
    \ end of a data link (more precisely,\n   each interface connecting a data link\
    \ to a node) in a GMPLS network\n   is associated with an ISC.\n   The ISC value\
    \ is advertised as a part of the Interface Switching\n   Capability Descriptor\
    \ (ISCD) attribute (sub-TLV) of a TE link end\n   associated with a particular\
    \ link interface [RFC4202].  Apart from\n   the ISC, the ISCD contains information\
    \ including the encoding type,\n   the bandwidth granularity, and the unreserved\
    \ bandwidth on each of\n   eight priorities at which LSPs can be established.\
    \  The ISCD does not\n   \"identify\" network layers, it uniquely characterizes\
    \ information\n   associated to one or more network layers.\n   TE link end advertisements\
    \ may contain multiple ISCDs.  This can be\n   interpreted as advertising a multi-layer\
    \ (or multi-switching-\n   capable) TE link end.  That is, the TE link end (and\
    \ therefore the TE\n   link) is present in multiple layers.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Multiple Interface Switching Capabilities
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Multiple Interface Switching Capabilities\n   In an MLN, network elements\
    \ may be single-switching-type-capable or\n   multi-switching-type-capable nodes.\
    \  Single-switching-type-capable\n   nodes advertise the same ISC value as part\
    \ of their ISCD sub-TLV(s)\n   to describe the termination capabilities of each\
    \ of their TE link(s).\n   This case is described in [RFC4202].\n   Multi-switching-type-capable\
    \ LSRs are classified as \"simplex\" or\n   \"hybrid\" nodes.  Simplex and hybrid\
    \ nodes are categorized according\n   to the way they advertise these multiple\
    \ ISCs:\n   - A simplex node can terminate data links with different switching\n\
    \     capabilities where each data link is connected to the node by a\n     separate\
    \ link interface.  So, it advertises several TE links each\n     with a single\
    \ ISC value carried in its ISCD sub-TLV (following the\n     rules defined in\
    \ [RFC4206]).  An example is an LSR with PSC and TDM\n     links each of which\
    \ is connected to the LSR via a separate\n     interface.\n   - A hybrid node\
    \ can terminate data links with different switching\n     capabilities where the\
    \ data links are connected to the node by the\n     same interface.  So, it advertises\
    \ a single TE link containing more\n     than one ISCD each with a different ISC\
    \ value.  For example, a node\n     may terminate PSC and TDM data links and interconnect\
    \ those\n     external data links via internal links.  The external interfaces\n\
    \     connected to the node have both PSC and TDM capabilities.\n   Additionally,\
    \ TE link advertisements issued by a simplex or a hybrid\n   node may need to\
    \ provide information about the node's internal\n   adjustment capabilities between\
    \ the switching technologies supported.\n   The term \"adjustment\" refers to\
    \ the property of a hybrid node to\n   interconnect the different switching capabilities\
    \ that it provides\n   through its external interfaces.  The information about\
    \ the\n   adjustment capabilities of the nodes in the network allows the path\n\
    \   computation process to select an end-to-end multi-layer or multi-\n   region\
    \ path that includes links with different switching capabilities\n   joined by\
    \ LSRs that can adapt (i.e., adjust) the signal between the\n   links.\n"

    \ of network contains at least one hybrid node, zero or more\n   simplex nodes,\
    \ and a set of single-switching-type-capable nodes.\n   Figure 1 shows an example\
    \ hybrid node.  The hybrid node has two\n   switching elements (matrices), which\
    \ support, for instance, TDM and\n   PSC switching, respectively.  The node terminates\
    \ a PSC and a TDM\n   link (Link1 and Link2, respectively).  It also has an internal\

  contents:
  - "4.3.  Integrated Traffic Engineering (TE) and Resource Control\n   In GMPLS-based\
    \ multi-region/multi-layer networks, TE links may be\n   consolidated into a single\
    \ Traffic Engineering Database (TED) for use\n   by the single control plane instance.\
    \  Since this TED contains the\n   information relative to all the layers of all\
    \ regions in the network,\n   a path across multiple layers (possibly crossing\
    \ multiple regions)\n   can be computed using the information in this TED.  Thus,\n\
    \   optimization of network resources across the multiple layers of the\n   same\
    \ region and across multiple regions can be achieved.\n   These concepts allow\
    \ for the operation of one network layer over the\n   topology (that is, TE links)\
    \ provided by other network layers (for\n   example, the use of a lower-layer\
    \ LSC LSP carrying PSC LSPs).  In\n   turn, a greater degree of control and interworking\
    \ can be achieved,\n   including (but not limited to):\n   - Dynamic establishment\
    \ of Forwarding Adjacency (FA) LSPs [RFC4206]\n     (see Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3).\n\
    \   - Provisioning of end-to-end LSPs with dynamic triggering of FA LSPs.\n  \
    \ Note that in a multi-layer/multi-region network that includes multi-\n   switching-type-capable\
    \ nodes, an explicit route used to establish an\n   end-to-end LSP can specify\
    \ nodes that belong to different layers or\n   regions.  In this case, a mechanism\
    \ to control the dynamic creation\n   of FA-LSPs may be required (see Sections\
    \ 4.3.2 and 4.3.3).\n   There is a full spectrum of options to control how FA-LSPs\
    \ are\n   dynamically established.  The process can be subject to the control\n\
    \   of a policy, which may be set by a management component and which may\n  \
    \ require that the management plane is consulted at the time that the\n   FA-LSP\
    \ is established.  Alternatively, the FA-LSP can be established\n   at the request\
    \ of the control plane without any management control.\n"

- title: 4.3.2.  FA-LSPs
  contents:
  - "4.3.2.  FA-LSPs\n   Once an LSP is created across a layer from one layer border\
    \ node to\n   another, it can be used as a data link in an upper layer.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ it can be advertised as a TE link, allowing other nodes\n   to consider the\
    \ LSP as a TE link for their path computation\n   [RFC4206].  An LSP created either\
    \ statically or dynamically by one\n   instance of the control plane and advertised\
    \ as a TE link into the\n   same instance of the control plane is called a Forwarding\
    \ Adjacency\n   LSP (FA-LSP).  The FA-LSP is advertised as a TE link, and that\
    \ TE\n   link is called a Forwarding Adjacency (FA).  An FA has the special\n\
    \   characteristic of not requiring a routing adjacency (peering) between\n  \
    \ its end points yet still guaranteeing control plane connectivity\n   between\
    \ the FA-LSP end points based on a signaling adjacency.  An FA\n   is a useful\
    \ and powerful tool for improving the scalability of\n   GMPLS-TE capable networks\
    \ since multiple higher-layer LSPs may be\n   nested (aggregated) over a single\
    \ FA-LSP.\n   The aggregation of LSPs enables the creation of a vertical (nested)\n\
    \   LSP hierarchy.  A set of FA-LSPs across or within a lower layer can\n   be\
    \ used during path selection by a higher-layer LSP.  Likewise, the\n   higher-layer\
    \ LSPs may be carried over dynamic data links realized via\n   LSPs (just as they\
    \ are carried over any \"regular\" static data links).\n   This process requires\
    \ the nesting of LSPs through a hierarchical\n   process [RFC4206].  The TED contains\
    \ a set of LSP advertisements from\n   different layers that are identified by\
    \ the ISCD contained within the\n   TE link advertisement associated with the\
    \ LSP [RFC4202].\n   If a lower-layer LSP is not advertised as an FA, it can still\
    \ be used\n   to carry higher-layer LSPs across the lower layer.  For example,\
    \ if\n   the LSP is set up using triggered signaling, it will be used to carry\n\
    \   the higher-layer LSP that caused the trigger.  Further, the lower\n   layer\
    \ remains available for use by other higher-layer LSPs arriving\n   at the boundary.\n\
    \   Under some circumstances, it may be useful to control the\n   advertisement\

  contents:
  - "4.3.3.  Virtual Network Topology (VNT)\n   A set of one or more lower-layer LSPs\
    \ provides information for\n   efficient path handling in upper layer(s) of the\
    \ MLN, or, in other\n   words, provides a virtual network topology (VNT) to the\
    \ upper layers.\n   For instance, a set of LSPs, each of which is supported by\
    \ an LSC\n   LSP, provides a VNT to the layers of a PSC region, assuming that\
    \ the\n   PSC region is connected to the LSC region.  Note that a single\n   lower-layer\
    \ LSP is a special case of the VNT.  The VNT is configured\n   by setting up or\
    \ tearing down the lower-layer LSPs.  By using GMPLS\n   signaling and routing\
    \ protocols, the VNT can be adapted to traffic\n   demands.\n   A lower-layer\
    \ LSP appears as a TE link in the VNT.  Whether the\n   diversely-routed lower-layer\
    \ LSPs are used or not, the routes of\n   lower-layer LSPs are hidden from the\
    \ upper layer in the VNT.  Thus,\n   the VNT simplifies the upper-layer routing\
    \ and traffic engineering\n   decisions by hiding the routes taken by the lower-layer\
    \ LSPs.\n   However, hiding the routes of the lower-layer LSPs may lose important\n\
    \   information that is needed to make the higher-layer LSPs reliable.\n   For\
    \ instance, the routing and traffic engineering in the IP/MPLS\n   layer does\
    \ not usually consider how the IP/MPLS TE links are formed\n   from optical paths\
    \ that are routed in the fiber layer.  Two optical\n   paths may share the same\
    \ fiber link in the lower-layer and therefore\n   they may both fail if the fiber\
    \ link is cut.  Thus the shared risk\n   properties of the TE links in the VNT\
    \ must be made available to the\n   higher layer during path computation.  Further,\
    \ the topology of the\n   VNT should be designed so that any single fiber cut\
    \ does not bisect\n   the VNT.  These issues are addressed later in this document.\n\
    \   Reconfiguration of the VNT may be triggered by traffic demand\n   changes,\
    \ topology configuration changes, signaling requests from the\n   upper layer,\
    \ and network failures.  For instance, by reconfiguring\n   the VNT according\
    \ to the traffic demand between source and\n   destination node pairs, network\
    \ performance factors, such as maximum\n   link utilization and residual capacity\
    \ of the network, can be\n   optimized.  Reconfiguration is performed by computing\
    \ the new VNT\n   from the traffic demand matrix and optionally from the current\
    \ VNT.\n   Exact details are outside the scope of this document.  However, this\n\
    \   method may be tailored according to the service provider's policy\n   regarding\
    \ network performance and quality of service (delay,\n   loss/disruption, utilization,\

    \ in the same layer as where the endpoints of the path\n   exist.  Note that here\
    \ we assume that triggered signaling will be\n   invoked to make the path \"connected\"\
    , when the upper-layer signaling\n   request arrives at the boundary node.\n \
    \  The upper-layer signaling request MAY contain an ERO (Explicit Route\n   Object)\
    \ that includes only hops in the upper layer; in which case,\n   the boundary\
    \ node is responsible for triggered creation of the\n   lower-layer FA-LSP using\
    \ a path of its choice, or for the selection\n   of any available lower-layer\
    \ LSP as a data link for the higher layer.\n   This mechanism is appropriate for\
    \ environments where the TED is\n   filtered in the higher layer, where separate\
    \ routing instances are\n   used per layer, or where administrative policies prevent\
    \ the higher\n   layer from specifying paths through the lower layer.\n   Obviously,\
    \ if the lower-layer LSP has been advertised as a TE link\n   (virtual or real)\
    \ into the higher layer, then the higher-layer\n   signaling request MAY contain\
    \ the TE link identifier and so indicate\n   the lower-layer resources to be used.\
    \  But in this case, the path of\n   the lower-layer LSP can be dynamically changed\
    \ by the lower layer at\n   any time.\n   Alternatively, the upper-layer signaling\
    \ request MAY contain an ERO\n   specifying the lower-layer FA-LSP route.  In\
    \ this case, the boundary\n   node MAY decide whether it should use the path contained\
    \ in the\n   strict ERO or re-compute the path within the lower layer.\n   Even\
    \ in the case that the lower-layer FA-LSPs are already\n   established, a signaling\
    \ request may also be encoded as a loose ERO.\n   In this situation, it is up\
    \ to the boundary node to decide whether it\n   should create a new lower-layer\
    \ FA-LSP or it should use an existing\n   lower-layer FA-LSP.\n   The lower-layer\
    \ FA-LSP can be advertised just as an FA-LSP in the\n   upper layer or an IGP\
    \ adjacency can be brought up on the lower-layer\n   FA-LSP.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.8.1.  FA-LSP Release and Setup\n   If there is low traffic demand, some FA-LSPs\
    \ that do not carry any\n   higher-layer LSP may be released so that lower-layer\
    \ resources are\n   released and can be assigned to other uses.  Note that if\
    \ a small\n   fraction of the available bandwidth of an FA-LSP is still in use,\
    \ the\n   nested LSPs can also be re-routed to other FA-LSPs (optionally using\n\
    \   the make-before-break technique) to completely free up the FA-LSP.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ unused FA-LSPs may be retained for future use.\n   Release or retention of underutilized\
    \ FA-LSPs is a policy decision.\n   As part of the re-optimization process, the\
    \ solution MUST allow\n   rerouting of an FA-LSP while keeping interface identifiers\
    \ of\n   corresponding TE links unchanged.  Further, this process MUST be\n  \
    \ possible while the FA-LSP is carrying traffic (higher-layer LSPs)\n   with minimal\
    \ disruption to the traffic.\n   Additional FA-LSPs may also be created based\
    \ on policy, which might\n   consider residual resources and the change of traffic\
    \ demand across\n   the region.  By creating the new FA-LSPs, the network performance\n\
    \   such as maximum residual capacity may increase.\n   As the number of FA-LSPs\
    \ grows, the residual resources may decrease.\n   In this case, re-optimization\
    \ of FA-LSPs may be invoked according to\n   policy.\n   Any solution MUST include\
    \ measures to protect against network\n   destabilization caused by the rapid\
    \ setup and teardown of LSPs as\n   traffic demand varies near a threshold.\n\
    \   Signaling of lower-layer LSPs SHOULD include a mechanism to rapidly\n   advertise\
    \ the LSP as a TE link and to coordinate into which routing\n   instances the\
    \ TE link should be advertised.\n"
- title: 5.8.2.  Virtual TE Links
  contents:
  - "5.8.2.  Virtual TE Links\n   It may be considered disadvantageous to fully instantiate\
    \ (i.e.,\n   pre-provision) the set of lower-layer LSPs that provide the VNT since\n\
    \   this might reserve bandwidth that could be used for other LSPs in the\n  \
    \ absence of upper-layer traffic.\n   However, in order to allow path computation\
    \ of upper-layer LSPs\n   across the lower layer, the lower-layer LSPs may be\
    \ advertised into\n   the upper layer as though they had been fully established,\
    \ but\n   without actually establishing them.  Such TE links that represent the\n\
    \   possibility of an underlying LSP are termed \"virtual TE links\".  It\n  \
    \ is an implementation choice at a layer boundary node whether to\n   create real\
    \ or virtual TE links, and the choice (if available in an\n   implementation)\
    \ MUST be under the control of operator policy.  Note\n   that there is no requirement\
    \ to support the creation of virtual TE\n   links, since real TE links (with established\
    \ LSPs) may be used.  Even\n   if there are no TE links (virtual or real) advertised\
    \ to the higher\n   layer, it is possible to route a higher-layer LSP into a lower\
    \ layer\n   on the assumption that proper hierarchical LSPs in the lower layer\n\
    \   will be dynamically created (triggered) as needed.\n   If an upper-layer LSP\
    \ that makes use of a virtual TE link is set up,\n   the underlying LSP MUST be\
    \ immediately signaled in the lower layer.\n   If virtual TE links are used in\
    \ place of pre-established LSPs, the TE\n   links across the upper layer can remain\
    \ stable using pre-computed\n   paths while wastage of bandwidth within the lower\
    \ layer and\n   unnecessary reservation of adaptation resources at the border\
    \ nodes\n   can be avoided.\n   The solution SHOULD provide operations to facilitate\
    \ the build-up of\n   such virtual TE links, taking into account the (forecast)\
    \ traffic\n   demand and available resources in the lower layer.\n   Virtual TE\
    \ links can be added, removed, or modified dynamically (by\n   changing their\
    \ capacity) according to the change of the (forecast)\n   traffic demand and the\
    \ available resources in the lower layer.  It\n   MUST be possible to add, remove,\
    \ and modify virtual TE links in a\n   dynamic way.\n   Any solution MUST include\
    \ measures to protect against network\n   destabilization caused by the rapid\
    \ changes in the VNT as traffic\n   demand varies near a threshold.\n   The concept\
    \ of the VNT can be extended to allow the virtual TE links\n   to form part of\
    \ the VNT.  The combination of the fully provisioned TE\n   links and the virtual\
    \ TE links defines the VNT provided by the lower\n   layer.  The VNT can be changed\
    \ by setting up and/or tearing down\n   virtual TE links as well as by modifying\
    \ real links (i.e., the fully\n   provisioned LSPs).  How to design the VNT and\
    \ how to manage it are\n   out of scope of this document.\n   In some situations,\
    \ selective advertisement of the preferred\n   connectivity among a set of border\
    \ nodes between layers may be\n   appropriate.  Further decreasing the number\
    \ of advertisements of the\n   virtual connectivity can be achieved by abstracting\
    \ the topology\n   (between border nodes) using models similar to those detailed\
    \ in\n   [RFC4847].\n"

- title: 5.10.  Management
  contents:
  - "5.10.  Management\n   An MRN/MLN requires management capabilities.  Operators\
    \ need to have\n   the same level of control and management for switches and links\
    \ in\n   the network that they would have in a single-layer or single-region\n\
    \   network.\n   We can consider two different operational models: (1) per-layer\n\
    \   management entities and (2) cross-layer management entities.\n   Regarding\
    \ per-layer management entities, it is possible for the MLN\n   to be managed\
    \ entirely as separate layers, although that somewhat\n   defeats the objective\
    \ of defining a single multi-layer network.  In\n   this case, separate management\
    \ systems would be operated for each\n   layer, and those systems would be unaware\
    \ of the fact that the layers\n   were closely coupled in the control plane. \
    \ In such a deployment, as\n   LSPs were automatically set up as the result of\
    \ control plane\n   requests from other layers (for example, triggered signaling),\
    \ the\n   management applications would need to register the creation of the\n\
    \   new LSPs and the depletion of network resources.  Emphasis would be\n   placed\
    \ on the layer boundary nodes to report the activity to the\n   management applications.\n\
    \   A more likely scenario is to apply a closer coupling of layer\n   management\
    \ systems with cross-layer management entities.  This might\n   be achieved through\
    \ a unified management system capable of operating\n   multiple layers, or by\
    \ a meta-management system that coordinates the\n   operation of separate management\
    \ systems each responsible for\n   individual layers.  The former case might only\
    \ be possible with the\n   development of new management systems, while the latter\
    \ is feasible\n   through the coordination of existing network management tools.\n\
    \   Note that when a layer boundary also forms an administrative\n   boundary,\
    \ it is highly unlikely that there will be unified multi-\n   layer management.\
    \  In this case, the layers will be separately\n   managed by the separate administrative\
    \ entities, but there may be\n   some \"leakage\" of information between the administrations\
    \ in order to\n   facilitate the operation of the MLN.  For example, the management\n\
    \   system in the lower-layer network might automatically issue reports\n   on\
    \ resource availability (coincident with TE routing information) and\n   alarm\
    \ events.\n   This discussion comes close to an examination of how a VNT might\
    \ be\n   managed and operated.  As noted in Section 5.8, issues of how to\n  \
    \ design and manage a VNT are out of scope for this document, but it\n   should\
    \ be understood that the VNT is a client-layer construct built\n   from server-layer\
    \ resources.  This means that the operation of a VNT\n   is a collaborative activity\
    \ between layers.  This activity is\n   possible even if the layers are from separate\
    \ administrations, but in\n   this case the activity may also have commercial\
    \ implications.\n   MIB modules exist for the modeling and management of GMPLS\
    \ networks\n   [RFC4802] [RFC4803].  Some deployments of GMPLS networks may choose\n\
    \   to use MIB modules to operate individual network layers.  In these\n   cases,\
    \ operators may desire to coordinate layers through a further\n   MIB module that\
    \ could be developed.  Multi-layer protocol solutions\n   (that is, solutions\
    \ where a single control plane instance operates in\n   more than one layer) SHOULD\
    \ be manageable through MIB modules.  A\n   further MIB module to coordinate multiple\
    \ network layers with this\n   control plane MIB module may be produced.\n   Operations\
    \ and Management (OAM) tools are important to the successful\n   deployment of\
    \ all networks.\n   OAM requirements for GMPLS networks are described in [GMPLS-OAM].\n\
    \   That document points out that protocol solutions for individual\n   network\
    \ layers should include mechanisms for OAM or make use of OAM\n   features inherent\
    \ in the physical media of the layers.  Further\n   discussion of individual-layer\
    \ OAM is out of scope of this document.\n   When operating OAM in a MLN, consideration\
    \ must be given to how to\n   provide OAM for end-to-end LSPs that cross layer\
    \ boundaries (that may\n   also be administrative boundaries) and how to coordinate\
    \ errors and\n   alarms detected in a server layer that need to be reported to\
    \ the\n   client layer.  These operational choices MUST be left open to the\n\
    \   service provider and so MLN protocol solutions MUST include the\n   following\
    \ features:\n   - Within the context and technology capabilities of the highest\n\
    \     technology layer of an LSP (i.e., the technology layer of the first\n  \
    \   hop), it MUST be possible to enable end-to-end OAM on a MLN LSP.\n     This\
    \ function appears to the ingress LSP as normal LSP-based OAM\n     [GMPLS-OAM],\
    \ but at layer boundaries, depending on the technique\n     used to span the lower\
    \ layers, client-layer OAM operations may need\n     to mapped to server-layer\
    \ OAM operations.  Most such requirements\n     are highly dependent on the OAM\
    \ facilities of the data plane\n     technologies of client and server layers.\
    \  However, control plane\n     mechanisms used in the client layer per [GMPLS-OAM]\
    \ MUST map and\n     enable OAM in the server layer.\n   - OAM operation enabled\
    \ per [GMPLS-OAM] in a client layer for an LSP\n     MUST operate for that LSP\
    \ along its entire length.  This means that\n     if an LSP crosses a domain of\
    \ a lower-layer technology, the\n     client-layer OAM operation must operate\
    \ seamlessly within the\n     client layer at both ends of the client-layer LSP.\n\
    \   - OAM functions operating within a server layer MUST be controllable\n   \
    \  from the client layer such that the server-layer LSP(s) that\n     support\
    \ a client-layer LSP have OAM enabled at the request of the\n     client layer.\
    \  Such control SHOULD be subject to policy at the\n     layer boundary, just\
    \ as automatic provisioning and LSP requests to\n     the server layer are subject\
    \ to policy.\n   - The status including errors and alarms applicable to a server-layer\n\
    \     LSP MUST be available to the client layer.  This information SHOULD\n  \
    \   be configurable to be automatically notified to the client layer at\n    \
    \ the layer boundary and SHOULD be subject to policy so that the\n     server\
    \ layer may filter or hide information supplied to the client\n     layer.  Furthermore,\
    \ the client layer SHOULD be able to select to\n     not receive any or all such\
    \ information.\n   Note that the interface between layers lies within network\
    \ nodes and\n   is, therefore, not necessarily the subject of a protocol\n   specification.\
    \  Implementations MAY use standardized techniques (such\n   as MIB modules) to\
    \ convey status information (such as errors and\n   alarms) between layers, but\
    \ that is out of scope for this document.\n"
