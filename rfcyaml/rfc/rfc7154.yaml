- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The work of the IETF relies on cooperation among a diverse\
    \ range of\n   people with different ideas and communication styles.  The IETF\n\
    \   strives, through these guidelines for conduct, to create and maintain\n  \
    \ an environment in which every person is treated with dignity,\n   decency, and\
    \ respect.  People who participate in the IETF are\n   expected to behave in a\
    \ professional manner as we work together to\n   develop interoperable technologies\
    \ for the Internet.  We aim to abide\n   by these guidelines as we build consensus\
    \ in person and through email\n   discussions.  If conflicts arise, they are resolved\
    \ according to the\n   procedures outlined in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].\n   This document\
    \ obsoletes RFC 3184 [RFC3184], as it is an updated\n   version of the guidelines\
    \ for conduct.\n"
- title: 2.  Guidelines for Conduct
  contents:
  - "2.  Guidelines for Conduct\n   1. IETF participants extend respect and courtesy\
    \ to their colleagues\n      at all times.\n      IETF participants come from\
    \ diverse origins and backgrounds; there\n      can be different expectations\
    \ or assumptions.  Regardless of these\n      individual differences, participants\
    \ treat their colleagues with\n      respect as persons especially when it is\
    \ difficult to agree with\n      them: treat other participants as you would like\
    \ to be treated.\n      English is the de facto language of the IETF.  However,\
    \ it is not\n      the native language of many IETF participants.  All participants,\n\
    \      particularly those with English as a first language, attempt to\n     \
    \ accommodate the needs of other participants by communicating\n      clearly,\
    \ including speaking slowly and limiting the use of slang.\n      When faced with\
    \ English that is difficult to understand, IETF\n      participants make a sincere\
    \ effort to understand each other and\n      engage in conversation to clarify\
    \ what was meant.\n   2. IETF participants have impersonal discussions.\n    \
    \  We dispute ideas by using reasoned argument rather than through\n      intimidation\
    \ or personal attack.  Try to provide data and facts\n      for your standpoints\
    \ so the rest of the participants who are\n      sitting on the sidelines watching\
    \ the discussion can form an\n      opinion.  The discussion is easier when the\
    \ response to a simple\n      question is a polite answer [SQPA].\n   3. IETF\
    \ participants devise solutions for the global Internet that\n      meet the needs\
    \ of diverse technical and operational environments.\n      The mission of the\
    \ IETF is to produce high-quality, relevant\n      technical and engineering documents\
    \ that influence the way people\n      design, use, and manage the Internet in\
    \ such a way as to make the\n      Internet work better.  The IETF puts its emphasis\
    \ on technical\n      competence, rough consensus, and individual participation,\
    \ and it\n      needs to be open to competent input from any source.  We\n   \
    \   understand that \"scaling is the ultimate problem\" and that many\n      ideas\
    \ that are quite workable on a small scale fail this crucial\n      test.\n  \
    \    IETF participants use their best engineering judgment to find the\n     \
    \ best solution for the whole Internet, not just the best solution\n      for\
    \ any particular network, technology, vendor, or user.  While we\n      all have\
    \ ideas that may stand improvement from time to time, no\n      one shall ever\
    \ knowingly contribute advice or text that would make\n      a standard technically\
    \ inferior.\n   4. Individuals are prepared to contribute to the ongoing work\
    \ of the\n      group.\n      We follow the intellectual property guidelines outlined\
    \ in BCP 79\n      [RFC3979].  IETF participants read the relevant Internet-Drafts,\n\
    \      RFCs, and email archives in order to familiarize themselves with\n    \
    \  the technology under discussion.  Working Group sessions run on a\n      very\
    \ limited time schedule, and sometimes participants have to\n      limit their\
    \ questions.  The work of the group will continue on the\n      mailing list,\
    \ and questions can be asked and answered on the\n      mailing list.  It can\
    \ be a challenge to participate in a Working\n      Group without knowing the\
    \ history of longstanding Working Group\n      debates.  Information about a Working\
    \ Group including its charter\n      and milestones is available on the IETF datatracker\
    \ site [TRACK]\n      or from the Working Group Chair.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The IETF guidelines for conduct do not directly\
    \ affect the security\n   of the Internet.  However, it is to be noted that there\
    \ is an\n   expectation that no one shall ever knowingly contribute advice or\n\
    \   text that may adversely affect the security of the Internet without\n   describing\
    \ all known or foreseen risks and threats to potential\n   implementers and users\
    \ that they are aware of.\n"

    \ rights of an individual.  RFC 3934 [RFC3934] describes a\n   measure through\

    \ decency, and respect.\n   o  Added text about contributing advice or text that\
    \ may affect the\n      security of the Internet.\n   o  The recommendation that\
    \ newcomers should not interfere with the\n      ongoing process in Section 2\
    \ was removed as it can be read as\n      discouraging newcomers from participating\
    \ in discussions.\n   o  The text about the goal of the IETF was replaced with\
    \ text about\n      the mission statement and what the IETF puts its emphasis\
    \ on.\n   o  The text about \"think globally\" was removed as the meaning was\
    \ not\n      clear.\n   o  The text about English as a first language was clarified.\n\
    \   o  The guideline about impersonal discussions was reworded as a\n      positive\
    \ statement.\n"
