- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol [RFC4306]\
    \ is a\n   component of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication and\n\
    \   establishing and maintaining security associations (SAs).  [RFC4307]\n   defines\
    \ the set of algorithms that are mandatory to implement as part\n   of IKEv2,\
    \ as well as algorithms that should be implemented because\n   they may be promoted\
    \ to mandatory at some future time.  [RFC4307]\n   requires that an implementation\
    \ \"SHOULD\" support Advanced Encryption\n   Standard [AES] Counter Mode [MODES]\
    \ (AES-CTR) as a Transform Type 1\n   algorithm (encryption).\n   Although [RFC4307]\
    \ specifies that the AES-CTR encryption algorithm\n   feature SHOULD be supported\
    \ by IKEv2, no existing document specifies\n   how IKEv2 can support the feature.\
    \  This document provides the\n   specification and usage of AES-CTR Counter Mode\
    \ by IKEv2.\n   Implementers need to carefully consider the use of AES-CTR over\
    \ the\n   mandatory-to-implement algorithms in [RFC4307], because the\n   performance\
    \ improvements of AES-CTR are minimal in the context of\n   IKEv2.  Furthermore,\
    \ these performance improvements may be offset by\n   the Counter Mode specific\
    \ risk of a minor, hard-to-detect\n   implementation issue resulting in total\
    \ security failure.\n"

- title: 2.  IKEv2 Encrypted Payload
  contents:
  - "2.  IKEv2 Encrypted Payload\n   Section 3.14 of IKEv2 [RFC4306] explains the\
    \ IKEv2 Encrypted Payload.\n   The Encrypted Payload, denoted SK{...}, contains\
    \ other IKEv2 payloads\n   in encrypted form.\n   The payload includes an Initialization\
    \ Vector (IV) whose length is\n   defined by the encryption algorithm negotiated.\
    \  It also includes\n   Integrity Checksum data.  These two fields are not encrypted.\n\
    \   The IV field MUST be 8 octets when the AES-CTR algorithm is used for\n   IKEv2\
    \ encryption.  The requirements for this IV are the same as what\n   is specified\
    \ for the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) in\n   Section 3.1 of [RFC3686].\n\
    \   IKEv2 requires Integrity Check Data for the Encrypted Payload as\n   described\
    \ in Section 3.14 of [RFC4306].  The choice of integrity\n   algorithms in IKEv2\
    \ is defined in [RFC4307] or documents that update\n   it in the future.\n   When\
    \ AES-CTR is used in IKEv2, no padding is required.  The Padding\n   field of\
    \ the Encrypted Payload SHOULD be empty, and the Pad Length\n   field SHOULD be\
    \ zero.  However, according to [RFC4306], the recipient\n   MUST accept any length\
    \ that results in proper alignment.  It should\n   be noted that the ESP [RFC4303]\
    \ Encrypted Payload requires alignment\n   on a 4-byte boundary while the IKEv2\
    \ [RFC4306] Encrypted Payload does\n   not have such a requirement.\n   The Encrypted\
    \ Payload is the XOR of the plaintext and key stream.\n   The key stream is generated\
    \ by inputting counter blocks into the AES\n   algorithm.  The AES counter block\
    \ is 128 bits, including a 4-octet\n   Nonce, 8-octet Initialization Vector, and\
    \ 4-octet Block Counter, in\n   that order.  The Block Counter begins with the\
    \ value of one and\n   increments by one to generate the next portion of the key\
    \ stream.\n   The detailed requirements for the counter block are the same as\
    \ those\n   specified in Section 4 of [RFC3686].\n"
- title: 3.  IKEv2 Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.  IKEv2 Conventions\n   The use of AES-CTR for the IKE SA is negotiated in\
    \ the same way as\n   AES-CTR for ESP.  The Transform ID (ENCR_AES_CTR) is the\
    \ same; the\n   key length transform attribute is used in the same way; and the\n\
    \   keying material (consisting of the actual key and the nonce) is\n   derived\
    \ in the same way.  See Section 5 of [RFC3686] for detailed\n   descriptions.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations explained in Section\
    \ 7 of [RFC3686] are\n   entirely relevant to this document as well.  The security\n\
    \   considerations on fresh keys and integrity protection in Section 7 of\n  \
    \ [RFC3686] are totally applicable to using AES-CTR in IKEv2; see\n   [RFC3686]\
    \ for details.  As static keys are never used in IKEv2 for\n   IKE_SA and integrity\
    \ protection is mandatory for IKE_SA, these issues\n   are not applicable for\
    \ AES-CTR in IKEv2 when protecting IKE_SA.\n   Additionally, since AES has a 128-bit\
    \ block size, regardless of the\n   mode employed, the ciphertext generated by\
    \ AES encryption becomes\n   distinguishable from random values after 2^64 blocks\
    \ are encrypted\n   with a single key.  Since IKEv2 SA cannot carry that much\
    \ data\n   (because of the size limit of the message ID of the IKEv2 message and\n\
    \   the requirements for the message ID in Section 4 of [RFC4306]), this\n   issue\
    \ is not a concern here.\n   For generic attacks on AES, such as brute force or\
    \ precalculations,\n   the key-size requirements provide reasonable security\n\
    \   [Recommendations].\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA [IANA-Para] has assigned an Encryption Algorithm\
    \ Transform ID\n   for AES-CTR encryption with an explicit IV for IKEv2: 13 as\
    \ the\n   number, and ENCR_AES_CTR as the name.  IANA has added a reference to\n\
    \   this RFC in that entry.\n"
