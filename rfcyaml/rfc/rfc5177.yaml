  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes network mobility extensions to the
    Mobile\n   IPv4 protocol.  The goal of introducing these extensions is to\n   accommodate
    mobility scenarios where groups of hosts and routers move\n   homogeneously (as
    a whole).  It is required that all hosts and\n   routers in a Mobile Network be
    able to run applications connecting to\n   the Internet, and be reachable from
    the Internet.\n   For details regarding terminology related to network mobility
    (NEMO),\n   a quick read of RFC 4885 [RFC4885] is suggested.\n"

    - "1.1.  Examples of Mobile Networks\n   A Mobile Network links together a set
      of hosts and routers.\n   Connecting this Mobile Network to the Internet is
      ensured at two\n   levels: first, a Mobile Router is connected on one side to
      the Mobile\n   Network and on another side to a wireless access system; second,
      a\n   Home Agent placed on the home link manages traffic between the\n   Correspondent
      Node and a Local Fixed Node (LFN, a node in the Mobile\n   Network) by means
      of encapsulating traffic.\n   A scenario of applicability for this Mobile Network
      is described\n   next.  A Mobile Network is formed by a wireless-enabled Personal\n
      \  Digital Assistant (PDA) and a portable photographic camera, linked\n   together
      by Bluetooth wireless link-layer technology.  This is\n   sometimes referred
      to as a Personal Area Network (PAN).  In the\n   illustration below, one can
      notice the PDA playing the role of a\n   Mobile Router and the camera the role
      of Local Fixed Node.\n                       ----\n                      | HA

      \      Bluetooth\n   The camera (Local Fixed Node) uploads photographic content
      to a\n   Correspondent Node (CN) server.  When the Mobile Network moves away,\n
      \  the Mobile Router serving the Mobile Network changes its point of\n   attachment
      from one cellular access (Access Router) to another,\n   obtaining a new Care-of
      Address.  The Home Agent (HA) encapsulates\n   application traffic for the CN
      and LFN.\n   Whereas the illustration above is a very simple instantiation of
      the\n   applicability of Mobile IP-based Mobile Networks, more complex Mobile\n
      \  Networks are easily accommodated by the Mobile IPv4 extensions\n   presented
      in this document (NEMOv4).  For example, laptop computers\n   used by passengers
      in a bus, train, ship, or plane should all be\n   considered as forming Mobile
      Networks, as long as they move together\n   (homogeneously).\n"

    - "1.2.  Overview of Protocol\n   As introduced previously, this document presents
      extensions to the\n   Mobile IPv4 protocol.  The entities sending and receiving
      these\n   extensions are the Mobile Router and the Home Agent.  The Local Fixed\n
      \  Node is relieved from running Mobile IP software and, although it\n   moves
      (together with the Mobile Network), its IP stack is not seeing\n   any change
      in addressing.\n   Mobility for the entire Mobile Network is supported by the
      Mobile\n   Router registering its current point of attachment (Care-of Address)\n
      \  to its Home Agent: the Mobile Router sends an extended Registration\n   Request
      to the Home Agent, which returns an extended Registration\n   Reply.  This signaling
      sets up the tunnel between the two entities,\n   as illustrated in the following
      figure:\n                  LFN        MR                      HA        CN\n

      \                      |         |\n   The prefix(es) used within a Mobile Network
      (either implicitly\n   configured on the Home Agent or explicitly identified
      by the Mobile\n   Router in the Registration Request) is/are advertised by the
      Home\n   Agent for route propagation in the home network.  Traffic to and from\n
      \  nodes in the Mobile Network are tunneled by the Home Agent to the\n   Mobile
      Router, and vice versa.  Though packets from a Local Fixed\n   Node placed in
      the Mobile Network can be forwarded by the Mobile\n   Router directly without
      tunneling (if reverse tunneling were not\n   used), these packets will be dropped
      if ingress filtering is turned\n   on at the Access Router.\n   Extensively
      relating to Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344], this specification\n   addresses mainly the
      co-located Care-of Address mode.  Foreign Agent\n   Care-of Address mode (with
      'legacy' Foreign Agents [RFC3344]) is\n   supported but without optimization,
      and with double encapsulation\n   being used.  For an optimization of this mode,
      the gentle reader is\n   directed to an extension document [NEMOv4-FA].\n   Compared
      to Mobile IPv4, this document specifies an additional tunnel\n   between a Mobile
      Router's Home Address and the Home Agent.  This\n   tunnel is encapsulated within
      the normal tunnel between the Care-of\n   Address (CoA) and Home Agent.  In
      Foreign Agent CoA mode, the tunnel\n   between the Mobile Router and Home Agent
      is needed to allow the\n   Foreign Agent to direct the decapsulated packet to
      the proper\n   visiting Mobile Router.  However, in co-located CoA mode, the\n
      \  additional tunnel is not essential and could be eliminated because\n   the
      Mobile Router is the recipient of the encapsulated packets for\n   the Mobile
      Network; a proposal for this feature is in the extending\n   document mentioned
      above [NEMOv4-FA].\n   All traffic between the nodes in the Mobile Network and
      the\n   Correspondent Nodes passes through the Home Agent.  This document\n
      \  does not touch on aspects related to route optimization of this\n   traffic.\n
      \  A similar protocol has been documented in RFC 3963 [RFC3963] for\n   supporting
      IPv6 Mobile Networks with Mobile IPv6 extensions.\n   Multihoming for Mobile
      Routers is outside the scope of this document.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n
    \  Terminology for Mobile IPv4 mobility support is defined in RFC 3344\n   [RFC3344].
    \ Terminology for network mobility support (NEMO), from an\n   IPv6 perspective,
    is described in RFC 4885 [RFC4885].  In addition,\n   this document defines the
    following terms for NEMOv4.\n   Mobile Router\n           RFC 3344 [RFC3344] defines
    a Mobile Router as a mobile node\n           that can be a router that is responsible
    for the mobility of\n           one or more entire networks moving together, perhaps
    on an\n           airplane, a ship, a train, an automobile, a bicycle, or a\n
    \          kayak.\n   Mobile Network Prefix\n           The network prefix of
    the subnet delegated to a Mobile Router\n           as the Mobile Network.\n   Prefix
    Table\n           A list of Mobile Network Prefixes indexed by the Home Address\n
    \          of a Mobile Router.  The Home Agent manages and uses the\n           Prefix
    Table to determine which Mobile Network Prefixes\n           belong to a particular
    Mobile Router.\n   Local Fixed Node\n           RFC 4885 [RFC4885] defines a Local
    Fixed Node (LFN) to be a\n           fixed node belonging to the Mobile Network
    and unable to\n           change its point of attachment.  This definition should
    not\n           be confused with \"Long, Fat Network, LFN\" of RFC 1323\n           [RFC1323],
    at least because the latter is pronounced\n           \"elephan(t)\" whereas a
    NEMO LFN is distinctively pronounced\n           \"elefen\".\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology

  - "3.  Requirements\n   Although the original Mobile IPv4 specifications stated
    that Mobile\n   Networks can be supported by the Mobile Router and Home Agent
    using\n   static configuration or running a routing protocol (see Section 4.5\n
    \  of RFC 3344 [RFC3344]), there is no solution for explicit\n   registration
    of the Mobile Networks served by the Mobile Router.  A\n   solution needs to provide
    the Home Agent a means to ensure that a\n   Mobile Router claiming a certain Mobile
    Network Prefix is authorized\n   to do so.  A solution would also expose the Mobile
    Network Prefixes\n   (and potentially other subnet-relevant information) in the
    exchanged\n   messages, to aid in network debugging.\n   The following requirements
    for Mobile Network support are enumerated:\n   o  A Mobile Router should be able
    to operate in explicit or implicit\n      mode.  A Mobile Router may explicitly
    inform the Home Agent which\n      Mobile Network(s) need to be propagated via
    a routing protocol.  A\n      Mobile Router may also function in implicit mode,
    where the Home\n      Agent may learn the Mobile Networks through other means,
    such as\n      from the AAA server, via pre-configuration, or via a dynamic\n
    \     routing protocol.\n   o  The Mobile Network should be supported using Foreign
    Agents that\n      are compliant to RFC 3344 [RFC3344] without any changes ('legacy'\n
    \     Foreign Agents).\n   o  The Mobile Network should allow Fixed Nodes, Mobile
    Nodes, or\n      Mobile Routers to be on it.\n   o  The Local Fixed Nodes on a
    Mobile Network should be able to\n      execute their sessions without running
    Mobile IP stacks.  The\n      Mobile Router managing the LFNs' Mobile Network
    is 'hiding'\n      mobility events like the changes of the Care-of Address from
    the\n      Local Fixed Nodes in that Mobile Network.\n"

    from the behavior of\n   a Mobile Node, as set in RFC 3344 [RFC3344].  In addition
    to\n   maintaining mobility bindings for its Home Address, the Mobile\n   Router,
    together with the Home Agent, maintains forwarding\n   information for the Mobile
    Network Prefix(es) assigned to the Mobile\n   Router.\n   A Mobile Router SHOULD
    set the 'T' bit to 1 in all Registration\n   Request messages it sends to indicate
    the need for reverse tunnels\n   for all traffic.  Without reverse tunnels, all
    the traffic from the\n   Mobile Network will be subject to ingress filtering in
    the visited\n   networks.  Upon reception of a successful Registration Reply,
    the\n   Mobile Router processes the registration in accordance to RFC 3344\n   [RFC3344].
    \ In addition, the following steps are taken:\n   o  Check for Mobile Network
    Acknowledgement extension(s) in\n      Registration Reply.\n   o  Create tunnel
    to the Home Agent if the Mobile Router is registered\n      in reverse tunneling
    mode.\n   o  Set up default route via this tunnel or egress interface when the\n
    \     Mobile Router is registered with or without reverse tunneling,\n      respectively.\n
    \  In accordance with this specification, a Mobile Router may operate in\n   one
    of the following two modes: explicit and implicit.  In explicit\n   mode, the
    Mobile Router includes Mobile Network Prefix information in\n   all Registration
    Requests (as Mobile Network Request extensions),\n   while in implicit mode it
    does not include this information in any\n   Registration Request.  In the latter
    case, the Home Agent obtains the\n   Mobile Network Prefixes by other means than
    Mobile IP.  One example\n   of obtaining the Mobile Network Prefix is through
    static\n   configuration on the Home Agent.\n   A Mobile Router can obtain a co-located
    or Foreign Agent Care-of\n   Address while operating in explicit or implicit modes.\n

      Requests coming from Mobile\n   Routers in accordance with this section.  RFC
      3344 [RFC3344]\n   specifies that the Home Address of a mobile node registering
      with a\n   Home Agent must belong to a prefix advertised on the home network.\n
      \  In accordance with this specification, however, the Home Address must\n   be
      configured from a prefix that is served by the Home Agent, not\n   necessarily
      the one on the home network.\n   If the Registration Request is valid, the Home
      Agent checks to see if\n   there are any Mobile Network Prefix extensions included
      in the\n   Registration Request.\n   If so, the Mobile Network Prefix information
      is obtained from the\n   included extensions, and the Home Address from the
      Home Address field\n   of the Registration Request.  For every Mobile Network
      Prefix\n   extension included in the registration request, the Home Agent MUST\n
      \  perform a check against the Prefix Table.  If the Prefix Table does\n   not
      contain at least one entry pairing that Home Address to that\n   Mobile Network
      Prefix, then the check fails; otherwise, it succeeds.\n   Following this check

      containing Mobile Network\n   Acknowledgement extensions.  For a Mobile Network
      Prefix for which\n   the check was unsuccessful, the Code field in the corresponding\n
      \  Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension should be set to\n   MOBNET_UNAUTHORIZED.\n
      \  For a Mobile Network Prefix for which the check was successful, the\n   Code

      \  Network Prefix extension for which the Prefix Table check was\n   successful.

      reasons such as not enough memory available or\n   not enough devices available),
      the Code field in the respective\n   Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension
      should be set to\n   MOBNET_FWDING_SETUP_FAILED.\n   If forwarding and setup
      was successful for at least one Mobile\n   Network Prefix, then the Code field
      (the proper) of the Registration\n   Reply message should be set to 0.  Otherwise,
      when forwarding and\n   setup was unsuccessful for each and every Mobile Network
      Prefixes,\n   that Code (the proper) should be HA_MOBNET_ERROR.\n   If the Registration
      Request is sent in implicit mode, i.e., without\n   any Mobile Network Request
      extension, the Home Agent may use pre-\n   configured Mobile Network prefix
      information for the Mobile Router to\n   set up forwarding.\n   If the Home
      Agent is updating an existing binding entry for the\n   Mobile Router, it MUST
      check all the prefixes in the Registration\n   Table against the prefixes included
      in the Registration Request.  If\n   one or more Mobile Network prefixes are
      missing from the included\n   information in the registration request, the Home
      Agent MUST delete\n   those prefixes from the registration table.  Also, the
      Home Agent\n   MUST disable forwarding for those prefixes.\n   If all checks
      are successful, the Home Agent either creates a new\n   entry for the Mobile
      Router or updates an existing binding entry for\n   it and returns a successful
      registration reply back to the Mobile\n   Router or the Foreign Agent (if the
      Registration Request was received\n   from a Foreign Agent).\n   In accordance
      with RFC 3344 [RFC3344], the Home Agent does proxy\n   Address Resolution Protocol
      (ARP) for the Mobile Router Home Address\n   when the Mobile Router Home Address
      is derived from the home network.\n   If the 'T' bit is set, the Home Agent
      creates a bi-directional tunnel\n   for the corresponding Mobile Network prefixes
      or updates the existing\n   bi-directional tunnel.  This tunnel is maintained

    Routers in a deep\n   nested aggregation of Mobile Networks might introduce significant\n

    benefits of running a dynamic routing protocol\n   between the Mobile Router and
    the Home Agent.  If the Mobile Network\n   is relatively large, including several
    wireless subnets, then the\n   topology changes within the moving network can
    be exposed from the\n   Mobile Router to the Home Agent by using a dynamic routing
    protocol.\n   The purpose of the NEMOv4 protocol extensions to Mobile IPv4, as\n
    \  defined in previous sections, is not to inform the Home Agent about\n   these
    topology changes, but to manage the mobility of the Mobile\n   Router.\n   Similarly,
    topology changes in the home network can be exposed to the\n   Mobile Router by
    using a dynamic routing protocol.  This may be\n   necessary when new fixed networks
    are added in the home network.\n   Here too, the purpose of NEMOv4 extensions
    is not to inform the\n   Mobile Router about topology changes at home.\n   Examples
    of dynamic routing protocols include, but are not limited\n   to, OSPF Version
    2 [RFC2328], BGP [RFC4271], and RIP [RFC2453].\n   The recommendations are related
    to how the routing protocol and the\n   Mobile IPv4 implementation work in tandem
    on the Mobile Router and on\n   the Home Agent (1) without creating incoherent
    states in the\n   forwarding information bases at home and on the Mobile Router,
    (2)\n   without introducing topologically incorrect addressing information in\n
    \  the visited domain, and (3) without duplicating sent data or over-\n   provisioning
    security.\n   The information exchanged between the Mobile Router and the Home\n
    \  Agent is sent over the bi-directional tunnel established by the\n   Mobile
    IPv4 exchange Registration Request - Registration Reply (see\n   Section 6.5).
    \ If a network address and prefix of a subnet in the\n   moving network is sent
    by the Mobile Router within a routing protocol\n   message, then they SHOULD NOT
    be sent in the Mobile IPv4 Registration\n   Request too.  This avoids incoherencies
    in the forwarding information\n   bases.  The Mobile Router SHOULD use NEMOv4
    implicit mode in this\n   case (see Section 3).\n   The Mobile Router SHOULD NOT
    send routing protocol information\n   updates in the foreign network.  The subnet
    addresses and prefixes\n   valid in the moving network are topologically incorrect
    in the\n   visited network.\n   If the Mobile Router and the Home Agent use a
    dynamic routing\n   protocol over the tunnel interface, and if that protocol offers\n
    \  security mechanisms to protect that protocol's messages, then the\n   security
    recommendations in Section 10.1 apply.\n"

    these Mobile Network Prefixes\n   on behalf of the Mobile Router.  Forwarding
    for prefixes MUST NOT be\n   set up without successful authorization of the Mobile
    Router for\n   those prefixes.  The Mobile Router MUST be notified when there
    is a\n   registration failure because it cannot be successfully authorized for\n
    \  prefixes it requested.\n   All Registration Requests and replies MUST be authenticated
    by the\n   MN-HA Authentication Extension as specified in RFC 3344 [RFC3344].\n
    \  When the registration request is sent in explicit mode, i.e., with\n   one
    or more Mobile Network Prefix extensions, all the Mobile Network\n   Prefix extensions
    MUST be included before the MN-HA Authentication\n   extension.  Also, these extensions
    MUST be included in the\n   calculation of the MN-HA authenticator value.\n   The
    Mobile Router should perform ingress filtering on all the packets\n   received
    on the Mobile Network prior to reverse tunneling them to the\n   Home Agent.  The
    Mobile Router MUST drop any packets that do not have\n   a source address belonging
    to the Mobile Network.\n   The Mobile Router MUST also ensure that the source
    address of packets\n   arriving on the Mobile Network is not the same as the Mobile
    Router's\n   IP address on any interface.  These checks will protect against nodes\n
    \  attempting to launch IP spoofing attacks through the bi-directional\n   tunnel.\n
    \  The Home Agent, upon receiving packets through the bi-directional\n   tunnel,
    MUST verify that the source addresses of the outer IP header\n   of the packets
    are set to the Mobile Router's Care-of Address.  Also,\n   it MUST ensure that
    the source address of the inner IP header is a\n   topologically correct address
    on the Mobile Network.  This will\n   prevent nodes from using the Home Agent
    to launch attacks inside the\n   protected network.\n"

      protocol is used between the Mobile Router and\n   the Home Agent to propagate
      the Mobile Network information into the\n   home network, the routing updates
      SHOULD be protected with IPsec ESP\n   confidentiality between the Mobile Router
      and Home Agent, to prevent\n   information about home network topology from
      being visible to\n   eavesdroppers.\n"

    George Tsirtsis, and Henrik Levkowetz for their helpful\n   discussions, reviews,
    and comments.  Vijay Devarapalli extensively\n   reviewed one of the later versions
    of the document.  Hans Sjostrand\n   identified the last clarifications with respect
    to Foreign Agent mode\n   treatment.  Pete McCann contributed necessary refinements
    of many\n   statements.\n   Mobile IPv4 versions as early as 1996 (RFC 2002 by
    Charles Perkins)\n   described Mobile Networks and Mobile Routers support.\n   Fred
    Templin indicated the potential confusion for the term \"LFN\".\n   Amanda Baber
    of IANA agreed on the principles of allocating numbers\n   for this specification
    and suggested improvements on the IANA\n   section.\n   Tim Polk of the IESG identified
    a deeply entrenched error on managing\n   the Code fields.\n   Lars Eggert of
    the IESG suggested the accommodation of the otherwise\n   legal non-contiguous
    netmask fields, instead of simply prefix\n   lengths.\n   Dan Romascanu of the
    IESG indicated the necessity of manageability of\n   Mobile Routers and NEMOv4-enabled
    Home Agents and their deployability\n   in MIP4 environments.\n   David Borman
    of TSV-DIR reviewed this document as part of the\n   transport area directorate's
    ongoing effort to review key IETF\n   documents.  The implications of the growth
    of usable MTU adversely\n   affecting applications deep in a Mobile Network were
    suggested.\n   Gonzalo Camarillo provided a generalist review by an additional
    set\n   of eyes for documents as they are being considered for publication\n   (General
    Area Review Team).\n   Jari Arkko of the IESG reviewed, suggested necessary improvements
    to,\n   and diligently shepherded this document through IESG.\n"
