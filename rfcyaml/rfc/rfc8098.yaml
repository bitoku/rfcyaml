  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a MIME content type that may be used by a Mail
    User\n   Agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a\n
    \  message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.\n   This content
    type is intended to be machine processable.  Additional\n   message header fields
    are also defined to permit Message Disposition\n   Notifications (MDNs) to be
    requested by the sender of a message.  The\n   purpose is to extend Internet Mail
    to support functionality often\n   found in other messaging systems, such as X.400
    and the proprietary\n   \"LAN-based\" systems, and are often referred to as \"read
    receipts,\"\n   \"acknowledgements,\" or \"receipt notifications.\"  The intention
    is to\n   do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been\n   expressed
    when such functions have been discussed in the past.\n   Because many messages
    are sent between the Internet and other\n   messaging systems (such as X.400 or
    the proprietary \"LAN-based\"\n   systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be
    useful in a\n   multiprotocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol\n
    \  described in this memo provides for the carriage of \"foreign\"\n   addresses,
    in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail.\n   Additional attributes
    may also be defined to support \"tunneling\" of\n   foreign notifications through
    Internet Mail.\n   This document is an Internet Standard.  It obsoletes RFC 3798
    and\n   updates RFC 2046 (message/partial media type handling) and RFC 3461\n
    \  (Original-Recipient header field generation requirement).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a media type [RFC2046] for Message Disposition\n
    \  Notifications (MDNs).  An MDN can be used to notify the sender of a\n   message
    of any of several conditions that may occur after successful\n   delivery, such
    as display of the message contents, printing of the\n   message, deletion (without
    display) of the message, or the\n   recipient's refusal to provide MDNs.  The
    \"message/disposition-\n   notification\" content type defined herein is intended
    for use within\n   the framework of the \"multipart/report\" content type defined
    in\n   RFC-REPORT [RFC6522].\n   This memo defines the format of the notifications
    and the RFC-MSGFMT\n   [RFC5322] header fields used to request them.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Purposes\n   The MDNs defined in this memo are expected to serve several
      purposes:\n   a.  Inform human beings of the disposition of messages after\n
      \      successful delivery in a manner that is largely independent of\n       human
      language;\n   b.  Allow mail user agents to keep track of the disposition of\n
      \      messages sent by associating returned MDNs with earlier message\n       transmissions;\n
      \  c.  Convey disposition notification requests and disposition\n       notifications
      between Internet Mail and \"foreign\" mail systems\n       via a gateway;\n
      \  d.  Allow \"foreign\" notifications to be tunneled through a MIME-\n       capable
      messaging system and back into the original messaging\n       system that issued
      the original notification, or even to a third\n       messaging system;\n   e.
      \ Allow language-independent, yet reasonably precise, indications\n       of
      the disposition of a message to be delivered.\n"

  - contents:
    - "1.2.  Requirements\n   These purposes place the following constraints on the
      notification\n   protocol:\n   a.  It must be readable by humans and must be
      machine parsable.\n   b.  It must provide enough information to allow message
      senders (or\n       their user agents) to unambiguously associate an MDN with
      the\n       message that was sent and the original recipient address for\n       which
      the MDN was issued (if such information is available), even\n       if the message
      was forwarded to another recipient address.\n   c.  It must also be able to
      describe the disposition of a message\n       independent of any particular
      human language or of the\n       terminology of any particular mail system.\n
      \  d.  The specification must be extensible in order to accommodate\n       future
      requirements.\n"

  - "2.  Requesting Message Disposition Notifications\n   Message disposition notifications
    are requested by including a\n   Disposition-Notification-To header field in the
    message containing\n   one or more addresses specifying where dispositions should
    be sent.\n   Further information to be used by the recipient's Mail User Agent\n
    \  (MUA) [RFC5598] in generating the MDN may be provided by also\n   including
    Original-Recipient and/or Disposition-Notification-Options\n   header fields in
    the message.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  The Disposition-Notification-To Header\n   A request for the receiving
      user agent to issue message disposition\n   notifications is made by placing
      a Disposition-Notification-To header\n   field into the message.  The syntax
      of the header field is\n   mdn-request-header = \"Disposition-Notification-To\"
      \":\"\n              mailbox-list CRLF\n   A Disposition-Notification-To header
      field can appear in a message at\n   most once.\n   The presence of a Disposition-Notification-To
      header field in a\n   message is merely a request for an MDN.  The recipients'
      user agents\n   are always free to silently ignore such a request.\n   An MDN
      MUST NOT itself have a Disposition-Notification-To header\n   field.  An MDN
      MUST NOT be generated in response to an MDN.\n   A user agent MUST NOT issue
      more than one MDN on behalf of each\n   particular recipient.  That is, once
      an MDN has been issued on behalf\n   of a recipient, no further MDNs may be
      issued on behalf of that\n   recipient by the same user agent, even if another
      disposition is\n   performed on the message.  However, if a message is forwarded,
      an MDN\n   may have been issued for the recipient doing the forwarding, and
      the\n   recipient of the forwarded message may also cause an MDN to be\n   generated.\n
      \  It is also possible that if the same message is being accessed by\n   multiple
      user agents (for example, using POP3), then multiple\n   dispositions might
      be generated for the same recipient.  User agents\n   SHOULD leverage support
      in the underlying message access protocol to\n   prevent multiple MDNs from
      being generated.  In particular, when the\n   user agent is accessing the message
      using RFC-IMAP [RFC3501], it\n   SHOULD implement the procedures specified in
      RFC-IMAP-MDN [RFC3503].\n   While Internet standards normally do not specify
      the behavior of user\n   interfaces, it is strongly recommended that the user
      agent obtain the\n   user's consent before sending an MDN.  This consent could
      be obtained\n   for each message through some sort of prompt or dialog box,
      or\n   globally through the user's setting of a preference.  The user might\n
      \  also indicate globally that MDNs are to never be sent.  The purpose\n   of
      obtaining user's consent is to protect user's privacy.  The\n   default value
      should be not to send MDNs.\n   MDNs MUST NOT be sent automatically if the address
      in the\n   Disposition-Notification-To header field differs from the address
      in\n   the Return-Path header field (see RFC-MSGFMT [RFC5322]).  In this\n   case,
      confirmation from the user MUST be obtained, if possible.  If\n   obtaining
      consent is not possible (e.g., because the user is not\n   online at the time
      or the client is not an interactive email client),\n   then an MDN MUST NOT
      be sent.\n   Confirmation from the user MUST be obtained (or no MDN sent) if
      there\n   is no Return-Path header field in the message or if there is more\n
      \  than one distinct address in the Disposition-Notification-To header\n   field.\n
      \  The comparison of the addresses is done using only the addr-spec\n   (local-part
      \"@\" domain) portion, excluding any angle brackets,\n   phrase, and route.
      \ As prescribed by RFC 5322, the comparison is case\n   sensitive for the local-part
      and case insensitive for the domain\n   part.  The local-part comparison SHOULD
      be done after performing\n   local-part canonicalization, i.e., after removing
      the surrounding\n   double-quote characters, if any, as well as any escaping
      \"\\\"\n   characters.  (See RFC-MSGFMT [RFC5322] for more details.)\n   Implementations
      MAY treat known domain aliases as equivalent for the\n   purpose of comparison.\n
      \  Note that use of subaddressing (see [RFC5233]) can result in a\n   failure
      to match two local-parts and thus result in possible\n   suppression of the
      MDN.  This document doesn't recommend special\n   handling for this case, as
      the receiving MUA can't reliably know\n   whether or not the sender is using
      subaddressing.\n   If the message contains more than one Return-Path header
      field, the\n   implementation may pick one to use for the comparison or treat
      the\n   situation as a failure of the comparison.\n   The reason for not automatically
      sending an MDN if the comparison\n   fails or more than one address is specified
      is to reduce the\n   possibility of mail loops and of MDNs being used for mail
      bombing.\n   It's especially important that a message that contains a Disposition-\n
      \  Notification-To header field also contain a Message-ID header field\n   to
      permit user agents to automatically correlate MDNs with their\n   original messages.\n
      \  If the request for message disposition notifications for some\n   recipients
      and not others is desired, two copies of the message\n   should be sent, one
      with a Disposition-Notification-To header field\n   and one without.  Many of
      the other header fields of the message\n   (e.g., To, Cc) will be the same in
      both copies.  The recipients in\n   the respective message envelopes determine
      from whom message\n   disposition notifications are requested and from whom
      they are not.\n   If desired, the Message-ID header field may be the same in
      both\n   copies of the message.  Note that there are other situations (e.g.,\n
      \  Bcc) in which it is necessary to send multiple copies of a message\n   with
      slightly different header fields.  The combination of such\n   situations and
      the need to request MDNs for a subset of all\n   recipients may result in more
      than two copies of a message being\n   sent, some with a Disposition-Notification-To
      header field and some\n   without.\n   If it is possible to determine that a
      recipient is a newsgroup, do\n   not include a Disposition-Notification-To header
      field for that\n   recipient.  Similarly, if an existing message is resent or
      gatewayed\n   to a newsgroup, the agent that is resending/gatewaying SHOULD
      strip\n   the Disposition-Notification-To header field.  See Section 5 for more\n
      \  discussion.  Clients that see an otherwise valid Disposition-\n   Notification-To
      header field in a newsgroup message SHOULD NOT\n   generate an MDN.\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.2.  The Disposition-Notification-Options Header\n   Extensions to this specification
      may require that information be\n   supplied to the recipient's MUA for additional
      control over how and\n   what MDNs are generated.  The Disposition-Notification-Options
      header\n   field provides an extensible mechanism for such information.  The\n
      \  syntax of this header field is as follows:\n   Disposition-Notification-Options
      =\n             \"Disposition-Notification-Options\" \":\" [FWS]\n                            disposition-notification-parameter-list

      header field can appear in a\n   message at most once.\n   An importance of
      \"required\" indicates that interpretation of the\n   disposition-notification-parameter
      is necessary for proper generation\n   of an MDN in response to this request.
      \ An importance of \"optional\"\n   indicates that an MUA that does not understand
      the meaning of this\n   disposition-notification-parameter MAY generate an MDN
      in response\n   anyway, ignoring the value of the disposition-notification-parameter.\n
      \  No disposition-notification-parameter attribute names are defined in\n   this
      specification.  Attribute names may be defined in the future by\n   later revisions
      or extensions to this specification.  Disposition-\n   notification-parameter
      attribute names MUST be registered with the\n   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
      (IANA) using the \"Specification\n   Required\" registration policy [RFC5226].
      \ The \"X-\" prefix has\n   historically been used to denote unregistered \"experimental\"
      protocol\n   elements that are assumed not to become common use.  Deployment\n
      \  experience of this and other protocols has shown that this assumption\n   is
      often false.  This document allows the use of the \"X-\" prefix\n   primarily
      to allow the registration of attributes that are already in\n   common use.
      \ The prefix has no meaning for new attributes.  Its use\n   in substantially
      new attributes may cause confusion and is therefore\n   discouraged.  (See Section
      10 for a registration form.)\n"

    - "2.3.  The Original-Recipient Header Field\n   Since electronic mail addresses
      may be rewritten while the message is\n   in transit, it is useful for the original
      recipient address to be\n   made available by the delivering Message Transfer
      Agent (MTA)\n   [RFC5598].  The delivering MTA may be able to obtain this information\n
      \  from the ORCPT parameter of the SMTP RCPT TO command, as defined in\n   RFC-SMTP
      [RFC5321] and RFC-DSN-SMTP [RFC3461].\n   RFC-DSN-SMTP [RFC3461] is amended
      as follows: if the ORCPT\n   information is available, the delivering MTA SHOULD
      insert an\n   Original-Recipient header field at the beginning of the message\n
      \  (along with the Return-Path header field).  The delivering MTA MAY\n   delete
      any other Original-Recipient header fields that occur in the\n   message.  The
      syntax of this header field is as follows:\n   original-recipient-header =\n
      \            \"Original-Recipient\" \":\" OWS address-type OWS\n             \";\"
      OWS generic-address OWS\n   OWS = [CFWS]\n         ; Optional whitespace.\n

      space or nothing.\n         ; It SHOULD be nothing at the end of a field.),\n
      \        ; unless an RFC 5322 \"comment\" is required.\n         ;\n         ;
      MDN parsers MUST parse it as \"[CFWS]\".\n   The address-type and generic-address
      tokens are as specified in the\n   description of the Original-Recipient field
      in Section 3.2.3.\n   The purpose of carrying the original recipient information
      and\n   returning it in the MDN is to permit automatic correlation of MDNs\n
      \  with the original message on a per-recipient basis.\n"

    - "2.4.  Use with the Message/Partial Media Type\n   The use of the header fields
      Disposition-Notification-To,\n   Disposition-Notification-Options, and Original-Recipient
      with the\n   MIME message/partial content type (RFC-MIME-MEDIA [RFC2046]) requires\n
      \  further definition.\n   When a message is segmented into two or more message/partial\n
      \  fragments, the three header fields mentioned in the above paragraph\n   SHOULD
      be placed in the \"inner\" or \"enclosed\" message (using the\n   terms of RFC-MIME-MEDIA

      of the fragments, they are ignored.\n   When the multiple message/partial fragments
      are reassembled, the\n   following applies.  If these header fields occur along
      with the other\n   header fields of a message/partial fragment message, they
      pertain to\n   an MDN that will be generated for the fragment.  If these header\n
      \  fields occur in the header fields of the \"inner\" or \"enclosed\"\n   message
      (using the terms of RFC-MIME-MEDIA [RFC2046]), they pertain\n   to an MDN that
      will be generated for the reassembled message.\n   Section 5.2.2.1 of RFC-MIME-MEDIA

- contents:
  - "3.  Format of a Message Disposition Notification\n   A message disposition notification
    is a MIME message with a top-level\n   content type of multipart/report (defined
    in RFC-REPORT [RFC6522]).\n   When multipart/report content is used to transmit
    an MDN:\n   a.  The report-type parameter of the multipart/report content is\n
    \      \"disposition-notification\".\n   b.  The first component of the multipart/report
    contains a human-\n       readable explanation of the MDN, as described in RFC-REPORT\n
    \      [RFC6522].\n   c.  The second component of the multipart/report is of content
    type\n       message/disposition-notification, described in Section 3.1 of\n       this
    document.\n   d.  If the original message or a portion of the message is to be\n
    \      returned to the sender, it appears as the third component of the\n       multipart/report.
    \ The decision of whether or not to return the\n       message or part of the
    message is up to the MUA generating the\n       MDN.  However, in the case of
    encrypted messages requesting MDNs,\n       if the original message or a portion
    thereof is returned, it MUST\n       be in its original encrypted form.\n   NOTE:
    For message disposition notifications gatewayed from foreign\n   systems, the
    header fields of the original message may not be\n   available.  In this case,
    the third component of the MDN may be\n   omitted, or it may contain \"simulated\"
    RFC-MSGFMT [RFC5322] header\n   fields that contain equivalent information.  In
    particular, it is\n   very desirable to preserve the subject and date fields from
    the\n   original message.\n   The MDN MUST be addressed (in both the message header
    field and the\n   transport envelope) to the address(es) from the Disposition-\n
    \  Notification-To header field from the original message for which the\n   MDN
    is being generated.\n   The From header field of the MDN MUST contain the address
    of the\n   person for whom the message disposition notification is being issued.\n
    \  The envelope sender address (i.e., SMTP \"MAIL FROM\") of the MDN MUST\n   be
    null (<>), specifying that no Delivery Status Notification\n   messages nor other
    messages indicating successful or unsuccessful\n   delivery are to be sent in
    response to an MDN.\n   A message disposition notification MUST NOT itself request
    an MDN.\n   That is, it MUST NOT contain a Disposition-Notification-To header\n
    \  field.\n   The Message-ID header field (if present) for an MDN MUST be different\n
    \  from the Message-ID of the message for which the MDN is being issued.\n   A
    particular MDN describes the disposition of exactly one message for\n   exactly
    one recipient.  Multiple MDNs may be generated as a result of\n   one message
    submission, one per recipient.  However, due to the\n   circumstances described
    in Section 2.1, it's possible that some of\n   the recipients for whom MDNs were
    requested will not generate MDNs.\n"

        reported interoperability problems, to work around or\n   tailor responses
        to avoid particular MUA limitations, and for\n   analytics regarding MUA or
        operating system use.  An MUA SHOULD send\n   a \"Reporting-UA\" field unless
        specifically configured not to do so.\n   If the reporting MUA consists of
        more than one component (e.g., a\n   base program and plug-ins), this may
        be indicated by including a list\n   of product names.\n   A reporting MUA
        SHOULD limit generated product identifiers to what is\n   necessary to identify
        the product; a sender MUST NOT generate\n   advertising or other nonessential
        information within the product\n   identifier.\n   A reporting MUA SHOULD

  - "5.  Conformance and Usage Requirements\n   An MUA or gateway conforms to this
    specification if it generates MDNs\n   according to the protocol defined in this
    memo.  It is not necessary\n   to be able to generate all of the possible values
    of the Disposition\n   field.\n   MUAs and gateways MUST NOT generate the Original-Recipient
    field of\n   an MDN unless the mail protocols provide the address originally\n
    \  specified by the sender at the time of submission.  Ordinary SMTP\n   does
    not make that guarantee, but the SMTP extension defined in RFC--\n   DSN-SMTP
    [RFC3461] permits such information to be carried in the\n   envelope if it is
    available.  The Original-Recipient header field\n   defined in this document provides
    a way for the MTA to pass the\n   original recipient address to the MUA.\n   Each
    sender-specified recipient address may result in more than one\n   MDN.  If an
    MDN is requested for a recipient that is forwarded to\n   multiple recipients
    of an \"alias\" (as defined in Section 6.2.7.3 of\n   RFC-DSN-SMTP [RFC3461]),
    each of the recipients may issue an MDN.\n   Successful distribution of a message
    to a mailing list exploder or\n   gateway to Usenet newsgroup SHOULD be considered
    the final\n   disposition of the message.  A mailing list exploder MAY issue an
    MDN\n   with a disposition type of \"processed\" and disposition modes of\n   \"automatic-action\"
    and \"MDN-sent-automatically\" indicating that the\n   message has been forwarded
    to the list.  In this case, the request\n   for MDNs is not propagated to the
    members of the list.\n   Alternatively (if successful distribution of a message
    to a mailing\n   list exploder / Usenet newsgroup is not considered the final\n
    \  disposition of the message), the mailing list exploder can issue no\n   MDN
    and propagate the request for MDNs to all members of the list.\n   The latter
    behavior is not recommended for any but small, closely\n   knit lists, as it might
    cause large numbers of MDNs to be generated\n   and may cause confidential subscribers
    to the list to be revealed.\n   The mailing list exploder can also direct MDNs
    to itself, correlate\n   them, and produce a report to the original sender of
    the message.\n   This specification places no restrictions on the processing of
    MDNs\n   received by user agents or mailing lists.\n"
  title: 5.  Conformance and Usage Requirements
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The following security considerations apply when
    using MDNs.\n"
  - contents:
    - "6.1.  Forgery\n   MDNs can be (and are, in practice) forged as easily as ordinary\n
      \  Internet electronic mail.  User agents and automatic mail handling\n   facilities
      (such as mail distribution list exploders) that wish to\n   make automatic use
      of MDNs should take appropriate precautions to\n   minimize the potential damage
      from denial-of-service attacks.\n   Security threats related to forged MDNs
      include the sending of:\n   a.  A falsified disposition notification when the
      indicated\n       disposition of the message has not actually occurred, and\n
      \  b.  Unsolicited MDNs.\n   Similarly, a forged spam or phishing email message
      can contain\n   Disposition-Notification-To header field that can trick the
      recipient\n   to send an MDN.  MDN processing should only be invoked once\n
      \  authenticity of an email message is verified.\n"
    title: 6.1.  Forgery
  - contents:
    - "6.2.  Privacy\n   Another dimension of security is privacy.  There may be cases
      in\n   which a message recipient does not wish the disposition of messages\n
      \  addressed to him to be known, or is concerned that the sending of\n   MDNs
      may reveal other sensitive information (e.g., when the message\n   was read,
      using which email client, and which OS was used).  In this\n   situation, it
      is acceptable for the MUA to silently ignore requests\n   for MDNs.\n   If the
      Disposition-Notification-To header field is passed on\n   unmodified when a
      message is distributed to the subscribers of a\n   mailing list, the subscribers
      to the list may be revealed to the\n   sender of the original message by the
      generation of MDNs.\n   Headers of the original message returned in part 3 of
      the multipart/\n   report, as well as content of the message/disposition-notification\n
      \  part, could reveal confidential information about host names and/or\n   network
      topology inside a firewall.\n   Disposition mode (Section 3.2.6.1) can leak
      information about\n   recipient's MUA configuration, in particular, whether
      MDNs are\n   acknowledged manually or automatically.  If this is a concern,
      MUAs\n   can return \"manual-action/MDN-sent-manually\" disposition mode in\n
      \  generated MDNs.\n   In general, any optional MDN field may be omitted if
      the Reporting\n   MUA site or user determines that inclusion of the field would
      impose\n   too great a compromise of site confidentiality.  The need for such\n
      \  confidentiality must be balanced against the utility of the omitted\n   information
      in MDNs.\n   In some cases, someone with access to the message stream may use
      the\n   MDN request mechanism to monitor the mail reading habits of a target.\n
      \  If the target is known to generate MDN reports, they could add a\n   Disposition-Notification-To
      header field containing the envelope from\n   address.  This risk can be minimized
      by not sending MDN's\n   automatically.\n"

    - "6.4.  Mail Bombing\n   The MDN request mechanism introduces an additional way
      of mail\n   bombing a mailbox.  The MDN request notification provides an address\n
      \  to which MDN's should be sent.  It is possible for an attacking agent\n   to
      send a potentially large set of messages to otherwise unsuspecting\n   third
      party recipients with a false Disposition-Notification-To\n   address.  Automatic
      or simplistic processing of such requests would\n   result in a flood of MDN
      notifications to the target of the attack.\n   Additionally, as generated MDN
      notifications can include the full\n   content of messages that caused them
      and thus they can be bigger than\n   such messages, they can be used for bandwidth
      amplification attacks.\n   Such an attack could overrun the storage capacity
      of the targeted\n   mailbox and/or of the mail transport system, and deny service.\n
      \  For that reason, MDN's SHOULD NOT be sent automatically where the\n   Disposition-Notification-To
      address is different from the SMTP \"MAIL\n   FROM\" address (which is carried
      in the Return-Path header field).\n   See Section 2.1 for further discussion.\n"

    recommendations for the\n   construction of mail gateways that wish to provide
    semi-transparent\n   disposition notifications between the Internet and another
    electronic\n   mail system.  Specific MDN gateway requirements for a particular
    pair\n   of mail systems may be defined by other documents.\n"
  - contents:
    - "8.1.  Gatewaying from Other Mail Systems to MDNs\n   A mail gateway may issue
      an MDN to convey the contents of a \"foreign\"\n   disposition notification
      over Internet Mail.  When there are\n   appropriate mappings from the foreign
      notification elements to MDN\n   fields, the information may be transmitted
      in those MDN fields.\n   Additional information (such as what might be needed
      to tunnel the\n   foreign notification through the Internet) may be defined
      in\n   extension MDN fields.  (Such fields should be given names that\n   identify
      the foreign mail protocol, e.g., X400-* for X.400 protocol\n   elements [X.400]).\n
      \  The gateway must attempt to supply reasonable values for the\n   Reporting-UA,
      Final-Recipient, and Disposition fields.  These will\n   normally be obtained
      by translating the values from the foreign\n   notification into their Internet-style
      equivalents.  However, some\n   loss of information is to be expected.\n   The
      sender-specified recipient address and the original message-id,\n   if present
      in the foreign notification, should be preserved in the\n   Original-Recipient
      and Original-Message-ID fields.\n   The gateway should also attempt to preserve
      the \"final\" recipient\n   address from the foreign system.  Whenever possible,
      foreign protocol\n   elements should be encoded as meaningful printable ASCII
      strings.\n   For MDNs produced from foreign disposition notifications, the name
      of\n   the gateway MUST appear in the MDN-Gateway field of the MDN.\n"

  - contents:
    - "8.2.  Gatewaying from MDNs to Other Mail Systems\n   It may be possible to
      gateway MDNs from the Internet into a foreign\n   mail system.  The primary
      purpose of such gatewaying is to convey\n   disposition information in a form
      that is usable by the destination\n   system.  A secondary purpose is to allow
      \"tunneling\" of MDNs through\n   foreign mail systems in case the MDN may be
      gatewayed back into the\n   Internet.\n   In general, the recipient of the MDN
      (i.e., the sender of the\n   original message) will want to know, for each recipient:
      the closest\n   available approximation to the original recipient address and
      the\n   disposition (displayed, printed, etc.).\n   If possible, the gateway
      should attempt to preserve the Original-\n   Recipient address and Original-Message-ID
      (if present) in the\n   resulting foreign disposition report.\n   If it is possible
      to tunnel an MDN through the destination\n   environment, the gateway specification
      may define a means of\n   preserving the MDN information in the disposition
      reports used by\n   that environment.\n"

    - "8.3.  Gatewaying of MDN-Requests to Other Mail Systems\n   By use of the separate
      Disposition-Notification-To request header\n   field, this specification offers
      a richer functionality than most, if\n   not all, other email systems.  In most
      other email systems, the\n   notification recipient is identical to the message
      sender as\n   indicated in the \"from\" address.  There are two interesting
      cases\n   when gatewaying into such systems:\n   1.  If the address in the Disposition-Notification-To
      header field is\n       identical to the address in the SMTP \"MAIL FROM\",
      the expected\n       behavior will result, even if the Disposition-Notification-To\n
      \      information is lost.  Systems should propagate the MDN request.\n   2.
      \ If the address in the Disposition-Notification-To header field is\n       different
      from the address in the SMTP \"MAIL FROM\", gatewaying\n       into a foreign
      system without a separate notification address\n       will result in unintended
      behavior.  This is especially important\n       when the message arrives via
      a mailing list expansion software\n       that may specifically replace the
      SMTP \"MAIL FROM\" address with\n       an alternate address.  In such cases,
      the MDN request should not\n       be gatewayed and should be silently dropped.
      \ This is consistent\n       with other forms of non-support for MDN.\n"

    \  \"X-\" fields no longer reserved for experimental use and can now be\n   registered
    in compliance with RFC 6648.\n   Fixed the default MTA-name-type used in \"MDN-Gateway\"
    to be \"dns\".\n   Strengthen requirements on obtaining user consent in order
    to protect\n   user privacy.\n   Removed discussion of using source routes with
    MDNs, as source route\n   is a deprecated Email feature.\n   The values of \"dispatched\"
    and \"processed\" were lost from the ABNF\n   for \"disposition-type\".  (Erratum
    #691)\n   Because the warning disposition modifier was previously removed, the\n
    \  warning-field has also been removed.  (Erratum #692)\n   Because the failed
    disposition type was previously removed, the\n   failure-field has also been removed.\n
    \  The ABNF for ua-name and ua-product included a semi-colon, which\n   could
    not be distinguished from *text in the production.  The ua-name\n   was restricted
    to not include semi-colon.  Semi-colon can still\n   appear in the ua-product.\n
    \  Removed recommendation to include the MUA DNS host name in the\n   \"Reporting-UA\"
    MDN field.\n   The ABNF did not indicate all places that whitespace was allowable,\n
    \  in particular folding whitespace, although all implementations allow\n   whitespace
    and folding in the header fields just like any other\n   header field formatted
    as described in RFC-MSGFMT [RFC5322].  There\n   were also a number of places
    in the ABNF that inconsistently\n   permitted comments and whitespace in one leg
    of the production and\n   not another.  The ABNF now specifies FWS and CFWS in
    several places\n   that should have already been specified by the grammar.\n   Extension-field
    was defined in the collected grammar but not in the\n   main text.\n   The comparison
    of mailboxes in Disposition-Notification-To to the\n   Return-Path addr-spec was
    clarified.\n   The use of the grammar production \"parameter\" was confusing with
    the\n   RFC 2045 [RFC2045] production of the same name, as well as other uses\n
    \  of the same term.  These have been clarified.\n   A clarification was added
    on the extent of the 7bit nature of MDNs.\n   Uses of the terms \"may\" and \"might\"
    were clarified.\n   A clarification was added on the order of the fields in the
    message/\n   disposition-notification content.\n"
