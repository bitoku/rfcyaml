  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5639] specified a new set of elliptic curve groups over\
    \ finite\n   prime fields for use in cryptographic applications.  These groups,\n\
    \   denoted as ECC Brainpool curves, were generated in a verifiably\n   pseudo-random\
    \ way and comply with the security requirements of\n   relevant standards from\
    \ ISO [ISO1] [ISO2], ANSI [ANSI1], NIST [FIPS],\n   and the Standards for Efficient\
    \ Cryptography Group [SEC2].\n   While the ASN.1 object identifiers defined in\
    \ RFC 5639 allow usage of\n   the ECC Brainpool curves in certificates and certificate\
    \ revocation\n   lists, their utilization for key exchange in IKEv2 [RFC5996]\
    \ requires\n   the definition and assignment of additional Diffie-Hellman Group\n\
    \   Transform IDs in the respective IANA registry.  This document\n   specifies\
    \ transform IDs for four curves from RFC 5639, as well as the\n   encoding of\
    \ the key exchange payload and derivation of the shared\n   secret when using\
    \ one of these curves.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  Key Exchange Payload and Shared Secret\n   For the encoding of the key\
    \ exchange payload and the derivation of\n   the shared secret, the methods specified\
    \ in [RFC5903] are adopted.\n   In an Elliptic Curve Group over GF[P] (ECP) key\
    \ exchange in IKEv2,\n   the Diffie-Hellman public value passed in a key establishment\
    \ (KE)\n   payload consists of two components, x and y, corresponding to the\n\
    \   coordinates of an elliptic curve point.  Each component MUST be\n   computed\
    \ from the corresponding coordinate using the FieldElement-to-\n   OctetString\
    \ conversion method specified in [SEC1] and MUST have a bit\n   length as indicated\
    \ in Table 2.  This length is enforced by the\n   FieldElement-to-OctetString\
    \ conversion method, if necessary, by\n   prepending the value with zeros.\n \
    \  Note: The FieldElement-to-OctetString conversion method specified in\n   [SEC1]\
    \ is equivalent to applying the conversion between integers and\n   octet strings\
    \ (as described in Section 6 of [RFC6090]) after\n   representing the field element\

    \   The Diffie-Hellman shared secret value consists only of the x value.\n   In\
    \ particular, the shared secret value MUST be computed from the\n   x-coordinate\
    \ of the Diffie-Hellman common value using the\n   FieldElement-to-OctetString\
    \ conversion method specified in [SEC1] and\n   MUST have bit length as indicated\
    \ in Table 2.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC5996] apply\
    \ accordingly.\n   In order to thwart certain active attacks, the validity of\
    \ the other\n   peer's public Diffie-Hellman value (x,y) recovered from the received\n\
    \   key exchange payload needs to be verified.  In particular, it MUST be\n  \
    \ verified that the x- and y-coordinates of the public value satisfy\n   the curve\
    \ equation.  For additional information, we refer the reader\n   to [RFC6989].\n\
    \   The confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of a secure\n   communication\
    \ based on IKEv2 are limited by the weakest cryptographic\n   primitive applied.\
    \  In order to achieve a maximum security level when\n   using one of the elliptic\
    \ curves from Table 1 for key exchange, the\n   following should be chosen according\
    \ to the recommendations of\n   [NIST800-57] and [RFC5639]:\n   o  key derivation\
    \ function\n   o  algorithms and key lengths of symmetric encryption and message\n\
    \      authentication\n   o  algorithm, bit length, and hash function used for\
    \ signature\n      generation\n   Furthermore, the private Diffie-Hellman keys\
    \ should be selected with\n   the same bit length as the order of the group generated\
    \ by the base\n   point G and with approximately maximum entropy.\n   Implementations\
    \ of elliptic curve cryptography for IKEv2 could be\n   susceptible to side-channel\
    \ attacks.  Particular care should be taken\n   for implementations that internally\
    \ use the corresponding twisted\n   curve to take advantage of an efficient arithmetic\
    \ for the special\n   parameters (A = -3): although the twisted curve itself offers\
    \ the\n   same level of security as the corresponding random curve (through\n\
    \   mathematical equivalence), an arithmetic based on small curve\n   parameters\
    \ could be harder to protect against side-channel attacks.\n   General guidance\
    \ on resistance of elliptic curve cryptography\n   implementations against side-channel\
    \ attacks is given in [BSI1] and\n   [HMV].\n"
