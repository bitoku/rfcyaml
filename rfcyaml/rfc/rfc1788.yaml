- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC-1034].\
    \  The IN-ADDR\n   domain of the DNS is specified [RFC-1035] to perform address\
    \ to\n   domain name resolution, and to facilitate queries to locate all\n   gateways\
    \ (routers) on a particular network in the Internet.\n   Neither function has\
    \ been remarkably successful.  The IN-ADDR domain\n   is not reliably populated.\n\
    \   As multiple routers were used at boundaries and within networks, the\n   IN-ADDR\
    \ mechanism was found to be inadequate.  The location of\n   routers by hosts\
    \ is now performed using \"ICMP Router Discovery\n   Messages\" [RFC-1256].\n\
    \   As network numbers migrated to \"classless\" routing and aggregation,\n  \
    \ the IN-ADDR delegation granularity has fragmented, and requires\n   overlapping\
    \ administration.  The \"reverse\" IN-ADDR administration\n   frequently does\
    \ not follow the same delegation as the \"forward\"\n   domain name tree.  This\
    \ structure is not amenable to cooperative\n   secure updating of the DNS.\n \
    \  As application servers have appeared which require the Domain Name\n   for\
    \ user interaction and security logging, the IN-ADDR servers have\n   been inundated\
    \ with queries.  This produces long user visible pauses\n   at the initiation\
    \ of sessions.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Direct Query
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Direct Query\n   This document proposes that each unicast address be queried\
    \ directly\n   for its corresponding Domain Name.  This has the advantages that\
    \ the\n   naming is under the same administration as the address assignment,\n\
    \   and the queries are distributed in the same fashion as IP routing.\n   In\
    \ effect, the routing is used to index the database.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Multicast
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Multicast\n   Only a few well-known multicast addresses are populated in\
    \ the IN-\n   ADDR domain.  The ephemeral nature of most multicast addresses is\
    \ not\n   conducive to cooperative secure updating of the DNS.\n   However, the\
    \ technique described here is not useful for multicast\n   addresses.  A query\
    \ to a multicast address could result in a storm of\n   replies.  Most multicast\
    \ groups are not named, or the member nodes\n   are not configured with the name.\n\
    \   The IN-ADDR method SHOULD continue to be used for reverse lookup of\n   well-known\
    \ multicast addresses in the range 224.0.0.0 to\n   224.0.255.255.  Other multicast\
    \ addresses are an issue for futher\n   study.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Domain Names
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Domain Names\n   Each Domain Name is expressed as a sequence of labels.\
    \  Each label is\n   represented as a one octet length field, followed by that\
    \ number of\n   octets.  Since every Domain Name ends with the null label of the\n\
    \   root, a Domain Name is terminated by a length byte of zero.  The most\n  \
    \ significant two bits of every length octet must be '00', and the\n   remaining\
    \ six bits of the length field limit the label to 63 octets\n   or less.\n   When\
    \ the most significant two bits of the length octet are '11', the\n   length is\
    \ interpreted as a 2 octet sequence, indicating an offset\n   from the beginning\
    \ of the message (Type field).  Further details are\n   described in [RFC-1035]\
    \ \"Message Compression\".\n   To simplify implementations, the total length of\
    \ a Domain Name\n   (including label octets and label length octets) is restricted\
    \ to 255\n   octets or less.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Messages
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Messages\n   The datagram format and basic facilities are already defined\
    \ for ICMP\n   [RFC-792].\n   Up-to-date values of the ICMP Type field are specified\
    \ in the most\n   recent \"Assigned Numbers\" [RFC-1700].  This document concerns\
    \ the\n   following values:\n       37  Domain Name Request\n       38  Domain\

- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   A primary purpose of this specification is to provide\
    \ a mechanism for\n   address to name resolution which is more secure than the\
    \ IN-ADDR\n   reverse tree.  This mechanism is amenable to use of the IP Security\n\
    \   Protocols for authentication and privacy.\n   Although the routing infrastructure\
    \ to the Destination does not\n   provide security in and of itself, it is as\
    \ least as reliable as\n   delivery of correspondence for the other sessions with\
    \ the same peer.\n   A DNS cryptographic signature, located by using the reply\
    \ in the\n   forward DNS direction, can be used to verify the reply itself.\n"
