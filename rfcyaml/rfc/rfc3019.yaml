- title: 1. The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1. The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].\n   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and\
    \ events for the\n   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16,\n\
    \   RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215\n   [RFC1215].\
    \  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,\n   RFC 2578 [RFC2578],\
    \ STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n   Message protocols\
    \ for transferring management information.  The first\n   version of the SNMP\
    \ message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described\n   in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].\
    \  A second version of the SNMP message\n   protocol, which is not an Internet\
    \ standards track protocol, is\n   called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]\
    \ and RFC 1906\n   [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol is called\n\
    \   SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and\n   RFC\
    \ 2574 [RFC2574].\n   Protocol operations for accessing management information.\
    \  The first\n   set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described\
    \ in\n   STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations and\n\
    \   associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [RFC1905].\n   A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573] and\n   the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2575\n   [RFC2575].\n   A more detailed introduction\
    \ to the current SNMP Management Framework\n   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].\n\
    \   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using\
    \ the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that\
    \ is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced\
    \ through the appropriate\n   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must\
    \ be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because\
    \ no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable\n\
    \   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1\
    \ during the translation process.  However, this loss of\n   machine-readable\
    \ information is not considered to change the\n   semantics of the MIB.\n"
- title: 2. Overview
  contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   This MIB module contains two tables:\n      1. The MLD Interface\
    \ Table, which contains one row for each\n         interface on which MLD is enabled.\n\
    \      2. The MLD Cache Table which contains one row for each IPv6\n         Multicast\
    \ group for which there are members on a particular\n         interface.\n   Both\
    \ tables are intended to be implemented by hosts and routers. Some\n   objects\
    \ in each table apply to routers only.\n"

- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide\
    \ information\n   related to multicast sessions.  Some of these objects could\
    \ contain\n   sensitive information.  In particular, the mldCacheSelf and\n  \
    \ mldCacheLastReporter could be used to identify machines which are\n   listening\
    \ to a given group address.  There are also a number of\n   objects that have\
    \ a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-\n   create, which allow an administrator\
    \ to configure MLD in the router.\n   While unauthorized access to the readable\
    \ objects is relatively\n   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects\
    \ could cause\n   a denial of service.  Hence, the support of SET operations in\
    \ a non-\n   secure environment without proper protection can have a negative\n\
    \   effect on network operations.\n   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.\
    \  Even if the\n   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even\
    \ then,\n   there is no control as to who on the network is allowed to access\
    \ and\n   SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended\
    \ that the implementers consider the security\n   features as provided by the\
    \ SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based Security Model\
    \ RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-\n   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575]\
    \ is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that\
    \ the SNMP\n   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give\n\
    \   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have\n   legitimate\
    \ rights to access them.\n"
