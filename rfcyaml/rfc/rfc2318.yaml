  - "1.  Introduction\n   The World Wide Web Consortium has issued a Recommendation\
    \ [1], which\n   defines Cascading Style Sheets, level 1. This memo provides\n\
    \   information about the text/css Media Type.\n"
- title: 2.  Cascading Style Sheets
  contents:
  - "2.  Cascading Style Sheets\n   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet\
    \ language for the World\n   Wide Web. It describes the presentation (e.g. fonts,\
    \ colors and\n   spacing) of structured documents. CSS is human readable and writable,\n\
    \   and expresses style in common desktop publishing terminology.\n   CSS style\
    \ sheets have been in use since October 1995 using the Media\n   Type text/css\
    \ without registration; this memo seeks to regularize\n   that position.\n   A\
    \ CSS style sheet can be either:\n   (1) external - the style sheet is linked\
    \ to a document through a\n       URI and exists as a separate object on the Web.\
    \ The media type\n       text/css is used when fetching the object, for example\
    \ in the\n       Content-Type and Accept header fields of HTTP [2].\n   (2) internal\
    \ - the style sheet is contained within the document. A\n       typical scenario\
    \ is an HTML [3] document that contains a style\n       sheet within the STYLE\
    \ element. Due to this close relationship,\n       HTML and CSS share the same\
    \ top-level name (\"text\").\n"

  - "4.  Registration Information\n       To: ietf-types@iana.org\n       Subject:\
    \ Registration of MIME media type text/css\n       MIME media type name: text\n\
    \       MIME subtype name: css\n       Required parameters: none\n       Optional\
    \ parameters: charset\n       The syntax of CSS is expressed in US-ASCII, but\
    \ a CSS file can\n       contain strings which may use any Unicode character.\
    \ Any charset\n       that is a superset of US-ASCII may be used; US-ASCII, iso-8859-X\n\
    \       and utf-8 are recommended.\n   Encoding considerations:\n       For use\
    \ with transports that are not 8-bit clean, quoted-\n       printable encoding\
    \ is recommended since the majority of\n       characters will be CSS syntax and\
    \ thus US-ASCII\n   Security considerations:\n       Applying a style sheet to\
    \ a document may hide information\n       otherwise visible. For example, a very\
    \ small font size may be\n       specified, or the display of certain document\
    \ elements may be\n       turned off.\n       CSS style sheets consist of declarative\
    \ property/value pairs\n       assigned to element selectors. They contain no\
    \ executable code.\n       As with HTML documents, CSS style sheets may contain\
    \ links to\n       other media (images, sounds, fonts, other style sheets) and\
    \ those\n       links are typically followed automatically by software, resulting\n\
    \       in the transfer of files without the explicit request of the user\n  \
    \     for each one. The security considerations of each linked file are\n    \
    \   those of the individual registered types.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n\
    \       CSS has proven to be widely interoperable across computer\n       platforms,\
    \ across Web browsers of different makes, and for import\n       and export in\
    \ multiple authoring tools.\n   Published specification: see [1]\n   Applications\
    \ which use this media type:\n       CSS is device-, platform- and vendor-neutral\
    \ and is supported by\n       a wide range of Web user agents and authoring tools\
    \ for\n       formatting HTML and XML documents.\n   Additional information:\n\
    \       Magic number(s): none\n       File extension(s): .css\n       Macintosh\
    \ File Type Code(s): \"css \"\n       Object Identifier(s) or OID(s): none\n \
    \  Person & email address to contact for further information:\n       The authors\
    \ of this memo.\n   Intended usage: COMMON\n     Author/Change controller:\n"
