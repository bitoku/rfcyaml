July, 1975, Survey of New Protocol TELNET Servers In the nearly five months since the last report several new server sites have joined the network and there has been some significant progress in New Protocol implementation.
Perhaps the New Protocol implementation on the TIPs scheduled for the end of the year will encourage further progress in the near future.
There have been numerous changes since the last list (numbers in octal): SRI ARC (2) is no longer a server host; MIT AI (206), MIT ML (306), LONDON (52), and OFFICE 1 (53) have added New Protocol servers; LLL RISOS (25), SDAC 44 (32), and ARPA DMS (34) have joined the network; SCI TENEX (55), Rutgers 10 (56), USC ISIC (364), and SUMEX AIM (70) have joined the network with New Protocol servers.
The following is the latest version  of the summary and tabulation of server host TELNET servers.
All data in this report were gathered via a surveying program run at various times, plus a few manual checks to fill out the list.
What is reported here is the way the various servers work as seen by the new Protocol User Telnet at BBNA, as of 10 July 1975.
These are the sites whose operation is 100% correct according to all protocols and conventions, as I understand them.
(3) We realize that some of the servers that appear here as New Protocol servers on socket 1 are actually servers which attempt to communicate with both Old  and New Protocol User TELNETs according to what control sequences are received.
Tabulation of server status for all server sites:
No server at this socket ?
Status not ascertained unable to connect to host I
# Option # implemented outgoing from user
(# is option number in new Protocol, Options in tabulation: 0
These servers return improper responses to some TELNET option requests.
