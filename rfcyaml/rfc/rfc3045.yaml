  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies two Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n\
    \   (LDAP) attributes, vendorName and vendorVersion that MAY be included\n   in\
    \ the root DSA-specific Entry (DSE) to advertise vendor-specific\n   information.\
    \  These two attributes supplement the attributes defined\n   in section 3.4 of\
    \ RFC 2251.\n   The information held in these attributes MAY be used for display\
    \ and\n   informational purposes and MUST NOT be used for feature advertisement\n\
    \   or discovery.\n"

- title: 1. Overview
  contents:
  - "1. Overview\n   LDAP clients discover server-specific data--such as available\n\
    \   controls, extensions, etc.--by reading the root DSE.  See section 3.4\n  \
    \ of [RFC2251] for details.\n   For display, information, and limited function\
    \ discovery, it is\n   desirable to be able to query an LDAP server to determine\
    \ the vendor\n   name of that server and also to see what version of that vendor's\n\
    \   code is currently installed.\n"
- title: 1.1 Function discovery
  contents:
  - "1.1 Function discovery\n   There are many ways in which a particular version\
    \ of a vendor's LDAP\n   server implementation may be functionally incomplete,\
    \ or may contain\n   software anomalies.  It is impossible to identify every known\n\
    \   shortcoming of an LDAP server with the given set of server data\n   advertisement\
    \ attributes.  Furthermore, often times, the anomalies of\n   an implementation\
    \ are not found until after the implementation has\n   been distributed, deployed,\
    \ and is in use.\n   The attributes defined in this document MAY be used by client\n\
    \   implementations in order to identify a particular server\n   implementation\
    \ so that it can 'work around' such anomalies.\n   The attributes defined in this\
    \ document MUST NOT be used to gather\n   information related to supported features\
    \ of an LDAP implementation.\n   All LDAP features, mechanisms, and capabilities--if\
    \ advertised--MUST\n   be advertised through other mechanisms, preferably advertisement\n\
    \   mechanisms defined in concert with said features, mechanisms, and\n   capabilities.\n"
- title: 2. Attribute Types
  contents:
  - "2. Attribute Types\n   These attributes are an addition to the Server-specific\
    \ Data\n   Requirements defined in section 3.4 of [RFC2251].  The associated\n\
    \   syntaxes are defined in section 4 of [RFC2252].\n   Servers MAY restrict access\
    \ to vendorName or vendorVersion and\n   clients MUST NOT expect these attributes\
    \ to be available.\n"
- title: 2.1 vendorName
  contents:
  - "2.1 vendorName\n   This attribute contains a single string, which represents\
    \ the name of\n   the LDAP server implementer.\n   All LDAP server implementations\
    \ SHOULD maintain a vendorName, which\n   is generally the name of the company\
    \ that wrote the LDAP Server code\n   like \"Novell, Inc.\"\n      ( 1.3.6.1.1.4\
    \ NAME 'vendorName' EQUALITY\n        1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.109.114.1 SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15\n\
    \        SINGLE-VALUE NO-USER-MODIFICATION USAGE dSAOperation )\n"
- title: 2.2 vendorVersion
  contents:
  - "2.2 vendorVersion\n   This attribute contains a string which represents the version\
    \ of the\n   LDAP server implementation.\n   All LDAP server implementations SHOULD\
    \ maintain a vendorVersion.\n   Note that this value is typically a release value--comprised\
    \ of a\n   string and/or a string of numbers--used by the developer of the LDAP\n\
    \   server product (as opposed to the supportedLDAPVersion, which\n   specifies\
    \ the version of the LDAP protocol supported by this server).\n   This is single-valued\
    \ so that it will only have one version value.\n   This string MUST be unique\
    \ between two versions, but there are no\n   other syntactic restrictions on the\
    \ value or the way it is formatted.\n      ( 1.3.6.1.1.5 NAME 'vendorVersion'\
    \ EQUALITY\n        1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.109.114.1 SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15\n\
    \        SINGLE-VALUE NO-USER-MODIFICATION USAGE dSAOperation )\n   The intent\
    \ behind the equality match on vendorVersion is to not allow\n   a less than or\
    \ greater than type of query.  Say release \"LDAPv3 8.0\"\n   has a problem that\
    \ is fixed in the next release \"LDAPv3 8.5\", but in\n   the mean time there\
    \ is also an update release say version \"LDAPv3\n   8.01\" that fixes the problem.\
    \  This will hopefully stop the client\n   from saying it will not work with a\
    \ version less than \"LDAPv3 8.5\"\n   when it would also work with \"LDAPv3 8.01\"\
    .  With the equality match\n   the client would have to exactly match what it\
    \ is looking for.\n"
- title: 3. Notes to Server Implementers
  contents:
  - "3. Notes to Server Implementers\n   Server implementers may consider tying the\
    \ vendorVersion attribute\n   value to the build mechanism so that it is automatically\
    \ updated when\n   the version value changes.\n"
- title: 4. Notes to Client Developers
  contents:
  - "4. Notes to Client Developers\n   As mentioned in section 2.1, the use of vendorName\
    \ and vendorVersion\n   MUST NOT be used to discover features.\n   It should be\
    \ noted that an anomalies often on affect subset of\n   implementations reporting\
    \ the same version information.  Most\n   implementations support multiple platforms,\
    \ have numerous\n   configuration options, and often support plug-ins.\n   Client\
    \ implementations SHOULD be written in such a way as to accept\n   any value in\
    \ the vendorName and vendorVersion attributes.  If a\n   client implementation\
    \ does not recognize the specific vendorName or\n   vendorVersion as one it recognizes,\
    \ then for the purposes of 'working\n   around' anomalies, the client MUST assume\
    \ that the server is complete\n   and correct.  The client MUST work with implementations\
    \ that do not\n   publish these attributes.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The vendorName and vendorVersion attributes are\
    \ provided only as\n   display or informational mechanisms, or as anomaly identifying\n\
    \   mechanisms.  Client and application implementers must consider that\n   the\
    \ existence of a given value in the vendorName or vendorVersion\n   attribute\
    \ is no guarantee that the server was actually built by the\n   asserted vendor\
    \ or that its version is the asserted version and\n   should act accordingly.\n\
    \   Server implementers should be aware that this information could be\n   used\
    \ to exploit a security hole a server provides either by feature\n   or flaw.\n"
- title: 6. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. IANA Considerations\n   This document seeks to create two attributes, vendorName\
    \ and\n   vendorVersion, which the IANA will primarily be responsible.  This is\n\
    \   a one time effort; there is no need for any recurring assignment\n   after\
    \ this stage.\n"
