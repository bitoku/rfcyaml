  - "1.  Introduction\n   Comcast is a large broadband Internet Service Provider (ISP),\
    \ based\n   in the U.S., serving the majority of its customers via cable modem\n\
    \   technology.  A trial was conducted in July 2008 with Pando Networks,\n   Yale,\
    \ and several ISP members of the P4P working group, which is part\n   of the Distributed\
    \ Computing Industry Association (DCIA).  Comcast is\n   a member of the DCIA's\
    \ P4P Working Group, whose mission is to work\n   with Internet Service Providers\
    \ (ISPs), peer-to-peer (P2P) companies,\n   and technology researchers to develop\
    \ \"P4P\" mechanisms, such as so-\n   called \"iTrackers\" (hereafter P4P iTrackers),\
    \ that accelerate\n   distribution of content and optimize utilization of ISP\
    \ network\n   resources.  P4P iTrackers theoretically allow P2P networks to\n\
    \   optimize traffic within each ISP, reducing the volume of data\n   traversing\
    \ the ISP's infrastructure and creating a more manageable\n   flow of data.  P4P\
    \ iTrackers can also accelerate P2P downloads for\n   end users.\n   P4P's iTracker\
    \ technology [SIGCOMM] was conceptually discussed with\n   the IETF at the Peer-to-Peer\
    \ Infrastructure (P2Pi) Workshop held on\n   May 28, 2008, at the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT), as\n   documented in [RFC5594].  This work was\
    \ discussed in greater detail\n   at the 72nd meeting of the IETF, in Dublin,\
    \ Ireland, in the ALTO BoF\n   (Birds of a Feather meeting) on July 29, 2008.\
    \  Due to interest from\n   the community, Comcast shared P4P iTracker trial data\
    \ at the 73rd\n   meeting of the IETF, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the ALTO\
    \ BoF on\n   November 18, 2008.  Since that time, discussion of P4P iTrackers\
    \ and\n   alternative technologies has continued among participants of the ALTO\n\
    \   working group.\n   The P4P iTracker trial was conducted, in cooperation with\
    \ Pando,\n   Yale, and three other P4P member ISPs, from July 2 to July 17, 2008.\n\
    \   This was the first P4P iTracker trial over a cable broadband network.\n  \
    \ The trial used a Pando P2P client, and Pando distributed a special\n   21-MB\
    \ licensed video file in order to measure the effectiveness of\n   P4P iTrackers.\
    \  A primary objective of the trial was to measure the\n   effects that increasing\
    \ the localization of P2P swarms would have on\n   P2P uploads, P2P downloads,\
    \ and ISP networks, in comparison to normal\n   P2P activity.\n"
- title: 2.  High-Level Details
  contents:
  - "2.  High-Level Details\n   As noted in Section 1 of [DynamicSwarmMgmt], a swarm\
    \ is defined in\n   the following way:\n      The content and the set of peers\
    \ distributing it [a file] is\n      usually called a torrent.  A peer that only\
    \ uploads content is\n      called a seed, while a peer that uploads and downloads\
    \ at the same\n      time is called a leecher.  The connected set of peers\n \
    \     participating in the piece exchanges of a torrent is referred to\n     \
    \ as a swarm.\n   There were five different swarms for the content used in the\
    \ trial.\n   The second, third, and fourth used different P4P iTrackers: Generic,\n\
    \   Coarse Grained, and Fine Grained, all of which are described in\n   Section\
    \ 3.  The fifth was a proprietary Pando mechanism.  (The\n   results of the fifth\
    \ swarm, while satisfactory, are not included here\n   since our focus is on open\
    \ standards and a mechanism that may be\n   leveraged for the benefit of the entire\
    \ community of P2P clients.)\n   Comcast deployed a P4P iTracker server in its\
    \ production network to\n   support this trial, and configured multiple iTracker\
    \ files to provide\n   varying levels of localization to clients.\n   In the trial\
    \ itself, a P2P client begins a P2P session by querying a\n   pTracker, which\
    \ runs and manages the P2P network.  The pTracker\n   occasionally queries the\
    \ P4P iTracker, which in this case was\n   maintained by Comcast, the ISP.  Other\
    \ ISPs either managed their own\n   P4P iTracker or used Pando or Yale to host\
    \ their P4P iTracker files.\n   The P4P iTracker returns network topology information\
    \ to the\n   pTracker, which then communicates with P2P clients, in order to\n\
    \   enable P2P clients to make network-aware decisions regarding peers.\n   The\
    \ Pando client was enabled to capture extended logging, when the\n   version of\
    \ the client included support for it.  The extended logging\n   included the source\
    \ and destination IP address of all P2P transfers,\n   the number of bytes transferred,\
    \ and the start and end timestamps.\n   This information gives a precise measurement\
    \ of the data flow in the\n   network, allowing computation of data transfer volumes\
    \ as well as\n   data flow rates at each point in time.  With standard logging,\
    \ Pando\n   captured the start and completion times of every download, as well\
    \ as\n   the average transfer rate observed by the client for the download.\n\
    \   Pando served the data from an origin server external to Comcast's\n   network.\
    \  This server served about 10 copies of the file, after which\n   all transfers\
    \ (about 1 million downloads across all ISPs) were\n   performed purely via P2P.\n\
    \   The P2P clients in the trial start with tracker-provided peers, then\n   use\
    \ peer exchange to discover additional peers.  Thus, the initial\n   peers were\
    \ provided according to P4P iTracker guidance (90% guidance\n   based on P4P iTracker\
    \ topology and 10% random guidance), then later\n   peers discover the entire\
    \ swarm via either additional announces or\n   peer exchange.\n"
- title: 3.  Differences between the P4P iTrackers Used
  contents:
  - "3.  Differences between the P4P iTrackers Used\n   Given the size of the Comcast\
    \ network, it was felt that in order to\n   truly evaluate the P4P iTracker application\
    \ we would need to test\n   various network topologies that reflected its network\
    \ and would help\n   gauge the level of effort and design requirements necessary\
    \ to get\n   correct statistical data out of the trial.  In all cases, P4P\n \
    \  iTrackers were configured with automation in mind, so that any\n   successful\
    \ P4P iTracker configuration would be automatically\n   updating, rather than\
    \ manually configured on an ongoing basis.  All\n   P4P iTrackers were hosted\
    \ on the same small server, and it appeared\n   to be relatively easy and inexpensive\
    \ to scale up a P4P iTracker\n   infrastructure should P4P iTracker-like mechanisms\
    \ become\n   standardized and widely adopted.\n"
- title: 3.1.  P4P Fine Grain
  contents:
  - "3.1.  P4P Fine Grain\n   The Fine Grain topology was the first and most complex\
    \ P4P iTracker\n   that we built for this trial.  It was a detailed mapping of\
    \ Comcast\n   backbone-connected network Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) to IP\n\
    \   Aggregates, which were weighted based on priority and distance from\n   each\
    \ other.  Included in this design was a prioritization of all Peer\n   and Internet\
    \ transit connected ASNs to the Comcast backbone to ensure\n   that P4P traffic\
    \ would prefer settlement-free and lower-cost networks\n   first, and then more\
    \ expensive transit links.  This attempted to\n   optimize and lower transit costs\
    \ associated with this traffic.  We\n   then took the additional step of detailing\
    \ each ASN and IP Aggregate\n   into IP subnets down to Optical Transport Nodes\
    \ (OTNs) where all\n   Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS, as briefly defined\
    \ in Section\n   2.6 of [RFC3083]) reside .  This design gave a highly localized\
    \ and\n   detailed description of the Comcast network for the iTracker to\n  \
    \ disseminate.  This design defined 1,182 P4P iTracker node\n   identifiers, and\
    \ resulted in a 107,357-line configuration file.\n   This P4P iTracker was obviously\
    \ the most time-consuming to create and\n   the most complex to maintain.  Trial\
    \ results indicated that this\n   level of localization was too high, and was\
    \ less effective compared\n   to lower levels of localization.\n"
- title: 3.2.  P4P Coarse Grain
  contents:
  - "3.2.  P4P Coarse Grain\n   Given the level of detail in the Fine Grain design,\
    \ it was important\n   that we also enable a high-level design, which still used\
    \ priority\n   and weighting mechanisms for the Comcast backbone and transit links.\n\
    \   The Coarse Grain design was a limited or summarized version of the\n   Fine\
    \ Grain design, which used the ASN to IP Aggregate and weighted\n   data for transit\
    \ links, but removed all additional localization data.\n   This ensured we would\
    \ get similar data sets from the Fine Grain\n   design, but without the more detailed\
    \ localization of each of the\n   networks attached to the Comcast backbone. \
    \ This design defined 22\n   P4P iTracker node identifiers, and resulted in a\
    \ 998-line\n   configuration file.\n   From an overall cost, complexity, risk,\
    \ and effectiveness standpoint,\n   this was judged to be the optimal P4P iTracker\
    \ for Comcast.\n   Importantly, this did not require revealing the complex, internal\n\
    \   network topology that the Fine Grain did.  Updates to this iTracker\n   were\
    \ also far simpler to automate, which will better ensure that it\n   is accurate\
    \ over time, and keeps administrative overhead relatively\n   low.  However, the\
    \ differences, costs, and benefits of Coarse Grain\n   and Generic Weighted (see\
    \ below) likely merit further study.\n"
- title: 3.3.  P4P Generic Weighted
  contents:
  - "3.3.  P4P Generic Weighted\n   The Generic Weighted design was a copy of the\
    \ Coarse Grained design,\n   but instead of using ISP-designated priority and\
    \ weights, all weights\n   were defaulted to pre-determined parameters that the\
    \ Yale team had\n   designed.  All other data was replicated from the Coarse Grain\n\
    \   design.  Gathering and providing the information necessary to support\n  \
    \ the Generic Weighted iTracker was roughly the same level of effort as\n   for\
    \ Coarse Grain.\n"
- title: 4.  High-Level Trial Results
  contents:
  - "4.  High-Level Trial Results\n   Trial data was collected by Pando Networks and\
    \ Yale University, and\n   raw trial results were shared with Comcast and all\
    \ of the other ISPs\n   involved in the trial.  Analysis of the raw results was\
    \ performed by\n   Pando and Yale, and these organizations delivered an analysis\
    \ of the\n   P4P iTracker trial.  Using the raw data, Comcast also analyzed the\n\
    \   trial results.  Furthermore, the raw trial results for Comcast were\n   shared\
    \ with Net Forecast, Inc., which performed an independent\n   analysis of the\
    \ trial for Comcast.\n"

    \ at\n   11,703 peers per swarm, or nearly 57,000 peers for all five swarms.\n\

    \ Data\n   An analysis of the effects of P4P iTracker use on upstream\n   utilization\
    \ and Internet transit was also interesting.  It did not\n   appear that P4P iTrackers\
    \ significantly increased upstream\n   utilization in the Comcast access network;\
    \ in essence, uploading was\n   already occurring no matter what and a P4P iTracker\
    \ in and of itself\n   did not appear to materially increase uploading for this\
    \ specific,\n   licensed content.  (A P4P iTracker is not intended as a solution\
    \ for\n   the potential of network congestion to occur.)  Random was 143,236 MB\n\
    \   and P4P Generic Weight was 143,143 MB, while P4P Coarse Grained was\n   139,669\
    \ MB.  We also observed that using a P4P iTracker reduced\n   outgoing Internet\
    \ traffic by an average of 34% at peering points.\n   Random was 134,219 MB and\
    \ P4P Generic Weight was 91,979 MB, while P4P\n   Coarse Grained was 86,652 MB.\n\
    \   In terms of downstream utilization, we observed that the use of a P4P\n  \
    \ iTracker reduced incoming Internet traffic by an average of 80% at\n   peering\
    \ points.  Random was 47,013 MB, P4P Generic Weight was 8,610\n   MB, and P4P\
    \ Coarse Grained was 7,764 MB.  However, we did notice that\n   download activity\
    \ in the Comcast access network increased somewhat,\n   from 56,030 MB for Random,\
    \ to 59,765 MB for P4P Generic Weight, and\n   60,781 MB for P4P Coarse Grained.\
    \  Note that for each swarm, the\n   number of downloaded bytes according to logging\
    \ reports is very close\n   to the number of downloads multiplied by file size.\
    \  But they do not\n   exactly match due to log report errors and duplicated chunks.\
    \  One\n   factor contributing to the differences in access network download\n\
    \   activity is that different swarms have different numbers of\n   downloaders,\
    \ due to random variations during uniform random\n   assignment of downloaders\
    \ to swarms (see Table 1).  One interesting\n   observation is that Random has\
    \ higher cancellation rate (3.17%) than\n   that of the guided swarms (1.77%-2.22%).\
    \  Whether guided swarms\n   achieve lower cancellation rate is an interesting\
    \ issue for future\n   research.\n"
- title: 5.  Important Notes on Data Collected
  contents:
  - "5.  Important Notes on Data Collected\n   Raw data is presented in this document.\
    \  We did not normalize traffic\n   volume data (e.g., upload and download) by\
    \ the number of downloads in\n   order to preserve this underlying raw data.\n\
    \   We also recommend that readers not focus too much on the absolute\n   numbers,\
    \ such as bytes downloaded from internal sources and bytes\n   downloaded from\
    \ external sources.  Instead, we recommend readers\n   focus on ratios such as\
    \ the percentage of bytes downloaded that came\n   from internal sources in each\
    \ swarm.  As a result, the small random\n   variation between number of downloads\
    \ of each swarm does not distract\n   readers from important metrics like shifting\
    \ traffic from external to\n   internal sources, among other things.\n   We also\
    \ wish to note that the data was collected from a sample of the\n   total swarm.\
    \  Specifically, there were some peers running older\n   versions of the Pando\
    \ client that did not implement the extended\n   transfer logging.  For those\
    \ nodes, which participated in the swarms\n   but did not report their data transfers,\
    \ we have download counts.\n   The result of this is that, for example, the download\
    \ counts\n   generated from the standard logging are a bit higher than the\n \
    \  download counts generated by the extended logging.  That being said,\n   over\
    \ 90% of downloads were by peers running the newer software, which\n   we believe\
    \ shows that the transfer records are highly representative\n   of the total data\
    \ flow.\n   In terms of which analysis was performed from the standard logging\n\
    \   compared to extended logging, all of the data flow analysis was\n   performed\
    \ using the extended logging.  Pando's download counts and\n   performance numbers\
    \ were generated via standard logging (i.e., all\n   peers report download complete/cancel,\
    \ data volumes, and measured\n   download speed on the client).  Yale's download\
    \ counts and\n   performance numbers were derived via extended logging (e.g.,\
    \ by\n   summing the transfer records, counting IP addresses reported, etc.).\n\
    \   One benefit of having two data sources is that we can compare the\n   two.\
    \  In this case, the two approaches both reported comparable\n   impacts.\n"

  - "6.  Next Steps\n   One objective of this document is to share with the IETF community\n\
    \   the results of one P4P iTracker trial in a large broadband network,\n   given\
    \ skepticism regarding the benefits to P2P users as well as to\n   ISPs.  From\
    \ the perspective of P2P users, P4P iTrackers potentially\n   deliver faster P2P\
    \ downloads.  At the same time, ISPs can increase\n   the localization of swarms,\
    \ enabling them to reduce bytes flowing\n   over transit points, while also delivering\
    \ an optimized P2P\n   experience to customers.  However, an internal analysis\
    \ of varying\n   levels of P4P iTracker adoption by ISPs leads us to believe that,\n\
    \   while P4P iTracker-type mechanisms are valuable on a single ISP\n   basis,\
    \ the value of P4P iTrackers increases dramatically as many ISPs\n   choose to\
    \ deploy it.\n   We believe these results can inform the technical discussion\
    \ in the\n   IETF over how to use P4P iTracker mechanisms.  Should such a\n  \
    \ mechanism be standardized, the use of ISP-provided P4P iTrackers\n   should\
    \ probably be an opt-in feature for P2P users, or at least a\n   feature of which\
    \ they are explicitly aware of and which has been\n   enabled by default in a\
    \ particular P2P client.  In this way, P2P\n   users could choose to opt-in either\
    \ explicitly or by their choice of\n   P2P client in order to choose to use the\
    \ P4P iTracker to improve\n   performance, which benefits both the user and the\
    \ ISP at the same\n   time.  Importantly in terms of privacy, the P4P iTracker\
    \ makes\n   available only network topology information, and would not in its\n\
    \   current form enable an ISP, via the P4P iTracker, to determine which\n   P2P\
    \ clients were downloading any specific content, whether to\n   determine, for\
    \ example, if content was a song or a movie or even the\n   title.\n   It is also\
    \ possible that a P4P iTracker type of mechanism, in\n   combination with a P2P\
    \ cache, could further improve P2P download\n   performance, which merits further\
    \ study.  In addition, this was a\n   limited trial that, while very promising,\
    \ indicates a need for\n   additional technical investigation and trial work.\
    \  Such a follow-up\n   study should explore the effects of P4P iTrackers when\
    \ more P2P\n   client software variants are involved, with larger swarms, and\
    \ with\n   additional and more technically diverse content (file size, file\n\
    \   type, duration of content, etc.).\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not propose any kind of protocol,\
    \ practice or\n   standard.\n   The experiment did show that an ISP can improve\
    \ performance without\n   exposing fine-grained details about network structure,\
    \ which might\n   otherwise be a security concern (see Section 3.1 (P4P Fine Grain)\
    \ and\n   Section 3.2 (P4P Coarse Grain).  Section 6 (Next Steps) mentions that\n\
    \   the opt-in architecture allows P2P users to maintain privacy.\n   Other security\
    \ aspects were not considered in the experiment, which\n   focused on performance\
    \ measurements.\n"
