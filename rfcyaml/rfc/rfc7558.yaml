  - "1.  Introduction\n   DNS-based Service Discovery [DNS-SD] in combination with\
    \ its\n   companion technology Multicast DNS [mDNS] is widely used today for\n\
    \   discovery and resolution of services and names on a local link.  As\n   users\
    \ move to multi-link home or campus networks, however, they find\n   that mDNS\
    \ (by design) does not work across routers.  DNS-SD can also\n   be used in conjunction\
    \ with conventional unicast DNS to enable\n   wide-area service discovery, but\
    \ this capability is not yet widely\n   deployed.  This disconnect between customer\
    \ needs and current\n   practice has led to calls for improvement, such as the\
    \ Educause\n   petition [EP].\n   In response to this and similar evidence of\
    \ market demand, several\n   products now enable service discovery beyond the\
    \ local link using\n   different ad hoc techniques.  As of yet, no consensus has\
    \ emerged\n   regarding which approach represents the best long-term direction\
    \ for\n   DNS-based Service Discovery protocol development.\n   Multicast DNS\
    \ in its present form is also not optimized for network\n   technologies where\
    \ multicast transmissions are relatively expensive.\n   Wireless networks such\
    \ as Wi-Fi [IEEE.802.11] may be adversely\n   affected by excessive mDNS traffic\
    \ due to the higher network overhead\n   of multicast transmissions.  Wireless\
    \ mesh networks such as IPv6 over\n   Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network\
    \ (6LoWPAN) [RFC4944] are\n   effectively multi-link subnets [RFC4903] where multicasts\
    \ must be\n   forwarded by intermediate nodes.\n   It is in the best interests\
    \ of end users, network administrators, and\n   vendors for all interested parties\
    \ to cooperate within the context of\n   the IETF to develop an efficient, scalable,\
    \ and interoperable\n   standards-based solution.\n   This document defines the\
    \ problem statement and gathers requirements\n   for scalable DNS-SD/mDNS extensions.\n"

    \ for a given application\n   protocol.  Services are identified by Service Instance\

    \ the most important\n   feature currently missing from the DNS-SD-over-mDNS framework\
    \ (also\n   written as \"DNS-SD over mDNS\" or \"DNS-SD/mDNS\").  Other issues\
    \ and\n   requirements are summarized below.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Multi-link Naming and Discovery
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Multi-link Naming and Discovery\n   A list of desired DNS-SD/mDNS improvements\
    \ from network\n   administrators in the research and education community was\
    \ issued in\n   the form of the Educause petition [EP].  The following is a summary\n\
    \   of their technical issues:\n   o  It is common practice for enterprises and\
    \ institutions to use\n      wireless links for client access and wired links\
    \ for server\n      infrastructure; typically, they are on different subnets.\n\
    \      Products that advertise services such as printing and multimedia\n    \
    \  streaming via DNS-SD over mDNS are not currently discoverable by\n      client\
    \ devices on other links.  DNS-SD used with conventional\n      unicast DNS does\
    \ work when servers and clients are on different\n      links, but the resource\
    \ records that describe the services must\n      somehow be entered into the unicast\
    \ DNS namespace.\n   o  DNS-SD resource records may be entered manually into a\
    \ unicast DNS\n      zone file [STATIC], but this task must be performed by a\
    \ DNS\n      administrator.  It is labor intensive and brittle when IP\n     \
    \ addresses of devices change dynamically, as is common when DHCP is\n      used.\n\
    \   o  Automatically adding DNS-SD records using DNS Update works, but it\n  \
    \    requires that the DNS server be configured to allow DNS Updates\n      and\
    \ that devices be configured with the DNS Update credentials to\n      permit\
    \ such updates, which has proven to be onerous.\n   Therefore, a mechanism is\
    \ desired that populates the DNS namespace\n   with the appropriate DNS-SD records\
    \ with less manual administration\n   than is typically needed for a conventional\
    \ unicast DNS server.\n   The following is a summary of technical requirements:\n\
    \   o  It must scale to a range of hundreds to thousands of DNS-SD/mDNS-\n   \
    \   enabled devices in a given environment.\n   o  It must simultaneously operate\
    \ over a variety of network link\n      technologies, such as wired and wireless\
    \ networks.\n   o  It must not significantly increase network traffic (wired or\n\
    \      wireless).\n   o  It must be cost-effective to manage at up to enterprise\
    \ scale.\n"
- title: 2.2.  IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs
  contents:
  - "2.2.  IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs\n   Multicast DNS was originally designed to\
    \ run on Ethernet - the\n   dominant link layer at the time.  In shared-medium\
    \ Ethernet networks,\n   multicast frames place little additional demand on the\
    \ shared network\n   medium compared to unicast frames.  In IEEE 802.11 networks,\
    \ however,\n   multicast frames are transmitted at a low data rate supported by\
    \ all\n   receivers.  In practice, this data rate leads to a larger fraction of\n\
    \   airtime being devoted to multicast transmission.  Some network\n   administrators\
    \ block multicast traffic or use access points that\n   transmit multicast frames\
    \ using a series of link-layer unicast\n   frames.\n   Wireless links may be orders\
    \ of magnitude less reliable than their\n   wired counterparts.  To improve transmission\
    \ reliability, the IEEE\n   802.11 Medium Access Control (MAC) requires positive\
    \ acknowledgement\n   of unicast frames.  It does not, however, support positive\n\
    \   acknowledgement of multicast frames.  As a result, it is common to\n   observe\
    \ higher loss rates of multicast frames on wireless network\n   technologies than\
    \ on wired network technologies.\n   Enabling service discovery on IEEE 802.11\
    \ networks requires that the\n   number of multicast frames be restricted to a\
    \ suitably low value or\n   replaced with unicast frames to use the MAC's reliability\
    \ features.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs)
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs)\n   Emerging wireless mesh networking\
    \ technologies such as the Routing\n   Protocol for LLNs (RPL) [RFC6550] and 6LoWPAN\
    \ present several\n   challenges for the current DNS-SD/mDNS design.  First, link-local\n\
    \   multicast scope [RFC4291] is defined as a single-hop neighborhood.  A\n  \
    \ wireless mesh network representing a single logical subnet may often\n   extend\
    \ to multiple hops [RFC4903]; therefore, a larger multicast\n   scope is required\
    \ to span it [RFC7346].  Multicast DNS was\n   intentionally not specified for\
    \ greater than link-local scope because\n   of the additional off-link multicast\
    \ traffic that it would generate.\n   Additionally, low-power nodes may be offline\
    \ for significant periods\n   either because they are \"sleeping\" or due to connectivity\
    \ problems.\n   In such cases, LLN nodes might fail to respond to queries or defend\n\
    \   their names using the current design.\n"
- title: 3.  Basic Use Cases
  contents:
  - "3.  Basic Use Cases\n   The following use cases are defined with different characteristics\
    \ to\n   help motivate, distinguish, and classify the target requirements.\n \
    \  They cover a spectrum of increasing deployment and administrative\n   complexity.\n\
    \      (A) Personal Area Networks (PANs): The simplest example of a\n      network\
    \ may consist of a single client and server, e.g., one\n      laptop and one printer,\
    \ on a common link.  PANs that do not\n      contain a router may use Zero Configuration\
    \ Networking [ZC] to\n      self-assign link-local addresses [RFC3927] [RFC4862]\
    \ and Multicast\n      DNS [mDNS] to provide naming and service discovery, as\
    \ is\n      currently implemented and deployed in Mac OS X, iOS, Windows\n   \
    \   [B4W], and Android [NSD].\n      (B) Classic home or 'hotspot' networks, with\
    \ the following\n      properties:\n      *  Single exit router: The network may\
    \ have one or more upstream\n         providers or networks, but all outgoing\
    \ and incoming traffic\n         goes through a single router.\n      *  One-level\
    \ depth: A single physical link, or multiple physical\n         links bridged\
    \ to form a single logical link, that is connected\n         to the default router.\
    \  The single logical link provides a\n         single broadcast domain, facilitating\
    \ use of link-local\n         Multicast DNS, and also ARP, which enables the home\
    \ or\n         'hotspot' network to consist of just a single IPv4 subnet.\n  \
    \    *  Single administrative domain: All nodes under the same\n         administrative\
    \ authority.  Note that this does not necessarily\n         imply a network administrator.\n\
    \      (C) Advanced home and small business networks [RFC7368]:\n      Like B,\
    \ but consists of multiple wired and/or wireless links,\n      connected by routers,\
    \ generally behind a single exit router.\n      However, the forwarding nodes\
    \ are largely self-configuring and do\n      not require routing protocol administration.\
    \  Such networks should\n      also not require DNS administration.\n      (D)\
    \ Enterprise networks:\n      Consists of arbitrary network diameter under a single\n\
    \      administrative authority.  A large majority of the forwarding and\n   \
    \   security devices are configured, and multiple exit routers are\n      more\
    \ common.  Large-scale conference-style networks, which are\n      predominantly\
    \ wireless access, e.g., as available at IETF\n      meetings, also fall within\
    \ this category.\n      (E) Higher-Education networks:\n      Like D, but the\
    \ core network may be under a central administrative\n      authority while leaf\
    \ networks are under local administrative\n      authorities.\n      (F) Mesh\
    \ networks such as RPL/6LoWPAN:\n      Multi-link subnets with prefixes defined\
    \ by one or more border\n      routers.  May comprise any part of networks C,\
    \ D, or E.\n"
- title: 4.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Requirements\n   Any successful SSD solution(s) will have to strike the proper\
    \ balance\n   between competing goals such as scalability, deployability, and\n\
    \   usability.  With that in mind, none of the requirements listed below\n   should\
    \ be considered in isolation.\n   REQ1:   For use cases A, B, and C, there should\
    \ be a Zero\n           Configuration mode of operation.  This implies that servers\n\
    \           and clients should be able to automatically determine a\n        \
    \   default scope of discovery in which to advertise and discover\n          \
    \ services, respectively.\n   REQ2:   For use cases C, D, and E, there should\
    \ be a way to configure\n           scopes of discovery that support a range of\
    \ topologically\n           independent zones (e.g., from department to campus\
    \ wide).\n           This capability must exist in the protocol; individual\n\
    \           operators are not required to use this capability in all\n       \
    \    cases -- in particular, use case C should support Zero\n           Configuration\
    \ operation where that is desired.  If multiple\n           scopes are available,\
    \ there must be a way to enumerate the\n           choices from which a selection\
    \ can be made.  In use case C,\n           either Zero Configuration (one flat\
    \ list of resources) or\n           configured (e.g., resources sorted by room)\
    \ modes of\n           operation should be available.\n   REQ3:   As stated in\
    \ REQ2 above, the discovery scope need not be\n           aligned to network topology.\
    \  For example, it may instead be\n           aligned to physical proximity (e.g.,\
    \ building) or\n           organizational structure (e.g., \"Sales\" vs. \"Engineering\"\
    ).\n   REQ4:   For use cases C, D, and E, there should be an incremental way\n\
    \           to deploy the solution.\n   REQ5:   SSD should leverage and build\
    \ upon current link scope DNS-SD/\n           mDNS protocols and deployments.\n\
    \   REQ6:   SSD must not adversely affect or break any other current\n       \
    \    protocols or deployments.\n   REQ7:   SSD must be capable of operating across\
    \ networks that are not\n           limited to a single link or network technology,\
    \ including\n           clients and services on non-adjacent links.\n   REQ8:\
    \   It is desirable that a user or device be able to discover\n           services\
    \ within the sites or networks to which the user or\n           device is connected.\n\
    \   REQ9:   SSD should operate efficiently on common link layers and link\n  \
    \         types.\n   REQ10:  SSD should be considerate of networks where power\
    \ consumption\n           is a critical factor; for example, nodes may be in a\
    \ low-\n           power or sleeping state.\n   REQ11:  SSD must be scalable to\
    \ thousands of nodes with minimal\n           configuration and without degrading\
    \ network performance.  A\n           possible figure of merit is that, as the\
    \ number of services\n           increases, the amount of traffic due to SSD on\
    \ a given link\n           remains relatively constant.\n   REQ12:  SSD should\
    \ enable a way to provide a consistent user\n           experience whether local\
    \ or remote services are being\n           discovered.\n   REQ13:  The information\
    \ presented by SSD should closely reflect the\n           current state of discoverable\
    \ services on the network.  That\n           is, new information should be available\
    \ within a few seconds\n           and stale information should not persist indefinitely.\
    \  In\n           networking, all information is necessarily somewhat out of\n\
    \           date by the time it reaches the receiver, even if only by a\n    \
    \       few microseconds or less.  Thus, timeliness is always an\n           engineering\
    \ trade-off against efficiency.  The engineering\n           decisions for SSD\
    \ should appropriately balance timeliness\n           against network efficiency.\n\
    \   REQ14:  SSD should operate over existing networks (as described by\n     \
    \      use cases A through F above) without requiring changes to the\n       \
    \    network at the physical, link, or internetworking layers.\n   REQ15:  The\
    \ administrator of an advertised service should be able to\n           control\
    \ whether the service is advertised beyond the local\n           link.\n"
- title: 5.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Namespace Considerations\n   The traditional unicast DNS namespace contains,\
    \ for the most part,\n   globally unique names.  Multicast DNS provides every\
    \ link with its\n   own separate link-local namespace, where names are unique\
    \ only within\n   the context of that link.  Clients discovering services may\
    \ need to\n   differentiate between local and global names and may need to\n \
    \  determine when names in different namespaces identify the same\n   service.\n\
    \   Devices on different links may have the same mDNS name (perhaps due\n   to\
    \ vendor defaults) because link-local mDNS names are only guaranteed\n   to be\
    \ unique on a per-link basis.  This may lead to a local label\n   disambiguation\
    \ problem when results are aggregated (e.g., for\n   presentation).\n   SSD should\
    \ support rich internationalized labels within Service\n   Instance Names, as\
    \ DNS-SD/mDNS does today.  SSD must not negatively\n   impact the global DNS namespace\
    \ or infrastructure.\n   The problem of publishing local services in the global\
    \ DNS namespace\n   may be generally viewed as exporting local resource records\
    \ and their\n   associated labels into some DNS zone.  The issues related to defining\n\
    \   labels that are interoperable between local and global namespaces are\n  \
    \ discussed in a separate document [INTEROP-LABELS].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Insofar as SSD may automatically gather DNS-SD\
    \ resource records and\n   publish them over a wide area, the security issues\
    \ are likely to\n   include the union of those discussed in the Multicast DNS\
    \ [mDNS] and\n   DNS-based Service Discovery [DNS-SD] specifications.  The following\n\
    \   sections highlight potential threats that are posed by deploying DNS-\n  \
    \ SD over multiple links or by automating DNS-SD administration.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Scope of Discovery
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Scope of Discovery\n   In some scenarios, the owner of the advertised service\
    \ may not have a\n   clear indication of the scope of its advertisement.\n   For\
    \ example, since mDNS is currently restricted to a single link, the\n   scope\
    \ of the advertisement is limited, by design, to the shared link\n   between client\
    \ and server.  If the advertisement propagates to a\n   larger set of links than\
    \ expected, this may result in unauthorized\n   clients (from the perspective\
    \ of the owner) discovering and then\n   potentially attempting to connect to\
    \ the advertised service.  It also\n   discloses information (about the host and\
    \ service) to a larger set of\n   potential attackers.\n   Note that discovery\
    \ of a service does not necessarily imply that the\n   service is reachable by,\
    \ or can be connected to, or can be used by, a\n   given client.  Specific access-control\
    \ mechanisms are out of scope of\n   this document.\n   If the scope of the discovery\
    \ is not properly set up or constrained,\n   then information leaks will happen\
    \ outside the appropriate network.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Multiple Namespaces
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Multiple Namespaces\n   There is a possibility of conflicts between the\
    \ local and global DNS\n   namespaces.  Without adequate feedback, a discovering\
    \ client may not\n   know if the advertised service is the correct one, therefore\
    \ enabling\n   potential attacks.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Authorization
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Authorization\n   DNSSEC can assert the validity but not the accuracy of\
    \ records in a\n   zone file.  The trust model of the global DNS relies on the\
    \ fact that\n   human administrators either (a) manually enter resource records\
    \ into\n   a zone file or (b) configure the DNS server to authenticate a trusted\n\
    \   device (e.g., a DHCP server) that can automatically maintain such\n   records.\n\
    \   An impostor may register on the local link and appear as a legitimate\n  \
    \ service.  Such \"rogue\" services may then be automatically registered\n   in\
    \ unicast DNS-SD.\n"

    \ then it\n   is assumed to be trusted.  This is not likely to be the case in\n\
    \   foreign networks.\n   If there is a risk that clients may be fooled by the\
    \ deployment of\n   rogue services, then application-layer authentication should\
    \ be\n   considered as part of any security solution.  Authentication of any\n\
    \   particular service is outside the scope of this document.\n"

  - "6.5.  Access Control\n   Access Control refers to the ability to restrict which\
    \ users are able\n   to use a particular service that might be advertised via\
    \ DNS-SD.  In\n   this case, \"use\" of a service is different from the ability\
    \ to\n   \"discover\" or \"reach\" a service.\n   While controlling access to\
    \ an advertised service is outside the\n   scope of DNS-SD, we note that access\
    \ control today often is provided\n   by existing site infrastructure (e.g., router\
    \ access-control lists,\n   firewalls) and/or by service-specific mechanisms (e.g.,\
    \ user\n   authentication to the service).  For example, networked printers can\n\
    \   control access via a user ID and password.  Apple's software supports\n  \
    \ such access control for USB printers shared via Mac OS X Printer\n   Sharing,\
    \ as do many networked printers themselves.  So the reliance\n   on existing service-specific\
    \ security mechanisms (i.e., outside the\n   scope of DNS-SD) does not create\
    \ new security considerations.\n"

  - "6.6.  Privacy Considerations\n   Mobile devices such as smart phones or laptops\
    \ that can expose the\n   location of their owners by registering services in\
    \ arbitrary zones\n   pose a risk to privacy.  Such devices must not register\
    \ their\n   services in arbitrary zones without the approval (\"opt-in\") of their\n\
    \   users.  However, it should be possible to configure one or more\n   \"safe\"\
    \ zones in which mobile devices may automatically register their\n   services.\n"
