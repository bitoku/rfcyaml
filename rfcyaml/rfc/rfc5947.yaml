  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], together\
    \ with its\n   extensions, supports multiple means of obtaining the connection\n\
    \   information necessary to deliver out-of-dialog SIP requests to their\n   intended\
    \ targets.  When a SIP proxy needs to send a request to a\n   target address of\
    \ record (AOR) within its domain, it can use a\n   location service to obtain\
    \ the registered Contact Universal Resource\n   Identifiers (URIs), together with\
    \ any associated path information\n   [RFC3327], and build a route set to reach\
    \ each target user agent\n   (UA).  The SIP REGISTER method can be used to register\
    \ Contact URIs\n   and path information.  SIP-outbound [RFC5626] enhances this\
    \ mechanism\n   to cater to UAs behind Network Address Translators (NATs) and\n\
    \   firewalls.  When an entity needs to send a request to a target for\n   which\
    \ it is not authoritative, the entity can follow [RFC3263]\n   procedures for\
    \ using the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain the next-\n   hop connection information.\n\
    \   In practice, many small- and medium-sized businesses use a SIP\n   Private\
    \ Branch Exchange (SIP-PBX) that is authoritative for tens or\n   hundreds of\
    \ SIP AORs.  This SIP-PBX acts as a registrar/proxy for\n   these AORs for users\
    \ hosted by the SIP-PBX.  A SIP Service Provider\n   (SSP) provides SIP peering/trunking\
    \ capability to the SIP-PBX.  The\n   SIP-PBX needs to be reachable from the SSP\
    \ so that the SSP can handle\n   inbound out-of-dialog SIP requests targeted at\
    \ these AORs, routing\n   these requests to the SIP-PBX for onward delivery to\
    \ registered UAs.\n   Experience has shown that existing mechanisms are not always\n\
    \   sufficient to support SIP-PBXs for small/medium businesses.  In\n   particular,\
    \ RFC 3263 procedures are generally inappropriate, except\n   for some larger\
    \ SIP-PBXs.  In current deployments, mechanisms for the\n   dynamic provision\
    \ of reachability information based on the SIP\n   REGISTER method are commonly\
    \ used.  However, these mechanisms vary in\n   detail, leading to interoperability\
    \ issues between SIP-PBXs and SSPs,\n   and the need for equipment to support\
    \ different variants.  A more\n   detailed statement of the problem is given in\
    \ Section 3.\n   This document states requirements for a standardized SIP registration\n\
    \   mechanism for multiple AORs, the mechanism being suitable for\n   deployment\
    \ by SSPs on a large scale in support of small- to medium-\n   sized SIP-PBXs.\
    \  The requirements are for a solution that can, as a\n   minimum, support AORs\
    \ based on E.164 numbers.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   A number of other standards organizations have addressed\
    \ the issue of\n   a SIP-PBX registering with its SSP, notably ETSI [ETSI_TS_182025]\
    \ and\n   3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [3GPP.24.229].  Also,\n  \
    \ various SSPs have produced proprietary specifications for use with\n   their\
    \ own offerings.  The reader is encouraged to review the\n   documents produced\
    \ by those organizations.\n   A short summary of the general concept is as follows.\

    \ - - - - - - -\n   In virtually all models, the SIP-PBX generates a SIP REGISTER\
    \ request\n   using a mutually agreed-upon SIP AOR -- typically based on the SIP-\n\
    \   PBX's main attendant-/reception-desk number.  The AOR is often in the\n  \
    \ domain of the SSP, and both the To and From URIs used for the\n   REGISTER request\
    \ identify that AOR.  In all respects, it appears on\n   the wire as a \"normal\"\
    \ SIP REGISTER request, as if from a typical\n   user's UA.  However, it generally\
    \ implicitly registers other AORs\n   associated with the SIP-PBX.\n   For both\
    \ 3GPP and ETSI mechanisms, the 200 OK response to the\n   REGISTER request, sent\
    \ after a successful authentication challenge,\n   contains a P-Associated-URI\
    \ (PAU) [RFC3455] header field listing the\n   other SIP URIs or TEL URIs (i.e.,\
    \ phone numbers) of the SIP-PBX,\n   which are implicitly registered AORs.  The\
    \ registered reachability\n   information from the REGISTER request will be used\
    \ to reach not only\n   the single explicitly registered AOR but also each of\
    \ the implicitly\n   registered AORs.  In order to reduce the number of PAU entries,\
    \ a\n   \"wildcard\" syntax model is defined [3GPP.23.003], which uses a\n   regular\
    \ expression syntax in the user field of the URI to express\n   multiple AORs\
    \ in a compressed manner.\n   For routing requests for any of the explicitly or\
    \ implicitly\n   registered AORs from the SSP to the SIP-PBX, the Request-URI\
    \ is\n   typically replaced with the registered Contact URI.  In the case of\n\
    \   3GPP and ETSI, the SSP has the option of using loose routing instead,\n  \
    \ and inserting the registered Contact URI as a loose route Route\n   header field\
    \ value, while leaving the Request-URI alone.  This\n   decision is made based\
    \ upon manually provisioned information in the\n   registrar's database (i.e.,\
    \ the Home Subscriber Server (HSS)).\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Mishandling by SIP-Aware Middleboxes\n   None of the currently available\
    \ mechanisms indicate that the REGISTER\n   request or response is any different\
    \ from a \"normal\" REGISTER request\n   or response.  This has caused issues\
    \ when SIP-aware middleboxes\n   between the SIP-PBX and the registrar serve both\
    \ SIP-PBXs and normal\n   UAs yet need to apply different policies to the two\
    \ cases.\n   Furthermore, some middleboxes expect the registrar to follow normal\n\
    \   [RFC3261] procedures of Request-URI replacement with the registered\n   Contact\
    \ URI for routing subsequent requests to the SIP-PBX.  If the\n   registrar adopts\
    \ a different practice for requests to SIP-PBXs, this\n   can cause the middlebox\
    \ to fail to route such requests correctly,\n   because there is no indication\
    \ that the registration was any\n   different.\n   Lastly, lack of an indication\
    \ of implicit registration makes\n   troubleshooting more difficult because the\
    \ on-the-wire messages are\n   indistinguishable from \"normal\" registrations.\
    \  Note that even the\n   existence of a PAU header field in the response does\
    \ not indicate\n   that implicit registration for a SIP-PBX has occurred, since\

    \ for registration resolution\n   of requests targeted at one of the SIP-PBX's\
    \ AORs, and thus replaces\n   the Request-URI with the registered Contact URI,\
    \ it is not clear\n   which AOR is the intended target of the request.  The To\
    \ URI, for\n   example, may not contain the intended target AOR if the request\
    \ was\n   forwarded/retargeted prior to reaching the proxy-registrar.  Some\n\

  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Authorization Policy Mismatches\n   Many SSPs perform a first-order level\
    \ of authorization for requests\n   from the SIP-PBX by checking the URI in the\
    \ From, P-Asserted-\n   Identity (PAI), or P-Preferred-Identity (PPI) [RFC3325]\
    \ header field\n   for one matching either an explicitly or implicitly registered\
    \ AOR\n   for the same Contact URI and/or Layer-3 IP Address.  However, some\n\
    \   SIP-PBXs change the Contact URI they use for non-REGISTER requests to\n  \
    \ be different from the one they explicitly registered.  For example,\n   they\
    \ change the user portion of the Contact URI, or even the host\n   portion.  This\
    \ is particularly true for a SIP-PBX operating as a\n   proxy and forwarding the\
    \ Contact URI from the UA behind the SIP-PBX\n   (the SIP-PBX typically being\
    \ identified in a Record-Route header\n   field), rather than acting as a Back-to-Back\
    \ User Agent (B2BUA) and\n   substituting its own Contact URI.  This can cause\
    \ an SSP to fail to\n   find an AOR corresponding to the Contact URI for non-REGISTER\n\

- title: 3.3.2.  PAI or PPI URI Mismatches
  contents:

    \ registered\n   AOR only, as it is the main billing number, instead of the implicitly\n\

    \ in the SSP rejecting requests with values that do not match, or\n   asserting\
    \ its own PAI value.\n   Again, these are policy matters for the SSP, but drawbacks\
    \ should be\n   noted.  For example, rejection of requests can rule out requests\
    \ from\n   sources beyond the SIP-PBX (e.g., calls forwarded by the SIP-PBX),\n\
    \   unless the SIP-PBX changes the PAI or PPI URI to a value acceptable\n   to\

  - "5.  Desirables\n   The following are desirable properties of the mechanism.\n\
    \   In addition to the desirables below, the general aim is to require\n   only\
    \ relatively modest changes to a substantial population of\n   existing SSP and\
    \ SIP-PBX implementations, in order to encourage a\n   fast market adoption of\
    \ the standardized mechanism.  Ease of market\n   adoption is paramount here.\
    \  Many SIP-PBXs and SSPs have implemented\n   mechanisms based on the REGISTER\
    \ method, and the need for substantial\n   changes to those implementations will\
    \ discourage convergence on a\n   single standard in the foreseeable future.\n\
    \   DES1:  The mechanism SHOULD allow an SSP to exploit its mechanisms\n     \
    \     for providing SIP service to normal UAs in order to provide a\n        \
    \  SIP trunking service to SIP-PBXs.\n   DES2:  The mechanism SHOULD scale to\
    \ SIP-PBXs of several thousand\n          assigned telephone numbers.\n      \
    \       This will probably preclude any mechanism involving a\n             separate\
    \ REGISTER transaction per assigned telephone\n             number.\n        \
    \     In practice, the mechanism is more likely to be used on\n             SIP-PBXs\
    \ with up to a few hundred telephone numbers, but it\n             is impossible\
    \ to give a precise limit, and hence the desire\n             to be able to support\
    \ several thousand.\n   DES3:  The mechanism SHOULD scale to support several thousand\
    \ SIP-\n          PBXs on a single SSP.\n"

  - "6.  Non-Requirements\n   The means by which a third domain can route a request\
    \ to the SSP for\n   onward delivery to the SIP-PBX is outside the scope of this\
    \ work.\n   This is related to REQ13, which requires normal routing based on RFC\n\
    \   3263 be used.\n   Provisioning is outside the scope of this work.  In particular,\
    \ an\n   SSP will need to assign a set of telephone numbers to a SIP-PBX, and\n\
    \   a SIP-PBX will need to be aware of the set of assigned numbers and\n   allocate\
    \ those numbers to its users.  Automated means for a SIP-PBX\n   to obtain, from\
    \ its SSP, the set of assigned telephone numbers is\n   considered to be a provisioning\
    \ topic.\n"
- title: 7.  Security considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security considerations\n   The security of signaling between the SIP-PBX\
    \ and the SSP is\n   important.  Some of the requirements above already address\
    \ this.\n   In particular, it is important that an entity acting as a SIP-PBX\n\
    \   cannot register with an SSP and receive inbound requests to which it\n   is\
    \ not entitled.  The SSP is assumed to have procedures for ensuring\n   that a\
    \ SIP-PBX is entitled to use a set of E.164 telephone numbers\n   prior to entering\
    \ into agreement with that SIP-PBX for using those\n   telephone numbers with\
    \ this mechanism.  Furthermore, by\n   authenticating the SIP-PBX when it provides\
    \ reachability information,\n   the SSP can be sure that it delivers inbound requests\
    \ only to the\n   correct destination.\n"
