  - "                             Sockets in use\n   I would like to collect information\
    \ on the use of socket numbers\nfor \"standard\" service programs. For example\
    \ Loggers (telnet servers)\nListen on socket 1. What sockets at your host are\
    \ Listened to by what\nprograms?\n   Recently Dick Watson suggested assigning\
    \ socket 5 for use by a\nmail-box protocol (RFC196). Does any one object ? Are\
    \ there any\nsuggestions for a method of assigning sockets to standard programs?\n\
    Should a subset of the socket numbers be reserved for use by future\nstandard\
    \ protocols?\n   Please phone or mail your answers and commtents to:\n       \
