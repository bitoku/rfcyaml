  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is an output of the design team formed to\
    \ develop\n   requirements for PPVPNs in the Provider Provisioned Virtual Private\n\
    \   Networks (PPVPN) working group and provides requirements that are\n   generic\
    \ to both Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN) and Layer 3\n   Virtual Private\
    \ Networks (L3VPN).  This document discusses generic\n   PPVPN requirements categorized\
    \ as service, provider and engineering\n   requirements.  These are independent\
    \ of any particular type of PPVPN\n   technology.  In other words, all PPVPN technologies\
    \ are expected to\n   meet the umbrella set of requirements described in this\
    \ document.\n   PPVPNs may be constructed across single or multiple provider networks\n\
    \   and/or Autonomous Systems (ASes).  In most cases the generic\n   requirements\
    \ described in this document are independent of the\n   deployment scenario. \
    \ However, specific requirements that differ\n   based on whether the PPVPN is\
    \ deployed across single or multiple\n   providers (and/or ASes) will be pointed\
    \ out in the document.\n   Specific requirements related to Layer 3 PPVPNs are\
    \ described in\n   [L3REQTS].  Similarly, requirements that are specific to layer\
    \ 2\n   PPVPNs are described in [L2REQTS].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST\

- title: 1.1.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Problem Statement\n   Corporations and other organizations have become\
    \ increasingly\n   dependent on their networks for telecommunications and data\n\
    \   communication.  The data communication networks were originally built\n  \
    \ as Local Area Networks (LAN).  Over time the possibility to\n   interconnect\
    \ the networks on different sites has become more and more\n   important.  The\
    \ connectivity for corporate networks has been supplied\n   by service providers,\
    \ mainly as Frame Relay (FR) or Asynchronous\n   Transfer Mode (ATM) connections,\
    \ and more recently as Ethernet and\n   IP-based tunnels.  This type of network,\
    \ interconnecting a number of\n   sites over a shared network infrastructure is\
    \ called Virtual Private\n   Network (VPN).  If the sites belong to the same organization,\
    \ the VPN\n   is called an Intranet.  If the sites belong to different\n   organizations\
    \ that share a common interest, the VPN is called an\n   Extranet.\n   Customers\
    \ are looking for service providers to deliver data and\n   telecom connectivity\
    \ over one or more shared networks, with service\n   level assurances in the form\
    \ of security, QoS and other parameters.\n   In order to provide isolation between\
    \ the traffic belonging to\n   different customers, mechanisms such as Layer 2\
    \ connections or Layer\n   2/3 tunnels are necessary.  When the shared infrastructure\
    \ is an IP\n   network, the tunneling technologies that are typically used are\n\
    \   IPsec, MPLS, L2TP, GRE, IP-in-IP etc.\n   Traditional Internet VPNs have been\
    \ based on IPsec to provide\n   security over the Internet.  Service providers\
    \ are now beginning to\n   deploy enhanced VPN services that provide features\
    \ such as service\n   differentiation, traffic management, Layer 2 and Layer 3\n\
    \   connectivity, etc. in addition to security.  Newer tunneling\n   mechanisms\
    \ have certain features that allow the service providers to\n   provide these\
    \ enhanced VPN services.\n   The VPN solutions we define now MUST be able to accommodate\
    \ the\n   traditional types of VPNs as well as the enhanced services now being\n\
    \   deployed.  They need to be able to run in a single service provider's\n  \
    \ network, as well as between a set of service providers and across the\n   Internet.\
    \  In doing so the VPNs SHOULD NOT be allowed to violate\n   basic Internet design\
    \ principles or overload the Internet core\n   routers or accelerate the growths\
    \ of the Internet routing tables.\n   Specifically, Internet core routers SHALL\
    \ NOT be required to maintain\n   VPN-related information, regardless of whether\
    \ the Internet routing\n   protocols are used to distribute this information or\
    \ not.  In order\n   to achieve this, the mechanisms used to develop various PPVPN\n\
    \   solutions SHALL be as common as possible with generic Internet\n   infrastructure\
    \ mechanisms like discovery, signaling, routing and\n   management.  At the same\
    \ time, existing Internet infrastructure\n   mechanisms SHALL NOT be overloaded.\n\
    \   Another generic requirement from a standardization perspective is to\n   limit\
    \ the number of different solution approaches.  For example, for\n   service providers\
    \ that need to support multiple types of VPN\n   services, it may be undesirable\
    \ to require a completely different\n   solution approach for each type of VPN\
    \ service.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Deployment Scenarios
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Deployment Scenarios\n   There are three different deployment scenarios\
    \ that need to be\n   considered for PPVPN services:\n   1. Single-provider, single-AS:\
    \  This is the least complex scenario,\n      where the PPVPN service is offered\
    \ across a single service\n      provider network spanning a single Autonomous\
    \ System.\n   2. Single-provider, multi-AS: In this scenario, a single provider\
    \ may\n      have multiple Autonomous Systems (for e.g., a global Tier-1 ISP\n\
    \      with different ASes depending on the global location, or an ISP\n     \
    \ that has been created by mergers and acquisitions of multiple\n      networks).\
    \  This scenario involves the constrained distribution of\n      routing information\
    \ across multiple Autonomous Systems.\n   3. Multi-provider: This scenario is\
    \ the most complex, wherein trust\n      negotiations need to be made across multiple\
    \ service provider\n      backbones in order to meet the security and service\
    \ level\n      agreements for the PPVPN customer.  This scenario can be\n    \
    \  generalized to cover the Internet, which comprises of multiple\n      service\
    \ provider networks.  It should be noted that customers can\n      construct their\
    \ own VPNs across multiple providers.  However such\n      VPNs are not considered\
    \ here as they would not be \"Provider-\n      provisioned\".\n   A fourth scenario,\
    \ \"Carrier's carrier\" VPN may also be considered.\n   In this scenario, a service\
    \ provider (for example, a Tier 1 service\n   provider) provides VPN service to\
    \ another service provider (for\n   example, a Tier 2 service provider), which\
    \ in turn provides VPN\n   service on its VPN to its customers.  In the example\
    \ given above, the\n   Tier 2 provider's customers are contained within the Tier\
    \ 2\n   provider's network, and the Tier 2 provider itself is a customer of\n\
    \   the Tier 1 provider's network.  Thus, this scenario is not treated\n   separately\
    \ in the document, because all of the single provider\n   requirements would apply\
    \ equally to this case.\n   It is expected that many of the generic requirements\
    \ described in\n   this document are independent of the three deployment scenarios\n\
    \   listed above.  However, specific requirements that are indeed\n   dependent\
    \ on the deployment scenario will be pointed out in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Outline of this document
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Outline of this document\n   This document describes generic requirements\
    \ for Provider Provisioned\n   Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN).  The document\
    \ contains several\n   sections, with each set representing a significant aspect\
    \ of PPVPN\n   requirements.\n   Section 2 lists authors who contributed to this\
    \ document.  Section 3\n   defines terminology and presents a taxonomy of PPVPN\
    \ technologies.\n   The taxonomy contains two broad classes, representing Layer\
    \ 2 and\n   Layer 3 VPNs.  Each top level VPN class contains subordinate classes.\n\
    \   For example, the Layer 3 VPN class contains a subordinate class of\n   PE-based\
    \ Layer 3 VPNs.\n   Sections 4, 5, 6 describe generic PPVPN requirements.\n  \
    \ The requirements are broadly classified under the following\n   categories:\n\
    \   1) Service requirements - Service attributes that the customer can\n     \
    \ observe or measure.  For example, does the service forward frames\n      or\
    \ route datagrams?  What security guarantees does the service\n      provide?\
    \  Availability and stability are key requirements in this\n      category.\n\
    \   2) Provider requirements - Characteristics that Service Providers use\n  \
    \    to determine the cost-effectiveness of a PPVPN service.  Scaling\n      and\
    \ management are examples of Provider requirements.\n   3) Engineering requirements\
    \ - Implementation characteristics that\n      make service and provider requirements\
    \ achievable.  These can be\n      further classified as:\n      3a) Forwarding\
    \ plane requirements - e.g., requirements related to\n          router forwarding\
    \ behavior.\n      3b) Control plane requirements - e.g., requirements related\
    \ to\n          reachability and distribution of reachability information.\n \
    \     3c) Requirements related to the commonality of PPVPN mechanisms\n      \
    \    with each other and with generic Internet mechanisms.\n"

- title: 4.  Service requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Service requirements\n   These are the requirements that a customer can observe\
    \ or measure, in\n   order to verify if the PPVPN service that the Service Provider\
    \ (SP)\n   provides is satisfactory.  As mentioned before, each of these\n   requirements\
    \ apply equally across each of the three deployment\n   scenarios unless stated\
    \ otherwise.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Availability
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Availability\n   VPN services MUST have high availability.  VPNs that are\
    \ distributed\n   over several sites require connectivity to be maintained even\
    \ in the\n   event of network failures or degraded service.\n   This can be achieved\
    \ via various redundancy techniques such as:\n   1. Physical Diversity\n     \
    \ A single site connected to multiple CEs (for CE-based PPVPNs) or\n      PEs\
    \ (for PE-based PPVPNs), or different POPs, or even different\n      service providers.\n\
    \   2. Tunnel redundancy\n      Redundant tunnels may be set up between the PEs\
    \ (in a PE-based\n      PPVPN) or the CEs (in a CE-based PPVPN) so that if one\
    \ tunnel\n      fails, VPN traffic can continue to flow across the other tunnel\n\
    \      that has already been set-up in advance.\n      Tunnel redundancy may be\
    \ provided over and above physical\n      diversity.  For example, a single site\
    \ may be connected to two CEs\n      (for CE-based PPVPNs) or two PEs (for PE-based\
    \ PPVPNs).  Tunnels\n      may be set up between each of the CEs (or PEs as the\
    \ case may be)\n      across different sites.\n      Of course, redundancy means\
    \ additional resources being used, and\n      consequently, management of additional\
    \ resources, which would\n      impact the overall scaling of the service.\n \
    \     It should be noted that it is difficult to guarantee high\n      availability\
    \ when the VPN service is across multiple providers,\n      unless there is a\
    \ negotiation between the different service\n      providers to maintain the service\
    \ level agreement for the VPN\n      customer.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Stability
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Stability\n   In addition to availability, VPN services MUST also be stable.\n\
    \   Stability is a function of several components such as VPN routing,\n   signaling\
    \ and discovery mechanisms, in addition to tunnel stability.\n   For example,\
    \ in the case of routing, route flapping or routing loops\n   MUST be avoided\
    \ in order to ensure stability.  Stability of the VPN\n   service is directly\
    \ related to the stability of the mechanisms and\n   protocols used to establish\
    \ the service.  It SHOULD also be possible\n   to allow network upgrades and maintenance\
    \ procedures without\n   impacting the VPN service.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Traffic types
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Traffic types\n   VPN services MUST support unicast (or point to point)\
    \ traffic and\n   SHOULD support any-to-any or point-to-multipoint traffic including\n\
    \   multicast and broadcast traffic.  In the broadcast model, the network\n  \
    \ delivers a stream to all members of a subnetwork, regardless of their\n   interest\
    \ in that stream.  In the multicast model, the network\n   delivers a stream to\
    \ a set of destinations that have registered\n   interest in the stream.  All\
    \ destinations need not belong to the same\n   subnetwork.  Multicast is more\
    \ applicable to L3 VPNs while broadcast\n   is more applicable to L2VPNs.  It\
    \ is desirable to support multicast\n   limited in scope to an intranet or extranet.\
    \  The solution SHOULD be\n   able to support a large number of such intranet\
    \ or extranet specific\n   multicast groups in a scalable manner.\n   All PPVPN\
    \ approaches SHALL support both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.\n   Specific L2 traffic\
    \ types (e.g., ATM, Frame Relay and Ethernet) SHALL\n   be supported via encapsulation\
    \ in IP or MPLS tunnels in the case of\n   L2VPNs.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Data isolation
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Data isolation\n   The PPVPN MUST support forwarding plane isolation. \
    \ The network MUST\n   never deliver user data across VPN boundaries unless the\
    \ two VPNs\n   participate in an intranet or extranet.\n   Furthermore, if the\
    \ provider network receives signaling or routing\n   information from one VPN,\
    \ it MUST NOT reveal that information to\n   another VPN unless the two VPNs participate\
    \ in an intranet or\n   extranet.  It should be noted that the disclosure of any\n\
    \   signaling/routing information across an extranet MUST be filtered per\n  \
    \ the extranet agreement between the organizations participating in the\n   extranet.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Security
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Security\n   A range of security features SHOULD be supported by the suite\
    \ of\n   PPVPN solutions in the form of securing customer flows, providing\n \
    \  authentication services for temporary, remote or mobile users, and\n   the\
    \ need to protect service provider resources involved in supporting\n   a PPVPN.\
    \  These security features SHOULD be implemented based on the\n   framework outlined\
    \ in [VPN-SEC].  Each PPVPN solution SHOULD state\n   which security features\

    \ offer QoS guarantees.  Support of QoS guarantees in the multi-\n   service-provider\

    \ scenario\n   REQUIRES each of the participating providers to support the\n \
    \  mechanisms being used, and as such, this is difficult to achieve.\n   Note\
    \ that all cases involving QoS may require that the CE and/or PE\n   perform shaping\

    \ is traffic engineered or includes capacity for restoration and\n   growth. \
    \ Hence in most cases PE-PE QoS is not a major issue.  As far\n   as access QoS\
    \ is concerned, there are two directions of QoS\n   management that may be considered\
    \ in any PPVPN service regarding QoS:\n   -  From the CE across the access network\

    \ PE devices SHOULD be capable of supporting QoS across at\n   least the following\

    \ PPP\n   -  QoS-enabled wireless (e.g., LMDS, MMDS)\n   -  Cable modem\n   -\
    \  QoS-enabled Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)\n   Different service models for\
    \ QoS may be supported.  Examples of PPVPN\n   QoS service models are:\n   - \
    \ Managed access service: Provides QoS on the access connection\n      between\
    \ CE and the customer facing ports of the PE.  No QoS\n      support is required\
    \ in the provider core network in this case.\n   -  Edge-to-edge QoS: Provides\
    \ QoS across the provider core, either\n      between CE pairs or PE pairs, depending\
    \ on the tunnel demarcation\n      points.  This scenario requires QoS support\

    \   other and with generic Internet mechanisms\n   As far as possible, the mechanisms\
    \ used to establish a VPN service\n   SHOULD re-use well-known IETF protocols,\
    \ limiting the need to define\n   new protocols from scratch.  It should, however,\

    \ mechanisms SHOULD NOT conflict with the\n   architectural principles of the\
    \ Internet, nor SHOULD it put at risk\n   the existing Internet systems.  For\
    \ example, IETF-developed routing\n   protocols SHOULD be used for routing of\
    \ L3 PPVPN traffic, without\n   adding VPN-specific state to the Internet core\
    \ routers.  Similarly,\n   well-known L2 technologies SHOULD be used in VPNs offering\
    \ L2\n   services, without imposing risks to the Internet routers.  A solution\n\
    \   MUST be implementable without requiring additional functionality to\n   the\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Security requirements for Provider Provisioned\
    \ VPNs have been\n   described in Section 4.5.  In addition, the following considerations\n\
    \   need to be kept in mind when a provider provisioned VPN service is\n   provided\
    \ across a public network infrastructure that is also used to\n   provide Internet\
    \ connectivity.  In general, the security framework\n   described in [VPN-SEC]\
    \ SHOULD be used as far as it is applicable to\n   the given type of PPVPN service.\n\
    \   The PE device has a lot of functionality required for the successful\n   operation\
    \ of the VPN service.  The PE device is frequently also part\n   of the backbone\
    \ providing Internet services, and is therefore\n   susceptible to security and\
    \ denial of service attacks.  The PE\n   control plane CPU is vulnerable from\
    \ this point of view, and it may\n   impact not only VPN services but also general\
    \ Internet services if\n   not adequately protected.  In addition to VPN configuration,\
    \ if\n   mechanisms such as QoS are provisioned on the PE, it is possible for\n\
    \   attackers to recognize the highest priority traffic or customers and\n   launch\
    \ directed attacks.  Care SHOULD be taken to prevent such\n   attacks whenever\
    \ any value added services such as QoS are offered.\n   When a service such as\
    \ \"Dynamic Bandwidth Management\" as described in\n   Section 5.2.1 is provided,\
    \ it allows customers to dynamically request\n   for changes to their bandwidth\
    \ allocation.  The provider MUST take\n   care to authenticate such requests and\
    \ detect and prevent possible\n   Denial-of-Service attacks.  These DoS attacks\
    \ are possible when a\n   customer maliciously or accidentally may cause a change\
    \ in bandwidth\n   allocation that may impact the bandwidth allocated to other\
    \ VPN\n   customers or Internet users.\n   Different choices of VPN technology\
    \ have different assurance levels\n   of the privacy of a customer's network.\
    \  For example, CE-based\n   solutions may enjoy more privacy than PE-based VPNs\
    \ by virtue of\n   tunnels extending from CE to CE, even if the tunnels are not\n\
    \   encrypted.  In a PE-based VPN, a PE has many more sites than those\n   attached\
    \ to a CE in a CE-based VPN.  A large number of these sites\n   may use [RFC1918]\
    \ addresses.  Provisioning mistakes and PE software\n   bugs may make traffic\
    \ more prone to being misdirected as opposed to a\n   CE-based VPN.  Care MUST\
    \ be taken to prevent misconfiguration in all\n   kinds of PPVPNs, but more care\
    \ MUST be taken in the case of PE-based\n   VPNs, as this could impact other customers\
    \ and Internet services.\n   Similarly, there SHOULD be mechanisms to prevent\
    \ the flooding of\n   Internet routing tables whenever there is a misconfiguration\
    \ or\n   failure of PPVPN control mechanisms that use Internet routing\n   protocols\
    \ for relay of VPN-specific information.\n   Different deployment scenarios also\
    \ dictate the level of security\n   that may be needed for a VPN.  For example,\
    \ it is easier to control\n   security in a single provider, single AS VPN and\
    \ therefore, expensive\n   encryption techniques may not be used in this case,\
    \ as long as VPN\n   traffic is isolated from the Internet.  There is a reasonable\
    \ amount\n   of control possible in the single provider, multi AS case, although\n\
    \   care SHOULD be taken to ensure the constrained distribution of VPN\n   route\
    \ information across the ASes.  Security is more of a challenge\n   in the multi-provider\
    \ case, where it may be necessary to adopt\n   encryption techniques in order\
    \ to provide the highest level of\n   security.\n"
