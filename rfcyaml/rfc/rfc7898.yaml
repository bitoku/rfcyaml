  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and the GMPLS extensions\
    \ to\n   RSVP-TE [RFC3473] allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly\n\
    \   included in a path setup using the Explicit Route Object (ERO).\n   Further,\
    \ Exclude Route extensions [RFC4874] allow abstract nodes or\n   resources to\
    \ be excluded from the whole path using the Exclude Route\n   Object (XRO).  To\
    \ exclude certain abstract nodes or resources between\n   a specific pair of abstract\
    \ nodes present in an ERO, an Explicit\n   Exclusion Route subobject (EXRS) is\
    \ used.\n   [RFC3209] already describes the notion of abstract nodes, where an\n\
    \   abstract node is a group of nodes whose internal topology is opaque\n   to\
    \ the ingress node of the Label Switched Path (LSP).  It further\n   defines a\
    \ subobject for AS, but with a 2-byte AS number only.\n   This document extends\
    \ the notion of abstract nodes by adding new\n   subobjects for IGP areas and\
    \ 4-byte AS numbers (as per [RFC6793]).\n   These subobjects can be included in\
    \ ERO, XRO, or EXRS.\n   In case of per-domain path computation [RFC5152], where\
    \ the full path\n   of an inter-domain TE LSP cannot be or is not determined at\
    \ the\n   ingress node, the signaling message could use domain identifiers.\n\
    \   The use of these new subobjects is illustrated in Appendix A.\n   Further,\
    \ the domain identifier could simply act as a delimiter to\n   specify where the\
    \ domain boundary starts and ends.\n   This is a companion document to Path Computation\
    \ Element Protocol\n   (PCEP) extensions for the domain sequence [RFC7897].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope\n   The procedures described in this document are experimental. \
    \ The\n   experiment is intended to enable research for the usage of domain\n\
    \   subobjects for inter-domain path setup.  For this purpose, this\n   document\
    \ specifies new domain subobjects as well as how they\n   incorporate with existing\
    \ subobjects.\n   The experiment will end two years after the RFC is published.\
    \  At\n   that point, the RFC authors will attempt to determine how widely this\n\
    \   has been implemented and deployed.\n   This document does not change the procedures\
    \ for handling subobjects\n   in RSVP-TE.\n   The new subobjects introduced by\
    \ this document will not be understood\n   by legacy implementations.  If a legacy\
    \ implementation receives one\n   of the subobjects that it does not understand\
    \ in an RSVP-TE object,\n   the legacy implementation will behave as described\
    \ in [RFC3209] and\n   [RFC4874].  Therefore, it is assumed that this experiment\
    \ will be\n   conducted only when all nodes processing the new subobject form\
    \ part\n   of the experiment.\n   When the result of implementation and deployment\
    \ are available, this\n   document will be updated and refined, and then it will\
    \ be moved from\n   Experimental to Standards Track.\n   It should be noted that\
    \ there are other ways such as the use of a\n   boundary node to identify the\
    \ domain (instead of a domain\n   identifier); the mechanism defined in this document\
    \ is just another\n   tool in the toolkit for the operator.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Domains
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Domains\n   [RFC4726] and [RFC4655] define domain as a separate administrative\
    \ or\n   geographic environment within the network.  A domain could be further\n\
    \   defined as a zone of routing or computational ability.  Under these\n   definitions,\
    \ a domain might be categorized as an AS or an IGP area.\n   As per [RFC3209],\
    \ an abstract node is a group of nodes whose internal\n   topology is opaque to\
    \ the ingress node of the LSP.  Using this\n   concept of abstraction, an explicitly\
    \ routed LSP can be specified as\n   a sequence of IP prefixes or a sequence of\
    \ ASes.  In this document,\n   we extend the notion to include the IGP area and\
    \ 4-byte AS number.\n   These subobjects appear in RSVP-TE, notably in:\n   o\
    \  Explicit Route Object (ERO): As per [RFC3209], an explicit route\n      is\
    \ a particular path in the network topology including abstract\n      nodes (including\
    \ domains).\n   o  Exclude Route Object (XRO): As per [RFC4874], an Exclude Route\n\
    \      identifies a list of abstract nodes (including domains) that\n      should\
    \ not be traversed along the path of the LSP being\n      established.\n   o \
    \ Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS): As per [RFC4874], used\n      to\
    \ specify exclusion of certain abstract nodes between a specific\n      pair of\
    \ nodes.  EXRS is a subobject carried inside the ERO.  These\n      subobjects\
    \ can be used to specify the domains to be excluded\n      between two abstract\
    \ nodes.\n"
