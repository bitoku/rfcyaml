- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This MIB describes objects used for managing IP Multicast\
    \ Routing\n   [16], independent of the specific multicast routing protocol [17-21]\n\
    \   in use.  Managed objects specific to particular multicast routing\n   protocols\
    \ are specified elsewhere.  Similarly, this MIB does not\n   support management\
    \ of multicast routing for other address families,\n   including IPv6.  Such management\
    \ may be supported by other MIBs.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o    An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n\
    \        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].\n      \
    \  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC\n        2578\
    \ [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].\n   o    Message protocols\
    \ for transferring management information.  The\n        first version of the\
    \ SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n        described in STD 15, RFC\
    \ 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP\n        message protocol, which is\
    \ not an Internet standards track\n        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described\
    \ in RFC 1901 [9] and\n        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message\
    \ protocol is\n        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572\
    \ [11] and\n        RFC 2574 [12].\n   o    Protocol operations for accessing\
    \ management information.  The\n        first set of protocol operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of\
    \ protocol\n        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC\
    \ 1905\n        [13].\n   o    A set of fundamental applications described in\
    \ RFC 2573 [14] and\n        the view-based access control mechanism described\
    \ in RFC 2575\n        [15].\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1\
    \ can be produced through the appropriate\n   translations.  The resulting translated\
    \ MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are\
    \ omitted because no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine\
    \ readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions\
    \ in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine\n\
    \   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the\n  \
    \ MIB.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   This MIB module contains one scalar and five tables.  The tables\
    \ are:\n   (1)  the IP Multicast Route Table containing multicast routing\n  \
    \      information for IP datagrams sent by particular sources to the\n      \
    \  IP multicast groups known to a router.\n   (2)  the IP Multicast Routing Next\
    \ Hop Table containing information\n        on the next-hops for the routing IP\
    \ multicast datagrams.  Each\n        entry is one of a list of next-hops on outgoing\
    \ interfaces for\n        particular sources sending to a particular multicast\
    \ group\n        address.\n   (3)  the IP Multicast Routing Interface Table containing\
    \ multicast\n        routing information specific to interfaces.\n   (4)  the\
    \ IP Multicast Scope Boundary Table containing the boundaries\n        configured\
    \ for multicast scopes [22].\n   (5)  the IP Multicast Scope Name Table containing\
    \ human-readable\n        names of multicast scope.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   The ipMRouteRtProto, ipMRouteNextHopProtocol,\n \
    \  ipMRouteInterfaceProtocol, and ipMRouteProtocol use textual\n   conventions\
    \ imported from the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB.  The purpose of\n   defining these textual\
    \ conventions in a separate MIB module is to\n   allow additional values to be\
    \ defined without having to issue a new\n   version of this document.  The Internet\
    \ Assigned Numbers Authority\n   (IANA) is responsible for the assignment of all\
    \ Internet numbers,\n   including various SNMP-related numbers; it will administer\
    \ the values\n   associated with these textual conventions.\n   The rules for\
    \ additions or changes to the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB are\n   outlined in the DESCRIPTION\
    \ clause associated with its MODULE-\n   IDENTITY statement.\n   The current versions\
    \ of the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB can be accessed from the\n   IANA home page at: \"http://www.iana.org/\"\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB contains readable objects whose values\
    \ provide information\n   related to multicast routing, including information\
    \ on what machines\n   are sending to which groups.  There are also a number of\
    \ objects that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create,\
    \ such as\n   those which allow an administrator to configure multicast boundaries.\n\
    \   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively\n   innocuous,\
    \ unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause\n   a denial of service,\
    \ or could cause wider distribution of packets\n   intended only for local distribution.\
    \  Hence, the support for SET\n   operations in a non-secure environment without\
    \ proper protection can\n   have a negative effect on network operations.\n  \
    \ SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the\n   network itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,\n   there is no control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access and SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider\
    \ the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based\n\
    \   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user\
    \ responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to this MIB,\
    \ is properly configured to give\n   access to those objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have\n   legitimate rights to access them.\n"
