  contents:
  - "Status of This Memo\n   This memo describes an experimental method by which the\
    \ Simple\n   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as specified in [1] can be used\n\
    \   over Ethernet MAC layer framing [2] instead of the Internet UDP/IP\n   protocol\
    \ stack.  This specification is useful for LAN based network\n   elements that\
    \ support no higher layer protocols beyond the MAC sub-\n   layer.  Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: Overview and Rational
  contents:
  - "Overview and Rational\n   SNMP has been successful in managing Internet capable\
    \ network\n   elements which support the protocol stack at least through UDP the\n\
    \   connectionless Internet transport layer protocol.  As originally\n   designed,\
    \ SNMP is capable of running over any reasonable transport\n   mechanism (not\
    \ necessarily a transport protocol) that supports bi-\n   directional flow and\
    \ addressability.\n   Many non-Internet capable network elements are present in\
    \ local\n   networks; for example, repeaters and wiring concentrators.  They\n\
    \   include both addressability, and programmable intelligence.  These\n   devices\
    \ are widely used and increasingly important yet, for the most\n   part, invisible\
    \ except through proprietary mechanisms.\n"
- title: Specification
  contents:
  - "Specification\n   Almost all Internet capable network elements use the same mechanism\n\
    \   for encapsulation of the Internet protocol stack regardless of\n   conformity\
    \ with the physical characteristics of Ethernet or 802.3,\n   this mechanism is\
    \ specified in [3] and [4].  This specification\n   continues that style with\
    \ the assignment (by XEROX) of 33100\n   (hexadecimal 814C) to the Ethernet Type\
    \ field for SNMP.  The data\n   portion of the Ethernet frame would then be a\
    \ standard SNMP message\n   as specified in [1].\n"
