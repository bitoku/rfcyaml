  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol [RFC6830] specifies an\n\
    \   architecture and mechanism for replacing the addresses currently used\n  \
    \ by IP with two separate name spaces: Endpoint IDs (EIDs), used within\n   sites;\
    \ and Routing Locators (RLOCs), used on the transit networks\n   that make up\
    \ the Internet infrastructure.  To achieve this\n   separation, LISP defines protocol\
    \ mechanisms for mapping from EIDs to\n   RLOCs.  In addition, LISP assumes the\
    \ existence of a database to\n   store and propagate those mappings globally.\
    \  Several such databases\n   have been proposed; among them are the Content distribution\
    \ Overlay\n   Network Service for LISP (LISP-CONS) [LISP-CONS], LISP-NERD\n  \
    \ (a Not-so-novel EID-to-RLOC Database) [RFC6837], and LISP Alternative\n   Logical\
    \ Topology (LISP+ALT) [RFC6836].\n   The LISP Mapping Service defines two new\
    \ types of LISP-speaking\n   devices: the Map-Resolver, which accepts Map-Requests\
    \ from an Ingress\n   Tunnel Router (ITR) and \"resolves\" the EID-to-RLOC mapping\
    \ using a\n   mapping database; and the Map-Server, which learns authoritative\n\
    \   EID-to-RLOC mappings from an Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) and publishes\n  \
    \ them in a database.\n   Conceptually, LISP Map-Servers share some of the same\
    \ basic\n   configuration and maintenance properties as Domain Name System (DNS)\n\
    \   [RFC1035] servers; likewise, Map-Resolvers are conceptually similar\n   to\
    \ DNS caching resolvers.  With this in mind, this specification\n   borrows familiar\
    \ terminology (resolver and server) from the DNS\n   specifications.\n   Note\
    \ that while this document assumes a LISP+ALT database mapping\n   infrastructure\
    \ to illustrate certain aspects of Map-Server and\n   Map-Resolver operation,\
    \ the Mapping Service interface can (and likely\n   will) be used by ITRs and\
    \ ETRs to access other mapping database\n   systems as the LISP infrastructure\
    \ evolves.\n   Section 5 of this document notes a number of issues with the\n\
    \   Map-Server and Map-Resolver design that are not yet completely\n   understood\
    \ and are subjects of further experimentation.\n   The LISP Mapping Service is\
    \ an important component of the LISP\n   toolset.  Issues and concerns about the\
    \ deployment of LISP for\n   Internet traffic are discussed in [RFC6830].\n"
- title: 2.  Definition of Terms
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition of Terms\n   Map-Server:   A network infrastructure component\
    \ that learns of\n      EID-Prefix mapping entries from an ETR, via the registration\n\
    \      mechanism described below, or some other authoritative source if\n    \
    \  one exists.  A Map-Server publishes these EID-Prefixes in a\n      mapping\
    \ database.\n   Map-Resolver:   A network infrastructure component that accepts\
    \ LISP\n      Encapsulated Map-Requests, typically from an ITR, and determines\n\
    \      whether or not the destination IP address is part of the EID\n      namespace;\
    \ if it is not, a Negative Map-Reply is returned.\n      Otherwise, the Map-Resolver\
    \ finds the appropriate EID-to-RLOC\n      mapping by consulting a mapping database\
    \ system.\n   Encapsulated Map-Request:   A LISP Map-Request carried within an\n\
    \      Encapsulated Control Message, which has an additional LISP header\n   \
    \   prepended.  Sent to UDP destination port 4342.  The \"outer\"\n      addresses\
    \ are globally routable IP addresses, also known as RLOCs.\n      Used by an ITR\
    \ when sending to a Map-Resolver and by a Map-Server\n      when forwarding a\
    \ Map-Request to an ETR.\n   Negative Map-Reply:   A LISP Map-Reply that contains\
    \ an empty\n      Locator-Set.  Returned in response to a Map-Request if the\n\
    \      destination EID does not exist in the mapping database.\n      Typically,\
    \ this means that the \"EID\" being requested is an IP\n      address connected\
    \ to a non-LISP site.\n   Map-Register message:   A LISP message sent by an ETR\
    \ to a Map-Server\n      to register its associated EID-Prefixes.  In addition\
    \ to the set\n      of EID-Prefixes to register, the message includes one or more\n\
    \      RLOCs to be used by the Map-Server when forwarding Map-Requests\n     \
    \ (re-formatted as Encapsulated Map-Requests) received through the\n      database\
    \ mapping system.  An ETR may request that the Map-Server\n      answer Map-Requests\
    \ on its behalf by setting the \"proxy Map-Reply\"\n      flag (P-bit) in the\
    \ message.\n   Map-Notify message:   A LISP message sent by a Map-Server to an\
    \ ETR\n      to confirm that a Map-Register has been received and processed.\n\
    \      An ETR requests that a Map-Notify be returned by setting the\n      \"\
    want-map-notify\" flag (M-bit) in the Map-Register message.\n      Unlike a Map-Reply,\
    \ a Map-Notify uses UDP port 4342 for both\n      source and destination.\n  \
    \ For definitions of other terms -- notably Map-Request, Map-Reply,\n   Ingress\
    \ Tunnel Router (ITR), and Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) -- please\n   consult the\
    \ LISP specification [RFC6830].\n"
- title: 3.  Basic Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Basic Overview\n   A Map-Server is a device that publishes EID-Prefixes in\
    \ a LISP\n   mapping database on behalf of a set of ETRs.  When it receives a\
    \ Map\n   Request (typically from an ITR), it consults the mapping database to\n\
    \   find an ETR that can answer with the set of RLOCs for an EID-Prefix.\n   To\
    \ publish its EID-Prefixes, an ETR periodically sends Map-Register\n   messages\
    \ to the Map-Server.  A Map-Register message contains a list\n   of EID-Prefixes\
    \ plus a set of RLOCs that can be used to reach the ETR\n   when a Map-Server\
    \ needs to forward a Map-Request to it.\n   When LISP+ALT is used as the mapping\
    \ database, a Map-Server connects\n   to the ALT network and acts as a \"last-hop\"\
    \ ALT-Router.  Intermediate\n   ALT-Routers forward Map-Requests to the Map-Server\
    \ that advertises a\n   particular EID-Prefix, and the Map-Server forwards them\
    \ to the owning\n   ETR, which responds with Map-Reply messages.\n   A Map-Resolver\
    \ receives Encapsulated Map-Requests from its client\n   ITRs and uses a mapping\
    \ database system to find the appropriate ETR\n   to answer those requests.  On\
    \ a LISP+ALT network, a Map-Resolver acts\n   as a \"first-hop\" ALT-Router. \
    \ It has Generic Routing Encapsulation\n   (GRE) tunnels configured to other ALT-Routers\
    \ and uses BGP to learn\n   paths to ETRs for different prefixes in the LISP+ALT\
    \ database.  The\n   Map-Resolver uses this path information to forward Map-Requests\
    \ over\n   the ALT to the correct ETRs.\n   Note that while it is conceivable\
    \ that a Map-Resolver could cache\n   responses to improve performance, issues\
    \ surrounding cache management\n   will need to be resolved so that doing so will\
    \ be reliable and\n   practical.  As initially deployed, Map-Resolvers will operate\
    \ only in\n   a non-caching mode, decapsulating and forwarding Encapsulated Map\n\
    \   Requests received from ITRs.  Any specification of caching\n   functionality\
    \ is left for future work.\n   Note that a single device can implement the functions\
    \ of both a\n   Map-Server and a Map-Resolver, and in many cases the functions\
    \ will\n   be co-located in that way.\n   Detailed descriptions of the LISP packet\
    \ types referenced by this\n   document may be found in [RFC6830].\n"

- title: 4.1.  ITR EID-to-RLOC Mapping Resolution
  contents:
  - "4.1.  ITR EID-to-RLOC Mapping Resolution\n   An ITR is configured with one or\
    \ more Map-Resolver addresses.  These\n   addresses are \"Locators\" (or RLOCs)\
    \ and must be routable on the\n   underlying core network; they must not need\
    \ to be resolved through\n   LISP EID-to-RLOC mapping, as that would introduce\
    \ a circular\n   dependency.  When using a Map-Resolver, an ITR does not need\
    \ to\n   connect to any other database mapping system.  In particular, the ITR\n\
    \   need not connect to the LISP+ALT infrastructure or implement the BGP\n   and\
    \ GRE protocols that it uses.\n   An ITR sends an Encapsulated Map-Request to\
    \ a configured Map-Resolver\n   when it needs an EID-to-RLOC mapping that is not\
    \ found in its local\n   map-cache.  Using the Map-Resolver greatly reduces both\
    \ the\n   complexity of the ITR implementation and the costs associated with\n\
    \   its operation.\n   In response to an Encapsulated Map-Request, the ITR can\
    \ expect one of\n   the following:\n   o  An immediate Negative Map-Reply (with\
    \ action code of\n      \"Natively-Forward\", 15-minute Time to Live (TTL)) from\
    \ the\n      Map-Resolver if the Map-Resolver can determine that the requested\n\
    \      EID does not exist.  The ITR saves the EID-Prefix returned in the\n   \
    \   Map-Reply in its cache, marks it as non-LISP-capable, and knows\n      not\
    \ to attempt LISP encapsulation for destinations matching it.\n   o  A Negative\
    \ Map-Reply, with action code of \"Natively-Forward\", from\n      a Map-Server\
    \ that is authoritative for an EID-Prefix that matches\n      the requested EID\
    \ but that does not have an actively registered,\n      more-specific ID-prefix.\
    \  In this case, the requested EID is said\n      to match a \"hole\" in the authoritative\
    \ EID-Prefix.  If the\n      requested EID matches a more-specific EID-Prefix\
    \ that has been\n      delegated by the Map-Server but for which no ETRs are currently\n\
    \      registered, a 1-minute TTL is returned.  If the requested EID\n      matches\
    \ a non-delegated part of the authoritative EID-Prefix, then\n      it is not\
    \ a LISP EID and a 15-minute TTL is returned.  See\n      Section 4.2 for discussion\
    \ of aggregate EID-Prefixes and details\n      of Map-Server EID-Prefix matching.\n\
    \   o  A LISP Map-Reply from the ETR that owns the EID-to-RLOC mapping or\n  \
    \    possibly from a Map-Server answering on behalf of the ETR.  See\n      Section\
    \ 4.4 for more details on Map-Resolver message processing.\n   Note that an ITR\
    \ may be configured to both use a Map-Resolver and to\n   participate in a LISP+ALT\
    \ logical network.  In such a situation, the\n   ITR should send Map-Requests\
    \ through the ALT network for any\n   EID-Prefix learned via ALT BGP.  Such a\
    \ configuration is expected to\n   be very rare, since there is little benefit\
    \ to using a Map-Resolver\n   if an ITR is already using LISP+ALT.  There would\
    \ be, for example, no\n   need for such an ITR to send a Map-Request to a possibly\
    \ non-existent\n   EID (and rely on Negative Map-Replies) if it can consult the\
    \ ALT\n   database to verify that an EID-Prefix is present before sending that\n\
    \   Map-Request.\n"
- title: 4.2.  EID-Prefix Configuration and ETR Registration
  contents:
  - "4.2.  EID-Prefix Configuration and ETR Registration\n   An ETR publishes its\
    \ EID-Prefixes on a Map-Server by sending LISP\n   Map-Register messages.  A Map-Register\
    \ message includes\n   authentication data, so prior to sending a Map-Register\
    \ message, the\n   ETR and Map-Server must be configured with a shared secret\
    \ or other\n   relevant authentication information.  A Map-Server's configuration\n\
    \   must also include a list of the EID-Prefixes for which each ETR is\n   authoritative.\
    \  Upon receipt of a Map-Register from an ETR, a\n   Map-Server accepts only EID-Prefixes\
    \ that are configured for that\n   ETR.  Failure to implement such a check would\
    \ leave the mapping\n   system vulnerable to trivial EID-Prefix hijacking attacks.\
    \  As\n   developers and operators gain experience with the mapping system,\n\
    \   additional, stronger security measures may be added to the\n   registration\
    \ process.\n   In addition to the set of EID-Prefixes defined for each ETR that\
    \ may\n   register, a Map-Server is typically also configured with one or more\n\
    \   aggregate prefixes that define the part of the EID numbering space\n   assigned\
    \ to it.  When LISP+ALT is the database in use, aggregate\n   EID-Prefixes are\
    \ implemented as discard routes and advertised into\n   ALT BGP.  The existence\
    \ of aggregate EID-Prefixes in a Map-Server's\n   database means that it may receive\
    \ Map Requests for EID-Prefixes that\n   match an aggregate but do not match a\
    \ registered prefix; Section 4.3\n   describes how this is handled.\n   Map-Register\
    \ messages are sent periodically from an ETR to a\n   Map-Server with a suggested\
    \ interval between messages of one minute.\n   A Map-Server should time out and\
    \ remove an ETR's registration if it\n   has not received a valid Map-Register\
    \ message within the past\n   three minutes.  When first contacting a Map-Server\
    \ after restart or\n   changes to its EID-to-RLOC database mappings, an ETR may\
    \ initially\n   send Map-Register messages at an increased frequency, up to one\
    \ every\n   20 seconds.  This \"quick registration\" period is limited to\n  \
    \ five minutes in duration.\n   An ETR may request that a Map-Server explicitly\
    \ acknowledge receipt\n   and processing of a Map-Register message by setting\
    \ the\n   \"want-map-notify\" (M-bit) flag.  A Map-Server that receives a\n  \
    \ Map-Register with this flag set will respond with a Map-Notify\n   message.\
    \  Typical use of this flag by an ETR would be to set it for\n   Map-Register\
    \ messages sent during the initial \"quick registration\"\n   with a Map-Server\
    \ but then set it only occasionally during\n   steady-state maintenance of its\
    \ association with that Map-Server.\n   Note that the Map-Notify message is sent\
    \ to UDP destination port\n   4342, not to the source port specified in the original\
    \ Map-Register\n   message.\n   Note that a one-minute minimum registration interval\
    \ during\n   maintenance of an ETR-Map-Server association places a lower bound\
    \ on\n   how quickly and how frequently a mapping database entry can be\n   updated.\
    \  This may have implications for what sorts of mobility can\n   be supported\
    \ directly by the mapping system; shorter registration\n   intervals or other\
    \ mechanisms might be needed to support faster\n   mobility in some cases.  For\
    \ a discussion on one way that faster\n   mobility may be implemented for individual\
    \ devices, please see\n   [LISP-MN].\n   An ETR may also request, by setting the\
    \ \"proxy Map-Reply\" flag\n   (P-bit) in the Map-Register message, that a Map-Server\
    \ answer\n   Map-Requests instead of forwarding them to the ETR.  See [RFC6830]\n\
    \   for details on how the Map-Server sets certain flags (such as those\n   indicating\
    \ whether the message is authoritative and how returned\n   Locators should be\
    \ treated) when sending a Map-Reply on behalf of an\n   ETR.  When an ETR requests\
    \ proxy reply service, it should include all\n   RLOCs for all ETRs for the EID-Prefix\
    \ being registered, along with\n   the routable flag (\"R-bit\") setting for each\
    \ RLOC.  The Map-Server\n   includes all of this information in Map-Reply messages\
    \ that it sends\n   on behalf of the ETR.  This differs from a non-proxy registration,\n\
    \   since the latter need only provide one or more RLOCs for a Map-Server\n  \
    \ to use for forwarding Map-Requests; the registration information is\n   not\
    \ used in Map-Replies, so it being incomplete is not incorrect.\n   An ETR that\
    \ uses a Map-Server to publish its EID-to-RLOC mappings\n   does not need to participate\
    \ further in the mapping database\n   protocol(s).  When using a LISP+ALT mapping\
    \ database, for example,\n   this means that the ETR does not need to implement\
    \ GRE or BGP, which\n   greatly simplifies its configuration and reduces its cost\
    \ of\n   operation.\n   Note that use of a Map-Server does not preclude an ETR\
    \ from also\n   connecting to the mapping database (i.e., it could also connect\
    \ to\n   the LISP+ALT network), but doing so doesn't seem particularly useful,\n\
    \   as the whole purpose of using a Map-Server is to avoid the complexity\n  \
    \ of the mapping database protocols.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Map-Server Processing
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Map-Server Processing\n   Once a Map-Server has EID-Prefixes registered\
    \ by its client ETRs, it\n   can accept and process Map-Requests for them.\n \
    \  In response to a Map-Request (received over the ALT if LISP+ALT is in\n   use),\
    \ the Map-Server first checks to see if the destination EID\n   matches a configured\
    \ EID-Prefix.  If there is no match, the\n   Map-Server returns a Negative Map-Reply\
    \ with action code\n   \"Natively-Forward\" and a 15-minute TTL.  This may occur\
    \ if a Map\n   Request is received for a configured aggregate EID-Prefix for which\n\
    \   no more-specific EID-Prefix exists; it indicates the presence of a\n   non-LISP\
    \ \"hole\" in the aggregate EID-Prefix.\n   Next, the Map-Server checks to see\
    \ if any ETRs have registered the\n   matching EID-Prefix.  If none are found,\
    \ then the Map-Server returns\n   a Negative Map-Reply with action code \"Natively-Forward\"\
    \ and a\n   1-minute TTL.\n   If any of the registered ETRs for the EID-Prefix\
    \ have requested proxy\n   reply service, then the Map-Server answers the request\
    \ instead of\n   forwarding it.  It returns a Map-Reply with the EID-Prefix, RLOCs,\n\
    \   and other information learned through the registration process.\n   If none\
    \ of the ETRs have requested proxy reply service, then the\n   Map-Server re-encapsulates\
    \ and forwards the resulting Encapsulated\n   Map-Request to one of the registered\
    \ ETRs.  It does not otherwise\n   alter the Map-Request, so any Map-Reply sent\
    \ by the ETR is returned\n   to the RLOC in the Map-Request, not to the Map-Server.\
    \  Unless also\n   acting as a Map-Resolver, a Map-Server should never receive\n\
    \   Map-Replies; any such messages should be discarded without response,\n   perhaps\
    \ accompanied by the logging of a diagnostic message if the\n   rate of Map-Replies\
    \ is suggestive of malicious traffic.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Map-Resolver Processing
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Map-Resolver Processing\n   Upon receipt of an Encapsulated Map-Request,\
    \ a Map-Resolver\n   decapsulates the enclosed message and then searches for the\

    \   or learned from associated ETRs if the Map-Resolver is also a\n   Map-Server\
    \ offering proxy reply service).  If it finds a matching\n   entry, it returns\

    \ to exist in the LISP-capable infrastructure.\n   If the Map-Resolver does not\
    \ have sufficient information to know\n   whether the EID exists, it needs to\
    \ forward the Map-Request to\n   another device that has more information about\
    \ the EID being\n   requested.  To do this, it forwards the unencapsulated Map-Request,\n\
    \   with the original ITR RLOC as the source, to the mapping database\n   system.\
    \  Using LISP+ALT, the Map-Resolver is connected to the ALT\n   network and sends\
    \ the Map-Request to the next ALT hop learned from\n   its ALT BGP neighbors.\
    \  The Map-Resolver does not send any response\n   to the ITR; since the source\
    \ RLOC is that of the ITR, the ETR or\n   Map-Server that receives the Map-Request\
    \ over the ALT and responds\n   will do so directly to the ITR.\n"

  - "4.4.1.  Anycast Map-Resolver Operation\n   A Map-Resolver can be set up to use\
    \ \"anycast\", where the same address\n   is assigned to multiple Map-Resolvers\
    \ and is propagated through IGP\n   routing, to facilitate the use of a topologically\
    \ close Map-Resolver\n   by each ITR.\n   Note that Map-Server associations with\
    \ ETRs should not use anycast\n   addresses, as registrations need to be established\
    \ between an ETR and\n   a specific set of Map-Servers, each identified by a specific\n\
    \   registration association.\n"
- title: 5.  Open Issues and Considerations

  - "5.  Open Issues and Considerations\n   There are a number of issues with the\
    \ Map-Server and Map-Resolver\n   design that are not yet completely understood.\
    \  Among these are:\n   o  Constants, such as those used for Map-Register frequency,\n\
    \      retransmission timeouts, retransmission limits, Negative Map-Reply\n  \
    \    TTLs, et al. are subject to further refinement as more experience\n     \
    \ with prototype deployment is gained.\n   o  Convergence time when an EID-to-RLOC\
    \ mapping changes, and\n      mechanisms for detecting and refreshing or removing\
    \ stale, cached\n      information.\n   o  Deployability and complexity tradeoffs\
    \ of implementing stronger\n      security measures in both EID-Prefix registration\
    \ and Map-Request/\n      Map-Reply processing.\n   o  Requirements for additional\
    \ state in the registration process\n      between Map-Servers and ETRs.\n   A\
    \ discussion of other issues surrounding LISP deployment may also be\n   found\
    \ in Section 15 of [RFC6830].\n   The authors expect that experimentation on the\
    \ LISP pilot network\n   will help answer open questions surrounding these and\
    \ other issues.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The 2-way LISP header nonce exchange documented\
    \ in [RFC6830] can be\n   used to avoid ITR spoofing attacks.\n   To publish an\
    \ authoritative EID-to-RLOC mapping with a Map-Server, an\n   ETR includes authentication\
    \ data that is a hash of the message using\n   a pair-wise shared key.  An implementation\
    \ must support use of\n   HMAC-SHA-1-96 [RFC2104] and should support use of HMAC-SHA-256-128\n\
    \   [RFC6234] (SHA-256 truncated to 128 bits).\n   During experimental and prototype\
    \ deployment, all authentication key\n   configuration will be manual.  Should\
    \ LISP and its components be\n   considered for IETF standardization, further\
    \ work will be required to\n   follow the BCP 107 [RFC4107] recommendations on\
    \ automated key\n   management.\n   As noted in Section 4.2, a Map-Server should\
    \ verify that all\n   EID-Prefixes registered by an ETR match the configuration\
    \ stored on\n   the Map-Server.\n   The currently defined authentication mechanism\
    \ for Map-Register\n   messages does not provide protection against \"replay\"\
    \ attacks by a\n   \"man-in-the-middle\".  Additional work is needed in this area.\n\
    \   [LISP-SEC] defines a proposed mechanism for providing origin\n   authentication,\
    \ integrity, anti-replay protection, and prevention of\n   man-in-the-middle and\
    \ \"overclaiming\" attacks on the Map-Request/\n   Map-Reply exchange.  Work is\
    \ ongoing on this and other proposals for\n   resolving these open security issues.\n\
    \   While beyond the scope of securing an individual Map-Server or\n   Map-Resolver,\
    \ it should be noted that a BGP-based LISP+ALT network\n   (if ALT is used as\
    \ the mapping database infrastructure) can take\n   advantage of standards work\
    \ on adding security to BGP.\n"
