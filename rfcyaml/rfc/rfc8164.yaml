- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a use of HTTP Alternative Services\
    \ [RFC7838]\n   to decouple the URI scheme from the use and configuration of\n\
    \   underlying encryption.  It allows an \"http\" URI [RFC7230] to be\n   accessed\
    \ using HTTP/2 and Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246]\n   with Opportunistic\
    \ Security [RFC7435].\n   This document describes a usage model whereby sites\
    \ can serve \"http\"\n   URIs over TLS, thereby avoiding the problem of serving\
    \ Mixed Content\n   (described in [W3C.CR-mixed-content-20160802]) while still\
    \ providing\n   protection against passive attacks.\n   Opportunistic Security\
    \ does not provide the same guarantees as using\n   TLS with \"https\" URIs, because\
    \ it is vulnerable to active attacks,\n   and does not change the security context\
    \ of the connection.\n   Normally, users will not be able to tell that it is in\
    \ use (i.e.,\n   there will be no \"lock icon\").\n"
- title: 1.1.  Goals and Non-goals
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Goals and Non-goals\n   The immediate goal is to make the use of HTTP more\
    \ robust in the face\n   of pervasive passive monitoring [RFC7258].\n   A secondary\
    \ (but significant) goal is to provide for ease of\n   implementation, deployment,\
    \ and operation.  This mechanism is\n   expected to have a minimal impact upon\
    \ performance and require\n   trivial administrative effort to configure.\n  \
    \ Preventing active attacks (such as man-in-the-middle attacks) is a\n   non-goal\
    \ for this specification.  Furthermore, this specification is\n   not intended\
    \ to replace or offer an alternative to \"https\", since\n   \"https\" both prevents\
    \ active attacks and invokes a more stringent\n   security model in most clients.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Using HTTP URIs over TLS
  contents:
  - "2.  Using HTTP URIs over TLS\n   An origin server that supports the resolution\
    \ of \"http\" URIs can\n   indicate support for this specification by providing\
    \ an alternative\n   service advertisement [RFC7838] for a protocol identifier\
    \ that uses\n   TLS, such as \"h2\" [RFC7540].  Such a protocol MUST include an\n\
    \   explicit indication of the scheme of the resource.  This excludes\n   HTTP/1.1;\
    \ HTTP/1.1 clients are forbidden from including the absolute\n   form of a URI\
    \ in requests to origin servers (see Section 5.3.1 of\n   [RFC7230]).\n   A client\
    \ that receives such an advertisement MAY make future requests\n   intended for\
    \ the associated origin [RFC6454] to the identified\n   service (as specified\
    \ by [RFC7838]), provided that the alternative\n   service opts in as described\
    \ in Section 2.1.\n   A client that places the importance of protection against\
    \ passive\n   attacks over performance might choose to withhold requests until\
    \ an\n   encrypted connection is available.  However, if such a connection\n \
    \  cannot be successfully established, the client can resume its use of\n   the\
    \ cleartext connection.\n   A client can also explicitly probe for an alternative\
    \ service\n   advertisement by sending a request that bears little or no sensitive\n\
    \   information, such as one with the OPTIONS method.  Likewise, clients\n   with\
    \ existing alternative services information could make such a\n   request before\
    \ they expire, in order minimize the delays that might\n   be incurred.\n   Client\
    \ certificates are not meaningful for URLs with the \"http\"\n   scheme; therefore,\
    \ clients creating new TLS connections to\n   alternative services for the purposes\
    \ of this specification MUST NOT\n   present them.  A server that also provides\
    \ \"https\" resources on the\n   same port can request a certificate during the\
    \ TLS handshake, but it\n   MUST NOT abort the handshake if the client does not\
    \ provide one.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Alternative Server Opt-In
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Alternative Server Opt-In\n   For various reasons, it is possible that\
    \ the server might become\n   confused about whether requests' URLs have an \"\
    http\" or \"https\"\n   scheme (see Section 4.4).  To ensure that the alternative\
    \ service has\n   opted into serving \"http\" URLs over TLS, clients are required\
    \ to\n   perform additional checks before directing \"http\" requests to it.\n\
    \   Clients MUST NOT send \"http\" requests over a secured connection,\n   unless\
    \ the chosen alternative service presents a certificate that is\n   valid for\
    \ the origin as defined in [RFC2818].  Using an authenticated\n   alternative\
    \ service establishes \"reasonable assurances\" for the\n   purposes of [RFC7838].\
    \  In addition to authenticating the server, the\n   client MUST have obtained\
    \ a valid \"http-opportunistic\" response for\n   an origin (as per Section 2.3)\
    \ using the authenticated connection.\n   An exception to the latter restriction\
    \ is made for requests for the\n   \"http-opportunistic\" well-known URI.\n  \
    \ For example, assuming the following request is made over a TLS\n   connection\
    \ that is successfully authenticated for those origins, the\n   following request/response\
    \ pair would allow requests for the origins\n   \"http://www.example.com\" or\
    \ \"http://example.com\" to be sent using a\n   secured connection:\n   HEADERS\n\
    \     + END_STREAM\n     + END_HEADERS\n       :method = GET\n       :scheme =\
    \ http\n       :authority = example.com\n       :path = /.well-known/http-opportunistic\n\
    \   HEADERS\n       :status = 200\n       content-type = application/json\n  \
    \ DATA\n     + END_STREAM\n   [ \"http://www.example.com\", \"http://example.com\"\
    \ ]\n   This document describes multiple origins, but only for operational\n \
    \  convenience.  Only a request made to an origin (over an authenticated\n   connection)\
    \ can be used to acquire the \"http-opportunistic\" resource\n   for that origin.\
    \  Thus, in the example, the request to\n   \"http://example.com\" cannot be assumed\
    \ to also provide a\n   representation of the \"http-opportunistic\" resource\
    \ for\n   \"http://www.example.com\".\n"
- title: 2.2.  Interaction with "https" URIs
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Interaction with \"https\" URIs\n   Clients MUST NOT send \"http\" and\
    \ \"https\" requests on the same\n   connection.  Similarly, clients MUST NOT\
    \ send \"http\" requests for\n   multiple origins on the same connection.\n"
- title: 2.3.  The "http-opportunistic" Well-Known URI
  contents:
  - "2.3.  The \"http-opportunistic\" Well-Known URI\n   This specification defines\
    \ the \"http-opportunistic\" well-known URI\n   [RFC5785].  A client is said to\
    \ have a valid \"http-opportunistic\"\n   response for a given origin when:\n\
    \   o  The client has requested the well-known URI from the origin over\n    \
    \  an authenticated connection and a 200 (OK) response was provided,\n   o  That\
    \ response is fresh [RFC7234] (potentially through revalidation\n      [RFC7232]),\n\
    \   o  That response has the media type \"application/json\",\n   o  That response's\
    \ payload, when parsed as JSON [RFC7159], contains\n      an array as the root,\
    \ and\n   o  The array contains a string that is a case-insensitive, character-\n\
    \      for-character match for the origin in question, serialized into\n     \
    \ Unicode as per Section 6.1 of [RFC6454].\n   A client MAY treat an \"http-opportunistic\"\
    \ resource as invalid if\n   values it contains are not strings.\n   This document\
    \ does not define semantics for \"http-opportunistic\"\n   resources on an \"\
    https\" origin, nor does it define semantics if the\n   resource includes \"https\"\
    \ origins.\n   Allowing clients to cache the \"http-opportunistic\" resource means\n\
    \   that all alternative services need to be able to respond to requests\n   for\
    \ \"http\" resources.  A client is permitted to use an alternative\n   service\
    \ without acquiring the \"http-opportunistic\" resource from that\n   service.\n\
    \   A client MUST NOT use any cached copies of an \"http-opportunistic\"\n   resource\
    \ that was acquired (or revalidated) over an unauthenticated\n   connection. \
    \ To avoid potential errors, a client can request or\n   revalidate the \"http-opportunistic\"\
    \ resource before using any\n   connection to an alternative service.\n   Clients\
    \ that use cached \"http-opportunistic\" responses MUST ensure\n   that their\
    \ cache is cleared of any responses that were acquired over\n   an unauthenticated\
    \ connection.  Revalidating an unauthenticated\n   response using an authenticated\
    \ connection does not ensure the\n   integrity of the response.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Security Indicators\n   User agents MUST NOT provide any special security\
    \ indicators when an\n   \"http\" resource is acquired using TLS.  In particular,\
    \ indicators\n   that might suggest the same level of security as \"https\" MUST\
    \ NOT be\n   used (e.g., a \"lock device\").\n"
- title: 4.2.  Downgrade Attacks
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Downgrade Attacks\n   A downgrade attack against the negotiation for TLS\
    \ is possible.\n   For example, because the \"Alt-Svc\" header field [RFC7838]\
    \ likely\n   appears in an unauthenticated and unencrypted channel, it is subject\n\
    \   to downgrade by network attackers.  In its simplest form, an attacker\n  \
    \ that wants the connection to remain in the clear need only strip the\n   \"\
    Alt-Svc\" header field from responses.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Privacy Considerations\n   Cached alternative services can be used to track\
    \ clients over time,\n   e.g., using a user-specific hostname.  Clearing the cache\
    \ reduces the\n   ability of servers to track clients; therefore, clients MUST\
    \ clear\n   cached alternative service information when clearing other origin-\n\
    \   based state (i.e., cookies).\n"
- title: 4.4.  Confusion regarding Request Scheme
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Confusion regarding Request Scheme\n   HTTP implementations and applications\
    \ sometimes use ambient signals\n   to determine if a request is for an \"https\"\
    \ resource; for example,\n   they might look for TLS on the stack or a server\
    \ port number of 443.\n   This might be due to expected limitations in the protocol\
    \ (the most\n   common HTTP/1.1 request form does not carry an explicit indication\
    \ of\n   the URI scheme, and the resource might have been developed assuming\n\
    \   HTTP/1.1), or it may be because of how the server and application are\n  \
    \ implemented (often, they are two separate entities, with a variety of\n   possible\
    \ interfaces between them).\n   Any security decisions based upon this information\
    \ could be misled by\n   the deployment of this specification, because it violates\
    \ the\n   assumption that the use of TLS (or port 443) means that the client is\n\
    \   accessing an HTTPS URI and operating in the security context implied\n   by\
    \ HTTPS.\n   Therefore, server implementers and administrators need to carefully\n\
    \   examine the use of such signals before deploying this specification.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Server Controls
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Server Controls\n   This specification requires that a server send both\
    \ an alternative\n   service advertisement and host content in a well-known location\
    \ to\n   send HTTP requests over TLS.  Servers SHOULD take suitable measures\n\
    \   to ensure that the content of the well-known resource remains under\n   their\
    \ control.  Likewise, because the \"Alt-Svc\" header field is used\n   to describe\
    \ policies across an entire origin, servers SHOULD NOT\n   permit user content\
    \ to set or modify the value of this header.\n"
