  - "Abstract\n   The original RFCs that specified the Remote Direct Data Placement\n
    \  (RDDP) protocol suite did not create IANA registries for RDDP error\n   codes,
    operation codes, and function codes.  Extensions to the RDDP\n   protocols now
    require these registries to be created.  This memo\n   creates the RDDP registries,
    populates them with values defined in\n   the original RDDP RFCs, and provides
    guidance to IANA for future\n   assignment of code points within these registries.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The original RFCs that specified the RDDP protocol suite
    [RFC5040]\n   [RFC5041] [RFC5043] [RFC5044] did not create IANA registries.\n
    \  Extensions to the RDDP protocols [RFC6581] [RMP-EXT] now require\n   creation
    and use of IANA registries.  This memo creates the RDDP-\n   related IANA registries,
    specifies their initial contents based on\n   the values defined in the original
    RDDP RFCs, and provides guidance\n   to IANA for future assignments from these
    registries.  In addition,\n   this memo allocates operation code and function
    code points for\n   experimental use [RFC3692].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   Since this document is only concerned with creation
    and IANA\n   management of RDDP registries, it raises no new security issues.\n
    \  However, a few words are necessary about the use of the experimental\n   code
    points defined in Sections 3.4 and 3.5.  Potentially harmful\n   side effects
    from the use of the experimental values need to be\n   carefully evaluated before
    deploying any experiment across networks\n   that the owner of the experiment
    does not entirely control.  Guidance\n   given in [RFC3692] about the use of experimental
    values needs to be\n   followed.\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   Allocation requests for the registries created by
    this memo may come\n   with a suggested numerical value or values that should
    be assigned.\n   Such suggestions are useful when early implementations have already\n
    \  chosen particular code points before the final RFC is published.  If\n   the
    allocation request in general is accepted, such suggestions may\n   be honored
    if the suggested value is still free to be assigned.\n   This memo creates the
    following RDDP registries for IANA to manage:\n      o RDMAP Errors (Section 3.1)\n
    \     o DDP Errors (Section 3.2)\n      o MPA Errors (Section 3.3)\n      o RDMAP
    Message Operation Codes (Section 3.4)\n      o SCTP Function Codes for DDP Stream
    Session Control (Section 3.5)\n   Each of the following sections specifies a registry,
    its initial\n   contents, and the allocation policy in more detail.\n"
