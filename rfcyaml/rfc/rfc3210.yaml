  - "1.0 Introduction\n   Service providers and users have indicated that there is\
    \ a great need\n   for traffic engineering capabilities in IP networks.  These\
    \ traffic\n   engineering capabilities can be based on Multiprotocol Label\n \
    \  Switching (MPLS) and can be implemented on label switching routers\n   (LSRs)\
    \ from different vendors that interoperate using a common\n   signaling and label\
    \ distribution protocol.  A description of the\n   requirements for traffic engineering\
    \ in MPLS based IP networks can be\n   found in [2].  There is, therefore, a requirement\
    \ for an open, non-\n   proprietary, standards based signaling and label distribution\n\
    \   protocol for the MPLS traffic engineering application that will allow\n  \
    \ label switching routers from different vendors to interoperate.\n   The \"Extensions\
    \ to RSVP for LSP tunnels\" (RSVP-TE) specification [1]\n   was developed by the\
    \ IETF MPLS working group to address this\n   requirement.  RSVP-TE is a composition\
    \ of several related proposals\n   submitted to the IETF MPLS working group. \
    \ It contains all the\n   necessary objects, packet formats, and procedures required\
    \ to\n   establish and maintain explicit label switched paths (LSPs).\n   Explicit\
    \ LSPs are foundational to the traffic engineering application\n   in MPLS based\
    \ IP networks.  Besides the traffic engineering\n   application, the RSVP-TE specification\
    \ may have other uses within the\n   Internet.\n   This memo describes the applicability\
    \ of the RSVP-TE specifications\n   [1].  The protocol's principles of operation\
    \ are highlighted, the\n   network context for which it was developed is described,\
    \ guidelines\n   for deployment are offered, and known protocol limitations are\n\
    \   indicated.\n   This applicability statement concerns only the use of RSVP\
    \ to set up\n   unicast LSP-tunnels.  It is noted that not all of the features\n\
    \   described in RFC2205 [3] are required to support the instantiation\n   and\
    \ maintenance of LSP-tunnels.  Aspects related to the support of\n   other features\
    \ and capabilities of RSVP by an implementation that\n   also supports LSP-tunnels\
    \ are beyond the scope of this document.\n   However, support of such additional\
    \ features and capabilities should\n   not introduce new security vulnerabilities\
    \ in environments that only\n   use RSVP to set up LSP-tunnels.\n   This applicability\
    \ statement does not preclude the use of other\n   signaling and label distribution\
    \ protocols for the traffic\n   engineering application in MPLS based networks.\
    \  Service providers\n   are free to deploy whatever signaling protocol that meets\
    \ their\n   needs.\n   In particular, CR-LDP [6] and RSVP-TE [1] are two signaling\
    \ protocols\n   that perform similar functions in MPLS networks.  There is currently\n\
    \   no consensus on which protocol is technically superior.  Therefore,\n   network\
    \ administrators should make a choice between the two based\n   upon their needs\
    \ and particular situation.\n"

  - "2.0 Technical Overview of Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels\n   The RSVP-TE\
    \ specification extends the original RSVP protocol by\n   giving it new capabilities\
    \ that support the following functions in an\n   MPLS domain:\n     (1) downstream-on-demand\
    \ label distribution\n     (2) instantiation of explicit label switched paths\n\
    \     (3) allocation of network resources (e.g., bandwidth) to\n         explicit\
    \ LSPs\n     (4) rerouting of established LSP-tunnels in a smooth fashion\n  \
    \       using the concept of make-before-break\n     (5) tracking of the actual\
    \ route traversed by an LSP-tunnel\n     (6) diagnostics on LSP-tunnels\n    \
    \ (7) the concept of nodal abstraction\n     (8) preemption options that are administratively\
    \ controllable\n   The RSVP-TE specification introduces several new RSVP objects,\n\
    \   including the LABEL-REQUEST object, the RECORD-ROUTE object, the\n   LABEL\
    \ object, the EXPLICIT-ROUTE object, and new SESSION objects.\n   New error messages\
    \ are defined to provide notification of exception\n   conditions.  All of the\
    \ new objects defined in RSVP-TE are optional\n   with respect to the RSVP protocol,\
    \ except the LABEL-REQUEST and LABEL\n   objects, which are both mandatory for\
    \ the establishment of LSP-\n   tunnels.\n   Two fundamental aspects distinguish\
    \ the RSVP-TE specification [1]\n   from the original RSVP protocol [3].\n   The\
    \ first distinguishing aspect is the fact that the RSVP-TE\n   specification [1]\
    \ is intended for use by label switching routers (as\n   well as hosts) to establish\
    \ and maintain LSP-tunnels and to reserve\n   network resources for such LSP-tunnels.\
    \  The original RSVP\n   specification [3], on the other hand, was intended for\
    \ use by hosts\n   to request and reserve network resources for micro-flows.\n\
    \   The second distinguishing aspect is the fact that the RSVP-TE\n   specification\
    \ generalizes the concept of \"RSVP flow.\" The RSVP-TE\n   specification essentially\
    \ allows an RSVP session to consist of an\n   arbitrary aggregation of traffic\
    \ (based on local policies) between\n   the originating node of an LSP-tunnel\
    \ and the egress node of the\n   tunnel.  To be definite, in the original RSVP\
    \ protocol [3], a session\n   was defined as a data flow with a particular destination\
    \ and\n   transport layer protocol.  In the RSVP-TE specification, however, a\n\
    \   session is implicitly defined as the set of packets that are assigned\n  \
    \ the same MPLS label value at the originating node of an LSP-tunnel.\n   The\
    \ assignment of labels to packets can be based on various criteria,\n   and may\
    \ even encompass all packets (or subsets thereof) between the\n   endpoints of\
    \ the LSP-tunnel.  Because traffic is aggregated, the\n   number of LSP-tunnels\
    \ (hence the number of RSVP sessions) does not\n   increase proportionally with\
    \ the number of flows in the network.\n   Therefore, the RSVP-TE specification\
    \ [1] addresses a major scaling\n   issue with the original RSVP protocol [3],\
    \ namely the large amount of\n   system resources that would otherwise be required\
    \ to manage\n   reservations and maintain state for potentially thousands or even\n\
    \   millions of RSVP sessions at the micro-flow granularity.\n   The reader is\
    \ referred to [1] for a technical description of the\n   RSVP-TE protocol specification.\n"
- title: 3.0 Applicability of Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels
  contents:
  - "3.0 Applicability of Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels\n   Use of RSVP-TE is\
    \ appropriate in contexts where it is useful to\n   establish and maintain explicit\
    \ label switched paths in an MPLS\n   network.  LSP-tunnels may be instantiated\
    \ for measurement purposes\n   and/or for routing control purposes.  They may\
    \ also be instantiated\n   for other administrative reasons.\n   For the measurement\
    \ application, an LSP-tunnel can be used to capture\n   various path statistics\
    \ between its endpoints.  This can be\n   accomplished by associating various\
    \ performance management and fault\n   management functions with an LSP-tunnel,\
    \ such as packet and byte\n   counters.  For example, an LSP-tunnel can be instantiated,\
    \ with or\n   without bandwidth allocation, solely for the purpose of monitoring\n\
    \   traffic flow statistics between two label switching routers.\n   For the routing\
    \ control application, LSP-tunnels can be used to\n   forward subsets of traffic\
    \ through paths that are independent of\n   routes computed by conventional Interior\
    \ Gateway Protocol (IGP)\n   Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithms.  This feature\
    \ introduces\n   significant flexibility into the routing function and allows\
    \ policies\n   to be implemented that can result in the performance optimization\
    \ of\n   operational networks.  For example, using LSP-tunnels, traffic can be\n\
    \   routed away from congested network resources onto relatively\n   underutilized\
    \ ones.  More generally, load balancing policies can be\n   actualized that increase\
    \ the effective capacity of the network.\n   To further enhance the control application,\
    \ RSVP-TE may be augmented\n   with an ancillary constraint-based routing entity.\
    \  This entity may\n   compute explicit routes based on certain traffic attributes,\
    \ while\n   taking network constraints into account.  Additionally, IGP link\n\
    \   state advertisements may be extended to propagate new topology state\n   information.\
    \  This information can be used by the constraint-based\n   routing entity to\
    \ compute feasible routes.  Furthermore, the IGP\n   routing algorithm may itself\
    \ be enhanced to take pre-established\n   LSP-tunnels into consideration while\
    \ building the routing table.  All\n   these augmentations are useful, but not\
    \ mandatory.  In fact, the\n   RSVP-TE specification may be deployed in certain\
    \ contexts without any\n   of these additional components.\n   The capability\
    \ to monitor point to point traffic statistics between\n   two routers and the\
    \ capability to control the forwarding paths of\n   subsets of traffic through\
    \ a given network topology together make the\n   RSVP-TE specifications applicable\
    \ and useful for traffic engineering\n   within service provider networks.\n \
    \  These capabilities also make the RSVP-TE applicable, in some\n   contexts,\
    \ as a component of an MPLS based VPN provisioning framework.\n   It is significant\
    \ that the MPLS architecture [4] states clearly that\n   no single label distribution\
    \ protocol is assumed for the MPLS\n   technology.  Therefore, as noted in the\
    \ introduction, this\n   applicability statement does not (and should not be construed\
    \ to)\n   prevent a label switching router from implementing other signaling\n\
    \   and label distribution protocols that also support establishment of\n   explicit\
    \ LSPs and traffic engineering in MPLS networks.\n"
- title: 4.0 Deployment and Policy Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.0 Deployment and Policy Considerations\n   When deploying RSVP-TE, there should\
    \ be well defined administrative\n   policies governing the selection of nodes\
    \ that will serve as\n   endpoints for LSP-tunnels.  Furthermore, when devising\
    \ a virtual\n   topology for LSP-tunnels, special consideration should be given\
    \ to\n   the tradeoff between the operational complexity associated with a\n \
    \  large number of LSP-tunnels and the control granularity that large\n   numbers\
    \ of LSP-tunnels allow.  Stated otherwise, a large number of\n   LSP-tunnels allows\
    \ greater control over the distribution of traffic\n   across the network, but\
    \ increases network operational complexity.  In\n   large networks, it may be\
    \ advisable to start with a simple LSP-tunnel\n   virtual topology and then introduce\
    \ additional complexity based on\n   observed or anticipated traffic flow patterns.\n\
    \   Administrative policies may also guide the amount of bandwidth to be\n   allocated\
    \ (if any) to each LSP-tunnel.  Policies of this type may\n   take into consideration\
    \ empirical traffic statistics derived from the\n   operational network in addition\
    \ to other factors.\n"
- title: 5.0 Limitations
  contents:
  - "5.0 Limitations\n   The RSVP-TE specification supports only unicast LSP-tunnels.\n\
    \   Multicast LSP-tunnels are not supported.\n   The RSVP-TE specification supports\
    \ only unidirectional LSP-tunnels.\n   Bidirectional LSP-tunnels are not supported.\n\
    \   The soft state nature of RSVP remains a source of concern because of\n   the\
    \ need to generate refresh messages periodically to maintain the\n   state of\
    \ established LSP-tunnels.  This issue is addressed in several\n   proposals that\
    \ have been submitted to the RSVP working group (see\n   e.g. [5]).\n"
- title: 6.0 Conclusion
  contents:
  - "6.0 Conclusion\n   The applicability of the \"Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels\"\
    \n   specification has been discussed in this document.  The specification\n \
    \  introduced several enhancements to the RSVP protocol, which make it\n   applicable\
    \ in contexts in which the original RSVP protocol would have\n   been inappropriate.\
    \  One context in which the RSVP-TE specification\n   is particularly applicable\
    \ is in traffic engineering in MPLS based IP\n   networks.\n"
- title: 7.0 Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.0 Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce new security\
    \ issues.  The RSVP-TE\n   specification adds new opaque objects to RSVP.  Therefore,\
    \ the\n   security considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol\n \
    \  remain relevant.  When deployed in service provider networks, it is\n   mandatory\
    \ to ensure that only authorized entities are permitted to\n   initiate establishment\
    \ of LSP-tunnels.\n"
