    \   \"Padding\" option, which allows DNS clients and servers to\n   artificially\
    \ increase the size of a DNS message by a variable number\n   of bytes, hampering\

- title: 3.  General Guidance
  contents:
  - "3.  General Guidance\n   EDNS(0) options space: The maximum message length, as\
    \ dictated by the\n   protocol, limits the space for EDNS(0) options.  Since padding\
    \ will\n   reduce the message space available to other EDNS(0) options, the\n\
    \   \"Padding\" option MUST be the last EDNS(0) option applied before a DNS\n\
    \   message is sent.\n   Resource Conservation: Especially in situations where\
    \ networking and\n   processing resources are scarce (e.g., battery-powered long-life\n\
    \   devices, low bandwidth, or high-cost links), the trade-off between\n   increased\
    \ size of padded DNS messages and the corresponding gain in\n   confidentiality\
    \ must be carefully considered.\n   Transport Protocol Independence: The message\
    \ size used as input to\n   the various padding strategies MUST be calculated\
    \ excluding the\n   potential extra 2-octet length field used in TCP transport.\n\
    \   Otherwise, the padded (observable) size of the DNS packets could\n   significantly\
    \ change between different transport protocols and reveal\n   an indication of\
    \ the original (unpadded) length.  For example, given\n   a Block-Length Padding\
    \ strategy with a block length of 32 octets and\n   a DNS message with a size\
    \ of 59 octets, the message would be padded\n   to 64 octets when transported\
    \ over UDP.  If that same message were\n   transported over TCP and the padding\
    \ strategy considered the extra 2\n   octets of the length field (61 octets in\
    \ total), the padded message\n   would be 96 octets long (as the minimum length\
    \ of the \"Padding\"\n   option is 4 octets).\n"

  - "4.  Padding Strategies\n   This section contains a recommended strategy, as well\
    \ as a\n   non-exhaustive list of other sensible strategies, for choosing\n  \
    \ padding length.  Note that, for completeness, Appendix A contains two\n   more\
    \ strategies that are not sensible.\n"
- title: '4.1.  Recommended Strategy: Block-Length Padding'
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Recommended Strategy: Block-Length Padding\n   Based on empirical research\
    \ performed by Daniel K. Gillmor\n   [NDSS-PADDING], padding SHOULD be performed\
    \ following the Block-\n   Length Padding strategy as follows:\n   (1)  Clients\
    \ SHOULD pad queries to the closest multiple of 128\n        octets.\n   (2) \
    \ If a server receives a query that includes the EDNS(0) \"Padding\"\n       \
    \ option, it MUST pad the corresponding response (see Section 4 of\n        RFC\
    \ 7830) and SHOULD pad the corresponding response to a\n        multiple of 468\
    \ octets (see below).\n   Note that the recommendation above only applies if the\
    \ DNS transport\n   is encrypted (see Section 6 of RFC 7830).\n   In Block-Length\
    \ Padding, a sender pads each message so that its\n   padded length is a multiple\
    \ of a chosen block length.  This creates a\n   greatly reduced variety of message\
    \ lengths.  An implementor needs to\n   consider that even the zero-length \"\
    Padding\" option increases the\n   length of the packet by 4 octets.\n   Options:\
    \ Block length.  For queries, values between 16 and 128 octets\n   were discussed\
    \ before empiric research was performed.  Responses will\n   require larger block\
    \ sizes (see [NDSS-PADDING] and above for a\n   discussion).\n   Very large block\
    \ lengths will have confidentiality properties similar\n   to the Maximal-Length\
    \ Padding strategy (Section 4.2.1), since almost\n   all messages will fit into\
    \ a single block.  Such \"very large block\n   length\" values are:\n   o  288\
    \ bytes for the query (the maximum size of a one-question query\n      over TCP,\
    \ without any EDNS(0) options) and\n   o  the EDNS(0) buffer size of the server\
    \ for the responses.\n   Advantages: This policy is reasonably easy to implement,\
    \ reduces the\n   variety of message (\"fingerprint\") sizes significantly, and\
    \ does not\n   require a source of (pseudo) random numbers, since the padding\
    \ length\n   required can be derived from the actual (unpadded) message.\n   Disadvantage:\
    \ Given an unpadded message and the block size of the\n   padding (which is assumed\
    \ to be public knowledge once a server is\n   reachable), the size range of a\
    \ padded message can be predicted.\n   Therefore, the minimum length of the unpadded\
    \ message can be\n   inferred.\n   The empirical research cited above performed\
    \ a simulation of padding,\n   based on real-world DNS traffic captured on busy\
    \ recursive resolvers\n   of a research network.  The evaluation of the performance\
    \ of\n   individual padding policies was based on a \"cost to attacker\" and\n\
    \   \"cost to defender\" function, where the \"cost to attacker\" was defined\n\
    \   as the percentage of query/response pairs falling into the same size\n   bucket\
    \ and \"cost to defender\" was defined as the size factor between\n   padded and\
    \ unpadded messages.  Padding with a block size of 128 bytes\n   on the query\
    \ side and 468 bytes on the response side was considered\n   the optimum trade-off\
    \ between defender and attacker cost.  The\n   response block size of 468 was\
    \ chosen so that 3 blocks of 468 octets\n   would still comfortably fit into typical\
    \ Maximum Transmission Unit\n   (MTU) size values.\n   The block size will interact\
    \ with the MTU size.  Especially for\n   length values that are a large fraction\
    \ of the MTU, unless the block\n   length is chosen so that a multiple just fits\
    \ into the MTU, Block-\n   Length Padding may cause unnecessary fragmentation\
    \ for UDP-based\n   delivery.  Of course, choosing a block length larger than\
    \ the MTU\n   always forces fragmentation.\n   Note: Once DNSSEC-validating clients\
    \ become more prevalent, observed\n   size patterns are expected to change significantly.\
    \  In that case,\n   the recommended strategy might need to be revisited.\n"

- title: 4.2.1.  Maximal-Length Padding
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Maximal-Length Padding\n   In Maximal-Length Padding, the sender pads\
    \ every message to the\n   maximum size allowed by protocol negotiations.\n  \
    \ Advantages: Maximal-Length Padding, when combined with encrypted\n   transport,\
    \ provides the highest possible level of message-size\n   confidentiality.\n \
    \  Disadvantages: Maximal-Length Padding is wasteful and requires\n   resources\
    \ on the client, all intervening networks and equipment, and\n   the server. \
    \ Depending on the negotiated size, this strategy will\n   commonly exceed the\
    \ MTU and result in a consistent number of\n   fragments, reducing delivery probability\
    \ when datagram-based\n   transport (such as UDP) is used.\n   Due to resource\
    \ consumption, Maximal-Length Padding is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  Random-Length Padding
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Random-Length Padding\n   When using Random-Length Padding, a sender\
    \ pads each message with a\n   random amount of padding.  Due to the size of the\
    \ \"Padding\" option\n   itself, each message size is increased by at least 4\
    \ octets.  The\n   upper limit for padding is the maximum message size.  However,\
    \ a\n   client or server may choose to impose a lower maximum padding length.\n\
    \   Options: Maximum and minimum padding length.\n   Advantages: Theoretically,\
    \ this policy should create a natural\n   distribution of message sizes.\n   Disadvantage:\
    \ Random-Length Padding allows an attacker who can\n   observe a large number\
    \ of requests to infer the length of the\n   original value by observing the distribution\
    \ of total lengths.\n   According to the limited empirical data available, Random-Length\n\
    \   Padding exposes slightly more entropy to an attacker than Block-\n   Length\
    \ Padding.  Because of that, and the risk outlined above,\n   Random-Length Padding\
    \ is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  Random-Block-Length Padding
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Random-Block-Length Padding\n   This policy combines Block-Length Padding\
    \ with a random component.\n   Specifically, a sender randomly chooses between\
    \ a few block length\n   values and then applies Block-Length Padding based on\
    \ the chosen\n   block length.  The random selection of block length might even\
    \ be\n   reasonably based on a \"weak\" source of randomness, such as the\n  \
    \ transaction ID of the message.\n   Options: Number of and the values for the\
    \ set of block lengths;\n   source of randomness\n   Advantages: Compared to Block-Length\
    \ Padding, this creates more\n   variety in the resulting message sizes for a\
    \ certain individual\n   original message length.\n   Disadvantage: Requires more\
    \ implementation effort compared to simple\n   Block-Length Padding.\n   Random-Block-Length\
    \ Padding requires further empirical study, as do\n   other combinations of padding\
    \ strategies.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The choice of the right padding policy (and the\
    \ right parameters for\n   the chosen policy) has a significant impact on the\
    \ resilience of\n   encrypted DNS against size-based correlation attacks.  Therefore,\
    \ any\n   implementor of the \"Padding\" option must carefully consider which\n\
    \   policies to implement, the default policy chosen, which parameters to\n  \
    \ make configurable, and the default parameter values.\n   No matter how carefully\
    \ a client selects their padding policy, this\n   effort can be jeopardized if\
    \ the server chooses to apply an\n   ineffective padding policy to the corresponding\
    \ response packets.\n   Therefore, a client applying the \"Padding\" option may\
    \ want to choose\n   a DNS server that applies a padding policy on responses that\
    \ is at\n   least equally effective.\n   Note that even with encryption and padding,\
    \ it might be trivial to\n   identify that the observed traffic is DNS.  Also,\
    \ padding does not\n   prevent information leaks via other side channels (particularly\n\
    \   timing information and number of query/response pairs).\n   Countermeasures\
    \ against such side channels could include injecting\n   artificial \"cover traffic\"\
    \ into the stream of DNS messages or\n   delaying DNS responses by a certain amount\
    \ of jitter.  Such\n   strategies are out of the scope of this document.  Additionally,\n\
    \   there is not enough theoretic analysis or experimental data available\n  \
    \ to recommend any such countermeasures.\n"

- title: A.1.  No Padding
  contents:
  - "A.1.  No Padding\n   In the No Padding policy, the \"Padding\" option is not\
    \ used, and the\n   size of the final (actually, \"non-padded\") message obviously\
    \ exactly\n   matches the size of the unpadded message.  Even though this\n  \
    \ \"non-policy\" seems redundant in this list, its properties must be\n   considered\
    \ for cases in which just one of the parties (client or\n   server) applies padding.\n\
    \   Also, this policy is required when the remaining message size of the\n   unpadded\
    \ message does not allow for the \"Padding\" option to be\n   included -- i.e.,\
    \ there are fewer than 4 octets left.\n   Advantages: This policy requires no\
    \ additional resources on the\n   client, server, and network side.\n   Disadvantages:\
    \ The original size of the message remains unchanged;\n   hence, this approach\
    \ provides no additional confidentiality.\n   The No Padding policy MUST NOT be\

    \ is\n   very easy to implement and at least ensures that the message length\n\
    \   diverges from the length of the original packet (even if only by a\n   fixed\
    \ value).\n   Disadvantage: Obviously, the amount of padding is easily discoverable\n\
    \   from a single unencrypted message or by observing message patterns.\n   When\
    \ a public DNS server applies this policy, the length of the\n   padding hence\
