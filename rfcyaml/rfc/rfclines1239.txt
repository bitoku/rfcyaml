In the past, MIBs have been assigned arcs in the experimental MIB namespace early in their development and then were not assigned arcs in the standard MIB namespace until they reached Full Standard status.
This practice required vendors to revise their implementations when a MIB went from Draft to Full Standard status, even though there was probably no substantive technical change in the definitions.
This practice could also engender operational problems in the field at an undesirably late stage of the standardization process.
It was also observed that this practice could discourage implementation until the Full Standard stage and that this, too, would be undesirable.
So, a preferable practice is to assign arcs in the standard MIB namespace at the earliest phase of standardization and to preserve these assignments as the standard progresses.
