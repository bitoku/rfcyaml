- title: 1 Introduction
  contents:
  - "1 Introduction\n   According to [RFC3056], there are two deployment options for\
    \ a 6to4\n   routing domain, depending on whether or not the domain is using an\n\
    \   IPv6 exterior routing protocol.  If a routing protocol is used, then\n   the\
    \ 6to4 routers acquire routes to all existing IPv6 networks through\n   the combination\
    \ of EGP and IGP.  If no IPv6 exterior routing protocol\n   is used, the 6to4\
    \ routers using a given relay router each have a\n   default IPv6 route pointing\
    \ to the relay router.  This second case is\n   typically used by small networks;\
    \ for these networks, finding and\n   configuring the default route is in practice\
    \ a significant hurdle.\n   In addition, even when the managers of these networks\
    \ find an\n   available route, this route often points to a router on the other\n\
    \   side of the Internet, leading to very poor performance.\n   The operation\
    \ of 6to4 routers requires either that the routers\n   participate in IPv6 inter-domain\
    \ routing, or that the routers be\n   provisioned with a default route.  This\
    \ memo proposes a standard\n   method to define the default route.  It introduces\
    \ the IANA assigned\n   \"6to4 Relay anycast prefix\" from which 6to4 packets\
    \ will be\n   automatically routed to the nearest available router.  It allows\
    \ the\n   managers of the 6to4 relay routers to control the sources authorized\n\
    \   to use their resource.  It makes it easy to set up a large number of\n   6to4\
    \ relay routers, thus enabling scalability.\n"

- title: 3 Model, requirements
  contents:
  - "3 Model, requirements\n   Operation of 6to4 routers in domains that don't run\
    \ an IPv6 EGP\n   requires that these routers be configured with a default route\
    \ to the\n   IPv6 Internet.  This route will be expressed as a 6to4 address. The\n\
    \   packets bound to this route will be encapsulated in IPv4 whose source\n  \
    \ will be an IPv4 address associated to the 6to4 router, and whose\n   destination\
    \ will be the IPv4 address that is extracted from the\n   default route.  We want\
    \ to arrive at a model of operation in which\n   the configuration is automatic.\n\
    \   It should also be easy to set up a large number of 6to4 relay\n   routers,\
    \ in order to cope with the demand.  The discovery of the\n   nearest relay router\
    \ should be automatic; if a router fails, the\n   traffic should be automatically\
    \ redirected to the nearest available\n   router.  The managers of the 6to4 relay\
    \ routers should be able to\n   control the sources authorized to use their resource.\n\
    \   Anycast routing is known to cause operational issues: since the\n   sending\
    \ 6to4 router does not directly identify the specific 6to4\n   relay router to\
    \ which it forwards the packets, it is hard to identify\n   the responsible router\
    \ in case of failure, in particular when the\n   failure is transient or intermittent.\
    \  Anycast solutions must thus\n   include adequate monitoring of the routers\
    \ performing the service, in\n   order to promptly detect and correct failures,\
    \ and also adequate\n   fault isolation procedures, in order to find out the responsible\n\
    \   element when needed, e.g., following a user's complaint.\n"

  contents:

  contents:
  - "4.2 Behavior of 6to4 relay routers\n   The 6to4 relay routers that follow the\
    \ specification of this memo\n   shall advertise the 6to4 anycast prefix, using\
    \ the IGP of their IPv4\n   autonomous system, as if it where a connection to\
    \ an external\n   network.\n   The 6to4 relay routers that advertise the 6to4\
    \ anycast prefix will\n   receive packets bound to the 6to4 anycast address. \
    \ They will relay\n   these packets to the IPv6 Internet, as specified in [RFC3056].\n\
    \   Each 6to4 relay router that advertise the 6to4 anycast prefix MUST\n   also\
    \ provide an equivalent IPv4 unicast address.  Packets sent to\n   that unicast\
    \ address will follow the same processing path as packets\n   sent to the anycast\
    \ address, i.e., be relayed to the IPv6 Internet.\n"
- title: 4.3 Interaction with the EGP
  contents:
  - "4.3 Interaction with the EGP\n   If the managers of an IPv4 autonomous domain\
    \ that includes 6to4 relay\n   routers want to make these routers available to\
    \ neighbor ASes, they\n   will advertise reachability of the 6to4 anycast prefix.\
    \  When this\n   advertisement is done using BGP, the initial AS path must contain\
    \ the\n   AS number of the announcing AS.  The AS path should also include an\n\
    \   indication of the actual router providing the service; there is a\n   suggestion\
    \ to perform this function by documenting the router's\n   equivalent IPv4 address\
    \ in the BGP aggregator attribute of the path;\n   further work is needed on this\
    \ point.\n   The path to the 6to4 anycast prefix may be propagated using standard\n\
    \   EGP procedures.  The whole v6 network will appear to v4 as a single\n   multi-homed\
    \ network, with multiple access points scattered over the\n   whole Internet.\n"
- title: 4.4 Monitoring of the 6to4 relay routers
  contents:
  - "4.4 Monitoring of the 6to4 relay routers\n   Any 6to4 relay router corresponding\
    \ to this specification must\n   include a monitoring function, to check that\
    \ the 6to4 relay function\n   is operational.  The router must stop injecting\
    \ the route leading to\n   the 6to4 anycast prefix immediately if it detects that\
    \ the relay\n   function is not operational.\n   The equivalent IPv4 address may\
    \ be used to check remotely that a\n   specific router is operational, e.g., by\
    \ tunneling a test IPv6 packet\n   through the router's equivalent unicast IPv4\
    \ address.  When a domain\n   deploys several 6to4 relay routers, it is possible\
    \ to build a\n   centralized monitoring function by using the list of equivalent\
    \ IPv4\n   addresses of these routers.\n"
- title: 4.5 Fault isolation
  contents:
  - "4.5 Fault isolation\n   When an error is reported, e.g., by a user, the domain\
    \ manager should\n   be able to find the specific 6to4 relay router that is causing\
    \ the\n   problem.  The first step of fault isolation is to retrieve the\n   equivalent\
    \ unicast IPv4 address of the router used by the user.  If\n   the router is located\
    \ within the domain, this information will have\n   to be retrieved from the IGP\
    \ tables.  If the service is obtained\n   through a peering agreement with another\
    \ domain, the information will\n   be retrieved from the EGP data, e.g., the BGP\
    \ path attributes.\n   The second step is obviously to perform connectivity tests\
    \ using the\n   equivalent unicast IPv4 address.\n"
- title: 5 Discussion of the solution
  contents:
  - "5 Discussion of the solution\n   The initial surfacing of the proposal in the\
    \ NGTRANS working group\n   helped us discover a number of issues, such as scaling\
    \ concerns, the\n   size of the address prefix, the need for an AS number, and\
    \ concerns\n   about risking to stay too long in a transition state.\n"
- title: 5.1 Does it scale ?
  contents:
  - "5.1 Does it scale ?\n   With the proposed scheme, it is easy to first deploy\
    \ a small number\n   of relay routers, which will carry the limited 6to4 traffic\
    \ during\n   the initial phases of IPv6 deployment.  The routes to these routers\n\
    \   will be propagated according to standard peering agreements.\n   As the demand\
    \ for IPv6 increases, we expect that more ISPs will\n   deploy 6to4 relay routers.\
    \  Standard IPv4 routing procedures will\n   direct the traffic to the nearest\
    \ relay router, assuring good\n   performance.\n"
- title: 5.2 Discovery and failover
  contents:
  - "5.2 Discovery and failover\n   The 6to4 routers send packets bound to the v6\
    \ Internet by tunneling\n   them to the 6to4 anycast address.  These packets will\
    \ reach the\n   closest 6to4 relay router provided by their ISP, or by the closest\n\
    \   ISP according to inter-domain routing.\n   The routes to the relay routers\
    \ will be propagated according to\n   standard IPv4 routing rules.  This ensures\
    \ automatic discovery.\n   If a 6to4 relay router somehow breaks, or loses connectivity\
    \ to the\n   v6 Internet, it will cease to advertise reachability of the 6to4\n\
    \   anycast prefix.  At that point, the local IGP will automatically\n   compute\
    \ a route towards the \"next best\" 6to4 relay router.  We expect\n   that adequate\
    \ monitoring tools will be used to guarantee timely\n   discovery of connectivity\
    \ losses.\n"

  - "5.3 Access control\n   Only those ASes that run 6to4 relay routers and are willing\
    \ to\n   provide access to the v6 network announce a path to the 6to4 anycast\n\
    \   prefix.  They can use the existing structure of peering and transit\n   agreements\
    \ to control to whom they are willing to provide service,\n   and possibly to\
    \ charge for the service.\n"
- title: 5.4 Why do we need a large prefix?
  contents:
  - "5.4 Why do we need a large prefix?\n   In theory, a single IP address, a.k.a.\
    \ a /32 prefix, would be\n   sufficient: all IGPs, and even BGP, can carry routes\
    \ that are\n   arbitrarily specific.  In practice, however, such routes are almost\n\
    \   guaranteed not to work.\n   The size of the routing table is of great concern\
    \ for the managers of\n   Internet \"default free\" networks: they don't want\
    \ to waste a routing\n   entry, which is an important resource, for the sole benefit\
    \ of a\n   small number of Internet nodes.  Many have put in place filters that\n\
    \   automatically drop the routes that are too specific; most of these\n   filters\
    \ are expressed as a function of the length of the address\n   prefix, such as\
    \ \"my network will not accept advertisements for a\n   network that is smaller\
    \ than a /24.\" The actual limit may vary from\n   network to network, and also\
    \ over time.\n   It could indeed be argued that using a large network is a waste\
    \ of\n   the precious addressing resource.  However, this is a waste for the\n\
    \   good cause of actually moving to IPv6, i.e., providing a real relief\n   to\
    \ the address exhaustion problem.\n"
- title: 5.5 Do we need a specific AS number?
  contents:
  - "5.5 Do we need a specific AS number?\n   A first version of this memo suggested\
    \ the use of a specific AS\n   number to designate a virtual AS containing all\
    \ the 6to4 relay\n   routers.  The rationale was to facilitate the registration\
    \ of the\n   access point in databases such as the RADB routing registry [RADB].\n\
    \   Further analysis has shown that this was not required for practical\n   operation.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.6 Will this slow down the move to IPv6 ?\n   Some have expressed a concern\
    \ that, while the assignment of an\n   anycast address to 6to4 access routers\
    \ would make life a bit easier,\n   it would also tend to leave things in a transition\
    \ state in\n   perpetuity.  In fact, we believe that the opposite is true.\n \
    \  A condition for easy migration out of the \"tunnelling\" state is that\n  \
    \ it be easy to have connectivity to the \"real\" IPv6 network; this\n   means\

- title: 6 Future Work
  contents:
  - "6 Future Work\n   Using a default route to reach the IPv6 Internet has a potential\n\
    \   drawback: the chosen relay may not be on the most direct path to the\n   target\
    \ v6 address.  In fact, one might argue that, in the early phase\n   of deployment,\
    \ a relay close to the 6to4 site would probably not be\n   the site's ISP or the\
    \ native destination's ISP...it would probably be\n   some third party ISP's relay\
    \ which would be used for transit and may\n   have lousy connectivity.  Using\
    \ the relay closest to the native\n   destination would more closely match the\
    \ v4 route, and quite possibly\n   provide a higher degree of reliability.  A\
    \ potential way to deal with\n   this issue is to use a \"redirection\" procedure,\
    \ by which the 6to4\n   router learns the most appropriate route for a specific\
    \ destination.\n   This is left for further study.\n   The practical operation\
    \ of the 6to4 relay routers requires the\n   development of monitoring and testing\
    \ tools, and the elaboration of\n   gradual management practices.  While this\
    \ document provides general\n   guidelines for the design of tools and practice,\
    \ we expect that the\n   actual deployment will be guided by operational experience.\n"
