- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)\
    \ is an\n   organization whose objectives include the educational and technical\n\
    \   advancement of electrical and electronic engineering,\n   telecommunications,\
    \ computer engineering, and allied disciplines.\n   Within IEEE, standardization\
    \ activities are organized into sponsors,\n   such as the LAN/MAN Standards Committee,\
    \ and then working groups such\n   as 802.1 and 802.3.  See <http://standards.ieee.org>.\n\
    \   As part of these specification efforts, there is a need to maintain\n   identifiers\
    \ in a managed namespace that is unique and persistent.  To\n   ensure that this\
    \ namespace's uniqueness is absolute, a registration\n   of a specific URN Syntax\
    \ [RFC2141] Namespace Identifier (NID) for use\n   by IEEE is specified in this\
    \ document, in full conformance with the\n   NID registration process specified\
    \ in URN Namespace Definition\n   Mechanisms [RFC3406].\n"

    \ 2016-12-05\n   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n    Registering organization:\n\
    \      Name:\n        Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n    \

    \ IEEE Registration Authority\n        Email: ieee-registration-authority@ieee.org\n\
    \   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n      The Namespace Specific String (NSS)\
    \ of all URNs that use the IEEE\n      NID will have the following structure:\n\
    \        urn:ieee:{IEEEresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}\n      where \"IEEEresource\"\
    \ is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN\n      syntax requirements [RFC2141]\
    \ and defines a specific class of\n      resource type.  Each resource type has\
    \ a specific labeling scheme\n      that is covered by \"ResourceSpecificString\"\
    , which also conforms\n      to the naming requirements [RFC2141].\n      IEEE\
    \ maintains a registration authority, the IEEE Registration\n      Authority (IEEE\
    \ RA), that will manage the assignment of\n      \"IEEEresource\" and the specific\
    \ registration values assigned for\n      each resource class.\n   Relevant ancillary\
    \ documentation:\n      The IEEE Registration Authority (IEEE RA) provides information\
    \ on\n      the registered resources and the registrations for each.  More\n \
    \     information about this registry and the procedures to be followed\n    \
    \  are available at:\n      http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/ieeeurn.pdf\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The IEEE RA will manage resources\
    \ using the IEEE NID and will be\n      the authority for managing the resources\
    \ and subsequent associated\n      strings.  In the associated procedures, the\
    \ IEEE RA will ensure\n      the uniqueness of the strings themselves or will\
    \ permit secondary\n      responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.\n\
    \   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      IEEE will update documentation\
    \ of the registered uses of the IEEE\n      NID as needed.  This will be structured\
    \ such that each\n      \"IEEEresource\" will have a separate description and\
    \ registration\n      table.\n      The registration tables and information are\
    \ published and\n      maintained by the IEEE RA on its web site.\n   Process\
    \ of identifier assignment:\n      IEEE RA will provide procedures for registration\
    \ of each type of\n      resource that it maintains.\n   Process for identifier\
    \ resolution:\n      The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.\n\
    \   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      The strings used as values for \"IEEEresource\"\
    \ and\n      \"ResourceSpecificString\" are case insensitive.\n   Conformance\
    \ with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n   Validation mechanism:\n\
    \      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures\n      implemented\
    \ in support of IEEE activities.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"
- title: 3.  Examples
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples\n   The following examples are representative URNs that could be\
    \ assigned\n   by the IEEE RA.  While support for YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] was\
    \ a\n   catalyst for the creation of the namespace, the following are not\n  \
    \ necessarily the strings that would be assigned.\n      urn:ieee:std:802.5:yang\n\
    \      urn:ieee:foobar\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ other than those\n   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in general,\n   which are described in Functional Requirements for URNs [RFC1737],\n\
    \   URN Syntax [RFC2141], and URN Namespace Definition Mechanisms\n   [RFC3406].\n"
