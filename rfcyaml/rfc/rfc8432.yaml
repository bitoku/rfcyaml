  - "1.  Introduction\n   Microwave radio is a technology that uses high-frequency\
    \ radio waves\n   to provide high-speed wireless connections that can send and\
    \ receive\n   voice, video, and data information.  It is a general term used for\n\
    \   systems covering a very large range of traffic capacities, channel\n   separations,\
    \ modulation formats, and applications over a wide range\n   of frequency bands\
    \ from 1.4 GHz up to and above 100 GHz.\n   The main application for microwave\
    \ is backhaul for mobile broadband.\n   Those networks will continue to be modernized\
    \ using a combination of\n   microwave and fiber technologies.  The choice of\
    \ technology depends\n   on fiber presence and cost of ownership, not capacity\
    \ limitations in\n   microwave.\n   Today, microwave is already able to fully\
    \ support the capacity needs\n   of a backhaul in a radio access network and will\
    \ evolve to support\n   multiple gigabits in traditional frequency bands and more\
    \ than 10\n   gigabits in higher-frequency bands with more bandwidth.  Layer 2\
    \ (L2)\n   Ethernet features are normally an integrated part of microwave nodes,\n\
    \   and more advanced L2 and Layer 3 (L3) features will be introduced\n   over\
    \ time to support the evolution of the transport services that\n   will be provided\
    \ by a backhaul/transport network.  Note that wireless\n   access technologies\
    \ such as 3/4/5G and Wi-Fi are not within the scope\n   of this document.\n  \
    \ Open and standardized interfaces are a prerequisite for efficient\n   management\
    \ of equipment from multiple vendors, integrated in a single\n   system/controller.\
    \  This framework addresses management and control\n   of the radio link interface(s)\
    \ and their relationship to other\n   interfaces (typically, Ethernet interfaces)\
    \ in a microwave node.  A\n   radio link provides the transport over the air,\
    \ using one or several\n   carriers in aggregated or protected configurations.\
    \  Managing and\n   controlling a transport service over a microwave node involves\
    \ both\n   radio link and packet transport functionality.\n   Today, there are\
    \ already numerous IETF data models, RFCs, and\n   Internet-Drafts with technology-specific\
    \ extensions that cover a\n   large part of the L2 and L3 domains.  Examples include\
    \ IP Management\n   [RFC8344], Routing Management [RFC8349], and Provider Bridge\n\
    \   [IEEE802.1Qcp].  These are based on the IETF YANG data model for\n   Interface\
    \ Management [RFC8343], which is an evolution of the SNMP\n   IF-MIB [RFC2863].\n\
    \   Since microwave nodes will contain more and more L2 and L3 (packet)\n   functionality\
    \ that is expected to be managed using those models,\n   there are advantages\
    \ if radio link interfaces can be modeled and\n   managed using the same structure\
    \ and the same approach.  This is\n   especially true for use cases in which a\
    \ microwave node is managed as\n   one common entity that includes both the radio\
    \ link and the L2 and L3\n   functionality, e.g., basic configuration of the node\
    \ and connections,\n   centralized troubleshooting, upgrade, and maintenance.\
    \  All\n   interfaces in a node, irrespective of technology, would then be\n \
    \  accessed from the same core model, i.e., [RFC8343], and could be\n   extended\
    \ with technology-specific parameters in models augmenting\n   that core model.\
    \  The relationship/connectivity between interfaces\n   could be given by the\
    \ physical equipment configuration.  For example,\n   the slot where the Radio\
    \ Link Terminal (modem) is plugged in could be\n   associated with a specific\
    \ Ethernet port due to the wiring in the\n   backplane of the system, or it could\
    \ be flexible and therefore\n   configured via a management system or controller.\n\

    \            Figure 1: Relationship between Interfaces in a Node\n   There will\
    \ always be certain implementations that differ among\n   products, so it is practically\
    \ impossible to achieve industry\n   consensus on every design detail.  It is\
    \ therefore important to focus\n   on the parameters that are required to support\
    \ the use cases\n   applicable for centralized, unified, multi-vendor management\
    \ and to\n   allow other parameters to either be optional or be covered by\n \
    \  extensions to the standardized model.  Furthermore, a standard that\n   allows\
    \ for a certain degree of freedom encourages innovation and\n   competition, which\
    \ benefits the entire industry.  Thus, it is\n   important that a radio link management\
    \ model covers all relevant\n   functions but also leaves room for product- and\
    \ feature-specific\n   extensions.\n   Models are available for microwave radio\
    \ link functionality:\n   \"Microwave Information Model\" by the ONF [ONF-MW]\
    \ and \"Microwave\n   Radio Link YANG Data Models\" submitted to and discussed\
    \ by the CCAMP\n   Working Group [CCAMP-MW].  The purpose of this document is\
    \ to reach\n   consensus within the industry around one common approach with respect\n\
    \   to the use cases and requirements to be supported, the type and\n   structure\
    \ of the model, and the resulting attributes to be included.\n   This document\
    \ describes the use cases, requirements, and expected\n   characteristics of the\
    \ model.  It also includes an analysis of how\n   the models in the two ongoing\
    \ initiatives fulfill these expectations\n   and recommendations for what can\
    \ be reused and what gaps need to be\n   filled by a new and evolved model (\"\

    \ solutions\n   are expected to evolve and benefit from an increased focus on\n\
    \   standardization by simplifying multi-vendor management and removing\n   the\
    \ need for vendor- or domain-specific management.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Software-Defined Networking
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Software-Defined Networking\n   One of the main drivers for applying SDN\
    \ from an operator perspective\n   is simplification and automation of network\
    \ provisioning as well as\n   end-to-end network service management.  The vision\
    \ is to have a\n   global view of the network conditions spanning different vendors'\n\
    \   equipment and multiple technologies.\n   If nodes from different vendors are\
    \ managed by the same SDN\n   controller via a node management interface without\
    \ the extra effort\n   of introducing intermediate systems, all nodes must align\
    \ their node\n   management interfaces.  Hence, an open and standardized node\n\
    \   management interface is required in a multi-vendor environment.  Such\n  \
    \ a standardized interface enables unified management and configuration\n   of\
    \ nodes from different vendors by a common set of applications.\n   In addition\
    \ to SDN applications for configuring, managing, and\n   controlling the nodes\
    \ and their associated transport interfaces\n   (including the L2 Ethernet, L3\
    \ IP, and radio interfaces), there are\n   also a large variety of more advanced\
    \ SDN applications that can be\n   utilized and/or developed.\n   A potentially\
    \ flexible approach for operators is to use SDN in a\n   logically controlled\
    \ way, managing the radio links by selecting a\n   predefined operation mode.\
    \  The operation mode is a set of logical\n   metrics or parameters describing\
    \ a complete radio link configuration,\n   such as capacity, availability, priority,\
    \ and power consumption.\n   An example of an operation mode table is shown in\
    \ Figure 3.  Based on\n   its operation policy (e.g., power consumption or traffic\
    \ priority),\n   the SDN controller selects one operation mode and translates\
    \ that\n   into the required configuration of the individual parameters for the\n\

  - "5.  Requirements\n   For managing a microwave node including both the radio link\
    \ and the\n   packet transport functionality, a unified data model is desired\
    \ to\n   unify the modeling of the radio link interfaces and the L2/L3\n   interfaces\
    \ using the same structure and the same modeling approach.\n   If some part of\
    \ the model is generic for other technology usage, it\n   should be clearly stated.\n\
    \   The purpose of the YANG data model is for management and control of\n   the\
    \ radio link interface(s) and the relationship/connectivity to\n   other interfaces,\
    \ typically to Ethernet interfaces, in a microwave\n   node.\n   The capability\
    \ of configuring and managing microwave nodes includes\n   the following requirements\
    \ for the model:\n   1.  It MUST be possible to configure, manage, and control\
    \ a Radio\n       Link Terminal and the constituent Carrier Terminations.\n  \
    \     A.  Configuration of frequency, channel bandwidth, modulation,\n       \

    \ Carrier Termination.\n       B.  A Radio Link Terminal MUST configure the associated\
    \ Carrier\n           Terminations and the type of aggregation/bonding or\n  \
    \         protection configurations expected for the Radio Link\n           Terminal.\n\
    \       C.  The capability (e.g., the maximum modulation supported) and\n    \
    \       the actual status/statistics (e.g., administrative status of\n       \
    \    the carriers) SHOULD also be supported by the data model.\n       D.  The\
    \ definition of the features and parameters SHOULD be based\n           on established\
    \ microwave equipment and radio standards, such\n           as ETSI EN 302 217\
    \ [EN302217-2], which specifies the\n           essential parameters for microwave\
    \ systems operating from 1.4\n           GHz to 86 GHz.\n   2.  It MUST be possible\
    \ to map different traffic types (e.g., TDM and\n       Ethernet) to the transport\
    \ capacity provided by a specific Radio\n       Link Terminal.\n   3.  It MUST\
    \ be possible to configure and collect historical\n       measurements (for the\
    \ use case described in Section 4.4) to be\n       performed on a radio link interface\
    \ (e.g., minimum, maximum,\n       average transmit power, and received level\
    \ in dBm).\n   4.  It MUST be possible to configure and retrieve alarms reporting\n\
    \       associated with the radio interfaces (e.g., configuration fault,\n   \
    \    signal lost, modem fault, and radio fault).\n"

    \ the ONF Common Information Model.\n   An information model describes the things\
    \ in a domain in terms of\n   objects, their properties (represented as attributes),\
    \ and their\n   relationships.  The ONF information model is expressed in Unified\n\
    \   Modeling Language (UML).  The ONF CoreModel is independent of\n   specific\
    \ data-plane technology.  The technology-specific content,\n   acquired in a runtime\
    \ solution via \"filled in\" cases of\n   specification, augments the CoreModel\
    \ by providing a forwarding\n   technology-specific representation.\n   IETF data\
    \ models define implementations and protocol-specific\n   details.  YANG is a\
    \ data modeling language used to model the\n   configuration and state data. \
    \ [RFC8343] defines a generic YANG data\n   model for interface management that\
    \ doesn't include technology-\n   specific information.  To describe the technology-specific\n\
    \   information, several YANG data models have been proposed in the IETF\n   to\
    \ augment [RFC8343], e.g., the data model defined in [RFC8344].  The\n   YANG\
    \ data model is a popular approach for modeling interfaces for\n   many packet\
    \ transport technologies and is thereby well positioned to\n   become an industry\
    \ standard.  In light of this trend, [CCAMP-MW]\n   provides a YANG data model\
    \ proposal for radio interfaces that is well\n   aligned with the structure of\
    \ other technology-specific YANG data\n   models augmenting [RFC8343].\n   [RFC3444]\
    \ explains the difference between Information Models (IMs)\n   and Data Models\
    \ (DMs).  An IM models managed objects at a conceptual\n   level for designers\
    \ and operators, while a DM is defined at a lower\n   level and includes many\
    \ details for implementers.  In addition, the\n   protocol-specific details are\
    \ usually included in a DM.  Since\n   conceptual models can be implemented in\
    \ different ways, multiple DMs\n   can be derived from a single IM.\n   It is\
    \ recommended to use the structure of the model described in\n   [CCAMP-MW] as\
    \ the starting point, since it is a data model providing\n   the wanted alignment\
    \ with [RFC8343].  To cover the identified gaps,\n   it is recommended to define\
    \ new leafs/parameters and include those in\n   the new model [IETF-MW] while\
    \ taking reference from [ONF-CIM].  It is\n   also recommended to add the required\
    \ data nodes to describe the\n   interface layering for the capacity provided\
    \ by a Radio Link Terminal\n   and the associated Ethernet and TDM interfaces\

    \   summarized as follows:\n   1.  A new YANG data model for radio link [IETF-MW]\
    \ should be defined\n       with enough scope to support the use cases and requirements\
    \ in\n       Sections 4 and 5 of this document.\n   2.  Use the structure of the\
    \ model described in [CCAMP-MW] as the\n       starting point.  It augments [RFC8343]\
    \ and is thereby as required\n       aligned with the structure of the models\
    \ for management of the L2\n       and L3 domains.\n   3.  Use established microwave\
    \ equipment and radio standards (such as\n       [EN302217-2], the model described\
    \ in [CCAMP-MW], and the model\n       described in [ONF-MW]) as the basis for\
    \ the definition of the\n       detailed leafs/ parameters to support the specified\
    \ use cases and\n       requirements, proposing new ones to cover identified gaps.\n\
    \   4.  Add the required data nodes to describe the interface layering\n     \
    \  for the capacity provided by a Radio Link Terminal and the\n       associated\
    \ Ethernet and TDM interfaces, using the principles and\n       data nodes for\
    \ interface layering described in [RFC8343] as a\n       basis.\n   5.  Include\
    \ support for configuration of microwave-specific alarms in\n       the new YANG\
    \ data model [IETF-MW] and rely on a generic model\n       such as [YANG-ALARM]\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The configuration information may be considered\
    \ sensitive or\n   vulnerable in network environments.  Unauthorized access to\n\
    \   configuration data nodes can have a negative effect on network\n   operations,\
    \ e.g., interrupting the ability to forward traffic or\n   increasing the interference\
    \ level of the network.  The status and\n   inventory reveal some network information\
    \ that could be very helpful\n   to an attacker.  A malicious attack to that information\
    \ may result in\n   a loss of customer data.  Security issues concerning the access\n\
    \   control to management interfaces can be generally addressed by\n   authentication\
    \ techniques providing origin verification, integrity,\n   and confidentiality.\
    \  In addition, management interfaces can be\n   physically or logically isolated\
    \ by configuring them to be only\n   accessible out-of-band, through a system\
    \ that is physically or\n   logically separated from the rest of the network infrastructure.\
    \  In\n   cases where management interfaces are accessible in-band at the\n  \
    \ client device or within the microwave transport network domain,\n   filtering\
    \ or firewalling techniques can be used to restrict\n   unauthorized in-band traffic.\
    \  Additionally, authentication\n   techniques may be used in all cases.\n   This\
    \ framework describes the requirements and characteristics of a\n   YANG data\
    \ model for control and management of the radio link\n   interfaces in a microwave\
    \ node.  It is supposed to be accessed via a\n   management protocol with a secure\
    \ transport layer, such as NETCONF\n   [RFC6241].\n"
