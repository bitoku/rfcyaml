- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the Device Owner attribute.  It\
    \ indicates the\n   entity (e.g., company, organization, department, agency) that\
    \ owns\n   the device.  This attribute is intended to be used in public key\n\
    \   certificates [RFC5280] and attribute certificates [RFC5755].\n   This attribute\
    \ may be used in automated authorization decisions.  For\n   example, when two\
    \ peers are deciding whether to communicate, each\n   could check that the device\
    \ owner present in the other device's\n   certificate is on an \"approved\" list.\
    \  This check is performed in\n   addition to certification path validation [RFC5280].\
    \  The mechanism\n   for managing the \"approved\" list is beyond the scope of\
    \ this\n   document.\n   NOTE: This document does not provide an equivalent Lightweight\n\
    \   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) schema specification as this\n   attribute\
    \ is targeted at public key certificates [RFC5280] and\n   attribute certificates\
    \ [RFC5755].  Definition of an equivalent LDAP\n   schema is left to a future\
    \ specification.\n"

- title: 1.2.  ASN.1 Syntax Notation
  contents:
  - "1.2.  ASN.1 Syntax Notation\n   The attribute is defined using ASN.1 [X.680],\
    \ [X.681], [X.682], and\n   [X.683].\n"
- title: 2.  Device Owner
  contents:
  - "2.  Device Owner\n   The Device Owner attribute indicates the entity (e.g., company,\n\
    \   organization, department, agency) that owns the device with which\n   this\
    \ attribute is associated.  Device Owner is an object identifier.\n   The following\
    \ object identifier identifies the Device Owner\n   attribute:\n      id-deviceOwner\
    \ OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {\n        joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1)\
    \ gov(101)\n        dod(2) infosec(1) attributes(5) 69\n      }\n   The ASN.1\
    \ syntax for the Device Owner attribute is as follows:\n      at-deviceOwner ATTRIBUTE\
    \ ::= {\n        TYPE                    OBJECT IDENTIFIER\n        EQUALITY MATCHING\
    \ RULE  objectIdentifierMatch\n        IDENTIFIED BY           id-deviceOwner\n\
    \      }\n   There MUST only be one value of Device Owner associated with a\n\
    \   device.  Distinct owners MUST be represented in separate\n   certificates.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   If this attribute is used as part of an authorization\
    \ process, the\n   procedures employed by the entity that assigns each value must\
    \ ensure\n   that the correct value is applied.  Including this attribute in a\n\
    \   public key certificate or attribute certificate ensures the value for\n  \
    \ the device owner is integrity protected.\n"
