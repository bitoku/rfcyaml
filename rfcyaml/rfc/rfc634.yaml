  - "               Change in Network Address for Haskins Lab\nSometime between May\
    \ 8 and May 22, probably toward the end of that\nperiod, the Haskins Laboratory\
    \ \"Very Distant Host\" connection will be\nmoved from BBN (IMP #5) to Harvard\
    \ (IMP #9).  The Host Number of the\nHaskins machine will remain Host 3 (numbering\
    \ from zero to three).\nThus, the Network Address of the Haskins Laboratory Host\
    \ will change\nfrom 197 to 201.  Since the date of the change is dependent on\n\
    installation of new circuits by the local telephone company, I am unable\nto give\
    \ the actual date more precisely.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable\
    \ form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with\
    \    ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.            11/99 ]\n"
