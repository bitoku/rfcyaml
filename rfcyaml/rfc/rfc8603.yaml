  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a base profile for X.509 v3 Certificates\
    \ and\n   X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for use by applications\n\
    \   that support the United States National Security Agency's Commercial\n   National\
    \ Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite [CNSA].  The profile applies\n   to the capabilities,\
    \ configuration, and operation of all components\n   of US National Security Systems\
    \ that employ such X.509 certificates.\n   US National Security Systems are described\
    \ in NIST Special\n   Publication 800-59 [SP80059].  It is also appropriate for\
    \ all other\n   US Government systems that process high-value information.  It\
    \ is\n   made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these\n\
    \   and any other system deployments.\n   This document does not define any new\
    \ cryptographic algorithm suite;\n   instead, it defines a CNSA-compliant profile\
    \ of \"Internet X.509\n   Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate\
    \ Revocation List\n   (CRL) Profile\" [RFC5280].  It applies to all CNSA Suite\
    \ solutions\n   that make use of X.509 v3 Certificates or X.509 v2 CRLs.  The\
    \ reader\n   is assumed to have familiarity with RFC 5280.  All MUST-level\n \
    \  requirements of RFC 5280 apply throughout this profile and are\n   generally\
    \ not repeated here.  In cases where a MUST-level requirement\n   is repeated\
    \ for emphasis, the text notes the requirement is \"in\n   adherence with RFC\
    \ 5280\".  This profile contains changes that elevate\n   some SHOULD-level options\
    \ in RFC 5280 to MUST-level and also contains\n   changes that elevate some MAY-level\
    \ options in RFC 5280 to SHOULD-\n   level or MUST-level.  All options from RFC\
    \ 5280 that are not listed\n   in this profile remain at the requirement level\
    \ of RFC 5280.\n   The reader is also assumed to have familiarity with these documents:\n\
    \   o  [RFC5480] for the syntax and semantics for the Subject Public Key\n   \
    \   Information field in certificates that support Elliptic Curve\n      Cryptography,\n\
    \   o  [RFC5758] for the algorithm identifiers for Elliptic Curve Digital\n  \
    \    Signature Algorithm (ECDSA),\n   o  [RFC3279] for the syntax and semantics\
    \ for the Subject Public Key\n      Information field in certificates that support\
    \ RSA Cryptography,\n      and\n   o  [RFC4055] for the algorithm identifiers\
    \ for RSA Cryptography with\n      the SHA-384 hash function.\n"

    \ Agency (NSA) profiles commercial cryptographic\n   algorithms and protocols\
    \ as part of its mission to support secure,\n   interoperable communications for\
    \ US Government National Security\n   Systems.  To this end, it publishes guidance\
    \ both to assist with\n   transitioning the United States Government to new algorithms\
    \ and to\n   provide vendors, and the Internet community in general, with\n  \
    \ information concerning their proper use and configuration.\n   Recently, cryptographic\
    \ transition plans have become overshadowed by\n   the prospect of the development\
    \ of a cryptographically relevant\n   quantum computer.  The NSA has established\
    \ the Commercial National\n   Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite to provide vendors\
    \ and IT users near-\n   term flexibility in meeting their cybersecurity interoperability\n\
    \   requirements.  The purpose behind this flexibility is to avoid\n   vendors\
    \ and customers making two major transitions in a relatively\n   short time frame,\
    \ as we anticipate a need to shift to quantum-\n   resistant cryptography in the\
    \ near future.\n   The NSA is authoring a set of RFCs, including this one, to\
    \ provide\n   updated guidance concerning the use of certain commonly available\n\
    \   commercial algorithms in IETF protocols.  These RFCs can be used in\n   conjunction\
    \ with other RFCs and cryptographic guidance (e.g., NIST\n   Special Publications)\
    \ to properly protect Internet traffic and data-\n   at-rest for US Government\
    \ National Security Systems.\n"

  - "4.  General Requirements and Assumptions\n   The goal of this document is to\
    \ define a base set of requirements for\n   certificates and CRLs to support interoperability\
    \ among CNSA Suite\n   solutions.  Specific communities, such as those associated\
    \ with US\n   National Security Systems, may define community profiles that further\n\
    \   restrict certificate and CRL contents by mandating the presence of\n   extensions\
    \ that are optional in this base profile, defining new\n   optional or critical\
    \ extension types, or restricting the values and/\n   or presence of fields within\
    \ existing extensions.  However,\n   communications between distinct communities\
    \ MUST conform with the\n   requirements specified in this document when interoperability\
    \ is\n   desired.  Applications may add requirements for additional\n   non-critical\
    \ extensions, but they MUST NOT assume that a remote peer\n   will be able to\
    \ process them.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Implementing the CNSA Suite
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Implementing the CNSA Suite\n   Every CNSA Suite certificate MUST use the\
    \ X.509 v3 format and contain\n   one of the following:\n   o  An ECDSA-capable\
    \ signature verification key using curve P-384, or\n   o  An ECDH-capable (Elliptic\
    \ Curve Diffie-Hellman) key establishment\n      key using curve P-384, or\n \
    \  o  An RSA-capable signature verification key using RSA-3072 or\n      RSA-4096,\
    \ or\n   o  An RSA-capable key transport key using RSA-3072 or RSA-4096.\n   The\
    \ signature applied to all CNSA Suite certificates and CRLs MUST be\n   made with\
    \ a signing key that is either generated on the curve P-384,\n   or is an RSA-3072\
    \ or RSA-4096 key.  The SHA-384 hashing algorithm\n   MUST be used for all certificate\
    \ and CRL signatures irrespective of\n   the type of key used.\n   The RSA exponent\
    \ \"e\" MUST satisfy 2^16<e<2^256 and be odd per\n   [FIPS186].\n   The requirements\
    \ of this document are not intended to preclude use of\n   RSASSA-PSS signatures.\
    \  However, Certification Authorities (CAs)\n   conforming with this document\
    \ will not issue certificates specifying\n   that algorithm for subject public\
    \ keys.  Protocols that use RSASSA-\n   PSS should be configured to use certificates\
    \ that specify\n   rsaEncryption as the subject public key algorithm.  Protocols\
    \ that\n   use these keys with RSASSA-PSS signatures must use the following\n\
    \   parameters: the hash algorithm (used for both mask generation and\n   signature\
    \ generation) must be SHA-384, the mask generation function 1\n   from [RFC8017]\
    \ must be used, and the salt length must be 48 octets.\n"
