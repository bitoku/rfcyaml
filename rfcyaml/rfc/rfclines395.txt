SWITCH SETTINGS ON IMPS AND TIPS
This note provides a description of the switches on the front panel of IMPs and TIPs that are important to the correct operation of the network software.
We have had some difficulty in the past when certain of these switches were set incorrectly, This RFC will be updated as necessary, to notify site personnel of changes to the settings.
The IMP at your site is a model 516 if it has a gray cabinet and two rows of indicator lights on the front panel.
The correct switch settings are: 1.
Sense switches 1,2,3 and 4:  OFF (DOWN)
The IMP at your site is a model 316 if it is a TIP or if it is in a black cabinet and has one row of indicator lights on the front panel.
Sense switches 1,2,3,4 OFF  (top half depressed)
Site personnel are requested to keep a copy of this RFC near the IMP and to check the switch settings at their IMP.
In addition, the Honeywell field engineers who perform preventive maintenance have been requested to use this note as a checklist.
