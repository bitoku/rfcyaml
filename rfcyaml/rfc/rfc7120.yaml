- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In protocol specifications documented in RFCs, there is\
    \ often a need\n   to allocate code points for various objects, messages, or other\n\
    \   protocol entities so that implementations can interoperate.  Many of\n   these\
    \ code point spaces have registries handled by the Internet\n   Assigned Number\
    \ Authority (IANA).  Several IETF policies for IANA\n   allocation of protocol\
    \ parameters are described in RFC 5226\n   [RFC5226].  Some of them, such as \"\
    First Come First Served\" or\n   \"Expert Review\", do not require a formal IETF\
    \ action before the IANA\n   performs allocation.  However, in situations where\
    \ code points are a\n   scarce resource and/or the IETF community has consensus\
    \ to retain\n   tight control of the registry content, policies such as \"IETF\
    \ Review\"\n   (formerly \"IETF Consensus\"), or \"Standards Action\" have been\
    \ used.\n   Such allocation policies present a problem in situations where\n \
    \  implementation and/or deployment experience are desired or required\n   before\
    \ the document becomes an RFC.\n   To break the deadlock, document authors often\
    \ choose some \"seemingly\n   unused\" code points, often by selecting the next\
    \ available value from\n   the registry; this is problematic because these may\
    \ turn out to be\n   different from those later assigned by IANA.  To make this\
    \ problem\n   worse, \"pre-RFC\" implementations are often developed and deployed\n\
    \   based on these code point selections.  This creates several potential\n  \
    \ interoperability problems between early implementations and\n   implementations\
    \ of the final standard, as described below:\n   1.  IANA allocates code points\
    \ different from those that early\n       implementations assumed would be allocated.\
    \  Early\n       implementations won't interoperate with standard ones.\n   2.\
    \  IANA allocates code points for one extension while a \"pre-RFC\"\n       implementation\
    \ of a different extension chooses the same code\n       point.  The different\
    \ extensions will collide on the same code\n       point in the field.\n   This\
    \ gets in the way of the main purpose of standards; namely, to\n   facilitate\
    \ interoperable implementations.\n   It is easy to say that pre-RFC implementations\
    \ should be kept private\n   and should not be deployed; however, both the length\
    \ of the standards\n   process and the immense value of early implementations\
    \ and early\n   deployments suggest that finding a better solution is worthwhile.\
    \  As\n   an example, in the case of documents produced by Working Groups in\n\
    \   the Routing Area, a pre-RFC implementation is highly desirable and\n   sometimes\
    \ even required [RFC4794], and early deployments provide\n   useful feedback on\
    \ the technical and operational quality of the\n   specification.\n   This memo\
    \ addresses the early allocation of code points so that\n   reservations are made\
    \ in the IANA registries before the publication\n   of an RFC.  The early allocation\
    \ mechanisms are applied only to\n   spaces whose allocation policy is \"Specification\
    \ Required\" (where an\n   RFC is used as the stable reference), \"RFC Required\"\
    , \"IETF Review\",\n   or \"Standards Action\".  For an explanation of these allocation\n\
    \   policies, see [RFC5226].\n   A policy for IANA early allocations was previously\
    \ described in\n   [RFC4020].  This document obsoletes RFC 4020 and includes other\n\
    \   registration procedures regarding the types of registries that can\n   qualify\
    \ for early allocation.  The procedures in this document are\n   intended to apply\
    \ only to IETF Stream documents.\n"
- title: 2.  Conditions for Early Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.  Conditions for Early Allocation\n   The following conditions must hold before\
    \ a request for early\n   allocation of code points will be considered by IANA:\n\
    \   a.  The code points must be from a space designated as \"RFC\n       Required\"\
    , \"IETF Review\", or \"Standards Action\".  Additionally,\n       requests for\
    \ early assignment of code points from a\n       \"Specification Required\" registry\
    \ are allowed if the\n       specification will be published as an RFC.\n   b.\
    \  The format, semantics, processing, and other rules related to\n       handling\
    \ the protocol entities defined by the code points\n       (henceforth called\
    \ \"specifications\") must be adequately described\n       in an Internet-Draft.\n\
    \   c.  The specifications of these code points must be stable; i.e., if\n   \
    \    there is a change, implementations based on the earlier and later\n     \
    \  specifications must be seamlessly interoperable.\n   d.  The Working Group\
    \ chairs and Area Directors (ADs) judge that\n       there is sufficient interest\
    \ in the community for early (pre-RFC)\n       implementation and deployment,\
    \ or that failure to make an early\n       allocation might lead to contention\
    \ for the code point in the\n       field.\n"
- title: 3.  Process for Early Allocation
  contents:
  - "3.  Process for Early Allocation\n   There are three processes associated with\
    \ early allocation: making\n   the request for code points; following up on the\
    \ request; and\n   revoking an early allocation.  It cannot be emphasized enough\
    \ that\n   these processes must have a minimal impact on IANA itself, or they\n\
    \   will not be feasible.\n   The processes described below assume that the document\
    \ in question is\n   the product of an IETF Working Group (WG).  If this is not\
    \ the case,\n   replace \"WG chairs\" below with \"Shepherding Area Director\"\
    .\n"
- title: 3.1.  Request
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Request\n   The process for requesting and obtaining early allocation of\
    \ code\n   points is as follows:\n   1.  The authors (editors) of the document\
    \ submit a request for early\n       allocation to the Working Group chairs, specifying\
    \ which code\n       points require early allocation and to which document they\
    \ should\n       be assigned.\n   2.  The WG chairs determine whether the conditions\
    \ for early\n       allocations described in Section 2 are met, particularly\n\
    \       conditions (c) and (d).\n   3.  The WG chairs gauge whether there is consensus\
    \ within the WG that\n       early allocation is appropriate for the given document.\n\
    \   4.  If steps 2) and 3) are satisfied, the WG chairs request approval\n   \
    \    from the Area Director(s).  The Area Director(s) may apply\n       judgement\
    \ to the request, especially if there is a risk of\n       registry depletion.\n\
    \   5.  If the Area Directors approve step 4), the WG chairs request IANA\n  \
    \     to make an early allocation.\n   6.  IANA makes an allocation from the appropriate\
    \ registry, marking\n       it as \"Temporary\", valid for a period of one year\
    \ from the date\n       of allocation.  The date of first allocation and the date\
    \ of\n       expiry are also recorded in the registry and made visible to the\n\
    \       public.\n   Note that Internet-Drafts should not include a specific value\
    \ of a\n   code point until IANA has completed the early allocation for this\n\
    \   value.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Follow-Up
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Follow-Up\n   It is the responsibility of the document authors and the\
    \ Working\n   Group chairs to review changes in the document, and especially in\
    \ the\n   specifications of the code points for which early allocation was\n \
    \  requested, to ensure that the changes are backward compatible.\n   If at some\
    \ point changes that are not backward compatible are\n   nonetheless required,\
    \ a decision needs to be made as to whether\n   previously allocated code points\
    \ must be deprecated (see Section 3.3\n   for more information on code point deprecation).\
    \  The considerations\n   include aspects such as the possibility of existing\
    \ deployments of\n   the older implementations and, hence, the possibility for\
    \ a collision\n   between older and newer implementations in the field.\n   If\
    \ the document progresses to the point at which IANA normally makes\n   code point\
    \ allocations, it is the responsibility of the authors and\n   the WG chairs to\
    \ remind IANA that there were early allocations and of\n   the code point values\
    \ allocated in the IANA Considerations section of\n   the RFC-to-be.  Allocation\
    \ is then just a matter of removing the\n   \"Temporary\" tag from the allocation\
    \ description.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Expiry
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Expiry\n   As described in Section 3.1, each temporary assignment is recorded\
    \ in\n   the registry with the date of expiry of the assignment.  If an early\n\
    \   allocation expires before the document progresses to the point where\n   IANA\
    \ normally makes allocations, the authors and WG chairs may repeat\n   the process\
    \ described in Section 3.1 to request renewal of the code\n   points.  At most,\
    \ one renewal request may be made; thus, authors\n   should choose carefully when\
    \ the original request is to be made.\n   As an exception to the above rule, under\
    \ rare circumstances, more\n   than one allocation renewal may be justified. \
    \ All such further\n   renewal requests must be reviewed by the IESG.  The renewal\
    \ request\n   to the IESG must include the reasons why such further renewal is\n\
    \   necessary and the WG's plans regarding the specification.\n   If a follow-up\
    \ request is not made, or the document fails to progress\n   to an RFC, the assignment\
    \ will remain visible in the registry, but\n   the temporary assignment will be\
    \ shown to have expired as indicated\n   by the expiry date.  The WG chairs are\
    \ responsible for informing IANA\n   that the expired assignments are not required\
    \ and that the code\n   points are to be marked \"deprecated\".\n   A deprecated\
    \ code point is not marked as allocated for use as\n   described in any document\
    \ (that is, it is not allocated) and is not\n   available for allocation in a\
    \ future document.  The WG chairs may\n   inform IANA that a deprecated code point\
    \ can be completely\n   de-allocated (i.e., made available for new allocations)\
    \ at any time\n   after it has been deprecated.  Factors influencing this decision\
    \ will\n   include whether there may be implementations using the previous\n \
    \  temporary allocation and the availability of other unallocated code\n   points\
    \ in the registry.\n   Implementers and deployers need to be aware that deprecation\
    \ and\n   de-allocation could take place at any time after expiry; therefore,\n\
    \   an expired early allocation is best considered as deprecated.\n   It is not\
    \ IANA's responsibility to track the status of allocations,\n   their expirations,\
    \ or when they may be re-allocated.\n   Note that if a document is submitted for\
    \ review to the IESG, and at\n   the time of submission some early allocations\
    \ are valid (not\n   expired), these allocations must not be considered to have\
    \ expired\n   while the document is under IESG consideration or is awaiting\n\
    \   publication in the RFC Editor's queue after approval by the IESG.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines procedures for early allocation\
    \ of code points\n   in the registries with the \"Specification Required\", \"\
    RFC Required\",\n   \"IETF Review\", and \"Standards Action\" policies and as\
    \ such directly\n   affects IANA.  This document removes the need for registries\
    \ to be\n   marked as specifically allowing early allocation.  IANA has updated\n\
    \   impacted registries by removing any such markings.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   It is important to keep in mind that denial-of-service\
    \ attacks on\n   IANA are possible as a result of the processes defined in this\
    \ memo.\n   There are two that are immediately obvious: depletion of code space\n\
    \   by early allocations and process overloading of IANA itself.  The\n   processes\
    \ described here attempt to alleviate both of these potential\n   attacks, but\
    \ they are subject to scrutiny by IANA to ensure that they\n   work.  IANA may\
    \ at any time request that the IESG suspend the\n   procedures described in this\
    \ document.\n   There is a significant concern that the procedures in this document\n\
    \   could be used as an end-run on the IETF process to achieve code point\n  \
    \ allocation when an RFC will not be published.  For example, a WG or a\n   WG\
    \ chair might be pressured to obtain an early allocation for a\n   protocol extension\
    \ for a particular company or for another Standards\n   Development Organization\
    \ even though it might be predicted that an\n   IETF LC or IESG Evaluation would\
    \ reject the approach that is\n   documented.  The requirement for AD consent\
    \ of early review is an\n   important safeguard, and ADs with any concern are\
    \ strongly\n   recommended to escalate the issue for IESG-wide discussion.\n"
