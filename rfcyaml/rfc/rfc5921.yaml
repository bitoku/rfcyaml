  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies an architectural framework for the\n   application\
    \ of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to the\n   construction of packet-switched\
    \ transport networks.  It describes a\n   common set of protocol functions --\
    \ the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-\n   TP) -- that supports the operational models\
    \ and capabilities typical\n   of such networks, including signaled or explicitly\
    \ provisioned\n   bidirectional connection-oriented paths, protection and restoration\n\
    \   mechanisms, comprehensive Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n  \
    \ (OAM) functions, and network operation in the absence of a dynamic\n   control\
    \ plane or IP forwarding support.  Some of these functions are\n   defined in\
    \ existing MPLS specifications, while others require\n   extensions to existing\
    \ specifications to meet the requirements of the\n   MPLS-TP.\n   This document\
    \ defines the subset of the MPLS-TP applicable in general\n   and to point-to-point\
    \ transport paths.  The remaining subset,\n   applicable specifically to point-to-multipoint\
    \ transport paths, is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n   This document\
    \ is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International\
    \ Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T)\
    \ effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire\
    \ Emulation Edge-to-Edge\n   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities\
    \ and functionalities\n   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.\n"

  - "1.1.  Motivation and Background\n   This document describes an architectural\
    \ framework for the\n   application of MPLS to the construction of packet-switched\
    \ transport\n   networks.  It specifies the common set of protocol functions that\n\
    \   meet the requirements in [RFC5654], and that together constitute the\n   MPLS\
    \ Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) for point-to-point transport paths.\n   The remaining\
    \ MPLS-TP functions, applicable specifically to point-to-\n   multipoint transport\
    \ paths, are outside the scope of this document.\n   Historically, the optical\
    \ transport infrastructure -- Synchronous\n   Optical Network/Synchronous Digital\
    \ Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) and Optical\n   Transport Network (OTN) -- has provided\
    \ carriers with a high\n   benchmark for reliability and operational simplicity.\
    \  To achieve\n   this, transport technologies have been designed with specific\n\
    \   characteristics:\n   o  Strictly connection-oriented connectivity, which may\
    \ be long-lived\n      and may be provisioned manually, for example, by network\n\
    \      management systems or direct node configuration using a command\n     \
    \ line interface.\n   o  A high level of availability.\n   o  Quality of service.\n\
    \   o  Extensive Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)\n      capabilities.\n\
    \   Carriers wish to evolve such transport networks to take advantage of\n   the\
    \ flexibility and cost benefits of packet switching technology and\n   to support\
    \ packet-based services more efficiently.  While MPLS is a\n   maturing packet\
    \ technology that already plays an important role in\n   transport networks and\
    \ services, not all MPLS capabilities and\n   mechanisms are needed in, or consistent\
    \ with, the transport network\n   operational model.  There are also transport\
    \ technology\n   characteristics that are not currently reflected in MPLS.\n \
    \  There are thus two objectives for MPLS-TP:\n   1.  To enable MPLS to be deployed\
    \ in a transport network and operated\n       in a similar manner to existing\
    \ transport technologies.\n   2.  To enable MPLS to support packet transport services\
    \ with a\n       similar degree of predictability to that found in existing\n\
    \       transport networks.\n   In order to achieve these objectives, there is\
    \ a need to define a\n   common set of MPLS protocol functions -- an MPLS Transport\
    \ Profile --\n   for the use of MPLS in transport networks and applications. \
    \ Some of\n   the necessary functions are provided by existing MPLS specifications,\n\
    \   while others require additions to the MPLS tool-set.  Such additions\n   should,\
    \ wherever possible, be applicable to MPLS networks in general\n   as well as\
    \ those that conform strictly to the transport network\n   model.\n   This document\
    \ is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International\
    \ Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T)\
    \ effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3\
    \ architectures to support the\n   capabilities and functionalities of a packet\
    \ transport network as\n   defined by the ITU-T.\n"

    \ networks to provide packet\n   transport services with a similar degree of predictability\
    \ to that\n   found in existing transport networks.  Such packet transport services\n\
    \   exhibit a number of characteristics, defined in [RFC5654]:\n   o  In an environment\
    \ where an MPLS-TP layer network is supporting a\n      client layer network,\
    \ and the MPLS-TP layer network is supported\n      by a server layer network\
    \ then operation of the MPLS-TP layer\n      network must be possible without\
    \ any dependencies on either the\n      server or client layer network.\n   o\
    \  The service provided by the MPLS-TP network to a given client will\n      not\
    \ fall below the agreed level as a result of the traffic loading\n      of other\
    \ clients.\n   o  The control and management planes of any client network layer\
    \ that\n      uses the service is isolated from the control and management\n \
    \     planes of the MPLS-TP layer network, where the client network\n      layer\
    \ is considered to be the native service of the MPLS-TP\n      network.\n   o\
    \  Where a client network makes use of an MPLS-TP server that\n      provides\
    \ a packet transport service, the level of coordination\n      required between\
    \ the client and server layer networks is minimal\n      (preferably no coordination\
    \ will be required).\n   o  The complete set of packets generated by a client\
    \ MPLS(-TP) layer\n      network using the packet transport service, which may\
    \ contain\n      packets that are not MPLS packets (e.g., IP or CLNS\n      (Connectionless\
    \ Network Service) packets used by the control/\n      management plane of the\
    \ client MPLS(-TP) layer network), are\n      transported by the MPLS-TP server\
    \ layer network.\n   o  The packet transport service enables the MPLS-TP layer\
    \ network\n      addressing and other information (e.g., topology) to be hidden\n\
    \      from any client layer networks using that service, and vice-versa.\n  \
    \ These characteristics imply that a packet transport service does not\n   support\
    \ a connectionless packet-switched forwarding mode.  However,\n   this does not\

  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  MPLS-TP Native Service Adaptation Functions\n   The MPLS-TP native service\
    \ adaptation functions interface the client\n   layer network service to MPLS-TP.\
    \  For pseudowires, these adaptation\n   functions are the payload encapsulation\
    \ described in Section 4.4 of\n   [RFC3985] and Section 6 of [RFC5659].  For network\

- title: 3.3.2.  MPLS-TP Forwarding Functions
  contents:

    \ mechanisms required for\n   forwarding the encapsulated native service traffic\
    \ over an MPLS-TP\n   server layer network, for example, PW and LSP labels.\n\
    \   MPLS-TP LSPs use the MPLS label switching operations and Time-to-Live\n  \
    \ (TTL) processing procedures defined in [RFC3031], [RFC3032], and\n   [RFC3443],\
    \ as profiled in [DATA-PLANE].  These operations are highly\n   optimized for\
    \ performance and are not modified by the MPLS-TP\n   profile.\n   In addition,\
    \ MPLS-TP PWs use the SS-PW and optionally the MS-PW\n   forwarding operations\
    \ defined in [RFC3985] and [RFC5659].\n   Per-platform label space is used for\
    \ PWs.  Either per-platform, per-\n   interface, or other context-specific label\
    \ space [RFC5331] may be\n   used for LSPs.\n   MPLS-TP forwarding is based on\
    \ the label that identifies the\n   transport path (LSP or PW).  The label value\
    \ specifies the processing\n   operation to be performed by the next hop at that\
    \ level of\n   encapsulation.  A swap of this label is an atomic operation in\
    \ which\n   the contents of the packet after the swapped label are opaque to the\n\
    \   forwarder.  The only event that interrupts a swap operation is TTL\n   expiry.\
    \  This is a fundamental architectural construct of MPLS to be\n   taken into\
    \ account when designing protocol extensions (such as those\n   for OAM) that\
    \ require packets to be sent to an intermediate LSR.\n   Further processing to\
    \ determine the context of a packet occurs when a\n   swap operation is interrupted\
    \ in this manner, or a pop operation\n   exposes a specific reserved label at\
    \ the top of the stack, or the\n   packet is received with the GAL (Section 3.6)\
    \ at the top of stack.\n   Otherwise, the packet is forwarded according to the\
    \ procedures in\n   [RFC3032].\n   MPLS-TP supports Quality of Service capabilities\
    \ via the MPLS\n   Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture [RFC3270].\
    \  Both\n   E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS Diffserv modes are supported.\n   Further details\

    \ Private Wire Service\n   (VPWS), a Virtual Private Local Area Network Service\
    \ (VPLS), a\n   Virtual Private Multicast Service (VPMS), and an Internet Protocol\n\
    \   Local Area Network Service (IPLS).  VPWS, VLPS, and IPLS are\n   described\
    \ in [RFC4664].  VPMS is described in [VPMS-REQS].\n   If the MPLS-TP network\
    \ provides a layer 2 interface (that can carry\n   both network-layer and non-network-layer\
    \ traffic) as a service\n   interface, then a PW is required to support the service\
    \ interface.\n   The PW is a client of the MPLS-TP LSP server layer.  The architecture\n\
    \   for an MPLS-TP network that provides such services is based on the\n   MPLS\
    \ [RFC3031] and pseudowire [RFC3985] architectures.  Multi-segment\n   pseudowires\
    \ may optionally be used to provide a packet transport\n   service, and their\
    \ use is consistent with the MPLS-TP architecture.\n   The use of MS-PWs may be\
    \ motivated by, for example, the requirements\n   specified in [RFC5254].  If\
    \ MS-PWs are used, then the MS-PW\n   architecture [RFC5659] also applies.\n \
    \  Figure 7 shows the architecture for an MPLS-TP network using single-\n   segment\
    \ PWs.  Note that, in this document, the client layer is\n   equivalent to the\
    \ emulated service described in [RFC3985], while the\n   Transport LSP is equivalent\
    \ to the Packet Switched Network (PSN)\n   tunnel of [RFC3985].\n            |<-----------------\

  contents:
  - "3.4.5.  Network Layer Adaptation\n   MPLS-TP LSPs can be used to transport network-layer\
    \ clients.  This\n   document uses the term Network Layer in the same sense as\
    \ it is used\n   in [RFC3031] and [RFC3032].  The network-layer protocols supported\
    \ by\n   [RFC3031] and [RFC3032] can be transported between service\n   interfaces.\
    \  Support for network-layer clients follows the MPLS\n   architecture for support\
    \ of network-layer protocols as specified in\n   [RFC3031] and [RFC3032].\n  \
    \ With network-layer adaptation, the MPLS-TP domain provides either a\n   unidirectional\
    \ or bidirectional point-to-point connection between two\n   PEs in order to deliver\
    \ a packet transport service to attached\n   customer edge (CE) nodes.  For example,\
    \ a CE may be an IP, MPLS, or\n   MPLS-TP node.  As shown in Figure 10, there\
    \ is an attachment circuit\n   between the CE node on the left and its corresponding\
    \ provider edge\n   (PE) node (which provides the service interface), a bidirectional\
    \ LSP\n   across the MPLS-TP network to the corresponding PE node on the right,\n\
    \   and an attachment circuit between that PE node and the corresponding\n   CE\
    \ node for this service.\n   The attachment circuits may be heterogeneous (e.g.,\
    \ any combination\n   of SDH, PPP, Frame Relay, etc.) and network-layer protocol\
    \ payloads\n   arrive at the service interface encapsulated in the Layer 1 / Layer\
    \ 2\n   encoding defined for that access link type.  It should be noted that\n\
    \   the set of network-layer protocols includes MPLS, and hence MPLS-\n   encoded\
    \ packets with an MPLS label stack (the client MPLS stack) may\n   appear at the\
    \ service interface.\n   The following figures illustrate the reference models\
    \ for network-\n   layer adaptation.  The details of these figures are described\

    \ network and it\n   is not visible outside that network.  Figure 12 shows how\
    \ a client\n   network protocol stack (which may be an MPLS label stack and payload)\n\
    \   is carried over a network layer client service over an MPLS-TP\n   transport\
    \ network.\n   A label may be used to identify the network-layer protocol payload\n\
    \   type.  Therefore, when multiple protocol payload types are to be\n   carried\
    \ over a single service LSP, a unique label stack entry needs\n   to be present\
    \ for each payload type.  Such labels are referred to as\n   \"Encapsulation Labels\"\
    , one of which is shown in Figure 12.  An\n   Encapsulation Label may be either\
    \ configured or signaled.\n   Both an Encapsulation Label and a Service Label\
    \ should be present in\n   the label stack when a particular packet transport\
    \ service is\n   supporting more than one network-layer protocol payload type.\
    \  For\n   example, if both IP and MPLS are to be carried, then two\n   Encapsulation\
    \ Labels are mapped on to a common Service Label.\n   Note: The Encapsulation\
    \ Label may be omitted when the service LSP is\n   supporting only one network-layer\
    \ protocol payload type.  For\n   example, if only MPLS labeled packets are carried\
    \ over a service,\n   then the Service Label (stack entry) provides both the payload\
    \ type\n   indication and service identification.  The Encapsulation Label\n \
    \  cannot have any of the reserved label values [RFC3032].\n   Service labels\
    \ are typically carried over an MPLS-TP Transport LSP\n   edge-to-edge (or transport\
    \ path layer).  An MPLS-TP Transport LSP is\n   represented as an LSP Transport\
    \ Demux label, as shown in Figure 12.\n   Transport LSP is commonly used when\
    \ more than one service exists\n   between two PEs.\n   Note that, if only one\
    \ service exists between two PEs, the functions\n   of the Transport LSP label\
    \ and the Service LSP Label may be combined\n   into a single label stack entry.\
    \  For example, if only one service is\n   carried between two PEs, then a single\
    \ label could be used to provide\n   both the service indication and the MPLS-TP\
    \ Transport LSP.\n   Alternatively, if multiple services exist between a pair\
    \ of PEs, then\n   a per-client Service Label would be mapped on to a common MPLS-TP\n\
    \   Transport LSP.\n   As noted above, the Layer 2 and Layer 1 protocols used\
    \ to carry the\n   network-layer protocol over the attachment circuits are not\n\
    \   transported across the MPLS-TP network.  This enables the use of\n   different\
    \ Layer 2 and Layer 1 protocols on the two attachment\n   circuits.\n   At each\
    \ service interface, Layer 2 addressing needs to be used to\n   ensure the proper\
    \ delivery of a network-layer packet to the adjacent\n   node.  This is typically\
    \ only an issue for LAN media technologies\n   (e.g., Ethernet) that have Media\
    \ Access Control (MAC) addresses.  In\n   cases where a MAC address is needed,\
    \ the sending node sets the\n   destination MAC address to an address that ensures\
    \ delivery to the\n   adjacent node.  That is, the CE sets the destination MAC\
    \ address to\n   an address that ensures delivery to the PE, and the PE sets the\n\
    \   destination MAC address to an address that ensures delivery to the\n   CE.\
    \  The specific address used is technology type specific and is not\n   specified\
    \ in this document.  In some technologies, the MAC address\n   will need to be\
    \ configured.\n   Note that when two CEs, which peer with each other, operate\
    \ over a\n   network layer transport service and run a routing protocol such as\n\
    \   IS-IS or OSPF, some care should be taken to configure the routing\n   protocols\
    \ to use point-to-point adjacencies.  The specifics of such\n   configuration\
    \ is outside the scope of this document.  See [RFC5309]\n   for additional details.\n\
    \   The CE-to-CE service types and corresponding labels may be configured\n  \
    \ or signaled.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.6.  Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)\n   For correct operation of OAM mechanisms,\
    \ it is important that OAM\n   packets fate-share with the data packets.  In addition,\
    \ in MPLS-TP it\n   is necessary to discriminate between user data payloads and\
    \ other\n   types of payload.  For example, a packet may be associated with a\n\
    \   Signaling Communication Channel (SCC) or a channel used for a\n   protocol\
    \ to coordinate path protection state.  This is achieved by\n   carrying such\
    \ packets in either:\n   o  A generic control channel associated to the LSP, PW,\
    \ or section,\n      with no IP encapsulation, e.g., in a similar manner to\n\
    \      Bidirectional Forwarding Detection for Virtual Circuit\n      Connectivity\
    \ Verification (VCCV-BFD) with PW ACH encapsulation\n      [RFC5885]).\n   o \
    \ An IP encapsulation where IP capabilities are present, e.g., PW\n      ACH encapsulation\
    \ with IP headers for VCCV-BFD [RFC5885] or IP\n      encapsulation for MPLS BFD\
    \ [RFC5884].\n   MPLS-TP makes use of such a generic associated channel (G-ACh)\
    \ to\n   support Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security\n\
    \   (FCAPS) functions by carrying packets related to OAM, a protocol used\n  \
    \ to coordinate path protection state, SCC, MCC or other packet types\n   in-band\
    \ over LSPs, PWs, or sections.  The G-ACh is defined in\n   [RFC5586] and is similar\
    \ to the Pseudowire Associated Channel\n   [RFC4385], which is used to carry OAM\
    \ packets over pseudowires.  The\n   G-ACh is indicated by an Associated Channel\
    \ Header (ACH), similar to\n   the Pseudowire VCCV control word; this header is\
    \ present for all\n   sections, LSPs, and PWs that make use of FCAPS functions\
    \ supported by\n   the G-ACh.\n   As specified in [RFC5586], the G-ACh must only\
    \ be used for channels\n   that are an adjunct to the data service.  Examples\
    \ of these are OAM,\n   a protocol used to coordinate path protection state, MCC,\
    \ and SCC,\n   but the use is not restricted to these services.  The G-ACh must\
    \ not\n   be used to carry additional data for use in the forwarding path,\n \
    \  i.e., it must not be used as an alternative to a PW control word, or\n   to\
    \ define a PW type.\n   At the server layer, bandwidth and QoS commitments apply\
    \ to the gross\n   traffic on the LSP, PW, or section.  Since the G-ACh traffic\
    \ is\n   indistinguishable from the user data traffic, protocols using the\n \
    \  G-ACh need to take into consideration the impact they have on the\n   user\
    \ data with which they are sharing resources.  Conversely,\n   capacity needs\
    \ to be made available for important G-ACh uses such as\n   protection and OAM.\
    \  In addition, the security and congestion\n   considerations described in [RFC5586]\
    \ apply to protocols using the\n   G-ACh.\n   Figure 13 shows the reference model\
    \ depicting how the control channel\n   is associated with the pseudowire protocol\

  contents:
  - "3.7.  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)\n   The MPLS-TP OAM architecture\
    \ supports a wide range of OAM functions\n   to check continuity, to verify connectivity,\
    \ to monitor path\n   performance, and to generate, filter, and manage local and\
    \ remote\n   defect alarms.  These functions are applicable to any layer defined\n\
    \   within MPLS-TP, i.e., to MPLS-TP sections, LSPs, and PWs.\n   The MPLS-TP\
    \ OAM tool-set is able to operate without relying on a\n   dynamic control plane\
    \ or IP functionality in the data path.  In the\n   case of an MPLS-TP deployment\
    \ in a network in which IP functionality\n   is available, all existing IP/MPLS\
    \ OAM functions (e.g., LSP Ping,\n   BFD, and VCCV) may be used.  Since MPLS-TP\
    \ can operate in\n   environments where IP is not used in the forwarding plane,\
    \ the\n   default mechanism for OAM demultiplexing in MPLS-TP LSPs and PWs is\n\
    \   the Generic Associated Channel (Section 3.6).  Forwarding based on IP\n  \
    \ addresses for OAM or user data packets is not required for MPLS-TP.\n   [RFC4379]\
    \ and BFD for MPLS LSPs [RFC5884] have defined alert\n   mechanisms that enable\
    \ an MPLS LSR to identify and process MPLS OAM\n   packets when the OAM packets\
    \ are encapsulated in an IP header.  These\n   alert mechanisms are based on TTL\
    \ expiration and/or use an IP\n   destination address in the range 127/8 for IPv4\
    \ and that same range\n   embedded as IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses for IPv6 [RFC4379].\
    \  When the\n   OAM packets are encapsulated in an IP header, these mechanisms\
    \ are\n   the default mechanisms for MPLS networks (in general) for identifying\n\
    \   MPLS OAM packets, although the mechanisms defined in [RFC5586] can\n   also\
    \ be used.  MPLS-TP is able to operate in environments where IP\n   forwarding\
    \ is not supported, and thus the G-ACh/GAL is the default\n   mechanism to demultiplex\
    \ OAM packets in MPLS-TP in these\n   environments.\n   MPLS-TP supports a comprehensive\
    \ set of OAM capabilities for packet\n   transport applications, with equivalent\
    \ capabilities to those\n   provided in SONET/SDH.\n   MPLS-TP requires [RFC5860]\
    \ that a set of OAM capabilities is\n   available to perform fault management\
    \ (e.g., fault detection and\n   localization) and performance monitoring (e.g.,\
    \ packet delay and loss\n   measurement) of the LSP, PW, or section.  The framework\
    \ for OAM in\n   MPLS-TP is specified in [OAM-FRAMEWORK].\n   MPLS-TP OAM packets\
    \ share the same fate as their corresponding data\n   packets, and are identified\
    \ through the Generic Associated Channel\n   mechanism [RFC5586].  This uses a\
    \ combination of an Associated\n   Channel Header (ACH) and a G-ACh Label (GAL)\
    \ to create a control\n   channel associated to an LSP, section, or PW.\n   OAM\
    \ and monitoring in MPLS-TP is based on the concept of maintenance\n   entities,\
    \ as described in [OAM-FRAMEWORK].  A Maintenance Entity (ME)\n   can be viewed\
    \ as the association of two Maintenance Entity Group End\n   Points (MEPs).  A\
    \ Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) is a collection of\n   one or more MEs that belongs\
    \ to the same transport path and that are\n   maintained and monitored as a group.\
    \  The MEPs that form an ME limit\n   the OAM responsibilities of an OAM flow\
    \ to within the domain of a\n   transport path or segment, in the specific layer\
    \ network that is\n   being monitored and managed.\n   A MEG may also include\
    \ a set of Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate\n   Points (MIPs).\n   A G-ACh\
    \ packet may be directed to an individual MIP along the path of\n   an LSP or\
    \ MS-PW by setting the appropriate TTL in the label stack\n   entry for the G-ACh\
    \ packet, as per the traceroute mode of LSP Ping\n   [RFC4379] and the vccv-trace\
    \ mode of [SEGMENTED-PW].  Note that this\n   works when the location of MIPs\
    \ along the LSP or PW path is known by\n   the MEP.  There may be circumstances\
    \ where this is not the case,\n   e.g., following restoration using a facility\
    \ bypass LSP.  In these\n   cases, tools to trace the path of the LSP may be used\
    \ to determine\n   the appropriate setting for the TTL to reach a specific MIP.\n\
    \   Within an LSR or PE, MEPs and MIPs can only be placed where MPLS\n   layer\
    \ processing is performed on a packet.  The MPLS architecture\n   mandates that\
    \ MPLS layer processing occurs at least once on an LSR.\n   Any node on an LSP\
    \ can send an OAM packet on that LSP.  Likewise, any\n   node on a PW can send\
    \ OAM packets on a PW, including S-PEs.\n   An OAM packet can only be received\
    \ to be processed at an LSP\n   endpoint, a PW endpoint (T-PE), or on the expiry\
    \ of the TTL in the\n   LSP or PW label stack entry.\n"

    \ control plane is based on existing MPLS and PW control\n   plane protocols,\
    \ and is consistent with the Automatically Switched\n   Optical Network (ASON)\
    \ architecture [G.8080].  MPLS-TP uses:\n   o  Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signaling\
    \ ([RFC3945], [RFC3471],\n      [RFC3473]) for LSPs, and\n   o  Targeted LDP (T-LDP)\
    \ signaling ([RFC4447], [SEGMENTED-PW],\n      [DYN-MS-PW]) for pseudowires.\n\
    \   MPLS-TP requires that any control-plane traffic be capable of being\n   carried\
    \ over an out-of-band signaling network or a signaling control\n   channel such\
    \ as the one described in [RFC5718].  Note that while\n   T-LDP signaling is traditionally\
    \ carried in-band in IP/MPLS networks,\n   this does not preclude its operation\
    \ over out-of-band channels.\n   References to T-LDP in this document do not preclude\
    \ the definition\n   of alternative PW control protocols for use in MPLS-TP.\n\
    \   PW control (and maintenance) takes place separately from LSP tunnel\n   signaling.\
    \  The main coordination between LSP and PW control will\n   occur within the\
    \ nodes that terminate PWs.  The control planes for\n   PWs and LSPs may be used\
    \ independently, and one may be employed\n   without the other.  This translates\
    \ into the four possible scenarios:\n   (1) no control plane is employed; (2)\
    \ a control plane is used for\n   both LSPs and PWs; (3) a control plane is used\
    \ for LSPs, but not PWs;\n   (4) a control plane is used for PWs, but not LSPs.\
    \  The PW and LSP\n   control planes, collectively, need to satisfy the MPLS-TP\
    \ control\n   plane requirements reviewed in the MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework\n\
    \   [CP-FRAMEWORK].  When client services are provided directly via LSPs,\n  \
    \ all requirements must be satisfied by the LSP control plane.  When\n   client\
    \ services are provided via PWs, the PW and LSP control planes\n   operate in\
    \ combination, and some functions may be satisfied via the\n   PW control plane,\
    \ while others are provided to PWs by the LSP control\n   plane.\n   Note that\
    \ if MPLS-TP is being used in a multi-layer network, a number\n   of control protocol\
    \ types and instances may be used.  This is\n   consistent with the MPLS architecture,\
    \ which permits each label in\n   the label stack to be allocated and signaled\
    \ by its own control\n   protocol.\n   The distributed MPLS-TP control plane may\
    \ provide the following\n   functions:\n   o  Signaling\n   o  Routing\n   o \
    \ Traffic engineering and constraint-based path computation\n   In a multi-domain\
    \ environment, the MPLS-TP control plane supports\n   different types of interfaces\
    \ at domain boundaries or within the\n   domains.  These include the User-Network\
    \ Interface (UNI), Internal\n   Network-Network Interface (I-NNI), and External\
    \ Network-Network\n   Interface (E-NNI).  Note that different policies may be\
    \ defined that\n   control the information exchanged across these interface types.\n\
    \   The MPLS-TP control plane is capable of activating MPLS-TP OAM\n   functions\
    \ as described in the OAM section of this document\n   Section 3.7, e.g., for\
    \ fault detection and localization in the event\n   of a failure in order to efficiently\
    \ restore failed transport paths.\n   The MPLS-TP control plane supports all MPLS-TP\
    \ data-plane\n   connectivity patterns that are needed for establishing transport\n\
    \   paths, including protected paths as described in Section 3.12.\n   Examples\
    \ of the MPLS-TP data-plane connectivity patterns are LSPs\n   utilizing the fast\
    \ reroute backup methods as defined in [RFC4090] and\n   ingress-to-egress 1+1\
    \ or 1:1 protected LSPs.\n   The MPLS-TP control plane provides functions to ensure\
    \ its own\n   survivability and to enable it to recover gracefully from failures\n\
    \   and degradations.  These include graceful restart and hot redundant\n   configurations.\
    \  Depending on how the control plane is transported,\n   varying degrees of decoupling\
    \ between the control plane and data\n   plane may be achieved.  In all cases,\
    \ however, the control plane is\n   logically decoupled from the data plane such\
    \ that a control-plane\n   failure does not imply a failure of the existing transport\
    \ paths.\n"

    \   as part of the MPLS/PW paradigms, MPLS provides methods for local\n   repair\
    \ using back-up LSP tunnels ([RFC4090]), while pseudowire\n   redundancy [PW-REDUNDANCY]\
    \ supports scenarios where the protection\n   for the PW cannot be fully provided\

    \ of the S-PE\n   is required).  Additionally, GMPLS provides a well-known set\
    \ of\n   control-plane-driven protection and restoration mechanisms [RFC4872].\n\

    \ as follows:\n   o  Optimized for linear, ring, or meshed topologies.\n   o \

    \   o  Include protection mechanisms to coordinate and trigger protection\n  \
    \    switching actions in the absence of a dynamic control plane.\n   o  MPLS-TP\
    \ recovery schemes are applicable to all levels in the\n      MPLS-TP domain (i.e.,\
    \ section, LSP, and PW) providing segment and\n      end-to-end recovery.\n  \
    \ o  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms support the coordination of protection\n    \
    \  switching at multiple levels to prevent race conditions occurring\n      between\
    \ a client and its server layer.\n   o  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms can be data-plane,\

  contents:
  - "3.14.  Network Management\n   The network management architecture and requirements\
    \ for MPLS-TP are\n   specified in [NM-FRAMEWORK] and [NM-REQ].  These derive\
    \ from the\n   generic specifications described in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [G.7710]\
    \ for\n   transport technologies.  They also incorporate the OAM requirements\n\
    \   for MPLS Networks [RFC4377] and MPLS-TP Networks [RFC5860] and expand\n  \
    \ on those requirements to cover the modifications necessary for fault,\n   configuration,\
    \ performance, and security in a transport network.\n   The Equipment Management\
    \ Function (EMF) of an MPLS-TP Network Element\n   (NE) (i.e., LSR, LER, PE, S-PE,\
    \ or T-PE) provides the means through\n   which a management system manages the\
    \ NE.  The Management\n   Communication Channel (MCC), realized by the G-ACh,\
    \ provides a\n   logical operations channel between NEs for transferring management\n\
    \   information.  The Network Management System (NMS) can be used to\n   provision\
    \ and manage an end-to-end connection across a network.\n   Maintenance operations\
    \ are run on a connection (LSP or PW) in a\n   manner that is independent of the\
    \ provisioning mechanism.  Segments\n   may be created or managed by, for example,\
    \ Netconf [RFC4741], SNMP\n   [RFC3411], or CORBA (Common Object Request Broker\
    \ Architecture)\n   interfaces, but not all segments need to be created or managed\
    \ using\n   the same type of interface.  Where an MPLS-TP NE is managed by an\n\
    \   NMS, at least one of these standard management mechanisms is required\n  \
    \ for interoperability, but this document imposes no restriction on\n   which\
    \ of these standard management protocols is used.  In MPLS-TP,\n   the EMF needs\

    \ PE, as well as any associated MEPs and MIPs, as\n   per Section 3.11.\n   Fault\
    \ Management (FM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-TP NE\n   enable the supervision,\
    \ detection, validation, isolation, correction,\n   and alarm handling of abnormal\

    \ for the supervision of\n   transmission (such as continuity, connectivity, etc.),\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The introduction of MPLS-TP into transport networks\
    \ means that the\n   security considerations applicable to both MPLS [RFC3031]\
    \ and PWE3\n   [RFC3985] apply to those transport networks.  When an MPLS function\n\
    \   is included in the MPLS transport profile, the security\n   considerations\
    \ pertinent to that function apply to MPLS-TP.\n   Furthermore, when general MPLS\
    \ networks that utilize functionality\n   outside of the strict MPLS Transport\
    \ Profile are used to support\n   packet transport services, the security considerations\
    \ of that\n   additional functionality also apply.\n   For pseudowires, the security\
    \ considerations of [RFC3985] and\n   [RFC5659] apply.\n   MPLS-TP nodes that\
    \ implement the G-ACh create a Control Channel (CC)\n   associated with a pseudowire,\
    \ LSP, or section.  This control channel\n   can be signaled or statically configured.\
    \  Over this control channel,\n   control channel messages related to network\
    \ maintenance functions\n   such as OAM, signaling, or network management are\
    \ sent.  Therefore,\n   three different areas are of concern from a security standpoint.\n\
    \   The first area of concern relates to control plane parameter and\n   status\
    \ message attacks, that is, attacks that concern the signaling\n   of G-ACh capabilities.\
    \  MPLS-TP Control Plane security is discussed\n   in [RFC5920].\n   A second\
    \ area of concern centers on data-plane attacks, that is,\n   attacks on the G-ACh\
    \ itself.  MPLS-TP nodes that implement the G-ACh\n   mechanisms are subject to\
    \ additional data-plane denial-of-service\n   attacks as follows:\n      An intruder\
    \ could intercept or inject G-ACh packets effectively\n      disrupting the protocols\
    \ carried over the G-ACh.\n      An intruder could deliberately flood a peer MPLS-TP\
    \ node with\n      G-ACh messages to deny services to others.\n      A misconfigured\
    \ or misbehaving device could inadvertently flood a\n      peer MPLS-TP node with\
    \ G-ACh messages that could result in denial\n      of services.  In particular,\
    \ if a node has either implicitly or\n      explicitly indicated that it cannot\
    \ support one or all of the\n      types of G-ACh protocol, but is sent those\
    \ messages in sufficient\n      quantity, it could result in a denial of service.\n\
    \   To protect against these potential (deliberate or unintentional)\n   attacks,\
    \ multiple mitigation techniques can be employed:\n      G-ACh message throttling\
    \ mechanisms can be used, especially in\n      distributed implementations that\
    \ have a centralized control-plane\n      processor with various line cards attached\
    \ by some control-plane\n      data path.  In these architectures, G-ACh messages\
    \ may be\n      processed on the central processor after being forwarded there\
    \ by\n      the receiving line card.  In this case, the path between the line\n\
    \      card and the control processor may become saturated if appropriate\n  \
    \    G-ACh traffic throttling is not employed, which could lead to a\n      complete\
    \ denial of service to users of the particular line card.\n      Such filtering\
    \ is also useful for preventing the processing of\n      unwanted G-ACh messages,\
    \ such as those which are sent on unwanted\n      (and perhaps unadvertised) control\
    \ channel types.\n   A third and last area of concern relates to the processing\
    \ of the\n   actual contents of G-ACh messages.  It is necessary that the\n  \
    \ definition of the protocols using these messages carried over a G-ACh\n   include\
    \ appropriate security measures.\n   Additional security considerations apply\
    \ to each MPLS-TP solution.\n   These are discussed further in [SEC-FRAMEWORK].\n\
    \   The security considerations in [RFC5920] apply.\n"
