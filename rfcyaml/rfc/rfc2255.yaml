  - "IESG NOTE\n   This document describes a directory access protocol that provides\n\
    \   both read and update access.  Update access requires secure\n   authentication,\
    \ but this document does not mandate implementation of\n   any satisfactory authentication\
    \ mechanisms.\n   In accordance with RFC 2026, section 4.4.1, this specification\
    \ is\n   being approved by IESG as a Proposed Standard despite this\n   limitation,\
    \ for the following reasons:\n   a. to encourage implementation and interoperability\
    \ testing of\n      these protocols (with or without update access) before they\n\
    \      are deployed, and\n   b. to encourage deployment and use of these protocols\
    \ in read-only\n      applications.  (e.g. applications where LDAPv3 is used as\n\
    \      a query language for directories which are updated by some\n      secure\
    \ mechanism other than LDAP), and\n   c. to avoid delaying the advancement and\
    \ deployment of other Internet\n      standards-track protocols which require\
    \ the ability to query, but\n      not update, LDAPv3 directory servers.\n   Readers\
    \ are hereby warned that until mandatory authentication\n   mechanisms are standardized,\
    \ clients and servers written according to\n   this specification which make use\
    \ of update functionality are\n   UNLIKELY TO INTEROPERATE, or MAY INTEROPERATE\
    \ ONLY IF AUTHENTICATION\n   IS REDUCED TO AN UNACCEPTABLY WEAK LEVEL.\n   Implementors\
    \ are hereby discouraged from deploying LDAPv3 clients or\n   servers which implement\
    \ the update functionality, until a Proposed\n   Standard for mandatory authentication\
    \ in LDAPv3 has been approved and\n   published as an RFC.\n"
- title: 2. Abstract
  contents:
  - "2. Abstract\n   LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, defined in\
    \ [1],\n   [2] and [3].  This document describes a format for an LDAP Uniform\n\
    \   Resource Locator.  The format describes an LDAP search operation to\n   perform\
    \ to retrieve information from an LDAP directory. This document\n   replaces RFC\
    \ 1959. It updates the LDAP URL format for version 3 of\n   LDAP and clarifies\
    \ how LDAP URLs are resolved. This document also\n   defines an extension mechanism\
    \ for LDAP URLs, so that future\n   documents can extend their functionality,\
    \ for example, to provide\n   access to new LDAPv3 extensions as they are defined.\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MAY\", and \"SHOULD\" used in this document are\n\
    \   to be interpreted as described in [6].\n"
- title: 3. URL Definition
  contents:
  - "3. URL Definition\n   An LDAP URL begins with the protocol prefix \"ldap\" and\
    \ is defined by\n   the following grammar.\n       ldapurl    = scheme \"://\"\
    \ [hostport] [\"/\"\n                    [dn [\"?\" [attributes] [\"?\" [scope]\n\
    \                    [\"?\" [filter] [\"?\" extensions]]]]]]\n       scheme  \
    \   = \"ldap\"\n       attributes = attrdesc *(\",\" attrdesc)\n       scope \
    \     = \"base\" / \"one\" / \"sub\"\n       dn         = distinguishedName from\
    \ Section 3 of [1]\n       hostport   = hostport from Section 5 of RFC 1738 [5]\n\
    \       attrdesc   = AttributeDescription from Section 4.1.5 of [2]\n       filter\
    \     = filter from Section 4 of [4]\n       extensions = extension *(\",\" extension)\n\
    \       extension  = [\"!\"] extype [\"=\" exvalue]\n       extype     = token\
    \ / xtoken\n       exvalue    = LDAPString from section 4.1.2 of [2]\n       token\
    \      = oid from section 4.1 of [3]\n       xtoken     = (\"X-\" / \"x-\") token\n\
    \   The \"ldap\" prefix indicates an entry or entries residing in the LDAP\n \
    \  server running on the given hostname at the given portnumber. The\n   default\
    \ LDAP port is TCP port 389. If no hostport is given, the\n   client must have\
    \ some apriori knowledge of an appropriate LDAP server\n   to contact.\n   The\
    \ dn is an LDAP Distinguished Name using the string format\n   described in [1].\
    \ It identifies the base object of the LDAP search.\n   ldapurl    = scheme \"\

    \     = filter from Section 4 of [4]\n       extensions = extension *(\",\" extension)\n\
    \       extension  = [\"!\"] extype [\"=\" exvalue]\n       extype     = token\
    \ / xtoken\n       exvalue    = LDAPString from section 4.1.2 of [2]\n       token\
    \      = oid from section 4.1 of [3]\n       xtoken     = (\"X-\" / \"x-\") token\n\
    \   The \"ldap\" prefix indicates an entry or entries residing in the LDAP\n \
    \  server running on the given hostname at the given portnumber. The\n   default\
    \ LDAP port is TCP port 389. If no hostport is given, the\n   client must have\
    \ some apriori knowledge of an appropriate LDAP server\n   to contact.\n   The\
    \ dn is an LDAP Distinguished Name using the string format\n   described in [1].\
    \ It identifies the base object of the LDAP search.\n   The attributes construct\
    \ is used to indicate which attributes should\n   be returned from the entry or\
    \ entries.  Individual attrdesc names are\n   as defined for AttributeDescription\
    \ in [2].  If the attributes part\n   is omitted, all user attributes of the entry\
    \ or entries should be\n   requested (e.g., by setting the attributes field\n\
    \   AttributeDescriptionList in the LDAP search request to a NULL list,\n   or\
    \ (in LDAPv3) by requesting the special attribute name \"*\").\n   The scope construct\
    \ is used to specify the scope of the search to\n   perform in the given LDAP\
    \ server.  The allowable scopes are \"base\"\n   for a base object search, \"\
    one\" for a one-level search, or \"sub\" for\n   a subtree search.  If scope is\
    \ omitted, a scope of \"base\" is assumed.\n   The filter is used to specify the\
    \ search filter to apply to entries\n   within the specified scope during the\
    \ search.  It has the format\n   specified in [4].  If filter is omitted, a filter\
    \ of\n   \"(objectClass=*)\" is assumed.\n   The extensions construct provides\
    \ the LDAP URL with an extensibility\n   mechanism, allowing the capabilities\
    \ of the URL to be extended in the\n   future. Extensions are a simple comma-separated\
    \ list of type=value\n   pairs, where the =value portion MAY be omitted for options\
    \ not\n   requiring it. Each type=value pair is a separate extension. These\n\
    \   LDAP URL extensions are not necessarily related to any of the LDAPv3\n   extension\
    \ mechanisms. Extensions may be supported or unsupported by\n   the client resolving\
    \ the URL. An extension prefixed with a '!'\n   character (ASCII 33) is critical.\
    \ An extension not prefixed with a '\n   !'  character is non-critical.\n   If\
    \ an extension is supported by the client, the client MUST obey the\n   extension\
    \ if the extension is critical. The client SHOULD obey\n   supported extensions\
    \ that are non-critical.\n   If an extension is unsupported by the client, the\
    \ client MUST NOT\n   process the URL if the extension is critical.  If an unsupported\n\
    \   extension is non-critical, the client MUST ignore the extension.\n   If a\
    \ critical extension cannot be processed successfully by the\n   client, the client\
    \ MUST NOT process the URL. If a non-critical\n   extension cannot be processed\
    \ successfully by the client, the client\n   SHOULD ignore the extension.\n  \
    \ Extension types prefixed by \"X-\" or \"x-\" are reserved for use in\n   bilateral\
    \ agreements between communicating parties. Other extension\n   types MUST be\
    \ defined in this document, or in other standards-track\n   documents.\n   One\
    \ LDAP URL extension is defined in this document in the next\n   section.  Other\
    \ documents or a future version of this document MAY\n   define other extensions.\n\
    \   Note that any URL-illegal characters (e.g., spaces), URL special\n   characters\
    \ (as defined in section 2.2 of RFC 1738) and the reserved\n   character '?' (ASCII\
    \ 63) occurring inside a dn, filter, or other\n   element of an LDAP URL MUST\
    \ be escaped using the % method described\n   in RFC 1738 [5]. If a comma character\
    \ ',' occurs inside an extension\n   value, the character MUST also be escaped\
    \ using the % method.\n"
- title: 4. The Bindname Extension
  contents:
  - "4. The Bindname Extension\n   This section defines an LDAP URL extension for\
    \ representing the\n   distinguished name for a client to use when authenticating\
    \ to an LDAP\n   directory during resolution of an LDAP URL. Clients MAY implement\n\
    \   this extension.\n   The extension type is \"bindname\". The extension value\
    \ is the\n   distinguished name of the directory entry to authenticate as, in\
    \ the\n   same form as described for dn in the grammar above. The dn may be the\n\
    \   NULL string to specify unauthenticated access. The extension may be\n   either\
    \ critical (prefixed with a '!' character) or non-critical (not\n   prefixed with\
    \ a '!' character).\n   If the bindname extension is critical, the client resolving\
    \ the URL\n   MUST authenticate to the directory using the given distinguished\
    \ name\n   and an appropriate authentication method. Note that for a NULL\n  \
    \ distinguished name, no bind MAY be required to obtain anonymous\n   access to\
    \ the directory. If the extension is non-critical, the client\n   MAY bind to\
    \ the directory using the given distinguished name.\n"
- title: 5. URL Processing
  contents:
  - "5. URL Processing\n   This section describes how an LDAP URL SHOULD be resolved\
    \ by a\n   client.\n   First, the client obtains a connection to the LDAP server\
    \ referenced\n   in the URL, or an LDAP server of the client's choice if no LDAP\n\
    \   server is explicitly referenced.  This connection MAY be opened\n   specifically\
    \ for the purpose of resolving the URL or the client MAY\n   reuse an already\
    \ open connection. The connection MAY provide\n   confidentiality, integrity,\
    \ or other services, e.g., using TLS. Use\n   of security services is at the client's\
    \ discretion if not specified\n   in the URL.\n   Next, the client authenticates\
    \ itself to the LDAP server.  This step\n   is optional, unless the URL contains\
    \ a critical bindname extension\n   with a non-NULL value. If a bindname extension\
    \ is given, the client\n   proceeds according to the section above.\n   If a bindname\
    \ extension is not specified, the client MAY bind to the\n   directory using a\
    \ appropriate dn and authentication method of its own\n   choosing (including\
    \ NULL authentication).\n   Next, the client performs the LDAP search operation\
    \ specified in the\n   URL. Additional fields in the LDAP protocol search request,\
    \ such as\n   sizelimit, timelimit, deref, and anything else not specified or\n\
    \   defaulted in the URL specification, MAY be set at the client's\n   discretion.\n\
    \   Once the search has completed, the client MAY close the connection to\n  \
    \ the LDAP server, or the client MAY keep the connection open for\n   future use.\n"
- title: 6. Examples
  contents:
  - "6. Examples\n   The following are some example LDAP URLs using the format defined\n\
    \   above.  The first example is an LDAP URL referring to the University\n   of\
    \ Michigan entry, available from an LDAP server of the client's\n   choosing:\n\
    \     ldap:///o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US\n   The next example is an LDAP\
    \ URL referring to the University of\n   Michigan entry in a particular ldap server:\n\
    \     ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,c=US\n   Both of\
    \ these URLs correspond to a base object search of the\n   \"o=University of Michigan,\
    \ c=US\" entry using a filter of\n   \"(objectclass=*)\", requesting all attributes.\n\
    \   The next example is an LDAP URL referring to only the postalAddress\n   attribute\
    \ of the University of Michigan entry:\n     ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/o=University%20of%20Michigan,\n\
    \            c=US?postalAddress\n   The corresponding LDAP search operation is\
    \ the same as in the\n   previous example, except that only the postalAddress\
    \ attribute is\n   requested.\n   The next example is an LDAP URL referring to\
    \ the set of entries found\n   by querying the given LDAP server on port 6666\
    \ and doing a subtree\n   search of the University of Michigan for any entry with\
    \ a common name\n   of \"Babs Jensen\", retrieving all attributes:\n     ldap://host.com:6666/o=University%20of%20Michigan,\n\
    \            c=US??sub?(cn=Babs%20Jensen)\n   The next example is an LDAP URL\
    \ referring to all children of the c=GB\n   entry:\n     ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/c=GB?objectClass?one\n\
    \   The objectClass attribute is requested to be returned along with the\n   entries,\
    \ and the default filter of \"(objectclass=*)\" is used.\n   The next example\
    \ is an LDAP URL to retrieve the mail attribute for\n   the LDAP entry named \"\
    o=Question?,c=US\" is given below, illustrating\n   the use of the escaping mechanism\
    \ on the reserved character '?'.\n     ldap://ldap.question.com/o=Question%3f,c=US?mail\n\
    \   The next example illustrates the interaction between LDAP and URL\n   quoting\
    \ mechanisms.\n     ldap://ldap.netscape.com/o=Babsco,c=US??(int=%5c00%5c00%5c00%5c04)\n\
    \   The filter in this example uses the LDAP escaping mechanism of \\ to\n   encode\
    \ three zero or null bytes in the value. In LDAP, the filter\n   would be written\
    \ as (int=\\00\\00\\00\\04). Because the \\ character must\n   be escaped in a\
    \ URL, the \\'s are escaped as %5c in the URL encoding.\n   The final example\
    \ shows the use of the bindname extension to specify\n   the dn a client should\
    \ use for authentication when resolving the URL.\n     ldap:///??sub??bindname=cn=Manager%2co=Foo\n\
    \     ldap:///??sub??!bindname=cn=Manager%2co=Foo\n   The two URLs are the same,\
    \ except that the second one marks the\n   bindname extension as critical. Notice\
    \ the use of the % encoding\n   method to encode the comma in the distinguished\
    \ name value in the\n   bindname extension.\n"
- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   General URL security considerations discussed\
    \ in [5] are relevant for\n   LDAP URLs.\n   The use of security mechanisms when\
    \ processing LDAP URLs requires\n   particular care, since clients may encounter\
    \ many different servers\n   via URLs, and since URLs are likely to be processed\
    \ automatically,\n   without user intervention. A client SHOULD have a user-configurable\n\
    \   policy about which servers to connect to using which security\n   mechanisms,\
    \ and SHOULD NOT make connections that are inconsistent\n   with this policy.\n\
    \   Sending authentication information, no matter the mechanism, may\n   violate\
    \ a user's privacy requirements.  In the absence of specific\n   policy permitting\
    \ authentication information to be sent to a server,\n   a client should use an\
    \ anonymous connection.  (Note that clients\n   conforming to previous LDAP URL\
    \ specifications, where all connections\n   are anonymous and unprotected, are\
    \ consistent with this\n   specification; they simply have the default security\
    \ policy.)\n   Some authentication methods, in particular reusable passwords sent\
    \ to\n   the server, may reveal easily-abused information to the remote server\n\
    \   or to eavesdroppers in transit, and should not be used in URL\n   processing\
    \ unless explicitly permitted by policy.  Confirmation by\n   the human user of\
    \ the use of authentication information is\n   appropriate in many circumstances.\
    \  Use of strong authentication\n   methods that do not reveal sensitive information\
    \ is much preferred.\n   The LDAP URL format allows the specification of an arbitrary\
    \ LDAP\n   search operation to be performed when evaluating the LDAP URL.\n  \
    \ Following an LDAP URL may cause unexpected results, for example, the\n   retrieval\
    \ of large amounts of data, the initiation of a long-lived\n   search, etc.  The\
    \ security implications of resolving an LDAP URL are\n   the same as those of\
    \ resolving an LDAP search query.\n"
