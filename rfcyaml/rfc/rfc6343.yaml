  - "1.  Introduction\n   A technique for automatic tunneling of IPv6 over IPv4, intended\
    \ for\n   situations where a user may wish to access IPv6-based services via a\n\
    \   network that does not support IPv6, was defined a number of years\n   ago.\
    \  It is known as 6to4 [RFC3056] [RFC3068] and is quite widely\n   deployed in\
    \ end systems, especially desktop and laptop computers.\n   Also, 6to4 is supported\
    \ in a number of popular models of CPE routers,\n   some of which have it enabled\
    \ by default, leading to quite widespread\n   unintentional deployment by end\
    \ users.\n   Unfortunately, experience shows that the method has some problems\
    \ in\n   current deployments that can lead to connectivity failures.  These\n\
    \   failures cause either long retry delays or complete failures for\n   users\
    \ trying to connect to services.  In many cases, the user may be\n   quite unaware\
    \ that 6to4 is in use; when the user contacts a help\n   desk, in all probability\
    \ the help desk is unable to correctly\n   diagnose the problem.  Anecdotally,\
    \ many help desks simply advise\n   users to disable IPv6, thus defeating the\
    \ whole purpose of the\n   mechanism, which was to encourage early adoption of\
    \ IPv6.\n   The main goal of the present document is to offer advice to network\n\
    \   operators on how to deal with this situation more constructively than\n  \
    \ by disabling 6to4.  It briefly describes the principle of operation,\n   then\
    \ describes the problems observed, and finally offers specific\n   advice on the\
    \ available methods of avoiding the problems.  Note that\n   some of this advice\
    \ applies to ISPs that do not yet support IPv6,\n   since their customers and\
    \ help desks are significantly affected in\n   any case.\n   Other advice applies\
    \ to content providers and implementers, but this\n   document does not discuss\
    \ aspects that are mainly outside the scope\n   of network operators:\n   1. \
    \ Operating system preferences between IPv4 and IPv6 when both\n       appear\
    \ to be available [RFC3484-REVISE].\n   2.  Ensuring that application software\
    \ deals gracefully with\n       connectivity problems [EYEBALLS-IPV6].\n   3.\
    \  Some content providers have chosen to avoid the problem by hiding\n       their\
    \ IPv6 address except from customers of pre-qualified\n       networks [DNSWHITE].\n\
    \   A companion document [HISTORIC] proposes to reclassify 6to4 as\n   Historic.\
    \  However, this will not remove the millions of existing\n   hosts and CPEs that\
    \ implement 6to4.  Hence, the advice in this\n   document remains necessary.\n"
- title: 2.  Principles of Operation
  contents:
  - "2.  Principles of Operation\n   There are two variants of 6to4 that are referred\
    \ to here as \"Router\n   6to4\" and \"Anycast 6to4\".  To understand Anycast\
    \ 6to4, it is\n   necessary first to understand Router 6to4.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Router 6to4
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Router 6to4\n   Router 6to4 is the original version, documented in [RFC3056].\
    \  The\n   model assumes that a user site operates native IPv6, but that its ISP\n\
    \   provides no IPv6 service.  The site border router acts as a 6to4\n   router.\
    \  If its external global 32-bit IPv4 address is V4ADDR, the\n   site automatically\
    \ inherits the IPv6 prefix 2002:V4ADDR::/48.  (The\n   explanation in RFC 3056\
    \ is somewhat confusing, as it refers to the\n   obsolete \"Top Level Aggregator\"\
    \ terminology.)  The prefix 2002:\n   V4ADDR::/48 will be used and delegated for\
    \ IPv6 service within the\n   user site.\n   Consider two such site border routers,\
    \ with global IPv4 addresses\n   192.0.2.170 and 192.0.2.187, and that therefore\
    \ inherit the IPv6\n   prefixes 2002:c000:2aa::/48 and 2002:c000:2bb::/48, respectively.\n\
    \   The routers can exchange IPv6 packets by encapsulating them in IPv4\n   using\
    \ protocol number 41, and sending them to each other at their\n   respective IPv4\
    \ addresses.  In fact, any number of 6to4 routers\n   connected to the IPv4 network\
    \ can directly exchange IPv6 packets in\n   this way.\n   Some 6to4 routers are\
    \ also configured as \"relay routers\".  They\n   behave as just described, but,\
    \ in addition, they obtain native IPv6\n   connectivity with a normal IPv6 prefix.\
    \  They announce an IPv6 route\n   to 2002::/16.  For example, assume that the\
    \ 6to4 router at\n   192.0.2.187 is a relay router, whose address on the 6to4\
    \ side is\n   2002:c000:2bb::1.  Suppose that a host with the 6to4 address 2002:\n\
    \   c000:2aa::123 sends an IPv6 packet to a native IPv6 destination such\n   as\
    \ 2001:db8:123:456::321.  Assume that the 6to4 router at 192.0.2.170\n   has its\
    \ IPv6 default route set to 2002:c000:2bb::1, i.e., the relay.\n   The packet\
    \ will be delivered to the relay, encapsulated in IPv4.  The\n   relay will decapsulate\
    \ the packet and forward it into native IPv6 for\n   delivery.  When the remote\
    \ host replies, the packet (source 2001:db8:\n   123:456::321, destination 2002:c000:2aa::123)\
    \ will find a route to\n   2002::/16, and hence be delivered to a 6to4 relay.\
    \  The process will\n   be reversed and the packet will be encapsulated and forwarded\
    \ to the\n   6to4 router at 192.0.2.170 for final delivery.\n   Note that this\
    \ process does not require the same relay to be used in\n   both directions. \
    \ The outbound packet will go to whichever relay is\n   configured as the default\
    \ IPv6 router at the source router, and the\n   return packet will go to whichever\
    \ relay is announcing a route to\n   2002::/16 in the vicinity of the remote IPv6\
    \ host.\n   Of course, there are many further details in RFC 3056, most of which\n\
    \   are irrelevant to current operational problems.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Anycast 6to4
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Anycast 6to4\n   Router 6to4 assumes that 6to4 routers and relays will\
    \ be managed and\n   configured cooperatively.  In particular, 6to4 sites need\
    \ to\n   configure a relay router willing to carry their outbound traffic,\n \
    \  which becomes their default IPv6 router (except for 2002::/16).  The\n   objective\
    \ of the anycast variant, defined in [RFC3068], is to avoid\n   any need for such\
    \ configuration.  The intention was to make the\n   solution available for small\
    \ or domestic users, even those with a\n   single host or simple home gateway\
    \ rather than a border router.  This\n   is achieved quite simply, by defining\
    \ 192.88.99.1 as the default IPv4\n   address for a 6to4 relay, and therefore\
    \ 2002:c058:6301:: as the\n   default IPv6 router address for a 6to4 site.\n \
    \  Since Anycast 6to4 implies a default configuration for the user site,\n   it\
    \ does not require any particular user action.  It does require an\n   IPv4 anycast\
    \ route to be in place to a relay at 192.88.99.1.  As with\n   Router 6to4, there\
    \ is no requirement that the return path goes\n   through the same relay.\n"
- title: 3.  Problems Observed
  contents:
  - "3.  Problems Observed\n   It should be noted that Router 6to4 was not designed\
    \ to be an\n   unmanaged solution.  Quite the contrary: RFC 3056 contains a number\n\
    \   of operational recommendations intended to avoid routing issues.  In\n   practice,\
    \ there are few if any deployments of Router 6to4 following\n   these recommendations.\
    \  Mostly, Anycast 6to4 has been deployed.  In\n   this case, the user site (either\
    \ a single host or a small broadband\n   gateway) discovers that it doesn't have\
    \ native IPv6 connectivity, but\n   that it does have a global IPv4 address and\
    \ can resolve AAAA queries.\n   Therefore, it assumes that it can send 6to4 packets\
    \ to 192.88.99.1.\n   Empirically, 6to4 appears to suffer from a significant level\
    \ of\n   connection failure; see [Aben] and [Huston-a].  In experiments\n   conducted\
    \ on a number of dual-stack web servers, the TCP connection\n   failure rate has\
    \ been measured.  In these experiments, the client's\n   connection attempt to\
    \ a server was considered to have failed when the\n   server received a TCP SYN\
    \ packet and sent a SYN/ACK packet in\n   response, but received no ACK packet\
    \ to complete the initial TCP\n   three-way handshake.  The experiment conducted\
    \ by Aben recorded a\n   failure rate of between 9% and 20% of all 6to4 connection\
    \ attempts.\n   The experiment conducted by Huston has recorded a failure rate\
    \ of\n   between 9% and 19% of all 6to4 clients.  In this latter experiment,\n\
    \   it was further noted that between 65% to 80% of all 6to4 clients who\n   failed\
    \ to connect using 6to4 were able to make a successful\n   connection using IPv4,\
    \ while the remainder did not make any form of\n   IPv4 connection attempt, successful\
    \ or otherwise, using the mapped\n   IPv4 address as a source address.  No connection\
    \ attempts using\n   embedded RFC 1918 IPv4 addresses were recorded by the server.\n\
    \   There have been several possible reasons offered for this form of\n   6to4\
    \ connection failure.  One is the use of private IPv4 addresses\n   embedded in\
    \ the 6to4 address, making the return path for the 6to4\n   tunnel infeasible,\
    \ and the second is the use of local filters and\n   firewalls that drop incoming\
    \ IP packets that use IP protocol 41.  If\n   the former case were prevalent,\
    \ it would be reasonable to expect that\n   a significant proportion of failed\
    \ 6to4 connections would use\n   embedded IPv4 addresses that are either drawn\
    \ from the private use\n   (RFC 1918) address ranges, contrary to RFC 3056, or\
    \ from addresses\n   that are not announced in the Internet's IPv4 inter-domain\
    \ routing\n   table.  Neither case was observed to any significant volume in the\n\
    \   experiments conducted by Huston.  Furthermore, the experimental\n   conditions\
    \ were varied to use a return 6to4 tunnel with either the\n   native IPv4 source\
    \ address of the dual-stack server or an IPv4 source\n   address of 192.88.99.1.\
    \  No change in the 6to4 connection failure\n   rate was observed between these\
    \ two configurations; however, other\n   operators have reported significant problems\
    \ when replying from the\n   native address, caused by stateful firewalls at the\
    \ user site.  Given\n   that the server used its own 6to4 relay for the return\
    \ path, the only\n   difference in the IP packet itself between the successful\
    \ IPv4\n   connections and the failed 6to4 connections was the IP protocol\n \
    \  number, which was 6 (TCP) for the successful IPv4 connections and 41\n   (IPv6\
    \ payload) for the failed 6to4 connections.  The inference from\n   these experiments\
    \ is that one likely reason for the high connection\n   failure rate for 6to4\
    \ connections is the use of local filters close\n   to the end user that block\
    \ incoming packets with protocol 41, in some\n   cases made worse by stateful\
    \ firewalls if the source address is not\n   192.88.99.1.\n   In a dual-stack\
    \ context, this connection failure rate was effectively\n   masked by the ability\
    \ of the client system to recover from the\n   failure and make a successful connection\
    \ using IPv4.  In this case,\n   the only effect on the client system was a delay\
    \ in making the\n   connection of between 7 and 20 seconds as the client's system\
    \ timed\n   out on the 6to4 connection attempts (see [EYEBALLS-IPV6]).\n   This\
    \ experience, and further analysis, shows that specific\n   operational problems\
    \ with Anycast 6to4 include:\n   1.  Outbound Black Hole: 192.88.99.1 does not\
    \ generate 'destination\n       unreachable' but in fact packets sent to that\
    \ address are\n       dropped.  This can happen due to routing or firewall\n \
    \      configuration, or even because the relay that the packets happen\n    \
    \   to reach contains an ACL such that they are discarded.\n       This class\
    \ of problem arises because the user's ISP is accepting\n       a route to 192.88.99.0/24\
    \ despite the fact that it doesn't go\n       anywhere useful.  Either the user\
    \ site or its ISP is dropping\n       outbound protocol 41 traffic, or the upstream\
    \ operator is\n       unwilling to accept incoming 6to4 packets from the user's\
    \ ISP.\n       The latter is superficially compatible with the design of Router\n\
    \       6to4 (referred to as \"unwilling to relay\" in RFC 3056).  However,\n\
    \       the simple fact of announcing a route to 192.88.99.0/24 in IPv4,\n   \
    \    coupled with the behavior described in RFC 3068, amounts to\n       announcing\
    \ a default route for IPv6 to all 6to4 sites that\n       receive the IPv4 route.\
    \  This violates the assumptions of RFC\n       3056.\n       The effect of this\
    \ problem on users is that their IPv6 stack\n       believes that it has 6to4\
    \ connectivity, but in fact all outgoing\n       IPv6 packets are black-holed.\
    \  The prevalence of this problem is\n       hard to measure, since the resulting\
    \ IPv6 packets can never be\n       observed from the outside.\n   2.  Inbound\
    \ Black Hole: In this case, 6to4 packets sent to\n       192.88.99.1 are correctly\
    \ delivered to a 6to4 relay, and reply\n       packets are returned, but they\
    \ are dropped by an inbound protocol\n       41 filter.  As far as the user is\
    \ concerned, the effect is the\n       same as the previous case: IPv6 is a black\
    \ hole.  Many enterprise\n       networks are believed to be set up in this way.\
    \  Connection\n       attempts due to this case can be observed by IPv6 server\n\
    \       operators, in the form of SYN packets from addresses in 2002::/16\n  \
    \     followed by no response to the resulting SYN/ACK.  From the\n       experiments\
    \ cited above, this appears to be a significant problem\n       in practice.\n\
    \       This problem is complicated by three variables: the firewall\n       applying\
    \ the protocol 41 filter may be stateless or stateful; the\n       relay may source\
    \ its packets from its native IPv4 address or from\n       192.88.99.1; packets\
    \ from the relay may be subject to IPv4\n       ingress filtering.  If the protocol\
    \ 41 filter is stateless, 6to4\n       will never succeed.  If it is stateful,\
    \ the firewall will drop\n       inbound packets from addresses that have not\
    \ been seen in\n       outbound traffic on the same port.  In this case, 6to4\
    \ will only\n       succeed if the packets are sourced from 192.88.99.1.  If the\n\
    \       relay is subject to ingress filtering, only packets from its\n       native\
    \ IPv4 address can be transmitted.  Therefore, there are\n       only three combinations\
    \ that can succeed:\n       1.  No protocol 41 filter, with the relay using its\
    \ native IPv4\n           source address.\n       2.  No protocol 41 filter, with\
    \ the relay using the anycast IPv4\n           source address and with no ingress\
    \ filter.\n       3.  A stateful protocol 41 firewall, with the relay using the\n\
    \           anycast IPv4 source address and with no ingress filter.\n   3.  No\
    \ Return Relay: If the Outbound Black Hole problem does not\n       occur, i.e.,\
    \ the outgoing packet does reach the intended native\n       IPv6 destination,\
    \ the target system will send a reply packet, to\n       2002:c000:2aa::123 in\
    \ our example above.  Then, 2002::/16 may or\n       may not be successfully routed.\
    \  If it is not routed, the packet\n       will be dropped (hopefully, with 'destination\
    \ unreachable').\n       According to RFC 3056, an unwilling relay \"MUST NOT\
    \ advertise any\n       2002:: routing prefix into the native IPv6 domain\"; therefore,\n\
    \       conversely, if this prefix is advertised the relay must relay\n      \
    \ packets regardless of source and destination.  However, in\n       practice,\
    \ the problem arises that some relays reject packets that\n       they should\
    \ relay, based on their IPv6 source address.\n       Whether the native IPv6 destination\
    \ has no route to 2002::/16 or\n       it turns out to have a route to an unwilling\
    \ relay, the effect is\n       the same: all return IPv6 packets are black-holed.\
    \  While there\n       is no direct evidence of the prevalence of this problem,\
    \ it\n       certainly exists in practice.\n   4.  Large RTT: In the event that\
    \ none of the above three problems\n       applies, and a two-way path does in\
    \ fact exist between a 6to4\n       host and a native host, the round-trip time\
    \ may be quite large\n       and variable since the paths to the two relays are\
    \ unmanaged and\n       may be complex.  Overloaded relays might also cause highly\n\
    \       variable RTT.\n   5.  PMTUD Failure: A common link MTU size observed on\
    \ the Internet\n       today is 1500 bytes.  However, when using 6to4, the path\
    \ MTU is\n       less than this due to the encapsulation header.  Thus, a 6to4\n\
    \       client will normally see a link MTU that is less than 1500, but a\n  \
    \     native IPv6 server will see 1500.  It has been observed that Path\n    \
    \   MTU Discovery (PMTUD) does not always work, and this can lead to\n       connectivity\
    \ failures.  Even if a TCP SYN/ACK exchange works, TCP\n       packets with full-size\
    \ payloads may simply be lost.  This problem\n       is apparently exacerbated\
    \ in some cases by failure of the TCP\n       Maximum Segment Size (MSS) negotiation\
    \ mechanism [RFC2923].\n       These failures are disconcerting even to an informed\
    \ user, since\n       a standard 'ping' from the client to the server will succeed,\n\
    \       because it generates small packets, and the successful SYN/ACK\n     \
    \  exchange can be traced.  Also, the failure may occur on some\n       paths\
    \ but not others, so a user may be able to fetch web pages\n       from one site,\
    \ but only ping another.\n       Additionally, there is a problem if 6to4 is enabled\
    \ on a router\n       and it advertises the resulting prefix on a LAN, but does\
    \ not\n       also advertise a smaller MTU; in this case, TCP MSS negotiation\n\
    \       will definitely fail.\n   6.  Reverse DNS Failure: Typically, a 6to4-addressed\
    \ host will not\n       have a reverse DNS delegation.  If reverse DNS is used\
    \ as a\n       pseudo-security check, it will fail.\n   7.  Bogus Address Failure:\
    \ By design, 6to4 does not work and will not\n       activate itself if the available\
    \ V4ADDR is a private address\n       [RFC1918].  However, it will also not work\
    \ if the available\n       V4ADDR is a \"bogon\", i.e., a global address that\
    \ is being used by\n       the operator as a private address.  A common case of\
    \ this is a\n       legacy wireless network using 1.1.1.0/24 as if it was a private\n\
    \       address.  In this case, 6to4 will assume it is connected to the\n    \
    \   global Internet, but there is certainly no working return path.\n       This\
    \ failure mode will also occur if an ISP is operating a\n       Carrier Grade\
    \ NAT [CGN] between its customers and the Internet,\n       and is using global\
    \ public address space as if it were private\n       space to do so.\n   8.  Faulty\
    \ 6to4 Implementations: It has been reported that some 6to4\n       implementations\
    \ attempt to activate themselves even when the\n       available IPv4 address\
    \ is an RFC 1918 address.  This is in direct\n       contradiction to RFC 3056,\
    \ and will produce exactly the same\n       failure mode as Bogus Address Failure.\
    \  It is of course outside\n       the ISP's control.\n   9.  Difficult Fault\
    \ Diagnosis: The existence of all the above failure\n       modes creates a problem\
    \ of its own: very difficult fault\n       diagnosis, especially if the only symptom\
    \ reported by a user is\n       slow access to web pages, caused by a long timeout\
    \ before\n       fallback to IPv4.  Tracking down anycast routing problems and\n\
    \       PMTUD failures is particularly hard.\n   The practical impact of the above\
    \ problems, which are by no means\n   universal as there is considerable successful\
    \ use of Anycast 6to4,\n   has been measured at a fraction of 1% loss of attempted\
    \ connections\n   to dual-stack content servers [Anderson].  This is because a\
    \ small\n   fraction of client hosts attempt to connect using 6to4, and up to\
    \ 20%\n   of these experience one of the above failure modes.  While this seems\n\
    \   low, it amounts to a significant financial impact for content\n   providers.\
    \  Also, end users frustrated by the poor response times\n   caused by fallback\
    \ to IPv4 connectivity [EYEBALLS-IPV6] are\n   considered likely to generate help-desk\
    \ calls with their attendant\n   costs.\n   A rather different operational problem\
    \ caused incidentally by 6to4 is\n   that, according to observations made at the\
    \ University of Southampton\n   by Tim Chown and James Morse, and at other sites,\
    \ rogue Router\n   Advertisements [RFC6104] often convey a 2002::/16 prefix. \
    \ This\n   appears to be due to misbehavior by devices acting as local IPv6\n\
    \   routers or connection-sharing devices but issuing Router\n   Advertisement\
    \ (RA) messages on the wrong interface.  Such a device,\n   if it obtains IPv6\
    \ connectivity via an upstream link to the Internet,\n   should only issue the\
    \ corresponding RA messages on its downstream\n   link to the nodes intended to\
    \ share its Internet connection.  Issuing\n   RA messages on the upstream link\
    \ will perturb any other IPv6 hosts on\n   that link.  If 6to4 routing is enabled\
    \ by default on a device that\n   exhibits this faulty behavior, the resulting\
    \ rogue RA messages will\n   indeed convey a 2002::/16 prefix.\n"

    \   1.  Some vendors of routers, including customer premises equipment,\n    \
    \   have not only included support for 6to4 in their products, but\n       have\
    \ enabled it by default.  This is bad practice - it should\n       always be a\
    \ conscious decision by a user to enable 6to4.  Many of\n       the above problems\
    \ only occur due to unintentional deployment of\n       6to4.\n   2.  Similarly,\
    \ host operating systems should not enable Anycast 6to4\n       by default; it\
    \ should always be left to the user to switch it on.\n   3.  Any 6to4 implementation\
    \ that attempts to activate itself when the\n       available IPv4 address is\
    \ an RFC 1918 address is faulty and needs\n       to be updated.\n   4.  6to4\
    \ implementations should adopt updated IETF recommendations on\n       address\
    \ selection [RFC3484-REVISE].\n   5.  6to4 relay implementations must carefully\
    \ follow Section 3.2 of\n       [RFC4213] to ensure correct handling of MTU issues.\n\
    \   6.  6to4 router or connection-sharing implementations must avoid\n       issuing\
    \ rogue RAs [RFC6104].  Additionally, where 6to4 is being\n       enabled by a\
    \ node for Internet-connection-sharing purposes, and\n       the node supports\
    \ [RFC4191], then it should set the Router\n       Advertisement router preference\
    \ bits to 11 (low preference).\n"

    \ or Hop Limit\n   exceeded error back.  Lack of any response indicates that the\
    \ 6to4\n   relay does not work so 6to4 is turned off [Savola].\n   A more constructive\
    \ approach for such an ISP is to seek out a transit\n   provider who is indeed\

- title: 4.4.  Transit ISPs and Internet Exchange Points
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Transit ISPs and Internet Exchange Points\n   We assume that transit ISPs\
    \ have IPv6 connectivity.  To reduce the\n   negative impact of Anycast 6to4 on\
    \ all their client networks, it is\n   strongly recommended that they each run\
    \ an Anycast 6to4 relay\n   service.  This will have the additional advantage\
    \ that they will\n   terminate the 6to4 IPv4 packets and can then forward the\
    \ decapsulated\n   IPv6 traffic according to their own policy.  Otherwise, they\
    \ will\n   blindly forward all the encapsulated IPv6 traffic to a competitor who\n\
    \   does run a relay.\n   Although most modern Internet Exchange Points do not\
    \ offer IP layer\n   services, an Internet exchange point (IXP) could choose to\
    \ operate an\n   Anycast 6to4 relay service for the benefit of its customers.\
    \  If so,\n   it should follow the recommendations in this section.\n   It is\
    \ of critical importance that routing to this service is\n   carefully managed:\n\
    \   1.  The IPv4 prefix 192.88.99.0/24 must be announced only towards\n      \
    \ client IPv4 networks whose outbound 6to4 packets will be\n       accepted.\n\
    \   2.  The IPv6 prefix 2002::/16 must be announced towards native IPv6.\n   \
    \    The relay must accept all traffic towards 2002::/16 that reaches\n      \
    \ it, so the scope reached by this announcement should be carefully\n       planned.\
    \  It must reach all client IPv6 networks of the transit\n       ISP.  If it reaches\
    \ a wider scope, the relay will be offering a\n       free ride to non-clients.\n\
    \   3.  As discussed in item 2 of Section 3, the choice of IPv4 source\n     \
    \  address used when the relay sends 6to4 packets back towards a\n       6to4\
    \ user is important.  The best choice is likely to be\n       192.88.99.1, not\
    \ the relay's unicast IPv4 address, unless ingress\n       filtering is an issue.\
    \  This is to avoid failure if the user is\n       behind a stateful firewall.\n\
    \   4.  The relay should be capable of responding correctly to ICMPv6\n      \
    \ echo requests encapsulated in IPv4 protocol 41, typically with\n       outer\
    \ destination address 192.88.99.1 and inner destination\n       address 2002:c058:6301::.\
    \  (As noted previously, some 6to4 hosts\n       are known to send echo requests\
    \ with Hop Limit = 1, which allows\n       them to rapidly detect the presence\
    \ or absence of a relay in any\n       case, but operators cannot rely on this\
    \ behavior.)\n   5.  Protocol 41 must not be filtered in any IPv4 network or\n\
    \       firewalls.\n   6.  As a matter of general practice, which is essential\
    \ for 6to4 to\n       work well, IPv6 PMTUD must be possible, which means that\
    \ ICMPv6\n       must not be blocked anywhere [RFC4890].  This also requires that\n\
    \       the relay has a sufficiently high ICMP error generation\n       threshold.\
    \  For a busy relay, a typical default rate limit of 100\n       packets per second\
    \ is too slow.  On a busy relay, 1000 pps or\n       more might be needed.  If\
    \ ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" error messages\n       are rate limited, users will\
    \ experience PMTUD failure.\n   7.  The relay must have adequate performance,\
    \ and since load\n       prediction is extremely hard, it must be possible to\
    \ scale it up\n       or, perhaps better, to replicate it as needed.  Since the\
    \ relay\n       process is stateless, any reasonable method of load sharing\n\
    \       between multiple relays will do.\n   8.  Of course, the relay must be\
    \ connected directly to global IPv4\n       space, with no NAT.\n   Operators\
    \ in this category should make sure that no routers are\n   unintentionally or\

    \ source of problems.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Content Providers and Their ISPs
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Content Providers and Their ISPs\n   We assume that content providers and\
    \ their ISPs have IPv6\n   connectivity, and that the servers are dual stacked.\
    \  The following\n   applies to content servers as such, but equally to web hosting\n\
    \   servers, servers that form part of a content distribution network,\n   load\
    \ balancers in front of a server farm, and HTTP caches.  There is\n   a need to\
    \ avoid the situation where a client host, configured with\n   Anycast 6to4, succeeds\
    \ in sending an IPv6 packet to the server, but\n   the 6to4 return path fails\
    \ as described above.  To avoid this, there\n   must be a locally positioned 6to4\
    \ relay.  Large content providers are\n   advised to operate their own relays,\
    \ and ISPs should do so in any\n   case.  There must be a 2002::/16 route from\
    \ the content server to the\n   relay.  As noted in the previous section, the\
    \ corresponding route\n   advertisement must be carefully scoped, since any traffic\
    \ that\n   arrives for 2002::/16 must be relayed.\n   Such a relay may be dedicated\
    \ entirely to return traffic, in which\n   case, it need not respond to the 6to4\
    \ anycast address.\n   Nevertheless, it seems wisest to ensure that when the relay\
    \ sends\n   6to4 packets back towards a 6to4 user, they should have 192.88.99.1\n\
    \   as their IPv4 source address (not the relay's unicast IPv4 address).\n   As\
    \ noted above, this is to avoid problems if the user is behind a\n   stateful\
    \ firewall that drops UDP packets from addresses that have not\n   been seen in\
    \ outbound traffic.  However, it is also necessary that\n   192.88.99.1 is not\
    \ blocked by upstream ingress filtering -- this\n   needs to be tested.\n   Without\
    \ careful engineering, there is nothing to make the return path\n   as short as\
    \ possible.  It is highly desirable to arrange the scope of\n   advertisements\
    \ for 2002::/16 such that content providers have a short\n   path to the relay,\
    \ and the relay should have a short path to the ISP\n   border.  Care should be\
    \ taken about shooting off advertisements for\n   2002::/16 into BGP4; they will\
    \ become traffic magnets.  If every ISP\n   with content provider customers operates\
    \ a relay, there will be no\n   need for any of them to be advertised beyond each\
    \ ISP's own\n   customers.\n   Protocol 41 must not be filtered in the ISP's IPv4\
    \ network or\n   firewalls.  If the relays are placed outside the content provider's\n\
    \   firewall, the latter may filter protocol 41 if desired.\n   The relay must\
    \ have adequate performance, and since load prediction\n   is extremely hard,\
    \ it must be possible to scale it up or, perhaps\n   better, to replicate it as\
    \ needed.  Since the relay process is\n   stateless, any reasonable method of\
    \ load sharing between multiple\n   relays will do.\n   The relay must of course\
    \ be connected directly to global IPv4 space,\n   with no NAT.\n   An option is\
    \ to embed the relay function directly in the content\n   server or first hop\
    \ router.  This is straightforward, since it can be\n   achieved by enabling a\
    \ local 6to4 interface, and using it to route\n   2002::/16 for outbound packets.\
    \  (This might not allow use of\n   192.88.99.1 as the source address.)  Further\
    \ details are to be found\n   at [Huston-b].  However, in this case protocol 41\
    \ must be allowed by\n   the firewalls.\n   Content providers who do embed the\
    \ relay function in this way could,\n   in theory, accept inbound 6to4 traffic\
    \ as well.  This is highly\n   unadvisable since, according to the rules of 6to4,\
    \ they would then\n   have to relay traffic for other IPv6 destinations, too.\
    \  So they\n   should not be reachable via 192.88.99.1.  Also, they should certainly\n\
    \   not create an AAAA record for their 6to4 address -- their inbound\n   IPv6\
    \ access should be native, and advertising a 6to4 address might\n   well lead\
    \ to unicast reverse path forwarding (uRPF) [RFC3704] ingress\n   filtering problems.\n\
    \   To avoid the path MTU problem described above, content servers should\n  \
    \ also set their IPv6 MTU to a safe value.  From experience, 1280 bytes\n   (the\
    \ minimum allowed for IPv6) is recommended; again, see [Huston-b].\n   Of course,\
    \ ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" must not be blocked or rate-\n   limited anywhere\
    \ [RFC4890].\n   Reverse DNS delegations are highly unlikely to exist for 6to4\n\
    \   clients, and are by no means universal for other IPv6 clients.\n   Content\
    \ providers (and, in fact, all service providers) should not\n   rely on them\
    \ as a pseudo-security check for IPv6 clients.\n   Operators and content providers\
    \ should make sure that no routers are\n   unintentionally or by default set up\

  - "5.  Tunnels Managed by ISPs\n   There are various ways, such as tunnel brokers\
    \ [RFC3053], 6rd\n   [RFC5969], and Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 2 (L2TPv2)\
    \ hub-and-\n   spoke [RFC5571], by which Internet Service Providers can provide\n\
    \   tunneled IPv6 service to subscribers in a managed way, in which the\n   subscriber\
    \ will acquire an IPv6 prefix under a normal provider-based\n   global IPv6 prefix.\
    \  Most of the issues described for 6to4 do not\n   arise in these scenarios.\
    \  However, for IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels used by\n   clients behind a firewall, it\
    \ is essential that IPv4 protocol 41 is\n   not blocked.\n   As a matter of general\
    \ practice, IPv6 PMTUD must be possible, which\n   means that ICMPv6 \"Packet\
    \ Too Big\" must not be blocked or rate-\n   limited anywhere [RFC4890].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There is a general discussion of security issues\
    \ for IPv6-in-IPv4\n   tunnels in [RFC6169], and [TUNNEL-LOOPS] discusses possible\
    \ malicious\n   loops.  [RFC3964] specifically discusses 6to4 security.  In summary,\n\
    \   tunnels create a challenge for many common security mechanisms,\n   simply\
    \ because a potentially suspect packet is encapsulated inside a\n   harmless outer\
    \ packet.  All these considerations apply to the\n   automatic mechanisms discussed\
    \ in this document.  However, it should\n   be noted that if an operator provides\
    \ well-managed servers and relays\n   for 6to4, non-encapsulated IPv6 packets\
    \ will pass through well-\n   defined points (the native IPv6 interfaces of those\
    \ servers and\n   relays) at which security mechanisms may be applied.\n   A blanket\
    \ recommendation to block protocol 41 is not compatible with\n   mitigating the\
    \ 6to4 problems described in this document.\n"
