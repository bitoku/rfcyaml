- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF defined \"LoWPAN encapsulation\", a format for\
    \ IPv6 [RFC2460]\n   datagram encapsulation [RFC4944].  This document regards\
    \ any IPv6\n   datagram using the Dispatch octet as defined in Section 5.1 of\
    \ RFC\n   4944 as using LoWPAN encapsulation.  LoWPAN encapsulation as defined\n\
    \   in RFC 4944 has been updated by [RFC6282], and may be extended and\n   modified\
    \ by future IETF Standards.  The intended Layer 2 technology\n   for IPv6 datagrams\
    \ using LoWPAN encapsulation as originally defined\n   is [IEEE.802.15.4_2011],\
    \ which does not provide for a protocol switch\n   in its Layer 2 headers.\n \
    \  The following list gives some example use cases for the Ethertype-\n   based\
    \ protocol dispatch for the LoWPAN-encapsulated IPv6 datagram:\n   o  Usage of\
    \ LoWPAN encapsulation in conjunction with IEEE 802.15.9\n      Multiplexed Data\
    \ Service [IEEE802159], which provides the ability\n      to perform upper layer\
    \ protocol dispatch for IEEE 802.15.4\n      networks.  Wi-SUN Alliance intends\
    \ to use the 15.9 Multiplexed\n      Data Information Element for upper layer\
    \ protocol dispatch.  As\n      specified in IEEE 802.15.9, dispatch of LoWPAN\
    \ encapsulation\n      frames will require that an Ethertype be assigned for LoWPAN\n\
    \      encapsulation.\n   o  LoWPAN encapsulation will likely be needed for Wi-Fi\
    \ Alliance's\n      HaLoW [HALOW] standard (low-power operation in the 900 MHz\
    \ band).\n   o  Other Layer 2 technologies such as Ethernet and debugging tools\n\
    \      such as Wireshark require a unique Protocol Type field for LoWPAN\n   \
    \   encapsulation to properly interpret IPv6 datagrams that use LoWPAN\n     \
    \ encapsulation.\n   o  Any existing or future Layer 2 technology, incorporating\n\
    \      Ethertype-based upper layer dispatch, can use the Ethertype\n      proposed\
    \ in this document to dispatch LoWPAN-encapsulated IPv6\n      datagrams.\n"
- title: 2.  Assignment of an Ethertype by IEEE
  contents:
  - "2.  Assignment of an Ethertype by IEEE\n   The IETF formally submitted a request\
    \ to IEEE for assignment of an\n   Ethertype for IPv6 datagrams using LoWPAN encapsulation.\
    \  IEEE has\n   responded with the assignment of Ethertype 0xA0ED for this purpose.\n\
    \   The assignment has been recorded by IEEE [IEEE-ETHERTYPES].\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   The following entry has been added to the \"ETHER\
    \ TYPES\" subregistry\n   of the \"IEEE 802 Numbers\" registry [IANA-IEEE802]:\n\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document only requests assignment of an\
    \ Ethertype for IPv6\n   datagrams using LoWPAN encapsulation.  It has no incremental\n\
