    \       Flow Bindings Initiated by Home Agents for Mobile IPv6\n"
- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   There are scenarios in which the home agent needs to trigger flow\n\
    \   binding operations towards the mobile node, such as moving a flow\n   from\
    \ one access network to another based on network resource\n   availability.  In\
    \ order for the home agent to be able to initiate\n   interactions for flow bindings\
    \ with the mobile node, this document\n   defines new signaling messages and sub-options\
    \ for Mobile IPv6.  Flow\n   bindings initiated by a home agent are supported\
    \ for mobile nodes\n   enabled by both IPv4 and IPv6.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6089] allows a mobile node (MN) to bind a particular\
    \ flow to a\n   care-of address (CoA) without affecting other flows using the\
    \ same\n   home address.  BU/BA (Binding Update / Binding Acknowledgement)\n \
    \  messages are extended for the mobile node to add, delete, modify,\n   move,\
    \ refresh, and revoke flow bindings in a home agent (HA).  The\n   operations\
    \ are always initiated by the mobile node.\n   While the mobile node manipulates\
    \ flow bindings by, e.g., the user\n   interaction or the change of the attached\
    \ link condition, these\n   operations are also required for network-related reasons\
    \ such as\n   dynamic QoS control in the network, load balancing, or maintenance\
    \ in\n   mobility agent nodes.  For the latter case, the mobile node is not\n\
    \   very aware of the transport network condition away from it or of the\n   policy\
    \ and charging status controlled by the operator; thus, the\n   network needs\
    \ to request that the mobile node handle proper flow\n   bindings.\n   This document\
    \ defines a new Mobility Header and messages in order for\n   the home agent to\
    \ request that the mobile node initiate flow bindings\n   in a timely manner.\
    \  Flow mobility is also supported for mobile nodes\n   with an IPv4 home address\
    \ and an IPv4 address of the home agent, as\n   described in [RFC5555].\n"

    '
- title: 3.1.  QoS Provisioning
  contents:
  - "3.1.  QoS Provisioning\n   When the user launches a video chat application and\
    \ starts sending\n   voice and video to the other end, the network may need to\
    \ provide\n   different QoS treatments to these media based on the operator's\n\
    \   policy.  In such a case, the network needs to request the user or\n   mobile\
    \ node to establish separate flows for voice and video.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Traffic Offload from Congested Network
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Traffic Offload from Congested Network\n   The 3G operator may want to\
    \ move traffic flows from the 3G access\n   network to another network (e.g.,\
    \ Wi-Fi network) due to instantaneous\n   traffic increases in the 3G access network.\
    \  Fine-grained traffic\n   offload is desirable.  For example, Voice over IP\
    \ (VoIP) flows based\n   on IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS) must stay in the mobile\
    \ core\n   network while video-streaming flows provided by servers on the\n  \
    \ Internet could bypass the mobile core network via Wi-Fi access.\n   Since the\
    \ network knows more about its conditions and has access to\n   the policy server,\
    \ more timely and well-controlled traffic offloading\n   is possible.  The home\
    \ agent sends an updated flow descriptor to be\n   offloaded to the mobile node.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Flow Movement or Deletion in an Emergency Situation
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Flow Movement or Deletion in an Emergency Situation\n   In an emergency\
    \ situation caused by a natural disaster, it is\n   necessary to accept as many\
    \ voice calls as possible for inquiries to\n   confirm the safety status of family\
    \ and friends, while non-critical\n   services such as gaming would be considered\
    \ lower priority.  In order\n   to save the 3G / Long Term Evolution (LTE) radio\
    \ resources for\n   emergency services, non-critical services may need to be moved\
    \ to\n   another access network or closed down.  The home agent requests that\n\
    \   the mobile node use Wi-Fi access for non-critical application flows\n   or\
    \ terminate them gracefully, e.g., by letting it notify the user of\n   possible\
    \ QoS degradation or ask him/her to finish the corresponding\n   applications\
    \ before taking any action.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Service-Specific Data Cap
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Service-Specific Data Cap\n   The mobile operator offers a mobile broadband\
    \ service with a flat\n   rate subscription limited to 5 GB per month.  Once the\
    \ allotment is\n   used up, the service is downgraded to 64 kbits/s.  This limitation,\n\
    \   however, is not applied to IMS-based services (e.g., Voice over LTE\n   (VoLTE)),\
    \ while video conversations over the Internet will be\n   affected.  The operator\
    \ can indicate this to the user by sending\n   modified flow descriptors as a\
    \ proposal to adjust the communication\n   data rate or change access for an ongoing\
    \ session.\n"
- title: 4.  Protocol Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Protocol Operation\n   [RFC6089] makes use of BU/BA signaling to forward,\
    \ i.e., register or\n   discard, a flow binding in a home agent.  Flow binding\
    \ operations are\n   always initiated from the mobile node.  The basic principle\
    \ of this\n   specification is that the home agent prompts the mobile node to\n\
    \   perform flow binding operations.  For this purpose, a new Mobility\n   Header\
    \ and two new messages, that is, Flow Binding Indication (FBI)\n   and Flow Binding\
    \ Acknowledgement (FBA), are defined.  An FBI is used\n   by the home agent to\
    \ request flow binding operations to the mobile\n   node, and an FBA is used for\
    \ acknowledging an FBI.  In order for the\n   flow binding operation to be complete,\
    \ a BU/BA exchange MUST be\n   initiated by the mobile node after an FBI/FBA exchange.\n\
    \   It is assumed that the home agent has already created binding cache\n   entries\
    \ for the mobile node before launching flow binding operations.\n   Due to access-network\
    \ change on the mobile-node side, some interfaces\n   that used to be active may\
    \ not be valid at the time of the flow\n   binding operation by the home agent,\
    \ in which case, even if the HA\n   sends the FBI to the MN, the FBA will not\
    \ return.  After\n   retransmitting the FBIs for MAX_FBI_RETRIES times and not\
    \ receiving\n   the FBA, the HA determines that the target interface is not\n\
    \   available.\n   If the mobile node does not support the FBI message, it responds\
    \ with\n   a Binding Error message with status set to 2 (unrecognized Mobility\n\
    \   Header (MH) type value) as described in [RFC6275].  When the Binding\n   Error\
    \ message with status set to 2 is received in response to an FBI\n   message,\
    \ the home agent MUST NOT use an FBI message with that mobile\n   node again.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Adding Flow Bindings
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Adding Flow Bindings\n   Adding the flow binding implies associating a\
    \ particular flow with\n   one of the care-of addresses on the mobile node.  The\
    \ care-of address\n   concerned with the flow binding is present in the destination\
    \ address\n   of the packet or the alternate care-of address option.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ the care-of address may be indicated by the Target\n   Care-of Address sub-option\
    \ defined in Section 6.2.2.\n   When adding a new flow binding, the home agent\
    \ sends an FBI with a\n   Flow Identification Mobility option to the mobile node.\
    \  In Figure 1,\n   which is shown as an example for this operation, the mobile\
    \ node\n   exchanges both voice and video over FID#1 (Flow Identifier #1).\n \
    \  Based on the operator's policy, the network determines if it needs to\n   provide\
    \ separate QoS for the video flow, and the home agent sends the\n   FBI to the\
    \ mobile node.  The Flow Identification Mobility option\n   defined in [RFC6089]\
    \ includes the current FID and the Traffic\n   Selector (TS) to specify the video\
    \ flow.  The Flow Binding Action\n   sub-option MUST indicate the Add operation\
    \ defined in Section 6.2.1.\n   The mobile node returns the FBA to the home agent\
    \ with the same\n   options.  The BU/BA exchange follows afterwards to perform\
    \ the actual\n   flow binding as defined in [RFC6088], and the video traffic is\n\
    \   exchanged over FID#2.\n                  +----+                          \

  - "4.6.  Revoking Flow Bindings\n   When the home agent or the network attached\
    \ to it is overloaded, the\n   home agent can revoke a flow binding registered\
    \ by the mobile node.\n   The home agent sends the mobile node an FBI message\
    \ with a Flow\n   Identification Mobility option in which the Flow Binding Action\
    \ sub-\n   option indicates the Revoke operation.  When the MN receives the FBI\n\
    \   message with the Revoke operation, it decides whether the flow should\n  \
    \ be removed (de-registration) or moved to another interface and\n   returns the\
    \ FBA with an appropriate status code.  The mobile node\n   SHOULD take an action\
    \ by sending a new BU, for example, to deregister\n   the flow.\n   The difference\
    \ between revoking and deleting flow bindings\n   (Section 4.2) is that the target\
    \ flow may be revoked by the network\n   with the procedures defined in [RFC5846]\
    \ even if the mobile node does\n   not take any action.\n"
- title: 5.  Handling of the Flow Bindings List

    \ if the\n   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, the home agent\n\
    \   MUST add a new entry to the flow bindings list.  The FID, Flow\n   Descriptor,\
    \ FID-PRI, and Action fields are taken from the Flow\n   Identification Mobility\
    \ option.  The binding identifier (BID) is\n   copied from the Binding Reference\
