Abstract This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in RFC 3979.
Specifically, when third party Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) disclosures are made, the intention is that the IETF Executive Director notify the IPR holder that a third party disclosure has been filed, and to ask the IPR holder whether they have any disclosure that needs to be made, per applicable RFC 3979 rules.
This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in RFC 3979 [RFC3979].
Specifically, when third party IPR disclosures are made, the intention is that the IETF Executive Director notify the IPR holder that a third party disclosure has been filed, and to ask the IPR holder whether they have any disclosure that needs to be made, per applicable RFC 3979 rules.
This document updates RFC 3979.
The Fix RFC 3979, Section 4 (C), states: (C)
Where Intellectual Property Rights have been disclosed for IETF Documents as provided in Section 6 of this document, the IETF Executive Director shall request from the discloser of such IPR, a written assurance that upon approval by the IESG for publication as RFCs of the relevant IETF specification(s), all persons will be able to obtain the right to implement, use, distribute and exercise other rights with respect to Implementing Technology under one of the licensing options specified in Section 6.5 below unless such a statement has already been submitted.
In the case of third party disclosures, it makes no sense to ask the discloser about potential licensing terms, since they do not own the IPR.
Instead, it only makes sense to ask the IPR holder.
This document updates RFC 3979 by changing the word "discloser" to "holder" in the above text.
This document has no known security implications.
