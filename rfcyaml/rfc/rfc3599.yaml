    \ Email Filtering --\nOn email systems that allow for \"subaddressing\" or \"\
    detailed addressing\"\n(e.g., \"ken+sieve@example.org\"), it is sometimes desirable\
    \ to make\ncomparisons against these sub-parts of addresses.  This document defines\n\

    \ Routing\nThe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) operates over UDP and TCP, among\n\
    others.  When used with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the\nsource\
    \ address the request came from, and to the port written into the\ntopmost Via\
    \ header field value of the request.  This behavior is not\ndesirable in many\
    \ cases, most notably, when the client is behind a\nNetwork Address Translator\
    \ (NAT).  This extension defines a new\nparameter for the Via header field, called\
    \ \"rport\", that allows a client\nto request that the server send the response\
    \ back to the source IP\naddress and port from which the request originated. \
