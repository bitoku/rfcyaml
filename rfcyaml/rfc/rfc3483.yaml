- title: 1 Introduction
  contents:
  - "1 Introduction\n   Policy usage reported by the PEP makes a richer set of information\n\
    \   available to the PDP for decision-making.  This feedback on policy\n   usage\
    \ can impact future decisions made by the PDP and the resulting\n   policy installed\
    \ by the PDP at the PEP.  For example, a PDP making\n   policy for a SIP signaled\
    \ multimedia session may need to base the\n   decision in part on usage information\
    \ related to previously installed\n   QoS policy decisions.  Furthermore, the\
    \ PDP may coordinate this usage\n   information with other external systems to\
    \ determine the future\n   policy such as the case with the PDP coordinating multimedia\
    \ session\n   QoS and clearinghouse authorizations [SIP-AAA-QOS].\n   The scope\
    \ of this document is to describe the framework for policy\n   usage monitored\
    \ and reported by the PEP and collected at the PDP.\n   The charging, rating and\
    \ billing models, as well as other accounting\n   or statistics gathering events,\
    \ detectable by the PDP are beyond the\n   scope of this framework.\n"
- title: 2 Overview
  contents:
  - "2 Overview\n   There are three main aspects to define policies for usage feedback:\n\
    \   -  which objects are monitored\n   -  the metrics to be monitored and reported\
    \ for these objects\n   -  when the reports are delivered\n   In the framework,\
    \ a selection criteria policy specifies one or more\n   objects that should be\
    \ monitored (e.g., a dropper or the instances of\n   an IP Filter for all its\
    \ interfaces).\n   A usage feedback class is used to specify which metrics are\
    \ to be\n   collected for a set of objects - instances of the specified class\n\
    \   carry the usage information when it is reported.  The valid\n   combinations\
    \ of monitored object classes and usage feedback classes\n   are reported by the\
    \ PEP as capabilities.\n   Finally, selection criteria policy and usage feedback\
    \ class are bound\n   together in a linkage policy, which also contains the information\
    \ of\n   when reports are generated.  Reports are usually sent periodically,\n\
    \   but more restrictions can be placed on the generation of reports,\n   like\
    \ thresholds or a change in the data.\n"
- title: 3 Requirements for Normal Operations
  contents:
  - "3 Requirements for Normal Operations\n   Per COPS [RFC2748], the PDP specifies\
    \ the minimum feedback interval\n   in the Accounting Timer object that is included\
    \ in the Client Accept\n   message during connection establishment.  This specifies\
    \ the maximum\n   frequency with which the PEP issues unsolicited accounting type\n\
    \   report messages.  The purpose of this interval is to pace the number\n   of\
    \ report messages sent to the PDP.  It is not the goal of the\n   interval defined\
    \ by the ACCT Timer value to provide precision\n   synchronization or timing.\n\
    \   The selection and the associated usage criteria and intervals for\n   feedback\
    \ reporting are defined by the PDP.  Feedback policies, which\n   define the necessary\
    \ selection and linkages to usage feedback\n   criteria, are included by the PDP\
    \ in a Decision message to the PEP.\n   The usage feedback is then periodically\
    \ reported by the PEP, at\n   intervals defined in the linkage policies at a rate\
    \ no more\n   frequently than specified in the Accounting Timer object.  Note\
    \ that\n   there are exceptions where reports containing feedback are provided\n\
    \   prior to the Accounting Timer interval (see section 6).  The PDP may\n   also\
    \ solicit usage feedback which is to be reported back immediately\n   by the PEP.\
    \  Usage information may be cleared upon reporting.  This\n   is specified in\
    \ the usage policy criteria.\n   The PEP monitors and tracks the usage feedback\
    \ information.  The PDP\n   is the collection point for the policy usage feedback\
    \ information\n   reported by the PEP clients within the administrative domain.\
    \  The\n   PDP may also collect other accounting event information that is\n \
    \  outside the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4 Periodic Nature of Policy Usage Feedback
  contents:
  - "4 Periodic Nature of Policy Usage Feedback\n   Generally the policy usage feedback\
    \ is periodic in nature and the\n   reporting is unsolicited.  The unsolicited\
    \ reports are supplied per\n   the interval defined by the PDP.  The periodic\
    \ unsolicited reports\n   are dictated by timer intervals and use a deterministic\
    \ amount of\n   network resources.\n   The PDP informs the PEP of the minimal\
    \ feedback interval during\n   client connection establishment with the Accounting\
    \ Timer object.\n   The PDP may specify feedback intervals in the specific usage\
    \ feedback\n   policies as well.  The unsolicited monitoring and reporting by\
    \ the\n   PEP may be suspended and resumed at the direction of the PDP.\n"
- title: 4.1 Reporting Intervals
  contents:
  - "4.1 Reporting Intervals\n   The generation of usage feedback by the PEP to the\
    \ PDP is done under\n   different conditions that include feedback on demand,\
    \ periodic\n   feedback or feedback when a defined threshold is reached.\n   The\
    \ periodic feedback for a usage policy can be further defined in\n   terms of\
    \ providing feedback if there is a change or providing\n   feedback periodically\
    \ regardless of a change in value.\n   The periodic interval is defined in terms\
    \ of the Accounting Object,\n   ACCT Timer value.  A single interval is equal\
    \ to the number of\n   seconds specified by the ACCT Timer value.  The PDP may\
    \ define a\n   specific number of intervals, which are to pass before the PEP\n\
    \   provides the usage feedback for a specific policy in a report.  When\n   the\
    \ ACCT Timer value is equal to zero there is no unsolicited usage\n   feedback\
    \ provided by the PEP.  However, the PEP still monitors and\n   tracks the usage\
    \ per the PDP policy and reports it when the PDP\n   solicits the feedback.\n\
    \   Reporting may be based on reaching a defined threshold value in the\n   usage\
    \ PRC.\n   The PDP may solicit usage feedback in the middle of an interval by\n\
    \   sending a COPS decision message.  The exact contents of the message\n   are\
    \ out of the scope of this framework document and need to be\n   defined in a\
    \ document that actually implements usage feedback using\n   this framework.\n\
    \   The PEP, upon receiving a solicit decision from the PDP, shall\n   provide\
    \ the requested usage information and clear the usage\n   information if the usage\
    \ policy requires that the attribute be\n   cleared after reporting.  The PEP\
    \ should continue to maintain the\n   same interval schedule as defined by the\
    \ PDP in the Accounting Timer\n   object and established at client connection\
    \ acceptance.\n"
- title: 5 Suspension, Resumption and Halting of Usage Monitoring and Reporting
  contents:
  - "5 Suspension, Resumption and Halting of Usage Monitoring and Reporting\n   The\
    \ PDP may direct the PEP to suspend usage feedback report messages\n   and then\
    \ at a later time instruct the PEP to resume the reporting of\n   feedback.  The\
    \ PDP may also instruct the PEP to suspend the\n   monitoring and tracking of\
    \ usage which also results in the\n   suppression of the feedback reports until\
    \ the PDP later tells the PEP\n   to resume the monitoring (and reporting).  When\
    \ the PDP suspends\n   monitoring or suspends reporting, it also specifies whether\
    \ the PEP\n   is to provide an unsolicited feedback report of the current monitored\n\
    \   usage of the affected usage policy.  The PDP may suspend and resume\n   monitoring\
    \ and reporting for specific usage policies or for all of\n   the usage feedback\
    \ policies.\n"
- title: 6 Solicited Feedback
  contents:
  - "6 Solicited Feedback\n   There may be instances when it is useful for the PDP\
    \ to control the\n   feedback per an on-demand basis rather than a periodic basis.\
    \  The\n   PDP may solicit the PEP for usage feedback with a Decision.  The PDP\n\
    \   may solicit usage feedback at any time during the accounting interval\n  \
    \ defined by the ACCT Timer.  The PEP responds immediately and reports\n   the\
    \ appropriate usage policies and should continue to follow the\n   usage feedback\
    \ interval schedule established during connection\n   acceptance.\n"
- title: 7 Usage reports on shared objects
  contents:
  - "7 Usage reports on shared objects\n   While some objects in a context's namespace\
    \ directly represent unique\n   objects of the PEP's configuration, other COPS\
    \ objects can be shared\n   between multiple actual assignments in the PEP.\n\
    \   Whenever the PEP creates multiple actual configuration instances from\n  \
    \ the same COPS objects, these assignments can potentially collect\n   their own\
    \ statistics independently.  Since the individual assignments\n   do not have\
    \ a direct representation as COPS objects, additional\n   information must be\
    \ provided to uniquely identify the assignment that\n   generates the usage information.\
    \  As an example, if the PEP needs to\n   create multiple usage objects for an\
    \ IP address, it may use the port\n   number to uniquely identify each object,\
    \ i.e., the (IP address, port\n   number) combination is now the unique identifier\
    \ of the object.\n   The feedback framework allows this information to be distributed\n\
    \   between a selection criteria PRC and the corresponding usage feedback\n  \
    \ PRC, however both PRCs together always must contain sufficient\n   information\
    \ for the finest granularity of usage collection supported\n   by the PEP.\n \
    \  If all the additional information is not part of the selection\n   criteria\
    \ PRC, all matching assignments are selected to collect usage\n   information.\
    \  The necessary data to differentiate these assignments\n   is part of the usage\
    \ feedback PRC.\n   Implementations based on the feedback framework should always\
    \ provide\n   a selection criteria PRC that contains a complete set of information\n\
    \   to select a unique assignment, while underspecified selection\n   criteria\
    \ PRCs (together with extended usage feedback PRCs) are\n   optional.\n"
- title: 8 Context
  contents:
  - "8 Context\n   COPS-PR [RFC3084] allows multiple, independent, disjoint instances\
    \ of\n   policies to be configured on the PEP.  Each instance is known as a\n\
    \   context, and only one context can be active at any given moment.  The\n  \
    \ PDP directs the PEP to switch between contexts using a single\n   decision message.\n\
    \   The monitoring and recording of usage policies is subject to context\n   switches\
    \ in a manner similar to that of the enforcement policy.\n   Usage policy is monitored,\
    \ recorded and reported while the associated\n   policy information context is\
    \ active.  When the context is\n   deactivated, a report message containing the\
    \ usage feedback policies\n   for that context is provided to the PDP.  The PEP\
    \ does not perform\n   any monitoring, tracking or reporting of policy usage for\
    \ a given\n   context while the context is inactive.\n"
- title: 9 Delete Request States
  contents:
  - "9 Delete Request States\n   The PEP MUST send any outstanding usage feedback\
    \ data monitored\n   during the feedback interval to the PDP via an unsolicited\
    \ report\n   message immediately prior to issuing a Delete Request State.  This\
    \ is\n   also the case when the PDP initiates the Delete Request State.\n"
- title: 10 Failover
  contents:
  - "10 Failover\n   In the event the connection is lost between the PEP and PDP,\
    \ the PEP\n   continues to track usage feedback information as long as it continues\n\
    \   to enforce installed (cached) policy.  When the locally installed\n   policy\
    \ at the PEP expires, the usage feedback policy data also\n   expires and is no\
    \ longer monitored.\n   Upon successful reconnection, where the PEP is still caching\
    \ policy,\n   the PDP indicates deterministically to the PEP that the PEP may\n\
    \   resume usage feedback reporting.  The PEP reports all cached usage\n   and\
    \ resumes periodic reporting, making any needed adjustment to the\n   interval\
    \ schedule as specified in the reconnection acceptance ACCT\n   Timer.\n"
- title: 11 Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "11 Security Considerations\n   This document provides a framework for policy\
    \ usage feedback, using\n   COPS-PR as the transport mechanism.  As feedback information\
    \ is\n   sensitive, it MUST be transported in a secured manner.  COPS\n   [RFC2748]\
    \ and COPS-PR [RFC3084] provide for such secured transport,\n   with mandatory\
    \ and suggested security mechanisms.\n   The usage feedback information themselves\
    \ MUST be secured, with their\n   security requirement specified in their respective\
    \ documents.\n"
