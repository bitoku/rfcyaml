  - "1.  Introduction\n   Small devices with limited CPU, memory, and power resources,\
    \ so-\n   called \"constrained devices\" (often used as sensors/actuators, smart\n\
    \   objects, or smart devices) can form a network, becoming \"constrained\n  \
    \ nodes\" in that network.  Such a network may itself exhibit\n   constraints,\
    \ e.g., with unreliable or lossy channels, limited and\n   unpredictable bandwidth,\
    \ and a highly dynamic topology.\n   Constrained devices might be in charge of\
    \ gathering information in\n   diverse settings, including natural ecosystems,\
    \ buildings, and\n   factories, and sending the information to one or more server\n\
    \   stations.  They might also act on information, by performing some\n   physical\
    \ action, including displaying it.  Constrained devices may\n   work under severe\
    \ resource constraints such as limited battery and\n   computing power, little\
    \ memory, and insufficient wireless bandwidth\n   and ability to communicate;\
    \ these constraints often exacerbate each\n   other.  Other entities on the network,\
    \ e.g., a base station or\n   controlling server, might have more computational\
    \ and communication\n   resources and could support the interaction between the\
    \ constrained\n   devices and applications in more traditional networks.\n   Today,\
    \ diverse sizes of constrained devices with different resources\n   and capabilities\
    \ are becoming connected.  Mobile personal gadgets,\n   building-automation devices,\
    \ cellular phones, machine-to-machine\n   (M2M) devices, and other devices benefit\
    \ from interacting with other\n   \"things\" nearby or somewhere in the Internet.\
    \  With this, the\n   Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a reality, built up out\
    \ of uniquely\n   identifiable and addressable objects (things).  Over the next\
    \ decade,\n   this could grow to large numbers [FIFTY-BILLION] of Internet-\n\
    \   connected constrained devices, greatly increasing the Internet's size\n  \
    \ and scope.\n   The present document provides a number of basic terms that have\
    \ been\n   useful in the standardization work for constrained environments.  The\n\
    \   intention is not to exhaustively cover the field but to make sure a\n   few\
    \ core terms are used consistently between different groups\n   cooperating in\
    \ this space.\n   In this document, the term \"byte\" is used in its now customary\
    \ sense\n   as a synonym for \"octet\".  Where sizes of semiconductor memory are\n\
    \   given, the prefix \"kibi\" (1024) is combined with \"byte\" to\n   \"kibibyte\"\
    , abbreviated \"KiB\", for 1024 bytes [ISQ-13].\n   In computing, the term \"\
    power\" is often used for the concept of\n   \"computing power\" or \"processing\
    \ power\", as in CPU performance.  In\n   this document, the term stands for electrical\
    \ power unless explicitly\n   stated otherwise.  \"Mains-powered\" is used as\
    \ a shorthand for being\n   permanently connected to a stable electrical power\
    \ grid.\n"

  - "2.  Core Terminology\n   There are two important aspects to _scaling_ within\
    \ the Internet of\n   Things:\n   o  scaling up Internet technologies to a large\
    \ number [FIFTY-BILLION]\n      of inexpensive nodes, while\n   o  scaling down\
    \ the characteristics of each of these nodes and of the\n      networks being\
    \ built out of them, to make this scaling up\n      economically and physically\
    \ viable.\n   The need for scaling down the characteristics of nodes leads to\n\
    \   \"constrained nodes\".\n"
- title: 2.1.  Constrained Nodes
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Constrained Nodes\n   The term \"constrained node\" is best defined by\
    \ contrasting the\n   characteristics of a constrained node with certain widely\
    \ held\n   expectations on more familiar Internet nodes:\n   Constrained Node:\
    \  A node where some of the characteristics that are\n      otherwise pretty much\
    \ taken for granted for Internet nodes at the\n      time of writing are not attainable,\
    \ often due to cost constraints\n      and/or physical constraints on characteristics\
    \ such as size,\n      weight, and available power and energy.  The tight limits\
    \ on\n      power, memory, and processing resources lead to hard upper bounds\n\
    \      on state, code space, and processing cycles, making optimization\n    \
    \  of energy and network bandwidth usage a dominating consideration\n      in\
    \ all design requirements.  Also, some layer-2 services such as\n      full connectivity\
    \ and broadcast/multicast may be lacking.\n   While this is not a rigorous definition,\
    \ it is grounded in the state\n   of the art and clearly sets apart constrained\
    \ nodes from server\n   systems, desktop or laptop computers, powerful mobile\
    \ devices such as\n   smartphones, etc.  There may be many design considerations\
    \ that lead\n   to these constraints, including cost, size, weight, and other\
    \ scaling\n   factors.\n   (An alternative term, when the properties as a network\
    \ node are not\n   in focus, is \"constrained device\".)\n   There are multiple\
    \ facets to the constraints on nodes, often applying\n   in combination, for example:\n\
    \   o  constraints on the maximum code complexity (ROM/Flash),\n   o  constraints\
    \ on the size of state and buffers (RAM),\n   o  constraints on the amount of\
    \ computation feasible in a period of\n      time (\"processing power\"),\n  \
    \ o  constraints on the available power, and\n   o  constraints on user interface\
    \ and accessibility in deployment\n      (ability to set keys, update software,\
    \ etc.).\n   Section 3 defines a small number of interesting classes (\"class-N\"\
    \n   for N = 0, 1, 2) of constrained nodes focusing on relevant\n   combinations\
    \ of the first two constraints.  With respect to available\n   power, [RFC6606]\
    \ distinguishes \"power-affluent\" nodes (mains-powered\n   or regularly recharged)\
    \ from \"power-constrained nodes\" that draw\n   their power from primary batteries\
    \ or by using energy harvesting;\n   more detailed power terminology is given\
    \ in Section 4.\n   The use of constrained nodes in networks often also leads\
    \ to\n   constraints on the networks themselves.  However, there may also be\n\
    \   constraints on networks that are largely independent from those of\n   the\
    \ nodes.  We therefore distinguish \"constrained networks\" from\n   \"constrained-node\
    \ networks\".\n"

    \ the Internet at the time of writing are not attainable.\n   Constraints may\
    \ include:\n   o  low achievable bitrate/throughput (including limits on duty\n\

    \      rate),\n   o  highly asymmetric link characteristics,\n   o  severe penalties\
    \ for using larger packets (e.g., high packet loss\n      due to link-layer fragmentation),\n\
    \   o  limits on reachability over time (a substantial number of devices\n   \

    \ reasons for this:\n   o  cost constraints on the network,\n   o  constraints\
    \ posed by the nodes (for constrained-node networks),\n   o  physical constraints\
    \ (e.g., power constraints, environmental\n      constraints, media constraints\
    \ such as underwater operation,\n      limited spectrum for very high density,\
    \ electromagnetic\n      compatibility),\n   o  regulatory constraints, such as\
    \ very limited spectrum availability\n      (including limits on effective radiated\
    \ power and duty cycle) or\n      explosion safety, and\n   o  technology constraints,\
    \ such as older and lower-speed technologies\n      that are still operational\

  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  LLN\n   A related term that has been used to describe the focus of the\
    \ IETF\n   ROLL working group is \"Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN)\".  The ROLL\n\
    \   (Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy) terminology document [RFC7102]\n   defines\
    \ LLNs as follows:\n      LLN: Low-Power and Lossy Network.  Typically composed\

    \      resources interconnected by a variety of links, such as IEEE\n      802.15.4\
    \ or low-power Wi-Fi.  There is a wide scope of application\n      areas for LLNs,\
    \ including industrial monitoring, building\n      automation (heating, ventilation,\
    \ and air conditioning (HVAC),\n      lighting, access control, fire), connected\
    \ home, health care,\n      environmental monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy\n\
    \      management, assets tracking, and refrigeration.\n   Beyond that, LLNs often\
    \ exhibit considerable loss at the physical\n   layer, with significant variability\
    \ of the delivery rate, and some\n   short-term unreliability, coupled with some\
    \ medium-term stability\n   that makes it worthwhile to both construct directed\
    \ acyclic graphs\n   that are medium-term stable for routing and do measurements\
    \ on the\n   edges such as Expected Transmission Count (ETX) [RFC6551].  Not all\n\

    \ the \"non-storing mode\" defined by\n   RPL (the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power\
    \ and Lossy Networks\n   [RFC6550]).  So, in the terminology of the present document,\

    \ from\n   the name of an IEEE 802.15.4 working group (low-rate wireless\n   personal\
    \ area networks (LR-WPANs)).  The expansion of the LoWPAN\n   acronym, \"Low-Power\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\", contains a hard-\n   to-justify \"Personal\"\

    \        Table 1: Classes of Constrained Devices (KiB = 1024 bytes)\n   As of\
    \ the writing of this document, these characteristics correspond\n   to distinguishable\
    \ clusters of commercially available chips and\n   design cores for constrained\
    \ devices.  While it is expected that the\n   boundaries of these classes will\
    \ move over time, Moore's law tends to\n   be less effective in the embedded space\
    \ than in personal computing\n   devices: gains made available by increases in\
    \ transistor count and\n   density are more likely to be invested in reductions\
    \ of cost and\n   power requirements than into continual increases in computing\
    \ power.\n   Class 0 devices are very constrained sensor-like motes.  They are\
    \ so\n   severely constrained in memory and processing capabilities that most\n\
    \   likely they will not have the resources required to communicate\n   directly\
    \ with the Internet in a secure manner (rare heroic, narrowly\n   targeted implementation\
    \ efforts notwithstanding).  Class 0 devices\n   will participate in Internet\
    \ communications with the help of larger\n   devices acting as proxies, gateways,\
    \ or servers.  Class 0 devices\n   generally cannot be secured or managed comprehensively\
    \ in the\n   traditional sense.  They will most likely be preconfigured (and will\n\
    \   be reconfigured rarely, if at all) with a very small data set.  For\n   management\
    \ purposes, they could answer keepalive signals and send on/\n   off or basic\
    \ health indications.\n   Class 1 devices are quite constrained in code space\
    \ and processing\n   capabilities, such that they cannot easily talk to other\
    \ Internet\n   nodes employing a full protocol stack such as using HTTP, Transport\n\
    \   Layer Security (TLS), and related security protocols and XML-based\n   data\
    \ representations.  However, they are capable enough to use a\n   protocol stack\
    \ specifically designed for constrained nodes (such as\n   the Constrained Application\
    \ Protocol (CoAP) over UDP [COAP]) and\n   participate in meaningful conversations\
    \ without the help of a gateway\n   node.  In particular, they can provide support\
    \ for the security\n   functions required on a large network.  Therefore, they\
    \ can be\n   integrated as fully developed peers into an IP network, but they\
    \ need\n   to be parsimonious with state memory, code space, and often power\n\
    \   expenditure for protocol and application usage.\n   Class 2 devices are less\
    \ constrained and fundamentally capable of\n   supporting most of the same protocol\
    \ stacks as used on notebooks or\n   servers.  However, even these devices can\
    \ benefit from lightweight\n   and energy-efficient protocols and from consuming\
    \ less bandwidth.\n   Furthermore, using fewer resources for networking leaves\
    \ more\n   resources available to applications.  Thus, using the protocol stacks\n\
    \   defined for more constrained devices on Class 2 devices might reduce\n   development\
    \ costs and increase the interoperability.\n   Constrained devices with capabilities\
    \ significantly beyond Class 2\n   devices exist.  They are less demanding from\
    \ a standards development\n   point of view as they can largely use existing protocols\
    \ unchanged.\n   The present document therefore does not make any attempt to define\n\
    \   classes beyond Class 2.  These devices can still be constrained by a\n   limited\
    \ energy supply.\n   With respect to examining the capabilities of constrained\
    \ nodes,\n   particularly for Class 1 devices, it is important to understand what\n\
    \   type of applications they are able to run and which protocol\n   mechanisms\
    \ would be most suitable.  Because of memory and other\n   limitations, each specific\
    \ Class 1 device might be able to support\n   only a few selected functions needed\
    \ for its intended operation.  In\n   other words, the set of functions that can\
    \ actually be supported is\n   not static per device type: devices with similar\
    \ constraints might\n   choose to support different functions.  Even though Class\
    \ 2 devices\n   have some more functionality available and may be able to provide\
    \ a\n   more complete set of functions, they still need to be assessed for\n \
    \  the type of applications they will be running and the protocol\n   functions\
    \ they would need.  To be able to derive any requirements,\n   the use cases and\
    \ the involvement of the devices in the application\n   and the operational scenario\
    \ need to be analyzed.  Use cases may\n   combine constrained devices of multiple\
    \ classes as well as more\n   traditional Internet nodes.\n"

    \ in available energy as\n   opposed to (or in addition to) being limited in available\
    \ power.\n   Where no relevant limitations exist with respect to energy, the\n\
    \   device is classified as E9.  The energy limitation may be in total\n   energy\

  - "4.3.  Strategies for Using Power for Communication\n   Especially when wireless\
    \ transmission is used, the radio often\n   consumes a big portion of the total\
    \ energy consumed by the device.\n   Design parameters, such as the available\
    \ spectrum, the desired range,\n   and the bitrate aimed for, influence the power\
    \ consumed during\n   transmission and reception; the duration of transmission\
    \ and\n   reception (including potential reception) influence the total energy\n\
    \   consumption.\n   Different strategies for power usage and network attachment\
    \ may be\n   used, based on the type of the energy source (e.g., battery or mains-\n\
    \   powered) and the frequency with which a device needs to communicate.\n   The\
    \ general strategies for power usage can be described as follows:\n   Always-on:\
    \  This strategy is most applicable if there is no reason\n      for extreme measures\
    \ for power saving.  The device can stay on in\n      the usual manner all the\
    \ time.  It may be useful to employ power-\n      friendly hardware or limit the\
    \ number of wireless transmissions,\n      CPU speeds, and other aspects for general\
    \ power-saving and cooling\n      needs, but the device can be connected to the\
    \ network all the\n      time.\n   Normally-off:  Under this strategy, the device\
    \ sleeps such long\n      periods at a time that once it wakes up, it makes sense\
    \ for it to\n      not pretend that it has been connected to the network during\n\
    \      sleep: the device reattaches to the network as it is woken up.\n      The\
    \ main optimization goal is to minimize the effort during the\n      reattachment\
    \ process and any resulting application communications.\n      If the device sleeps\
    \ for long periods of time and needs to\n      communicate infrequently, the relative\
    \ increase in energy\n      expenditure during reattachment may be acceptable.\n\
    \   Low-power:  This strategy is most applicable to devices that need to\n   \
    \   operate on a very small amount of power but still need to be able\n      to\
    \ communicate on a relatively frequent basis.  This implies that\n      extremely\
    \ low-power solutions need to be used for the hardware,\n      chosen link-layer\
    \ mechanisms, and so on.  Typically, given the\n      small amount of time between\
    \ transmissions, despite their sleep\n      state, these devices retain some form\
    \ of attachment to the\n      network.  Techniques used for minimizing power usage\
    \ for the\n      network communications include minimizing any work from re-\n\
    \      establishing communications after waking up and tuning the\n      frequency\
    \ of communications (including \"duty cycling\", where\n      components are switched\
    \ on and off in a regular cycle) and other\n      parameters appropriately.\n\
    \   Table 4 provides a summary of the strategies described above.\n   +------+--------------+---------------------------------------------+\n\

    \           Table 4: Strategies of Using Power for Communication\n   Note that\
    \ the discussion above is at the device level; similar\n   considerations can\
    \ apply at the communications-interface level.  This\n   document does not define\
    \ terminology for the latter.\n   A term often used to describe power-saving approaches\
    \ is \"duty-\n   cycling\".  This describes all forms of periodically switching\
    \ off\n   some function, leaving it on only for a certain percentage of time\n\
    \   (the \"duty cycle\").\n   [RFC7102] only distinguishes two levels, defining\
    \ a Non-Sleepy Node\n   as a node that always remains in a fully powered-on state\
    \ (always\n   awake) where it has the capability to perform communication (P9)\
    \ and\n   a Sleepy Node as a node that may sometimes go into a sleep mode (a\n\
    \   low-power state to conserve power) and temporarily suspend protocol\n   communication\
    \ (P0); there is no explicit mention of P1.\n"
