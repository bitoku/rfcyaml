- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are several large, operational X.400 services currently\n\
    \   deployed. Many of the organizations in these services are connected\n   to\
    \ the Internet.  A number of other Internet-connected organizations\n   are beginning\
    \ to operate internal X.400 services (for example, U.S.\n   government organizations\
    \ following U.S. GOSIP).  The motivation for\n   this document is to foster a\
    \ Global Open Message Handling System\n   (GO-MHS) Community that has full interoperability\
    \ with the existing\n   E-mail service based on RFC-822 (STD-11).\n   The goal\
    \ of this document is to unite regionally operated X.400\n   services on the various\
    \ continents into one GO-MHS Community (as seen\n   from an end-user's point of\
    \ view).  Examples of such regional\n   services are the COSINE MHS Service in\
    \ Europe and the XNREN service\n   in the U.S.\n   A successful GO-MHS Community\
    \ is dependent on decisions at both the\n   national and international level.\
    \ National X.400 service providers\n   are responsible for the implementation\
    \ of the minimum requirements\n   defined in this document. In addition to these\
    \ minimum requirements,\n   national requirements may be defined by each national\
    \ service\n   provider.\n   This document refers to other documents which are\
    \ published as RFCs.\n   These documents are [1], [2], [3], [4], [6] and [7] in\
    \ the reference\n   list.\n   This document handles issues concerning X.400 1984\
    \ and X.400 1988 to\n   1984 downgrading. Issues concerning pure X.400 1988 are\
    \ left for\n   further study.\n   We are grateful to Allan Cargille and Lawrence\
    \ Landweber for their\n   input and guidance on this paper. This paper is also\
    \ a product of\n   discussions in the IETF X.400 Operations WG and the RARE WG-MSG\n\
    \   (former RARE WG1 (on MHS)).\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document defines requirements, recommendations and\
    \ conventions.\n   Throughout the document, the following definitions apply: a\n\
    \   requirement is specified with the word shall.  A recommendation is\n   specified\
    \ with the word should.  A convention is specified with the\n   word might.  Conventions\
    \ are intended to make life easier for RFC-822\n   systems that don't follow the\
    \ host requirements.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Profiles
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Profiles\n   Different communities have different profile requirements.\
    \  The\n   following is a list of such profiles.\n    o U.S. GOSIP - unspecified\
    \ version\n    o ENV - 41201\n    o UK GOSIP for X.400(88)\n   In the case when\
    \ mail traffic is going from the RFC-822 mail service\n   to the GO-MHS Community,\
    \ the automatic return of contents when mail\n   is non-delivered should be requested\
    \ by RFC 1327 gateways and should\n   be supported at the MTA that generates the\
    \ non-delivery report.\n   However, it should be noted that this practice maximizes\
    \ the cost\n   associated with delivery reports.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Architecture of the GO-MHS Community\n   In order to facilitate a coherent\
    \ deployment of X.400 in the GO-MHS\n   Community it is necessary to define, in\
    \ general terms, the overall\n   structure and organization of the X.400 service.\
    \  This section is\n   broken into several parts which discuss management domains,\
    \ lower\n   layer connectivity issues, and overall routing issues.\n   The GO-MHS\
    \ Community will operate as a single MHS community, as\n   defined in reference\
    \ [1].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Management Domains
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Management Domains\n   The X.400 model supports connectivity between communities\
    \ with\n   different service requirements; the architectural vehicle for this\
    \ is\n   a Management Domain. Management domains are needed when different\n \
    \  administrations have different specific requirements.  Two types of\n   management\
    \ domains are defined by the X.400 model: an Administration\n   Management Domain\
    \ (ADMD) and a Private Management Domain (PRMD).\n   Throughout the world in various\
    \ countries there are different\n   organizational policies for MDs.  All of these\
    \ policies are legal\n   according to the X.400 standard.  Currently, X.400 service\
    \ providers\n   in a country (inside or outside the GO-MHS Community), are organized\n\
    \   as:\n    a) One or several ADMDs.\n    b) One or several PRMDs and with no\
    \ ADMDs present in\n       the country, or that are not connected to any ADMD.\n\
    \    c) One or several PRMDs connected to one or several ADMDs.\n   Or in combinations\
    \ of a), b) and c).  At this stage it is not\n   possible to say which model is\
    \ the most effective.  Thus, the GO-MHS\n   Community shall allow every model.\n"
- title: 2.2.  The RELAY-MTA
  contents:
  - "2.2.  The RELAY-MTA\n   The X.400 message routing decision process takes as input\
    \ the\n   destination O/R address and produces as output the name (and perhaps\n\
    \   connection information) of the MTA who will take responsibility of\n   delivering\
    \ the message to the recipient. The X.400 store and forward\n   model permits\
    \ a message to pass through multiple MTAs.  However, it\n   is generally accepted\
    \ that the most efficient path for a message to\n   take is one where a direct\
    \ connection is made from the originator to\n   the recipient's MTA.\n   Large\
    \ scale deployment of X.400 in the GO-MHS Community will require\n   a well deployed\
    \ directory infrastructure to support routing. In the\n   GO-MHS Community X.500\
    \ is considered to be the best protocol for such\n   an infrastructure.  In this\
    \ environment, a routing decision can be\n   made by searching the directory with\
    \ a destination O/R address in\n   order to obtain the name of the next hop MTA.\
    \ This MTA may be a\n   central entry point into an MD, or it may be the destination\
    \ MTA\n   within an MD.\n   Deployment of X.400 without a well deployed Directory\
    \ infrastructure,\n   will require the use of static tables to store routing information.\n\
    \   These tables (keyed on O/R addresses), will be used to map a\n   destination\
    \ O/R address to a next hop MTA.  In order to facilitate\n   efficient routing,\
    \ one could build a table that contains information\n   about every MTA in every\
    \ MD.  However, this table would be enormous\n   and very dynamic, so this is\
    \ not feasible in practice.  Therefore, it\n   is necessary to use the concept\
    \ of a RELAY-MTA.\n   The purpose of a RELAY-MTA is to act as a default entry\
    \ point into an\n   MD. The MTA that acts as a RELAY MTA for an MD shall be capable\
    \ of\n   accepting responsibility for all messages that it receives that are\n\
    \   destined for well-defined recipients in that MD.\n   The use of a RELAY-MTA\
    \ for routing is defined by reference [1].\n   RELAY-MTAs in the GO-MHS Community\
    \ shall route according to reference\n   [1].\n"
- title: 2.3.  Lower Layer Stack Incompatibilities
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Lower Layer Stack Incompatibilities\n   A requirement for successful operation\
    \ of the GO-MHS Community is\n   that all users can exchange messages. The GO-MHS\
    \ Community is not\n   dependent on the traditional TCP/IP lower layer protocol\
    \ suite.  A\n   variety of lower layer suites are used as carriers of X.400 messages.\n\

    \                 Figure 1: A Deployment Scenario\n   PRMD A has three RELAY-MTAs\
    \ which collectively provide support for\n   the TP0/CONS/X.25, TP0/RFC1006, and\
    \ TP4/CLNS stacks.  (Note: it is\n   acceptable for a single RELAY-MTA to support\
    \ more than one stack.\n   Three RELAY-MTAs are shown in this figure for clarity.)\
    \  Thus, PRMD A\n   is reachable via these stacks.  However, since PRMD B only\
    \ supports\n   the TP0/CONS/X.25 stack, it is not reachable from the TP0/RFC 1006\
    \ or\n   the TP4/CLNS stack. PRMD C supports TP0/RFC1006 and TP4/CLNS. Since\n\
    \   PRMD B and PRMD C do not share a common stack, how is a message from\n   PRMD\
    \ C to reach a recipient in PRMD B?\n   One solution to this problem is to require\
    \ that PRMD B implement a\n   stack in common with PRMD C. However this may not\
    \ be a politically\n   acceptable answer to PRMD B.\n   Another solution is to\
    \ implement a transport service bridge (TSB)\n   between TP0/RFC 1006 in PRMD\
    \ C to TP0/CONS in PRMD B.  This will\n   solve the problem for PRMD C and B.\
    \  However, the lack of coordinated\n   deployment of TSB technology makes this\
    \ answer alone unacceptable on\n   an international scale.\n   The solution to\
    \ this problem is to define a coordinated mechanism\n   that allows PRMD B to\
    \ advertise to the world that it has made a\n   bilateral agreement with PRMD\
    \ A to support reachability to PRMD B\n   from the TP0/RFC 1006 stack.\n   This\
    \ solution does not require that every MTA or MD directly support\n   all stacks.\
    \ However, it is a requirement that if a particular stack\n   is not directly\
    \ supported by an MD, the MD will need to make\n   bilateral agreements with other\
    \ MD(s) in order to assure that\n   connectivity from that stack is available.\n\
    \   Thus, in the case of Figure 1, PRMD B can make a bilateral agreement\n   with\
    \ PRMD A which provides for PRMD A to relay messages which arrive\n   on either\
    \ the TP4/CLNP stack or the TP0/RFC 1006 stack to PRMD B\n   using the TP0/CONS\
    \ stack.\n   The policies described in reference [1] define this general purpose\n\
    \   solution.  It is a requirement that all MDs follow the rules and\n   policies\
    \ defined by reference [1].\n"

    \  to facilitate the specification of RFC-822 addresses.  An X.400 user\n   can\
    \ address an RFC-822 recipient in the U.S. by constructing an X.400\n   address\
    \ such as:\n    C=us; ADMD=Internet; PRMD=Internet; DD.RFC-822=user(a)some.place.edu;\n\
    \   The first part of this address:\n    C=us; ADMD=Internet; PRMD=Internet;\n\
    \   denotes the U.S. portion of the Internet community and not a specific\n  \
    \ \"gateway\". The 2nd part:\n    DD.RFC-822=user(a)some.place.edu\n   is the\
    \ RFC-822 address of the RFC-822 mail user after substitution of\n   non-printable\
    \ characters according to reference [3]. The RFC-822\n   address is placed in\
    \ an X.400 Domain Defined Attribute of type RFC-\n   822 (DD.RFC-822).\n   Each\
    \ country is free to choose its own method of defining the RFC-822\n   community.\
    \  For example in Italy, an X.400 user would refer to an\n   RFC-822 user as:\n\
    \    C=IT; ADMD=MASTER400; DD.RFC-822=user(a)some.place.it\n   In the UK, an X.400\
    \ user would refer to an RFC-822 user as:\n    C=GB; ADMD= ; PRMD=UK.AC; O=MHS-relay;\
    \ DD.RFC-822=user(a)some.place.uk\n"

  - "3.3.2.  Specification of X.400 Addresses seen from the RFC-822 World\n   If an\
    \ X.400 organization has a defined RFC-822 address space, RFC-822\n   users will\
    \ be able to address X.400 recipients in RFC-822/Internet\n   terms.  This means\
    \ that the address of the X.400 user, seen from an\n   RFC-822 user, will generally\
    \ be of the form:\n    Firstname.Lastname@some.place.edu\n   where the some.place.edu\
    \ is a registered Internet domain.\n   This implies the necessity of maintaining\
    \ and distributing address\n   mapping tables to all participating RFC-1327 gateways.\
    \ The mapping\n   tables shall be globally consistent.  Effective mapping table\n\
    \   coordination procedures are needed.\n   If an organization does not have a\
    \ defined RFC-822 address space, an\n   escape mapping (defined in reference [3])\
    \ shall be used. In this\n   case, the address of the X.400 user, seen from an\
    \ RFC-822 user, will\n   be of the form:\n    \"/G=Firstname/S=Lastname/O=org\
    \ name/PRMD=foo/ADMD=bar/C=us/\"@\n                                    some.gateway.edu\n\
    \   Note that reference [7] specifies that quoted left-hand side\n   addresses\
    \ must be supported and that these addresses may be greater\n   than 80 characters\
    \ long.\n   This escape mapping shall also be used for X.400 addresses which do\n\
    \   not map cleanly to RFC-822 addresses.\n   It is recommended that an organization\
    \ with no defined RFC-822\n   address space, should register RFC-822 domains at\
    \ the appropriate\n   registration entity for such registrations. This will minimize\
    \ the\n   number of addresses which must use the escape mapping.\n   If the escape\
    \ mapping is not used, RFC-822 users will not see the\n   difference between an\
    \ Internet RFC-822 address and an address in the\n   GO-MHS Community.  For example:\n\
    \   The X.400 address:\n    C=us; ADMD=ATTMail; PRMD=CDC; O=CPG; S=Lastname; G=Firstname;\n\
    \   will from an RFC-822 user look like:\n       Firstname.Lastname@cpg.cdc.com\n"

  - "3.4.  Routing Policy\n   To facilitate routing in the GO-MHS Community before\
    \ an X.500\n   infrastructure is deployed, the following two documents, a RELAY-MTA\n\
    \   document and a Domain document, are defined.  These documents are\n   formally\
    \ defined in reference [1]. The use of these documents is\n   necessary to solve\
    \ the routing crisis that is present today. However,\n   this is a temporary solution\
    \ that will eventually be replaced by the\n   use of X.500.\n   The RELAY-MTA\
    \ document will define the names of RELAY-MTAs and their\n   associated connection\
    \ data including selector values, NSAP addresses,\n   supported protocol stacks,\
    \ and supported X.400 protocol version(s).\n   Each entry in the Domain document\
    \ consists of a sub-tree hierarchy of\n   an X.400 address, followed by a list\
    \ of MTAs which are willing to\n   accept mail for the address or provide a relay\
    \ service for it. Each\n   MTA name will be associated with a priority value.\
    \ Collectively, the\n   list of MTA names in the Domain document make the given\
    \ address\n   reachable from all protocol stacks. In addition, the list of MTAs\
    \ may\n   provide redundant paths to the address, so in this case, the priority\n\
    \   value indicates the preferred path, or the preferred order in which\n   alternative\
    \ routes should be tried.\n   The RELAY-MTA and Domain documents are coordinated\
    \ by the group\n   specified in the Community document.  The procedures for document\n\
    \   information gathering and distribution, are for further study.\n"
