Abstract This document updates RFC 3315 by redefining the default values for SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT and defining options through which a DHCPv6 server can override the client's default value for SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT with new values.
Introduction Section 5.5 of the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315] defines the default values of SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT to be 120 seconds.
In some circumstances, these defaults will lead to an unacceptably high volume of aggregated traffic at a DHCPv6 server.
The change to SOL MAX RT is in response to DHCPv6 message rates observed on a DHCPv6 server in a deployment in which many DHCPv6 clients are sending Solicit messages, but the DHCPv6 server has been configured not to respond to those Solicit messages.
While no explicit observations of traffic due to INF MAX RT have been conducted, this document updates INF MAX RT for consistency with SOL MAX RT.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Updates to SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT in RFC 3315
This document changes Section 5.5 of RFC 3315 as follows: OLD:
Max Solicit timeout value NEW:
3600 secs  Max Solicit timeout value OLD:
120 secs  Max Information request timeout value NEW:
secs  Max Information request timeout value With this change,
a DHCPv6 client that does not receive a satisfactory response will send Solicit or Information request messages with the same initial frequency and exponential backoff as specified in Sections 17.1.2 and 18.1.5 of RFC 3315.
However, the long term behavior of these DHCPv6 clients will be to send a Solicit or Information request message every 3600 seconds rather than every 120 seconds, significantly reducing the aggregated traffic at the DHCPv6 server.
A DHCPv6 server sends the SOL MAX RT option to a client to override the default value of SOL MAX RT.
The value of SOL MAX RT in the option replaces the default value defined in Section 3.
One use for the SOL MAX RT option is to set a longer value for SOL MAX RT, which reduces the Solicit traffic from a client that has not received a response to its Solicit messages.

INF MAX RT Option A DHCPv6 server sends the INF MAX RT option to a client to override the default value of INF MAX RT.
The value of INF MAX RT in the option replaces the default value defined in Section 3.
One use for the INF MAX RT option is to set a longer value for INF MAX RT, which reduces the Information request traffic from a client that has not received a response to its Information request messages.

Updates for SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT Options to RFC 3315 Update to RFC 3315, Section 17.1.3: OLD: The client MUST ignore any Advertise message that includes a Status Code option containing the value NoAddrsAvail, with the exception that the client MAY display the associated status message to the user.
NEW: The client MUST ignore any Advertise message that includes a Status Code option containing the value NoAddrsAvail, with the exception that the client MUST process an included SOL MAX RT option, MUST process an included INF MAX RT option, and MAY display the associated status message to the user.
Update to RFC 3315, Section 17.2.2: OLD: If the server will not assign any addresses to any IAs in a subsequent Request from the client, the server MUST send an Advertise message to the client that includes only a Status Code option with code NoAddrsAvail and a status message for the user, a Server Identifier option with the server's DUID, and a Client Identifier option with the client's DUID.
NEW: If the server will not assign any addresses to any IAs in a subsequent Request from the client, the server MUST send an Advertise message to the client that includes only a Status Code option with code NoAddrsAvail and a status message for the user, a Server Identifier option with the server's DUID, a Client Identifier option with the client's DUID, and (optionally) SOL MAX RT and/or INF MAX RT options.
Update to RFC 3315, Section 14 (Add text, clarifying client behavior while waiting for a response from a server): NEW: A client is not expected to listen for a response during the entire period between transmission of Solicit or Information request messages.
DHCPv6 Client Behavior A DHCPv6 client MUST include the SOL MAX RT option code in any Option Request option [RFC3315] it sends as required by RFC 3315.
A DHCPv6 client MUST include the INF MAX RT option code in any Option Request option it sends as required by RFC 3315.
A DHCPv6 client MUST silently ignore any SOL MAX RT or INF MAX RT option values that are less than 60 or more than 86400.
If a DHCPv6 client receives a message containing a SOL MAX RT option that has a valid value for SOL MAX RT, the client MUST set its internal SOL MAX RT parameter to the value contained in the SOL MAX RT option.
This value of SOL MAX RT is then used by the retransmission mechanism defined in Sections 14 and 17.1.2 of RFC 3315.
If a DHCPv6 client receives a message containing an INF MAX RT option that has a valid value for INF MAX RT, the client MUST set its internal INF MAX RT parameter to the value contained in the INF MAX RT option.
This value of INF MAX RT is then used by the retransmission mechanism defined in Sections 14 and 18.1.5 of RFC 3315.
Updated SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT values apply only to the network interface on which the client received SOL MAX RT and/or INF MAX RT options.
DHCPv6 Server Behavior Sections 17.2.2 and 18.2 of RFC 3315 govern server operation in regard to option assignment.
As a convenience to the reader, we mention here that the server will send options SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT only if configured with specific values for them, and the client requested those options using the Option Request option.
The DHCPv6 server MAY include the SOL MAX RT option in any response it sends to a client that has included the SOL MAX RT option code in an Option Request option.
The SOL MAX RT option is sent in the main body of the message to client, not as an encapsulated option in, e.g., an IA NA
, IA TA [RFC3315], or IA PD [RFC3633] option.
The DHCPv6 server MAY include the INF MAX RT option in any response it sends to a client that has included the INF MAX RT option code in an Option Request option.
The INF MAX RT option is sent in the main body of the message to client, not as an encapsulated option in, e.g., an IA NA, IA TA, or IA PD option.
There are no additional requirements for relays.
This document introduces one security consideration beyond those described in RFC 3315.
A malicious DHCPv6 server might cause a client to set its SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT parameters to an unreasonably high value with the SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT options, which may cause an undue delay in a client completing its DHCPv6 protocol transaction in the case no other valid response is received.
Assuming the client also receives a response from a valid DHCPv6 server, large values for SOL MAX RT and INF MAX RT will not have any effect.
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned one option code each for OPTION
SOL MAX RT (82) and OPTION INF MAX RT (83) from the "DHCP Option Codes" table of the "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)" registry.
