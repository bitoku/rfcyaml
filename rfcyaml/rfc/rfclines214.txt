As of August 21 we had performed the following verifications with the sites listed below.
These verifications were done on an arranged basis and do not indicate any degree of continuous availability.
In the category "NCP 107" the heading is somewhat misleading.
It does not indicate a thorough checkout of all the NCP functions described in Document 1 and RFC 107.
It only indicates that the NCP in question functioned to the extent required to respond to a RESET (a necessary condition for the Rand NCP to consider the remote host "up") and that the NCP performed the functions necessary for an ICP.
Thus, this column really indicates only a small degree of NCP completeness.
Such function as ECHO, Give Back, error message generation and so on were not checked.
We have checked some of these functions with UCSB and SDC but not exhaustively.
This is mainly due to the tedium of such a process.
BBN is currently writing a protocol certifier for their DDP 516 host that will do this automatically.
NCP 107  ICP 156  Telnet
the function has not been verified for the host x
the function has been verified for the host na  the function is not applicable to the host due to its operating system or intended network use ?
a comment follows for that function in that host COMMENTS:
both a server telnet and logger exist; however, they do not process the telnet messages correctly MIT Multics
we were only able to connect to an interim logger that sent a 'ts' message
the logger causes the system to crash following login
Any discrepancies should be noted via phone call.
This RFC will be updated in about one month.
