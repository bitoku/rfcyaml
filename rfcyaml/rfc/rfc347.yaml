  - "I suggest that for debugging and measurement purposes those hosts which\nare\
    \ willing implement an \"Echo\" process.\nThis echo process would listen for a\
    \ request for connection and execute\nthe Initial Connection Protocol (ICP) as\
    \ specified in NIC 7104 the\n\"Current Network Protocols\" notebook.  Upon completion\
    \ of the ICP the\necho process would wait for data from the network.  When the\
    \ data is\nreceived from the network it is echoed at once, (and the buffer space\
    \ is\nre-allocated).  By echoed I mean that the data received is sent back\nover\
    \ the network, bit for bit with no modification by the echo process.\nThe echo\
    \ process is terminated by closing the network connections.\nNote that BBN-TENEX\
    \ has had such an echo process available for use for a\nlong time.\n       [ This\
    \ RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online\
    \ RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.\
