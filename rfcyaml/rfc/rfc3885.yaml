  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Other Documents and Conformance\n   The model used for Message Tracking is
    described in [RFC-MTRK-MODEL].\n   Doing a Message Tracking query is intended
    as a \"last resort\"\n   mechanism.  Normally, Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)
    [RFC-DSN-\n   SMTP] and Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) [RFC-MDN] would\n
    \  provide the primary delivery status.  Only if the message is not\n   received,
    or there is no response from either of these mechanisms\n   should a Message Tracking
    query be issued.\n   The definition of the base64 token is imported from section
    6.8 of\n   [RFC-MIME].  Formally,\n      base64 =  %x2b / %x2f / %x30-39 / %x41-5a
    / %x61-7a\n   The definition of the DIGIT token is imported from [RFC-MSGFMT].\n
    \  Formally,\n      DIGIT =        %x30-39\n   Syntax notation in this document
    conforms to [RFC-ABNF].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
    14, RFC 2119\n   [RFC-KEYWORDS].\n"
  title: 1.  Other Documents and Conformance
- contents:
  - "2.  SMTP Extension Overview\n   The Message Tracking SMTP service extension uses
    the SMTP service\n   extension mechanism described in [RFC-ESMTP].  The following
    service\n   extension is hereby defined:\n   (1)   The name of the SMTP service
    extension is \"Message Tracking\".\n   (2)   The EHLO keyword value associated
    with this extension is\n         \"MTRK\".\n   (3)   No parameters are allowed
    with this EHLO keyword value.  Future\n         documents may extend this specification
    by specifying\n         parameters to this keyword value.\n   (4)   One optional
    parameter using the keyword \"MTRK\" is added to the\n         MAIL command.  In
    addition, the ENVID parameter of the MAIL\n         command (as defined in RFC
    3461) MUST be supported, with\n         extensions as described below.  The ORCPT
    parameter of the RCPT\n         command (as defined in RFC 3461) MUST also be
    supported.  All\n         semantics associated with ENVID and ORCPT described
    in RFC 3461\n         MUST be supported as part of this extension.\n   (5)   The
    maximum length of a MAIL command line is increased by 40\n         characters
    by the possible addition of the MTRK keyword and\n         value.  Note that the
    507 character extension of RCPT commands\n         for the ORCPT parameter and
    the 107 character extension of MAIL\n         commands for the ENVID parameter
    as mandated by RFC 3461 [RFC-\n         DSN-SMTP] must also be included.\n   (6)
    \  No SMTP verbs are defined by this extension.\n"
  title: 2.  SMTP Extension Overview
- contents:
  - "3.  The Extended MAIL Command\n   The extended MAIL command is issued by an SMTP
    client when it wishes\n   to inform an SMTP server that message tracking information
    should be\n   retained for future querying.  The extended MAIL command is identical\n
    \  to the MAIL command as defined in [RFC-SMTP], except that MTRK,\n   ORCPT,
    and ENVID parameters appear after the address.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  The MTRK parameter to the ESMTP MAIL command\n   Any sender wishing to
      request the retention of data for further\n   tracking of message must first
      tag that message as trackable by\n   creating two values A and B:\n      A =
      some-large-random-number\n      B = SHA1(A)\n   The large random number A is
      calculated on a host-dependent basis.\n   See [RFC-RANDOM] for a discussion
      of choosing good random numbers.\n   This random number MUST be at least 128
      bits but MUST NOT be more\n   than 1024 bits.\n   The 128-bit hash B of A is
      then computed using the SHA-1 algorithm as\n   described in [NIST-SHA1].\n   The
      sender then base64 encodes value B and passes that value as the\n   mtrk-certifier
      on the MAIL command:\n      mtrk-parameter  = \"MTRK=\" mtrk-certifier [ \":\"
      mtrk-timeout ]\n      mtrk-certifier  = base64        ; authenticator\n      mtrk-timeout
      \   = 1*9DIGIT      ; seconds until timeout\n   A is stored in the originator's
      tracking database to validate future\n   tracking requests as described in [RFC-MTRK-MTQP].
      \ B is stored in\n   tracking databases of compliant receiver MTAs and used
      to\n   authenticate future tracking requests.\n   The mtrk-timeout field indicates
      the number of seconds that the\n   client requests that this tracking information
      be retained on\n   intermediate servers, as measured from the initial receipt
      of the\n   message at that server.  Servers MAY ignore this value if it violates\n
      \  local policy.  In particular, servers MAY silently enforce an upper\n   limit
      to how long they will retain tracking data; this limit MUST be\n   at least
      one day.\n   If no mtrk-timeout field is specified then the server should use
      a\n   local default.  This default SHOULD be 8-10 days and MUST be at least\n
      \  one day.  Notwithstanding this clause, the information MUST NOT be\n   expired
      while the message remains in the queue for this server: that\n   is, an MTQP
      server MUST NOT deny knowledge of a message while that\n   same message sits
      in the MTA queue.\n   If the message is relayed to another compliant SMTP server,
      the MTA\n   acting as the client SHOULD pass an mtrk-timeout field equal to
      the\n   remaining life of that message tracking information.  Specifically,\n
      \  the tracking timeout is decremented by the number of seconds the\n   message
      has lingered at this MTA and then passed to the next MTA.  If\n   the decremented
      tracking timeout is less than or equal to zero, the\n   entire MTRK parameter
      MUST NOT be passed to the next MTA;\n   essentially, the entire tracking path
      is considered to be lost at\n   that point.\n   See [RFC-DELIVERYBY] section
      4 for an explanation of why a timeout is\n   used instead of an absolute time.\n"
    title: 3.1.  The MTRK parameter to the ESMTP MAIL command
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Use of ENVID\n   To function properly, Message Tracking requires that
      each message\n   have a unique identifier that is never reused by any other
      message.\n   For that purpose, if the MTRK parameter is given, an ENVID parameter\n
      \  MUST be included, and the syntax of ENVID from RFC 3461 is extended\n   as
      follows:\n      envid-parameter = \"ENVID=\" unique-envid\n      unique-envid
      \   = local-envid \"@\" fqhn\n      local-envid     = xtext\n      fqhn            =
      xtext\n   The unique-envid MUST be chosen in such a way that the same ENVID\n
      \  will never be used by any other message sent from this system or any\n   other
      system.  In most cases, this means setting fqhn to be the fully\n   qualified
      host name of the system generating this ENVID, and local-\n   envid to an identifier
      that is never re-used by that host.\n   In some cases, the total length of (local-envid
      + fqhn + 1) (for the\n   `@' sign) may exceed the total acceptable length of
      ENVID (100).  In\n   this case, the fqhn SHOULD be replaced by the SHA1(fqhn)
      encoded into\n   BASE64.  After encoding, the 160 bit SHA-1 will be a 27 octet
      string,\n   which limits local-envid to 72 octets.  Implementors are encouraged\n
      \  to use an algorithm for the local-envid that is reasonably unique.\n   For
      example, sequential integers have a high probability of\n   intersecting with
      sequential integers generated by a different host,\n   but a SHA-1 of the current
      time of day concatenated with the host's\n   IP address and a random number
      are unlikely to intersect with the\n   same algorithm generated by a different
      host.\n   Any resubmissions of this message into the message transmission\n
      \  system MUST assign a new ENVID.  In this context, \"resubmission\"\n   includes
      forwarding or resending a message from a user agent, but\n   does not include
      MTA-level aliasing or forwarding where the message\n   does not leave and re-enter
      the message transmission system.\n"
    title: 3.2.  Use of ENVID
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Forwarding Tracking Certifiers\n   MTAs SHOULD forward unexpired tracking
      certifiers to compliant\n   mailers as the mail is transferred during regular
      hop-to-hop\n   transfers.  If the \"downstream\" MTA is not MTRK-compliant,
      then the\n   MTRK= parameter MUST be deleted.  If the downstream MTA is DSN-\n
      \  compliant, then the ENVID and ORCPT parameters MUST NOT be deleted.\n   If
      aliasing, forwarding, or other redirection of a recipient occurs,\n   and the
      result of the redirection is exactly one recipient, then the\n   MTA SHOULD
      treat this as an ordinary hop-to-hop transfer and forward\n   the MTRK=, ENVID=,
      and ORCPT= values; these values MUST NOT be\n   modified except for decrementing
      the mtrk-timeout field of the MTRK=\n   value, which MUST be modified as described
      in section 4.1 above.\n   MTAs MUST NOT copy MTRK certifiers when a recipient
      is aliased,\n   forwarded, or otherwise redirected and the redirection results
      in\n   more than one recipient.  However, an MTA MAY designate one of the\n
      \  multiple recipients as the \"primary\" recipient to which tracking\n   requests
      shall be forwarded; other addresses MUST NOT receive\n   tracking certifiers.
      \ MTAs MUST NOT forward MTRK certifiers when\n   doing mailing list expansion.\n"

    '
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Denial of service\n   An attacker could attempt to flood the database
      of a server by\n   submitting large numbers of small, tracked messages.  In
      this case, a\n   site may elect to lower its maximum retention period retroactively.\n"
    title: 4.1.  Denial of service
  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Confidentiality\n   The mtrk-authenticator value (\"A\") must be hard
      to predict and not\n   reused.\n   The originating client must take reasonable
      precautions to protect\n   the secret.  For example, if the secret is stored
      in a message store\n   (e.g., a \"Sent\" folder), the client must make sure
      the secret isn't\n   accessible by attackers, particularly on a shared store.\n
      \  Many site administrators believe that concealing names and topologies\n   of
      internal systems and networks is an important security feature.\n   MTAs need
      to balance such desires with the need to provide adequate\n   tracking information.\n
      \  In some cases site administrators may want to treat delivery to an\n   alias
      as final delivery in order to separate roles from individuals.\n   For example,
      sites implementing \"postmaster\" or \"webmaster\" as\n   aliases may not wish
      to expose the identity of those individuals by\n   permitting tracking through
      those aliases.  In other cases, providing\n   the tracking information for an
      alias is important, such as when the\n   alias points to the user's preferred
      public address.\n   Therefore, implementors are encouraged to provide mechanisms
      by which\n   site administrators can choose between these alternatives.\n"
