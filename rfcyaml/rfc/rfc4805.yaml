  - "3.  Overview\n   These objects are used when the particular media being used
    to\n   realize an interface is a DS1/J1/E1/DS2/E2 interface.  At present,\n   this
    applies to the following value of the ifType variable in the\n   Internet-standard
    MIB:\n        ds1 (18)\n   The definitions contained herein are based on the AT&T
    T-1 Superframe\n   (a.k.a. D4) [ANSI-T1.107] and Extended Superframe (ESF) formats\n
    \  [AT&T-UM-305], [AT&T-TR-54016], the latter of which conforms to ANSI\n   specifications
    [ANSI-T1.403], and the CCITT Recommendations\n   [CCITT-G.703], [ITU-T-G.704],
    referred to as E1 for the rest of this\n   memo.  J1 refers to the definition
    presented in [JT-G704], [JT-G706],\n   and [JT-I431].\n   The various DS1, J1,
    and E1 line disciplines are similar enough that\n   separate MIBs are unwarranted,
    although there are some differences.\n   For example, Loss of Frame is defined
    more rigorously in the ESF\n   specification than in the D4 specification, or
    Yellow Alarm\n   generation and detection are a bit different between T1 and J1
    but in\n   both examples, there is definition in both related lines.  Therefore,\n
    \  interface types e1(19) and g703at2mb(67) have been obsoleted and\n   there
    is also no need for special type for J1.\n   Where it is necessary to distinguish
    between the flavors of E1 with\n   and without Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC),
    E1-CRC denotes the \"with\n   CRC\" form (G.704 Table 5B) and E1-noCRC denotes
    the \"without CRC\"\n   form (G.704 Table 5A).\n"

      - "3.2.1.  Usage of ifStackTable for Routers and DSUs\n   The object dsx1IfIndex
        has been deprecated.  This object previously\n   allowed a very special proxy
        situation to exist for routers and\n   Channel Service Units (CSUs).  This
        section now describes how to use\n   the ifStackTable to represent this relationship.\n
        \  The paragraphs discussing dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex have been\n   preserved
        in Appendix A for informational purposes.\n   The ifStackTable is used in
        the proxy case to represent the\n   association between pairs of interfaces,
        i.e., this T1 is attached to\n   that T1.  This use is consistent with the
        use of the ifStackTable to\n   show the association between various sub-layers
        of an interface.  In\n   both cases, entire PDUs are exchanged between the
        interface pairs --\n   in the case of a T1, entire T1 frames are exchanged;
        in the case of\n   PPP and High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC), entire HDLC
        frames are\n   exchanged.  This usage is not meant to suggest the use of the\n
        \  ifStackTable to represent Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)\n   connections
        in general.\n   External and Internal interface scenario: the SNMP agent resides
        on a\n   host external from the device supporting DS1 interfaces (e.g., a\n
        \  router).  The agent represents both the host and the DS1 device.\n   Example:\n
        \  A shelf full of CSUs connected to a router.  An SNMP agent residing\n   on
        the router proxies for itself and the CSU.  The router has also an\n   Ethernet
        interface:\n         +-----+\n   |     |     |\n   |     |     |               +---------------------+\n

        \  request\n       LineLoopback\n       PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)\n
        \      InwardLoopback\n       DualLoopback (Line + Inward)\n       NoLoopback\n
        \  The remote end can also request loopbacks either through the Facility\n
        \  Data Link (FDL) channel if ESF or inband if D4.  The loopbacks that\n   can
        be requested this way are\n       LineLoopback\n       PayloadLoopback (if
        ESF framing)\n       NoLoopback\n   To model the current state of loopbacks
        on a DS1 interface, the\n   object dsx1LoopbackStatus defines which loopback
        is currently applied\n   to an interface.  This object, which is a bitmap,
        will have bits\n   turned on that reflect the currently active loopbacks on
        the\n   interface as well as the source of those loopbacks.\n   The following
        restrictions/rules apply to loopbacks:\n   The far end cannot undo loopbacks
        set by a manager.\n   A manager can undo loopbacks set by the far end.\n   Both
        a line loopback and an inward loopback can be set at the same\n   time.  Only
        these two loopbacks can co-exist and either one may be\n   set by the manager
        or the far end.  A LineLoopback request from the\n   far end is incremental
        to an existing Inward loopback established by\n   a manager.  When a NoLoopback

        error event for an AMI-coded (AMI stands for Alternate Mark\n      Inversion)
        signal is the occurrence of a pulse of the same\n      polarity as the previous
        pulse (see T1.231, Section 4.2.1.1.1).  A\n      BPV error event for a B8ZS-

        as the previous pulse without\n      being a part of the zero substitution
        code.\n   Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) Error Event\n      An Excessive Zeroes error
        event for an AMI-coded signal is the\n      occurrence of more than fifteen
        contiguous zeroes (see T1.231\n      Section 4.2.1.1.2).  For a B8ZS-coded
        signal, the defect occurs\n      when more than seven contiguous zeroes are
        detected.\n   Line Coding Violation (LCV) Error Event\n      A Line Coding
        Violation (LCV) is the occurrence of either a\n      Bipolar Violation (BPV)
        or Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) error event.\n      (Also known as CV-L; see T1.231,

        Coding Violation error event is a frame synchronization bit\n      error in
        the D4 and E1-noCRC formats, or a CRC or frame synch. bit\n      error in
        the ESF and E1-CRC formats.  (Also known as CV-P; see\n      T1.231, Section

        the replication or deletion of the payload\n      bits of a DS1 frame (see
        T1.231, Section 4.2.1.2.3).  A Controlled\n      Slip may be performed when
        there is a difference between the\n      timing of a synchronous receiving

        is the occurrence of a particular density of Framing\n      Error events (see
        T1.231, Section 4.2.2.2.1).\n      For DS1 links, an Out of Frame defect is
        declared when the\n      receiver detects two or more framing errors within
        a 3-msec period\n      for ESF signals and 0.75 msec for D4 signals, or two
        or more\n      errors out of five or fewer consecutive framing bits.\n      For
        E1 links, an Out of Frame defect is declared when three\n      consecutive
        frame alignment signals have been received with an\n      error (see G.706,
        Section 4.1 [CCITT-G.706]).\n      For DS2 links, an Out of Frame defect is

        multiframe) are\n      received.  The OOF is cleared when three or more consecutive\n
        \     correct framing patterns are received.\n      Once an Out Of Frame Defect
        is declared, the framer starts\n      searching for a correct framing pattern.
        \ The Out of Frame defect\n      ends when the signal is in-frame.\n      In-frame
        occurs when there are fewer than two frame bit errors\n      within a 3-msec
        period for ESF signals and 0.75 msec for D4\n      signals.\n      For E1
        links, in-frame occurs when a) in frame N the frame\n      alignment signal
        is correct and b) in frame N+1 the frame\n      alignment signal is absent
        (i.e., bit 2 in TS0 is a one) and c) in\n      frame N+2 the frame alignment
        signal is present and correct (see\n      G.704, Section 4.1).\n   Alarm Indication
        Signal (AIS) Defect\n      For D4 and ESF links, the 'all ones' condition

        \     signal criteria for a period equal to or greater than T (see\n      G.775,
        Section 5.4).\n      For E1 links, the 'all-ones' condition is detected at
        the line\n      interface as a string of 512 bits containing fewer than three
        zero\n      bits (see O.162 [ITU-T-O.162], Section 3.3.2).\n      For DS2
        links, the DS2 AIS shall be sent from the NT1 to the user\n      to indicate
        a loss of the 6,312-kbps frame capability on the\n      network side.  The
        DS2 AIS is defined as a bit array of 6,312 kbps\n      in which all binary

        Second is a one-second interval containing one\n      or more controlled slips

        Errored Second (also known as Errored Second type B in\n      T1.231, Section

        Minutes\n      A Degraded Minute is one in which the estimated error rate
        exceeds\n      1E-6 but does not exceed 1E-3 (see G.821 [CCITT-G.821]).\n
        \     Degraded Minutes are determined by collecting all of the Available\n
        \     Seconds, removing any Severely Errored Seconds, grouping the\n      result
        in 60-second long groups, and counting a 60-second long\n      group (a.k.a.
        minute) as degraded if the cumulative errors during\n      the seconds present
        in the group exceed 1E-6.  Available seconds\n      are merely those seconds
        that are not Unavailable as described\n      below.\n   Unavailable Second
        (UAS)\n      Unavailable Seconds (UASs) are calculated by counting the number\n
        \     of seconds that the interface is unavailable.  The DS1 interface\n      is
        said to be unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous SESs, or\n      the
        onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure\n      States).  If
        the condition leading to the failure was immediately\n      preceded by one
        or more contiguous SESs, then the DS1 interface\n      unavailability starts
        from the onset of these SESs.  Once\n      unavailable, and if no failure
        is present, the DS1 interface\n      becomes available at the onset of 10
        contiguous seconds with no\n      SESs.  Once unavailable, and if a failure
        is present, the DS1\n      interface becomes available at the onset of 10
        contiguous seconds\n      with no SESs, if the failure clearing time is less
        than or equal\n      to 10 seconds.  If the failure clearing time is more
        than 10\n      seconds, the DS1 interface becomes available at the onset of
        10\n      contiguous seconds with no SESs, or the onset period leading to\n
        \     the successful clearing condition, whichever occurs later.  With\n      respect
        to the DS1 error counts, all counters are incremented\n      while the DS1
        interface is deemed available.  While the interface\n      is deemed unavailable,
        the only count that is incremented is UASs.\n      Note that this definition
        implies that the agent cannot determine\n      until after a 10-second interval
        has passed whether a given one-\n      second interval belongs to available
        or unavailable time.  If the\n      agent chooses to update the various performance
        statistics in real\n      time, then it must be prepared to retroactively
        reduce the ES,\n      BES, SES, and SEFS counts by 10 and increase the UAS
        count by 10\n      when it determines that available time has been entered.
        \ It must\n      also be prepared to adjust the PCV count and the DM count
        as\n      necessary since these parameters are not accumulated during\n      unavailable
        time.  It must be similarly prepared to retroactively\n      decrease the
        UAS count by 10 and increase the ES, BES, and DM\n      counts as necessary
        upon entering available time.  A special case\n      exists when the 10-second
        period leading to available or\n      unavailable time crosses a 900-second
        statistics window boundary,\n      as the foregoing description implies that
        the ES, BES, SES, SEFS,\n      DM, and UAS counts the PREVIOUS interval must
        be adjusted.  In\n      this case, successive GETs of the affected dsx1IntervalSESs
        and\n      dsx1IntervalUASs objects will return differing values if the first\n
        \     GET occurs during the first few seconds of the window.\n      The agent
        may instead choose to delay updates to the various\n      statistics by 10
        seconds in order to avoid retroactive adjustments\n      to the counters.
        \ A way to do this is sketched in Appendix B.\n   In any case, a linkDown
        trap shall be sent only after the agent has\n   determined for certain that
        the unavailable state has been entered,\n   but the time on the trap will
        be that of the first UAS (i.e., 10\n   seconds earlier).  A linkUp trap shall
        be handled similarly.\n   According to ANSI T1.231, unavailable time begins
        at the onset of 10\n   contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is, unavailable
        time\n   starts with the first of the 10 contiguous SESs.  Also, while an\n
        \  interface is deemed unavailable all counters for that interface are\n   frozen
        except for the UAS count.  It follows that an implementation\n   that strictly
        complies with this standard must not increment any\n   counters other than
        the UAS count -- even temporarily -- as a result\n   of anything that happens
        during those 10 seconds.  Since changes in\n   the signal state lag the data
        to which they apply by 10 seconds, an\n   ANSI-compliant implementation must
        pass the one-second statistics\n   through a 10-second delay line prior to
        updating any counters.  That\n   can be done by performing the following steps
        at the end of each\n   one-second interval.\n   i)   Read near/far end CV
        counter and alarm status flags from the\n        hardware.\n   ii)  Accumulate
        the CV counts for the preceding second and compare\n        them to the ES
        and SES threshold for the layer in question.\n        Update the signal state
        and shift the one-second CV counts and\n        ES/SES flags into the 10-element
        delay line.  Note that far-end\n        one-second statistics are to be flagged
        as \"absent\" during any\n        second in which there is an incoming defect
        at the layer in\n        question or at any lower layer.\n   iii) Update the
        current interval statistics using the signal state\n        from the previous
        update cycle and the one-second CV counts and\n        ES/SES flags shifted
        out of the 10-element delay line.\n   This approach is further described in
        Appendix B.\n"

        \     Alarm signal pattern occurs in at least seven out of ten\n      contiguous
        16-bit pattern intervals and is cleared if the Yellow\n      Alarm signal
        pattern does not occur in ten contiguous 16-bit\n      signal pattern intervals.
        \ For DS1 the patterns is FF00 and for J1\n      the pattern is FFFF.\n      For
        E1 links, the Far End Alarm failure is declared when bit 3 of\n      time-slot
        zero is received set to one on two consecutive\n      occasions.  The Far
        End Alarm failure is cleared when bit 3 of\n      time-slot zero is received
        set to zero.\n      For DS2 links, if a loss of frame alignment (LOF or LOS)
        and/or\n      DS2 AIS condition is detected, the RAI signal shall be generated\n
        \     and transmitted to the remote side.\n      The Remote Alarm Indication
        (RAI) signal is defined on m-bits as a\n      repetition of the 16-bit sequence
        consisting of eight binary '1s'\n      and eight binary '0s' in m-bits(1111111100000000).
        \ When the RAI\n      signal is not sent (in normal operation), the HDLC flag
        pattern\n      (01111110) in the m-bit is sent.\n      The RAI failure is
        detected when 16 or more consecutive RAI-\n      patterns (1111111100000000)
        are received.  The RAI failure is\n      cleared when 4 or more consecutive
        incorrect-RAI-patterns are\n      received.\n   Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)
        Failure\n      The Alarm Indication Signal failure is declared when an AIS
        defect\n      is detected at the input and the AIS defect still exists after
        the\n      Loss of Frame failure (which is caused by the unframed nature of\n
        \     the 'all-ones' signal) is declared.  The AIS failure is cleared\n      when
        the Loss of Frame failure is cleared.  (See T1.231, Section\n      4.3.1.2.2).\n
        \     An AIS defect at a 6312-kbit/s (G.704) interface is detected when\n
        \     the incoming signal has two or less zeroes in a sequence of 3156\n      bits
        (0.5ms).\n      The AIS signal defect is cleared when the incoming signal
        has\n      three {3} or more zeroes in a sequence of 3156 bits (0.5ms).\n
        \  Loss Of Frame (LOF) Failure\n      For DS1 links, the Loss of Frame failure
        is declared when an OOF\n      or LOS defect has persisted for T seconds,
        where 2 <= T <= 10.\n      The Loss of Frame failure is cleared when there
        have been no OOF\n      or LOS defects during a period T where 0 <= T <= 20.
        \ Many systems\n      will perform \"hit integration\" within the period T
        before\n      declaring or clearing the failure; e.g., see TR 62411\n      [AT&T-TR-62411].\n
        \     For E1 links, the Loss of Frame failure is declared when an OOF\n      defect
        is detected.\n   Loss Of Signal (LOS) Failure\n      For DS1, the Loss of
        Signal failure is declared upon observing\n      175 +/- 75 contiguous pulse
        positions with no pulses of either\n      positive or negative polarity.  The
        LOS failure is cleared upon\n      observing an average pulse density of at
        least 12.5% over a period\n      of 175 +/- 75 contiguous pulse positions
        starting with the receipt\n      of a pulse.\n      For E1 links, the Loss
        of Signal failure is declared when greater\n      than 10 consecutive zeroes
        are detected (see O.162, Section\n      3.4.4).\n      A LOS defect at 6312kbit/s
        interfaces is detected when the\n      incoming signal has \"no transitions\",
        i.e., when the signal level\n      is less than or equal to a signal level
        of 35dB below nominal, for\n      N consecutive pulse intervals, where 10
        <= N <= 255.\n      The LOS defect is cleared when the incoming signal has\n
        \     \"transitions\", i.e., when the signal level is greater than or\n      equal
        to a signal level of 9dB below nominal, for N consecutive\n      pulse intervals,
        where 10 <= N <= 255.\n      A signal with \"transitions\" corresponds to
        a G.703-compliant\n      signal.\n   Loopback Pseudo-Failure\n      The Loopback
        Pseudo-Failure is declared when the near-end\n      equipment has placed a
        loopback (of any kind) on the DS1.  This\n      allows a management entity
        to determine from one object whether\n      the DS1 can be considered to be
        in service or not (from the point\n      of view of the near-end equipment).\n
        \  TS16 Alarm Indication Signal Failure\n      For E1 links, the TS16 Alarm
        Indication Signal failure is declared\n      when time-slot 16 is received
        as all ones for all frames of two\n      consecutive multiframes (see G.732,
        Section 4.2.6).  This\n      condition is never declared for DS1.\n   Loss
        of MultiFrame Failure\n      The Loss of MultiFrame failure is declared when
        two consecutive\n      multiframe alignment signals (bits 4 through 7 of TS16
        of frame 0)\n      have been received with an error.  The Loss of Multiframe
        failure\n      is cleared when the first correct multiframe alignment signal
        is\n      received.  The Loss of Multiframe failure can only be declared for\n
        \     E1 links operating with G.732 [CCITT-G.732] framing (sometimes\n      called
        \"Channel Associated Signalling\" mode).\n   Far End Loss of Multiframe Failure\n
        \     The Far End Loss of Multiframe failure is declared when bit 2 of\n      TS16
        of frame 0 is received set to one on two consecutive\n      occasions.  The
        Far End Loss of Multiframe failure is cleared when\n      bit 2 of TS16 of
        frame 0 is received set to zero.  The Far End\n      Loss of Multiframe failure
        can only be declared for E1 links\n      operating in \"Channel Associated
        Signalling\" mode (see G.732).\n   DS2 Payload AIS Failure\n      The DS2
        Payload AIS failure is declared when the incoming signal\n      of the 6,312-kbps
        frame payload (time-slots 1 through 96) has two\n      or less zeroes in a
        sequence of 3072 bits (0.5ms).  The DS2\n      Payload AIS is cleared when
        the incoming signal of the 6,312-kbps\n      frame payload has three or more
        zeroes in a sequence of 3072 bits\n      (0.5 ms).\n   DS2 Performance Threshold
        Failure\n      DS2 Performance Threshold failure monitors equipment performance\n
        \     and is based on the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) procedure\n      defined
        in G.704.\n      The DS2 Performance Threshold failure is declared when the
        bit\n      error ratio exceeds 10^-4 (Performance Threshold), and the DS2\n
        \     Performance Threshold failure is cleared when the bit error ratio\n
        \     decreases to less than 10^-6.\"\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may
    be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The\n
    \  support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n   protection
    can have a negative effect on network operations.  The\n   specific objects and
    their sensitivities/vulnerabilities are as\n   follows.\n   Setting the following
    objects to incorrect values may result in\n   traffic interruptions:\n      dsx1LineType\n
    \     dsx1LineCoding\n      dsx1SendCode\n      dsx1LoopbackConfig\n      dsx1SignalMode\n
    \     dsx1TransmitClockSource\n      dsx1Fdl\n      dsx1LineLength\n      dsx1Channelization\n
    \     dsx1LineMode\n      dsx1LineBuildOut\n      dsx1LineImpedance\n   In the
    case of dsx1LineType, for example, both ends of a DS1/E1 must\n   have the same
    value in order for traffic to flow.  In the case of\n   dsx1SendCode and dsx1LoopbackConfig,
    for another example, traffic may\n   stop transmitting when particular loopbacks
    are applied.\n   Setting the following object to an incorrect value will not harm
    the\n   traffic, but it may cause a circuit to be misidentified and thereby\n
    \  create difficulties for service personnel when attempting to\n   troubleshoot
    a problem:\n      dsx1CircuitIdentifier\n   Setting the following object can cause
    an increase in the number of\n   traps received by the network management station:\n
    \     dsx1LineStatusChangeTrapEnable\n   The readable objects in this MIB module
    (i.e., the objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
    sensitive in\n   some environments since, collectively, they provide extensive\n
    \  information about the performance of interfaces in DS1/J1/E1/DS2/E2\n   equipment
    or networks and can reveal some aspects of their\n   configuration.  In such environments,
    it is important to control even\n   GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and
    possibly to encrypt the\n   values of these objects when sending them over the
    network via SNMP.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n
    \  Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even
    then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access
    and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n
    \  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as\n   provided
    by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support
    for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n
    \  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.
    \ Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic
    security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that the
    SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly configured
    to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n
    \  rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"

    the rules of choosing a number that is\n   greater than ifNumber and numbering
    the inside interfaces (e.g.,\n   equipment side) with even numbers and outside
    interfaces (e.g.,\n   network side) with odd numbers.\"\n   When the \"Old Definition\"
    was created, it was described this way to\n   allow a manager to treat the value
    as if it were an ifIndex; i.e.,\n   the value would be either:  1) an ifIndex
    value or 2) a value that\n   was guaranteed to be different from all valid ifIndex
    values.\n   The new definition is a subset of that definition; i.e., the value
    is\n   always an ifIndex value.\n   The following is Section 3.1 from RFC 1406:\n
    \     Different physical configurations for the support of SNMP with DS1\n      equipment
    exist.  To accommodate these scenarios, two different\n      indices for DS1 interfaces
    are introduced in this MIB.  These\n      indices are dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex.\n
    \     External interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed\n      DS1
    lines as external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing\n      on the device
    supporting DS1 interfaces directly):\n      For this scenario, all interfaces
    are assigned an integer value\n      equal to ifIndex, and the following applies:\n
    \        ifIndex=dsx1IfIndex=dsx1LineIndex for all interfaces.\n      The dsx1IfIndex
    column of the DS1 Configuration table relates each\n      DS1 interface to its
    corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the\n      Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II
    STD 17, RFC 1213) [RFC1213].\n      External & Internal interface scenario: the
    SNMP Agents resides on\n      a host external from the device supporting DS1 interfaces
    (e.g., a\n      router).  The Agent represents both the host and the DS1 device.\n
    \     The index dsx1LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS1\n      interfaces
    external from the host/DS1-device combination, but also\n      the DS1 interfaces
    connecting the host and the DS1 device.  The\n      index dsx1IfIndex is always
    equal to ifIndex.\n      Example:\n      A shelf full of CSUs connected to a router.
    \ An SNMP Agent\n      residing on the router proxies for itself and the CSU.
    \ The router\n      has also an Ethernet interface:\n            +-----+\n      |

    there is an ifEntry that is\n      directly associated with this and only this

    the statistical counters are correctly\n   updated at all times, although they

    interval counts are\n   transferred to the most recent interval entry and each
    interval is\n   shifted up by one position, with the oldest being discarded if\n
    \  necessary in order to make room.  The current interval counts then\n   start
    over from zero.  Note, however, that the signal state\n   calculation does not
    start afresh at each interval boundary;  rather,\n   signal state information
    is retained across interval boundaries.\n"
