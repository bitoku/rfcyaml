  - "Abstract\n   RFC 1591, \"Domain Name System Structure and Delegation\", laid\
    \ out the\n   basic administrative design and principles for the allocation and\n\
    \   administration of domains, from the top level down.  It was written\n   before\
    \ the introduction of the world wide web (WWW) and rapid growth\n   of the Internet\
    \ put significant market, social, and political\n   pressure on domain name allocations.\
    \  In recent years, 1591 has been\n   cited by all sides in various debates, and\
    \ attempts have been made by\n   various bodies to update it or adjust its provisions,\
    \ sometimes under\n   pressures that have arguably produced policies that are\
    \ less well\n   thought out than the original.  Some of those efforts have begun\
    \ from\n   misconceptions about the provisions of 1591 or the motivation for\n\
    \   those provisions.  The current directions of the Internet Corporation\n  \
    \ for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and other groups who now\n   determine\
    \ the Domain Name System (DNS) policy directions appear to be\n   drifting away\
    \ from the policies and philosophy of 1591.  This\n   document is being published\
    \ primarily for historical context and\n   comparative purposes, essentially to\
    \ document some thoughts about how\n   1591 might have been interpreted and adjusted\
    \ by the Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and ICANN to better reflect\
    \ today's\n   world while retaining characteristics and policies that have proven\n\
    \   to be effective in supporting Internet growth and stability.  An\n   earlier\
    \ variation of this memo was submitted to ICANN as a comment on\n   its evolving\
    \ Top-level Domain (TLD) policies.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 1591 [1] has been heavily discussed and referenced in\
    \ the last\n   year or two, especially in discussions within ICANN and its\n \
    \  predecessors about the creation, delegation, and management of top-\n   level\
    \ domains.  In particular, the ICANN Domain Name Supporting\n   Organization (DNSO),\
    \ and especially its ccTLD constituency, have been\n   the home of many discussions\
    \ in which 1591 and interpretations of it\n   have been cited in support of a\
    \ variety of sometimes-contradictory\n   positions.  During that period, other\
    \ discussions have gone on to try\n   to reconstruct the thinking that went into\
    \ RFC 1591.  Those in turn\n   have led me and others to muse on how that original\
    \ thinking might\n   relate to some of the issues being raised.  1591 is, I believe,\
    \ one\n   of Jon Postel's masterpieces, drawing together very different\n   philosophies\
    \ (e.g., his traditional view that people are basically\n   reasonable and will\
    \ do the right thing if told what it is with some\n   stronger mechanisms when\
    \ that model is not successful) into a single\n   whole.\n   RFC 1591 was written\
    \ in the context of the assumption that what it\n   described as generic TLDs\
    \ would be bound to policies and categories\n   of registration (see the \"This\
    \ domain is intended...\"  text in\n   section 2) while ccTLDs were expected to\
    \ be used primarily to support\n   users and uses within and for a country and\
    \ its residents.  The\n   notion that different domains would be run in different\
    \ ways --albeit\n   within the broad contexts of \"public service on behalf of\
    \ the\n   Internet community\" and \"trustee... for the global Internet\n   community\"\
    -- was considered a design feature and a safeguard against\n   a variety of potential\
    \ abuses.  Obviously the world has changed in\n   many ways in the seven or eight\
    \ years since 1591 was written.  In\n   particular, the Internet has become more\
    \ heavily used and, because\n   the design of the world wide web has put domain\
    \ names in front of\n   users, top-level domain names and registrations in them\
    \ have been\n   heavily in demand: not only has the number of hosts increased\n\
    \   dramatically during that time, but the ratio between registered\n   domain\
    \ names and physical hosts has increased very significantly.\n   The issues 1591\
    \ attempted to address when it was written and those we\n   face today have not\
    \ changed significantly in principle.  But one\n   alternative to present trends\
    \ would be to take a step back to refine\n   it into a model that can function\
    \ effectively today.  Therefore, it\n   may be useful to try to reconstruct 1591's\
    \ principles and think about\n   their applicability today as a model that could\
    \ continue to be\n   applied: not because it is historically significant, but\
    \ because many\n   of its elements have proven to work reasonably well, even in\n\
    \   difficult situations.  In particular, for many domains (some in\n   1591's\
    \ \"generic\" list and others in its \"country code\" category) the\n   notion\
    \ of \"public service\" --expected then to imply being carried out\n   at no or\
    \ minimal cost to the users, not merely on a non-profit\n   basis-- has yielded\
    \ to profitability calculations.  And, in most of\n   the rest, considerations\
    \ of at least calculating and recovering costs\n   have crept in.  While many\
    \ of us feel some nostalgia for the old\n   system, it is clear that its days\
    \ are waning if not gone: perhaps the\n   public service notions as understood\
    \ when 1591 was written just don't\n   scale to rapid internet growth and very\
    \ large numbers of\n   yregistrations.\n   In particular, some ccTLDs have advertised\
    \ for registrations outside\n   the designated countries (or other entities),\
    \ while others have made\n   clear decisions to allow registrations by non-nationals.\
    \  These\n   decisions and others have produced protests from many sides,\n  \
    \ suggesting, in turn, that a recategorization is in order.  For\n   example,\
    \ we have heard concerns by governments and managers of\n   traditional, \"public\
    \ service\", in-country, ccTLDs about excessive\n   ICANN interference and fears\
    \ of being forced to conform to\n   internationally-set policies for dispute resolution\
    \ when their\n   domestic ones are considered more appropriate.  We have also\
    \ heard\n   concerns from registrars and operators of externally-marketed ccTLDs\n\
    \   about unreasonable government interference and from gTLD registrars\n   and\
    \ registries about unreasonable competition from aggressively\n   marketed ccTLDs.\
    \  The appropriate distinction is no longer between\n   what RFC 1591 described\
    \ as \"generic\" TLDs (but which were really\n   intended to be \"purpose-specific\"\
    , a term I will use again below) and\n   ccTLDs but among:\n      (i) true \"\
    generic\" TLDs, in which any registration is acceptable\n      and, ordinarily,\
    \ registrations from all sources are actively\n      promoted.  This list currently\
    \ includes (the formerly purpose-\n      specific) COM, NET, and ORG, and some\
    \ ccTLDs.  There have been\n      proposals from time to time for additional TLDs\
    \ of this variety in\n      which, as with COM (and, more recently, NET and ORG)\
    \ anyone\n      (generally subject only to name conflicts and national law) could\n\
    \      register who could pay the fees.\n      (ii) purpose-specific TLDs, in\
    \ which registration is accepted only\n      from organizations or individuals\
    \ meeting particular\n      qualifications, but where those qualifications are\
    \ not tied to\n      national boundaries.  This list currently includes INT, EDU,\
    \ the\n      infrastructure domain ARPA, and, arguably, the specialized US\n \
    \     Government TLDs MIL and GOV.  There have been proposals from time\n    \
    \  to time for other international TLDs of this variety, e.g., for\n      medical\
    \ entities such as physicians and hospitals and for museums.\n      ICANN has\
    \ recently approved several TLDs of this type and\n      describes them as \"\
    sponsored\" TLDs.\n      (iii) Country domains, operated according to the original\n\
    \      underlying assumptions of 1591, i.e., registrants are largely\n      expected\
    \ to be people or other entities within the country.  While\n      external registrations\
    \ might be accepted by some of these, the\n      country does not aggressively\
    \ advertise for such registrations,\n      nor does anyone expect to derive significant\
    \ fee revenue from\n      them.  All current domains in this category are ccTLDs,\
    \ but not\n      all ccTLDs are in this category.\n   These categories are clearly\
    \ orthogonal to the association between\n   the use of the IS 3166-1 registered\
    \ code list [2] and two-letter\n   \"country\" domain names.  If that relationship\
    \ is to be maintained\n   (and I believe it is desirable), the only inherent requirement\
    \ is\n   that no two-letter TLDs be created except from that list (in order to\n\
    \   avoid future conflicts).  ICANN should control the allocation and\n   delegation\
    \ of TLDs using these, and other, criteria, but only\n   registered 3166-1 two\
    \ letter codes should be used as two-letter TLDs.\n"
- title: 2. Implications of the Categories
  contents:
  - "2. Implications of the Categories\n   If we had adopted this type of three-way\
    \ categorization and could\n   make it work, I believe it would have presented\
    \ several opportunities\n   for ICANN and the community more generally to reduce\
    \ controversies\n   and move forward.  Of course, there will be cases where the\n\
    \   categorization of a particular domain and its operating style will\n   not\
    \ be completely clear-cut (see section 3, below).  But having ICANN\n   work out\
    \ procedures for dealing with those (probably few) situations\n   appears preferable\
    \ to strategies that would tend to propel ICANN into\n   areas that are beyond\
    \ its competence or that might require\n   significant expansion of its mandate.\n\
    \   First, the internally-operated ccTLDs (category iii above) should not\n  \
    \ be required to have much interaction with ICANN or vice versa.  Once\n   a domain\
    \ of this sort is established and delegated, and assuming that\n   the \"admin\
    \ contact in the country\" rule is strictly observed, the\n   domain should be\
    \ able to function effectively without ICANN\n   intervention or oversight.  In\
    \ particular, while a country might\n   choose to adopt the general ICANN policies\
    \ about dispute resolution\n   or name management, issues that arise in these\
    \ areas might equally\n   well be dealt with exclusively under applicable national\
    \ laws.  If a\n   domain chooses to use ICANN services that cost resources to\
    \ provide,\n   it should contribute to ICANN's support, but, if it does not, ICANN\n\
    \   should not presume to charge it for other than a reasonable fraction\n   of\
    \ the costs to ICANN of operating the root, root servers, and any\n   directory\
    \ systems that are generally agreed upon to be necessary and\n   in which the\
    \ domain participates.\n   By contrast, ccTLDs operated as generic domains ought\
    \ to be treated\n   as generic domains.  ICANN dispute resolution and name management\n\
    \   policies and any special rules developed to protect the Internet\n   public\
    \ in multiple registrar or registry situations should reasonably\n   apply.\n"
- title: 3.  Telling TLD types apart
  contents:
  - "3.  Telling TLD types apart\n   If appropriate policies are adopted, ccTLDs operated\
    \ as generic\n   domains (category (i) above) and those operated as country domains\n\
    \   (category (iii) above) ought to be able to be self-identified.  There\n  \
    \ are several criteria that could be applied to make this\n   determination. \
    \ For example, either a domain is aggressively seeking\n   outside registrations\
    \ or it is not and either the vast majority of\n   registrants in a domain are\
    \ in-country or they are not.  One could\n   also think of this as the issue of\
    \ having some tangible level of\n   presence in the jurisdiction - e.g., is the\
    \ administrative contact\n   subject, in practical terms, to the in-country laws,\
    \ or are the\n   registration rules such that it is reasonably likely that a court\
    \ in\n   the jurisdiction of the country associated with the domain can\n   exercise\
    \ jurisdiction and enforce a judgment against the registrant.\n   One (fairly\
    \ non-intrusive) rule ICANN might well impose on all top-\n   level domains is\
    \ that they identify and publish the policies they\n   intend to use.  E.g., registrants\
    \ in a domain that will use the laws\n   of one particular country to resolve\
    \ disputes should have a\n   reasonable opportunity to understand those policies\
    \ prior to\n   registration and to make other arrangements (e.g., to register\n\
    \   elsewhere) if that mechanism for dispute resolution is not\n   acceptable.\
    \  Giving IANA (as the root registrar) incorrect\n   information about the purpose\
    \ and use of a domain should be subject\n   to challenge, and should be grounds\
    \ for reviewing the appropriateness\n   of the domain delegation, just as not\
    \ acting consistently and\n   equitably provides such grounds under the original\
    \ provisions of RFC\n   1591.\n   In order to ensure the availability of accurate\
    \ and up-to-date\n   registration information the criteria must be consistent,\
    \ and\n   consistent with more traditional gTLDs, for all nominally country\n\
    \   code domains operating as generic TLDs.\n"
- title: 4. The role of ICANN in country domains
  contents:
  - "4. The role of ICANN in country domains\n   ICANN (and IANA) should, as described\
    \ above, have as little\n   involvement as possible in the direction of true country\
    \ [code]\n   domains (i.e., category (iii)).  There is no particular reason why\n\
    \   these domains should be subject to ICANN regulation beyond the basic\n   principles\
    \ of 1591 and associated arrangements needed to ensure\n   Internet interoperability\
    \ and stability.\n   ICANN's avoiding such involvement strengthens it: the desirability\
    \ of\n   avoiding collisions with national sovereignty, determinations about\n\
    \   government legitimacy, and the authority of someone purportedly\n   writing\
    \ on behalf of a government, is as important today as it was\n   when 1591 was\
    \ written.  The alternatives take us quickly from\n   \"administration\" into\
    \ \"internet governance\" or, in the case of\n   determining which claimant is\
    \ the legitimate government of a country,\n   \"international relations\", and\
    \ the reasons for not moving in that\n   particular direction are legion.\n"
- title: 5. The role of governments
  contents:
  - "5. The role of governments\n   The history of IANA strategy in handling ccTLDs\
    \ included three major\n   \"things to avoid\" considerations:\n      * Never\
    \ get involved in determining which entities were countries\n        and which\
    \ ones were not.\n      * Never get involved in determining who was, or was not,\
    \ the\n        legitimate government of a country.  And, more generally, avoid\n\
    \        deciding what entity --government, religion, commercial,\n        academic,\
    \ etc.-- has what legitimacy or rights.\n      * If possible, never become involved\
    \ in in-country disputes.\n        Instead, very strongly encourage internal parties\
    \ to work\n        problems out among themselves.  At most, adopt a role as\n\
    \        mediator and educator, rather than judge, unless abuses are very\n  \
    \      clear and clearly will not be settled by any internal mechanism.\n   All\
    \ three considerations were obviously intended to avoid IANA's\n   being dragged\
    \ into a political morass in which it had (and, I\n   suggest, has) no competence\
    \ to resolve the issues and could only get\n   bogged down.  The first consideration\
    \ was the most visible (and the\n   easiest) and was implemented by strict and\
    \ careful adherence (see\n   below) to the ISO 3166 registered Country Code list.\
    \  If an entity\n   had a code, it was eligible to be registered with a TLD (although\n\
    \   IANA was free to apply additional criteria-most of them stated in\n   1591).\
    \  If it did not, there were no exceptions: the applicant's only\n   recourse\
    \ was a discussion with the 3166 Registration Authority (now\n   Maintenance Agency,\
    \ often known just as \"3166/MA\") or the UN\n   Statistical Office (now Statistics\
    \ Bureau), not with IANA.\n   There are actually five ccTLD exceptions to the\
    \ strict rules.  One,\n   \"UK\", is historical: it predates the adoption of ISO\
    \ 3166 for this\n   purpose.  The others --Ascension Island, Guernsey, Isle of\
    \ Man, and\n   Jersey --are arguably, at least in retrospect, just mistakes.\n\
    \   Regardless of the historical reasons (about which there has been much\n  \
    \ speculation), it is almost certainly the case that the right way to\n   handle\
    \ mistakes of this sort is to acknowledge them and move on,\n   rather than trying\
    \ to use them as precedents to justify more\n   mistakes.\n   This, obviously,\
    \ is also the argument against use of the \"reserved\"\n   list (technically internal\
    \ to the 3166 maintenance activity, and not\n   part of the Standard): since IANA\
    \ (or ICANN) can ask that a name be\n   placed on that list, there is no rule\
    \ of an absolute determination by\n   an external organization.  Purported countries\
    \ can come to ICANN,\n   insist on having delegations made and persuade ICANN\
    \ to ask that the\n   names be reserved.  Then, since the reserved name would\
    \ exist, they\n   could insist that the domain be delegated.  Worse, someone could\
    \ use\n   another organization to request reservation of the name by 3166/MA;\n\
    \   once it was reserved, ICANN might be hard-pressed not to do the\n   delegation.\
    \  Of course, ICANN could (and probably would be forced to)\n   adopt additional\
    \ criteria other than appearance on the \"reserved\n   list\" in order to delegate\
    \ such domains.  But those criteria would\n   almost certainly be nearly equivalent\
    \ to determining which applicants\n   were legitimate and stable enough to be\
    \ considered a country, the\n   exact decision process that 1591 strove to avoid.\n\
    \   The other two considerations were more subtle and not always\n   successful:\
    \ from time to time, both before and after the formal\n   policy shifted toward\
    \ \"governments could have their way\", IANA\n   received letters from people\
    \ purporting to be competent government\n   authorities asking for changes.  Some\
    \ of them turned out later to not\n   have that authority or appropriate qualifications.\
    \  The assumption of\n   1591 itself was that, if the \"administrative contact\
    \ in country\" rule\n   was strictly observed, as was the rule that delegation\
    \ changes\n   requested by the administrative contact would be honored, then,\
    \ if a\n   government _really_ wanted to assert itself, it could pressure the\n\
    \   administrative contact into requesting the changes it wanted, using\n   whatever\
    \ would pass for due process in that country.  And the ability\n   to apply that\
    \ process and pressure would effectively determine who\n   was the government\
    \ and who wasn't, and would do so far more\n   effectively than any IANA evaluation\
    \ of, e.g., whether the letterhead\n   on a request looked authentic (and far\
    \ more safely for ICANN than\n   asking the opinion of any particular other government\
    \ or selection of\n   governments).\n   Specific language in 1591 permitted IANA\
    \ to adopt a \"work it out\n   yourselves; if we have to decide, we will strive\
    \ for a solution that\n   is not satisfactory to any party\" stance.  That approach\
    \ was used\n   successfully, along with large doses of education, on many occasions\n\
    \   over the years, to avoid IANA's having to assume the role of judge\n   between\
    \ conflicting parties.\n   Similar principles could be applied to the boundary\
    \ between country-\n   code-based generic TLDs and country domains.  Different\
    \ countries,\n   under different circumstances, might prefer to operate the ccTLD\n\
    \   either as a national service or as a profit center where the\n   \"customers\"\
    \ were largely external.  Whatever decisions were made\n   historically, general\
    \ Internet stability argues that changes should\n   not be made lightly.  At the\
    \ same time, if a government wishes to\n   make a change, the best mechanism for\
    \ doing so is not to involve\n   ICANN in a potential determination of legitimacy\
    \ (or even to have\n   ICANN's Government Advisory Committee (GAC) try to formally\
    \ make that\n   decision for individual countries) but for the relevant government\
    \ to\n   use its own procedures to persuade the administrative contact to\n  \
    \ request the change and for IANA to promptly and efficiently carry out\n   requests\
    \ made by administrative contacts.\n"
