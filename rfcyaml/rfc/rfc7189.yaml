    it can support an arbitrary\n   combination of CV modes advertised in the CV Types
    field of the VCCV\n   Interface Parameter sub-TLV [RFC4446] [RFC4447].  Currently,
    six\n   types of CV have been defined for PW VCCV.  This document introduces\n
    \  four new CV types and, to accommodate them, a new VCCV Extended CV\n   parameter
    for the PW Interface Parameters Sub-TLV is defined.\n"

      lists types of CV monitoring that\n   a PE is capable of supporting.  The VCCV
      Extended CV parameter sub-\n   TLV MUST appear in combination with the VCCV
