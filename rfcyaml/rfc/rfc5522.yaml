  - "1.  Introduction\n   As background, the Network Mobility (NEMO) terminology and\
    \ NEMO goals\n   and requirements documents are suggested reading ([4], [5]).\n\
    \   The base NEMO standard [1] extends Mobile IPv6 [2] for singular\n   mobile\
    \ hosts in order to be used by Mobile Routers (MRs) supporting\n   entire mobile\
    \ networks.  NEMO allows mobile networks to efficiently\n   remain reachable via\
    \ fixed IP address prefixes no matter where they\n   relocate within the network\
    \ topology.  This is accomplished through\n   the maintenance of a bidirectional\
    \ tunnel between a NEMO MR and a\n   NEMO-supporting Home Agent (HA) placed at\
    \ some relatively stable\n   point in the network.  NEMO does not provide Mobile\
    \ IPv6's Route\n   Optimization (RO) features to Mobile Network Nodes (MNNs) other\
    \ than\n   to the NEMO MR itself.  Corresponding Nodes (CNs) that communicate\n\
    \   with MNNs behind an MR do so through the HA and the bidirectional\n   Mobile\
    \ Router - Home Agent (MRHA) tunnel.  Since the use of this\n   tunnel may have\
    \ significant drawbacks [6], RO techniques that allow a\n   more direct path between\
    \ the CN and MR to be used are highly\n   desirable.\n   For decades, mobile networks\
    \ of some form have been used for\n   communications with people and avionics\
    \ equipment on board aircraft\n   and spacecraft.  These have not typically used\
    \ IP, although\n   architectures are being devised and deployed based on IP in\
    \ both the\n   aeronautics and space exploration communities (see Appendix A and\n\
    \   Appendix B for more information).  An aircraft or spacecraft\n   generally\
    \ contains many computing nodes, sensors, and other devices\n   that are possible\
    \ to address individually with IPv6.  This is\n   desirable to support network-centric\
    \ operations concepts.  Given that\n   a craft has only a small number of access\
    \ links, it is very natural\n   to use NEMO MRs to localize the functions needed\
    \ to manage the large\n   onboard network's reachability over the few dynamic\
    \ access links.  On\n   an aircraft, the nodes are arranged in multiple, independent\n\
    \   networks, based on their functions.  These multiple networks are\n   required\
    \ for regulatory reasons to have different treatments of their\n   air-ground\
    \ traffic and must often use distinct air-ground links and\n   service providers.\n\
    \   For aeronautics, the main disadvantage of using NEMO bidirectional\n   tunnels\
    \ is that airlines operate flights that traverse multiple\n   continents, and\
    \ a single plane may fly around the entire world over a\n   span of a couple days.\
    \  If a plane uses a static HA on a single\n   continent, then for a large percentage\
    \ of the time, when the plane is\n   not on the same continent as the HA, a great\
    \ amount of delay is\n   imposed by using the MRHA tunnel.  Avoiding the delay\
    \ from\n   unnecessarily forcing packets across multiple continents is the\n \
    \  primary goal of pursuing NEMO RO for aeronautics.\n   Other properties of the\
    \ aeronautics and space environments amplify\n   the known issues with NEMO bidirectional\
    \ MRHA tunnels [6] even\n   further.\n      Longer routes leading to increased\
    \ delay and additional\n      infrastructure load:\n         In aeronautical networks\
    \ (e.g., using \"Plain Old\" Aircraft\n         Communication Addressing and Reporting\
    \ System (ACARS) or ACARS\n         over VHF Data Link (VDL) mode 2) the queueing\
    \ delays are often\n         long due to Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) mechanisms\
    \ and\n         underprovisioned radio links.  Furthermore, for space\n      \
    \   exploration and for aeronautical communications systems that\n         pass\
    \ through geosynchronous satellites, the propagation delays\n         are also\
    \ long.  These delays, combined with the additional need\n         to cross continents\
    \ in order to transport packets between\n         ground stations and CNs, mean\
    \ that delays are already quite\n         high in aeronautical and space networks\
    \ without the addition of\n         an MRHA tunnel.  The increased delays caused\
    \ by MRHA tunnels\n         may be unacceptable in meeting Required Communication\n\
    \         Performance [7].\n      Increased packet overhead:\n         Given the\
    \ constrained link bandwidths available in even future\n         communications\
    \ systems for aeronautics and space exploration,\n         planners are extremely\
    \ adverse to header overhead.  Since any\n         amount of available link capacity\
    \ can be utilized for extra\n         situational awareness, science data, etc.,\
    \ every byte of\n         header/tunnel overhead displaces a byte of useful data.\n\
    \      Increased chances of packet fragmentation:\n         RFC 4888 [6] identifies\
    \ fragmentation due to encapsulation as\n         an artifact of tunneling.  While\
    \ links used in the aeronautics\n         and space domains are error-prone and\
    \ may cause loss of\n         fragments on the initial/final hop(s), considerations\
    \ for\n         fragmentation along the entire tunneled path are the same as\n\
    \         for the terrestrial domain.\n      Increased susceptibility to failure:\n\
    \         The additional likelihood of either a single link failure\n        \
    \ disrupting all communications or an HA failure disrupting all\n         communications\
    \ is problematic when using MRHA tunnels for\n         command and control applications\
    \ that require high availability\n         for safety-of-life or safety-of-mission.\n\
    \   For these reasons, an RO extension to NEMO is highly desirable for\n   use\
    \ in aeronautical and space networking.  In fact, a standard RO\n   mechanism\
    \ may even be necessary before some planners will seriously\n   consider advancing\
    \ use of the NEMO technology from experimental\n   demonstrations to operational\
    \ use within their communications\n   architectures.  Without an RO solution,\
    \ NEMO is difficult to justify\n   for realistic operational consideration.\n\
    \   In Section 2 we describe the relevant high-level features of the\n   access\
    \ and onboard networks envisioned for use in aeronautics and\n   space exploration,\
    \ as they influence the properties of usable NEMO RO\n   solutions.  Section 3\
    \ then lists the technical and functional\n   characteristics that are absolutely\
    \ required of a NEMO RO solution\n   for these environments, while Section 4 lists\
    \ some additional\n   characteristics that are desired but not necessarily required.\
    \  In\n   Appendix A and Appendix B we provide brief primers on the specific\n\
    \   operational concepts used in aeronautics and space exploration,\n   respectively,\
    \ for IP-based network architectures.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [3].\n   Although this document does not specify an actual protocol,\
    \ but\n   rather specifies just the requirements for a protocol, it still uses\n\
    \   the RFC 2119 language to make the requirements clear.\n"

    \ and\n   desirable features for NEMO RO solutions, this section describes some\n\

- title: 2.1.  Aeronautical Communications Scenarios
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Aeronautical Communications Scenarios\n   Since aircraft may be simultaneously\
    \ connected to multiple ground\n   access networks using diverse technologies\
    \ with different coverage\n   properties, it is difficult to say much in general\
    \ about the rate of\n   changes in active access links and care-of addresses (CoAs).\
    \  As one\n   data point, for using VDL mode 2 data links, the length of time\
    \ spent\n   on a single access channel varies depending on the stage of flight.\n\
    \   On the airport surface, VDL mode 2 access is stable while a plane is\n   unloaded,\
    \ loaded, refueled, etc., but other wired and wireless LAN\n   links (e.g. local\
    \ networks available while on a gate) may come and\n   go.  Immediately after\
    \ takeoff and before landing, planes are in the\n   terminal maneuvering area\
    \ for approximately 10 minutes and stably use\n   another VDL mode 2 channel.\
    \  During en route flight, handovers\n   between VDL mode 2 channels may occur\
    \ every 30 to 60 minutes,\n   depending on the exact flight plan and layout of\
    \ towers, cells, and\n   sectors used by a service provider.  These handovers\
    \ may result in\n   having a different access router and a change in CoA, though\
    \ the use\n   of local mobility management (e.g., [9]) may limit the changes in\
    \ CoA\n   to only handovers between different providers or types of data links.\n\
    \   The characteristics of a data flow between a CN and MNN varies both\n   depending\
    \ on the data flow's domain and on the particular application\n   within the domain.\
    \  Even within the three aeronautical domains\n   described below, there are varying\
    \ classes of service that are\n   regulated differently (e.g., for emergencies\
    \ versus nominal\n   operations), but this level of detail has been abstracted\
    \ out for the\n   purposes of this document.  It is assumed that any viable NEMO\
    \ RO\n   solution will be able to support a granularity of configuration with\n\
    \   many sub-classes of traffic within each of the specific domains\n   listed\
    \ here.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Air Traffic Services Domain
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Air Traffic Services Domain\n   The MNNs involved in Air Traffic Services\
    \ (ATS) consist of pieces of\n   avionics hardware on board an aircraft that are\
    \ used to provide\n   navigation, control, and situational awareness.  The applications\
    \ run\n   by these MNNs are mostly critical to the safety of the lives of the\n\
    \   passengers and crew.  The MNN equipment may consist of a range of\n   devices\
    \ from typical laptop computers to very specialized avionics\n   devices.  These\
    \ MNNs will mostly be Local Fixed Nodes (LFNs), with a\n   few Local Mobile Nodes\
    \ (LMNs) to support Electronic Flight Bags, for\n   instance.  It can be assumed\
    \ that Visiting Mobile Nodes (VMNs) are\n   never used within the ATS domain.\n\
    \   An MR used for ATS will be capable of using multiple data links (at\n   least\
    \ VHF-based, satellite, HF-based, and wired), and will likely be\n   supported\
    \ by a backup unit in the case of failure, leading to a case\n   of a multihomed\
    \ MR that is at least multi-interfaced and possibly\n   multi-prefixed as well,\
    \ in NEMO terminology.\n   The existing ATS link technologies may be too anemic\
    \ for a complete\n   IP-based ATS communications architecture (link technologies\
    \ and\n   acronyms are briefly defined in Appendix A).  At the time of this\n\
    \   writing, the ICAO is pursuing future data link standards that support\n  \
    \ higher data rates.  Part of the problem is limited spectrum, pursued\n   under\
    \ ICAO ACP-WG-F, \"Spectrum Management\", and part of the problem\n   is the data\
    \ link protocols themselves, pursued under ICAO ACP-WG-T,\n   \"Future Communications\
    \ Technology\".  ACP-WG-T has received inputs\n   from studies on a number of\
    \ potential data link protocols, including\n   B-AMC, AMACS, P34, LDL, WCDMA,\
    \ and others.  Different link\n   technologies may be used in different stages\
    \ of flight, for instance\n   802.16 in the surface and terminal area, P34 or\
    \ LDL en route, and\n   satcom in oceanic flight.  Both current and planned data\
    \ links used\n   for Passenger Information and Entertainment Services (PIES) and/or\n\
    \   Airline Operational Services (AOS), such as the satcom links employed\n  \
    \ by passenger Internet-access systems, support much higher data rates\n   than\
    \ current ATS links.\n   Since, for ATS, the MRs and MNNs are under regulatory\
    \ control and are\n   actively tested and maintained, it is not completely unreasonable\
    \ to\n   assume that special patches or software be run on these devices to\n\
    \   enable NEMO RO.  In fact, since these devices are accessed by skilled\n  \
    \ technicians and professionals, it may be that some special\n   configuration\
    \ is required for NEMO RO.  Of course, simplicity in set\n   up and configuration\
    \ is highly preferable, however, and the desirable\n   feature labeled \"Des1\"\
    \ later in this document prefers solutions with\n   lower configuration state\
    \ and overhead.  To minimize costs of\n   ownership and operations, it is also\
    \ highly desirable for only widely\n   available, off-the-shelf operating systems\
    \ or network stacks to be\n   required, but this is not a full requirement.\n\
    \   Data flows from the ATS domain may be assumed to consist mainly of\n   short\
    \ transactional exchanges, such as clearance requests and grants.\n   Future ATS\
    \ communications are likely to include longer messages and\n   higher message\
    \ frequencies for positional awareness and trajectory\n   intent of all vehicles\
    \ in motion at the airport and all aircraft\n   within a thirty-mile range during\
    \ flight.  Many of these may be\n   aircraft-to-aircraft, but the majority of\
    \ current exchanges are\n   between the MNNs and a very small set of CNs within\
    \ a control\n   facility and take place at any time due to the full transfer of\n\
    \   control as a plane moves across sectors of airspace.  The set of CNs\n   may\
    \ be assumed to be topologically close to one another.  These CNs\n   are also\
    \ involved in other data flows over the same access network\n   that the MR is\
    \ attached to, managing other flights within the sector.\n   These CNs are often\
    \ geographically and topologically much closer to\n   the MR in comparison to\
    \ a single fixed HA.\n   The MNNs and CNs used for ATS will support IP services,\
    \ as IP is the\n   basis of the new Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN)\n\
    \   architecture being defined by ICAO.  Some current ATS ground systems\n   run\
    \ typical operating systems, like Solaris, Linux, and Windows, on\n   typical\
    \ workstation computer hardware.  There is some possibility for\n   an RO solution\
    \ to require minor changes to these CNs, though it is\n   much more desirable\
    \ if completely off-the-shelf CN machines and\n   operating systems can be used.\
    \  Later in this document, the security\n   requirements suggest that RO might\
    \ be performed with mobility anchors\n   that are topologically close to the CNs,\
    \ rather than directly to CNs\n   themselves.  This could possibly mean that CN\
    \ modifications are not\n   required.\n   During the course of a flight, there\
    \ are several events for which an\n   RO solution should consider the performance\
    \ implications:\n   o  Initial session creation with an ATS CN (called \"Data\
    \ Link Logon\"\n      in the aeronautical jargon).\n   o  Transfer of control\
    \ between ATS CNs, resulting in regional\n      differences in where the controlling\
    \ CN is located.\n   o  Aircraft-initiated contact with a non-controlling ATS\
    \ CN, which\n      may be located anywhere, without relation to the controlling\
    \ CN.\n   o  Non-controlling, ATS, CN-initiated contact with the aircraft.\n \
    \  o  Aircraft transition between one access link to another, resulting\n    \
    \  in change of CoA.\n   o  Concurrent use of multiple access links with different\
    \ care-of\n      addresses.\n"

  - "2.1.2.  Airline Operational Services Domain\n   Data flows for Airline Operational\
    \ Services (AOS) are not critical to\n   the safety of the passengers or aircraft,\
    \ but are needed for the\n   business operations of airlines operating flights,\
    \ and may affect the\n   profitability of an airline's flights.  Most of these\
    \ data flows are\n   sourced by MNNs that are part of the flight management system\
    \ or\n   sensor nodes on an aircraft, and are terminated at CNs located near\n\
    \   an airline's headquarters or operations center.  AOS traffic may\n   include\
    \ detailed electronic passenger manifests, passenger ticketing\n   and rebooking\
    \ traffic, and complete electronic baggage manifests.\n   When suitable bandwidth\
    \ is available (currently on the surface when\n   connected to a wired link at\
    \ a gate), \"airplane health information\"\n   data transfers of between 10 and\
    \ several hundred megabytes of data\n   are likely, and in the future, it is expected\
    \ that the In-Flight\n   Entertainment (IFE) systems may receive movie refreshes\
    \ of data\n   (e.g., television programming or recent news updates) running into\n\
    \   the multi-gigabyte range.\n   Currently, these flows are often short messages\
    \ that record the\n   timing of events of a flight, engine performance data, etc.,\
    \ but may\n   be longer flows that upload weather or other supplementary data\
    \ to an\n   aircraft.  In addition, email-like interactive messaging may be used\n\
    \   at any time during a flight.  For instance, messages can be exchanged\n  \
    \ before landing to arrange for arrival-gate services to be available\n   for\
    \ handicapped passengers, refueling, food and beverage stocking,\n   and other\
    \ needs.  This messaging is not limited to landing\n   preparation, though, and\
    \ may occur at any stage of flight.\n   The equipment comprising these MNNs and\
    \ CNs has similar\n   considerations to the equipment used for the ATS domain.\
    \  A key\n   difference between ATS and AOS is that AOS data flows are routed\
    \ to\n   CNs that may be much more geographically remote to the aircraft than\n\
    \   CNs used by ATS flows, as AOS CNs will probably be located at an\n   airline's\
    \ corporate data center or headquarters.  The AOS CNs will\n   also probably be\
    \ static for the lifetime of the flight, rather than\n   dynamic like the ATS\
    \ CNs.  An HA used for AOS may be fairly close\n   topologically to the CNs, and\
    \ RO may not be as big of a benefit for\n   AOS since simple event logging is\
    \ more typical than time-critical\n   interactive messaging.  For the small number\
    \ of messaging flows,\n   however, the CNs are geographically (but not necessarily\n\
    \   topologically) very close to the aircraft, though this depends on how\n  \
    \ applications are written -- whether they use centralized servers or\n   exchange\
    \ messages directly.  Additionally, since AOS communication is\n   more advisory\
    \ in nature than ATS, rather than safety-critical, AOS\n   flows are less sensitive\
    \ to tunnel inefficiencies than ATS flows.\n   For these reasons, in this document,\
    \ we consider AOS data flow\n   concerns with RO mechanisms to not be full requirements,\
    \ but instead\n   consider them desirable properties, which are discussed in Section\
    \ 4.\n   Future AOS MNNs and CNs can be expected to implement IPv6 and conform\n\
    \   to the new IPv6-based ATN Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS)\n  \
    \ that ICAO is defining.  AOS CNs have similar hardware and software\n   properties\
    \ as described for ATS above.\n"

    \ applications.\n   The largest class of PIES CNs consists of typical web servers\
    \ and\n   other nodes on the public Internet.  It is not reasonable to assume\n\
    \   that these can be modified specifically to support a NEMO RO scheme.\n   Presently,\
    \ these CNs would be mostly IPv4-based, though an increasing\n   number of IPv6\
    \ PIES CNs are expected in the future.  This document\n   does not consider the\
    \ problem of IPv4-IPv6 transition, beyond the\n   assumption that either MNNs\
    \ and CNs are running IPv6 or a transition\n   mechanism exists somewhere within\
    \ the network.\n   A small number of PIES MNNs may be LFNs that store and distribute\n\
    \   cached media content (e.g., movies and music) or that may provide\n   gaming\
    \ services to passengers.  Due to the great size of the data\n   stored on these\
    \ LFNs compared to the anemic bandwidth available air-\n   to-ground, these LFNs\
    \ will probably not attempt to communicate off-\n   board at all during the course\
    \ of a flight, but will wait to update\n   their content via either high-speed\
    \ links available on the ground or\n   removable media inserted by the flight\
    \ crew.  However, if a higher\n   bandwidth link were affordably available, it\
    \ might be used in-flight\n   for these purposes, but supporting this is not a\
    \ requirement.  Data\n   flows needed for billing passengers for access to content\
    \ are\n   relatively low bandwidth and are currently done in-flight.  The\n  \
    \ requirements of these data flows are less stringent than those of\n   ATS, however,\
    \ so they are not specifically considered here.\n   The PIES domain is not critical\
    \ to safety-of-life, but is merely an\n   added comfort or business service to\
    \ passengers.  Since PIES\n   applications may consume much more bandwidth than\
    \ the available links\n   used in other domains, the PIES MNNs may have their\
    \ packets routed\n   through a separate high-bandwidth link that is not used by\
    \ the ATS\n   data flows.  For instance, several service providers are planning\
    \ to\n   offer passenger Internet access during flight at DSL-like rates, just\n\
    \   as the former Connexion by Boeing system did.  Several airlines also\n   plan\
    \ to offer onboard cellular service to their passengers, possibly\n   utilizing\
    \ Voice-over-IP for transport.  Due to the lack of\n   criticality and the likelihood\
    \ of being treated independently, in\n   this document, PIES MNN concerns are\
    \ not considered as input to\n   requirements in Section 3.  The RO solution should\
    \ be optimized for\n   ATS and AOS needs and consider PIES as a secondary concern.\n\
    \   With this in consideration, the PIES domain is also the most likely\n   to\
    \ utilize NEMO for communications in the near-term, since relatively\n   little\
    \ regulations and bureaucracy are involved in deploying new\n   technology in\
    \ this domain and since IP-based PIES systems have\n   previously been developed\
    \ and deployed (although not using NEMO)\n   [10].  For these reasons, PIES concerns\
    \ factor heavily into the\n   desirable properties in Section 4, outside of the\

  - "2.2.  Space Exploration Scenarios\n   This section describes some features of\
    \ the network environments\n   found in space exploration that are relevant to\
    \ selecting an\n   appropriate NEMO RO mechanism.  It should be noted that IPv4-based\n\
    \   mobile routing has been demonstrated on board the UK-DMC satellite\n   and\
    \ that the documentation on this serves as a useful reference for\n   understanding\
    \ some of the goals and configuration issues for certain\n   types of space use\
    \ of NEMO [11].  This section assumes space use of\n   NEMO within the \"near-Earth\"\
    \ range of space (i.e., not for\n   communications between the Earth and Mars\
    \ or other \"deep space\"\n   locations).  Note that NEMO is currently being considered\
    \ for use out\n   to lunar distances.  No strong distinction is made here between\n\
    \   civilian versus military use, or exploration mission versus Earth-\n   observing\
    \ or other mission types; our focus is on civilian\n   exploration missions, but\
    \ we believe that many of the same basic\n   concerns are relevant to these other\
    \ mission types.\n   In space communications, a high degree of bandwidth asymmetry\
    \ is\n   often present, with the uplink from the ground to a craft typically\n\
    \   being multiple orders of magnitude slower than the downlink from the\n   craft\
    \ to the ground.  This means that the RO overhead may be\n   negligible on the\
    \ downlink but significant for the uplink.  An RO\n   scheme that minimizes the\
    \ amount of signaling from CNs to an MN is\n   desirable, since these uplinks\
    \ may be low-bandwidth to begin with\n   (possibly only several kilobits per second).\
    \  Since the uplink is\n   used for sending commands, it should not be blocked\
    \ for long periods\n   while serializing long RO signaling packets; any RO signaling\
    \ from\n   the CN to MNNs must not involve large packets.\n   For unmanned space\
    \ flight, the MNNs on board a spacecraft consist\n   almost entirely of LFN-sensing\
    \ devices and processing devices that\n   send telemetry and science data to CNs\
    \ on the ground and actuator\n   devices that are commanded from the ground in\
    \ order to control the\n   craft.  Robotic lunar rovers may serve as VMNs behind\
    \ an MR located\n   on a lander or orbiter, but these rovers will contain many\n\
    \   independent instruments and could probably be configured as an MR and\n  \
    \ LFNs instead of using a single VMN address.\n   It can be assumed that for manned\
    \ spaceflight, at least multiple MRs\n   will be present and online simultaneously\
    \ for fast failover.  These\n   will usually be multihomed over space links in\
    \ diverse frequency\n   bands, and so multiple access network prefixes can be\
    \ expected to be\n   in use simultaneously, especially since some links will be\
    \ direct to\n   ground stations while others may be bent-pipe repeated through\n\
    \   satellite relays like the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System\n   (TDRSS).\
    \  This conforms to the (n,1,1) or (n,n,1) NEMO multihoming\n   scenarios [12].\
    \  For unmanned missions, if low weight and power are\n   more critical, it is\
    \ likely that only a single MR and single link/\n   prefix may be present, conforming\
    \ to the (1,1,1) or (1,n,1) NEMO\n   multihoming scenarios [12].\n   In some modes\
    \ of spacecraft operation, all communications may go\n   through a single onboard\
    \ computer (or a Command and Data Handling\n   system as on the International\
    \ Space Station) rather than directly to\n   the MNNs themselves, so there is\
    \ only ever one MNN behind an MR that\n   is in direct contact with off-board\
    \ CNs.  In this case, removing the\n   MR and using simple host-based Mobile IPv6\
    \ rather than NEMO is\n   possible.  However, an MR is more desirable because\
    \ it could be part\n   of a modular communications adapter that is used in multiple\
    \ diverse\n   missions to bridge onboard buses and intelligently manage space\n\
    \   links.  This is cheaper and leads to faster development time than\n   re-creating\
    \ these capabilities per-mission if using simple Mobile\n   IPv6 with a single\
    \ Command and Data Handling node that varies widely\n   between spacecraft.  Also,\
    \ all visions for the future involve\n   network-centric operations where the\
    \ direct addressability and\n   accessibility of end devices and data is crucial.\
    \  As network-centric\n   operations become more prevalent, application of NEMO\
    \ is likely to be\n   needed to increase the flexibility of data flow.\n   The\
    \ MRs and MNNs on board a spacecraft are highly customized\n   computing platforms,\
    \ and adding custom code or complex configurations\n   in order to obtain NEMO\
    \ RO capabilities is feasible, although it\n   should not be assumed that any\
    \ amount of code or configuration\n   maintenance is possible after launch.  The\
    \ RO scheme as it is\n   initially configured should continue to function throughout\
    \ the\n   lifetime of an asset.\n   For manned space flight, additional MNNs on\
    \ spacesuits and astronauts\n   may be present and used for applications like\
    \ two-way voice\n   conversation or video-downlink.  These MNNs could be reusable\
    \ and\n   reconfigured per-flight for different craft or mission network\n   designs,\
    \ but it is still desirable for them to be able to\n   autoconfigure themselves,\
    \ and they may move between nested or non-\n   nested MRs during a mission.  For\
    \ instance, if astronauts move\n   between two docked spacecrafts, each craft\
    \ may have its own local MR\n   and wireless coverage that the suit MNNs will\
    \ have to reconfigure\n   for.  It is desirable if an RO solution can respond\
    \ appropriately to\n   this change in locality and not cause high levels of packet\
    \ loss\n   during the transitional period.  It is also likely that these MNNs\n\
    \   will be part of Personal Area Networks (PANs), and so may appear\n   either\
    \ directly as MNNs behind the main MR on board or have their own\n   MR within\
    \ the PAN and thus create a nested (or even multi-level\n   nested) NEMO configuration.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Required Characteristics\n   This section lists requirements that specify\
    \ the absolute minimal\n   technical and/or functional properties that a NEMO\
    \ RO mechanism must\n   possess to be usable for aeronautical and space communications.\n\
    \   In the recent work done by the International Civil Aviation\n   Organization\
    \ (ICAO) to identify viable mobility technologies for\n   providing IP services\
    \ to aircraft, a set of technical criteria was\n   developed ([13], [14]).  The\
    \ nine required characteristics listed in\n   this document can be seen as directly\
    \ descended from these ICAO\n   criteria, except here we have made them much more\
    \ specific and\n   focused for the NEMO technology and the problem of RO within\
    \ NEMO.\n   The original ICAO criteria were more general and used for comparing\n\
    \   the features of different mobility solutions (e.g., mobility\n   techniques\
    \ based on routing protocols versus transport protocols\n   versus Mobile IP,\
    \ etc.).  Within the text describing each requirement\n   in this section, we\
    \ provide the high-level ICAO criteria from which\n   it evolved.\n   These requirements\
    \ for aeronautics are generally similar to or in\n   excess of the requirements\
    \ for space exploration, so we do not add\n   any additional requirements specifically\
    \ for space exploration.  In\n   addition, the lack of a standards body regulating\
    \ performance and\n   safety requirements for space exploration means that the\
    \ requirements\n   for aviation are much easier to agree upon and base within\
    \ existing\n   requirements frameworks.  After consideration, we believe that\
    \ the\n   set of aviation-based requirements outlined here also fully suffices\n\
    \   for space exploration.\n   It is understood that different solutions may be\
    \ needed for\n   supporting different domains.  This may mean either different\
    \ NEMO RO\n   solutions or different mobility solutions entirely.  Divergent\n\
    \   solutions amongst the domains are acceptable, though preferably\n   avoided\
    \ if possible.\n   An underlying requirement that would be assumed by the use\
    \ of Mobile\n   IP technology for managing mobility (rather than a higher-layer\n\
    \   approach) is that IP addresses used both within the mobile network\n   and\
    \ by CNs to start new sessions with nodes within the mobile network\n   remain\
    \ constant throughout the course of flights and operations.  For\n   ATS and AOS,\
    \ this allows the Home Addresses (HoAs) to serve as node\n   identifiers, rather\
    \ than just locators, and for PIES it allows common\n   persistent applications\
    \ (e.g., Voice over IP (VoIP) clients, VPN\n   clients, etc.) to remain connected\
    \ throughout a flight.  Prior\n   aeronautical network systems like the prior\
    \ OSI-based ATN and\n   Connexion by Boeing set a precedent for keeping a fixed\
    \ Mobile\n   Network Prefix (MNP), though they relied on interdomain routing\n\
    \   protocols (IDRP and BGP) to accomplish this, rather than NEMO\n   technology.\
    \  This requirement applies to the selection in general of\n   a mobility management\
    \ technology, and not specifically to an RO\n   solution once NEMO has been decided\
    \ on for mobility management.\n"

    \ of magnitude smaller than\n   this over at least the next decade, so the aeronautical\
    \ needs are\n   more stringent in terms of scalability to large numbers of MRs.\
    \  It\n   would be a non-starter if the combined use of an RO technique by all\n\
    \   of the MRs in the network caused ground networks provisioned within\n   the\
    \ realm of typical long-haul private telecommunications networks\n   (like the\
    \ FAA's Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) or the NASA\n   Integrated Services\
    \ Network (NISN)) to be overloaded or melt-down\n   under the RO signaling load\
    \ or amount of rapid path changes for\n   multiple data flows.\n   Thus, an RO\
    \ scheme MUST be simultaneously usable by the MNNs on\n   hundreds of thousands\

    \ scheme must also be tolerant to the delay\n   and/or loss of initial packets,\
    \ which may become more pervasive in\n   future Internet routing and addressing\
    \ architectures [17].\n   Since at least one traffic domain (PIES) requires connectivity\
    \ to the\n   Internet and it is possible that the Internet would provide transport\n\
    \   for other domains at some distant point in the future, this\n   requirement\
    \ explicitly forbids the use of techniques that are known\n   to scale poorly\
    \ in terms of their global effects, like BGP, for the\n   purposes of RO.  The\
    \ previous OSI-based ATN system used IDRP and an\n   \"island\" concept for maintaining\
    \ connectivity to the mobile network\n   but was not tested on a large scale deployment.\
    \  The Connexion by\n   Boeing system used BGP announces and withdrawals as a\
    \ plane moved\n   across the globe in order to maintain connectivity [10].  This\
    \ was\n   found to contribute to a significant amount of churn in the global\n\
    \   Internet routing tables, which is undesirable for a number of\n   reasons,\
    \ and must be avoided in the future.\n   This requirement was derived from ICAO's\
    \ TC-6 - \"The approach should\n   be scalable to accommodate anticipated levels\
    \ of aircraft equipage.\"\n   The specific scaling factor for the number of aircraft\
    \ used in our\n   version of the requirement is an order of magnitude larger than\
    \ the\n   estimated equipage cited in an ICAO draft letter-of-intent to ARIN\n\
    \   for an IPv6 prefix allocation request.  There were several other\n   estimates\
    \ that different groups had made, and it was felt in the IETF\n   that using a\
    \ larger estimate was more conservative.  It should be\n   noted that even with\
    \ this difference of an order of magnitude, the\n   raw number is still several\

  - "3.7.1.  Rationale for Aeronautics - Efficient Signaling\n   The amount of bandwidth\
    \ available for aeronautical and space\n   communications has historically been\
    \ quite small in comparison to the\n   desired bandwidth (e.g., in the case of\
    \ VDL links, the bandwidth is 8\n   kbps of shared resources).  This situation\
    \ is expected to persist for\n   at least several more years.  Links tend to be\
    \ provisioned based on\n   estimates of application needs (which could well prove\
    \ wrong if\n   either demand or the applications in use themselves do not follow\n\
    \   expectations) and do not leave much room for additional networking\n   protocol\

    \ IPv6 RO apply.\n"
- title: 3.8.1.  Rationale for Aeronautics - Security
  contents:
  - "3.8.1.  Rationale for Aeronautics - Security\n   The security needs are fairly\
    \ similar between ATS and AOS, but vary\n   widely between the ATS/AOS domains\
    \ and PIES.  For PIES, the traffic\n   flows are typical of terrestrial Internet\
    \ use and the security\n   requirements for RO are identical to those of conventional\
    \ Mobile\n   IPv6 RO.  For ATS/AOS, however, there are somewhat more strict\n\
    \   requirements, along with some safe assumptions that designers of RO\n   schemes\
    \ can make.  Below, we describe each of these ATS/AOS issues,\n   but do not further\
    \ discuss PIES RO security.\n   The first security requirement is driven by concerns\
    \ expressed by ATS\n   communications engineers.  The concern is driven by current\
    \ air-\n   ground links to a craft and their lack of security, which has allowed\n\
    \   eavesdroppers to track individual flights in detail.  Protecting the\n   MNP\
    \ from exposure has been expressed as a requirement by this\n   community, though\
    \ the security of the RO system should not depend on\n   secrecy of the MNP. \
    \ The RO scheme should use some reasonable\n   security mechanisms in order to\
    \ both protect RO signaling via strong\n   authentication and encrypt the MNP\
    \ from being visible over air-ground\n   links.\n   The second security requirement\
    \ is driven by the risk of flooding\n   attacks that are started by an attacker\
    \ redirecting an MNP's traffic\n   to some target victim CoA.  To protect bindings\
    \ to bogus CoAs from\n   being sent, the RO scheme must somehow validate that\
    \ an MR actually\n   possesses any CoAs that it claims.  For the purposes of aeronautics,\n\
    \   it is safe to assume ingress filtering is in place in the access\n   networks.\n\
    \   To protect against \"rogue\" MRs or abuse of compromised MRs, the RO\n   scheme\
    \ MUST be capable of checking that an MR is actually authorized\n   to perform\
    \ a binding update for a specific MNP.  To meet this\n   requirement, it can be\
    \ assumed that some aeronautical organization\n   authority exists who can provide\
    \ the required authorization, possibly\n   in the form of a certificate that the\
    \ MR possesses, signed by the\n   aeronautical authority.\n   It is also reasonable\
    \ to assume trust relationships between each MR\n   and a number of mobility anchor\
    \ points topologically near to its CNs\n   (these anchor points may be owned by\
    \ the service providers), but it\n   is not reasonable to assume that trust relationships\
    \ can be\n   established between an MR and any given CN itself.  Within the\n\
    \   onboard networks for ATS and AOS, it is reasonable to assume that the\n  \
    \ LFNs and MRs have some trust relationship.\n   It is felt by many individuals\
    \ that by the time the IP-based ATN\n   grows into production use, there will\
    \ be a global ATN-specific Public\n   Key Infrastructure (PKI) usable for ATS,\
    \ though it is agreed that\n   such a PKI does not currently exist and will take\
    \ time to develop\n   both technically and politically.  This PKI could permit\
    \ the\n   establishment of trust relationships among any pair of ATS MNNs, MRs,\n\
    \   or CNs through certificate paths, in contrast to the more limited\n   amount\
    \ of trust relationships described in the previous paragraph.\n   While it has\
    \ been suggested that early test and demonstration\n   deployments with a more\
    \ limited-scale PKI deployment can be used in\n   the near-term, as a global PKI\
    \ is developed, some parties still feel\n   that assuming a global PKI may be\
    \ overly bold in comparison to\n   assuming trust relationships with anchor points.\
    \  It is always\n   possible to scale the anchor point assumption up if a PKI\
    \ develops\n   that allows the CNs themselves to become the anchor points.  It\
    \ is\n   not possible to go back down in the other direction if a global PKI\n\
    \   never emerges.\n   This requirement was extrapolated from ICAO's TC-8 - \"\

    \   than for more general NEMO use, due to the safety-of-life and/or\n   national\
    \ security issues involved.  The required security properties\n   are described\
    \ under Req8 of Section 3 within this document.\n   Under an assumption of closed\
    \ and secure backbone networks, the air-\n   ground link is the weakest portion\
    \ of the network and most\n   susceptible to injection of packets, flooding, and\
    \ other attacks.\n   Future air-ground data links that will use IP are being developed\n\

    \ ATN applications, and has recently been working\n   towards a new IPv6-based\
    \ version of the ATN.\n   Supporting mobility in an IP-based network may be vastly\
    \ different\n   than it is in the OSI-based ATN, which uses the Inter-Domain Routing\n\
    \   Protocol (IDRP) to recompute routing tables as mobile networks change\n  \
    \ topological points of attachment.  ICAO recognizes this and has\n   studied\
    \ various mobility techniques based on link, network,\n   transport, routing,\
    \ and application protocols [14].\n   Work done within ICAO has identified the\
    \ NEMO technology as a\n   promising candidate for use in supporting global, IP-based\
    \ mobile\n   networking.  The main concerns with NEMO have been with its current\n\
    \   lack of route optimization support and its potentially complex\n   configuration\
    \ requirements in a large airport environment with\n   multiple service providers\
    \ and 25 or more airlines sharing the same\n   infrastructure.\n   A significant\
    \ challenge to the deployment of networking technologies\n   to aeronautical users\
    \ is the low capability of existing air-ground\n   data links for carrying IP-based\
    \ (or other) network traffic.  Due to\n   barriers of spectrum and certification,\
    \ production of new standards\n   and equipment for the lower layers below IP\
    \ is slow.  Currently\n   operating technologies may have data rates measured\
    \ in the several\n   kbps range, and it is clear that supporting advanced IP-based\n\
    \   applications will require new link technologies to be developed\n   simultaneously\
    \ with the development of networking technologies\n   appropriate for aeronautics.\n\
    \   In addition to well-known commercial data links that can be adapted\n   for\
    \ aeronautical use, such as Wideband Code-Division Multiple Access\n   (WCDMA)\
    \ standards or the IEEE 802.16 standard, several more\n   specialized technologies\
    \ either exist or have been proposed for air-\n   ground use:\n   o  VHF Data\
    \ Link (VDL) specifies four modes of operation in the\n      117.975 - 137 MHz\
    \ range that are capable of supporting different\n      mixes of digital voice\
    \ and data at fairly low rates.  The low\n      rates are driven by the need to\
    \ operate within 25 kHz channels\n      internationally allocated for aeronautical\
    \ use.  VDL mode 2 is\n      somewhat widely deployed on aircraft and two global\
    \ service\n      providers support VDL access networks.  Experiences with VDL\
    \ mode\n      2 indicate that several kbps of capacity delivered to a craft can\n\
    \      be expected in practice, and the use of long timers and a\n      collision\
    \ avoidance algorithm over a large physical space\n      (designed to operate\
    \ at 200 nautical miles) limit the performance\n      of IP-based transport protocols\
    \ and applications.\n   o  Aircraft Communications and Reporting System (ACARS)\
    \ is a\n      messaging system that can be used over several types of underlying\n\
    \      RF data links (e.g., VHF, HF, and satellite relay).  ACARS\n      messaging\
    \ automates the sending and processing of several types of\n      event notifications\
    \ over the course of a flight.  ACARS in general\n      is a higher-level messaging\
    \ system, whereas the more specific\n      \"Plain Old ACARS\" (POA) refers to\
    \ a particular legacy RF interface\n      that the ACARS system employed prior\
    \ to the adoption of VDL and\n      other data links.  Support for IP-based networking\
    \ and advanced\n      applications over POA is not feasible.\n   o  Broadband\
    \ Aeronautical Multi-carrier Communications (B-AMC) is a\n      hybrid cellular\
    \ system that uses multi-carrier CDMA from ground-\n      to-air and Orthogonal\
    \ Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in\n      the air-to-ground direction.\
    \  B-AMC runs in the L-band of spectrum\n      and is adapted from the Broadband-VHF\
    \ (B-VHF) technology\n      originally developed to operate in the VHF spectrum.\
    \  L-band use\n      is intended to occupy the space formerly allocated for Distance\n\
    \      Measuring Equipment (DME) using channels with greater bandwidth\n     \
    \ than are available than in the VHF band, where analog voice use\n      will\
    \ continue to be supported.  B-AMC may permit substantially\n      higher data\
    \ rates than existing deployed air-ground links.\n   o  All-Purpose Multi-Channel\
    \ Aviation Communications System (AMACS)\n      is an adaptation of the Global\
    \ System for Mobile Communications\n      (GSM) physical layer to operate in the\
    \ L-band with 50 - 400 kHz\n      channels and use VDL mode 4's media access technique.\
    \  AMACS may\n      permit data rates in the several hundred kbps range, depending\
    \ on\n      specific channelization policies deployed.\n   o  Project 34 (P34)\
    \ is a wideband public-safety radio system capable\n      of being used in the\
    \ L-band.  P34 is designed to offer several\n      hundred kbps of capacity specifically\
    \ for IP-based packet\n      networking.  It uses OFDM in 50, 100, or 150 kHz\
    \ channels and\n      exact performance will depend on the particular operating\
    \ band,\n      range (guard time), and channelization plan configured in\n   \
    \   deployment.\n   o  L-Band Data Link (LDL) is another proposal using the L-band\
    \ based\n      on existing technologies.  LDL adapts the VDL mode 3 access\n \
    \     technique and is expected to be capable of up to 100 kbps.\n"
