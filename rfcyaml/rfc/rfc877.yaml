  - "          A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams\n                 \
    \              Over\n                       Public Data Networks\nThis RFC specifies\
    \ a standard adopted by CSNET, the VAN gateway, and\nother organizations for the\
    \ transmission of IP datagrams over the\nX.25-based public data networks. \nAn\
    \ X.25 virtual circuit is opened on demand when a datagram arrives at\nthe network\
    \ interface for transmission. A virtual circuit is closed\nafter some period of\
    \ inactivity (the length of the period depends on\nthe cost associated with an\
    \ open virtual circuit). A virtual circuit\nmay also be closed if the interface\
    \ runs out of virtual circuits. An\nalgorithm for managing virtual circuits during\
    \ peak demand is given\nin [1].\nSTANDARDS\n1.1 The first octet in the Call User\
    \ Data Field (the first data octet\n    in the Call Request packet) is used for\
    \ protocol demultiplexing.\n    The value hex CC (binary 11001100, decimal 204)\
    \ is used to mean\n    INTERNET PROTOCOL. \n1.2 IP datagrams are sent as X.25\
    \ \"complete packet sequences\". That is,\n    datagrams begin on packet boundaries\
    \ and the M bit (\"more data\") is\n    used for datagrams that are larger than\
    \ one packet. There are no\n    additional headers or other data in the packets.\n\
    1.3 Unless a larger packet size is negotiated, the maximum size of an\n    IP\
    \ datagram transmitted over X.25 is 576 octets. If two sites\n    negotiate a\
    \ large X.25 packet size (for example, 1024 octets), an\n    IP datagram of that\
    \ size is allowed. \n1.4 Either site may close a virtual circuit. If the virtual\
    \ circuit is\n    closed or reset while a datagram is being transmitted, the datagram\n\
    \    is lost.\nGENERAL REMARKS\n2.1 Protocols above IP, such as TCP, do not affect\
    \ this standard. In\n    particular, no attempt is made to open X.25 virtual circuits\n\
    \    corresponding to TCP connections.\n2.2 Features of X.25 not discussed in\
    \ this document are not used.\n    For example, interrupt packets and the D bit\
    \ (indicating\n    end-to-end significance) are not used.\n2.3 Negotiable features\
    \ (facilities) of X.25 are allowed. For\n    example, sites are free to negotiate\
    \ larger packet and window\n    sizes.\n2.4 Some sites, such as CSNET sites, may\
    \ attempt to open multiple\n    virtual circuits to a single site. Sites should\
    \ attempt to\n    handle such incoming calls gracefully: transmit on the\n   \
    \ additional circuits if possible and accept incoming datagrams\n    from them,\
    \ but do not accept the CALL REQUEST, only to\n    immediately close the connection\
    \ or ignore datagrams\n    transmitted on such circuits.\nREFERENCE\n[1] Comer,\
