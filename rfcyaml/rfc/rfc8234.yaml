  - "1.  Introduction\n   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection in Automatic\n
    \  Protection Switching (APS) mode is defined in RFC 7271 [RFC7271].  It\n   defines
    a set of alternate and additional mechanisms to perform some\n   of the functions
    of linear protection described in RFC 6378\n   [RFC6378].  The actions performed
    at initialization of the Protection\n   State Coordination (PSC) Control Logic
    are not described in either\n   [RFC7271] or [RFC6378].  Although it is a common
    perception that the\n   state machine starts at the Normal state, this is not
    explicitly\n   specified in any of the documents and various questions have been\n
    \  raised by implementers and in discussions on the MPLS working group\n   mailing
    list concerning the detailed actions that the PSC Control\n   Logic should take.\n
    \  The state machine described in [RFC7271] operates under the\n   assumption
    that both end nodes of a linear protection domain start in\n   the Normal state.
    \ In the case that one node reboots while the other\n   node is still in operation,
    various scenarios may arise resulting in\n   problematic situations.  This document
    resolves all the problematic\n   cases and minimizes traffic disruptions related
    to initialization,\n   including both cold and warm reboots that require re-initialization\n
    \  of the PSC Control Logic.\n   This document contains updates to the MPLS-TP
    linear protection in\n   APS mode defined in [RFC7271].  The updates provide rules
    related to\n   initialization of the PSC Control Logic (in which the state machine\n
    \  resides) when operating in APS mode.  The updates also include\n   modifications
    to the state transition table defined in Section 11.2\n   of [RFC7271].  The changes
    in the state transition table have been\n   examined to make sure that no new
    problems are introduced.\n   This document does not introduce backward compatibility
    issues with\n   implementations of [RFC7271].  In case a node implementing this\n
    \  document restarts, the new state changes will not cause problems at\n   the
    remote node implementing [RFC7271], and the two ends will\n   converge to the
    same local and remote states.  In case a node\n   implementing [RFC7271] restarts,
    the two ends behave as they do\n   today.\n   This document also provides some
    clarifications on the operation\n   related to state transition table lookup.\n
    \  The reader of this document is assumed to be familiar with [RFC7271].\n"

  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Initialization Behavior\n   This section defines initialization behavior
      that is not described in\n   [RFC7271].\n   When the PSC Control Logic is initialized,
      the following actions MUST\n   be performed:\n   o  Stop the WTR timer if it
      is running.\n   o  Clear any operator command in the Local Request Logic.\n
      \  o  If an SF-W or SF-P exists as the highest local request, the node\n      being
      initialized starts at the PF:W:L or UA:P:L state,\n      respectively.\n   o
      \ If the node being initialized has no local request:\n      *  If the node
      being initialized does not remember the active path\n         or if the node
      being initialized remembers the working path as\n         the active path, the
      node starts at the Normal state.\n      *  Else (the node being initialized
      remembers the protection path\n         as the active path), the node starts
      at the WTR state sending\n         NR(0,1) or at the DNR state sending DNR(0,1)
      depending on the\n         configuration that allows or prevents automatic reversion
      to\n         the Normal state.\n   o  In case any local SD exists, the local
      SD MUST be considered as an\n      input to the Local Request Logic only after
      the local node has\n      received the first protocol message from the remote
      node and\n      completed the processing (i.e., updated the PSC Control Logic
      and\n      decided which action, if any, is to be sent to the PSC Message\n
      \     Generator).\n   o  If the local node receives an EXER message as the first
      protocol\n      message after initialization and the remote EXER becomes the
      top-\n      priority global request, the local node MUST set the position of\n
      \     the bridge and selector according to the Path value in the EXER\n      message
      and transit to the E::R state.\n   In the case of no local request, remembering
      the active path\n   minimizes traffic switchovers when the remote node is still
      in\n   operation.  This approach does not cause a problem even if the\n   remembered
      active path is no longer valid due to any local input that\n   occurred at the
      remote node while the initializing node was out of\n   operation.\n   Note that
      in some restart scenarios (e.g., cold rebooting), no valid\n   SF/SD indications
      may be present at the input of the Local Request\n   Logic.  In this case, the
      PSC Control Logic restarts as if no local\n   requests are present.  If a valid
      SF/SD indication is detected later,\n   the PSC Control Logic is notified and
      state change is triggered.\n"

  - contents:
    - "4.2.  State Transition Modification\n   In addition to the initialization behavior
      described in Section 4.1,\n   four cells of the remote state transition table
      need to be changed to\n   make two end nodes converge after initialization.
      \ State transition\n   by remote message as defined in Section 11.2 of [RFC7271]
      is modified\n   as follows (only modified cells are shown):\n           | MS-W
      \   | MS-P    | WTR | EXER | RR | DNR  | NR\n   --------+---------+---------+-----+------+----+------+----\n
      \  N       |         |         | (13)|      |    | DNR  |\n   PF:W:R  |         |
      \        |     |      |    | DNR  |\n   PF:DW:R |         |         |     |
      \     |    | DNR  |\n   The changes in two rows of remote protecting failure
      states lead to\n   the replacement of note (10) with DNR; therefore, note (10)
      is no\n   longer needed.  The resultant three rows read:\n           | MS-W
      \   | MS-P    | WTR | EXER | RR | DNR  | NR\n   --------+---------+---------+-----+------+----+------+----\n

      | SA:MP:R | (9) | E::R | i  | DNR  | (11)\n   PF:DW:R | SA:MW:R | SA:MP:R |
      (9) | E::R | i  | DNR  | (11)\n   In the tables above, the letters 'i' and 'N'
      stand for \"ignore\" and\n   \"Normal state\", respectively.  Other abbreviations
      can be found in\n   Section 3.\n"

    - "4.3.  Operation Related to State Transition Table Lookup\n   In addition to
      the rules related to the state transition table lookup\n   listed in Section
      11 of [RFC7271], the following rule is also applied\n   to the operation related
      to the state transition table lookup:\n   o  When the local SF-P is cleared
      and the priorities of the local and\n      remote requests are re-evaluated,
      the last received remote message\n      may no longer be valid due to the previous
      failure of the\n      protection path.  Therefore, the last received message
      MUST be\n      treated as if it were NR and only the local request shall be\n
      \     evaluated.\n   The last paragraph in Section 11 of [RFC7271] is modified
      as follows:\n   ---------\n   Old text:\n   ---------\n   In the state transition
      tables below, the letter 'i' stands for\n   \"ignore\" and is an indication
      to remain in the current state and\n   continue transmitting the current PSC
      message.\n   ---------\n   New text:\n   ---------\n   In the state transition
      tables below, the letter 'i' is the\n   \"ignore\" flag; if it is set, it means
      that the top-priority\n   global request is ignored.\n   If re-evaluation is
      triggered, the ignore flag is checked.  If it\n   is set, the state machine
      will transit to the supposed state, which\n   can be Normal or DNR as indicated
      in the footnotes to the state\n   transition table in Section 11.1 of [RFC7271].
      \ If the ignore flag\n   is not set, the state machine will transit to the state
      indicated\n   in the cell of the state transition table.\n   If re-evaluation
      is not triggered, the ignore flag is checked.  If\n   it is set, the state machine
      will remain in the current state, and\n   the current PSC message continues
      to be transmitted.  If the ignore\n   flag is not set, the state machine will
      transit to the state\n   indicated in the cell of the state transition table.\n"
