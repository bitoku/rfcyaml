Abstract This document defines a mechanism for backhauling Digital Private Network
Signaling System 1 (DPNSS 1) and Digital Access Signaling System 2 (DASS 2) messages over IP by extending the ISDN User Adaptation (IUA)
Layer Protocol defined in RFC 3057.
DPNSS 1, specified in ND1301:2001/03 (formerly BTNR 188), is used to interconnect Private Branch Exchanges (PBX) in a private network.
DASS 2, specified in BTNR 190, is used to connect PBXs to the PSTN.
This document aims to become an Appendix to IUA and to be the base for a DPNSS 1/DASS 2 User Adaptation (DUA) implementation.
This document describes a method of implementing Digital Private Network Signaling System 1 (DPNSS 1)
[2] (henceforth referred to as just DPNSS) and Digital Access Signaling System 2 (DASS 2)[3]
backhaul messaging over IP using a modified version of the ISDN User Adaptation Protocol (IUAP)
The DPNSS/DASS 2 User Adaptation (DUA) builds on top of IUA by defining the necessary extensions to IUA for a DPNSS/DASS2 implementation.
There is a need for Switched Circuit Network (SCN) signaling protocol delivery from a DPNSS Signaling Gateway (SG) to a Media Gateway Controller (MGC).
The delivery mechanism should support the following protocols:  DPNSS (Digital Private Network Signaling System)
Digital Access Signaling System Number 2)
[3] Unless specifically mentioned, the details in this document are applicable to both DPNSS and DASS 2.
Terminology Data channel (D channel)
A 64 kbit/s time slot that functions as a common signaling channel on a 2048 kbits/s interface or a 1544 kbits/
interface that is provisioned to carry DPNSS signaling.
DPNSS channel Time slots 1 to 15 and 17 to 31 on a 2048 kbits/
interface or Time slots 1 to 23 on a 1544 kbits/s interface are termed as DPNSS channels.
These are the traffic channels that carry voice or data traffic.
DPNSS supports 60 Channels (30 Real and 30 Virtual)
DASS2 supports 30 Channels (All Real) Data Link Connection(DLC)
A DLC is the level 2 process that controls the transfer of level 3 messages on behalf of one DPNSS channel.
A DLC uniquely identifies one DPNSS channel.
DPNSS supports 60 DLCs (30 Real and 30 Virtual)
DASSII supports 30 DLCs (All Real)
A logical collection of the D channel and the associated DPNSS channels in a 2048 kbits/s interface or a 1544 kbits/
interface is called a "DPNSS Link".
Real channel A signalling channel with an associated traffic channel (TS).
Virtual channel A signalling channel with no associated traffic channel.
The DPNSS minimum retransmission period.
The DPNSS minimum post retransmission acknowledgement delay.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].
DPNSS Overview DPNSS is an industry standard interface (ref.
[2], which is defined between a PBX and an Access Network (AN).
DPNSS extends facilities that are normally only available between extensions on a single PBX to all extensions on PBXs that are connected in a private network.
DPNSS was originally derived from BT's Digital Access Signaling System I (DASS I), and was enhanced where necessary to meet the private network requirements.
Some of these enhancements were incorporated in DASS 2 [3].
DPNSS uses a 2048 kbits/s or 1544 kbits/s Digital Transmission System Interface, as shown in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1 Channel 16 is on
a 2048 kbits/s (E1) interface and channel 24 is on a 1544 kbits/s (T1) interface and is reserved for data communication between LE and AN.
The channels reserved for data are called "Data Channels" or "D Channels.
The D Channels are the physical media used to exchange data between the DPNSS protocol peer entities.
A logical collection of the D channel and the associated DPNSS channels is called a "DPNSS Link".

IUA This section outlines the differences between DUA and IUA. 2.1.
New Message Class for DUA
The DPNSS/DASS2 Layer 2 to Layer 3 primitives [2]
[3] need to be identifiable from IUA boundary primitive transport messages and the boundary primitive transport messages of other IUA extensions (i.e., V5 or GR 303).
Therefore, it is necessary to use a different message class parameter for DUA messages.
The IUA Message Header [1] MUST be used with the DPTM messages, but the DLCI field in the DLCI parameter is formatted differently.
Figure 2 below shows the IUA Message Header with integer based Interface Identifier. 0
3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
In DUA, the DLCI field has a different format, in accordance with the ND1301:2001/03 (formerly BTNR 188)
7 bits Should be set to all '0's and ignored by the receiver.
V bit:  1 bit The V bit is used to determine if the message is for a particular DLC or if it is applicable for all the DLCs in the carrier.
This V bit value is used only by the Establish and Release messages.
Data messages should ignore this value.
This indicator is provided so that a single command can be issued to establish or release all the DLCs in one DPNSS Link.
(Channel No.), the valid values are 0 to 63 for DPNSS and 0 to 31 for DASS 2.
This is because DASS 2 does not support virtual DLCs and, hence, has only 32 DLCs.
Unit Data Message DPNSS layer 2 does not have a unit data primitive and, hence, the Unit Data Messages (Request, Indication) are invalid for a DUA application.
The Data Request and Indication messages (message types 1 and 2, respectively) will be used with DUA.
For DUA, a new message is necessary to carry the status of the DLCs.
This message will be a Management message (i.e., its message class will be a value of 0 for Management).
The DLC Status messages are exchanged between DUA layer peers to request, confirm, and indicate the status of the DLCs.
The DLC Status messages contain the common message header, followed by IUA message header, as described in section 2.2.
In addition, the DLC Status Confirm and Indication messages will contain the new parameter, called the DLC Status parameter.
This parameter will have the following format for an E1 interface:
D8  D9 D10 D11 D12 D13
NA D17 D18 D19 D20
D24 D25 D26 D27 D28 D29 D30 D31
NA D33 D34 D35 D36 D37 D38 D39 D40 D41
D56 D57 D58 D59 D60 D61 D62 D63    NA stands for Not Applicable.
D0 and D16 are not applicable for an E1 interface because timeslot 0 is used for E1 framing and synchronization bits and timeslot 16 is used for signaling.
For DPNSS, there would be a total of max 60 DLCs
(30 real   30 virtual) and
in case of DASS2 there would be a total of 30 DLCs (no virtuals).
This parameter will have the following format for a T1 interface:
D5  D6  D7  D8  D9 D10 D11 D12 D13
D16 D17 D18 D19 D20 D21 D22
D24 D25 D26 D27 D28 D29 D30 D31
NA D33 D34 D35 D36 D37 D38 D39 D40 D41
D23 is not applicable for a T1 interface because timeslot 23 is used for signaling.
For DPNSS, there would be a total of max 46 DLCs (23 real   23 virtual) and in case of DASS2 there would be a total of 23 DLCs (no virtuals).
The parameter carries the status of DLCs using two bits for each DLC.
The possible values for the two bits are shown below:
(Out Of Service) is invalid because the DASS 2 DLC does not have this state.
In addition, the Idle state is a transient state local to the DLC, therefore, a value is not allocated for it.
For DASS 2, there are no virtual DLCs and, hence, information about only 32 DLCs need to be carried.
Therefore, the status message will have a length of 12 for a DASS 2 DLC Status message.
Only the Notify and Error messages are valid for DUA.
The TEI Status messages are not used.
The ERR message is sent when an invalid value or unrecognized message is found in an incoming message.
The Error Code parameter indicates the reason for the Error Message.
These are the supported values in IUA.
0x07 Unsupported Interface Identifier Type
0x0b Invalid TEI, SAPI combination
In DUA, the error codes 0x0a, 0x0b, and 0x0c are invalid, as they are specific to ISDN.
The following additional error codes are supported in DUA:
The "Channel Number out of range" error is sent if a message is received with a channel number greater than 63 for DPNSS or 31 for DASS 2.
The "Channel Number not configured" error is sent if a message is received with a channel number that is not configured.
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned a DUA value for the SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier field that is used in SCTP Payload Data chunks.
The following value for the SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier field SHOULD be used for DUA:
Use of SCTP Payload Protocol ID
As an option, the IUA value for SCTP Payload Protocol ID MAY also be used for DUA, for instance, if one wanted to backhaul ISDN and DPNSS over the same SCTP association.
However, use of separate SCTP Payload Protocol IDs (10 for DUA and 1 for IUA) is recommended as the primary option, even in scenarios where ISDN and DPNSS are backhauled over the same SCTP association.
SCTP Payload Protocol ID of "10
" SHOULD be used for DUA if only DPNSS is backhauled over an SCTP association (i.e., in scenarios where simultaneous backhauling of ISDN and DPNSS over the same association is NOT required).
The SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier is included in each SCTP Data chunk, to indicate which protocol the SCTP is carrying.
This Payload Protocol Identifier is not directly used by SCTP but MAY be used by certain network entities to identify the type of information being carried in a Data chunk.
An example of the message flows for establishing a data link on a signaling channel, passing PDUs and releasing a data link on a DPNSS channel is shown below.
An active association between MGC and SG is established prior to the following message flows.
Resetting of single DLC i)
Retransmissions over NT1 and NT2 expired Rel Ind
(Mark DLC status based on status bits)
If one of more DLCs remains out of service after this procedure (e.g., due to layer 2 management), the MGC can either retry this DLC with an Est Req(Ind 1) indicating the specific DLC or with an Est Req(Ind 0) and the SG will retry the appropriate DLC that is out of service.
(Mark DLC status based on status bits) 5.7.
The security considerations for the ISDN User Adaptation Protocol (IUAP)
[1] (Section 6) and the security considerations for SIGTRAN Protocols document [4] apply to this document as well.
