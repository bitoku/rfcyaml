    \  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) facilities.  CFM\n   messages\
    \ are structured with an OpCode field and have provision for\n   the inclusion\
    \ of TLV-structured information.  IEEE 802.1 has\n   allocated blocks of CFM OpCodes\
    \ and TLV Types to the IETF.  This\n   document specifies the IANA considerations\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IEEE 802.1 Working Group has specified Connectivity\
    \ Fault\n   Management (CFM) [802.1Q] OAM [RFC6291] facilities.  CFM messages\
    \ are\n   structured with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion\n\
    \   of TLV-structured information.\n   IEEE 802.1 has allocated the block of 32\
    \ CFM OpCodes from 64 through\n   95 and the block of 32 CFM TLV Types from 64\
    \ through 95 to the IETF\n   (see Appendix A).  This document specifies the IANA\
    \ considerations\n   for the assignment of values from these two blocks.\n   IEEE\
    \ 802.1 previously allocated similar blocks of values from 32\n   through 63 to\
    \ ITU-T [Y.1731].\n"

    \ considering the referenced liaison from the TRILL WG, IEEE\n   802.1 has voted\
    \ to approve the allocation of code points from the\n   Connectivity Fault Management\
    \ protocol of IEEE Std 802.1Q(TM)-2011\n   for use by IETF.  The expectation of\
    \ IEEE 802.1 is that these code\n   points will be allocated through IANA only\
    \ on the basis of IETF\n   standards actions.  Specifically, the allocation includes:\n\
    \      + 32 CFM OpCode Field values. Reference IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011\n        Clause\
    \ 21.4.3, Table 21-4. The OpCode Field values 64-95\n                        \
    \                                        10\n        are allocated to the IETF.\n\
    \      + 32 TLV Type Field values. Reference IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011\n        Clause\
    \ 21.5.1.1, Table 21-6. The Type Field values 64-95\n                        \
    \                                        10\n        are allocated to the IETF.\n\
    \      IEEE Std 802.1Q will be revised at some future date to document\n     \
    \ this allocation. In the meantime, the allocation will be recorded\n      through\
    \ the IEEE 802.1 maintenance process.\n      Regards,\n      Tony Jeffree\n  \
