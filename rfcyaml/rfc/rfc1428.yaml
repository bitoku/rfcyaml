- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Protocols for extending SMTP to pass 8bit characters have been\n\
    \   defined [3] [4]. These protocols require that messages transported by\n  \
    \ the extended SMTP are to be encoded in MIME [1] [2].  Before work\n   began\
    \ on these protocols, several SMTP implementations adopted ad-hoc\n   mechanisms\
    \ for sending 8bit data. It is desirable for the extended\n   SMTP environment\
    \ and these ad hoc mechanisms interoperate.  This\n   document outlines the problems\
    \ in this environment and an approach to\n   minimizing the cost of transition\
    \ from current usage of non-MIME 8bit\n   messages to MIME.\n"
- title: 1. Terminology
  contents:
  - "1. Terminology\n   RFC 821 defines a 7bit transport.  A transport agent which\
    \ does not\n   clear the high order bit upon receipt of octets with this bit set\
    \ in\n   SMTP messages is called 8 bit transparent in this document. An\n   implementation\
    \ of the general SMTP Extensions document [3] and the\n   8bit extensions protocol\
    \ [4] which passes MIME messages using all 8\n   bits of an octet is called 8bit\
    \ ESMTP.  An implementation of extended\n   SMTP which does not accept 8bit characters\
    \ is called 7bit ESMTP.  A\n   gateway is defined to be a transport agent with\
    \ User Agent authority\n   to alter or convert the content of a message.\n"
- title: 2. The Problem
  contents:
  - "2. The Problem\n   SMTP as defined in RFC 821 limits the sending of Internet\
    \ Mail to\n   US-ASCII [5] characters.  As the Internet has grown to include non-\n\
    \   English correspondents, the need to communicate with character sets\n   other\
    \ than US-ASCII has prompted many vendors and users to extend\n   SMTP or RFC\
    \ 822 to use non-ASCII character sets.  Common approaches\n   are to send 7 bit\
    \ national variant ISO 646 character sets over\n   current RFC822/SMTP, to extend\
    \ SMTP and RFC822 to use 8bit ISO 8859\n   character sets, and to use proprietary\
    \ PC character sets.\n   A third approach is used for Japanese mail.  Japanese\
    \ characters are\n   represented by pairs of octets with the high order bit cleared.\n\
    \   Switching between 14 bit character sets and 7 bit character sets is\n   indicated\
    \ within the message by ISO 2022 escape sequences.\n   So long as these implementations\
    \ can communicate without intermediate\n   transformations and have a loose private\
    \ agreement on the use of a\n   specific character set without tagging, basic\
    \ mail service can be\n   provided.\n   In the transition to the negotiated 8bit\
    \ ESMTP/MIME environment, it\n   is important that mail sent by a currently non-conforming\
    \ user can be\n   read by another non-conforming user.  This existing functionality\
    \ is\n   reduced by conversion from 8bit text to text encoded in unreadable\n\
    \   Base-64 or \"garbled\" text encoded in quoted printable.\n   There are several\
    \ interesting non-interoperable cases that currently\n   exist in non US-ASCII\
    \ mail and several new ones likely to emerge in a\n   transition to 8bit/MIME.\
    \  Below is a listing of the transition-to-\n   mime cases.  Only solutions to\
    \ (4) in the context of a translating\n   gateway are discussed in this memo.\n\
    \                \\ Receiver\n                  \\    7bit     8bit          MIME/\n\
    \             Sender \\| only   | transparent | ESMTP\n           ----------------------------------------\n\

    \          MIME/ESMTP |  (5)   |    (5)      | (6)\n   (1) 7Bit non-MIME sender\
    \ to 7bit, MIME, or 8bit transparent receiver\n      This will continue to work\
    \ unchanged with nationally varient ISO\n      646 or ISO 2022 character set shifting\
    \ if an external \"out of\n      band\" agreement exists between the sender and\
    \ the receiver.  A\n      7bit to 8bit/ESMTP gateway need not alter the content\
    \ of this\n      message.\n   (2) 8bit sender to 7bit non-MIME receiver\n    \
    \  The receiver will receive bit-stripped mail which results in the\n      mis-interpretation\
    \ of the data and the wrong character being\n      displayed or printed.  Mail\
    \ sent using languages where most\n      characters are in the US-ASCII subset\
    \ of ISO 8859 may be somewhat\n      readable.\n   (3) 8bit transparent sender\
    \ to 8bit transparent receiver\n      Will work if an external agreement \"out\
    \ of band\" to use a\n      particular character set without tagging exists between\
    \ the sender\n      and the receiver.\n   (4) 8bit transparent sender to MIME/ESMTP\
    \ conformant receiver\n      Will work if a reasonable upgrade path is provided\
    \ via gateways,\n      the indicated character set tag inserted by the gateway\
    \ is correct\n      and the receiver supports the character set chosen by the\
    \ sender.\n      This case is the focus of this memo.\n   (5) MIME/ESMTP sender\
    \ to non-MIME 7bit receiver\n      Because the ESMTP/MIME sender cannot know if\
    \ the receiver will\n      understand 8bits, the sender will encode the text into\
    \ base-64 or\n      quoted-printable which may be considered \"garbled\" by the\n\
    \      receiver.  To provide a useful downgrade path the gateway must\n      have\
    \ some knowledge about the capabilities of the receiver. When\n      the character\
    \ set can be clearly identified, techniques like the\n      menmonic MNEM encoding\
    \ described in RFC 1345 may be helpful in\n      this case.\n   (6) MIME/ESMTP\
    \ sender to MIME/ESMTP receiver\n      Interoperability will be attained provided\
    \ the receiver supports\n      the character set chosen by the sender.\n"
- title: 3. Upgrade Path from 8bit Transparent to ESMTP/MIME
  contents:
  - "3. Upgrade Path from 8bit Transparent to ESMTP/MIME\n   A gateway which has been\
    \ upgraded to support Extended SMTP may\n   upgrade an 8bit message received to\
    \ MIME.  This is consistent with\n   the requirement that all 8bit mail sent by\
    \ ESMTP be encoded in MIME.\n   The upgrade should be done using the best available\
    \ information.\n   A site may \"upgrade\" to MIME en-masse by implementing MIME\
    \ conversion\n   for all messages leaving the site.  For text messages, the body\
    \ can\n   be converted by adding a MIME-version header and a Content-Type:\n \
    \  Text/Plain with the character set in use in the site, provided the\n   site\
    \ uses a single character set.\n   An appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding header\
    \ line must be added to\n   indicate any encoding that may be necessary.\n   \
    \ Example:\n       MIME-Version: 1.0\n       Content-Type: Text/Plain; Charset\
    \ = ISO-8859-1\n       Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n   If no information about\
    \ the character set in use is available, the\n   gateway should upgrade the content\
    \ by using the character set\n   \"unknown-8bit\". The unknown-8bit value of the\
    \ charset parameter\n   indicates only that no reliable information about the\
    \ character\n   set(s) used in the message was available.\n   If a message body\
    \ has been upgraded to MIME, the RFC 822 headers\n   containing non US-ASCII characters\
    \ must be upgraded to conform with\n   the header encoding rules of RFC1342. A\
    \ gateway should recode all\n   unstructered header fields as well as RFC 822\
    \ \"comment\"s and\n   \"phrase\"s according to the rules of RFC 1342. There is\
    \ no equivalent\n   in RFC 1342 to the \"8bit\" Content-Transfer-Encoding value\
    \ for message\n   bodies so all 8bit header text must be transformed according\
    \ to\n   either the \"B\" or the \"Q\" encoding method.  For ISO 8859 character\n\
    \   sets, the \"Q\" encoding will generally result in somewhat readable\n   headers.\n\
    \   Trace information should be added to the document with a convert\n   clause:\
    \ \"rfc822-to-8bit\", \"rfc822-to-base-64\" or \"rfc822-to-quoted-\n   printable\"\
    \ e.g.,\n   Received: from dbc.mtview.ca.us by dbc.mtview.ca.us\n            \
    \ convert rfc822-to-8bit; Tue, 01 Sep 1992 01:18:00 -0700\n"
- title: Appendix - The "unknown-8bit" Character Set
  contents:
  - "Appendix - The \"unknown-8bit\" Character Set\n   This section defines a \"charset\"\
    \ parameter, for use in a MIME\n   Content-Type field.\n   A special purpose character\
    \ set called \"unknown-8bit\" is defined to\n   be an unknown 8bit character set,\
    \ encoded into a sequence of octets.\n   It can be used as a label for any character\
    \ set from any language,\n   using any encoding.  It must not be further defined.\n\
    \   The use of this token in a \"charset=\" field of a message indicates\n   that\
    \ nothing is known about the character set used. This marker is\n   intended for\
    \ use by non-MIME to MIME gateways; specifically in those\n   which translate\
    \ from SMTP to 8bit ESMTP/MIME.\n   This character set is not intended to be used\
    \ by mail composers.  It\n   is assumed that the mail composer knows the character\
    \ set in use and\n   will mark it with a character set value as specified in [1],\
    \ as\n   amended by current Assigned Numbers documents [6].\n   The use of the\
    \ \"unknown-8bit\" label is intended only by mail gateway\n   agents which cannot\
    \ determine via out-of-band information the\n   intended character set.\n   The\
    \ interpretation of the \"unknown-8bit\" is up to the mail reader.\n   It is assumed\
    \ that in many cases the human user will be able to\n   interpret the information\
    \ and choose an appropriate character set or\n   pre-processor.\n"
