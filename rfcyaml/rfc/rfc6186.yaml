  - "1.  Introduction\n   Internet email protocols include SMTP [RFC5321], IMAP [RFC3501],
    and\n   POP3 [RFC1939].  IMAP and POP3 are both message store access\n   protocols
    used by message store user agents (MUAs) to manipulate\n   email messages after
    delivery.  [RFC4409] defines a \"profile\" of the\n   SMTP service that is specifically
    used for message submission.  MUAs\n   are expected to submit messages to mail
    submission agents (MSAs)\n   using this approach.\n   [RFC2782] defines a DNS-based
    service discovery protocol that has\n   been widely adopted as a means of locating
    particular services within\n   a local area network and beyond, using DNS SRV
    resource records\n   (RRs).\n   [RFC5321] specifies how to use DNS MX RRs to locate
    SMTP services for\n   a domain.  However, MUAs are expected to use the submission
    protocol\n   defined in [RFC4409], which does not use MX records.\n   Typically
    MUAs have required users to enter a fully qualified domain\n   name (FQDN) and
    port information for the services they need.  This is\n   not ideal as the way
    in which server configuration information is\n   specified can differ from MUA
    to MUA, and can be confusing to users,\n   leading to errors when inputting the
    details.  Alternatively, some\n   MUAs have adopted a complex \"auto-discovery\"
    process involving\n   probing a domain to see what services might be available.
    \ A better\n   approach to all this would be to require minimal information to
    be\n   entered by a user that would result in automatic configuration of\n   appropriate
    services for that user.  The minimal information entered\n   would be the user's
    email address.\n   This specification defines new SRV service types for the message\n
    \  submission, IMAP, and POP3 services, to enable simple auto-\n   configuration
    of MUAs.  The priority field of the SRV record can also\n   be used to indicate
    a preference for one message store access\n   protocol over another.\n"

    - "3.3.  POP3\n   This specification adds two SRV service labels for POP3 [RFC1939]:\n
      \  _pop3:  Identifies a POP3 server that MAY require the MUA to use the\n      \"STLS\"
      extension command [RFC2595] prior to authentication.\n   _pop3s:  Identifies
      a POP3 server where TLS [RFC5246] is initiated\n      directly upon connection
      to the POP3 server.\n   Example: service record\n       _pop3._tcp     SRV 0
      1 110 pop3.example.com.\n   Example: service record\n       _pop3s._tcp    SRV
      0 1 995 pop3.example.com.\n"

    - "3.4.  Priority for Domain Preferences\n   The priority field in the SRV RR
      allows a domain to indicate that\n   some records have a higher preference than
      others in the DNS query\n   results (determined by those records having a lower-numbered
      priority\n   value).  Typically, this is used for choosing a record from a set
      for\n   a single service label; however, it is not restricted to choice\n   within
      only one service.\n   Often a site will offer both IMAP and POP3 message store
      access\n   services for users.  However, the site may have a preference for
      one\n   over the other that they want to convey to the user to ensure that,\n
      \  when the user has an MUA capable of using both IMAP and POP3, the\n   preferred
      choice is used.\n   To aid with this choice, sites SHOULD offer both sets of
      IMAP (_imap\n   and/or _imaps) and POP3 (_pop3 and/or _pop3s) SRV records in
      their\n   DNS and set the priority for those sets of records such that the\n
      \  \"preferred\" service has a lower-numbered priority value than the\n   other.
      \ When an MUA supports both IMAP and POP3, it SHOULD retrieve\n   records for
      both services and then use the service with the lowest\n   priority value.  If
      the priority is the same for both services, MUAs\n   are free to choose whichever
      one is appropriate.  When considering\n   multiple records for different protocols
      at the same priority but\n   with different weights, the client MUST first select
      the protocol it\n   intends to use, then perform the weight selection algorithm
      given in\n   [RFC2782] on the records associated with the selected protocol.\n
      \  Example: service records for both IMAP and POP3, with IMAP having a\n   lower-numbered
      priority value (0) than POP3 (10), indicating to the\n   MUA that IMAP is preferred
      over POP3, when the MUA can support either\n   service.\n       _imap._tcp     SRV
      \ 0 1 143 imap.example.com.\n       _pop3._tcp     SRV 10 1 110 pop3.example.com.\n
      \  In addition, with SRV RRs it is possible to indicate that a\n   particular
      service is not supported at all at a particular domain by\n   setting the target
      of an SRV RR to \".\".  If such records are present,\n   clients MUST assume
      that the specified service is not available, and\n   instead make use of the
      other SRV RRs for the purposes of determining\n   the domain preference.\n   Example:
      service records for IMAP and POP3 with both TLS and non-TLS\n   service types
      are present.  Both IMAP and POP3 non-TLS service types\n   are marked as not
      available.  IMAP (with TLS) has a lower-numbered\n   priority value 0 than POP3
      (with TLS) at priority 10, indicating to\n   the MUA that IMAP is preferred
      over POP3, when the MUA can support\n   either service, and only the TLS versions
      of the services are\n   available.\n       _imap._tcp     SRV  0 0 0   .\n       _imaps._tcp
      \   SRV  0 1 993 imap.example.com.\n       _pop3._tcp     SRV  0 0 0   .\n       _pop3s._tcp
      \   SRV 10 1 995 pop3.example.com.\n"

  title: 3.  SRV Service Labels
- contents:
  - "4.  Guidance for MUAs\n   By using SRV records as above, MUAs need initially
    only to prompt the\n   user for their email address [RFC5322].  The \"local-part\"
    and\n   \"domain\" portions are then extracted from the email address by the\n
    \  MUA.  The MUA uses the \"domain\" portion as the service domain to\n   perform
    SRV lookups for the services it wants to configure.  If the\n   SRV lookup is
    successful, the target FQDN and port for the service\n   can be determined and
    used to complete MUA configuration.  If an SRV\n   record is not found, the MUA
    will need to prompt the user to enter\n   the FQDN and port information directly,
    or use some other heuristic.\n   In the case of multiple SRV records returned
    for a particular\n   service, the MUA MUST use the priority and weight fields
    in the\n   record to determine which one to use (as per [RFC2782]).\n   MUAs that
    support both POP3 and IMAP use the procedure in Section 3.4\n   to choose between
    each service when both are offered.\n   Subsequent to configuration, the MUA will
    connect to the service.\n   When using \"imaps\" or \"pop3s\" services, a TLS
    [RFC5246] negotiation\n   is done immediately upon connection.  With \"imap\",
    \"pop3\", and\n   \"submission\" services, the \"STARTTLS\", \"STLS\", and \"STARTTLS\"\n
    \  commands respectively are used to initiate a protected connection\n   using
    TLS [RFC5246].  When using TLS in this way, MUAs SHOULD use the\n   TLS Server
    Name Indication [RFC6066].  Certificate verification MUST\n   use the procedure
    outlined in Section 6 of [RFC6125] in regard to\n   verification with an SRV RR
    as the starting point.\n   Once a suitable connection has been made, and any required
    protection\n   set up, the MUA will typically need to authenticate with the IMAP,\n
    \  POP3, or SMTP (submission) server.  The details of that are governed\n   by
    the specific protocols themselves, though often times a \"user\n   identifier\"
    is required for some form of user/password\n   authentication.  When a user identifier
    is required, MUAs MUST first\n   use the full email address provided by the user,
    and if that results\n   in an authentication failure, SHOULD fall back to using
    the \"local-\n   part\" extracted from the email address.  This is in line with
    the\n   guidance outlined in Section 5.  If both these user identifiers\n   result
    in authentication failure, the MUA SHOULD prompt the user for\n   a valid identifier.\n
    \  Once a successful connection and authentication have been done, MUAs\n   SHOULD
    cache the service details (hostname, port, user identity) that\n   were successfully
    used, and reuse those when connecting again at a\n   later time.\n   If a subsequent
    connection attempt fails, or authentication fails,\n   MUAs SHOULD re-try the
    SRV lookup to \"refresh\" the cached data for\n   the same protocol the client
    had chosen earlier; i.e., this means\n   that the client MUST NOT change from
    IMAP service to POP3 (or vice\n   versa) due to changes in the corresponding SRV
    priorities without\n   user interaction.\n"
  title: 4.  Guidance for MUAs
- contents:
  - "5.  Guidance for Service Providers\n   Service providers wanting to offer IMAP,
    POP3, or SMTP (submission)\n   services that can be configured by MUAs using SRV
    records need to\n   follow certain guidelines to ensure proper operation.\n   a.
    \ IMAP, POP3, and SMTP (submission) servers SHOULD be configured to\n       allow
    authentication with email addresses or email local-parts.\n       In the former
    case, the email addresses MUST NOT conflict with\n       other forms of permitted
    user login name.  In the latter case,\n       the email local-parts need to be
    unique across the server and\n       MUST NOT conflict with any login name on
    the server.\n   b.  If the service provider uses TLS [RFC5246], the service provider\n
    \      MUST ensure a certificate is installed that can be verified by\n       MUAs
    using the procedure outlined in Section 6 of [RFC6125] in\n       regard to verification
    with an SRV RR as the starting point.  If\n       the service provider hosts multiple
    domains on the same IP\n       address, then the service provider MUST enable
    support for the\n       TLS Server Name Indication [RFC6066].\n   c.  Install
    the appropriate SRV records for the offered services.\n"
  title: 5.  Guidance for Service Providers
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   If a user has explicitly requested a connection
    with a transport\n   layer security mechanism (user interfaces sometimes present
    this\n   choice as a \"use SSL\" or \"secure connection\" checkbox), the MUA MUST\n
    \  successfully negotiate transport layer security prior to sending an\n   authentication
    command.  For example, the MUA MAY do this with\n   \"imaps\", \"pop3s\", \"imap\"
    with \"STARTTLS\", or \"pop3\" with \"STLS\".\n   Service providers MAY offer
    any subset of these four options for the\n   mail service.\n   A malicious attacker
    with access to the DNS server data, or able to\n   get spoofed answers cached
    in a recursive resolver, can potentially\n   cause MUAs to connect to any IMAP,
    POP3, or submission server chosen\n   by the attacker.  In the absence of a secure
    DNS option, MUAs SHOULD\n   check that the target FQDN returned in the SRV record
    matches the\n   original service domain that was queried.  If the target FQDN
    is not\n   in the queried domain, MUAs SHOULD verify with the user that the SRV\n
    \  target FQDN is suitable for use before executing any connections to\n   the
    host.  Alternatively, if TLS [RFC5246] is being used for the\n   email service,
    MUAs MUST use the procedure outlined in Section 6 of\n   [RFC6125] to verify the
    service.\n   Implementations of TLS [RFC5246] typically support multiple versions\n
    \  of the protocol as well as the older Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\n   protocol.
    \ Because of known security vulnerabilities, email clients\n   and email servers
    MUST NOT request, offer, or use SSL 2.0.  See\n   Appendix E.2 of [RFC5246] for
    further details.\n"
