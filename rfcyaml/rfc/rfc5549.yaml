  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) [RFC4760] specifies that the
    set of\n   network-layer protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop\n
    \  field may belong is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI)\n   and
    the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  A number of\n   existing AFI/SAFIs
    allow the Next Hop address to belong to a\n   different address family than the
    Network Layer Reachability\n   Information (NLRI).  For example, the AFI/SAFI
    <25/65> used (as per\n   [L2VPN-SIG]) in order to perform L2VPN auto-discovery,
    allows\n   advertising NLRI that contains the identifier of a Virtual Private\n
    \  LAN Service (VPLS) instance or that identifies a particular pool of\n   attachment
    circuits at a given Provider Edge (PE), while the Next Hop\n   field contains
    the loopback address of a PE.  Similarly, the AFI/SAFI\n   <1/132> (defined in
    [RFC4684]) in order to advertise Route Target\n   (RT) membership information,
    allows advertising NLRI that contains\n   such RT membership information, while
    the Next Hop field contains the\n   address of the advertising router.\n   Furthermore,
    a number of these existing AFI/SAFIs allow the Next Hop\n   to belong to either
    the IPv4 Network Layer Protocol or the IPv6\n   Network Layer Protocol, and specify
    the encoding of the Next Hop\n   information in order to determine which of the
    protocols the address\n   actually belongs to.  For example, [RFC4684] allows
    the Next Hop\n   address to be either IPv4 or IPv6 and states that the Next Hop
    field\n   address shall be interpreted as an IPv4 address whenever the length\n
    \  of Next Hop address is 4 octets, and as an IPv6 address whenever the\n   length
    of the Next Hop address is 16 octets.\n   There are situations such as those described
    in [RFC4925] and in\n   [MESH-FMWK] where carriers (or large enterprise networks
    acting as\n   carrier for their internal resources) may be required to establish\n
    \  connectivity between 'islands' of networks of one address family type\n   across
    a transit core of a differing address family type.  This\n   includes both the
    case of IPv6 islands across an IPv4 core and the\n   case of IPv4 islands across
    an IPv6 core.  Where Multiprotocol BGP\n   (MP-BGP) is used to advertise the corresponding
    reachability\n   information, this translates into the requirement for a BGP speaker\n
    \  to advertise Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of a given\n   address
    family via a Next Hop of a different address family (i.e.,\n   IPv6 NLRI with
    IPv4 Next Hop and IPv4 NLRI with IPv6 Next Hop).\n   The current AFI/SAFI definitions
    for the IPv6 address family assume\n   that the Next Hop address belongs to the
    IPv6 address family type.\n   Specifically, as per [RFC2545] and [RFC3107], when
    the <AFI/SAFI> is\n   <2/1>, <2/2>, or <2/4>, the Next Hop address is assumed
    to be of IPv6\n   type.  As per [RFC4659], when the <AFI/SAFI> is <2/128>, the
    Next Hop\n   address is assumed to be of IPv6-VPN type.\n   However, [RFC4798]
    and [RFC4659] specify how an IPv4 address can be\n   encoded inside the Next Hop
    IPv6 address field when IPv6 NLRI needs\n   to be advertised with an IPv4 Next
    Hop.  [RFC4798] defines how the\n   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address format specified
    in the IPv6 addressing\n   architecture ([RFC4291]) can be used for that purpose
    when the <AFI/\n   SAFI> is <2/1>, <2/2>, or <2/4>.  [RFC4659] defines how the
    IPv4-\n   mapped IPv6 address format as well as a null Route Distinguisher can\n
    \  be used for that purpose when the <AFI/SAFI> is <2/128>.  Thus, there\n   are
    existing solutions for the advertisement of IPv6 NLRI with an\n   IPv4 Next Hop.\n
    \  Similarly, the current AFI/SAFI definitions for advertisement of IPv4\n   NLRI
    or VPN-IPv4 NLRI assume that the Next Hop address belongs to the\n   IPv4 address
    family type.  Specifically, as per [RFC4760] and\n   [RFC3107], when the <AFI/SAFI>
    is <1/1>, <1/2>, or <1/4>, the Next\n   Hop address is assumed to be of IPv4 type.
    \ As per [RFC4364], when\n   the <AFI/SAFI> is <1/128>, the Next Hop address is
    assumed to be of\n   VPN-IPv4 type.  There is clearly no generally applicable
    method for\n   encoding an IPv6 address inside the IPv4 address field of the Next\n
    \  Hop.  Hence, there is currently no specified solution for advertising\n   IPv4
    or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.\n   This document specifies the extensions
    necessary to do so.  This\n   comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions
    to allow the\n   address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to belong
    to\n   either the IPv4 or the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop\n   information
    in order to determine which of the protocols the address\n   actually belongs
    to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP peers\n   to dynamically discover
    whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-\n   IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.
    \ The new BGP Capability allows\n   gradual deployment of the new functionality
    of advertising IPv4\n   reachability via an IPv6 Next Hop, without any flag day
    nor any risk\n   of traffic black-holing.\n"

    2119 [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Requirements Language

  - "3.  Extension of AFI/SAFI Definitions for the IPv4 Address Family\n   As mentioned
    earlier, MP-BGP specifies that the set of network-layer\n   protocols to which
    the address carried in the Next Hop field may\n   belong is determined by the
    Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the\n   Subsequent Address Family Identifier
    (SAFI).  The following current\n   AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4
    NLRI (<1/1>,\n   <1/2>, <1/4>, and <1/128>) only have provisions for advertising
    a\n   Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol.  This document\n   extends
    the definition of the AFI/SAFI for advertisement of IPv4 NLRI\n   and VPN-IPv4
    NLRI to extend the set of network-layer protocols to\n   which the Next Hop address
    can belong, to include IPv6 in addition to\n   IPv4.\n   Specifically, this document
    allows advertising with [RFC4760] of an\n   MP_REACH_NLRI with:\n   o  AFI = 1\n
    \  o  SAFI = 1, 2, 4, or 128\n   o  Length of Next Hop Address = 16 or 32\n   o
    \ Next Hop Address = IPv6 address of next hop (potentially followed\n      by
    the link-local IPv6 address of the next hop).  This field is to\n      be constructed
    as per Section 3 of [RFC2545].\n   o  NLRI= NLRI as per current AFI/SAFI definition\n
    \  This is in addition to the current mode of operation allowing\n   advertisement
    of NLRI for <AFI/SAFI> of <1/1>, <1/2> and <1/4> with a\n   next hop address of
    IPv4 type and advertisement of NLRI for <AFI/\n   SAFI> of <1/128> with a next
    hop address of VPN-IPv4 type.\n   The BGP speaker receiving the advertisement
    MUST use the Length of\n   Next Hop Address field to determine which network-layer
    protocol the\n   next hop address belongs to.  When the Length of Next Hop Address\n
    \  field is equal to 16 or 32, the next hop address is of type IPv6.\n   Note
    that this method of using the Length of the Next Hop Address\n   field to determine
    which network-layer protocol the next hop address\n   belongs to (out of the set
    of protocols allowed by the AFI/SAFI\n   definition) is the same as used in [RFC4684]
    and [L2VPN-SIG].\n"
  title: 3.  Extension of AFI/SAFI Definitions for the IPv4 Address Family
- contents:
  - "4.  Use of BGP Capability Advertisement\n   [RFC5492] defines a mechanism to
    allow two BGP speakers to discover\n   if a particular capability is supported
    by their BGP peer and thus\n   whether it can be used with that peer.  This document
    defines a new\n   capability that can be advertised using [RFC5492] and that is\n
    \  referred to as the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability.  This\n   capability
    allows BGP speakers to discover whether, for a given NLRI\n   <AFI/SAFI>, a peer
    supports advertisement with a next hop whose\n   network protocol is determined
    by the value of the Length of Next Hop\n   Address field, as specified in Section
    3.\n   A BGP speaker that wishes to advertise to a BGP peer an IPv6 Next Hop\n
    \  for IPv4 NLRI or for VPN-IPv4 NLRI as per this specification MUST use\n   the
    Capability Advertisement procedures defined in [RFC5492] with the\n   Extended
    Next Hop Encoding Capability to establish whether its peer\n   supports this for
    the NLRI AFI/SAFI pair(s) of interest.  The fields\n   in the Capabilities Optional
    Parameter MUST be set as follows:\n   o  The Capability Code field MUST be set
    to 5 (which indicates the\n      Extended Next Hop Encoding capability).\n   o
    \ The Capability Length field is set to a variable value that is the\n      length
    of the Capability Value field (which follows).\n   o  The Capability Value field
    has the following format:\n         +-----------------------------------------------------+\n
    \        | NLRI AFI - 1 (2 octets)                             |\n         +-----------------------------------------------------+\n
    \        | NLRI SAFI - 1 (2 octets)                            |\n         +-----------------------------------------------------+\n
    \        | Nexthop AFI - 1 (2 octets)                          |\n         +-----------------------------------------------------+\n
    \        | .....                                               |\n         +-----------------------------------------------------+\n
    \        | NLRI AFI - N (2 octets)                             |\n         +-----------------------------------------------------+\n
    \        | NLRI SAFI - N (2 octets)                            |\n         +-----------------------------------------------------+\n
    \        | Nexthop AFI - N (2 octets)                          |\n         +-----------------------------------------------------+\n
    \     where:\n      *  each triple <NLRI AFI, NLRI SAFI, Nexthop AFI> indicates
    that\n         NLRI of <NLRI AFI / NLRI SAFI> may be advertised with a Next\n
    \        Hop address belonging to the network-layer protocol of Nexthop\n         AFI.\n
    \     *  the AFI and SAFI values are defined in the Address Family\n         Identifier
    and Subsequent Address Family Identifier registries\n         maintained by IANA.\n
    \  Since this document only concerns itself with the advertisement of\n   IPv4
    NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop, this specification\n   only allows
    the following values in the Capability Value field of the\n   Extended Next Hop
    Encoding capability:\n   o  NLRI AFI = 1 (IPv4)\n   o  NLRI SAFI = 1, 2, 4, or
    128\n   o  Nexthop AFI = 2 (IPv6)\n   This specification does not propose that
    the Extended Next Hop\n   Encoding capability be used with any other combinations
    of <NLRI AFI,\n   NLRI SAFI, Nexthop AFI>.  In particular, this specification
    does not\n   propose that the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability be used for\n
    \  NLRI AFI/SAFIs whose definition already allows use of both IPv4 and\n   IPv6
    next hops (e.g., AFI/SAFI = <1/132> as defined in [RFC4684]).\n   Similarly, it
    does not propose that the Extended Next Hop Encoding\n   capability be used for
    NLRI AFI/SAFIs for which there is already a\n   solution for advertising a next
    hop of a different address family\n   (e.g., AFI/SAFI = <2/1>, <2/2>, or <2/4>
    with IPv4 Next Hop as per\n   [RFC4798] and AFI/SAFI = <2/128> with IPv4 Next
    Hop as per\n   [RFC4659]).\n   It is expected that if new AFI/SAFIs are defined
    in the future, their\n   definition will have provisions (where appropriate) for
    both IPv4 and\n   IPv6 Next Hops from the onset, with determination based on Length
    of\n   Next Hop Address field.  Thus, new AFI/SAFIs are not expected to make\n
    \  use of the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability.\n   A BGP speaker MUST only
    advertise to a BGP peer the IPv4 or VPN-IPv4\n   NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop if
    the BGP speaker has first ascertained\n   via BGP Capability Advertisement that
    the BGP peer supports the\n   Extended Next Hop Encoding capability for the relevant
    AFI/SAFI pair.\n   The Extended Next Hop Encoding capability provides information
    about\n   next hop encoding for a given AFI/SAFI, assuming that AFI/SAFI is\n
    \  allowed.  It does not influence whether that AFI/SAFI is indeed\n   allowed.
    \ Whether a AFI/SAFI can be used between the BGP peers is\n   purely determined
    through the Multiprotocol Extensions capability\n   defined in [RFC4760].\n   The
    Extended Next Hop Encoding capability MAY be dynamically updated\n   through the
    use of the Dynamic Capability capability and associated\n   mechanisms defined
    in [DYN-CAP].\n"
  title: 4.  Use of BGP Capability Advertisement
- contents:
  - "5.  Operations\n   By default, if a particular BGP session is running over IPvx
    (where\n   IPvx is IPv4 or IPv6), and if the BGP speaker sending an update is\n
    \  putting its own address in as the next hop, then the next hop address\n   SHOULD
    be specified as an IPvx address, using the encoding rules\n   specified in the
    AFI/SAFI definition of the NLRI being updated.  This\n   default behavior may
    be overridden by policy.\n   When a next hop address needs to be passed along
    unchanged (e.g., as\n   a Route Reflector (RR) would do), its encoding MUST NOT
    be changed.\n   If a particular RR client cannot handle that encoding (as determined\n
    \  by the BGP Capability Advertisement), then the NLRI in question\n   cannot
    be distributed to that client.  For sound routing in certain\n   scenarios, this
    will require that all the RR clients be able to\n   handle whatever encodings
    any of them may generate.\n"
