  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the requirements for the management
    of\n   equipment used in networks supporting an MPLS Transport Profile\n   (MPLS-TP).
    \ The requirements are defined for specification of network\n   management aspects
    of protocol mechanisms and procedures that\n   constitute the building blocks
    out of which the MPLS Transport\n   Profile is constructed.  That is, these requirements
    indicate what\n   management capabilities need to be available in MPLS for use
    in\n   managing the MPLS-TP.  This document is intended to identify\n   essential
    network management capabilities, not to specify what\n   functions any particular
    MPLS implementation supports.\n   This document also leverages management requirements
    specified in\n   ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [1] and RFC 4377 [2], and attempts to comply
    with\n   the guidelines defined in RFC 5706 [15].\n   ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 defines
    generic management requirements for\n   transport networks.  RFC 4377 specifies
    the operations and management\n   requirements, including operations-and-management-related
    network\n   management requirements, for MPLS networks.\n   This document is a
    product of a joint ITU-T and IETF effort to\n   include an MPLS Transport Profile
    (MPLS-TP) within the IETF MPLS and\n   Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
    architectures to support\n   capabilities and functionality of a transport network
    as defined by\n   the ITU-T.\n   The requirements in this document derive from
    two sources:\n   1) MPLS and PWE3 architectures as defined by the IETF, and\n
    \  2) packet transport networks as defined by the ITU-T.\n   Requirements for
    management of equipment in MPLS-TP networks are\n   defined herein.  Related functions
    of MPLS and PWE3 are defined\n   elsewhere (and are out of scope in this document).\n
    \  This document expands on the requirements in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [1]\n   and
    RFC 4377 [2] to cover fault, configuration, performance, and\n   security management
    for MPLS-TP networks, and the requirements for\n   object and information models
    needed to manage MPLS-TP networks and\n   network elements.\n   In writing this
    document, the authors assume the reader is familiar\n   with RFCs 5921 [8] and
    5950 [9].\n"

    - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
      \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and
      \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
      2119 [5].\n   Although this document is not a protocol specification, the use
      of\n   this language clarifies the instructions to protocol designers\n   producing
      solutions that satisfy the requirements set out in this\n   document.\n   Anomaly:
      The smallest discrepancy that can be observed between actual\n   and desired
      characteristics of an item.  The occurrence of a single\n   anomaly does not
      constitute an interruption in ability to perform a\n   required function.  Anomalies
      are used as the input for the\n   Performance Monitoring (PM) process and for
      detection of defects\n   (from [21], Section 3.7).\n   Communication Channel
      (CCh): A logical channel between network\n   elements (NEs) that can be used
      (for example) for management or\n   control plane applications.  The physical
      channel supporting the CCh\n   is technology specific.  See Appendix A.\n   Data
      Communication Network (DCN): A network that supports Layer 1\n   (physical layer),
      Layer 2 (data-link layer), and Layer 3 (network\n   layer) functionality for
      distributed management communications\n   related to the management plane, for
      distributed signaling\n   communications related to the control plane, and other
      operations\n   communications (e.g., order-wire/voice communications, software\n
      \  downloads, etc.).\n   Defect: The density of anomalies has reached a level
      where the\n   ability to perform a required function has been interrupted.  Defects\n
      \  are used as input for performance monitoring, the control of\n   consequent
      actions, and the determination of fault cause (from [21],\n   Section 3.24).\n
      \  Failure: The fault cause persisted long enough to consider the\n   ability
      of an item to perform a required function to be terminated.\n   The item may
      be considered as failed; a fault has now been detected\n   (from [21], Section
      3.25).\n   Fault: A fault is the inability of a function to perform a required\n
      \  action.  This does not include an inability due to preventive\n   maintenance,
      lack of external resources, or planned actions (from\n   [21], Section 3.26).\n
      \  Fault Cause: A single disturbance or fault may lead to the detection\n   of
      multiple defects.  A fault cause is the result of a correlation\n   process
      that is intended to identify the defect that is\n   representative of the disturbance
      or fault that is causing the\n   problem (from [21], Section 3.27).\n   Fault
      Cause Indication (FCI): An indication of a fault cause.\n   Management Communication
      Channel (MCC): A CCh dedicated for\n   management plane communications.\n   Management
      Communication Network (MCN): A DCN supporting management\n   plane communication
      is referred to as a Management Communication\n   Network (MCN).\n   MPLS-TP
      NE: A network element (NE) that supports the functions of\n   MPLS necessary
      to participate in an MPLS-TP based transport service.\n   See RFC 5645 [7] for
      further information on functionality required to\n   support MPLS-TP.\n   MPLS-TP
      network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed.\n   Operations, Administration
      and Maintenance (OAM), On-Demand and\n   Proactive: One feature of OAM that
      is largely a management issue is\n   control of OAM; on-demand and proactive
      are modes of OAM mechanism\n   operation defined in (for example) Y.1731 ([22]
      - Sections 3.45 and\n   3.44, respectively) as:\n   o  On-demand OAM - OAM actions
      that are initiated via manual\n      intervention for a limited time to carry
      out diagnostics.\n      On-demand OAM can result in singular or periodic OAM
      actions\n      during the diagnostic time interval.\n   o  Proactive OAM - OAM
      actions that are carried on continuously to\n      permit timely reporting of
      fault and/or performance status.\n   (Note that it is possible for specific
      OAM mechanisms to only have a\n   sensible use in either on-demand or proactive
      mode.)\n   Operations System (OS): A system that performs the functions that\n
      \  support processing of information related to operations,\n   administration,
      maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) for the\n   networks, including surveillance
      and testing functions to support\n   customer access maintenance.\n   Signaling
      Communication Channel (SCC): A CCh dedicated for control\n   plane communications.
      \ The SCC can be used for GMPLS/ASON signaling\n   and/or other control plane
      messages (e.g., routing messages).\n   Signaling Communication Network (SCN):
      A DCN supporting control plane\n   communication is referred to as a Signaling
      Communication Network\n   (SCN).\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Management Interface Requirements\n   This document does not specify a preferred
    management interface\n   protocol to be used as the standard protocol for managing
    MPLS-TP\n   networks.  Managing an end-to-end connection across multiple operator\n
    \  domains where one domain is managed (for example) via NETCONF [16] or\n   SNMP
    [17], and another domain via CORBA [18], is allowed.\n   1) For the management
    interface to the management system, an MPLS-TP\n      NE MAY actively support
    more than one management protocol in any\n      given deployment.\n   For example,
    an operator can use one protocol for configuration of an\n   MPLS-TP NE and another
    for monitoring.  The protocols to be supported\n   are at the discretion of the
    operator.\n"
  title: 2.  Management Interface Requirements
- contents:
  - "3.  Management Communication Channel (MCC) Requirements\n   1) Specifications
    SHOULD define support for management connectivity\n      with remote MPLS-TP domains
    and NEs, as well as with termination\n      points located in NEs under the control
    of a third party network\n      operator.  See ITU-T G.8601 [23] for example scenarios
    in multi-\n      carrier, multi-transport technology environments.\n   2) For
    management purposes, every MPLS-TP NE MUST connect to an OS.\n      The connection
    MAY be direct (e.g., via a software, hardware, or\n      proprietary protocol
    connection) or indirect (via another MPLS-TP\n      NE).  In this document, any
    management connection that is not via\n      another MPLS-TP NE is a direct management
    connection.  When an\n      MPLS-TP NE is connected indirectly to an OS, an MCC
    MUST be\n      supported between that MPLS-TP NE and any MPLS-TP NE(s) used to\n
    \     provide the connection to an OS.\n"
  title: 3.  Management Communication Channel (MCC) Requirements
- contents:
  - "4.  Management Communication Network (MCN) Requirements\n   Entities of the MPLS-TP
    management plane communicate via a DCN, or\n   more specifically via the MCN.
    \ The MCN connects management systems\n   with management systems, management
    systems with MPLS-TP NEs, and (in\n   the indirect connectivity case discussed
    in section 3) MPLS-TP NEs\n   with MPLS-TP NEs.\n   RFC 5586 [14] defines a Generic
    Associated Channel (G-ACh) to enable\n   the realization of a communication channel
    (CCh) between adjacent\n   MPLS-TP NEs for management and control.  RFC 5718 [10]
    describes how\n   the G-ACh can be used to provide infrastructure that forms part
    of\n   the MCN and SCN.  It also explains how MCN and SCN messages are\n   encapsulated,
    carried on the G-ACh, and decapsulated for delivery to\n   management or signaling/routing
    control plane components on a label\n   switching router (LSR).\n   Section 7
    of ITU-T G.7712/Y.1703 [6] describes the transport DCN\n   architecture and requirements
    as follows:\n   1) The MPLS-TP MCN MUST support the requirements for:\n      a)
    CCh access functions specified in Section 7.1.1;\n      b) MPLS-TP SCC data-link
    layer termination functions specified in\n         Section 7.1.2.3;\n      c)
    MPLS-TP MCC data-link layer termination functions specified in\n         Section
    7.1.2.4;\n      d) Network layer PDU into CCh data-link frame encapsulation\n
    \        functions specified in Section 7.1.3;\n      e) Network layer PDU forwarding
    (Section 7.1.6), interworking\n         (Section 7.1.7), and encapsulation (Section
    7.1.8) functions,\n         as well as tunneling (Section 7.1.9) and routing (Section\n
    \        7.1.10) functions.\n   As a practical matter, MCN connections will typically
    have addresses.\n   See the section on Identifiers in RFC 5921 [8] for further\n
    \  information.\n   In order to have the MCN operate properly, a number of management\n
    \  functions for the MCN are needed, including:\n   o  Retrieval of DCN network
    parameters to ensure compatible\n      functioning, e.g., packet size, timeouts,
    quality of service,\n      window size, etc.;\n   o  Establishment of message
    routing between DCN nodes;\n   o  Management of DCN network addresses;\n   o  Retrieval
    of operational status of the DCN at a given node;\n   o  Capability to enable/disable
    access by an NE to the DCN.  Note\n      that this is to allow the isolation of
    a malfunctioning NE to keep\n      it from impacting the rest of the network.\n"

  - "5.  Fault Management Requirements\n   The Fault Management functions within an
    MPLS-TP NE enable the\n   supervision, detection, validation, isolation, correction,
    and\n   reporting of abnormal operation of the MPLS-TP network and its\n   environment.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Supervision Function\n   The supervision function analyzes the actual
      occurrence of a\n   disturbance or fault for the purpose of providing an appropriate\n
      \  indication of performance and/or detected fault condition to\n   maintenance
      personnel and operations systems.\n   1) The MPLS-TP NE MUST support supervision
      of the OAM mechanisms that\n      are deployed for supporting the OAM requirements
      defined in RFC\n      5860 [3].\n   2) The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the following
      data-plane forwarding\n      path supervision functions:\n      a) Supervision
      of loop-checking functions used to detect loops in\n         the data-plane
      forwarding path (which result in non-delivery of\n         traffic, wasting
      of forwarding resources, and unintended self-\n         replication of traffic);\n
      \     b) Supervision of failure detection;\n   3) The MPLS-TP NE MUST support
      the capability to configure data-plane\n      forwarding path related supervision
      mechanisms to perform\n      on-demand or proactively.\n   4) The MPLS-TP NE
      MUST support supervision for software processing --\n      e.g., processing
      faults, storage capacity, version mismatch,\n      corrupted data, and out of
      memory problems, etc.\n   5) The MPLS-TP NE MUST support hardware-related supervision
      for\n      interchangeable and non-interchangeable unit, cable, and power\n
      \     problems.\n   6) The MPLS-TP NE SHOULD support environment-related supervision
      for\n      temperature, humidity, etc.\n"
    title: 5.1.  Supervision Function
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Validation Function\n   Validation is the process of integrating Fault
      Cause indications into\n   Failures.  A Fault Cause Indication (FCI) indicates
      a limited\n   interruption of the required transport function.  A Fault Cause
      is\n   not reported to maintenance personnel because it might exist only for\n
      \  a very short period of time.  Note that some of these events are\n   summed
      up in the Performance Monitoring process (see Section 7), and\n   when this
      sum exceeds a configured value, a threshold crossing alert\n   (report) can
      be generated.\n   When the Fault Cause lasts long enough, an inability to perform
      the\n   required transport function arises.  This failure condition is\n   subject
      to reporting to maintenance personnel and/or an OS because\n   corrective action
      might be required.  Conversely, when the Fault\n   Cause ceases after a certain
      time, clearing of the Failure condition\n   is also subject to reporting.\n
      \  1) The MPLS-TP NE MUST perform persistency checks on fault causes\n      before
      it declares a fault cause a failure.\n   2) The MPLS-TP NE SHOULD provide a
      configuration capability for\n      control parameters associated with performing
      the persistency\n      checks described above.\n   3) An MPLS-TP NE MAY provide
      configuration parameters to control\n      reporting and clearing of failure
      conditions.\n   4) A data-plane forwarding path failure MUST be declared if
      the fault\n      cause persists continuously for a configurable time (Time-D).
      \ The\n      failure MUST be cleared if the fault cause is absent continuously\n
      \     for a configurable time (Time-C).\n   Note: As an example, the default
      time values might be as follows:\n      Time-D = 2.5 +/- 0.5 seconds\n      Time-C
      = 10 +/- 0.5 seconds\n   These time values are as defined in G.7710 [1].\n   5)
      MIBs - or other object management semantics specifications -\n      defined
      to enable configuration of these timers SHOULD explicitly\n      provide default
      values and MAY provide guidelines on ranges and\n      value determination methods
      for scenarios where the default value\n      chosen might be inadequate.  In
      addition, such specifications\n      SHOULD define the level of granularity
      at which tables of these\n      values are to be defined.\n   6) Implementations
      MUST provide the ability to configure the\n      preceding set of timers and
      SHOULD provide default values to\n      enable rapid configuration.  Suitable
      default values, timer\n      ranges, and level of granularity are out of scope
      in this document\n      and form part of the specification of fault management
      details.\n      Timers SHOULD be configurable per NE for broad categories (for\n
      \     example, defects and/or fault causes), and MAY be configurable\n      per-interface
      on an NE and/or per individual defect/fault cause.\n   7) The failure declaration
      and clearing MUST be time stamped.  The\n      time-stamp MUST indicate the
      time at which the fault cause is\n      activated at the input of the fault
      cause persistency (i.e.,\n      defect-to-failure integration) function, and
      the time at which the\n      fault cause is deactivated at the input of the
      fault cause\n      persistency function.\n"

        is concerned with automatic alarming by means of\n   audible and visual indicators

      to determine when an MPLS-TP-based transport\n      service is available and
      when it is unavailable.\n   From a performance perspective, a service is unavailable
      if there is\n   an indication that performance has degraded to the extent that
      a\n   configurable performance threshold has been crossed and the\n   degradation
      persists long enough (i.e., the indication persists for\n   some amount of time,
      which is either configurable or well-known) to\n   be certain it is not a measurement
      anomaly.\n   Methods, mechanisms, and algorithms for exactly how unavailability

      result of this determination MUST be\n      available via the MPLS-TP NE (at

      to the\n      availability-state of services.\n   Transport network unavailability
      is based on Severely Errored Seconds\n   (SES) and Unavailable Seconds (UAS).
      \ The ITU-T is establishing\n   definitions of unavailability that are generically
      applicable to\n   packet transport technologies, including MPLS-TP, based on

    packets of the management protocols.\n      For example, in MPLS-TP, a single-hop
    LSP might be established\n      between two adjacent nodes, and that LSP might
    be capable of\n      carrying IP traffic.  Management traffic can then be inserted
    into\n      the link in an LSP parallel to the LSPs that carry user traffic.\n
    \  This is a \"physically shared out-of-band CCh.\"\n   3. The CCh can be supported
    as its native protocol on the interface\n      alongside the transported traffic.
    \ For example, if an interface\n      is capable of sending and receiving both
    MPLS-TP and IP, the IP-\n      based management traffic can be sent as native
    IP packets on the\n      interface.\n   This is a \"shared interface out-of-band
    CCh\".\n   4. The CCh can use overhead bytes available on a transport\n      connection.
    \ For example, in TDM networks there are overhead bytes\n      associated with
    a data channel, and these can be used to provide a\n      CCh.  It is important
    to note that the use of overhead bytes does\n      not reduce the capacity of
    the associated data channel.\n   This is an \"overhead-based CCh\".\n   This alternative
    is not available in MPLS-TP because there is no\n   overhead available.\n   5.
    The CCh can be provided by a dedicated channel associated with the\n      data
    link.  For example, the generic associated label (GAL) [14]\n      can be used
    to label DCC traffic being exchanged on a data link\n      between adjacent transport
    nodes, potentially in the absence of\n      any data LSP between those nodes.\n
    \  This is a \"data link associated CCh\".\n   It is very similar to case 2, and
    by its nature can only span a\n   single hop in the transport network.\n   6.
    The CCh can be provided by a dedicated channel associated with a\n      data channel.
    \ For example, in MPLS-TP, the GAL [14] can be\n      imposed under the top label
    in the label stack for an MPLS-TP LSP\n      to create a channel associated with
    the LSP that can carry\n      management traffic.  This CCh requires the receiver
    to be capable\n      of demultiplexing management traffic from user traffic carried
    on\n      the same LSP by use of the GAL.\n   This is a \"data channel associated
    CCh\".\n   7. The CCh can be provided by mixing the management traffic with the\n
    \     user traffic such that is indistinguishable on the link without\n      deep-packet
    inspection.  In MPLS-TP, this could arise if there is\n      a data-carrying LSP
    between two nodes, and management traffic is\n      inserted into that LSP.  This
    approach requires that the\n      termination point of the LSP be able to demultiplex
    the management\n      and user traffic.  This might be possible in MPLS-TP if
    the MPLS-\n      TP LSP is carrying IP user traffic.\n   This is an \"in-band
    CCh\".\n   These realizations can be categorized as:\n      A. Out-of-fiber, out-of-band
    (types 1 and 2)\n      B. In-fiber, out-of-band (types 2, 3, 4, and 5)\n      C.
    In-band (types 6 and 7)\n   The MCN and SCN are logically separate networks and
    can be realized\n   by the same DCN or as separate networks.  In practice, that
    means\n   that, between any pair of nodes, the MCC and SCC can be the same link\n
    \  or separate links.\n   It is also important to note that the MCN and SCN do
    not need to be\n   categorised as in-band, out-of-band, etc.  This definition
    only\n   applies to the individual links, and it is possible for some nodes to\n
    \  be connected in the MCN or SCN by one type of link, and other nodes\n   by
    other types of link.  Furthermore, a pair of adjacent nodes can be\n   connected
    by multiple links of different types.\n   Lastly, note that the division of DCN
    traffic between links between a\n   pair of adjacent nodes is purely an implementation
    choice.  Parallel\n   links can be deployed for DCN resilience or load sharing.
    \ Links can\n   be designated for specific use.  For example, so that some links\n
    \  carry management traffic and some carry control plane traffic, or so\n   that
    some links carry signaling protocol traffic while others carry\n   routing protocol
    traffic.\n   It is important to note that the DCN can be a routed network with\n
    \  forwarding capabilities, but that this is not a requirement.  The\n   ability
    to support forwarding of management or control traffic within\n   the DCN can
    substantially simplify the topology of the DCN and\n   improve its resilience,
    but does increase the complexity of operating\n   the DCN.\n   See also RFC 3877
    [11], ITU-T M.20 [12], and Telcordia document\n   GR-833-CORE [13] for further
    information.\n"
