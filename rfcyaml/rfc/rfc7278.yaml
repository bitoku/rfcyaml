  - "1.  Introduction\n   3GPP mobile cellular networks such as Global System for\
    \ Mobile\n   Communications (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System\n\
    \   (UMTS), and Long Term Evolution (LTE) have architectural support for\n   IPv6\
    \ [RFC6459], but only 3GPP Release-10 and onwards of the 3GPP\n   specification\
    \ [TS.23401] supports DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633]\n   for delegating IPv6\
    \ prefixes to a single LAN link.\n   To facilitate the use of IPv6 in a LAN prior\
    \ to the deployment of\n   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in 3GPP networks and in User\
    \ Equipment (UE),\n   this document describes requirements and provides examples\
    \ on how the\n   3GPP UE radio interface assigned global /64 prefix may be extended\n\
    \   from the 3GPP radio interface to a LAN link.\n   There are two scenarios where\
    \ this might be done.  The first is where\n   the 3GPP node sets up and manages\
    \ its own LAN (e.g., an IEEE 802.11\n   Service Set Identifier (SSID)) and provides\
    \ single-homed service to\n   hosts that connect to this LAN.  A second scenario\
    \ is where the 3GPP\n   node connects to an existing LAN and acts as a router\
    \ in order to\n   provide redundant or multi-homed IPv6 service.\n   This document\
    \ is intended to address the first scenario; it is not\n   applicable to the second\
    \ scenario, because the operational\n   complexities of the second scenario are\
    \ not addressed.\n   This can be achieved by receiving the Router Advertisement\
    \ (RA)\n   [RFC4861] announced globally unique /64 IPv6 prefix from the 3GPP\n\
    \   radio interface by the UE and then advertising the same IPv6 prefix\n   to\
    \ the LAN link with RA.  For all of the cases in the scope of this\n   document,\
    \ the UE may be any device that functions as an IPv6 router\n   between the 3GPP\
    \ network and a LAN.\n   This document describes requirements for achieving an\
    \ IPv6 prefix\n   extension from a 3GPP radio interface to a LAN link including\
    \ two\n   practical implementation examples:\n   1) The 3GPP UE only has a global-scope\
    \ address on the LAN link.\n   2) The 3GPP UE maintains the same consistent 128-bit\
    \ global-scope\n      IPv6 anycast address [RFC4291] on the 3GPP radio interface\
    \ and the\n      LAN link.  The LAN link is configured as a /64 and the 3GPP radio\n\
    \      interface is configured as a /128.\n   Section 4 describes the characteristics\
    \ of each of the two example\n   approaches.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  The Challenge of Providing IPv6 Addresses to a LAN Link via a\n    3GPP UE\n\
    \   As described in [RFC6459], 3GPP networks assign a /64 global-scope\n   prefix\
    \ to each UE using RA.  DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation is an optional\n   part of 3GPP\
    \ Release-10 and is not covered by any earlier releases.\n   Neighbor Discovery\
    \ Proxy (ND Proxy) [RFC4389] functionality has been\n   suggested as an option\
    \ for extending the assigned /64 from the 3GPP\n   radio interface to the LAN\
    \ link, but ND Proxy is an Experimental\n   protocol and has some limitations\
    \ with loop avoidance.\n   DHCPv6 is the best way to delegate a prefix to a LAN\
    \ link.  The\n   methods described in this document SHOULD only be applied when\n\
    \   deploying DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation is not achievable in the 3GPP\n   network\
    \ and the UE.  The methods described in this document are at\n   various stages\
    \ of implementation and deployment planning.  The goal\n   of this memo is to\

- title: 4.1.  General Behavior for All Example Scenarios
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Behavior for All Example Scenarios\n    As [RFC6459] describes,\
    \ the 3GPP-network-assigned /64 is completely\n    dedicated to the UE and the\
    \ gateway does not consume any of the /64\n    addresses.  The gateway routes\
    \ the entire /64 to the UE and does not\n    perform ND or Neighbor Unreachability\
    \ Detection (NUD) [RFC4861].\n    Communication between the UE and the gateway\
    \ is only done using\n    link-local addresses and the link is point-to-point.\
    \  This allows\n    for the UE to reliably manipulate the /64 from the 3GPP radio\n\
    \    interface without negatively impacting the point-to-point 3GPP radio\n  \
    \  link interface.  The LAN link RA configuration must be tightly\n    coupled\
    \ with the 3GPP link state.  If the 3GPP link goes down or\n    changes the IPv6\
    \ prefix, that state should be reflected in the LAN\n    link IPv6 configuration.\
    \  Just as in a standard IPv6 router, the\n    packet TTL will be decremented\
    \ when passing packets between IPv6\n    links across the UE.  The UE is employing\
    \ the weak host model\n    [RFC1122].  The RA function on the UE is exclusively\
    \ run on the LAN\n    link.\n    The LAN-link-originated RA message carries a\
    \ copy of the following\n    3GPP radio-link-received RA message option fields:\n\
    \   o  MTU (if not provided by the 3GPP network, the UE will provide its\n   \
    \   3GPP link MTU size)\n   o  Prefix Information\n"
- title: '4.2.  Example Scenario 1: Global Address Only Assigned to LAN Link'
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Example Scenario 1: Global Address Only Assigned to LAN Link\n   For this\
    \ case, the UE receives the RA from the 3GPP network but does\n   not use a global\
    \ address on the 3GPP interface.  The 3GPP-interface-\n   received RA /64 prefix\
    \ information is used to configure the Neighbor\n   Discovery Protocol (NDP) on\
    \ the LAN.  The UE assigns itself an IPv6\n   address on the LAN link from the\
    \ 3GPP-interface-received RA.  The LAN\n   link uses RA to announce the prefix\
    \ to the LAN.  The UE LAN link\n   interface defends its LAN IPv6 address with\
    \ DAD.  The UE shall not\n   run SLAAC to assign a global address on the 3GPP\
    \ radio interface\n   while routing is enabled.\n   This method allows the UE\
    \ to originate and terminate IPv6\n   communications as a host while acting as\
    \ an IPv6 router.  The\n   movement of the IPv6 prefix from the 3GPP radio interface\
    \ to the LAN\n   link may result in long-lived data connections being terminated\n\
    \   during the transition from a host-only mode to router-and-host mode.\n   Connections\
    \ that are likely to be affected are ones that have been\n   specifically bound\
    \ to the 3GPP radio interface.  This method is\n   appropriate if the UE or software\
    \ on the UE cannot support multiple\n   interfaces with the same anycast IPv6\
    \ address and the UE requires\n   global connectivity while acting as a router.\n\
    \   Below is the general procedure for this scenario:\n   1.  The user activates\
    \ router functionality for a LAN on the UE.\n   2.  The UE checks to make sure\
    \ the 3GPP interface is active and has\n       an IPv6 address.  If the interface\
    \ does not have an IPv6 address,\n       an attempt will be made to acquire one;\
    \ otherwise, the procedure\n       will terminate.\n   3.  In this example, the\
    \ UE finds the 3GPP interface is active and\n       has the IPv6 address 2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567:0:9\
    \ assigned.\n   4.  The UE moves the address 2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567:0:9\
    \ as a\n       /64 from the 3GPP interfaces to the LAN link interface, disables\n\
    \       the IPv6 SLAAC feature on the 3GPP radio interface to avoid\n       address\
    \ autoconfiguration, and begins announcing the prefix\n       2001:db8:ac10:f002::/64\
    \ via RA to the LAN.  For this example, the\n       LAN has 2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567:0:9/64\
    \ and the 3GPP radio\n       only has a link-local address.\n   5.  The UE directly\
    \ processes all packets destined to itself at\n       2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567:0:9.\n\
    \   6.  The UE, acting as a router running NDP on the LAN, will route\n      \
    \ packets to and from the LAN.  IPv6 packets passing between\n       interfaces\
    \ will have the TTL decremented.\n   7.  On the LAN link interface, there is no\
    \ chance of address conflict\n       since the address is defended using DAD.\
    \  The 3GPP radio\n       interface only has a link-local address.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.  Example Scenario 2: A Single Global Address Assigned to a\n      3GPP Radio\
    \ and LAN Link\n   In this method, the UE assigns itself one address from the\
    \ 3GPP-\n   network RA-announced /64.  This one address is configured as anycast\n\
    \   [RFC4291] on both the 3GPP radio link as a /128 and on the LAN link\n   as\
    \ a /64.  This allows the UE to maintain long-lived data connections\n   since\
    \ the 3GPP radio interface address does not change when the\n   router function\
    \ is activated.  This method may cause complications\n   for certain software\
    \ that may not support multiple interfaces with\n   the same anycast IPv6 address,\
    \ or are sensitive to prefix length\n   changes.  This method also creates complications\
    \ for ensuring\n   uniqueness for Privacy Extensions [RFC4941].  When Privacy\
    \ Extensions\n   are in use, all temporary addresses will be copied from the 3GPP\n\
    \   radio interface to the LAN link.  The preferred and valid lifetimes\n   will\
    \ be synchronized, such that the temporary anycast addresses on\n   both interfaces\
    \ expire simultaneously.\n   There might also be more complex scenarios in which\
    \ the prefix length\n   is not changed and privacy extensions are supported by\
    \ having the\n   subnet span multiple interfaces, as ND Proxy does [RFC4389].\
    \  Further\n   elaboration is out of scope of the present document.\n   Below\
    \ is the general procedure for this scenario:\n   1.  The user activates router\
    \ functionality for a LAN on the UE.\n   2.  The UE checks to make sure the 3GPP\
    \ interface is active and has\n       an IPv6 address.  If the interface does\
    \ not have an IPv6 address,\n       an attempt will be made to acquire one; otherwise,\
    \ the procedure\n       will terminate.\n   3.  In this example, the UE finds\
    \ the 3GPP interface is active and\n       has the IPv6 address 2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567:0:9\
    \ assigned.\n   4.  The UE moves the address 2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567:0:9\
    \ as an\n       anycast /64 from the 3GPP interface to the LAN interface and\n\
    \       begins announcing the prefix 2001:db8:ac10:f002::/64 via RA to\n     \
    \  the LAN.  The 3GPP interface maintains the same IPv6 anycast\n       address\
    \ with a /128.  For this example, the LAN has\n       2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567:0:9/64\
    \ and the 3GPP radio interface\n       has 2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567:0:9/128.\n\
    \   5.  The UE directly processes all packets destined to itself at\n       2001:db8:ac10:f002:1234:4567:0:9.\n\
    \   6.  On the LAN interface, there is no chance of address conflict\n       since\
    \ the address is defended using DAD.  The 3GPP radio\n       interface only has\
    \ a /128 and no other systems on the 3GPP radio\n       point-to-point link may\
    \ use the global /64.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Since the UE will be switched from an IPv6 host\
    \ mode to an IPv6\n   router-and-host mode, basic IPv6 Customer Premises Equipment\
    \ (CPE)\n   security functions [RFC6092] SHOULD be applied.\n   Despite the use\
    \ of temporary IPv6 addresses, the mobile-network-\n   provided /64 prefix is\
    \ common to all the LAN-attached devices\n   potentially concerning privacy. \
    \ An IPv6 prefix provided by a nomadic\n   device (e.g., a smartphone) is not\
