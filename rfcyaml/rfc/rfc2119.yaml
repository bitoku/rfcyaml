  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices\
    \ for the\n   Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\n\
    \   improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify\n\
    \   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often\n   capitalized.\
    \  This document defines these words as they should be\n   interpreted in IETF\
    \ documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines\n   should incorporate this\
    \ phrase near the beginning of their document:\n      The key words \"MUST\",\
    \ \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL\n      NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"\
    SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and\n      \"OPTIONAL\" in this document\
    \ are to be interpreted as described in\n      RFC 2119.\n   Note that the force\
    \ of these words is modified by the requirement\n   level of the document in which\
    \ they are used.\n"
- title: 1. MUST   This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the
  contents:
  - "1. MUST   This word, or the terms \"REQUIRED\" or \"SHALL\", mean that the\n\
    \   definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.\n"
- title: 2. MUST NOT   This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the
  contents:
  - "2. MUST NOT   This phrase, or the phrase \"SHALL NOT\", mean that the\n   definition\
    \ is an absolute prohibition of the specification.\n"
- title: 3. SHOULD   This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there
  contents:
  - "3. SHOULD   This word, or the adjective \"RECOMMENDED\", mean that there\n  \
    \ may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a\n   particular\
    \ item, but the full implications must be understood and\n   carefully weighed\
    \ before choosing a different course.\n"
- title: 4. SHOULD NOT   This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that
  contents:
  - "4. SHOULD NOT   This phrase, or the phrase \"NOT RECOMMENDED\" mean that\n  \
    \ there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the\n   particular\
    \ behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full\n   implications should\
    \ be understood and the case carefully weighed\n   before implementing any behavior\
    \ described with this label.\n"
- title: 5. MAY   This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
  contents:
  - "5. MAY   This word, or the adjective \"OPTIONAL\", mean that an item is\n   truly\
    \ optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a\n   particular\
    \ marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that\n   it enhances the\
    \ product while another vendor may omit the same item.\n   An implementation which\
    \ does not include a particular option MUST be\n   prepared to interoperate with\
    \ another implementation which does\n   include the option, though perhaps with\
    \ reduced functionality. In the\n   same vein an implementation which does include\
    \ a particular option\n   MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation\
    \ which\n   does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the\n\
    \   option provides.)\n"
- title: 6. Guidance in the use of these Imperatives
  contents:
  - "6. Guidance in the use of these Imperatives\n   Imperatives of the type defined\
    \ in this memo must be used with care\n   and sparingly.  In particular, they\
    \ MUST only be used where it is\n   actually required for interoperation or to\
    \ limit behavior which has\n   potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)\
    \  For\n   example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method\n\
    \   on implementors where the method is not required for\n   interoperability.\n"
- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   These terms are frequently used to specify behavior\
    \ with security\n   implications.  The effects on security of not implementing\
    \ a MUST or\n   SHOULD, or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or\
    \ SHOULD\n   NOT be done may be very subtle. Document authors should take the\
    \ time\n   to elaborate the security implications of not following\n   recommendations\
    \ or requirements as most implementors will not have\n   had the benefit of the\
    \ experience and discussion that produced the\n   specification.\n"
- title: 8. Acknowledgments
  contents:
  - "8. Acknowledgments\n   The definitions of these terms are an amalgam of definitions\
    \ taken\n   from a number of RFCs.  In addition, suggestions have been\n   incorporated\
    \ from a number of people including Robert Ullmann, Thomas\n   Narten, Neal McBurnett,\
    \ and Robert Elz.\n"
