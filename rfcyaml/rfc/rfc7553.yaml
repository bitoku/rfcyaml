- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document explains the use of the Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) for\n   the storage of URIs [RFC3986] and how to resolve hostnames to\
    \ such\n   URIs that can be used by various applications using the URI resource\n\
    \   record type.  For resolution, the application needs to know both the\n   hostname\
    \ and the protocol that the URI is to be used for.  The\n   protocol is registered\
    \ by IANA.\n   Historically, uses of the DNS to map a domain name to a URL have\n\
    \   relied on the Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) RRTYPEs [RFC2915] and\n   then\
    \ on the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) [RFC3401]\n   application\
    \ framework with the DNS as a database as specified in RFC\n   3404 [RFC3404].\
    \  This has a number of implications such as the fact\n   the RRSet returned will\
    \ contain all URIs \"connected\" with the owner,\n   and not only the ones related\
    \ to a specific service.\n   The URI resource record specified in this document\
    \ enables the\n   querying party to do the equivalent of selecting which of the\
    \ NAPTR\n   records one is interested in and have only those returned.  This is\n\
    \   possible because data in the service field of the NAPTR record is\n   included\
    \ in the owner part of the URI resource record type.  It is\n   also the case\
    \ that as the URI resource record type includes the\n   target URI directly as\
    \ part of the RDATA, it is very easy to extract\n   the correct target URI, instead\
    \ of applying rewrite rules as in\n   NAPTR.\n   Querying for URI resource records\
    \ is not replacing querying for NAPTR\n   resource records (or use of S-NAPTR\
    \ [RFC3958]).  Instead, the URI\n   resource record type provides a complementary\
    \ mechanism to be used\n   when one already knows what service field is interesting.\
    \  With it,\n   one can directly query for the specific subset of the otherwise\n\
    \   possibly large RRSet returned when querying for NAPTR resource\n   records.\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n \
    \  [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Applicability Statement\n   In general, it is expected that URI records will\
    \ be used by clients\n   for applications where the relevant protocol to be used\
    \ is known,\n   but, for example, an extra abstraction is needed in order to separate\n\
    \   a domain name from a point of service (as addressed by the URI).  One\n  \
    \ example of such a situation is when an organization has many domain\n   names\
    \ but only one official web page.\n   Applications need to know the specific service\
    \ to prepend the\n   hostname with.  Using repetitive queries for URI records\
    \ is not a\n   replacement for querying for NAPTR records according to the NAPTR\n\
    \   (DDDS) or S-NAPTR algorithms.  NAPTR records serve the purpose of\n   discovering\
    \ the various services or the URIs (for looking up access\n   points for a given\
    \ service).  These are two very different kinds of\n   needs.\n"
- title: 3.  DNS Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  DNS Considerations\n   Using prefix labels, such as underscored service tags,\
    \ for a specific\n   owner name may cause a counter-intuitive effect when the\
    \ owner name\n   is a wildcard name.  For example, _s2._s1.*.example.net is not\
    \ a\n   wildcard name and cannot be used to return a synthesized answer for a\n\
    \   query name of _s2._s1.a.example.net.  See Section 4.5 of RFC 4592\n   [RFC4592]\
    \ for more details.  Besides, underscored service tags used\n   for the URI RR\
    \ (based on the \"Service Name and Transport Protocol\n   Port Number Registry\"\
    ) may have slightly different semantics than\n   service tags used for underscored\
    \ prefix labels that are used in\n   combination with other (yet unspecified)\
    \ RR types.  This may cause\n   subtle management problems when delegation structure\
    \ that has\n   developed within the context of URI RRs is also to be used for\
    \ other\n   RR types.  Because the service labels might be overloaded,\n   applications\
    \ should carefully check that the application-level\n   protocol is indeed the\
    \ protocol they expect.\n   Subtle management issues may also arise when the delegations\
    \ from\n   service to sub-service labels involve several parties and different\n\
    \   stakeholders.\n"
- title: 4.  The Format of the URI RR
  contents:
  - "4.  The Format of the URI RR\n   This is the presentation format of the URI RR:\n\
    \      Owner name TTL Class URI Priority Weight Target\n   The URI RR does not\
    \ cause any kind of Additional Section processing.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Owner Name, Class, and Type
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Owner Name, Class, and Type\n   The URI owner name is subject to special\
    \ conventions.\n   Just like the SRV RR [RFC2782], the URI RR has service information\n\
    \   encoded in its owner name.  In order to encode the service for a\n   specific\
    \ owner name, one uses service parameters.  Valid service\n   parameters are those\
    \ registered by IANA in the \"Service Name and\n   Transport Protocol Port Number\
    \ Registry\" [RFC6335] or as \"Enumservice\n   Registrations [RFC6117].  The Enumservice\
    \ Registration parameters are\n   reversed (i.e., subtype(s) before type), prepended\
    \ with an underscore\n   (_), and prepended to the owner name in separate labels.\
    \  The\n   underscore is prepended to the service parameters to avoid collisions\n\
    \   with DNS labels that occur in nature, and the order is reversed to\n   make\
    \ it possible to do delegations, if needed, to different zones\n   (and therefore\
    \ providers of DNS).\n   For example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a\
    \ service with\n   ENUM Service Parameter \"A:B:C\" for host example.com.  Then\
    \ we would\n   query for (QNAME,QTYPE)=(\"_C._B._A.example.com\",\"URI\").\n \
    \  As another example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service\n   with\
    \ Service Name \"A\" and Transport Protocol \"B\" for host\n   example.com.  Then\
    \ we would query for\n   (QNAME,QTYPE)=(\"_A._B.example.com\",\"URI\").\n   The\
    \ type number for the URI record is 256.\n   The URI resource record is class\
    \ independent.\n   The URI RR has no special Time-to-Live (TTL) requirements.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Priority
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Priority\n   This field holds the priority of the target URI in this RR.\
    \  Its\n   range is 0-65535.  A client MUST attempt to contact the URI with the\n\
    \   lowest-numbered priority it can reach; URIs with the same priority\n   SHOULD\
    \ be selected according to probabilities defined by the weight\n   field.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Weight
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Weight\n   This field holds the server selection mechanism.  The weight\
    \ field\n   specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority.\n\
    \   Larger weights SHOULD be given a proportionately higher probability\n   of\
    \ being selected.  The range of this number is 0-65535.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Target
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Target\n   This field holds the URI of the target, enclosed in double-quote\n\
    \   characters ('\"'), where the URI is as specified in RFC 3986\n   [RFC3986].\
    \  Resolution of the URI is according to the definitions for\n   the Scheme of\
    \ the URI.\n   Since the URI will not be encoded as a <character-string> (see\n\
    \   Section 3.3 of RFC 1035 [RFC1035]), there is no 255-character size\n   limitation.\n\
    \   The Target MUST NOT be an empty URI (\"\").\n"
- title: 4.5.  URI RDATA Wire Format
  contents:
  - "4.5.  URI RDATA Wire Format\n   The RDATA for a URI RR consists of a 2-octet\
    \ Priority field, a\n   2-octet Weight field, and a variable-length Target field.\n\
    \   Priority and Weight are unsigned integers in network byte order.\n   The remaining\
    \ data in the RDATA contains the Target field.  The\n   Target field contains\
    \ the URI as a sequence of octets (without the\n   enclosing double-quote characters\

    \ and a\n   service so that one can compose the record to look up.  NAPTR records\n\

  - "6.1.  Registration of the URI Resource Record Type\n   After an expert review\
    \ in February 2011 (see Appendix A), IANA\n   allocated RRTYPE 256 for the URI\

    \ and the\n   DNS SRV Service Type registries are also used for the URI resource\n\
    \   record type.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Using the URI resource record together with security\
    \ mechanisms that\n   rely on verification of authentication of hostnames, like\
    \ TLS, makes\n   it important to choose the correct domain name when doing the\n\
    \   comparison and ensure that the change in the hostname to be used is\n   secured\
    \ by DNSSEC so that it can be trusted in a similar way as a\n   redirect in HTTP\
    \ using TLS.\n   If, for example, the URI resource record is not signed with the\
    \ help\n   of DNSSEC and then validated successfully, trusting the non-signed\n\
    \   URI will effectively lead to a downgrade attack.\n   The basic mechanism for\
    \ successful use of URI works as follows:\n   1.   Announce that example.com is\
    \ hosted at example.org (with some\n        URL) in DNS.\n   2.   Secure the URI\
    \ resource record with DNSSEC.  This is best done\n        by doing validation\
    \ in the application doing the lookup, but it\n        could also be done in the\
    \ local recursive resolver or in the\n        trusted recursive resolver also\
    \ doing validation.  All are\n        according to the local trust policy.\n \
    \  3.   Verify the TLS (for example) certificate for the connection to\n     \
    \   example.org matches, i.e., use the hostname in the URI and not\n        the\
    \ hostname used originally when looking up the URI resource\n        record.\n\
    \   4.   If needed, do application-layer authentication, etc., over the\n    \
    \    then encrypted connection.\n   It is also possible that the URI in the resource\
    \ record type has\n   errors in it.  Applications using the URI resource record\
    \ type for\n   resolution should behave similarly as if the user typed (or copied\n\
    \   and pasted) the URI.  At least it must be clear to the user that the\n   error\
    \ is not due to any error from his side.\n   One SHOULD NOT include userinfo (see\
    \ \"User Information\",\n   Section 3.2.1 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986]) in a URI that\
    \ is used in a URI\n   resource record as DNS data must be viewed as publicly\
    \ available\n   information.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  The Original RRTYPE Allocation Request\n   On February 22, 2011\
    \ IANA assigned RRTYPE 256 for the URI resource\n   record based on a request\
    \ that followed the procedure documented in\n   [BCP42] (which was RFC 6195 at\
    \ the time but has since been replaced\n   by RFC 6895).  The DNS RRTYPE PARAMETER\
    \ ALLOCATION form as submitted\n   to IANA at that time is replicated below for\
    \ reference.\n   Note: Although \"ownername\" should be \"owner name\", \"ownername\"\
    \ has\n   been preserved below because it was part of the original request form\n\
    \   submitted to IANA.\n   A.   Submission Date:\n        May 23, 2009\n   B.\
    \   Submission Type:\n        [X] New RRTYPE\n        [ ] Modification to existing\
    \ RRTYPE\n   C.   Contact Information for submitter:\n        Name: Patrik Faltstrom\n\
    \        Email Address: paf@cisco.com\n        International telephone number:\
    \ +46-8-6859131\n        Other contact handles:\n        (Note: This information\
    \ will be publicly posted.)\n   D.   Motivation for the new RRTYPE application?\n\
    \        There is no easy way to get from a domain name to a URI.  Some\n    \
    \    mechanisms exists via use of the NAPTR [RFC3403] resource\n        record.\
    \  That implies quite complicated rules that are\n        simplified via the S-NAPTR\
    \ [RFC3958] specification.  But, the\n        ability to directly look up a URI\
    \ still exists.  This\n        specification uses a prefix based naming mechanism\
    \ originated in\n        the definition of the SRV [RFC2782] resource record,\
    \ and the\n        RDATA is a URI, encoded as one text field.\n        See also\
    \ above (Section 1).\n   E.   Description of the proposed RR type.\n        The\
    \ format of the URI resource record is as follows:\n        Ownername TTL Class\
    \ URI Priority Weight Target\n        The URI RR has service information encoded\
    \ in its ownername.  In\n        order to encode the service for a specific ownername\
    \ one uses\n        service parameters.  Valid service parameters used are either\n\
    \        Enumservice Registrations registered by IANA, or prefixes used\n    \
    \    for the SRV resource record.\n        The wire format of the RDATA is as\
    \ follows:\n                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\

    \   |          Priority             |          Weight               |\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \      /                                                               /\n   \
    \   /                             Target                            /\n      /\
    \                                                               /\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   F.   What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that\n      \
    \  need and why are they unsatisfactory?\n        The RRTYPE that come closest\
    \ is the NAPTR resource record.  It\n        is for example used in the DDDS and\
    \ S-NAPTR algorithms.  The\n        main problem with the NAPTR is that selection\
    \ of what record (or\n        records) one is interested in is based on data stored\
    \ in the\n        RDATA portion of the NAPTR resource record.  This, as explained\n\
    \        in RFC 5507 [RFC5507], is not optimal for DNS lookups.  Further,\n  \
    \      most applications using NAPTR resource records uses regular\n        expression\
    \ based rewrite rules for creation of the URI, and that\n        has shown be\
    \ complicated to implement.\n        The second closest RRTYPE is the SRV record\
    \ that given a\n        prefixed based naming just like is suggested for the URI\n\
    \        resource record, one get back a port number and domain name.\n      \
    \  This can also be used for creation of a URI, but, only URIs\n        without\
    \ path components.\n   G.   What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?\n\
    \        URI\n   H.   Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA\
    \ Registry\n        or require the creation of a new IANA sub-registry in DNS\n\
    \        Parameters?\n        Yes, partially.\n        One of the mechanisms to\
    \ select a service is to use the\n        Enumservice Registry managed by IANA.\
    \  Another is to use\n        services and protocols used for SRV records.\n \
    \  I.   Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS servers/\n       \
    \ resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed as an\n        unknown\
    \ RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?\n        No\n   J.   Comments:\n        None\n"
