  - "                            NETWORK CHECKOUT\n      As of August 21 we had performed\
    \ the following verifications\nwith the sites listed below.  These verifications\
    \ were done on an\narranged basis and do not indicate any degree of continuous\n\
    availability.\n      In the category \"NCP-107\" the heading is somewhat misleading.\n\
    It does not indicate a thorough checkout of all the NCP functions\ndescribed in\
    \ Document 1 and RFC-107.  It only indicates that the NCP\nin question functioned\
    \ to the extent required to respond to a RESET (a\nnecessary condition for the\
    \ Rand NCP to consider the remote host \"up\")\nand that the NCP performed the\
    \ functions necessary for an ICP.  Thus,\nthis column really indicates only a\
    \ small degree of NCP completeness.\nSuch function as ECHO, Give Back, error message\
    \ generation and so on\nwere not checked.  We have checked some of these functions\
    \ with UCSB\nand SDC but not exhaustively.  This is mainly due to the tedium of\n\
    such a process.  BBN is currently writing a protocol certifier for\ntheir DDP-516\
    \ host that will do this automatically.\n               NCP-107  ICP-156  Telnet\

    SRI NIC -- both a server telnet and logger exist; however, they\n           do\
    \ not process the telnet messages correctly\nMIT Multics  -- we were only able\
    \ to connect to an interim\n          logger that sent a 'ts' message\nSDC  --\
    \ the logger causes the system to crash following login\n      Any discrepancies\
    \ should be noted via phone call.  This\nRFC will be updated in about one month.\n\
