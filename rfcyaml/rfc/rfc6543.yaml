  - "Abstract\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (RFC 5213) requires that all mobile access gateways\n
    \  use a fixed link-local address and a fixed link-layer address on any\n   of
    their access links that they share with mobile nodes.  This\n   requirement was
    intended to ensure that a mobile node does not detect\n   any change with respect
    to its Layer 3 attachment, even after it\n   roams from one mobile access gateway
    to another.  In the absence of\n   any reserved addresses for this use, coordination
    across vendors and\n   manual configuration of these addresses on all of the mobility\n
    \  elements in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain are required.  This document\n   attempts
    to simplify this operational requirement by making a\n   reservation for special
    addresses that can be used for this purpose.\n   This document also updates RFC
    5213.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network-based mobility
    management\n   protocol that enables IP mobility support for a mobile node without\n
    \  requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling.  The\n   mobility
    elements in the network ensure that the mobile node does not\n   detect any change
    with respect to its Layer 3 attachment, even after\n   it roams from one mobile
    access gateway to another and changes its\n   point of attachment in the network.
    \ All mobile access gateways in a\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain use a fixed link-local
    address and a fixed\n   link-layer address on any of their access links that they
    share with\n   the mobile nodes.  This essentially ensures that a mobile node,
    after\n   performing a handoff, does not detect any change with respect to the\n
    \  IP network configuration.\n   Although the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification
    [RFC5213] requires\n   the use of a fixed link-local and a fixed link-layer address,
    it did\n   not reserve any specific addresses for this purpose.  This is proving\n
    \  to be an operational challenge in deployments involving multi-vendor\n   equipment.
    \ To address this problem, this specification makes the\n   following two reservations.\n
    \  1.  This specification reserves one Ethernet unicast address,\n       00-00-5E-00-52-13,
    for use with Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This reserved\n       link-layer address SHOULD
    be used by the mobile access gateway in\n       a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, on
    all of the access links that it\n       shares with the mobile nodes.  The protocol
    configuration\n       variable FixedMAGLinkLayerAddressOnAllAccessLinks [RFC5213]\n
    \      SHOULD be set to this reserved address.  The mobile access\n       gateway
    can use this address in all packet communication with the\n       mobile node
    on the access links.  Considerations from [RFC5342]\n       apply with respect
    to the use of Ethernet parameters in IETF\n       protocols.  This address is
    allocated from the registry \"IANA\n       Ethernet Address Block - Unicast Use\".\n
    \  2.  This specification reserves an IPv6 interface identifier,\n       0200:5EFF:FE00:5213.
    \ This interface identifier is a modified\n       EUI-64 interface identifier
    generated from the allocated Ethernet\n       unicast address 00-00-5E-00-52-13.
    \ This reserved IPv6 interface\n       identifier SHOULD be used by all of the
    mobile access gateways in\n       a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain on all of the access
    links that they\n       share with the mobile nodes.  The protocol configuration
    variable\n       FixedMAGLinkLocalAddressOnAllAccessLinks [RFC5213] SHOULD be
    set\n       to the link-local address generated using this reserved IPv6\n       interface
    identifier.  The mobile access gateway can use this\n       link-local address
    generated using this reserved IPv6 interface\n       identifier in all Neighbor
    Discovery-related [RFC4861]\n       communication with the mobile node.\n"

    address,\n      00-00-5E-00-52-13, for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This address has been\n
    \     reserved in the registry \"IANA Ethernet Address Block - Unicast\n      Use\".\n

    Identifiers\" [RFC5453].  This\n      interface identifier is a modified EUI-64
    interface identifier\n      generated from the allocated Ethernet unicast address\n

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   All of the security considerations specified
    in [RFC5213] and\n   [RFC5844] continue to apply to the mobility elements in a
    Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 domain when those elements conform to this specification.\n
    \  Specifically, the issues related to the use of fixed link-local and\n   link-layer
    addresses as documented in Section 6.9.3 of the base Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 specification
    are equally relevant here.  In some sense,\n   the reservations made in this specification
    result in the use of the\n   same set of link-local and link-layer address values
    beyond a single\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, thereby expanding the scope of the
    existing\n   problem related to asserting ownership of the configured addresses\n
    \  from a single domain to a multi-domain environment.  Future work may\n   be
    needed to address these issues.\n"
