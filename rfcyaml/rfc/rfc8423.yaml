  - "Abstract\n   This document reclassifies the RFCs related to the United States\n\
    \   National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B cryptographic algorithms as\n   Historic,\
    \ and it discusses the reasons for doing so.  This document\n   moves seven Informational\
    \ RFCs to Historic status: RFCs 5759, 6239,\n   6318, 6379, 6380, 6403, and 6460.\
    \  In addition, it moves three\n   obsolete Informational RFCs to Historic status:\
    \ RFCs 4869, 5008, and\n   5430.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Several RFCs profile security protocols for use with the\
    \ National\n   Security Agency (NSA) Suite B Cryptography.  Suite B is no longer\n\
    \   supported by NSA, and the web pages that specify the cryptographic\n   algorithms\
    \ are no longer available.\n   In July 2015, NSA published the Committee for National\
    \ Security\n   Systems Advisory Memorandum 02-15 as the first step in replacing\n\
    \   Suite B with NSA's Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA)\n   Suite.\
    \  Information about the CNSA Suite can be found in [CNSA].\n"
- title: 2.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "2.  Rationale\n   As indicated in [CNSA], NSA is transitioning from Suite B to\
    \ the CNSA\n   Suite.  As a result, the profiles of the security protocols for\
    \ the\n   Suite B algorithms are now only of historic interest.\n"
- title: 3.  The RFCs Related to Suite B
  contents:
  - "3.  The RFCs Related to Suite B\n   Between 2007 and 2012, several Suite-B-related\
    \ RFCs were published to\n   profile security protocols for use with the Suite\
    \ B algorithms.  They\n   are:\n   o  [RFC4869], \"Suite B Cryptographic Suites\
    \ for IPsec\" (Obsoleted by\n      RFC 6379)\n   o  [RFC5008], \"Suite B in Secure/Multipurpose\
    \ Internet Mail\n      Extensions (S/MIME)\" (Obsoleted by RFC 6318)\n   o  [RFC5430],\
    \ \"Suite B Profile for Transport Layer Security (TLS)\"\n      (Obsoleted by\
    \ RFC 6460)\n   o  [RFC5759], \"Suite B Certificate and Certificate Revocation\
    \ List\n      (CRL) Profile\"\n   o  [RFC6239], \"Suite B Cryptographic Suites\
    \ for Secure Shell (SSH)\"\n   o  [RFC6318], \"Suite B in Secure/Multipurpose\
    \ Internet Mail\n      Extensions (S/MIME)\"\n   o  [RFC6379], \"Suite B Cryptographic\
    \ Suites for IPsec\"\n   o  [RFC6380], \"Suite B Profile for Internet Protocol\
    \ Security\n      (IPsec)\"\n   o  [RFC6403], \"Suite B Profile of Certificate\
    \ Management over CMS\"\n   o  [RFC6460], \"Suite B Profile for Transport Layer\
    \ Security (TLS)\"\n"
- title: 4.  Documents That Reference the Suite-B-Related RFCs
  contents:
  - "4.  Documents That Reference the Suite-B-Related RFCs\n   These RFCs reference\
    \ each other several times.  These cross-\n   references are not examined further\
    \ in this document.\n   Other RFCs make reference to these Suite-B-related RFCs;\
    \ these\n   references are discussed in the following subsections.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Documents That Reference RFC 4869
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Documents That Reference RFC 4869\n   One other RFC makes reference to\
    \ RFC 4869 [RFC4869].\n   RFC 6071, \"IP Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange\
    \ (IKE)\n   Document Roadmap\" [RFC6071], points out that RFC 4869 adds four pre-\n\
    \   defined suites based upon Suite B specifications.  They are:\n   o  IKE/ESP\
    \ suite \"Suite-B-GCM-128\"\n   o  IKE/ESP suite \"Suite-B-GCM-256\"\n   o  IKE/AH\
    \ suite \"Suite-B-GMAC-128\"\n   o  IKE/AH suite \"Suite-B-GMAC-256\"\n   In each\
    \ case, these suite definitions make use of algorithms that are\n   defined in\
    \ other RFCs.  No interoperability or security concerns are\n   raised if implementations\
    \ continue to make use of these suite names.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Documents That Reference RFC 5759
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Documents That Reference RFC 5759\n   One other RFC makes reference to\
    \ RFC 5759 [RFC5759].\n   RFC 6187, \"X.509v3 Certificates for Secure Shell Authentication\"\
    \n   [RFC6187], points out that RFC 5759 provides additional guidance for\n  \
    \ Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys when used\n   with Suite\
    \ B.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Documents That Reference RFC 6379
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Documents That Reference RFC 6379\n   One other RFC makes reference to\

    \ and\n   Usage Guidance for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and\n   Authentication\
    \ Header (AH)\" [RFC7321], points out that the AES-GCM\n   algorithm is used by\
    \ Suite B, and it has emerged as the preferred\n   authenticated encryption method\
    \ in IPsec.  RFC 7321 has since been\n   obsoleted by RFC 8221.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Documents That Reference RFC 6403
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Documents That Reference RFC 6403\n   Two other RFCs make reference to\
    \ RFC 6403 [RFC6403].\n   RFC 6402, \"Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) Updates\"\
    \ [RFC6402],\n   says that development of the profile for Suite B was the activity\n\
    \   that demonstrated the need for these updates.\n   RFC 7030, \"Enrollment over\
    \ Secure Transport\" [RFC7030], points out\n   that the scenarios in Appendix\
    \ of RFC 6403 are very similar to three\n   of the scenarios described.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Documents That Reference RFC 6460
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Documents That Reference RFC 6460\n   Three other RFCs make reference to\
    \ RFC 6460 [RFC6460].\n   RFC 6605, \"Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm\
    \ (DSA) for\n   DNSSEC\" [RFC6605], states that material was copied liberally\
    \ from RFC\n   6460.  The Standards Track status of RFC 6605 is not affected by\
    \ RFC\n   6460 moving to Historic status.\n   RFC 7525, \"Recommendations for\
    \ Secure Use of Transport Layer Security\n   (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer\
    \ Security (DTLS)\" [RFC7525],\n   observes that the Suite B profile of TLS 1.2\
    \ uses different\n   ciphersuites.\n   RFC 8253, \"PCEPS: Usage of TLS to Provide\
    \ a Secure Transport for the\n   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol\
    \ (PCEP)\" [RFC8253],\n   points to RFC 6460 for the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\n\
    \   and TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 ciphersuites.  Both of\n   these\
    \ ciphersuites are defined in [RFC5289], which would have been a\n   better reference.\
    \  The Standards Track status of RFC 8253 is not\n   affected by RFC 6460 moving\
    \ to Historic status.\n"
- title: 5.  Impact of Reclassifying the Suite-B-Related RFCs to Historic
  contents:
  - "5.  Impact of Reclassifying the Suite-B-Related RFCs to Historic\n   No interoperability\
    \ or security concerns are raised by reclassifying\n   the Suite-B-related RFCs\
    \ to Historic status.  As described in\n   Section 4, none of the RFCs being moved\
    \ to Historic status is the\n   sole specification of a cryptographic algorithm\
    \ or an identifier for\n   a cryptographic algorithm.\n"
