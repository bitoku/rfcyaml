  - "ABSTRACT\n   This note describes a mechanism whereby authorisation for one node\
    \ to\n   act as key exchanger for a second node is delegated and made\n   available\
    \ via the Secure DNS.  This mechanism is intended to be used\n   only with the\
    \ Secure DNS.  It can be used with several security\n   services.  For example,\
    \ a system seeking to use IP Security [RFC-\n   1825, RFC-1826, RFC-1827] to protect\
    \ IP packets for a given\n   destination can use this mechanism to determine the\
    \ set of authorised\n   remote key exchanger systems for that destination.\n"

  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the standard way that Internet\
    \ nodes\n   locate information about addresses, mail exchangers, and other data\n\
    \   relating to remote Internet nodes. [RFC-1035, RFC-1034] More\n   recently,\
    \ Eastlake and Kaufman have defined standards-track security\n   extensions to\
    \ the DNS. [RFC-2065] These security extensions can be\n   used to authenticate\
    \ signed DNS data records and can also be used to\n   store signed public keys\
    \ in the DNS.\n   The KX record is useful in providing an authenticatible method\
    \ of\n   delegating authorisation for one node to provide key exchange\n   services\
    \ on behalf of one or more, possibly different, nodes.  This\n   note specifies\
    \ the syntax and semantics of the KX record, which is\n   currently in limited\
    \ deployment in certain IP-based networks.  The\n   reader is assumed to be familiar\
    \ with the basics of DNS, including\n   familiarity with [RFC-1035, RFC-1034].\
    \  This document is not on the\n   IETF standards-track and does not specify any\
    \ level of standard.\n   This document merely provides information for the Internet\

- title: 1.1 Identity Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1 Identity Terminology\n   This document relies upon the concept of \"identity\
    \ domination\".  This\n   concept might be new to the reader and so is explained\
    \ in this\n   section.  The subject of endpoint naming for security associations\n\
    \   has historically been somewhat contentious.  This document takes no\n   position\
    \ on what forms of identity should be used.  In a network,\n   there are several\
    \ forms of identity that are possible.\n   For example, IP Security has defined\
    \ notions of identity that\n   include: IP Address, IP Address Range, Connection\
    \ ID, Fully-Qualified\n   Domain Name (FQDN), and User with Fully Qualified Domain\
    \ Name (USER\n   FQDN).\n   A USER FQDN identity dominates a FQDN identity.  A\
    \ FQDN identity in\n   turn dominates an IP Address identity.  Similarly, a Connection\
    \ ID\n   dominates an IP Address identity.  An IP Address Range dominates each\n\
    \   IP Address identity for each IP address within that IP address range.\n  \
    \ Also, for completeness, an IP Address identity is considered to\n   dominate\
    \ itself.\n"
- title: 2. APPROACH
  contents:
  - "2. APPROACH\n   This document specifies a new kind of DNS Resource Record (RR),\
    \ known\n   as the Key Exchanger (KX) record.  A Key Exchanger Record has the\n\
    \   mnemonic \"KX\" and the type code of 36.  Each KX record is associated\n \
    \  with a fully-qualified domain name.  The KX record is modeled on the\n   MX\
    \ record described in [Part86]. Any given domain, subdomain, or host\n   entry\
    \ in the DNS might have a KX record.\n"

  - "2.1 IPsec Examples\n   In these two examples, let S be the originating node and\
    \ let D be the\n   destination node.  S2 is another node on the same subnet as\
    \ S.  D2 is\n   another node on the same subnet as D.  R1 and R2 are IPsec-capable\n\
    \   routers.  The path from S to D goes via first R1 and later R2.  The\n   return\
    \ path from D to S goes via first R2 and later R1.\n   IETF-standard IP Security\
    \ uses unidirectional Security Associations\n   [RFC-1825].  Therefore, a typical\
    \ IP session will use a pair of\n   related Security Associations, one in each\
    \ direction.  The examples\n   below talk about how to setup an example Security\
    \ Association, but in\n   practice a pair of matched Security Associations will\
    \ normally be\n   used.\n"

    \                   +----D2\n       Figure 1:  Network Diagram for Subnet-to-Subnet\
    \ Example\n   In this example, R1 makes the policy decision to provide the IPsec\n\
    \   service for traffic from R1 destined for R2.  Once R1 has decided\n   that\
    \ the packet from S to D should be protected, it performs a secure\n   DNS lookup\
    \ for the records associated with domain D.  If R1 only\n   knows the IP address\
    \ for D, then a secure reverse DNS lookup will be\n   necessary to determine the\
    \ domain D, before that forward secure DNS\n   lookup for records associated with\
    \ domain D.  If these DNS records of\n   domain D include a KX record for the\
    \ IPsec service, then R1 knows\n   which set of nodes are authorised key exchanger\
    \ nodes for the\n   destination D.\n   In this example, let there be at least\
    \ one KX record for D and let\n   the most preferred KX record for D point at\
    \ R2.  R1 then selects a\n   key exchanger (in this example, R2) for D from the\
    \ list obtained from\n   the secure DNS.  Then R1 initiates a key management session\
    \ with that\n   key exchanger (in this example, R2) to setup an IPsec Security\n\
    \   Association between R1 and D.  In this example, R1 knows (either by\n   seeing\
    \ an outbound packet arriving from S destined to D or via other\n   methods) that\
    \ S will be sending traffic to D.  In this example R1's\n   policy requires that\
    \ traffic from S to D should be segregated at\n   least on a host-to-host basis,\
    \ so R1 desires an IPsec Security\n   Association with source identity that dominates\
    \ S, proxy identity\n   that dominates R1, and destination identity that dominates\
    \ R2.\n   In turn, R2 is able to authenticate the delegation of Key Exchanger\n\
    \   authorisation for target S to R1 by making an authenticated forward\n   DNS\
    \ lookup for KX records associated with S and verifying that at\n   least one\
    \ such record points to R1.  The identity S is typically\n   given to R2 as part\
    \ of the key management process between R1 and R2.\n   If D initially only knows\
    \ the IP address of S, then it will need to\n   perform a secure reverse DNS lookup\
    \ to obtain the fully-qualified\n   domain name for S prior to that secure forward\
    \ DNS lookup.\n   If R2 does not receive an authenticated DNS response indicating\
    \ that\n   R1 is an authorised key exchanger for S, then D will not accept the\n\
    \   SA negotiation from R1 on behalf of identity S.\n   If the proposed IPsec\
    \ Security Association is acceptable to both R1\n   and R2, each of which might\
    \ have separate policies, then they create\n   that IPsec Security Association\
    \ via Key Management.\n   Note that for unicast traffic, Key Management will typically\
    \ also\n   setup a separate (but related) IPsec Security Association for the\n\
    \   return traffic.  That return IPsec Security Association will have\n   equivalent\
    \ identities.  In this example, that return IPsec Security\n   Association will\
    \ have a source identity that dominates D, a proxy\n   identity that dominates\
    \ R2, and a destination identity that dominates\n   R1.\n   Once the IPsec Security\
    \ Association has been created, then R1 uses it\n   to protect traffic from S\
    \ destined for D via a secure tunnel that\n   originates at R1 and terminates\
    \ at R2.  For the case of unicast, R2\n   will use the return IPsec Security Association\
    \ to protect traffic\n   from D destined for S via a secure tunnel that originates\
    \ at R2 and\n   terminates at R1.\n"

    \ Example\n   In this example, R1 makes the policy decision that IP Security is\n\
    \   needed for the packet travelling from S to D.  Then, R1 performs the\n   secure\
    \ DNS lookup for D and determines that D is its own key\n   exchanger, either\
    \ from the existence of a KX record for D pointing to\n   D or from an authenticated\
    \ DNS response indicating that no KX record\n   exists for D.  If R1 does not\
    \ initially know the domain name of D,\n   then prior to the above forward secure\
    \ DNS lookup, R1 performs a\n   secure reverse DNS lookup on the IP address of\
    \ D to determine the\n   fully-qualified domain name for that IP address.  R1\
    \ then initiates\n   key management with D to create an IPsec Security Association\
    \ on\n   behalf of S.\n   In turn, D can verify that R1 is authorised to create\
    \ an IPsec\n   Security Association on behalf of S by performing a DNS KX record\n\
    \   lookup for target S.  R1 usually provides identity S to D via key\n   management.\
    \  If D only has the IP address of S, then D will need to\n   perform a secure\
    \ reverse lookup on the IP address of S to determine\n   domain name S prior to\
    \ the secure forward DNS lookup on S to locate\n   the KX records for S.\n   If\
    \ D does not receive an authenticated DNS response indicating that\n   R1 is an\
    \ authorised key exchanger for S, then D will not accept the\n   SA negotiation\
    \ from R1 on behalf of identity S.\n   If the IPsec Security Association is successfully\
    \ established between\n   R1 and D, that IPsec Security Association has a source\
    \ identity that\n   dominates S's IP address, a proxy identity that dominates\
    \ R1's IP\n   address, and a destination identity that dominates D's IP address.\n\
    \   Finally, R1 begins providing the security service for packets from S\n   that\
    \ transit R1 destined for D.  When D receives such packets, D\n   examines the\
    \ SA information during IPsec input processing and sees\n   that R1's address\
    \ is listed as valid proxy address for that SA and\n   that S is the source address\
    \ for that SA.  Hence, D knows at input\n   processing time that R1 is authorised\
    \ to provide security on behalf\n   of S.  Therefore packets coming from R1 with\
    \ valid IP security that\n   claim to be from S are trusted by D to have really\
    \ come from S.\n"

    \ Example\n   In this example, D makes the policy decision that IP Security is\n\
    \   needed for the packets from D to S.  Then D performs the secure DNS\n   lookup\
    \ for S and discovers that a KX record for S exists and points\n   at R1.  If\

    \  D then initiates key management with R1, where R1 is acting on behalf\n   of\

    \   performs IPsec for itself, no proxy identity is needed in this IPsec\n   Security\
    \ Association.  If the proxy identity is non-null in this\n   situation, then\
    \ the proxy identity must dominate D's IP Address.\n   Finally, D sends secured\
    \ IP packets to R1.  R1 receives those\n   packets, provides IPsec input processing\
    \ (including appropriate\n   inner/outer IP address validation), and forwards\
    \ valid packets along\n   to S.\n"

    \ such as Kerberos [KN93], and a possible use of KX records in\n   conjunction\
    \ with mobile nodes accessing the network via a dialup\n   service.\n"
- title: 2.2.1 KDC Examples
  contents:
  - "2.2.1 KDC Examples\n   This example considers the situation of a destination\
    \ node\n   implementing IPsec that can only obtain its Security Association\n\
    \   information from a Key Distribution Center (KDC).  Let the KDC\n   implement\
    \ both the KDC protocol and also a non-KDC key management\n   protocol (e.g. ISAKMP).\
    \  In such a case, each client node of the KDC\n   might have its own KX record\
    \ pointing at the KDC so that nodes not\n   implementing the KDC protocol can\
    \ still create Security Associations\n   with each of the client nodes of the\
    \ KDC.\n   In the event the session initiator were not using the KDC but the\n\
    \   session target was an IPsec node that only used the KDC, the\n   initiator\
    \ would find the KX record for the target pointing at the\n   KDC.  Then, the\
    \ external key management exchange (e.g. ISAKMP) would\n   be between the initiator\
    \ and the KDC.  Then the KDC would distribute\n   the IPsec SA to the KDC-only\
    \ IPsec node using the KDC.  The IPsec\n   traffic itself could travel directly\
    \ between the initiator and the\n   destination node.\n   In the event the initiator\
    \ node could only use the KDC and the target\n   were not using the KDC, the initiator\
    \ would send its request for a\n   key to the KDC.  The KDC would then initiate\
    \ an external key\n   management exchange (e.g. ISAKMP) with a node that the target's\
    \ KX\n   record(s) pointed to, on behalf of the initiator node.\n   The target\
    \ node could verify that the KDC were allowed to proxy for\n   the initiator node\
    \ by looking up the KX records for the initiator\n   node and finding a KX record\
    \ for the initiator that listed the KDC.\n   Then the external key exchange would\
    \ be performed between the KDC and\n   the target node.  Then the KDC would distribute\
    \ the resulting IPsec\n   Security Association to the initiator.  Again, IPsec\
    \ traffic itself\n   could travel directly between the initiator and the destination.\n"
- title: 2.2.2 Dial-Up Host Example
  contents:
  - "2.2.2 Dial-Up Host Example\n   This example outlines a possible use of KX records\
    \ with mobile hosts\n   that dial into the network via PPP and are dynamically\
    \ assigned an IP\n   address and domain-name at dial-in time.\n   Consider the\
    \ situation where each mobile node is dynamically assigned\n   both a domain name\
    \ and an IP address at the time that node dials into\n   the network.  Let the\
    \ policy require that each mobile node act as its\n   own Key Exchanger.  In this\
    \ case, it is important that dial-in nodes\n   use addresses from one or more\
    \ well known IP subnets or address pools\n   dedicated to dial-in access.  If\
    \ that is true, then no KX record or\n   other action is needed to ensure that\
    \ each node will act as its own\n   Key Exchanger because lack of a KX record\
    \ indicates that the node is\n   its own Key Exchanger.\n   Consider the situation\
    \ where the mobile node's domain name remains\n   constant but its IP address\
    \ changes.  Let the policy require that\n   each mobile node act as its own Key\
    \ Exchanger.  In this case, there\n   might be operational problems when another\
    \ node attempts to perform a\n   secure reverse DNS lookup on the IP address to\

    \ (in the\n   form of a PTR record) between the mobile node's currently assigned\

    \ each time the node is assigned a new IP address.  There are\n   no mechanisms\
    \ for accomplishing this that are both IETF-standard and\n   widely deployed as\
    \ of the time this note was written.  Use of Dynamic\n   DNS Update without authentication\

    \ KX\n   records MUST be ignored because of the security vulnerability caused\n\

    \ those dynamic DNS updates MUST be\n   fully authenticated to prevent an adversary\

    \ into the Domain Name\n   System.  If false records were inserted into the DNS\
