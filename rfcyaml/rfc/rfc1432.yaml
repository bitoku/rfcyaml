- title: 1.  Which Books
  contents:
  - "1.  Which Books\n   Here is a list of books related to using the Internet, which\
    \ is the\n   global and exponentially growing network of more than a million\n\
    \   computers that communicate by interactive use of the TCP/IP\n   protocols,\
    \ for the use of millions of users.  This article was\n   prompted by the recent\
    \ publication of nine or ten books on the\n   Internet in the space of a year\
    \ (some are so new they aren't even\n   published yet).  I have also included\
    \ some books that have been\n   around for quite a long time (as long ago as the\
    \ dim past of 1984).\n   I think all of them contain useful information for people\
    \ new to the\n   Internet.\n   Some of the books included here are about more\
    \ than the Internet.\n   Some of them are about the Matrix, which is the set of\
    \ all computer\n   networks worldwide that exchange electronic mail.  The Matrix\n\
    \   includes FidoNet, UUCP, BITNET, USENET, the Internet, and many\n   others,\
    \ but is not limited to any one of those networks.  This\n   particular bibliographic\
    \ collection is oriented around the largest\n   computer network in the world,\
    \ the Internet, because of all the\n   recent books about that network.  Matrix\
    \ News continues to publish\n   information about the Matrix, including but not\
    \ limited to the\n   Internet.\n   Author          Pp. Price  Audience       Type\

    \                     Table 1. Network Books Summarized\n   I have excluded from\
    \ this article books that are solely about\n   technical aspects of technology,\
    \ such as the TCP/IP protocols.\n   Instead, I have included books about the resources\
    \ and users of the\n   Internet.  I have grouped them in rough classifications\
    \ for\n   convenience of presentation.  Several of these books fit several\n \
    \  classifications.  For that reason and others, the classifications\n   should\
    \ be taken as illustrative, not definitive.  Table 1 summarizes\n   some features\
    \ of all the books described.\n   Thanks to various people for input; especially\
    \ David Bridge.  Much of\n   the detailed bibliographic information came from\
    \ the Library of\n   Congress catalog server supported by Digital Research Associates,\n\
    \   Inc., accessed via gopher and Telnet over the Internet.\n   Please note that\
    \ prices may change, as may electronic mail addresses,\n   telephone and fax numbers,\
    \ and postal addresses.  The price you pay,\n   in particular, may be less because\
    \ of a discount, or more because of\n   shipping, or because you buy the book\
    \ outside of the United States.\n   The information included here is accurate\
    \ to the best of my\n   knowledge, but your mileage may vary.  Use at your own\
    \ risk.  But\n   please do report errors, changes, and additions to mids@tic.com.\n\
    \   Some bibliographic citations end in a line of the form\n                 \
    \ domain.name:path/name\n   This means you can retrieve further information by\
    \ connecting to\n   domain.name with FTP, logging in as user anonymous, using\
    \ your\n   electronic mail address as a password, and changing to path/name as\
    \ a\n   directory, or retrieving it as a file, whichever works.\n   Some citations\
