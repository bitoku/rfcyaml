- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Globus (https://www.globus.org) is a software-as-a-service\
    \ provider\n   that develops and operates services and tools for the global research\n\
    \   and education community.\n   Globus provides multiple services for users across\
    \ many institutions,\n   primarily for research driven by high-performance computing.\
    \  Globus\n   creates unique identifiers that will persist in external systems\
    \ and\n   must be identifiable as references to Globus entities.\n   To address\
    \ this need, this document requests that a formal URN space\n   type be assigned\
    \ as described in Section 4.3 of [RFC3406].\n"
- title: 2.  Specification Template
  contents:
  - "2.  Specification Template\n   Namespace ID:\n      globus\n   Registration Information:\n\
    \      Version 1\n      Date: 2016-03-18\n   Declared Registrant of the Namespace:\n\
    \      Globus Project Lead\n      401 N Michigan Ave\n      Suite 900\n      Chicago,\
    \ Illinois  60611\n      USA\n      Email:  tuecke@globus.org\n      The position\
    \ of Globus Project Lead is currently filled by Steve\n      Tuecke.\n   Declaration\
    \ of Syntactic Structure:\n      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs\
    \ that use the\n      \"globus\" NID shall have the following structure:\n   \
    \   <URN> ::= \"urn:\" \"globus\" \":\" <NSS>\n      <NSS> ::= <SNID> | <SNID>\
    \ \":\" <subnamespace-specific-string>\n      <SNID> ::= 1*<non-colon-chars>\n\
    \      <subnamespace-specific-string> ::= 1*<URN chars>\n      <non-colon-chars>\
    \ ::= <non-colon-trans> | \"%\" <hex> <hex>\n      <non-colon-trans> ::= <upper>\
    \ | <lower> | <number> |\n                            <non-colon-other>\n    \
    \  <non-colon-other> ::= \"(\" | \")\" | \"+\" | \",\" | \"-\" | \".\" | \"=\"\
    \ |\n                            \"@\" | \";\" | \"$\" | \"_\" | \"!\" | \"*\"\
    \ | \"'\"\n      The \"SNID\" is the top-level segment of the NSS.  It is a required\n\
    \      US-ASCII string, subject to the above syntax, that conforms to the\n  \
    \    URN syntax requirements (see [RFC2141]).  It identifies a category\n    \
    \  of Globus entities, often associated with a particular Globus\n      service.\
    \  For example \"auth\" could be used as an SNID for\n      identifiers generated\
    \ by the Globus authentication and\n      authorization service (Globus Auth).\n\
    \      The \"subnamespace-specific-string\" is an optional US-ASCII string\n \
    \     and second-level segment of the NSS, belonging to the \"SNID\"\n      context,\
    \ subject to the above syntax and conformant to the URN\n      syntax requirements\
    \ (see [RFC2141]).  \"subnamespace-specific-\n      string\" identifies a category\
    \ of thing within that Globus service,\n      such as \"scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all\"\
    \n   Relevant Ancillary Documentation:\n      None.\n   Identifier Uniqueness\
    \ Considerations:\n      Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Globus\
    \ Project Lead.\n      The Globus Project Lead may sub-delegate part of the namespace\
    \ to\n      third parties.  It will not be permissible, neither by the Globus\n\
    \      Project Lead nor any third party, to reassign previously assigned\n   \
    \   URNs.  A practical consequence is that a previously assigned\n      subnamespace\
    \ cannot be reassigned, unless additional arrangements\n      are made to prevent\
    \ identifier reassignments.\n   Identifier Persistence Considerations:\n     \
    \ Identifiers will never be reassigned, but in some circumstances\n      they\
    \ may be invalidated by the Globus Project Lead or by a third\n      party.\n\
    \   Process of Identifier Assignment:\n      Assignment of subnamespace identifiers\
    \ is limited to the Globus\n      Project Lead and those authorities that are\
    \ specifically\n      designated by the Globus Project Lead.  The Globus Project\
    \ Lead\n      may assign portions of the globus namespace (specifically, those\n\
    \      under designated subnamespace identifiers) for assignment by third\n  \
    \    parties.\n   Process of Identifier Resolution:\n      None currently.\n \
    \     Future versions of this document may define resources that can be\n    \
    \  used to resolve Globus identifiers.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n  \
    \    No additional rules beyond those specified in RFC 2141.\n   Conformance with\
    \ URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n   Validation Mechanism:\n  \
    \    None currently.\n      Future versions of this document may define resources\
    \ that can be\n      used to validate Globus identifiers.\n   Scope:\n      Global.\n"
- title: 3.  Examples (Informative)
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples (Informative)\n   The following examples are based on plans for\
    \ the Globus URN.  They\n   are therefore not guaranteed to be valid.\n   The\
    \ Globus Auth service defines the \"auth\" SNID and contains the\n   following\
    \ URNs:\n   o  urn:globus:auth:scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all\n   o  urn:globus:auth:grants:dependent_token\n\
    \   A hypothetical service, the Globus Groups service, would have a\n   distinct\
    \ SNID.  If that SNID were \"groups\", it might have URNs such\n   as the following:\n\
    \   o  urn:globus:groups:group:669b572e-9de4-11e5-966e-3c970e0c9cc4\n   o  urn:globus:groups:memberships:72e1c6c6-9de4-11e5-966e-3c970e0c9cc4\n"
- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   The current set of existing IANA namespaces\
    \ are insufficient because\n   Globus will be creating unique identifiers that\
    \ will persist in the\n   external system; these identifiers must be identifiable\
    \ as references\n   to Globus entities.\n   The use of the Globus namespace is\
    \ expected to be broad, including\n   but not limited to usage for:\n   o  OAuth2\
    \ scopes (see [RFC6749])\n   o  OAuth2 custom extension grants\n   o  Entity identification\
    \ for Globus Services\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   Members of the Globus community will benefit\
    \ from persistent and\n   globally unique identifiers for use in software and\
    \ in conformance\n   with protocols developed and used by Globus and third-party\n\
    \   collaborators.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are no special meanings for characters\
    \ in the NSS.  Thus, there\n   are no additional security considerations other\
    \ than those normally\n   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,\
    \ which are\n   described in [RFC1737] and [RFC2141].\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the \"globus\" namespace identifier\
    \ (NID) in the\n   \"Formal URN Namespaces\" registry located at\n   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>.\n"
