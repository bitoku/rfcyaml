Abstract In existing specifications, the route preferences for IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability TLVs are not explicitly stated.
There are also inconsistencies in the definition of how the up/down bit applies to route preference when the prefix advertisement appears in Level 2 Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs).
This document addresses these issues.
This document updates RFC 5308.
Introduction [RFC5302] defines the route preference rules as they apply to TLVs 128 and 130.
[RFC5305] introduced the IP Extended Reachability TLV 135 but did not explicitly adapt the route preference rules defined in [RFC5302] for the new TLV.
[RFC5308] defines the IPv6 Reachability TLV 236 and does include an explicit statement regarding route preference
but the statement introduces use of the up/down bit in advertisements that appear in Level 2 LSPs, which is inconsistent with statements made in [RFC5302] and [RFC5305].
This document defines explicit route preference rules for TLV 135, revises the route preference rules for TLV 236, and clarifies the usage of the up/down bit when it appears in TLVs in Level 2 LSPs.
This document is a clarification (NOT a correction) of [RFC5302] and [RFC5305]; it is a correction of the route preference rules defined in [RFC5308] to be consistent with the rules for IPv4.
It also makes explicit that the same rules apply to the Multi Topology (MT)
equivalent TLVs 235 and 237. 1.1.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Use of the Up/Down Bit in Level 2
The up/down bit was introduced in support of leaking prefixes downwards in the IS IS level hierarchy.
Routes that are leaked downwards have the bit set to 1.
Such prefixes MUST NOT be leaked upwards in the hierarchy.
So long as we confine ourselves to a single IS IS instance and the current number of supported levels (two), it is impossible to have a prefix advertised in a Level 2 LSP and have the up/down bit set to 1.
However, because [RFC5302] anticipated a future extension to IS IS that might support additional levels, it allowed for the possibility that the up/down bit might be set in a Level 2 LSP and supported easy migration in the event such an extension was introduced.
it is RECOMMENDED that implementations ignore the up/down bit in L2 LSPs, and accept the prefixes in L2 LSPs regardless of whether the up/down bit is set.
[RFC5305] addressed an additional case wherein an implementation included support for multiple virtual routers running IS IS in different areas.
In such a case, it is possible to redistribute prefixes between two IS IS instances in the same manner that prefixes are redistributed from other protocols into IS IS.
This introduced the possibility that a prefix could be redistributed from Level 1 to Level 1 (as well as between Level 2 and Level 2), and in the event the redistributed route was leaked from Level 1 to Level 2, two different routers in different areas would be advertising the same prefix into the Level 2 sub domain.
To prevent this, Section 4.1 of [RFC5305] specifies: If a prefix is advertised from one area to another at the same level, then the up/down bit SHALL be set to 1.
However, the statement in [RFC5302] that the up/down bit is ignored in Level 2 LSPs is not altered by [RFC5305].
The conclusion then is that there is no "L2 inter area route"; indeed, no such route type is defined by [RFC5302].
However, [RFC5308] ignored this fact and introduced such a route type in Section 5 when it specified a preference for "Level 2 down prefix".
This is an error that this document corrects.
As changing the use of the up/down bit in TLVs 236 and 237 may introduce interoperability issues, implementors may wish to support transition mechanisms from the behavior described in [RFC5308] to the behavior described in this document.
Types of Routes in IS IS Supported by Extended Reachability TLVs [RFC5302]
is the authoritative reference for the types of routes supported by TLVs 128 and 130.
However, a number of attributes supported by those TLVs are NOT supported by TLVs 135, 235, 236, and 237.
Distinction between internal/external metrics is not supported.
In the case of IPv4 TLVs (135 and 235), the distinction between internal and external route types is not supported.
However, the Prefix Attribute Flags sub TLV defined in [PFXATTR]
reintroduces the distinction between internal and external route types.
The definitions below include references to the relevant attribute bits from [PFXATTR].

L2 L1 inter area routes; L1 L1 inter area routes 3.4.
Order of Preference for All Types of Routes Supported by TLVs 236 and 237
This document defines the following route preferences for IPv6 routes advertised in TLVs 236 or 237.
Note that all types of routes listed for a given preference are treated equally.
L1 intra area routes; L1 external routes 2.
L2 intra area routes; L2 external routes; L1 L2 inter area routes; L1 L2 external routes; L2 L2 inter area routes 3.
L2 L1 inter area routes; L2 L1 external routes; L1 L1 inter  area routes 4.
This document raises no new security considerations.
Security considerations for the IS IS protocol are covered in [ISO10589], [RFC5304], and [RFC5310].
This example documents a real world interoperability issue that occurs because implementations from different vendors have interpreted the use of the up/down bit in Level 2 LSPs inconsistently.
In Figure 1, both R0 and R4 are advertising the prefix 10/8.
Level 2 instances are running on R3 to separate the network into two areas.
R3 is performing route leaking and advertises prefixes from R4 to the other Level 2 process.
The network is using extended metrics (TLV 135 defined in [RFC5305]).
R0 advertises 10/8 with metric 2000, and R3 advertises 10/8 with metric 100.
All links have a metric of 1.
When advertising 10/8 in its Level 2 LSP, R3 sets the down bit as specified in [RFC5305].
R1, R2, and R3 are from three different vendors (R1 Vendor1, R2 Vendor2, R3 Vendor3).
During interoperability testing, routing loops are observed in this scenario.
R2 has two possible paths to reach 10/8:
Level 2 route with metric 2002 and up/down bit set to 0 (from R0) and Level 2 route with
metric 101 and up/down bit set to 1 (from R3).
R2 selects R1 as the next hop to 10/8 because it prefers the route that does NOT have the up/down bit set.
R3 has two possible paths to reach 10/8:
Level 2 route with metric 2003 and up/down bit set to 0
(from R0) and Level 2 route with metric 101 and up/down bit set to 0 (from R4).
R3 selects R4 as the next hop due to lowest metric.
R1 has two possible paths to reach 10/8:
Level 2 route with metric 2001 and up/down bit set to 0
(from R0) and Level 2 route with metric 102 and up/down bit set to 1 (from R3).
R1 selects R2 as the next hop due to lowest metric.
When R1 or R2 try to send traffic to 10/8, packets loop due to inconsistent routing decisions between R1 and R2.
