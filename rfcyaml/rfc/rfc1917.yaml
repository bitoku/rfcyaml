  - "Abstract\n   This document is an appeal to the Internet community to return unused\n\
    \   address space, i.e. any block of consecutive IP prefixes, to the\n   Internet\
    \ Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or any of the delegated\n   registries, for\
    \ reapportionment.  Similarly an appeal is issued to\n   providers to return unused\
    \ prefixes which fall outside their\n   customary address blocks to the IANA for\
    \ reapportionment.\n"
- title: 1. Background
  contents:
  - "1. Background\n   The Internet of today is a dramatically different network than\
    \ the\n   original designers ever envisioned.  It is the largest public data\n\
    \   network in the world, and continues to grow at an exponential rate\n   which\
    \ doubles all major operational parameters every nine months.  A\n   common metaphor\
    \ in engineering is that every time a problem increases\n   in size by an order\
    \ of magnitude, it becomes a new problem.  This\n   adage has been true over the\
    \ lifetime of the Internet.\n   The Internet is currently faced with two major\
    \ operational problems\n   (amoung others).  The first is the eventual exhaustion\
    \ of the IPv4\n   address space and the second is the ability to route packets\
    \ between\n   the large number of individual networks that make up the Internet.\n\
    \   The first problem is simply one of supply.  There are only 2^32 IPv4\n   addresses\
    \ available.  The lifetime of that space is proportional to\n   the efficiency\
    \ of its allocation and utilization.  The second problem\n   is mainly a capacity\
    \ problem.  If the number of routes exceeds the\n   current capacity of the core\
    \ Internet routers, some routes will be\n   dropped and sections of the Internet\
    \ will no longer be able to\n   communicate with each other.  The two problems\
    \ are coupled and the\n   dominant one has, and will, change over time.\n   The\
    \ initial design of IP had all addresses the same, eight bits of\n   network number\
    \ and twenty four bits of host number.  The expectation\n   was of a few, large,\
    \ global networks.  During the first spurts of\n   growth, especially with the\
    \ invention of LAN technologies, it became\n   obvious that this assumption was\
    \ wrong and the separation of the\n   address space into three classes (Class\
    \ A for a few huge networks;\n   Class B for more, smaller networks; and Class\
    \ C for those really\n   small LANs, with lots of network numbers) was implemented.\
    \  Soon\n   subnets were added so sites with many small LANs could appear as a\n\
    \   single network to others, the first step at limiting routing table\n   size.\
    \  And finally, CIDR was introduced to the network, to add even\n   more flexibility\
    \ to the addressing, extending the split from three\n   classes to potentially\
    \ thirty different classes.\n   Subnets were introduced to provide a mechanism\
    \ for sites to divide a\n   single network number (Class A, B, or C) into pieces,\
    \ allowing a\n   higher utilization of address space, and thus promoting conservation\n\
    \   of the IPv4 address space.  Because of the built-in notion of\n   classful\
    \ addresses, subnetting automatically induced a reduction in\n   the routing requirements\
    \ on the Internet.  Instead of using two (or\n   more) class C networks, a site\
    \ could subnet a single class B into two\n   (or more) subnets.  Both the allocation\
    \ and the advertisement of a\n   route to the second and succeeding class C's\
    \ are saved.\n   Since 1993, the concept of classless (the \"C\" in CIDR) addresses\
    \ have\n   been introduced to the Internet community.  Addresses are\n   increasingly\
    \ thought of as bitwise contiguous blocks of the entire\n   address space, rather\
    \ than a class A,B,C network.  For example, the\n   address block formerly known\
    \ as a Class A network, would be referred\n   to as a network with a /8 prefix,\
    \ meaning the first 8 bits of the\n   address define the network portion of the\
    \ address.  Sometimes the /8\n   will be expressed as a mask of 255.0.0.0 (in\
    \ the same way a 16 bit\n   subnet mask will be written as 255.255.0.0).\n   This\
    \ scheme allows \"supernetting\" of addresses together into blocks\n   which can\
    \ be advertised as a single routing entry.  The practical\n   purpose of this\
    \ effort is to allow service providers and address\n   registries to delegate\
    \ realistic address spaces to organizations and\n   be unfettered by the traditional\
    \ network classes, which were\n   inappropriately sized for most organizations.\
    \  For example the block\n   of 2048 class C network numbers beginning with 192.24.0.0\
    \ and ending\n   with 192.31.255.0 can be referenced as 192.24/19, or 192.24.0.0\
    \ with\n   a mask of 255.248.0.0 (i.e. similar to a 19 bit subnet mask written\n\
    \   in dotted decimal notation).  The concept of \"supernetting\" allows\n   the\
    \ remaining Internet address space to be allocated in smaller\n   blocks, thus\
    \ allowing more networks and better efficiency.  For a\n   more detailed discussion\
    \ refer to RFC 1518.\n   Like subnetting, CIDR also helps address the reduction\
    \ of routing\n   requirements, but it is not as automatic as the case of subnets.\n\
    \   CIDR blocks are allocated in a way which promotes hierarchical\n   routing.\
    \  A provider is typically given a large block of addresses to\n   redistribute\
    \ to their customers.  For example, if the provider P has\n   been given the CIDR\
    \ block 192.168/16, a block of 255 contiguous class\n   C networks, they can provide\
    \ one class C network to each of 255\n   customers (who may in turn subnet those\
    \ class C networks into smaller\n   pieces) yet still only advertise the single\
    \ route 192.168/16.  Thus\n   CIDR only helps reduce the routing problem if blocks\
    \ are assigned and\n   maintained in a hierarchical manner.\n   RFC 1797 described\
    \ a technical experiment designed to test the\n   problems with allocating the\
    \ currently reserved Class A network\n   space.  RFC 1879 described the results\
    \ of this experiment.  This\n   effort shows that \"supersubnetting\" of a Class\
    \ A network into\n   numerous (even millions) of smaller networks is practical.\n\
    \   The dominating portion of the problem facing the Internet today is\n   routing\
    \ requirements.  The following statements constitute a first\n   order approximation\
    \ based on current growth, a simple model of router\n   resources, etc.  Current\
    \ routing technology can handle approximately\n   twice the number of routes which\
    \ are currently advertised on \"core\"\n   Internet routers.  Router capacity\
    \ is doubling every 18 months, while\n   routing tables are doubling every 9 months.\
    \  If routes continue to be\n   introduced at the current rate, the Internet will\
    \ cease to function\n   as a reliable infrastructure in approximately 2 to 3 years.\n\
    \   The good news is that CIDR is working.  Address blocks are being\n   allocated\
    \ and assigned in a hierarchical manner, and the CIDR'ization\n   of large portions\
    \ of the address space which were assigned according\n   to the guidelines of\
    \ RFC 1466 resulted in a significant drop of\n   advertised routes.  However,\
    \ recent growth trends show that the\n   number of routes is once again growing\
    \ at an exponential rate, and\n   that the reduction with the introduction of\
    \ CIDR was simply a\n   sawtooth in the rate.\n   The growth in the number of\
    \ routes can logically come from only two\n   places, the extra routes generated\
    \ with the breakup of CIDR blocks,\n   and previously allocated and unannounced\
    \ networks being connected.\n   (Registries are still allocating a few addresses\
    \ not within CIDR\n   blocks, so a small third source does exist.)  With increasing\n\
    \   popularity there is increasing competition between providers.  If a\n   site\
    \ changes provider and retains the use of their CIDR block\n   addresses, holes\
    \ appear in the blocks and specific routes are added\n   to the routing structure\
    \ to accommodate these cases.  Thus over time,\n   CIDR will improve address utilization\
    \ efficiency yet not help the\n   routing requirements unless providers can keep\
    \ their CIDR blocks\n   intact.\n   The second source for new route introduction\
    \ is sites who had\n   previously operated a private IP network, which had been\
    \ registered\n   and assigned a network number (or numerous networks), but have\
    \ only\n   recently connected to the global Internet.  This RFC is a policy\n\
    \   based attempt to help preserve the operation of the current Internet\n   by\
    \ addressing the issues of previously registered but unannounced IP\n   networks.\n\
    \   An additional area of route introduction comes from non-aggregating\n   router\
    \ configurations.  Aggregation is not automatic on most routers,\n   and providers\
    \ who may have intact CIDR blocks are, in many cases,\n   advertising individual\
    \ routes instead of an aggregate block without\n   realizing.\n   In the context\
    \ of this document, the phrase \"Global Internet\" refers\n   to the mesh of interconnected\
    \ public networks (Autonomous Systems)\n   which has its origins in the U.S. National\
    \ Science Foundation (NSF)\n   backbone, other national networks, and commercial\
    \ enterprises.\n   Similarly, the phrase or any references to the \"Core Routers\"\
    \ refer\n   to the set of routers which carry the full set of route\n   advertisements\
    \ and act as interconnect points for the public networks\n   making up the \"\
    Global Internet.\"\n"

    \ were much less stringent than those required today.\n   Organizations were essentially\
    \ assigned networks based on their\n   requests.\n"

- title: 3. Problem
  contents:
  - "3. Problem\n   Before the introduction of RFC 1466 and of CIDR, some 50,000 networks\n\
    \   were assigned by the IANA, yet only a small percentage (30-40%) of\n   the\
    \ sites actually had connections to the global Internet and\n   advertised those\
    \ networks.  As the popularity of the Internet is\n   growing, a growing number\
    \ of those sites are being connected, and\n   increasing the size of the routing\
    \ tables.\n   Current Internet sites have received their address assignments in\n\
    \   various ways and steps.  Some sites, through a little (or in some\n   cases\
    \ no) work, could donate unused IP nets back to the IANA.\n   Some organizations\
    \ have made small requests at first and received a\n   Class C assignment (or\
    \ multiple Class C assignments), and after\n   unexpected growth made subsequent\
    \ requests and received Class B\n   assignments.\n   Several Internet service\
    \ providers were given blocks of the Class B\n   address space to distribute to\
    \ customers.  This space was often\n   provided to clients based upon a level\
    \ of service purchased rather\n   than actual need.\n   Many organizations have\
    \ either merged or are associated with parent\n   organizations which produce\
    \ situations with large inefficiencies in\n   address assignment.\n   Many organizations\
    \ have requested addresses based on their need to\n   run TCP/IP on internal machines\
    \ which have no interest in connecting\n   to the global Internet.  Most vendors\
    \ manuals have instructed (and\n   provided copies of the application forms),\
    \ sites to request IP\n   address assignments.\n   Other organizations have large\
    \ internal IP networks, and are\n   connected to the Internet through application\
    \ layer gateways or\n   network address translators, and will never announce their\
    \ internal\n   networks.\n"
- title: 4. Appeal
  contents:
  - "4. Appeal\n   To the members of the Internet community who have IP network\n\
    \   assignments which may be currently unused, the Internet community\n   would\
    \ like to encourage you to return those addresses to the IANA or\n   your provider\
    \ for reapportionment.\n   Specifically those sites who have networks which are\
    \ unused are\n   encouraged to return those addresses. Similarly to those sites\
    \ who\n   are using a small percentage of their address space and who could\n\
    \   relatively easily remove network assignments from active use, the\n   Internet\
    \ community encourages such efforts.\n   To those sites who have networks which\
    \ will never need to connect to\n   the global Internet, or for security reasons\
    \ will always be isolated,\n   consider returning the address assignments to the\
    \ IANA or your\n   provider and utilizing prefixes recommended in RFC 1597.\n\
    \   In those cases where renumbering is required, sites are encouraged to\n  \
    \ put into place a plan to renumber machines, as is reasonably\n   convenient,\
    \ and work towards minimizing the number of routes\n   advertised to their providers.\n"
- title: 4.1 Suggestions to Providers
  contents:
  - "4.1 Suggestions to Providers\n   Many providers are currently advertising non-CIDR\
    \ routes which\n   encompass a large block of addresses, ie any Class A (0/1)\
    \ or Class B\n   (128/2) space.  Some customers who are only using a percentage\
    \ of\n   their address space (assuming they are subnetting using contiguous\n\
    \   bits) may be willing to allow usage of the upper portion of their\n   assigned\
    \ address space by their providers other customers.\n   This scheme requires certain\
    \ elements be installed or already in\n   place to get the routing correct, but\
    \ has the potential to gain the\n   use of a large number of small networks without\
    \ growth of the global\n   routing tables.  This would require additional measures\
    \ of\n   cooperation between providers and their customers but could prove to\n\
    \   have both economic advantages, as well as good Internet citizen\n   standing.\n\
    \   For example, large organization S has been assigned the class A block\n  \
    \ of addresses 10.0.0.0. and is currently using provider P for their\n   connection\
    \ to the global Internet.  P is already advertising the\n   route for 10.0.0.0\
    \ to the global Internet.  S has been allocating its\n   internal networks using\
    \ a right to left bit incrementing model.  P\n   and S could agree that S will\
    \ allow some /18 (for example) prefixes\n   to be made available for P's other\
    \ customers.  This would impose no\n   hardships whatsoever on S, presuming his\
    \ router can speak BGP, and\n   allow P to attach a huge number of small customers\
    \ without the need\n   to advertise more routes or request additional address\
    \ blocks from\n   the IANA or their upstream provider.\n   The \"Net 39\" experiment\
    \ as outlined in RFC 1797 and summarized in RFC\n   1879 provided practical data\
    \ on the implementation of the suggested\n   schemes.\n   Additionally, providers\
    \ are encouraged to release all unused networks\n   which fall outside of their\
    \ normal address blocks back to the IANA or\n   the appropriate registry.\n  \
    \ New customers, particularly those who may have recently changed\n   providers,\
    \ and who have small networks which are not part of\n   CIDR'ized blocks, should\
    \ be encouraged to renumber and release their\n   previous addresses back to the\
    \ provider or the IANA.\n   Since the first introduction of CIDR in April of 1994,\
    \ many providers\n   have aggresively pursued the concepts of aggregation.  Some\
    \ providers\n   actively persuaded their customers to renumber, while others pursued\n\
    \   peering arrangements with other providers, and others did both.\n   Providers\
    \ should continue to actively and routinely pursue both\n   methods to streamline\
    \ routing table growth.  Cooperation between\n   providers is absolutely essential\
    \ to short (and long) term management\n   of routing requirements.\n   Providers\
    \ should regularly verify the routes they are advertising to\n   their upstream\
    \ provider(s) to validate their router configurations\n   and confirm correct\
    \ aggregation is occuring.\n"

- title: 5. Conclusion
  contents:
  - "5. Conclusion\n   Rationalizing the global addressing hierarchy is a goal which\
    \ should\n   be supported by any organization which is currently connected or\n\
    \   plans to connect to the Internet.  If (and possibly when) the\n   situation\
    \ ever reaches a critical point, the core service providers\n   whose routers\
    \ are failing and losing routes will be forced to make\n   one of two choices,\
    \ both painful to the user community.\n   They could begin blocking routes to\
    \ their customers who are\n   advertising too many disjoint routes, where \"too\
    \ many\" will be set at\n   the level necessary to keep their routers functioning\
    \ properly.  This\n   is a domino effect since the next level of providers will\
    \ be forced\n   to make the same effort, until individual organizations are forced\
    \ to\n   only advertise routes to portions of their networks.\n   The second option\
    \ the core providers have is to charge for advertised\n   routes.  The price level\
    \ will be set at a point which reduces the\n   number of routes to a level which\
    \ will keep their routers functioning\n   properly.  Once again a domino effect\
    \ will take place until the price\n   increases will effect individual organizations.\n\
    \   Some planning and efforts by organizations and providers now while\n   there\
    \ is a some time available can help delay or prevent either or\n   the two scenarios\
    \ from occurring.\n   This system has already produced very favorable results\
    \ when applied\n   on a small scale.  As of this writing 4 Class A networks have\
    \ been\n   returned to the IANA.  This may not seem significant but those 4\n\
    \   networks represent over 1.5% of the total IPv4 address capacity.\n"
