  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)\n\
    \   [RFC5214] specifies a Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) interface\n  \
    \ type for the transmission of IPv6 packets over IPv4 networks using\n   automatic\
    \ IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation.  ISATAP interfaces therefore\n   typically configure\
    \ IPv6 addresses and prefixes, but they do not\n   configure IPv4 addresses and\
    \ prefixes.  In typical implementations\n   and deployments, an ISATAP interface\
    \ therefore appears as an ordinary\n   interface configured for IPv6 operation\
    \ but with a null IPv4\n   configuration.  This places an unnecessary limitation\
    \ on the ISATAP\n   domain of applicability.\n   ISATAP interfaces perform automatic\
    \ IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation over a\n   virtual IPv6 overlay that spans a region\
    \ within a connected IPv4\n   routing topology (i.e., a \"site\") comprising ordinary\
    \ IPv4 routers.\n   ISATAP interfaces configure IPv6 link-local addresses that\n\
    \   encapsulate an IPv4 address assigned to an underlying IPv4 interface\n   within\
    \ the IPv6 link-local prefix \"fe80::/10\", as specified in\n   Sections 6 and\
    \ 7 of [RFC5214].  ISATAP interfaces may additionally\n   configure IPv6 addresses\
    \ from a non-link-local IPv6 prefix in exactly\n   the same fashion.  As a result,\
    \ [RFC5214] extends the basic\n   transition mechanisms specified in [RFC4213].\n\
    \   This document specifies mechanisms and operational practices that\n   enable\
    \ automatic IPv4-in-IPv4 encapsulation over ISATAP interfaces in\n   the same\
    \ manner as for IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation.  As a result, this\n   document also\
    \ extends the IPv4-in-IPv4 tunneling mechanisms specified\n   in [RFC2003].  These\
    \ mechanisms are useful in a wide variety of\n   enterprise network scenarios,\
    \ e.g., as discussed in the RANGER\n   [RANGER] and VET [VET] proposals.\n   The\
    \ following sections specify IPv4 operation over ISATAP interfaces.\n   A working\
    \ knowledge of the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols ([RFC0791] and\n   [RFC2460]), IPv4-in-IPv4\
    \ encapsulation [RFC2003], and IPv6-in-IPv4\n   encapsulation ([RFC4213] and [RFC5214])\
    \ is assumed.\n"

- title: 3.  ISATAP Interface Model
  contents:
  - "3.  ISATAP Interface Model\n   ISATAP interfaces use automatic IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation\
    \ to span a\n   region within a connected IPv4 routing topology (i.e., a \"site\"\
    ) in a\n   single IPv6 hop.  That is to say that the site comprises border nodes\n\
    \   with ISATAP interfaces that forward IPv6-in-IPv4 packets across the\n   site\
    \ in a single IPv6 hop, and ordinary IPv4 routers between the\n   border nodes\
    \ that decrement the Time to Live (TTL) in the outer IPv4\n   header.  Border\
    \ nodes that configure ISATAP interfaces within the\n   same site therefore see\
    \ each other as single-hop neighbors.\n   ISATAP interfaces are configured over\
    \ one or more of the node's\n   underlying IPv4 interfaces connected to the site.\
    \  These underlying\n   IPv4 interfaces configure site- or greater-scoped IPv4\
    \ addresses, and\n   the underlying IPv4 interfaces of two \"neighboring\" ISATAP\
    \ interfaces\n   may be separated by many IPv4 hops within the site.\n   This\
    \ specification simply extends the ISATAP interface model to also\n   support\
    \ IPv4-in-IPv4 encapsulation.  When IPv4-in-IPv4 encapsulation\n   is used, the\
    \ ISATAP interface spans exactly the same underlying site\n   as for IPv6-in-IPv4\
    \ encapsulation.\n"

- title: 6.1.  ISATAP IPv4 Address Configuration
  contents:
  - "6.1.  ISATAP IPv4 Address Configuration\n   As for IPv6 operation, IPv4 operation\
    \ requires that all ISATAP\n   interfaces connected to the same site configure\
    \ a unique Layer 3 IPv4\n   address (\"L3ADDR\") taken from an IPv4 prefix for\
    \ the site.  L3ADDR is\n   used for next-hop determination, but it may also be\
    \ used as the\n   source address for packets that originate from the ISATAP interface\n\
    \   itself.\n   When a unique \"name\" for the ISATAP site is required (e.g.,\
    \ to\n   distinguish it from other ISATAP sites), L3ADDR is taken from a\n   public\
    \ IPv4 prefix.  Otherwise, it may be taken from a link-local-\n   scoped IPv4\
    \ prefix (e.g., 169.254/16 [RFC3927]).\n   Methods for ensuring L3ADDR uniqueness\
    \ include dynamic allocation\n   using DHCP [RFC2131], manual configuration, etc.\n"

    \ addresses in FIB entries configured over an ISATAP interface\n   correspond\
    \ to the L3ADDR assigned to the ISATAP interface of a\n   neighbor.\n"
- title: 6.3.  ISATAP Interface Determination
  contents:
  - "6.3.  ISATAP Interface Determination\n   When the node's IPv4 layer has a packet\
    \ to send, it performs an IPv4\n   FIB lookup to determine the outgoing ISATAP\
    \ interface and the next-\n   hop L3ADDR.  The node then checks the packet length\
    \ against the MTU\n   configured on the ISATAP interface.\n   If the packet is\
    \ no larger than the MTU, the node admits it into the\n   ISATAP interface without\
    \ fragmentation.  If the packet is larger than\n   the MTU, the node examines\
    \ the \"Don't Fragment (DF)\" flag in the IPv4\n   header.  If DF=1, it drops\
    \ the packet and returns an ICMPv4\n   \"fragmentation needed\" message to the\
    \ original source [RFC1191];\n   otherwise, it fragments the packet using IPv4\
    \ fragmentation and\n   admits each fragment into the ISATAP interface.\n"
- title: 6.4.  Next-Hop Determination and Address Mapping
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Next-Hop Determination and Address Mapping\n   As for ISATAP for IPv6,\
    \ ISATAP for IPv4 requires a means for\n   determining the L3ADDR of neighbors\
    \ on the ISATAP interface that can\n   provide a next-hop toward the final destination.\
    \  Next-hop\n   determination for default routes is through the Potential Router\
    \ List\n   (PRL) discovery procedures specified in Section 8.3.2 of [RFC5214].\n\
    \   Next-hop determination methods for more-specific routes include\n   forwarding\
    \ initial packets via a default router until a redirect is\n   received, name\
    \ service lookup (e.g., as described in [VET]), etc.\n   After a next-hop L3ADDR\
    \ is discovered, the node admits IPv4\n   packets/fragments into the ISATAP interface\
    \ and maps the next-hop\n   L3ADDR into a next-hop Layer 2 address (\"L2ADDR\"\
    ), which in reality\n   is the IPv4 address of an underlying interface of the\
    \ ISATAP neighbor\n   that may be many IPv4 hops away.\n   Address mapping for\
    \ IPv4 differs from the IPv6 version in that no\n   algorithmic mapping between\
    \ L3ADDR and L2ADDR is possible.  ISATAP\n   for IPv4 therefore requires an L3ADDR->L2ADDR\
    \ address mapping method\n   that is coordinated on a per-site basis such that\
    \ all nodes in the\n   site follow the same convention.  Examples include name\
    \ service\n   lookup (e.g., as described in [VET]), static mapping table lookup,\n\
    \   etc.\n   The node next performs an IPv4 FIB lookup on the next-hop L2ADDR\
    \ to\n   determine the correct underlying IPv4 interface.  If the FIB lookup\n\
    \   fails, the node drops the packet and returns an ICMPv4 \"Destination\n   Unreachable\"\
    \ message to the original source [RFC0792]; otherwise, it\n   encapsulates the\
    \ packet and submits it to the IPv4 layer as described\n   below.\n"
- title: 6.5.  Encapsulation and Transmission
  contents:
  - "6.5.  Encapsulation and Transmission\n   After performing the IPv4 FIB lookup\
    \ on the next-hop L2ADDR, the node\n   encapsulates the packet as specified in\
    \ [RFC2003] with the IPv4\n   address of the underlying interface as the outer\
    \ IPv4 source address\n   and the next-hop L2ADDR as the outer IPv4 destination\
    \ address.  The\n   node sets the DF flag in the outer IPv4 header according to\
    \ Section\n   3.2 of [RFC4213].  The node also sets the IP protocol field in the\n\
    \   outer IPv4 header to 4 (i.e., ip-protocol-4).\n   The node then submits the\
    \ encapsulated packet to the IPv4 layer.  The\n   IPv4 layer fragments the packet\
    \ if necessary, then forwards each\n   fragment to the underlying IPv4 interface.\
    \  The underlying IPv4\n   interface then performs address resolution on the outer\
    \ IPv4\n   destination address (i.e., the next-hop L2ADDR) and submits the\n \
    \  packet for transmission on the underlying link layer.\n"
- title: 6.6.  IPv4 Multicast Mapping
  contents:
  - "6.6.  IPv4 Multicast Mapping\n   In many aspects, ISATAP is simply a unicast-only\
    \ derivative of\n   \"6over4\" [RFC2529].  For various reasons, however, ISATAP\
    \ has seen\n   practical wide-scale deployment while the 6over4 approach has been\n\
    \   silently carried forward through ongoing research efforts.  This\n   specification\
    \ extends the ISATAP interface model to support IPv4\n   multicast mapping in\
    \ a manner that exactly parallels IPv6 multicast\n   mapping in 6over4 (see [RFC2529],\
    \ Section 6).  Indeed, the approach\n   might more aptly be named \"4over4\" were\
    \ it not for the fact that the\n   name \"ISATAP\" has already become ingrained\
    \ in the widely published\n   terminology.\n   IPv4 multicast mapping is available\
    \ only on ISATAP interfaces\n   configured over sites that support IPv4 multicast.\
    \  For such sites,\n   an IPv4 packet sent on an ISATAP interface with a multicast\n\
    \   destination address DST MUST be encapsulated for transmission on an\n   underlying\
    \ IPv4 interface to the IPv4 multicast address of\n   Organization-Local Scope\
    \ using the mapping below.  The mapped address\n   SHOULD be taken from the block\
    \ 239.193.0.0/16, a different sub-block\n   of the Organization-Local Scope address\
    \ block, or -- if none of those\n   are available -- from the expansion blocks\
    \ defined in [RFC2365].\n   Note that when they are formed using the expansion\
