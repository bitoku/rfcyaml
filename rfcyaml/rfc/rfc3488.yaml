  - "2. Introduction\n   IGMP Snooping is a popular, but not well documented mechanism\
    \ to\n   restrict multicast traffic, in switched networks, to those ports that\n\
    \   want to receive the multicast traffic.  It dynamically establishes\n   and\
    \ terminates multicast group specific forwarding in switches that\n   support\
    \ this feature.\n   The main limitation of IGMP Snooping is that it can only restrict\n\
    \   multicast traffic onto switch ports where receiving hosts are\n   connected\
    \ directly or indirectly via other switches.  IGMP Snooping\n   can not restrict\
    \ multicast traffic to ports where at least one\n   multicast router is connected.\
    \  It must instead flood multicast\n   traffic to these ports.  Snooping on IGMP\
    \ messages alone is an\n   intrinsic limitation.  Through it, a switch can only\
    \ learn which\n   multicast flows are being requested by hosts.  A switch can\
    \ not learn\n   through IGMP which traffic flows need to be received by router\
    \ ports\n   to be routed because routers do not report these flows via IGMP.\n\
    \   In situations where multiple multicast routers are connected to a\n   switched\
    \ backbone, IGMP Snooping will not reduce multicast traffic\n   load.  Nor will\
    \ it assist in increasing internal bandwidth through\n   the use of switches in\
    \ the network.\n   In switched backbone networks or exchange points, where predominantly\n\
    \   routers are connected with each other, a large amount of multicast\n   traffic\
    \ may lead to unexpected congestion.  It also leads to more\n   resource consumption\
    \ in the routers because they must discard the\n   unwanted multicast traffic.\n\
    \   The RGMP protocol described in this document restricts multicast\n   traffic\
    \ to router ports.  To effectively restrict traffic, it must be\n   supported\
    \ by both the switches and the routers in the network.\n   The RGMP message format\
    \ resembles the IGMPv2 message format so that\n   existing switches, capable of\
    \ IGMP Snooping, can easily be enhanced\n   with this feature.  Its messages are\
    \ encapsulated in IPv4 datagrams,\n   with a protocol number of 2, the same as\
    \ that of IGMP.  All RGMP\n   messages are sent with TTL 1, to destination address\
    \ 224.0.0.25. This\n   address has been assigned by IANA to carry messages from\
    \ routers to\n   switches [3].\n   RGMP is designed to work in conjunction with\
    \ multicast routing\n   protocols where explicit join/prune to the distribution\
    \ tree is\n   performed.  PIM-SM [4] is an example of such a protocol.\n   The\
    \ RGMP protocol specifies operations only for IP version 4\n   multicast routing.\
    \  IP version 6 is not considered.\n   To keep RGMP simple, efficient and easy\
    \ to implement, it is designed\n   for switches to expect RGMP messages from only\
    \ one source per port.\n   For this reason, RGMP only supports a single RGMP enabled\
    \ router to\n   be connected directly to a port of an RGMP enabled switch.  Such\
    \ a\n   topology should be customary when connecting routers to backbone\n   switches\
    \ and thus not pose a limitation on the deployment of RGMP.\n   All RGMP messages\
    \ have the following format:\n    0                   1                   2  \
    \                 3\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\

- title: 2.1 Type
  contents:
  - "2.1 Type\n   There are four types of RGMP messages of concern to the\n   router-switch\
    \ interaction.  The type codes are defined to be the\n   highest values in an\
    \ octet to avoid the re-use of already assigned\n   IGMP type codes.\n      0xFF\
    \ = Hello\n      0xFE = Bye\n      0xFD = Join a group\n      0xFC = Leave a group\n\
    \   Unrecognized message types should be silently ignored.\n   Note:\n   RGMP\
    \ and the IANA assignment of address 224.0.0.25 for it predates\n   RFC 3228 [9].\
    \  RGMP defines Type values which in RFC 3228 are\n   assigned to protocol testing\
    \ and experimentation.  This is not an\n   operational issue for RGMP itself because\
    \ only RGMP packets use the\n   IPv4 destination address 224.0.0.25.  The Type\
    \ values defined above\n   are thus ONLY valid in conjunction with the RGMP destination\
    \ address.\n"

    \  The\n   algorithm and handling of checksum are the same as those for IGMP\n\

  contents:
  - "3.1 RGMP Router side Protocol Description\n   Backbone switches use RGMP to learn\
    \ which groups are desired at each\n   of their ports.  Multicast routers use\
    \ RGMP to pass such information\n   to the switches.  Only routers send RGMP messages.\
    \  They ignore\n   received RGMP messages.\n   A Router enabled for RGMP on an\
    \ interface periodically [Hello\n   Interval] sends an RGMP Hello message to the\
    \ attached network to\n   indicate that it is RGMP enabled.  When RGMP is disabled\
    \ on a routers\n   interface, it will send out an RGMP Bye message on that interface,\n\
    \   indicating that it again wishes to receive IPv4 multicast traffic\n   promiscuously\
    \ from that interface.\n   When an interface is RGMP enabled, a router sends an\
    \ RGMP Join\n   message out through this interface to each group that it wants\
    \ to\n   receive traffic for from the interface.  The router needs to\n   periodically\
    \ [Join Interval] re-send an RGMP Join for a group to\n   indicate its continued\
    \ desire to receive multicast traffic.\n   Routers supporting RGMP MUST NOT send\
    \ RGMP Join or Leave messages for\n   groups 224.0.0.x (x=0...255), 224.0.1.39\
    \ and 224.0.1.40.  The latter\n   two are known as cisco-rp-announce and cisco-rp-discovery\
    \ [3].\n   When a router no longer needs to receive traffic for a particular\n\
    \   group, it sends an RGMP Leave message for the group.  For robustness,\n  \
    \ the router MAY send more than one such message.\n   If IPv4 multicast packets\
    \ for an undesired group are received at a\n   router from a switch, the router\
    \ MAY send a RGMP Leave message for\n   that group to the switch.  These messages\
    \ are called data-triggered\n   RGMP Leave messages and the router SHOULD rate-limit\
    \ them.  The\n   router MAY suppress sending a data triggered RGMP Leave message\
    \ if it\n   has a desired group that has the same MAC destination address as the\n\
    \   undesired group.  (See RFC 1112 [6] for MAC ambiguity.)  Such\n   suppression\
    \ of data triggered RGMP Leave messages SHOULD be\n   configurable if supported.\n"
- title: 3.2 RGMP Switch side Protocol Description
  contents:
  - "3.2 RGMP Switch side Protocol Description\n   A switch enabled for RGMP on a\
    \ network consumes RGMP messages\n   received from ports of the network and processes\
    \ them as described\n   below.  If enabled for RGMP, the switch must NOT forward/flood\n\
    \   received RGMP messages out to other ports of the network.\n   RGMP on a switch\
    \ operates on a per port basis, establishing per-group\n   forwarding state on\
    \ RGMP enabled ports.  A port reverts into an RGMP\n   enabled port upon receipt\
    \ of an RGMP Hello message on the port, and a\n   timer [5 * Hello Interval] is\
    \ started.  This timer is restarted by\n   each RGMP Hello message arriving on\
    \ the port.  If this timer expires\n   or if it is removed by the arrival of an\
    \ RGMP Bye message, then the\n   port reverts to its prior state of multicast\
    \ traffic forwarding.\n   Correct deployment of RGMP is one RGMP enabled router\
    \ directly\n   connected to a port on a switch that supports RGMP.  The port on\
    \ the\n   switch MAY want to keep track of the IPv4 originator address of the\n\
    \   RGMP Hello and Bye messages it receives on that port.  In the event\n   it\
    \ receives multiple IPv4 originating addresses in RGMP messages on\n   one port,\
    \ the switch MAY generate an alert to notify the\n   administrator.  The switch\
    \ MAY also have a configuration option that\n   will allow for the operator to\
    \ disable RGMP and have the switch fall\n   back to flooding IPv4 multicast on\
    \ that port, although this is a\n   potentially dangerous option.\n   By default,\
    \ connecting two or more RGMP enabled routers to a switch\n   port will cause\
    \ intermittent black holing of IPv4 multicast traffic\n   towards these routers.\
    \  Black holing occurs when a RGMP Leave is\n   received from one router while\
    \ the other router is still joined.\n   This malfunction is not only easily recognized\
    \ by the actual users\n   connected through the routers, but it also adheres to\
    \ the principle\n   that a failure situation causes less traffic than more.  Reverting\
    \ to\n   flooding easily maintains the illusion that everything is working\n \
    \  perfectly.  The exception is that the traffic constraining benefits\n   of\
    \ RGMP are not realized.  This suggests that congestion happens at a\n   much\
    \ later time than the misconfiguration and can then not easily be\n   correlated\
    \ with the cause anymore.\n   Because routers supporting RGMP are not required\
    \ to send RGMP Join or\n   Leave messages for groups 224.0.0.x (x=0...255), 224.0.1.39\
    \ and\n   224.0.1.40, RGMP enabled ports always need to receive traffic for\n\
    \   these groups.  Traffic for other groups is initially not forwarded to\n  \
    \ an RGMP enabled port.\n   RGMP Join and Leave messages are accepted if they\
    \ arrive on an RGMP\n   enabled port, otherwise they will be discarded.  Upon\
    \ acceptance of\n   an RGMP Join message, the switch MUST start forwarding traffic\
    \ for\n   the group to the port.  Upon acceptance of an RGMP Leave message, the\n\
    \   switch SHOULD stop forwarding traffic for the group to that port.\n   The\
    \ switch's ability to stop forwarding traffic for a group may be\n   limited,\
    \ for example, because of destination MAC based forwarding in\n   the switch.\
    \  Therefore, it is necessary for the switch to always\n   forward traffic for\
    \ all MAC-ambiguous IPv4 multicast groups (see [6]\n   for MAC-ambiguity).\n \
    \  To stop forwarding of traffic to a group in the event of lost RGMP\n   Leave\
    \ message(s), a switch MAY time out RGMP forwarding state on a\n   port for a\
    \ group [5 * Join Interval] after the last RGMP Join for\n   that group has been\
    \ received on the port.\n   Without any layer 2 IPv4 multicast filtering methods\
    \ running, a\n   switch needs to flood multicast traffic to all ports.  If a switch\n\
    \   does actually run one or more mechanisms beside RGMP to filter IPv4\n   multicast\
    \ traffic, such as IGMP snooping [10], then by default it\n   will not flood IPv4\
    \ multicast traffic to all ports anymore.  Instead,\n   the switch will try to\
    \ determine which ports still needs to receive\n   all IPv4 multicast traffic\
    \ by default, and which ports do not.\n   Compliance with this specification requires\
    \ that a switch MUST be\n   able to elect a port for flooding through the presence\
    \ of PIM Hello\n   messages [4] arriving from the port and also through a manual\n\
    \   configuration option.  In addition, the switch SHOULD recognize a\n   port\
    \ connected to a router by other appropriate protocol packets or\n   dedicated\
    \ IPv4 multicast router discovery mechanisms such as MRDISC\n   [11].  The manual\
    \ configuration is required to support routers not\n   supporting PIM or other\
    \ methods recognized by the switch.\n   Further mechanisms for IPv4 multicast\
    \ traffic restriction may also be\n   used on RGMP enabled ports.  In this case,\
    \ forwarding for a group on\n   the port must be established if either mechanism\
    \ requires it, and it\n   must only be removed if no mechanism requires it anymore.\n"

- title: 4.1. Support for networks with multiple switches
  contents:
  - "4.1. Support for networks with multiple switches\n   To be simple to implement\
    \ on switches and resilient in face of\n   potential layer 2 network topology\
    \ changes, RGMP does not specify how\n   to restrict multicast traffic on links\
    \ connecting switches amongst\n   each other.  With just RGMP being used, multicast\
    \ traffic will thus\n   be flooded on inter-switch links within a network if at\
    \ least one\n   router is connected to each of the switches.\n   This happens\
    \ implicitly because the switch will not flood/forward\n   received RGMP messages\
    \ out to the inter-switch link and thus the\n   switch on the other end will only\
    \ recognize the port as a router port\n   via the PIM Hello messages flooded by\
    \ the switches.  Manual\n   configuration for inter-switch links may be required\
    \ if non-PIM\n   routers are being used, depending on the other capabilities of\
    \ the\n   switch.\n   If appropriate, a switch can send out RGMP messages on ports\
    \ to make\n   it look like an RGMP enabled router to a potential switch at the\n\
    \   other end of the link.  This would constrain IPv4 multicast traffic\n   between\
    \ switches, but this type of \"RGMP Spoofing\" by the switch is\n   outside the\
    \ scope of this specification.\n"
- title: 4.2. Interoperability with RGMP-incapable routers
  contents:
  - "4.2. Interoperability with RGMP-incapable routers\n   Since RGMP messages received\
    \ at a switch only affect the state of\n   their ingress ports, the traffic restriction\
    \ is applied there only.\n   RGMP-incapable routers will receive multicast traffic\
    \ for all\n   multicast groups.\n"
- title: 4.3. RGMP and multicast routing protocols
  contents:
  - "4.3. RGMP and multicast routing protocols\n   One result of the simplicity of\
    \ RGMP are its restrictions in\n   supporting specific routing protocols.  The\
    \ following paragraphs list\n   a few known restrictions.\n   A router running\
    \ RGMP on a switched network will not receive traffic\n   for a multicast group\
    \ unless it explicitly requests it via RGMP Join\n   messages (besides those group\
    \ ranges specified to be flooded in 3.1).\n   For this reason, it is not possible\
    \ to run a protocol like PIM\n   Dense-Mode or DVMRP across an RGMP enabled network\
    \ with RGMP enabled\n   routers.\n   In Bidir-PIM, a router elected to be the\
    \ DF must not be enabled for\n   RGMP on the network, because it unconditionally\
    \ needs to forward\n   traffic received from the network towards the RP.  If a\
    \ router is not\n   the DF for any group on the network, it can be enabled for\
    \ RGMP on\n   that network.\n   In PIM-SM, directly connected sources on the network\
    \ can not be\n   supported if the elected DR is running RGMP, because this DR\
    \ needs to\n   unconditionally receive traffic from directly connected sources\
    \ to\n   trigger the PIM-SM registering process on the DR.  In PIM-SSM,\n   directly\
    \ connected sources can be supported with RGMP enabled\n   routers.\n   Both in\
    \ PIM-SM and PIM-SSM, upstream routers forwarding traffic into\n   the switched\
    \ network need to send RGMP Joins for the group in support\n   of the PIM assert\
    \ process.\n"

- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   The RGMP protocol assumes that physical port security\
    \ can be\n   guaranteed for switch ports from which RGMP messages are accepted.\n\
    \   Physical port security for RGMP means that physical measures will\n   ensure\
    \ that such ports are dedicatedly connected to one system which\n   acts as an\
    \ RGMP capable router.  This is also the recommended\n   configuration to best\
    \ leverage the benefits of the RGMP protocol\n   (e.g., avoiding unwanted third-party\
    \ IPv4 multicast traffic arriving\n   on said ports).\n   RGMP specific DoS attacks\
    \ arise from forged RGMP messages.  If more\n   than one system is connected to\
    \ a port of the RGMP switch, then one\n   system may forge RGMP messages and affect\
    \ the operations of the other\n   system(s) on the same port.  This is a potential\
    \ security risk.\n   When physical security ensures that only one system is connected\
    \ to a\n   RGMP capable port on a switch, then forged messages from this system\n\
    \   itself can take effect.  Such forged messages can always be avoided\n   by\
    \ system local measures.\n   We consider the ramifications of a forged message\
    \ of each type:\n   Hello Message:\n      A forged RGMP Hello message can restrict\
    \ multicast data towards a\n      non-RGMP enabled router on the same port.  This\
    \ effectively\n      introduces a blackholing DoS attack.\n   Leave Message:\n\
    \      A forged RGMP Leave message can restrict IPv4 multicast traffic\n     \
    \ for individual groups toward the port.  The effect is a possible\n      blackholing\
    \ DoS attack similar to an RGMP Hello Message except\n      that it does not affect\
    \ all IPv4 multicast traffic but only that\n      of the groups indicated in the\
    \ forged messages.  It will also only\n      affect a port if there officially\
    \ is only one RGMP enabled router\n      connected to it (i.e., if the port is\
    \ RGMP enabled).\n   Bye Message:\n      A forged RGMP Bye message can turn the\
    \ port into being\n      RGMP-disabled.  This could, indirectly, cause a DoS attack\
    \ based\n      on the port getting overloaded with IPv4 multicast traffic if the\n\
    \      network bandwidth of the port was provisioned with the expectation\n  \
    \    that RGMP will suppress unwanted IPv4 multicast messages.\n      This type\
    \ of DoS attack simply re-establishes a port behavior as\n      if RGMP was not\
    \ configured and invalidates the benefit of RGMP.\n      This, however, does not\
    \ introduce an issue that would not have\n      been there without RGMP in the\
    \ first place.\n   Join Message:\n      A forged RGMP Join message could attract\
    \ undesired multicast\n      packets to the port where it is received from.  The\
    \ effect is\n      similar to an RGMP Bye Message except that it does not affect\
    \ all\n      IPv4 multicast traffic only the groups indicated in the forged\n\
    \      messages. The message will affect a port only if there officially\n   \
    \   is only one RGMP enabled router connected to it (i.e., if the port\n     \
    \ is RGMP enabled).\n"

  - "Appendix B. Comparison with GARP/GMRP\n   This appendix is not part of the RGMP\
    \ specification but is provided\n   for information only.\n   GARP/GMRP (defined\
    \ in IEEE 802.1D [7]) is the ANSI/ISO/IEC/IEEE\n   protocol suite to constrain\
    \ ethernet multicast traffic in bridged\n   ethernet networks.  As such it is\
    \ also a possible alternative to RGMP\n   for the purpose of constraining multicast\
    \ traffic towards router\n   ports.  This appendix will explain the motivation\
    \ not to rely on\n   GARP/GMRP and how GARP/GMRP and RGMP differ.\n   The key\
    \ factor in rolling out GARP/GMRP would have been to completely\n   replace IGMP\
    \ Snooping.  This was the design goal of GARP/GMRP.  For\n   efficient operations,\
    \ IGMP Snooping requires hardware filtering\n   support in the switch (to differentiate\
    \ between hosts membership\n   reports and actual IPv4 multicast traffic).  Especially\
    \ in many older\n   switches this support does not exist.  Vendors tried to find\
    \ a way\n   around this issue to provide the benefit of constraining IPv4\n  \
    \ multicast traffic in a switched LAN without having to build more\n   expensive\
    \ switch hardware.  GARP/GMRP is one protocol resulting from\n   this.  CGMP from\
    \ Cisco is another one.  While CGMP solves the problem\n   without requiring changes\
    \ to the host stack software, GARP/GMRP\n   requires support for it by the host\
    \ stack.\n   Up to date GARP/GMRP has so far not made significant inroads into\n\
    \   deployed solutions.  IGMP Snooping (and CGMP) are the norm for this\n   environment.\
    \  In result, GARP/GMRP can not necessarily be expected to\n   be supported by\
    \ layer 2 switches.  In addition, GARP/GMRP does not\n   address clearly the issues\
    \ RGMP tries to solve.  On one hand,\n   GARP/GMRP provides much more functionality\
    \ and as such complexity as\n   immediately required.  On the other hand, GARP/GMRP\
    \ is limited by\n   being a standard predominantly for the Ethernet scope.\n \
    \  Beyond the process and applicability reasons, the main differences\n   between\
    \ GARP/GMRP and RGMP are as follows:\n   o  GARP/GMRP switches/systems need to\
    \ send and listen/react to\n      GARP/GMRP messages.  In RGMP, routers only need\
    \ to send RGMP\n      messages and switches only need to listen to them.  This\
    \ protocol\n      approach is meant to simplify implementation, operations and\n\
    \      troubleshooting.\n   o  The same switch running RGMP in a backbone network\
    \ will likely see\n      more states then running on the edge only doing IGMP\
    \ Snooping,\n      making it preferable to keep the amount of per group processing\n\
    \      and memory requirements in RGMP more in bounds than possible in\n     \
    \ IGMP Snooping and GARP/GMRP: In GARP/GMRP, a (multiple) timer\n      based state-machines\
    \ needs to be maintained on a per ethernet\n      group address, in RGMP timer\
    \ maintenance is completely optional\n      and there are only two states per\
    \ group (joined or not joined).\n   o  GARP/GMRP is an ethernet level protocol\
    \ from the IEEE.  It\n      supports to constrain traffic for ethernet addresses\
    \ (groups).\n      RGMP does constrain traffic for IPv4 multicast groups.  Today\
    \ this\n      is even beyond the capabilities of typical switch platforms used\n\
    \      as layer2 switches.  Extensions to support further entities are\n     \
    \ likely easier to come by through extensions to RGMP than to\n      GARP/GMRP.\n\
    \   o  RGMP shares the basic packet format with IGMP (version 2) and is\n    \
    \  as such easy to add to router and switch platforms that already\n      support\
    \ IGMP and IGMP Snooping respectively.  This is especially\n      true for switches\
    \ that in hardware can differentiate between IGMP\n      protocol type packets\
    \ and other IPv4 multicast traffic sent to the\n      same (or a MAC ambiguous)\
    \ group.  In addition, due to the state\n      simplicity of RGMP it is easy to\
    \ integrate IGMP Snooping and RGMP\n      operations in the IPv4 multicast control\
    \ and forwarding plane of a\n      switch.\n   o  GARP/GMRP supports more than\
    \ one system (host/router) on a switch\n      port which is one reason for its\
    \ complexity.  In RGMP, this\n      configuration is explicitly not supported:\
    \  More than one router\n      per switched port is not only not a common scenario\
    \ in today's\n      switches layer 2 networks, it is also an undesired configuration\n\
    \      when unwanted IPv4 multicast traffic is to be kept away from\n      routers.\n\
    \   o  GARP/GMRP defines how to constrain multicast traffic between\n      switches,\
    \ another reason for its complexity.  RGMP does not\n      explicitly support\
    \ this as part of the protocol because of the\n      following reasons:\n    \
    \  o  It is not necessary to include this function as part of the\n         RGMP\
    \ protocol description because switch implementations can\n         transparently\
    \ decide to support this function (see 4.1 about\n         this \"RGMP Spoofing\"\
    ).\n      o  Important deployments through which large amounts of IPv4\n     \
    \    multicast are moved today are typically single switch\n         MIX - Multicast\
    \ Internet eXchange points.\n      o  Avoiding congestion on inter-switch links\
    \ in general is more\n         complex than simply constraining IPv4 multicast\
    \ traffic to\n         paths where it is needed.  With or without IPv4 multicast,\
    \ the\n         aggregate bandwidth needed between switches can easily be the\n\
    \         aggregate required bandwidth to routers on either sides.  For\n    \
    \     this reason, inter-switch bandwidth is most often appropriately\n      \
    \   over provisioned.  In addition, the likelihood for receiving\n         routers\
    \ to be only on the sources side of an inter-switch link\n         is in general\
    \ deployments rather low.  The cases where traffic\n         constrainment on\
    \ inter-switch links is required and helpful is\n         thus limited and can\
    \ in most cases be avoided or worked around.\n         Moving the network to a\
    \ layer 3 routed network is often the\n         best solution, supporting RGMP-Spoofing\
    \ (see section 4.1) is\n         another one.\n"
- title: Appendix C. Possible future extensions / comparison to PIM Snooping
  contents:
  - "Appendix C. Possible future extensions / comparison to PIM Snooping\n   This\
    \ appendix is not part of the RGMP specification but is provided\n   for information\
    \ only.\n   This appendix presents a discussion of possible extensions to RGMP.\n\
    \   Included are points on why the extensions are not included and in\n   addition\
    \ a motivation for RGMP in comparison to (PIM) snooping.\n   o  Support for multiple\
    \ switches\n      As discussed in \"RGMP Spoofing\", chapter 4.1 and GARP/GMRP\n\
    \      comparison in Appendix B.\n   o  Support for SSM\n      While RGMP works\
    \ with PIM-SSM, it does not have explicit messages\n      for the router to selectively\
    \ join to (S,G) channels individually.\n      Instead the router must RGMP join\
    \ to all (Si,G) channels by\n      joining to G.  Extending RGMP to include (S,G)\
    \ Join/Leaves is\n      feasible.  However, currently the majority of switches\
    \ do not\n      support actual traffic constraining on a per channel basis.  In\n\
    \      addition, the likelihood for actual channel collision (two SSM\n      channels\
    \ using the same group) will only become an issue when SSM\n      is fully deployed.\n\
    \   o  Support for IPv6\n      RGMP could easily be extended to support IPv6 by\
    \ mapping the RGMP\n      packet format into the MLD/IPv6 packet format.  This\
    \ was not done\n      for this specification because most switches today do not\
    \ even\n      support MLD snooping.\n   o  Support for multiple routers per port\n\
    \      As discussed in Appendix B.  This is probably one extension that\n    \
    \  should be avoided.  Multiple RGMP router per port are\n      inappropriate\
    \ for efficient multicast traffic constrainment.\n   o  Support for non-join based\
    \ protocols / protocol elements\n      For protocols like PIM dense-mode, DVMRP\
    \ or Bidir-PIM DF routers,\n      additional RGMP messages may be added to allow\
    \ routers to indicate\n      that certain group (ranges) traffic need to be flooded\
    \ from\n      (dense-mode) or to (Bidir-PIM) them.\n   o  Support for multi-policy\
    \ switching\n      In Multicast Exchange Points (MIXes) environments situations\
    \ exist\n      where different downstream routers for policy reasons need to\n\
    \      receive the same traffic flow from different upstream routers.\n      This\
    \ problem could be solved by actually providing an upstream\n      neighbor field\
    \ in RGMP Join/Leave messages.  The RGMP switch would\n      then forward traffic\
    \ from one upstream router only to those\n      downstream routers who want to\
    \ have the traffic from exactly this\n      upstream router.  This extension would\
    \ best go in hand with\n      changes to the layer 3 routing protocol run between\
    \ the routers.\n   As previously mentioned, RGMP was designed to be easy to implement\n\
    \   and to support simple layer2 switches.  Implementations could also be\n  \
    \ applied to switches beyond layer 2.  If all the above possible future\n   extensions\
    \ were to be supported by an evolution of RGMP, it would be\n   questionable whether\
    \ such a protocol could be any less complex than\n   actually snooping into the\
    \ layer3 IPv4 routing protocol run between\n   routers in a switched LAN.\n  \
    \ From the perspective of protocol architecture it is certainly more\n   appropriate\
    \ to have a separate protocol like RGMP or GARP/GMRP for\n   this purpose.  Then\
    \ again, the more complex the requirements are, the\n   more duplication of effort\
    \ is involved and snooping seems to become a\n   more attractive option.\n   Even\
    \ though there exists one predominant routing Protocol, PIM, in\n   IPv4 multicast,\
    \ routing with PIM in itself is extremely complex for a\n   switch to snoop into.\
    \  PIM has two main versions, different\n   modes - sparse, dense, bidir, ssm,\
    \ join / prune / graft messages\n   (depending on the mode of the group), various\
    \ PIM Hello options,\n   different versions of asserts, two dynamic mode announcement\n\
    \   protocols (BSR, AutoRP), and finally supports both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   A switch\
    \ snooping into PIM is very likely to implement just a subset\n   of this feature\
    \ set, making it very hard for the user to determine\n   what level of actual\
    \ traffic constrainment is achieved unless a clear\n   specification exists for\
    \ the implementation (or better the method per\n   se.).  In addition, there is\
    \ always the danger that such a snooping\n   implementation may break newer features\
    \ of the routing protocol that\n   it was not designed to handle (likely because\
    \ they could not have\n   been predicted).  For example, this can happen with\
    \ switches using\n   IGMP (v2) snooping implementations that are being subjected\
    \ to IGMP\n   version 3 messages - they break IGMPv3.\n   In summary, with PIM\
    \ still evolving, the approach taken by RGMP is\n   the safest one for the immediate\
    \ problems at hand, and extensions\n   like those listed should be considered\
    \ in time for actual demand.\n   (PIM) snooping is a valid alternative once the\
    \ total amount of\n   features that need to be supported makes it an equally attractive\n\
    \   solution (with respect to complexity) to a dedicated protocol and if\n   its\
    \ functions are well defined to allow predicting its effects - but\n   always\
    \ at the price of possible incompatibilities with upcoming PIM\n   protocol extensions\
    \ unless support for layer 2 switches is explicitly\n   considered in moving PIM\
    \ protocols forward.\n"
