- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This RFC documents an experimental protocol providing a Type of\n\
    \   Service (TOS) to request maximum physical link security.  This is an\n   addition\
    \ to the types of service enumerated in RFC 1349: Type of\n   Service in the Internet\
    \ Protocol Suite.  The new TOS requests the\n   network to provide what protection\
    \ it can against surreptitious\n   observation by outside agents of traffic so\
    \ labeled.  The purpose is\n   protection against traffic analysis and as an additional\
    \ possible\n   level of data confidentiality.  This TOS is consistent with all\
    \ other\n   defined types of service for IP version 4 in that it is based on link\n\
    \   level characteristics and will not provide any particular guaranteed\n   level\
    \ of service.\n"
- title: 1. Nature of Requirement
  contents:
  - "1. Nature of Requirement\n   This Internet Protocol addition addresses two potential\
    \ security\n   requirements: resistance to traffic analysis and confidentiality.\n\
    \   These are described in the two subsections below followed by a\n   discussion\
    \ of why links have different levels of physical security so\n   that it is meaningful\
    \ to request that more secure links be used.\n"
- title: 1.1 Traffic Analysis
  contents:
  - "1.1 Traffic Analysis\n   At this time all Internet Protocol (IP) packets must\
    \ have most of\n   their header information, including the \"from\" and \"to\"\
    \ addresses, in\n   the clear.  This is required for routers to properly handle\
    \ the\n   traffic even if a higher level protocol fully encrypts all bytes in\n\
    \   the packet after the IP header.  This renders even end-to-end\n   encrypted\
    \ IP packets subject to traffic analysis if the data stream\n   can be observed.\
    \  While traffic statistics are normally less\n   sensitive than the data content\
    \ of packets, in some cases activities\n   of hosts or users are deducible from\
    \ traffic information.\n   It is essential that routers have access to header\
    \ information, so it\n   is hard to protect traffic statistics from an adversary\
    \ with inside\n   access to the network.  However, use of more secure physical\
    \ links\n   will make traffic observation by entities outside of the network more\n\
    \   difficult thus improving protection from traffic analysis.\n   No doubt users\
    \ would like to be able to request a guaranteed level of\n   link security, just\
    \ as they would like to be able to request a\n   guaranteed bandwidth or delay\
    \ through the network.  However, such\n   guarantees require a resource reservation\
    \ and/or policy routing\n   scheme and are beyond the scope of the current IP\
    \ Type of Service\n   facility.\n   Although the TOS field is provided in all\
    \ current Internet packets\n   and routing based on TOS is provided in routing\
    \ protocols such as\n   OSPF [See 5,6,7], there is no realistic chance that all\
    \ of the\n   Internet will implement this additional TOS any time in the\n   foreseeable\
    \ future.  Nevertheless, users concerned about traffic\n   analysis need to be\
    \ able to request that the physical security of the\n   links over which their\
    \ packets will be pass be maximized in\n   preference to other link characteristics.\
    \  The proposed TOS provides\n   this capability.\n"
- title: 1.2 Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "1.2 Confidentiality\n   Use of physical links with greater physical security\
    \ provides a layer\n   of protection for the confidentiality of the data in the\
    \ packets as\n   well as traffic analysis protection.  If the content of the packets\n\
    \   are otherwise protected by end-to-end encryption, using secure links\n   makes\
    \ it harder for an external adversary to obtain the encrypted\n   data to attack.\
    \  If the content of the packets is unencrypted plain\n   text, secure links may\
    \ provide the only protection of data\n   confidentiality.\n   There are cases\
    \ where end-to-end encryption can not be used.\n   Examples include paths which\
    \ incorporate links within nations which\n   restrict encryption, such as France\
    \ or Australia, and paths which\n   incorporate an amateur radio link, where encryption\
    \ is prohibited.\n   In these cases, link security is generally the only type\
    \ of\n   confidentiality available.  The proposed TOS will provide a way of\n\
    \   requesting the best that the network can do for the security of such\n   unencrypted\
    \ data.\n   This TOS is required for improved confidentiality, especially in\n\
    \   cases where encryption can not be used, despite the fact that it does\n  \
    \ not provide the guarantees that many users would like.  See\n   discussion at\
    \ the end of the Traffic Analysis section above.\n"
- title: 1.3 Link Physical Security Characteristics
  contents:
  - "1.3 Link Physical Security Characteristics\n   Physical links, which are composed\
    \ of lines and routers, differ\n   widely in their susceptibility to surreptitious\
    \ observation of the\n   information flowing over them.  For examples of line\
    \ security see the\n   following list:\n      1) Land line media is usually harder\
    \ to intercept than radio\n         broadcast media.\n      2) Between different\
    \ radio broadcast media, spread spectrum or\n         other low probability of\
    \ intercept systems, are harder to\n         intercept than normal broadcast systems.\
    \  At the other extreme,\n         systems with a large footprint on the earth,\
    \ such as some\n         satellite down links, may be particularly accessible.\n\
    \      3) Between land lines, point to point systems are generally harder\n  \
    \       to intercept than multi-point systems such as Ethernet or FDDI.\n    \
    \  4) Fiber optic land lines are generally harder to intercept than\n        \
    \ metallic paths because fiber is harder to tap.\n      5) A secure land line,\
    \ such as one in pressurized conduit with\n         pressure alarms or one installed\
    \ so as to be observable by\n         guards, is harder to intercept than an unsecured\
    \ land line.\n      6) An encrypted link would be preferable to an unencrypted\
    \ link\n         because, even if it was accessed, it would be much more\n   \
    \      difficult to obtain any useful information.\n   Routers also have different\
    \ levels of security against interception\n   depending on the physical security\
    \ of the router site and the like.\n   The above comparisons show that there are\
    \ significant real\n   differences between the security of the physical links\
    \ in use in the\n   Internet.  Choosing links where it is hard for an outside\
    \ observer to\n   observe the traffic improves confidentiality and protection\
    \ against\n   traffic analysis.\n"
- title: 2. Protocol Specification
  contents:
  - "2. Protocol Specification\n   The value 15 decimal (F hex) in the four-bit Type\
    \ of Service IP\n   header field requests routing the packet to minimize the chance\
    \ of\n   surreptitious observation of its contents by agents external to the\n\
    \   network.  (This value is chosen to be at the maximum hamming distance\n  \
    \ from the existing other TOS values.)\n"
- title: 3. Protocol Implementation
  contents:
  - "3. Protocol Implementation\n   This TOS can be implemented in routing systems\
    \ that offer TOS based\n   routing (as can be done with OSPF, see RFCs 1245 through\
    \ 1247) by\n   assigning costs to links.  Establishing the \"cost\" for different\n\
    \   links for this TOS is a local policy function.\n   In principle services are\
    \ incomparable when criterion such as those\n   given in the Nature of Requirement\
    \ section above conflict.  For\n   example, a choice between an encrypted broadcast\
    \ system and an\n   unencrypted fiber optic land line.  In practice, link encryption\n\
    \   would probably dominate all other forms of protection and physical\n   security\
    \ as mentioned in criterion 5 above would dominate other land\n   line distinctions.\n\
    \   An example of \"costs\" at a hypothetical router could be as follows:\n  \
    \         Cost    Type\n            1      Strong encryption with secure key distribution\n\
    \            2      Physically secure point-to-point line\n            6     \
    \ Typical point-to-point line\n            8      Typical local multi-point media\n\
    \           12      Metropolitan area multi-point media\n           24      Local\
    \ radio broadcast\n           32      Satellite link\n   Link costs should be\
    \ chosen so as to be in the same ratio as the\n   probability of interception.\
    \  Thus the above example costs imply a\n   local policy assumption that interception\
    \ is 32 times more likely on\n   a satellite link and associated router than on\
    \ a strongly encrypted\n   line and its associated router.  It is not necessary\
    \ to estimate the\n   absolute probability of interception on any particular link.\
    \  It is\n   sufficient to estimate the ratio between interception probabilities\n\
    \   on different links.\n   It should be noted that using costs such as the example\
    \ given above\n   could result in using many more links than if the default type\
    \ of\n   service were requested.  For example, the use of over 50 highly\n   secure\
    \ links could be better than using two insecure links, such as\n   an unencrypted\
    \ satellite hop and radio link.  However, if the costs\n   have been properly\
    \ set in proportion to the probability of\n   interception, this larger number\
    \ of links will be more secure than\n   the shorter default routing.  This consideration\
    \ should make it clear\n   why it is necessary to estimate router security as\
    \ well as link\n   security.  An excessive cost ratio based solely on the security\
    \ of a\n   communications line could cause packets to go through many routers\n\
    \   which were less secure than the lines in question.  This necessity to\n  \
    \ take router characteristics into account is also present for all\n   other defined\
    \ TOS values.\n   It should also be noted that routing algorithms typically compute\
    \ the\n   sum of the costs of the links.  For this particular type of service,\n\
    \   the product of the link probabilities of secure transmission would be\n  \
    \ more appropriate.  However, the same problem is present for the high\n   reliability\
    \ TOS and the use of a sum is an adequate approximation for\n   most uses as noted\
    \ in RFC 1349.\n"
