Abstract This document reclassifies several TCP extensions that have never seen widespread use to Historic status.
The affected RFCs are RFC 1072, RFC 1106, RFC 1110, RFC 1145, RFC 1146, RFC 1379, RFC 1644, and RFC 1693.
Introduction TCP has a long history, and several proposed TCP extensions have never seen widespread deployment.
Section 5 of the TCP "roadmap" document [RFC4614] already classifies a number of TCP extensions as Historic and describes the reasons for doing so, but it does not instruct the RFC Editor and IANA to change the status of these RFCs in the RFC database and the relevant IANA registries.
The sole purpose of this document is to do just that.
Please refer to Section 5 of [RFC4614] for justification.
RFC Editor Considerations Per this document
, the RFC Editor has changed the status of the following RFCs to Historic
[RFC1072] on "TCP Extensions for Long Delay Paths"  [RFC1106] and [RFC1110] related to the "TCP Big Window and Nak Options"  [RFC1145] and [RFC1146] related to the "TCP Alternate Checksum Options"  [RFC1379] and [RFC1644] on "T/TCP   Extensions for Transactions Functional Specification"  [RFC1693] on "An Extension to TCP : Partial Order Service" 3.
IANA Considerations IANA has marked the TCP options 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 documented in [RFC1072], [RFC1146], [RFC1644], and [RFC1693] as "obsolete" in the "TCP Option Kind Numbers" registry [TCPOPTREG], with a reference to this RFC.
Security Considerations As mentioned in [RFC4614], the TCP Extensions for Transactions (T/TCP)
[RFC1379][RFC1644] are reported to have security issues [DEVIVO].
