  - "1.  Introduction\n   Per [RFC3471], Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS)\n   allows the inclusion of technology-specific parameters in signaling.\n
    \  This document introduces Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC-specific\n   objects
    in support of Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet traffic\n   parameters as specified
    in [MEF10.1] and ITU-T Ethernet Service\n   Switching as discussed in [RFC6004].
    \ For example:\n   o  For Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services [MEF6], these traffic\n
    \     parameters are applicable to each Ethernet Virtual Connection\n      (EVC)
    crossing a given port.\n   o  For Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) services
    [MEF6], these\n      traffic parameters are applicable per Ethernet Virtual Connection\n
    \     (EVC) with a single or multiple Class of Service (CoS),\n      independent
    of its associated Virtual LAN ID (VID) or set of VIDs.\n      Association between
    EVC and VIDs is detailed in [MEF10.1].  The\n      format and encoding of the
    VID (or set of VIDs) is documented in a\n      companion document [RFC6004].\n
    \  This does not preclude broader usage of the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and\n   FLOWSPEC-specific
    objects specified this document.  For instance,\n   they may also be used for
    signaling Ethernet Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs), in the Generalized Label Request
    (see [RFC3471]), the\n   Switching Type field is set to Layer 2 Switching Capability
    (L2SC)\n   and the LSP Encoding Type field to Ethernet.\n"

  - "3.  Overview\n   In GMPLS RSVP-TE [RFC3473], the SENDER_TSPEC object is used
    on a Path\n   message to indicate the bandwidth that is requested for the LSP
    being\n   established, and the FLOWSPEC object is used on a Resv message to\n
    \  indicate the bandwidth actually reserved for the LSP.  The Ethernet\n   SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC
    object includes the Ethernet link type\n   (switching granularity) of the requested
    LSP and the MTU value for\n   the LSP.  Other information about the requested
    bandwidth\n   characteristics of the LSP are carried in the Bandwidth Profile
    as a\n   TLV within the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object.\n   The Ethernet
    SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object includes the Ethernet link\n   type (switching granularity)
    of the requested LSP and the MTU value\n   for the LSP.\n   The Bandwidth Profile
    defines the set of traffic parameters\n   applicable to a sequence of Service
    Frames, referred to as bandwidth\n   profile parameters (as specified in [MEF10.1]):\n
    \  o  Committed Rate: indicates the rate at which traffic commits to be\n      sent
    to the Ethernet LSP.  The committed rate is described in\n      terms of the CIR
    (Committed Information Rate) and CBS (Committed\n      Burst Size) traffic parameters.\n
    \     o  CIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time)\n         up
    to which the network is committed to transfer frames and\n         meets its performance
    objectives.\n      o  CBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information
    units\n         (e.g., bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the\n         interface
    speed to remain CIR-conformant.\n   o  Excess Rate: indicates the extent by which
    the traffic sent on an\n      Ethernet LSP exceeds the committed rate.  The Excess
    Rate is\n      described in terms of the EIR (Excess Information Rate) and EBS\n
    \     (Excess Burst Size) traffic parameters.\n      o  EIR is defined as the
    average rate (in bytes per unit of time),\n         in excess of the CIR, up to
    which the network may transfer\n         frames without any performance objectives.\n
    \     o  EBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units\n         (e.g.,
    bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the\n         interface speed to
    remain EIR-conformant.\n   o  Color mode (CM): indicates whether the \"color-aware\"
    or \"color-\n      blind\" property is employed by the bandwidth profile.\n   o
    \ Coupling flag (CF): allows the choice between two modes of\n      operation
    of the rate enforcement algorithm.\n"

      \  Profile: 8 bits\n      This field is defined as a bit vector of binary flags.
      \ The\n      following flags are defined:\n         Flag 1 (bit 0): Coupling
      Flag (CF)\n         Flag 2 (bit 1): Color Mode (CM)\n      Where bit 0 is the
      low order bit.  Other flags are reserved, they\n      SHOULD be set to zero
      when sent, and SHOULD be ignored when\n      received.\n      A flag is set
      to value 1 to indicate that the corresponding\n      metering profile is requested.\n
      \     The Flag 1 (CF) allows the choice between two modes of operation\n      of
      the rate enforcement algorithm.\n      The Flag 2 (CM) indicates whether the
      color-aware or color-blind\n      property [MEF10.2] is employed by the bandwidth
      profile.  When\n      Flag 2 is set to value 0 (1), the bandwidth profile algorithm
      is\n      said to be in color-blind (color-aware) mode.\n   Index: 8 bits\n
      \     The Index field is used to reference bandwidth allocated for a\n      given
      traffic class in case a multiple-class LSP is being\n      requested.  The Index
      field value MUST correspond to at least one\n      of the Class-Type values
      included either in the CLASSTYPE object\n      [RFC4124] or in the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE
      object [MCOS].\n      A given index value j can be associated to at most N Class-Type\n
      \     values CTi (i =< N) of the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object.  This\n      association
      applies when a set of one or more CTIs maps to a\n      single (shared) BW profile.
      \ An example of value setting consists\n      in assigning an arbitrary value
      comprised within the range\n      [0x08,0xF8] associated to a set of CTi, the
      values in the range\n      [0xF8,0xFF] being selected for reserved sets.  This
      allows mapping\n      to one of 248 predefined CTi sets.\n      A given index
      value j can be associated to a single CTi (1:1\n      correspondence).  In this
      case, the index value setting consists\n      in assigning the 3 least significant
      bits of the Index field\n      itself to the CTi value itself (comprised in
      the range\n      [0x00,0x07]).  This applies in case a single CTi maps a single\n
      \     (dedicated) BW profile or multiple (dedicated) BW profiles.  In\n      the
      former case, the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object includes a\n      single Ethernet
      Bandwidth Profile TLV.  In the latter case, the\n      Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC
      includes a set of more than one Ethernet\n      Bandwidth Profile TLVs (whose
      respective index value is associated\n      to a single CTi value).\n      Note
      that the current specification allows for combining shared\n      and dedicated
      BW profiles to the same LSP.  That is, an Ethernet\n      SENDER_TSPEC object
      MAY include multiple Ethernet Bandwidth\n      Profile TLVs whose respective
      index can be associated on a 1:1\n      basis to a single CTi or to a set of
      multiple CTis.\n      For each subobject of the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object [MCOS]:\n
      \        o  Each CTi value SHOULD correspond 1:1 to the MEF Customer\n            Edge
      VLAN CoS (CE-VLAN CoS).\n         o  The BW requested per CTi field MAY be used
      for bandwidth\n            accounting purposes.\n      By default, the value
      of the Index field MUST be set to 0.\n   Reserved: 16 bits\n      These bits
      SHOULD be set to zero when sent and MUST be ignored\n      when received.\n
      \  CIR (Committed Information Rate): 32 bits\n      The value of the CIR is
      in units of bytes per second.  The CIR is\n      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision
      floating-point number\n      (see [RFC4506]).\n      The CIR value MUST be greater
      than or equal to 0.\n   CBS (Committed Burst Size): 32 bits\n      The value
      of the CBS is in units of bytes.  The CBS is encoded as\n      a 32-bit IEEE
      single-precision floating-point number (see\n      [RFC4506]).\n      When CIR
      is strictly greater than 0 (CIR > 0), the CBS MUST be\n      greater than or
      equal to the maximum frame size.\n   EIR (Excess Information Rate): 32 bits\n
      \     The value of the EIR is in units of bytes per second.  The EIR is\n      encoded
      as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number\n      (see [RFC4506]).\n
      \     The EIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0.\n   EBS (Excess Burst
      Size): 32 bits\n      The value of the EBS is in units of bytes.  The EBS is
      encoded as\n      a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see\n
      \     [RFC4506]).\n      When EIR is strictly greater than 0 (EIR > 0), the
