  - "Abstract\n   This document recommends the retirement of version 2 of the\n  \
    \ Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPv2) and other dependent\n   specifications,\
    \ and discusses the reasons for doing so.  This\n   document recommends RFC 1777,\
    \ 1778, 1779, 1781, and 2559 (as well as\n   documents they superseded) be moved\
    \ to Historic status.\n"
- title: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, version 2
  contents:
  - "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, version 2\n   LDAPv2 (Lightweight Directory\
    \ Access Protocol, version 2)\n   [RFC1777][RFC1778][RFC1779] is an Internet Protocol\
    \ used to access\n   X.500-based directory services.  This document recommends\
    \ that LDAPv2\n   and other dependent specifications be retired.  Specifically,\
    \ this\n   document recommends RFC 1777, 1778, 1779, 1781, and 2559 (as well as\n\
    \   documents they superseded) be moved to Historic status.  The reasons\n   for\
    \ taking this action are discussed below.\n   LDAPv2 was published in 1995 as\
    \ a Draft Standard.  Since its\n   publication, a number of inadequacies in the\
    \ specification have been\n   discovered.  LDAPv3 [RFC3377] was published in 1997\
    \ as a Proposed\n   Standard to resolve these inadequacies.  While LDAPv3 is currently\n\
    \   being revised [LDAPbis], it is clearly technically superior to\n   LDAPv2.\n\
    \   The LDAPv2 specification is not generally adhered to; that is, an\n   independently\
    \ developed implementation of the specification would not\n   interoperate with\
    \ existing implementations, as existing\n   implementations use syntaxes and semantics\
    \ different than those\n   prescribed by the specification.  Below are two examples.\n\
    \      1) Existing LDAPv2 implementations do not commonly restrict\n         textual\
    \ values to IA5 (ASCII) and T.61 (Teletex) as required by\n         RFC 1777 and\
    \ RFC 1778.  Some existing implementations use ISO\n         8859-1, others use\
    \ UCS-2, others use UTF-8, and some use the\n         current local character\
    \ set.\n      2) RFC 1777 requires use of the textual string associated with\n\
    \         AttributeType in the X.500 Directory standards.  However,\n        \
    \ existing implementations use the NAME associated with the\n         AttributeType\
    \ in the LDAPv3 schema [RFC2252].  That is, LDAPv2\n         requires the organization\
    \ name attribute be named\n         \"organizationName\", not \"o\".\n   In addition,\
    \ LDAPv2 does not provide adequate security features for\n   use on the Internet.\
    \  LDAPv2 does not provide any mechanism for data\n   integrity or confidentiality.\
    \  LDAPv2 does not support modern\n   authentication mechanisms such as those\
    \ based on DIGEST-MD5, Kerberos\n   V, and X.509 public keys.\n"
- title: Dependent Specifications
  contents:
  - "Dependent Specifications\n   Since the publication of RFC 1777, 1778, and 1779,\
    \ there have been\n   additional standard track RFCs published that are dependent\
    \ on these\n   technical specifications, including:\n      \"Using the OSI Directory\
    \ to Achieve User Friendly Naming\"\n      [RFC1781]\n         and\n      \"Internet\
    \ X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Operational Protocols -\n      LDAPv2\" [RFC2559].\n\
    \   RFC 1781 is a technical specification for \"User Friendly Naming\"\n   which\
    \ replies on particular syntaxes described in RFC 1779.  RFC\n   2253, which replaced\
    \ RFC 1779, eliminated support for the \"User\n   Friendly Naming\" syntaxes.\
    \  RFC 1781 is currently a Proposed\n   Standard.\n   RFC 2559 is primarily an\
    \ applicability statement for using LDAPv2 in\n   providing Public Key Infrastructure.\
    \  It depends on RFC 1777 and\n   updates RFC 1778.  If LDAPv2 is moved to Historic\
    \ status, so must\n   this document.  RFC 2559 is currently a Proposed Standard.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   LDAPv2 does not provide adequate security mechanisms\
    \ for general use\n   on the Internet.  LDAPv3 offers far superior security mechanisms,\n\
    \   including support for strong authentication and data confidentiality\n   services.\
    \  Moving LDAPv2 to Historic may improve the security of the\n   Internet by encouraging\
    \ implementation and use of LDAPv3.\n"
- title: Recommendations
  contents:
  - "Recommendations\n   Developers should not implement LDAPv2 per RFC 1777, as such\
    \ would\n   result in an implementation that will not interoperate with existing\n\
    \   LDAPv2 implementations.  Developers should implement LDAPv3 instead.\n   Deployers\
    \ should recognize that significant interoperability issues\n   exist between\
    \ current LDAPv2 implementations.  LDAPv3 is clearly\n   technically superior\
    \ to LDAPv2 and hence should be used instead.\n   It is recommended that RFC 1777,\
    \ RFC 1778, RFC 1779, RFC 1781, and\n   RFC 2559 be moved to Historic status.\n\
    \   The previously superseded specifications RFC 1484, 1485, 1487, and\n   1488\
    \ (by RFC 1781, 1779, 1777, and 1778, respectively) should also be\n   moved to\
    \ Historic status.\n"
