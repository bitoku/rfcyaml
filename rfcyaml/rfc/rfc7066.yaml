  - "Abstract\n   As the deployment of third and fourth generation cellular networks\n\
    \   progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to\n   the\
    \ Internet.  Standardization organizations have made the Internet\n   Protocol\
    \ version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications.\n   However, the concept\
    \ of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous\n   specifications.  In addition, the\
    \ characteristics of cellular links\n   in terms of bandwidth, cost, and delay\
    \ put special requirements on\n   how IPv6 is used.  This document considers IPv6\
    \ for cellular hosts\n   that attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS),\
    \ Universal\n   Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), or Evolved Packet System\n\
    \   (EPS) networks (hereafter collectively referred to as Third\n   Generation\
    \ Partnership Project (3GPP) networks).  This document also\n   lists specific\
    \ IPv6 functionalities that need to be implemented in\n   addition to what is\
    \ already prescribed in the IPv6 Node Requirements\n   document (RFC 6434).  It\
    \ also discusses some issues related to the\n   use of these components when operating\
    \ in these networks.  This\n   document obsoletes RFC 3316.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope of This Document\n   For the purpose of this document, a cellular\
    \ interface is considered\n   to be the interface to a cellular access network\
    \ based on the\n   following standards: 3GPP GPRS and UMTS Release-99 and Release-4\
    \ to\n   Release-11; EPS Release-8 to Release-11; and future UMTS or EPS\n   releases.\
    \  A cellular host is considered to be a host with such a\n   cellular interface.\n\
    \   This document complements the IPv6 Node Requirements [RFC6434] in\n   places\
    \ where clarifications are needed with discussion on the use of\n   these selected\
    \ IPv6 specifications when operating over a cellular\n   interface.  Such a specification\
    \ is necessary in order to enable the\n   optimal use of IPv6 in a cellular network\
    \ environment.  The\n   description is made from the point of view of a cellular\
    \ host.\n   Complementary access technologies may be supported by the cellular\n\
    \   host, but those are not discussed in detail.  Important\n   considerations\
    \ are given in order to eliminate unnecessary user\n   confusion over configuration\
    \ options, ensure interoperability, and\n   provide an easy reference for those\
    \ who are implementing IPv6 in a\n   cellular host.  It is necessary to ensure\
    \ that cellular hosts are\n   good citizens of the Internet.\n   This document\
    \ is informational in its nature, and it is not intended\n   to replace, update,\
    \ or contradict any IPv6 standards documents or the\n   IPv6 Node Requirements\
    \ [RFC6434].\n   This document is primarily targeted to the implementers of cellular\n\
    \   hosts that will be used with the cellular networks listed in this\n   document.\
    \  This document provides guidance on which IPv6-related\n   specifications are\
    \ to be implemented in such cellular hosts.  Parts\n   of this document may also\
    \ apply to other cellular link types, but\n   this document does not provide any\
    \ detailed analysis on other link\n   types.  This document should not be used\
    \ as a definitive list of IPv6\n   functionalities for cellular links other than\
    \ those listed above.\n   Future changes in 3GPP networks that impact host implementations\
    \ may\n   result in updates to this document.\n   There are different ways to\
    \ implement cellular hosts:\n   o  The host can be a \"closed\" device with optimized\
    \ built-in\n      applications, with no possibility to add or download applications\n\
    \      that can have IP communications.  An example of such a host is a\n    \
    \  very simple form of a mobile phone.\n   o  The host can be an open device,\
    \ e.g., a \"smart phone\" where it is\n      possible to download applications\
    \ to expand the functionality of\n      the device.\n   o  The cellular radio\
    \ modem part can be separated from the host IP\n      stack with an interface.\
    \  One example of such a host is a laptop\n      computer that uses a USB cellular\
    \ modem for cellular access.\n   If a cellular host has additional IP-capable\
    \ interfaces (such as\n   Ethernet, WLAN, Bluetooth, etc.), then there may be\
    \ additional\n   requirements for the device, beyond what is discussed in this\n\
    \   document.  Additionally, this document does not make any\n   recommendations\
    \ on the functionality required on laptop computers\n   having a cellular interface\
    \ such as an embedded modem or a USB modem\n   stick, other than recommending\
    \ link-specific behavior on the cellular\n   link.\n   This document discusses\
    \ IPv6 functionality as of the time when this\n   document was written.  Ongoing\
    \ work on IPv6 may affect what is\n   required of future hosts.\n   Transition\
    \ mechanisms used by cellular hosts are not in the scope of\n   this document\
    \ and are left for further study.  The primary transition\n   mechanism supported\
    \ by 3GPP is dual-stack [RFC4213].  Dual-stack-\n   capable bearer support has\
    \ been added to GPRS starting from 3GPP\n   Release-9 and to EPS starting from\
    \ Release-8 [RFC6459], whereas the\n   earlier 3GPP releases required multiple\
    \ single IP version bearers to\n   support dual-stack.\n"

- title: 2.2.  Neighbor Discovery in 3GPP Networks
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Neighbor Discovery in 3GPP Networks\n   A cellular host must support Neighbor\
    \ Solicitation and Neighbor\n   Advertisement messages [RFC4861].  Some further\
    \ notes on how Neighbor\n   Discovery is applied in the particular type of an\
    \ interface can be\n   useful.\n   In 3GPP networks, some Neighbor Discovery messages\
    \ can be unnecessary\n   in certain cases.  GPRS, UMTS, and EPS links resemble\
    \ a point-to-\n   point link; hence, the cellular host's only neighbor on the\
    \ cellular\n   link is the default router that is already known through Router\n\
    \   Discovery.  The cellular host always solicits for routers when the\n   cellular\
    \ interface is brought up (as described in [RFC4861],\n   Section 6.3.7).\n  \
    \ There are no link-layer addresses on the 3GPP cellular link\n   technology.\
    \  Therefore, address resolution and next-hop determination\n   are not needed.\
    \  If the cellular host still attempts to do address\n   resolution, e.g., for\
    \ the default router, it must be understood that\n   the GGSN/PGW may not even\
    \ answer the address resolution Neighbor\n   Solicitations.  And even if it does,\
    \ the Neighbor Advertisement is\n   unlikely to contain the Target link-layer\
    \ address option as there are\n   no link-layer addresses on the 3GPP cellular\
    \ link technology.\n   The cellular host must support Neighbor Unreachability\
    \ Detection\n   (NUD) as specified in [RFC4861].  Note that the link-layer address\n\
    \   considerations above also apply to NUD.  The NUD-triggered Neighbor\n   Advertisement\
    \ is also unlikely to contain the Target link-layer\n   address option as there\
    \ are no link-layer addresses.  The cellular\n   host should also be prepared\
    \ for NUD initiated by a router (i.e.,\n   GGSN/PGW).  However, it is unlikely\
    \ a router-to-host NUD would ever\n   take place on GPRS, UMTS, or EPS links.\
    \  See Appendix A for more\n   discussion on the router-to-host NUD.\n   In 3GPP\
    \ networks, it is desirable to reduce any additional periodic\n   signaling. \
    \ Therefore, the cellular host should include a mechanism\n   in upper-layer protocols\
    \ to provide reachability confirmations when\n   two-way IP-layer reachability\
    \ can be confirmed (see [RFC4861],\n   Section 7.3.1).  These confirmations would\
    \ allow the suppression of\n   NUD-related messages in most cases.\n   Host TCP\
    \ implementation should provide reachability confirmation in\n   the manner explained\
    \ in [RFC4861], Section 7.3.1.\n   The widespread use of UDP in 3GPP networks\
    \ poses a problem for\n   providing reachability confirmation.  As UDP itself\
    \ is unable to\n   provide such confirmation, applications running on top of UDP\
    \ should\n   provide the confirmation where possible.  In particular, when UDP\
    \ is\n   used for transporting DNS, the DNS response should be used as a basis\n\
    \   for reachability confirmation.  Similarly, when UDP is used to\n   transport\
    \ RTP [RFC3550], the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550]\n   feedback should\
    \ be used as a basis for the reachability confirmation.\n   If an RTCP packet\
    \ is received with a reception report block\n   indicating some packets have gone\
    \ through, then packets are reaching\n   the peer.  If they have reached the peer,\
    \ they have also reached the\n   neighbor.\n   When UDP is used for transporting\
    \ SIP [RFC3261], responses to SIP\n   requests should be used as the confirmation\
    \ that packets sent to the\n   peer are reaching it.  When the cellular host is\
    \ acting as the\n   server-side SIP node, no such confirmation is generally available.\n\
    \   However, a host may interpret the receipt of a SIP ACK request as\n   confirmation\
    \ that the previously sent response to a SIP INVITE\n   request has reached the\
    \ peer.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\n   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\
    \ is defined in [RFC4862].\n   This specification is a mandatory part of IPv6\
    \ and also the only\n   mandatory method to configure an IPv6 address in a 3GPP\
    \ cellular\n   host.\n   A cellular host in a 3GPP network must process a Router\
    \ Advertisement\n   as stated in [RFC4862].  The Router Advertisement contains\
    \ a maximum\n   of one prefix information option with lifetimes set to infinite\
    \ (both\n   valid and preferred lifetimes).  The advertised prefix cannot ever\
    \ be\n   used for on-link determination (see [RFC6459], Section 5.2), and the\n\
    \   lifetime of the advertised prefix is tied to the PDP Context/PDN\n   Connection\
    \ lifetime.  Keeping the forward compatibility in mind,\n   there is no reason\
    \ for the 3GPP cellular host to have 3GPP-specific\n   handling of the prefix\
    \ information option(s) although 3GPP\n   specifications state that the Router\
    \ Advertisement may contain a\n   maximum of one prefix information option and\
    \ the lifetimes are set to\n   infinite.\n   Hosts in 3GPP networks can set DupAddrDetectTransmits\
    \ equal to zero,\n   as each assigned prefix is unique within its scope when advertised\n\
    \   using 3GPP IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration.  In addition,\n   the\
    \ default router (GGSN/PGW) will not configure any addresses on its\n   interfaces\
    \ based on prefixes advertised to IPv6 cellular hosts on\n   those interfaces.\
    \  Thus, the host is not required to perform\n   Duplicate Address Detection on\
    \ the cellular interface.\n   Furthermore, the GGSN/PGW will provide the cellular\
    \ host with an\n   interface identifier that must be used for link-local address\n\
    \   configuration.  The link-local address configured from this interface\n  \
    \ identifier is guaranteed not to collide with the link-local address\n   that\
    \ the GGSN/PGW uses.  Thus, the cellular host is not required to\n   perform Duplicate\
    \ Address Detection for the link-local address on the\n   cellular interface.\n\
    \   See Appendix A for more details on 3GPP IPv6 Stateless Address\n   Autoconfiguration.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.  IP Version 6 over PPP\n   A cellular host in a 3GPP network that supports\
    \ PPP [RFC1661] on the\n   interface between the MT and the TE must support the\
    \ IPv6 Control\n   Protocol (IPV6CP) [RFC5072] interface identifier option.  This\
    \ option\n   is needed to be able to connect other devices to the Internet using\
    \ a\n   PPP link between the cellular device (MT, e.g., a USB dongle) and\n  \
    \ other devices (TE, e.g., a laptop).  The MT performs the PDP Context\n   activation\
    \ based on a request from the TE.  This results in an\n   interface identifier\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not specify any new protocols\
    \ or functionalities,\n   and as such, it does not introduce any new security\
    \ vulnerabilities.\n   However, specific profiles of IPv6 functionality are proposed\
    \ for\n   different situations, and vulnerabilities may open or close depending\n\
    \   on which functionality is included and what is not.  There are also\n   aspects\
    \ of the cellular environment that make certain types of\n   vulnerabilities more\
    \ severe.  The following issues are discussed:\n   o  The suggested limitations\
    \ (Section 3.1) in the processing of\n      extension headers also limits exposure\
    \ to Denial-of-Service (DoS)\n      attacks through cellular hosts.\n   o  IPv6\
    \ addressing privacy [RFC4941] or similar technology may be\n      used in cellular\
    \ hosts.  However, it should be noted that in the\n      3GPP model, the network\
    \ would assign a new prefix, in most cases,\n      to hosts in roaming situations;\
    \ the network would also typically\n      assign a new prefix when the cellular\
    \ hosts activate a PDP Context\n      or a PDN Connection. 3GPP devices must not\
    \ use interface\n      identifiers that are unique to the device, so the only\
    \ difference\n      in address between 3GPP devices using Stateless Address\n\
    \      Autoconfiguration is in the prefix.  This means that 3GPP networks\n  \
    \    will already provide a limited form of addressing privacy, and no\n     \
    \ global tracking of a single host is possible through its address.\n      On\
    \ the other hand, since a GGSN/PGW's coverage area is expected to\n      be very\
    \ large when compared to currently deployed default routers\n      (no handovers\
    \ between GGSN/PGWs are possible), a cellular host can\n      keep a prefix for\
    \ a long time.  Hence, IPv6 addressing privacy can\n      be used for additional\
    \ privacy during the time the host is on and\n      in the same area.  The privacy\
    \ features can also be used to, e.g.,\n      make different transport sessions\
    \ appear to come from different IP\n      addresses.  However, it is not clear\
    \ that these additional efforts\n      confuse potential observers any further,\
    \ as they could monitor\n      only the network prefix part.\n   o  The use and\
    \ recommendations of various security services such as\n      IPsec or Transport\
    \ Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] in the\n      connection of typical applications\
    \ that also apply to cellular\n      hosts are discussed in Section 11 of [RFC6434].\n\
    \   o  The airtime used by cellular hosts is expensive.  In some cases,\n    \
    \  users are billed according to the amount of data they transfer to\n      and\
    \ from their host.  It is crucial for both the network and the\n      users that\
    \ the airtime is used correctly and no extra charges are\n      applied to users\
    \ due to misbehaving third parties.  The cellular\n      links also have a limited\
    \ capacity, which means that they may not\n      necessarily be able to accommodate\
    \ more traffic than what the user\n      selected, such as a multimedia call.\
    \  Additional traffic might\n      interfere with the service level experienced\
    \ by the user.  While\n      Quality-of-Service mechanisms mitigate these problems\
    \ to an\n      extent, it is still apparent that DoS aspects may be highlighted\n\
    \      in the cellular environment.  It is possible for existing DoS\n      attacks\
    \ that use, for instance, packet amplification, to be\n      substantially more\
    \ damaging in this environment.  How these\n      attacks can be protected against\
    \ is still an area for further\n      study.  It is also often easy to fill the\
    \ cellular link and queues\n      on both sides with additional or large packets.\n\
    \   o  Within some service provider networks, it is possible to buy a\n      prepaid\
    \ cellular subscription without presenting personal\n      identification.  Attackers\
    \ that wish to remain unidentified could\n      leverage this.  Note that while\
    \ the user hasn't been identified,\n      the equipment still is; the operators\
    \ can follow the identity of\n      the device and block it from further use.\
    \  The operators must have\n      procedures in place to take notice of third\
    \ party complaints\n      regarding the use of their customers' devices.  It may\
    \ also be\n      necessary for the operators to have attack detection tools that\n\
    \      enable them to efficiently detect attacks launched from the\n      cellular\
    \ hosts.\n   o  Cellular devices that have local network interfaces (such as WLAN\n\
    \      or Bluetooth) may be used to launch attacks through them, unless\n    \
    \  the local interfaces are secured in an appropriate manner.\n      Therefore,\
    \ local network interfaces should have access control to\n      prevent others\
    \ from using the cellular host as an intermediary.\n   o  The 3GPP link model\
    \ mitigates most of the known IPv6 on-link and\n      neighbor cache targeted\
    \ attacks (see Section 2.2 and Appendix A).\n   o  Advice for implementations\
    \ in the face of Neighbor Discovery DoS\n      attacks may be useful in some environments\
    \ [RFC6583].\n   o  Section 9 of [RFC6459] further discusses some recent concerns\n\
    \      related to the security of cellular hosts.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Cellular Host IPv6 Addressing in the 3GPP Model
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Cellular Host IPv6 Addressing in the 3GPP Model\n   This appendix\
    \ aims to very briefly describe the 3GPP IPv6 addressing\n   model for 2G (GPRS),\
    \ 3G (UMTS), and 4G (EPS) cellular networks from\n   Release-99 onwards.  More\
    \ information for 2G and 3G can be found in\n   3GPP Technical Specifications\
    \ [TS.23060] and [TS.29061].  The\n   equivalent documentation for 4G can be found\
    \ in 3GPP Technical\n   Specifications [TS.23401], [TS.23402], and [TS.29061].\n\
    \   There are two possibilities to allocate the address for an IPv6 node:\n  \
    \ stateless and stateful autoconfiguration.  The stateful address\n   allocation\
    \ mechanism needs a DHCP server to allocate the address for\n   the IPv6 node.\
    \  On the other hand, the Stateless Address\n   Autoconfiguration procedure does\
    \ not need any external entity\n   involved in the address autoconfiguration (apart\
    \ from the GGSN/PGW).\n   At the time of writing this document, the IPv6 Stateless\
    \ Address\n   Autoconfiguration mechanism is still the only mandatory and supported\n\
    \   address configuration method for the cellular 3GPP link.\n   In order to support\
    \ the standard IPv6 Stateless Address\n   Autoconfiguration mechanism as recommended\
    \ by the IETF, the GGSN/PGW\n   shall assign a single /64 IPv6 prefix that is\
    \ unique within its scope\n   to each primary PDP Context or PDN Connection that\
    \ uses IPv6\n   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration.  This avoids the necessity\
    \ to\n   perform Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) at the network level for\n\
    \   any address built by the mobile host.  The GGSN/PGW always provides\n   an\
    \ interface identifier to the mobile host.  The mobile host uses the\n   interface\
    \ identifier provided by the GGSN/PGW to generate its link-\n   local address.\
    \  The GGSN/PGW provides the cellular host with the\n   interface identifier,\
    \ usually in a random manner.  It must ensure the\n   uniqueness of such an identifier\
    \ on the link (i.e., no collisions\n   between its own link-local address and\
    \ the cellular host's).\n   In addition, the GGSN/PGW will not use any of the\
    \ prefixes assigned\n   to cellular hosts to generate any of its own addresses.\
    \  This use of\n   the interface identifier, combined with the fact that each\
    \ PDP\n   Context or PDN Connection is allocated a unique prefix, will\n   eliminate\
    \ the need for DAD messages over the air interface and\n   consequently reduces\
    \ inefficient use of radio resources.\n   Furthermore, the allocation of a prefix\
    \ to each PDP Context or PDN\n   Connection will allow hosts to implement the\
    \ Privacy Extensions in\n   [RFC4941] without the need for further DAD messages.\n\
    \   In practice, the GGSN/PGW only needs to route all traffic destined to\n  \
    \ the cellular host that falls under the prefix assigned to it.  This\n   implies\
    \ the GGSN/PGW may implement a minimal Neighbor Discovery\n   protocol subset\
    \ since, due to the point-to-point link model and the\n   absence of link-layer\
    \ addressing, the address resolution can be\n   entirely statically configured\
    \ per PDP Context or PDN Connection, and\n   there is no need to defend any addresses\
    \ other than the link-local\n   addresses for very unlikely duplicates.  This\
    \ also has an additional\n   effect on a router-to-host NUD.  There is really\
    \ no need for the NUD,\n   since from the point of view of GGSN/PGW, GGSN/PGW\
    \ does not need to\n   care for a single address but just routes the whole prefix\
    \ to the\n   cellular host.  However, the cellular host must be prepared for the\n\
    \   unlikely event of receiving a NUD against its link-local address.  It\n  \
    \ should be noted that the 3GPP specifications at the time of writing\n   this\
    \ document are silent about what should happen if the router-to-\n   host NUD\
    \ fails.\n   See Section 5 of [RFC6459] for further discussion on 3GPP address\n\
    \   allocation and the 3GPP link model.\n"
