  contents:
  - "3)  Overview\n   The \"core\" model of Autonomous Systems [2] formed the basis\
    \ for the\n   routing model used in the Internet.  Due to massive growth and\n\
    \   topology changes, the \"core\" model no longer is in harmony with the\n  \
    \ reality of today's Internet.  Indeed, this situation was foreseen at\n   the\
    \ outset:\n      \"Ultimately, however, the internet may consist of a number of\
    \ co-\n      equal autonomous systems, any of which may be used...as a\n     \
    \ transport medium for traffic originating in any system and\n      destined for\
    \ any system.  When this more complex configuration\n      comes into being, it\
    \ will be inappropriate to regard any one\n      autonomous system as a \"core\"\
    \ system\" [2].\n   Furthermore, the Autonomous System concept has been outgrown\
    \ in\n   certain parts of the Internet, in which the complexity of regional\n\
    \   routing has exceeded the limits of the definition of Autonomous\n   Systems.\n\
    \   A model which can provide a better match to the Internet can be found\n  \
    \ in the \"OSI Routeing Framework\" [1].\n   This framework proposes a structure\
    \ of Routing Domains within\n   Administrative Domains.  This paper is intended\
    \ to briefly describe\n   this framework, to outline how this model better fits\
    \ the reality of\n   the present and future Internet, and to show how the model\
    \ can aid in\n   the construction of well-engineered routing environments.\n"
- title: 4)  Terminology
  contents:
  - "4)  Terminology\n   The following is a brief glossary of OSI terminology.  Formal\n\
    \   definitions can be found in the OSI Basic Reference Model [4], the\n   Internal\
    \ Organization of the Network Layer [5], and the OSI Routeing\n   Framework [1].\n\
    \         \"Routeing\" is the official ISO spelling of what is more\n        \
    \ commonly spelled \"routing.\"  In this paper, the ISO spelling\n         will\
    \ be used wherever directly quoted from ISO documents, and\n         the common\
    \ spelling used otherwise.\n      End System (ES)\n         An OSI system on which\
    \ applications run.  An End System has\n         full seven-layer OSI functionality.\
    \  Basically equivalent to an\n         Internet Host.\n      Intermediate System\
    \ (IS)\n         An OSI system that performs routing and relaying functions in\n\
    \         order to provide paths between End Systems.  Intermediate\n        \
    \ Systems have no functionality above the Network Layer (although\n         a\
    \ practical realization of an OSI router will have some amount\n         of End\
    \ System functionality for network management functions,\n         among other\
    \ things).  Basically equivalent to an Internet\n         Router.\n      Subnetwork\
    \ (SN)\n         A communications medium that provides a \"direct\" path between\n\
    \         Network Layer entities.  This can be realized via a point-to-\n    \
    \     point link, a LAN, a Public Data Network, and so forth.  This\n        \
    \ is essentially equivalent to an Internet Subnet.  It is worth\n         noting\
    \ that, unlike Internet Subnets, OSI Subnetworks are not\n         necessarily\
    \ reflected in the addressing hierarchy, so the\n         double meaning of the\
    \ Internet term \"Subnet\" (a single IP hop;\n         a part of the address hierarchy)\
    \ does not hold in the OSI\n         world.\n      Open Systems Interconnection\
    \ Environment (OSIE)\n         The global collection of Open Systems.  Basically\
    \ equivalent to\n         the Internet.\n      Network Service Access Point (NSAP)\n\
    \         A conceptual point on the Network/Transport Layer boundary in\n    \
    \     an End System that is globally addressable (and the address\n         globally\
    \ unambiguous) in the OSIE.  An NSAP represents a\n         service available\
    \ above the Network Layer (such as a choice of\n         transport protocols).\
    \  An End System may have multiple NSAPs.\n         An NSAP address is roughly\
    \ equivalent to the Internet [address,\n         protocol] pair.\n      Administrative\
    \ Domain (AD)\n         \"A collection of End Systems, Intermediate Systems, and\n\
    \         subnetworks operated by a single organization or administrative\n  \
    \       authority.  The components which make up the domain are assumed\n    \
    \     to interoperate with a significant degree of mutual trust among\n      \
    \   themselves, but interoperate with other Administrative Domains\n         in\
    \ a mutually suspicious manner\" [1].\n         A group of hosts, routers, and\
    \ networks operated and managed by\n         a single organization.  Routing within\
    \ an Administrative Domain\n         is based on a consistent technical plan.\
    \  An Administrative\n         Domain is viewed from the outside, for purposes\
    \ of routing, as\n         a cohesive entity, of which the internal structure\
    \ is\n         unimportant.  Information passed by other Administrative\n    \
    \     Domains is trusted less than information from one's own\n         Administrative\
    \ Domain.\n         Administrative Domains can be organized into a loose hierarchy\n\
    \         that reflects the availability and authoritativeness of routing\n  \
    \       information.  This hierarchy does not imply administrative\n         containment,\
    \ nor does it imply a strict tree topology.\n      Routing Domain (RD)\n     \
    \    \"A set of End Systems and Intermediate Systems which operate\n         according\
    \ to the same routeing procedures and which is wholly\n         contained within\
    \ a single Administrative Domain\" [1].\n         \"A Routeing Domain is a set\
    \ of ISs and ESs bound by a common\n         routeing procedure; namely:\n   \
    \      they are using the same set of routeing metrics,\n         they use compatible\
    \ metric measurement techniques,\n         they use the same information distribution\
    \ protocol, and\n         they use the same path computation algorithm\" [1].\n\
    \         The \"OSI Routeing Framework\" further provides a formal\n         definition\
    \ of a Routing Domain, specifying that all ISs within\n         a Routing Domain\
    \ can determine whether an ES within the domain\n         is reachable, and if\
    \ so can derive a path to it.\n         Routing Domains may be divided into subdomains,\
    \ not unlike\n         subnetting in the Internet.  This allows a hierarchical\n\
    \         structuring of the domain, permitting containment of the\n         topological\
    \ details of a subdomain with the resultant reduction\n         in distributed\
    \ routing information.\n         An intra-Routing Domain routing protocol is equivalent\
    \ to an\n         Internet Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).\n         An Administrative\
    \ Domain may contain multiple Routing Domains.\n         A Routing Domain may\
    \ never span multiple Administrative\n         Domains.\n         An Administrative\
    \ Domain may consist of only a single Routing\n         Domain, in which case\
    \ they are said to be Congruent.  A\n         congruent Administrative Domain\
    \ and Routing Domain is analogous\n         to an Internet Autonomous System.\n\
    \      Common Domain (CD)\n         \"An Administrative Domain which is not a\
    \ member of a higher\n         level domain.  A common domain is the highest level\
    \ in the\n         routeing hierarchy.  There is no single domain above the common\n\
    \         domain.  In this sense, the routeing hierarchy is in fact\n        \
    \ multiple hierarchies, with the common domain as the highest\n         element\
    \ of each hierarchy\".\n         \"Where there are multiple common domains, they\
    \ cooperate as\n         peers to make it possible to route to any NSAP in the\
    \ OSIE\"\n         [1].\n         Common Domains have global routing information\
    \ to the extent\n         necessary to route packets to the proper domain.  Each\
    \ of the\n         several peer national backbones in today's Internet may be\n\
    \         considered to be similar to a Common Domain.  Note that in the\n   \
    \      Internet the hierarchical containment implied by the definition\n     \
    \    of a CD does not really exist; however, there is a level of\n         implicit\
    \ ordering based on topology and policy issues (the\n         willingness to be\
    \ used as a transit network) that can be viewed\n         as defining a Common\
    \ Domain in the Internet.\n   For completeness, we offer the following definition\
    \ for an Internet\n   Autonomous System (AS):\n      \"An 'autonomous system'\
    \ consists of a set of gateways, each of\n      which can reach any other gateway\
    \ in the same system using paths\n      via gateways only in that system.  The\
    \ gateways of a system\n      cooperatively maintain a routing data base using\
    \ an interior\n      gateway protocol (IGP)...\" [3]\n"
- title: 5)  Environment and Goals
  contents:
  - "5)  Environment and Goals\n   The \"OSI Routeing Framework\" describes the environment\
    \ for OSI\n   routing as well as its goals.  The environment described is a highly\n\
    \   interconnected, highly heterogeneous collection of LANs and public\n   and\
    \ private networks made up of a diverse collection of equipment\n   from multiple\
    \ vendors.  A number of goals are enumerated, including:\n      -  Support of\
    \ multiple subnetwork types\n      -  Very large numbers of connected systems\n\
    \      -  End System simplicity\n      -  Multiple organizations with mutual distrust\
    \ and policy/legal\n         restrictions\n      -  High performance\n      -\
    \  Robust and dynamic routing in the face of topological changes\n   The environment\
    \ and goals described are a good match for those in the\n   Internet.  The Internet\
    \ crosses multiple types of physical media,\n   link layer protocols, and administrative\
    \ controls.  Routers and hosts\n   may come from many vendors.  The Internet has\
    \ become international in\n   scope.  Issues of security and the isolation of\
    \ bad routing\n   information have become international concerns.\n   The Internet\
    \ environment, with over 900 highly connected networks\n   (and growing exponentially),\
    \ is very much like the environment the\n   OSI model aims to describe.\n"
- title: 6)  Structure of Global Routing
  contents:
  - "6)  Structure of Global Routing\n   The \"OSI Routeing Framework\" classifies\
    \ routing into three types:\n      -  within a Routing Domain\n      -  within\
    \ an Administrative Domain\n      -  between Administrative Domains\n   Routing\
    \ within a Routing Domain involves a high level of mutual\n   trust.  This allows\
    \ the use of complex, tightly-coupled procedures\n   that can make the best use\
    \ of dynamic, highly interconnected\n   environments.\n   Routing Domains may\
    \ be recursively subdivided into Subdomains in\n   order to reduce routing complexity.\
    \  The details of a subdomain may\n   be largely hidden from other subdomains\
    \ with an attendant reduction\n   in the volume of routing information exchanged.\n\
    \   Intra-Administrative Domain routing is concerned with interconnecting\n  \
    \ multiple Routing Domains within an administration.  Issues may\n   include address\
    \ administration, cost recovery, and policy concerns.\n   A moderate level of\
    \ trust is assumed.  The nature of the interactions\n   between Routing Domains\
    \ can range from being tightly coupled (best\n   path routing between two RDs\
    \ running different routing protocols) to\n   being more policy-based.  However,\
    \ inter-RD routing within an\n   Administrative Domain is tightly coordinated\
    \ and represents a unified\n   technical plan.\n   Inter-Administrative Domain\
    \ routing is concerned with managing and\n   controlling the flow of information\
    \ in a highly structured way\n   between organizations that may require formal\
    \ multilateral\n   agreements.  The issues of concern at this level tend to be\n\
    \   administrative in nature (legal/political constraints, security,\n   access\
    \ control, etc.).  Multiple agreements between multiple\n   administrations are\
    \ unlikely to be implicitly transitive.  This makes\n   the analysis of policy\
    \ interactions very important.\n"
- title: 7)  Mapping the AD/RD Model Onto the Internet
  contents:
  - "7)  Mapping the AD/RD Model Onto the Internet\n   The national network backbones\
    \ (NSFNET, ARPANET, MILNET, NSN, and\n   soon ESNET) can be viewed as Common Domains.\
    \  Each may have\n   sufficiently global routing knowledge to determine a path\
    \ to any\n   Internet address.\n   Regional networks are clearly Administrative\
    \ Domains.  Multilateral\n   policy agreements are defined between the regional\
    \ networks and the\n   backbones.  On the other hand, regional networks very often\
    \ are\n   tightly coupled to individual networks and campus networks in terms\n\
    \   of routing.  In this sense, a regional network could be viewed as a\n   Routing\
    \ Domain with individual campuses thought of as Subdomains.\n   From the standpoint\
    \ of routing functionality, it is most useful to\n   view a \"classic\" Autonomous\
    \ System as a congruent Routing Domain and\n   Administrative Domain.  An AS as\
    \ defined represents both a single IGP\n   and a point of policy administration.\
    \  The sixteen bit value now\n   known as the Autonomous System number may instead\
    \ be viewed as an\n   Administrative Domain number.\n   In reality, however, many\
    \ so-called Autonomous Systems today do not\n   adhere to the strict definition\
    \ of an AS.  In theory, an Autonomous\n   System is quite similar to a Routing\
    \ Domain, in which a high level of\n   trust is made between systems, a consistent\
    \ IGP is run, and full\n   routing information is distributed.  On the other hand,\
    \ AS numbers\n   have become an abstraction for policy groupings to backbones.\n\
    \   Indeed, entire regional networks are viewed by the backbones as a\n   single\
    \ Autonomous System, even though they are not nearly as\n   homogeneous as the\
    \ AS model specifies.  Such entities can be viewed\n   as an Administrative Domain\
    \ containing several Routing Domains.\n   Although it is true that, in this interpretation,\
    \ multiple\n   nontechnical administrations are represented within a single\n\
    \   Administrative Domain (in conflict with the definition of an\n   Administrative\
    \ Domain), such structures require a single approach to\n   internal routing.\
    \  Even if there is not a true administration\n   representing the collection\
    \ of domains (such as a consortium), there\n   typically is a technical committee\
    \ to settle common technical issues.\n"
- title: 8)  The AD/RD Model as an Engineering Tool
  contents:
  - "8)  The AD/RD Model as an Engineering Tool\n   Current Autonomous Systems cross\
    \ administrative boundaries with\n   impunity.  This works as long as the individual\
    \ administrations\n   operating within the common AS agree to a common technical\
    \ policy for\n   routing and network management.  Connections with other backbones,\n\
    \   regional networks, and campus networks must be planned, implemented,\n   and\
    \ managed in a coordinated fashion.\n   This coordination becomes more difficult,\
    \ but more necessary, as the\n   AS grows.  As connectivity and policy become\
    \ more complex, current\n   Autonomous Systems start to fragment.  An example\
    \ of this is a\n   network that is currently a member of an NSFNET regional network\
    \ but\n   will be adding a connection to ESNET.  The administrators of the\n \
    \  network and the regional network must carefully coordinate the\n   changes\
    \ necessary to implement this connection, including possibly\n   altering the\
    \ boundaries of policy and routing.  A lack of\n   coordination could result in\
    \ routing loops and policy violations.\n   A point that is being increasingly\
    \ realized is that the entity\n   responsible for exterior or policy routing (be\
    \ it an Autonomous\n   System or an Administrative Domain) must have a common\
    \ technical\n   policy for routing.  The effects of attempting different approaches\n\
    \   to policy and external routing while maintaining a single AS have\n   been\
    \ painfully evident in real instances in the Internet.\n   Under the AD/RD model,\
    \ a routing domain cannot be in two\n   Administrative Domains.  For example,\
    \ if a campus network wants to\n   set its own routing policy and enforce it via\
    \ management of their\n   routers, the campus has elected to become a separate\
    \ Administrative\n   Domain.  If that campus uses a common IGP with other campuses,\
    \ it\n   represents an attempt to split a Routing Domain (the regional network\n\
    \   with a common IGP) across multiple Administrative Domains (the campus\n  \
    \ and the rest of the regional).  Such arrangements represent dubious\n   engineering\
    \ practice, cause real routing problems, and are disallowed\n   by the AD/RD model.\n\
    \   Under the strict Autonomous System model, only one IGP can exist\n   within\
    \ an AS.  However, many regional networks are successfully using\n   multiple\
    \ IGPs.  The AD/RD model allows this valuable routing\n   topology.  Such a topology\
    \ would also be allowed by the AS model if\n   it were to be broadened to allow\
    \ multiple IGPs, in which case an AS\n   and an AD would effectively become equivalent.\n"
- title: 9)  The AD/RD Model in a Dual Protocol Internet
  contents:
  - "9)  The AD/RD Model in a Dual Protocol Internet\n   As the OSI protocol suite\
    \ is deployed and an OSI Internet is\n   constructed, it is very likely that significant\
    \ portions of the\n   current TCP/IP Internet will also carry OSI traffic.  Many\
    \ router\n   vendors provide dual protocol capability today, or will in the near\n\
    \   future, and the investment in network infrastructure is such that it\n   is\
    \ unlikely that a separate, parallel internet will be established\n   for OSI\
    \ traffic.\n   It is logical to assume that, in many cases, the same technical\
    \ and\n   administrative boundaries will apply to both DoD IP and OSI\n   protocols,\
    \ and in some cases a single routing protocol may be used to\n   support both\
    \ protocol suites.\n   Thus, it would be most advantageous to have a common model\
    \ and common\n   nomenclature in order to provide a more unified, manageable routing\n\
    \   environment.  Given that the OSI Routeing Framework represents the\n   model\
    \ on which OSI routing is built, the use of the AD/RD model to\n   describe the\
    \ existing Internet is an appropriate step toward\n   describing and building\
    \ the combined internet.\n"
- title: 10)  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "10)  Conclusions\n   The AD/RD model of routing describes the current Internet\
    \ better than\n   existing models because it describes:\n      -  How Intra-Domain\
    \ and Inter-Domain relationships work at both\n         routing and policy level\n\
    \      -  How routing domains and administrative domains can be\n         hierarchically\
    \ related\n      -  The existence of multiple national peers\n      -  A common\
    \ model for dual protocol internets\n   The expanding Internet has grown from\
    \ the \"core\" model with several\n   small attached networks to a highly interconnected\
    \ environment that\n   spans several continents.  Several national peer networks\
    \ serve an\n   ever-growing set of regional networks.  The AD/RD model can help\n\
    \   Internet protocol designers abstract the functional pieces from the\n   large\
    \ Internet.\n   The Internet grows daily.  Any model of Internet routing needs\
    \ to\n   provide a way to understand and order the growth.  The ISO Routeing\n\
    \   Framework provides a structure to handle such growth.\n"
