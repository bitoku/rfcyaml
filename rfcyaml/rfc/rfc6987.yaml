- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In some situations, it may be advantageous to inform routers\
    \ in a\n   network not to use a specific router as a transit point but to still\n\
    \   route to it.  Possible situations include the following:\n   o  The router\
    \ is in a critical condition (for example, has a very\n      high CPU load or\
    \ does not have enough memory to store all Link\n      State Advertisements (LSAs)\
    \ or build the routing table).\n   o  Graceful introduction and removal of the\
    \ router to/from the\n      network.\n   o  Other (administrative or traffic engineering)\
    \ reasons.\n   Note that the solution introduced in this document does not remove\n\
    \   the router from the topology view of the network (as could be done by\n  \
    \ just flushing that router's router-LSA) but discourages other routers\n   from\
    \ using it for transit routing, while still routing packets to the\n   router's\
    \ own IP addresses, i.e., the router is announced as a stub.\n   It must be emphasized\
    \ that the solution provides real benefits in\n   networks designed with at least\
    \ some level of redundancy, so that\n   traffic can be routed around the stub\
    \ router.  Otherwise, traffic\n   destined for the networks and reachable through\
    \ such a stub router\n   may still be routed through it.\n"
- title: 2.  Solutions
  contents:
  - "2.  Solutions\n   The solution introduced in this document solves two challenges\n\
    \   associated with the outlined problem.  In the description below,\n   router\
    \ X is the router announcing itself as a stub.  The challenges\n   are\n   1)\
    \ Making other routers prefer routes around router X while\n      performing the\
    \ Dijkstra calculation.\n   2) Allowing other routers to reach IP prefixes directly\
    \ connected to\n      router X.\n   Note that it would be easy to address issue\
    \ 1) alone by just flushing\n   router X's router-LSA from the domain.  However,\
    \ it does not solve\n   problem 2), since other routers will not be able to use\
    \ links to\n   router X in Dijkstra (no back link), and because router X will\
    \ not\n   have links to its neighbors.\n   To address both problems, router X\
    \ announces its router-LSA to the\n   neighbors with the cost of all non-stub\
    \ links (links of the types\n   other than 3) being set to MaxLinkMetric (defined\
    \ in Section 3).\n   The solution above applies to both OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3\n\
    \   [RFC5340].\n"
- title: 2.1.  OSPFv3-Only Solution
  contents:
  - "2.1.  OSPFv3-Only Solution\n   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] introduces additional options\
    \ to provide similar\n   control of the forwarding topology; the R-bit provides\
    \ an indication\n   of whether a router is active and should be used for transit\
    \ traffic.\n   It is left to network operators to decide which technique to use\
    \ in\n   their network.  See Section 4 for more details.\n"
- title: 3.  Maximum Link Metric
  contents:
  - "3.  Maximum Link Metric\n   Section 2 refers to the cost of all non-stub links\
    \ as MaxLinkMetric,\n   which is a new fixed architectural value introduced in\
    \ this document.\n   MaxLinkMetric\n      The metric value indicating that a router-LSA\
    \ link (see Section 2)\n      should not be used for transit traffic.  It is defined\
    \ to be the\n      16-bit binary value of all ones: 0xffff.\n"
- title: 4.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Deployment Considerations\n   When using MaxLinkMetric, some inconsistency\
    \ may be seen if the\n   network is constructed of routers that perform an intra-area\
    \ Dijkstra\n   calculation as specified in [RFC1247] (discarding link records\
    \ in\n   router-LSAs that have a MaxLinkMetric cost value) and routers that\n\
    \   perform it as specified in [RFC1583] and higher (do not treat links\n   with\
    \ MaxLinkMetric cost as unreachable).  Note that this\n   inconsistency will not\
    \ lead to routing loops, because if there are\n   some alternate paths in the\
    \ network, both types of routers will agree\n   on using them rather than the\
    \ path through the stub router.  If the\n   path through the stub router is the\
    \ only one, the routers of the\n   first type will not use the stub router for\
    \ transit (which is the\n   desired behavior), while the routers of the second\
    \ type will still\n   use this path.\n   On the other hand, clearing the R-bit\
    \ will consistently result in the\n   router not being used for transit.\n   The\
    \ use of MaxLinkMetric or the R-bit in a network depends on the\n   objectives\
    \ of the operator.  One of the possible considerations for\n   selecting one or\
    \ the other is in the desired behavior if the path\n   through the stub router\
    \ is the only one available.  Using\n   MaxLinkMetric allows for that path to\
    \ be used while the R-bit\n   doesn't.\n"
