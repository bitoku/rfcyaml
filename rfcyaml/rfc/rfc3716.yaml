  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the fall of 2003, the IETF Chair and the IAB Chair formed\
    \ an IAB\n   Advisory Committee (AdvComm), with a mandate to review the existing\n\
    \   IETF administrative structure and relationships (RFC Editor, IETF\n   Secretariat,\
    \ IANA) and to propose changes to the IETF management\n   process or structure\
    \ to improve the overall functioning of the IETF.\n   This purpose was defined\
    \ in the IAB Advisory Committee (AdvComm)\n   charter, copied in Appendix A. \
    \ The AdvComm mandate did not include\n   the standards process itself.\n   The\
    \ tangible output of this committee is a set of observations and\n   recommendations\
    \ for the IETF's executive structure - how the IETF\n   might be organizationally\
    \ (re)structured so that it can effectively\n   and efficiently carry out its\
    \ administrative activities.  As a\n   necessary preamble to that, a description\
    \ of the current issues and\n   future requirements is presented.  The output\
    \ does not represent any\n   decision-making or implementation -- see Section\
    \ 1.3 for a discussion\n   of follow-on steps.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Overview of the AdvComm Work Process and Output
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview of the AdvComm Work Process and Output\n   The AdvComm was formed\
    \ in September 2003, and carried out its work\n   over the course of the following\
    \ 2 months, prior to the IETF58 in\n   November of 2003.\n   The AdvComm's membership\
    \ included many of the individuals who are, or\n   have been, volunteered to manage\
    \ the IETF's inter-organization\n   administrative relationships in recent years.\
    \  The first phase of the\n   committee's work, therefore, included sharing and\
    \ discussing the body\n   of tacit knowledge about those relationships.  This\
    \ included the\n   input from the current IETF and IAB Chairs in Appendix B, and\
    \ yielded\n   the IETF organizational structure information in Section 2.1.\n\
    \   The committee also sought input from the other end of the key\n   existing\
    \ administrative relationships (RFC Editor, Secretariat, and\n   IANA).  The output\
    \ of those efforts is included in Appendix C,\n   Appendix D, and Appendix E,\
    \ and these were also used as the basis for\n   the observations in Section 2.\n\
    \   From these inputs, the committee drew together a list of requirements\n  \
    \ for successful future IETF administration, documented in Section 3.\n   Finally,\
    \ the committee put together some advice for how the IETF\n   might consider reorganizing\
    \ its administrative structure to meet\n   those requirements moving forward --\
    \ Section 4.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Scope\n   The AdvComm endeavored to stay focused on the IETF executive\n\
    \   structure -- the collection of organizations that work together to\n   bring\
    \ the IETF's work to reality.  However, by virtue of the very\n   fact that those\
    \ relationships exist to get the work done, it was\n   important to bear in mind\
    \ the work being done in the IETF PROBLEM\n   working group and IESG proposals\
    \ for change, even as the committee\n   endeavored not to infringe on the scope\
    \ of those efforts.  The\n   objective is that these observations and proposals\
    \ should be relevant\n   for today's IETF and any near-term evolutions that are\
    \ deemed\n   appropriate.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Next Steps
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Next Steps\n   This documents the state of the AdvComm's thinking at the\
    \ end of a\n   two month process, and brings the currently-chartered work of the\n\
    \   AdvComm to a close.\n   Next steps include review of this material by the\
    \ community, and\n   specific proposals for action that will be put forward by\
    \ the IAB and\n   IETF Chairs.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  What the Term IETF Includes in this Document\n   RFC 3233 ([1]) provides\
    \ a definition of the IETF, in terms of its\n   work and its participation.\n\
    \   This document discusses the collection of organizations that work\n   together\
    \ to support the effort described in RFC 3233.  In this\n   document, the term\
    \ \"IETF\" explicitly includes the IESG, WGs, IAB,\n   IRTF, and RGs.  This inclusive\
    \ sense accords with considerable common\n   usage of the term \"IETF\".  Formally,\
    \ the IAB and IRTF are chartered\n   independently of the IETF.  However, rather\
    \ than coming up with a new\n   term to encompass \"the IETF and all its friends\"\
    , the common usage is\n   followed here.\n"

- title: 2.1.3.  Support
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Support\n   A presentation of the scope and depth of support that created\
    \ the\n   IETF and has allowed it to continue to contribute would require a\n\
    \   discussion of history that is rich, vibrant, and completely beyond\n   the\
    \ scope of this document.  However, a very brief introduction to\n   some of the\
    \ current pillars is needed to understand where the IETF is\n   today.\n     \
    \ ISOC:  Since 1992, ISOC has been the organizational home of the\n      IETF.\
    \  This activity is part of its more general mission of\n      serving as the\
    \ international organization for global coordination\n      and cooperation on\
    \ the Internet, promoting and maintaining a broad\n      spectrum of activities\
    \ focused on the Internet's development,\n      availability, and associated technologies.\n\
    \      Foretec/CNRI:  The Corporation for National Research Initiatives\n    \
    \  (CNRI) was founded in 1986, and since 1987, CNRI has served the\n      community\
    \ by providing IETF Secretariat services.  Until the early\n      1990s, CNRI\
    \ provided legal assistance to the IETF and the IETF\n      Secretariat.  After\
    \ ISOC was founded, ISOC assumed overall legal\n      responsibility for the substantive\
    \ workings of the IETF including\n      the efforts of the IETF chair, the IESG,\
    \ the IAB, the area\n      directors and the working group chairs.  CNRI assumed\
    \ operational\n      responsibility for the substantive workings of the IETF\n\
    \      Secretariat.  In 1998, in order to decrease overhead costs on the\n   \
    \   activities, the Secretariat was reorganized placing Secretariat\n      employees\
    \ including the IETF Executive Director in a CNRI for-\n      profit subsidiary\
    \ (Foretec Seminars, Inc.).  Foretec was founded\n      in 1997, in anticipation\
    \ of the Secretariat becoming self-\n      supporting.  CNRI and its subsidiary\
    \ have continued to improve the\n      operation of the Secretariat, as appropriate,\
    \ and maintain a\n      trained staff.\n      USC/ISI:  The role of the RFC Editor,\
    \ and USC/ISI, is detailed in\n      RFC 2555.  The RFC document series is a set\
    \ of technical and\n      organizational notes about the Internet (originally\
    \ the ARPANET),\n      beginning in 1969.  For 30 years, the RFC Editor was Jon\
    \ Postel, a\n      research scientist and manager in the Networking Division of\
    \ the\n      USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI), with the function\n   \
    \   gradually evolving into a team headed by him.  The RFC Editor\n      activity\
    \ is currently organized as a project within ISI, using the\n      ISI infrastructure,\
    \ and supported by a contract with ISOC.  The\n      RFC Editor is the publisher\
    \ of RFCs and is responsible for the\n      final editorial review of the documents,\
    \ as well as the\n      maintenance of the online repository and index of those\
    \ documents.\n      ICANN:  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\n\
    \      (ICANN) is the non-profit corporation that was formed in 1998 to\n    \
    \  assume responsibility for the IP address space allocation,\n      protocol\

- title: 2.2.  Observed Stress Points

  - "2.2.  Observed Stress Points\n   The AdvComm noted several properties of the\
    \ current IETF\n   organizational environment that cause stress in the system.\
    \  These\n   have been noted both from the point of view of the IETF leadership\
    \ as\n   well as that of organizations supporting the IETF.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Stress Points Observed by IETF Leadership
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Stress Points Observed by IETF Leadership\n   The current IETF funding\
    \ and operational structure is dependent on\n   IETF meeting attendance.  Therefore,\
    \ the most obvious stressor that\n   has emerged within the last two years is\
    \ the decline in that\n   attendance.  This trend, which has continued unabated,\
    \ has resulted\n   in a decline in IETF revenue (detailed in the IETF chair presentation\n\
    \   at IETF 56 [2]), even as the requirements of the IETF operation are\n   remaining\
    \ constant or increasing.\n   The result has been a budget deficit for operations\
    \ which began in\n   2002, and is forecasted to continue until at least 2004,\
    \ even after a\n   substantial increase in meeting fees.  The continuing deficits\
    \ have\n   depleted working capital, making the IETF less robust against\n   potential\
    \ future budgetary disappointments.\n   The financial stress is real, but the\
    \ IETF leadership has noted\n   several other stressors that are impediments to\
    \ finding and\n   implementing solutions to the fiscal issues.  Some obvious solutions\n\
    \   are not implementable in the current IETF structure.\n   The rest of the stressors\
    \ listed in this section should be understood\n   as issues for which relief is\
    \ necessary, particularly in the light of\n   needing to properly address and\
    \ implement solutions to the financial\n   stress.\n   The current documentation\
    \ of IETF processes and structure is, in\n   places, vague about the distribution\
    \ of responsibility for management\n   and oversight of the IETF administrative\
    \ relationships.  This makes\n   it opaque to the IETF community, and sometimes\
    \ leaves the leadership\n   in a poor position to manage effectively.\n   Additionally,\
    \ the informality of the relationships with some of the\n   organizations that\
    \ are carrying out key IETF functions compounds the\n   problem of determining\
    \ who has responsibility, and how IETF community\n   consensus and desires are\
    \ reflected in the activity.\n   As a separate issue, important IETF institutional\
    \ memory is recorded\n   nowhere other than peoples' minds in many cases -- which\
    \ requires\n   significant transmission of oral history for IETF leadership\n\
    \   transition to be effective.\n   Apart from the institutional memory, other\
    \ important IETF\n   institutional records are spread across various organizations,\
    \ and\n   searching for the set of relevant documentation (especially when this\n\
    \   is necessary long after the recording) can be challenging.\n   Another stressor\
    \ relates to the need to scale support processes in\n   terms of reducing latency\
    \ for mechanical processes.  That is, a\n   decrease in the amount of manual labor\
    \ required for the simpler tasks\n   between the organizations, would make more\
    \ resources available to\n   focus on the special cases.  Lack of automation in\
    \ the basic request\n   services has been known to cause undue delay or failure\
    \ in processing\n   simple, routine tasks.  However, automation also requires\
    \ resources\n   and significant management in order to make sure it fulfills the\n\
    \   community's requirements.\n"

  - "2.2.2.  Stress Points Observed by Organizations Supporting the IETF\n   Supporting\
    \ organizations report difficulties in determining\n   authoritative channels\
    \ for directions -- either too many inputs, or\n   no clear authority for resolution\
    \ of change requests.\n   In the absence of written agreements, supporting organizations\

    \ it also needs to respect the needs of\n   supporting organizations to manage\
    \ their own affairs.  That is, the\n   text above does not suggest that the IETF\
    \ should micro-manage the\n   financial affairs of supporting organizations.\n\
    \   However, the very clear requirement is for clarity in the\n   distribution\
    \ of rights, responsibilities, and accountability in those\n   relationships.\
    \  The usual mechanism for documenting such clarity is\n   in contract form. \

  - "4.1.  Proposed:  (Single) Formalized IETF Organizational Entity\n   In order\
    \ to ensure an IETF structure that is capable of meeting the\n   requirements\
    \ outlined above, the AdvComm recommends that the IETF be\n   more formally organized.\
    \  This would allow the IETF to take full\n   responsibility for, and management\
    \ of, the resources required to\n   accomplish its work (as described in Section\
    \ 3.1), provide and\n   maintain the necessary work environment for current work\
    \ (as\n   described in Section 3.3), and provide appropriate stewardship of the\n\
    \   institutional information required for all aspects of current and\n   future\
    \ work of the organization (as described in Section 3.2).\n   Some proposed models\
    \ for establishing such a formalized effort are\n   described in the following\
    \ sections.  Some of the key expectations,\n   irrespective of the final implementation\
    \ of formalism, are:\n   o  the administration of the IETF would remain accountable\
    \ to the\n      IETF leadership and community; the goal would be to ensure that\n\
    \      lines of responsibility and accountability were clearer;\n   o  this formalized\
    \ IETF would be responsible for managing financial\n      resources (revenue and\
    \ expenses) directly;\n   o  this formalized IETF would be directly signatory\
    \ to agreements\n      with other organizations, and would therefore be able to\
    \ negotiate\n      and administer any appropriate contracts;\n   o  however implemented,\
    \ this would require a small staff complement\n      (e.g., one full-time person)\
    \ responsible to no other organization\n      than the one chartered with the\
    \ IETF's mission;\n   o  nevertheless, it remains a non-goal to create an organizational\n\
    \      entity that exists simply for the purpose of continuing to exist.\n   \
    \   This should be executed with the minimum formality needed in order\n     \
    \ to address the identified requirements.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Comments on the Necessity of this Formalization
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Comments on the Necessity of this Formalization\n   An important question\
    \ is:  what does this proposed formalization\n   provide that cannot be provided\
    \ by the status quo?  The AdvComm\n   believes that an appropriately implemented\
    \ formalization of the IETF\n   would permit the unification of the resource management,\
    \ decision\n   making and stewardship that is imperative to providing clarity\
    \ and\n   ensuring a viable future for the IETF.  The AdvComm further believes\n\
    \   that this is simply not possible to implement within the existing\n   distributed\
    \ and informal arrangement of responsibilities.\n   Naturally, the act of forming\
    \ such an organization does not\n   immediately satisfy the requirements outlined\
    \ in Section 3.  It is\n   not a silver bullet.  Changing the formal structure\
    \ will not, for\n   example, change the financial status of the IETF.  However,\
    \ the\n   AdvComm believes it would provide the necessary basis from which the\n\
    \   required decisions could be made and acted upon.\n   In short, the AdvComm\
    \ believes that we first have to place the\n   responsibility for defining the\
    \ IETF's administrative environment\n   with specific people who are accountable\
    \ to the IETF community.  Then\n   these people can take the detailed decisions\
    \ that will change the\n   IETF's administrative environment to fulfill its requirements.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Possible Structures
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Possible Structures\n   Section 4.1 was deliberately vague on the nature\
    \ of the formal\n   organizational entity that might provide the proper environment,\n\
    \   focusing instead on the key components of any implementation of such\n   a\
    \ formalization, and how the formalization activity would address the\n   requirements\
    \ laid out in Section 3.\n   Having thus determined that formalization of the\
    \ IETF is seen as a\n   necessary step, the basic framework for 3 potential implementations\n\
    \   of it are described below.  Note that these are not complete\n   proposals,\
    \ nor is enough detail available to recommend a particular\n   path.  The IETF\
    \ leadership might select one to explore in greater\n   detail, to formulate an\
    \ action proposal with sufficient detail to\n   make a decision to act.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  ISOC
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  ISOC\n   The IETF is organized as an activity of the Internet Society.\
    \  One\n   potential path for increased formalism of the IETF's administration\n\
    \   would be to further define that relationship.  This model anticipates\n  \
    \ dedication of ISOC personnel to form the \"small staff complement\",\n   and\
    \ would make ISOC responsible for all of the IETF's financial\n   resources and\
    \ expenses.\n   This approach should be relatively straightforward to implement,\n\
    \   given ISOC's existing legal relationship with the IETF activity, and\n   its\
    \ status as signatory for IETF-related contracts (e.g., RFC\n   Editor).\n   This\
    \ proposal is consistent with the goal of minimizing the amount of\n   formalization\
    \ needed to meet the requirements of the IETF.\n   However, the general mission\
    \ of ISOC is broader than the\n   standardization activity of the IETF, and the\
    \ ISOC Board of Trustees\n   must stay focused on apportioning resources to meet\
    \ that broader\n   mission.  Would this approach allow the clear lines of responsibility\n\
    \   that are called for in Section 3?\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  ISOC Subsidiary
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  ISOC Subsidiary\n   A modification of the proposal of housing the IETF\
    \ central body\n   within ISOC is to create a legal not-for-profit subsidiary\
    \ of ISOC,\n   with a mandate that is specifically focused on the IETF's mission.\n\
    \   This subsidiary would become the legal entity responsible for\n   managing\
    \ the IETF's resources and expenses, and would become\n   signatory to any other\
    \ legal instruments on the IETF's behalf.\n   As a distinct legal entity in its\
    \ own right, the subsidiary would be\n   independently responsible for achieving\
    \ its mission.  That level of\n   independence addresses the concern raised against\
    \ the notion of\n   further formalizing the IETF within ISOC directly -- that\
    \ the IETF\n   mission might be disrupted by the organization's need to tend to\n\
    \   other aspects of ISOC's broader mission.  The role of the IETF\n   community,\
    \ and the ISOC parent, in defining and supporting that\n   mission would be spelled\
    \ out in the creation of the legal body.\n   The IETF might additionally consider\
    \ what the most appropriate\n   governance model would be for this approach. \
    \ If it is desirable to\n   remove some of the administrative burden from the\
    \ IESG and IAB, such\n   a subsidiary might have its own Board of Trustees, composed\
    \ of\n   members appointed by IETF and ISOC.  Such a Board would be\n   responsible\
    \ for reviewing activities and ensuring that the\n   organization's efforts were\
    \ adequately in line with its mission, its\n   finances were in order, and so\
    \ on.  The subsidiary would report to\n   its Board of Trustees. Other governance\
    \ models are certainly\n   possible, and a Board of Trustees is not a requirement\
    \ for this\n   approach.\n   At the same time, as a subsidiary organization, the\
    \ expectation is\n   that the relationship with ISOC would remain a close one:\
    \ the\n   subsidiary would benefit from ISOC's existing infrastructure and\n \
    \  support (a conservative approach to adding formalism and structural\n   overhead\
    \ to the IETF activity), while the relationship would continue\n   to provide\
    \ a channel for the IETF to support ISOC in achieving that\n   broader mission,\
    \ with continued contribution of technical expertise\n   and support of activities.\n\
    \   This approach would require more work to create than simply housing\n   the\
    \ work at ISOC.   The subsidiary would have to be created and\n   rights/responsibilities\
    \ adjusted between it and ISOC in order to\n   ensure that both have the necessary\
    \ resources and frameworks to carry\n   out their missions.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  Completely Autonomous Organizational Entity
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Completely Autonomous Organizational Entity\n   To complete the picture,\
    \ a third option has to be considered. Instead\n   of creating a subsidiary of\
    \ ISOC as a separate legal entity, an\n   entirely new legal entity, \"IETF, Inc.\"\
    , or \"IETF, LLC\", could be\n   created for the sole purpose of managing IETF\
    \ administrative\n   activities.\n   This would offer the IETF complete autonomy\
    \ with all the attendant\n   rights and responsibilities.  In particular, an independent\
    \ IETF\n   would at a minimum, need to operate much like a startup for the first\n\
    \   few years of its existence, with all the related financing and growth\n  \
    \ issues, and survival risks.  Given all the organizational change\n   taking\
    \ place within the IETF during the same period, the AdvComm\n   believes that\
    \ the financial and political risks of such an approach\n   should not be under-estimated.\n\
    \   For example, it would be necessary for the IETF to obtain initial\n   working\
    \ capital sufficient to handle the commitments for the first\n   few meetings.\
    \  While it would be conceivable to raise working capital\n   from advance meeting\
    \ fees, such a financing plan would not leave much\n   margin for error;  were\
    \ one or more of the initial meetings to run in\n   the red, the survival of a\
    \ fledgling IETF could be in jeopardy. Given\n   the economic environment, it\
    \ probably should not be assumed that\n   working capital could be raised purely\
    \ from corporate donations,\n   especially during an initial period in which staff\
    \ required to\n   solicit and manage donations would not be available.\n   Additionally,\
    \ the impact that such a move would have on ISOC's\n   ability to carry out its\
    \ mission and the IETF's standing with\n   governmental organizations needs to\
    \ be considered.\n"

    \ at the administrative overview of the IETF activity,  there\n   are a number\
    \ of things that work well:\n   o  support organizations are committed to the\
    \ work of the IETF;\n   o  the volunteers of the IETF WGs can (mostly) concentrate\
    \ on their\n      engineering work, not economics;\n   o  money has (so far) been\
    \ sufficient to cover the costs.\n   However, there are also a number of challenges:\n\
    \   o  lack of persistent records of the whole organization's efforts --\n   \
    \   of working documents, meeting materials, communications.  Also,\n      * \
    \ lack of organization of records -- even when data is stored, it\n         can\
    \ be hard or impossible to access when no longer current\n         (e.g., it may\
    \ reside on some former WG chair's hard drive)\n      *  history records are kept\
    \ spottily (lists of wg chairs and old\n         versions of charters, to mention\
    \ some);\n   o  few safeguards against the \"hit by a bus\" problem -- much\n\
    \      information about relationships is not documented, and must be\n      transferred\
    \ as oral tradition.  This means that significant\n      overlap is needed when\
    \ personnel changes;\n   o  IETF leadership responsibilities are not clearly identified\

    \      the financial impact of decisions are not available to IETF\n      leadership;\n\

    \ 6, 2003\n   *\n   * (1) Your description of the function you are performing.\
    \   Is\n   * that function, and its relationship to the IETF, adequately\n   *\
    \ described in RFC 2223bis, or is additional description\n   * required?  If the\
    \ latter, what would you suggest?\n   ANSWER:\n   A comprehensive summary of current\
    \ RFC Editor functions is attached\n   below.  Note that this list has no direct\
    \ relation to RFC 2223bis,\n   which contains instructions to RFC authors.\n \
    \  *\n   * (2) What staff is being used to perform these functions and\n   * what\
    \ are their particular skills for doing so (either\n   * individually or in the\
    \ aggregate)?\n   *\n   ANSWER:\n   For 30 years, the RFC Editor was Jon Postel,\
    \ a research scientist and\n   manager in the Networking Division of the USC Information\
    \ Sciences\n   Institute (ISI).  It is currently organized as a project within\
    \ ISI,\n   using the ISI infrastructure.  The following ISI staff members\n  \
    \ comprise the RFC Editor project:\n      Joyce Reynolds         100%\n      Bob\

    \ 50%\n   Braden and Reynolds jointly manage the RFC Editor project, with\n  \
    \ oversight of personnel and budgets.\n   Joyce Reynolds has been contributing\
    \ her editorial and management\n   skills to the Internet since 1979.  She performed\
    \ the IANA functions\n   under Jon Postel's direction from 1983 until Postel's\
    \ death in\n   October 1998.  She continued to perform the IANA protocol parameter\n\
    \   tasks on loan from ISI to ICANN, from 1998 to 2001.  She was IANA\n   liaison\
    \ to the IESG from 1998 to 2001, transitioning the role to\n   Michelle Cotton\
    \ in the 2001.\n   Reynolds performed the RFC Editor functions under Jon Postel's\n\
    \   direction from 1987 until 1998.  Reynolds has been a member of the\n   IETF\
    \ since 1988, and she served as User Services Area Director on the\n   IESG for\
    \ 10 years.  Reynolds now serves a liaison to the IAB and\n   IESG.  She handles\
    \ the final proofing and quality control on RFCs\n   prior to publication.\n \
    \  Bob Braden has made many contributions to the Internet protocol\n   technology\
    \ and community.  He helped design TCP/IP during the\n   original research period\
    \ beginning in 1978, and he has devoted his\n   professional career since 1978\
    \ to the Internet.  He served for 13\n   years on the original IAB and as its\
    \ Executive Director for about 5\n   years.  Since 1998 Braden has been co-leader\
    \ of the RFC Editor\n   project.  He is the principal reviewer of individual submissions.\
    \  He\n   also works on technical issues related to the RFC Editor project.\n\
    \   Aaron Falk is a significant player in the IETF as a Working Group\n   chair,\
    \ in the areas of transport protocols and satellite technology.\n   On the RFC\
    \ Editor team, he assists with policy questions and handles\n   technical development,\
    \ overseeing the work of the grad student\n   programmer.\n   Sandy Ginoza is\
    \ the principal technical editor.  She is generally\n   responsible for managing\
    \ the RFC Editor queue and much of the day-\n   to-day interface with the IESG\
    \ and authors.  Ginoza sends and\n   receives a LOT of email, and she plays a\
    \ central role in the\n   operation.\n   Two part-time Project Assistants, Mieke\
    \ Van de Kamp and Alison De La\n   Cruz, do editing, mark-up, and initial proofing\
    \ of individual RFCs.\n   Our goal is to have three pairs of eyes read every RFC\
    \ word-for-word,\n   and in most instances we are able to do so.\n   A half-time\
    \ USC Graduate Research Assistant provides programming\n   support by developing,\
    \ extending, and maintaining RFC Editor scripts\n   and tools.\n   * (3) What\
    \ criteria do you use to determine whether you are being\n   * successful, and\
    \ how successful?  Using those criteria, how\n   * successful are you and what\
    \ could be done, especially from the\n   * IETF side, to improve that evaluation?\n\
    \   ANSWER:\n   We can begin with a historical perspective on this question. \
    \ When\n   Jon Postel unexpectedly passed away 5 years ago, Reynolds and Braden\n\
    \   took on the challenge of carrying on Postel's RFC Editor function.\n   The\
    \ publication stream continued, with a modest increase in quantity\n   and, we\
    \ believe, no loss of quality.  Furthermore, the transition was\n   largely invisible\
    \ to the IETF.  In addition, the new RFC Editor\n   project has significantly\
    \ defined and clarified the publication\n   process, improved the web site, added\
    \ tools to improve productivity\n   and quality, and adapted the procedures to\
    \ changing realities.  We\n   are proud of these achievements.\n   The three primary\
    \ axes for measuring RFC Editor success are (1)\n   quantity, (2) quality, and\
    \ (3) accessibility.\n   1. Quantity\n      Roughly, quantitative success means\
    \ the ability to keep up with\n      the submission rate.  Since the submission\
    \ rate tends to be\n      bursty, to avoid long delays we need an average capacity\
    \ somewhat\n      in excess of the average.\n      RFC publication is necessarily\
    \ a heavily labor-intensive process.\n      Our goal is generally to complete\
    \ the publication process in less\n      than 4 weeks, exclusive of external factors\
    \ beyond our control --\n      normative dependence upon other documents, delays\
    \ by authors or\n      the IESG, IANA delays, etc.\n   2. Quality\n      Publication\
    \ quality is harder to measure, but \"we know it when we\n      see it.\"  Considering\
    \ quality as the absence of faults, by noting\n      faults we can observe lack\
    \ of quality.\n      One measure of faults is the number of errata that appear\
    \ after\n      publication.  In addition, there may be faults apparent to a\n\
    \      reader, such as a meaningless title, confusing organization,\n      useless\
    \ Abstract, inadequate introduction, confusing formatting,\n      bad sentences,\
    \ or bad grammar.  There are of course limits to our\n      ability to repair\
    \ bad writing; ultimately, quality depends upon\n      the authors as well as\
    \ the editing process.\n      The only way to maintain quality is to continually\
    \ monitor our\n      work internally, to track external complaints, and to adjust\
    \ our\n      practice to correct frequent faults.  Specific faults have\n    \
    \  sometimes led us to create new tools for checking consistency, to\n      avoid\
    \ clerical errors.  Sometimes they have led to new user\n      guidelines (e.g.,\
    \ on abbreviations or on Abstract sections.)\n   3. Accessibility\n      An important\
    \ part of the RFC Editor function is to provide a\n      database for locating\
    \ relevant RFCs.  This is actually a very hard\n      problem, because there is\
    \ often a complex semantic web among RFCs\n      on a particular topic.  We have\
    \ made great improvements in our\n      search engine and web site, but there\
    \ is undoubtedly a need for\n      more progress in this area.  The challenge\
    \ is to provide better\n      guideposts to users without creating a significant\
    \ additional\n      manpower requirement.\n      We make heavy use of our own\
    \ search and access tools, and this\n      gives us feedback on their success\
    \ and sometimes suggests\n      improvements.\n   Finally, we offer some specific\
    \ suggestions to answer the question,\n   \"What can the IETF do to improve the\
    \ RFC Editor's evaluation\" (i.e.,\n   our service to the community)?\n   1. Give\
    \ us better documents to publish.  Many are well written and\n      organized,\
    \ but some are bad and a few are very bad and need a\n      great deal of work\
    \ to create acceptable publications.  Better\n      input documents will improve\
    \ both our quantity and our quality.\n      The IESG has been making a large effort\
    \ to improve the quality of\n      Internet Drafts before they become RFCs, and\
    \ we are very grateful\n      for this.\n      One issue of particular concern\
    \ is the increasing number of RFCs\n      authored by non-English speakers.  These\
    \ can consume much extra\n      editorial effort.  We don't know any solution\
    \ to this problem, but\n      we know that the IESG is aware of it and working\
    \ with them to\n      provide editorial assistance when necessary within working\
    \ groups.\n   2. Prepare a series of RFCs containing \"road maps\" that describe\
    \ the\n      semantic web of RFCs in a particular area.  Although these would\n\
    \      rapidly become out-dated in detail, they would still provide very\n   \
    \   important guides to RFC readers.\n   The RFC Editor is as self-critical as\
    \ any organization could be, but\n   we believe there is no objective basis for\
    \ claiming that we are not\n   doing a good job for the Internet.  We continually\
    \ strive to do a\n   better job.\n   *\n   * (4) How would you characterize the\
    \ quality of your relationship\n   * with the IETF and its leadership?  Is there\
    \ mutual trust and a\n   * sense of working together on issues, or do you and\
    \ your\n   * colleagues sometimes see the relationship as adversarial?\n   *\n\
    \   ANSWER:\n   The RFC Editor shares with much of the rest of the Internet community\n\
    \   a deep desire to advance the technology and practice of the Internet.\n  \
    \ We consider ourselves partners with the IETF, the IESG, and the IAB\n   in this\
    \ endeavor.\n   Although the major goals coincide, the IESG and the RFC Editor\
    \ quite\n   properly have somewhat different priorities.  The RFC Editor's role,\n\
    \   historically and currently, is to create and maintain the RFC\n   document\
    \ series as a high-quality and vital channel for technical\n   communication,\
    \ while the IESG is concerned with managing the Internet\n   engineering and standards\
    \ process.  This difference sometimes leads\n   to honest disagreements, but we\
    \ have generally worked out mutually-\n   satisfactory solutions to these conflicts.\n\
    \   The word \"adversarial\" seems completely inappropriate, and we are\n   struggling\
    \ to understand what could have led to its appearance here.\n   * (5) Are there\
    \ specific known problems you would like us to look\n   * at and understand? \
    \ If so, please describe them.\n   ANSWER:\n   (A) The length of time for IESG\
    \ review and recommendations on\n       individual submissions has sometimes become\
    \ excessive.  We\n       understand the load of IESG members, but we would like\
    \ to ask\n       their help in keeping response to a few months.\n       The RFC\
    \ Editor has been attempting to raise the bar on accepting\n       individual\
    \ submissions, to avoid wasting valuable IESG time as\n       well as to maintain\
    \ (or improve) the quality of the RFC series.\n   (B) We would like understanding\
    \ and support of the RFC Editor's\n       statutory and historic responsibility\
    \ to publish significant\n       technical documents about networking that originate\
    \ outside the\n       IETF standards process.  This publication has several important\n\
    \       purposes.\n       One is to bring out new technical ideas for consideration\
    \ and\n       discussion.  We believe that the future success of the Internet\n\
    \       demands an infusion of new ideas (or old ideas revitalized), and\n   \
    \    that the publication of such ideas as RFCs is important.\n       Another\
    \ purpose is to build a shared literature of mature\n       technical discussion,\
    \ to help avoid the periodic re-discussions\n       that take place on our mailing\
    \ lists.\n       Finally, the RFC series provides a historic repository for\n\
    \       important ideas.  We have come across a number of examples of\n      \
    \ important suggestions and partial technology developments that\n       have\
    \ been lost, or hard to locate, because they were not\n       published as RFCs.\
    \  The community spends too much of our time\n       re-inventing many, many wheels.\n\
    \       Our ultimate goal is to publish more high-quality submissions, so\n  \
    \     we can raise the bar for publication.\n       Independent submission publications\
    \ represent only a minor\n       fraction of the RFC production.  For example,\
    \ so far in calendar\n       2003 we have published 178 RFCs, including 14 independent\n\
    \       submissions.  If all the drafts that we think deserve to be\n       preserved\
    \ as RFCs were to be published, this fraction would grow,\n       but we would\
    \ not expect it to grow beyond 25% of the total number\n       of published RFCs.\n\
    \   (C) We would like to work with the IAB/IESG in re-examining the issue\n  \
    \     of normative references.  We believe that the current definition\n     \
    \  of normative is ambiguous and unclear, and that as a result some\n       publications\
    \ may be unnecessarily held up for normative\n       references where these are\
    \ unnecessary.\n   (D) We would like to cooperate in an investigation of the issues\
    \ in\n       extending the character set beyond US-ASCII, .e.g., to UTF-8.  A\n\
    \       major issue is whether there is a set of preparation, display,\n     \
    \  and searching tools for both the RFC Editor and the RFC\n       consumers.\
    \  These tools need to be ubiquitously available and\n       mature enough.\n\
    \   The RFC Editor is looking for input on how we can best continue to\n   serve\
    \ the community.  We are grateful for the suggestions we have\n   received, and\
    \ we have adopted as many of them as feasible; the result\n   has been quite a\
    \ long list of incremental improvements in our service\n   over the past 5 years.\n\
    \   *\n   * (6) How do you see the costs of your function evolving?  If\n   *\
    \ things become more costly over time, what are the main\n   * determiners of\
    \ cost (e.g., general inflation, general IETF\n   * growth, increase in the number\
    \ of particular functions you are\n   * carried out to perform,...).  Are you\
    \ doing some things that\n   * IETF (IESG or otherwise) request that you do not\
    \ consider\n   * cost-effective and, if so, what are they?\n   *\n   *\n   ANSWER:\n\
    \   The major cost factor is the number of documents submitted and\n   published.\
    \  This has grown relatively slowly over time.  It appears\n   to us that the\
    \ IETF process has (perhaps fortunately) been the\n   bottleneck that has kept\
    \ the rate of RFC production from growing\n   exponentially.  We do not expect\
    \ that to change dramatically.\n   In more detail, the cost factors are:\n   \
    \   (a) Inflation (on salaries)\n          This shows a small and predictable\
    \ annual increase.\n      (b) The number of RFCs published.\n          This is\
    \ the primary cost factor.  The bulk of the editorial\n          and coordinating\
    \ functions are directly attributable to\n          specific documents.  At present,\
    \ we estimate that this cost\n          category represents 70% of our personnel\
    \ time, and 63% of our\n          cost.\n      (c) Tasks not directly related\
    \ to specific RFCs.\n          This includes many functions: management (budget\
    \ and personnel\n          as well as policy and procedure development), IETF\
    \ liaison,\n          reviews of independent submissions, development and\n  \
    \        maintenance of web pages, scripts, and tools, the RFC Online\n      \
    \    project, maintaining the Errata web page, etc.  These are\n          currently\
    \ estimated to require 30% of our personnel time, and\n          37% of our cost.\n\
    \   Minor extensions of function can be absorbed with little extra cost\n   (but\
    \ at a leisurely pace).  We are not proposing any major functional\n   extensions\
    \ at this time; such extensions would have to be costed\n   separately (were money\
    \ available for them.)\n   Disk storage and web services are provided by ISI's\
    \ support\n   organization and are treated as overhead.  Most of the desktop\n\
    \   machines used by the project were originally bought under research\n   contracts,\
    \ although the RFC Editor budget includes a very small item\n   for equipment\
    \ upgrades.\n"

  - "APPENDIX -- FUNCTIONS OF RFC EDITOR\n   OVERVIEW\n   The RFC Editor edits and\
    \ publishes the archival series of RFC\n   (originally \"Request for Comment\"\
    ) documents.  The RFCs form an\n   archival series of memos about computer communication\
    \ and packet\n   switching networks that records the technical history of the\
    \ ARPAnet\n   and the Internet, beginning in 1969.  The RFC Editor is funded by\
    \ the\n   Internet Society and operates under the general direction of the IAB\n\
    \   (Internet Architecture Board).\n   The RFC Editor publishes RFCs and a master\
    \ index of the RFC series\n   electronically on the Internet, via all common access\
    \ protocols\n   (currently, the Web, email, rsync, and FTP).  It announces the\n\
    \   existence of each new RFC via electronic mail to one or more mailing\n   lists.\
    \  The RFC Editor maintains a comprehensive web site with a\n   variety of tools\
    \ and lists to locate and access RFCs.  This website\n   also contains general\
    \ information about RFC editorial policies,\n   publication queue status, errata,\
    \ and any other information that will\n   make the RFC series more accessible\
    \ and more useful.\n   During the RFC editing process, the RFC Editor strives\
    \ for quality,\n   clarity, and consistency of style and format.  Editorial guidelines\n\
    \   and procedures to achieve these ends are established by the RFC\n   Editor\
    \ in consultation with the IAB and IESG (Internet Engineering\n   Steering Group).\
    \  The RFC Editor periodically publishes a revision of\n   these its guidelines\
    \ to authors.\n   The RFC Editor coordinates closely with the IESG to carry out\
    \ the\n   Internet standards process as documented in the latest revision of\n\
    \   \"The Internet Standards Process\" and later amendments.  The RFC\n   Editor\
    \ also coordinates closely with the Internet Assigned Numbers\n   Authority (IANA),\
    \ to ensure that the parameters used in new and\n   revised protocol descriptions\
    \ are properly registered.\n   SPECIFIC TASKS\n   I. Editing and publishing RFCs\n\
    \   (1) Publication process.  The RFC Editor edits and publishes RFCs in\n   \
    \   accordance with RFC 2026 (or replacement documents) and RFC\n      2223bis.\
    \  This includes the following tasks:\n      (a) Performing the final editing\
    \ of the documents to maintain\n          consistency of style, editorial standards,\
    \ and clarity.\n          At minimum, the RFC Editor:\n          (i)    Copy-edits\
    \ the documents, including the correction of\n                 spelling and grammar,\
    \ and some checking for\n                 inconsistent notation.  Ambiguous sentences\
    \ are\n                 resolved with the authors.\n          (ii)   Enforces\
    \ the formatting rules of Section 3 of RFC\n                 2223bis\n       \
    \   (iii)  Ensures that sections follow guidelines and rules of\n            \
    \     Section 4 of RFC 2223bis.\n          (iv)   Verifies the consistency of\
    \ references and citations,\n                 and verifies contents of references\
    \ to RFCs and I-Ds.\n          (v)    Verifies that all normative dependencies\
    \ have been\n                 satisfied.\n          (vi)   Verifies that guidelines\
    \ from Section 2 of RFC 2223bis\n                 are followed, with respect to:\
    \ URLs, titles,\n                 abbreviations, IANA Considerations, author lists,\
    \ and\n                 Requirement-Level words.\n          (vii)  Typesets the\
    \ documents in the standard RFC style.\n          (viii) Verifies the correctness\
    \ of published MIBs and ABNF\n                 fragments, using compilers.\n \
    \     (b) Providing authors with a review period of no less than 48\n        \
    \  hours to approve the document.\n      (c) Publishing new RFCs online by installing\
    \ them in the official\n          RFC archive, which is accessible via HTTP, FTP,\
    \ and SMTP.  The\n          RFC Editor also provides compressed aggregate files\
    \ of subsets\n          of the complete RFC series, accessible via HTTP and FTP.\
    \  PDF\n          facsimiles are also maintained for all .txt RFCs.\n      (d)\
    \ Publicly announcing the availability of new RFCs via a mailing\n          list.\n\
    \      (e) Coordinating with the IANA for assignment of protocol\n          parameter\
    \ values for RFCs in the submission queue.\n      (f) Coordinating closely with\
    \ the IESG to ensure that the rules of\n          RFC 2026 (or replacement) are\
    \ followed.  RFC Editor personnel\n          attend IETF meetings.  A designated\
    \ RFC Editor person serves\n          as liaison to the IAB and IESG.\n   (2)\
    \ Individual Submission Publication\n      The RFC Editor publishes technically\
    \ competent and useful\n      documents that arise outside the IETF process, in\
    \ accordance with\n      RFC 2026.  The RFC Editor makes the final determination\
    \ on the\n      publishability of such documents, with review by the IESG and\n\
    \      input from knowledgeable persons.\n      The RFC Editor reviews all such\
    \ documents for acceptable editorial\n      quality and for content, and works\

    \ level.\n   (3) Online RFC meta-information\n      The RFC editor publishes the\
    \ following status information via the\n      Web and FTP.\n      (a) A list of\
    \ all RFCs currently published, including complete\n          bibliographic information\

    \                          IAB Advisory Committee\n                          \
    \   November 7, 2003\n   * (1) Your description of the function you are performing.\
    \  Is that\n   * function, and its relationship to the IETF, adequately\n   *\
    \ understood for working purposes, or is additional description\n   * required?\
    \  If the latter, what would you suggest?\n   The Secretariat work is divided\
    \ into four parts: Meeting Planning, WG\n   support, IESG support, and IETF Community\
    \ support.\n   IETF meeting planning includes: identifying venues; negotiating\n\
    \   contracts; working closely with the WG chairs and the IESG to\n   schedule\
    \ events and avoid conflicts; preparing the agendas for the WG\n   sessions; arranging\
    \ for F&B and AV; handling registration; seeking\n   and signing up hosts; providing\
    \ Internet access, a terminal room, and\n   a wireless network when a host is\
    \ not available; providing on-site\n   support; and preparing the proceedings.\
    \  Meeting planning also may\n   include organizing the IESG retreat.\n   WG support\
    \ includes: maintaining and updating charters, milestones,\n   and other information\
    \ for the 140+ WGs; tracking changes in chairs;\n   hosting and archiving the\
    \ discussion mailing lists; and processing\n   requests to publish IDs as RFCs.\n\
    \   IESG support includes: providing all support required for IESG\n   teleconferences,\
    \ which take place every two weeks and cover as many\n   as 20+ documents each\
    \ (i.e., processing \"Last Calls\", preparing the\n   agenda and package, moderating\
    \ the teleconference, preparing the\n   minutes, sending out approval announcements,\
    \ and updating the\n   information in the ID Tracker); tracking the movement of\
    \ I-Ds to\n   RFCs; interfacing with the RFC Editor; performing administrative\n\
    \   functions associated with WG creation, rechartering, and closing;\n   maintaining\
    \ the internal IESG Web pages; sending miscellaneous\n   message to the IETF announcement\
    \ list on behalf of the IESG, and\n   posting them to the Web site, where applicable\
    \ (e.g., appeals to the\n   IESG and IESG responses to appeals); providing support\
    \ to the NomCom,\n   as needed (i.e., sending announcements, hosting/updating\
    \ the Web\n   site, arranging for conference calls); and developing Web-based\
    \ tools\n   to support IESG decision-making.\n   IETF Community support includes:\
    \ running the IETF meetings; hosting\n   the IETF Web site, and keeping the web\
    \ site it up to date; hosting\n   the IETF announcement and discussion lists;\
    \ responding to enquiries\n   sent to the IETF Secretariat, the Executive Director,\
    \ the meeting\n   Registrar, the Webmaster, and the trouble-ticket systems; processing\n\
    \   Intellectual Property Rights Notices; processing Liaison Statements;\n   and\
    \ posting I-Ds.\n   * (2) What staff is being used to perform these functions\
    \ and\n   * what are their particular skills for doing so (either\n   * individually\
    \ or in the aggregate)?\n     -- Three people perform administrative functions.\n\
    \     -- Four-and-a-half people perform technical support.\n     -- One-and-a-half\
    \ people do development.\n     -- Three people do maintenance.\n   * (3) What\
    \ criteria do you use to determine whether you are being\n   * successful, and\
    \ how successful?  Using those criteria, how\n   * successful are you and what\
    \ could be done, especially from the\n   * IETF side, to improve that evaluation?\n\
    \   The continued efficient operation and evolution of the Internet is\n   one\
    \ important goal and challenge facing the IETF, and also the IETF\n   Secretariat.\
    \  Working together to assist the IETF in performing this\n   important function\
    \ has been a motivating factor in CNRI's support for\n   almost 15 years.  The\
    \ criteria followed by CNRI, and (more recently)\n   its subsidiary Foretec, in\
    \ their efforts on behalf of the entire\n   Internet community is to provide a\
    \ consistent and dependable\n   mechanism that enables those persons interested\
    \ in the many and\n   varied issues that are raised within the IETF to perform\
    \ their\n   important work in the Internet standards process unburdened by the\n\
    \   routine administrative tasks associated with such endeavors.  While I\n  \
    \ think this has been a successful activity over many years, there is\n   always\
    \ room for improvement; and a continuing dialogue between CNRI,\n   ISOC, and\
    \ the IETF leadership is useful for this purpose.  High on my\n   list of suggestions\
    \ would be finding a way to increase the funds\n   available to meet the increasing\
    \ demands placed on the Secretariat.\n   We can no longer depend only on attendance\
    \ fees at meetings for this\n   purpose.\n   * (4) How would you characterize\
    \ the quality of your relationship\n   * with the IETF and its leadership?  Is\
    \ there mutual trust and a\n   * sense of working together on issues, or do you\
    \ and your\n   * colleagues sometimes see the relationship as adversarial?\n \
    \  While the Foretec management may have issues arising from day to day\n   workflow\
    \ demands on limited resources, CNRI values the trusted\n   relationship we have\
    \ had with the IETF community.    The issue is\n   cooperating in the development\
    \ of new funding sources, and learning\n   to live within the available resources.\
    \  There is also an issue about\n   effective lines of authority for the purpose\
    \ of carrying out certain\n   aspects of the overall standards process.  There\
    \ are many demands and\n   pressures on the IESG and hence on the Secretariat.\
    \  These workflow\n   demands need to be addressed in a more systematic way for\
    \ the benefit\n   of all.\n   * (5) Are there specific known problems you would\
    \ like us to look\n   * at and understand?  If so, please describe them.\n   Workload\
    \ is high.  Given the budgetary constraints that the\n   Secretariat is under,\
    \ there are no resources to take on additional\n   work.  The staff supporting\
    \ all areas are working overtime just to\n   keep up with the current workload.\n\
    \   The Secretariat does not believe that the IETF Community appreciates\n   the\
    \ scope of the tasks.  The Secretariat is automating more tasks,\n   hopefully\
    \ reducing the overall workload.  There is a long queue of\n   requests for new\
    \ features in the tools that the Secretariat has\n   built.  There is not money\
    \ to hire more developers.  The IETF\n   Executive Director is documenting processes.\
    \  This has naturally\n   caused discussion about whether the processes are what\
    \ everyone wants\n   the processes to be.  While expected, it also increases workload.\n\
    \   * (6) How do you see the costs of your function evolving?  If\n   * things\
    \ become more costly over time, what are the main\n   * determiners of cost (e.g.,\
    \ general inflation, general IETF\n   * growth, increase in the number of particular\
    \ functions you are\n   * carried out to perform,...).  Are you doing some things\
    \ that\n   * IETF (IESG or otherwise) request that you do not consider\n   * cost-effective\
    \ and, if so, what are they?\n   The total budget for IETF-related activities\
    \ at Foretec last year was\n   about $2.5M.  The vast bulk was covered by IETF\
    \ meeting fees, but the\n   shortfall was covered by contributions from CNRI and\
    \ Foretec.\n   CNRI has been asked by its Board to find a solution to the problem.\n"

    \ Assignment\n            Responses to Questions from IAB Advisory Committee\n\
    \            for the IANA Protocol Parameter Assignment Function\n           \
    \                  November 7, 2003\n   * (1) Your description of the function\
    \ you are performing.   Is that\n   * function, and its relationship to the IETF,\
    \ adequately described in\n   * RFC 2860 (the MOU) and RFC 2434 (Guidelines for\
    \ IANA\n   * considerations), or is additional description required?  If the\n\
    \   * latter, what would you suggest?\n   Per Michelle [Cotton, IANA], RFC 2860\
    \ probably remains sufficient as\n   an MOU describing the functions that the\
    \ IANA provides to the IETF.\n   That office consists of, effective soon, a manager,\
    \ three technical\n   clerical staff (four full-time equivalents) plus half a\
    \ dozen people\n   on a consulting basis, performing functions for the IETF and\
    \ the\n   RIRs.  The portion of that effort supporting IETF parameter\n   assignment\
    \ is roughly a full-time-equivalent plus software support\n   and normal management/employment\
    \ overheads.  Fundamentally, the IETF\n   parameter assignment function consists\
    \ of accepting requests for\n   protocol numbers for extensible protocols (such\
    \ as IP Protocol, PPP\n   PID, TCP/UDP Port, and the like), validating them according\
    \ to\n   business rules, identifying the appropriate registry, and in some\n \
    \  cases portion of a registry, assigning the number, and documenting\n   the\
    \ result.\n   RFC 2434 has served the IANA staff well as a guide, but is now in\n\
    \   need of updating.  Specific concerns with the document relate to the\n   meaning\
    \ of terms and the specificity of the information provided to\n   the IANA in\
    \ internet drafts.\n   One issue relates to the meaning of the term \"IETF consensus\"\
    .  When\n   a document has passed through a defined consensus process, such as\
    \ a\n   working group, this is straightforward.  When requests come to IANA\n\
    \   that have not done so, IANA needs specific guidance on IETF\n   expectations.\
    \  This generally comes in the form of AD direction or\n   consulting advice.\
    \  An improved process would help, though; business\n   rules that inform the\
    \ IANA when a new registry is appropriate, and\n   what rules should be applied\
    \ in assignment of values in any given\n   registry, for example, would help.\n\
    \   Parameter assignment being an essentially clerical function, specific\n  \
    \ guidance to the clerical staff is absolutely mandatory, and often\n   lacking\
    \ or unclear.  In IANA's dreams, every internet draft would\n   contain an IANA\
    \ Considerations section, even if all it said was \"IANA\n   need not concern\
    \ itself with this draft\".  In the absence of such a\n   statement, the IESG's\
    \ IANA Liaison is forced to read the entire\n   document at least twice: once\
    \ when the IESG is first handed the\n   document, to ensure that any instructions\
    \ to IANA are clear, and\n   again when the IESG hands the document on, to ensure\
    \ that it can\n   perform the requests the draft makes.  This is clearly time-consuming\n\
    \   and prone to error.\n   IANA is now receiving a certain level of instruction\
    \ in internet\n   drafts, which is good.  However, even the present level of advice\
    \ is\n   frequently lacking in clarity.  For example, a PPP NCP definition\n \
    \  might well require the assignment of two PIDs, one for the data\n   exchange\
    \ and one for the NCP itself.  These two numbers come from\n   four very separate\
    \ ranges: 0001..00FF, 0101..7FFF, 8001..BFFF, and\n   C001..FFFF.  The choice\
    \ of range is important, especially on low\n   speed lines using byte-oriented\
    \ asynchronous transmission, as the\n   data assignment has a trade-off implied\
    \ for the relative frequency of\n   messages using the specified protocol, and\
    \ the control function PIDs\n   are partitioned as well.  In such a case, IANA\
    \ needs to know not that\n   \"two PIDs are required\", but that \"two PPP PIDs\
    \ are required, the\n   data PID named <d-name$gt; defined in section <> from\
    \ the range\n   0001..00FF, and the control PID named <c-name$gt; defined in section\n\
    \   <> from the range 8001..BFFF\".\n   Descriptions of registries to be designed\
    \ need to be equally clear.\n   If the specification says in its IANA Considerations\
    \ section that \"a\n   registry named 'Fubar Code Points' should be built; the\
    \ initial\n   values in a table <name> and IANA may assign additional values in\
    \ any\n   remaining value between the last initial code point and 65535\", that\n\
    \   is exactly what will happen.  If there are additional expectations,\n   such\
    \ as \"the working group's assigned number advisor will be asked\"\n   or \"all\
    \ assignments must be made in an RFC of informational or\n   standard status\"\
    , they won't necessarily be met - unless the IANA\n   Considerations section specifies\
    \ as much.  What you put in the IANA\n   Considerations section is what will be\
    \ followed.  It should be made\n   clear so that the implementors get what they\
    \ requested.  Also, clear\n   IANA Considerations sections also help the community,\
    \ not only IANA.\n   It makes (1) the authors think about all aspects of the creation\
    \ of a\n   registry and instructions on how to maintain but also (2) the public\n\
    \   knows and understands the new registry instructions and how they can\n   get\
    \ assignments/registrations in that registry.\n   Something that would materially\
    \ help the IANA in its evaluation of\n   internet drafts is a comment tracking\
    \ system on the IETF side.  The\n   IANA's use of such a system is apparent: any\
    \ comments it makes on the\n   draft would appear in the system, where the IESG\
    \ may readily retrieve\n   them, and the IANA can find its comments when the draft\
    \ later comes\n   there.  To be truly helpful, it should also include at least\
    \ any last\n   call IETF commentary and AD commentary, including agreed changes\
    \ to\n   the document.  This would permit IANA to review those notes as well,\n\
    \   which may in turn elicit further IANA commentary (\"if you make that\n   change,\
    \ you should also specify <> in the IANA Considerations\n   section\") or may\
    \ guide IANA's implementation.\n   Normative references apply to IANA considerations\
    \ as well as to other\n   parts of the specification.  Recently, the IESG started\
    \ passing\n   documents along prior to other documents normative for them, allowing\n\
    \   them to sit in later queues to synchronize with their normative\n   documents.\
    \  In the special case where the normative document defines\n   a registry and\
    \ the draft under discussion assigns a value from that\n   registry, this case\
    \ needs to be handled in queue and in process like\n   any other normative reference.\n\
    \   * (2) What staff is being used to perform these functions and what\n   * are\
    \ their particular skills for doing so (either individually or\n   * in the aggregate)?\n\
    \   The staff assigned to this function, on 4 November 2003, includes\n   Michelle\
    \ Cotton and an assistant.  They are essentially intelligent\n   clerical staff\
    \ familiar with computer back office applications, but\n   otherwise with no special\
    \ technical training.  For technical\n   questions, they depend heavily on advisors\
    \ within IANA or assigned by\n   the IETF.\n   It should be kept in mind that\
    \ it is not the IANA's job to understand\n   how every protocol works that is\
    \ being defined in a new registry.\n   The IANA needs to know how to create and\
    \ maintain the registry\n   administratively.\n   * (3) What criteria do you use\
    \ to determine whether you are being\n   * successful, and how successful?  Using\
    \ those criteria, how\n   * successful are you and what could be done, especially\
    \ from the IETF\n   * side, to improve that evaluation?\n   The basic measure\
    \ of success is the number of assignments made.\n   Michelle's sense is that IANA\
    \ is now moderately successful, however\n   further improvement can be made internally\
    \ and externally.\n   Paul is defining web-based automation which should help\
    \ various\n   aspects of IANA's work, including in part the IETF IANA function.\n\
    \   Michelle believes that this automation will materially help her\n   timeliness.\
    \  But for that to be carried out properly, clear business\n   guidelines must\
    \ be given IANA for each of the existing registries,\n   guidelines whose application\
    \ can be readily automated.  This is\n   likely an IETF effort, or at least requires\
    \ serious IETF input.\n   * (4) How would you characterize the quality of your\
    \ relationship\n   * with the IETF and its leadership?  Is there mutual trust\
    \ and a\n   * sense of working together on issues, or do you and your\n   * colleagues\
    \ sometimes see the relationship as adversarial?\n   At this point, Michelle feels\
    \ that IETF/IAB leadership is friendly\n   and generally constructive.  She is\
    \ very cognizant of AD workload,\n   and as such tries to focus questions and\
    \ find other people to ask\n   them of.  As such, she perceives the communication\
    \ level and volume\n   to be on the light side of \"about right\".\n   Again,\
    \ amplified clarity of IESG/WG policy would reduce her question\n   load, and\
    \ there may be utility for an IAB liaison from the IANA such\n   as IANA has with\
    \ the IESG.  That is really a question for the IAB; if\n   it has questions for\
    \ IANA, the chair should feel free to invite her\n   comment or invite a liaison.\n\
    \   * (5) Are there specific known problems you would like us to look at\n   *\
    \ and understand?  If so, please describe them.\n   This note has made a point\
    \ concerning clarity of instructions,\n   clarity of policy, and clarity of registries.\
    \  There is ongoing work\n   at IANA to clean up registry files inherited when\
    \ IANA was split out\n   from the RFC Editor's office; in dealing with the business\n\
    \   considerations questions already raised, it may be helpful for a\n   tiger\
    \ team from the IETF to review their registries with them and\n   make suggestions.\n\
    \   There is an ongoing problem with receiving announcements concerning\n   at\
    \ least some internet drafts.  Michelle plans to follow up with the\n   Secretariat\
    \ on this, but in short it appears that the IANA liaison is\n   not copied on\
    \ at least some list that internet draft actions are\n   announced on.  This seems\
    \ to pertain to individual submissions that\n   the IESG advises the RFC Editor\
    \ that it \"has no problem\" publishing.\n   * (6) How do you see the costs of\
    \ your function evolving?  If things\n   * become more costly over time, what\
    \ are the main determiners of\n   * cost (e.g., general inflation, general IETF\
    \ growth, increase in the\n   * number of particular functions you are carried\
    \ out to\n   * perform,...).  Are you doing some things that IETF (IESG or\n \
    \  * otherwise) request that you do not consider cost-effective and,\n   * if\
    \ so, what are they?\n   As detailed, the function described in RFC 2860 represents\n\
    \   approximately a person-equivalent, plus facilities, software support,\n  \
    \ and standard business loading.  This has been the approximate load\n   level\
    \ for at least the past five years, and is projected to remain\n   about the same\
    \ for the near future.  The cost-effectiveness issues\n   revolve around human-in-the-loop\
    \ effort involved in reading drafts,\n   investigating inquiries, and such that\
    \ have been detailed here.  The\n   sense is that an effective comment management\
    \ system plus the work\n   flow systems ICANN is planning to implement should\
    \ result in a net\n   near term improvement in efficiency and timeliness; projected\
    \ IETF\n   growth should then consume that improvement over time.\n"
