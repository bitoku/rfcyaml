Abstract This document describes four options for Network Information Service (NIS) related configuration information in Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6): NIS Servers, NIS  Servers, NIS Client Domain Name, NIS  Client Domain name.
This document describes four options for passing configuration information related to Network Information Service (NIS) [3] in DHCPv6
The options defined in this document can only be used to configure information about NIS servers that can be reached using IPv6.
The DHCP option to configure information about IPv4 NIS servers can be found in RFC 2132 [4].
dual  stack applications are being considered, but are not specified in this document.
The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL,
SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2].
Throughout this document, unless otherwise specified, the acronym DHCP refers to DHCP as specified in RFC 3315.
This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCP as defined in section "Terminology" of RFC 3315.
The Network Information Service (NIS)
Servers option provides a list of one or more IPv6 addresses of NIS servers available to the client.
Clients MUST treat the list of NIS servers as an ordered list.
The server MAY list the NIS servers in the order of preference.
OPTION NIS SERVERS (27) option len:
Length of the 'NIS server' fields in octets; It must be a multiple of 16 NIS server:
IPv6 address of NIS server 4.
Network Information Service V2 (
The Network Information Service V2 (
NIS ) Servers option provides a list of one or more IPv6 addresses of NIS  servers available to the client.
Clients MUST treat the list of NIS  servers as an ordered list.
The server MAY list the NIS  servers in the order of preference.
option len:  Length of the 'NIS  server' fields in octets
; It must be a multiple of 16 NIS  server: IPv6 address of NIS  server 5.
Network Information Service (NIS) Domain Name Option
The Network Information Service (NIS) Domain Name option is used by the server to convey client's NIS Domain Name info to the client.
OPTION NIS DOMAIN NAME (29) option len:
Length of the 'nis domain name' field in octets nis domain name:
NIS Domain name for client
The 'nis domain name' MUST be encoded as specified in section "Representation and Use of domain names" of the DHCPv6 specification [1].
Network Information Service V2 (NIS )
The Network Information Service V2 (NIS ) Domain Name option is used by the server to convey client's NIS  Domain Name info to the client.
OPTION NISP DOMAIN NAME (30)
NIS  Domain name for client
The 'nisp domain name' MUST be encoded as specified in section "Representation and Use of domain names" of the DHCPv6 specification [1].
The NIS servers, NIS  servers, NIS domain name and NIS  domain name options MUST NOT appear in other than the following messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information Request and Reply.
The option number for these options MAY appear in the Option Request Option [1] in the following messages: Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information Request and Reconfigure.
The NIS servers, NIS  servers, NIS domain name and NIS  domain name options may be used by an intruder DHCPv6 server to assign invalid NIS parameters, resulting in clients unable to use NIS service.
The NIS servers and NIS  servers options may be used by an intruder DHCPv6 server to cause the DHCPv6 clients to send their queries to an intruder NIS/NIS  server.
This misdirected searches may be used to spoof NIS/NIS  names.
The NIS domain name and NIS  domain name options may be used by an intruder DHCPv6 server to cause the DHCPv6 clients to search through invalid domains for incompletely specified domain names.
The results of these misdirected searches may be used to spoof NIS/NIS  names.
To avoid attacks through these options, the DHCPv6 client SHOULD use authenticated DHCP (see section "Authentication of DHCP messages" in the DHCPv6 specification [1]).
The IANA has assigned option codes to the following options from the option code space defined in "DHCPv6 Options" section of the DHCPv6 specification [1].
