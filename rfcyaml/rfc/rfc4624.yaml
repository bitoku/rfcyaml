  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [7].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined\
    \ in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a\
    \ MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [4], STD 58, RFC 2579 [5] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [6].\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   This MIB module contains four scalars and four tables, one\n\
    \   deprecated.  The tables are:\n   o  The deprecated Requests Table, containing\
    \ the longest-match table\n      used to determine the peer to send SA-Requests\
    \ to for a given\n      group.  This table is deprecated because Requests were\
    \ removed\n      from MSDP before it became an RFC.\n   o  The Peer Table, containing\
    \ information on the system's peers.\n   o  The Source-Active (SA) Cache Table,\
    \ containing the SA cache\n      entries.\n   o  The Mesh Group Table, containing\
    \ the list of MSDP mesh groups to\n      which this system belongs.\n   This MIB\
    \ module uses the IpAddress SYNTAX, making it only suitable\n   for IPv4 systems.\
    \  Although the desired direction for MIBs is to use\n   InetAddressType/InetAddress\
    \ pairs to allow both IPv4 and IPv6 (and\n   future formats as well), the MSDP\
    \ protocol itself is IPv4-only, and\n   the MSDP working group made an explicit\
    \ decision not to create an\n   IPv6 version of the protocol.\n   This MIB module\
    \ is somewhat disorganized, with scalars before and\n   after tables, holes in\
    \ the OID space, tables with the RowStatus in\n   the middle, and so on.  This\
    \ is because objects were added and\n   removed as necessary as the MSDP protocol\
    \ evolved, and the plan was\n   to renumber the whole MIB when moving to the standard\
    \ mib-2 tree.\n   The MSDP Working Group then changed direction, publishing the\
    \ MSDP\n   protocol as Experimental.  Since there were existing implementations\n\
    \   using the strange object order under the experimental OID, the WG\n   decided\
    \ not to renumber the MIB and to publish it as experimental,\n   keeping the experimental\
    \ OID.\n"

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   msdpEnabled\n      Obviously, by modifying msdpEnabled, an attacker could\
    \ simply\n      disable MSDP processing on the router.\n   msdpCacheLifetime\n\
    \      If allowed to modify msdpCacheLifetime, an attacker could set the\n   \
    \   value to a value lower than a peer's refresh interval, causing all\n     \
    \ state to time out and be refreshed.\n   msdpRequestsPeer, msdpRequestsStatus\n\
    \      If allowed to modify entries in the msdpRequestsTable, an attacker\n  \
    \    could cause this system to send MSDP Requests to an unknown\n      system,\
    \ or could simply remove the proper configuration.  Note\n      that the msdpRequestsTable\
    \ is deprecated, and the MSDP Request\n      functionality is not in the published\
    \ MSDP spec.\n   msdpPeerTable objects\n      The writable objects in the msdpPeerTable\
    \ are:\n      msdpPeerLocalAddress, msdpPeerConnectRetryInterval,\n      msdpPeerHoldTimeConfigured,\
    \ msdpPeerKeepAliveConfigured,\n      msdpPeerDataTtl, msdpPeerProcessRequestsFrom,\
    \ msdpPeerStatus, and\n      msdpPeerEncapsulationType.  Of these, modifying msdpPeerIpAddress\n\
    \      and msdpPeerStatus could cause a changed or deleted peer\n      configuration.\
    \  Modifying any of the other values could cause\n      subtle protocol misbehavior.\n\
    \   msdpSACacheStatus\n      This writable object can be used to remove valid\
    \ values from the\n      router's SA cache.\n   msdpRPAddress\n      Changing\
    \ this object can cause a failure of the Peer-RPF rules for\n      SA messages\
    \ sourced by this router.\n   msdpMeshGroupStatus\n      This object can be used\
    \ to change this router's idea of its mesh\n      group membership and those of\
    \ its peers.  Misconfiguration of mesh\n      groups can cause subtle protocol\
    \ misbehavior.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects\
    \ with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive\
    \ or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n \
    \  control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to\
    \ even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network\
    \ via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   o  The entire msdpPeerTable.  Peer information can result in\n      discovering\
    \ internal topology, which many want to keep secret.\n   o  msdpNumSACacheEntries.\
    \  The size of the SA Cache could reveal\n      whether this system has MSDP entries\
    \ for public and/or private\n      groups.\n   o  The entire msdpSACacheTable.\
    \  The active sources and groups in a\n      network could be private.\n   o \
    \ The entire msdpMeshGroupTable.  This information can also lead to\n      internal\
    \ topology information.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate\
    \ security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n\
    \   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed\
    \ to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB\
    \ module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features\
    \ as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [6], Section 8), including full\n\
    \   support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication\n   and\
    \ privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
