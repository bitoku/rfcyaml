  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RTP Payload Format for Uncompressed Video [1] defines
    a scheme to\n   packetise uncompressed, studio-quality, video streams for transport\n
    \  using RTP [2].  A range of standard and high-definition video formats\n   is
    supported, and parameters are defined so sender and receiver can\n   negotiate
    the image size, colour space, pixel depth, and colour\n   sampling mode.\n   A
    limitation of the signalling is that the number of bits per sample\n   is assumed
    to be the same for each colour component.  For example, it\n   is possible to
    signal video using RGB colour sampling with 8 bits for\n   each of the Red, Green,
    and Blue components (24 bits per pixel), but\n   not video using RGB colour sampling
    with 5 bits each for the Red and\n   Blue components, but 6 bits for the Green
    component (16 bits per\n   pixel).  Such video formats can easily be transported
    by the payload\n   format, but cannot be signalled using the parameters defined.
    \ This\n   memo extends [1] with additional colour sampling modes, to signal\n
    \  such video formats.\n"

    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",

  - "3.  Payload Format Parameters\n   This memo defines six new colour sampling modes
    that MAY be signalled\n   for use with [1].  The new modes are \"RGB+\", \"RG+B\",
    \"R+GB\", \"BGR+\",\n   \"BG+R\", and \"B+GR\".  These sampling modes use the
    same packing order\n   of samples as do the RGB and BGR colour sampling modes,
    respectively\n   (Section 4.3 of [1]), except that an additional bit per sample
    of\n   colour depth MUST be used for the component marked by the + symbol.\n   The
    mandatory parameter \"depth=N\" indicates that N bits per sample\n   are used
    by the unmarked components, but N+1 bits are used by the\n   marked component.
    \ All other features of the payload format are as\n   defined in [1].\n   The
    primary use of these colour sampling modes is to enable efficient\n   packing
    of data into small pixel groups (\"pgroups\").  The most common\n   use case is
    expected to be video with \"depth=5\", where the additional\n   bit of colour
    depth for the marked component enables a single pixel\n   to fit into two octets
    without padding.  The new colour sampling\n   modes MAY be used for other depths,
    however, should that prove\n   useful.\n"

  - "4.  Example\n   A common uncompressed video format is RGB with 5 bits for the
    Red and\n   Blue components and 6 bits for the Green component, for a total of
    16\n   bits per pixel.  Using the sampling modes defined in this memo, this\n
    \  can be signalled in Session Description Protocol (SDP) according to\n   the
    following example:\n       v=0\n       o=jdoe 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 192.0.2.5\n
    \      s=-\n       c=IN IP4 192.0.2.6\n       t=2873397496 2873404696\n       m=video
    51372 RTP/AVP 99\n       a=rtpmap:99 raw/90000\n       a=fmtp:99 sampling=RG+B;
    width=1024; height=768; depth=5;\n         colorimetry=SMPTE240M\n   The last
    line has been wrapped due to formatting constraints of this\n   memo, and forms
    one complete line in the SDP file.\n"

    additional security\n   considerations are introduced by support for new colour
    sampling\n   modes.\n"

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   The video/raw media type is extended with six new
    values for the\n   \"sampling\" parameter according to the rules defined in Section
    6.2 of\n   [1].  The new values are \"RGB+\", \"RG+B\", \"R+GB\", \"BGR+\", \"BG+R\",
    and\n   \"B+GR\" as described in this memo.\n"
