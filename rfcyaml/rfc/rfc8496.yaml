  - "1.  Overview\n   In certain network configurations, several network entities\
    \ have\n   found it useful to decouple the identity of the caller (what is\n \
    \  normally thought of as \"Caller ID\") from the identity/number used for\n \
    \  billing purposes.  This document records the current usage of\n   P-Charge-Info,\
    \ a private SIP header field, to provide simple billing\n   information and details\
    \ the registration of this header field with\n   IANA as required by Section 4\
    \ of [RFC5727].\n   In a typical configuration, the identity of the caller, commonly\n\
    \   referred to as \"Caller ID\" by end users, is derived from one of the\n  \
    \ following SIP header fields:\n   o  P-Asserted-Identity\n   o  From (in the\
    \ absence of P-Asserted-Identity)\n   (NOTE: Some service providers have also\
    \ used the Remote-Party-ID\n   header field, but this was never standardized and\
    \ was replaced by\n   P-Asserted-Identity in [RFC3325].)\n   This identity/number\
    \ is typically presented to the receiving user\n   agent (UA), where it is usually\
    \ displayed for the end user.  It is\n   also typically used for billing purposes\
    \ by the network entities\n   involved in carrying the session.\n   However, in\
    \ some network configurations, the \"Caller ID\" presented to\n   the receiving\
    \ UA may be different from the number to be used for\n   billing purposes.\n \
    \  In this case, there exists a need for a way to pass an additional\n   billing\
    \ identifier that can be used between network entities in order\n   to correctly\
    \ bill for services.\n   Several carriers, application providers, and equipment\
    \ providers have\n   been using the P-Charge-Info header field since at least\
    \ 2007 as a\n   simple mechanism to exchange this billing identifier.\n   This\
    \ document specifies the use of the P-Charge-Info header field in\n   INVITE requests.\
    \  The header field might be useful in other SIP\n   messages, but such use is\
    \ beyond the scope of this document.\n"

- title: 3.  Purpose of This Document
  contents:
  - "3.  Purpose of This Document\n   This document has been prepared to document\
    \ the existing deployed\n   usage of the P-Charge-Info header field and to comply\
    \ with Section 4\n   of [RFC5727] in registering this header field with IANA.\
    \  It is noted\n   that RFC 5727 specifically deprecates new usage of \"P-\" header\n\
    \   fields, but P-Charge-Info has been in deployment since before 2007\n   and\
    \ predates RFC 5727.  Given this, the authors believe that\n   P-Charge-Info is\
    \ a \"grandfathered case\" per Section 4 of RFC 5727.\n"
- title: 4.  Use Cases
  contents:
  - "4.  Use Cases\n   The simplest use case for P-Charge-Info is an enterprise environment\n\
    \   where each SIP endpoint has a direct number that is passed by the\n   enterprise\
    \ SIP proxy across to a SIP proxy at a SIP service provider\n   who provides connectivity\
    \ to the Public Switched Telephone Network\n   (PSTN).  Rather than cause the\
    \ SIP service provider to have to track\n   each individual direct number for\
    \ billing purposes, the enterprise\n   SIP proxy sends, in the P-Charge-Info header\
    \ field, a single billing\n   identifier that the SIP service provider uses for\
    \ billing purposes.\n   As another example, a hosted telephony provider or hosted\
    \ voice-\n   application provider may have a large SIP network with customers\
    \ who\n   are distributed over a very large geographic area and use local-\n \
    \  market PSTN numbers, although the network has only a very few actual\n   PSTN\
    \ interconnection points.\n   The customers may all have local phone numbers,\
    \ yet outgoing calls\n   are actually routed across a SIP network and out specific\
    \ PSTN\n   gateways or across specific SIP connections to other SIP service\n\
    \   providers.  The hosted provider may want to pass a billing identifier\n  \
    \ to its SIP service providers either for the purpose of simplicity in\n   billing\
    \ or to obtain better rates from the SIP service providers.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Applicability Statement for the P-Charge-Info Header Field\n   The P-Charge-Info\
    \ header field is applicable within a single private\n   administrative domain\
    \ or between different administrative domains\n   where there is a trust relationship\
    \ between the domains.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Usage of the P-Charge-Info Header Field
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Usage of the P-Charge-Info Header Field\n   The P-Charge-Info header field\
    \ is used to convey information about\n   the identity of the party to be charged.\
    \  The P-Charge-Info header\n   field is typically inserted into a SIP request,\
    \ usually an INVITE, by\n   one of the following:\n   o  the SIP proxy on the\
    \ originating network;\n   o  a PSTN gateway acting as a SIP UA; or\n   o  an\
    \ application server generating billing information.\n   P-Charge-Info is to be\
    \ used by the SIP entity that provides billing\n   services for a session.  This\
    \ could be an entity that is generating\n   billing records or another entity\
    \ interacting with it.  Upon receipt\n   of an INVITE request with the P-Charge-Info\
    \ header field, such an\n   entity MAY use the value present in P-Charge-Info\
    \ as indicating the\n   party responsible for the charges associated with the\
    \ session.  This\n   decision, for example, could be based on local policy.\n"
- title: 5.2.1.  Procedures at the UA
  contents:
  - "5.2.1.  Procedures at the UA\n   The P-Charge-Info header field may be inserted\
    \ by PSTN gateways or\n   application servers acting as a SIP UA.\n   The P-Charge-Info\
    \ header field is ignored by an end-user UA and\n   should not normally be received\
    \ by such a UA.  It MUST NOT be sent to\n   an end-user UA, as this would provide\
    \ information to the UA about the\n   party to be charged; providing such information\
    \ may cause security-\n   related issues; for example, calling-party information\
    \ would be known\n   by the UA for an otherwise anonymous call.  A UA SHOULD ignore\
    \ it if\n   it receives this header.  Similarly, an end-user UA originating a\
    \ SIP\n   message SHOULD NOT insert this header field.\n   A PSTN gateway or application\
    \ server acting as a UA MAY use the\n   content of the P-Charge-Info header field\
    \ present in an INVITE\n   request it received as the identity to be charged for\
    \ the session for\n   billing-related procedures, e.g., in a billing record or\
    \ during\n   interaction with another entity generating billing records.  A PSTN\n\
    \   gateway or application server acting as a UA MAY use the content of\n   the\
    \ P-Charge-Info header field to populate information about the\n   identity of\
    \ the party to charge in another type of signaling, such as\n   ISDN User Part\
    \ (ISUP).\n"
- title: 5.2.2.  Procedures at the Proxy
  contents:
  - "5.2.2.  Procedures at the Proxy\n   A SIP proxy that supports this extension\
    \ and receives a request,\n   typically a SIP INVITE, MAY insert a P-Charge-Info\
    \ header field.  The\n   contents of the inserted header field may be decided\
    \ based on local\n   policy or by querying an external entity to determine the\
    \ identity of\n   the party to be charged.\n   When a proxy receives an INVITE\
    \ request, it MAY use the content of\n   the P-Charge-Info header field contained\
    \ in the request for billing-\n   related procedures, e.g., in a billing record\
    \ or during interaction\n   with another entity that is generating billing records.\n\
    \   A SIP proxy that does not support this extension will pass any\n   received\
    \ P-Charge-Info header field unmodified, in compliance with\n   RFC 3261.\n  \
    \ A proxy supporting this extension MUST remove the P-Charge-Info\n   header field\
    \ before sending a request to a UA that is not acting as a\n   PSTN gateway or\
    \ appropriate application server, if the role of the UA\n   is known.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Use-Case Example
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Use-Case Example\n   The content of the P-Charge-Info header field is typically\
    \ just a\n   SIP/tel URI used as a billing indicator.  An example could be as\n\
    \   simple as one of:\n   P-Charge-Info: <sip:+14075550134@example.net;user=phone>\n\
    \   P-Charge-Info: <sip:+12345550167@example.com>\n   P-Charge-Info: <sips:1234@example.com>\n\
    \   P-Charge-Info: <tel:+14075551234>\n   Any other applicable SIP URI could be\
    \ used.\n"
- title: 6.  Formal Syntax
  contents:
  - "6.  Formal Syntax\n   This RFC contains the definition of one or more SIP header\
    \ fields\n   that allow choosing between addr-spec and name-addr when constructing\n\
    \   header-field values.  [RFC8217] prohibits the use of addr-spec if its\n  \
    \ value would contain a comma, semicolon, or question mark.\n   The private header\
    \ field specified here is described in both prose\n   and an augmented Backus-Naur\
    \ Form (BNF) defined in [RFC5234].\n   Further, several BNF definitions are inherited\
    \ from SIP and are not\n   repeated here.  Implementors need to be familiar with\
    \ the notation\n   and contents of [RFC3261] and [RFC5234] to understand this\
    \ document.\n   The syntax of the P-Charge-Info header field is described as follows:\n\
    \         P-Charge-Info = \"P-Charge-Info\" HCOLON (name-addr / addr-spec)\n \
    \                ; name-addr and addr-spec are specified in RFC 3261\n   The SIP\
    \ URI contained in the name-addr/addr-spec is the billing\n   indicator that is\
    \ passed between the parties.\n"

    \ for fraud if the untrusted\n   entity sent incorrect information, either inadvertently\

- title: 8.2.2.  Egress to Untrusted Peers
  contents:
  - "8.2.2.  Egress to Untrusted Peers\n   If the P-Charge-Info header field was sent\
    \ by a SIP entity to an\n   untrusted peer, there is potential for exposure of\
    \ network\n   information that is internal to a trust domain.  For instance, the\n\
    \   untrusted entity may learn the identities of public SIP proxies used\n   within\
    \ the trust domain, which could then potentially be directly\n   attacked.\n \
    \  If an implementation does not strip P-Charge-Info from the message\n   where\
    \ specified in this document, it introduces serious privacy\n   risks.  Examples\
    \ include revealing third-party billing relationships\n   that might be sensitive,\
    \ as well as unmasking the identity of callers\n   who wish to remain anonymous.\
    \  Depending on circumstances, the latter\n   case may result in unwanted harassment\

  - "A.1.  P-Charging-Vector\n   P-Charging-Vector is defined in Section 4.6 of [RFC7315]\
    \ and used by\n   the 3GPP to carry information related to the charging of a session.\n\
    \   There are, however, some differences in the semantics associated with\n  \
    \ P-Charging-Vector and P-Charge-Info.  P-Charging-Vector is mainly\n   used to\
    \ carry information for correlation of multiple charging\n   records generated\
    \ for a single session.  On the other hand,\n   P-Charge-Info is used to convey\
    \ information about the party to be\n   billed for a call.  Furthermore, P-Charging-Vector\
    \ has a mandatory\n   icid-value parameter that is a globally unique value to\
    \ identify the\n   session for which the charging information is generated.  Such\
    \ a\n   globally unique identifier is not necessary when carrying information\n\
    \   about the user to be billed when it is attached to the corresponding\n   session-related\
    \ signaling.\n"
- title: A.2.  P-DCS-Billing-Info
  contents:
  - "A.2.  P-DCS-Billing-Info\n   P-DCS-Billing-Info is defined in Section 7 of [RFC5503]\
    \ and used for\n   passing billing information between trusted entities in the\n\
    \   PacketCable Distributed Call Signaling Architecture.  For many\n   billing\
    \ situations, particularly the very large-scale residential\n   telephone networks\
    \ for which this header field is designed,\n   P-DCS-Billing-Info is an excellent\
    \ solution.  However, this ability\n   to address a range of situations adds complexity.\
    \  According to RFC\n   5503, the following information is mandatory to include\
    \ in each use\n   of the P-DCS-Billing-Info header field:\n   o  Billing-Correlation-ID,\
    \ a globally unique identifier\n   o  Financial-Entity-ID\n   o  RKS-Group-ID\
    \ (record-keeping server)\n   The P-DCS-Billing-Info header field may also include\
    \ a variety of\n   additional parameters.\n   While this may work well in many\
    \ billing scenarios, there are other\n   billing scenarios that do not need this\
    \ level of complexity.  In\n   those simpler scenarios, all that is needed is\
    \ a number to use for\n   billing.  P-Charge-Info provides this simple solution\
    \ for simple\n   billing scenarios.\n   Additionally, according to Section 7.3\
    \ of RFC 5503, it is mandatory\n   for a UA to create a Billing-Correlation-ID\
    \ and insert this into the\n   P-DCS-Billing-Info header field (along with the\
    \ other required\n   information) sent in the initial SIP INVITE.  This again\
    \ makes sense\n   for the residential-telephone-service environment for which\
    \ this\n   header field is designed.  In contrast, P-Charge-Info is designed to\n\
    \   be used among proxies and not at all by normal user agents.\n   (P-Charge-Info\
    \ may, though, be used by user agents associated with\n   PSTN gateways.)\n"
- title: A.3.  P-Asserted-Identity
  contents:
  - "A.3.  P-Asserted-Identity\n   Early reviewers of this document asked why the\
    \ P-Asserted-Identity\n   header field documented in [RFC3325] could not be used.\
    \  As mentioned\n   in the use-case example above, P-Asserted-Identity is used\
    \ to\n   indicate the identity of the calling party.  However, in this\n   instance,\
    \ the requirement is to provide an additional identity of the\n   SIP-to-PSTN\
    \ interconnect point.\n   It would be typical to find both P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ and\n   P-Charge-Info used in a SIP exchange.  P-Asserted-Identity would be\n\
    \   used to provide the caller identity that would be displayed to the\n   end\
    \ user as \"Caller ID\", while P-Charge-Info would provide the\n   billing identifier\
    \ used for the billing associated with the call.\n"
