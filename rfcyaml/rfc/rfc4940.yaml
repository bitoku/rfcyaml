- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines various OSPF registries for IANA to set\
    \ up and\n   maintain for OSPF code points.  In some cases, this memo defines\n\
    \   ranges of code point values within these registries; each such range\n   has\
    \ a different assignment policy.\n   The terms used in describing the assignment\
    \ policies are as follows:\n      o  Standards Action\n      o  Experimentation\n\
    \      o  Vendor Private Use\n      o  Reserved\n   Standards Action means that\
    \ assignments in that range MUST only be\n   made for Standards Track RFCs (as\
    \ defined in [RFC2434]).\n   Some of the registries defined below reserve a range\
    \ of values for\n   Experimentation.  For guidelines regarding the use of such\
    \ values see\n   [RFC3692].  Values from this range MUST NOT be assigned by IANA.\n\
    \   Further guidance on the use of the Experimentation range may be found\n  \
    \ in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of [RFC3692].  An implementation MAY choose\n   to\
    \ not support values from the Experimentation range.  In such a\n   case, the\
    \ protocol data structure with a code point from the\n   Experimentation range\
    \ is ignored, unless other protocol machinery\n   says how to deal with it.  \"\
    Ignored\" in this context means that the\n   associated data structure is removed\
    \ from the received packet before\n   further processing, including flooding.\n\
    \   Values set aside as Vendor Private Use MUST NOT be assigned by IANA.\n   A\
    \ protocol data structure whose code point falls in this range MUST\n   have a\
    \ disambiguating field identifying the Vendor.  This identifier\n   consists of\
    \ four octets of the Vendor's SMI (Structure of Management\n   Information) enterprise\
    \ code (see [ENTERPRISE-NUMBERS]) in network\n   byte order; the location of this\
    \ code must be well-defined per data\n   structure.  An implementation that encounters\
    \ a Vendor Private code\n   point SHOULD check whether the enterprise code is\
    \ one that it\n   recognizes; if so, the implementation MAY choose to interpret\
    \ the\n   code point and data structure.  Otherwise, it SHOULD ignore the code\n\
    \   point, unless the protocol machinery says how to deal with the data\n   structure\
    \ (as defined in the previous paragraph).  This allows\n   multiple vendor private\
    \ extensions to coexist in a network.\n   Values in the Reserved range MUST NOT\
    \ be assigned until a Standards\n   Track or Best Common Practices RFC is published\
    \ defining the\n   assignment policy for that range.  This RFC MUST be the product\
    \ of\n   the OSPF Working Group; if the OSPF WG is terminated, then it MUST be\n\
    \   reviewed by an Expert Reviewer designated by the IESG.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  OSPF Registries\n   This section lists the various registries for OSPF protocol\
    \ code\n   points.  Note that some of these are for OSPF, and some are specific\n\
    \   to a particular version of OSPF; also, some registries predate this\n   memo.\n\
    \   Registries that are specific to one version of OSPF reflect the\n   version\
    \ number in the registry name (e.g., OSPFv2 Options).  A\n   registry whose name\
    \ does not mention a version number applies to both\n   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 (e.g.,\
    \ OSPF Packet Type).\n"
