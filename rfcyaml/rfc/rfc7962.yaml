- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   One of the aims of the Global Access to the Internet for\
    \ All (GAIA)\n   IRTF Research Group is \"to document and share deployment experiences\n\
    \   and research results to the wider community through scholarly\n   publications,\
    \ white papers, Informational and Experimental RFCs,\n   etc.\"  [GAIA].  In line\
    \ with this objective, this document proposes a\n   classification of \"Alternative\
    \ Network Deployments\".  This term\n   includes a set of network access models\
    \ that have emerged in the last\n   decade with the aim of providing Internet\
    \ connections, following\n   topological, architectural, governance, and business\
    \ models that\n   differ from the so-called \"mainstream\" ones, where a company\
    \ deploys\n   the infrastructure connecting the users, who pay a subscription\
    \ fee\n   to be connected and make use of it.\n   Several initiatives throughout\
    \ the world have built these large-scale\n   networks, using predominantly wireless\
    \ technologies (including long\n   distance links) due to the reduced cost of\
    \ using unlicensed spectrum.\n   Wired technologies such as fiber are also used\
    \ in some of these\n   networks.\n   The classification considers several types\
    \ of alternate deployments:\n   Community Networks are self-organized networks\
    \ wholly owned by the\n   community; networks acting as Wireless Internet Service\
    \ Providers\n   (WISPs); networks owned by individuals but leased out to network\n\
    \   operators who use such networks as a low-cost medium to reach the\n   underserved\
    \ population; networks that provide connectivity by sharing\n   wireless resources\
    \ of the users; and finally there are some rural\n   utility cooperatives also\
    \ connecting their members to the Internet.\n   The emergence of these networks\
    \ has been motivated by a variety of\n   factors such as the lack of wired and\
    \ cellular infrastructures in\n   rural/remote areas [Pietrosemoli].  In some\
    \ cases, Alternative\n   Networks may provide more localized communication services\
    \ as well as\n   Internet backhaul support through peering agreements with mainstream\n\
    \   network operators.  In other cases, they are built as a complement or\n  \
    \ an alternative to commercial Internet access provided by mainstream\n   network\
    \ operators.\n   The present document is intended to provide a broad overview\
    \ of\n   initiatives, technologies, and approaches employed in these networks,\n\
    \   including some real examples.  References describing each kind of\n   network\
    \ are also provided.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Mainstream Networks
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Mainstream Networks\n   In this document, we will use the term \"mainstream\
    \ networks\" to\n   denote those networks sharing these characteristics:\n   o\
    \  Regarding scale, they are usually large networks spanning entire\n      regions.\n\
    \   o  Top-down control of the network and centralized approach.\n   o  They require\
    \ a substantial investment in infrastructure.\n   o  Users in mainstream networks\
    \ do not participate in the network\n      design, deployment, operation, governance,\
    \ and maintenance.\n   o  Ownership of the network is never vested in the users\
    \ themselves.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Alternative Networks
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Alternative Networks\n   The term \"Alternative Network\" proposed in this\
    \ document refers to\n   the networks that do not share the characteristics of\
    \ \"mainstream\n   network deployments\".  Therefore, they may share some of the\n\
    \   following characteristics:\n   o  Relatively small scale (i.e., not spanning\
    \ entire regions).\n   o  Administration may not follow a centralized approach.\n\
    \   o  They may require a reduced investment in infrastructure, which may\n  \
    \    be shared by the users and commercial and non-commercial entities.\n   o\
    \  Users in Alternative Networks may participate in the network\n      design,\
    \ deployment, operation, and maintenance.\n   o  Ownership of the network is often\
    \ vested in the users.\n"
- title: 2.  Terms Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Terms Used in This Document\n   Considering the role that the Internet currently\
    \ plays in everyday\n   life, this document touches on complex social, political,\
    \ and\n   economic issues.  Some of the concepts and terminology used have been\n\
    \   the subject of study of various disciplines outside the field of\n   networking\
    \ and are responsible for long debates whose resolution is\n   out of the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   o  \"Global north\" and \"global south\".  Although there\
    \ is no consensus\n      on the terms to be used when talking about the different\n\
    \      development level of countries, we will employ the term \"global\n    \
    \  south\" to refer to nations with a relatively lower standard of\n      living.\
    \  This distinction is normally intended to reflect basic\n      economic country\
    \ conditions.  In common practice, Japan in Asia,\n      Canada and the United\
    \ States in northern America, Australia and\n      New Zealand in Oceania, and\
    \ Europe are considered \"developed\"\n      regions or areas [UN], so we will\
    \ employ the term \"global north\"\n      when talking about them.\n   o  The\
    \ \"Digital Divide\".  The following dimensions are considered to\n      be meaningful\
    \ when measuring the digital development state of a\n      country: infrastructures\
    \ (availability and affordability), the\n      Information and Communications\
    \ Technology (ICT) sector (human\n      capital and technological industry), digital\
    \ literacy, legal and\n      regulatory framework, and content and services. \
    \ A lack of digital\n      development in one or more of these dimensions is what\
    \ has been\n      referred as the \"Digital Divide\" [Norris].  It should be noted\n\
    \      that this \"Divide\" is not only present between different countries\n\
    \      but between zones of the same country, despite its degree of\n      development.\n\
    \   o  \"Urban\" and \"rural\" zones.  There is no single definition of\n    \
    \  \"rural\" or \"urban\", as each country and various international\n      organizations\
    \ define these terms differently, mainly based on the\n      number of inhabitants,\
    \ the population density, and the distance\n      between houses [UNStats].  For\
    \ networking purposes, the primary\n      distinction is likely the average distance\
    \ between customers,\n      typically measured by population density, as well\
    \ as the distance\n      to the nearest Internet point-of-presence, i.e., the\
    \ distance to\n      be covered by \"middle mile\" or backhaul connectivity. \
    \ Some\n      regions with low average population density may cluster almost all\n\
    \      inhabitants into a small number of relatively dense small towns,\n    \
    \  for example, while residents may be dispersed more evenly in\n      others.\n\
    \   o  Demand.  In economics, it describes a consumer's desire and\n      willingness\
    \ to pay a price for a specific good or service.\n   o  Provision is the act of\
    \ making an asset available for sale.  In\n      this document, we will mainly\
    \ use it as the act of making a\n      network service available to the inhabitants\
    \ of a zone.\n   o  Underserved area.  Area in which the telecommunication market\n\
    \      permanently fails to provide the information and communications\n     \
    \ services demanded by the population.\n   o  Free, open, and neutral networks.\
    \  Their principles have been\n      summarized this way [Baig]:\n      *  You\
    \ have the freedom to use the network for any purpose as long\n         as you\
    \ do not harm the operation of the network itself, the\n         rights of other\
    \ users, or the principles of neutrality that\n         allow contents and services\
    \ to flow without deliberate\n         interference.\n      *  You have the right\
    \ to understand the network, to know its\n         components, and to spread knowledge\
    \ of its mechanisms and\n         principles.\n      *  You have the right to\
    \ offer services and content to the network\n         on your own terms.\n   \
    \   *  You have the right to join the network, and the responsibility\n      \
    \   to extend this set of rights to anyone according to these same\n         terms.\n"
- title: 3.  Scenarios Where Alternative Networks Are Deployed
  contents:
  - "3.  Scenarios Where Alternative Networks Are Deployed\n   Different studies have\
    \ reported that as much as 60% of the people on\n   the planet do not have Internet\
    \ connectivity [Sprague]\n   [InternetStats].  In addition, those unconnected\
    \ are unevenly\n   distributed: only 31% of the population in \"global south\"\
    \ countries\n   had access in 2014, against 80% in \"global north\" countries\n\
    \   [WorldBank2016].  This is one of the reasons behind the inclusion of\n   the\
    \ objective to \"significantly increase access to information and\n   communications\
    \ technology and strive to provide universal and\n   affordable access to the\
    \ Internet in least developed countries by\n   2020,\" as one of the targets in\
    \ the Sustainable Development Goals\n   (SDGs) [SDG], considered as a part of\
    \ \"Goal 9.  Build resilient\n   infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable\
    \ industrialization\n   and foster innovation.\"\n   For the purpose of this document,\
    \ a distinction between \"global\n   north\" and \"global south\" zones is made,\
    \ highlighting the factors\n   related to ICT, which can be quantified in terms\
    \ of:\n   o  The availability of both national and international bandwidth, as\n\
    \      well as equipment.\n   o  The difficulty in paying for the services and\
    \ the devices required\n      to access the ICTs.\n   o  The instability and/or\
    \ lack of power supply.\n   o  The scarcity of qualified staff.\n   o  The existence\
    \ of a policy and regulatory framework that hinders\n      the development of\
    \ these models in favor of state monopolies or\n      incumbents.\n   In this\
    \ context, the World Summit of the Information Society [WSIS]\n   aimed at achieving\
    \ \"a people-centred, inclusive and development-\n   oriented Information Society,\
    \ where everyone can create, access,\n   utilize and share information and knowledge.\
    \  Therefore, enabling\n   individuals, communities and people to achieve their\
    \ full potential\n   in promoting their sustainable development and improving\
    \ their\n   quality of life\".  It also called upon \"governments, private sector,\n\
    \   civil society and international organizations\" to actively engage to\n  \
    \ work towards the bridging of the digital divide.\n   Some Alternative Networks\
    \ have been deployed in underserved areas,\n   where citizens may be compelled\
    \ to take a more active part in the\n   design and implementation of ICT solutions.\
    \  However, Alternative\n   Networks (e.g., [Baig]) are also present in some \"\
    global north\"\n   countries, being built as an alternative to commercial ones\
    \ managed\n   by mainstream network operators.\n   The consolidation of a number\
    \ of mature Alternative Networks (e.g.,\n   Community Networks) sets a precedent\
    \ for civil society members to\n   become more active in the search for alternatives\
    \ to provide\n   themselves with affordable access.  Furthermore, Alternative\
    \ Networks\n   could contribute to bridge the digital divide by increasing human\n\
    \   capital and promoting the creation of localized content and services.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Urban vs. Rural Areas
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Urban vs. Rural Areas\n   The differences presented in the previous section\
    \ are not only\n   present between countries, but within them too.  This is especially\n\
    \   the case for rural inhabitants, who represent approximately 55% of\n   the\
    \ world's population [IFAD2011], with 78% of them in \"global south\"\n   countries\
    \ [ITU2011].  According to the World Bank, adoption gaps\n   \"between rural and\
    \ urban populations are falling for mobile phones\n   but increasing for the internet\"\
    \ [WorldBank2016].\n   Although it is impossible to generalize among them, there\
    \ exist some\n   common features in rural areas that have prevented incumbent\n\
    \   operators from providing access and that, at the same time, challenge\n  \
    \ the deployment of alternative infrastructures [Brewer] [Nungu]\n   [Simo_c].\
    \  For example, a high network latency was reported in\n   [Johnson_b], which\
    \ could be in the order of seconds during some\n   hours.\n   These challenges\
    \ include:\n   o  Low per capita income, as the local economy is mainly based\
    \ on\n      subsistence agriculture, farming, and fishing.\n   o  Scarcity or\
    \ absence of basic infrastructures, such as electricity,\n      water, and access\
    \ roads.\n   o  Low population density and distance (spatial or effective) between\n\
    \      population clusters.\n   o  Underdeveloped social services, such as healthcare\
    \ and education.\n   o  Lack of adequately educated and trained technicians, and\
    \ high\n      potential for those (few) trained to leave the community\n     \
    \ incentivized by better opportunities, higher salaries, or the\n      possibility\
    \ of starting their own companies [McMahon].\n   o  High cost of Internet access\
    \ [Mathee].\n   o  Harsh environments leading to failure in electronic communication\n\
    \      devices [Johnson_a], which reduces the reliability of the network.\n  \
    \ Some of these factors challenge the stability of Alternative Networks\n   and\
    \ the services they provide: scarcity of spectrum, scale, and\n   heterogeneity\
    \ of devices.  However, the proliferation of Alternative\n   Networks [Baig] together\
    \ with the raising of low-cost, low-\n   consumption, low-complexity off-the-shelf\
    \ wireless devices have\n   allowed and simplified the deployment and maintenance\
    \ of alternative\n   infrastructures in rural areas.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Topology Patterns Followed by Alternative Networks
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Topology Patterns Followed by Alternative Networks\n   Alternative Networks,\
    \ considered self-managed and self-sustained,\n   follow different topology patterns\
    \ [Vega_a].  Generally, these\n   networks grow spontaneously and organically,\
    \ that is, the network\n   grows without specific planning and deployment strategy\
    \ and the\n   routing core of the network tends to fit a power law distribution.\n\
    \   Moreover, these networks are composed of a high number of\n   heterogeneous\
    \ devices with the common objective of freely connecting\n   and increasing the\
    \ network coverage and the reliability.  Although\n   these characteristics increase\
    \ the entropy (e.g., by increasing the\n   number of routing protocols), they\
    \ have resulted in an inexpensive\n   solution to effectively increase the network\
    \ size.  One such example\n   is Guifi.net [Vega_a], which has had an exponential\
    \ growth rate in\n   the number of operating nodes during the last decade.\n \
    \  Regularly, rural areas in these networks are connected through long-\n   distance\
    \ links and/or wireless mesh networks, which in turn convey\n   the Internet connection\
    \ to relevant organizations or institutions.\n   In contrast, in urban areas,\
    \ users tend to share and require mobile\n   access.  Since these areas are also\
    \ likely to be covered by\n   commercial ISPs, the provision of wireless access\
    \ by virtual\n   operators like [Fon] may constitute a way to extend the user\
    \ capacity\n   to the network.  Other proposals like \"Virtual Public Networks\"\
    \n   [Sathiaseelan_a] can also extend the service.\n"

  - "4.2.  Purpose\n   Alternative Networks can be classified according to their purpose\
    \ and\n   the benefits they bring compared to mainstream solutions, regarding\n\
    \   economic, technological, social, or political objectives.  These\n   benefits\
    \ could be enjoyed mostly by the actors involved (e.g.,\n   lowering costs or\
    \ gaining technical expertise) or by the local\n   community (e.g., Internet access\
    \ in underserved areas) or by the\n   society as a whole (e.g., network neutrality).\n\
    \   The benefits provided by Alternative Networks include, but are not\n   limited\
    \ to:\n   o  Extending coverage to underserved areas (users and communities).\n\
    \   o  Providing affordable Internet access for all.\n   o  Reducing initial capital\
    \ expenditures (for the network and the end\n      user, or both).\n   o  Providing\
    \ additional sources of capital (beyond the traditional\n      carrier-based financing).\n\
    \   o  Reducing ongoing operational costs (such as backhaul or network\n     \
    \ administration).\n   o  Leveraging expertise and having a place for experimentation\
    \ and\n      teaching.\n   o  Reducing hurdles to adoption (e.g., digital literacy,\
    \ literacy in\n      general, and relevance).\n   o  Providing an alternative\
    \ service in case of natural disasters and\n      other extreme situations.\n\
    \   o  Community building, social cohesion, and quality of life\n      improvement.\n\
    \   o  Experimentation with alternative governance and ownership models\n    \
    \  for treating network infrastructures as a commons.\n   o  Raising awareness\
    \ of political debates around issues like network\n      neutrality, knowledge\
    \ sharing, access to resources, and more.\n   Note that the different purposes\
    \ of Alternative Networks can be more\n   or less explicitly stated and they could\
    \ also evolve over time based\n   on the internal dynamics and external events.\
    \  For example, the Red\n   Hook WIFI network in Brooklyn [Redhook] started as\
    \ a Community\n   Network focusing more on local applications and community building\n\
    \   [TidePools], but it became widely known when it played a key role as\n   an\
    \ alternative service available during the Sandy storm [Tech]\n   [NYTimes].\n\
    \   Moreover, especially for those networks with more open and horizontal\n  \
    \ governance models, the underlying motivations of those involved may\n   be very\
    \ diverse, ranging from altruistic ones related to the desire\n   of free sharing\
    \ of Internet connectivity and various forms of\n   activism to personal benefits\
    \ from the experience and expertise\n   through the active participation in the\
    \ deployment and management of\n   a real and operational network.\n"

  - "4.3.  Governance and Sustainability Model\n   Different governance models are\
    \ present in Alternative Networks.\n   They may range from some open and horizontal\
    \ models, with an active\n   participation of the users (e.g., Community Networks)\
    \ to a more\n   centralized model, where a single authority (e.g., a company or\
    \ a\n   public stakeholder) plans and manages the network, even if it is\n   (total\
    \ or partially) owned by a community.\n   Regarding sustainability, some networks\
    \ grow \"organically\" as a\n   result of the new users who join and extend the\
    \ network, contributing\n   their own hardware.  In some other cases, the existence\
    \ of previous\n   infrastructure (owned by the community or the users) may lower\
    \ the\n   capital expenditures of an operator, who can therefore provide the\n\

    \          Table 1: Characteristics Summary for Community Networks\n   Community\
    \ Networks are non-centralized, self-managed networks sharing\n   these characteristics:\n\
    \   o  They start and grow organically, and they are open to\n      participation\
    \ from everyone, sharing an open participation\n      agreement.  Community members\
    \ directly contribute active (not just\n      passive) network infrastructure.\
    \  The network grows as new hosts\n      and links are added.\n   o  Knowledge\
    \ about building and maintaining the network and ownership\n      of the network\
    \ itself is non-centralized and open.  Different\n      degrees of centralization\
    \ can be found in Community Networks.  In\n      some of them, a shared platform\
    \ (e.g., a website) may exist where\n      minimum coordination is performed.\
    \  Community members with the\n      right permissions have an obvious and direct\
    \ form of\n      organizational control over the overall organization of the\n\
    \      network (e.g., IP addresses, routing, etc.) in their community\n      (not\
    \ just their own participation in the network).\n   o  The network can serve as\
    \ a backhaul for providing a whole range of\n      services and applications,\
    \ from completely free to even commercial\n      services.\n   Hardware and software\
    \ used in Community Networks can be very diverse\n   and customized, even inside\
    \ one network.  A Community Network can\n   have both wired and wireless links.\
    \  Multiple routing protocols or\n   network topology management systems may coexist\
    \ in the network.\n   These networks grow organically, since they are formed by\
    \ the\n   aggregation of nodes belonging to different users.  A minimal\n   governance\
    \ infrastructure is required in order to coordinate IP\n   addressing, routing,\
    \ etc.  Several examples of Community Networks are\n   described in [Braem]. \
    \ A technological analysis of a Community\n   Network is presented in [Vega_b],\
    \ which focuses on technological\n   network diversity, topology characteristics,\
    \ the evolution of the\n   network over time, robustness and reliability, and\
    \ networking service\n   availability.\n   These networks follow a participatory\
    \ administration model, which has\n   been shown to be effective in connecting\
    \ geographically dispersed\n   people, thus enhancing and extending digital Internet\
    \ rights.\n   Users adding new infrastructure (i.e., extensibility) can be used\
    \ to\n   formulate another definition: A Community Network is a network in\n \
    \  which any participant in the system may add link segments to the\n   network\
    \ in such a way that the new segments can support multiple\n   nodes and adopt\
    \ the same overall characteristics as those of the\n   joined network, including\
    \ the capacity to further extend the network.\n   Once these link segments are\
    \ joined to the network, there is no\n   longer a meaningful distinction between\
    \ the previous and the new\n   extent of the network.  The term \"participant\"\
    \ refers to an\n   individual, who may become the user, provider, and manager\
    \ of the\n   network at the same time.\n   In Community Networks, profit can only\
    \ be made by offering services\n   and not simply by supplying the infrastructure,\
    \ because the\n   infrastructure is neutral, free, and open (mainstream Internet\n\
    \   Service Providers base their business on the control of the\n   infrastructure).\
    \  In Community Networks, everybody usually keeps the\n   ownership of what he/she\
    \ has contributed or leaves the stewardship of\n   the equipment to the network\
    \ as a whole (the commons), even loosing\n   track of the ownership of a particular\
    \ equipment itself, in favor of\n   the community.\n   The majority of Community\
    \ Networks comply with the definition of Free\n   Network, included in Section\
    \ 2.\n"

    \    Table 3: Characteristics Summary for Shared Infrastructure\n   In mainstream\
    \ networks, the operator usually owns the\n   telecommunications infrastructure\
    \ required for the service or\n   sometimes rents infrastructure to/from other\
    \ companies.  The problem\n   arises in large areas with low population density,\
    \ in which neither\n   the operator nor the other companies have deployed infrastructure\
    \ and\n   such deployments are not likely to happen due to the low potential\n\
    \   return on investment.\n   When users already own deployed infrastructure,\
    \ either individually\n   or as a community, sharing that infrastructure with\
    \ an operator can\n   benefit both parties and is a solution that has been deployed\
    \ in some\n   areas.  For the operator, this provides a significant reduction\
    \ in\n   the initial investment needed to provide services in small rural\n  \
    \ localities because capital expenditure is only associated with the\n   access\
    \ network.  Renting capacity in the users' network for\n   backhauling only requires\
    \ an increment in the operating expenditure.\n   This approach also benefits the\
    \ users in two ways: they obtain\n   improved access to telecommunications services\
    \ that would not be\n   accessible otherwise, and they can derive some income\
    \ from the\n   operator that helps to offset the network's operating costs,\n\
    \   particularly for network maintenance.\n   One clear example of the potential\
    \ of the \"shared infrastructure\n   model\" nowadays is the deployment of 3G\
    \ services in rural areas in\n   which there is a broadband rural Community Network.\
    \  Since the\n   inception of femtocells (small, low-power cellular base stations),\n\
    \   there are complete technical solutions for low-cost 3G coverage using\n  \
    \ the Internet as a backhaul.  If a user or community of users has an\n   IP network\
    \ connected to the Internet with some excess capacity,\n   placing a femtocell\
    \ in the user premises benefits both the user and\n   the operator, as the user\
    \ obtains better coverage and the operator\n   does not have to support the cost\
    \ of the backhaul infrastructure.\n   Although this paradigm was conceived for\
    \ improved indoor coverage,\n   the solution is feasible for 3G coverage in underserved\
    \ rural areas\n   with low population density (i.e., villages), where the number\
    \ of\n   simultaneous users and the servicing area are small enough to use\n \
    \  low-cost femtocells.  Also, the amount of traffic produced by these\n   cells\
    \ can be easily transported by most community broadband rural\n   networks.\n\
    \   Some real examples can be referenced in the TUCAN3G project, which\n   deployed\
    \ demonstrator networks in two regions in the Amazon forest in\n   Peru [Simo_d].\
    \  In these networks [Simo_a], the operator and several\n   rural communities\
    \ cooperated to provide services through rural\n   networks built up with WiLD\
    \ links [WiLD].  In these cases, the\n   networks belonged to the public health\
    \ authorities and were deployed\n   with funds that came from international cooperation\
    \ for telemedicine\n   purposes.  Publications that justify the feasibility of\
    \ this approach\n   can also be found on that website.\n"

    \        Table 4: Characteristics Summary for Crowdshared Approaches\n   These\
    \ networks can be defined as a set of nodes whose owners share\n   common interests\
    \ (e.g., sharing connectivity; resources; and\n   peripherals) regardless of their\
    \ physical location.  They conform to\n   the following approach: the home router\
    \ creates two wireless networks\n   -- one of them is normally used by the owner,\
    \ and the other one is\n   public.  A small fraction of the bandwidth is allocated\
    \ to the public\n   network to be employed by any user of the service in the immediate\n\
    \   area.  Some examples are described in [PAWS] and [Sathiaseelan_c].\n   Other\
    \ examples are found in the networks created and managed by city\n   councils\
    \ (e.g., [Heer]).  The \"openwireless movement\"\n   (https://openwireless.org/)\
    \ also promotes the sharing of private\n   wireless networks.\n   Some companies\
    \ [Fon] also promote the use of Wi-Fi routers with dual\n   access: a Wi-Fi network\
    \ for the user and a shared one.  Adequate\n   Authentication, Authorization,\
    \ and Accounting (AAA) policies are\n   implemented, so people can join the network\
    \ in different ways: they\n   can buy a router, so they can share their connection\
    \ and in turn,\n   they get access to all the routers associated with the community.\n\
    \   Some users can even get some revenue every time another user connects\n  \
    \ to their Wi-Fi Access Point.  Users that are not part of the\n   community can\
    \ buy passes in order to use the network.  Some\n   mainstream telecommunications\

    \      network capacity.  As a counterpart, they can access another\n      owner's\
    \ home network capacity for free.  The owner can be an end\n      user or an entity\

    \   o  The user: A legal entity or an individual using or requesting a\n     \
    \ publicly available electronic communications service for private\n      or business\

    \ o  The VNO: An entity that acts in some aspects as a network\n      coordinator.\
    \  It may provide services such as initial\n      authentication or registration\
    \ and, eventually, trust relationship\n      storage.  A VNO is not an ISP given\
    \ that it does not provide\n      Internet access (e.g., infrastructure or naming).\
    \  A VNO is not an\n      Application Service Provider (ASP) either since it does\

    \ a/b/g/n/ac, as it\n   defines the protocol for Wireless LAN.  It is also known\
    \ as \"Wi-Fi\".\n   The original release (a/b) was issued in 1999 and allowed\
    \ for rates\n   up to 54 Mbit/s.  The latest release (802.11ac) approved in 2013\n\
    \   reaches up to 866.7 Mbit/s.  In 2012, the IEEE issued an 802.11\n   standard\
    \ that consolidated all the previous amendments [IEEE.802.11].\n   The document\
    \ is freely downloadable from the IEEE Standards\n   Association [IEEE].\n   The\
    \ MAC protocol in 802.11 is called CSMA/CA and was designed for\n   short distances;\
    \ the transmitter expects the reception of an\n   acknowledgment for each transmitted\
    \ unicast packet and if a certain\n   waiting time is exceeded, the packet is\
    \ retransmitted.  This behavior\n   makes necessary the adaptation of several\
    \ MAC parameters when 802.11\n   is used in long links [Simo_b].  Even with this\
    \ adaptation, distance\n   has a significant negative impact on performance. \
    \ For this reason,\n   many vendors implement alternative medium access techniques\
    \ that are\n   offered alongside the standard CSMA/CA in their outdoor 802.11\n\
    \   products.  These alternative proprietary MAC protocols usually employ\n  \
    \ some type of TDMA.  Low-cost equipment using these techniques can\n   offer\
    \ high throughput at distances above 100 kilometers.\n   Different specifications\
    \ of 802.11 operate in different frequency\n   bands. 802.11b/g/n operates in\
    \ 2.4 GHz, but 802.11a/n/ac operates in\n   5 GHz.  This fact is used in some\
    \ Community Networks in order to\n   separate ordinary and \"backbone\" nodes:\n\
    \   o  Typical routers running mesh firmware in homes, offices, and\n      public\
    \ spaces operate at 2.4 GHz.\n   o  Special routers running mesh firmware as well\
    \ but broadcasting and\n      receiving on the 5 GHz band are used in point-to-point\
    \ connections\n      only.  They are helpful to create a \"backbone\" on the network\
    \ that\n      can both connect neighborhoods to one another when reasonable\n\
    \      connections with 2.4 GHz nodes are not possible, and they ensure\n    \
    \  that users of 2.4 GHz nodes are within a few hops to strong and\n      stable\
    \ connections to the rest of the network.\n"

  - "7.3.1.  Use of VPNs\n   Some \"micro-ISPs\" may use the network as a backhaul\
    \ for providing\n   Internet access, setting up VPNs from the client to a machine\
    \ with\n   Internet access.\n   Many Community Networks also use VPNs to connect\
    \ multiple disjoint\n   parts of their networks together.  In some others, every\
    \ node\n   establishes a VPN tunnel as well.\n"
