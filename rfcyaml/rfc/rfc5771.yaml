- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (www.iana.org)\
    \ is\n   charged with allocating parameter values for fields in protocols that\n\
    \   have been designed, created, or are maintained by the Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Task Force (IETF).  RFC 2780 [RFC2780] provides the IANA\n   guidance in the\
    \ assignment of parameters for fields in newly\n   developed protocols.  This\
    \ memo expands on section 4.4.2 of RFC 2780\n   and attempts to codify existing\
    \ IANA practice used in the assignment\n   of IPv4 multicast addresses.\n   This\
    \ document is a revision of RFC 3171 [RFC3171], which it\n   obsoletes.  It also\
    \ obsoletes RFC 3138 [RFC3138] and updates\n   [RFC2780].\n   The terms \"Specification\
    \ Required\", \"Expert Review\", \"IESG Approval\",\n   \"IETF Review\", and \"\
    Standards Action\", are used in this memo to refer\n   to the processes described\
    \ in [RFC5226].\n   In general, due to the relatively small size of the IPv4 multicast\n\
    \   address space, further assignment of IPv4 multicast address space is\n   recommended\
    \ only in limited circumstances.  Specifically, the IANA\n   should only assign\
    \ addresses in those cases where:\n      - the dynamic selection Session Description\
    \ Protocol/Session\n        Announcement Protocol (SDP/SAP);\n      - GLOP (not\
    \ an acronym);\n      - Source-Specific Multicast (SSM); or\n      - Administratively\
    \ Scoped address spaces cannot be used.\n   The guidelines described below are\
    \ reflected in [IANA-protocols].\n   Network operators should also be aware of\
    \ the availability of IPv6\n   multicast addresses and consider using them where\
    \ feasible.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n   The word \"allocation\" designates a block of\
    \ addresses managed by a\n   registry for the purpose of making assignments and\
    \ allocations.  The\n   word \"assignment\" designates a block of addresses, or\
    \ a single\n   address, registered to an end-user for use on a specific network\
    \ or\n   set of networks.\n"
- title: 3.  Definition of Current Assignment Practice
  contents:
  - "3.  Definition of Current Assignment Practice\n   Unlike IPv4 unicast address\
    \ assignment, where blocks of addresses are\n   delegated to Regional Internet\
    \ Registries (RIRs), IPv4 multicast\n   addresses are assigned directly by the\
    \ IANA.  Current registration\n   groups appear as follows [IANA]:\n"

- title: 7.1.  Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Assignment Guidelines\n   Since addresses in the SDP/SAP Block are chosen\

    \ and is primarily\n   targeted at one-to-many (broadcast) applications.  Note\
    \ that this\n   block was initially assigned to the Versatile Message Transaction\n\
    \   Protocol (VMTP) transient groups [IANA].\n"
- title: 8.1.  Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Assignment Guidelines\n   Because the SSM model essentially makes the entire\
    \ multicast address\n   space local to the host, no IANA assignment policy is\
    \ required.\n   Note, however, that while no additional IANA assignment is required,\n\
    \   addresses in the Source-Specific Multicast Block are explicitly for\n   use\

  contents:
  - "9.  GLOP Block (233/8)\n   Addresses in the GLOP Block are globally-scoped, statically-assigned\n\
    \   addresses.  The assignment is made, for a domain with a 16-bit\n   Autonomous\
    \ System Number (ASN), by mapping a domain's autonomous\n   system number, expressed\
    \ in octets as X.Y, into the middle two octets\n   of the GLOP Block, yielding\
    \ an assignment of 233.X.Y.0/24.  The\n   mapping and assignment is defined in\
    \ [RFC3180].  Domains with a\n   32-bit ASN MAY apply for space in AD-HOC Block\

- title: 9.2.  AD-HOC Block III
  contents:
  - "9.2.  AD-HOC Block III\n   [RFC3138] delegated to the RIRs the assignment of\
    \ the GLOP sub-block\n   (233.252.0.0 - 233.255.255.255) mapped by the private\
    \ Autonomous\n   System (AS) space (64512-65534) and the IANA reserved ASN 65535\n\
    \   [RFC1930].  This space was known as Extended GLOP (EGLOP).  RFC 3138\n   should\
    \ not have asked the RIRs to develop policies for the EGLOP\n   space because\
    \ [RFC2860] reserves that to the IETF.  It is important\n   to make this space\
    \ available for use by network operators, and it is\n   therefore appropriate\
    \ to obsolete RFC 3138 and classify this address\n   range as available for AD-HOC\
    \ assignment as per the guidelines in\n   section 6.\n   The first /24 in this\
    \ range, 233.252.0.0/24, is assigned as \"MCAST-\n   TEST-NET\" for use in documentation\
    \ and example code. 233.252.0.0/24\n   SHOULD be used in conjunction with the\
    \ [RFC2606] domain names\n   example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol\

- title: 10.1.1.  Relative Offsets
  contents:
  - "10.1.1.  Relative Offsets\n   The relative offsets [RFC2365] are used to ensure\
    \ that a service can\n   be located independent of the extent of the enclosing\
    \ scope (see\n   [RFC3180] for details).  Since there are only 256 such offsets,\
    \ the\n   IANA should only assign a relative offset to a protocol that provides\n\
    \   an infrastructure supporting service.  Examples of such services\n   include\
    \ the Session Announcement Protocol [RFC2974].  Pursuant to\n   section 4.4.2\
    \ of [RFC2780], assignments of relative offsets follow an\n   Expert Review, IESG\
    \ Approval, or Standards Action process.  See\n   [IANA] for the current set of\
    \ assignments.\n"

    \   expert to review the application.  If the details given in the\n   request\
    \ are not clear, or further information is needed, the IESG\n   designated expert\

- title: 11.1.  Size of Assignments of IPv4 Multicast Addresses
  contents:
  - "11.1.  Size of Assignments of IPv4 Multicast Addresses\n   Occasionally, more\
    \ than one multicast address is required.  In these\n   cases, multiple addresses\
    \ are available in AD-HOC Block III.  Where\n   there is a requirement for a very\
    \ large number of addresses, the\n   assignment will be staged.  The additional\
    \ stages will only be made\n   after the complete use of the initial assignment(s).\n\
    \   A separate document describing the policy governing assignment of\n   addresses\
    \ in the AD-HOC blocks I, II, and III will be developed and\n   published.  The\
    \ format, location, and content has not yet been\n   decided and so these will\
    \ be documented in a future version of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 12.  Annual Review
  contents:
  - "12.  Annual Review\n   Given the dynamic nature of IPv4 multicast and its associated\n\
    \   infrastructure, and the previously undocumented IPv4 multicast\n   address\
    \ assignment guidelines, the IANA should conduct an annual\n   review of currently\
    \ assigned addresses.\n"
- title: 12.1.  Address Reclamation
  contents:
  - "12.1.  Address Reclamation\n   During the review described above, addresses that\
    \ were mis-assigned\n   should, where possible, be reclaimed or reassigned.\n\
    \   The IANA should also review assignments in the AD-HOC, \"DIS Transient\n \
    \  Groups\", and ST Multicast Groups [RFC1819] blocks and reclaim those\n   addresses\
    \ that are not in use on the global Internet (i.e., those\n   applications that\
    \ can use SSM, GLOP, or Administratively Scoped\n   addressing, or are not globally\
    \ routed).\n"
- title: 12.2.  Positive Renewal
  contents:
  - "12.2.  Positive Renewal\n   It is occasionally appropriate to make temporary\
    \ assignments that can\n   be renewed as necessary.  In cases where this happens\
    \ the registrant\n   needs to positively request an extension to the temporary\
    \ assignment\n   or the addresses assigned.  When the IANA has not received a\
    \ request\n   to renew the registration of a temporary assignment within 30 days\
    \ of\n   the expiry of the assignment, it MUST be removed from the multicast\n\
    \   registry.\n   Addresses returned to the IANA when a temporary assignment ends\
    \ MUST\n   NOT be assigned to anyone other than the last registrant for at least\n\
    \   one calendar year.\n"
