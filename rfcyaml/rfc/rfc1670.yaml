- title: Summary
  contents:
  - "Summary\n   This white paper expresses some personal opinions on IPng engineering\n\
    \   considerations, based on experience with DECnet Phase V transition.\n   It\
    \ suggests breaking down the IPng decisions and transition tasks\n   into smaller\
    \ parts so they can be tackled early by the relevant\n   experts.\n"
- title: Timescales
  contents:
  - "Timescales\n   In order to allow key decisions to be taken early, I would like\
    \ to\n   see IPng decisions and timescales broken down into into smaller\n   parts,\
    \ for example:\n    - address structure and allocation mechanism\n    - name service\
    \ changes\n    - host software and programming interface changes\n    - routing\
    \ protocol changes\n   Although interrelated, not all details need to be defined\
    \ by the same\n   date. Identify which decisions will be hard to change and which\
    \ can\n   be allowed to evolve. All changes should be worked on in parallel,\n\
    \   but the above list indicates a feeling for urgency of a decision.\n   Our\
    \ experience has been that administrative changes (as may be\n   required for\
    \ addressing changes) need the greatest elapse time for\n   implementation, whereas\
    \ routing protocol changes need the least.\n   I would like to see an early decision\
    \ on address structure and enough\n   information for service managers to start\
    \ planning their transition.\n   Some hosts will never be upgraded and will need\
    \ to be phased out or\n   configured with reduced connectivity. A lead time of\
    \ 10 years (or\n   more) will help to take good long term technical decisions\
    \ and ease\n   financial and organisational constraints.\n"
- title: Transition and deployment
  contents:
  - "Transition and deployment\n   Transition requires intimate knowledge of the environment\
    \ (financial,\n   political as well as technical). The task needs to be broken\
    \ down so\n   that service managers close to their clients can take decisions\
    \ and\n   make them happen.\n   Let the service managers adapt the solutions for\
    \ their environment by\n   providing them with a transition toolbox and scenarios\
    \ of their uses\n   based on real examples. Clearly state the merits and limitations\
    \ of\n   different transition strategies.\n   Provide for transition autonomy.\
    \ Let systems and sites transition at\n   different times, as convenient for them.\n\
    \   Identify what software needs to be changed and keep an up-to-date\n   list.\n\
    \   Identify what is essential to have in place so that service managers\n   can\
    \ transition at their own pace.\n   Allow for a feedback loop to improve software\
    \ based on experience.\n"
- title: Configuration, Administration, Operation
  contents:
  - "Configuration, Administration, Operation\n   We run IP on a wide range of equipment\
    \ and operating systems.  We\n   need an easy way to (re-)configure all our IP\
    \ capable systems.  The\n   systems need to be sent their IP parameters (e.g.,\
    \ their address,\n   address of their default router, address of their local name\
    \ servers)\n   and we need to obtain data from the system (e.g., contact information\n\
    \   for owner, location and name of system). We also need an easy way to\n   update\
    \ DNS.\n   In our environment systems are regularly moved between buildings and\n\
    \   we therefore find the tight coupling of IP address to physical subnet\n  \
    \ over restrictive. Automatic configuration could help overcome this.\n   We would\
    \ like to efficiently load balance users of various IP based\n   services (e.g.,\
    \ telnet, ftp, locally written applications) across a\n   number of systems.\n\
    \   The ability to break down addresses and routing into several levels\n   of\
    \ hierarchy is important to allow the delegation of network\n   management into\
    \ subdomains. As the network grows so does the desire\n   to increase the number\
    \ of levels of hierarchy.\n"
