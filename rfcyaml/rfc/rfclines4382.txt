The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Assumptions and Prerequisites It is assumed that certain things are configured and operational in order for the tables and objects described in this MIB to function correctly.
These things are outlined below:
MPLS in general, must be configured and operational.
Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) paths or traffic engineered tunnels [RFC3812] should be configured between PEs and CEs.
Brief Description of MIB Objects
The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the objects contained in the MPLS
This table represents the MPLS L3VPNs that are configured.
A Network Management System (NMS) or
SNMP agent creates an entry in this table for every MPLS
L3VPN configured on the LSR being examined.
The Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) that is configured at a particular device represents an instance of some VPN, but not the entire VPN (unless it is the only VRF, of course).
The collective set of VRF instances comprises the actual VPN.
This information is typically only known in its entirety at the NMS.
That is, specific devices generally only know of their local VRF information, but not that of other LSRs' VRFs.
This table represents the MPLS
L3VPN enabled interfaces that are associated with a specific VRF as represented in the aforementioned mplsL3VpnVrfTable.
Each entry in this table corresponds to an entry in the Interfaces MIB.
In addition, each entry extends its corresponding entry in the Interfaces MIB to contain specific MPLS L3VPN information.
Due to this correspondence, certain objects such as traffic counters are not found in this MIB to avoid overlap, but instead are found in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].
This table contains objects to measure the performance of MPLS L3VPNs and augments the mplsL3VpnVrfTable.
High capacity counters are provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on objects such as high speed interface counters.
The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor routes used by a particular VRF.
This includes a cross connect pointer into the MPLS LSR STD MIB's mplsXCTable, which may be used to refer that entry to its label stack used to label switch that entry.
The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor route targets for a particular VRF.
In this section, we provide a brief example of using the MIB objects described in the following section.
While this example is not meant to illustrate every nuance of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.
It is our intent that it is read only after the reader has gone through the MIB itself.
This configuration is under the assumption that 1) MPLS has been pre configured in the network, through enabling LDP or Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP TE); 2) OSPF or Intermediate System to Intermediate System
(IS IS) has been pre  configured; and 3) BGP sessions have been established between PEs.

This MIB contains managed object definitions for the Layer 3 Multiprotocol Label Switching Virtual Private Networks.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC4382; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
An identifier that is assigned to each MPLS/BGP VPN and is used to uniquely identify it.
This is assigned by the system operator or NMS and SHOULD be unique throughout the MPLS domain.
If this is the case, then this identifier can then be used at any LSR within a specific MPLS domain to identify this MPLS/BGP VPN.
It may also be possible to preserve the uniqueness of this identifier across MPLS domain boundaries, in which case this identifier can then be used to uniquely identify MPLS/BGP VPNs on a more global basis.
This object MAY be set to the VPN ID as defined in RFC 2685.

SYNTAX OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..31))
current DESCRIPTION "Syntax for a route distinguisher and route target as defined in [RFC4364].
Route targets can be specified to be imported, exported, or both.
For a complete definition of a route target, see [RFC4364].
"The number of VRFs that are active on this node.
That is, those VRFs whose corresponding mplsL3VpnVrfOperStatus object value is equal to operational (1)."
{ mplsL3VpnScalars 2 } mplsL3VpnConnectedInterfaces OBJECT TYPE
"Total number of interfaces connected to a VRF."
"If this object is true, then it enables the generation of all notifications defined in this MIB.
This object's value should be preserved across agent reboots.
REFERENCE "See also [RFC3413] for explanation that notifications are under the ultimate control of the MIB modules in this document."
"Denotes maximum number of routes that the device will allow all VRFs jointly to hold.
If this value is set to 0, this indicates that the device is unable to determine the absolute maximum.
In this case, the configured maximum MAY not actually be allowed by the device."
"Denotes the interval in seconds, at which the route max threshold notification may be reissued after the maximum value has been exceeded (or has been reached if mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes and mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh are equal) and the initial notification has been issued.
This value is intended to prevent continuous generation of notifications by an agent in the event that routes are continually added to a VRF after it has reached its maximum value.
If this value is set to 0, the agent should only issue a single notification at the time that the maximum threshold has been reached, and should not issue any more notifications until the value of routes has fallen below the configured threshold value.
This is the recommended default behavior.
"The number of illegally received labels above which the mplsNumVrfSecIllglLblThrshExcd notification is issued.
The persistence of this value mimics that of the device's configuration."
"This table specifies per interface MPLS capability and associated information."
An entry in this table is created by an LSR for every interface capable of supporting MPLS L3VPN.
Each entry in this table is meant to correspond to an entry in the Interfaces Table.
} mplsL3VpnIfConfIndex OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"This is a unique index for an entry in the mplsL3VpnIfConfTable.
A non zero index for an entry indicates the ifIndex for the corresponding interface entry in the MPLS VPN layer in the ifTable.
Note that this table does not necessarily correspond one to one with all entries in the Interface MIB having an ifType of MPLS layer; rather, only those that are enabled for MPLS L3VPN functionality.
"Denotes whether this link participates in a carrier's carrier, enterprise, or inter provider scenario."
"Denotes the route distribution protocol across the PE CE link.
Note that more than one routing protocol may be enabled at the same time
; thus, this object is specified as a bitmask.
For example, static(5) and ospf(2) are a typical configuration."
"The storage type for this VPN
Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent' need not allow write access to any columnar objects in the row."
"This variable is used to create, modify, and/or delete a row in this table.
Rows in this table signify that the specified interface is associated with this VRF.
If the row creation operation succeeds, the interface will have been associated with the specified VRF, otherwise the agent MUST not allow the association.
If the agent only allows read only operations on this table, it MUST create entries in this table as they are created on the device.
When a row in this table is in active(1) state, no objects in that row can be modified except mplsL3VpnIfConfStorageType and mplsL3VpnIfConfRowStatus."
"This table specifies per interface
L3VPN VRF Table capability and associated information.
Entries in this table define VRF routing instances associated with MPLS/VPN interfaces.
Note that multiple interfaces can belong to the same VRF instance.
The collection of all VRF instances comprises an actual VPN."
An entry in this table is created by an LSR for every VRF capable of supporting MPLS L3VPN.
The indexing provides an ordering of VRFs per VPN interface.
The human readable name of this VPN.
This MAY be equivalent to the [RFC2685] VPN ID, but may also vary.
If it is set to the VPN ID, it MUST be equivalent to the value of mplsL3VpnVrfVpnId.
It is strongly recommended that all sites supporting VRFs that are part of the same VPN use the same naming convention for VRFs as well as the same VPN ID.

If a VPN ID has not been specified for this VRF, then this variable SHOULD be set to a zero length OCTET STRING."
The human readable description of this VRF.
"The route distinguisher for this VRF.
"The time at which this VRF entry was created."
"Denotes whether or not a VRF is operational.
when there is at least one interface associated with the VRF whose ifOperStatus is up(1).
There does not exist at least one interface whose ifOperStatus is up(1).
There are no interfaces associated with the VRF."
"Total number of interfaces connected to this VRF with ifOperStatus   up(1).
This value should increase when an interface is associated with the corresponding VRF and its corresponding ifOperStatus is equal to up(1).
If an interface is associated whose ifOperStatus is not up(1), then the value is not incremented until such time as it transitions to this state.
This value should be decremented when an interface is disassociated with a VRF or the corresponding ifOperStatus transitions out of the up(1) state to any other state. "
"Total number of interfaces connected to this VRF (independent of ifOperStatus type)."
"Denotes mid level water marker for the number of routes that this VRF may hold.
"Denotes maximum number of routes that this VRF is configured to hold.
This value MUST be less than or equal to mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxPossRts unless it is set to 0.
"This variable is used to create, modify, and/or delete a row in this table.
When a row in this table is in active(1) state, no objects in that row can be modified except mplsL3VpnVrfConfAdminStatus, mplsL3VpnVrfConfRowStatus, and mplsL3VpnVrfConfStorageType."
"Indicates the desired operational status of this VRF."
"The storage type for this VPN VRF entry.
Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent' need not allow write access to any columnar objects in the row."
"This table specifies per VRF route target association.
Each entry identifies a connectivity policy supported as part of a VPN."
An entry in this table is created by an LSR for each route target configured for a VRF supporting a MPLS L3VPN instance.
The indexing provides an ordering per VRF instance.

L3VPN VRF Table security related counters."
MplsL3VpnVrfSecEntry MAX ACCESS    not accessible
An entry in this table is created by an LSR for every VRF capable of supporting MPLS L3VPN.
Each entry in this table is used to indicate security related information for each VRF entry.
"Indicates the number of illegally received labels on this VPN/VRF.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of mplsL3VpnVrfSecDiscontinuityTime."
"The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this entry's counters suffered a discontinuity.

"The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this entry's counters suffered a discontinuity.
If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value."

L3VPN VRF Table routing information.
Entries in this table define VRF routing entries associated with the specified MPLS/VPN interfaces.
Note that this table contains both BGP and Interior Gateway Protocol IGP routes, as both may appear in the same VRF.
An entry in this table is created by an LSR for every route present configured (either dynamically or statically) within the context of a specific VRF capable of supporting MPLS/BGP VPN.
The indexing provides an ordering of VRFs per VPN interface.
Implementers need to be aware that there are quite a few index objects that together can exceed the size allowed for an Object Identifier (OID).
So implementers must make sure that OIDs of column instances in this table will have no more than 128 sub identifiers
, otherwise they cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.

If not, then the index pair is not consistent and an inconsistentName error must be returned on SET or CREATE requests."
"This object is an opaque object without any defined semantics.
Its purpose is to serve as an additional index that may delineate between multiple entries to the same destination.

MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
"The type of the mplsL3VpnVrfRteInetCidrNextHop address, as defined in the InetAddress MIB.

Only those address types that may appear in an actual routing table are allowed as values of this object.
InetAddress MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
On remote routes, the address of the next system en route.
For non remote routes, a zero length string.
The type of this address is determined by the value of the mplsL3VpnVrfRteInetCidrNHopType object."
The ifIndex value that identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.
A value of 0 is valid and represents the scenario where no interface is specified.
Note that local(3) refers to a route for which the next hop is the final destination; remote(4) refers to a route for which the next hop is not the final destination.
Routes that do not result in traffic forwarding or rejection should not be displayed even if the implementation keeps them stored internally.
reject(2) refers to a route that, if matched, discards the message as unreachable and returns a notification (e.g., ICMP error) to the message sender.
This is used in some protocols as a means of correctly aggregating routes.
blackhole(5) refers to a route that, if matched, discards the message silently.
"The routing mechanism via which this route was learned.
Inclusion of values for gateway routing protocols is not intended to imply that hosts should support those protocols."
"The number of seconds since this route was last updated or otherwise determined to be correct.
Note that no semantics of 'too old' can be implied except through knowledge of the routing protocol by which the route was learned."
The Autonomous System Number of the next hop.
The semantics of this object are determined by the routing protocol specified in the route's mplsL3VpnVrfRteInetCidrProto value.
When this object is unknown or not relevant, its value should be set to zero.
The primary routing metric for this route.
The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing protocol specified in the route's mplsL3VpnVrfRteInetCidrProto value.
If this metric is not used, its value should be set to  1.
"An alternate routing metric for this route.
The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing protocol specified in the route's mplsL3VpnVrfRteInetCidrProto value.
If this metric is not used, its value should be set to  1.
"An alternate routing metric for this route.
The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing protocol specified in the route's mplsL3VpnVrfRteInetCidrProto value.
If this metric is not used, its value should be set to  1.
"An alternate routing metric for this route.

The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing protocol specified in the route's mplsL3VpnVrfRteInetCidrProto value.
If this metric is not used, its value should be set to  1.
The string containing the single octet 0x00 indicates that a label stack is not associated with this route entry.
This can be the case because the label bindings have not yet been established, or because some change in the agent has removed them.
When the label stack associated with this VRF route is created, it MUST establish the associated cross connect entry in the mplsXCTable and then set that index to the value of this object.
Changes to the cross connect object in the mplsXCTable MUST automatically be reflected in the value of this object.
If this object represents a static routing entry, then the manager must ensure that this entry is maintained consistently in the corresponding mplsXCTable as well."

c. Multiple interfaces are associated with this VRF, and the ifOperStatus of all interfaces is down(2), and the first of those interfaces has its ifOperStatus change to up(1)."

The last interface with ifOperStatus equal to up(1) is disassociated from a VRF."
"This notification is generated when the number of routes contained by the specified VRF exceeds the value indicated by mplsL3VpnVrfMidRouteThreshold.
A single notification MUST be generated when this threshold is exceeded, and no other notifications of this type should be issued until the value of mplsL3VpnVrfPerfCurrNumRoutes has fallen below that of mplsL3VpnVrfConfMidRteThresh."
"This notification is generated when the number of routes contained by the specified VRF exceeds or attempts to exceed the maximum allowed value as indicated by mplsL3VpnVrfMaxRouteThreshold.
In cases where mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh is set to the same value as mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes, mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh need not be exceeded; rather, just reached for this notification to be issued.
Note that mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime denotes the interval at which the this notification will be reissued after the maximum value has been exceeded (or reached if mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes and mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh are equal) and the initial notification has been issued.
This value is intended to prevent continuous generation of notifications by an agent in the event that routes are continually added to a VRF after it has reached its maximum value.
The default value is 0 minutes.
If this value is set to 0, the agent should only issue a single notification at the time that the maximum threshold has been reached, and should not issue any more notifications until the value of routes has fallen below the configured threshold value."
"This notification is generated when the number of illegal label violations on a VRF as indicated by mplsL3VpnVrfSecIllegalLblVltns has exceeded mplsL3VpnIllLblRcvThrsh.
The threshold is not included in the varbind here because the value of mplsL3VpnVrfSecIllegalLblVltns should be one greater than the threshold at the time this notification is issued."
"This notification is generated only after the number of routes contained by the specified VRF exceeds or attempts to exceed the maximum allowed value as indicated by mplsVrfMaxRouteThreshold, and then falls below this value.
The emission of this notification informs the operator that the error condition has been cleared without the operator having to query the device.
Note that mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime denotes the interval at which the mplsNumVrfRouteMaxThreshExceeded notification will be reissued after the maximum value has been exceeded (or reached if mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes and mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh are equal) and the initial notification has been issued.
Therefore, the generation of this notification should also be emitted with this same frequency (assuming that the error condition is cleared).
Specifically, if the error condition is reached and cleared several times during the period of time specified in mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime, only a single notification will be issued to indicate the first instance of the error condition as well as the first time the error condition is cleared.
This behavior is intended to prevent continuous generation of notifications by an agent in the event that routes are continually added and removed to/from a VRF after it has reached its maximum value.
The default value is 0.
If this value is set to 0, the agent should issue a notification whenever the maximum threshold has been cleared."

It is clear that these MIB modules are potentially useful for monitoring of MPLS LSRs
This MIB module can also be used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result in disruption of traffic on the network.
This is especially true if these VRFs have been previously provisioned and are in use.
The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where possible.
Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any v3 agent that implements this MIB module.
Administrators should consider whether read access to these objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable under certain circumstances.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
the mplsL3VpnVrfTable, mplsL3VpnIfConfTable tables collectively show the VRF interfaces and associated VRF configurations as well as their linkages to other MPLS related configuration and/or performance statistics.
Administrators not wishing to reveal this information should consider these objects sensitive/vulnerable and take precautions so they are not revealed.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
As described in MPLS TC STD MIB [RFC3811], MPLS related standards track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
There is one MPLS related MIB module contained in this document.
The following subsection requests IANA for a new assignment under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].
The IANA has assigned { mplsStdMIB 11 } to the MPLS
L3VPN STD MIB module specified in this document.
