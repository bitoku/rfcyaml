- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the policy for the use of 233/8 for statically\n\
    \   assigned multicast addresses.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   It is envisioned that the primary use of this space will\
    \ be many-to-\n   many applications.  This allocation is in addition to those\
    \ described\n   on [IANA] (e.g., [RFC2365]).  The IANA has allocated 223/8 as\
    \ per RFC\n   2770 [RFC2770].  This document obsoletes RFC 2770.\n"
- title: 2. Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2. Problem Statement\n   Multicast addresses have traditionally been allocated\
    \ by a dynamic\n   mechanism such as SDR [RFC2974].  However, many current multicast\n\
    \   deployment models are not amenable to dynamic allocation.  For\n   example,\
    \ many content aggregators require group addresses that are\n   fixed on a time\
    \ scale that is not amenable to allocation by a\n   mechanism such as described\
    \ in [RFC2974].  Perhaps more seriously,\n   since there is not general consensus\
    \ by providers, content\n   aggregators, or application writers as to the allocation\
    \ mechanism,\n   the Internet is left without a coherent multicast address allocation\n\
    \   scheme.\n   The MALLOC working group has created a specific strategy for global\n\
    \   multicast address allocation [RFC2730, RFC2909].  However, this\n   approach\
    \ has not been widely implemented or deployed.  This document\n   proposes a solution\
    \ for a subset of the problem, namely, those cases\n   not covered by Source Specific\
    \ Multicast.\n"
- title: 3. Address Space
  contents:
  - "3. Address Space\n   The IANA has allocated 223/8 as per RFC 2770 [RFC2770].\
    \  RFC 2770\n   describes the administration of the middle two octets of 233/8\
    \ in a\n   manner similar to that described in RFC 1797:\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6\
    \ 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \      |      233      |           16 bits AS          |  local bits   |\n   \
    \   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n"
- title: 3.1. Example
  contents:
  - "3.1. Example\n   Consider, for example, AS 5662.  Written in binary, left padded\
    \ with\n   0s, we get 0001011000011110.  Mapping the high order octet to the\n\
    \   second octet of the address, and the low order octet to the third\n   octet,\
    \ we get 233.22.30/24.\n"
- title: 4. Allocation
  contents:
  - "4. Allocation\n   As mentioned above, the allocation proposed here follows the\
    \ RFC 1797\n   (case 1) allocation scheme, modified as follows: the high-order\
    \ octet\n   has the value 233, and the next 16 bits are a previously assigned\n\
    \   Autonomous System number (AS), as registered by a network registry\n   and\
    \ listed in the RWhois database system.  This allows a single /24\n   per AS.\n\
    \   As was the case with RFC 1797, using the AS number in this way allows\n  \
    \ automatic assignment of a single /24 to each service provider and\n   does not\
    \ require an additional registration step.\n"
- title: 4.1. Private AS Space
  contents:
  - "4.1. Private AS Space\n   The part of 233/8 that is mapped to the private AS\
    \ space [RFC1930] is\n   assigned to the IRRs [RFC3138].\n"
- title: 5. Large AS Numbers
  contents:
  - "5. Large AS Numbers\n   It is important to note that this approach will work\
    \ only for two\n   octet AS numbers.  In particular, it does not work for any\
    \ AS number\n   extension scheme.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   The approach described here may have the effect\
    \ of reduced exposure\n   to denial-of-service attacks based on dynamic allocation.\
    \  Further,\n   since dynamic assignment does not cross domain boundaries, well-known\n\
    \   intra-domain security techniques can be applied.\n"
- title: 7. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. IANA Considerations\n   The IANA has assigned 233/8 for this purpose.\n"
- title: 8. Acknowledgments
  contents:
  - "8. Acknowledgments\n   This proposal originated with Peter Lothberg's idea that\
    \ we use the\n   same allocation (AS based) as described in RFC 1797.  Randy Bush\
    \ and\n   Mark Handley contributed many insightful comments, and Pete and\n  \
    \ Natalie Whiting contributed greatly to the readability of this\n   document.\n"
