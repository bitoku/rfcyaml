  - "Abstract\n   The IETF has designed process changes over the last ten years in\
    \ one\n   of two ways: announcement by the IESG, sometimes based on informal\n\
    \   agreements with limited community involvement and awareness, and\n   formal\
    \ use of the same mechanism used for protocol specification.\n   The first mechanism\
    \ has often proven to be too lightweight, the\n   second too heavyweight.\n  \
    \ This document specifies a middle-ground approach to the system of\n   making\
    \ changes to IETF process, one that relies heavily on a \"propose\n   and carry\
    \ out an experiment, evaluate the experiment, and then\n   establish permanent\
    \ procedures based on operational experience\" model\n   rather than those previously\
    \ attempted.\n"

- title: 2.  Background and Specification
  contents:
  - "2.  Background and Specification\n   Since the 1992 changes documented in [RFC1396],\
    \ the IETF has used two\n   mechanisms for process changes.\n   1. IESG has adopted\
    \ a number of procedural changes on its own\n      initiative and documented them\
    \ informally, utilizing the wide\n      discretion implicitly granted to them\
    \ by [RFC2026].  This provided\n      a lightweight mechanism for change, but\
    \ the lightness came with a\n      cost: There was sometimes too little alignment\
    \ with the larger\n      IETF community.\n   2. The IETF has also used the [RFC2026]\
    \ protocol standards\n      development process to identify a community of interest,\
    \ hold one\n      or more BoFs, charter a working group, discuss proposed changes\n\
    \      within the community, develop IETF-wide consensus on the changes,\n   \
    \   and publish (usually) Best Current Practice specifications.  This\n      provided\
    \ full community involvement but also came with a cost in\n      flexibility.\
    \  The IETF does not change its formal processes often\n      (the IPR clarifications\
    \ in [RFC3667, RFC3668] are the first\n      documented changes to [RFC2026] since\
    \ 1996), and the community is\n      understandably reluctant to permanently alter\
    \ or extend formally\n      adopted processes with untried new procedures.\n \
    \  There is a middle ground between BCP process updates and informal\n   agreements.\
    \  This document specifies regularizing and formalizing the\n   informal IESG\
    \ mechanisms listed in 1 above as a means of moving\n   forward with procedural\
    \ changes that might prove valuable.\n   The mechanisms outlined here add to the\
    \ IESG's range of tools for\n   dealing with process issues on an ongoing basis.\
    \  They supplement the\n   existing tools rather than attempting to replace them\
    \ with a single\n   \"magic bullet\".  The choice of using the procedure outlined\
    \ in this\n   document or other mechanisms available to the IESG and the community\n\
    \   -- present or future -- remains in the IESG's hands.  If the IESG\n   does\
    \ not exercise this discretion wisely, this document provides no\n   additional\
    \ remedies.\n   Some have interpreted the current procedures as giving the IESG\
    \ all\n   of the capabilities outlined here.  If this were true, this document\n\
    \   only encourages the IESG to use this type of mechanism more\n   frequently\
    \ in preference to less streamlined ones, and to more\n   explicitly document\
    \ its actions and decisions.\n   This specification permits and encourages the\
    \ IESG to adopt and\n   institute \"process experiments\" by using the following\
    \ procedure:\n   1. An I-D is written describing the proposed new or altered\n\
    \      procedure.  A statement of the problem expected to be resolved is\n   \
    \   desirable but not required (the intent is to keep the firm\n      requirements\
    \ for such an experiment as lightweight as possible).\n      Similarly, specific\
    \ experimental or evaluative criteria, although\n      highly desirable, are not\
    \ required -- for some of the process\n      changes we anticipate, having the\
    \ IESG reach a conclusion at the\n      end of the sunset period that the community\
    \ generally believes\n      things to be better (or worse) will be both adequate\
    \ and\n      sufficient.  The I-D must state an explicit \"sunset\" timeout\n\
    \      typically, not to exceed one year after adoption.\n   2. If the IESG believes\
    \ the proposal is plausible and plausibly\n      useful, a four-week IETF Last\
    \ Call is initiated.  The IESG can\n      institute whatever procedures it wishes\
    \ to make this determination\n      and to avoid denial of service attacks from\
    \ large numbers of\n      spurious or unimportant proposals.  In particular, they\
    \ might\n      institute a procedure requiring a number of endorsements, or\n\
    \      endorsements of a particular type, before the IESG considers the\n    \
    \  proposal.  The IESG is, however, expected to understand that\n      procedures\
    \ or review processes that act as a mechanism for\n      significant delays do\
    \ not fall within the intent of this\n      specification.\n   3. At the conclusion\
    \ of the Last Call, the IESG reevaluates the\n      plausibility and appropriateness\
    \ of the proposal.  If they\n      conclude that the proposed experiment is appropriate,\
    \ a second I-D\n      is generated (either by the IESG or by the original authors\
    \ with\n      IESG advice) that cleans up any definitional issues exposed in the\n\
    \      Last Call and that explicitly identifies and responds to issues\n     \
    \ raised during the Last Call.\n   4. The document and experiment are then announced,\
    \ the experiment is\n      begun, and the document is forwarded for publication\
    \ as an\n      Experimental RFC.\n   The IESG is explicitly authorized to use\
    \ this mechanism (based on\n   Experimental RFCs) to gain experience with proposed\
    \ changes to BCP\n   specifications.  There is no requirement to approve a BCP\n\
    \   specification for the experiment until the experiment is found to\n   have\
    \ value.\n   The IESG could, of course, reach a \"bad idea\" conclusion at any\
    \ stage\n   in this process and abandon the experiment.  It might recommend\n\
    \   publication of the experimental document, with a discussion of why it\n  \
    \ was a bad idea, but is not required to do so.  The list above is\n   deliberately\
    \ vague about where the I-Ds come from: a WG, design team,\n   individual contribution,\
    \ editing group, or other mechanism could be\n   used in the first and/or third\
    \ steps, but no specific mechanisms are\n   required, and the IESG is explicitly\
    \ permitted to generate such\n   proposals internally.\n   In each case, the IESG's\
    \ decision to go forward (or not) with a\n   procedural experiment, or the steps\
    \ leading up to one, is expected to\n   reflect their judgment of the existence\
    \ of rough consensus in the\n   community.  That judgment may be appealed using\
    \ the usual procedures,\n   but the IESG and the community are reminded that an\
    \ experimental\n   attempt to try something for a fixed period is typically a\
    \ better\n   engineering approach than extended philosophical discussion without\n\
    \   any experience to back it up.\n   Nothing above is to be construed as requiring\
    \ an IETF-wide attempt\n   for any given process experiment.  A proposal for such\
    \ an experiment\n   may specify selected areas, selected working groups, working\
    \ groups\n   meeting some specific criteria (e.g., those created after a\n   particular\
    \ time or of a specified age), or be specific in other ways.\n   At or before\
    \ the end of the \"sunset\" timeout, the IESG would either\n   revise (or cause\
    \ to be revised) the document into a BCP RFC or the\n   procedure would expire\
    \ and, presumably, not be tried again unless\n   something changed radically.\
    \  A document describing why the\n   experiment had succeeded or failed would\
    \ be desirable but could not,\n   realistically, be a requirement.  If the procedure\
    \ went to BCP, the\n   BCP would reflect what we would call \"operational experience\"\
    \ in the\n   real world.\n   We note that, if the procedures the IESG has adopted\
    \ (and the\n   procedural exceptions it has made) over the last decade are\n \
    \  legitimate, then the IESG has the authority to institute the changes\n   specified\
    \ here by bootstrapping this process.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies a mechanism for evolving\
    \ IETF procedures.  It\n   does not raise or consider any protocol-specific security\
    \ issues.  In\n   considering experimental changes to procedures, the IESG should,\
    \ of\n   course, exercise due caution that such changes not reduce the quality\n\
    \   of security review and consideration for protocols or, at least, that\n  \
    \ the process experiment proposals contain early detection and\n   correction\
    \ mechanisms should quality deterioration occur.\n"
