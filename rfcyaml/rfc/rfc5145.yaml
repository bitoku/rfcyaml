  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)\
    \ to\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) migration is the process of evolving an\n  \
    \ MPLS-TE-based control plane to a GMPLS-based control plane.  The\n   network\
    \ under consideration for migration is, therefore, a\n   packet-switching network.\n\
    \   There are several motivations for such migration, mainly the desire\n   to\
    \ take advantage of new features and functions added to the GMPLS\n   protocols,\
    \ which are not present in MPLS-TE for packet networks.\n   Additionally, before\
    \ migrating a packet-switching network from\n   MPLS-TE to GMPLS, one may choose\
    \ to first migrate a lower-layer\n   network with no control plane (e.g., controlled\
    \ by a management\n   plane) to using a GMPLS control plane.  This may lead to\
    \ the desire\n   for MPLS-TE/GMPLS (transport network) interworking to provide\n\
    \   enhanced TE support and facilitate the later migration of the\n   packet-switching\
    \ network.\n   Although an appropriate migration strategy will be selected based\
    \ on\n   various factors including the service provider's network deployment\n\
    \   plan, customer demand, deployed network equipments, operational\n   policy,\
    \ etc., the transition mechanisms used should also provide\n   consistent operation\
    \ of newly introduced GMPLS networks, while\n   minimizing the impact on the operation\
    \ of existing MPLS-TE networks.\n   This document describes several migration\
    \ strategies and the\n   interworking scenarios that arise during migration. \
    \ It also examines\n   the implications for network deployments and for protocol\
    \ usage.  As\n   the GMPLS signaling and routing protocols are different from\
    \ the\n   MPLS-TE control protocols, interworking mechanisms between MPLS-TE\n\
    \   and GMPLS networks, or network elements, may be needed to compensate\n   for\
    \ the differences.\n   Note that MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocols can coexist as \"\
    ships in the\n   night\" without any interworking issues.\n"

- title: 3.  Motivations for Migration
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivations for Migration\n   Motivations for migration will vary for different\
    \ service providers.\n   This section is presented to provide background so that\
    \ the migration\n   discussions may be seen in context.  Sections 4 and 5 provide\n\
    \   examples to illustrate the migration models and processes.\n   Migration of\
    \ an MPLS-capable Label Switching Router (LSR) to include\n   GMPLS capabilities\
    \ may be performed for one or more reasons,\n   including, not exhaustively:\n\
    \   o  To add all GMPLS PSC features to an existing MPLS network (upgrade\n  \
    \    MPLS LSRs).\n   o  To add specific GMPLS PSC features and operate them within\
    \ an MPLS\n      network (e.g., [RFC4872] and [RFC4873]).\n   o  To integrate\
    \ a new GMPLS PSC network with an existing MPLS network\n      (without upgrading\
    \ any of the MPLS LSRs).\n   o  To allow existing MPLS LSRs to interoperate with\
    \ new non-MPLS LSRs\n      supporting only GMPLS PSC and/or non-PSC features.\n\
    \   o  To integrate multiple control networks, e.g., managed by separate\n   \
    \   administrative organizations, and which independently utilize MPLS\n     \
    \ or GMPLS.\n   o  To build integrated PSC and non-PSC networks.  The non-PSC\n\
    \      networks are controlled by GMPLS.\n   The objective of migration from MPLS\
    \ to GMPLS is that all LSRs, and\n   the entire network, support GMPLS protocols.\
    \  During this process,\n   various interim situations may exist, giving rise\
    \ to the interworking\n   situations described in this document.  The interim\
    \ situations may\n   exist for considerable periods of time, but the ultimate\
    \ objective is\n   not to preserve these situations.  For the purposes of this\
    \ document,\n   they should be considered as temporary and transitory.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  MPLS to GMPLS Migration Models\n   Three reference migration models are described\
    \ below.  Multiple\n   migration models may coexist in the same network.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Island Model
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Island Model\n   In the island model, \"islands\" of network nodes operating\
    \ one\n   protocol exist within a \"sea\" of nodes using the other protocol.\n\
    \   For example, consider an island of GMPLS-capable nodes (PSC) that is\n   introduced\
    \ into a legacy MPLS network.  Such an island might be\n   composed of newly added\
    \ GMPLS nodes, or it might arise from the\n   upgrade of existing nodes that previously\
    \ operated MPLS protocols.\n   The opposite is also quite possible.  That is,\
    \ there is a possibility\n   that an island happens to be MPLS-capable within\
    \ a GMPLS sea.  Such a\n   situation might arise in the later stages of migration,\
    \ when all but\n   a few islands of MPLS-capable nodes have been upgraded to GMPLS.\n\
    \   It is also possible that a lower-layer, manually-provisioned network\n   (for\
    \ example, a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) network) is\n   constructed under\
    \ an MPLS PSC network.  During the process of\n   migrating both networks to GMPLS,\
    \ the lower-layer network might be\n   migrated first.  This would appear as a\
    \ GMPLS island within an MPLS\n   sea.\n   Lastly, it is possible to consider\
    \ individual nodes as islands.  That\n   is, it would be possible to upgrade or\
    \ insert an individual\n   GMPLS-capable node within an MPLS network, and to treat\
    \ that GMPLS\n   node as an island.\n   Over time, collections of MPLS devices\
    \ are replaced or upgraded to\n   create new GMPLS islands or to extend existing\
    \ ones, and distinct\n   GMPLS islands may be joined together until the whole\
    \ network is\n   GMPLS-capable.\n   From a migration/interworking point of view,\
    \ we need to examine how\n   these islands are positioned and how Label Switched\
    \ Paths (LSPs)\n   connect between the islands.\n   Four categories of interworking\
    \ scenarios are considered: (1)\n   MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS, (2) GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS, (3)\
    \ MPLS-GMPLS, and (4)\n   GMPLS-MPLS.  In case 1, the interworking behavior is\
    \ examined based\n   on whether the GMPLS islands are PSC or non-PSC.\n   Figure\
    \ 1 shows an example of the island model for MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS\n   interworking.\
    \  The model consists of a transit GMPLS island in an\n   MPLS sea.  The nodes\
    \ at the boundary of the GMPLS island (G1, G2, G5,\n   and G6) are referred to\
    \ as \"island border nodes\".  If the GMPLS\n   island was non-PSC, all nodes\
    \ except the island border nodes in the\n   GMPLS-based transit island (G3 and\
    \ G4) would be non-PSC devices,\n   i.e., optical equipment (TDM, Lambda Switch\
    \ Capable (LSC), and Fiber\n   Switch Capable (FSC)).\n   .................  ..........................\

    \   - tunneling the signaling across the island network using LSP nesting\n  \

- title: 4.2.  Integrated Model
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Integrated Model\n   The second migration model involves a more integrated\
    \ migration\n   strategy.  New devices that are capable of operating both MPLS\
    \ and\n   GMPLS protocols are introduced into the MPLS network.\n   In the integrated\
    \ model, there are two types of nodes present during\n   migration:\n      - those\
    \ that support MPLS only (legacy nodes); and\n      - those that support MPLS\
    \ and GMPLS.\n   In this model, as existing MPLS devices are upgraded to support\
    \ both\n   MPLS and GMPLS, the network continues to operate with an MPLS control\n\
    \   plane, but some LSRs are also capable of operating with a GMPLS\n   control\
    \ plane.  So, LSPs are provisioned using MPLS protocols where\n   one end point\
    \ of a service is a legacy MPLS node and/or where the\n   selected path between\
    \ end points traverses a legacy node that is not\n   GMPLS-capable.  But where\
    \ the service can be provided using only\n   GMPLS-capable nodes [RFC5073], it\
    \ may be routed accordingly and can\n   achieve a higher level of functionality\
    \ by utilizing GMPLS features.\n   Once all devices in the network are GMPLS-capable,\
    \ the MPLS-specific\n   protocol elements may be turned off, and no new devices\
    \ need to\n   support these protocol elements.\n   In this model, the questions\
    \ to be addressed concern the coexistence\n   of the two protocol sets within\
    \ the network.  Actual interworking is\n   not a concern.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Phased Model
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Phased Model\n   The phased model introduces GMPLS features and protocol\
    \ elements into\n   an MPLS network one by one.  For example, some objects or\
    \ sub-objects\n   (such as the Explicit Route Object (ERO) label sub-object, [RFC3473])\n\
    \   might be introduced into the signaling used by LSRs that are\n   otherwise\
    \ MPLS-capable.  This would produce a kind of hybrid LSR.\n   This approach may\
    \ appear simpler to implement as one is able to\n   quickly and easily pick up\
    \ new key functions without needing to\n   upgrade the whole protocol implementation.\
    \  It is most likely to be\n   used where there is a desire to rapidly implement\
    \ a particular\n   function within a network without the necessity to install\
    \ and test\n   the full GMPLS function.\n   Interoperability concerns though are\
    \ exacerbated by this migration\n   model, unless all LSRs in the network are\
    \ updated simultaneously and\n   there is a clear understanding of which subset\
    \ of features are to be\n   included in the hybrid LSRs.  Interworking between\
    \ a hybrid LSR and\n   an unchanged MPLS LSR would put the hybrid LSR in the role\
    \ of a GMPLS\n   LSR, as described in the previous sections, and puts the unchanged\n\
    \   LSR in the role of an MPLS LSR.  The potential for different hybrids\n   within\
    \ the network will complicate matters considerably.  This model\n   is, therefore,\
    \ only appropriate for use when the set of new features\n   to be deployed is\
    \ well known and limited, and where there is a clear\n   understanding of and\
    \ agreement on this set of features by the network\n   operators of the ISP(s)\
    \ involved as well as all vendors whose\n   equipment will be involved in the\
    \ migration.\n"
- title: 5.  Migration Strategies and Toolkit
  contents:
  - "5.  Migration Strategies and Toolkit\n   An appropriate migration strategy is\
    \ selected by a network operator\n   based on factors including the service provider's\
    \ network deployment\n   plan, customer demand, existing network equipment, operational\n\
    \   policy, support from its vendors, etc.\n   For PSC networks, the migration\
    \ strategy involves the selection\n   between the models described in the previous\
    \ section.  The choice\n   will depend upon the final objective (full GMPLS capability,\
    \ partial\n   upgrade to include specific GMPLS features, or no change to existing\n\
    \   IP/MPLS networks), and upon the immediate objectives (full, phased,\n   or\
    \ staged upgrade).\n   For PSC networks serviced by non-PSC networks, two basic\
    \ migration\n   strategies can be considered.  In the first strategy, the non-PSC\n\
    \   network is made GMPLS-capable, first, and then the PSC network is\n   migrated\
    \ to GMPLS.  This might arise when, in order to expand the\n   network capacity,\
    \ GMPLS-based non-PSC sub-networks are introduced\n   into the legacy MPLS-based\
    \ networks.  Subsequently, the legacy\n   MPLS-based PSC network is migrated to\
    \ be GMPLS-capable, as described\n   in the previous paragraph.  Finally, the\
    \ entire network, including\n   both PSC and non-PSC nodes, may be controlled\
    \ by GMPLS.\n   The second strategy is to migrate the PSC network to GMPLS first,\
    \ and\n   then enable GMPLS within the non-PSC network.  The PSC network is\n\
    \   migrated as described before, and when the entire PSC network is\n   completely\
    \ converted to GMPLS, GMPLS-based non-PSC devices and\n   networks may be introduced\
    \ without any issues of interworking between\n   MPLS and GMPLS.\n   These migration\
    \ strategies and the migration models described in the\n   previous section are\
    \ not necessarily mutually exclusive.  Mixtures of\n   all strategies and models\
    \ could be applied.  The migration models and\n   strategies selected will give\
    \ rise to one or more of the interworking\n   cases described in the following\
    \ section.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Routing Interworking\n   Migration strategies may necessitate some interworking\
    \ between MPLS\n   and GMPLS routing protocols.  GMPLS extends the TE information\n\
    \   advertised by the IGPs to include non-PSC information and extended\n   PSC\
    \ information.  Because the GMPLS information is provided as\n   additional TLVs\
    \ that are carried along with the MPLS information,\n   MPLS LSRs are able to\
    \ \"see\" all GMPLS LSRs as though they were MPLS\n   PSC LSRs.  They will also\
    \ see other GMPLS information, but will\n   ignore it, flooding it transparently\
    \ across the MPLS network for use\n   by other GMPLS LSRs.\n   - Routing separation\
    \ is achieved in the overlay and border peer\n     models.  This is convenient\
    \ since only the border nodes need to be\n     aware of the different protocol\
    \ variants, and no mapping is\n     required.  It is suitable to the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS\
    \ and\n     GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS island migration models.\n   - Direct distribution\
    \ involves the flooding of MPLS routing\n     information into a GMPLS network,\
    \ and GMPLS routing information\n     into an MPLS network.  The border nodes\
    \ make no attempt to filter\n     the information.  This mode of operation relies\
    \ on the fact that\n     MPLS routers will ignore, but continue to flood, GMPLS\
    \ routing\n     information that they do not understand.  The presence of\n  \
    \   additional GMPLS routing information will not interfere with the\n     way\
    \ that MPLS LSRs select routes.  Although this is not a problem\n     in a PSC-only\
    \ network, it could cause problems in a peer\n     architecture network that includes\
    \ non-PSC nodes, as the MPLS nodes\n     are not capable of determining the switching\
    \ types of the other\n     LSRs and will attempt to signal end-to-end LSPs assuming\
    \ all LSRs\n     to be PSC.  This fact would require island border nodes to take\n\
    \     triggered action to set up tunnels across islands of different\n     switching\
    \ capabilities.\n     GMPLS LSRs might be impacted by the absence of GMPLS-specific\n\
    \     information in advertisements initiated by MPLS LSRs.  Specific\n     procedures\
    \ might be required to ensure consistent behavior by GMPLS\n     nodes.  If this\
    \ issue is addressed, then direct distribution can be\n     used in all migration\
    \ models (except the overlay and border peer\n     architectural models where\
    \ the problem does not arise).\n   - Protocol mapping converts routing advertisements\
    \ so that they can\n     be received in one protocol and transmitted in the other.\
    \  For\n     example, a GMPLS routing advertisement could have all of its\n  \
    \   GMPLS-specific information removed and could be flooded as an MPLS\n     advertisement.\
    \  This mode of interworking would require careful\n     standardization of the\
    \ correct behavior especially where an MPLS\n     advertisement requires default\
    \ values of GMPLS-specific fields to\n     be generated before the advertisement\
    \ can be flooded further.\n     There is also considerable risk of confusion in\
    \ closely meshed\n     networks where many LSRs have MPLS- and GMPLS-capable interfaces.\n\
    \     This option for routing interworking during migration is NOT\n     RECOMMENDED\
    \ for any migration model.  Note that converting\n     GMPLS-specific sub-TLVs\
    \ to MPLS-specific ones but not stripping the\n     GMPLS-specific ones is considered\
    \ a variant of the proposed\n     solution in the previous bullet (unknown sub-TLVs\
    \ should be ignored\n     [RFC3630] but must continue to be flooded).\n   - Ships\
    \ in the night refers to a mode of operation where both MPLS\n     and GMPLS routing\
    \ protocol variants are operated in the same\n     network at the same time as\
    \ separate routing protocol instances.\n     The two instances are independent\
    \ and are used to create routing\n     adjacencies between LSRs of the same type.\
    \  This mode of operation\n     may be appropriate to the integrated migration\
    \ model.\n"
- title: 5.1.3.  Signaling Interworking
  contents:
  - "5.1.3.  Signaling Interworking\n   Signaling protocols are used to establish\
    \ LSPs and are the principal\n   concern for interworking during migration.  Issues\
    \ of compatibility\n   arise because of differences in the encodings and codepoints\
    \ used by\n   MPLS and GMPLS signaling, but also because of differences in\n \
    \  functionality provided by MPLS and GMPLS.\n   - Tunneling and stitching [RFC5150]\
    \ (GMPLS-PSC case) mechanisms\n     provide the potential to avoid direct protocol\
    \ interworking during\n     migration in the island model because protocol elements\
    \ are\n     transported transparently across migration islands without being\n\
    \     inspected.  However, care may be needed to achieve functional\n     mapping\
    \ in these modes of operation since one set of features may\n     need to be supported\
    \ across a network designed to support a\n     different set of features.  In\
    \ general, this is easily achieved for\n     the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS model, but may\
    \ be hard to achieve in the\n     GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS model, for example, when end-to-end\
    \ bidirectional\n     LSPs are requested, since the MPLS island does not support\n\
    \     bidirectional LSPs.\n     Note that tunneling and stitching are not available\
    \ in unbalanced\n     island models because in these cases, the LSP end points\
    \ use\n     different protocols.\n   - Protocol mapping is the conversion of signaling\
    \ messages between\n     MPLS and GMPLS.  This mechanism requires careful documentation\
    \ of\n     the protocol fields and how they are mapped.  This is relatively\n\
    \     straightforward in the MPLS-GMPLS unbalanced island model for LSPs\n   \
    \  signaled in the MPLS-GMPLS direction.  However, it may be more\n     complex\
    \ for LSPs signaled in the opposite direction, and this will\n     lead to considerable\
    \ complications for providing GMPLS services\n     over the MPLS island and for\
    \ terminating those services at an\n     egress LSR that is not GMPLS-capable.\
    \  Further, in balanced island\n     models, and in particular where there are\
    \ multiple small\n     (individual node) islands, the repeated conversion of signaling\n\
    \     parameters may lead to loss of information (and functionality) or\n    \
    \ mis-requests.\n   - Ships in the night could be used in the integrated migration\
    \ model\n     to allow MPLS-capable LSRs to establish LSPs using MPLS signaling\n\
    \     protocols and GMPLS LSRs to establish LSPs using GMPLS signaling\n     protocols.\
    \  LSRs that can handle both sets of protocols could work\n     with both types\
    \ of LSRs, and no conversion of protocols would be\n     needed.\n"

    \   separately or as one management domain? For example, in the Island\n   Model,\
    \ it is possible to consider managing islands of one capability\n   separately\
    \ from the surrounding sea.  In the case of islands that\n   have different switching\
    \ capabilities, it is possible that the\n   islands already have separate management\
    \ in place before the\n   migration: the resultant migrated network may seek to\

    \ a period of\n   network maintenance.\n   Where island boundaries exist, it must\
    \ be possible to manage the\n   relationships between protocols and to indicate\
    \ which interfaces\n   support which protocols on a border LSR.  Further, island\

  - "6.2.  Information and Data Models\n   No special information or data models are\

    \   During migration, therefore, it may be necessary for LSRs and\n   management\
    \ applications to support both MPLS and GMPLS management\n   data.\n   The GMPLS\
    \ MIB modules are designed to allow support of the MPLS\n   protocols, and they\
    \ are built on the MPLS MIB modules through\n   extensions and augmentations.\

    \ to\n   connect across GMPLS islands, then requirements for a multi-layer OAM\n\
    \   technique may be introduced into what was previously defined in the\n   flat\

    \ components, but this does not impact the\n   management protocols, just the\
    \ data that they carry.\n   It should also be observed that providing signaling\
    \ and routing\n   connectivity across a migration island in support of a layered\n\
    \   architecture may require the use of protocol tunnels (such as Generic\n  \

    \ on network\n   operation and on the services perceived by the network users.\n\
    \   To this end, planners should consider reducing the number of\n   migration\
    \ steps that they perform and minimizing the number of\n   migration islands that\
    \ are created.\n   A network manager may prefer the island model especially when\n\
    \   migration will extend over a significant operational period because\n   it\
    \ allows the different network islands to be administered as\n   separate management\
    \ domains.  This is particularly the case in the\n   overlay, augmented network\
