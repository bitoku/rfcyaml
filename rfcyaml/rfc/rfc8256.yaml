  - "1.  Introduction\n   According to the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [RFC5860], mechanisms\
    \ MUST\n   be available for alerting service providers of faults or defects that\n\
    \   affect their services.  In addition, to ensure that faults or service\n  \
    \ degradation can be localized, operators need a function to diagnose\n   the\
    \ detected problem.  Using end-to-end monitoring for this purpose\n   is insufficient\
    \ in that an operator will not be able to localize a\n   fault or service degradation\
    \ accurately.\n   A segment monitoring function that can focus on a specific segment\
    \ of\n   a transport path and that can provide a detailed analysis is\n   indispensable\
    \ to promptly and accurately localize the fault.  A\n   function for monitoring\
    \ path segments has been defined to perform\n   this task for MPLS-TP.  However,\
    \ as noted in the MPLS-TP OAM\n   Framework [RFC6371], the current method for\
    \ segment monitoring of a\n   transport path has implications that hinder the\
    \ usage in an operator\n   network.\n   After elaborating on the problem statement\
    \ for the path segment\n   monitoring function as it is currently defined, this\
    \ document\n   provides requirements for an on-demand path segment monitoring\n\
    \   function without traffic disruption.  Further works are required to\n   evaluate\
    \ how proposed requirements match with current MPLS\n   architecture and to identify\
    \ possible solutions.\n"

- title: 3.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   A Sub-Path Maintenance Element (SPME) function to monitor\
    \ (and to\n   protect and/or manage) MPLS-TP network segments is defined in\n\
    \   [RFC5921].  The SPME is defined between the edges of the segment of a\n  \
    \ transport path that needs to be monitored, protected, or managed.\n   SPME is\
    \ created by stacking the shim header (MPLS header), according\n   to [RFC3031];\
    \ it is defined as the segment where the header is\n   stacked.  OAM messages\
    \ can be initiated at the edge of the SPME.\n   They can be sent to the peer edge\
    \ of the SPME or to a MIP along the\n   SPME by setting the TTL value of the Label\
    \ Stack Entry (LSE) and\n   interface identifier value at the corresponding hierarchical\
    \ LSP\n   level in case of a per-node model.\n   According to Section 3.8 of [RFC6371],\
    \ MPLS-TP segment monitoring\n   should satisfy two network objectives:\n   (N1)\
    \  The monitoring and maintenance of current transport paths has\n         to\
    \ be conducted in-service without traffic disruption.\n   (N2)  Segment monitoring\
    \ must not modify the forwarding of the\n         segment portion of the transport\
    \ path.\n   The SPME function that is defined in [RFC5921] has the following\n\
    \   drawbacks:\n   (P1)  It increases network management complexity, because a\
    \ new sub-\n         layer and new MEPs and MIPs have to be configured for the\
    \ SPME.\n   (P2)  Original conditions of the path change.\n   (P3)  The client\
    \ traffic over a transport path is disrupted if the\n         SPME is configured\
    \ on-demand.\n   Problem (P1) is related to the management of each additional\
    \ sub-\n   layer required for segment monitoring in an MPLS-TP network.  When\
    \ an\n   SPME is applied to administer on-demand OAM functions in MPLS-TP\n  \
    \ networks, a rule for operationally differentiating those SPMEs will\n   be required\
    \ at least within an administrative domain.  This forces\n   operators to implement\
    \ at least an additional layer into the\n   management systems that will only\
    \ be used for on-demand path segment\n   monitoring.  From the perspective of\
    \ operation, increasing the number\n   of managed layers and managed addresses/identifiers\
    \ is not desirable\n   in view of keeping the management systems as simple as\
    \ possible.\n   Moreover, using the currently defined methods, on-demand setting\
    \ of\n   SPMEs causes problems (P2) and (P3) due to additional label stacking.\n\
    \   Problem (P2) arises because the MPLS-exposed label value and MPLS\n   frame\
    \ length change.  The monitoring function should monitor the\n   status without\
    \ changing any condition of the target segment or of the\n   target transport\
    \ path.  Changing the settings of the original shim\n   header should not be allowed,\
    \ because this change corresponds to\n   creating a new segment of the original\
    \ transport path that differs\n   from the original one.  When the conditions\
    \ of the path change, the\n   measured values or observed data will also change.\
    \  This may make the\n   monitoring meaningless because the result of the measurement\
    \ would no\n   longer reflect the performance of the connection where the original\n\
    \   fault or degradation occurred.  As an example, setting up an on-\n   demand\
    \ SPME will result in the LSRs within the monitoring segment\n   only looking\
    \ at the added (stacked) labels and not at the labels of\n   the original LSP.\
    \  This means that problems stemming from incorrect\n   (or unexpected) treatment\
    \ of labels of the original LSP by the nodes\n   within the monitored segment\
    \ cannot be identified when setting up\n   SPME.  This might include hardware\
    \ problems during label lookup,\n   misconfiguration, etc.  Therefore, operators\
    \ have to pay extra\n   attention to correctly setting and checking the label\
    \ values of the\n   original LSP in the configuration.  Of course, the reverse\
    \ of this\n   situation is also possible; for example, an incorrect or unexpected\n\
    \   treatment of SPME labels can result in false detection of a fault\n   where\
    \ no problem existed originally.\n   Figure 1 shows an example of SPME settings.\
    \  In the figure, \"X\" is\n   the label value of the original path expected at\
    \ the tail end of node\n   D.  \"210\" and \"220\" are label values allocated\
    \ for SPME.  The label\n   values of the original path are modified as are the\
    \ values of the\n   stacked labels.  As shown in Figure 1, SPME changes both the\
    \ length\n   of MPLS frames and the label value(s).  In particular, performance\n\
    \   monitoring measurements (e.g., Delay Measurement and Packet Loss\n   Measurement)\
    \ are sensitive to these changes.  As an example,\n   increasing the packet length\
    \ may impact packet loss due to MTU\n   settings; modifying the label stack may\
    \ introduce packet loss, or it\n   may fix packet loss depending on the configuration\
    \ status.  Such\n   changes influence packet delay, too, even if, from a practical\
    \ point\n   of view, it is likely that only a few services will experience a\n\
    \   practical impact.\n      (Before SPME settings)\n       ---     ---     ---\

    \ 1: SPME Settings Example\n   Problem (P3) can be avoided if the operator sets\
    \ SPMEs in advance and\n   maintains them until the end of life of a transport\
    \ path: but this\n   does not support on-demand.  Furthermore, SMPEs cannot be\
    \ set\n   arbitrarily because overlapping of path segments is limited to\n   nesting\
    \ relationships.  As a result, possible SPME configurations of\n   segments of\
    \ an original transport path are limited due to the\n   characteristic of the\
    \ SPME shown in Figure 1, even if SPMEs are\n   preconfigured.\n   Although the\
    \ make-before-break procedure in the survivability\n   document [RFC6372] supports\
    \ configuration for monitoring according to\n   the framework document [RFC5921],\
    \ without traffic disruption the\n   configuration of an SPME is not possible\
    \ without violating the\n   network objective (N2).  These concerns are described\
    \ in Section 3.8\n   of [RFC6371].\n   Additionally, the make-before-break approach\
    \ typically relies on a\n   control plane and requires additional functionalities\
    \ for a\n   management system to properly support SPME creation and traffic\n\
    \   switching from the original transport path to the SPME.\n   As an example,\
    \ the old and new transport resources (e.g., LSP\n   tunnels) might compete with\
    \ each other for resources that they have\n   in common.  Depending on availability\
    \ of resources, this competition\n   can cause admission control to prevent the\
    \ new LSP tunnel from being\n   established as this bandwidth accounting deviates\
    \ from the\n   traditional (non-control plane) management-system operation.  While\n\
    \   SPMEs can be applied in any network context (single-domain, multi-\n   domain,\
    \ single-carrier, multi-carrier, etc.), the main applications\n   are in inter-carrier\
    \ or inter-domain segment monitoring where they\n   are typically preconfigured\
    \ or pre-instantiated.  SPME instantiates a\n   hierarchical path (introducing\
    \ MPLS-label stacking) through which OAM\n   packets can be sent.  The SPME monitoring\
    \ function is also mainly\n   important for protecting bundles of transport paths\
    \ and the carriers'\n   carrier solutions within an administrative domain.\n \
    \  The analogy for SPME in other transport technologies is Tandem\n   Connection\
    \ Monitoring (TCM).  TCM is used in Optical Transport\n   Networks (OTNs) and\
    \ Ethernet transport networks.  It supports on-\n   demand but does not affect\
    \ the path.  For example, in OTNs, TCM\n   allows the insertion and removal of\
    \ performance monitoring overhead\n   within the frame at intermediate points\
    \ in the network.  It is done\n   such that their insertion and removal do not\
    \ change the conditions of\n   the path.  Though, as the OAM overhead is part\
    \ of the frame\n   (designated overhead bytes), it is constrained to a predefined\
    \ number\n   of monitoring segments.\n   To summarize: the problem statement is\
    \ that the current sub-path\n   maintenance based on a hierarchical LSP (SPME)\
    \ is problematic for\n   preconfiguration in terms of increasing the number of\
    \ managed objects\n   by layer stacking and identifiers/addresses.  An on-demand\n\
    \   configuration of SPME is one of the possible approaches for\n   minimizing\
    \ the impact of these issues.  However, the current\n   procedure is unfavorable\
    \ because the on-demand configuration for\n   monitoring changes the condition\
    \ of the original monitored path.  To\n   avoid or minimize the impact of the\
    \ drawbacks discussed above, a more\n   efficient approach is required for the\
    \ operation of an MPLS-TP\n   transport network.  A monitoring mechanism, named\
    \ \"Hitless Path\n   Segment Monitoring\" (HPSM), supporting on-demand path segment\n\
    \   monitoring without traffic disruption is needed.\n"

  - "4.6.  Monitoring an Arbitrary Segment\n   The main objective for on-demand path\
    \ segment monitoring is to\n   diagnose the fault locations.  A possible realistic\
    \ diagnostic\n   procedure is to fix one endpoint of a segment at the MEP of the\n\
    \   transport path under observation and progressively change the length\n   of\
    \ the segments.  It is, therefore, possible to monitor all the\n   paths, step-by-step,\
    \ with a granularity that depends on equipment\n   implementations.  For example,\
    \ Figure 5 shows the case where the\n   granularity is at the interface level\
    \ (i.e., monitoring is at each\n   input interface and output interface of each\
    \ piece of equipment).\n       ---     ---     ---     ---     ---\n      |  \

    \ If the transport path\n   is protected, the HPSM function may monitor unintended\

    \ scenario A is shown in Figure 7.  In this scenario, a\n   working LSP and a\

    \ suspend HPSM monitoring\n   until network restoration takes place.  Another\
    \ possible approach may\n   be to compare the node/interface ID in the OAM packet\
    \ with that at\n   the node reached at TTL termination and, if this does not match,\
    \ a\n   suspension of HPSM monitoring should be triggered.  The above\n   approaches\
    \ are valid in any circumstance, both for protected and\n   unprotected networks\
