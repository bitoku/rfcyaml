  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo discusses implementation decisions for routing\
    \ issues in\n   the NSFNET, especially in the NSFNET Backbone.  Of special concern\
    \ is\n   the restriction of routing information to advertize the best route as\n\
    \   established by a policy decision.  Distribution of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The NSFNET backbone routes packets between the Regionals Networks\
    \ to\n   which it is connected, (i.e., the packets arriving at a backbone\n  \
    \ entry node are routed to an exit node).  How they travel through the\n   network\
    \ is determined by two components:\n     the NSFNET backbone routing protocol/algorithm,\
    \ and\n     additional information about the externally connected networks.\n\
    \   This paper is concerned with how reachability information between the\n  \
    \ external networks and the NSFNET backbone is exchanged so that\n   packets can\
    \ be routed to the correct destination by using a\n   reasonable path.\n"
- title: EGP as reachability protocol
  contents:
  - "EGP as reachability protocol\n   The EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol) routing\
    \ method will be used to\n   exchange reachability information between the NSFNET\
    \ backbone and the\n   regional networks.\n   There are several problems with\
    \ using EGP as a reachability protocol\n   for routing in a meshed environment.\
    \  Some EGP components require\n   further definitions for the NSFNET backbone\
    \ - regional network\n   interactions.  It should be noted that the use of EGP\
    \ is only viewed\n   as an interim measure until better inter autonomous system\
    \ protocols\n   are defined and widely deployed for gateways used by regional\n\
    \   networks.\n   The following is a list of some EGP problems and issues:\n \
    \     The EGP model assumes an engineered spanning tree topology,\n      however,\
    \ the NSFNET (due to the presence of backdoor routes) does\n      not fit into\
    \ this model.  In the NSFNET the same network may be\n      advertized as reachable\
    \ by more than one regional network.\n      Besides the fact that the overall\
    \ NSFNET does not fit into a\n      spanning tree model there are serious concerns\
    \ with the concept\n      of the \"core\" (central to the EGP) and its obvious\
    \ deficiencies.\n      While EGP is going to isolate intra-Regional routing from\
    \ the\n      intra-NSFNET-Backbone routing, it does not address the issue of\n\
    \      false information which may be supplied by regional networks.\n      EGP\
    \ by itself does not protect a particular network from unwanted\n      and unsolicited\
    \ representation by some regional network.  As an\n      example, if network N1\
    \ is reachable through regional network R1\n      as well as through regional\
    \ network R2, EGP has no provisions to\n      specify one of these paths as a\
    \ primary and one as a secondary,\n      since there is not generally accepted\
    \ interpretation of EGP\n      metrics today.  Also, there is nothing in EGP which\
    \ can prevent one\n      or more regional networks from advertizing other networks\
    \ (in\n      particular, networks which belong to other regional networks) as\n\
    \      reachable with zero distance.  This could result in the creation\n    \
    \  of a \"black hole\" or at least in suboptimal IP routing.\n      EGP by itself\
    \ has no provisions to guarantee that routes through\n      the NSFNET Backbone\
    \ will be preferred over routes through the\n      backdoor routers or vice versa.\n"
- title: Policy Based Routing
  contents:
  - "Policy Based Routing\n   Looking at the problems listed above the appearance\
    \ of the new\n   factors like autonomy and mutual trust becomes obvious.  While\
    \ trying\n   to achieve the routing functionality required for the new NSFNET\n\
    \   backbone we should realize that one of our primary concerns has to be\n  \
    \ the accommodation of those new factors.\n   This means that some kind of a rudimentary\
    \ Policy Based Routing\n   method becomes imperative.  We would like to emphasize,\
    \ however, that\n   we are not talking about complete Policy Based Routing, but\
    \ that we\n   are rather concerned about supporting a minimum subset of a policy\n\
    \   functionality to be an initial solution to the above mentioned\n   problems.\
    \  This requires support and cooperation between the\n   management of each of\
    \ the networks connected to the NSFNET backbone.\n   We need to support the ability\
    \ of a particular network N, which\n   belongs to one of the regional networks,\
    \ to establish a bilateral\n   agreement with one or more regional networks of\
    \ the type \"network N\n   can be reached via one or more regional networks (RN1,\
    \ RN2, ...\n   RNx)\".  This allows each network to select one or more\n   representatives\
    \ at the regional network level.  Once this agreement\n   is established the information\
    \ will be available to:\n     The network which initiated the agreement.\n   \
    \  The management of the regional network(s) with whom this\n     agreement has\
    \ been established.\n     The NSFNET backbone Network Operation Center where it\
    \ will be\n     entered into the Routing Policy Data Base which will be available\n\
    \     through the NSFNET information services.\n   Supporting multiple routes\
    \ to the NSFNET core requires the guarantee\n   that for a certain network N,\
    \ no regional network other than the\n   one(s) selected by N, will advertize\
    \ N as reachable, which\n   necessitates that the NSFNET core will ignore unauthorized\n\
    \   advertisements for network N.\n"
- title: EGP and Rudimentary Policy Based Routing
  contents:
  - "EGP and Rudimentary Policy Based Routing\n   Each network which belongs to the\
    \ NSFNET will select a specific\n   regional network as its primary representative\
    \ to the NSFNET core by\n   bilateral agreement with the management of same regional\
    \ network as\n   well as the NSFNET backbone management.  The same network can\n\
    \   furthermore select an arbitrary number of other regional networks as\n   their\
    \ secondary, tertiary, etc., representative by establishing\n   bilateral agreements\
    \ with the management of the corresponding\n   regional networks as well as the\
    \ NSFNET backbone management.\n   Reachability information supplied by each regional\
    \ network will be\n   distributed to all other NSS nodes of the NSFNET Backbone.\
    \  We would\n   like to emphasize that we are not going to flood EGP packets\n\
    \   internally within the backbone, but to rather use the learned\n   information\
    \ for the interior gateway protocol, which uses the ANSI\n   IS-IS protocol.\n\
    \   The implementation allows for a defined regional network to advertize\n  \
    \ a particular leaf network in the EGP NR packets with a distance of\n   zero.\
    \  Secondary representatives may advertize the same network with\n   distance\
    \ one or higher.  If the path through the primary regional\n   representative\
    \ is available all secondary paths will be ignored.  If\n   the path through the\
    \ primary regional representative goes down (which\n   will be discovered via\
    \ the EGP NR information), the next path with\n   the lowest available EGP metric\
    \ will be used.\n   We will also be able to detect and report unsolicited\n  \
    \ representations.  This will be done by examining (on a periodic\n   basis) all\
    \ reachability information obtained via EGP.  The result\n   will be compared\
    \ against the Routing Policy Data Base which will hold\n   information about all\
    \ bilateral agreements between networks and their\n   regional representatives.\
    \  Any mismatch will cause an alarm to the\n   Network Operations Center.  For\
    \ example, network N established a\n   bilateral agreement with the regional network\
    \ R1 electing it as its\n   primary representative. The EGP NR record received\
    \ from the regional\n   network R5 advertizes the network N as reachable with\
    \ distance zero.\n   By comparing the Routing Policy Data Base entry for the network\
    \ N\n   with the EGP NR record a mismatch will be detected and an alarm is\n \
    \  forwarded to the Network Operation Center.\n   Since the whole scheme is based\
    \ on a combination of the network\n   number and the autonomous system number,\
    \ to allow for further\n   verification, it is also important to insure the correctness\
    \ of the\n   autonomous system numbers as advertized by the regionals networks\
    \ to\n   the NSFNET core.\n   The autonomous system number validation for each\
    \ regional network\n   will be performed at the NSS which connects the particular\
    \ leaf\n   network to the NSFNET backbone.  All discrepancies wil be reported\
    \ to\n   the Network Operations Center.\n   The NSFNET backbone will be considered\
    \ as a separate Autonomous\n   System with its own autonomous system number.\n"
- title: Backbone versus Backdoor Routes
  contents:
  - "Backbone versus Backdoor Routes\n   There are instances where regional networks\
    \ prefer paths through some\n   backdoor route over paths through the NSFNET backbone.\
    \  Therefore,\n   the reachability information advertized by the NSFNET core to\
    \ the\n   regional networks (via EGP NR records) will always use a fixed metric\n\
    \   of 128 for all routes.  This may aid to encourage traffic to flow\n   through\
    \ backdoors, if desired and available.\n   The regional networks can use a variety\
    \ of techniques to determine\n   how they route traffic for any particular network\
    \ at their own\n   option.\n"
- title: What do we expect from the Regional Networks
  contents:
  - "What do we expect from the Regional Networks\n   Each regional network should\
    \ get its own Autonomous System number.\n   The connection between regional networks\
    \ to NSFNET backbone will be\n   done via EGP.  It is the responsibility of the\
    \ regional backbone to\n   provide an EGP functionality via the attachment to\
    \ the E-PSP\n   dedicated to the regional network.\n   The EGP functionality may\
    \ require a translation of network numbers in\n   and out of the regional network.\
    \  In any case, the NSFNET backbone\n   expects individual network numbers of\
    \ the leaf networks of the\n   regional network, as long as they should be advertised,\
    \ and will\n   announce individual networks known to the NSFNET core to the regional\n\
    \   network.\n   The EGP support should includes the ability to configure EGP\
    \ metrics\n   from some statically definable configuration table.  If the EGP\n\
    \   metrics cannot be defined or if they are not fixed the metric\n   determination\
    \ will be done by the NSFNET backbone routers, as taken\n   from their databases,\
    \ themselves.  In that case, it is the\n   responsibility of the regional network\
    \ to provide the NSFNET backbone\n   management with the metric data to allow\
    \ for proper use of metrics.\n   We also expect each regional network to handle\
    \ all bilateral\n   agreements with its leaf networks regarding Policy Based Routing\
    \ and\n   supply a copy of those agreements to the NSFNET backbone management.\n"
