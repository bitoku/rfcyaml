    \ RFC 404\nThis is to correct a typographic error in RFC# 404.  The\naddress of\
    \ the ISI IMP is 22 (decimal), not 86 as was\nerroneously stated.  All other numbers\
    \ in RFC# 404 were\ncorrect;  the complete (corrected) text follows:\nThis week\
    \ the RAND IMP was temporarily removed from the\nNetwork and a new IMP was installed\
    \ at ISI.  Some of the\npeople and computers from RAND have moved to ISI, in\n\
    particular the RAND TENEX is now the ISI TENEX.  The address\nof the ISI IMP is\
    \ 22 (decimal) and the TENEX at ISI is Host\nnumber one; thus the \"Network Address\"\
    \ of the ISI TENEX is 86.\nSometime early next week the RAND IMP will be re-installed.\n\
    It will still be IMP number 7, and the IBM 360/65 at RAND will\nstill be \"Network\
    \ Address\" 7.\n    [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n\
    \    [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n    [ direction\
    \ of Alex McKenzie.                      1/97 ]\n"
