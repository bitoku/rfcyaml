Abstract This document updates RFC 4090 for the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
Traffic Engineering (TE) procedures defined for facility backup protection.
The updates include extensions that reduce the amount of signaling and processing that occurs during Fast Reroute (FRR); as a result, scalability when undergoing FRR convergence after a link or node failure is improved.
These extensions allow the RSVP message exchange between the Point of Local Repair (PLR) and the Merge Point (MP) nodes to be independent of the number of protected Label Switched Paths (LSPs) traversing between them when facility bypass FRR protection is used.
The signaling extensions are fully backwards compatible with nodes that do not support them.
The Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures defined in [RFC4090] describe the mechanisms for the Point of Local Repair (PLR) to reroute traffic and signaling of a protected RSVP TE Label Switched Path (LSP) onto the bypass tunnel in the event of a TE link or node failure.
Such signaling procedures are performed individually for each affected protected LSP.
This may eventually lead to control plane scalability and latency issues on the PLR and/or the Merge Point (MP) nodes due to limited memory and CPU processing resources.
This condition is exacerbated when the failure affects a large number of protected LSPs that traverse the same PLR and MP nodes.
For example, in a large scale deployment of RSVP TE LSPs, a single Label Switching Router (LSR) acting as a PLR node may host tens of thousands of protected RSVP TE LSPs egressing the same protected link and also act as an MP node for a similar number of LSPs that ingress on the same link.
In the event of the failure of the link or neighbor node, the RSVP TE control plane of the node (when acting as a PLR node) becomes busy rerouting protected LSPs over the bypass tunnel(s) in one direction and (when acting as an MP node) becomes busy merging RSVP states from signaling received over bypass tunnels for one or more LSPs in the reverse direction.
Label Edge Routers (LERs) that are notified of the local repair at any downstream LSRs will attempt to (re)converge the affected RSVP TE LSPs onto newly computed paths   possibly traversing the same previously affected LSR(s).
As a result, the RSVP TE control plane becomes overwhelmed (1) by the amount of FRR RSVP TE processing overhead following the link or node failure and (2) due to other control plane protocols (e.g., IGP) that undergo convergence on the same node at the same time.
Today, each protected RSVP TE LSP is signaled individually over the bypass tunnel after FRR.
The changes introduced in this document allow the PLR node to assign multiple protected LSPs to a bypass tunnel group and to communicate this assignment to the MP, such that upon failure, the signaling over the bypass tunnel happens on one or more bypass tunnel groups.
This document defines new extensions that 1.
update the procedures defined in [RFC4090] for facility backup protection, to enable the MP node to become aware of the PLR node's bypass tunnel assignment group or groups.
allow FRR procedures between the PLR and the MP nodes to be signaled and processed on one or more per bypass tunnel groups.
As defined in [RFC2961], summary refresh procedures use MESSAGE ID to refresh the RSVP Path and Resv states to help with scaling.
The Summary FRR procedures introduced in this document build on those concepts to allow the MESSAGE ID(s) to be exchanged on one or more per bypass tunnel assignment groups and continue to use summary refresh procedures while reducing the amount of messaging that occurs after rerouting signaling over the bypass tunnel post

Bypass Summary FRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object.
Added by the PLR node for each LSP protected by the bypass tunnel B SFRR Active:  Bypass Summary FRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object.
Used to notify the MP node that one or more groups of protected LSPs have been rerouted over the associated bypass tunnel MTU:  Maximum Transmission Unit 3.
The RSVP ASSOCIATION object is defined in [RFC4872] as a means to associate LSPs with each other.
For example, in the context of one or more GMPLS controlled LSPs, the ASSOCIATION object is used to associate a recovery LSP with the LSP(s) it is protecting.
The Extended ASSOCIATION object is introduced in [RFC6780] to expand on the possible usage of the ASSOCIATION object and generalize the definition of the Extended Association ID field.
This document defines the use of the Extended ASSOCIATION object to carry the Summary FRR information and associate the protected LSP or LSPs with the bypass tunnel that protects them.
Two new Association Types for the Extended ASSOCIATION object, and new Extended Association IDs, are defined in this document to describe the Bypass Summary FRR
Ready (B SFRR Ready) and Bypass Summary
Active (B SFRR Active) associations.
The PLR node creates and manages the Summary FRR LSP groups (identified by Bypass Group Identifiers) and shares the group identifiers with the MP via signaling.
A PLR node SHOULD assign the same Bypass Group Identifier
This minimizes the number of bypass tunnel Summary FRR groups and optimizes the amount of signaling that occurs between the PLR and the MP nodes after FRR.
A PLR node that supports Summary FRR procedures adds an Extended ASSOCIATION object with a B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID in the RSVP Path message of the protected LSP.
The PLR node adds the protected LSP Bypass Group Identifier, information from the assigned bypass tunnel, and a MESSAGE ID object into the B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID.
The MP uses the information contained in the received B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID to refresh and merge the protected LSP Path state after FRR occurs.
An MP node that supports Summary FRR procedures adds the B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object and respective Extended Association ID in the RSVP Resv message of the protected LSP to acknowledge the PLR's bypass tunnel assignment and provide the MESSAGE ID object that the MP node will use to refresh the protected LSP Resv state after FRR occurs.
The MP maintains the PLR node group assignments learned from signaling and acknowledges the group assignments to the PLR node via signaling.
Once the PLR node receives the group assignment acknowledgment from the MP, the FRR signaling can proceed based on Summary FRR procedures as described in this document.
The B SFRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object with Extended Association ID is sent by the PLR node after activating the Summary FRR procedures.
The B SFRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object with Extended Association ID is sent within the RSVP Path message of the bypass tunnel to inform the MP node that one or more groups of protected LSPs protected by the bypass tunnel are now being rerouted over the bypass tunnel.
The Extended ASSOCIATION object is populated using the rules defined below to associate a protected LSP with the bypass tunnel that is protecting it when Summary FRR procedures are enabled.
The Association Type, Association ID, and Association Source MUST be set as defined in [RFC4872] for the ASSOCIATION object.
The Association Source is set to an address of the PLR node.
A new Association Type is defined for B SFRR Ready as follows:
The B SFRR Ready Association Type
The Extended ASSOCIATION object's Global Association Source MUST be set according to the rules defined in [RFC6780].
The B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID is populated by the PLR node when performing Bypass Summary FRR Ready association for a protected LSP.
The rules governing its population are described in the subsequent sections.
IPv4 B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID The IPv4 Extended Association ID for the B SFRR Ready Association Type is carried inside the IPv4 Extended ASSOCIATION object and has the following format:
The IPv4 Extended Association ID for B SFRR Ready Bypass Tunnel ID:  16 bits The bypass tunnel identifier.
Reserved:  16 bits Reserved for future use.
MUST be set to zero when sending and ignored on receipt.
32 bits The bypass tunnel source IPv4 address.
The bypass tunnel destination IPv4 address.
Bypass Group Identifier:  32 bits The bypass tunnel group identifier that is assigned to the LSP.
A MESSAGE ID object as defined by [RFC2961].
SFRR Ready Extended Association ID
The IPv6 Extended Association ID for the B SFRR Ready Association Type is carried inside the IPv6 Extended ASSOCIATION object and has the following format:
The IPv6 Extended Association ID for B SFRR Ready Bypass Tunnel ID:  16 bits
Reserved:  16 bits Reserved for future use.
MUST be set to zero when sending and ignored on receipt.
Bypass Source IPv6 Address:  128 bits The bypass tunnel source IPv6 address.
The bypass tunnel destination IPv6 address.
Bypass Group Identifier:  32 bits The bypass tunnel group identifier that is assigned to the LSP.
A MESSAGE ID object as defined by [RFC2961].
Processing Rules for B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION
Object A PLR node assigns a bypass tunnel and Bypass Group Identifier for each protected LSP.
The same Bypass Group Identifier is used for the set of protected LSPs that share the same bypass tunnel, traverse the same egress link, and are not already rerouted.
The PLR node MUST generate a MESSAGE ID object with Epoch and Message Identifier set according to [RFC2961].
The MESSAGE ID object Flags MUST be cleared when transmitted by the PLR node and ignored when received at the MP node.
A PLR node MUST generate a new Message Identifier each time the contents of the B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID change (e.g., when the PLR node changes the bypass tunnel assignment).
A PLR node notifies the MP node of the bypass tunnel assignment via adding a B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object and Extended Association ID in the RSVP Path message for the protected LSP, using the procedures described in Section 3.3.
An MP node acknowledges the assignment to the PLR node by signaling the B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object and Extended Association ID within the RSVP Resv message of the protected LSP.
With the exception of the MESSAGE ID object, all other fields from the received B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID in the RSVP Path message are copied into the B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID to be added in the Resv message.
The MESSAGE ID object is set according to [RFC2961].
The MESSAGE ID object Flags MUST be cleared when transmitted by the MP node and ignored when received at the PLR node.
A new Message Identifier MUST be used to acknowledge an updated PLR node's assignment.
A PLR node considers the protected LSP as Summary FRR capable only if all the fields in the B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID that are sent in the RSVP Path message match the fields received in the RSVP Resv message (with the exception of the MESSAGE ID).
If the fields do not match or if the B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object is absent in a subsequent refresh, the PLR node MUST consider the protected LSP as not Summary FRR capable.
A race condition may arise for a previously Summary FRR capable protected LSP when the MP node triggers a refresh that does not contain the B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object, while at the same time the PLR triggers Summary FRR procedures due to a fault occurring concurrently.
In this case, it is possible that the PLR triggers Summary FRR procedures on the protected LSP before it can receive and process the refresh from the MP node.
As a result, the MP will receive an Srefresh with a Message Identifier that is not associated with any state.
As per [RFC2961], this results in the MP generating an Srefresh NACK for this Message Identifier and sending it back to the PLR.
The PLR processes the Srefresh NACK, replays the full Path state associated with the Message Identifier, and subsequently recovers from this condition.
The Extended ASSOCIATION object for the B SFRR Active Association Type is populated by a PLR node to indicate to the MP node (the bypass tunnel destination)
that one or more groups of Summary FRR capable protected LSPs that are being protected by the bypass tunnel are being rerouted over the bypass tunnel.
The B SFRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object is carried in the RSVP Path message of the bypass tunnel and signaled downstream towards the MP (the bypass tunnel destination).
The Association Type, Association ID, and Association Source MUST be set as defined in [RFC4872] for the ASSOCIATION object.
The Association Source is set to an address of the PLR node.
A new Association Type is defined for B SFRR Active as follows:
The B SFRR Active Association Type Extended Association ID for B
The B SFRR Active Extended Association ID is populated by the PLR node for the Bypass Summary FRR Active association.
The rules to populate the Extended Association ID in this case are described below.
IPv4 B SFRR Active Extended Association ID
The IPv4 Extended Association ID for the B SFRR Active Association Type is carried inside the IPv4 Extended ASSOCIATION object and has the following format:
The IPv4 Extended Association ID for B SFRR Active Num BGIDs:  16 bits Number of Bypass Group Identifier fields.
Reserved:  16 bits Reserved for future use.
Bypass Group Identifier:  32 bits each A Bypass Group Identifier that was previously signaled by the PLR using the Extended ASSOCIATION object in the B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID.
One or more Bypass Group Identifiers MAY be included.
HOP Object:  Class 3, as defined by
[RFC2205] Replacement RSVP HOP object to be applied to all LSPs associated with each of the following Bypass Group Identifiers.
This corresponds to C Type   1 for IPv4 RSVP HOP.
TIME VALUES object:  Class 5, as defined by [RFC2205]
Replacement TIME VALUES object to be applied to all LSPs associated with each of the preceding Bypass Group Identifiers after receiving the B SFRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object.
The IPv4 address that the PLR node sets to identify one or more backup paths as described in Section 6.1.1 of [RFC4090].
This address is applicable to all groups identified by any Bypass Group Identifiers carried in the B SFRR Active Extended Association ID.
The IPv6 Extended Association ID for the B SFRR Active Association Type is carried inside the IPv6 Extended ASSOCIATION object and has the following format:
: The IPv6 Extended Association ID for B SFRR Active Num BGIDs:  16 bits Number of Bypass Group Identifier fields.
Reserved:  16 bits Reserved for future use.
Bypass Group Identifier:  32 bits each A Bypass Group Identifier that was previously signaled by the PLR using the Extended ASSOCIATION object in the B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID.
One or more Bypass Group Identifiers MAY be included.
HOP Object:  Class 3, as defined by
[RFC2205] Replacement RSVP HOP object to be applied to all LSPs associated with each of the following Bypass Group Identifiers.
This corresponds to C Type   2 for IPv6 RSVP HOP.
TIME VALUES object:  Class 5, as defined by [RFC2205]
Replacement TIME VALUES object to be applied to all LSPs associated with each of the following Bypass Group Identifiers after receiving the B SFRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object.
The IPv6 address that the PLR node sets to identify one or more backup paths as described in Section 6.1.1 of [RFC4090].
This address is applicable to all groups identified by any Bypass Group Identifiers carried in the B SFRR Active Extended Association ID.
Signaling Procedures prior to Failure Before Summary FRR procedures can be used, a handshake MUST be completed between the PLR and MP nodes.
This handshake is performed using the Extended ASSOCIATION object that carries the B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID in both the RSVP Path and Resv messages of the protected LSP.
The facility backup method introduced in [RFC4090] takes advantage of MPLS label stacking (the PLR node imposes additional MPLS labels post FRR) to allow rerouting of protected traffic over the backup path.
The backup path may have stricter MTU requirements; due to label stacking at the PLR node, the protected traffic may exceed the backup path MTU.
It is assumed that the operator engineers their network to allow rerouting of protected traffic and the additional label stacking at the PLR node in order to not exceed the backup path MTU.
When using the procedures defined in this document, the PLR node MUST ensure that the bypass tunnel assignment can satisfy
the protected LSP MTU requirements post FRR.
This prevents any packets from being dropped due to exceeding the MTU size of the backup path after traffic is rerouted onto the bypass tunnel post failure.
Section 2.6 of [RFC3209] describes a mechanism to determine whether a node needs to fragment or drop a packet when it exceeds the path MTU discovered using RSVP signaling on the primary LSP path.
A PLR can leverage the RSVP discovered path MTU on the backup and primary LSP paths to ensure that the MTU is not exceeded before or after rerouting the protected traffic onto the bypass tunnel.
The B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object is added by each PLR node in the RSVP Path message of the protected LSP to record the bypass tunnel assignment.
This object is updated every time the PLR node updates the bypass tunnel assignment.
This results in triggering an RSVP Path change message.
Upon receiving an RSVP Resv message with a B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object, the PLR node checks to see if the expected subobjects from the B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID are present.
If present, the PLR node determines if the MP has acknowledged the current PLR node's assignment.
To be a valid acknowledgment, the received B SFRR Ready Extended Association ID contents within the RSVP Resv message of the protected LSP MUST match the latest B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object and Association ID contents that the PLR node had sent within the RSVP Path message (with the exception of the MESSAGE ID).
Note that when forwarding an RSVP Resv message upstream, the PLR node SHOULD remove any/all B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION objects whose Bypass Source IPv4 Address or Bypass Source IPv6 Address field matches any of the PLR node addresses.
MP Signaling Procedure Upon receiving an RSVP Path message with a B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object, an MP node processes all
(there may be multiple PLR nodes for a single MP node)
B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION objects that have the MP node address as the bypass destination address in the Extended Association ID.
The MP node first ensures the existence of the bypass tunnel and that the Bypass Group Identifier is not already FRR Active.
That is, an LSP cannot join a group that is already FRR rerouted.
The MP node builds a mirrored Summary FRR group database per PLR node by associating the Bypass Source IPv4 Address or Bypass Source IPv6 Address that is carried in the IPv4 or IPv6 B SFRR Ready Extended Association IDs, respectively.
The MESSAGE ID is extracted and recorded for the protected LSP Path state.
The MP node signals a B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object and Extended Association ID in the RSVP Resv message of the protected LSP.
With the exception of the MESSAGE ID objects, all other fields of the received B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object in the RSVP Path message are copied into the B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object to be added in the Resv message.
The MESSAGE ID object is set according to [RFC2961] with the Flags cleared.
Note that an MP may receive more than one RSVP Path message with the B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION object from one or more different upstream PLR nodes.
In this case, the MP node is expected to save all the received MESSAGE IDs received from the different upstream PLR nodes.
After a failure, the MP node determines and activates the state(s) associated with the Bypass Group Identifier(s) received in the RSVP Path message containing the B SFRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object that is signaled over the bypass tunnel from the PLR node, as described in Section 3.4.
When forwarding an RSVP Path message downstream, the MP node SHOULD remove any/all B SFRR Ready Extended ASSOCIATION objects whose Bypass Destination IPv4 Address or Bypass Destination IPv6 Address field matches any of the MP node addresses.
Upon detection of a fault (egress link or node failure), the PLR node will first perform the object modification procedures described by Section 6.4.3 of [RFC4090] for all affected protected LSPs.
For the Summary FRR capable LSPs that are assigned to the same bypass tunnel, a common RSVP HOP and SENDER TEMPLATE MUST be used.
The PLR node MUST signal non Summary FRR capable LSPs over the bypass tunnel before signaling the Summary FRR capable LSPs.
This is needed to allow for the case where the PLR node recently changed a bypass assignment and the MP has not processed the change yet.
The B SFRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object is sent within the RSVP Path message of the bypass tunnel to reroute the RSVP state of Summary FRR capable LSPs.
After a failure event, when using the Summary FRR path signaling procedures, an individual RSVP Path message is not signaled for each Summary FRR LSP.
Instead, to reroute Summary FRR LSPs via the bypass tunnel, the PLR node adds the B SFRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object in the RSVP Path message of the RSVP session of the bypass tunnel.
The RSVP HOP Object field in the B SFRR Active Extended Association ID is set to a common object that will be applied to all LSPs associated with the Bypass Group Identifiers that are carried in the B SFRR Active Extended Association ID.
The PLR node adds the Bypass Group Identifier(s) of any group or groups that have common group attributes, including the tunnel sender address, to the same B SFRR Active Extended Association ID.
Note that multiple ASSOCIATION objects, each carrying a B SFRR Active Extended Association ID, can be carried within a single RSVP Path message of the bypass tunnel and sent towards the MP as described in [RFC6780].
Any previously received MESSAGE IDs from the MP are activated on the PLR.
As a result, the PLR starts sending Srefresh messages containing the specific Message Identifier(s) for the states to be refreshed.
MP Signaling Procedure Upon receiving an RSVP Path message with a B SFRR Active Extended ASSOCIATION object, the MP performs normal merge point processing for each protected LSP associated with each Bypass Group Identifier, as if it had received an individual RSVP Path message for that LSP.
For each Summary FRR capable LSP that is being merged, the MP first modifies the Path state as follows: 1.
The RSVP HOP object is copied from the RSVP HOP Object field in the B SFRR Active Extended Association ID.
The TIME VALUES object is copied from the TIME VALUES field in the B SFRR Active Extended Association ID.
The TIME VALUES object contains the refresh period of the PLR node, and it is used to generate periodic refreshes.
The TIME VALUES object carried in the B SFRR Active Extended Association ID matches the one that would have been exchanged in a full Path message sent to the MP after the failure when no Summary FRR procedures are used.
The tunnel sender address field in the SENDER TEMPLATE object is copied from the tunnel sender address field of the B SFRR Active Extended Association ID.
The Explicit Route Object (ERO) is modified as per Section 6.4.4 of [RFC4090].
Once the above modifications are completed, the MP node performs merge processing as per [RFC4090].
Any previously received MESSAGE IDs from the PLR node are activated.
The MP is allowed to send Srefresh messages containing the specific Message Identifier(s) for the states to be refreshed.
A failure during merge processing of any individual rerouted LSP MUST result in an RSVP PathErr message.
An individual RSVP Resv message for each successfully merged Summary FRR LSP is not signaled.
The MP node SHOULD immediately use summary refresh procedures to refresh the protected LSP Resv state.
The refreshing of Summary FRR Active LSPs is performed using summary refresh as defined by [RFC2961].
The (Extended) ASSOCIATION object is defined in [RFC4872] with a class number in the form 11bbbbbb,
where b 0 or 1.
This ensures compatibility with nodes that do not provide support, in accordance with the procedures specified in Section 3.10 of [RFC2205] regarding unknown class objects.
Such nodes will ignore the object and forward it without any modification.
This document updates an existing RSVP object   the Extended ASSOCIATION object as described in Section 3.
Thus, in the event of the interception of a signaling message, slightly more information could be deduced about the state of the network than was previously the case.
When using the procedures defined in this document, FRR signaling for rerouting of the states of one or more protected LSPs onto the bypass tunnel can be performed on a group of protected LSPs with a single RSVP message.
This allows an intruder to potentially impact and manipulate a set of protected LSPs that are assigned to the same bypass tunnel group.
Note that such an attack is possible even without the mechanisms defined in this document, albeit at an extra cost resulting from the excessive per LSP signaling that will occur.
Existing mechanisms for maintaining the integrity and authenticity of RSVP messages [RFC2747] can be applied.
Other considerations mentioned in [RFC4090] and [RFC5920] also apply.
IANA Considerations IANA maintains the "Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry.
The "Association Type" subregistry is included in this registry.
This registry has been updated with the new Association Types for the Extended ASSOCIATION objects defined in this document as follows:
