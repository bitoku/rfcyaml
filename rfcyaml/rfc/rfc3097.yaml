  - "Abstract\n   This memo resolves a duplication in the assignment of RSVP Message\n
    \  Types, by changing the Message Types assigned by RFC 2747 to\n   Challenge
    and Integrity Response messages.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   RFC 2747 (\"RSVP Cryptographic Authentication\") [RFC2747]
    assigns RSVP\n   Message Type 12 to an Integrity Response message, while RFC 2961\n
    \  (\"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions\") [RFC2961] assigns the\n   same
    value to a Bundle message.  This memo resolves the conflict over\n   RSVP Message
    Type 12 by assigning a different value to the Message\n   Type of the Integrity
    Response Message in RFC 2747.  It is believed\n   that the protocol defined by
    RFC 2961 entered use in the field before\n   the RFC's publication and before
    the conflicting Message Type was\n   noticed, and that it may be easier to install
    new software in\n   environments that have deployed the Integrity object than
    in those\n   that have deployed the refresh reduction extension.\n   To simplify
    possible interoperability problems caused by this change,\n   we also assign a
    new value to the Message Type of RFC 2747's\n   Challenge message, to which the
    Integrity Response message is a\n   reply.\n"
  title: 1. Introduction
- contents:
  - "2. Modification\n   Message Types defined in the RSVP Integrity extension [RFC
    2747]\n   shall be changed as follows:\n      o Challenge message has Message
    Type 25.\n      o Integrity Response message has Message Type 25+1.\n"
  title: 2. Modification
- contents:
  - "3. Compatibility\n   Two communicating nodes whose Integrity implementations
    are\n   conformant with this modification will interoperate, using Message\n   Type
    12 for Bundle messages and Message Types 25 and 26 for the\n   Integrity handshake.
    \ A non-conformant implementation of the\n   Integrity extension will not interoperate
    with a conformant\n   implementation (though two non-conformant implementations
    can\n   interoperate as before).\n   There is no possibility of an Integrity handshake
    succeeding\n   accidentally due to this change, since both sides of the handshake\n
    \  use the new numbers or the old numbers.  Furthermore, the Integrity\n   Response
    message includes a 32-bit cookie that must match a cookie in\n   the Challenge
    message, else the challenge will fail.  Finally, a\n   non-conformant implementation
    should never receive a Bundle message\n   that it interprets as an Integrity Response
    message, since RFC 2961\n   requires that Bundle messages be sent only to a Bundle-capable
    node.\n"
