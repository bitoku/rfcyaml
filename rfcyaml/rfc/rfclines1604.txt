Abstract This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing the Frame Relay Service.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
These objects are used when the particular media being used to manage is Frame Relay Service.
At present, this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet standard MIB: frameRelayService (44)
This section provides an overview and background of how to use this MIB and other potential MIBs when managing a Frame Relay Service.
Figure 1 shows the MIB stack that could be followed for managing a Frame Relay Service.
This is only an example and not meant to be inclusive.
Frame Relay MIB Architecture 3.1.
The Frame Relay Service MIB will only manage the Frame Relay portion of the network.
This MIB is based upon the Customer Network Management concepts presented in the document "Service Management Architecture for Virtual Connection Services" [6].
This MIB will NOT be implemented on User Equipment (e.g., DTE), and the Frame Relay DTE MIB (RFC 1315) should be used to manage those devices [8].
Frame Relay Service MIB is intended to be used for Customer Network Management (CNM) of a Frame Relay Network Service.
It provides information that allows end customers to obtain performance monitoring, fault detection, and configuration information about their Frame Relay Service.
It is an implementation decision as to whether this MIB is used to create/delete/modify PVCs and to turn PVCs on or off.
By using this and other related MIBs, a customer's NMS can monitor their PVCs and UNI/NNI logical ports.
Internal aspects of the network (e.g., switching elements, line cards, and network routing tables) are outside the scope of this MIB.
The Customer's NMS will typically access the SNMP proxy agent within the Frame Relay network using SNMP over UDP over IP with IP encapsulated in Frame Relay according to RFC1490/ANSI T1.617 Annex F [7,9].
The customer, thus, has a PVC to the SNMP proxy agent.
Alternate access mechanisms and SNMP agent implementations are possible.
The service capabilities include retrieving information and receiving TRAPs.
It is beyond the scope of this MIB to define managed objects to monitor the physical layer.
Existing physical layer MIBs (e.g., DS1 MIB) and MIB II will be used as possible.
The Frame Relay Service SNMP MIB for CNM will not contain any managed objects to monitor the physical layer.
This MIB primarily addresses Frame Relay PVCs.
This MIB may be extended at a later time to handle Frame Relay SVCs.
This MIB is only used to manage a single Frame Relay Service offering from one network.
This MIB will typically be implemented on a service provider's SNMP proxy agent.
The SNMP proxy agent proxies for all Frame Relay equipment within one service provider's Frame Relay network.
(Other SNMP agent implementations are not precluded.)
Therefore, this MIB models a PVC segment through one Frame Relay Network.
If the customer's PVCs traverse multiple networks, then the customer needs to poll multiple network proxy  agents within each Frame Relay Network to retrieve their end to end view of their service.
See Figure 2 and the Service Management Architecture [6].
Also, since the Frame Relay network is a shared network amongst many Frame Relay subscribers, each subscriber will only have access to their information (e.g., information with respect to their interfaces and PVCs).
Therefore, in order to provide this capability, the Frame Relay PVC CNM proxy agent should be able to support instance level granularity for MIB views.
See the Service Management Architecture.
Frame Relay Service MIB Terminology Access Channel
An access channel generically refers to the DS1/E1 or DS3/E3 based UNI access channel or NNI access channel across which frame relay data transits.
An access channel is the access pathway for a single stream of user data.
the entire T1 line is considered an access channel.
Each access channel is comprised of 24 T1 time slots.
an access channel is any one of 24 channels.
Each access channel is comprised of a single T1 time slot.
an access channel is a grouping of N T1 time slots (NX56/64 Kbps, where N   1 23 T1 Time slots per FT1 Access Channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non consecutive order.
Within a given E1 line, a channel can denote any one of the following:
the entire E1 line is considered a single access channel.
Each access channel is comprised of 31 E1 time slots.
an access channel is any one of 31 channels.
Each access channel is comprised of a single E1 time slot.
an access channel is a grouping of N E1 time slots (NX64 Kbps, where N   1 30 E1 time slots per FE1 access channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non consecutive order.
in 3 Within a given unformatted line, the entire unformatted line is considered an access channel.
Examples include RS 232, V.35, V.36 and X.21 (non  switched).
The data rate of the access channel, expressed in bits/second.
The speed of the user access channel determines how rapidly the end user can inject data into the network.
Bc The Committed Burst Size (Bc) is the maximum amount of subscriber data (expressed in bits) that the network agrees to transfer, under normal conditions, during a time interval Tc.
Be The Excess Burst Size (Be) is the maximum amount of subscriber data (expressed in bits) in excess of Bc that the network will attempt to deliver during the time interval Tc.
This data (Be) is delivered in general with a lower probability than Bc.
The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is the subscriber data rate (expressed in bits/second) that the network commits to deliver under normal network conditions.
CIR is averaged over the time interval Tc (CIR   Bc/Tc).
DLCI Data Link Connection Identifier Logical Port
This term is used to model the Frame Relay "interface" on a device.
NNI Network to Network Interface
A virtual connection that has its end points and bearer capabilities defined at subscription time.
An octet within the 256 bit information field in each E1 frame is defined as a time slot.
Time slots are position sensitive within the 256 bit information field.
Fractional E1 service is provided in contiguous or non  contiguous time slot increments.
An octet within the 192 bit information field in each T1 frame is defined as a time slot.
Time slots are position sensitive within the 192 bit information field.
Fractional T1 service is provided in contiguous or non  contiguous time slot increments.
UNI User to Network Interface N391
Full status (status of all PVCs)
polling counter N392 Error threshold N393 Monitored events count T391 Link integrity verification polling timer
Maximum status enquiry counter 3.3.
Apply MIB II to a Frame Relay Service
Use the System Group to apply to the SNMP proxy agent, since the proxy agent may be monitoring many Frame Relay devices in one network.
System Group applies to only one system.
This group is not instantiated.
ASCII string describing the SNMP proxy agent.
Can be up to 255 characters long.
This field is generally used to indicate the network providers identification and type of service offered.
Unique OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID) for the SNMP proxy agent.
sysUpTime:  Clock in the SNMP proxy agent; TimeTicks in 1/100s of a second.
Elapsed type since the proxy agent came on line.
Contact for the SNMP proxy agent.
ASCII string of up to 255 characters.
sysName:  Domain name of the SNMP proxy agent, for example, acme.com sysLocation:  Location of the SNMP proxy agent.
ASCII string of up to 255 characters.
sysServices:  Services of the managed device.
The value "2", which implies that the Frame Relay network is providing a subnetwork level service, is recommended.
This specifies how the Interfaces Group defined in MIB II shall be used for the management of Frame Relay based interfaces, and in conjunction with the Frame Relay Service MIB module.
This memo assumes the interpretation of the evolution of the Interfaces group to be in accordance with: "The interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's interfaces.
Each sub layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is considered an interface."
Thus, the ifTable allows the following Frame Relay based interfaces to be represented as table entries: Frame Relay interfaces in the Frame Relay equipment (e.g., switches, routers or networks) with Frame Relay interfaces.
This level is concerned with generic frame counts and not with individual virtual connections.
In accordance with the guidelines of ifTable, frame counts per virtual connection are not covered by ifTable, and are considered interface specific and covered in the Frame Relay Service MIB module.
In order to interrelate the ifEntries properly, the Interfaces Stack Group shall be supported.
Some specific interpretations of ifTable for Frame Relay follow.
Each Frame Relay port is represented by an ifEntry.
ASCII string describing the UNI/NNI logical port.
Can be up to 255 characters long.
The value allocated for Frame Relay Service is equal to 44.
This could be the speed of the logical port and not the access rate.
Actual user information transfer rate (i.e., access rate) of the UNI or NNI logical port in bits per second (this is not the clocking speed).
For example, it is 1,536,000 bits per second for a DS1 based UNI/NNI logical port and 1,984,000 bits per second for an E1 based UNI/NNI logical port.
The primary address for this logical port assigned by the Frame Relay interface provider.
An octet string of zero length if no address is used for this logical port.
The desired administrative status of the frame relay logical port.
The current operational status of the Frame Relay UNI or NNI logical port.
The elapsed time since the last re initialization of the logical port.
The value of sysUpTime at the time the logical port entered its current operational state.
If the current state was entered prior to the last re initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
The number of received octets.
This counter only counts octets from the beginning of the frame relay header field to the end of user data.
The number of received unerrored, unicast frames.
The number of received frames discarded.
Possible reasons are as follows: policing, congestion.
Possible errors can be the following: the frame relay frames were too long or were too short, the frames had an invalid or unrecognized DLCI values, or incorrect header values.
The number of packets discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
For Frame Relay Service interfaces, this counter will always be zero.
The number of transmitted octets.
This counter only counts octets from the beginning of the frame relay header field to the end of user data.
The number of frames sent.
The number of frames discarded in the egress direction.
Possible reasons are as follows:  policing, congestion.
The number of frames discarded in the egress direction, because of errors.
Possible reason is transmit underruns.
This variable is not applicable for Frame Relay Service interfaces, therefore, this variable contains a zero length string.
The number of received unerrored, multicast frames.
This variable is not applicable for Frame Relay Service interfaces, therefore, this counter is always zero.
The number of sent unerrored, multicast frames.
This variable is not applicable for Frame Relay Service interfaces, therefore, this counter is always zero.
The number of received octets.
This counter only counts octets from the beginning of the frame relay header field to the end of user data.
The number of transmitted octets.
This counter only counts octets from the beginning of the frame relay header field to the end of user data.
The value of this object is implementation specific for Frame Relay logical ports.
If the user data rate is less than 1 Mbps, then this value is zero.
Frame Relay Network Service interfaces support the Interface Stack Group.
Frame Relay Network Service interfaces do not support any other groups or objects in the Interfaces group of MIB II.
Also, supporting the SNMP Group of MIB II is an implementation choice.

This table is used to identify the traffic parameters   for a bi directional PVC segment end point, and it also   provides statistics for a PVC segment   end point.
A PVC segment end point is identified by a UNI/NNI   logical port index value and DLCI index value.
If the Frame Relay service provider allows   the Frame Relay CNM subscriber to create, modify   or delete PVCs using SNMP, then this table is used to identify   and reserve   the requested traffic parameters of each   PVC segment end point.
The Connection table   is used to "connect" the end points together.
Not all implementations will support the   capability of creating/modifying/deleting   PVCs using SNMP as a feature of Frame Relay   CNM service.
Uni directional PVCs are modeled with zero   valued traffic parameters in one of the   directions (In or Out direction) in this table.

This table has read create access and   is used to associate PVC end points   together as belonging to one connection.
The frPVCConnectIndex is used to associate   all the bi directional flows.
Not all implementations will support the   capability of creating/modifying/deleting   PVCs using SNMP as a feature of Frame Relay   CNM service.

For example, the Frame Relay PVC Connection Group   models a bi directional
, point to point PVC segment   as one entry in this table.
> from low to high PVC flow
<< from high to low PVC flow
The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical   ordering of a PVC segment's endpoints for representation   in this table.
That is, the endpoint with the lower value   of ifIndex is termed 'low', while the opposite endpoint   of the segment is termed 'high'.
This terminology is to provide directional information;   for example
the frPVCConnectL2hOperStatus and   frPVCConnectH2lOperStatus as illustrated above.
If the Frame Relay Connection table is used to model   a unidirectional PVC, then one direction (either from low to high   or from high to low) has its Operational Status equal to down.
A PVC segment is a portion of a PVC   that traverses one Frame Relay Network, and   a PVC segment is identified   by its two end points (UNI/NNI logical port index   value and DLCI index value)   through one Frame Relay Network.

the corresponding/associated entries in the frPVCEndptTable have their frPVCEndptRowStatus object set to `active'), the frPVCConnectAdminStatus object may be set to `active' to turn on the PVC segment connection."

} MAX ACCESS  read only STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"The value of this object identifies the current operational status of the PVC segment connection in one direction; (i.e., in the low to high direction).
The active state means it is currently operational; the inactive state means it is currently not operational; the testing state means it is currently undergoing a test; the unknown state means the status of it currently can not be determined.
This value affects the PVC status indicated across the ingress NNI/UNI (low side) of the PVC segment."

RowStatus MAX ACCESS  read create
The status of this entry in the frPVCConnectTable.
This variable is used to create new connections for the PVC end points and to change existing connections of the PVC end  points.
This object must be initially set to `createAndWait'.
In this state, the agent checks the parameters in the associated entries in the frPVCEndptTable to verify that the PVC end points can be connected (i.e., the In parameters for one PVC end point are equal to the Out parameters for the other PVC end point).
This object can not be set to `active' unless the following columnar object exist in this row: frPVCConnectAdminStatus.
The agent also supplies the associated value of frPVCConnectIndex for the frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier instances.
To turn on a PVC segment connection, the frPVCConnectAdminStatus is set to `active'."

Accounting on a PVC basis
Accounting on an Interface/Logical Port basis
The Accounting on a Frame Relay PVC basis Group
