- title: Default Value for IP MTU over ATM AAL5
  contents:
  - "Default Value for IP MTU over ATM AAL5\n   Protocols in wide use throughout the\
    \ Internet, such as the Network\n   File System (NFS), currently use large frame\
    \ sizes (e.g. 8 KB).\n   Empirical evidence with various applications over the\
    \ Transmission\n   Control Protocol (TCP) indicates that larger Maximum Transmission\n\
    \   Unit (MTU) sizes for the Internet Protocol (IP) tend to give better\n   performance.\
    \  Fragmentation of IP datagrams is known to be highly\n   undesirable. [KM87]\
    \ It is desirable to reduce fragmentation in the\n   network and thereby enhance\
    \ performance by having the IP Maximum\n   Transmission Unit (MTU) for AAL5 be\
    \ reasonably large.  NFS defaults\n   to an 8192 byte frame size.  Allowing for\
    \ RPC/XDR, UDP, IP, and LLC\n   headers, NFS would prefer a default MTU of at\
    \ least 8300 octets.\n   Routers can sometimes perform better with larger packet\
    \ sizes because\n   most of the performance costs in routers relate to \"packets\
    \ handled\"\n   rather than \"bytes transferred\".  So there are a number of good\n\
    \   reasons to have a reasonably large default MTU value for IP over ATM\n   AAL5.\n\
    \   RFC 1209 specifies the IP MTU over SMDS to be 9180 octets, which is\n   larger\
    \ than 8300 octets but still in the same range. [RFC-1209] There\n   is no good\
    \ reason for the default MTU of IP over ATM AAL5 to be\n   different from IP over\
    \ SMDS, given that they will be the same\n   magnitude.  Having the two be the\
    \ same size will be helpful in\n   interoperability and will also help reduce\
    \ incidence of IP\n   fragmentation.\n   Therefore, the default IP MTU for use\
    \ with ATM AAL5 shall be 9180\n   octets.  All implementations compliant and conformant\
    \ with this\n   specification shall support at least the default IP MTU value\
    \ for use\n   over ATM AAL5.\n"

  contents:
  - "Permanent Virtual Circuits\n   Implementations which only support Permanent Virtual\
    \ Circuits (PVCs)\n   will (by definition) not implement any ATM signalling protocol.\
    \  Such\n   implementations shall use the default IP MTU value of 9180 octets\n\
    \   unless both parties have agreed in advance to use some other IP MTU\n   value\
    \ via some mechanism not specified here.\n"
- title: Switched Virtual Circuits
  contents:
  - "Switched Virtual Circuits\n   Implementations that support Switched Virtual Circuits\
    \ (SVCs) MUST\n   attempt to negotiate the AAL CPCS-SDU size using the ATM signalling\n\
    \   protocol.  The industry standard ATM signalling protocol uses two\n   different\
    \ parts of the Information Element named \"AAL Parameters\" to\n   exchange information\
    \ on the MTU over the ATM circuit being setup\n   [ATMF93a].  The Forward Maximum\
    \ CPCS-SDU Size field contains the\n   value over the path from the calling party\
    \ to the called party.  The\n   Backwards Maximum CPCS-SDU Size Identifier field\
    \ contains the value\n   over the path from the called party to the calling party.\
    \  The ATM\n   Forum specifies the valid values of this identifier as 1 to 65535\n\
    \   inclusive.  Note that the ATM Forum's User-to-Network-Interface (UNI)\n  \
    \ signalling permits the MTU in one direction to be different from the\n   MTU\
    \ in the opposite direction, so the Forward Maximum CPCS-SDU Size\n   Identifier\
    \ might have a different value from the Backwards Maximum\n   CPCS-SDU Size Identifier\
    \ on the same connection.\n   If the calling party wishes to use the default MTU\
    \ it shall still\n   include the \"AAL Parameters\" information element with the\
    \ default\n   values for the Maximum CPCS-SDU Size as part of the SETUP message\
    \ of\n   the ATM signalling protocol [ATMF93b].  If the calling party desires\n\
    \   to use a different value than the default, it shall include the \"AAL\n  \
    \ Parameters\" information element with the desired value for the\n   Maximum\
    \ CPCS-SDU Size as part of the SETUP message of the ATM\n   Signalling Protocol.\
    \  The called party will respond using the same\n   information elements and identifiers\
    \ in its CONNECT message response\n   [ATMF93c].\n   If the called party receives\
    \ a SETUP message containing the \"Maximum\n   CPCS-SDU Size\" in the AAL Parameters\
    \ information element, it shall\n   handle the Forward and Backward Maximum CPCS-SDU\
    \ Size Identifier as\n   follows:\n    a) If it is able to accept the ATM MTU\
    \ values proposed by the\n       SETUP message, it shall include an AAL Parameters\
    \ information\n       element in its response.  The Forward and Backwards Maximum\n\
    \       CPCS-SDU Size fields shall be present and their values shall be\n    \
    \   equal to the corresponding values in the SETUP message.\n    b) If it wishes\
    \ a smaller ATM MTU size than that proposed, then\n       it shall set the values\
    \ of the Maximum CPCS-SDU Size in the AAL\n       Parameters information elements\
    \ equal to the desired value in the\n       CONNECT message responding to the\
    \ original SETUP message.\n    c) If the calling endpoint receives a CONNECT message\
    \ that does\n       not contain the AAL Parameters Information Element, but the\n\
    \       corresponding SETUP message did contain the AAL Parameters\n       Information\
    \ Telement (including the forward and backward CPCS-SDU\n       Size fields),\
    \ it shall clear the call with cause \"AAL Parameters\n       cannot be supported\"\
    .\n    d) If either endpoint receives a STATUS message with cause\n       \"Information\
    \ Element Non-existent or Not Implemented\" or cause\n       \"\"Access Information\
    \ Discarded\", and with a diagnostic field\n       indicating the AAL Parameters\
    \ Information Element identifier, it\n       shall clear the call with cause \"\
    AAL Parameters cannot be\n       supported.\"\n    e) If either endpoint receives\
    \ CPCS-SDUs in excess of the\n       negotiated MTU size, it may use IP fragmentation\
    \ or may clear the\n       call with cause \"AAL Parameters cannot be supported\"\
    .  In this\n       case, an error has occurred either due to a fault in an end\n\
    \       system or in the ATM network.  The error should be noted by ATM\n    \
    \   network management for human examination and intervention.\n   If the called\
    \ endpoint incorrectly includes the Forward and Backward\n   Maximum CPCS-SDU\
    \ Size fields in the CONNECT messages (e.g.  because\n   the original SETUP message\
    \ did not include these fields) or it sets\n   these fields to an invalid value,\
    \ then the calling party shall clear\n   the call with cause \"Invalid Information\
    \ Element Contents\".\n"
- title: Path MTU Discovery Required
  contents:
  - "Path MTU Discovery Required\n   The Path MTU Discovery mechanism is an Internet\
    \ Standard [RFC-1191]\n   and is an important mechanism for reducing IP fragmentation\
    \ in the\n   Internet.  This mechanism is particularly important because new\n\
    \   subnet ATM uses a default MTU sizes significantly different from\n   older\
    \ subnet technologies such as Ethernet and FDDI.\n   In order to ensure good performance\
    \ throughout the Internet and also\n   to permit IP to take full advantage of\
    \ the potentially larger IP\n   datagram sizes supported by ATM, all routers implementations\
    \ that\n   comply or conform with this specification must also implement the IP\n\
    \   Path MTU Discovery mechanism as defined in RFC-1191 and clarified by\n   RFC-1435.\
    \  Host implementations should implement the IP Path MTU\n   Discovery mechanism\
    \ as defined in RFC-1191.\n"
- title: Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "Applicability Statement\n   The Multiprotocol Encapsulation over ATM AAL5 defined\
    \ in RFC-1483 is\n   not specific to any model of IP and ATM interaction. [RFC-1483]\n\
    \   Similarly, this specification is general enough to apply to all\n   models\
    \ for use of IP over ATM AAL5.  Use of this specification is\n   recommended for\
    \ all implementatons of IP over ATM AAL5 in order to\n   increase interoperability\
    \ and performance.  This specification does\n   not conflict with the Classical\
    \ IP over ATM specification and may be\n   used as a conforming extension to that\
    \ specification.  [RFC-1577]\n   Applicability of this draft is not limited to\
    \ the Classical IP over\n   ATM model.\n"
