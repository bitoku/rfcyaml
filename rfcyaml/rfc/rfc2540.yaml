- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is a replicated hierarchical\
    \ distributed\n   database system [RFC 1034, 1035] that can provide highly available\n\
    \   service.  It provides the operational basis for Internet host name to\n  \
    \ address translation, automatic SMTP mail routing, and other basic\n   Internet\
    \ functions.  The DNS has been extended as described in [RFC\n   2535] to permit\
    \ the general storage of public cryptographic keys in\n   the DNS and to enable\
    \ the authentication of information retrieved\n   from the DNS though digital\
    \ signatures.\n   The DNS was not originally designed for storage of information\n\
    \   outside of the active zones and authoritative master files that are\n   part\
    \ of the connected DNS.  However there may be cases where this is\n   useful,\
    \ particularly in connection with archived security\n   information.\n"
- title: 2. General Format
  contents:
  - "2. General Format\n   The formats used for detached Domain Name System (DNS)\
    \ information\n   are similar to those used for connected DNS information. The\
    \ primary\n   difference is that elements of the connected DNS system (unless\
    \ they\n   are an authoritative server for the zone containing the information)\n\
    \   are required to count down the Time To Live (TTL) associated with\n   each\
    \ DNS Resource Record (RR) and discard them (possibly fetching a\n   fresh copy)\
    \ when the TTL reaches zero.  In contrast to this, detached\n   information may\
    \ be stored in a off-line file, where it can not be\n   updated, and perhaps used\
    \ to authenticate historic data or it might\n   be received via non-DNS protocols\
    \ long after it was retrieved from\n   the DNS.  Therefore, it is not practical\
    \ to count down detached DNS\n   information TTL and it may be necessary to keep\
    \ the data beyond the\n   point where the TTL (which is defined as an unsigned\
    \ field) would\n   underflow.  To preserve information as to the freshness of\
    \ this\n   detached data, it is accompanied by its retrieval time.\n   Whatever\
    \ retrieves the information from the DNS must associate this\n   retrieval time\
    \ with it.  The retrieval time remains fixed thereafter.\n   When the current\
    \ time minus the retrieval time exceeds the TTL for\n   any particular detached\
    \ RR, it is no longer a valid copy within the\n   normal connected DNS scheme.\
    \  This may make it invalid in context for\n   some detached purposes as well.\
    \  If the RR is a SIG (signature) RR it\n   also has an expiration time.  Regardless\
    \ of the TTL, it and any RRs\n   it signs can not be considered authenticated\
    \ after the signature\n   expiration time.\n"

    \ 1 January 1970, GMT,\n       ignoring leap seconds, in network (big-endian)\
    \ order.  Note that\n       this time can not be before the initial proposal of\
    \ this\n       standard.  Therefore, the initial byte of an actual retrieval\n\
    \       time, considered as a 32 bit unsigned quantity, would always be\n    \
    \   larger than 20 hex.  The end of detached DNS information is\n       indicated\
    \ by a \"retrieval time\" field initial byte equal to 0x20.\n       Use of a \"\
    retrieval time\" field with a leading unsigned byte of\n       zero indicates\
    \ a 64 bit (actually 8 leading zero bits plus a 56\n       bit quantity).  This\
    \ 64 bit format will be required when\n       retrieval time is larger than 0xFFFFFFFF,\
    \ which is some time in\n       the year 2106.  The meaning of retrieval times\
    \ with an initial\n       byte between 0x01 and 0x1F is reserved (see section\
    \ 5).\n       Retrieval times will not generally be 32 bit aligned with respect\n\
    \       to each other due to the variable length nature of RRs.\n   RR count -\
    \ an unsigned integer number (with bytes in network order)\n       of following\
    \ resource records retrieved at the preceding\n       retrieval time.\n   Resource\
    \ Records - the actual data which is in the same format as if\n       it were\
    \ being transmitted in a DNS response.  In particular, name\n       compression\
    \ via pointers is permitted with the origin at the\n       beginning of the particular\
    \ detached information data section,\n       just after the RR count.\n"
- title: 2.2. Text Format
  contents:
  - "2.2. Text Format\n   The standard text format for detached DNS information is\
    \ as\n   prescribed for zone master files [RFC 1035] except that the $INCLUDE\n\
    \   control entry is prohibited and the new $DATE entry is required\n   (unless\
    \ the information set is empty). $DATE is followed by the date\n   and time that\
    \ the following information was obtained from the DNS\n   system as described\
    \ for retrieval time in section 2.1 above.  It is\n   in the text format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\
    \ where YYYY is the year (which may\n   be more than four digits to cover years\
    \ after 9999), the first MM is\n   the month number (01-12), DD is the day of\
    \ the month (01-31), HH is\n   the hour in 24 hours notation (00-23), the second\
    \ MM is the minute\n   (00-59), and SS is the second (00-59).  Thus a $DATE must\
    \ appear\n   before the first RR and at every change in retrieval time through\
    \ the\n   detached information.\n"
- title: 3. Usage Example
  contents:
  - "3. Usage Example\n   A document might be authenticated by a key retrieved from\
    \ the DNS in\n   a KEY resource record (RR).  To later prove the authenticity\
    \ of this\n   document, it would be desirable to preserve the KEY RR for that\n\
    \   public key, the SIG RR signing that KEY RR, the KEY RR for the key\n   used\
    \ to authenticate that SIG, and so on through SIG and KEY RRs\n   until a well\
    \ known trusted key is reached, perhaps the key for the\n   DNS root or some third\
    \ party authentication service. (In some cases\n   these KEY RRs will actually\
    \ be sets of KEY RRs with the same owner\n   and class because SIGs actually sign\
    \ such record sets.)\n   This information could be preserved as a set of detached\
    \ DNS\n   information blocks.\n"
- title: 4. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. IANA Considerations\n   Allocation of meanings to retrieval time fields with\
    \ a initial byte\n   of between 0x01 and 0x1F requires an IETF consensus.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The entirety of this document concerns a means\
    \ to represent detached\n   DNS information.  Such detached resource records may\
    \ be security\n   relevant and/or secured information as described in [RFC 2535].\
    \  The\n   detached format provides no overall security for sets of detached\n\
    \   information or for the association between retrieval time and\n   information.\
    \  This can be provided by wrapping the detached\n   information format with some\
    \ other form of signature.  However, if\n   the detached information is accompanied\
    \ by SIG RRs, its validity\n   period is indicated in those SIG RRs so the retrieval\
    \ time might be\n   of secondary importance.\n"
