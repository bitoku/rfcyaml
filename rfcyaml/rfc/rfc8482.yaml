  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) specifies a query type (QTYPE)
    \"ANY\".\n   The operator of an authoritative DNS server might choose not to\n
    \  respond to such queries for reasons of local policy, motivated by\n   security,
    performance, or other reasons.\n   The DNS specification [RFC1034] [RFC1035] does
    not include specific\n   guidance for the behavior of DNS servers or clients in
    this\n   situation.  This document aims to provide such guidance.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document uses terminology specific to the Domain
      Name System\n   (DNS), descriptions of which can be found in [RFC8499].\n   [RFC1035]
      defined type 255 to be \"*\".  However, DNS implementations\n   commonly use
      the keyword \"ANY\" to refer to that type code; this\n   document follows that
      common usage.\n   In this document, \"ANY query\" refers to a DNS meta-query
      with\n   QTYPE=ANY.  An \"ANY response\" is a response to such a query.\n   In
      this document, \"conventional ANY response\" means an ANY response\n   that
      is constructed in accordance with the algorithm documented in\n   Section 4.3.2
      of [RFC1034] and specifically without implementing any\n   of the mechanisms
      described in this document.\n   In an exchange of DNS messages between two hosts,
      this document\n   refers to the host sending a DNS request as the \"initiator\"
      and the\n   host sending a DNS response as the \"responder\".\n   The key words
      \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",
      \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119]
      [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
    title: 1.1.  Terminology
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Motivations for Use of ANY Queries\n   ANY queries are legitimately used
    for debugging and checking the\n   state of a DNS server for a particular name.\n
    \  ANY queries are sometimes used as an attempt to reduce the number of\n   queries
    needed to get information, e.g., to obtain MX, A, and AAAA\n   resource record
    sets (RRsets) for a mail domain in a single query.\n   However, there is no documented
    guidance available for this use case,\n   and some implementations have been observed
    not to function as their\n   developers expected.  If implementers assume that
    an ANY query will\n   ultimately be received by an authoritative server and will
    fetch all\n   existing RRsets, they should include a fallback mechanism to use
    when\n   that does not happen.\n   ANY queries are frequently used to exploit
    the amplification\n   potential of DNS servers and resolvers using spoofed source
    addresses\n   and UDP transport (see [RFC5358]).  Having the ability to return\n
    \  small responses to such queries makes DNS servers less attractive\n   amplifiers.\n
    \  ANY queries are sometimes used to help mine authoritative-only DNS\n   servers
    for zone data, since they are expected to return all RRsets\n   for a particular
    query name.  If DNS operators prefer to reduce the\n   potential for information
    leaks, they might choose not to send large\n   ANY responses.\n   Some authoritative-only
    DNS server implementations require additional\n   processing in order to send
    a conventional ANY response; avoiding\n   that processing expense might be desirable.\n"
  title: 2.  Motivations for Use of ANY Queries
- contents:
  - "3.  General Approach\n   This proposal provides a mechanism for an authoritative
    DNS server to\n   signal that conventional ANY queries are not supported for a\n
    \  particular QNAME.  It does so in a way that is both compatible with\n   and
    triggers desirable behavior by unmodified clients (e.g., DNS\n   resolvers).\n
    \  Alternative proposals for dealing with ANY queries have been\n   discussed.
    \ One approach proposes using a new RCODE to signal that an\n   authoritative
    server did not answer ANY queries in the standard way.\n   This approach was found
    to have an undesirable effect on both\n   resolvers and authoritative-only servers;
    resolvers receiving an\n   unknown RCODE would resend the same query to all available\n
    \  authoritative servers rather than suppress future ANY queries for the\n   same
    QNAME.\n   The proposal described in this document avoids that outcome by\n   returning
    a non-empty RRset in the ANY response, which provides\n   resolvers with something
    to cache and effectively suppresses repeat\n   queries to the same or different
    authoritative DNS servers.\n"
  title: 3.  General Approach
- contents:
  - "4.  Behavior of DNS Responders\n   Below are the three different modes of behavior
    by DNS responders\n   when processing queries with QNAMEs that exist, QCLASS=IN,
    and\n   QTYPE=ANY.  Operators and implementers are free to choose whichever\n
    \  mechanism best suits their environment.\n   1.  A DNS responder can choose
    to select one or a larger subset of\n       the available RRsets at the QNAME.\n
    \  2.  A DNS responder can return a synthesized HINFO resource record.\n       See
    Section 6 for discussion of the use of HINFO.\n   3.  A resolver can try to give
    out the most likely records the\n       requester wants.  This is not always possible,
    and the result\n       might well be a large response.\n   Except as described
    below in this section, the DNS responder MUST\n   follow the standard algorithms
    when constructing a response.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Answer with a Subset of Available RRsets\n   A DNS responder that receives
      an ANY query MAY decline to provide a\n   conventional ANY response or MAY instead
      send a response with a\n   single RRset (or a larger subset of available RRsets)
      in the answer\n   section.\n   The RRsets returned in the answer section of
      the response MAY consist\n   of a single RRset owned by the name specified in
      the QNAME.  Where\n   multiple RRsets exist, the responder SHOULD choose a small
      subset of\n   those available to reduce the amplification potential of the\n
      \  response.\n   If the zone is signed, appropriate RRSIG records MUST be included
      in\n   the answer.\n   Note that this mechanism does not provide any signaling
      to indicate\n   to a client that an incomplete subset of the available RRsets
      has\n   been returned.\n"
    title: 4.1.  Answer with a Subset of Available RRsets
  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Answer with a Synthesized HINFO RRset\n   If there is no CNAME present
      at the owner name matching the QNAME,\n   the resource record returned in the
      response MAY instead be\n   synthesized.  In this case, a single HINFO resource
      record SHOULD be\n   returned.  The CPU field of the HINFO RDATA SHOULD be set
      to\n   \"RFC8482\".  The OS field of the HINFO RDATA SHOULD be set to the null\n
      \  string to minimize the size of the response.\n   The TTL encoded for the
      synthesized HINFO resource record SHOULD be\n   chosen by the operator of the
      DNS responder to be large enough to\n   suppress frequent subsequent ANY queries
      from the same initiator with\n   the same QNAME, understanding that a TTL that
      is too long might make\n   policy changes relating to ANY queries difficult
      to change in the\n   future.  The specific value used SHOULD be configurable
      by the\n   operator of the nameserver according to local policy, based on the\n
      \  familiar considerations involved in choosing a TTL value for any\n   resource
      record in any zone.\n   If the DNS query includes DO=1 and the QNAME corresponds
      to a zone\n   that is known by the responder to be signed, a valid RRSIG for
      the\n   RRsets in the answer (or authority if answer is empty) section MUST\n
      \  be returned.  In the case of DO=0, the RRSIG SHOULD be omitted.\n   A system
      that receives an HINFO response SHOULD NOT infer that the\n   response was generated
      according to this specification and apply any\n   special processing of the
      response because, in general, it is not\n   possible to tell with certainty
      whether the HINFO RRset received was\n   synthesized.  In particular, systems
      SHOULD NOT rely upon the HINFO\n   RDATA described in this section to distinguish
      between synthesized\n   and non-synthesized HINFO RRsets.\n"

    - "4.3.  Answer with Best Guess as to Intention\n   In some cases, it is possible
      to guess what the initiator wants in\n   the answer (but not always).  Some
      implementations have implemented\n   the spirit of this document by returning
      all RRsets of RRTYPE CNAME,\n   MX, A, and AAAA that are present at the owner
      name while suppressing\n   others.  This heuristic seems to work well in practice;
      it satisfies\n   the needs of some applications whilst suppressing other RRsets
      such\n   as TXT and DNSKEY that can often contribute to large responses.\n   Whilst
      some applications may be satisfied by this behavior, the\n   resulting responses
      in the general case are larger than in the\n   approaches described in Sections
      4.1 and 4.2.\n   As before, if the zone is signed and the DO bit is set on the\n
      \  corresponding query, an RRSIG RRset MUST be included in the response.\n"

    - "4.4.  Transport Considerations\n   A DNS responder MAY behave differently when
      processing ANY queries\n   received over different transports, e.g., by providing
      a conventional\n   ANY response over TCP whilst using one of the other mechanisms\n
      \  specified in this document in the case where a query was received\n   using
      UDP.\n   Implementers MAY provide configuration options to allow operators to\n
      \  specify different behavior over different transports.\n"

  - "5.  Behavior of DNS Initiators\n   A DNS initiator that sends a query with QTYPE=ANY
    and receives a\n   response containing an HINFO resource record or a single RRset,
    as\n   described in Section 4, MAY cache the response in the normal way.\n   Such
    cached resource records SHOULD be retained in the cache\n   following normal caching
    semantics, as with any other response\n   received from a DNS responder.\n   A
    DNS initiator MAY suppress queries with QTYPE=ANY in the event that\n   the local
    cache contains a matching HINFO resource record with the\n   CPU field of the
    HINFO RDATA, as described in Section 4.  A DNS\n   initiator MAY instead respond
    to such queries with the contents of\n   the local cache in the usual way.\n"
  title: 5.  Behavior of DNS Initiators
- contents:
  - "6.  HINFO Considerations\n   It is possible that the synthesized HINFO RRset
    in an ANY response,\n   once cached by the initiator, might suppress subsequent
    queries from\n   the same initiator with QTYPE=HINFO.  Thus, the use of HINFO
    in this\n   proposal would effectively mask the HINFO RRset present in the zone.\n
    \  Operators of authoritative servers who serve zones that rely upon\n   conventional
    use of the HINFO RRTYPE SHOULD sensibly choose the\n   \"single RRset\" method
    described in this document or select another\n   type.\n   The HINFO RRTYPE is
    believed to be rarely used in the DNS at the time\n   of writing, based on observations
    made in passive DNS and at\n   recursive and authoritative DNS servers.\n"

  - "7.  Updates to RFCs 1034 and 1035\n   This document extends the specification
    for processing ANY queries\n   described in Section 4.3.2 of [RFC1034].\n   It
    is important to note that returning a subset of available RRsets\n   when processing
    an ANY query is legitimate and consistent with\n   [RFC1035]; it can be argued
    that ANY does not always mean ALL, as\n   used in Section 3.2.3 of [RFC1035].
    \ The main difference here is that\n   the TC bit SHOULD NOT be set in the response,
    thus indicating that\n   this is not a complete answer.\n   This document describes
    optional behavior for both DNS initiators and\n   responders; implementation of
    the guidance provided by this document\n   is OPTIONAL.\n   RRSIG queries (i.e.,
    queries with QTYPE=RRSIG) are similar to ANY\n   queries in the sense that they
    have the potential to generate large\n   responses as well as extra work for the
    responders that process them,\n   e.g., in the case where signatures are generated
    on the fly.  RRSIG\n   RRsets are not usually obtained using such explicit queries
    but are\n   rather included in the responses for other RRsets that the RRSIGs\n
    \  cover.  This document does not specify appropriate behavior for RRSIG\n   queries;
    however, future such advice might well benefit from\n   consistency with and experience
    with the approaches for ANY queries\n   described here.\n"

  - "8.  Implementation Experience\n   In October 2015, the Cloudflare authoritative
    nameserver\n   implementation implemented the HINFO response.  A few minor problems\n
    \  were reported and have since been resolved.\n   An implementation of the subset-mode
    response to ANY queries was\n   implemented in NSD 4.1 in 2016.\n   An implementation
    of a single RRset response to an ANY query was made\n   for BIND9 by Tony Finch,
    and that functionality was subsequently made\n   available in production releases
    starting in BIND 9.11.\n"
  title: 8.  Implementation Experience
- contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Queries with QTYPE=ANY are frequently observed
    as part of reflection\n   attacks, since a relatively small query can be used
    to elicit a large\n   response.  This is a desirable characteristic if the goal
    is to\n   maximize the amplification potential of a DNS server as part of a\n
    \  volumetric attack.  The ability of a DNS operator to suppress such\n   responses
    on a particular server makes that server a less useful\n   amplifier.\n   The
    optional behavior described in this document to reduce the size\n   of responses
    to queries with QTYPE=ANY is compatible with the use of\n   DNSSEC by both initiator
    and responder.\n"
