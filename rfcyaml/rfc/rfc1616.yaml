  - "1.  Abstract\n   The European research and development community, as represented\
    \ by\n   the member research networks of RARE, has lead the deployment within\n\
    \   the global R&D community of X.400 electronic messaging services, as\n   specified\
    \ in the international recommendations CCITT X.400(1984), for\n   more than five\
    \ years. As a result of providing such services to the\n   European R&D users\
    \ it has become clear that there is an existing and\n   ever increasing demand\
    \ from these users for new and enhanced\n   electronic messaging services and\
    \ product to be used to communicate\n   within the R&D community but within commercial\
    \ service providers and\n   organisations as well.\n   It is also clear that new\
    \ services, such as Multimedia messaging and\n   Secure messaging, and the resulting\
    \ products promise dramatic\n   benefits and opportunities, for not only the R&D\
    \ community but also\n   for the wider commercial, industrial and public communities,\
    \ in terms\n   of facilitating innovative ways of working and living which can\
    \ only\n   enhance the missions and goals of the respective communities. Not\n\
    \   least the establishment of globally pervasive messaging services\n   between\
    \ all users, R&D and commercial, is facilitated by the early\n   adoption of such\
    \ advanced new services. An indication of the\n   importance of such a messaging\
    \ service can be appreciated if one\n   considers that in many organizations (especially\
    \ commercially based)\n   messaging may be the only method to communicate between\
    \ independent\n   organizations due to security considerations and lower layer\
    \ network\n   differences.\n   The Commission of European Communities (CEC) VALUE\
    \ subprogram II has\n   been established to support initiatives relating to the\
    \ development\n   and adaptation of R&D networks in member states.  Amongst other\n\
    \   initiatives the VALUE program supports X.400 initiatives in certain\n   countries.\
    \ VALUE support has so far been limited to X.400(1984)\n   initiatives, as X.400(1984)\
    \ has up until now been the dominating OSI\n   services. However as X.400(1988)\
    \ implementations have started to\n   appear a VALUE funded study of the X.400(1988)\
    \ aspects of messaging\n   and their impact on the R&D community was felt necessary.\
    \ This report\n   is one of the results of that study.\n   The report documents\
    \ the results of a task force on X.400(1988)\n   deployment of the RARE Mails\
    \ and Messaging Work Group during the\n   period from November 1992 until October\
    \ 1993. Open reviews of the\n   report have occurred in the RARE Mail and Messaging\
    \ Work Group and\n   within the IETF X.400ops Working Group.\n   The scope of\
    \ the report is limited to deployment of X.400(1988)\n   services, and as such\
    \ the report does not contain any recommendations\n   on development and deployment\
    \ of Internet RFC 822 / MIME/ PEM related\n   (pilot) services. However, since\
    \ the report shows that both\n   X.400(1988) and RFC 822 / MIME / PEM will be\
    \ developed and used\n   within the European R&D community, such a pilot should\
    \ also\n   considered.  Note: RFC 822 is also known as Internet STD 11.\n   Circulation\
    \ of this report is unlimited. Comments on this report may\n   be sent to the\

  - "2.  Management Summary\n   This document reports the results of study of the\
    \ X.400(1988) aspects\n   of messaging and their impact on the R&D community.\
    \ The study was\n   funded by the CEC under VALUE Subprogram II and has been carried\
    \ out\n   by a task force on the RARE Mail Working Group.  The document is\n \
    \  targeted at technical decision makers as well as those who would fund\n   activity\
    \ in this area.\n   The document presents the existing situation as regards the\n\
    \   predominate messaging technologies within Europe. These are presented\n  \
    \ within the context of a number of large messaging communities that\n   are using\
    \ these technologies:\n    - RFC 822,\n    - X.400(1984),\n    - Mail-11 and\n\
    \    - PC LAN messaging\n   Three major European communities are referenced:\n\
    \    - Commercial service providers\n    - R&D community\n    - Commercial organisations\
    \ using messaging services.\n   The report states the following facts:\n    -\
    \ The resources, human or financial, to operate multiple wide\n      area messaging\
    \ services connecting together independent\n      organisations are high. As such\
    \ it is desirable to try and\n      keep to a minimum the number of such services.\
    \ This statement\n      is true for the R&D community but is also highly likely\
    \ to be\n      valid for the general European industry.\n    - There are two publicly\
    \ available technological standards\n      that can be used by open communities,\
    \ such as the R&D\n      community and public service providers: the X.400(1984\
    \ and\n      1988) recommendations and the Internet RFC 822 / MIME / PEM\n   \
    \   standards.\n    - There is an established very large global user base of\n\
    \      Internet RFC 822 and X.400(1984) messaging services. Both\n      services\
    \ have their own momentum within different parts of\n      the user community,\
    \ both are still developing and growing\n      fast.\n   The report concludes\
    \ that X.400(1988) will be the preferred protocol\n   for inter organizational\
    \ connection for European industry and\n   government and parts of the European\
    \ R&D community.  RFC 822 / MIME /\n   PEM will be the preferred protocol suite\
    \ for inter-organisational\n   connection for the Internet community and, as products\
    \ are already\n   widely available, it is the preferred protocol for parts of\
    \ the\n   European R&D community.\n   The goal of European pervasive messaging\
    \ - incorporating Industry,\n   Government and Academia - would be best accommodated\
    \ and reached by\n   the establishment of a single messaging service.  However\
    \ taking the\n   above into account, this is not feasible, as X.400(84 and 88)\
    \ and RFC\n   822( and MIME) based services will be around for a long time to\
    \ come.\n   To increase the functionality of Wide Area E-mail services there is\
    \ a\n   clear necessity to:\n    - migrate RFC 822 services to a RFC 822 / MIME\
    \ / PEM service.\n      A MIME based service offers more functionality to the\
    \ user\n      than a plain RFC 822 service.\n    - migrate existing X.400 services\
    \ to a X.400(1988) service.\n      Due to the lack of scalability of the X.400(1984)\
    \ service in\n      terms of extra functionality, it will become increasingly\n\
    \      difficult to meet the needs of research users of existing\n      X.400(1984)\
    \ services unless an X.400(1988) service is put\n      into place.\n    - provide\
    \ a transparent gateway between X.400(1988) and RFC\n      822/MIME/PEM. For the\
    \ European R&D community it is essential\n      to have a transparent gateway\
    \ between the X.400(1988) service\n      and the RFC 822 / MIME / PEM service,\
    \ thus ensuring\n      connectivity between these two services with a maximum\n\
    \      functionality.\n   Such a gateway is technically feasible and it is an\
    \ essential part of\n   an unified E-mail service. Without such a standardised\
    \ gateway the\n   overall E-mail service would deteriorate.\n   The lack of open\
    \ standards for the PC LAN messaging systems\n   discourages their use as 'backbone'\
    \ messaging technologies within\n   open communities. However the products that\
    \ these systems deliver to\n   end users ensures that their already large share\
    \ of the messaging\n   market will continue to exist for some time. Thus it is\
    \ also\n   essential that strategies that allow these systems to be 'seamlessly'\n\
    \   integrated within the global messaging community are put in place.\n   Not\
    \ least due to the indications that the main messaging vendors are\n   developing\
    \ X.400(1988) and RFC 822/MIME gateways, a strategy to link\n   these systems\
    \ together via X.400 and RFC 822 should be developed.\n   The report concludes\
    \ with a set of recommendations, the main one\n   being the establishment of a\
    \ X.400(1988) European pilot messaging\n   service for the R&D community. This\
    \ pilot should include the\n   establishment of a transparent gateway service\
    \ between X.400(1988)\n   and RFC 822/MIME. The goal of a European pilot is to\
    \ ensure the\n   successful deployment of a European wide operational X.400(1988)\n\
    \   service that is pervasive and meets the needs of users. By collecting\n  \
    \ together the issues related to the establishment of a European\n   X.400(1988)\
    \ service, this report acts as a focal point and stimulant\n   for discussion\
    \ on this topic within the R&D community. In the report\n   a summary of the benefits\
    \ and problems of each of the above messaging\n   technologies within the context\
    \ of achieving a global messaging\n   service, of which the R&D community is one\
    \ part, is presented.\n   Further the document identifies issues, strategies and\n\
    \   recommendations related to the migration and coexistence of these\n   technologies\
    \ within the scope of mainly the European R&D community\n   but also in relation\
    \ to other messaging communities. A cost / benefit\n   analysis on the establishment\
    \ of a European wide pilot X.400(1988)\n   messaging service is also presented.\
    \ Finally a reading list of\n   references related to this subject has been compiled.\n\
    \   The report does not include any recommendations on development and\n   deployment\
    \ of RFC 822 / MIME / PEM related (pilot) services, as these\n   are outside of\
    \ the scope of the Task Force. However, since the report\n   shows that both X.400(1988)\
    \ and RFC 822 / MIME / PEM will be\n   developed and used within the European\
    \ R&D community, such a pilot\n   should also be considered.\n"

  - "3.  Framework for the report\n   With the belief that user demands for new messaging\
    \ services such as\n   Multimedia and Secure Messaging would develop, the RARE\
    \ community\n   (together with other communities; most notably the Internet\n\
    \   Engineering Task Force (IETF)) has over the preceding years\n   experimented\
    \ in new messaging and related technologies.  Experiments\n   and pilots, have\
    \ been performed in messaging services e.g., as\n   recommended by CCITT X.400(1988)\
    \ and Directory Services based upon\n   the CCITT X.500(1988) recommendations.\n\
    \   The results of such pilots and experiments indicate that it is now\n   opportune\
    \ to commence a pilot X.400(1988) messaging service for the\n   European R&D community.\
    \ The major goals of the pilot being, to\n    - establish a large scale European\
    \ wide pilot messaging\n      service based on X.400(1988).\n    - collaborate\
    \ with and facilitate the commencement of similar\n      pilot services within\
    \ diverse communities; both R&D and non-\n      R&D (e.g., commercial ADMDs and\
    \ PRMDs, etc.); both European\n      and non-European (e.g., North American ,\
    \ Asian, etc.).\n    - encourage and assist the development and deployment of\
    \ a\n      wide variety of commercial and public domain X.400(1988)\n      messaging\
    \ products that meet the user's needs, for instance\n      X.400(1988) products\
    \ such as User Agents (UAs), Message\n      Stores (MSs), Message Transfer Agents\
    \ (MTAs) and gateways\n      between X.400(1988) services and other widespread\
    \ messaging\n      services i.e., RFC 822, Mail-11 and proprietary.\n    - prove\
    \ that such a service and products efficiently meets the\n      existing and expected\
    \ demands for new messaging services by\n      European R&D users. And as such\
    \ determine the steps for a\n      European deployment of an operational X.400(1988)\
    \ messaging\n      service.\n    - determine the needed steps to facilitate migration\
    \ for the\n      existing operational R&D X.400(1984) based messaging service,\n\
    \      as represented by the R&D MHS service (the former COSINE\n      MHS), RFC\
    \ 822 / MIME / PEM based messaging services and the\n      HEPnet / SPAN Mail-11\
    \ based messaging service to an\n      operational X.400(1988) messaging service.\
    \ It is self evident\n      that during such migrations, transition steps must\
    \ be\n      included that allow a period of coexistence, at the highest\n    \
    \  possible service level, between X.400(1988), X.400(1984), RFC\n      822 /\
    \ MIME and HEPnet / SPAN Mail-11 services.\n    - determine the needed steps that\
    \ allow proprietary messaging\n      systems, that are widely deployed within\
    \ the European R&D\n      community to be integrated at as high as possible service\n\
    \      level, by an X.400(1988) infrastructure.\n   This report identifies the\
    \ issues involved in such a pilot service.\n   It is not a concrete proposal for\
    \ such a project but the report\n   discusses advantages and disadvantages, costs\
    \ and enefits and\n   migration issues for deploying a X.400(1988) service. As\
    \ such it is a\n   discussion and feasibility paper on the creation of a large\

    \   R&D community.\n"

- title: 4.1. Messaging services
  contents:
  - "4.1. Messaging services\n   Electronic messaging within Europe can be viewed\
    \ as a number of\n   messaging services communities. Three important communities\
    \ comprise,\n    - Commercial e-mail networks,\n    - Research e-mail networks\
    \ and\n    - PC LAN messaging systems.\n   Commercial e-mail networks are classified\
    \ as either ADMDs or PRMDs.\n   ADMDs and PRMDs are operating in nearly every\
    \ European country.\n    - ADMD services (or public commercial e-mail services)\
    \ are\n      provided by over 50 service providers which have\n      interconnected\
    \ using the X.400(1984) protocols. The topology\n      between these ADMDs, although\
    \ not yet 'mesh', can be stated\n      as progressing quite rapidly to this optimum\
    \ goal. However\n      there is still a way to go before ADMDs provide full European\n\
    \      connectivity.\n    - PRMDs (or private commercial e-mail service providers)\
    \ have\n      interconnected to ADMDs and other PRMDs predominantly using\n  \
    \    the X.400(1984) protocols but also with proprietary\n      protocols.\n \
    \  Research networks are providing messaging services in every European\n   country.\
    \ These R&D service providers are operated as either ADMDs or\n   PRMDs and are\
    \ using both X.400(1984) protocols and Internet RFC 822\n   protocols to connect\
    \ to each other.\n   Moreover, there are also large R&D communities (i.e., HEPnet\
    \ and\n   SPAN) using proprietary protocols (i.e., DECnet Phase IV and Mail-11)\n\
    \   as their main messaging systems. The DECnet IV based communities are\n   now\
    \ migrating to DECnet Phase V (OSI connectionless protocol stack),\n   which provides\
    \ X.400(1988) (plus X.400(1984)) as a major messaging\n   system.  In general,\
    \ all these services are totally interconnected.\n   As such it is a statement\
    \ of fact that there exists within the\n   European R&D community, two parallel\
    \ interconnected messaging\n   infrastructures based upon X.400(1984) and RFC\
    \ 822. However\n   interconnections between the R&D messaging community and the\
    \ majority\n   of the European commercial service providers use the X.400(1984)\n\
    \   protocols.\n   It is also clear that the commercial world mostly makes inter-\n\
    \   organizational messaging interconnections using the X.400(1984)\n   protocols.\
    \ And also that the commercial messaging world is not as\n   totally interconnected\
    \ as the R&D messaging community.  Finally, for\n   a number of commercial and\
    \ public organisations there is often a\n   mandatory requirement to use X.400\
    \ for messaging interconnections.\n   The usage of PC LAN messaging systems is\
    \ increasing very rapidly\n   within the academic and commercial communities.\
    \ In general, PC LAN\n   messaging services within both communities do not use\
    \ X.400(1984) or\n   RFC 822 messaging systems but systems based upon proprietary\n\
    \   protocols. The PC LAN messaging systems can be considered more as\n   'Islands\
    \ of Messaging' that gateway to the commercial and R&D\n   messaging services\
    \ by using X.400(1984) or RFC 822 gateways. PC LAN\n   messaging systems within\
    \ commercial organisations connect to\n   commercial service providers also via\
    \ proprietary protocols. The PC\n   LAN messaging services, although probably\
    \ comprising the largest\n   number of users, are in general poorly integrated\
    \ with the global\n   messaging service (The Dutch, UK and Italian academic communities\n\
    \   confirm that there appears to be many such 'Islands' of PC LAN\n   messaging\
    \ systems within their networks.).\n"

    \ Requirements' to either support, or exploit, high quality messaging\n   services.\
    \ These requirements are elaborated upon within this chapter.\n"

  - "4.2.1. User Oriented\n   The only thing a user requires is an easy to use, well\
    \ integrated,\n   user interface to electronic mail. Usually the user does not\
    \ care\n   what protocol is used. However there are certain inherent\n   requirements\
    \ to the functionality that can be identified as user\n   requirements. The main\
    \ user requirements identified are:\n   - Distribution Lists (DLs)\n      A widely\
    \ perceived omission from the X.400(1984) recommendations\n      was the lack\
    \ of support of DLs. Distribution lists allow users to\n      enlist themselves\
    \ onto electronic mail expander lists\n      (distribution lists). A message to\
    \ such a distribution list will\n      automatically, and without significant\
    \ delay, be sent on to anyone\n      whose electronic mail address is on that\
    \ list. Such a list can be\n      a public list, that is meant for discussions\
    \ on a specific\n      subject, much like a sort of \"magazine\". However the\
    \ list can also\n      be a \"closed\" list, containing only a selected set of\
    \ people who\n      need to communicate privately, e.g., a project-team.\n   -\
    \ Multinational language and Multimedia support\n      European users have for\
    \ many years been frustrated in their\n      inability to use their national character\
    \ sets when communicating\n      using messaging systems. The problems within\
    \ e-mail systems that\n      were causing this character set frustration are at\
    \ their base the\n      same problem that would get in the way of Multimedia messaging\n\
    \      like:\n         - lack of binary data support\n         - lack of standardised\
    \ encoding schema's\n         - definition of multiple body-parts\n      The enormous\
    \ potential of Multimedia systems and services\n      (especially within the commercial\
    \ community as evidenced by the\n      enormous press publicity and mega-mergers\
    \ positioning companies to\n      exploit this technology but also within the\
    \ government spheres\n      i.e., the U.S.A. Government's 'Information Superhighway'\n\
    \      initiative) has acted as a spur to make rapid progress in solving\n   \
    \   the problems in this area.\n   - White pages Directory Service\n      A white\
    \ pages directory service provides a unique but very basic\n      and important\
    \ service; a way to store and find information about\n      people and resources\
    \ that is analogous to a telephone service's\n      paper based directory i.e.,\
    \ White Pages. User's E-mail addresses\n      can be stored for subsequent retrieval\
    \ by E-mail systems.\n   - EDI\n      EDI today is not extensively used within\
    \ the academic environment.\n      However there is a distinct potential within\
    \ the academic\n      community to reduce costs and improve services with EDI.\
    \ Potential\n      EDI uses could be,\n         - EDI between universities\n \
    \        - EDI between universities and government\n         - EDI between universities\
    \ and lower level educational\n           institutions (e.g., student records)\n\
    \         - Commercial EDI using the Internet as an infrastructure.\n      The\
    \ significance of maintaining end to end integrity (especially\n      security\
    \ aspects) of the EDI messages mandates that no gateways\n      should be used\
    \ between originator and recipient.\n   - Support of Security services\n     \
    \ E-mail as it is currently used is far from secure. To allow for\n      serious\
    \ usage of E-mail security issues need to be addressed,\n      like:\n       \
    \  - integrity; making sure that the message is transferred\n           intact,\
    \ without any changes or additions.\n         - encryption; making sure the message\
    \ content is only\n           decipherable by the intended recipient.\n      \

    \ are authenticated.\n"

  - "4.2.2. Service provider viewpoint\n   The task force believes the following points\
    \ as being the most\n   significant service provider requirements:\n   - Network\
    \ Management\n      This area is still very new, in terms of offering standardised\n\
    \      protocols, services and products for management. However a minimum\n  \
    \    'goal' is to provide for central management functions that will\n      allow\
    \ providers to offer a better quality of service.  There is\n      presently ongoing\
    \ work within the IETF Working Group MADMAN to\n      define SNMP monitoring and\
    \ managing of E-mail systems, gateways\n      and X.500 directory systems. A number\
    \ of management areas that\n      need to be worked upon include: QOS, Service\
    \ Level Agreements\n      (SLAs), Multiple system queue management, Accounting,\
    \ Routing Co-\n      ordination and Message Tracing.\n   - Support of MTA routing\n\
    \      Dynamic routing from MTA to MTA, relieves the necessity to\n      maintain\
    \ large routing tables, especially within a large PRMD, or\n      community of\
    \ PRMDs (like the R&D MHS community).\n   - Address mapping between RFC 822 and\
    \ X.400\n      The widespread use of X.500 or DNS for mapping, allows a reduction\n\
    \      of manpower for centrally co-ordinating globally consistent\n      X.400-to-RFC-822\
    \ mapping tables and distributes the responsibility\n      for updating the mapping\
    \ rules. This should allow mapping rules to\n      change when needed and to be\
    \ available immediately.\n   - UA capabilities registration\n      The use of\
    \ the directory to register UA capabilities for\n      X.400(1988), X.400(1984)\
    \ and RFC 822 / MIME / PEM systems is a\n      very desirable benefit for users\
    \ in terms of speeding the\n      deployment of new messaging services (e.g.,\
    \ Multimedia Messaging).\n"
- title: 4.3. Messaging capabilities
  contents:
  - "4.3. Messaging capabilities\n   Due to the problems of gatewaying within a multi-protocol\
    \ messaging\n   environment, the great majority of R&D E-mail users are reduced\
    \ to\n   using only InterPersonal Messaging (IPM) services based upon the\n  \
    \ exchange of message body parts using CCITT character set IA5 (US\n   ASCII).\n\
    \   Within the R&D community recent work to meet user requirements for\n   non\
    \ ASCII messaging services - as documented above - has resulted in\n   enhancements\
    \ to the messaging services based upon RFC 822 protocols.\n   The enhancements\
    \ provide Multimedia support via the Multipurpose\n   Internet Mail Extensions\
    \ (MIME) and the prospect in the very near\n   future of secure messaging via\
    \ Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM).\n   Deployment of the MIME enhanced RFC 822 based\
    \ services, via\n   distribution of software and the setting up of the needed\n\
    \   organisational structures, has commenced. The PEM enhancements are in\n  \
    \ a large scale pilot phase e.g., VALUE PASSWORD project.\n   In the case of X.400(1984)\
    \ the usage of non ASCII body parts is\n   mostly effected by bilateral agreement\
    \ between recipient and\n   originator, through use of body part 14. In practice\
    \ this restricts\n   the exchange of non ASCII body parts to those cases where\
    \ the\n   recipient and the originator use the same bilateral agreement or else\n\
    \   the originator includes an ASCII message explaining the included\n   content\
    \ type. Besides IPM there is a growing usage of EDI on top of\n   X.400(1984).\n\
    \   With the above X.400(1984) deficiencies in mind, X.400(1988) has been\n  \
    \ specified by the CCITT / ISO to meet new user demands.  X.400(1988)\n   provides\
    \ support for various different body parts, enhanced security\n   features, international\
    \ character set support capabilities and\n   support of X.500 Directory Services.\
    \ Due to the technological\n   potential of these standards to satisfy user needs\
    \ for new messaging\n   services, the R&D community has been experimenting and\
    \ piloting\n   X.400(1988) and X.500(1988) services.  As there is a strong\n \
    \  dependency of X.400(1988) messaging upon X.500(1988) directory\n   services,\
    \ the necessary precondition to supply these user demands is\n   a deployed and\
    \ operational X.500(1988) directory service. Piloting\n   and deployment of the\
    \ X.500(1988) directory service within the R&D\n   community has been successfully\
    \ initiated and co-ordinated by the\n   COSINE and the VALUE PARADISE projects.\n\
    \   Similarly, secure messaging has been addressed by the VALUE PASSWORD\n   project\
    \ and the RARE and IETF communities. Work to solve problems\n   related to directory\
    \ support of X.400(1988) messaging has been\n   pursued within the IETF and RARE.\
    \ The relevant RARE and IETF work\n   groups (e.g., RARE WG-MSG, IETF MHS-DS,\
    \ etc.) have also worked to\n   produce any needed enhancements to the base X.400(1988)\
    \ and\n   X.500(1988) standards.  Last but not least it should not be\n   overlooked\
    \ that X.400(1988), as compared to X.400(1984), provides a\n   comprehensive basis\
    \ for gatewaying to and from RFC 822 / MIME / PEM\n   and PC LAN messaging services.\
    \ To that respect the IETF has defined\n   standards for gatewaying Multimedia\
    \ mail between RFC 822 / MIME / PEM\n   and X.400(1988). As RFC 822 / MIME / PEM\
    \ is now being deployed on the\n   Internet, deployment of X.400(1988) services\
    \ is needed to assure\n   multimedia and secure messaging connectivity for the\
    \ European R&D\n   community.\n"

- title: 5.1. PC LAN E-mail systems
  contents:
  - "5.1. PC LAN E-mail systems\n   Currently the usage of PC LAN E-mail systems is\
    \ mostly for internal\n   communication within an organisation. External connections,\
    \ if\n   present at all, to public service providers or other organisations is\n\
    \   mostly through gateways to X.400(1984) or RFC 822. The use of a PC\n   LAN\
    \ E-mail system in terms of an infrastructure for interconnecting\n   E-mail systems\
    \ of different hues is not common within the Research\n   community.  Recent experience,\
    \ from amongst others the Dutch Research\n   network - SURFnet - [14] and the\
    \ Norwegian Directorate for Public\n   Management - Statskonsult - [18], has shown\
    \ that a number of problems\n   (i.e., limited functionality, high operational\
    \ management cost, etc.)\n   can be expected should these PC LAN E-mail systems\
    \ be used as an E-\n   mail infrastructure. (The use of native X.400 protocols\
    \ for PC LAN\n   E-mail systems would avoid the usage of gateways and would thus\n\
    \   alleviate many of these problems.) A summary of those problems and\n   some\
    \ relevant issues follows:\n   -  Interconnecting heterogeneous PC LAN messaging\
    \ systems\n      One very distinct benefit for E-mail users of all hues is the\n\
    \      potential to integrate heterogeneous PC LAN messaging systems with\n  \
    \    a minimum loss of service (e.g., multimedia services) by\n      connecting\
    \ them via X.400(1988) (or RFC 822/MIME/SMTP).\n      X.400(1988) is already being\
    \ used, or under active development,\n      for connecting together PC LAN messaging\
    \ systems in a number of\n      environments (e.g., Apple Macintoshes, DEC, Microsoft,\
    \ Lotus,\n      etc.). This tendency to gateway PC LAN messaging systems via\n\
    \      X.400(1988) will increase and is one of the benefits that\n      X.400(1988)\
    \ brings to global multiprotocol messaging.\n   - Multimedia and binary data support\n\
    \      The benefit of E-mail systems using these PC LAN systems is that\n    \
    \  the user interfaces are usually well integrated in the users\n      standard\
    \ working environment. Using a proprietary protocol these\n      systems allow\
    \ not only text (ASCII) but also binary, word\n      processor, video, audio and\
    \ other types of files to be\n      transported. To reap the benefits of this\
    \ multimedia / binary data\n      transfer it would normally require that the\
    \ same type of gateway\n      is used by sender and receiver. Transporting these\
    \ same files to\n      another type of PC LAN E-mail system is not possible through\
    \ the\n      current gateways without some information loss. In effect PC LAN\n\
    \      E-mail system's X.400 (or RFC 822) gateways from different vendors\n  \
    \    perform acceptably only for text body parts.  True heterogeneous\n      multimedia\
    \ PC LAN messaging needs gateways to X.400(1988)'s\n      service.\n   - Application\
    \ Programming Interfaces\n      To help solve the problem of portability for Mail\
    \ Enabled\n      Applications Microsoft, Lotus, Novell, XAPIA and X/OPEN have\
    \ been\n      working on a number of standards for the Application Interface to\n\
    \      mail transport protocols (i.e., Mail Application Programming\n      Interface\
    \ - MAPI, Vendor Independent Messaging - VIM, Common Mail\n      Calls - CMC).\
    \ These efforts are structured independent of the\n      existing 'Wide-Area'\
    \ or inter organisational E-mail protocols of\n      X.400(1984) and RFC 822.\
    \ However the MAPI, VIM and CMC efforts,\n      due to their proposers (respectively\
    \ Microsoft, Lotus and X/OPEN),\n      do look like they will provide the stimulant\
    \ to various software\n      developers to develop more portable applications\
    \ plus allow the\n      rich functionality of X.400(1988) to be accessed by these\n\
    \      applications thus reducing the need for gatewaying to X.400(1988).\n  \
    \ - Security\n      As the PC LAN E-mail systems require gateways for connectivity,\n\
    \      they pose a problem with regard to encrypted messages.  Gatewaying\n  \
    \    of secure messages is normally not possible. The gatewaying of\n      secure\
    \ messages is a general problem of gatewaying from one mail\n      system to any\
    \ other system and is not specific to PC LAN E-mail\n      systems.\n   - Directory\
    \ Services\n      To date mostly proprietary directory services have been deployed\n\
    \      that do not match the needs of the users in terms of access\n      controls\
    \ for data, distributed and decentralised across\n      organisations. X.500 based\
    \ services promise solutions to such\n      needs. As a result various suppliers\
    \ have announced support of\n      X.500 directory services for their E-mail products.\
    \ However,\n      should these interfaces be delayed then support of an inter\n\
    \      organisational 'White Pages' services requires either,\n      - directory\
    \ information exchange products (i.e., directory\n        gateways) deployed between\
    \ a proprietary system and an X.500\n        directory system\n      - gateways\
    \ between de-facto market based proprietary\n        standards, such as Retix\
    \ Directory Exchange (DX) or\n        Soft*switch's Directory Synchronisation\
    \ (DS), and X.500\n        protocols\n      - duplicated directories i.e., one\
    \ proprietary and one X.500\n        need to be operated.\n   It should be stressed\
    \ that gatewaying mechanisms and products are\n   often problematic due to the\
    \ lack of an open standard on the\n   proprietary messaging system and or directory\
    \ system. (As an aside it\n   is thus essential to establish an operational X.500\
    \ infrastructure,\n   including E-mail user interfaces that can transparently\
    \ access this\n   Directory Service, as soon as possible.)\n"
- title: 5.2. RFC 822, MIME and PEM services
  contents:
  - "5.2. RFC 822, MIME and PEM services\n   RFC 822 messaging services are widely\
    \ deployed within the R&D\n   community. There is ongoing work to extend RFC 822\
    \ to meet user\n   requirements. Some of these extensions are elaborated upon\
    \ within\n   this chapter.\n   - Distribution lists\n      RFC 822 allows for\
    \ the usage of DLs. Management of DLs is not\n      (yet) standardised.\n   -\
    \ RFC 822 multimedia messaging via MIME\n      With the arrival of MIME, the RFC\
    \ 822 service has an additional\n      protocol standard that addresses Multimedia\
    \ messaging very\n      comprehensively. In terms of user needs, MIME now allows\
    \ messaging\n      body parts to comprise multinational character sets and binary\n\
    \      data. Multi-body part messages are also supported.  One of MIME's\n   \
    \   real strengths, in terms of deployment within the existing RFC 822\n     \
    \ service, is that it achieves its goals by overlaying its services\n      over\
    \ the existing RFC 822 service and thus mandating no changes to\n      the in\
    \ place RFC 822 infrastructure. This greatly simplifies the\n      MIME deployment.\n\
    \   - RFC 822 secure messaging via PEM\n      Just as MIME has brought multimedia\
    \ messaging to RFC 822 services,\n      Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) is bringing\
    \ secure messaging to RFC\n      822 services. PEM also has used the same approach\
    \ as MIME to\n      deploy secure messaging within RFC 822 services; overlay PEM\n\
    \      services over the existing RFC 822 services without requiring\n      changes\
    \ to the RFC 822 infrastructure. PEM brings confidentiality\n      and integrity\
    \ of messages to RFC 822 users. However a number of\n      problems with PEM,\
    \ and X.400(1988) as well, still need to be\n      solved before secure messaging\
    \ can be considered to be an\n      operational service.  These problems are independent\
    \ of the secure\n      messaging protocol (i.e., PEM or X.400(1988)) and deal\
    \ mainly with\n      distribution of secret keys to the end users. There is very\
    \ active\n      work going on within the IETF to solve these problems.\n   - MIME\
    \ and PEM\n      There are still problems for messages that are simultaneously\
    \ a\n      multimedia message, as per MIME, and a secure message, as per PEM.\n\
    \      A PEM encoded MIME message does not allow gatewaying to other\n      messaging\
    \ environments and therefore does not allow any of the\n      features inherent\
    \ within MIME to be exploited along the message\n      path. A MIME message that\
    \ contains PEM encoded body parts can be\n      gatewayed but the integrity of\
    \ the entire message is then not\n      guaranteed. This is a real deficiency\
    \ of both existing approaches\n      as it is essential that users are able to\
    \ simultaneously use\n      multimedia and secure messaging. However, once again,\
    \ the IETF is\n      working very hard on solving these problems and solutions\
    \ can be\n      expected, although the solution of the gatewaying of PEM messages\n\
    \      to other E-mail systems is still unclear.\n   - Dynamic and distributed\
    \ messaging routing via the Domain Name\n     System (DNS)\n      RFC 822 messaging\
    \ benefits greatly by having a dynamic and\n      distributed mechanism to assist\
    \ in message routing i.e., Domain\n      Name System (DNS). With the support of\
    \ the DNS, RFC 822 MTAs are\n      able to directly route to other RFC 822 MTAs\
    \ and thus deliver\n      messages with a minimum of delay. In practice mail often\
    \ still\n      traverses multiple RFC 822 MTAs for a number of reasons e.g., Mail\n\
    \      Hubs provided for users who turn their machine off when they go\n     \
    \ home, Firewall Hubs for security reasons, etc. However it is\n      commonly\
    \ accepted that between RFC 822 mail hubs the delivery of\n      messages is very\
    \ fast. Typically resolution of routing decisions\n      occurs in less than one\
    \ minute and very often within seconds. In\n      general the DNS service is a\
    \ very valuable service that functions\n      well in practice.\n   - Support\
    \ for Character sets\n      Together with the MIME specification for content types,\
    \ an\n      extension for RFC 822 headers was defined that allows for usage of\n\
    \      multiple character sets in names, subject etc. in RFC 822 headers\n   \
    \   [9]. This allows (European) users to use their preferred character\n     \
    \ set to support their language not only in the contents of a\n      message but\
    \ also in the headers.\n   - MIME capable gateways\n      It is clear that to\
    \ provide a seamless service to all users\n      regardless of whether they are\
    \ using RFC 822 or X.400 services, a\n      widely available set of well run and\
    \ standardised RFC 822 to X.400\n      gateways must be in place. For InterPersonal\
    \ Messaging (IPM) based\n      on US ASCII there are already a large number of\
    \ such standardised\n      (i.e., X.400-to-RFC 822) gateways deployed. To ensure\
    \ seamless\n      gatewaying between MIME and X.400 multimedia users, these existing\n\
    \      text based gateways must be either upgraded to or replaced with\n     \
    \ multimedia messaging gateways. A number of proposed Internet\n      standards\
    \ to solve these problems, for both X.400(1984) and\n      X.400(1988) and generated\
    \ within the MIMEMHS work group of the\n      IETF, have been completed [4].\n\
    \   - Access to fax, teletex, telex or physical delivery\n      For the moment,\
    \ there is no standardised way for RFC 822 users to\n      access gateways to\
    \ the above services except by indirect access to\n      X.400(1988) systems (i.e.,\
    \ concatenated gateways of RFC 822 to\n      X.400(1988) and then onwards to the\
    \ appropriate X.400(1988) Access\n      Unit). Although even this indirect method\
    \ would require some\n      further work on standardising mappings between RFC\
    \ 822 addresses\n      and X.400(1992)'s X.121 addresses. As well some experiments\
    \ within\n      the RFC 822 world are occurring on routing fax messages.\n   -\
    \ Operational support\n      Generally, RFC 822 messaging services are delivered\
    \ on a 'best\n      effort' basis and thus service level agreements requesting\n\
    \      stringent response times to operational problems or guaranteed\n      delivery\
    \ times for messages are difficult to agree. This phenomena\n      might be a\
    \ result of the distribution and delegation of authority\n      to organisations\
    \ updating the RFC 822 MTA's routing mechanism\n      i.e., DNS. As a result it\
    \ makes it hard to reach a 'one stop\n      shopping' agreement for RFC 822 messaging\
    \ services.\n   - Notifications\n      The RFC 822 service provides a minimum\
    \ amount of base protocol\n      support for messaging users. It could be argued\
    \ that the RFC 822\n      protocol is simplified by this choice and thus software\
    \ that\n      implements the standard need be smaller in size and easier to\n\
    \      build. However some features e.g., delivery & receipt\n      notifications\
    \ and UA capabilities registration, would be commonly\n      accepted as being\
    \ desirable from a user standpoint and thus\n      desirable extensions to RFC\
    \ 822. Some operational problems\n      relating to reliability could be minimised\
    \ by technology that has\n      a standardised support for positive and negative\
    \ notifications of\n      messages. RFC 822, as compared to X.400, technology\
    \ does not yet\n      support positive notifications (although there is work starting\n\
    \      within the IETF to extend RFC 822 to support delivery\n      notifications).\
    \ However within RFC 821 transport system (i.e.,\n      SMTP) there are standardised\
    \ negative notifications that work\n      well.  Alternatively X.400 technology,\
    \ deployed over TCP/IP (using\n      STD 35, RFC 1006), may help to address the\
    \ lack of adequate\n      service quality - notification support - when using\
    \ E-mail within\n      the Internet.\n   - Portability of RFC 822 products\n \
    \     There are only a few mailbox formats in general use by RFC 822\n      software,\
    \ one being the 'bin/mail' format and the other 'MH'\n      format.  This 'standard'\
    \ mailbox format is a definite benefit for\n      RFC 822 users as it allows them\
    \ to change RFC 822 UAs (e.g.,\n      upgrading to MIME RFC 822 UAs) whilst not\
    \ compromising or\n      converting their existing archived mail, which may comprise\
    \ 1000s\n      of archived messages.\n   - System support for RFC 822 products\n\
    \      Normally, RFC 822 MTAs and UAs come pre-installed on UNIX\n      workstations.\
    \ As a result, users are spared the effort of\n      installing RFC 822 MTA software.\
    \ If for some reason, a user or\n      mail administrator should wish to install\
    \ a different MTA or UA to\n      the pre-installed system, there exists a large\
    \ number of easily\n      available (i.e., via widespread distribution amongst\
    \ many FTP and\n      other information servers) public domain RFC 822 MTAs and\
    \ UAs.\n      Both of the above points encourages the spread and eases the\n \
    \     installation of software for the RFC 822 messaging service and in\n    \
    \  many ways explains the size and importance of the installed base\n      of\
    \ RFC 822 systems. To illustrate the extent of RFC 822 / MIME\n      products,\
    \ a non-comprehensive list of available MIME enhanced RFC\n      822 products\
    \ follows; ELM 2.4, MH 6.8, Sun Mailtool, HP Mpower\n      Desktop, Lotus cc:Mail\
    \ (unconfirmed), Zcode Zmail, Frontier\n      Super-TCP for Windows, PMDF (VAX\
    \ VMS), Pine, C-Client (library\n      routines), Metamail (viewer only), Andrew-MIME\
    \ gateway.\n   - UA capability registration\n      The IETF MHS-DS working group\
    \ has defined how X.400 and RFC 822\n      User Agent capabilities can be stored\
    \ in X.500 directory services.\n      This work is still ongoing.\n"
- title: 5.3. X.400 - 1984 and 1988
  contents:
  - "5.3. X.400 - 1984 and 1988\n   X.400(1988) substantially upgrades and enhances\
    \ the X.400(1984)\n   standards. A number of new functions have been incorporated\
    \ within\n   X.400(1988). A description of the most important features of X.400\
    \ -\n   1984 and 1988 - follows.\n   - Notifications\n      X.400(1984) provides\
    \ four notifications - positive and negative\n      delivery notifications and\
    \ positive and negative receipt\n      notifications. These notifications allow\
    \ users to ensure\n      successful message delivery or that the message was read.\
    \ The\n      delivery notifications are also used by service operators in their\n\
    \      fault escalation procedures.\n   - Binary Data Transfer\n      X.400(1984)\
    \ allows binary data transfer to be transported without\n      the necessity of\
    \ character encoding. The ability to transfer files\n      of whatever type is\
    \ a valuable end user service.  As well the lack\n      of any necessary character\
    \ encoding allows users to utilise the\n      received data without needing any\
    \ character decoding software.\n   - Multiple Body Parts\n      The ability to\
    \ send multiple body parts within one message gives\n      the user the ability\
    \ to send multiple logical components within\n      one message. This is a natural\
    \ mechanism for users as it mirrors\n      the real life situation of being able\
    \ to send within one message,\n      a letter, a word processor file, a spreadsheet\
    \ file, etc.\n   - Feature rich messaging model\n      The features of X.400 are\
    \ very rich. This provides benefits for\n      users as vendors are able to provide\
    \ applications that can utilise\n      these extensive features in an interoperable\
    \ manner due to the\n      standardisation of the features within X.400.\n   -\
    \ Clear messaging model\n      X.400(1984), as one of its most wide reaching achievements,\
    \ has\n      popularised within the market a consistent and clear model to\n \
    \     describe message handling systems. The decomposition of a message\n    \
    \  handling system into UAs, MSs, MTAs, MTS - ADMDs and PRMDs and\n      Access\
    \ Units / Gateways has proved to be an extremely useful tool\n      for users\
    \ and vendors to understand and communicate their\n      messaging needs or solutions.\n\
    \   - Multiple lower layer networks\n      X.400 has embraced the concept that\
    \ there are different technology\n      lower layer networks. This concept even\
    \ allows multiple logical\n      networks of the same technology to be supported.\
    \ X.400 allows the\n      messaging service to fully function even though the\
    \ underlying\n      network is varying. In the real world of a non-uniform network\n\
    \      layer this is an extremely powerful capability.\n   The list of major X.400(1988)\
    \ extensions to X.400(1984) follows:\n   - Distribution Lists (DLs)\n      A powerful\
    \ mechanism for arbitrarily nested Distribution Lists\n      including the ability\
    \ for DL owners to control access to their\n      lists and to control the destination\
    \ of non delivery reports.  The\n      current endemic use of DLs in the R&D community\
    \ makes this a\n      fundamental requirement for any service. X.400(1988) uses\
    \ X.500 to\n      provide a standardised support for DLs, although there have\
    \ been\n      some needed standardised enhancements relating to the CCITT\n  \
    \    defined DLs by the IETF MHS-DS work group. The provision of\n      powerful\
    \ nesting capabilities plus management mechanisms for DL\n      owners within\
    \ X.400(1988) DLs are features providing attractive\n      benefits for users\
    \ and DL managers.  There is already 'running\n      code', via the COSINE Explode\
    \ project which is implementing the\n      MHS-DS based enhancements. The project\
    \ builds upon experience\n      gained within a number of networks e.g., JNT and\
    \ provides:\n         - implementation of MHS-DS enhancements related to the\n\
    \           X.400(1988) DLs\n         - archiving of messages received by a DL.\n\
    \         - access by users to the DL archive via e-mail.\n         - subscription\
    \ to a DL by users via e-mail.\n   - Message Store (MS)\n      The Message Store\
    \ provides a server for remote UAs on workstations\n      and PCs enabling messages\
    \ to be held for their recipient, solving\n      the problems of non-continuous\
    \ availability of such UAs. The\n      message store allows mobile workers, small\
    \ offices and local\n      schools to become active messaging users in a cost\
    \ effective\n      manner. The message store provides powerful selection mechanisms\n\
    \      allowing the user to select messages to be transferred between the\n  \
    \    store and the workstation. This facility is not catered for\n      adequately\
    \ by the P3 protocol of X.400(1984) and provides a major\n      incentive for\
    \ transition.\n   - X.500 Directory names\n      Support for use of Directory\
    \ Names in MHS will allow a transition\n      from use of O/R addresses to Directory\
    \ Names when X.500\n      Directories become widespread, thus removing the need\
    \ for users to\n      know about MHS topological addressing components.\n    \
    \  The ability for X.400(1988) messages to contain directory names\n      instead\
    \ of the O/R addresses is a powerful feature for users as it\n      frees them\
    \ of the necessity to insert O/R addresses containing\n      routing information\
    \ but allows them to insert the more natural\n      directory names. However,\
    \ the management of the large amounts of\n      distributed data contained within\
    \ the directory is problematic in\n      that it involves a number of organisational\
    \ issues and not just\n      software issues. A number of X.400(1988) UAs which\
    \ allow users to\n      insert directory names instead of O/R addresses have already\
    \ been\n      developed.\n   - Support for EDI\n      Through the definition of\
    \ Pedi, as defined in X.435, X.400(1988)\n      offers integrated support for\
    \ EDI messaging. The CEC TEDIS program\n      has mandated X.400 as the main carrier\
    \ for EDI, and standardised\n      how EDI transactions are inserted into X.400\
    \ messages (i.e., Pedi\n      and P2). This provides a strong incentive to provide\
    \ native\n      X.400(1988) services to users and applications thus encouraging\n\
    \      commercial EDI traffic to migrate to X.400(1988).\n   - Secure Messaging\n\
    \      The provision of secure messaging services including\n      authentication,\
    \ confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation as\n      well as secure access\
    \ between MHS components are important\n      benefits for the R&D community.\
    \ The base standards are adequate\n      for security, however organisational\
    \ and software issues need\n      still to be solved. Organisational issues of\
    \ globally scaling the\n      distribution of secret keys is still unsolved. Software\
    \ issues of\n      how end users will be able to comfortably and securely input\n\
    \      secret keys of length 512 -> 1024 bits into security software need\n  \
    \    to be solved.\n   - Multimedia\n      The definition of a number of additional\
    \ body parts plus the\n      ability to define new body parts (e.g., Word Processor\
    \ formats,\n      Excel documents, etc.) provides the basis for multimedia services\n\
    \      over X.400(1988). As well, the newly defined General Text body\n      part\
    \ supports multinational character sets (except for ISO 10646)\n      without\
    \ the need for transmission encoding. However, unlike MIME,\n      X.400(1988)\
    \ is only specifying a standard for multimedia\n      messaging. To achieve multimedia\
    \ document exchange, there is a\n      further text exchange standard such as\
    \ ODIF, Hytime, etc., needed.\n   - Character set support for extended addressing\n\
    \      A highly desirable potential benefit for European R&D users is\n      provided\
    \ by the extended character set support(i.e., T.61) within\n      addresses. Nearly\
    \ all European languages, except for Greek and\n      Cyrillic, are supported\
    \ by the T.61 teletex encoding. Further\n      extensions to X.400 for support\
    \ of extended character sets has\n      been defined by the RARE WG on character\
    \ sets and RARE WG on\n      messaging [15].\n   - Physical Delivery Services\n\
    \      This standardised method for a message to be delivered on a\n      physical\
    \ medium, such as paper, through the normal postal service\n      is useful when\
    \ trying to reach a very wide number of (non-\n      electronically reachable)\
    \ recipients. In effect this service\n      provides an ability to 'go the last\
    \ mile' and communicate with\n      users previously not easily reachable e.g.,\
    \ farmers, etc.\n   - General Extension Mechanism\n      One of the major assets\
    \ of X.400(1988) is the extension mechanism.\n      This is used to carry most\
    \ of the extensions defined in these\n      standards, but its principal benefit\
    \ will be in reducing the\n      trauma of transitions to future versions of the\
    \ standards.\n      Provided that implementations of the X.400(1988) standards\
    \ do not\n      try to place restrictions on the values that may be present, any\n\
    \      future extension will be relayed by these implementations when the\n  \
    \    extension is not critical, thus providing a painless migration to\n     \
    \ new versions (1992 and beyond) of the standards.\n   - UA Capability Registration\n\
    \      With the extra functionality available to X.400(1988 and\n      especially\
    \ 1992) UAs (i.e., extra non-IA5 body parts, secure\n      messaging, etc.) it\
    \ is expected that the demand to register UA\n      capabilities will increase.\
    \ In that respect X.400(1988)'s ability\n      to query X.500, where such capabilities\
    \ would be stored, is a\n      significant potential benefit for users.\n   -\
    \ X.500 support for MTA routing\n      The piloting of X.500 to support MTA routing\
    \ within the R&D\n      community has already commenced, on a small experimental\
    \ scale,\n      via the Longbud project co-ordinated by the IETF MHS-DS work\n\
    \      group. Some concrete benefits promised by X.500 based routing are:\n  \
    \    - routing based upon content types, security, transport stacks\n        and\
    \ other criteria allow optimum routing paths to a\n        destination MTA to\
    \ be chosen. (There is presently no such\n        similar capability within the\
    \ DNS).\n      - allowing the routing information to be inserted and modified\n\
    \        in a distributed manner reduces (if not eliminates) the\n        necessity\
    \ of central distribution of static routing tables.\n        The consequent reduction\
    \ in manpower to co-ordinate MTA\n        routing plus the increase in scalability\
    \ of the service\n        allows a truly global messaging service to be put in\
    \ place.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Migration to X.400(1988)\n   What is clear from the previous chapters is\
    \ that;\n      - The resources, human or financial, to operate multiple wide\n\
    \        area messaging services connecting together independent\n        organisations\
    \ are high. As such it is desirable to try and\n        keep to a minimum the\
    \ number of such services. This statement\n        is true for the R&D community\
    \ but is also highly likely to be\n        valid for the general European industry.\n\
    \      - There are two publicly available technological standards\n        that\
    \ can be used by open communities, such as the R&D\n        community and public\
    \ service providers: the X.400(1984 and\n        1988) recommendations and the\
    \ Internet RFC 822 / MIME / PEM\n        standards.\n      - There is an established\
    \ very large global user base of\n        Internet RFC 822 and X.400(1984) messaging\
    \ services. Both\n        services have their own momentum within different parts\
    \ of\n        the user community, both are still developing and growing\n    \
    \    fast.\n   From the above discussion, it is clear that the infrastructure\n\
    \   services that have to be supported within these open communities, and\n  \
    \ especially within the R&D community, are RFC 822 / MIME / PEM,\n   X.400(1984)\
    \ and X.400(1988). X.400(1988) will be the preferred\n   protocol for inter-organisational\
    \ connection for European industry\n   and government and parts of the European\
    \ R&D community. RFC 822 /\n   MIME / PEM will be the preferred protocol suite\
    \ for inter-\n   organisational connection for the Internet community and, as\
    \ products\n   are already widely available, it is the preferred protocol for\
    \ parts\n   of the European R&D community.\n   The goal of European pervasive\
    \ messaging - incorporating Industry,\n   Government and Academia - would be best\
    \ accommodated and reached by\n   the establishment of a single messaging service.\
    \  However taking the\n   above into account, this is not feasible, as X.400 and\
    \ RFC 822 based\n   services will be around for a long time to come. To increase\
    \ the\n   functionality of Wide Area E-mail services there is a clear necessity\n\
    \   to:\n      - migrate RFC 822 services to a RFC 822 / MIME / PEM service.\n\
    \        A MIME based service offers more functionality to the user\n        than\
    \ a plain RFC 822 service.\n      - migrate existing X.400 services to a X.400(1988)\
    \ service.\n        Due to the lack of scalability of the X.400(1984) service\
    \ in\n        terms of extra functionality, it will become increasingly\n    \
    \    difficult to meet the needs of research users of existing\n        X.400(1984)\
    \ services unless an X.400(1988) service is put\n        into place.\n      -\
    \ provide a transparent gateway between X.400(1988) and RFC\n        822/MIME/PEM.\
    \ For the European R&D community it is essential\n        to have a transparent\
    \ gateway between the X.400(1988) service\n        and the RFC 822 / MIME / PEM\
    \ service, thus ensuring\n        connectivity between these two services with\
    \ a maximum\n        functionality.\n   Such a gateway is technically feasible\
    \ and it is an essential part of\n   an unified E-mail service. Without such a\
    \ standardised gateway the\n   overall E-mail service would deteriorate.\n   The\
    \ lack of open standards for the PC LAN messaging systems\n   discourages their\
    \ use as 'backbone' messaging technologies within\n   open communities. However\
    \ the products that these systems deliver to\n   end users ensures that their\
    \ already large share of the messaging\n   market will continue to exist for some\
    \ time. Thus it is also\n   essential that strategies that allow these systems\
    \ to be 'seamlessly'\n   integrated within the global messaging community are\
    \ put in place.\n   Not least due to the indications that the main messaging vendors\
    \ are\n   developing X.400(1988) and RFC 822/MIME gateways, a strategy to link\n\
    \   these systems together via X.400(1988) and RFC 822/MIME should be\n   developed.\n\
    \   To make migration to a X.400(1988) service feasible, extensive\n   migration\
    \ and coexistence options for various non-X.400(1988) users\n   have to be developed.\
    \ Main issue in each migration strategy remains\n   the co-operation of the users.\
    \ The migration needs to be user-driven,\n   i.e., the users need to be convinced\
    \ of the added functionality\n   (versus the cost) of migrating towards X.400(1988).\
    \ A detailed\n   summary of the different issues and possible problems involved\
    \ in the\n   transition to a X.400(1988) based messaging service, with respect\
    \ to\n   what are commonly accepted as the four most important messaging\n   services:\
    \ RFC 822, MIME and PEM; X.400(1984); MAIL-11 and PC LAN\n   messaging systems\
    \ are presented in this chapter.\n"

    \      - Manageability\n      - Reliability\n   has to be improved. Ultimately\
    \ through usage of APIs like MAPI and\n   CMC, the users interface hopefully will\
    \ become independent of the\n   mail protocol that is used. It will then be expected\
    \ to be possible\n   to let the user retain his preferred mail user interface,\

    \ that wish to effect\n   this change. As well a long term transition and coexistence\
    \ phase\n   needs to be accommodated due to the existing base of RFC 822 users.\n\
    \   An understanding of the issues involved in migrating from RFC 822 to\n   X.400(1988)\
    \ messaging services is essential before any rational\n   decisions on migration\
    \ can occur.  Certainly one, if not the main,\n   issue in such a migration is\
    \ that the migration must allow a\n   transition period where maximum functionality\
    \ between both services\n   exists. Any migration must be aware that RFC 822 messaging\
    \ services\n   are a 'moving target'.\n    - Ease of transition as perceived by\
    \ an RFC 822 user mandates\n      that the user's existing mail folders are converted\
    \ into the\n      new mail product's folder system flawlessly.\n    - The RFC\
    \ 822's user's e-mail address should remain the same\n      even after a migration.\
    \ (i.e., the user keeps the same address\n      that has two different notation\
    \ forms: X.400 and RFC 822).\n    - Users contemplating a migration will be stimulated\
    \ to do so\n      if they experience no loss of service as regards MIME and\n\
    \      X.400(1988) gatewaying; are still able to insert RFC 822\n      style addresses\
    \ into the X.400(1988) UA and are provided with\n      high performance X.400-to-RFC\
    \ 822 gateways.\n    - The added connectivity provided by X.400(1984 or 1988)\n\
    \      gateways to fax, telex, post etc. plus additional X.400 users\n      that\
    \ the user is able to reach easily (whilst not losing\n      connectivity to RFC\
    \ 822 addresses) plus the additional\n      functionality of X.400(1988) possible\
    \ when communicating with\n      X.400(1988) users will also act as a stimulant\
    \ to a\n      migration.\n    - The functionality provided by RFC 822 / MIME products\
    \ will\n      be the yardstick that an RFC 822 user compares an offered\n    \
    \  X.400(1988) product with. As such X.400(1988) products must\n      provide\
    \ some basic and important functions like: Character\n      Set support via GeneralText;\
    \ Multimedia capability via\n      Extended Body Parts; low message delays within\
    \ the seconds\n      time scales and ease of configuration of products. At present\n\
    \      there is no RFC 822 equivalent to X.400 delivery and receipt\n      notifications\
    \ and as such these functions are seen as extra\n      functionality by the user.\n\
    \    - A follow on to the extra functionality point above is that\n      present\
    \ RFC 822 users, most likely commercial users, that\n      want to be able to\
    \ use EDI or other mail enabled applications\n      that need security, message\
    \ audits and positive confirmations\n      will be encouraged to migrate to X.400(1988).\
    \ A decision to\n      use X.400(1988) in this case would be especially attractive\n\
    \      for those commercial RFC 822 users that are already operating\n      multiple\
    \ lower layer networks. As X.400(1988) accommodates\n      multiple different\
    \ network layers easily, the cost to migrate\n      could be considered quite\
    \ small.\n"

  - "6.3. X.400(1984) services\n   A number of problems can be identified in a migration\
    \ from\n   X.400(1984) to X.400(1988). They are summarised as,\n    - OSI supporting\
    \ layers are mandatory in the ISO10021 MOTIS\n      standard, while the support\
    \ of the complete OSI stack (normal\n      mode ) is optional in the otherwise\
    \ equivalent CCITT\n      X.400(1988) specifications. It is thus recommended that\
    \ the\n      migration from X.400(1984) should be straight to ISO 10021\n    \
    \  i.e., straight to use of the full OSI stack with normal mode\n      RTS.\n\
    \    - There is a negative impact on quality of service caused by\n      implementation\
    \ decisions related to the 'General Extension\n      Mechanism'. To overcome this\
    \ negative impact no minimal\n      X.400(1988) MTAs, which relay the syntax but\
    \ understand none\n      of the semantics of extensions, should be used.\n   \
    \ - All X.400(1988) MTAs should generate reports containing the\n      extensions\
    \ that are present in the original message and route\n      such reports through\
    \ the DL expansion hierarchy where\n      appropriate.\n    - Choice of standards\
    \ to be used within mixed X.400(1984 and\n      1988) management domains needs\
    \ to accommodate in one option\n      the danger of undetectable routing loops\
    \ from incorrectly\n      configured routing entries and in another option the\
    \ problem\n      that systems that have fixed the routing loop problem may not\n\
    \      all be consistently implemented due to ambiguities within the\n      standards.\
    \ The choice of which of these two options a\n      management domain uses internally\
    \ has no impact on external\n      management domains.\n    - DDA support is needed\
    \ by X.400(1984) systems to address\n      X.400(1988) Common Name Attribute users\
    \ [2].\n    - Minimum loss of service quality mandates that downgrading of\n \
    \     X.400(1988) body parts to X.400(1984) bodyparts be done\n      according\
    \ to the MIMEMHS specifications [4].\n    - To enhance connectivity to both X.400(1984\
    \ and 1988)\n      management domains without degradation of X.400(1988)\n   \
    \   service, management domain entry points that support both\n      X.400(1984\
    \ and 1988) are recommended.\n    - Ensuring that no X.400(1988) MTAs transit\
    \ via X.400(1984)\n      MTAs. This allows no degradation of X.400(1988) service\n\
    \      quality [17].\n   The consequence of the last point is that the existing\
    \ European\n   Research X.400(1984) - formerly COSINE MHS - MTA RELAY backbone\n\
    \   should be one of the first MTA communities to migrate to X.400(1988).\n"

  - "*Benefits*\n   Below is a list of non-technically oriented benefits and the features\n\
    \   of X.400(1988) that enable these benefits to occur. The benefit of,\n    -\
    \ efficient and innovative communication within Europe is\n      assisted by establishing\
    \ an X.400(1988) messaging service\n      that integrates European industry, government\
    \ and academia;\n    - an increase in business efficiency by the use of EDI (for\n\
    \      example automatic processing of business forms, exchange of\n      business\
    \ contracts, etc.) is enhanced by the security aspects\n      of X.400(1988) i.e.,\

    \ access between MHS\n      components.\n    - allowing European users to communicate\

    \       - a cost per service provider,\n       - a cost per organisation,\n  \
    \     - a cost per user and\n       - a cost per user MTA for migrating to X.400(1988).\n\
    \   To bring about the benefits, mentioned above, certain costs will be\n   incurred\
    \ and they are summarised below:\n   - Cost per backbone of RELAY MTAs (as used\
    \ by the European\n     research community - the former Cosine MHS service)\n\
    \         - The equipment costs of migrating backbone RELAY MTAs.\n         -\

    \ to oversee a backbone RELAY MTA pilot.\n      As most of the RELAY MTAs are\
    \ already X.400(1988) capable, there\n      is already a MHS Co-ordination service\
    \ in place that could be used\n      for this function and the number of backbone\
    \ RELAY MTAs is less\n      than 100 in number the cost for migrating the RELAY\
    \ MTA backbone\n      is considered relatively low.\n   - Cost per service provider\n\
    \         - If the RELAY MTA backbone (formerly Cosine MHS) is\n           migrated\
    \ towards X.400(1988), then the remaining cost\n           for a service provider\
    \ for migrating the infrastructure\n           towards X.400(1988) is relatively\
    \ low.\n         - The operational costs for organisational issues, for\n    \
    \       example dealing with OID registrations, is low if\n           national\
    \ R&D service providers act as a clearinghouse\n           for their own national\
    \ R&D institutions e.g.,\n           Universities.\n   - Cost per organisation,\
    \ end user and MTA\n         - The operational costs of migrating end users and\
    \ their\n           MTAs in management domains to X.400(1988) are higher\n   \
    \        than the costs involved with migrating the\n           infrastructure.\
    \ This is due to the order of at least 10\n           to 100 times more MTAs,\
    \ as compared to the service\n           providers, that would be involved with\
    \ a migration to\n           X.400(1988). As the infrastructure needs to migrate\n\

    \ by profiting from the migration experience of the\n           service providers.\n\
    \         - The education and training costs for users and system\n          \
    \ managers are significant, due to the amount of end\n           users and end\
    \ user MTAs. Any marginal cost savings per\n           user which can be made,\
    \ e.g., by deployment of automated\n           tools, should be considered due\
    \ to the large overall\n           savings that accrue.\n         - The costs\
    \ of any potential disruption of the end user's\n           messaging service\
    \ are high - due to the huge numbers of\n           end users involved - and as\
    \ such only a very well\n           managed, phased and planned migration should\
    \ be\n           considered.\n   - Software costs\n         - The costs for software\
    \ development are outside the\n           scope of this report. However it is\

    \ associated with the migration increase as the migration\n   evolves towards\
    \ the end users.\n   The benefits of migrating to a X.400(1988) service are a\

    \ to be co-ordinated by using an industry forum where\n      all parties could\
    \ meet. The use of an existing forum, where\n      user organisations are well\
    \ represented, is desirable if\n      commercial end users organisation's requirements\
    \ are to be\n      met. The forum should also be open to non-European\n      participants.\n\

    \ backbone RELAY MTA service within a X.400(1988)\n      pilot service. The end\
    \ user services should be given a high\n      priority.\n    - Help an already\
    \ emerging market place in X.400(1988)\n      products to prosper by ensuring\
    \ that a suitable supply of\n      high quality X.400(1988) public domain software\
    \ is available.\n      The Internet has proven, that public domain software, free\
    \ of\n      any commercial restrictions, is further rapidly developed, by\n  \
    \    Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs), into derivative\n      products\
    \ suitable for the commercial market.\n    - Any pilot service should be well\
    \ co-ordinated and result\n      driven but utilise a distributed market oriented\
    \ approach. It\n      is considered very difficult to organise and plan such a\n\
    \      pilot under the assumption of a single centrally funded body\n      i.e.,\
    \ driven from the 'top'. A more 'market driven' or\n      distributed organisation\

    \ need to ensure near\n      total and 'perfect' integration with the existing\
    \ and also\n      evolving RFC 822 based services.\n    - For the academic community\
    \ a rapid migration of the existing\n      X.400(1984) backbone RELAY MTAs, used\
    \ within the European R&D\n      X.400(1984) service, - formerly the COSINE MHS\
    \ service - is\n      considered urgent. This migration will provide a 'bootstrap'\n\
    \      path for academic organisations to internationally pilot\n      X.400(1988)\
    \ services. Such end user piloting is not\n      considered feasible if X.400(1984)\
    \ backbone RELAY MTAs are\n      used for an X.400(1988) service (see Reference\
    \ [17] for\n      technical details).\n   The report does not include any recommendations\
    \ on development and\n   deployment of RFC 822 / MIME / PEM related (pilot) services,\
    \ as these\n   are outside of the scope of the Task Force. However, since both\n\
    \   X.400(1988) and RFC 822 / MIME / PEM will be developed and used\n   within\
    \ the European R&D community, such a pilot should also be\n   considered.\n"

- title: Appendix A - Elaboration on the main recommendations
  contents:
  - "Appendix A - Elaboration on the main recommendations\n   The main recommendations\
    \ of the report are elaborated upon in more\n   detail within this appendix.\n\
    \    - In order to provide a globally pervasive messaging service,\n      it is\
    \ recommended to establish a well operated Pan-European\n      X.400(1988) pilot\
    \ backbone comprising MTAs and MSs,\n      connecting partners within Industry,\
    \ Commercial Service\n      Providers, Academia and Public Bodies (CEC, National\n\
    \      Governments, etc.). The pilot should be open to global\n      participation.\n\
    \    - In order to maintain the widest connectivity with the\n      highest possible\
    \ functionality, gateways should be installed\n      that gateway between X.400(1988)\
    \ and RFC 822/MIME. These\n      gateways should follow the specifications of\
    \ RFC 1327 [1] and\n      RFC 1494 et al. [4]. Experience with these gateways\
    \ should be\n      fed back into the appropriate RARE and IETF Working Groups\
    \ to\n      improve the standards.\n    - In order that the 'business needs' of\
    \ non-R&D organisations\n      can be inserted at an early stage into the goals\
    \ of the pilot\n      and ensuring that the success of the pilot in meeting these\n\
    \      goals can be measured and disseminated i.e., to encourage the\n      active\
    \ participation of non-R&D organisations within the\n      pilot, it is recommended\
    \ that an open forum comprising\n      industry, service providers, public bodies\
    \ and academia\n      should be used. Preferably an existing forum where end users\n\
    \      are heavily involved is desirable.\n    - In order for meaningful co-operation\
    \ between bodies affected\n      by the pilot to occur and thus hopefully reducing\
    \ unnecessary\n      duplications, it is recommended that there are close liaisons\n\
    \      and contacts between at least the IETF, RARE, EARN, EUnet,\n      RIPE,\
    \ Y-NET, EEMA, EMA, EWOS, OIW, CEN/CENELEC, ISO, CCITT,\n      CEC and European\
    \ governmental bodies and those involved\n      within the pilot. The suggested\
    \ mechanism for a meaningful\n      liaison is that enough participants of the\
    \ above\n      organisations attend the common forum mentioned above. It is\n\
    \      also suggested that as much as possible e-mail distribution\n      lists\
    \ be used to communicate between forum participants.\n    - In order that the\
    \ pilot have measurable results, it is\n      recommended that the pilot shall\
    \ be implemented in phases. It\n      is considered that at least two phases are\
    \ needed:\n         - phase 1 - initial short start up phase with a small\n  \
    \         number of participants. The result of this phase is\n           that\
    \ any needed procedures, co-ordination mechanisms,\n           etc. are put into\
    \ place for the large scale piloting of\n           phase 2.\n         - phase\
    \ 2 - phase with a wide Pan-European participation.\n           The result of\
    \ this phase should be a proof of scaling\n           of the pilot X.400(1988)\
    \ service i.e., the goals of the\n           pilot as defined in Chapter 1 are\
    \ met. It is expected\n           that upon successful completion of this phase\
    \ a natural\n           evolution to a global deployment of a X.400(1988)\n  \
    \         service will have started.\n    - In order to rapidly complete phase\
    \ 1 of the pilot and that\n      the pilot is at least Pan-European in scope,\
    \ it is\n      recommended that; a number of R&D service providers, one each\n\
    \      from several European countries; at least 2 North American\n      R&D service\
    \ providers; at least 1 Japanese R&D service\n      provider and a small number\
    \ of commercial service providers\n      and commercial organisations are actively\
    \ involved in phase\n      1.\n    - In order to stimulate the creation of an\
    \ economically viable\n      market place for X.400(1988) products (i.e., MTAs,\
    \ UAs, etc.)\n      (i.e., users are willing to purchase such products), it is\n\
    \      recommended that a suitable minimum number of new software\n      implementations\
    \ and or modifications to existing software\n      implementations be funded.\
    \ The resulting software to be\n      inserted into the Public Domain free of\
    \ any financial\n      restrictions on further commercial exploitation. By using\n\
    \      this mechanism, Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs) will\n      be\
    \ encouraged to commercially exploit such products.\n    - Due to the strong influence\
    \ of the R&D community within the\n      pilot plus the desire to produce standardised\
    \ products\n      quickly and pragmatically, it is recommended that any\n    \
    \  standards proposed within the scope of an X.400(1988) pilot\n      (for example\
    \ standards re: character sets and body parts\n      gatewayed to and from X.400(1988)\
    \ and RFC 822 / MIME) are\n      conformant to and candidates for Internet standardisation.\
    \ As\n      a concrete example of the standardisation process, this means\n  \
    \    that at least two independent software implementations, for\n      each product\
    \ category, (of which one product preferably in\n      the Public Domain) must\
    \ be proven as interworking to a\n      proposed standard before the proposed\
    \ standard can be\n      elevated to draft standard [20].\n    - To ensure that\
    \ there is a market driven demand for\n      X.400(1988) products within the commercial\
    \ market place, it\n      is recommended that the maximum number of Public Domain\n\
    \      implementations that are funded, by any one public funding\n      organisation,\
    \ is two. It is desirable that at least one other\n      product, preferably commercially\
    \ based and not within the\n      Public Domain, is produced.\n    - In order\
    \ that any necessary information required for the\n      effective operation of\
    \ the X.400(1988) pilot, including not\n      least OID assignments, mapping rules,\
    \ information about\n      interconnection partners, naming authority information\
    \ be\n      made widely available, it is recommended that an\n      electronically\
    \ accessible information base be established.\n    - In order that any necessary\
    \ organisational issues needed for\n      a deployment of an X.400(1988) service\
    \ have a body in place\n      to deal with this issue, it is recommended that\
    \ the pilot\n      either identify and list which bodies are responsible for\n\
    \      which issues or else actively ensure that a suitable body is\n      being\
    \ put in place.\n"
- title: Appendix B - A number of detailed guidelines.

  - "Appendix B - A number of detailed guidelines.\n   The Task Force has the following\
    \ detailed guidelines:\n"
- title: '*Product and operational service guidelines*'
  contents:
  - "*Product and operational service guidelines*\n    - To ensure that there is no\
    \ degradation of X.400(1988)\n      service between X.400(1988) originators and\
    \ destinations, the\n      topology of the MTS must be such that no X.400(1984)\
    \ MTA acts\n      as a relay between any two X.400(1988) users.\n    - As the\
    \ existing R&D X.400(1984) service (formerly COSINE\n      MHS) now comprises\
    \ a large number of X.400(1988) capable\n      RELAYs, it would be relatively\
    \ straight forward that the\n      existing COSINE MHS RELAYs be one of the first\
    \ communities\n      that are migrated to X.400(1988) capabilities. This would\n\
    \      ensure that X.400(1988) MTAs using the RELAY backbone\n      experience\
    \ no loss of service.\n    - To be able to operate an X.400(1988) service a properly\n\
    \      operated X.400(1988) infrastructure should be established,\n      consisting\
    \ of X.400(1988) MTAs, X.400(1988) MTAs with\n      downgrading capabilities according\
    \ to RTR 3, Message Store\n      services and gateways to RFC 822 based upon RTR\
    \ 2 and\n      extended gatewaying functionality for multimedia mail.\n    - To\
    \ ensure maximum use of the OSI supporting layers plus\n      support of normal\
    \ mode RTS, it is recommended that a\n      migration to ISO 10021 is effected\
    \ i.e., straight to use of\n      the full OSI stack with normal mode RTS.\n \
    \   - To ensure maximum quality of service as impacted by\n      implementation\
    \ decisions related to the 'General Extension\n      Mechanism', it is recommended\
    \ that no minimal X.400(1988)\n      MTAs, which relay the syntax but understand\
    \ none of the\n      semantics of extensions, should be used.\n    - It is recommended\
    \ that all X.400(1988) MTAs should generate\n      reports containing extensions\
    \ copied from the subject message\n      and route reports through the DL expansion\
    \ hierarchy where\n      appropriate.\n    - It is recommended that all X.400(1984)\
    \ UAs are able to\n      generate and display DDAs. This will allow such systems\
    \ to\n      address X.400(1988) Common Name Attribute users.\n    - To enhance\
    \ connectivity to both X.400(1984 and 1988)\n      management domains without\
    \ degradation of X.400(1988)\n      service, management domain entry points that\
    \ support both\n      X.400(1984 and 1988) are recommended.\n    - To ensure total\
    \ connectivity between RFC 822 domains\n      migrating to X.400(1988), it is\
    \ recommended that a local\n      X.400-to-RFC-822 gateway is made operational\
    \ or a reliable\n      service agreement for the external provision of such a\n\
    \      gateway is effected before any migration begins.\n"

    \ However further investigation is needed before\n      recommending that such\

    \    - It is recommended that the ease of configuration of\n      X.400(1988)\

    \ to support X.400(1988) messaging.\n         - X.400(1988) MTAs, UAs, MSs, gateways\
    \ to RFC 822/MIME\n           and X.400(1984) plus gateways to other messaging\n\
    \           systems e.g., Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail, etc.\n         - User\
    \ Interfaces that integrate X.400(1988) UAs and\n           X.500 DUAs with user\
    \ applications such as Word\n           Processors, etc.\n         - E-mail network\
    \ management software both for users and\n           administrators\n    - Organisational\n\
    \         - trusted network for security (i.e., the distribution of\n        \
    \   security keys) and whether this trusted network should\n           or can\
    \ be the same as the PEM trusted network presently\n           under deployment.\n\
    \         - usage of PEM within X.400(1988).\n         - PEM to and from X.400(1988)\
    \ gatewaying.\n         - how to register and publicise object IDs for\n     \
    \      X.400(1988).\n         - addresses are well publicised of PRMD and ADMD\n\
    \           registration authorities.\n         - creation and modification authority\
    \ for X.400-to-RFC-\n           822 mapping rules is defined.\n         - creation\
    \ and modification authority for MTA routing\n           rules is defined.\n \
    \        - what methods should be used to liaison to other bodies\n          \
    \ like IETF, ISO, EEMA, EMA, etc.\n         - ensuring that any Public Domain\
    \ software needed for the\n           X.400(1988) service is distributed widely,\
    \ quickly and\n           efficiently.\n    - Deployment\n         - which services\
    \ should start such a migration (i.e.,\n           COSINE MHS RELAYs, Universities,\
    \ other).\n         - the topology of the X.400(1988) MTS.\n         - addressing\
    \ of users between X.400(1984 and 1988) and\n           RFC 822 e.g., how will\
    \ X.400(1988) T.61 address\n           components be processed by X.400(1984)\
    \ and RFC 822\n           systems.\n         - which X.400(1988) body parts MUST\
    \ be supported by the\n           research community.\n         - if any new APIs\
    \ - or modified APIs - are needed for\n           X.400(1988) and messaging in\
    \ general.\n         - the specifications and development of any needed Public\n\
    \           Domain software.\n         - what existing Public Domain software\
    \ should be modified\n           to accommodate X.400(1988) systems.\n       \
    \  - how rapidly to deploy the X.400(1988) service.\n         - ensuring that\
    \ there is 'little or no loss of service'\n           in any migration from X.400(1984),\
    \ or RFC 822, to\n           X.400(1988).\n         - considering what Value Added\
    \ Services, based upon\n           X.400(1988), could be started to encourage\
    \ uptake of\n           X.400(1988).\n"
