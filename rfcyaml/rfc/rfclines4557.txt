Abstract This document defines a mechanism to enable in band transmission of Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses in the Kerberos network authentication protocol.
These responses are used to verify the validity of the certificates used in Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT), which is the Kerberos Version 5 extension that provides for the use of public key cryptography.
Introduction Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
[RFC2560] enables applications to obtain timely information regarding the revocation status of a certificate.
Because OCSP responses are well bounded and small in size, constrained clients may wish to use OCSP to check the validity of the certificates for Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) in order to avoid transmission of large Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and therefore save bandwidth on constrained networks [OCSP PROFILE].
This document defines a pre authentication type [RFC4120], where the client and the KDC MAY piggyback OCSP responses for certificates used in authentication exchanges, as defined in [RFC4556].
By using this OPTIONAL extension, PKINIT clients and the KDC can maximize the reuse of cached OCSP responses.
Conventions Used in This Document
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Message Definition A pre authentication type identifier is defined for this mechanism:
The corresponding padata value field [RFC4120] contains the DER [X60] encoding of the following ASN.1 type:
If more than one OcspResponse is   included,
the first OcspResponse   MUST contain the OCSP response   for the signer's certificate.
The signer refers to the client for   AS REQ, and the KDC for the AS REP,   respectively.
Contains a complete OCSP response,   as defined in [RFC2560].
The client MAY send OCSP responses for certificates used in PA PK  AS REQ [RFC4556] via a PA PK OCSP RESPONSE.
The KDC that receives a PA PK OCSP RESPONSE SHOULD send a PA PK  OCSP RESPONSE containing OCSP responses for certificates used in the KDC's PA PK AS REP.
The client can request a PA PK OCSP RESPONSE by using a PKOcspData containing an empty sequence.
The KDC MAY send a PA PK OCSP RESPONSE when it does not receive a PA PK OCSP RESPONSE from the client.
The PA PK OCSP RESPONSE sent by the KDC contains OCSP responses for certificates used in PA PK AS REP [RFC4556].
Note the lack of integrity protection for the empty or missing OCSP response; lack of an expected OCSP response from the KDC for the KDC's certificates SHOULD be treated as an error by the client, unless it is configured otherwise.
When using OCSP, the response is signed by the OCSP server, which is trusted by the receiver.
Depending on local policy, further verification of the validity of the OCSP servers may be needed The client and the KDC SHOULD ignore invalid OCSP responses received via this mechanism, and they MAY implement CRL processing logic as a fall back position, if the OCSP responses received via this mechanism alone are not sufficient for the verification of certificate validity.
The client and/or the KDC MAY ignore a valid OCSP response and perform its own revocation status verification independently.
The pre authentication data in this document do not actually authenticate any principals, but are designed to be used in conjunction with PKINIT.
There is no binding between PA PK OCSP RESPONSE pre
authentication data and PKINIT pre authentication data other than a given OCSP response corresponding to a certificate used in a PKINIT
Attacks involving removal or replacement of PA PK OCSP RESPONSE pre authentication data elements are, at worst, downgrade attacks, where a PKINIT client or KDC would proceed without use of CRLs or OCSP for certificate validation, or denial of service attacks, where a PKINIT client or KDC that cannot validate the other's certificate without an accompanying OCSP response might reject the AS exchange or might have to download very large CRLs in order to continue.
Kerberos V does not protect against denial of service attacks; therefore, the denial of service aspect of these attacks is acceptable.
If a PKINIT client or KDC cannot validate certificates without the aid of a valid PA PK OCSP RESPONSE, then it SHOULD fail the AS exchange, possibly according to local configuration.
