  - "Abstract\n   OSPFv3 is a candidate for deployments in environments where\n   autoconfiguration
    is a requirement.  One such environment is the IPv6\n   home network where users
    expect to simply plug in a router and have\n   it automatically use OSPFv3 for
    intra-domain routing.  This document\n   describes the necessary mechanisms for
    OSPFv3 to be self-configuring.\n   This document updates RFC 5340 by relaxing
    the HelloInterval/\n   RouterDeadInterval checking during OSPFv3 adjacency formation
    and\n   adding hysteresis to the update of self-originated Link State\n   Advertisements
    (LSAs).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] is a candidate for deployments in environments
    where\n   autoconfiguration is a requirement.  This document describes\n   extensions
    to OSPFv3 to enable it to operate in these environments.\n   In this mode of operation,
    the protocol is largely unchanged from the\n   base OSPFv3 protocol specification
    [OSPFV3].  Since the goals of\n   autoconfiguration and security can be conflicting,
    operators and\n   network administrators should carefully consider their security\n
    \  requirements before deploying the solution described in this\n   document.
    \ Refer to Section 8 for more information.\n   The following aspects of OSPFv3
    autoconfiguration are described in\n   this document:\n   1.  Default OSPFv3 Configuration\n
    \  2.  HelloInterval/RouterDeadInterval Flexibility\n   3.  OSPFv3 Minimal Authentication
    Configuration\n   4.  Unique OSPFv3 Router ID Generation\n   5.  OSPFv3 Adjacency
    Formation\n   6.  Duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID Resolution\n   7.  Self-Originated
    LSA Processing\n   OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] is updated by allowing OSPFv3 adjacencies to
    be\n   formed between OSPFv3 routers with differing HelloIntervals or\n   RouterDeadIntervals
    (refer to Section 3).  Additionally, hysteresis\n   has been added to the processing
    of stale self-originated LSAs to\n   mitigate the flooding overhead created by
    an OSPFv3 Router with a\n   duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID in the OSPFv3 routing domain
    (refer to\n   Section 7.4).  Both updates are fully backward compatible.\n"

    title: 1.1.  Requirements Notation
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  OSPFv3 Default Configuration\n   For complete autoconfiguration, OSPFv3 will
    need to choose suitable\n   configuration defaults.  These include:\n   1.  Area
    0 Only - All autoconfigured OSPFv3 interfaces MUST be in\n       area 0.\n   2.
    \ OSPFv3 SHOULD be autoconfigured on all IPv6-capable interfaces on\n       the
    router.  An interface MAY be excluded if it is clear that\n       running OSPFv3
    on the interface is not required.  For example, if\n       manual configuration
    or another condition indicates that an\n       interface is connected to an Internet
    Service Provider (ISP),\n       there is typically no need to employ OSPFv3.  In
    fact, [IPv6-CPE]\n       specifically requires that IPv6 Customer Premise Equipment
    (CPE)\n       routers not initiate any dynamic routing protocol by default on\n
    \      the router's WAN, i.e., ISP-facing, interface.  In home\n       networking
    environments, an interface where no OSPFv3 neighbors\n       are found, but a
    DHCP IPv6 prefix can be acquired, may be\n       considered an ISP-facing interface,
    and running OSPFv3 is\n       unnecessary.\n   3.  OSPFv3 interfaces will be autoconfigured
    to an interface type\n       corresponding to their Layer 2 capability.  For example,
    Ethernet\n       interfaces and Wi-Fi interfaces will be autoconfigured as OSPFv3\n
    \      broadcast networks and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) interfaces\n       will
    be autoconfigured as OSPFv3 Point-to-Point interfaces.  Most\n       extant OSPFv3
    implementations do this already. autoconfigured\n       operation over wireless
    networks requiring a point-to-multipoint\n       (P2MP) topology and dynamic metrics
    based on wireless feedback is\n       not within the scope of this document.  However,\n
    \      autoconfiguration is not precluded in these environments.\n   4.  OSPFv3
    interfaces MAY use an arbitrary HelloInterval and\n       RouterDeadInterval as
    specified in Section 3.  Of course, an\n       identical HelloInterval and RouterDeadInterval
    will still be\n       required to form an adjacency with an OSPFv3 router not\n
    \      supporting autoconfiguration [OSPFV3].\n   5.  All OSPFv3 interfaces SHOULD
    be autoconfigured to use an\n       Interface Instance ID of 0 that corresponds
    to the base IPv6\n       unicast address family instance ID as defined in [OSPFV3-AF].\n
    \      Similarly, if IPv4 unicast addresses are advertised in a separate\n       autoconfigured
    OSPFv3 instance, the base IPv4 unicast address\n       family instance ID value,
    i.e., 64, SHOULD be autoconfigured as\n       the Interface Instance ID for all
    interfaces corresponding to the\n       IPv4 unicast OSPFv3 instance [OSPFV3-AF].\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  OSPFv3 HelloInterval/RouterDeadInterval Flexibility\n   autoconfigured OSPFv3
    routers will not require an identical\n   HelloInterval and RouterDeadInterval
    to form adjacencies.  Rather,\n   the received HelloInterval will be ignored and
    the received\n   RouterDeadInterval will be used to determine OSPFv3 liveliness
    with\n   the sending router.  In other words, the Neighbor Inactivity Timer\n
    \  (Section 10 of [OSPFV2]) for each neighbor will reflect that\n   neighbor's
    advertised RouterDeadInterval and MAY be different from\n   other OSPFv3 routers
    on the link without impacting adjacency\n   formation.  A similar mechanism requiring
    additional signaling is\n   proposed for all OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 routers [ASYNC-HELLO].\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Wait Timer Reduction\n   In many situations, autoconfigured OSPFv3 routers
      will be deployed in\n   environments where back-to-back ethernet connections
      are utilized.\n   When this is the case, an OSPFv3 broadcast interface will
      not come up\n   until the other OSPFv3 router is connected, and the routers
      will wait\n   RouterDeadInterval seconds before forming an adjacency [OSPFV2].
      \ In\n   order to reduce this delay, an autoconfigured OSPFv3 router MAY\n   reduce
      the wait interval to a value no less than (HelloInterval + 1).\n   Reducing
      the setting will slightly increase the likelihood of the\n   Designated Router
      (DR) flapping but is preferable to the long\n   adjacency formation delay.  Note
      that this value is not included in\n   OSPFv3 Hello packets and does not impact
      interoperability.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  OSPFv3 Minimal Authentication Configuration\n   In many deployments, the
    requirement for OSPFv3 authentication\n   overrides the goal of complete OSPFv3
    autoconfiguration.  Therefore,\n   it is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv3 routers supporting
    this specification\n   minimally offer an option to explicitly configure a single
    password\n   for HMAC-SHA authentication as described in [OSPFV3-AUTH-TRAILER].\n
    \  It is RECOMMENDED that the password be entered as ASCII hexadecimal\n   digits
    and that 32 or more digits be accepted to facilitate a\n   password with a high
    degree of entropy.  When configured, the\n   password will be used on all autoconfigured
    interfaces with the\n   Security Association Identifier (SA ID) set to 1 and HMAC-SHA-256\n
    \  used as the authentication algorithm.\n"
  title: 4.  OSPFv3 Minimal Authentication Configuration
- contents:
  - "5.  OSPFv3 Router ID Selection\n   An OSPFv3 router requires a unique Router
    ID within the OSPFv3\n   routing domain for correct protocol operation.  Existing
    Router ID\n   selection algorithms (Appendix C.1 in [OSPFV2] and [OSPFV3]) are
    not\n   viable since they are dependent on a unique IPv4 interface address\n   that
    is not likely to be available in autoconfigured deployments.  An\n   OSPFv3 router
    implementing this specification will select a Router ID\n   that has a high probability
    of uniqueness.  A pseudorandom number\n   SHOULD be used for the OSPFv3 Router
    ID.  The generation SHOULD be\n   seeded with a variable that is likely to be
    unique in the applicable\n   OSPFv3 router deployment.  A good choice of seed
    would be some\n   portion or hash of the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint as described
    in\n   Section 7.2.2.\n   Since there is a possibility of a Router ID collision,
    duplicate\n   Router ID detection and resolution are required as described in\n
    \  Sections 7 and 7.3.  OSPFv3 routers SHOULD maintain the last\n   successfully
    chosen Router ID in nonvolatile storage to avoid\n   collisions subsequent to
    when an autoconfigured OSPFv3 router is\n   first added to the OSPFv3 routing
    domain.\n"
  title: 5.  OSPFv3 Router ID Selection
- contents:
  - "6.  OSPFv3 Adjacency Formation\n   Since OSPFv3 uses IPv6 link-local addresses
    for all protocol messages\n   other than messages sent on virtual links (which
    are not applicable\n   to autoconfiguration), OSPFv3 adjacency formation can proceed
    as soon\n   as a Router ID has been selected and the IPv6 link-local address has\n
    \  completed Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) as specified in IPv6\n   Stateless
    Address Autoconfiguration [SLAAC].  Otherwise, the only\n   changes to the OSPFv3
    base specification are supporting\n   HelloInterval/RouterDeadInterval flexibility
    as described in\n   Section 3 and duplicate Router ID detection and resolution
    as\n   described in Sections 7 and 7.3.\n"
  title: 6.  OSPFv3 Adjacency Formation
- contents:
  - "7.  OSPFv3 Duplicate Router ID Detection and Resolution\n   There are two cases
    of duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID detection.  One\n   where the OSPFv3 router with
    the duplicate Router ID is directly\n   connected and one where it is not.  In
    both cases, the duplicate\n   resolution is for one of the routers to select a
    new OSPFv3 Router\n   ID.\n"
  - contents:
    - "7.1.  Duplicate Router ID Detection for Neighbors\n   In this case, a duplicate
      Router ID is detected if any valid OSPFv3\n   packet is received with the same
      OSPFv3 Router ID but a different\n   IPv6 link-local source address.  Once this
      occurs, the OSPFv3 router\n   with the numerically smaller IPv6 link-local address
      will need to\n   select a new Router ID as described in Section 7.3.  Note that
      the\n   fact that the OSPFv3 router is a neighbor on a non-virtual interface\n
      \  implies that the router is directly connected.  An OSPFv3 router\n   implementing
      this specification should ensure that the inadvertent\n   connection of multiple
      router interfaces to the same physical link is\n   not misconstrued as detection
      of an OSPFv3 neighbor with a duplicate\n   Router ID.\n"

    - "7.2.  Duplicate Router ID Detection for Non-neighbors\n   OSPFv3 routers implementing
      autoconfiguration, as specified herein,\n   MUST originate an Autoconfiguration
      (AC) Link State Advertisement\n   (LSA) including the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint
      Type-Length-Value\n   (TLV).  The Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV contains a
      variable-\n   length value that has a very high probability of uniquely identifying\n
      \  the advertising OSPFv3 router.  An OSPFv3 router implementing this\n   specification
      MUST detect received Autoconfiguration LSAs with its\n   Router ID specified
      in the LSA header.  LSAs received with the local\n   OSPFv3 Router's Router
      ID in the LSA header are perceived as self-\n   originated (see Section 4.6
      of [OSPFV3]).  In these received\n   Autoconfiguration LSAs, the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint
      TLV is\n   compared against the OSPFv3 Router's own router hardware fingerprint.\n
      \  If the fingerprints are not equal, there is a duplicate Router ID\n   conflict
      and the OSPFv3 router with the numerically smaller router\n   hardware fingerprint

    - "7.3.  Duplicate Router ID Resolution\n   The OSPFv3 router selected to resolve
      the duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID\n   condition must select a new OSPFv3 Router
      ID.  The OSPFv3 router\n   SHOULD reduce the possibility of a subsequent Router
      ID collision by\n   checking the Link State Database (LSDB) for an OSPFv3\n
      \  Autoconfiguration LSA with the newly selected Router ID and a\n   different
      Router-Hardware-Fingerprint.  If one is detected, a new\n   Router ID should
      be selected without going through the resolution\n   process (Section 7).  After
      selecting a new Router ID, all self-\n   originated LSAs MUST be reoriginated,
      and any OSPFv3 neighbor\n   adjacencies MUST be reestablished.  The OSPFv3 router
      retaining the\n   Router ID causing the conflict will reoriginate or flush any
      stale\n   self-originated LSAs as described in Section 13.4 of [OSPFV2].\n"

    - "7.4.  Change to RFC 2328, Section 13.4 (\"Receiving Self-Originated\n      LSAs\")\n
      \  RFC 2328 [OSPFV2], Section 13.4, describes the processing of received\n   self-originated
      LSAs.  If the received LSA doesn't exist, the\n   receiving router will flush
      it from the OSPF routing domain.  If the\n   LSA is newer than the version in
      the LSDB, the receiving router will\n   originate a newer version by advancing
      the LSA sequence number and\n   reoriginating.  Since it is possible for an
      autoconfigured OSPFv3\n   router to choose a duplicate OSPFv3 Router ID, OSPFv3
      routers\n   implementing this specification should detect when multiple instances\n
      \  of the same self-originated LSA are flushed or reoriginated since\n   this
      is indicative of an OSPFv3 router with a duplicate Router ID in\n   the OSPFv3
      routing domain.  When this condition is detected, the\n   OSPFv3 router SHOULD
      delay self-originated LSA processing for LSAs\n   that have recently been flushed
      or reoriginated.  This specification\n   recommends 10 seconds as the interval
      defining recent self-originated\n   LSA processing and an exponential back-off
      of 1 to 8 seconds for the\n   processing delay.  This additional delay should
      allow for the\n   mechanisms described in Section 7 to resolve the duplicate
      OSPFv3\n   Router ID conflict.\n   Since this mechanism is useful in mitigating
      the flooding overhead\n   associated with the inadvertent or malicious introduction
      of an\n   OSPFv3 router with a duplicate Router ID into an OSPFv3 routing\n
      \  domain, it MAY be deployed outside of autoconfigured deployments.\n   The
      detection of a self-originated LSA that is being repeatedly\n   reoriginated
      or flushed SHOULD be logged.\n"

- contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The goals of security and complete OSPFv3 autoconfiguration
    are\n   somewhat contradictory.  When no explicit security configuration\n   takes
    place, autoconfiguration implies that additional devices placed\n   in the network
    are automatically adopted as a part of the network.\n   However, autoconfiguration
    can also be combined with password\n   configuration (see Section 4) or future
    extensions for automatic\n   pairing between devices.  These mechanisms can help
    provide an\n   automatically configured, securely routed network.\n   In deployments
    where a different authentication algorithm or\n   encryption is required (or different
    per-interface keys are\n   required), OSPFv3 IPsec [OSPFV3-IPSEC] or alternate
    OSPFv3\n   Authentication Trailer [OSPFV3-AUTH-TRAILER] algorithms MAY be used\n
    \  at the expense of additional configuration.  The configuration and\n   operational
    description of such deployments are beyond the scope of\n   this document.  However,
    a deployment could always revert to explicit\n   configuration as described in
    Section 9 for features such as IPsec,\n   per-interface keys, or alternate authentication
    algorithms.\n   The introduction, either malicious or accidental, of an OSPFv3
    router\n   with a duplicate Router ID is an attack point for OSPFv3 routing\n
    \  domains.  This is due to the fact that OSPFv3 routers will interpret\n   LSAs
    advertised by the router with the same Router ID as self-\n   originated LSAs
    and attempt to flush them from the routing domain.\n   The mechanisms in Section
    7.4 will mitigate the effects of\n   duplication.\n"
  title: 8.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "9.  Management Considerations\n   It is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv3 routers supporting
    this specification\n   also support explicit configuration of OSPFv3 parameters
    as specified\n   in Appendix C of [OSPFV3].  This would allow explicit override
    of\n   autoconfigured parameters in situations where it is required (e.g.,\n   if
    the deployment requires multiple OSPFv3 areas).  This is in\n   addition to the
    authentication key configuration recommended in\n   Section 4.  Additionally,
    it is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv3 routers\n   supporting this specification allow
    autoconfiguration to be\n   completely disabled.\n   Since there is a small possibility
    of OSPFv3 Router ID collisions,\n   manual configuration of OSPFv3 Router IDs
    is RECOMMENDED in OSPFv3\n   routing domains where route convergence due to a
    Router ID change is\n   intolerable.\n   OSPFv3 routers supporting this specification
    MUST augment mechanisms\n   for displaying or otherwise conveying OSPFv3 operational
    state to\n   indicate whether or not the OSPFv3 router was autoconfigured and\n
    \  whether or not its OSPFv3 interfaces have been autoconfigured.\n"

  - "10.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification defines an OSPFv3 LSA Type for
    the OSPFv3\n   Autoconfiguration (AC) LSA, as described in Section 7.2.1.  The
    value\n   15 has been allocated from the existing \"OSPFv3 LSA Function Codes\"\n
    \  registry for the OSPFv3 Autoconfiguration (AC) LSA.\n   This specification
