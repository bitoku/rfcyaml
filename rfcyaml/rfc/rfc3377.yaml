- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the set of RFCs comprising the Lightweight\n\
    \   Directory Access Protocol Version 3 (LDAPv3), and addresses the \"IESG\n \
    \  Note\" attached to RFCs 2251 through 2256.\n"
- title: 1.  Background and Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.  Background and Motivation\n   The specification for the Lightweight Directory\
    \ Access Protocol\n   version 3 (LDAPv3) nominally comprises eight RFCs which\
    \ were issued\n   in two distinct subsets at separate times -- RFCs 2251 through\
    \ 2256\n   first, then RFCs 2829 and 2830 following later.\n   RFC 2251 through\
    \ 2256 do not mandate the implementation of any\n   satisfactory authentication\
    \ mechanisms and hence were published with\n   an \"IESG Note\" discouraging implementation\
    \ and deployment of LDAPv3\n   clients or servers implementing update functionality\
    \ until a Proposed\n   Standard for mandatory authentication in LDAPv3 is published.\n\
    \   RFC 2829 was subsequently published in answer to the IESG Note.\n   The purpose\
    \ of this document is to explicitly specify the set of RFCs\n   comprising LDAPv3,\
    \ and formally address the IESG Note through\n   explicit inclusion of RFC 2829.\n"
- title: 2.  Specification of LDAPv3
  contents:
  - "2.  Specification of LDAPv3\n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version\
    \ 3 (LDAPv3) is\n   specified by this set of nine RFCs:\n      [RFC2251]  Lightweight\
    \ Directory Access Protocol (v3) [the\n                 specification of the LDAP\
    \ on-the-wire protocol]\n      [RFC2252]  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\
    \ (v3):  Attribute\n                 Syntax Definitions\n      [RFC2253]  Lightweight\
    \ Directory Access Protocol (v3):  UTF-8\n                 String Representation\
    \ of Distinguished Names\n      [RFC2254]  The String Representation of LDAP Search\
    \ Filters\n      [RFC2255]  The LDAP URL Format\n      [RFC2256]  A Summary of\
    \ the X.500(96) User Schema for use with\n                 LDAPv3\n      [RFC2829]\
    \  Authentication Methods for LDAP\n      [RFC2830]  Lightweight Directory Access\
    \ Protocol (v3):  Extension\n                 for Transport Layer Security\n \
    \     And, this document (RFC3377).\n   The term \"LDAPv3\" is often used informally\
    \ to refer to the protocol\n   specified by the above set of RFCs, or subsets\
    \ thereof.  However, the\n   LDAPv3 protocol suite, as defined here, should be\
    \ formally identified\n   in other documents by a normative reference to this\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 3.  Addressing the "IESG Note" in RFCs 2251 through 2256
  contents:
  - "3.  Addressing the \"IESG Note\" in RFCs 2251 through 2256\n   The IESG approved\
    \ publishing RFCs 2251 through 2256 with an attendant\n   IESG Note included in\
    \ each document.  The Note begins with:\n      This document describes a directory\
    \ access protocol that provides\n      both read and update access.  Update access\
    \ requires secure\n      authentication, but this document does not mandate implementation\n\
    \      of any satisfactory authentication mechanisms.\n   The Note ends with this\
    \ statement:\n      Implementors are hereby discouraged from deploying LDAPv3\
    \ clients\n      or servers which implement the update functionality, until a\n\
    \      Proposed Standard for mandatory authentication in LDAPv3 has been\n   \
    \   approved and published as an RFC.\n   [RFC2829] is expressly the \"Proposed\
    \ Standard for mandatory\n   authentication in LDAPv3\" called for in the Note.\
    \  Thus, the IESG\n   Note in [RFC2251], [RFC2252], [RFC2253], [RFC2254], [RFC2255],\
    \ and\n   [RFC2256] is addressed.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not directly discuss security,\
    \ although the\n   context of the aforementioned IESG Note is security related,\
    \ as is\n   the manner in which it is addressed.\n   Please refer to the referenced\
    \ documents, especially [RFC2829],\n   [RFC2251], and [RFC2830], for further information\
    \ concerning LDAPv3\n   security.\n"
