- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the body that\
    \ is\n   responsible for the development and maintenance of the Internet\n   Standards.\
    \ Traditionally the IETF is a volunteer organization. The\n   driving force is\
    \ dedicated high quality engineers from all over the\n   world. In a structure\
    \ of working groups these engineers exchange\n   ideas and experience, and through\
    \ discussion (both by e-mail and face\n   to face) they strive to get rough consensus.\
    \ The engineers then work\n   on building running code to put the consensus to\
    \ the test and evolve\n   it into an Internet Standard.\n   The growth of the\
    \ Internet has also led to a growth of the IETF. More\n   and more people, organizations\
    \ and companies rely on Internet\n   Standards. The growth of responsibility as\
    \ well as amount of\n   participants has forced the IETF to more and more structure\
    \ its\n   processes. Non technical issues, such as legal issues, liaison issues\n\
    \   etc., have become an undesirable but a seemingly unavoidable part of\n   the\
    \ IETF organization. To address these issues the IETF established\n   the Poised95\
    \ working group. The working group is now trying to\n   structure and document\
    \ the IETF processes in such a way as to keep\n   the maximum flexibility and\
    \ freedom for the engineers in the IETF to\n   work in the way the IETF has always\
    \ been most successful, and to\n   honour the IETF credo: \"Rough consensus and\
    \ running code\".\n   One of the more obvious recommendations that came out of\
    \ the Poised\n   WG was to move all non technical issues that can be moved safely,\
    \ to\n   another related organization. The Poised WG finds that the Internet\n\
    \   Society (ISOC) is the obvious choice for this task. A straw poll at\n   the\
    \ open plenary session of the IETF in december 1995 in Dallas\n   clearly confirmed\
    \ this notion.\n   However, since this is an issue that is crucial to the functioning\
    \ of\n   the IETF as a whole it is necessary to get a broad (rather than a\n \
    \  rough) consensus on this issue. At the same time it is necessary to\n   clearly\
    \ indicate the extend of the relationship between the IETF and\n   ISOC. So both\
    \ the IETF participants and the ISOC board of trustees\n   get a clear picture\
    \ on the division of responsibilities.\n   The details of the Poised WG recommendations\
    \ on the IETF - ISOC\n   relationships can be found in the appropriate places\
    \ in a series of\n   Poised documents in progress: - The IETF Standards Process\
    \ - The IETF\n   organizational structure - The IETF charter - The Nomcom procedures\
    \ -\n   The Appeals procedures\n   The current document is meant to summarize\
    \ the Poised WG\n   recommendations in order to gauge the consensus. This document\
    \ does\n   not have, and is not intended to get, a formal status. The current\n\
    \   and upcoming working documents of the Poised WG will become the\n   formal\
    \ documents. Readers who are interested in the nitty gritty\n   details are referred\
    \ to these working documents of the Poised WG.\n"
- title: Main boundary condition
  contents:
  - "Main boundary condition\n   The IETF remains responsible for the development\
    \ and quality of the\n   Internet Standards. The ISOC will aid the IETF by facilitating\
    \ legal\n   and organizational issues as described below. Apart from the roles\n\
    \   described below, the IETF and ISOC acknowledge that the ISOC has no\n   influence\
    \ whatsoever on the Internet Standards process, the Internet\n   Standards or\
    \ their technical content.\n   All subgroups in the IETF and ISOC that have an\
    \ official role in the\n   standards process should be either:\n   - open to anyone\
    \ (like Working Groups); or\n   - have a well documented restricted membership\
    \ in which the\n     voting members are elected or nominated through an open process.\n\
    \   The latter means that within the IETF the IAB and the IESG need to be\n  \
    \ formed through a nomination process that is acceptable to the IETF\n   community\
    \ and that gives all IETF participants an equal chance to be\n   candidate for\
    \ a position in either of these bodies. For the ISOC this\n   means that the Board\
    \ of Trustees should be elected by the ISOC\n   individual membership, where all\
    \ individual members have an equal\n   vote and all individual members have an\
    \ equal opportunity to stand as\n   a candidate for a position on the Board of\
    \ Trustees.\n   ISOC will, like the IETF use public discussion and consensus building\n\
    \   processes when it wants to develop new policies or regulations that\n   may\
    \ influence the role of ISOC in the Internet or the Internet\n   Technical work.\
    \ ISOC will always put work related to Internet\n   standards, Internet technical\
    \ issues or Internet operations up for\n   discussion in the IETF through the\
    \ IETF Internet-drafts publication\n   process.\n"
- title: The legal umbrella
  contents:
  - "The legal umbrella\n   To avoid the fact that the IETF has to construct its own\
    \ legal\n   structure to protect the standards and the standards process, ISOC\n\
    \   should provide a legal umbrella. The legal umbrella will at least\n   cover:\n\
    \   - legal insurance for all IETF officers (IAB, IESG, Nomcom and WG\n      chairs);\n\
    \   - legal protection of the RFC series of documents; In such a way\n     that\
    \ these documents can be freely (i.e. no restrictions\n     financially or otherwise)\
    \ distributed, copied etc. but cannot\n     be altered or misused. And that the\
    \ right to change the document\n     lies with the IETF.\n   - legal protection\
    \ in case of Intellectual property rights disputes\n     over Internet Standards\
    \ or parts thereof.\n"
- title: The standards process role
  contents:
  - "The standards process role\n   ISOC will assist the standards process by\n  \
    \   - appointing the nomcom chair\n     - approving IAB candidates\n     - reviewing\
    \ and approving the documents that describe the standards\n       process (i.e.\
    \ the formal Poised documents).\n     - acting as the last resort in the appeals\
    \ process\n"
- title: Security considerations
  contents:
  - "Security considerations\n   By involving ISOC into specific parts of the Standards\
    \ process, the\n   IETF has no longer absolute control. It can be argued that\
    \ this is a\n   breach of security. It is therefore necessary to make sure that\
    \ the\n   ISOC involvement is restricted to well defined and understood parts,\n\
    \   at well defined and understood boundary conditions. The Poised WG\n   attempts\
    \ to define these, and they are summarised in this document.\n   There are three\
    \ alternatives:\n   - Do nothing and ignore the increasing responsibility and\
    \ growth; the\n     risk here is that the IETF either becomes insignificant, or\
    \ will be\n     suffocated by US law suits.\n   - The IETF does everything itself;\
    \ this keeps the IETf in control,\n     but it would distract enormously from\
    \ the technical work the IETF\n     is trying to get done.\n   - The IETF finds\
    \ another organization than ISOC to take on the role\n     described above. But\
    \ why would another organization be better than\n     ISOC?\n   All in all a certain\
    \ risk seems unavoidable, and a relationship with\n   ISOC, under the restrictions\
    \ and boundary conditions as have been\n   described above, seems more like an\
    \ opportunity for the IETF than\n   like a risk.\n"
