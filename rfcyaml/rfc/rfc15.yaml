  - "Introduction\n   A set of network primitives has been defined (Network Working\
    \ Group\n   Note 11) for inclusion in the monitor systems of the respective\n\
    \   HOSTS.  These primitives are at the level of system calls: SPOP's or\n   BRS's\
    \ on the 940; UUO's on the PDP-10.  Presumably these UUO's are\n   accessible\
    \ to all user programs when executing for users whose status\n   bits allow network\
    \ access.\n   In addition to user program access, a convenient means for direct\n\
    \   network access from the terminal is desirable.  A sub-system called\n   \"\
    Telnet\" is proposed which is a shell program around the network\n   system primitives,\
    \ allowing a teletype or similar terminal at a\n   remote host to function as\
    \ a teletype at the serving host.\n"

  - "System Primitives\n   G. Deloche of U.C.L.A. has documented a proposed set of\
    \ basic network\n   primitives for inclusion in the operating systems of the respective\n\
    \   HOSTs (NWG Note:  11).  The primitives are:\n      Open primary connection\n\
    \      Open auxiliary connection\n      Transmit over connection\n      Close\
    \ connection.\n   The details  and terminology are defined by Deloche and others\
    \ in\n   previous memos.  The primitives are system calls, available to\n   programmers,\
    \ and are most likely a part of the resident monitor,\n   rather than the swappable\
    \ executive.\n"
- title: Basic Terminal Access
  contents:
  - "Basic Terminal Access\n   In addition to user programming access, it is desirable\
    \ to have a\n   subsystem program at each HOST which makes the network immediately\n\
    \   accessible from the teletype without special programming.  Subsystems\n  \
    \ are commonly used system components such as text editors, compilers\n   and\
    \ interpreters.  The first network-related subsystem should allow\n   users at\
    \ HOST A to connect to HOST B and appear as a regular terminal\n   user to HOST\
    \ B.  It is expected that more sophisticated subsystems\n   will be developed\
    \ in time, but this basic one will render the early\n   net immediately useful.\n\
