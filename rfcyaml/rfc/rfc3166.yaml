- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 1403, \"BGP OSPF Interaction\", describes technology which is\
    \ no\n   longer used.  This document requests that RFC 1403 be moved to\n   Historic\
    \ status.\n"
- title: 1. Details
  contents:
  - "1. Details\n   During a review of internet standards relating to BGP, it became\n\
    \   apparent that BGP OSPF interaction, as described in RFC 1403, is not\n   common\
    \ usage (if at all), and requires significant implementation\n   complexity. \
    \ Since this mechanism has not been in use in the public\n   internet for many\
    \ years (if ever), it is proposed to reclassify it to\n   Historic.\n"
