Abstract This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines managed objects for the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES)
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].
The ForCES MIB module is a read only MIB module that captures information related to the ForCES protocol ([RFC3654], [RFC3746], [FORCES APP], and [RFC5810]).
The ForCES MIB module does not include information that is specified in other MIB modules, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.
More specifically, the information in the ForCES MIB module relative to associations (between Control Elements and Forwarding Elements) that are in the UP state includes:  identifiers of the elements in the association,  configuration parameters of the association, and  statistics of the association.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The MIB module contains the latest ForCES protocol version supported by the Control Element (CE) (forcesLatestProtocolVersionSupported).
Note that the CE must also allow interaction with Forwarding Elements (FEs) supporting earlier versions.
For each association identified by the pair CE ID and FE ID, the following associated information is provided by the MIB module as an entry (forcesAssociationEntry) in the association table (forcesAssociationTable):  Version number of the ForCES protocol running in this association (forcesAssociationRunningProtocolVersion).
Time when the association entered the UP state (forcesAssociationTimeUp).
Time when the association left the UP state (forcesAssociationTimeDown).
Note that this is only used for notification purposes as the association is removed from the MIB immediately after it leaves the UP state.
Number of ForCES Heartbeat messages sent from the CE (forcesAssociationHBMsgSent) and received by the CE (forcesAssociationHBMsgReceived) since the association entered the UP state.
Number of operational ForCES messages sent from the CE (forcesAssociationOperMsgSent) and received by the CE (forcesAssociationOperMsgReceived) since the association entered the UP state.
Only messages other than Heartbeat, Association Setup, Association Setup Response, and Association Teardown are counted.
Finally, the MIB module defines the following notifications:  Whenever an association enters the UP state, a notification (forcesAssociationEntryUp) is issued containing the version of the ForCES protocol running.
CE ID and FE ID are concatenated to form the table index, hence they appear in the OID of the ForCES  protocol running version object.
Optionally, a notification (forcesAssociationEntryUpStats) can instead be issued with all associated information for this association, except forcesAssociationTimeDown.
Whenever an association leaves the UP state, a notification (forcesAssociationEntryDown) is issued containing the version of the ForCES protocol running.
Optionally, a notification (forcesAssociationEntryDownStats) can instead be issued with all associated information for this association.
The reason is that the association and all its associated information will be removed from the MIB immediately after this notification has been issued.

"The ForCES identifier is a 4 octet quantity.
The version numbers used are defined in the specifications of the respective protocol: 1 ForCESv1, RFC 5810."
"This notification is generated as soon as an association enters the UP state.
Note that these notifications are not throttled as the CE itself should throttle the setup of associations."
"This notification is generated as soon as an association leaves the UP state.

The ForCES protocol version supported by the CE.

forcesNotificationGroup NOTIFICATION GROUP NOTIFICATIONS { forcesAssociationEntryUp, forcesAssociationEntryDown } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"A collection of optional objects to provide extra information about the associations.
There is no protocol reason to keep such information, but these objects can be very useful in debugging connectivity problems."
Associations Kept in the MIB Associations enter the UP state as soon as the CE has sent to the FE an Association Setup Response message containing a successful Association Setup Result.
Only associations that are UP are reflected in this MIB module.
Associations are removed from the MIB module as soon as they leave the UP state, i.e., if the CE has not received any message (Heartbeat or other protocol message) from the FE within a given time period or if an Association Teardown message has been sent by the CE.
Statistics counters are initialized to zero when the association is created.
If the same association goes down and comes back up, the counters will reset and the discontinuity can be discovered by checking the discontinuity timestamp.
In addition, the time up timestamp in the association allows to distinguish new associations from past ones with the same index.
Note that the optional down notification contains the statistics with the final values of the statistics counters.
Support for Multiple CEs and FEs
An NE consists of one or more FEs and one or more CEs.
Where there is a single CE, that CE will have knowledge of all the associations in the NE and so can provide the information necessary to support the managed objects defined in this MIB module.
Where there is more than one CE, information about the associations may be distributed among the CEs.
Whether each CE implements the managed objects for the associations of which it is aware or whether the CEs cooperate to present the appearance of a single set of managed objects for all the associations in the NE is outside the scope of this document.
There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
So, if this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct SNMP SET operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
Objects in the forcesMibGroup are protocol versions.
They are neither sensitive nor vulnerable.
Objects in the forcesStatsGroup are statistics.
They are neither sensitive nor vulnerable.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
