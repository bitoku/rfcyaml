- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping [1]) is a system that transforms\
    \ E.164\n   numbers [2] into domain names and then uses the DNS (Domain Name\n\
    \   Service) [3] to discover NAPTR records that specify what services are\n  \
    \ available for a specific domain name.\n   ENUM as originally defined was based\
    \ on the end-user opt-in\n   principle.  While this has great potential to foster\
    \ new services and\n   end-user choices in the long term, the current requirements\
    \ for\n   IP-based interconnection of Voice over IP (VoIP) domains require the\n\
    \   provisioning of large numbers of allocated or served (hosted) numbers\n  \
    \ of a participating service provider, without the need for individual\n   users\
    \ to opt-in.  This way, service providers can provision their own\n   ENUM information\
    \ that is separate, distinct, and likely to be\n   different from what an end-user\
    \ may provision.  This is particularly\n   important if Infrastructure ENUM is\
    \ used for number-portability\n   applications, for example, which an end-user\
    \ would be unlikely\n   interested in provisioning but which a service provider\
    \ would likely\n   find essential.\n   In addition, while it is possible that\
    \ service providers could\n   mandate that their users opt-into e164.arpa through\
    \ end-user contract\n   terms and conditions, there are substantial downsides\
    \ to such an\n   approach.  Thus, for all these reasons and many others, ENUM\
    \ for\n   end-user provisioning is ill-suited for use by service providers for\n\
    \   the interconnection of VoIP domains.\n   As VoIP evolves and becomes pervasive,\
    \ E.164-addressed telephone\n   calls need not necessarily traverse the Public\
    \ Switched Telephone\n   Network (PSTN).  Therefore, VoIP service providers have\
    \ an interest\n   in using ENUM on a so-called \"Infrastructure\" basis in order\
    \ to keep\n   VoIP traffic on IP networks on an end-to-end basis, both within\
    \ and\n   between service provider domains.  This requires a means of\n   identifying\
    \ a VoIP point of interconnection to which calls addressed\n   to a given E.164\
    \ number may be delivered; Infrastructure ENUM\n   provides this means.  Calls\
    \ that can originate and terminate on IP\n   networks, and do not have to traverse\
    \ the PSTN, will require fewer or\n   no points of transcoding, and can also involve\
    \ additional IP network\n   services that are not possible on the PSTN, among\
    \ other benefits.\n   Requirements for Infrastructure ENUM are provided in [4].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119 [5].\n"
- title: 3.  Zone Apex for Infrastructure ENUM
  contents:
  - "3.  Zone Apex for Infrastructure ENUM\n   This document proposes that Infrastructure\
    \ ENUM be implemented by\n   means of a parallel namespace to e164.arpa dedicated\
    \ to\n   Infrastructure ENUM, in a domain that is yet to be determined.  Use\n\
    \   of a parallel namespace allows carriers and end-users to control\n   their\
    \ ENUM registrations independently, without forcing one to work\n   through the\
    \ other.\n   Infrastructure ENUM Tier 2 resource records in the Infrastructure\n\
    \   ENUM tree will be controlled by the service provider that is\n   providing\
    \ services to a given E.164 number, generally referred to in\n   various countries\
    \ as the \"carrier-of-record\" (see [4]).  The\n   definition of a carrier-of-record\
    \ for a given E.164 number is a\n   national matter or is defined by the entity\
    \ controlling the numbering\n   space.\n   See also Section 3, \"Requirements\
    \ for Infrastructure ENUM\", of [4].\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created a registry for Enumservices as originally\
    \ specified\n   in RFC 2916 and revised in RFC 3761.  Enumservices registered\
    \ with\n   IANA are valid for Infrastructure ENUM as well as end-user ENUM.\n"
- title: 5.  Security and Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security and Privacy Considerations\n   This document proposes a new zone\
    \ apex for ENUM to meet the\n   requirements of Infrastructure ENUM.  The over-the-network\
    \ protocol\n   of ENUM is unchanged by the addition of an apex and, as such, the\n\
    \   Security Considerations of RFC 3761 [1] still apply.  Specific\n   considerations\
    \ related to the security of an Infrastructure ENUM apex\n   are given in more\
    \ detail in Section 4, \"Security Considerations\", of\n   [4].\n   Infrastructure\
    \ ENUM registrations proposed by this document should\n   resolve to service provider\
    \ points-of-interconnection rather than to\n   end-user equipment.  Service providers\
    \ need to take appropriate\n   measures to protect their end-user customers from\
    \ unwanted\n   communications as with other types of interconnections.\n"
