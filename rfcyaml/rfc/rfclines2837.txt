Abstract This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines the objects for managing the operations of the Fabric Element portion of the Fibre Channel Standards.
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
Overview A Fibre Channel Fabric is an entity which interconnects Node Ports (N Ports) or Node Loop Ports (NL Ports).
It provides transport and routing functions.
In essence, a Fabric is a network of N Ports and/or NL Ports to communicate with one another.
A Fabric is composed of one or more Fabric Element that are interconnected via Inter element Links (IEL).
A Fabric Element is the smallest unit of a Fabric that meets the definition of a Fabric.
It must consist of at least three external ports to connect to either N Ports, NL Ports or other Fabric Elements.
In general, a Fabric Element port may be of one of the following types:
FL Port, a fabric port that also supports a FC Arbitrated Loop consisting of one or more NL Ports ([20], [24]).
E Port, an expansion port to connect to another Fabric Element ([18], [23]); This memo shall define objects related to a Fabric Element, its F Ports and FL Ports.
Objects related to other types of FC ports shall be defined in future.
For the rest of the document, the term, "FxPort", will be used to refer to both F Port and FL Port where the distinction is not necessary.
The term, "NxPort" will be used to refer to both N Port and NL Port in the similar fashion.
Management View of a Fabric Element From the management perspective, it is helpful to view a Fabric Element to be consisting of multiple "modules".
Each module is a grouping, either physical or logical, of one or more ports that may be managed as a sub entity within the Fabric Element.
This module mapping is recommended but optional.
A vendor may elect to put all ports into a single module, or to divide the ports into modules that do not match physical divisions.
The object fcFeModuleCapacity indicates the maximum number of modules that a given Fabric Element may contain.
This value must remain constant from one management restart to the next.
Each module is uniquely identified by a module number in the range of 1 through fcFeModuleCapacity inclusive.
Modules may come and go without causing a management reset (of sysUpTime), and may be sparsely numbered within the Fabric Element.
That is, the module numbering is not required to be contiguous.
For instance, if a module is mapped physically to a field replaceable card and in a 13  card cage Fabric Element, cards 3, 5, 6 and 7 may be installed.
The vendor may choose to label them as modules 3, 5, 6 and 7 respectively.
In this example, the value of fcFeModuleCapacity is 13.
Note that the object fcFeModuleLastChange acts as the discontinuity indicator for all counter objects in this MIB.
A Fabric Element may also provide a proxy management on behalf of another management entity by presenting it as one of its Fabric Element modules.
The object fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity indicates the maximum number of ports that a given module may contain.
The value of fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity must not change for a given module.
However, a module may be deleted from the Fabric Element and replaced with a module containing a different number of ports.
The value of fcFeModuleLastChange will indicate that a change took place.
Each port within the Fabric Element is uniquely identified by a combination of module index and port index, where port index is an integer in the range (1..fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity).
As with modules within a Fabric Element, ports within a module may be sparsely numbered.
the port numbering is not required to be contiguous.
Likewise, ports may come and go within a module without causing a management reset.
In terms of attachment, an F Port will be attached to another N Port; and an FL Port will be attached to one or up to 126 NL Ports.
In general, an FxPort may be attached to one or more NxPorts.
Each NxPort associated with an FxPort will be uniquely identified by a combination of module index, FxPort index and NxPort index.
An NxPort index is an integer in the range (1..126).
The following diagram illustrates the management view of a Fabric Element.
Structure of the Fabric Element MIB
This memo assumes that a Fabric Element has an SNMP entity associated with its managed objects.
The managed objects are divided as follow:
the Configuration group the Status group the Error group the Accounting group the Capability group In each group, scalar objects and table entries are defined.
The Configuration group contains configuration and service parameters for the Fabric Element, modules and the FxPorts.
The Operation group contains the operational status and parameters of an FxPort.
The group also contains the service parameters that have been established between the FxPort and its attached NxPort, if applicable.
The Error group contains counters tracking various types of errors detected by each FxPort.
The information may be used for diagnostics and/or to derive the quality of the link between an FxPort and one or more attached NxPorts.
The Accounting group contains statistic data suitable for deriving accounting and performance information.
The Capability group contains parameters indicating the inherent capability of the Fabric Element and each FxPort. 3.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
by itself is not a secure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
