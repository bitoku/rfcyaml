  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPP was designed as a standard method of communicating over\n
    \  point-to-point links.  Initial deployment has been over short local\n   lines,
    leased lines, and plain-old-telephone-service (POTS) using\n   modems.  As new
    packet services and higher speed lines are introduced,\n   PPP is easily deployed
    in these environments as well.\n   This specification is primarily concerned with
    the use of the PPP\n   encapsulation over SONET/SDH links.  Since SONET/SDH is
    by definition\n   a point-to-point circuit, PPP is well suited to use over these
    links.\n   Real differences between SONET and SDH (other than terminology) are\n
    \  minor; for the purposes of encapsulation of PPP over SONET/SDH, they\n   are
    inconsequential or irrelevant.\n   For the convenience of the reader, we list
    the equivalent terms below:\n       SONET                   SDH\n   ---------------------------------------------\n

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Physical Layer Requirements\n   PPP treats SONET/SDH transport as octet oriented
    synchronous links.\n   SONET/SDH links are full-duplex by definition.\n   Interface
    Format\n      PPP in HDLC-like framing presents an octet interface to the\n      physical
    layer.  There is no provision for sub-octets to be\n      supplied or accepted
    [3][5].\n      The octet stream is mapped into the SONET STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order\n
    \     VC, with the octet boundaries aligned with the SONET STS-SPE/SDH\n      Higher
    Order VC octet boundaries.\n      Scrambling is performed during insertion into
    the SONET STS-\n      SPE/SDH Higher Order VC to provide adequate transparency
    and\n      protect against potential security threats (see Section 6).  For\n
    \     backwards compatibility with RFC 1619 (STS-3c-SPE/VC-4 only), the\n      scrambler
    MAY have an on/off capability where the scrambler is\n      bypassed entirely
    when it is in the off mode.  If this capability\n      is provided, the default
    MUST be set to scrambling enabled.\n      For PPP over SONET/SDH, the entire SONET/SDH
    payload (SONET STS-\n      SPE/SDH Higher Order VC minus the path overhead and
    any fixed\n      stuff) is scrambled using a self-synchronous scrambler of\n      polynomial
    X**43 + 1.  See Section 4 for the description of the\n      scrambler.\n      The
    proper order of operation is:\n      When transmitting:\n         IP -> PPP ->
    FCS generation -> Byte stuffing -> Scrambling  ->\n         SONET/SDH framing\n
    \     When receiving:\n         SONET/SDH framing -> Descrambling -> Byte destuffing
    -> FCS\n         detection -> PPP -> IP\n   The Path Signal Label (C2) indicates
    the contents of the SONET STS-\n   SPE/SDH Higher Order VC.  The value of 22 (16
    hex) is used to\n   indicate PPP with X^43 + 1 scrambling [4].\n   For compatibility
    with RFC 1619 (STS-3c-SPE/VC-4 only), if scrambling\n   has been configured to
    be off, then the value 207 (CF hex) is used\n   for the Path Signal Label to indicate
    PPP without scrambling.\n   The Multiframe Indicator (H4) is unused, and MUST
    be zero.\n   Control Signals\n      PPP does not require the use of control signals.
    \ When available,\n      using such signals can allow greater functionality and\n
    \     performance.  Implications are discussed in [2].\n"

  - "3.  Framing\n   The framing for octet-synchronous links is described in \"PPP
    in\n   HDLC-like Framing\" [2].\n   The PPP frames are located by row within the
    SONET STS-SPE/SDH Higher\n   Order VC payload.  Because frames are variable in
    length, the frames\n   are allowed to cross SONET STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order VC
    boundaries.\n"

    \                                            Unscrambled Data\n   Note: While
    the HDLC FCS is calculated least significant bit first as\n   shown:\n              <-
    \ <-  <-  <-\n              A   B   C   D\n   (that is, the FCS calculator is
    fed as follows: A[0], A[1], ... A[7],\n   B[0], B[1], etc...),  scrambling is
    done in the opposite manner, most\n   significant bit first, as shown:\n               ->
    \ ->  ->  ->\n               A   B   C   D.\n   That is, the scrambler is fed
    as follows: A[7], A[6], ... A[0], B[7],\n   B[6], etc...\n   The scrambler operates
    continuously through the bytes of the SONET\n   STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order VC, bypassing
    bytes of SONET Path Overhead\n   and any fixed stuff (see Figure 20 of ANSI T1.105
    [3] or Figure 10-17\n   of ITU G.707 [5]).  The scrambling state at the beginning
    of a SONET\n   STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order VC is the state at the end of the previous\n
    \  SONET STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order VC.  Thus, the scrambler runs\n   continuously
    and is not reset per frame. The initial seed is randomly\n   chosen by transmitter
    to improve operational security (see Section\n   6).  Consequently, the first
    43 transmitted bits following startup or\n   reframe operation will not be descrambled
    correctly.\n"

    LCP sync\n   configuration defaults apply to SONET/SDH links.\n   The following
    Configuration Options are RECOMMENDED for STS-3c-\n   SPE/VC-4:\n      Magic Number\n
    \     No Address and Control Field Compression\n      No Protocol Field Compression\n
    \  For operation at STS-12c-SPE/VC-4-4c and above, Address and Control\n   Field
    Compression and Protocol Field Compression are NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   The Magic
    Number option remains RECOMMENDED.\n   Regarding the FCS length, with one exception,
    the 32-bit FCS MUST be\n   used for all SONET/SDH rates. For STS-3c-SPE/VC-4 only,
    the 16-bit\n   FCS MAY be used, although the 32-bit FCS is RECOMMENDED.  The FCS\n
    \  length is set by provisioning and is not negotiated.\n"
  title: 5.  Configuration Details

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The major change from RFC 1619 is the addition
    of payload scrambling\n   when inserting the HDLC-like framed PPP packets into
    the SONET STS-\n   SPE/SDH Higher Order VC.  RFC 1619 was operationally found
    to permit\n   malicious users to generate packets with bit patterns that could\n
    \  create SONET/SDH-layer low-transition-density synchronization\n   problems,
    emulation of the SDH set-reset scrambler pattern, and\n   replication of the STM-N
    frame alignment word.\n   The use of the x^43 + 1 self-synchronous scrambler was
    introduced to\n   alleviate these potential security problems.  Predicting the
    output\n   of the scrambler requires knowledge of the 43-bit state of the\n   transmitter
    as the scrambling of a known input is begun.  This\n   requires knowledge of both
    the initial 43-bit state of the scrambler\n   when it started and every byte of
    data scrambled by the device since\n   it was started.  The odds of guessing correctly
    are 1/2**43, with the\n   additional probability of 1/127 that a correct guess
    will leave the\n   frame properly aligned in the SONET/SDH payload, which results
    in a\n   probability of 9e-16 against being able to deliberately cause\n   SONET/SDH-layer
    problems.  This seems reasonably secure for this\n   application.\n   This scrambler
    is also used when transmitting ATM over SONET/SDH, and\n   public network carriers
    have considerable experience with its use.\n   A known security issue is bandwidth
    reduction by intentional\n   transmission of characters or sequences requiring
    transparency\n   processing by including flag and/or escape characters in user
    data. A\n   user may cause up to a 100% increase in the bandwidth required for\n
    \  transmitting his or her packets by filling the packet with flag\n   and/or
    escape characters.\n"

  - "7.  Changes from RFC 1619\n   As mentioned in the previous section, the major
    change from RFC 1619\n   was the addition of payload scrambling when inserting
    the HDLC-like\n   framed PPP packets into the SONET STS-SPE/SDH Higher Order VC.
    \ Other\n   changes were:\n   The terminology was updated to better match that
    used by ANSI and\n   ITU-T.\n   The specification's applicability is now specifically

    \  The Path Signal Label (C2) is set to 22 (16 hex) when using X^43 + 1\n   scrambling.\n
    \  The 32-bit FCS is required except for operation with STS-3c-SPE/VC-4,\n   in
