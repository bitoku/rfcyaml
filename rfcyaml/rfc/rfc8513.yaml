    title: 1.1.  Terminology
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  DS-Lite YANG Module: An Overview\n   As shown in Figure 1:\n   o  The AFTR
    element is a combination of an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel and a\n      NAPT function
    (Section 2.2 of [RFC3022]).\n   o  The B4 element is an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.\n
    \  Therefore, the DS-Lite YANG module is designed to augment both the\n   Interfaces
    YANG module [RFC8343] and the NAT YANG module [RFC8512]\n   with DS-Lite-specific
    features.\n   The YANG \"feature\" statement is used to distinguish which of the\n
    \  DS-Lite elements ('aftr' or 'b4') is relevant for a specific data\n   node.\n
    \  Concretely, the DS-Lite YANG module (Figure 2) augments the\n   Interfaces
    YANG module with the following:\n   o  An IPv6 address used by the tunnel endpoint
    (AFTR or B4) for\n      sending and receiving IPv4-in-IPv6 packets (ipv6-address).\n
    \  o  An IPv4 address that is used by the tunnel endpoint (AFTR or B4)\n      for
    troubleshooting purposes (ipv4-address).\n   o  An IPv6 address used by a B4 element
    to reach its AFTR (aftr-\n      ipv6-addr).\n   o  The tunnel MTU used to avoid
    fragmentation (tunnel-mtu).\n   o  A policy to instruct the tunnel endpoint (AFTR
    or B4) whether it\n      must preserve Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
    marking\n      when encapsulating/decapsulating packets (v6-v4-dscp-\n      preservation).\n
    \  In addition, the DS-Lite YANG module augments the NAT YANG module\n   (policy,
    in particular) with the following:\n   o  A policy to limit the number of DS-Lite
    softwires per subscriber\n      (max-softwire-per-subscriber).\n   o  A policy
    to instruct the AFTR whether a state can be automatically\n      migrated (state-migrate).\n
    \  o  Further, in order to prevent a Denial of Service (DoS) by\n      frequently
    changing the source IPv6 address, 'b4-address-change-\n      limit' is used to
    rate-limit such changes.\n   o  An instruction to rewrite the TCP Maximum Segment
    Size (MSS)\n      option (mss-clamping) to avoid TCP fragmentation.\n   Given
    that the NAPT table of the AFTR element is extended to include\n   the source
    IPv6 address of incoming packets, the DS-Lite YANG module\n   augments the NAPT44
    mapping entry with the following:\n   o  b4-ipv6-address, which is used to record
    the source IPv6 address\n      of a packet received from a B4 element.  This IPv6
    address is\n      required to disambiguate between the overlapping IPv4 address\n
    \     space of subscribers.\n   o  The value of the Traffic Class field in the
    IPv6 header as\n      received from a B4 element (v6-dscp): This information is
    used to\n      preserve DSCP marking when encapsulating/decapsulating at the\n
    \     AFTR.\n   o  The IPv4 DSCP marking of the IPv4 packet received from a B4\n
    \     element (internal-v4-dscp): This information can be used by the\n      AFTR
    for setting the DSCP of packets relayed to a B4 element.\n   o  The IPv4 DSCP
    marking as set by the AFTR in its external interface\n      (external-v4-dscp):
    An AFTR can be instructed to preserve the same\n      marking or to set it to
    another value when forwarding an IPv4\n      packet destined to a remote IPv4
    host.\n   Access Control List (ACL) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) policies\n   discussed
    in Section 2.5 of [RFC6908] are out of scope.  A YANG\n   module for ACLs is documented
    in [ACL-YANG].\n   Likewise, considerations that are related to the Port Control\n
    \  Protocol (PCP) and discussed in Section 8.5 of [RFC6333] are out of\n   scope.
    \ A YANG module for PCP is documented in [YANG-PCP].\n   The YANG module \"ietf-dslite\"

  title: 3.  DS-Lite YANG Module
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The YANG module specified in this document defines
    a schema for data\n   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols
    such\n   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer\n
    \  is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure\n   transport
    is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer\n   is HTTPS, and
    the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS\n   [RFC8446].\n   The Network
    Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]\n   provides the means to
    restrict access for particular NETCONF or\n   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured
    subset of all available NETCONF or\n   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.\n
    \  All data nodes defined in the YANG module that can be created,\n   modified,
    and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default) are\n   considered sensitive.
    \ Write operations (e.g., edit-config) applied\n   to these data nodes without
    proper protection can negatively affect\n   network operations.  An attacker who
    is able to access the B4/AFTR\n   can undertake various attacks, such as:\n   o
    \ Setting the value of 'aftr-ipv6-addr' on the B4 to point to an\n      illegitimate
    AFTR so that it can intercept all the traffic sent by\n      a B4.  Illegitimately
    intercepting users' traffic is an attack\n      with severe implications on privacy.\n
    \  o  Setting the MTU to a low value, which may increase the number of\n      fragments
    ('tunnel-mtu' for both B4 and AFTR).\n   o  Setting 'max-softwire-per-subscriber'
    to an arbitrary high value,\n      which will be exploited by a misbehaving user
    to grab more\n      resources (by mounting as many softwires as required to get
    more\n      external IP addresses/ports) or to perform a DoS on the AFTR by\n
    \     mounting a massive number of softwires.\n   o  Setting 'state-migrate' to
    'false' on the AFTR.  This action may\n      lead to a service degradation for
    the users.\n   o  Setting 'b4-address-change-limit' to an arbitrary low value
    can\n      ease DoS attacks based on frequent change of the B4 IPv6 address.\n
    \  o  Setting 'v6-v4-dscp-preservation' to 'false\" may lead to a service\n      degradation
    if some policies are applied on the network based on\n      the DSCP value.\n
    \  Additional security considerations are discussed in [RFC8512].\n   Security
    considerations related to DS-Lite are discussed in\n   [RFC6333].\n"
