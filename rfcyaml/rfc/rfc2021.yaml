- title: 1.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n   RFC 1902 [1] which\
    \ defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n   describing and naming objects for\
    \ the purpose of management.\n   RFC 1213, STD 17, [3] which defines MIB-II, the\
    \ core set of\n   managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.\n   RFC\
    \ 1905 [4] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for\n   network access to\
    \ managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the\
    \ purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  Within a given MIB module,\n   objects are defined using the SMI's\
    \ OBJECT-TYPE macro.  At a minimum,\n   each object has a name, a syntax, an access-level,\
    \ and an\n   implementation-status.\n   The name is an object identifier, an administratively\
    \ assigned name,\n   which specifies an object type.  The object type together\
    \ with an\n   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation\n\
    \   of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,\n  \
    \ termed the object descriptor, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax\
    \ of an object type defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that\
    \ object type.  The ASN.1 [6] language is used\n   for this purpose.  However,\
    \ RFC 1902 purposely restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These\
    \ restrictions are explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The access-level of\
    \ an object type defines whether it makes \"protocol\n   sense\" to read and/or\
    \ write the value of an instance of the object\n   type.  (This access-level is\
    \ independent of any administrative\n   authorization policy.)\n   The implementation-status\
    \ of an object type indicates whether the\n   object is mandatory, optional, obsolete,\
    \ or deprecated.\n"
- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON\
    \ MIB [RFC\n   1757] by providing a major feature upgrade, primarily by providing\n\
    \   RMON analysis up to the application layer.\n   Remote network monitoring devices,\
    \ often called monitors or probes,\n   are instruments that exist for the purpose\
    \ of managing a network.\n   Often these remote probes are stand-alone devices\
    \ and devote\n   significant internal resources for the sole purpose of managing\
    \ a\n   network.  An organization may employ many of these devices, one per\n\
    \   network segment, to manage its internet.  In addition, these devices\n   may\
    \ be used for a network management service provider to access a\n   client network,\
    \ often geographically remote.\n   The objects defined in this document are intended\
    \ as an interface\n   between an RMON agent and an RMON management application\
    \ and are not\n   intended for direct manipulation by humans.  While some users\
    \ may\n   tolerate the direct display of some of these objects, few will\n   tolerate\
    \ the complexity of manually manipulating objects to\n   accomplish row creation.\
    \  These functions should be handled by the\n   management application.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Remote Network Management Goals
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Remote Network Management Goals\n    o Offline Operation\n        There\
    \ are sometimes conditions when a management\n        station will not be in constant\
    \ contact with its\n        remote monitoring devices.  This is sometimes by\n\
    \        design in an attempt to lower communications costs\n        (especially\
    \ when communicating over a WAN or\n        dialup link), or by accident as network\
    \ failures\n        affect the communications between the management\n       \
    \ station and the probe.\n        For this reason, this MIB allows a probe to\
    \ be\n        configured to perform diagnostics and to collect\n        statistics\
    \ continuously, even when communication with\n        the management station may\
    \ not be possible or\n        efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify\n\
    \        the management station when an exceptional condition\n        occurs.\
    \  Thus, even in circumstances where\n        communication between management\
    \ station and probe is\n        not continuous, fault, performance, and configuration\n\
    \        information may be continuously accumulated and\n        communicated\
    \ to the management station conveniently\n        and efficiently.\n    o Proactive\
    \ Monitoring\n        Given the resources available on the monitor, it\n     \
    \   is potentially helpful for it continuously to run\n        diagnostics and\
    \ to log network performance.  The\n        monitor is always available at the\
    \ onset of any\n        failure.  It can notify the management station of the\n\
    \        failure and can store historical statistical\n        information about\
    \ the failure.  This historical\n        information can be played back by the\
    \ management\n        station in an attempt to perform further diagnosis\n   \
    \     into the cause of the problem.\n    o Problem Detection and Reporting\n\
    \        The monitor can be configured to recognize\n        conditions, most\
    \ notably error conditions, and\n        continuously to check for them.  When\
    \ one of these\n        conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and\n    \
    \    management stations may be notified in a number of\n        ways.\n    o\
    \ Value Added Data\n        Because a remote monitoring device represents a\n\
    \        network resource dedicated exclusively to network\n        management\
    \ functions, and because it is located\n        directly on the monitored portion\
    \ of the network, the\n        remote network monitoring device has the opportunity\n\
    \        to add significant value to the data it collects.\n        For instance,\
    \ by highlighting those hosts on the\n        network that generate the most traffic\
    \ or errors, the\n        probe can give the management station precisely the\n\
    \        information it needs to solve a class of problems.\n    o Multiple Managers\n\
    \        An organization may have multiple management stations\n        for different\
    \ units of the organization, for different\n        functions (e.g. engineering\
    \ and operations), and in an\n        attempt to provide disaster recovery.  Because\n\
    \        environments with multiple management stations are\n        common, the\
    \ remote network monitoring device has to\n        deal with more than own management\
    \ station,\n        potentially using its resources concurrently.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Structure of MIB
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Structure of MIB\n   The objects are arranged into the following groups:\n\
    \        - protocol directory\n        - protocol distribution\n        - address\
    \ mapping\n        - network layer host\n        - network layer matrix\n    \
    \    - application layer host\n        - application layer matrix\n        - user\
    \ history\n        - probe configuration\n   These groups are the basic units\
    \ of conformance.  If a remote\n   monitoring device implements a group, then\
    \ it must implement all\n   objects in that group.  For example, a managed agent\
    \ that implements\n   the network layer matrix group must implement the nlMatrixSDTable\
    \ and\n   the nlMatrixDSTable.\n   Implementations of this MIB must also implement\
    \ the system and\n   interfaces group of MIB-II [3].  MIB-II may also mandate\
    \ the\n   implementation of additional groups.\n   These groups are defined to\
    \ provide a means of assigning object\n   identifiers, and to provide a method\
    \ for managed agents to know which\n   objects they must implement.\n   This document\
    \ also contains enhancements to tables defined in the\n   RMON MIB [RFC 1757].\
    \  These enhancements include:\n    1) Adding the DroppedFrames and LastCreateTime\n\
    \       conventions to each table defined in the RMON MIB.\n    2) Augmenting\
    \ the RMON filter table with a mechanism\n       that allows filtering based on\
    \ an offset from the\n       beginning of a particular protocol, even if the\n\
    \       protocol headers are variable length.\n    3) Augmenting the RMON filter\
    \ and capture status bits\n       with additional bits for WAN media and generic\
    \ media.\n       These bits are defined here as:\n        Bit     Definition\n\
    \        6       For WAN media, this bit is set for packets\n                coming\
    \ from one direction and cleared for\n                packets coming from the\
    \ other direction.\n                It is an implementation specific matter\n\
    \                as to which bit is assigned to which\n                direction,\
    \ but it must be consistent for\n                all packets received by the agent,\
    \ and if\n                the agent knows which end of the link is\n         \
    \       \"local\" and which end is \"network\", the bit\n                should\
    \ be set for packets from the \"local\"\n                side and should be cleared\
    \ for packets from\n                the \"network\" side.\n        7       For\
    \ any media, this bit is set for any packet\n                with a physical layer\
    \ error. This bit may be\n                set in addition to other media-specific\
    \ bits\n                that denote the same condition.\n        8       For any\
    \ media, this bit is set for any packet\n                that is too short for\
    \ the media. This bit may\n                be set in addition to other media-specific\n\
    \                bits that denote the same condition.\n        9       For any\
    \ media, this bit is set for any packet\n                that is too long for\
    \ the media. This bit may\n                be set in addition to other media-specific\
    \ bits\n                that denote the same condition.\n   These enhancements\
    \ are implemented by RMON-2 probes that also\n   implement RMON and do not add\
    \ any requirements to probes that are\n   compliant to just RMON.\n"
- title: 3.  Control of Remote Network Monitoring Devices
  contents:
  - "3.  Control of Remote Network Monitoring Devices\n   Due to the complex nature\
    \ of the available functions in these\n   devices, the functions often need user\
    \ configuration.  In many cases,\n   the function requires parameters to be set\
    \ up for a data collection\n   operation.  The operation can proceed only after\
    \ these parameters are\n   fully set up.\n   Many functional groups in this MIB\
    \ have one or more tables in which\n   to set up control parameters, and one or\
    \ more data tables in which to\n   place the results of the operation.  The control\
    \ tables are typically\n   read/write in nature, while the data tables are typically\
    \ read/only.\n   Because the parameters in the control table often describe resulting\n\
    \   data in the data table, many of the parameters can be modified only\n   when\
    \ the control entry is not active.  Thus, the method for modifying\n   these parameters\
    \ is to de-activate the entry, perform the SNMP Set\n   operations to modify the\
    \ entry, and then re-activate the entry.\n   Deleting the control entry causes\
    \ the deletion of any associated data\n   entries, which also gives a convenient\
    \ method for reclaiming the\n   resources used by the associated data.\n   Some\
    \ objects in this MIB provide a mechanism to execute an action on\n   the remote\
    \ monitoring device.  These objects may execute an action as\n   a result of a\
    \ change in the state of the object.  For those objects\n   in this MIB, a request\
    \ to set an object to the same value as it\n   currently holds would thus cause\
    \ no action to occur.\n   To facilitate control by multiple managers, resources\
    \ have to be\n   shared among the managers.  These resources are typically the\
    \ memory\n   and computation resources that a function requires.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Resource Sharing Among Multiple Management Stations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Resource Sharing Among Multiple Management Stations\n   When multiple management\
    \ stations wish to use functions that compete\n   for a finite amount of resources\
    \ on a device, a method to facilitate\n   this sharing of resources is required.\
    \  Potential conflicts include:\n    o Two management stations wish to simultaneously\
    \ use\n      resources that together would exceed the capability of\n      the\
    \ device.\n    o A management station uses a significant amount of\n      resources\
    \ for a long period of time.\n    o A management station uses resources and then\
    \ crashes,\n      forgetting to free the resources so others may\n      use them.\n\
    \   The OwnerString mechanism is provided for each management station\n   initiated\
    \ function in this MIB to avoid these conflicts and to help\n   resolve them when\
    \ they occur.  Each function has a label identifying\n   the initiator (owner)\
    \ of the function.  This label is set by the\n   initiator to provide for the\
    \ following possibilities:\n    o A management station may recognize resources\
    \ it owns\n      and no longer needs.\n    o A network operator can find the management\
    \ station that\n      owns the resource and negotiate for it to be freed.\n  \
    \  o A network operator may decide to unilaterally free\n      resources another\
    \ network operator has reserved.\n    o Upon initialization, a management station\
    \ may recognize\n      resources it had reserved in the past.  With this\n   \
    \   information it may free the resources if it no longer\n      needs them.\n\
    \   Management stations and probes should support any format of the owner\n  \
    \ string dictated by the local policy of the organization.  It is\n   suggested\
    \ that this name contain one or more of the following: IP\n   address, management\
    \ station name, network manager's name, location,\n   or phone number.  This information\
    \ will help users to share the\n   resources more effectively.\n   There is often\
    \ default functionality that the device or the\n   administrator of the probe\
    \ (often the network administrator) wishes\n   to set up.  The resources associated\
    \ with this functionality are then\n   owned by the device itself or by the network\
    \ administrator, and are\n   intended to be long-lived.  In this case, the device\
    \ or the\n   administrator will set the relevant owner object to a string starting\n\
    \   with 'monitor'.  Indiscriminate modification of the monitor-owned\n   configuration\
    \ by network management stations is discouraged.  In\n   fact, a network management\
    \ station should only modify these objects\n   under the direction of the administrator\
    \ of the probe.\n   Resources on a probe are scarce and are typically allocated\
    \ when\n   control rows are created by an application.  Since many applications\n\
    \   may be using a probe simultaneously, indiscriminate allocation of\n   resources\
    \ to particular applications is very likely to cause resource\n   shortages in\
    \ the probe.\n   When a network management station wishes to utilize a function\
    \ in a\n   monitor, it is encouraged to first scan the control table of that\n\
    \   function to find an instance with similar parameters to share.  This\n   is\
    \ especially true for those instances owned by the monitor, which\n   can be assumed\
    \ to change infrequently.  If a management station\n   decides to share an instance\
    \ owned by another management station, it\n   should understand that the management\
    \ station that owns the instance\n   may indiscriminately modify or delete it.\n\
    \   It should be noted that a management application should have the most\n  \
    \ trust in a monitor-owned row because it should be changed very\n   infrequently.\
    \  A row owned by the management application is less\n   long-lived because a\
    \ network administrator is more likely to re-\n   assign resources from a row\
    \ that is in use by one user than from a\n   monitor-owned row that is potentially\
    \ in use by many users.  A row\n   owned by another application would be even\
    \ less long-lived because\n   the other application may delete or modify that\
    \ row completely at its\n   discretion.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Row Addition Among Multiple Management Stations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Row Addition Among Multiple Management Stations\n   The addition of new\
    \ rows is achieved using the RowStatus method\n   described in RFC 1903 [2]. \
    \ In this MIB, rows are often added to a\n   table in order to configure a function.\
    \  This configuration usually\n   involves parameters that control the operation\
    \ of the function.  The\n   agent must check these parameters to make sure they\
    \ are appropriate\n   given restrictions defined in this MIB as well as any implementation\n\
    \   specific restrictions such as lack of resources.  The agent\n   implementor\
    \ may be confused as to when to check these parameters and\n   when to signal\
    \ to the management station that the parameters are\n   invalid.  There are two\
    \ opportunities:\n    o When the management station sets each parameter object.\n\
    \    o When the management station sets the row status object\n      to active.\n\
    \   If the latter is chosen, it would be unclear to the management\n   station\
    \ which of the several parameters was invalid and caused the\n   badValue error\
    \ to be emitted.  Thus, wherever possible, the\n   implementor should choose the\
    \ former as it will provide more\n   information to the management station.\n\
    \   A problem can arise when multiple management stations attempt to set\n   configuration\
    \ information simultaneously using SNMP.  When this\n   involves the addition\
    \ of a new conceptual row in the same control\n   table, the managers may collide,\
    \ attempting to create the same entry.\n   To guard against these collisions,\
    \ each such control entry contains a\n   status object with special semantics\
    \ that help to arbitrate among the\n   managers.  If an attempt is made with the\
    \ row addition mechanism to\n   create such a status object and that object already\
    \ exists, an error\n   is returned.  When more than one manager simultaneously\
    \ attempts to\n   create the same conceptual row, only the first will succeed.\
    \  The\n   others will receive an error.\n   In the RMON MIB [RFC 1757], the EntryStatus\
    \ textual convention was\n   introduced to provide this mutual exclusion function.\
    \  Since then,\n   this function was added to the SNMP framework as the RowStatus\n\
    \   textual convention.  The RowStatus textual convention is used for the\n  \
    \ definition of all new tables.\n   When a manager wishes to create a new control\
    \ entry, it needs to\n   choose an index for that row.  It may choose this index\
    \ in a variety\n   of ways, hopefully minimizing the chances that the index is\
    \ in use by\n   another manager.  If the index is in use, the mechanism mentioned\n\
    \   previously will guard against collisions.  Examples of schemes to\n   choose\
    \ index values include random selection or scanning the control\n   table looking\
    \ for the first unused index.  Because index values may\n   be any valid value\
    \ in the range and they are chosen by the manager,\n   the agent must allow a\
    \ row to be created with any unused index value\n   if it has the resources to\
    \ create a new row.\n   Some tables in this MIB reference other tables within\
    \ this MIB.  When\n   creating or deleting entries in these tables, it is generally\n\
    \   allowable for dangling references to exist.  There is no defined\n   order\
    \ for creating or deleting entries in these tables.\n"
- title: 4.  Conventions

  - "4.  Conventions\n   The following conventions are used throughout the RMON MIB\
    \ and its\n   companion documents.\n   Good Packets\n   Good packets are error-free\

- title: 5.1.  Usage of the term Application Level
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Usage of the term Application Level\n   There are many cases in this MIB\
    \ where the term Application Level is\n   used to describe a class of protocols\
    \ or a capability.  This does not\n   typically mean a protocol that is an OSI\
    \ Layer 7 protocol.  Rather,\n   it is used to identify a class of protocols that\
    \ is not limited to\n   MAC-layer and network-layer protocols, but can also include\n\
    \   transport, session, presentation, and application-layer protocols.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Protocol Directory and Limited Extensibility
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Protocol Directory and Limited Extensibility\n   Every RMON 2 implementation\
    \ will have the capability to parse certain\n   types of packets and identify\
    \ their protocol type at multiple levels,\n   The protocol directory presents\
    \ an inventory of those protocol types\n   the probe is capable of monitoring,\
    \ and allows the addition,\n   deletion, and configuration of protocol types in\
    \ this list.\n   One concept deserves special attention: the \"limited extensibility\"\
    \n   of the protocol directory table.  The RMON 2 model is that protocols\n  \
    \ are detected by static software that has been written at\n   implementation\
    \ time.  Therefore, as a matter of configuration, an\n   implementation does not\
    \ have the ability to suddenly learn how to\n   parse new packet types.  However,\
    \ an implementation may be written\n   such that the software knows where the\
    \ demultiplexing field is for a\n   particular protocol, and can be written in\
    \ such a way that the\n   decoding of the next layer up is table-driven.  This\
    \ works when the\n   code has been written to accomodate it and can be extended\
    \ no more\n   than one level higher.  This extensibility is called \"limited\n\
    \   extensibility\" to highlight these limitations.  However, this can be\n  \
    \ a very useful tool.\n   For example, suppose that an implementation has C code\
    \ that\n   understands how to decode IP packets on any of several ethernet\n \
    \  encapsulations, and also knows how to interpret the IP protocol field\n   to\
    \ recognize UDP packets and how to decode the UDP port number\n   fields.  That\
    \ implementation may be table- driven so that among the\n   many different UDP\
    \ port numbers possible, it is configured to\n   recognize 161 as SNMP, port 53\
    \ as DNS, and port 69 as TFTP.  The\n   limited extensibility of the protocol\
    \ directory table would allow an\n   SNMP operation to create an entry that would\
    \ create an additional\n   table mapping for UDP that would recognize UDP port\
    \ 123 as NTP and\n   begin counting such packets.\n   This limited extensibility\
    \ is an option that an implementation can\n   choose to allow or disallow for\
    \ any protocol that has child\n   protocols.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Errors in packets
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Errors in packets\n   Packets with link-level errors are not counted anywhere\
    \ in this MIB\n   because most variables in this MIB requires the decoding of\
    \ the\n   contents of the packet, which is meaningless if there is a link-level\n\
    \   error.\n   Packets in which protocol errors are detected are counted for all\n\
    \   protocols below the layer in which the error was encountered.  The\n   implication\
    \ of this is that packets in which errors are detected at\n   the network-layer\
    \ are not counted anywhere in this MIB, while packets\n   with errors detected\
    \ at the transport layer may have network-layer\n   statistics counted.\n"

    \ or not this protocol directory entry can be extended\n         by the user by\
    \ creating protocol directory entries which are\n         children of this protocol.\n\
    \         An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is\n    \
    \     `ip.udp'.  The probe may automatically populate some children\n        \
    \ of this node such as `ip.udp.snmp' and `ip.udp.dns'.\n         A probe administrator\
    \ or user may also populate additional\n         children via remote SNMP requests\
    \ that create entries in this\n         table.  When a child node is added for\
    \ a protocol for which the\n         probe has no built in support, extending\
    \ a parent node (for\n         which the probe does have built in support),\n\
    \         that child node is not extendible.  This is termed `limited\n      \
    \   extensibility'.\n         When a child node is added through this extensibility\n\
    \         mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and\n         protocolDirType\
    \ shall be assigned by the agent.\n         The other objects in the entry will\
    \ be assigned by the\n         manager who is creating the new entry.\n      \
    \   This object also describes whether or not this agent can\n         recognize\
    \ addresses for this protocol, should it be a network\n         level protocol.\
    \  That is, while a probe may be able to\n         recognize packets of a particular\
    \ network layer protocol and\n         count them, it takes additional logic to\
    \ be able to recognize\n         the addresses in this protocol and to populate\
    \ network layer\n         or application layer tables with the addresses in this\n\
    \         protocol.  If this bit is set, the agent will recognize\n         network\
    \ layer addresses for this protoocl and populate the\n         network and application\
    \ layer host and matrix tables with\n         these protocols.\n         Note\
    \ that when an entry is created, the agent will supply\n         values for the\
    \ bits that match the capabilities of the agent\n         with respect to this\
    \ protocol.  Note that since row creations\n         usually exercise the limited\
    \ extensibility feature, these\n         bits will usually be set to zero.\"\n\

  - "ControlString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION\n    STATUS current\n    DESCRIPTION\n \
    \       \"This data type is used to communicate with a modem or a\n        serial\
    \ data switch.  A ControlString contains embedded\n        commands to control\
    \ how the device will interact with the\n        remote device through the serial\
    \ interface.  Commands are\n        represented as two character sequences beginning\
    \ with\n        the `^' character.\n        The following commands are recognized\
    \ by the device (note\n        that command characters are case sensitive):\n\
    \           ^s  Send string that follows which is terminated by the\n        \
    \       next command or the end of string.\n           ^c  Delay for the number\
    \ of seconds that follows.  Toss\n               out any data received rather\
    \ than storing it in a\n               buffer for parsing.\n           ^t  Set\
    \ timeout to the value represented by the decimal\n               digits that\
    \ follow.  The default timeout is 20\n               seconds. Note that this timeout\
    \ may be overridden\n               by a smaller serialTimeout configured for\
    \ the\n               associated serial interface (see serialConfigTable).\n \
    \          ^w  Wait for the reply string that follows which is\n             \
    \  terminated by the next command or the end of string.\n               Partial\
    \ and case insensitive matching is applied, ie.\n               if the reply string\
    \ (any case combination) is found\n               anywhere in the received string,\
    \ then the a match is\n               found.  If the current timeout elapses without\
    \ a match,\n               then the remaining control string is ignored.\n   \
    \        ^!  The ^ character.\n           ^d  Delay the number of seconds specified\
    \ by the decimal\n               digits that follow.\n           ^b  Send break\
    \ for the number of milliseconds specified by\n               the decimal digits\
    \ that follow.  If no digits follow,\n               break will be enforced for\
    \ 250 milliseconds by default.\n        The following ASCII control characters\
    \ may be inserted into\n        the `^s' send string or the `^w' reply string:\n\
    \           ^@    0x00\n           ^A    0x01\n            ..\n           ^M \
    \   0x0D\n            ..\n           ^Z    0x1A\n           ^[    0x1B\n     \
    \      ^    0x1C\n           ^]    0x1D\n           ^^    0x1E\n           ^_\
    \    0x1F\n        Binary data may also be inserted into the data stream.  The\n\
    \        control sequence for each byte of binary data is ^0x##, where\n     \
    \   ## is the hexadecimal representation of the data byte.  Two\n        ASCII\
    \ characters (0-9, a-f, A-F) must follow the `^0x'\n        control prefix.  For\
    \ example, `^0x0D^0x0A' is interpreted as a\n        carriage return followed\
    \ by a line feed.\"\n    SYNTAX DisplayString\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   In order to implement this MIB, a probe must\
    \ capture all packets on\n   the locally-attached network, including packets between\
    \ third\n   parties.  These packets are analyzed to collect network addresses,\n\
    \   protocol usage information, and conversation statistics. Data of this\n  \
    \ nature may be considered sensitive in some environments. In such\n   environments\
    \ the administrator may wish to restrict SNMP access to\n   the probe.\n   A probe\
    \ implementing this MIB is likely to also implement RMON\n   [RFC1757], which\
    \ includes functions for returning the contents of\n   captured packets, potentially\
    \ including sensitive user data or\n   passwords. It is recommended that SNMP\
    \ access to these functions be\n   restricted.\n"

  - "8.  Appendix - TimeFilter Implementation Notes\n   1) Theory of Operation\n \
    \  The TimeFilter mechanism allows an NMS to reduce the number of SNMP\n   transactions\
    \ required for a 'table-update' operation.  Polling of\n   tables that incorporate\
    \ a 'TimeFilter' INDEX can be reduced to a\n   theoretical minimum (if used correctly).\
    \ It can be easily implemented\n   by an agent in a way independent of the number\
    \ of NMS applications\n   using the same time-filtered table.\n   Although the\
    \ name 'TimeFilter' may imply that a history of change\n   events is maintained\
    \ by the agent, this is not the case.  A time-\n   filtered-value represents the\
    \ current value of the object instance,\n   not the 'saved' value at the time\
    \ indicated by the TimeFilter INDEX\n   value. Note that TimeFilter objects only\
    \ appear in INDEX clauses\n   (always not-accessible), so their value is never\
    \ retrieved. By\n   design, the actual value of a TimeFilter instance is not in\
    \ itself\n   meaningful (it's not a 'last-change-timestamp').\n   The TimeFilter\
    \ is a boolean filtering function applied in internal\n   Get* PDU processing.\
    \ If the 'last-change-time' of the specified\n   instance is less than the particular\
    \ TimeFilter INDEX value, then the\n   instance is considered 'not-present' (skipped\
    \ for GetNext and GetBulk\n   PDUs; 'noSuchInstance' or returned to the requester.\n"
- title: 1.1) Agent Implementation of a Time-Filtered Table
  contents:
  - "1.1) Agent Implementation of a Time-Filtered Table\n   In implementation, the\
    \ time-filtered rows (one for each tick of\n   sysUpTime) are only conceptual.\
    \ The agent simply filters a real table\n   based on:\n       * the current value\
    \ of sysUpTime\n       * the TimeFilter value passed in the varbind\n       *\
    \ the last-update timestamp of each requested counter\n         (agent implementation\
    \ requirement)\n   For example, to implement a time-filtered counter, an agent\
    \ maintains\n   a timestamp in a 32-bit storage location, initialized to zero.\
    \ This\n   is in addition to whatever instrumentation is needed for the counter.\n\
    \   Each time the counter is updated, the current value of sysUpTime is\n   recorded\
    \ in the associated timestamp. If this is not possible or\n   practical, then\
    \ a background polling process must 'refresh' the\n   timestamp by sampling counter\
    \ values and comparing them to recorded\n   samples. The timestamp update must\
    \ occur within 5 seconds of the\n   actual change event.\n   When an agent receives\
    \ a Get, GetNext, or GetBulk PDU requesting a\n   time-filtered instance, the\
    \ following agent has determined that the\n   instance is within the MIB view\
    \ indicated by the community string in\n   the PDU.\n       /* return TRUE if\
    \ the object is present */\n       boolean time_filter_test (\n           TimeFilter\
    \  last_modified_timestamp,\n           TimeFilter  index_value_in_pdu )\n   \
    \    {\n           if (last_modified_timestamp < index_value_in_pdu)\n       \
    \     return FALSE;\n           else\n               return TRUE;\n       }\n\
    \   The agent applies this function regardless of the lastActivationTime\n   of\
    \ the conceptual row in question. In other words, counter\n   discontinuities\
    \ are ignored (i.e.  conceptual row deleted and then\n   re-created later). An\
    \ agent should consider a object instance\n   'changed' when it is created (either\
    \ at restart time for scalars and\n   static objects, or row-creation-time for\
    \ dynamic tables).\n   Note that using a timeFilter INDEX value of zero removes\
    \ the\n   filtering functionality, as the instance will always be\n"

  - "1.2) NMS Implementation of a Time-Filtered Table\n   The particular TimeFilter\
    \ INDEX values used by an NMS reflect the\n   polling interval of the NMS, relative\
    \ to the particular agent's\n   notion of sysUpTime.\n   An NMS needs to maintain\
    \ one timestamp variable per agent\n   (initialized to zero) for an arbitrary\
    \ group of time-filtered MIB\n   objects that are gathered together in the same\
    \ PDU.  Each time the\n   Get* PDU is sent, a request for sysUpTime is included.\
    \ The retrieved\n   sysUpTime value is used as the timeFilter value in the next\
    \ polling\n   cycle. If a polling sweep of a time-filtered group of objects\n\
    \   requires more than one SNMP transaction, then the sysUpTime value\n   retrieved\
    \ in the first GetResponse PDU of the polling sweep is saved\n   as the next timeFilter\
    \ value.\n   The actual last-update time of a given object is not indicated in\
    \ the\n   returned GetResponse instance identifier, but rather the timeFilter\n\
    \   value passed in the Get*Request PDU is returned.\n   A \"time-filtered get-next/bulk-sweep\"\
    , done once per polling\n   cycle, is a series of GetNext or GetBulk transactions,\
    \ and is\n   over when one of the following events occurs:\n     1) the TimeFilter\
    \ index value returned in the GetResponse is\n        different than the TimeFilter\
    \ index value passed in the\n        GetNext or GetBulk request. Counter values\
    \ will still be\n        returned beyond this point (until the last-change-time\
    \ is\n        reached), but most likely the same values will be\n   returned.\n\
    \     2) the return PDU includes instances lexigraphically greater\n        than\
    \ the objects expected (i.e. same GetNext semantics as\n        if the TimeFilter\
    \ wasn't there)\n     3) a noSuchName or other exception/error is returned.\n\
    \   Note that the use of a time-filtered table in combination with a\n   GetRequest\
    \ PDU neutralizes any optimization that otherwise might be\n   achieved with the\
    \ TimeFilter, because no PDU transactions are saved.\n   Either the current time-filtered\
    \ object-value is returned, or a\n   'noSuchInstance' exception (SNMPv1c) or 'noSuchName'\
    \ error (SNMPv1)\n   is returned.\n   If GetBulk PDUs are used, then the value\
