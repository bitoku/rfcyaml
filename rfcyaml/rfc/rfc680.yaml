    \    Theodore H. Myer\n                          D. Austin Henderson\n       \
    \                        BBN-TENEX\n   This document defines a number of message\
    \ fields beyond those\n   discussed in RFC 561.  The overall message format is\
    \ compatible with\n   RFC 561; it makes extensive use of the miscellaneous fileds\
    \ defined\n   within RFC 561.  The purpose of this document is to establish ARPANET\n\
    \   standards with regard to the syntax and semantics for these\n   additional\
    \ fields.  It is fully expected that all fields discussed\n   herein will not\
    \ be automatically processed by all Message Servers;\n   however, the standard\
    \ is necessary so that sites which wish to make\n   use of these fields have a\
    \ standard to work with.\n   This document attempts to tread the narrow line between\
    \ features for\n   human processing and features for machine processing.  The\
    \ general\n   feeling is that the fields listed are useful to people even if\n\
    \   automatic processing is not supplied.  In most cases, machine-\n   readable\
    \ notations have been enclosed in angle brackets (<>) to allow\n   easy non-ambiguous\
    \ ways for automatic processes to know whether and\n   where to look in any field.\
    \  The entire specifications has been made\n   excessively general to allow for\
    \ experimentation. Future documents\n   based on experience will try to be more\
    \ specific.  This is simply the\n   next step following <RFC 561>.\n   This document\
    \ is contained in two sections.  Section I contains the\n   relevant parts of\
    \ RFC 561 which define the basic message syntax.\n   Section II lists the new\
    \ (and existing) header fields together with\n   their proposed uses.\n"

    \  is insignificant.  Although 'FROM', for example, appears in\n      upper-case\
    \ in the formal syntax above, in the header of an actual\n      message it may\
    \ appear as 'FROM', 'from', or 'From', etc.\n      (2) No attempt has been made\
    \ to legislate the format of <user>\n      except to exclude spaces from it.\n\
    \      (3) The time has no internal punctuation.\n"

- title: A. ORIGINATOR SPECIFICATION FIELDS
  contents:
  - "A. ORIGINATOR SPECIFICATION FIELDS\n   FROM\n   This field contains the identity\
    \ of the person who wished this\n   message to be sent.  This is expected to be\
    \ the originator field\n   which is specified by the user in the case that the\
    \ message is being\n   entered by one person for another.  The message-creation\
    \ process\n   should default this field to be the user entering the message. [The\n\
    \   usage for FROM and SENDER differs from that of RFC 561.]\n   SENDER\n   This\
    \ field contains the identity of the person who sends the message.\n   This field\
    \ is expected to be set by the message-creation process\n   automatically.  It\
    \ is possible that some sites will not include this\n   field in external communications.\n\
    \   AUTHENTICATION\n   This field contains a description of which originator fields\
    \ have\n   been authenticated, and by which operating systems.  This field\n \
    \  should be created by message transmission and/or reception processes\n   (FTP/Operating\
    \ System level).\n   It is expected that current system will be able to authenticate\
    \ only\n   the SENDER field; however, later systems might have mechanisms to\n\
    \   verify that the FROM actually authorized the SENDER to act on his/her\n  \
    \ behalf.  It is expected that, when the FROM is authenticated, the\n   SENDER\
    \ will no longer be necessary for external distribution.\n"
- title: B. REFERENCE SPECIFICATION FIELDS
  contents:
  - "B. REFERENCE SPECIFICATION FIELDS\n   MESSAGE-ID\n   This field contains a unique\
    \ identifier to refer to this message.\n   The format for a message identifier\
    \ is:\n   [Net Address]Text String CRLF\n   Examples:\n              [ISIB]7-DEC-74.14:23:45\n\
    \              [ARC]QLOURNAL 39274a3\n   The uniqueness of the message identifier\
    \ is guaranteed by each net-\n   address message processor making the text which\
    \ follows unique for\n   that net-address.  This, specifically says net-address\
    \ and not site\n   name.  This would allow BBN (for instance) to allocate unique\n\
    \   identifiers over all four machines, which may be addressed as BBN\n   within\
    \ the message system, thus producing a more integrated service\n   for their users.\n\
    \   The text following the net-address is not defined here, as the\n   problems\
    \ associated with this specification are too great at this\n   time.  However,\
    \ the net-address should allow automatic processes to\n   determine if they can\
    \ deal intelligently with the following text.\n   Several types of automatic processing\
    \ by the local message reader are\n   thus possible:  1) if the site uses a filing\
    \ mechanism known to the\n   reader, the reader can retrieve the message 2) if\
    \ the site supports\n   remote message access (protocol not currently defined),\
    \ the message\n   id can be passed to the remote site and the message has been\
    \ filed in\n   the Datacomputer (using the entire message id [including net-address]\n\
    \   as the handle), the reader can retrieve it from the Datacomputer.\n   IN-REPLY-TO\n\
    \   The contents of this field identify previous correspondence which\n   this\
    \ message answers.  If message identifiers are used in this field,\n   they should\
    \ be enclosed in angle brackets (<>).\n   REFERENCES\n   The contents of this\
    \ field identify other correspondence which this\n   message references.  If message\
    \ identifiers are used, they should be\n   enclosed in angle brackets (<>).\n\
    \   KEYWORDS\n   This field contains keywords or phrases from the message, separated\n\
    \   by commas.\n"
- title: C. RECEIVER SPECIFICATION FIELDS
  contents:
  - "C. RECEIVER SPECIFICATION FIELDS\n   TO\n   This field contains the identity\
    \ of the primary receivers of the\n   message.\n   CC\n   This field contains\
    \ the identity of the secondary receivers of the\n   message.\n   BCC\n   This\
    \ field contains the identity of the tertiary receivers of the\n   message.  This\
    \ field should not be made available to the primary and\n   secondary receivers,\

- title: D. MESSAGE-TYPE SPECIFICATION FIELDS
