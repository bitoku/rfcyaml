  - "\t                   Internet Name Domains\n1.  Introduction\n     In the long\
    \ run, it will not be practicable for every internet\nhost to include all internet\
    \ hosts in its name-address tables.  Even\nnow, with over four hundred names and\
    \ nicknames in the combined\nARPANET-DCNET tables, this has become awkward.  Some\
    \ sort of\nhierarchical name-space partitioning can easily be devised to deal\n\
    with this problem; however, it has been wickedly difficult to find one\ncompatible\
    \ with the known mail systems throughout the community.  The\none proposed here\
    \ is the product of several discussions and meetings\nand is believed both compatible\
    \ with existing systems and extensible\nfor future systems involving thousands\
    \ of hosts.\n2.  General Topology\n     We first observe that every internet host\
    \ is uniquely identified\nby one or more 32-bit internet addresses and that the\
    \ entire system is\nfully connected.  For the moment, the issue of protocol compatibility\n\
    will be ignored, so that all hosts can be assumed MTP-competent.  We\nnext impose\
    \ a topological covering on the space of all internet\naddresses with a set of\
    \ so-called name domains.  In the natural model,\nname domains would correspond\
    \ to institutions such as ARPA, UCL and\nCOMSAT, and would not be necessarily\
    \ disjoint or complete.  While in\nprinciple name domains could be hierarchically\
    \ structured, we will\nassume in the following only a single-level structure.\n\
    \     Every name domain is associated with one or more internet\nprocesses called\
    \ mail forwarders and the name of that domain is the\nname for any of these processes.\
    \  Each forwarder process for a\nparticular domain is expected to maintain duplicate\
    \ name-address\ntables containing the names of all hosts in its domain and, in\n\
    addition, the name of at least one forwarder process for every other\ndomain.\
    \  Forwarder processes may be replicated in the interests of\nrobustness; however,\
    \ the resulting complexities in addressing and\nrouting will not be discussed\
    \ further here.  A particular internet\nhost may support a number of forwarder\
    \ processes and their collective\nnames represent nicknames for that host, in\
    \ addition to any other\nnames that host may have.  In the following an internet\
    \ host\nsupporting one or more forwarder proceses will be called simply a\nforwarder.\n\
    domain together with additional hosts as convenient.  A host may\nbelong to several\
    \ domains, but it is not necessary that all hosts in\nany domain, be included\
    \ in its tables.  Following current practice,\nseveral nicknames may be associated\
    \ with the principal name of a host\nin any domain and these names need not be\
    \ unique relative to any other\ndomain.  Furthermore, hosts can be multi-homed,\
    \ that is, respond to\nmore than one address.  For the purpose of mail forwarding\
    \ and\ndelivery, we will assume that any of these addresses can be used\nwithout\
    \ prejudice.  The use of multi-homing to facilitate source\nrouting is a topic\
    \ for future study.\n3.  Naming Conventions\n     In its most general form, a\
    \ standard internet mailbox name has\nthe syntax\n                  <user>.<host>@<domain>\
    \ ,\nwhere <user> is the name of a user known at the host <host> in the\nname\
    \ domain <domain>.  This syntax is intended to suggest a\nthree-level hierarchically\
    \ structured name (reading from the right)\nwhich is unique throughout the internet\
    \ system.  However, hosts within\na single domain may agree to adopt another structure,\
    \ as long as it\ndoes not conflict with the above syntax and as long as the forwarders\n\
    for that domain are prepared to make the requisite transformations.\nFor instance,\
    \ let the name of a domain including DCNET be COMSAT and\nthe name of one of its\
    \ hosts be COMSAT-DLM with Mills a user known to\nthat host.  From within the\
    \ COMSAT domain the name Mills@COMSAT-DLM\nuniquely identifies that mailbox as\
    \ could, for example, the name\nMills.COMSAT-DLM@COMSAT from anywhere in the internet\
    \ system.\nHowever, Mills@COMSAT-DLM is not necessarily meaningful anywhere\n\
    outside the COMSAT domain (but it could be).\n     A typical set of name domains\
    \ covering the current internet\nsystem might include ARPA (ARPANET), COMSAT (DCNET),\
    \ DCA (EDNET,\nWBNET), UCL (UCLNET, RSRENET, SRCNET), MIT (CHAOSNET), INTELPOST\n\
    (INTELPOSTNET) and the various public data networks.  The ARPA\nforwarder would\
    \ use a name-address table constructed from the latest\nversion of the HOSTS.TXT\
    \ table in the NIC data base.  The other\nforwarders would construct their own,\
    \ but be expected to deposit a\ncopy in the NIC data base.\n4.  Mail Transport\
    \ Principles\n     In the interests of economy and simplicity, it is expected\
    \ that\nhost and without intermediate relay.  A technique of caching will\nprobably\
    \ be necessary for many hosts in order to reduce the traffic\nwith forwarders\
    \ merely to learn the internet address associated with a\ncorrespondent host.\
    \  This naturally encourages naming strategies\ndesigned to minimize duplicate\
    \ names in the various domains; however,\nsuch duplicates are not forbidden.\n\
    \     There are several reasons why some messages will have to be\nstaged at an\
    \ intermediate relay, among them the following:\n1.  It may not be possible or\
    \ convenient for the  originator\n    and recipient hosts to be up on the internet\
    \ system at\n    the same time for the duration of the transfer.\n2.  The originator\
    \  host  may  not  have  the  resources  to\n    perform all name-address translations\
    \ required.\n3.  A direct-connection path may  not  be  feasible  due  to\n  \
    \  regulatory economic or security constraints.\n4.  The originator and recipient\
    \ hosts may not recognize the\n    same lower-level transport protocol (e.g. \
    \ TCP and NCP).\n     A mail relay is an internet process equipped to store an\
    \ MTP\nmessage for subsequent transmission.  A mail forwarder is a mail\nrelay,\
    \ but not all relays are forwarders, since they might not include\nthe full name-address\
    \ capability required of forwarders.  In addition,\nrelays may not be competent\
    \ in all domains.  For instance, a MTP/TCP\nrelay may not understand NCP.  In\
    \ other words, the forwarders must be\nfully connected, but the relays may not.\n\
    \     The particular sequence of relays traversed by a message is\ndetermined\
    \ by the sender by means of the source route specification in\nthe MRCP command.\
    \  There are several implications to this:\n1.  Advisory messages returned to\
    \ the originator by a relay\n    or recipient host are expected to traverse the\
    \ route in\n    reverse order.\n2.  Relay host names follow the same  naming \
    \ convention  as\n    all  host  names relative to their domain.  Since it may\n\
    \    not be possible (see below) to use internet addresses to\n    dis-ambiguate\
    \ the domain, the complete standard internet\n    name .<host>@<domain> is required\
    \ everywhere.\n    would  use  the  rules  outlined in the next section for\n\
    \    routing.  This may result in additional relay hops.\n5.  Forwarder Operations\n\
    \     This section describes a likely scenario involving hosts, relays\nand forwarders\
    \ and typical internet routes.  When a forwarder receives\na message for <user>.<host>@<domain>,\
    \ it transforms <host> if\nnecessary and forwards the message to its address found\
    \ in the\nname-address table for <domain>.  Note that a single host can be a\n\
    forwarder for several independent domains in this model and that these\ndomains\
    \ can intersect.  Thus, the names Mills@USC-ISIE,\nMills.USC-ISIE@ARPA and Mills.USC-ISIE@COMSAT\
    \ can all refer to the\nsame mailbox and the names USC-ISIE, ARPA and COMSAT can,\
    \ conceivably,\nall be known in the same domain.  Such use would be permissable\
    \ only\nin case the name USC-ISIE did not conflict with other names in this\n\
    domain.\n     In order for this scheme to work efficiently, it is desireable\n\
    that messages transiting forwarders always contain standard internet\nmailbox\
    \ names.  When this is not feasible, as in the current ARPANET\nmail system, the\
    \ forwarder must be able to determine which domain the\nmessage came from and\
    \ edit the names accordingly.  This would be\nnecessary in order to compose a\
    \ reply to the message in any case.\n     In the RFC-780 model a message arriving\
    \ at a forwarder is\nprocessed by the MTP server there.  The server extracts the\
    \ first\nentry in the recipient-route field of an MRCP command.  There are two\n\
    cases, depending on whether this entry specifies a domain name or a\nhost name.\
    \  If a domain name, as determined by a search of a universal\ntable, it refers\
    \ to one of the domains the server represents.  If not,\nit must a name or nickname\
    \ of the server's host relative to ooe of the\ndomains to which the sender belongs.\
    \  This allows a distinction to be\nmade between the domains COMSAT and INTELPOST\
    \ on one hand and the\nCOMSAT host COMSAT-PLA on the other, all of which might\
    \ be represented\nby the same internet address, and implies that domain names\
    \ must be\nunique in all domains.\n     The server next extracts the second entry\
    \ in the recipient-route\nfield of the MRCP command and resolves its address relative\
    \ to the\ndomain established by the first entry.  If the second entry specifies\n\
    an explicit domain, then that overrides the first entry.  If not and\nthe first\
    \ entry specifies a domain, then that domain is effective.\nMRCP to:<@COMSAT,Mills@HOST>\
    \ and \nMRCP to:<@INTELPOST,Mills@HOST> ,\nwhere Mills.HOST@COMSAT and Mills.HOST@INTELPOST\
    \ are distinct\nmailboxes on different hosts.  A receiving host supporting forwarders\n\
    for both COMSAT and INTELPOST can then preserve this distinction and\nforward\
    \ correctly using the above rules.\n     Now let the forwarder host have the name\
    \ FORWARDER in both the\nCOMSAT and INTELPOST domains and consider its options\
    \ when receiving\nthe command\nMRCP to:<@FORWARDER,Mills@HOST> .\nThe forwarder\
    \ is being asked simply to relay within the domain of the\nsender; however, it\
    \ belongs to more than one domain! The obvious way\nto resolve this issue would\
    \ be to forbid the use of implicit domains,\nas represented by Mills@HOST, and\
    \ require the full internet mailbox\nnames Mills.HOST@COMSAT or Mills.HOST@INTELPOST.\
    \  It is also possible\nto dis-ambiguate the domain by inspecting the first entry\
    \ of the\nsender-route field of the MAIL command (see below).\n6.  Source and\
    \ Return Routing\n     In the RFC-780 model, routes can be specified in the\n\
    recipient-route field of the MRCP command and in the sender-route\nfield of the\
    \ MAIL command.  In point of fact, neither the\nrecipient-route or sender-route\
    \ is necessary if the originator\nspecifies standard internet mailbox names. \
    \ So long as the routes,\nwhen used, consist only of domain names, there is no\
    \ conflict with the\ncurrent RFC-780 specification.  If for some reason forwarding\
    \ must be\ndone via other hosts, then the use of a complete and unambigous syntax\n\
    like .<host>@<domain> is required in order to avoid problems like that\ndescribed\
    \ above.\n     The present RFC-780 specification requires the receiver to\nconstruct\
    \ a name for the sender and insert this at the beginning of\nthe sender-route.\
    \  Presumably, the only information it has to\nconstruct this name is the internet\
    \ address of the sender.  Consider\nthe case, as in the example above, where multiple\
    \ domains are\nsupported by a single server on a particular host.  If hosts receiving\n\
    a message relayed via that server were to map its address into a name,\nthere\
    \ would be no way to determine which domain was intended.  We\nconclude that the\
    \ sending host must update the sender-route as well as\n7.  Editing the RFC-733\
    \ Header\n     Every effort should be made to avoid editing the RFC-733 header,\n\
    since this is an invasive procedure requiring extensive analysis.  It\nis expected\
    \ that newly developed mail systems will be aware of the\nstandard internet mailbox\
    \ syntax and ensure its use everywhere in the\nRFC-733 and RFC-780 fields.  On\
    \ the occasions where this is not\npossible, such as in many current ARPANET hosts,\
    \ the necessary editing\nshould be performed upon first entry to the internet\
    \ mail system from\nthe local mail system.  This avoids the problems mentioned\
    \ above and\nsimplifies reply functions.\n     In the case of ARPANET hosts, the\
    \ editing operations assume that\nall names in the form <anything>@<domain>, where\
    \ <domain> is the name\nof a domain, are unchanged.  Names in the form <anything>@<host>,\n\
    where <host> is the name of a host in the ARPA domain, are transformed\nto the\
    \ form <anything>.<host>@ARPA.  Anything else is an error.\nBefore handing off\
    \ to an ARPANET NCP mailer, an ARPA MTP forwarder\nmight optionally transform\
    \ <anything>.<host>@ARPA to <anything>@<host>\nin order to reduce the forwarder\
    \ traffic when local mail systems are\navailable.  Similar situations might exist\
    \ elsewhere.\n8.  Concluding Remarks\n"
