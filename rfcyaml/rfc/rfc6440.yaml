  - "Abstract\n   In order to derive a Domain-Specific Root Key (DSRK) from the\n
    \  Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) generated as a side effect of an\n   Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP) method, the EAP peer must\n   discover the name
    of the domain to which it is attached.\n   This document specifies a Dynamic Host
    Configuration Protocol\n   Version 6 (DHCPv6) option designed to allow a DHCPv6
    server to inform\n   clients using the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) EAP
    method of\n   the name of the local domain for ERP.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) [RFC5296] is designed
    to\n   allow faster re-authentication of a mobile device that was previously\n
    \  authenticated by means of the Extensible Authentication Protocol\n   [RFC3748].
    \ Given that the local root key (e.g., a DSRK, as described\n   in RFC 5295 [RFC5295])
    is generated using the local domain name\n   (LDN), LDN discovery is an important
    part of re-authentication.  As\n   described in RFC 5296 [RFC5296], the LDN to
    be used in ERP can be\n   learned by the mobile device through the ERP exchange
    or via a lower-\n   layer mechanism.  However, no lower-layer mechanisms for LDN\n
    \  discovery have yet been defined.\n   This document specifies an extension to
    DHCPv6 for LDN to be used\n   in ERP.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Client Behavior\n   If a DHCPv6 client doesn't know the ERP LDN and requires
    the DHCPv6\n   server to provide the DHCPv6 ERP LDN option, it MUST include an\n
    \  Option Request option requesting the DHCPv6 ERP Local Domain Name\n   option,
    as described in Section 22.7 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315].\n   When the DHCPv6 client
    receives an ERP Local Domain Name option with\n   the ERP LDN present in it, it
    MUST verify that the option length is\n   no more than 256 octets (the maximum
    length of a single fully\n   qualified domain name (FQDN) allowed by the DNS),
    and that the local\n   domain name is a properly encoded single FQDN, as specified
    in\n   Section 8 of RFC 3315 (\"Representation and Use of Domain Names\")\n   [RFC3315].\n"
  title: 4.  Client Behavior
- contents:
  - "5.  Relay Agent Behavior\n   If a DHCPv6 relay agent has pre-existing knowledge
    of the ERP local\n   domain name for a client (for example, from a previous AAA
    exchange),\n   it SHOULD include it in an instance of the DHCPv6 ERP Local Domain\n
    \  Name option and forward to the DHCPv6 server as a suboption of the\n   Relay-Supplied
    Options option [RFC6422].\n"
  title: 5.  Relay Agent Behavior
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The communication between the DHCPv6 client and
    the DHCPv6 server for\n   the exchange of local domain name information is security
    sensitive\n   and requires server authentication and integrity protection.  DHCPv6\n
    \  security as described in [RFC3315] can be used for this purpose.\n"
