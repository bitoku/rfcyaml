Abstract This document presents an application of the BGP community attribute [2] in simplifying the implementation and configuration of routing policies in the multi provider Internet.
It shows how the community based configuration can be used to replace the AS based customization of the BGP "LOCAL PREF" attribute, a common method used today.
Not only does the technique presented simplifies configuration and management at the provider level, it also represents a paradigm shift in that it gives the potential for the customer to control its own routing policy with respect to its service provider, as well as providing the ability for policy configuration to be done at a prefix based granularity rather than the more common AS based granularity.
In the multi provider Internet, it is common for a service subscriber (i.e., customer) to have more than one service provider, or to have arrangements for redundant connectivity to the global connected Internet.
As discussed in [3], routing strategies in these cases usually require coordination between the service subscriber and its providers, which typically leads to customization of router configurations (e.g., BGP "LOCAL PREF") not only by the subscriber, but also by its providers.
Due to the large number of customers a provider serves, customization of router configurations at the provider level may present management and scalability problems.
This document presents an application of the BGP community attribute in simplifying the implementation of routing strategies in the multi provider Internet.
More specifically, the technique presented uses a community based, rather than the common AS based, configuration of the BGP "LOCAL PREF".
It essentially removes the need for customized configuration of the BGP "LOCAL PREF" attribute at the provider level while maintaining the same level of routing functionality and flexibility.
It also represents a paradigm shift in that it gives the potential for the customer to control its own routing policy with respect to its service provider, as well as providing the ability for policy configuration to be done at a prefix based granularity rather than the more common AS based granularity in use today.
AS based Configuration and its Drawbacks
As discussed in [3], in today's multi provider Internet, customized configuration of the BGP "LOCAL PREF" attribute is often required to implement common routing strategies such as load sharing or backup.
There are two main reasons: Lack of available implementations and deployment of routing software that supports the "Destination Preference Attribute" (DPA) as specified in [4].
DPA allows one to specify a globally transitive preference so that return traffic favors certain path.
As discussed in [3], the attribute will be very useful in influencing route selection for routes with identical "LOCAL PREF" and equal AS path length.
In the multi provider Internet, it is common for a provider to assign higher BGP "LOCAL PREF" values for routes from its customers than from other service providers.
This practice provides some degree of protection for its customer routes, and it facilitates implementation of certain routing strategies.
It, however, also complicates other routing implementations such as backup arrangement, thus, requiring customized "LOCAL PREF" configuration.
Figure 1 shows a typical case of a backup arrangement in the multi  provider Internet.
In Figure 1, AS1 and AS2 are both providers, and AS3 and AS4 are customers of AS1 and AS2, respectively.
AS3 has entered a bilateral agreement with AS4 to provide backup to each other.
That is, AS3 would use its direct link to AS4 to reach only AS4 in the normal circumstance, and for transit in the case of a failure between AS3 and AS1.
To realize this routing agreement, AS3 requests that its provider AS1 adjust its BGP "LOCAL PREF" configuration so that AS1 reaches AS4 via AS2.
: Typical Backup Scenario Primarily due to scalability and management concerns, most providers only perform "LOCAL PREF" customization based on ASs, not on IP prefixes.
If IP prefix based "LOCAL PREF" configuration is needed, a technique known as as the BGP AS path manipulation can be used.
However, it is currently only available in certain vendor's products.
There are several drawbacks with the the practice of AS based BGP "LOCAL PREF" configuration at the provider level: The implementation tends to less efficient due to the process of coordination and configuration.
More importantly, the process needs to be repeated each time a change (e.g., adding a new AS) occurs.
The AS based customization complicates router configuration and increases complexity of network operation.
It has become a serious scalability issue for providers.
It can not implement prefix based configuration without the AS path manipulation (i.e., using fake AS).
Keeping configuration up to date is some times problematic.
How the BGP Community Attribute Can Help 3.1 Overview of the Community Attribute
The BGP community path attribute is an optional transitive attribute of variable length [1,2].
The attribute consists of a set of four octet values, each of which specify a community.
The community attribute values are encoded using an AS number in the first two octets, with the remaining two octets defined by the AS.
As defined in [2], a community is a group of destinations (i.e. prefixes) that share some common attribute.
Each destination can belong to multiple communities.
All prefixes with the community attribute belong to the communities listed in the attribute.
The BGP community  allows one to group a set of prefixes and perform routing decisions based on the identity of the group.
NO EXPORT (0xFFFFFF01) and NO ADVERTISE (0xFFFFFF02) are intuitive,  and can be used for optimizing routing and for improving route aggregation.
3.2 Community based Configuration With the BGP community attribute [2], a provider can now use community based, rather than AS based, configuration of BGP "LOCAL PREF".
The provider first needs to coordinate with its customers a set of communities to be mapped to certain BGP "LOCAL PREF" values.
The provider can then apply a uniform BGP configuration to all its customers that would capture routes with the community values, and set up the appropriate BGP "LOCAL PREF" values accordingly.
A customer that requires customization in its provider BGP "LOCAL PREF" configuration can simply send the appropriate community values in its routing announcements.
The major advantages of using this technique include: The customer has full control in the process, which makes a lot of sense as the customer is in a position to have better understanding about its own topology and routing policy requirement.
The effect of route based customization in BGP "LOCAL PREF" configuration by providers can now be achieved, thus, removing the need of AS Path manipulation in certain cases.
It addresses the scalability issue facing providers as it distributes the configuration work to the customer that requires customization.
A Real World Implementation Example MCI currently makes heavy use of the BGP "LOCAL PREF" attribute value as part of its routing policy configuration process.
Different BGP "LOCAL PREF" values are assigned for routes from different sources.
Table 1 details these values:
: The value '100' is the default value used within our network configuration.
In most cases, the MED attribute set by a customer is sufficient for customer backup routes (e.g., T1 backs up T3).
However, in certain cases configuration of "LOCAL PREF" will still be necessary until the BGP DPA attribute is available.
To make use of the BGP community attribute, several community values (MCI's AS number: 3561
0x0DE9) have been defined that can be used by customers to tag routes so that the appropriate "LOCAL PREF" values are configured.
Table 2 lists the appropriate community attribute values (and the mappings of community to LOCAL PREF):
A customer requiring MCI to configure BGP "LOCAL PREF" values other than the default can tag their routes with the defined communities.
The community values can be configured either based on an AS path list or an IP address access list.
A cisco systems software specific configuration example is given in Appendix A to show how this can be achieved.
A uniform BGP configuration (see Appendix B, again cisco systems software specific) is applied by MCI to peers with customers that configure the appropriate "LOCAL PREF" values based on the communities received.
This technique has been tested and is in use with several customers, and the response has been very positive.
We are in the process of migrating all other customized BGP "LOCAL PREF" configurations to this uniform community based configuration approach.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
Appendix These appendices list cisco systems software specific configuration examples for configuring communities, and for uniform route map definition that sets up the appropriate "LOCAL PREF" values based on the corresponding community values.
These examples are given purely to show a working example of how the desired effect discussed in this document can be achieved.
Please refer to [6] for more specific information on cisco configuration and syntax.
The community values can be configured either based upon an AS path list or based an IP address access list.
Here is an example that includes both cases: !!
router bgp xxxx neighbor x.x.x.x remote as 3561 neighbor x.x.x.x filter list 20 out neighbor x.x.x.x route map config community out
# match all ip as path access list 1 permit .
# list of customer ASs ip as path access list 20 permit ^$
ip as path access list 20 permit ^64700  ip as path access list 20 deny .
# AS path based matching, backup for another ISPs customer ip as path access list
ip as path access list
ip as path access list 40 deny .
# route map route map config community permit 10 match as path 40
set community 0x0DE90046 route map config community permit 20 match as path 1 !
The community can also be configured based on IP prefixes instead of AS numbers.
101 permit ip 192.160.154.0 0.0.0.0
route map config community permit 10 match ip address
101 set community 0x0DE90046 route map config community permit 20 match as path 1 !
Appendix B. Uniform Route map Configuration Here is the uniform route map that can be used for all BGP customers: !!
# routes primary via another ISP ip community list 70 permit 0x0DE90046
# routes also homed to another ISP, but with DPA or !!
# AS path length as the tie breaker ip community list
# customer backup routes ip community list 90 permit
# the route map applied to BGP customers route map set customer local pref permit 10 match community 70 set local preference 70 route map set customer local pref permit 20 match community 80 set local preference 80 route map set customer local pref permit 30 match community 90 set local preference
90 route map set customer local pref permit 40 match as path 1 set local preference 100 !
