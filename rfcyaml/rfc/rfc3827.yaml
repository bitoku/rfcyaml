- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The snoop file format provides a way to store and exchange datalink\n\
    \   layer packet traces.  This document describes extensions to this file\n  \
    \ format to support new media.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC1761] defines the snoop file format used to store captured\n\
    \   network packets for tools that capture, display, and interpret\n   network\
    \ traffic.  The file format specifies a header containing the\n   Datalink Type\
    \ field that identifies the network's datalink type.\n   This document defines\
    \ new values for this field, as well as an IANA\n   registry for future datalink\
    \ types.\n"
- title: 2.  New Datalink Types
  contents:
  - "2.  New Datalink Types\n   In addition to the Datalink Type codes listed in [RFC1761],\
    \ this\n   document defines the following type codes for the corresponding\n \
    \  media:\n             Datalink Type           Code\n             Fibre Channel\
    \           16\n             ATM                     17\n             ATM Classical\
    \ IP        18\n             IP over Infiniband      26\n   The IP over Infiniband\
    \ packet format is described in [IPoIB].\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This document created a new IANA registry named \"\
    Snoop Datalink\n   Types\" to hold the various possible 32-bit (4 octet) snoop\
    \ datalink\n   types.  This new registry holds the values previously defined in\n\
    \   [RFC1761] and tabulated below:\n             Datalink Type           Code\n\

    \ the new registry also holds the values defined above in\n   section 2 of this\
    \ document.\n   All new allocations and assignments to this registry starting\
    \ from\n   code 27 will follow the First Come First Served policy outlined in\n\
    \   [BCP0026].  Type codes up to 26 not defined by this section of the\n   document\
    \ (10-15 and 19-25) are considered reserved.\n"
