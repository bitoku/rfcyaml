- title: 2.1.  Ethernet Bridge Network
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Ethernet Bridge Network\n   In this document, \"Ethernet bridge network\"\
    \ refers to the Ethernet\n   bridge/switch network defined in IEEE 802.1Q [IEEE802.1Q].\
    \  In a\n   bridge network, a data frame is an Ethernet frame; data forwarding\
    \ is\n   based on destination Media Access Control (MAC) address; MAC\n   reachability\
    \ is learned in the data plane based on the source MAC\n   address and the port\
    \ (or tagged port) on which the frame arrives; and\n   the MAC aging mechanism\
    \ is used to remove inactive MAC addresses from\n   the MAC forwarding table on\
    \ an Ethernet switch.\n   Data frames arriving at a switch may be destined to\
    \ known unicast,\n   unknown unicast, multicast, or broadcast MAC destinations.\
    \  Unknown\n   unicast, multicast, and broadcast frames are forwarded in a similar\n\
    \   way, i.e., to every port except the ingress port on which the frame\n   arrives.\
    \  Multicast forwarding can be further constrained when using\n   multicast control\
    \ protocol snooping or using multicast MAC\n   registration protocols [IEEE802.1Q].\n\
    \   An Ethernet host receiving an Ethernet frame checks the destination\n   address\
    \ in the frame to decide whether it is the intended\n   destination.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.  MEF Multipoint Ethernet Services: E-LAN and E-Tree\n   MEF 6.1 [MEF6.1]\
    \ defines two multipoint Ethernet Service types:\n   o  E-LAN (Ethernet LAN),\
    \ a multipoint-to-multipoint service\n   o  E-Tree (Ethernet Tree), a rooted-multipoint\
    \ service\n   The MEF defines User-Network Interface (UNI) in a multipoint service\n\
    \   as the Ethernet interface between Customer Equipment (CE) and a\n   Provider\
    \ Edge (PE), i.e., the PE can send and receive Ethernet frames\n   to/from the\
    \ CE.  The MEF also defines UNI roles in a multipoint\n   service.  One role is\
    \ Root, and another is Leaf.\n   Note that MEF UNI in a service is equivalent\
    \ to the Attachment\n   Circuit (AC) defined in L2VPN [RFC4664].  The Root AC\
    \ and Leaf AC\n   defined in this document are the same as the Root UNI and Leaf\
    \ UNI as\n   defined in MEF 10.3 [MEF10.3].  The terms \"Root AC\" and \"Leaf\
    \ AC\" are\n   used in the following MEF service description.\n   For an E-LAN\
    \ service, all ACs have the Root role, which means that\n   any AC can communicate\
    \ with other ACs in the service.  The E-LAN\n   service defined by the MEF may\
    \ be implemented by IETF L2VPN solutions\n   such as VPLS and EVPN [EVPN].\n \
    \  An E-Tree service has one or more Root ACs and at least two Leaf ACs.\n   An\
    \ E-Tree service supports communication among the roots and between\n   a root\
    \ and a leaf but prohibits communication among the leaves.\n   Existing IETF L2VPN\
    \ solutions can't support the E-Tree service.  This\n   document specifies the\
    \ E-Tree architecture reference model that\n   supports the E-Tree service defined\
    \ by the MEF [MEF6.1].  Section 4\n   will discuss different E-Tree use cases.\n"

- title: 2.3.1.  Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)\n   VPLS [RFC4761] [RFC4762] is an\
    \ L2VPN solution that provides\n   multipoint-to-multipoint Ethernet connectivity\
    \ across IP/MPLS\n   networks.  VPLS emulates traditional Ethernet Virtual LAN\
    \ (VLAN)\n   services in MPLS networks and may support MEF E-LAN services.\n \
    \  A data frame in VPLS is an Ethernet frame.  Data forwarding in a VPLS\n   instance\
    \ is based on the destination MAC address and the VLAN on\n   which the frame\
    \ arrives.  MAC reachability learning is performed in\n   the data plane based\
    \ on the source address and the AC or pseudowire\n   (PW) on which the frame arrives.\
    \  MAC aging is the mechanism used to\n   remove inactive MAC addresses from a\
    \ VPLS switching instance (VSI) on\n   a PE.  VPLS supports forwarding for known\
    \ unicast frames, as well as\n   unknown unicast, broadcast, and multicast Ethernet\
    \ frames.\n   Many service providers have deployed VPLS in their networks to\n\
    \   provide L2VPN services to customers.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Ethernet VPN (EVPN)\n   Ethernet VPN [EVPN] is an enhanced L2VPN solution\
    \ that emulates an\n   Ethernet LAN or virtual LAN(s) across MPLS networks.\n\
    \   EVPN supports active-active multihoming of CEs and uses the\n   Multiprotocol\
    \ Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) control plane to\n   advertise MAC address\
    \ reachability from an ingress PE to egress PEs.\n   Thus, a PE learns MAC addresses\
    \ that are reachable over local ACs in\n   the data plane and other MAC addresses\
    \ reachable across the MPLS\n   network over remote ACs via the EVPN MP-BGP control\
    \ plane.  As a\n   result, EVPN aims to support large-scale L2VPN with better\
    \ resiliency\n   compared to VPLS.\n   EVPN is a relatively new technique and\
    \ is still under development in\n   the IETF L2VPN WG.\n"

    \ ATM, Ethernet, PPP, etc.\n   In the case of Ethernet ACs, VPMS provides single\
    \ coverage of\n   receiver membership, i.e., there is no differentiation among\n\
    \   multicast groups in one VPN.  The destination address in the Ethernet\n  \
    \ frame is not used in data forwarding.\n   VPMS supports unidirectional point-to-multipoint\
    \ transport from a\n   sender to multiple receivers and may support reverse transport\
    \ in a\n   point-to-point manner.\n"
- title: 3.  E-Tree Architecture Reference Model
  contents:
  - "3.  E-Tree Architecture Reference Model\n   Figure 1 illustrates the E-Tree architecture\
    \ reference model.  Three\n   Provider Edges -- PE1, PE2, and PE3 -- are shown\
    \ in the figure.  Each\n   PE has a Virtual Service Instance (VSI) associated\
    \ with an E-Tree\n   service instance.  A CE attaches to the VSI on a PE via an\
    \ AC.  Each\n   AC must be configured with a Root or Leaf role.  In Figure 1,\
    \ AC1,\n   AC2, AC5, AC6, AC9, and AC10 are Root ACs; AC3, AC4, AC7, AC8, AC11,\n\
    \   and AC12 are Leaf ACs.  This implies that a PE (local or remote)\n   processes\
    \ the Ethernet frames from CE01, CE02, etc., as if they\n   originated from a\
    \ Root AC, and it processes the Ethernet frames from\n   CE03, CE04, etc., as\
    \ if they originated from a Leaf AC.\n   Under this architecture model, the forwarding\
    \ rules among the ACs,\n   regardless of whether the sending AC and receiving\
    \ AC are on the same\n   PE or on different PEs, are described as follows:\n \
    \  o  An egress frame (the frame to be transmitted over an AC) at an AC\n    \
    \  with Root role must be the result of an ingress frame at an AC\n      (the\
    \ frame received at an AC) that has Root or Leaf role and is\n      attached to\
    \ the same E-Tree service instance.\n   o  An egress frame at the AC with Leaf\
    \ role must be the result of an\n      ingress frame at an AC that has Root role\
    \ and is attached to the\n      same E-Tree service instance.\n              \

    \            Figure 1: E-Tree Architecture Reference Model\n   These rules apply\
    \ to all frame types, i.e., known unicast, unknown\n   unicast, broadcast, and\
    \ multicast.  For known unicast frames,\n   forwarding in a VSI context is based\
    \ on the destination MAC address.\n   A VSI on a PE corresponds to an E-Tree service\
    \ instance and maintains\n   a MAC forwarding table that is isolated from other\
    \ VSI tables on the\n   PE.  It also keeps track of local AC roles.  The VSI receives\
    \ a frame\n   from an AC or across the MPLS core, and it forwards the frame to\n\
    \   another AC over which the destination is reachable according to the\n   VSI\
    \ forwarding table and forwarding rules described above.  When the\n   target\
    \ AC is on a remote PE, the VSI forwards the frame to the remote\n   PE over the\
    \ MPLS core.  Forwarding over the MPLS core will be\n   dependent on the E-Tree\
    \ solution.  For instance, a solution may adopt\n   PWs to mesh VSIs as in VPLS\
    \ and to forward frames over VSIs subject\n   to the E-Tree forwarding rules.\
    \  Alternatively, a solution may adopt\n   the EVPN forwarding paradigm constrained\
    \ by the E-Tree forwarding\n   rules.  Thus, solutions that satisfy the E-Tree\
    \ requirements could be\n   extensions to VPLS and EVPN.\n   In most use cases,\
    \ an E-Tree service has only a few Root ACs (root CE\n   sites) but many Leaf\
    \ ACs (leaf CE sites).  Furthermore, a PE may have\n   only Root ACs or only Leaf\
    \ ACs.  Figure 1 provides a general E-Tree\n   architecture model.\n"

    \ or\n   multiple Root ACs in one E-Tree service.  The need for multiple Root\n\
    \   ACs may be driven by a redundancy requirement or by having multiple\n   serving\
    \ sites.  Whether a particular E-Tree service needs to support\n   one or multiple\
    \ Root ACs depends on the application.\n"

  - "5.  L2VPN Gaps for Emulating MEF E-Tree Service\n   The MEF E-Tree service defines\
    \ special forwarding rules that prohibit\n   forwarding Ethernet frames among\
    \ leaves.  This poses some challenges\n   to IETF L2VPN solutions such as VPLS\
    \ and EVPN in emulating E-Tree\n   service over an MPLS network.  There are two\
    \ major issues described\n   in the following subsections.\n"
- title: 5.1.  No Differentiation on AC Role
  contents:
  - "5.1.  No Differentiation on AC Role\n   IP/MPLS L2VPN architecture has no distinct\
    \ roles on Attachment\n   Circuits (ACs) and supports any-to-any connectivity\
    \ among all ACs.\n   It does not have any mechanism to support forwarding constraints\n\
    \   based on an AC role.  However, the MEF E-Tree service defines two AC\n   roles\
    \ -- Root and Leaf -- and defines the forwarding rules based on\n   the originating\
    \ and receiving AC roles of a given frame.\n"
- title: 5.2.  No AC Role Indication or Advertisement
  contents:
  - "5.2.  No AC Role Indication or Advertisement\n   In an L2VPN, when a PE, say\
    \ PE2, receives a frame from another PE,\n   say PE1, over the MPLS core, PE2\
    \ does not know if the frame from PE1\n   is originated from a Root AC or Leaf\
    \ AC.  This causes the forwarding\n   issue on PE2 because the E-Tree forwarding\
    \ rules require that the\n   forwarder must know the role of the frame origin,\
    \ i.e., from Root AC\n   or Leaf AC.  This is specifically important when PE2\
    \ has both Root AC\n   and Leaf AC attached to the VSI.  E-Tree forwarding rules\
    \ apply to\n   all types of frames (known unicast destination, unknown unicast\n\
    \   destination, multicast, and broadcast).\n"
- title: 5.3.  Other Issues
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Other Issues\n   Some desirable requirements for IETF E-Tree are specific\
    \ to an\n   IP/MPLS L2VPN implementation such as Leaf-only PE.  A Leaf-only PE\
    \ is\n   a PE that only has Leaf AC(s) in an E-Tree service instance; thus,\n\
    \   other PEs on the same E-Tree service instance do not necessarily\n   forward\
    \ the frames originated from a Leaf AC to the Leaf-only PE,\n   which may save\
    \ some network resources.  It is also desirable for an\n   E-Tree solution to\
    \ work with existing PEs that support single-role\n   ACs, where the role is equivalent\
    \ to the root in an E-Tree service.\n   These requirements are described in the\
    \ E-Tree requirement document\n   [RFC7152].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   An E-Tree service may be deployed for security\
    \ reasons to prohibit\n   communication among sites (leaves).  An E-Tree solution\
    \ must enforce\n   E-Tree forwarding constraints.  The solution must also guarantee\
    \ that\n   Ethernet frames do not leak outside of the E-Tree service instance\
    \ to\n   which they belong.\n   An E-Tree service prohibits communication among\
    \ leaf sites but does\n   not have knowledge of higher-layer security constraints.\
    \  Therefore,\n   in general, higher-layer applications cannot rely on E-Tree\
    \ to\n   provide security protection unless all security constraints are fully\n\
    \   implemented by the E-Tree service.\n   Enhancing L2VPN for E-Tree services\
    \ inherits the same security issues\n   described in the L2VPN framework document\
    \ [RFC4664].  These relate to\n   both control-plane and data-plane security issues\
    \ that may arise in\n   the following areas:\n   o  issues fully contained in\
    \ the provider network\n   o  issues fully contained in the customer network\n\
    \   o  issues in the customer-provider interface network\n   The framework document\
    \ has substantial discussions on the security\n   issues and potential solutions\
    \ to address them.  An E-Tree solution\n   must consider these issues and address\
    \ them properly.  VPLS [RFC4761]\n   [RFC4762] and/or EVPN [EVPN] will likely\
    \ be candidate solutions for\n   an E-Tree service over an MPLS network.  The\
    \ security capabilities\n   built into those solutions will be naturally adopted\
    \ when supporting\n   E-Tree.  For details, see the Security Considerations sections\
    \ in\n   [RFC4761], [RFC4762], and [EVPN].\n"
