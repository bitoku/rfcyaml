  - "1.  Problem, Goal, and Motivation\n   As the Internet has evolved and grown over\
    \ in recent years, it has\n   become evident that it is soon to face several serious\
    \ scaling\n   problems. These include:\n      1.   Exhaustion of the class B network\
    \ address space. One\n           fundamental cause of this problem is the lack\
    \ of a network\n           class of a size which is appropriate for mid-sized\n\
    \           organization; class C, with a maximum of 254 host\n           addresses,\
    \ is too small, while class B, which allows up to\n           65534 addresses,\
    \ is too large for most organizations.\n      2.   Growth of routing tables in\
    \ Internet routers beyond the\n           ability of current software, hardware,\
    \ and people to\n           effectively manage.\n      3.   Eventual exhaustion\
    \ of the 32-bit IP address space.\n   It has become clear that the first two of\
    \ these problems are likely\n   to become critical within the next one to three\
    \ years.  This memo\n   attempts to deal with these problems by proposing a mechanism\
    \ to slow\n   the growth of the routing table and the need for allocating new\
    \ IP\n   network numbers. It does not attempt to solve the third problem,\n  \
    \ which is of a more long-term nature, but instead endeavors to ease\n   enough\
    \ of the short to mid-term difficulties to allow the Internet to\n   continue\
    \ to function efficiently while progress is made on a longer-\n   term solution.\n\
    \   The proposed solution is to topologically allocate future IP address\n   assignment,\
    \ by allocating segments of the IP address space to the\n   transit routing domains.\n\
    \   This plan for allocating IP addresses should be undertaken as soon as\n  \
    \ possible.  We believe that this will suffice as a short term\n   strategy, to\
    \ fill the gap between now and the time when a viable long\n   term plan can be\
    \ put into place and deployed effectively.  This plan\n   should be viable for\
    \ at least three (3) years, after which time,\n   deployment of a suitable long\
    \ term solution is expected to occur.\n   This plan is primarily directed at the\
    \ first two problems listed\n   above.  We believe that the judicious use of variable-length\n\
    \   subnetting techniques should help defer the onset of the last problem\n  \
    \ problem, the exhaustion of the 32-bit address space. Note also that\n   improved\
    \ tools for performing address allocation in a \"supernetted\"\n   and variably-subnetted\
    \ world would greatly help the user community in\n   accepting these sometimes\
    \ confusing techniques. Efforts to create\n   some simple tools for this purpose\
    \ should be encouraged by the\n   Internet community.\n   Note that this plan\
    \ neither requires nor assumes that already\n   assigned addresses will be reassigned,\
    \ though if doing so were\n   possible, it would further reduce routing table\
    \ sizes. It is assumed\n   that routing technology will be capable of dealing\
    \ with the current\n   routing table size and with some reasonably small rate\
    \ of growth.\n   The emphasis of this plan is on significantly slowing the rate\
    \ of\n   this growth.\n   Note that this plan does not require domains to renumber\
    \ if they\n   change their attached transit routing domain.  Domains are encouraged\n\
    \   to renumber so that their individual address allocations do not need\n   to\
    \ be advertised.\n   This plan will not affect the deployment of any specific\
    \ long term\n   plan, and therefore, this document will not discuss any long term\n\
    \   plans for routing and address architectures.\n"
- title: 2.  CIDR address allocation
  contents:
  - "2.  CIDR address allocation\n   There are two basic components of this addressing\
    \ and routing plan:\n   one, to distribute the allocation of Internet address\
    \ space and two,\n   to provide a mechanism for the aggregation of routing information.\n\
    \   2.1  Aggregation and its limitations\n   One major goal of this addressing\
    \ plan is to allocate Internet\n   address space in such a manner as to allow\
    \ aggregation of routing\n   information along topological lines.  For simple,\
    \ single-homed\n   clients, the allocation of their address space out of a transit\n\
    \   routing domain's space will accomplish this automatically - rather\n   than\
    \ advertise a separate route for each such client, the transit\n   domain may\
    \ advertise a single aggregate route which describes all of\n   the destinations\
    \ connected to it. Unfortunately, not all sites are\n   singly-connected to the\
    \ network, so some loss of ability to aggregate\n   is realized for the non-trivial\
    \ cases.\n   There are two situations that cause a loss of aggregation efficiency.\n\
    \      o    Organizations which are multi-homed. Because multi-homed\n       \
    \    organizations must be advertised into the system by each of\n           their\
    \ service providers, it is often not feasible to\n           aggregate their routing\
    \ information into the address space\n           any one of those providers. Note\
    \ that they still may receive\n           their address allocation out of a transit\
    \ domain's address\n           space (which has other advantages), but their routing\n\
    \           information must still be explicitly advertised by most of\n     \
    \      their service providers (the exception being that if the\n           site's\
    \ allocation comes out of its least-preferable service\n           provider, then\
    \ that service provider need not advertise the\n           explicit route - longest-match\
    \ will insure that its\n           aggregated route is used to get to the site\
    \ on a backup\n           basis).  For this reason, the routing cost for these\n\
    \           organizations will typically be about the same as it is\n        \
    \   today.\n      o    Organizations which change service provider but do not\n\
    \           renumber. This has the effect of \"punching a hole\" in the\n    \
    \       aggregation of the original service provider's advertisement.\n      \
    \     This plan will handle the situation by requiring the newer\n           service\
    \ provider to advertise a specific advertisement for\n           the new client,\
    \ which is preferred by virtue of being the\n           longest match.  To maintain\
    \ efficiency of aggregation, it is\n           recommended that organizations\
    \ which do change service\n           providers plan to eventually migrate their\
    \ address\n           assignments from the old provider's space to that of the\
    \ new\n           provider. To this end, it is recommended that mechanisms to\n\
    \           facilitate such migration, including improved protocols and\n    \
    \       procedures for dynamic host address assignment, be developed.\n   Note\
    \ that some aggregation efficiency gain can still be had for\n   multi-homed sites\
    \ (and, in general, for any site composed of\n   multiple, logical IP network\
    \ numbers) - by allocating a contiguous\n   power-of-two block of network numbers\
    \ to the client (as opposed to\n   multiple, independent network numbers) the\
    \ client's routing\n   information may be aggregated into a single (net, mask)\
    \ pair. Also,\n   since the routing cost associated with assigning a multi-homed\
    \ site\n   out of a service provider's address space is no greater than the\n\
    \   current method of a random allocation by a central authority, it\n   makes\
    \ sense to allocate all address space out of blocks assigned to\n   service providers.\n\
    \   It is also worthwhile to mention that since aggregation may occur at\n   multiple\
    \ levels in the system, it may still be possible to aggregate\n   these anomalous\
    \ routes at higher levels of whatever hierarchy may be\n   present. For example,\
    \ if a site is multi-homed to two NSFNET regional\n   networks both of whom obtain\
    \ their address space from the NSFNET,\n   then aggregation by the NSFNET of routes\
    \ from the regionals will\n   include all routes to the multi-homed site.\n  \
    \ Finally, it should also be noted that deployment of the new\n   addressing plan\
    \ described in this document may (and should) begin\n   almost immediately but\
    \ effective use of the plan to aggregate routing\n   information will require\
    \ changes to some Inter-Domain routing\n   protocols. Likewise, deploying classless\
    \ Inter-Domain protocols\n   without deployment of the new address plan will not\
    \ allow useful\n   aggregation to occur (in other words, the addressing plan and\
    \ routing\n   protocol changes are both required for supernetting, and its\n \
    \  resulting reduction in table growth, to be effective.)  Note,\n   however,\
    \ that during the period of time between deployment of the\n   addressing plan\
    \ and deployment of the new protocols, the size of\n   routing tables may temporarily\
    \ grow very rapidly. This must be\n   considered when planning the deployment\
    \ of the two plans.\n   Note: in the discussion and examples which follow, the\
    \ network and\n   mask notation is used to represent routing destinations. This\
    \ is used\n   for illustration only and does not require that routing protocols\
    \ use\n   this representation in their updates.\n   2.2  Distributed allocation\
    \ of address space\n   The basic idea of the plan is to allocate one or more blocks\
    \ of Class\n   C network numbers to each network service provider. Organizations\n\
    \   using the network service provider for Internet connectivity are\n   allocated\
    \ bitmask-oriented subsets of the provider's address space as\n   required.\n\
    \   It is also worthwhile to mention that once inter-domain protocols\n   which\
    \ support classless network destinations are widely deployed, the\n   rules described\
    \ by this plan generalize to permit arbitrary\n   super/subnetting of the remaining\
    \ class A and class B address space\n   (the assumption being that classless inter-domain\
    \ protocols will\n   either allow for non-contiguous subnets to exist in the system\
    \ or\n   that all components of a sub-allocated class A/B will be contained\n\
    \   within a single routing domain). This will allow this plan to\n   continue\
    \ to be used in the event that the class C space is exhausted\n   before implementation\
    \ of a long-term solution is deployed.  This\n   alternative is discussed further\
    \ below in section 6.\n   Hierarchical sub-allocation of addresses in this manner\
    \ implies that\n   clients with addresses allocated out of a given service provider\
    \ are,\n   for routing purposes, part of that service provider and will be\n \
    \  routed via its infrastructure. This implies that routing information\n   about\
    \ multi-homed organizations, i.e., organizations connected to\n   more than one\
    \ network service provider, will still need to be known\n   by higher levels in\
    \ the hierarchy.\n   The advantages of hierarchical assignment in this fashion\
    \ are\n      a)  It is expected to be easier for a relatively small number of\n\
    \          service providers to obtain addresses from the central\n          authority,\
    \ rather than a much larger, and monotonically\n          increasing, number of\
    \ individual clients.  This is not to be\n          considered as a loss of part\
    \ of the service providers' address\n          space.\n      b)  Given the current\
    \ growth of the Internet, a scalable and\n          delegatable method of future\
    \ allocation of network numbers has\n          to be achieved.\n   For these reasons,\
    \ and in the interest of providing a consistent\n   procedure for obtaining Internet\
    \ addresses, it is recommended that\n   most, if not all, network numbers be distributed\
    \ through service\n   providers.  These issues are discussed in much greater length\
    \ in [2].\n"
- title: 3.  Cost-benefit analysis
  contents:
  - "3.  Cost-benefit analysis\n   This new method of assigning address through service\
    \ providers can be\n   put into effect immediately and will, from the start, have\
    \ the\n   benefit of distributing the currently centralized process of\n   assigning\
    \ new addresses. Unfortunately, before the benefit of\n   reducing the size of\
    \ globally-known routing destinations can be\n   achieved, it will be necessary\
    \ to deploy an Inter-Domain routing\n   protocol capable of handling arbitrary\
    \ network and mask pairs. Only\n   then will it be possible to aggregate individual\
    \ class C networks\n   into larger blocks represented by single routing table\
    \ entries.\n   This means that upon introduction, the new addressing allocation\
    \ plan\n   will not in and of itself help solve the routing table size problem.\n\
    \   Once the new Inter-Domain routing protocol is deployed, however, an\n   immediate\
    \ drop in the number of destinations which clients of the new\n   protocol must\
    \ carry will occur.  A detailed analysis of the magnitude\n   of this expected\
    \ drop and the permanent reduction in rate of growth\n   is given in the next\
    \ section.\n   In should also be noted that the present method of flat address\n\
    \   allocations imposes a large bureaucratic cost on the central address\n   allocation\
    \ authority. For scaling reasons unrelated to address space\n   exhaustion or\
    \ routing table overflow, this should be changed. Using\n   the mechanism proposed\
    \ in this paper will have the fortunate side\n   effect of distributing the address\
    \ allocation procedure, greatly\n   reducing the load on the central authority.\n\
    \   3.1  Present Allocation Figures\n   An informal analysis of \"network-contacts.txt\"\
    \ (available from the\n   DDN NIC) indicates that as of 2/25/92, 46 of 126 class\
    \ A network\n   numbers have been allocated (leaving 81) and 5467 of 16382 class\
    \ B\n   numbers have been allocated, leaving 10915. Assuming that recent\n   trends\
    \ continue, the number of allocated class B's will continue to\n   double approximately\
    \ once a year.  At this rate of growth, all class\n   B's will be exhausted within\
    \ about 15 months.  As of 1/13/93, 52\n   class A network numbers have been allocated\
    \ and 7133 class B's have\n   been allocated.  We suggest that the change in the\
    \ class B allocation\n   rate is due to the initial deployment of this address\
    \ allocation\n   plan.\n   3.2  Historic growth rates\n      MM/YY     ROUTES\

    \ is a small technical cost and minimal administrative cost\n   associated with\
    \ deployment of the new address assignment plan. The\n   administrative cost is\
    \ basically that of convincing the NIC, the\n   IANA, and the network service\
    \ providers to agree to this plan, which\n   is not expected to be too difficult.\
    \  In addition, administrative\n   cost for the central numbering authorities\
    \ (the NIC and the IANA)\n   will be greatly decreased by the deployment of this\
    \ plan.  To take\n   advantage of aggregation of routing information, however,\
    \ it is\n   necessary that the capability to represent routes as arbitrary\n \
    \  network and mask fields (as opposed to the current class A/B/C\n   distinction)\
    \ be added to the common Internet inter-domain routing\n   protocol(s).  Thus,\
    \ the technical cost is in the implementation of\n   classless interdomain routing\
    \ protocols.\n   3.3.1 Benefits of the new addressing plan\n   There are two benefits\
    \ to be had by deploying this plan:\n      o    The current problem with depletion\
    \ of the available class B\n           address space can be ameliorated by assigning\
    \ more-\n           appropriately sized blocks of class C's to mid-sized\n   \
    \        organizations (in the 200-4000 host range).\n      o    When the improved\
    \ inter-domain routing protocol is deployed,\n           an immediate decrease\
    \ in the number routing table entries\n           should occur, followed by a\
    \ significant reduction in the rate\n           growth of routing table size (for\
    \ default-free routers).\n   3.3.2 Growth rate projections\n   As of Jan '92,\
    \ a default-free routing table (for example, the routing\n   tables maintained\
    \ by the routers in the NSFNET backbone) contained\n   approximately 4700 entries.\
    \ This number reflects the current size of\n   the NSFNET routing database. Historic\
    \ data shows that this number, on\n   average, has doubled every 10 months between\
    \ 1988 and 1991. Assuming\n   that this growth rate is going to persist in the\
    \ foreseeable future\n   (and there is no reason to assume otherwise), we expect\
    \ the number of\n   entries in a default-free routing table to grow to approximately\n\
    \   30000 in two years time.  In the following analysis, we assume that\n   the\
    \ growth of the Internet has been, and will continue to be,\n   exponential.\n\
    \   It should be stressed that these projections do not consider that the\n  \
    \ current shortage of class B network numbers may increase the number\n   of instances\
    \ where many class C's are used rather than a class B.\n   Using an assumption\
    \ that new organizations which formerly obtained\n   class B's will now obtain\
    \ somewhere between 4 and 16 class C's, the\n   rate of routing table growth can\
    \ conservatively be expected to at\n   least double and probably quadruple. This\
    \ means the number of entries\n   in a default-free routing table may well exceed\
    \ 10,000 entries within\n   six months and 20,000 entries in less than a year.\n\
    \   As of Dec '92, the routing table contains 8500 routes.  The original\n   growth\
    \ curves would predict over 9400 routes.  At this time, it is\n   not clear if\
    \ this would indicate a significant change in the rate of\n   growth.\n   Under\
    \ the proposed plan, growth of the routing table in a default-\n   free router\
    \ is greatly reduced since most new address assignment will\n   come from one\
    \ of the large blocks allocated to the service providers.\n   For the sake of\
    \ this analysis, we assume prompt implementation of\n   this proposal and deployment\
    \ of the revised routing protocols. We\n   make the initial assumption that any\
    \ initial block given to a\n   provider is sufficient to satisfy its needs for\
    \ two years.\n   Since under this plan, multi-homed networks must continue to\
    \ be\n   explicitly advertised throughout the system (according to Rule #1\n \
    \  described in section 4.2), the number multi-homed routes is expected\n   to\
    \ be the dominant factor in future growth of routing table size,\n   once the\
    \ supernetting plan is applied.\n   Presently, it is estimated that there are\
    \ fewer than 100 multi-homed\n   organizations connected to the Internet. Each\
    \ such organization's\n   network is comprised of one or more network numbers.\
    \  In many cases\n   (and in all future cases under this plan), the network numbers\
    \ used\n   by an organization are consecutive, meaning that aggregation of those\n\
    \   networks during route advertisement may be possible. This means that\n   the\
    \ number of routes advertised within the Internet for multi-homed\n   networks\
    \ may be approximated as the total number of multi-homed\n   organizations.  Assuming\
    \ that the number of multi-homed organization\n   will double every year (which\
    \ may be a over-estimation, given that\n   every connection costs money), the\
    \ number of routes for multi-homed\n   networks would be expected to grow to approximately\
    \ 800 in three\n   years.\n   If we further assume that there are approximately\
    \ 100 service\n   providers, then each service provider will also need to advertise\
    \ its\n   block of addresses.  However, due to aggregation, these\n   advertisements\
    \ will be reduced to only 100 additional routes.  We\n   assume that after the\
    \ initial two years, new service providers\n   combined with additional requests\
    \ from existing providers will\n   require an additional 50 routes per year. \
    \ Thus, the total is 4700 +\n   800 + 150 = 5650.  This represents an annual growth\
    \ rate of\n   approximately 6%.  This is in clear contrast to the current annual\n\
    \   growth of 130%.  This analysis also assumes an immediate deployment\n   of\
    \ this plan with full compliance. Note that this analysis assumes\n   only a single\
    \ level of route aggregation in the current Internet -\n   intelligent address\
    \ allocation should significantly improve this.\n   Clearly, this is not a very\
    \ conservative assumption in the Internet\n   environment nor can 100% adoption\
    \ of this proposal be expected.\n   Still, with only a 90% participation in this\
    \ proposal by service\n   providers, at the end of the target three years, global\
    \ routing table\n   size will be \"only\" 4700 + 800 + 145 + 7500 = 13145 routes\
    \ -- without\n   any action, the routing table will grow to approximately 75000\
    \ routes\n   during that time period.\n"

  - "4.  Changes to inter-domain routing protocols and practices\n   In order to support\
    \ supernetting efficiently, it is clear that some\n   changes will need to be\
    \ made to both routing protocols themselves and\n   to the way in which routing\
    \ information is interpreted. In the case\n   of \"new\" inter-domain protocols,\
    \ the actual protocol syntax changes\n   should be relatively minor. This mechanism\
    \ will not work with older\n   inter-domain protocols such as EGP2; the only ways\
    \ to interoperate\n   with old systems using such protocols are either to use\
    \ existing\n   mechanisms for providing \"default\" routes or b) require that\
    \ new\n   routers talking to old routers \"explode\" supernet information into\n\
    \   individual network numbers.  Since the first of these is trivial\n   while\
    \ the latter is cumbersome (at best -- consider the memory\n   requirements it\
    \ imposes on the receiver of the exploded information),\n   it is recommended\
    \ that the first approach be used -- that older\n   systems to continue to the\
    \ mechanisms they currently employ for\n   default handling.\n   Note that a basic\
    \ assumption of this plan is that those organizations\n   which need to import\
    \ \"supernet\" information into their routing\n   systems must run IGPs (such\
    \ as OSPF [1]) which support classless\n   routes. Systems running older IGPs\
    \ may still advertise and receive\n   \"supernet\" information, but they will\
    \ not be able to propagate such\n   information through their routing domains.\n\
    \   4.1  Protocol-independent semantic changes\n   There are two fundamental changes\
    \ which must be applied to Inter-\n   Domain routing protocols in order for this\
    \ plan to work. First, the\n   concept of network \"class\" needs to be deprecated\
    \ - this plan assumes\n   that routing destinations are represented by network\
    \ and mask pairs\n   and that routing is done on a longest-match basis (i.e.,\
    \ for a given\n   destination which matches multiple network+mask pairs, the match\
    \ with\n   the longest mask is used).  Second, current inter-domain protocols\n\
    \   generally do not support the concept of route aggregation, so the new\n  \
    \ semantics need to be implemented in a new set of inter-domain\n   protocols.\
    \ In particular, when doing aggregation, dealing with\n   multi-homed sites or\
    \ destinations which change service providers is\n   difficult. Fortunately, it\
    \ is possible to define several fairly\n   simple rules for dealing with such\
    \ cases.\n   4.2.  Rules for route advertisement\n      1.   Routing to all destinations\
    \ must be done on a longest-match\n           basis only.  This implies that destinations\
    \ which are multi-\n           homed relative to a routing domain must always\
    \ be explicitly\n           announced into that routing domain - they cannot be\
    \ summarized\n           (this makes intuitive sense - if a network is multi-homed,\
    \ all\n           of its paths into a routing domain which is \"higher\" in the\n\
    \           hierarchy of networks must be known to the \"higher\" network).\n\
    \      2.   A routing domain which performs summarization of multiple\n      \
    \     routes must discard packets which match the summarization but\n        \
    \   do not match any of the explicit routes which makes up the\n           summarization.\
    \ This is necessary to prevent routing loops in\n           the presence of less-specific\
    \ information (such as a default\n           route).  Implementation note - one\
    \ simple way to implement\n           this rule would be for the border router\
    \ to maintain a \"sink\"\n           route for each of its aggregations. By the\
    \ rule of longest\n           match, this would cause all traffic destined to\
    \ components of\n           the aggregation which are not explicitly known to\
    \ be\n           discarded.\n   Note that during failures, partial routing of\
    \ traffic to a site which\n   takes its address space from one service provider\
    \ but which is\n   actually reachable only through another (i.e., the case of\
    \ a site\n   which has change service providers) may occur because such traffic\n\
    \   will be routed along the path advertised by the aggregated route.\n   Rule\
    \ #2 will prevent any real problem from occurring by forcing such\n   traffic\
    \ to be discarded by the advertiser of the aggregated route,\n   but the output\
    \ of \"traceroute\" and other similar tools will suggest\n   that a problem exists\
    \ within the service provider advertising the\n   aggregate, which may be confusing\
    \ to network operators (see the\n   example in section 5.2 for details). Solutions\
    \ to this problem appear\n   to be challenging and not likely to be implementable\
    \ by current\n   Inter-Domain protocols within the time-frame suggested by this\n\
    \   document. This decision may need to be revisited as Inter-Domain\n   protocols\
    \ evolve.\n   An implementation following these rules should also be generalized,\n\
    \   so that an arbitrary network number and mask are accepted for all\n   routing\
    \ destinations.  The only outstanding constraint is that the\n   mask must be\
    \ left contiguous.  Note that the degenerate route 0.0.0.0\n   mask 0.0.0.0 is\
    \ used as a default route and MUST be accepted by all\n   implementations.  Further,\
    \ to protect against accidental\n   advertisements of this route via the inter-domain\
    \ protocol, this\n   route should never be advertised unless there is specific\n\
    \   configuration information indicating to do so.\n   Systems which process route\
    \ announcements must also be able to verify\n   that information which they receive\
    \ is correct. Thus, implementations\n   of this plan which filter route advertisements\
    \ must also allow masks\n   in the filter elements.  To simplify administration,\
    \ it would be\n   useful if filter elements automatically allowed more specific\
    \ network\n   numbers and masks to pass in filter elements given for a more general\n\
    \   mask.  Thus, filter elements which looked like:\n        accept 128.32.0.0\n\
    \        accept 128.120.0.0\n        accept 134.139.0.0\n        deny 36.2.0.0\n\
    \        accept 36.0.0.0\n   would look something like:\n        accept 128.32.0.0\
    \ 255.255.0.0\n        accept 128.120.0.0 255.255.0.0\n        accept 134.139.0.0\
    \ 255.255.0.0\n        deny 36.2.0.0 255.255.0.0\n        accept 36.0.0.0 255.0.0.0\n\
    \   This is merely making explicit the network mask which was implied by\n   the\
    \ class A/B/C classification of network numbers.\n   4.3.  How the rules work\n\
    \   Rule #1 guarantees that the routing algorithm used is consistent\n   across\
    \ implementations and consistent with other routing protocols,\n   such as OSPF.\
    \ Multi-homed networks are always explicitly advertised\n   by every service provider\
    \ through which they are routed even if they\n   are a specific subset of one\
    \ service provider's aggregate (if they\n   are not, they clearly must be explicitly\
    \ advertised). It may seem as\n   if the \"primary\" service provider could advertise\
    \ the multi-homed\n   site implicitly as part of its aggregate, but the assumption\
    \ that\n   longest-match routing is always done causes this not to work.\n   Rule\
    \ #2 guarantees that no routing loops form due to aggregation.\n   Consider a\
    \ mid-level network which has been allocated the 2048 class\n   C networks starting\
    \ with 192.24.0.0 (see the example in section 5 for\n   more on this).  The mid-level\
    \ advertises to a \"backbone\"\n   192.24.0.0/255.248.0.0. Assume that the \"\
    backbone\", in turn, has been\n   allocated the block of networks 192.0.0.0/255.0.0.0.\
    \ The backbone\n   will then advertise this aggregate route to the mid-level.\
    \ Now, if\n   the mid-level loses internal connectivity to the network\n   192.24.1.0/255.255.255.0\
    \ (which is part of its aggregate), traffic\n   from the \"backbone\" to the mid-level\
    \ to destination 192.24.1.1 will\n   follow the mid-level's advertised route.\
    \ When that traffic gets to\n   the mid-level, however, the mid-level *must not*\
    \ follow the route\n   192.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 it learned from the backbone, since\
    \ that would\n   result in a routing loop. Rule #2 says that the mid-level may\
    \ not\n   follow a less-specific route for a destination which matches one of\n\
    \   its own aggregated routes. Note that handling of the \"default\" route\n \
    \  (0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0) is a special case of this rule - a network must not\n   follow\
    \ the default to destinations which are part of one of it's\n   aggregated advertisements.\n\
    \   4.4.  Responsibility for and configuration of aggregation\n   The domain which\
    \ has been allocated a range of addresses has the sole\n   authority for aggregation\
    \ of its address space.  In the usual case,\n   the AS will install manual configuration\
    \ commands in its border\n   routers to aggregate some portion of its address\
    \ space.  An domain\n   can also delegate aggregation authority to another domain.\
    \  In this\n   case, aggregation is done in the other domain by one of its border\n\
    \   routers.\n   When an inter-domain border router performs route aggregation,\
    \ it\n   needs to know the range of the block of IP addresses to be\n   aggregated.\
    \  The basic principle is that it should aggregate as much\n   as possible but\
    \ not to aggregate those routes which cannot be treated\n   as part of a single\
    \ unit due to multi-homing, policy, or other\n   constraints.\n   One mechanism\
    \ is to do aggregation solely based on dynamically\n   learned routing information.\
    \ This has the danger of not specifying a\n   precise enough range since when\
    \ a route is not present, it is not\n   always possible to distinguish whether\
    \ it is temporarily unreachable\n   or that it does not belong in the aggregate.\
    \ Purely dynamic routing\n   also does not allow the flexibility of defining what\
    \ to aggregate\n   within a range. The other mechanism is to do all aggregation\
    \ based on\n   ranges of blocks of IP addresses preconfigured in the router. \
    \ It is\n   recommended that preconfiguration be used, since it more flexible\
    \ and\n   allows precise specification of the range of destinations to\n   aggregate.\n\
    \   Preconfiguration does require some manually-maintained configuration\n   information,\
    \ but not excessively more so than what router\n   administrators already maintain\
    \ today. As an addition to the amount\n   of information that must be typed in\
    \ and maintained by a human,\n   preconfiguration is just a line or two defining\
    \ the range of the\n   block of IP addresses to aggregate. In terms of gathering\
    \ the\n   information, if the advertising router is doing the aggregation, its\n\
    \   administrator knows the information because the aggregation ranges\n   are\
    \ assigned to its domain.  If the receiving domain has been granted\n   the authority\
    \ to and task of performing aggregation, the information\n   would be known as\
    \ part of the agreement to delegate aggregation.\n   Given that it is common practice\
    \ that a network administrator learns\n   from its neighbor which routes it should\
    \ be willing to accept,\n   preconfiguration of aggregation information does not\
    \ introduce\n   additional administrative overhead.\n   Implementation note: aggregates\
    \ which encompass the class D address\n   space (multicast addresses) are currently\
    \ not well understood.  At\n   present, it appears that the optimal strategy is\
    \ to consider\n   aggregates to never encompass class D space, even if they do\
    \ so\n   numerically.\n   4.5  Intra-domain protocol considerations\n   While\
    \ no changes need be made to internal routing protocols to\n   support the advertisement\
    \ of aggregated routing information between\n   autonomous systems, it is often\
    \ the case that external routing\n   information is propagated within interior\
    \ protocols for policy\n   reasons or to aid in the propagation of information\
    \ through a transit\n   network. At the point when aggregated routing information\
    \ starts to\n   appear in the new exterior protocols, this practice of importing\n\
    \   external information will have to be modified.  A transit network\n   which\
    \ imports external information will have to do one of:\n      a) use an interior\
    \ protocol which supports aggregated routing\n      b) find some other method\
    \ of propagating external information\n         which does not involve flooding\
    \ it through the interior\n         protocol (i.e., by the use of internal BGP,\
    \ for example).\n      c) stop the importation of external information and flood\
    \ a\n         \"default\" route through the internal protocol for discovery\n\
    \         of paths to external destinations.\n   For case (a), the modifications\
    \ necessary to a routing protocol to\n   allow it to support aggregated information\
    \ may not be simple. For\n   protocols such as OSPF and IS-IS, which represent\
    \ routing information\n   as either a destination+mask (OSPF) or as a prefix+prefix-length\n\
    \   (IS-IS) changes to support aggregated information are conceptually\n   fairly\
    \ simple; for protocols which are dependent on the class-A/B/C\n   nature of networks\
    \ or which support only fixed-sized subnets, the\n   changes are of a more fundamental\
    \ nature. Even in the \"conceptually\n   simple\" cases of OSPF and IS-IS, an\
    \ implementation may need to be\n   modified to support supernets in the database\
    \ or in the forwarding\n   table.\n"

    \ and ending with 192.31.255.0 (0xC01FFF00)\n   allocated to a single network\

    \ would be described as 192.24.0.0\n   with mask of 255.248.0.0 (0xFFF80000).\n\
    \   Assume this service provider connects six clients in the following\n   order\
    \ (significant because it demonstrates how temporary \"holes\" may\n   form in\
    \ the service provider's address space):\n       \"C1\" requiring fewer than 2048\

    \ (16 class C networks)\n       \"C3\" requiring fewer than 1024 addresses (4\

    \ all cases, the number of IP addresses \"required\" by each client is\n   assumed\
    \ to allow for significant growth. The service provider\n   allocates its address\
    \ space as follows:\n       C1: allocate 192.24.0 through 192.24.7. This block\
    \ of networks is\n           described by the \"supernet\" route 192.24.0.0 and\

    \    the route 192.24.34.0, mask 255.255.254.0\n   Note that if the network provider\

    \ to) perform\n   \"supernetting\" at the point where he connects to his clients\

    \ assume\n   the existence of a client \"C7\" which was originally connected to\
    \ \"RB\"\n   but has moved to \"RA\". For this reason, it has a block of network\n\
    \   numbers which are allocated out \"RB\"'s block of (the next) 2048 class\n\
    \   C network numbers:\n       C7: allocate 192.32.0 through 192.32.15. This block\

    \ via \"RA\". To connect this mess together, we will assume\n   that \"RA\" and\

    \ to Rule #2) by\n   virtue of RB's less specific match 192.32.0.0/255.248.0.0.\
    \  While\n   this does not cause an operational problem (C7 is unreachable in\
    \ any\n   case), it does create some extra traffic across \"BB\" (and may also\n\
    \   prove confusing to a network manager debugging the outage with\n   \"traceroute\"\
    ). A mechanism to cache such unreachability information\n   would help here, but\

- title: 6.  Extending CIDR to class A addresses
  contents:
  - "6.  Extending CIDR to class A addresses\n   At some point, it is expected that\
    \ this plan will eventually consume\n   all of the remaining class C address space.\
    \  As of this writing, the\n   upper half of the class A address space has already\
    \ been reserved for\n   future expansion.  This section describes how the CIDR\
    \ plan can be\n   used to utilize this portion of the class A space efficiently.\
    \  It is\n   expected that this contingency would only be used if no long term\n\
    \   solution has become apparent by the time that the class C address\n   space\
    \ is consumed.\n   Fundamentally, there are two differences between using a class\
    \ A\n   address and a block of class C's.  First, the configuration of DNS\n \
    \  becomes somewhat more complicated than it is without the aggregation\n   of\
    \ class A subnets.  The second difference is that the routers within\n   the class\
    \ A address would need to support and use a classless IGP.\n   Maintenance of\
    \ DNS with a subnetted class A is somewhat painful.  As\n   part of the mechanism\
    \ for providing reverse address lookups, DNS\n   maintains a \"IN-ADDR.ARPA\"\
    \ reverse domain.  This is configured by\n   reversing the dotted decimal network\
    \ number, appending \"IN-ADDR.ARPA\"\n   and using this as a type of pseudo-domain.\
    \  Individual hosts then end\n   up pointing back to a host name.  Thus, for example,\
    \ 131.108.1.111\n   has a DNS record \"111.1.108.131.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\"  Since the\
    \ pseudo-\n   domains can only be delegated on a byte boundary, this becomes\n\
    \   painful if a stub domain receives a block of address space that does\n   not\
    \ fall on a byte boundary.  The solution in this case is to\n   enumerate all\
    \ of the possible byte combinations involved.  This is\n   painful, but workable.\
    \  This is discussed further below.\n   Routing within a class A used for CIDR\
    \ is also an interesting\n   challenge.  The usual case will be that a domain\
    \ will be assigned a\n   portion of the class A address space.  The domain can\
    \ either use an\n   IGP which allows variable length subnets or it can pick a\
    \ single\n   subnet mask to be used throughout the domain.  In the latter case,\n\
    \   difficulties arise because other domains have been allocated other\n   parts\
    \ of the class A address space and may be using a different\n   subnet mask. \
    \ If the domain is itself a transit, it may also need to\n   allocate some portion\
    \ of its space to a client, which might also use\n   a different subnet mask.\
    \  The client would then need routing\n   information about the remainder of the\
    \ class A.\n   If the client's IGP does not support variable length subnet masks,\n\
    \   this could be done by advertising the remainder of the class A's\n   address\
    \ space in appropriately sized subnets.  However, unless the\n   client has a\
    \ very large portion of the class A space, this is likely\n   to result in a large\
    \ number of subnets (for example, a mask of\n   255.255.255.0 would require a\
    \ total of 65535 subnets, including those\n   allocated to the client).  For this\
    \ reason, it may be preferable to\n   simply use an IGP that supports variable\
    \ length subnet masks within\n   the client's domain.\n   Similarly, if a transit\
    \ has been assigned address space from a class\n   A network number, it is likely\
    \ that it was not assigned the entire\n   class A, and that other transit domains\
    \ will get address space from\n   this class A.  In this case, the transit would\
    \ also have to inject\n   routing information about the remainder of the class\
    \ A into it's IGP.\n   This is analogous to the situation above, with the same\n\
    \   complications.  For this reason, we recommend that the use of a class\n  \
    \ A for CIDR only be attempted if IGP's with variable length subnet\n   mask support\
    \ be used throughout the class A.  Note that the IGP's\n   need not support supernetting,\
    \ as discussed above.\n   Note that the technique here could also apply to class\
    \ B addresses.\n   However, the limited number of available class B addresses\
    \ and their\n   usage for multihomed networks suggests that this address space\
    \ should\n   only be reserved for those large single organizations that warrant\n\
    \   this type of address. [2]\n"

  - "7.   Domain Service considerations\n   One aspect of Internet services which\
    \ will be notably affected by a\n   move to either \"supernetted\" class-C network\
    \ numbers or subdivided\n   class-A's will be the mechanism used for address-to-name\
    \ translation:\n   the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone of the domain system. Because this zone\
    \ is\n   delegated on octet boundaries only, any address allocation plan which\n\
    \   uses bitmask-oriented addressing will cause some degree of difficulty\n  \
    \ for those which maintain parts of the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.\n   7.1  Procedural\
    \ changes for class-C \"supernets\"\n   At the present time, parts of the IN-ADDR.ARPA\
    \ zone are delegated\n   only on network boundaries which happen to fall on octet\
    \ boundaries.\n   To aid in the use of blocks of class-C networks, it is recommended\n\
    \   that this policy be relaxed and allow the delegation of arbitrary,\n   octet-oriented\
    \ pieces of the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.\n   As an example of this policy change, consider\
    \ a hypothetical large\n   network provider named \"BigNet\" which has been allocated\
    \ the 1024\n   class-C networks 199.0.0 through 199.3.255. Under current policies,\n\
    \   the root domain servers would need to have 1024 entries of the form:\n   \
    \        0.0.199.IN-ADDR.ARPA.   IN      NS      NS1.BIG.NET.\n           1.0.199.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\
    \   IN      NS      NS1.BIG.NET.\n                   ....\n           255.3.199.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\
    \ IN      NS      NS1.BIG.NET.\n   By revising the policy as described above,\
    \ this is reduced only four\n   delegation records:\n           0.199.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\
    \     IN      NS      NS1.BIG.NET.\n           1.199.IN-ADDR.ARPA.     IN    \
    \  NS      NS1.BIG.NET.\n           2.199.IN-ADDR.ARPA.     IN      NS      NS1.BIG.NET.\n\
    \           3.199.IN-ADDR.ARPA.     IN      NS      NS1.BIG.NET.\n   The provider\
    \ would then maintain further delegations of naming\n   authority for each individual\
    \ class-C network which it assigns,\n   rather than having each registered separately.\
    \ Note that due to the\n   way the DNS is designed, it is still possible for the\
    \ root\n   nameservers to maintain the delegation information for individual\n\
    \   networks for which the provider is unwilling or unable to do so. This\n  \
    \ should greatly reduce the load on the domain servers for the \"top\"\n   levels\
    \ of the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain.  The example above illustrates\n   only the records\
    \ for a single nameserver.  In the normal case, there\n   are usually several\
    \ nameservers for each domain, thus the size of the\n   examples will double or\
    \ triple in the common cases.\n   7.2  Procedural changes for class-A subnetting\n\
    \   Should it be the case the class-A network numbers are subdivided into\n  \
    \ blocks allocated to transit network providers, it will be similarly\n   necessary\
    \ to relax the restriction on how IN-ADDR.ARPA naming works\n   for them. As an\
    \ example, take a provider is allocated the 19-bit\n   portion of address space\
    \ which matches 10.8.0.0 with mask\n   255.248.0.0. This represents all addresses\
    \ which begin with the\n   prefixes 10.8, 10.9, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14,\
    \ an 10.15 and\n   requires the following IN-ADDR.ARPA delegations:\n        \
    \   8.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.      IN      NS      NS1.MOBY.NET.\n           9.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\
    \      IN      NS      NS1.MOBY.NET.\n                   ....\n           15.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\
    \     IN      NS      NS1.MOBY.NET.\n   To further illustrate how IN-ADDR.ARPA\
    \ sub-delegation will work,\n   consider a company named \"FOO\" connected to\
    \ this provider which has\n   been allocated the 14-bit piece of address space\
    \ which matches\n   10.10.64.0 with mask 255.255.192.0. This represents all addresses\
    \ in\n   the range 10.10.64.0 through 10.10.127.255 and will require that the\n\
    \   provider implement the following IN-ADDR.ARPA delegations:\n           64.10.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\
    \  IN      NS      NS1.FOO.COM.\n           65.10.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IN      NS\
    \      NS1.FOO.COM.\n                   ....\n           127.10.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\
    \ IN      NS      NS1.FOO.COM.\n   with the servers for \"FOO.COM\" containing\

    \   and should be large enough to serve the provider for two years.\n   Further,\
    \ the NIC should distribute very large blocks to continental\n   and national\
    \ network service organizations to allow additional levels\n   of aggregation\
    \ to take place at the major backbone networks.  In\n   addition, the NIC should\
    \ modify its procedures for the IN-ADDR.ARPA\n   domain to permit delegation along\
    \ arbitrary octet boundaries.\n   Service providers will further allocate power-of-two\
    \ blocks of class\n   C addresses from their address space to their subscribers.\n\
    \   All organizations, including those which are multi-homed, should\n   obtain\
    \ address space from their provider (or one of their providers,\n   in the case\
    \ of the multi-homed).  These blocks should also fall on\n   bit boundaries to\
    \ permit easy route aggregation.\n   To allow effective use of this new addressing\
