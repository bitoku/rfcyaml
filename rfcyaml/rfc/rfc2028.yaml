  contents:
  - "2.2 The Working Group Chair\n   Each IETF Working Group is headed by a chair\
    \ (or by co-chairs) with\n   the responsibility for directing the group's activities,\
    \ presiding\n   over the group's meetings, and ensuring that the commitments of\
    \ the\n   group with respect to its role in the Internet standards process are\n\
    \   met. In particular, the WG chair is the formal point of contact\n   between\
    \ the WG and the IESG, via the Area Director of the area to\n   which the WG is\
    \ assigned.\n   The details on the selection and responsibilites of an IETF Working\n\

- title: 2.3  The Document Editor
  contents:
  - "2.3  The Document Editor\n   Most IETF Working Groups focus their efforts on\
    \ a document, or set of\n   documents, that capture the results of the group's\
    \ work.  A Working\n   Group generally designates a person or persons to serve\
    \ as the Editor\n   for a particular document.  The Document Editor is responsible\
    \ for\n   ensuring that the contents of the document accurately reflect the\n\
    \   decisions that have been made by the working group.\n   As a general practice,\
    \ the Working Group Chair and Document Editor\n   positions are filled by different\
    \ individuals to help ensure that the\n   resulting documents accurately reflect\
    \ the consensus of the Working\n   Group and that all processes are followed.\n"

    \ and the\n   smooth operation of the Internet.  It is the principal body engaged\n\
    \   in the development of new Internet Standard specifications.\n"
- title: 3.2 IETF Working Groups
  contents:
  - "3.2 IETF Working Groups\n   The technical work of the IETF is done in its Working\
    \ Groups, which\n   are organized by topics into several Areas (e.g., routing,\
    \ network\n   management, security, etc.) under the coordination of Area Directors.\n\
    \   Working Groups typically have a narrow focus and a lifetime bounded\n   by\
    \ completion of a specific task.\n   For all purposes relevant to the Internet\
    \ Standards development\n   process, membership in the IETF and its Working Groups\
    \ is defined to\n   be established solely and entirely by individual participation\
    \ in\n   IETF and Working Group activities. Participation in the IETF and its\n\
    \   Working Groups is by individual technical contributors rather than by\n  \
    \ formal representatives of organizations.\n   Anyone with the time and interest\
    \ to do so is entitled and urged to\n   participate actively in one or more IETF\
    \ Working Groups and to attend\n   IETF meetings which are held three times a\
    \ year.  In most cases\n   active Working Group participation is possible through\
    \ electronic\n   mail alone.  Internet video conferencing is also being used to\
    \ allow\n   for remote participation.\n   To ensure a fair and open process, participants\
    \ in the IETF and its\n   Working Groups must be able to disclose, and must disclose\
    \ to the\n   Working Group chairs any relevant current or pending intellectual\n\
    \   property rights that are reasonably and personally known to the\n   participant\
    \ if they participate in discussions about a specific\n   technology.\n   New\
    \ Working Groups are established within the IETF by explicit\n   charter.  The\
    \ guidelines and procedures for the formation and\n   operation of IETF working\
    \ groups are described in detail in [A].\n   A Working Group is managed by one\
    \ or more Working Group chairs (see\n   section 2.2).  It may also include editors\
    \ of documents that record\n   the group's work (see section 2.3). Further details\
    \ of Working Group\n   operation are contained in [A]\n   IETF Working Groups\
    \ display a spirit of cooperation as well as a high\n   degree of technical maturity;\
    \  IETF participants recognize that the\n   greatest benefit for all members of\
    \ the Internet community results\n   from cooperative development of technically\
    \ superior protocols and\n   services.\n"
- title: 3.3  IETF Secretariat
  contents:
  - "3.3  IETF Secretariat\n   The administrative functions necessary to support the\
    \ activities of\n   the IETF are performed by a Secretariat consisting of the\
    \ IETF\n   Executive Director and his or her staff. The IETF Executive Director\n\
    \   is the formal point of contact for matters concerning any and all\n   aspects\
    \ of the Internet standards process, and is responsible for\n   maintaining the\
    \ formal public record of the Internet standards\n   process [B].\n"
- title: 3.4  Internet Society
  contents:
  - "3.4  Internet Society\n   The Internet Society (ISOC) is an international organization\n\
    \   concerned with the growth and evolution of the worldwide Internet and\n  \
    \ with the social, political, and technical issues that arise from its\n   use.\
    \  The ISOC is an organization with individual and organizational\n   members.\
    \  The ISOC is managed by a Board of Trustees elected by the\n   worldwide individual\
    \ membership.\n   Internet standardization is an organized activity of the ISOC,\
    \ with\n   the Board of Trustees being responsible for ratifying the procedures\n\
    \   and rules of the Internet standards process [B].\n   The way in which the\
    \ members of the ISOC Board of Trustees are\n   selected, and other matters concerning\
    \ the operation of the Internet\n   Society, are described in the ISOC By Laws\
    \ [C].\n"
- title: 3.5 Internet Engineering Steering Group
  contents:
  - "3.5 Internet Engineering Steering Group\n   The Internet Engineering Steering\
    \ Group (IESG) is the part of the\n   Internet Society responsible for the management\
    \ of the IETF technical\n   activities.  It administers the Internet Standards\
    \ process according\n   to the rules and procedures defined in [B].  The IESG\
    \ is responsible\n   for the actions associated with the progression of technical\n\
    \   specification along the \"standards track\" including the initial\n   approval\
    \ of new Working Groups and the final approval of\n   specifications as Internet\
    \ Standards.  The IESG is composed of the\n   IETF Area Directors and the chair\
    \ of the IETF, who also serves as the\n   chair of the IESG.\n   The members of\
    \ the IESG are nominated by a nominations committee (the\n   Nomcom), and are\
    \ approved by the IAB.  See [E] for a detailed\n   description of the Nomcom procedures.\
    \ Other matters concerning its\n   organization and operation, are described in\
    \ the IESG charter [does\n   not yet exist].\n"
- title: 3.6  Internet Architecture Board
  contents:
  - "3.6  Internet Architecture Board\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is\
    \ chartered by the Internet\n   Society Trustees to provide oversight of the architecture\
    \ of the\n   Internet and its protocols.  The IAB appoints the IETF chair and\
    \ is\n   responsible for approving other IESG candidates put forward by the\n\
    \   IETF nominating committee. The IAB is also responsible for reviewing\n   and\
    \ approving the charters of new Working Groups that are proposed\n   for the IETF.\n\
    \   The IAB provides oversight of the process used to create Internet\n   Standards\
    \ and serves as an appeal board for complaints of improper\n   execution of the\
    \ standards process [B]. In general it acts as source\n   of advice to the IETF,\
    \ the ISOC and the ISOC Board of Trustees\n   concerning technical, architectural,\
    \ procedural, and policy matters\n   pertaining to the Internet and its enabling\
    \ technologies.\n   The members of the IAB are nominated by a nominations committee\
    \ (the\n   Nomcom), and are approved by the ISOC board.  See [E] for a detailed\n\
    \   description of the Nomcom procedures.  The membership of the IAB\n   consists\
    \ of members selected by the Nomcom process and the IETF chair\n   sitting as\
    \ a ex-officio member.  Other matters concerning its\n   organization and operation,\
    \ are described in the IAB charter [D].\n"
- title: 3.7  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
  contents:
  - "3.7  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n   Many protocol specifications include\
    \ numbers, keywords, and other\n   parameters that must be uniquely assigned.\
    \  Examples include version\n   numbers, protocol numbers, port numbers, and MIB\
    \ numbers. The\n   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for\n\
    \   assigning the values of these protocol parameters for the Internet.\n   The\
    \ IANA publishes tables of all currently assigned numbers and\n   parameters in\
    \ RFCs entitled \"Assigned Numbers\" [E]. The IANA\n   functions as the \"top\
    \ of the pyramid\" for DNS and Internet Address\n   assignment establishing policies\
    \ for these functions.\n   The functions of the IANA are performed by one or more\
    \ individuals or\n   organizations selected in accordance with the procedures\
    \ defined by\n   the IANA charter [F].\n"
- title: 3.8 Internet Research Task Force
  contents:
  - "3.8 Internet Research Task Force\n   The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)\
    \ is not directly involved in\n   the Internet standards process.  It investigates\
    \ topics considered to\n   be too uncertain, too advanced, or insufficiently well-understood\
    \ to\n   be the subject of Internet standardization.  When an IRTF activity\n\
    \   generates a specification that is sufficiently stable to be\n   considered\
    \ for Internet standardization, the specification is\n   processed through the\
    \ IETF using the rules in this document.\n   The IRTF is composed of individual\
    \ Working Groups, but its structure\n   and mode of operation is much less formal\
    \ than that of the IETF, due\n   in part to the fact that it does not participate\
    \ directly in the\n   Internet standards process.  The organization and program\
    \ of work of\n   the IRTF is overseen by the Internet Research Steering Group\
    \ (IRSG),\n   which consists of the chairs of the IRTF Working Groups.  Details\
    \ of\n   the organization and operation of the IRTF and its Working Groups may\n\
    \   be found in [H].\n"
