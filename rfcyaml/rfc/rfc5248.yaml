  - "1.  Introduction\n   Enhanced Status Codes for SMTP were first defined in [RFC1893],\
    \ which\n   was subsequently replaced by [RFC3463].  While it anticipated that\n\
    \   more codes would be added over time (see section 2 of [RFC3463]), it\n   did\
    \ not provide an explicit mechanism for registering and tracking\n   those codes.\
    \  Since then, various RFCs have been published and\n   internet drafts proposed\
    \ that define additional status codes.\n   However, without an IANA registry,\
    \ conflicts in definitions have\n   begun to appear.\n   This RFC defines such\
    \ an IANA registry and was written to help\n   prevent further conflicts from\
    \ appearing in the future.  It\n   initializes the registry with the established\
    \ standards-track\n   enhanced status codes from [RFC3463], [RFC3886], [RFC4468],\
    \ and\n   [RFC4954].  In addition, this document adds several codes to the\n \
    \  registry that were established by various internet drafts and have\n   come\
    \ into common use, despite the expiration of the documents\n   themselves.\n \
    \  As specified in [RFC3463], an enhanced status code consists of a\n   three-part\
    \ code, with each part being numeric and separated by a\n   period character.\
    \  The three portions are known as the class sub-\n   code, the subject sub-code,\
    \ and the detail sub-code.  In the tables,\n   a wildcard for the class sub-code\
    \ is represented by an X, a wildcard\n   for a subject sub-code is represented\
    \ by an XXX, and a wildcard for a\n   detail sub-code is represented by a YYY.\
    \  For example, 3.XXX.YYY has\n   an unspecified subject sub-code and an unspecified\
    \ status code, and\n   X.5.0 is has an unspecified class sub-code.  (This is a\
    \ change from\n   [RFC3463], which uses XXX for both the subject sub-code and\
    \ detail\n   sub-code wildcards.)\n"

  - "2.1.  SMTP Enhanced Status Codes Registry\n   IANA has created the registry \"\
    SMTP Enhanced Status Codes\".  The SMTP\n   Enhanced Status Codes registry will\
    \ have three tables:\n   o  Class Sub-Codes\n      Each of the entries in this\
    \ table represent class sub-codes and\n      all have an unspecified subject sub-code\
    \ and an unspecified detail\n      sub-code.\n   o  Subject Sub-Codes\n      Each\
    \ of the entries in this table represent subject sub-codes and\n      all have\
    \ an unspecified class sub-code and an unspecified detail\n      sub-code.\n \
    \  o  Enumerated Status Codes\n      Each of the entries in this table represent\
    \ the combination of a\n      subject sub-code and a detail sub-code.  All entries\
    \ will have an\n      unspecified class sub-code, a specified subject sub-code,\
    \ and a\n      specified detail sub-code.\n   Each entry in the tables will include\
    \ the following.  (The sub-code\n   tables will not have the Associated Basic\
    \ Status Code entries.)\n   Code:                         The status code.  For\
    \ example,\n                                 3.XXX.YYY is a class sub-code with\
    \ an\n                                 unspecified subject sub-code and an\n \
    \                                unspecified detail sub-code, and X.5.0\n    \
    \                             is an enumerated status code with an\n         \
    \                        unspecified class sub-code.\n   Summary: or Sample Text:\
    \      For class and subject sub-codes, this\n                               \
    \  is the summary of the use for the sub-\n                                 code\
    \ shown in section 2 of [RFC3463].\n                                 For enumerated\
    \ status codes, this is an\n                                 example of a message\
    \ that might be sent\n                                 along with the code.\n\
    \   Associated Basic Status Code: For enumerated status codes, the basic\n   \

    \                           it is usually associated.  This may\n            \
    \                     also have a value such as \"Any\" or \"Not\n           \

    \                    list.  In particular, the entries that\n                \
    \                 list some basic status codes for an\n                      \
    \           Enhanced Status Code might allow for\n                           \
    \      other basic status codes, while the\n                                 entries\

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Review Process for New Values\n   Entries in this registry are expected\

    \ practice, most entries are\n   expected to derive from standards-track documents.\
    \  Non-standards-\n   track documents that specify codes to be registered should\

    \                       authentication mechanism.  This is primarily\n       \

    \            mechanisms.  A client that receives this may\n                  \
    \     activate a security layer such as TLS prior to\n                       authenticating,\

    \ Text:        User Account Disabled\n   Associated basic status code:  525\n\
    \   Description:        Sometimes a system administrator will have to\n      \
    \                 disable a user's account (e.g., due to lack of\n           \
    \            payment, abuse, evidence of a break-in attempt,\n               \
    \        etc.).  This error code occurs after a successful\n                 \
    \      authentication to a disabled account.  This\n                       informs\
    \ the client that the failure is permanent\n                       until the user\
    \ contacts their system\n                       administrator to get the account\
    \ re-enabled.  It\n                       differs from a generic authentication\
    \ failure\n                       where the client's best option is to present\
    \ the\n                       passphrase entry dialog in case the user simply\n\
    \                       mistyped their passphrase.\n   Reference:          RFC\

    \       Trust relationship required\n   Associated basic status code:  535, 554\n\
    \   Description:        The submission server requires a configured trust\n  \
    \                     relationship with a third-party server in order\n      \
    \                 to access the message content.  This value\n               \

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   As stated in [RFC1893], use of enhanced status\
    \ codes may disclose\n   additional information about how an internal mail system\
    \ is\n   implemented beyond that available through the SMTP status codes.\n  \
    \ Many proposed additions to the response code list are security\n   related.\
    \  Having these registered in one place to prevent collisions\n   will improve\
    \ their value.  Security error responses can leak\n   information to active attackers\
    \ (e.g., the distinction between \"user\n   not found\" and \"bad password\" during\
    \ authentication).  Documents\n   defining security error codes should make it\
    \ clear when this is the\n   case so SMTP server software subject to such threats\
    \ can provide\n   appropriate controls to restrict exposure.\n"
