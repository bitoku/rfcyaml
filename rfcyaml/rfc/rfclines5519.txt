Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) version 1 [RFC1112], version 2 [RFC2236], or version 3 [RFC3376] and the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol version 1
[RFC2710] or version 2 [RFC3810].
Both protocols provide multicast membership discovery capability.
IGMP pertains to IP version 4 clients, and MLD to IP version 6 clients.
This version of the MIB obsoletes both RFC 2933
[RFC2933] and RFC 3019 [RFC3019],
incorporating a generic interface for both IGMP and MLD implementations and incorporating changes to enable "source filtering" in multicast clients.
The MIB encompasses both router and host nodes with relevant management objects defined for each.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This Multicast Group Membership Discovery (MGMD)
MIB module contains eight tables: 1.
the MGMD Host Interface Table, which contains one row for each interface on which IGMP or MLD is enabled on a host, 2.
the MGMD Router Interface Table, which contains one row for each interface on which MGMD is enabled on a router, 3.
the MGMD Host Cache Table, which contains one row for each IP multicast group for which there are members on a particular interface on a host, 4.
the MGMD Router Cache Table, which contains one row for each IP multicast group for which there are members on a particular interface on a router, 5.
the reverse MGMD Host Table, which contains one row for each interface for which there are active multicast groups on a host, 6.
the reverse MGMD Router Table, which contains one row for each interface for which there are active multicast groups on a router, 7.
the MGMD HostSrcList Table, which contains one row for each entry in the source filter record for an interface and multicast group pair on a host, and 8.
the MGMD RouterSrcList Table, which contains one row for each entry in the source filter record for an interface and multicast group pair on a router.
All tables are intended for EITHER router OR host functionality as indicated by the name and corresponding description, although it is anticipated that there will be scenarios where both terms might apply to a device, e.g., a router that joins a multicast group also as a host for measurement purposes.
The source list tables provide an extension to the cache tables to indicate the source specific includes or excludes associated with each IP multicast group on each specific interface.
This functionality is only supported in IGMPv3  and MLDv2 capable nodes.
Incorporated within the MGMD MIB tables are objects for the management of IGMP and MLD proxy devices as described in RFC 4605
Proxy devices can be used in simple topologies where it is not necessary to run a full multicast routing protocol.
A proxy device can make forwarding decisions based on IGMP or MLD group membership activity.
The MIB references InterfaceIndex and InterfaceIndexOrZero objects as defined in RFC 2863
the MIB that describes generic objects for network interface sub layers.
Extensive references to the InetAddress and InetAddressType objects are made as defined in RFC 4001

"The address of the IGMP or MLD Querier on the IP subnet to which this interface is attached.
The InetAddressType, e.g., IPv4 or IPv6, is identified by the mgmdHostInterfaceQuerierType variable in the mgmdHostInterface table."
"The activation of a row enables the host side of IGMP or MLD on the interface.
The destruction of a row disables the host side of IGMP or MLD on the interface."
"The maximum version of MGMD that the host can run on this interface.
A value of 1 is only applicable for IPv4, and indicates that the host only supports IGMPv1 on the interface.
A value of 2 indicates that the host also supports IGMPv2 (for IPv4) or MLDv1 (for IPv6).
A value of 3 indicates that the host also supports IGMPv3 (for IPv4) or MLDv2 (for IPv6).
"The time remaining until the host assumes that there are no IGMPv1 routers present on the interface.
While this is non zero, the host will reply to all queries with version 1 membership reports.
This variable applies to IGMPv2 or 3 hosts that are forced to run in v1 for compatibility with v1 routers present on the interface.
This object may only be present when the corresponding value of mgmdHostInterfaceQuerierType is ipv4."
"The time remaining until the host assumes that there are no MGMDv2 routers present on the interface.
While this is non zero, the host will reply to all queries with version 1 or 2 membership reports.
This variable applies to MGMDv3 hosts that are forced to run in v2 for compatibility with v2 hosts or routers present on the interface."
REFERENCE "RFC 3376, Section 7.2.1 and RFC 3810
"The robustness variable utilised by an MGMDv3 host in sending state change reports for multicast routers.
To ensure the state change report is not missed, the host retransmits the state change report [mgmdHostInterfaceVersion3Robustness 1] times.

The InetAddressType, e.g., IPv4 or IPv6, is identified by the mgmdRouterInterfaceQuerierType variable in the mgmdRouterInterface table."
"The frequency at which IGMP or MLD Host Query packets are transmitted on this interface."
"The activation of a row enables the router side of IGMP or MLD on the interface.
The destruction of a row disables the router side of IGMP or MLD on the interface."
"The version of MGMD that is running on this interface.
Value 1 applies to IGMPv1 routers only.
Value 2 applies to IGMPv2 and MLDv1 routers, and value 3 applies to IGMPv3 and MLDv2 routers.
This object can be used to configure a router capable of running either version.
For IGMP and MLD to function correctly, all routers on a LAN must be configured to run the same version on that LAN."
mgmdRouterInterfaceEntry 6 } mgmdRouterInterfaceQueryMaxResponseTime OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
The maximum query response interval advertised in MGMDv2 or IGMPv3 queries on this interface."
"The time since mgmdRouterInterfaceQuerier was last changed."
"The amount of time remaining before the Other Querier Present Timer expires.
If the local system is the querier, the value of this object is zero."
"The number of general queries received whose IGMP or MLD version does not match the equivalent mgmdRouterInterfaceVersion, over the lifetime of the row entry.
Both IGMP and MLD require that all routers on a LAN be configured to run the same version.
Thus, if any general queries are received with the wrong version, this indicates a configuration error."
"The number of times a group membership has been added on this interface, that is, the number of times an entry for this interface has been added to the Cache Table.
This object can give an indication of the amount of activity between samples over time."
"Some devices implement a form of IGMP or MLD proxying whereby memberships learned on the interface represented by this row cause Host Membership Reports to be sent on the interface whose ifIndex value is given by this object.
Such a device would implement the mgmdV2RouterBaseMIBGroup only on its router interfaces (those interfaces with non zero mgmdRouterInterfaceProxyIfIndex).
Typically, the value of this object is 0, indicating that no proxying is being done."
The Robustness Variable allows tuning for the expected packet loss on a subnet.
If a subnet is expected to be lossy, the Robustness Variable may be increased.
IGMP and MLD are robust to (Robustness Variable 1) packet losses."
mgmdRouterInterfaceEntry 14 } mgmdRouterInterfaceLastMemberQueryInterval OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
The Last Member Query Interval is the Max Query Response Interval inserted into group specific queries sent in response to leave group messages, and is also the amount of time between group specific query messages.
This value may be tuned to modify the leave latency of the network.
A reduced value results in reduced time to detect the loss of the last member of a group.
The value of this object is irrelevant if mgmdRouterInterfaceVersion is 1."
mgmdRouterInterfaceEntry 15 } mgmdRouterInterfaceLastMemberQueryCount OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"Represents the number of group specific and group and  source specific queries sent by the router before it assumes there are no local members."
"Represents the number of Queries sent out on startup, separated by the Startup Query Interval."

"A collection of additional read only objects for management of MGMD version 3 in routers."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The mgmdRouterInterfaceTable provides read create access to 2 values: the mgmdRouterInterfaceStatus and the mgmdRouterInterfaceQueryInterval.
The mgmdRouterInterfaceStatus presents a remote user with the ability to enable or disable multicast support on a given router interface, and therefore presents a significant denial of service vulnerability.
The mgmdRouterInterfaceQueryInterval controls the frequency with which host query packets are sent, providing less of a vulnerability, but still requiring secure access control.
The mgmdRouterCacheTable also provides access to read create objects.
The mgmdRouterInterfaceVersion controls the protocol conformance of an interface, and is therefore a potential denial  of service vulnerability.
The mgmdRouterInterfaceQueryMaxResponseTime, the mgmdRouterInterfaceRobustness, and the mgmdRouterInterfaceLastMemberQueryInterval are all tuning parameters to control the characteristic of the host query packets.
Compromise of these objects can potentially be disruptive to local multicast communication.
The mgmdHostInterfaceTable provides a read create object, the mgmdHostInterfaceVersion3Robustness, which controls the robustness of the interface to packet loss.
Disabling robustness in the face of packet loss could cause denial of service to hosts; however, in general this presents a low risk.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
This MIB introduces a new term to refer to two existing multicast protocols: Multicast Group Membership Discovery.
It encompasses both the IPv4 Multicast discovery protocol, IGMP, and the IPv6 Multicast discovery protocol, MLD, as defined in RFCs 2933
[RFC2933] and 3019 [RFC3019], respectively.
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
{ mib 2 185 } 8.
The authors of RFC 2933
[RFC3019] from which this document is derived are: Keith McCloghrie Dino Farinacci Dave Thaler Brian Haberman Randy Worzella
