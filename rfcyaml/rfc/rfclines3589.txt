Abstract This document describes the IANA's allocation of a block of Diameter Command Codes for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 5.
This document does not pass judgment on the usage of these command codes.
Further more, these command codes are for use for Release 5.
For future releases, these codes cannot be reused, but must be allocated according to the Diameter Base specification.
The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the Internet Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as part of their Release 5 architecture.
As part of this architecture, they have defined a Diameter application [29.229] and [29.329] which requires the use of new Diameter Command Codes [DIAM].
Third Generation Partnership Project IANA
Internet Assigned Name Authority IMS   Internet Multimedia Subsystem 2.
The IANA has allocated Diameter Command Codes 300 through 313, for use in 3GPP Release 5.
The protocols defined by these command codes have not been carefully reviewed by the IETF community and are not considered to be general mechanisms appropriate for broad usage.
More work is needed to develop general mechanisms and may become a work item of an IETF Working Group.
These command codes are intended to be used for 3GPP Release 5 only [29.228], [29.229].
Future 3GPP releases are expected to make use of alternate mechanisms.
Command codes for 3GPP Release 6 are expected to be allocated from the standard command space, with IETF documentation.
The current intent as agreed with 3GPP is to develop a standards track application addressing the needs of AAA for SIP/SDP and encompassing the requirements of the cellular community.
This document is not known to affect the security of the Internet.
