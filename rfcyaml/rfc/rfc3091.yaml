  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a protocol to provide the Pi digit generation\n\
    \   service (PIgen) used between clients and servers on host computers.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This protocol is intended to provide the Pi digit generation\
    \ service\n   (PIgen), and be used between clients and servers on host computers.\n\
    \   Typically the clients are on workstation hosts lacking local Pi\n   support,\
    \ and the servers are more capable machines with greater Pi\n   calculation capabilities.\
    \  The essential tradeoff is the use of\n   network resources and time instead\
    \ of local computational cycles.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: Note
  contents:
  - "Note\n   All digits supplied by implementations of this service are ASCII\n \
    \  [US-ASCII] representations of decimal (base 10) numbers following the\n   decimal\
    \ point in values or approximations of Pi.  There MUST be an\n   implied decimal\
    \ value of 3 (three) preceding the values provided by\n   the service defined\
    \ by this protocol.\n"
- title: 1.     TCP Based Digit Generator Service
  contents:
  - "1.     TCP Based Digit Generator Service\n   One REQUIRED PIgen service is defined\
    \ as a stateless TCP service.  A\n   server listens on TCP port 314159.  Once\
    \ a connection is established\n   the server sends a stream of data, one digit\
    \ of Pi at at time,\n   starting with the most significant digit following the\
    \ decimal point.\n   Any incoming data MUST be discarded.  This continues until\
    \ the client\n   closes the connection.\n   The data flow over the connection\
    \ is limited by the normal TCP flow\n   control mechanisms, so there is no concern\
    \ about the server sending\n   data faster than the client can process it.\n \
    \  Servers MAY use any appropriate method of Pi digit generation to\n   provide\
    \ this service, including (but not limited to) table lookup\n   [DIGITS], numerical\
    \ calculation [FIBPI,PIFFT] and statistical\n   sampling [MCM].  However, the\
    \ method chosen SHOULD provide a precise\n   value for the digits of Pi generated.\n\
    \   Implementors of PIgen MUST provide this service to be conditionally\n   compliant\
    \ with this RFC.\n"
- title: 1.1.   Approximate Service
  contents:
  - "1.1.   Approximate Service\n   An OPTIONAL PIgen service is defined as a stateless\
    \ TCP service.  A\n   server listens on TCP port 220007.  Once a connection is\
    \ established\n   the server sends a stream of data, one digit of the rational\
    \ number\n   22/7 at a time, starting with the most significant digit following\n\
    \   the decimal point.  Any incoming data MUST be discarded.  This\n   continues\
    \ until the client closes the connection.\n"
- title: 2.     UDP Based Digit Generator Service
  contents:
  - "2.     UDP Based Digit Generator Service\n   An OPTIONAL PIgen service is defined\
    \ as a stateless UDP service.  A\n   server listens on UDP port 314159.  When\
    \ a datagram requesting a\n   specific digit of Pi is received, an answering datagram\
    \ is sent\n   containing the value of the requested digit of Pi according to the\n\
    \   format defined in sections 2.1.1. and 2.1.2.\n   The requested digit value\
    \ MAY be determined by any appropriate method\n   of Pi digit generation.  RECOMMENDED\
    \ methods include table lookup\n   [DIGITS], or numerical calculation [BBPPA].\n"
- title: 2.1.   Packet Format
  contents:
  - "2.1.   Packet Format\n   The datagram-based components of the PIgen protocol\
    \ suite all share\n   the following UDP data payload formats (defined in the ABNF\
    \ of RFC\n   2234 [RFC2234]).\n"
- title: 2.1.1. Request Payload Format
  contents:
  - "2.1.1. Request Payload Format\n   request   = nth_digit\n   nth_digit = 1*DIGIT\
    \  ; specifying the n-th digit following the\n                        ; decimal\
    \ point\n"
- title: 2.1.2. Reply Payload Format
  contents:
  - "2.1.2. Reply Payload Format\n   reply  = nth_digit \":\" DIGIT ; where DIGIT\
    \ is the value of the n-th\n                                ; digit following\
    \ the decimal\n                                ; point\n"
- title: 2.2.   Approximate Service
  contents:
  - "2.2.   Approximate Service\n   An OPTIONAL PIgen service is defined as a stateless\
    \ UDP service.  A\n   server listens on UDP port 220007.  When a datagram requesting\
    \ a\n   specific digit of the rational number 22/7 is received, an answering\n\
    \   datagram is sent containing the value of the requested digit of 22/7\n   according\
    \ to the format defined in sections 2.1.1. and 2.1.2.\n"
- title: 3.     IP Multicast Based Digit Generator Service
  contents:
  - "3.     IP Multicast Based Digit Generator Service\n   An OPTIONAL PIgen service\
    \ is defined as a stateless UDP service.  A\n   random distribution of digits\
    \ of Pi are sent using the payload format\n   described in section 2.1.2. to the\
    \ IP multicast group\n   314.159.265.359.\n   There is no request structure. \
    \ If a server implementing this\n   component of the protocol suite joins the\
    \ PIgen multicast group and\n   does not detect a server providing digits within\
    \ 30 seconds, it MAY\n   elect to become the PIgen multicast provider.\n   The\
    \ PIgen multicast provider generates a random distribution of the\n   digits of\
    \ Pi and sends them out to the multicast group.  PIgen\n   multicast clients build\
    \ up a coherent value of Pi by listening to the\n   multicast group over time.\n\
    \   The randomly selected digit value MAY be determined by any\n   appropriate\
    \ method of Pi digit generation.  RECOMMENDED methods\n   include table lookup\
    \ [DIGITS], or numerical calculation [BBPPA].  To\n   ensure an adequately random\
    \ distribution, a proper random number\n   generator should be used, see [RANDOM]\
    \ for some examples.\n"
- title: 4.   Service Discovery
  contents:
  - "4.   Service Discovery\n   Clients SHOULD discover PIgen servers via the DNS\
    \ SRV algorithm\n   [RFC2782].  The service used is \"pigen\" and the protocols\
    \ used are\n   \"tcp\" and \"udp\".  Approximate services (sections 1.1. and 2.2.)\n\
    \   should be discovered using a service of \"pigem\".  This allows for\n   central\
    \ administration of addressing, fallback for failed relays and\n   collectors,\
    \ and static load balancing.\n"
- title: 5.   Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.   Security Considerations\n   As almost every secure Internet protocol requires\
    \ a highly accurate\n   value of Pi in order to function correctly, it is imperative\
    \ that\n   clients only use a trusted PIgen server.  The imminent collapse of\n\
    \   the Internet is assured if this guideline is not strictly followed.\n"
