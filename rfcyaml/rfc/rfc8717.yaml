- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative\n\
    \   structure, and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity\n   (IASA)\
    \ to a new \"IASA 2.0\" structure [RFC8711].  Key IASA 2.0 changes\n   have been\
    \ specified in a series of documents, including changes to\n   the IETF Trust\
    \ [RFC8714], the rationale for it [RFC8715], a new\n   defining document for the\
    \ IETF Administration LLC [LLC-Agreement]\n   (informally called the \"IETF LLC\"\
    \ or just \"the LLC\" in places in this\n   document and elsewhere), and adjustments\
    \ to the procedures for\n   nominations and selections for relevant positions\
    \ [RFC8713].\n   In addition to more substantive changes that are described in\
    \ those\n   and other documents, the IASA 2.0 structure changes several position\n\
    \   titles and organizational relationships that are referenced in other\n   documents.\
    \  Rather than reissue those documents individually, this\n   document provides\
    \ a unified update to them.\n   This document updates RFCs 2028, 2418, 3005, 3710,\
    \ 3929, 4633, and\n   6702 (citations in context below) to make those terminology\
    \ and\n   related changes.  In addition, with the authorization of the IAB, it\n\
    \   requests that the Informational RFC 3716 be made Historic (see\n   Section\
    \ 4).  The sections that follow identify the details of the\n   relevant documents\
    \ and the required changes.\n"
- title: 2.  Where Appropriate, Replacement of the IETF Executive Director
  contents:
  - "2.  Where Appropriate, Replacement of the IETF Executive Director\n    Position\
    \ with the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat\n   Under the IASA 2.0 structure,\
    \ most of the responsibilities of the\n   former position of IETF Executive Director\
    \ have been assigned to a\n   new position (or at least title) of Managing Director,\
    \ IETF\n   Secretariat.  An \"Executive Director\" title is now associated with\n\
    \   different, and largely new, responsibilities as an officer of the\n   IETF\
    \ Administration LLC.  These changes are covered in the\n   description of the\
    \ new structural arrangements [RFC8711].\n   This document applies that change\
    \ to the following:\n   *  RFC 2028, \"The Organizations Involved in the IETF\
    \ Standards\n      Process\", [RFC2028], Section 3.3.\n   *  RFC 2418, \"IETF\
    \ Working Group Guidelines and Procedures\",\n      [RFC2418], Section 1.\n  \
    \ *  RFC 3710, \"An IESG Charter\", [RFC3710], Section 2.\n   *  RFC 3929, \"\
    Alternative Decision Making Processes for Consensus-\n      Blocked Decisions\
    \ in the IETF\", [RFC3929], Sections 4.1.1 and 4.3\n      (twice).\n   *  RFC\
    \ 4633, \"Experiment in Long-Term Suspensions From Internet\n      Engineering\
    \ Task Force (IETF) Mailing Lists\", [RFC4633],\n      Section 1.\n   *  RFC 6702,\
    \ \"Promoting Compliance with Intellectual Property Rights\n      (IPR) Disclosure\
    \ Rules\", [RFC6702], Section 5.\n   Note that the current description of the\
    \ Internet Standards Process\n   [RFC2026] does not require an update by this\
    \ document for this\n   purpose because the reference to the IETF Executive Director\
    \ in RFC\n   2026 was replaced by a document [RFC3979] that precedes the current\n\
    \   effort, and that document was, in turn, obsoleted by RFC 8179\n   [RFC8179].\n"
- title: 3.  Removal of the IETF Executive Director as an Option
  contents:
  - "3.  Removal of the IETF Executive Director as an Option\n   In a few cases, it\
    \ is no longer appropriate for either the Managing\n   Director, IETF Secretariat\
    \ (former IETF Executive Director position)\n   or the new IETF Executive Director\
    \ (for the LLC) to perform a\n   particular historical function.  The relevant\
    \ documents are updated\n   to remove the IETF Executive Director from the list\
    \ of people with\n   specific responsibilities or authority.  Those documents\
    \ will not be\n   updated to use \"Managing Director, IETF Secretariat\" but,\
    \ instead,\n   the mention of the position will simply be dropped.\n   This document\
    \ applies that change to the following:\n   *  RFC 3005, \"IETF Discussion List\
    \ Charter\" [RFC3005], section titled\n      \"Charter for the IETF Discussion\
    \ List\".  This document is modified\n      to remove the authorization for the\
    \ IETF Executive Director to\n      restrict people from posting, etc.\n"
