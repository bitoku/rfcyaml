    \   and proposes a CPP template to capture IP/MPLS connectivity\n   requirements\
    \ to be met within a service delivery context (e.g., Voice\n   over IP or IP TV).\
    \  The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters\n   to be supported by the\

    \   global and restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.\n  \
    \ Such a generic CPP template is meant to (1) facilitate the automation\n   of\
    \ the service negotiation and activation procedures, thus\n   accelerating service\
    \ provisioning, (2) set (traffic) objectives of\n   Traffic Engineering functions\

    \   addresses, \"Destination Nets\" is a group of IP unicast and/or\n   multicast\
    \ addresses, and \"Guarantees\" reflects the guarantees\n   (expressed in terms\
    \ of Quality Of Service (QoS), performance, and\n   availability, for example)\
    \ to properly forward traffic to the said\n   \"Destination\".  Finally, the \"\

- title: 1.2.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Rationale\n   Procedures for the design and the operation of IP services\
    \ have\n   become increasingly diverse and complex.  The time it takes to\n  \
    \ negotiate service parameters and then proceed with the corresponding\n   resource\
    \ allocation can thus be measured in days, if not weeks.  Yet,\n   experience\
    \ has shown that the bilateral discussions that usually take\n   place between\
    \ a Customer and a Network Provider never rely upon some\n   kind of standard\
    \ checklist where the Customer would be invited to\n   tick all the parameters\
    \ that apply to its environment.  These\n   parameters would then be negotiated\
    \ with the Network Provider, as a\n   function of the available resources, the\
    \ Customer's expectations, the\n   provider's network planning policy, etc.\n\
    \   The definition of a clear interface between the service (including\n   third-party\
    \ applications) and the network layers would therefore\n   facilitate the said\
    \ discussion, thereby improving the overall service\n   delivery procedure by\
    \ optimizing the design of the network\n   infrastructures.  Indeed, the CPP interface\
    \ aims at exposing and\n   characterizing, in a technology-agnostic manner, the\
    \ IP transfer\n   requirements to be met when invoking IP transfer capabilities\
    \ of a\n   network operated by a Network Provider between a set of Customer\n\
    \   Nodes (e.g., Multimedia Gateway (Section 11.2.7 of [RFC2805]),\n   Session\
    \ Border Controller [RFC5853], etc.).\n   These requirements include: reachability\
    \ scope (e.g., limited scope,\n   Internet-wide), direction, bandwidth requirements,\
    \ QoS parameters\n   (e.g., one-way delay [RFC2679], loss [RFC2680], or one-way\
    \ delay\n   variation [RFC3393]), protection, and high-availability guidelines\n\
    \   (e.g., restoration in less than 50 ms, 100 ms, or 1 second).\n   These requirements\
    \ are then translated into IP/MPLS-related technical\n   clauses (e.g., need for\
    \ recovery means, definition of the class of\n   service, need for control-plane\
    \ protection, etc.).  In a later stage,\n   these various clauses will be addressed\
    \ by the activation of adequate\n   network features and technology-specific actions\
    \ (e.g., Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE, [RFC3346]),\
    \ Resource\n   Reservation Protocol (RSVP, [RFC2205]), Open Shortest Path First\n\
    \   (OSPF), Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS), etc.), by\n  \
    \ means of CPP-derived configuration information.\n   For traffic conformance\
    \ purposes, a CPP also includes flow\n   identification and classification rules\
    \ to be followed by\n   participating nodes whenever they have to process traffic\
    \ according\n   to a specific service as defined by the said CPP.\n   The CPP\
    \ template aims to capture connectivity needs and to represent\n   and value these\
    \ requirements in a standardized manner.  Service- and\n   Customer-specific IP\
    \ provisioning rules may lead to a dramatic\n   increase of the number of IP transfer\
    \ classes that need to be\n   (pre-)engineered in the network.  Instantiating\
    \ each CPP into a\n   distinct class of service should therefore be avoided for\
    \ the sake of\n   performance and scalability.\n   Therefore, application-agnostic\
    \ IP provisioning practices should be\n   recommended, since the requirements\
    \ captured in the CPP can be used\n   to identify which network class of service\
    \ is to be used to meet\n   those requirements/guarantees.  From that standpoint,\
    \ the CPP concept\n   is meant to design a limited number of generic classes so\
    \ that\n   individual CPP documents, by capturing the connectivity requirements\n\
    \   of services, applications, and Customers, can be easily mapped to\n   these\
    \ classes.\n   CPP may also be used as a guideline for network dimensioning and\n\
    \   planning teams of a Network Provider to ensure that appropriate\n   resources\
    \ (e.g., network cards, routers, link capacity, etc.) have\n   been provisioned.\
    \  Otherwise, (underlying) transport networks would\n   not be able to meet the\
    \ objectives expressed in all CPP requests.\n   Such a generic CPP template:\n\
    \   o  Facilitates the automation of the service negotiation and\n      activation\
    \ procedures, thus improving service delivery times;\n   o  Can help set Traffic\
    \ Engineering function and service management\n      function objectives, for\
    \ example, as a function of the number of\n      CPP templates to be processed\
    \ over a specific period of time; and\n   o  Improves service and network management\
    \ systems by adding\n      'decision-making' capabilities based upon negotiated/offered\
    \ CPPs.\n   In addition, this CPP abstraction makes a clear distinction between\n\
    \   the connectivity provisioning requirements and the associated\n   technology-specific\
    \ rules that need to be applied by participating\n   nodes and that are meant\
    \ to accommodate such requirements.\n   The CPP defines the set of IP/MPLS transfer\
    \ guarantees to be offered\n   by the underlying transport network together with\
    \ a reachability\n   scope and capacity needs.  Appropriate performance metrics,\
    \ such as\n   one-way delay or one-way delay variation, are used to characterize\n\
    \   the IP transfer service.  Guarantees related to availability and\n   resiliency\
    \ are also included in the CPP.\n   The CPP can be used in an integrated business\
    \ environment (where the\n   service and network infrastructures are managed by\
    \ the same\n   administrative entity) or another business environment (where an\n\
    \   administrative entity manages the service while another manages the\n   network\
    \ infrastructure).  In the following sections, no assumption is\n   made about\
    \ the business environment (integrated or not).\n   Service differentiation at\
    \ the network layer can be enforced by\n   tweaking various parameters that belong\
    \ to distinct dimensions (e.g.,\n   forwarding, routing, processing of incoming\
    \ traffic, traffic\n   classification, etc.).  This document does not make any\
    \ assumption on\n   how network services are implemented within a networking\n\
    \   infrastructure.\n   Activating unicast or multicast capabilities to deliver\
    \ a\n   connectivity service can be explicitly requested by a Customer in a\n\
    \   CPP or can be an engineering decision of a Network Provider based on\n   the\
    \ analysis of the Customer connectivity provisioning requirements.\n   Examples\
    \ of CPP usage include the northbound interface introduced by\n   the Application-Based\
    \ Network Operations (ABNO) framework [NET-OPS]\n   and the technique for exposing\
    \ network services and their\n   characteristics defined in [RFC7149].\n"

  - "3.1.  Customer Nodes Map\n   A CPP must include the list of Customer Nodes (e.g.,\
    \ Customer Edges\n   (CEs)) to be connected to the underlying IP transport network.\n\
    \   These nodes should be unambiguously identified (e.g., using a unique\n   Service_identifier,\
    \ Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, etc.).  For\n   each Customer Node, a\
    \ border link or a node that belongs to the\n   domain that connects the Customer\
    \ Nodes should be identified.\n   This clause can specify geolocation information\
    \ of Customer Nodes.\n   Based on the location of the Customer Node, appropriate\
    \ operations to\n   retrieve the corresponding border link or \"Provider Node\"\
    \ (e.g., PE)\n   should be undertaken.  This operation can be manual or automated.\n\
    \   A \"service site\" would be located behind a given Customer Node.  A\n   site\
    \ identifier may be captured in the CPP for the provisioning of\n   managed VPN\
    \ services [RFC4026], for instance, Site_identifier.\n   A Customer Node may be\
    \ connected to several Provider Nodes.  Multiple\n   Customer Nodes may be connected\
    \ to the same Provider Node as shown in\n   Figure 4.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Scope\n   The scope clause specifies the reachability of each of the involved\n\
    \   Customer Nodes, from both incoming and outgoing traffic perspectives,\n  \
    \ thereby yielding specific traffic directionality considerations.  It\n   is\
    \ defined as an unidirectional parameter.  Both directions should be\n   described\
    \ in the CPP.\n   The reachability scope specifies the set of destination prefixes\
    \ that\n   can be reached from a given Customer site (identified by a group of\n\
    \   source prefixes).  Both global and restricted reachability scopes can\n  \
    \ be captured in the CPP.  A global reachability scope means that a\n   Customer\
    \ site can reach any destination in the Internet and can be\n   reached from any\
    \ remote host.  A restricted reachability scope means\n   no global reachability\
    \ is allowed; only a set of destinations can be\n   reached from a Customer site,\
    \ and/or only a set of sources can reach\n   the Customer site.  Both incoming\
    \ and outgoing reachability scopes\n   are specified in the CPP.\n   Both IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 reachability scopes may be specified.\n   The reachability scope clause\
    \ can include multicast and/or unicast\n   addresses.  For SSM, a group of unicast\
    \ source addresses can be\n   specified in addition to destination multicast addresses.\n\
    \   The scope clause can also be used to delimit a topological (or\n   geographical)\
    \ network portion beyond which the performance and\n   availability guarantees\
    \ do not apply.  A scope may be defined by a\n   set of \"Ingress\" points and\
    \ \"Egress\" points.  Several types may be\n   considered, such as:\n   (1) \"\
    1:1\" Pipe model.  Only point-to-point communications are\n       allowed.\n \
    \  (2) \"1:N\" Hose model.  Only communications from one site towards a\n    \
    \   set of destinations are allowed.\n   (3) \"1:any\" Unspecified hose model.\
    \  All outbound communications are\n       allowed.\n   The Ingress and Egress\
    \ points could be Customer Nodes / Provider\n   Nodes or external nodes, provided\
    \ that these nodes are unambiguously\n   identified (e.g., IPv6 prefix), or a\
    \ set of IP destinations.\n"
- title: 3.3.  QoS Guarantees
  contents:
  - "3.3.  QoS Guarantees\n   QoS guarantees denote a set of IP transfer performance\
    \ metrics that\n   characterize the quality of the IP transfer treatment to be\n\
    \   experienced (when crossing an IP transport infrastructure) by a flow\n   issued\
    \ from or forwarded to a (set of) \"Customer Node(s)\".\n   IP performance metrics\
    \ can be expressed as qualitative or\n   quantitative parameters (both quantitative\
    \ and qualitative guarantees\n   cannot be specified in the same CPP).  Quantitative\
    \ guarantees may be\n   specified as an average value, as a maximum bound, or\
    \ as a percentile\n   over an interval of measurements that should be indicated\
    \ in the\n   measurement method.\n   Several performance metrics have been defined,\
    \ such as:\n   o  Traffic Loss [RFC2680]\n   o  One-way delay [RFC2679]\n   o\
    \  One-way delay variation [RFC3393]\n   These parameters may be specific to a\
    \ given path or a given scope\n   (e.g., between two Customer Nodes).  IP performance\
    \ metric values\n   indicated in a CPP should reflect the measurement between\
    \ a set of\n   Customer Nodes or between a Customer Node and a set of Provider\n\
    \   Nodes.\n   Quantitative guarantees can only be specified for in-profile traffic\n\
    \   (i.e., up to a certain traffic rate).  A CPP can include throughput\n   guarantees;\
    \ when specified, these guarantees are equivalent to\n   quantitative or qualitative\
    \ loss guarantees.\n   The Meta-QoS-Class concept can be used when qualitative\
    \ metrics are\n   used [RFC5160].\n"
- title: 3.4.  Availability
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Availability\n   This clause specifies the percentage of the time during\
    \ which the\n   agreed IP performance guarantees apply.  The clause can be expressed\n\
    \   as a maximum or an average.  The exact meaning of the clause value is\n  \
    \ defined during the CPP negotiation process.\n   The guarantees cover both QoS\
    \ deterioration (i.e., IP transfer\n   service is available, but it is below the\
    \ agreed performance bounds),\n   physical failures, or service unavailability\
    \ in general.  In order to\n   meet the availability guarantees, several engineering\
    \ practices may\n   be enforced at the border between the Customer and the Network\n\
    \   Provider, such as multi-homing designs.\n   The following mechanisms are provided\
    \ as examples to show that\n   different technical options may be chosen to meet\
    \ the service\n   availability objectives:\n   o  When an Interior Gateway Protocol\
    \ (IGP) instance is running\n      between the \"Customer Node\" and the \"Provider\
    \ Node\", activate a\n      dedicated protocol, such as Bidirectional Forwarding\
    \ Detection\n      (BFD, [RFC5881][RFC5883]), to control IGP availability and\
    \ to\n      ensure sub-second IGP adjacency failure detection.\n   o  Use of the\
    \ Label Switched Path Ping (LSP Ping) capability to\n      detect LSP availability\
    \ (check whether the LSP is in place or not)\n      [RFC4379][RFC6424][RFC6425][RFC6426][RFC6829].\n\
    \   o  Pre-install backup LSPs for fast-reroute purposes when an MPLS\n      network\
    \ connects Customer Nodes [RFC4090].\n   o  Enable Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol\
    \ (VRRP, [RFC5798]).\n   o  Enable IP Fast Reroute features (e.g., [RFC5286] or\
    \ [RFC6981]).\n"
- title: 3.5.  Capacity
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Capacity\n   This clause characterizes the required capacity to be provided\
    \ by the\n   underlying IP transport network.  This capacity is bound to a defined\n\
    \   \"Scope\" (see Section 3.2) and IP transfer performance guarantees (see\n\
    \   Sections 3.3 and 3.4).\n   The capacity may be expressed for both traffic\
    \ directions (i.e.,\n   incoming and outgoing) and for every border link.  The\
    \ capacity\n   clause defines the limits of the application of quantitative\n\
    \   guarantees.\n   It is up to the administrative entity, which manages the IP\
    \ transport\n   network, to appropriately dimension its network [RFC5136] to meet\
    \ the\n   capacity requirements expressed in all negotiated CPPs.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Conformance Traffic
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Conformance Traffic\n   When capacity information (see Section 3.5) is\
    \ included in the CPP,\n   requirements for out-of-profile traffic treatment need\
    \ to be also\n   expressed in the CPP.\n   Shaping/policing filters may be applied\
    \ so as to assess whether\n   traffic is within the capacity profile or out of\
    \ profile.  Out-of-\n   profile traffic may be discarded or assigned another class\
    \ (e.g.,\n   using Lower Effort Per-Domain Behavior (LE PDB) [RFC3662]).\n   Packet\
    \ MTU conditions may also be indicated in the CPP.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Overall Traffic Guarantees
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Overall Traffic Guarantees\n   Overall traffic guarantees are defined when\
    \ the Capacity\n   (Section 3.5) and Conformance Traffic (Section 3.6) clauses\
    \ are not\n   specified.  Or, if they are actually specified, then out-of-profile\n\
    \   traffic is assigned another class of service but is not discarded.\n   Such\
    \ guarantees can only be qualitative delay and/or qualitative loss\n   or throughput\
    \ guarantees.\n   If overall traffic guarantees are not specified, best effort\n\
    \   forwarding is implied.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Traffic Isolation
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Traffic Isolation\n   This clause indicates if the traffic issued by or\
    \ destined to\n   \"Customer Nodes\" should be isolated when crossing the IP transport\n\
    \   network.  This clause can also be used to specify additional security\n  \
    \ protection requirements (including privacy protection requirements).\n   This\
    \ clause can then be translated into VPN policy provisioning\n   information,\
    \ such as the information pertaining to the activation of\n   dedicated tunnels\
    \ using IPsec, BGP/MPLS VPN facilities [RFC4364], or\n   a combination thereof.\
    \  The activation of such features should be\n   consistent with the availability\
    \ and performance guarantees that have\n   been negotiated.\n"
- title: 3.9.  Flow Identification
  contents:
  - "3.9.  Flow Identification\n   To identify the flows that need to be handled within\
    \ the context of a\n   given CPP, flow identifiers should be indicated in the\
    \ CPP.  Flow\n   identifiers are used for traffic classification purposes.  An\
    \ example\n   of packet classifier is defined in [RFC2475].\n   A flow identifier\
    \ may be composed of (but not limited to) the\n   following parameters:\n   o\
    \  Source IP address,\n   o  Source port number,\n   o  Destination IP address,\n\
    \   o  Destination port number,\n   o  Type of Service (ToS) or Differentiated\
    \ Services Code Point (DSCP)\n      field,\n   o  Tail-end tunnel endpoint, or\n\
    \   o  Any combination thereof.\n   Distinct treatments may be implemented for\
    \ elastic and non-elastic\n   traffic (e.g., see the \"Constraints on traffic\"\
    \ clause defined in\n   [RFC5160]).\n   Flow classification rules may be specific\
    \ to a given link or may be\n   applied for a group or all border links.  This\
    \ should be clearly\n   captured in the CPP.\n   Some practices such as DSCP re-marking\
    \ may be indicated in the CPP.\n   Re-marking action is under the responsibility\
    \ of underlying nodes\n   that intervene to deliver the connectivity service.\
    \  Re-marking can\n   be enforced for both outgoing and incoming traffic received\
    \ from or\n   destined to Customer Nodes.  These re-marking actions must not alter\n\
    \   the service-specific marking integrity (e.g., VPN service).\n   This clause\
    \ may specify policies (e.g., DSCP re-marking) to be\n   enforced at the egress\
    \ nodes on packets received from Customer Nodes.\n   If no such policy is specified,\
    \ the Network Provider enforces its\n   local policies (e.g., clear DSCP marking)\
    \ on packets leaving its\n   administrative domain.\n"
- title: 3.10.  Routing and Forwarding
  contents:
  - "3.10.  Routing and Forwarding\n   This clause is used to specify outsourced routing\
    \ actions, such as\n   installing dedicated routes to convey the traffic to its\
    \ (service)\n   destination.  These dedicated routes may be computed, selected,\
    \ and\n   installed for Traffic Engineering or resilience purposes.  For\n   Traffic\
    \ Engineering, these paths can be used to intelligently divert\n   traffic away\
    \ from some nodes/links that may potentially suffer from\n   congestion or avoid\
    \ crossing competitors' networks.  For resilience,\n   backup paths are typically\
    \ pre-installed in order to bypass nodes/\n   links under protection.\n   This\
    \ clause is also used to specify intermediate functions that must\n   be invoked\
    \ in the forwarding path (e.g., redirect the traffic to a\n   firewall, invoke\
    \ topology hiding features, etc.) or specify\n   geographic routing restrictions.\n\
    \   A requirement for setting up a logical routing topology [RFC4915]\n   [RFC5120]\
    \ may also be considered, e.g., to facilitate the management\n   of the nodes\
    \ that are involved in the forwarding of the traffic as\n   defined in the CPP.\n\
    \   This practice should be indicated in the CPP; otherwise, path\n   computation\
    \ is left to the underlying IP routing capabilities.  The\n   forwarding behavior\
    \ (e.g., Per-Domain Behavior (PDB) [RFC3086]) may\n   also be specified in a CPP\
    \ but remains optional.  If indicated,\n   consistency with the IP performance\
    \ bounds defined in the CPP should\n   be carefully ensured.\n   For illustration\
    \ purposes, a routing policy would avoid satellite\n   links for Voice over IP\
    \ (VoIP) deployments since this may degrade the\n   offered service.\n"
- title: 3.11.  Activation Means
  contents:
  - "3.11.  Activation Means\n   This clause indicates the required action(s) to be\
    \ undertaken to\n   activate access to the IP connectivity service.\n   Examples\
    \ of these actions would be the activation of an IGP instance,\n   the establishment\
    \ of a BGP [RFC4271] or Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)\n   session [RFC4760], Protocol\
    \ Independent Multicast (PIM, [RFC4601]),\n   etc.\n"
- title: 3.12.  Invocation Means
  contents:
  - "3.12.  Invocation Means\n   Two types are defined:\n   Implicit:  This clause\
    \ indicates that no explicit means to invoke the\n      connectivity service is\
    \ required.  Access to the connectivity\n      service is primarily conditioned\
    \ by the requested network\n      capacity.\n   Explicit:  This clause indicates\
    \ the need for explicit means to\n      access the connectivity service.  Examples\
    \ of such means include\n      the use of RSVP [RFC2205], RSVP-TE [RFC3209], Internet\
    \ Group\n      Management Protocol (IGMP, [RFC3376]), or Multicast Listener\n\
    \      Discovery (MLD, [RFC3810]).  Appropriate admission control\n      procedures\
