- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This RFC is a commentary on the difficulty of deciding upon\
    \ an\n   acceptably distinctive hostname for one's computer, a problem which\n\
    \   grows in direct proportion to the logarithmically increasing size of\n   the\
    \ Internet.\n   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n   Except to TS Eliot.\n\
    \   And, for that matter, to David Addison, who hates iambic pentameter.\n"

  - "Poetry\n    The Naming of Hosts is a difficult matter,\n        It isn't just\
    \ one of your holiday games;\n    You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter\n\
    \        When I tell you, a host must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.\n    First of\
    \ all, there's the name that the users use daily,\n        Such as venus, athena,\
    \ and cisco, and ames,\n    Such as titan or sirius, hobbes or europa--\n    \
    \    All of them sensible everyday names.\n    There are fancier names if you\
    \ think they sound sweeter,\n        Some for the web pages, some for the flames:\n\
    \    Such as mercury, phoenix, orion, and charon--\n        But all of them sensible\
    \ everyday names.\n    But I tell you, a host needs a name that's particular,\n\
    \        A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,\n    Else how can it keep\
    \ its home page perpendicular,\n        And spread out its data, send pages world\
    \ wide?\n    Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,\n        Like lothlorien,\
    \ pothole, or kobyashi-maru,\n    Such as pearly-gates.vatican, or else diplomatic-\n\
    \        Names that never belong to more than one host.\n    But above and beyond\
    \ there's still one name left over,\n        And that is the name that you never\
    \ will guess;\n    The name that no human research can discover--\n        But\
    \ THE NAMESERVER KNOWS, and will us'ually confess.\n    When you notice a client\
    \ in rapt meditation,\n        The reason, I tell you, is always the same:\n \
    \   The code is engaged in a deep consultation\n        On the address, the address,\
    \ the address of its name:\n                It's ineffable,\n                effable,\n\
    \                Effanineffable,\n                Deep and inscrutable,\n    \
    \            singular\n                Name.\n"
