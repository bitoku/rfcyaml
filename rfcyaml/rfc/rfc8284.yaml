- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120]\n\
    \   identifies users by use of Jabber IDs (JIDs).  The Lightweight\n   Directory\
    \ Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC4510] enables provision of a\n   white pages service\
    \ with a schema relating to users and support for\n   Internet protocols defined\
    \ in [RFC4519].  This specification defines\n   a schema to enable XMPP JIDs to\
    \ be associated with LDAP directory\n   objects so that this information can be\
    \ used with white pages\n   applications.\n   The LDAP schema for storing JIDs\
    \ is defined to enable JIDs to be\n   associated with any object stored in the\
    \ directory.  This is done by\n   associating the new JID Attribute with a new\
    \ Auxiliary Object Class\n   called JIDObject.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Schema Definition\n   This section defines the schema used to store JIDs\
    \ in the directory.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Object Class
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Object Class\n   This section defines a new Auxiliary Object Class called\
    \ JIDObject,\n   which MAY be associated with any structural Object Class.  This\n\
    \   Object Class is used to augment entries for objects that act or may\n   act\
    \ as an XMPP client.  The JID attribute is optional in order to\n   enable configuring\
    \ an object that is allowed to have an associated\n   JID but does not currently\
    \ have one.\n        ( 1.3.6.1.1.23.1 NAME 'JIDObject'\n        AUXILIARY\n  \
    \      MAY jid )\n"
- title: 3.2.  Attribute
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Attribute\n   This section defines the JID attribute referenced by the\
    \ JIDObject\n   Auxiliary Object Class.  The syntax of the JID attribute MUST\
    \ follow\n   the rules of [RFC7622].  The JID stored MUST be a bare JID (e.g.,\
    \ a\n   JID such as romeo@shakespeare.example.com representing a human user)\n\
    \   and not a full JID (e.g., a JID such as\n   romeo@shakespare.example.com/AABBCC,\
    \ which represents a specific XMPP\n   client used by the human user and is identified\
    \ by the resource\n   AABBCC).  Note that the LDAP directory server is not expected\
    \ to\n   enforce this syntax.  The syntax rules are for LDAP clients setting\n\
    \   this attribute, noting that human usage is a key target.\n   Applications\
    \ using this attribute should format that string in a\n   manner appropriate to\
    \ the application, and XMPP applications SHOULD\n   apply [RFC7622] to the attribute.\
    \  The directory service doesn't\n   enforce the JID syntax, and values are compared\
    \ according to the\n   matching rules specified in the attribute definition.\n\
    \   Note that for the convenience of users and administrators as well as\n   implementers,\
    \ the Directory String syntax and the caseIgnoreMatch\n   matching rule are chosen\
    \ to allow entry and matching of values\n   according to common rules used within\
    \ the directory.  As this syntax\n   and matching rule differ from [RFC7622],\
    \ false positives and false\n   negatives can possibly occur.  This is not anticipated\
    \ to cause\n   operational issues (based on implementation experience with similar\n\
    \   syntax/matching rule mismatches).\n         ( 1.3.6.1.1.23.2 NAME 'jid'\n\
    \            EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch\n            SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch\n\
    \            SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )\n   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15\
    \ refers to the Directory String syntax\n   defined in [RFC4517].\n"

    \ which may be corporate or public services.  Care should\n   be taken to only\
