- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Ed25519 [Ed25519] signature algorithm, specifically\n\
    \   Ed25519-SHA-512, has been implemented in OpenSSH.  RFC 4255 [RFC4255]\n  \
    \ defines a DNS resource record, \"SSHFP\", which can be used to publish\n   a\
    \ fingerprint of the SSH server public key in the DNS.  This document\n   updates\
    \ the IANA \"SSHFP RR Types for public key algorithms\" registry\n   by adding\
    \ an algorithm number for Ed25519 [Ed25519].\n"
- title: 2.  Ed25519 Public Key with SHA-256 Fingerprint
  contents:
  - "2.  Ed25519 Public Key with SHA-256 Fingerprint\n   The encoding of Ed25519 public\
    \ keys is described in [Ed25519].  In\n   brief, an Ed25519 public key is a 32-octet\
    \ value representing a\n   255-bit y-coordinate of an elliptic curve point, and\
    \ a sign bit\n   indicating the corresponding x-coordinate.\n   The SSHFP Resource\
    \ Record for the Ed25519 public key with SHA-256\n   fingerprint [FIPS180-4] would,\
    \ for example, be:\n      ssh.example.com IN SSHFP 4 2 ( a87f1b687ac0e57d2a081a2f2826723\n\
    \                                     34d90ed316d2b818ca9580ea384d924\n      \
    \                               01 )\n   The following body of the public key\
    \ file was used as input to\n   generate the above fingerprint:\n    ssh-ed25519\n\
    \    AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGPKSUTyz1HwHReFVvD5obVsALAgJRNarH4TRpNePnAS\n  \
    \ The opaque octet string output produced is placed as is in the RDATA\n   fingerprint\
    \ field.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The overall security of using SSHFP for SSH host\
    \ key verification is\n   dependent on the security policies of the SSH host administrator\
    \ and\n   DNS zone administrator (in transferring the fingerprint), detailed\n\
    \   aspects of how verification is done in the SSH implementation, and in\n  \
    \ the client's diligence in accessing the DNS in a secure manner.\n   Please refer\
    \ to RFC 4255 [RFC4255] for a discussion of the security\n   considerations.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has added the following entry to the \"SSHFP\
    \ RR Types for public\n   key algorithms\" registry:\n      +--------+-------------+------------+\n\
