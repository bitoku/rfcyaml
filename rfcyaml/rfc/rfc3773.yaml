- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Until recently, voice mail and call answering services were\n\
    \   implemented as stand-alone proprietary systems.  Today, standards\n   such\
    \ as the Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) enable\n   interoperability between\
    \ such systems over the Internet.  VPIM\n   version 1 [VPIM1] was experimental\
    \ and was a first attempt at a Voice\n   Profile for Internet Mail, but is now\
    \ classified as Historical.  VPIM\n   Version 2 [VPIM2] is an improvement on VPIM\
    \ version 1 that was\n   originally intended to provide interoperability between\
    \ voice\n   messaging systems only.  It describes a messaging profile that\n \
    \  standardizes the exchange of voice mail over an IP messaging network\n   using\
    \ SMTP [DRUMSMTP] and MIME [MIME1].\n   Because the number of desktop boxes is\
    \ growing rapidly and will soon\n   approach the number of desktop telephones,\
    \ it is essential to\n   consider the requirements of desktop email client applications\n\
    \   (including, but not limited to, MIME-compliant email clients).  With\n   the\
    \ trend toward integration of voice mail and email through unified\n   messaging\
    \ (UM), it is now necessary to define a profile that supports\n   the needs of\
    \ desktop applications and unified messaging systems\n   (including Internet Facsimile\
    \ [EXFAX]).  This profile is being\n   referred to as Internet Voice Mail (IVM).\n\
    \   This document defines the goals for Internet Voice Mail.  This\n   standard\
    \ will support the interchange of voice messages between voice\n   mail systems,\
    \ unified messaging systems, email servers, and desktop\n   client applications.\
    \  The desktop client application is of particular\n   and important interest\
    \ to IVM.  This document will also expand the\n   offerings of service providers\
    \ by facilitating access to voice mail\n   from a web client.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Interoperability
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Interoperability\n   Enhanced interoperability is the primary goal of IVM.\
    \  The profile\n   MUST facilitate interoperability between voice mail systems,\
    \ unified\n   messaging systems, Internet email servers, and desktop client\n\
    \   applications.  Such interoperability MUST support systems which\n   combine\
    \ multiple media types in a single message, as well as legacy\n   voice mail and\
    \ email systems.  It MUST allow the ability to\n   accommodate varying capabilities\
    \ of the voice mail, unified\n   messaging, and email systems.  Furthermore, IVM\
    \ MUST be compatible\n   with Internet Fax (extended mode) proposed standards\
    \ and VPIM\n   messages that contain fax body parts.\n   To have \"interoperability\"\
    \ means that an IVM compliant sender\n   attempting to send to a recipient will\
    \ not fail because of\n   incompatibility.  IVM MUST support interoperability\
    \ amongst the\n   systems listed below:\n      - Desktop Email client applications\n\
    \      - IVM-capable Voice Mail systems\n      - IVM-capable unified messaging\
    \ systems\n      - Traditional email servers\n   IVM SHOULD also support interoperability\
    \ with VPIM version 2 Voice\n   Mail Systems.\n   IVM MUST include new functionality\
    \ to facilitate access to voice mail\n   messages from desktop applications.\n\
    \   Overall interoperability requires interoperability for all message\n   elements:\
    \ body parts deemed essential for message validity MUST be\n   preserved, essential\
    \ information MUST be provided in a form that is\n   accessible by the users,\
    \ status codes [CODES] MUST be understood, and\n   operations that are standard\
    \ for each system SHOULD be supported.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Interoperability with Desktop Email Client Applications
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Interoperability with Desktop Email Client Applications\n   Desktop email\
    \ applications are typically text based.  The abilities\n   to listen to, reply\
    \ to, forward, and generate voice mail messages\n   from a traditional desktop\
    \ environment are relatively new\n   developments.  To accommodate current use\
    \ and future developments in\n   this area, IVM MUST provide features to support\
    \ access to voice mail\n   messages from the desktop and other email-reading devices.\
    \  Also, web\n   access to voicemail SHOULD be supported from the desktop.\n \
    \  IVM SHOULD NOT require desktop email applications to possess a large\n   amount\
    \ of processing power, and a base level implementation MUST\n   interoperate,\
    \ even if it does not offer complex processing.  In order\n   to support interoperability,\
    \ at least one mandatory codec MUST be\n   defined.  The mandatory codec(s) SHOULD\
    \ be widely available on\n   desktops.  For interoperability with VPIM version\
    \ 2 systems, IVM\n   applications MAY also support the VPIM v2 mandatory codec,\
    \ 32KADPCM\n   [ADPCM and G726-32].\n   Any codecs included in the IVM specification\
    \ SHOULD meet the\n   following criteria:\n      -  Availability on desktops:\
    \ Codecs SHOULD be available on most\n         platforms.\n      -  Source code\
    \ availability: Source code SHOULD be readily\n         accessible.\n      - \
    \ Decoding complexity: All codecs MUST be low complexity to\n         decode.\n\
    \      -  Encoding complexity: Some of the codecs MUST be low complexity\n   \
    \      to encode.\n      -  Bit rate: IVM SHOULD specify a codec with low bit\
    \ rate for\n         devices (i.e., wireless) that do not have much space/bandwidth.\n\
    \      -  Voice Over IP support: IVM SHOULD specify a codec that supports\n  \
    \       Voice over IP implementations.\n   Voice Content MUST always be contained\
    \ in an audio/basic content-\n   type unless the originator is aware that the\
    \ recipient can handle\n   other content.  To enable future support of other formats,\
    \ IVM SHOULD\n   provide identification of the codec used without requiring\n\
    \   interpretation of an audio format.  IVM MAY allow audio encodings and\n  \
    \ formats that are not identified in the IVM specification to support\n   environments\
    \ in which the sender is aware of the optimal encoding and\n   format for the\
    \ recipient.\n   To address performance and bandwidth issues, IVM MAY support\n\
    \   streaming of IVM audio to the desktop.  IVM MAY explicitly support\n   formats\
    \ other than raw audio to facilitate streaming.\n   Because most email readers\
    \ are text/html based and because many\n   devices are not capable of recording\
    \ audio content, IVM MUST allow\n   inclusion of text body parts in a voice message.\
    \  IVM SHOULD NOT\n   explicitly prohibit other media types as long as critical\
    \ content is\n   identified and minimal discard rules are specified.\n   To support\
    \ devices that have applications dedicated to specific media\n   types or that\
    \ are not capable of handling specific content, IVM\n   SHOULD define a way to\
    \ describe the content of the message,\n   indicating how the content can be accessed.\n\
    \   Desktop implementation of IVM MUST support attachments of any media\n   type.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Interoperability with IVM-capable Voice Messaging Systems
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Interoperability with IVM-capable Voice Messaging Systems\n   Voice messaging\
    \ systems are generally implemented as special-purpose\n   machines that interface\
    \ to a telephone switch and provide call\n   answering and voice messaging services.\
    \  VPIM version 2 was designed\n   to support interoperability between such systems\
    \ and remains the best\n   messaging profile for this purpose.\n   To support\
    \ interoperability between IVM voice messaging systems and\n   other compliant\
    \ systems, IVM SHOULD have a minimum set of required\n   features that will guarantee\
    \ interoperability, and also provision for\n   additional functionality that may\
    \ be supported by more complex\n   systems.  IVM MUST define a mechanism for identifying\
    \ essential\n   content and status codes [CODES] indicating that a message could\
    \ not\n   be delivered due to capability differences.\n   NOTE: IVM SHOULD provide\
    \ some level of interoperability with VPIM\n   version 2 voice messaging systems.\
    \  In order to support minimal\n   interoperability between IVM and VPIM version\
    \ 2, IVM systems MAY be\n   able to receive the VPIM version 2 32KADPCM codec\
    \ [ADPCM and G726-\n   32], and MUST gracefully handle the case where a legacy\
    \ receiving\n   system does not support the IVM codecs.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Interoperability with IVM-capable Unified Messaging Systems
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Interoperability with IVM-capable Unified Messaging Systems\n   Unified\
    \ messaging solutions typically leverage common store,\n   directory, and transport\
    \ layers to provide greater interoperability\n   and accessibility to a variety\
    \ of media content.  They support\n   creation of and access to voicemail, email,\
    \ and fax messages from a\n   single user interface.\n   To accommodate the common\
    \ functionality of unified messaging systems,\n   IVM MUST support the inclusion\
    \ of body parts containing different\n   media types.  It MUST also handle messages\
    \ that contain VPIM messages\n   as attachments to messages of another type (such\
    \ as multipart/mixed),\n   and VPIM messages that contain attachments of another\
    \ type.\n   To provide interoperability with systems that cannot handle a\n  \
    \ particular content type, IVM MUST provide a mechanism for identifying\n   critical\
    \ content and MAY define media specific status codes and\n   strings to handle\
    \ non-delivery of these body parts.\n"
- title: 3.1.4.  Interoperability with Traditional Email Servers
  contents:
  - "3.1.4.  Interoperability with Traditional Email Servers\n   Traditional email\
    \ servers are those that support only textual media\n   as inline content.  IVM\
    \ MUST interoperate consistently with the\n   current Internet mail environment.\
    \  If an IVM message arrives in\n   users' mailboxes, IVM MUST provide a mechanism\
    \ to interoperate with\n   common user practices for mail messages: storing them\
    \ in databases,\n   retransmission, forwarding, creation of mail digests, and\
    \ replying to\n   messages using non-audio equipment.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Conformance to Existing Standards
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Conformance to Existing Standards\n   It is the goal of IVM to conform\
    \ as closely as possible to existing\n   standards while meeting the other goals\
    \ defined in this document.\n   -  Restrictions: The profile SHOULD impose as\
    \ few restrictions as\n      possible to existing Internet mail standards.  In\
    \ particular, it\n      MUST support all elements of RFC 2822 [DRUMSIMF], except\
    \ those\n      that prevent the profile from meeting other IVM goals.\n   -  Additions:\
    \ The profile SHOULD make as few additions as possible to\n      existing internet\
    \ mail standards.  It SHOULD adhere to existing\n      desktop conventions in\
    \ desktop-related areas such as file\n      extensions.  If it is necessary to\
    \ define new MIME types or sub-\n      types, the IVM work group SHOULD propose\
    \ terms that are already\n      standard or in common use in the desktop environment.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Backward Compatibility\n   This profile SHOULD provide backward compatibility\
    \ with VPIM version\n   2 to the extent that the functionality required to meet\
    \ the goals of\n   this profile is not compromised.  Where backward compatibility\
    \ is not\n   possible, IVM SHOULD provide and define a minimal set of rules and\n\
    \   status codes for handling non-delivery of IVM messages resulting from\n  \
    \ interoperability with VPIM version 2 systems and other legacy\n   systems.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Robustness
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Robustness\n   IVM MUST be usable in an environment in which there exist\
    \ legacy\n   gateways that do not understand MIME.  Core features and critical\n\
    \   data MUST not be lost when messages pass through AMIS gateways\n   [AMIS-A\
    \ and AMIS-D].  IVM SHOULD allow interoperability with\n   recipient devices and\
    \ gateways that have limited buffering\n   capabilities and cannot buffer all\
    \ header information.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.5.  Security Considerations\n   To facilitate security, IVM MUST support authenticated\
