  - "A.  Connecting to TSO\n    -----------------\n    IBM's Time Sharing Option (TSO)\
    \ is available at UCLA-CCN on Socket 1\n    using the standard Telnet protocol.\n\
    \    1.  To access TSO, the remote user performs ICP to Socket 1 at CCN\n    \
    \    and executes the command:\n                    TSO CR LF\n              \
    \          -- --\n    2.  Possible responses to the TSO command are:\n       \
    \ a.  \"WELCOME TO UCLA/CCN TSO\"\n            followed by a herald (\"!\"). \
    \ TSO is available.   A TSO LOGON\n            command should be entered following\
    \ the herald.\n        b.  \"TSO NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME\"\n            The\
    \ user should check the TSO schedule and verify that it\n            should be\
    \ available. If so, he can call the CCN on-line help\n            phone, 213-825-1652\
    \ for availability information, or send a\n            message to the operator\
    \ through NETRJS.\n        c.  \"ALL TSO PORTS BUSY\"\n            The user should\
    \ try again after a short time. If this\n            condition recurs frequently,\
    \ notify the Technical Liaison at\n            CCN so that more Network ports\
    \ can be added.\n    3.  When first connected to CCN server Telnet, the user has\
    \ a choice\n        of several commands besides \"TSO\". The TSO-related commands\
    \ are:\n            HELP    -  A listing of commands at this level, and other\n\
    \                       general information.\n            BBOARD  -  List operational\
    \ notices.\n    4.  Local echoing (i.e., by the user site) is required.\n    5.\
    \  Server-Telnet will time-out and disconnect the user if:\n        a.  Output\
    \ to the Network does not complete within 5 minutes, or\n        b.  An INS, DATA\
    \ MARK pair does not match within 2 minutes, or\n        c.  TSO waits for the\
    \ user to enter input for 20 minutes.\n"
- title: B.  Conversing with TSO
  contents:
  - "B.  Conversing with TSO\n    -------------------\n    1.  TSO is strictly a line-at-a-time\
    \ system.  Input is not scanned\n        until either an end-of-line or an INS\
    \ (interrupt) is received at\n        CCN.  TSO sends the user an exclamation\
    \ mark (\"!\") as a herald\n        when waiting for input.\n    2.  The end-of-line\
    \ indication for input and output lines is the\n        standard CR LF sequence.\n\
    \    3.  The remote user my interrupt TSO output by sending an INS and\n     \
    \   DATA MARK (Telnet X'80').  Note to TIP users: this may be\n        accomplished\
    \ with the TIP command \"SEND SYNC\".  Each such\n        interrupt is passed\
    \ to TSO, which interprets it as an output\n        break, i.e., as if the user\
    \ pressed the ATTention key on his\n        2741 while the keyboard was _locked_.\n\
    \        On the Network, \"attentions\" are not used to delete lines being\n \
    \       entered.  The CCN Server-Telnet provides line editing functions\n    \
    \    for TSO users: the ASCII control CAN deletes the line being\n        entered,\
    \ while BS deletes the preceding character.\n    4.  There is a third interrupt\
    \ case to be considered: suppose a\n        program has placed the user's terminal\
    \ into input state, but the\n        user wants to suspend its execution and take\
    \ control up a level\n        without satisfying the pending input request.  This\
    \ is supposed\n        to be accomplished by sending an INS/DATA MARK pair.\n\
    \        Unfortunately, due to a bug in our Network interface to TSO, the\n  \
    \      interrupt will be ignored in this case.  To circumvent this\n        problem,\
    \ we recommend that you define a software break string,\n        such as \"!!!!\"\
    .  This may be accomplished with the command:\n                    TERM INPUT\
    \ (!!!!)\n        Note that there are no quotes around the string.  You can enter\n\
    \        this command when you first log on, and it will remain in effect\n  \
    \      for the session (or until you issue a new TERM command).  Then\n      \
    \  any input line containing four successive exclamation points\n        will\
    \ be interpreted as if an interrupt (attention) had been\n        sent.  If that\
    \ line contains other characters preceding the\n        exclamation marks, the\
    \ latter will be interpreted as line\n        delete; otherwise, the result will\
    \ be to take control up a\n        level.\n"
