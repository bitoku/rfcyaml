- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Over the last few years, there have been several major attacks\
    \ on TLS\n   [RFC5246], including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and\n\
    \   modes of operation.  Details are given in Section 2, but a quick\n   summary\
    \ is that both AES-CBC and RC4, which together make up for most\n   current usage,\
    \ have been seriously attacked in the context of TLS.\n   This situation was one\
    \ of the motivations for the creation of the UTA\n   working group, which was\
    \ tasked with the creation of generic and\n   protocol-specific recommendations\
    \ for the use of TLS and DTLS\n   [RFC6347] (unless otherwise noted under Section\
    \ 3, all of the\n   information provided in this document applies to DTLS).\n\
    \   There is an old saying attributed, ironically enough, to the US\n   National\
    \ Security Agency (NSA): \"Attacks always get better; they\n   never get worse.\"\
    \  Unfortunately, that saying is true, so any\n   description of security attacks\
    \ can only be a snapshot in time.\n   Therefore this document reflects our knowledge\
    \ as of this writing.\n   It seems likely that new attacks will be discovered\
    \ in the future.\n   For a more detailed discussion of the attacks listed here,\
    \ the\n   interested reader is referred to [Attacks-iSec].\n"
- title: 2.  Attacks on TLS
  contents:
  - "2.  Attacks on TLS\n   This section lists the attacks that motivated the current\n\
    \   recommendations in [SECURE-TLS].  This list is not intended to be an\n   extensive\
    \ survey of the security of TLS.\n   While there are widely deployed mitigations\
    \ for some of the attacks\n   listed below, we believe that their root causes\
    \ necessitate a more\n   systematic solution, which we have attempted to develop\
    \ in\n   [SECURE-TLS].\n   When an identifier exists for an attack, we have included\
    \ its Common\n   Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID.  CVE [CVE] is an extensive,\n\
    \   industry-wide database of software vulnerabilities.\n"
- title: 2.1.  SSL Stripping
  contents:
  - "2.1.  SSL Stripping\n   Various attacks attempt to remove the use of Secure Socket\
    \ Layer /\n   Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) altogether by modifying\n   unencrypted\
    \ protocols that request the use of TLS, specifically\n   modifying HTTP traffic\
    \ and HTML pages as they pass on the wire.\n   These attacks are known collectively\
    \ as \"SSL Stripping\" (a form of\n   the more generic \"downgrade attack\") and\
    \ were first introduced by\n   Moxie Marlinspike [SSL-Stripping].  In the context\
    \ of Web traffic,\n   these attacks are only effective if the client initially\
    \ accesses a\n   Web server using HTTP.  A commonly used mitigation is HTTP Strict\n\
    \   Transport Security (HSTS) [RFC6797].\n"
- title: 2.2.  STARTTLS Command Injection Attack (CVE-2011-0411)
  contents:
  - "2.2.  STARTTLS Command Injection Attack (CVE-2011-0411)\n   Similarly, there\
    \ are attacks on the transition between unprotected\n   and TLS-protected traffic.\
    \  A number of IETF application protocols\n   have used an application-level command,\
    \ usually STARTTLS, to upgrade\n   a cleartext connection to use TLS.  Multiple\
    \ implementations of\n   STARTTLS had a flaw where an application-layer input\
    \ buffer retained\n   commands that were pipelined with the STARTTLS command,\
    \ such that\n   commands received prior to TLS negotiation are executed after\
    \ TLS\n   negotiation.  This problem is resolved by requiring the application-\n\
    \   level command input buffer to be empty before negotiating TLS.  Note\n   that\
    \ this flaw lives in the application layer code and does not\n   impact the TLS\
    \ protocol directly.\n   STARTTLS and similar mechanisms are vulnerable to downgrade\
    \ attacks,\n   whereby the attacker simply removes the STARTTLS indication from\
    \ the\n   (unprotected) request.  This cannot be mitigated unless HSTS-like\n\
    \   solutions are added.\n"
- title: 2.3.  BEAST (CVE-2011-3389)
  contents:
  - "2.3.  BEAST (CVE-2011-3389)\n   The BEAST attack [BEAST] uses issues with the\
    \ TLS 1.0 implementation\n   of Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) (that is, the predictable\n\
    \   initialization vector) to decrypt parts of a packet, and specifically\n  \
    \ to decrypt HTTP cookies when HTTP is run over TLS.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Padding Oracle Attacks
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Padding Oracle Attacks\n   A consequence of the MAC-then-encrypt design\
    \ in all current versions\n   of TLS is the existence of padding oracle attacks\
    \ [Padding-Oracle].\n   A recent incarnation of these attacks is the Lucky Thirteen\
    \ attack\n   (CVE-2013-0169) [CBC-Attack], a timing side-channel attack that\n\
    \   allows the attacker to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext.\n   The Lucky Thirteen\
    \ attack can be mitigated by using authenticated\n   encryption like AES-GCM [RFC5288]\
    \ or encrypt-then-MAC [RFC7366]\n   instead of the TLS default of MAC-then-encrypt.\n\
    \   An even newer variant of the padding oracle attack, one that does not\n  \
    \ use timing information, is the POODLE attack (CVE-2014-3566) [POODLE]\n   on\
    \ SSL 3.0.  This attack has no known mitigation.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Attacks on RC4
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Attacks on RC4\n   The RC4 algorithm [RC4] has been used with TLS (and\
    \ previously, SSL)\n   for many years.  RC4 has long been known to have a variety\
    \ of\n   cryptographic weaknesses, e.g., [RC4-Attack-Pau], [RC4-Attack-Man],\n\
    \   and [RC4-Attack-FMS].  Recent cryptanalysis results [RC4-Attack-AlF]\n   exploit\
    \ biases in the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted\n   plaintexts.\n\
    \   These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically\n   exploitable;\
    \ currently they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30\n   encryptions.  As a result,\
    \ RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a\n   sufficient level of security for\
    \ TLS sessions.  For further details,\n   the reader is referred to [CIPHER-SUITES]\
    \ and the references it\n   cites.\n"
- title: '2.6.  Compression Attacks: CRIME, TIME, and BREACH'
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Compression Attacks: CRIME, TIME, and BREACH\n   The CRIME attack [CRIME]\
    \ (CVE-2012-4929) allows an active attacker to\n   decrypt ciphertext (specifically,\
    \ cookies) when TLS is used with TLS-\n   level compression.\n   The TIME attack\
    \ [TIME] and the later BREACH attack [BREACH] (CVE-\n   2013-3587, though the\
    \ number has not been officially allocated) both\n   make similar use of HTTP-level\
    \ compression to decrypt secret data\n   passed in the HTTP response.  We note\
    \ that compression of the HTTP\n   message body is much more prevalent than compression\
    \ at the TLS\n   level.\n   The TIME attack can be mitigated by disabling TLS\
    \ compression.  We\n   are not aware of mitigations at the TLS protocol level\
    \ to the BREACH\n   attack, and so application-level mitigations are needed (see\n\
    \   [BREACH]).  For example, implementations of HTTP that use Cross-Site\n   Request\
    \ Forgery (CSRF) tokens will need to randomize them.  Even the\n   best practices\
    \ and recommendations from [SECURE-TLS] are insufficient\n   to thwart this attack.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Certificate and RSA-Related Attacks
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Certificate and RSA-Related Attacks\n   There have been several practical\
    \ attacks on TLS when used with RSA\n   certificates (the most common use case).\
    \  These include\n   [Bleichenbacher98] and [Klima03].  While the Bleichenbacher\
    \ attack\n   has been mitigated in TLS 1.0, the Klima attack, which relies on\
    \ a\n   version-check oracle, is only mitigated by TLS 1.1.\n   The use of RSA\
    \ certificates often involves exploitable timing issues\n   [Brumley03] (CVE-2003-0147),\
    \ unless the implementation takes care to\n   explicitly eliminate them.\n   A\
    \ recent certificate fuzzing tool [Brubaker2014using] uncovered\n   numerous vulnerabilities\
    \ in different TLS libraries related to\n   certificate validation.\n"
- title: 2.8.  Theft of RSA Private Keys
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Theft of RSA Private Keys\n   When TLS is used with most non-Diffie-Hellman\
    \ cipher suites, it is\n   sufficient to obtain the server's private key in order\
    \ to decrypt any\n   sessions (past and future) that were initiated with that\
    \ server.\n   This technique is used, for example, by the popular Wireshark network\n\
    \   sniffer to inspect TLS-protected connections.\n   It is known that stolen\
    \ (or otherwise obtained) private keys have\n   been used as part of large-scale\
    \ monitoring [RFC7258] of certain\n   servers.\n   Such attacks can be mitigated\
    \ by better protecting the private key,\n   e.g., using OS protections or dedicated\
    \ hardware.  Even more\n   effective is the use of cipher suites that offer \"\
    forward secrecy\",\n   the property where revealing a secret such as a private\
    \ key does not\n   expose past or future sessions to a passive attacker.\n"
- title: 2.9.  Diffie-Hellman Parameters
  contents:
  - "2.9.  Diffie-Hellman Parameters\n   TLS allows the definition of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman\
    \ (DH) and\n   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman parameters in its respective key\n\
    \   exchange modes.  This results in an attack detailed in\n   [Cross-Protocol].\
    \  Using predefined DH groups, as proposed in\n   [FFDHE-TLS], would mitigate\
    \ this attack.\n   In addition, clients that do not properly verify the received\n\
    \   parameters are exposed to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n   Unfortunately,\
    \ the TLS protocol does not mandate this verification\n   (see [RFC6989] for analogous\
    \ information for IPsec).\n"
- title: 2.10.  Renegotiation (CVE-2009-3555)
  contents:
  - "2.10.  Renegotiation (CVE-2009-3555)\n   A major attack on the TLS renegotiation\
    \ mechanism applies to all\n   current versions of the protocol.  The attack and\
    \ the TLS extension\n   that resolves it are described in [RFC5746].\n"
- title: 2.11.  Triple Handshake (CVE-2014-1295)
  contents:
  - "2.11.  Triple Handshake (CVE-2014-1295)\n   The triple handshake attack [BhargavanDFPS14]\
    \ enables the attacker to\n   cause two TLS connections to share keying material.\
    \  This leads to a\n   multitude of attacks, e.g., man-in-the-middle, breaking\
    \ safe\n   renegotiation, and breaking channel binding via TLS Exporter\n   [RFC5705]\
    \ or \"tls-unique\" [RFC5929].\n"
- title: 2.12.  Virtual Host Confusion
  contents:
  - "2.12.  Virtual Host Confusion\n   A recent article [Delignat14] describes a security\
    \ issue whereby\n   SSLv3 fallback and improper handling of session caches on\
    \ the server\n   side can be abused by an attacker to establish a malicious connection\n\
    \   to a virtual host other than the one originally intended and approved\n  \
    \ by the server.  This attack is especially serious in performance\n   critical\
    \ environments where sharing of SSLv3 session caches is very\n   common.\n"
- title: 2.13.  Denial of Service
  contents:
  - "2.13.  Denial of Service\n   Server CPU power has progressed over the years so\
    \ that TLS can now be\n   turned on by default.  However, the risk of malicious\
    \ clients and\n   coordinated groups of clients (\"botnets\") mounting denial-of-service\n\
    \   attacks is still very real.  TLS adds another vector for\n   computational\
    \ attacks, since a client can easily (with little\n   computational effort) force\
    \ the server to expend relatively large\n   computational work.  It is known that\
    \ such attacks have in fact been\n   mounted.\n"
- title: 2.14.  Implementation Issues
  contents:
  - "2.14.  Implementation Issues\n   Even when the protocol is properly specified,\
    \ this does not guarantee\n   the security of implementations.  In fact, there\
    \ are very common\n   issues that often plague TLS implementations.  In particular,\
    \ when\n   integrating into higher-level protocols, TLS and its PKI-based\n  \
    \ authentication are sometimes the source of misunderstandings and\n   implementation\
    \ \"shortcuts\".  An extensive survey of these issues can\n   be found in [Georgiev2012].\n\
    \   o  Implementations might omit validation of the server certificate\n     \
    \ altogether.  For example, this is true of the default\n      implementation\
    \ of HTTP client libraries in Python 2 (e.g., CVE-\n      2013-2191).\n   o  Implementations\
    \ might not validate the server identity.  This\n      validation typically amounts\
    \ to matching the protocol-level server\n      name with the certificate's Subject\
    \ Alternative Name field.  Note:\n      this same information is often also found\
    \ in the Common Name part\n      of the Distinguished Name, and some validators\
    \ incorrectly\n      retrieve it from there instead of from the Subject Alternative\n\
    \      Name.\n   o  Implementations might validate the certificate chain incorrectly\n\
    \      or not at all, or use an incorrect or outdated trust anchor list.\n   An\
    \ implementation attack of a different kind, one that exploits a\n   simple coding\
    \ mistake (bounds check), is the Heartbleed attack (CVE-\n   2014-0160) that affected\
    \ a wide swath of the Internet when it was\n   discovered in April 2014.\n"
- title: 2.15.  Usability
  contents:
  - "2.15.  Usability\n   Many TLS endpoints, such as browsers and mail clients, allow\
