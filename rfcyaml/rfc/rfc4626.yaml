    - "3.1.  Introduction\n   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional
      point-to-point\n   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre
      Channel\n   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols,
      such\n   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-\n
      \  Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet\n   Protocol),
      IEEE 802.2, and others.\n   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection
      of multiple\n   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either
      by a\n   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n
      \  Fibre Channel \"node\" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n   consist
      of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are\n   switches.  An N_Port
      connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch\n   called an F_Port.  When multiple
      FC nodes are connected to a single\n   port on a switch via an \"Arbitrated
      Loop\" topology, the switch port\n   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports
      are called NL_Ports.  The\n   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port
      or an NL_Port.  The\n   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or
      an FL_Port.  A\n   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port
      via an\n   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects
      a\n   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset\n
      \  of E_Port functionality.\n   Many Fibre Channel components, including the
      fabric, each node, and\n   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique
      names\n   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information\n
      \  on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent\n   across
      agent and unit resets.\n   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers
      that identify\n   the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has
      both an\n   address identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the FC\n
      \  address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.  Each\n   octet
      of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy,\n   a Domain_ID
      being the highest level of the hierarchy.\n   The routing of frames within the
      Fabric is normally based on a\n   routing protocol called Fabric Shortest Path
      First (FSPF).  FSPF is a\n   link state path selection protocol, which is defined
      in Section 8 of\n   [FC-SW-4].  FSPF keeps track of the state of the links on
      all\n   switches in the Fabric and associates a cost with each link.  The\n
      \  protocol computes paths from a switch to all the other switches in\n   the
      Fabric by adding the cost of all the links traversed by the path,\n   and choosing
      the path that minimizes the cost.  The collection of\n   link states (including
      cost) of all the switches in a Fabric\n   constitutes the topology database
      (or link-state database).\n"
    title: 3.1.  Introduction
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  FSPF Protocol\n   FSPF has four major components:\n   a) A Hello protocol,
      used to establish connectivity with a neighbor\n      switch, to establish the
      identity of the neighbor switch, and to\n      exchange FSPF parameters and
      capabilities;\n   b) A replicated topology database, with protocols and mechanisms
      to\n      keep the databases synchronized across the Fabric;\n   c) A path computation
      algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm);\n   d) A routing table update.\n   The
      topology database synchronization in turn consists of two major\n   components:
      an initial database synchronization and an update\n   mechanism.  The initial
      database synchronization is used when a\n   switch is initialized, or when an
      Inter-Switch Link (ISL) comes up.\n   The update mechanism is used in two circumstances:\n
      \  a) When there is a link state change; for example, an ISL going down\n      or
      coming up;\n   b) On a periodic basis, to prevent switches from deleting topology\n
      \     information from the database.\n   Also note that all connections between
      Fibre Channel switches are\n   point-to-point.\n"
    title: 3.2.  FSPF Protocol
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Virtual Fabrics\n   The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric
      containing multiple\n   Fabric Switch elements is [FC-SW-4].  [FC-SW-4] carries
      forward the\n   previous version's specification for the operation of a single
      Fabric\n   in a physical infrastructure, augmenting it with the definition of\n
      \  Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how multiple Virtual\n   Fabrics
      can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.\n   The use of Virtual
      Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in\n   its header to indicate which
      one of several Virtual Fabrics that\n   frame is being transmitted on.  All
      frames entering a particular\n   \"Core Switch\" [FC-SW-4] (i.e., a physical
      switch) on the same Virtual\n   Fabric are processed by the same \"Virtual Switch\"
      within that Core\n   switch.\n"

  title: 3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel
- contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   The first standardized MIB module for Fibre
    Channel [RFC4044] was\n   focussed on Fibre Channel switches.  It is being replaced
    by the more\n   generic Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT] which defines basic\n
    \  information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including\n   extensions
    to the standard IF-MIB [RFC2863] for Fibre Channel\n   interfaces.\n   This MIB
    module extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the operation of\n   the FSPF routing
    protocol in Fibre Channel switches.\n   This MIB module only contains information
    specific to FSPF.\n   Information that would still be applicable if any other
    routing\n   protocol were used is specified in a separate MIB module.\n   This
    MIB module imports some common Textual Conventions from T11-TC-\n   MIB, defined
    in [RFC4439].\n"
  title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIBs
- contents:
  - "5.  MIB Overview\n   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation
    of,\n   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of the FSPF\n
    \  protocol.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance\n   A Fibre Channel management instance
      is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a\n   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel
      functionality.  Fibre\n   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel
      management\n   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the\n   implementation(s).
      \ For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single SNMP agent with multiple
      AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with\n   each sub-agent implementing a different
      Fibre Channel management\n   instance.\n   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is
      IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB\n   [FC-MGMT] as the index value that uniquely
      identifies each Fibre\n   Channel management instance within the same SNMP context
      ([RFC3411],\n   Section 3.3.1).\n"
    title: 5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Switch Index\n   The FC-MGMT-MIB [FC-MGMT] defines the fcmSwitchTable
      as a table of\n   information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed
      by Fibre\n   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance\n
      \  can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,\n   fcmSwitchIndex,
      is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value\n   that uniquely identifies
      a Fibre Channel switch among those (one or\n   more) managed by the same Fibre
      Channel management instance.\n"
    title: 5.2.  Switch Index
  - contents:
    - "5.3.  Fabric Index\n   Whether operating on a physical Fabric (i.e., without
      Virtual\n   Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the operation of FSPF within
      a\n   Fabric is identical.  Therefore, this MIB module defines all Fabric-\n
      \  related information in tables that are INDEX-ed by an arbitrary\n   integer,
      named a \"Fabric Index\", the syntax of which is IMPORTed from\n   the T11-TC-MIB.
      \ When a device is connected to a single physical\n   Fabric, without use of
      any virtual Fabrics, the value of this Fabric\n   Index will always be 1.  In
      an environment of multiple virtual and/or\n   physical Fabrics, this index provides
      a means to distinguish one\n   Fabric from another.\n   It is quite possible,
      and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel\n   switch will have ports connected
      to multiple virtual and/or physical\n   Fabrics.  Thus, in order to simplify
      a management protocol query\n   concerning all the Fabrics to which a single
      switch is connected,\n   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FspfFabricIndex
      when they\n   both appear in the same INDEX clause.\n"

    a row in this table via t11FspfIfRowStatus\n           provides the means to specify
    non-default parameter value(s)\n           for an interface at a time when the
    relevant row in this\n           table would not otherwise exist because the interface
    is\n           either down or it is not an E_Port, but the corresponding\n           row
    in the t11FspfTable must already exist.\n           After the non-default values
    have been specified for a\n           port's parameters, they need to be retained

    a G_Port which is dynamically determined to be an\n              F_Port), and
    all configurable parameters have default\n              values; or\n           b)
    if the interface identified by t11FspfIfIndex no longer\n              exists
    (e.g., because a line-card is physically removed);\n              or\n           c)

    module under the\n   appropriate subtree.\n"
  title: 8.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   There are several management objects defined
    in this MIB module with\n   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such objects\n   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability are:\n        t11FspfMinLsArrival,
    t11FspfMinLsInterval,\n        t11FspfIfHelloInterval, t11FspfIfDeadInterval &\n
    \       t11FspfIfRetransmitInterval\n           -- alter the responsiveness of
    the FSPF protocol\n        t11FspfAdminStatus & t11FspfIfAdminStatus\n           --
    enable/disable dynamic routing via FSPF\n        t11FspfSetToDefault & t11FspfIfSetToDefault\n
    \          -- nullify valid configuration changes\n        t11FspfIfLinkCostFactor\n
    \          -- alter the choice of links\n        t11FspfNbrStateChangNotifyEnable\n
    \          -- enable/disable notifications.\n   The support for SET operations
    in a non-secure environment without\n   proper protection can have a negative
    effect on network operations.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module
    (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
    sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important
    to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to
    even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network
    via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \     t11FspfTable -- contains per-Fabric parameters and statistics\n      t11FspfIfTable
    -- contains per-interface parameters and statistics\n      t11FspfLsrTable & t11FspfLinkTable
    -- database of LSR information,\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include
    adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using
    IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n
    \  allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in
    this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security
    features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n
    \  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication
    and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n
    \  RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable
    cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to
    ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module
    is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.\n"
