  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document clarifies the privacy mechanism for the Session\n\
    \   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] defined in [RFC3323], which was\n   later\
    \ extended in [RFC3325] and [RFC4244].  This document describes\n   the practical\
    \ manner of operations of the privacy mechanism as a\n   guideline and does not\
    \ change the existing privacy mechanism.\n   In RFC 3323, the semantics of the\
    \ basic set of priv-values (header,\n   session, user, none, and critical) is\
    \ defined, but there are some\n   ambiguities in regards to the target information\
    \ to be obscured per\n   priv-value, which are not explicitly specified.  An ambiguity\
    \ such as\n   this could result in different interpretations of privacy handling\n\
    \   for each of the priv-values defined, both at an entity setting a\n   Privacy\
    \ header and at an entity processing a Privacy header, which\n   could have an\
    \ adverse impact on interoperability.\n   Additional priv-values \"id\" and \"\
    history\" are defined in RFCs 3325\n   and 4244, respectively.\n   In RFC 4244,\
    \ the priv-value \"history\" is defined in order to request\n   privacy for History-Info\
    \ headers, and the target to be obscured for\n   \"history\" priv-value is specified\
    \ as only the History-Info headers.\n   In addition, the RFC clearly describes\
    \ that History-Info headers are\n   also the target when \"header\"- and \"session\"\
    -level privacy are\n   requested.\n   On the other hand, RFC 3325 defines the\
    \ P-Asserted-Identity header\n   and a priv-value \"id\", which is used to request\
    \ privacy for only the\n   P-Asserted-Identity header, but it does not specify\
    \ how other priv-\n   values may impact the privacy handling of the P-Asserted-Identity\n\
    \   header.  Because of this lack of specification, it has been observed\n   that\
    \ some implementations are suffering from the inability to achieve\n   the intended\
    \ privacy due to discrepancies in interpretations.\n   This document tries to\
    \ clarify the SIP headers and SDP parameters to\n   be obscured for each of the\
    \ priv-values to alleviate the potential\n   interoperability issues already seen\
    \ due to a lack of explicit text.\n"

    \ for the detailed behavior.\n   Identity/Identity-Info, Path, Replaces, Route,\
    \ Service-Route, and\n   Target-Dialog headers are not targets of these priv-values\

    \ the request with a 500 (Server Error)\n   response code as indicated in Section\
    \ 5 in RFC 3323.\n   Since the protection of privacy is important, even if the\
    \ priv-value\n   \"critical\" is not present in the Privacy header, the privacy\

- title: 5.1.1.  Call-ID
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Call-ID\n   This field frequently contains an IP address or hostname\
    \ of a UAC\n   (User Agent Client) appended to the Call-ID value.\n   A user agent\
    \ executing a user-level privacy function on its own\n   SHOULD substitute for\
    \ the IP address or hostname that is frequently\n   appended to the Call-ID value\
    \ a suitably long random value (the value\n   used as the 'tag' for the From header\
    \ of the request might even be\n   reused) as indicated in Section 4.1 in RFC\
    \ 3323.\n   A privacy service MAY anonymize the Call-ID header when the request\n\
    \   contains Privacy:user by substituting for the IP address or hostname\n   in\
    \ the Call-ID a suitably long random value (such as a From tag\n   value) so that\
    \ it is sufficiently unique as indicated in Section 5.3\n   in RFC 3323.\n   Call-ID\
    \ is essential to dialog matching, so any time a privacy\n   service modifies\
    \ this field, it MUST retain the former value and\n   restore it in a Call-ID\
    \ header in any messages that are sent to/by\n   the originating user agent inside\
    \ the dialog as indicated in Section\n   5.3 in RFC 3323.  A privacy service should\
    \ be prepared to receive a\n   request outside the dialog containing the value\
    \ of the Call-ID set by\n   the PS in other SIP headers (e.g., In-Reply-To/Replaces/\n\
    \   Target-Dialog), at least while the dialog state is active for the\n   dialog\
    \ whose Call-ID was modified by that PS.  When such a request is\n   received,\
    \ the Call-ID value contained in the relevant headers\n   indicated above should\
    \ be replaced by the retained value.\n   Note: This is possible only if the privacy\
    \ service maintains the\n         state and retains all the information it modified\
    \ to provide\n         privacy.  Some PSs are known to encrypt information prior\
    \ to\n         obfuscation in the Via header, etc.  In this case, the PS\n   \
    \      cannot correlate the modified Call-ID value with the original\n       \
    \  Call-ID.  Further challenges are imposed when the PS needs to\n         stay\
    \ on a signaling path to ensure that it receives all the\n         messages targeted\
    \ towards the caller for which a PS provides\n         privacy, especially when\
    \ the request is out-of-dialog.\n   Refer to the corresponding sections, 5.1.6\

    \ (e.g.,\n   'sip:anonymous@example.com'), which makes it possible for the service\n\
    \   to authenticate the UAC.  This authenticated yet anonymous From\n   header\
    \ means \"this is a known user in my domain that I have\n   authenticated, but\
    \ I am keeping its identity private\" as indicated in\n   Section 12 in RFC 4474.\n\
    \   The desired deployment will have a privacy service located before or\n   co-located\
    \ with the identity service; thus, integrity and privacy can\n   both be provided\
    \ seamlessly.\n"

  - "5.3.2.  Path\n   This field may contain information about the administrative\
    \ domain\n   and/or the visited domain of the user agent.  However, the Path\n\
    \   header is not the target of any priv-values.\n   Given that the Path header\
    \ [RFC3327] only appears in REGISTER\n   requests/responses and is essential for\
    \ a call to reach the\n   registered UA in the visited domain, it serves no purpose\
    \ to withhold\n   or hide the information contained in the Path header; rather,\
    \ it is\n   harmful.\n   The only reason privacy may be considered desirable is\
    \ if the visited\n   domain wants to withhold its topology from the home domain\
    \ of the\n   user.  In doing so, the domain withholding the topology needs to\n\
    \   ensure that it provides sufficient information so that the home\n   domain\
    \ can route the call to the visited domain, thus reaching the\n   UA.\n   However,\
    \ anonymization of network-privacy-sensitive information is\n   out of scope.\n"
- title: 5.3.3.  Replaces Header/Parameter
  contents:
  - "5.3.3.  Replaces Header/Parameter\n   The Replaces [RFC3891] header and the \"\
    replaces\" parameter contain\n   identifiers of a dialog to be replaced, which\
    \ are composed of Call-\n   ID, local tag, and remote tag.\n   The sender of the\
    \ INVITE with a Replaces header is usually not the\n   originating user agent\
    \ or terminating user agent of the target dialog\n   to be replaced.  Therefore,\
    \ the Call-ID within the Replaces header is\n   unlikely to be generated by the\
    \ sender, and thus this header is\n   outside the anonymization target per priv-value.\n\
    \   The \"replaces\" parameter, which appears in a Refer-To header in a\n   REFER\
    \ request, is not the target of any particular priv-values\n   either.  As described\
    \ in Section 5.1.1 (Call-ID), regardless of the\n   priv-value or the presence\
    \ of a Privacy header, once a privacy\n   service modifies a Call-ID in the request,\
    \ it should monitor headers\n   that may contain Call-ID and restore the portion\
    \ of the value\n   representing the modified Call-ID to the original Call-ID value\
    \ in a\n   Replaces header received.\n   The main challenge for this to function\
    \ properly is that a privacy\n   service has to be on a signaling path to the\
    \ originator for every\n   dialog.  This is generally not possible and results\
    \ in REFER requests\n   not functioning at all times.  This is a trade-off that\
    \ is\n   anticipated when privacy is imposed.\n   The privacy requirements mentioned\
    \ in Section 5.1.1 will cause the\n   Replaces header and \"replaces\" parameter\
    \ to contain values that will\n   fail the resulting dialog establishment in some\
    \ situations.  This\n   loss of functionality is allowed and/or intended as illustrated\
    \ above\n   (i.e., it is not the responsibility of a privacy service to ensure\n\
    \   that these features always work).\n   The functionality of the Replaces header/parameter\
    \ when anonymized\n   depends on the circumstances in which it is used.  REFER\
    \ may work or\n   may not work depending on the following three criteria.\n  \
    \ 1. Who generated the Call-ID.\n   2. Where the privacy service is on the signaling\
    \ path.\n   3. Who initiates the REFER with the \"replaces\" parameter.\n   A\
    \ few examples that explore when the Replaces header/parameter works\n   or fails\
    \ are given below.\n   Example 1:\n   Transfer initiated by the originator, PS\
    \ added for first INV and REF\n   Alice > INV(Call-ID:C1, Privacy:user) > PS >\
    \ INV(Call-ID:C2) > Bob\n   Alice > REF(Refer-To:Bob?Replaces=C1, Privacy:user)\
    \ > PS >\n           REF(Refer-To:Bob?Replaces=C2) > Carol\n   Carol > INV(Replaces:C2)\
    \ > Bob (SUCCEED)\n   Example 2:\n   Transfer initiated by the originator, PS\
    \ added only for first INV\n   Alice > INV(Call-ID:C1, Privacy:user) > PS > INV(Call-ID:C2)\
    \ > Bob\n   Alice > REF(Refer-To:Bob?Replaces=C1) > Carol\n   Carol > INV(Replaces:C1)\
    \ > Bob (FAIL)\n   Note: Example 2 would succeed if the same PS (that modifies\
    \ the Call-\n         ID in the INVITE from Alice) is also added for REFER and\n\
    \         modifies the value in the \"replaces\" parameter from C1 to C2\n   \
    \      even if there is no Privacy header in the REFER.\n   Example 3:\n   Transfer\
    \ initiated by the originator, PS added only for REF\n   Alice > INV(Call-ID:C1)\
    \ > INV(Call-ID:C1) > Bob\n   Alice > REF(Refer-To:Bob?Replaces=C1, Privacy:user)\
    \ > PS >\n           REF(Refer-To:Bob?Replaces=C1) > Carol\n   Carol > INV(Replaces:C1,\
    \ Privacy:user) > PS' >\n           INV(Replaces:C1) > Bob (SUCCEED)\n   Example\
    \ 4:\n   Transfer initiated by the terminating party, PS added for both INV\n\
    \   Alice > INV(Call-ID:C1, Privacy:user) > PS > INV(Call-ID:C2) > Bob\n   Bob\
    \   > REF(Refer-To:Alice?Replaces=C2) > Carol\n   Carol > INV(Replaces:C2) > PS\
    \ > INV(Replaces:C1) > Alice (SUCCEED)\n   Note: Example 4 succeeds because the\
    \ same PS (that modifies the Call-\n         ID in the INVITE from Alice) checks\
    \ the incoming requests and\n         modifies the value in a Replaces header\
    \ in the INVITE from\n         Carol to the former value of Call-ID (C1).\n  \
    \ Example 5:\n   Hold, PS added only for first INV\n   Alice > INV(Call-ID:C1,\
    \ Privacy:user) > PS > INV(Call-ID:C2) > Bob\n   Alice > REF(Refer-To:Bob?Replaces=C1)\
    \ > Music-Server\n   Music-Server > INV(Replaces:C1) > Bob (FAIL)\n   Note: Example\
    \ 5 would succeed if the same PS (that modifies the Call-\n         ID in the\
    \ INVITE from Alice) is added for the INVITE from the\n         Music-Server and\
    \ modifies the value in a Replaces header from\n         C1 to C2.\n   As the\
    \ above examples show, in some scenarios, information carried in\n   the Replaces\
    \ header/parameter would result in failure of the REFER.\n   This will not happen\
    \ if the Call-ID is not modified at a privacy\n   service.\n"
- title: 5.3.4.  Route
  contents:
  - "5.3.4.  Route\n   This field may contain information about the administrative\
    \ domain of\n   the user agent, but the Route header is not the target of any\
    \ priv-\n   values.\n   Route headers appear only in SIP requests to force routing\
    \ through\n   the listed set of proxies.  If a privacy service anonymizes the\
    \ Route\n   header, the routing does not function.  Furthermore, there is no risk\n\
    \   in revealing the information in the Route headers to further network\n   entities,\
    \ including the terminating user agent, because a proxy\n   removes the value\
    \ from the Route header when it replaces the value in\n   the Request-URI as defined\
    \ in RFC 3261.\n   A privacy service that modifies Record-Route headers may need\
    \ to\n   restore the values in Route headers as necessary.  As indicated in\n\
    \   Section 5.1 in RFC 3323, if a privacy service modifies the Record-\n   Route\
    \ headers, it MUST be able to restore Route headers with retained\n   values.\
    \  Please refer to Section 5.1.9 (Record-Route) for further\n   detail and examples.\n"
- title: 5.3.5.  Service-Route
  contents:
  - "5.3.5.  Service-Route\n   Service-Route headers [RFC3608] appear only in 200\
    \ OK responses to\n   REGISTER requests and contain information about the registrar.\
    \  The\n   purpose of the privacy mechanism defined in RFC 3323 is to secure the\n\
    \   user's privacy, so the case where a registrar sets a Privacy header\n   is\
    \ not considered here.  Therefore, the Service-Route header is not\n   the target\
    \ of any priv-values.\n"
- title: 5.3.6.  Target-Dialog
  contents:
  - "5.3.6.  Target-Dialog\n   The Target-Dialog [RFC4538] header faces exactly the\
    \ same issues as\n   seen for the Replaces header.  Please refer to Section 5.3.3\n\
    \   (Replaces Header/Parameter) for why this is not a target for any\n   particular\
