Abstract This document defines the 'application/tei xml' media type for markup languages defined in accordance with the Text Encoding and Interchange guidelines.
Introduction Text Encoding and Interchange (TEI) is an international and interdisciplinary standard that is widely used by libraries, museums, publishers, and individual scholars to represent all kinds of textual material for online research and teaching [TEI].
This document defines the 'application/tei xml' media type in accordance with [RFC3023] in order to enable generic processing of such documents on the Internet using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) [W3C.REC xml 20081126] technologies.
Recognizing TEI Files TEI files are XML documents or fragments having the root element (as defined in [W3C.REC xml 20081126]) in a TEI namespace.
TEI namespace names are defined as a Universal Resource Identifier (URI)
[RFC3986] in accordance with [W3C.REC xml names 20091208] and begins with http://www.tei c.org/ns/ followed by the version number of the namespace.
The current namespace is http://www.tei c.org/ns/1.0
The most common root element names for TEI documents are <TEI>
The teiCorpus documents provide the ability to bundle multiple documents into a single file.
A document having <TEI> root element <?
xml version "1.0" encoding "UTF 8" ?
A document having <teiCorpus> root element <?
xml version "1.0" encoding "UTF 8" ?
TEI and teiCorpus files are often given the extensions .tei
There is a third type of file, which often is given the suffix .odd.
ODD ("One Document Does it All") is a TEI XML document that includes schema fragments, prose documentation, and reference documentation.
It is used for the definition and documentation of XML based languages, and primarily for the TEI Guidelines [ODD].
In other words, ODD files do not differ from other TEI files in syntax, only in function.
Fragment Identifier Documents having the media type 'application/tei xml' use the fragment identifier notation as specified in [RFC3023] for the media type 'application/xml'.
An XML resource does not in itself compromise data security.
When being available on a network simply through the dereferencing of an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) [RFC3987] or a URI, care must be taken to properly interpret the data to prevent unintended access.
Hence the security issues of [RFC3986], Section 7, apply.
In addition, as this media type uses the " xml" convention, it shares the same security considerations as described in RFC 3023
In general, security issues related to the use of XML in IETF protocols are treated in RFC 3470
We will not try to duplicate this material, but review some aspects that are important for document centric XML as applied to text encoding.
Any application accepting submitted or retrieving TEI XML for processing has to be aware of risks connected with injection of harmful scripts and executable XML.
XML inclusion [W3C.REC xinclude 20061115] and the use of external entities are vulnerable to various forms of spoofing, and can also reveal aspects of a service in a way that may compromise its security.
Any vulnerability of these kinds are, however, application specific.
The TEI namespaces do not contain such elements.
Authenticity and confidentiality Historical archival records are often encoded in TEI and legal document may be binding centuries after they were written.
Digitization and encoding of legal texts may require technologies for assuring authenticity, such as cryptographic checksums and electronic signatures.
Similarly, historical documents may in part or in their entirety be confidential.
This may be required by law or by the terms and conditions, such as in the case of donated or deposited text from private sources.
A text archive may need content filtering or cryptographic technologies to meet such requirements.
Registration of MIME Type 'application/tei xml' MIME media type name: application MIME subtype name:
None Optional parameters: charset the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in RFC 3023
Encoding considerations: Identical to those for 'application/xml'.
: See Security Considerations (Section 4) in this specification.
Interoperability considerations: TEI documents are often given the extension '.xml', which is not uncommon for other XML document formats.
This media type registration is for TEI documents [TEI] as described here.
TEI syntax is defined in a schema [TEIschema].
Applications which use this media type: There are currently no known applications using the media type 'application/tei xml'.
: There is no single initial octet sequence that is always present in TEI documents.
See Recognizing TEI files (Section 2) in this specification.
