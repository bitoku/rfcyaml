Abstract RFC 1745, "BGP4/IDRP for IP OSPF Interaction", describes technology which was never deployed in the public internet.
This document requests that RFC 1745 be moved to Historic status.
Details During a review of internet standards relating to BGP, it became apparent that BGP/IDRP OSPF interaction, as described in RFC 1745, has never been deployed in the public internet, and would require significant implementation complexity.
Since this mechanism has never been in use in the public internet, it is proposed to reclassify it to Historic. 2.
Security Considerations Moving RFC 1745 to Historic has no known effect on the security of the internet.
