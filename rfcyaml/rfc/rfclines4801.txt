Abstract This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module that contains textual conventions (TCs) to represent commonly used Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) management information.
The intent is that these textual conventions will be imported and used in GMPLS related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations.
This document defines a MIB module that contains textual conventions (TCs) for Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks.
These textual conventions should be imported by MIB modules that manage GMPLS networks.
This MIB module supplements the MIB module in [RFC3811] that defines textual conventions for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) management.
[RFC3811] may continue to be used without this MIB module in networks that support only MPLS.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
For an introduction to the concepts of GMPLS, see [RFC3945].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
GMPLS Textual Conventions MIB Definitions
This MIB module makes reference to the following documents: [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC3471], and [RFC3811].

Objects with this syntax can be used to represent labels that have label types that are not defined in any RFCs.
The freeform GMPLS Label may also be used by systems that do not wish to represent labels that have label types defined in RFCs using type specific syntaxes.
Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
Signaling Functional Description, RFC 3471, section 3.2.
SYNTAX OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..64))
"Determines the interpretation that should be applied to an object that encodes a label.
The possible types are: gmplsMplsLabel(1)
The label is an MPLS Packet, Cell, or Frame Label and is encoded as described for the TEXTUAL  CONVENTION MplsLabel defined in RFC 3811.
The label is a Port or Wavelength Label as defined in RFC 3471.
The label is any form of label encoded as an OCTET STRING using the TEXTUAL CONVENTION GmplsFreeformLabel.
The label is a Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) Label as defined in RFC 4606.
The label is a Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) Label as defined in RFC 4606.

"The direction of data flow on an Label Switched Path (LSP) segment with respect to the head of the LSP.
Where an LSP is signaled using a conventional signaling protocol, the 'head' of the LSP is the source of the signaling (also known as the ingress) and the 'tail' is the destination (also known as the egress).
For unidirectional LSPs, this usually matches the direction of flow of data.
For manually configured unidirectional LSPs, the direction of the LSP segment matches the direction of flow of data.
For manually configured bidirectional LSPs, an arbitrary decision must be made about which LER is the 'head'.
data flows from tail end of LSP toward head end } END 4.
This module does not define any management objects.
Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other GMPLS MIB modules to define management objects.
Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define management objects.
Therefore, this document has no impact on the security of the Internet.
IANA Considerations IANA has rooted MIB objects in this MIB module under the mplsStdMIB subtree by assigning an OID to gmplsTCStdMIB.
In the future, GMPLS related standards track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB (sic) subtree.
IANA has been requested to manage that namespace in the SMI Numbers registry [RFC3811].
New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].
