  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5440] specifies the Path Computation Element Communication\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client\n   (PCC)
    and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs, in\n   compliance with
    [RFC4657].\n   Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) addresses the\n
    \  fundamental requirement to be able to enforce different bandwidth\n   constraints
    for different classes of traffic.  It describes\n   mechanisms to achieve per-class
    traffic engineering, rather than on\n   an aggregate basis across all classes
    by enforcing Bandwidth\n   Constraints (BCs) on different classes.  Requirements
    for DS-TE and\n   the associated protocol extensions are specified in [RFC3564]
    and\n   [RFC4124], respectively.\n   As per [RFC4657], PCEP must support traffic
    Class-Type as an MPLS-\n   TE-specific constraint.  However, in the present form,
    PCEP [RFC5440]\n   does not have the capability to specify the Class-Type in the
    path\n   computation request.\n   In this document, we define a new PCEP object
    called CLASSTYPE, which\n   carries the Class-Type of the TE LSP in the path computation
    request.\n   During path computation, a PCE uses the Class-Type to identify the\n
    \  bandwidth constraint of the TE LSP.\n"

      N (1 <= N <= 7), the PCC\n   originating the PCReq MUST include the CLASSTYPE
      object in the PCReq\n   message with the Class-Type (CT) field set to N.\n   If
      a path computation request contains multiple CLASSTYPE objects,\n   only the
      first one is meaningful; subsequent CLASSTYPE object(s) MUST\n   be ignored
      and MUST NOT be forwarded.\n   If the CLASSTYPE object is not present in the
      path computation\n   request message, the LSR MUST associate the Class-Type
      0 to the LSP.\n   A path computation reply message MUST NOT include a CLASSTYPE
      object.\n   If a PCE needs to forward a path computation request containing
      the\n   CLASSTYPE object to another PCE, it MUST store the Class-Type of the\n
      \  TE LSP in order to complete the path computation when the path\n   computation
      reply arrives.\n   A PCE that does not recognize the CLASSTYPE object MUST reject
      the\n   entire PCEP message and MUST send a PCE error message with Error-\n
      \  Type=\"Unknown Object\" or \"Not supported object\", defined in\n   [RFC5440].\n
      \  A PCE that recognizes the CLASSTYPE object, but finds that the P flag\n   is
      not set in the CLASSTYPE object, MUST send PCE error message\n   towards the
      sender with the error type and error value specified in\n   [RFC5440].\n   A
      PCE that recognizes the CLASSTYPE object, but does not support the\n   particular
      Class-Type, MUST send a PCE error message towards the\n   sender with the error
      type \"Diffserv-aware TE error\" and the error\n   value of \"Unsupported Class-Type\"
      (Error-value 1).\n   A PCE that recognizes the CLASSTYPE object, but determines
      that the\n   Class-Type value is not valid (i.e., Class-Type value 0), MUST
      send a\n   PCE error towards the sender with the error type \"Diffserv-aware
      TE\n   error\" and an error value of \"Invalid Class-Type\" (Error-value 2).\n"

      is used to determine the unreserved\n   bandwidth on the links during path computation.
      \ In the case of a\n   PCE, the CT value carried in the CLASSTYPE object and
