  - "2.  4-Octet AS Specific Extended Community\n   This is an extended type with
    a Type field comprising 2 octets and a\n   Value field comprising 6 octets.\n
    \   0                   1                   2                   3\n    0 1 2 3
    4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n

    \  : Global Administrator (cont.)  |    Local Administrator        |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  The value of the high-order octet of this extended type is either\n   0x02
    (for transitive communities) or 0x42 (for non-transitive\n   communities).  The
    low-order octet of this extended type is used to\n   indicate sub-types.\n   The
    Value field consists of 2 sub-fields:\n      Global Administrator sub-field: 4
    octets\n         This sub-field contains a 4-octet Autonomous System number\n
    \        assigned by IANA.\n      Local Administrator sub-field: 2 octets\n         The
    organization identified by the Autonomous System number in\n         the Global
    Administrator sub-field can encode any information\n         in this sub-field.
    \ The format and meaning of the value encoded\n         in this sub-field should
    be defined by the sub-type of the\n         community.\n"
  title: 2.  4-Octet AS Specific Extended Community
- contents:
  - "3.  Considerations for 2-Octet Autonomous Systems\n   As per [RFC4893], a 2-octet
    Autonomous System number can be converted\n   into a 4-octet Autonomous System
    number by setting the 2 high-order\n   octets of the 4-octet field to zero.\n
    \  As a consequence, at least in principle, an Autonomous System that\n   uses
    a 2-octet Autonomous System number could use either 2-octet or\n   4-octet AS
    specific extended communities.  This is undesirable, as\n   both communities would
    be treated as different, even if they had the\n   same Sub-Type and Local Administrator
    values.\n   Therefore, for backward compatibility with existing deployments and\n
    \  to avoid inconsistencies between 2-octet and 4-octet specific\n   extended
    communities, Autonomous Systems that use 2-octet Autonomous\n   System numbers
    SHOULD use 2-octet AS specific extended communities\n   rather than 4-octet AS
    specific extended communities.\n"

  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a class of extended communities,
    called 4-octet\n   AS specific extended communities, for which the IANA has created
    and\n   will maintain a registry entitled Four-octet AS Specific Extended\n   Community.
    \ All the communities in this class are of extended Types.\n   Future assignments
    are to be made using the \"First Come First Served\"\n   policy defined in [RFC5226].
    \ The Type values for the transitive\n   communities of the 4-octet AS specific
    extended community class are\n   0x0200-0x02ff; for the non-transitive communities
    of that class, they\n   are 0x4200-0x42ff.  Assignments consist of a name and
    the value.\n   This document makes the following assignments for the 4-octet AS\n
    \  specific extended community:\n      Name                                     Type
    Value\n      ----                                     ----------\n      four-octet
    AS specific Route Target       0x0202\n      four-octet AS specific Route Origin

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not add new security issues.
    \ All the security\n   considerations for BGP extended communities apply here.
    \ At the time\n   that this document was written, there were significant efforts\n
    \  underway to improve the security properties of BGP.  For examples of\n   documents
    that have been produced up to this time of publication, see\n   [RFC4593] and
    [SIDR].\n   There is a potential serious issue if a malformed, optional\n   transitive
    attribute is received.  This issue and the steps to avoid\n   it are discussed
    in [OPT_TRANS].\n"
