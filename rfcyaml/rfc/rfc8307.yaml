  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5785] defines a path prefix, \"/.well-known\", that
    can be used by\n   well-known URIs.  It also contains an IANA registry for URI
    suffixes\n   to be used with this path prefix for forming well-known URIs.\n   In
    [RFC5785], this mechanism is specifically defined for the \"http\"\n   and \"https\"
    URI schemes (now defined in [RFC7230]).  Other URI\n   schemes such as \"coap\"
    and \"coaps\" [RFC7252] have since picked up\n   this mechanism, sharing the registry
    of URI suffixes with that for\n   HTTP(S).\n   [RFC6455], which defines the URI
    schemes defined for the WebSocket\n   Protocol, \"ws\" and \"wss\", does not define
    the use of well-known URIs\n   for these URI schemes.\n   The present memo formally
    updates [RFC6455] to extend the use of\n   [RFC5785] well-known URIs to the URI
    schemes \"ws\" and \"wss\".\n   Well-known URIs for \"ws\" and \"wss\" share the
    registry for URI\n   suffixes established by [RFC5785]; no change is necessitated
    by the\n   present memo in the registry or its IANA considerations.\n"

  title: 2.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The Security Considerations of [RFC5785] apply
    and need to be\n   considered for all well-known URIs.\n   It has always been
    possible to form \"ws\" and \"wss\" URIs in such a way\n   that they map to well-known
    HTTP(S) URIs when using the procedure in\n   Section 4 of [RFC6455]; no new security
    considerations are created by\n   now formally making the well-known URI mechanism
    available for \"ws\"\n   and \"wss\".\n   However, with well-known URIs becoming
    available for the WebSocket\n   Protocol, applications that want to define well-known
    URI suffixes\n   specifically for WebSocket use also need to consider whether
    the\n   resources becoming available under the equivalent HTTP(S) URI formed\n
    \  by Section 4 of [RFC6455] pose any information disclosure or other\n   security
    considerations.\n"
