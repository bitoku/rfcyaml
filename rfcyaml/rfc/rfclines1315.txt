Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing Frame Relay.
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
RFC 1156 which defines MIB I, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1213 defines MIB II, an evolution of MIB I based on implementation experience and new operational requirements.
RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Objects Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[7] defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language is used for this purpose.
However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is represented using the object type's syntax.
Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding
is how the object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.
The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
Format of Definitions Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [9,10].
For the purposes of understanding this document, Frame Relay is viewed as a multi access media, not as a group of point to point connections.
This model proposes that Frame Relay is a single interface to the network (physical connection) with many destinations or neighbors (virtual connections).
This view enables a network manager the ability to group all virtual connections with their corresponding physical connection thereby allowing simpler diagnostics and trouble shooting.
Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention in this MIB document.
These textual conventions enhance the readability of the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if appropriate.
It should be noted that the introduction of the these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed objects.
The use of these is merely an artifact of the explanatory method used.
Objects defined in terms of one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that define the primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.
The new data types are Index and DLCI.
Index refers to the range 1..ifNumber, and is used to establish the correspondence between ifEntries and Frame Relay Interfaces.
DLCI refers to the range 0..DLCINumber, and is used to refer to the valid Data Link Connection Indices.
DLCINumber is, by definition, the largest possible DLCI value possible under the configured Q.922 Address Format.
The MIB is composed of three groups, one defining the Data Link Connection Management Interface (DLCMI), one describing the Circuits, and a third describing errors.
During normal operation, Frame Relay virtual circuits will be added, deleted and change availability.
The occurrence of such changes is of interest to the network manager and therefore, one trap is defined, intended to be corollary to the SNMP
"Link Up" and "Link Down" traps.

Therefore, each of the entries   in the Standard MIB's Interface Table with an IfType of   Frame Relay represents a Q.922 interface.
