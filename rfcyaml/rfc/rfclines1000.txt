THE ORIGINS OF RFCS by Stephen D. Crocker
The DDN community now includes hundreds of nodes and thousands of users, but once it was all a gleam in Larry Roberts' eye.
While much of the development proceeded according to a grand plan, the design of the protocols and the creation of the RFCs was largely accidental.
The procurement of the ARPANET was initiated in the summer of 1968
Remember Vietnam, flower children, etc?
There had been prior experiments at various ARPA sites to link together computer systems, but this was the first version to explore packet switching on a grand scale.
("ARPA" didn't become "DARPA" until 1972.)
Unlike most of the ARPA/IPTO procurements of the day, this was a competitive procurement.
The contract called for four IMPs to be delivered to UCLA, SRI, UCSB and The University of Utah.
These sites were running a Sigma 7 with the SEX operating system, an SDS 940 with the Genie operating system, an IBM 360/75 with OS/MVT (or perhaps OS/MFT), and a DEC PDP 10 with the Tenex operating system.
Options existed for additional nodes if the first experiments were successful.
BBN won the procurement in December 1968, but that gets ahead of this story.
Part of the reason for selecting these four sites was these were existing ARPA computer science research contractors.
The precise usage of the ARPANET was not spelled out in advance, and the research community could be counted on to take some initiative.
If memory serves me correctly, Jeff Rulifson came from SRI, Ron Stoughton from UCSB, Steve Carr from Utah
and I came from UCLA.
(Apologies to anyone I've left out; records are inaccessible or lost at this point.)
At this point we knew only that the network was coming, but the precise details weren't known.
That first meeting was seminal.
We had lots of questions
how IMPs and hosts would be connected, what hosts would say to each other, and what applications would be supported.
No one had any answers, but the prospects seemed exciting.
We found ourselves imagining all kinds of possibilities   interactive graphics, cooperating processes, automatic data base query, electronic mail
but no one knew where to begin.
We weren't sure whether there was really room to think hard about these problems; surely someone from the east would be along by and by to bring the word.
But we did come to one conclusion: We ought to meet again.
Over the next several months, we managed to parlay that idea into a series of exchange meetings at each of our sites, thereby setting the most important precedent in protocol design.
The first few meetings were quite tenuous.
We had no official charter.
Most of us were graduate students and we expected that a professional crew would show up eventually to take over the problems we were dealing with.
Without clear definition of what the host IMP interface would look like, or even what functions the IMP would provide, we focused on exotic ideas.
We envisioned the possibility of application specific protocols, with code downloaded to user sites, and we took a crack at designing a language to support this.
The first version was known as DEL, for "Decode Encode Language" and a later version was called NIL, for "Network Interchange Language.
" When the IMP contract was finally let and BBN provided some definite information on the host IMP interface, all attention shifted to low level matters and the ambitious ideas for automatic downloading of code evaporated.
It was several years before ideas like remote procedure calls and typed objects reappeared.
In February of 1969 we met for the first time with BBN.
I don't think any of us were prepared for that meeting.
The BBN folks, led by Frank Heart, Bob Kahn, Severo Ornstein and Will Crowther, found themselves talking to a crew of graduate students they hadn't anticipated.
And we found ourselves talking to people whose first concern was how to get bits to flow quickly and reliably but hadn't   of course   spent any time considering the thirty or forty layers of protocol above the link level.
And while BBN didn't take over the protocol design process, we kept expecting that an official protocol design team would announce itself.
We had accumulated a few notes on the design of DEL and other matters, and we decided to put them together in a set of notes.
I remember having great fear that we would offend whomever the official protocol designers were, and I spent a sleepless night composing humble words for our notes.
The basic ground rules were that anyone could say anything and that nothing was official.
And to emphasize the point, I labeled the notes "Request for Comments.
I never dreamed these notes would distributed through the very medium we were discussing in these notes.
Over the spring and summer of 1969 we grappled with the detailed problems of protocol design.
Although we had a vision of the vast potential for intercomputer communication, designing usable protocols was another matter.
A custom hardware interface and custom intrusion into the operating system was going to be required for anything we designed, and we anticipated serious difficulty at each of the sites.
We looked for existing abstractions to use.
It would have been convenient if we could have made the network simply look like a tape drive to each host, but we knew that wouldn't do.
It was clear we needed to support remote login for interactive use   later known as Telnet
and we needed to move files from machine to machine.
We also knew that we needed a more fundamental point of view for building a larger array of protocols.
Unfortunately, operating systems of that era tended to view themselves as the center of the universe; symmetric cooperation did not fit into the concepts currently available within these operating systems.
And time was pressing: The first IMP was due to be delivered to UCLA September 1, 1969, and the rest were scheduled at monthly intervals.
At UCLA we scrambled to build a host IMP interface.
SDS, the builder of the Sigma 7, wanted many months and many dollars to do the job.
Mike Wingfield, another grad student at UCLA, stepped in and offered to get interface built in six weeks for a few thousand dollars.
He had a gorgeous, fully instrumented interface working in five and one half weeks.
I was in charge of the software, and we were naturally running a bit late.
September 1 was Labor Day, so I knew I had a couple of extra days to debug the software.
Moreover, I had heard BBN was having some timing troubles with the software, so I had some hope they'd miss the ship date.
And I figured that first some Honeywell people would install the hardware   IMPs were built out of Honeywell 516s in those days
and then BBN people would come in a few days later to shake down the software.
An easy couple of weeks of grace.
BBN fixed their timing trouble, air shipped the IMP, and it arrived on our loading dock on Saturday, August 30.
The second IMP was delivered to SRI at the beginning of October, and ARPA's interest was intense.
Larry Roberts and Barry Wessler came by for a visit on November 21, and we actually managed to demonstrate a Telnet like connection to SRI.
With the pressure to get something working and the general confusion as to how to achieve the high generality we all aspired to, we punted and defined the first set of protocols to include only Telnet and FTP functions.
In particular, only asymmetric, user server relationships were supported.
In December 1969, we met with Larry Roberts in Utah, and suffered our first direct experience with "redirection".
Larry made it abundantly clear that our first step was not big enough, and we went back to the drawing board.
Over the next few months we designed a symmetric host host protocol, and we defined an abstract implementation of the protocol known as the Network Control Program.
("NCP" later came to be used as the name for the protocol, but it originally meant the program within the operating system that managed connections.
The protocol itself was known blandly only as the host host protocol.)
Along with the basic host host protocol, we also envisioned a hierarchy of protocols, with Telnet, FTP and some splinter protocols as the first examples.
If we had only consulted the ancient mystics, we would have seen immediately that seven layers were required.
The initial experiment had been declared an immediate success and the network continued to grow.
More and more people started coming to meetings, and the Network Working Group began to take shape.
Working Group meetings started to have 50 and 100 people in attendance instead of the half dozen we had had in 1968 and early 1969.
We held one meeting in conjunction with the Spring Joint Computer Conference in Atlantic City in 1971.
In October 1971 we all convened at MIT for a major protocol "fly off".
Representatives from each site were on hand, and everyone tried to log in to everyone else's site.
With the exception of one site that was completely down, the matrix was almost completely filled in, and we had reached a major milestone in connectivity.
The rapid growth of the network and the working group also led to a large pile of RFCs.
When the 100th RFC was in sight, Peggy Karp took on the task of indexing them.
That seemed like a large task then, and we could have hardly anticipated seeing more than a 1000 RFCs several years later.
The network has the exceeded all estimates of its growth.
It has been transformed, extended, cloned, renamed and reimplemented.
But the RFCs march on.
Maybe I'll write a few words for RFC 10,000.

RFC 1000 Request for Comments Reference Guide
This document is a description of and a specification for the NETBLT protocol.
It is a revision of the specification published in RFC 969.
NETBLT (NETwork BLock Transfer) is a transport level protocol intended for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.
It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is designed to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.
Although NETBLT currently runs on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), it should be able to operate on top of any datagram protocol similar in function to IP.
This document is published for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.
The proposal may change and certain parts of the protocol have not yet been specified; implementation of this document is therefore not advised.
This memo is an official status report on the network numbers used in the Internet community.
As of 1 Mar 87 the Network Information Center (NIC) at SRI International has assumed responsibility for assignment of Network Numbers and Autonomous System Numbers.
This RFC documents the current assignments of these numbers at the time of this transfer of responsibility.
This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.
Hosts and gateways on the DARPA Internet that choose to implement a remote statistics monitoring facility may use this protocol to send statistics data upon request to a monitoring center or debugging host.
The set of standards covers the services and protocols required to achieve such interconnection.
This Protocol is positioned with respect to other related standards by the layers defined in the Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection (ISO 7498) and by the structure defined in the Internal Organization of the Network Layer (DIS 8648).
In particular, it is a protocol of the Network Layer.
This Protocol permits End Systems and Intermediate Systems to exchange configuration and routing information to facilitate the operation of the routing and relaying functions of the Network Layer.
Final Text of DIS 8473, Protocol for Providing the Connectionless Mode Network Service
This Protocol Standard is one of a set of International Standards produced to facilitate the interconnection of open systems.
The set of standards covers the services and protocols required to achieve such interconnection.
This Protocol Standard is positioned with respect to other related standards by the layers defined in the Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection (ISO 7498).
In particular, it is a protocol of the Network Layer.
This Protocol may be used between network entities in end systems or in Network Layer relay systems (or both).
It provides the Connectionless mode Network Service as defined in Addendum 1 to the Network Service Definition Covering Connectionless mode Transmission (ISO 8348/AD1).
This document is a discussion of the PCMAIL workstation based distributed mail system.
It is a revision of the design published in NIC RFC 984.
The revision is based on discussion and comments from a variety of sources, as well as further research into the design of interactive PCMAIL clients and the use of client code on machines other than IBM PCs.
As this design may change, implementation of this document is not advised.
On Communication Support for Fault Tolerant Process Groups
This memo describes a collection of multicast communication primitives integrated with a mechanism for handling process failure and recovery.
Here, we argue that the form of "best effort" reliability provided by host groups may not address the requirements of those researchers who are building fault tolerant software.
Our basic premise is that reliable handling of failures, recoveries, and dynamic process migration are important aspects of programming in distributed environments, and that communication support that provides unpredictable behavior in the presence of such events places an unacceptable burden of complexity on higher level application software.
This complexity does not arise when using the fault tolerant process group alternative.
This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols used in the Internet.
Comments indicate any revisions or changes planned.
This memo is an official status report on the numbers used in protocols in the ARPA Internet community.
This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
This memo is an official status report on the numbers used in protocols in the ARPA Internet community.
This memo obsoletes RFCs 960, 943, 923, 900, 870, 820, 790, 776, 770, 762, 758, 755, 750, 739, 717, 604, 503, 433, 349, 322, 317, 204, 179, 175, 167.
I:  Message Encipherment and Authentication Procedures
This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the Internet community and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
This RFC is the outgrowth of a series of IAB Privacy Task Force meetings and of internal working papers distributed for those meetings.
This RFC defines message encipherment and authentication procedures, as the initial phase of an effort to provide privacy enhancement services for electronic mail transfer in the Internet.
It is intended that the procedures defined here be compatible with a wide range of key management approaches, including both conventional (symmetric) and public key (asymmetric) approaches for encryption of data encrypting keys.
Use of conventional cryptography for message text encryption and/or authentication is anticipated.
Privacy enhancement services (confidentiality, authentication, and message integrity assurance) are offered through the use of end to  end cryptography between originator and recipient User Agent processes, with no special processing requirements imposed on the Message Transfer System at endpoints or at intermediate relay sites.
This approach allows privacy enhancement facilities to be incorporated on a site by site or user by user basis without impact on other Internet entities.
Interoperability among heterogeneous components and mail transport facilities is supported.
This memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation of the Internet Protocol (IP) to support internetwork multicasting.
This specification supersedes that given in RFC 966, and constitutes a proposed protocol standard for IP multicasting in the ARPA Internet.
The reader is directed to RFC 966 for a discussion of the motivation and rationale behind the multicasting extension specified here.
The X.400 series of protocols have been defined by CCITT to provide an Interpersonal Messaging Service (IPMS), making use of a store and forward Message Transfer Service.
It is expected that this standard will be implemented very widely.
This document describes a set of mappings which will enable interworking between systems operating the X.400 protocols and systems using RFC 822 mail protocol or protocols derived from RFC 822.
This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
This RFC suggests a method to allow the existing IP addressing, including the IP protocol field, to be used for the ISO Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP).
This is a draft solution to one of the problems inherent in the use of "ISO grams" in the DoD Internet.
Related issues will be discussed in subsequent RFCs.
This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
This RFC summarizes the requirements for gateways to be used on networks supporting the DARPA Internet protocols.
While it applies specifically to the National Science Foundation research programs, the requirements are stated in a general context and are believed applicable throughout the Internet community.
The purpose of this document is to present guidance for vendors offering products that might be used or adapted for use in an Internet application.
It enumerates the protocols required and gives references to RFCs and other documents describing the current specification.
Suggestions and comments on this document are welcomed and can be sent to Dave Mills (Mills@D.ISI.EDU) or Dave Farber (Farber@HUEY.UDEL.EDU).
A Distributed Mail System for Personal Computers
This document is a preliminary discussion of the design of a personal computer based distributed mail system.
Pcmail is a distributed mail system that provides mail service to an arbitrary number of users, each of which owns one or more personal computers (PCs).
The system is divided into two halves.
The first consists of a single entity called the "repository".
The repository is a storage center for incoming mail.
Mail for a Pcmail user can arrive externally from the Internet or internally from other repository users.
The repository also maintains a stable copy of each user's mail state.
The repository is therefore typically a computer with a large amount of disk storage.
It is published for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.
As the proposal may change, implementation of this document is not advised.
This memo describes a proposed protocol standard for the ARPA Internet community.
The CCITT and the ISO have defined various session, presentation, and application recommendations which have been adopted by the international community and numerous vendors.
To the largest extent possible, it is desirable to offer these higher level services directly to the ARPA Internet, without disrupting existing facilities.
This permits users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications which previously were not available in the ARPA Internet.
The intention is that hosts within the ARPA Internet that choose to implement ISO TSAP services on top of the TCP be expected to adopt and implement this standard.
Suggestions for improvement are encouraged.
This RFC is a draft working document of the ANSI "Guidelines for the Specification of the Structure of the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of the ISO Standard NSAP Address".
It provides guidance to private address administration authorities on preferred formats and semantics for the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of an NSAP address.
This RFC specifies the way in which the DSP may be constructed so as to facilitate efficient address assignment.
This RFC is for informational purposes only and its distribution is unlimited and does not specify a standard of the ARPA Internet.
This document introduces wiretap algorithms, a class of experimental, multiple routing algorithms that compute quasi optimum routes for stations sharing a packet radio broadcast channel.
The primary route (a minimum distance path), and additional paths ordered by distance, which serve as alternate routes should the primary route fail, are computed.
This prototype is presented as an example of a class of routing algorithms and data base management techniques that may find wider application in the Internet community.
Discussions and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.
This RFC indicates how to obtain various protocol documents used in the DARPA research community.
Included is an overview of the new 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook and available sources for obtaining related documents (such as DOD, ISO, and CCITT).
This memo is an updated version of BBN Report 5775, "End to End Functional Specification".
It describes important changes to the functionality of the interface between a host and the PSN (Packet Switch Node), and should be carefully reviewed by anyone involved in supporting a host on either the ARPANET or MILNET.
The new End to End Protocol (EE) is being developed in order to correct a number of deficiencies in the old End to End Protocol, to improve its performance and overall throughput, and to better equip the Packet Switch Node (also known as the IMP) to support its current and anticipated host population.
Voice File Interchange Protocol (VFIP)
The purpose of the Voice File Interchange Protocol (VFIP) is to permit the interchange of various types of speech files between different systems in the ARPA Internet community.
Suggestions for improvement are encouraged.
NNTP is designed so that news articles are stored in a central database allowing a subscriber to select only those items he wishes to read.
Indexing, cross referencing, and expiration of aged messages are also provided.
This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
This document defines the standard format for the transmission of mail messages between computers in the UUCP Project.
It does not however, address the format for storage of messages on one machine, nor the lower level transport mechanisms used to get the date from one machine to the next.
It represents a standard for conformance by hosts in the UUCP zone.
This RFC proposes enhancements to the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) to support a simple, multiple level routing capability while preserving the robustness features of the current EGP model.
The enhancements generalize the concept of core system to include multiple communities of autonomous systems, called autonomous confederations.
Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
This RFC presents a description of how mail systems on the Internet are expected to route messages based on information from the domain system.
This involves a discussion of how mailers interpret MX RRs, which are used for message routing.
This RFC documents updates to
Domain Name System specifications RFC 882 and RFC 883, suggests some operational guidelines, and discusses some experiences and problem areas in the present system.
This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.
The Password Generator Service (PWDGEN) provides a set of six randomly generated eight character "words" with a reasonable level of pronounceability, using a multi level algorithm.
Hosts on the ARPA Internet that choose to implement a password generator service are expected to adopt and implement this standard.
This RFC is a comparison of several data representation standards that are currently in use.
The standards discussed are the CCITT X.409 recommendation, the NBS Computer Based Message System (CBMS) standard, DARPA Multimedia Mail system, the Courier remote procedure call protocol, and the SUN Remote Procedure Call package.
No proposals in this document are intended as standards for the ARPA Internet at this time.
Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate approach to a data representation standard, leading eventually to the adoption of an ARPA Internet standard.
On Packet Switches With Infinite Storage
The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular problem in the ARPA Internet and possible methods of solution.
Most prior work on congestion in datagram systems focuses on buffer management.
In this memo, the case of a packet switch with infinite storage is considered.
Such a packet switch can never run out of buffers.
It can, however, still become congested.
The meaning of congestion in an infinite storage system is explored.
An unexpected result is found that shows a datagram network with infinite storage, first in first out queuing, at least two packet switches, and a finite packet lifetime will, under overload, drop all packets.
By attacking the problem of congestion for the infinite storage case, new solutions applicable to switches with finite storage may be found.
No proposed solutions this document are intended as standards for the ARPA Internet at this time.
A Bulk Data Transfer Protocol
This RFC has been replaced by RFC 998.
This is a preliminary discussion of the Network Block Transfer (NETBLT) protocol.
NETBLT is intended for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.
It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is structured to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.
This description is published for discussion and comment, and does not constitute a standard.
As the proposal may change, implementation of this document is not advised.
Before Start up' This memo discusses problems that arise and debugging techniques used in bringing a new network into operation.
This RFC proposes a new set of RFCs on how the networking code is integrated with various operating systems.
It appears that this topic has not received enough exposure in the literature.
Comments and suggestions are encouraged.
This RFC defines a model of service for Internet multicasting and proposes an extension to the Internet Protocol (IP) to support such a multicast service.
Discussion and suggestions for improvements are requested.
This RFC describes the requirements for a graphical format on which to base a graphical on line communication protocol, and proposes an Interactive Graphical Communication Format using the GKSM session metafile.
We hope this contribution will encourage the discussion of multimedia data exchange and the proposal of solutions.
Some Problems with the Specification of the Military Standard Transmission Control Protocol
This note points out three errors with this specification.
This note also proposes solutions to these problems.
Some Problems with the Specification of the Military Standard Internet Protocol
The purpose of this RFC is to provide helpful information on the Military Standard Internet Protocol (MIL STD 1777) so that one can obtain a reliable implementation of this protocol.
This paper points out several problems in this specification.
This note also proposes solutions to these problems.
This memo is in response to Bob Braden's call for a transaction oriented protocol (RFC 955), and continues the discussion of a possible transaction oriented transport protocol.
This memo does not propose a standard.
This RFC has been replaced by RFC 991.
This RFC has been replaced by RFCs 997 and 990.
This memo is the official specification of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for the DARPA Internet community.
The primary intent is to clarify and correct the documentation of the FTP specification, not to change the protocol.
The following new optional commands are included in this edition of the specification:  Change to Parent Directory (CDUP), Structure Mount (SMNT), Store Unique (STOU), Remove Directory (RMD), Make Directory (MKD), Print Directory (PWD), and System (SYST).
Note that this specification is compatible with the previous edition.
This document describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a protocol for synchronizing a set of network clocks using a set of distributed clients and servers.
NTP is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless transport mechanism.
This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
One of the services frequently neglected in computer network design
is a high quality, time of day clock capable of generating accurate timestamps with small errors compared to one way network delays.
Such a service would be useful for tracing the progress of complex transactions, synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring network performance and isolating problems.
In this memo, one such clock service design will be described and its performance assessed.
This design has been incorporated as an integral part of the network routing and control protocols of the Distributed Computer Network (DCnet) architecture.
This RFC discussed clock synchronization algorithms for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
The recent interest within the Internet community in determining accurate time from a set of mutually suspicious network clocks has been prompted by several occasions in which errors were found in usually reliable, accurate clock servers after thunderstorms which disrupted their power supply.
To these sources of error should be added those due to malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator mistakes, as well as random errors in the mechanism used to set and synchronize clocks.
This report suggests a stochastic model and algorithms for computing a good estimator from time offset samples measured between clocks connected via network links.
Included in this report are descriptions of certain experiments which give an indication of the effectiveness of the algorithms.
The DoD Internet Protocol Suite includes two alternative transport service protocols, TCP and UDP, which provide virtual circuit and datagram service, respectively.
These two protocols represent points in the space of possible transport service attributes which are quite "far apart".
We will see that the communication needs for these applications fall into the gap "between" TCP and UDP
neither protocol is very appropriate.

This RFC describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which allows a diskless client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a server host, and the name of a file to be loaded into memory and executed.
The bootstrap operation can be thought of as consisting of TWO PHASES.
This RFC describes the first phase, which could be labeled `address determination and bootfile selection'.
After this address and filename information is obtained, control passes to the second phase of the bootstrap where a file transfer occurs.
The file transfer will typically use the TFTP protocol, since it is intended that both phases reside in PROM on the client.
However BOOTP could also work with other protocols such as SFTP or FTP.
This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
This memo discusses the utility of "subnets" of Internet networks, which are logically visible sub sections of a single Internet network.
For administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to divide one Internet network into RFC 1000 Request for Comments Reference Guide
August 1987 several subnets, instead of acquiring a set of Internet network numbers.
This memo specifies procedures for the use of subnets.
These procedures are for hosts (e.g., workstations).
The procedures used in and between subnet gateways are not fully described.
Important motivation and background information for a subnetting standard is provided in RFC 940.
This RFC specifies a protocol for the ARPA Internet community.
If subnetting is implemented it is strongly recommended that these procedures be followed.
There are various contexts in which it would be desirable to have an FTP command that had the effect of the present STOR but rather than requiring the sender to specify a file name istead
caused the resultant file to have a unique name relative to the current directory.

Toward an Internet Standard Scheme for Subnetting Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected to the Internet via a gateway.
The details of the internal connectivity are of little interest to the rest of the Internet.
One way of organizing these local complexes of links is to use the same strategy as the Internet uses to organize networks, that is, to declare each link to be an entity (like a network) and to interconnect the links with devices that perform routing functions (like gateways).
This general scheme is called subnetting, the individual links are called subnets, and the connecting devices are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).
This RFC discusses standardizing the protocol used in subnetted environments in the ARPA Internet.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Another Internet Subnet Addressing Scheme
There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use of a single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical networks under common administration which are reachable from the rest of the Internet by a common route.
Such schemes allow a simplified view of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and gateways outside of this collection.
They allow the complexity of the number and  type of these networks, and routing to them, to be localized.
Additions and changes in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no interruption of service, due to slow propagation of routing and other information outside of the local environment.
These schemes also simplify the administration of the network, as changes do not require allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed.
This proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been in use at the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984.
This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
This RFC discusses protocols proposed recently in RFCs 914 and 916, and suggests a proposed protocol that could meet the same needs addressed in those memos.
The stated need is reliable communication between two programs over a full duplex, point to point communication link, and in particular the RFCs address the need for such communication over an asynchronous link at relatively low speeds.
The suggested protocol uses the methods of existing national and international data link layer standards.
This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
This memo concerns itself with message forwarding.
Although this is useful for transfer of past correspondence to new recipients, without a decapsulation process (which this memo terms "bursting"), the forwarded messages are of little use to the recipients because they can not be distributed, forwarded, replied to, or otherwise processed as separate individual messages.
In order to burst a message it is necessary to know how the component messages were encapsulated in the draft.
At present there is no unambiguous standard for interest group digests.

This proposed option would allow a Server Telnet to send a banner to a User Telnet so that this banner would be displayed on the workstation screen independently of the application software running in the Server Telnet.
This RFC proposes an alternative addressing scheme for subnets which, in most cases, requires no modification to host software whatsoever.
The drawbacks of this scheme are that the total number of subnets in any one network are limited, and that modification is required to all gateways.

Proposed Host Front End Protocol
The Host Front End Protocol introduced in RFC 928 is described in detail in this memo.
The first order of business is to declare that THIS IS A PROPOSAL, NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the second order of business is to request that any readers of these documents who are able to do test implementations (a) do so and (b) coordinate their efforts with the author.
This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
The broad outline of the Host Front End Protocol introduced here and described in RFC 929 is the result of the deliberations of a number of experienced H FP designers, who sat as a committee of the DoD Protocol Standards Technical Panel.
It is the intent of the designers that the protocol be subjected to multiple test implementations and probable iteration before being agreed upon as any sort of "standard".
Therefore, the first order of business is to declare that THIS IS A PROPOSAL, NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the second order of business is to request that any readers of these documents who are able to do test implementations (a) do so and (b) coordinate their efforts with the author.

This document is distributed as an RFC for information only.
It does not specify a standard for the ARPA Internet.
The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as one Internet network has generated some interest and concern.
It is inappropriate to give each LAN within a site a distinct ARPA Internet network number.
It is desirable to hide the details of the interconnections between the LANs within a site from people, gateways, and hosts outside the site.
The question arises on how to best do this, and even how to do it at all.
In RFC 917, Jeffery Mogul makes a case for the use of "explicit subnets" in a multi LAN environment.
The explicit subnet scheme is a call to recursively apply the mechanisms
the ARPA Internet uses to manage networks to the problem of managing LANs within one network.
In this note I urge another approach: the use of "transparent subnets" supported by a multi LAN extension of the Address Resolution Protocol.

HAP is an experimental protocol, and will undergo further revision as new capabilities are added and/or different satellite networks are suported.
Implementations of HAP should be performed in coordination with satellite network development and operations personnel.

The tests were run on 15 Feb 83 from ISI VAXA.ARPA.
Survey of 18 February 1983
This survey determines how many hosts are able to respond to Telnet connections from a user at a class C site.
This requires, in addition to IP and TCP, participation in gateway routing via ICMP and handling of Class C addresses.

This RFC is distributed to inform the ARPA Internet community of the activities of the IFIP technical committee on Data Communications, and to encourage participation in those activities.
This RFC is proposed to establish a standard for Gateway to Gateway procedures that allow the Gateways to be mutually suspicious.
This document is a DRAFT for that standard.
Your comments are strongly encouraged.
The purpose of this RFC is to present a method of Converting Protocol Addresses (e.g., IP addresses) to Local Network Addresses (e.g., Ethernet addresses).
This is an issue of general concern in the ARPA Internet Community at this time.
The method proposed here is presented for your consideration and comment.
This is not the specification of an ARPA Internet Standard.
This RFC is intended to clarify the status of RFCs and to provide some guidance for the authors of RFCs in the future.
It is in a sense a specification for RFCs.
The Cronus Virtual Local Network
The purpose of this note is to describe the CRONUS Virtual Local Network, especially the addressing related features.
These features include a method for mapping between Internet Addresses and Local Network addresses.
This is a topic of current concern in the ARPA Internet community.
This is not a specification of an ARPA Internet Standard.
This RFC is a status report on the Internet Gateway developed by BBN.
It describes the Internet Gateway as of September 1982.
This memo presents detailed descriptions of message formats and gateway procedures, however, this is not an implementation specification, and such details are subject to change.
This document revises the specifications in RFC 733, in order to serve the needs of the larger and more complex ARPA Internet.
Some of RFC 733's features failed to gain adequate acceptance.
In order to simplify the standard and the software that follows it, these features have been removed.
A different addressing scheme is used, to handle the case of internetwork mail; and the concept of re transmission has been introduced.
Obsoletes RFC 733, NIC 41952.
The objective of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is to transfer mail reliably and efficiently.
SMTP is independent of the particular transmission subsystem and requires only a reliable ordered data stream channel.
Obsoletes RFCs 788, 780, 772.
This RFC is is replaced by RFCs 997 and 990.

This RFC describes implementation strategies to deal with two mechanisms in TCP, the window and the acknowledgement.
It also presents a particular set of algorithms which have received testing in the field, and which appear to work properly with each other.
With more experience, these algorithms may become part of the formal specification, until such time their use is recommended.
This RFC gives a description of what the NICNAME/WHOIS Server is and how to access it.
the corresponding Identification Data Base provides online directory look up equivalent to the ARPANET Directory.
RFC 1000 Request for Comments Reference Guide
This RFC gives a description of what the Hostnames Server is and how to access it.
The function of this particular server is to deliver machine readable name/address information describing networks, gateways, hosts, and eventually domains, within the Internet environment.
In addition to host name to host address translation and selected protocol information, we have also included network and gateway name to address correspondence, and host operating system information.
This RFC obsoletes the host table described in RFC 608.
This RFC describes the features of the computerised facsimile system developed in the Department of Computer Science at UCL.
First its functions are considered and the related experimental work are reported.

This RFC is a very belated attempt to document a meeting that was held three years earlier to discuss the state of computer mail in the ARPA community and to reach some conclusions to guide the further development of computer mail systems such that a coherent total mail service would continue to be provided.
This RFC consists of notes from a meeting held at USC/Information Sciences Institute on the 12th of January to discuss common interests in multimedia computer mail issues and to agree on some specific initial experiments.
This RFC is replaced by RFC 841.
This RFC consists of notes from a meeting that was held at USC/Information Sciences Institute on 11 January 1982, to discuss addressing issues in computer mail.
The major conclusion reached at the meeting is to extend the "username@hostname" mailbox format to "username@host.domain", where the domain itself can be further structured.
This is the CCITT standard for group 3 facsimile encoding.
This is useful for data compression of bit map data.
The first part of this RFC describes in detail the Dacom 450 data compression algorithms and is an update and correction to an earlier memorandum.
The second part of this RFC describes briefly the Dacom 500 data compression algorithm as used by the INTELPOST electronic mail network under development by the US Postal Service and several foreign administrators.
The ARPANET 1822L Host Access Protocol
This document proposed two major changes to the current ARPANET host access protocol.
The first change will allow hosts to use logical addressing (i.e., host addresses that are independent of their physical location on the ARPANET) to communicate with each other, and the second will allow a host to shorten the amount of time that it may be blocked by its IMP after it presents a message to the network (currently, the IMP can block further input from a host for up to 15 seconds).
See RFCs 852 and 851.
This RFC discusses the conversion of hosts from NCP to TCP.
And making available the principle services:  Telnet, File Transfer, and Mail.
