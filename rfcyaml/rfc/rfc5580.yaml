  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines attributes within RADIUS and Diameter
    that can\n   be used to convey location-related information within authentication\n
    \  and accounting exchanges.\n   Location information may be useful in a number
    of scenarios.\n   Wireless networks (including wireless LAN) are being deployed
    in\n   public places such as airports, hotels, shopping malls, and coffee\n   shops
    by a diverse set of operators such as cellular network\n   operators, Wireless
    Internet Service Providers (WISPs), and fixed\n   broadband operators.  In these
    situations, the home network may need\n   to know the location of the user in
    order to enable location-aware\n   billing, location-aware authorization, or other
    location-aware\n   services.  Location information can also prove useful in other\n
    \  situations (such as wired networks) where operator-network ownership\n   and
    location information may be needed by the home network.\n   In order to preserve
    user privacy, location information needs to be\n   protected against unauthorized
    access and distribution.  Requirements\n   for access to location information
    are defined in [RFC3693].  The\n   model includes a Location Generator (LG) that
    creates location\n   information, a Location Server (LS) that authorizes access
    to\n   location information, a Location Recipient (LR) that requests and\n   receives
    information, and a Rule Maker (RM) that provides\n   authorization policies to
    the LS, which enforces access-control\n   policies on requests to location information.
    \ In Appendix A, the\n   requirements for a GEOPRIV using protocol [RFC3693] are
    compared to\n   the functionality provided by this document.\n"

    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n   RADIUS-specific
    terminology is borrowed from [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].\n   Terminology related

    how location information is conveyed in\n   RADIUS.  In describing the usage scenarios,
    we assume that privacy\n   policies allow location to be conveyed in RADIUS; however,
    as noted\n   in Section 6, similar exchanges can also take place within Diameter.\n
    \  Privacy issues are discussed in Section 7.2.\n"

    - "3.1.  Location Delivery Based on Out-of-Band Agreements\n   Figure 1 shows
      an example message flow for delivering location\n   information during the network-access
      authentication and\n   authorization procedure.  Upon a network-authentication
      request from\n   an access-network client, the Network Access Server (NAS) submits
      a\n   RADIUS Access-Request message that contains Location-Information\n   Attributes
      among other required attributes.  In this scenario,\n   location information
      is attached to the Access-Request message\n   without an explicit request from
      the RADIUS server.  Note that such\n   an approach with a prior agreement between
      the RADIUS client and the\n   RADIUS server is only applicable in certain environments,
      such as in\n   situations where the RADIUS client and server are within the
      same\n   administrative domain.  The Basic-Location-Policy-Rules Attribute is\n
      \  populated based on the defaults described in Section 4.4, unless it\n   has

    - "3.2.  Location Delivery Based on Initial Request\n   If the RADIUS client provides
      a Location-Capable Attribute in the\n   Access-Request, then the RADIUS server
      MAY request location\n   information from the RADIUS client if it requires that
      information\n   for authorization and if location information was not provided
      in the\n   Access-Request.  This exchange is shown in Figure 2.  The inclusion\n
      \  of the Location-Capable Attribute in an Access-Request message\n   indicates
      that the NAS is capable of providing location data in\n   response to an Access-Challenge.
      \ The subsequent Access-Challenge\n   message sent from the RADIUS server to
      the NAS provides a hint\n   regarding the type of desired Location-Information
      Attributes.  The\n   NAS treats the Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and Extended-Location-\n
      \  Policy-Rules Attributes as opaque data (e.g., it echoes these rules\n   provided
      by the server within the Access-Challenge back in the\n   Access-Request).  In
      the shown message flow, the location attributes\n   are then provided in the
      subsequent Access-Request message.  When\n   evaluating this Access-Request
      message, the authorization procedure\n   at the RADIUS server might be based
      on a number of criteria,\n   including the newly defined attributes listed in
      Section 4.\n   +---------+             +---------+                       +---------+\n

    - "3.3.  Location Delivery Based on Mid-Session Request\n   The on-demand, mid-session
      location-delivery method utilizes the\n   Change-of-Authorization Request (CoA-Request)
      message and the CoA-NAK\n   (CoA-Negative Acknowledgement), defined in [RFC5176].
      \ At any time\n   during the session, the Dynamic Authorization Client MAY send
      a CoA-\n   Request containing session-identification attributes to the NAS\n
      \  (i.e., Dynamic Authorization Server).\n   In order to enable the on-demand,
      mid-session location-delivery\n   method, the RADIUS server MUST return an instance
      of the Requested-\n   Location-Info Attribute with the 'FUTURE_REQUESTS' flag
      set and\n   instances of the Basic-Location-Policy-Rules and Extended-Location-\n
      \  Policy-Rules Attributes in the Access-Accept message for the session.\n   Upon
      receipt of a CoA-Request message containing a Service-Type\n   Attribute with
      value \"Authorize Only\" for the same session, the NAS\n   MUST include location
      information and echo the previously received\n   Basic-Location-Policy-Rules
      and Extended-Location-Policy-Rules\n   Attributes in the subsequent Access-Request
      message.\n   Upon receiving the Access-Request message containing the Service-Type\n
      \  Attribute with a value of Authorize-Only from the NAS, the RADIUS\n   server
      responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject\n   message.\n   The
      use of dynamic authorization [RFC5176] is necessary when location\n   information
      is needed on-demand and cannot be obtained from\n   accounting information in
      a timely fashion.\n   Figure 3 shows the above-described approach graphically.\n

      with IANA (see Section 8.1) and must be associated with an\n   organization
      responsible for managing the namespace.\n   TADIG ('0' (0x30)):\n      This

      Account Data Interchange Group (TADIG) codes, as\n      defined in [GSM].  TADIG
      codes are assigned by the TADIG Working\n      Group within the Global System
      for Mobile Communications (GSM)\n      Association.  The TADIG code consists
      of two fields, with a total\n      length of five ASCII characters consisting
      of a three-character\n      country code and a two-character alphanumeric operator
      (or\n      company) ID.\n   REALM ('1' (0x31)):\n      The REALM operator namespace
      can be used to indicate operator\n      names based on any registered domain
      name.  Such names are\n      required to be unique, and the rights to use a
      given realm name\n      are obtained coincident with acquiring the rights to
      use a\n      particular Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  Since this\n      operator
      is limited to ASCII, any registered domain name that\n      contains non-ASCII
      characters must be converted to ASCII.  The\n      Punycode encoding [RFC3492]
      is used for this purpose.\n   E212 ('2' (0x32)):\n      The E212 namespace can
      be used to indicate operator names based on\n      the Mobile Country Code (MCC)
      and Mobile Network Code (MNC)\n      defined in [ITU212].  The MCC/MNC values
      are assigned by the\n      Telecommunications Standardization Bureau (TSB) within
      the ITU-T\n      and by designated administrators in different countries.  The
      E212\n      value consists of three ASCII digits containing the MCC, followed\n
      \     by two or three ASCII digits containing the MNC.\n   ICC ('3' (0x33)):\n
      \     The ICC namespace can be used to indicate operator names based on\n      International
      Telecommunication Union (ITU) Carrier Codes (ICC)\n      defined in [ITU1400].
      \ ICC values are assigned by national\n      regulatory authorities and are
      coordinated by the\n      Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) within
      the ITU\n      Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T).  When using
      the\n      ICC namespace, the attribute consists of three uppercase ASCII\n
      \     characters containing a three-letter alphabetic country code, as\n      defined
      in [ISO], followed by one to six uppercase alphanumeric\n      ASCII characters

      allows the RADIUS server to\n   indicate which location information about which
      entity it wants to\n   receive.  The latter aspect refers to the entities that
      are indicated\n   in the Entity field of the Location-Information Attribute.\n
      \  The Requested-Location-Info Attribute MAY be sent in an Access-\n   Accept,
      Access-Challenge, or Change-of-Authorization packet.\n   If the RADIUS server
      wants to dynamically decide on a per-request\n   basis to ask for location information
      from the RADIUS client, then\n   the following cases need to be differentiated.
      \ If the RADIUS client\n   and the RADIUS server have agreed out-of-band to
      mandate the transfer\n   of location information for every network-access authentication\n
      \  request, then the processing listed below is not applicable.\n   o  If the
      RADIUS server requires location information for computing\n      the authorization
      decision and the RADIUS client does not provide\n      it with the Access-Request
      message, then the Requested-Location-\n      Info Attribute is attached to the
      Access-Challenge with a hint\n      about what is required.\n   o  If the RADIUS
      server does not receive the requested information in\n      response to the
      Access-Challenge (including the Requested-\n      Location-Info Attribute),
      then the RADIUS server may respond with\n      an Access-Reject message with
      an Error-Cause Attribute (including\n      the \"Location-Info-Required\" value).\n
      \  o  If the RADIUS server would like location information in the\n      Accounting-Request
      message but does not require it for computing\n      an authorization decision,
      then the Access-Accept message MUST\n      include a Required-Info Attribute.
      \ This is typically the case\n      when location information is used only for
      billing.  The RADIUS\n      client SHOULD attach location information, if available,
      to the\n      Accounting-Request (unless authorization policies dictate\n      something
      different).\n   If the RADIUS server does not send a Requested-Location-Info\n
      \  Attribute, then the RADIUS client MUST NOT attach location\n   information
      to messages towards the RADIUS server.  The user's\n   authorization policies,
      if available, MUST be consulted by the RADIUS\n   server before requesting location
      information delivery from the\n   RADIUS client.\n   Figure 6 shows a simple
      protocol exchange where the RADIUS server\n   indicates the desire to obtain
      location information, namely civic\n   location information of the user, to
      grant access.  Since the\n   Requested-Location-Info Attribute is attached to
      the Access-\n   Challenge, the RADIUS server indicates that location information

      \  Description:\n      The RADIUS server uses the Requested-Location-Info Attribute
      with\n      the value set to CIVIC_LOCATION to request specific location\n      information
      from the RADIUS client.  The numerical value\n      representing CIVIC_LOCATION

      refers to the location\n      profile defined in Section 4.3.1.\n   Numerical
      Value:\n      A numerical value of this token is '1'.\n   Name:\n      GEO_LOCATION\n
      \  Description:\n      The RADIUS server uses the Requested-Location-Info Attribute
      with\n      the value set to GEO_LOCATION to request specific location\n      information
      from the RADIUS client.  The numerical value\n      representing GEO_LOCATION
      requires the RADIUS client to attach\n      geospatial location attributes.
      \ GEO_LOCATION refers to the\n      location profile described in Section 4.3.2.\n
      \  Numerical Value:\n      A numerical value of this token is '2'.\n   Name:\n
      \     USERS_LOCATION\n   Description:\n      The numerical value representing
      USERS_LOCATION indicates that the\n      RADIUS client MUST send a Location-Information
      Attribute with the\n      Entity Attribute expressing the value of zero (0).
      \ Hence, there\n      is a one-to-one relationship between the USERS_LOCATION
      token and\n      the value of zero (0) of the Entity Attribute inside the Location-\n
      \     Information Attribute.  A value of zero indicates that the\n      location
      information in the Location-Information Attribute refers\n      to the user's
      client device.\n   Numerical Value:\n      A numerical value of this token is
      '4'.\n   Name:\n      NAS_LOCATION\n   Description:\n      The numerical value
      representing NAS_LOCATION indicates that the\n      RADIUS client MUST send
      a Location-Information Attribute that\n      contains location information with
      the Entity Attribute expressing\n      the value of one (1).  Hence, there is
      a one-to-one relationship\n      between the NAS_LOCATION token and the value
      of one (1) of the\n      Entity Attribute inside the Location-Information Attribute.
      \ A\n      value of one indicates that the location information in the\n      Location-Information
      Attribute refers to the RADIUS client.\n   Numerical Value:\n      A numerical
      value of this token is '8'.\n   Name:\n      FUTURE_REQUESTS\n   Description:\n
      \     The numerical value representing FUTURE_REQUESTS indicates that\n      the
      RADIUS client MUST provide future Access-Requests for the same\n      session
      with the same type of information as returned in the\n      initial Access-Request
      message.\n   Numerical Value:\n      A numerical value of this token is '16'.\n
      \  Name:\n      NONE\n   Description:\n      The RADIUS server uses this token
      to request that the RADIUS\n      client stop sending location information.\n
      \  Numerical Value:\n      A numerical value of this token is '32'.\n   If neither
      the NAS_LOCATION nor the USERS_LOCATION bit is set, then\n   per-default the
      location of the user's client device is returned (if\n   authorization policies
      allow it).  If both the NAS_LOCATION and the\n   USERS_LOCATION bits are set,
      then the returned location information\n   has to be put into separate attributes.
      \ If neither the\n   CIVIC_LOCATION nor the GEO_LOCATION bit is set in the Requested-\n
      \  Location-Info Attribute, then no location information is returned.\n   If
      both the CIVIC_LOCATION and the GEO_LOCATION bits are set, then\n   the location
      information has to be put into separate attributes.  The\n   value of NAS_LOCATION
      and USERS_LOCATION refers to the location\n   information requested via CIVIC_LOCATION
      and GEO_LOCATION.\n   As an example, if the bits for NAS_LOCATION, USERS_LOCATION,
      and\n   GEO_LOCATION are set, then the location information of the RADIUS\n
      \  client and the users' client device are returned in a geospatial-\n   location
      format.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   A number of security aspects are relevant for
    the distribution of\n   location information via RADIUS.  These aspects are discussed
    in\n   separate subsections.\n"
  - contents:
    - "7.1.  Communication Security\n   Requirements for the protection of a Location
      Object are defined in\n   [RFC3693] -- namely, mutual end-point authentication,
      data object\n   integrity, data object confidentiality, and replay protection.\n
      \  If no authentication, integrity, and replay protection between the\n   participating
      RADIUS entities is provided, then adversaries can spoof\n   and modify transmitted
      attributes.  Two security mechanisms are\n   proposed for RADIUS:\n   o  [RFC2865]
      proposes the usage of a static key that raised concerns\n      regarding the
      lack of dynamic key management.  At the time of\n      writing, work is ongoing
      to address some shortcomings of the\n      [RFC2865] attribute regarding security
      protection.\n   o  RADIUS over IPsec [RFC3579] enables the use of standard key-\n
      \     management mechanisms, such as Kerberized Internet Negotiation of\n      Keys
      (KINK), the Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE), and IKEv2\n      [RFC4306],
      to establish IPsec security associations.\n      Confidentiality protection
      MUST be used to prevent an eavesdropper\n      from gaining access to location
      information.  Confidentiality\n      protection is already present for other
      reasons in many\n      environments, such as for the transport of keying material
      in the\n      context of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication\n
      \     and authorization.  Hence, this requirement is, in many\n      environments,
      already fulfilled.  Mutual authentication MUST be\n      provided between neighboring
      RADIUS entities to prevent man-in-\n      the-middle attacks.  Since mutual
      authentication is already\n      required for key transport within RADIUS messages,
      it does not\n      represent a deployment obstacle.  Since IPsec protection
      is\n      already suggested as a mechanism to protect RADIUS, no additional\n
      \     considerations need to be addressed beyond those described in\n      [RFC3579].\n
      \  In case IPsec protection is not available for some reason and RADIUS-\n   specific
      security mechanisms have to be used, then the following\n   considerations apply.
      \ The Access-Request message is not integrity\n   protected.  This would allow
      an adversary to change the contents of\n   the Location Object or to insert,
      modify, and delete attributes or\n   individual fields.  To address these problems,
      the Message-\n   Authenticator (80) can be used to integrity protect the entire\n
      \  Access-Request packet.  The Message-Authenticator (80) is also\n   required
      when EAP is used and, hence, is supported by many modern\n   RADIUS servers.\n
      \  Access-Request packets including location attribute(s) without a\n   Message-Authenticator
      (80) Attribute SHOULD be silently discarded by\n   the RADIUS server.  A RADIUS
      server supporting location attributes\n   MUST calculate the correct value of
      the Message-Authenticator (80)\n   and MUST silently discard the packet if it
      does not match the value\n   sent.\n   Access-Accept messages, including location
      attribute(s), without a\n   Message-Authenticator (80) Attribute SHOULD be silently
      discarded by\n   the NAS.  An NAS supporting location attributes MUST calculate
      the\n   correct value of a received Message-Authenticator (80) and MUST\n   silently
      discard the packet if it does not match the value sent.\n   RADIUS and Diameter
      make some assumptions about the trust between\n   traversed RADIUS entities
      in the sense that object-level security is\n   not provided by either RADIUS
      or Diameter.  Hence, some trust has to\n   be placed on the RADIUS entities
      to behave according to the defined\n   rules.  Furthermore, the RADIUS protocol
      does not involve the user in\n   their protocol interaction except for tunneling
      authentication\n   information (such as EAP messages) through their infrastructure.\n
      \  RADIUS and Diameter have even become a de facto protocol for key\n   distribution
      for network-access authentication applications.  Hence,\n   in the past there
      were some concerns about the trust placed into the\n   infrastructure -- particularly
      from the security area -- when it\n   comes to keying.  The EAP keying infrastructure
      is described in\n   [RFC4282].\n"

      for the distribution of\n   location information within RADIUS.  Note also that
      it is possible\n   for the RADIUS server to obtain some amount of location information\n
      \  from the NAS identifier.  This document, however, describes\n   procedures
      to convey more accurate location information about the end\n   host and/or the
      network.  In a number of deployment environments,\n   location information about
      the network also reveals the current\n   location of the user with a certain
      degree of precision, depending on\n   the location-determination mechanism used,
      the update frequency, the\n   size of the network, and other factors, such as
      movement traces.\n   Three types of use cases have to be differentiated:\n   o
      \ The RADIUS server does not want to receive location information\n      from
      the RADIUS client.\n   o  In case there is an out-of-band agreement between

      information from\n      the NAS.\n"
    - contents:

        location\n      information is requested by the RADIUS server, then location\n
        \     information is not disclosed by the RADIUS client.\n   o  The RADIUS
        client MUST pass location information to other entities\n      (e.g., when
        information is written to a local database or to the\n      log files) only
        together with the policy rules.  The entity\n      receiving the location
        information (together with the policies)\n      MUST follow the guidance given
        with these rules.\n   o  A RADIUS client MUST include Basic-Location-Policy-Rules

        \     within an Access-Request packet.\n   o  NAS implementations supporting

      - "7.2.2.  RADIUS Server\n   The RADIUS server is a natural place for storing
        authorization\n   policies since the user typically has some sort of trust
        relationship\n   with the entity operating the RADIUS server.  Once the infrastructure\n
        \  is deployed and location-aware applications are available, there\n   might
        be a strong desire to use location information for other\n   purposes as well.\n
        \     The Common Policy framework [RFC4745] that was extended for\n      geolocation
        privacy [GEO-POLICY] is tailored for this purpose.\n      The Extensible Markup
        Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol\n      (XCAP) [RFC4825] gives
        users the ability to change their privacy\n      policies using a standardized
        protocol.  These policies are an\n      important tool for limiting further
        distribution of the user's\n      location to other location-based services.\n
        \  The RADIUS server MUST behave according to the following guidelines:\n
        \  o  The RADIUS server MUST attach available rules to the Access-\n      Accept,
        Access-Reject, or Access-Challenge message when the RADIUS\n      client is
        supposed to provide location information.\n   o  When location information
        is made available to other entities\n      (e.g., writing to stable storage
        for later billing processing),\n      then the RADIUS server MUST attach the

    - "7.3.  Identity Information and Location Information\n   For the envisioned
      usage scenarios, the identity of the user and his\n   device is tightly coupled
      to the transfer of location information.\n   If the identity can be determined
      by the visited network or RADIUS\n   brokers, then it is possible to correlate
      location information with a\n   particular user.  As such, it allows the visited
      network and brokers\n   to learn the movement patterns of users.\n   The user's
      identity can be \"leaked\" to the visited network or RADIUS\n   brokers in a
      number of ways:\n   o  The user's device may employ a fixed Media Access Control
      (MAC)\n      address or base its IP address on such an address.  This enables\n
      \     the correlation of the particular device to its different\n      locations.
      \ Techniques exist to avoid the use of an IP address\n      that is based on
      a MAC address [RFC4941].  Some link layers make\n      it possible to avoid
      MAC addresses or change them dynamically.\n   o  Network-access authentication
      procedures, such as the PPP\n      Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
      (CHAP) [RFC1994] or\n      EAP [RFC4187], may reveal the user's identity as
      a part of the\n      authentication procedure.  Techniques exist to avoid this
      problem\n      in EAP methods, for instance by employing private Network Access\n
      \     Identifiers (NAIs) [RFC4282] in the EAP Identity Response message\n      and
      by method-specific private identity exchanges in the EAP\n      method (e.g.,
      [RFC4187], [RFC5281], [PEAP], and [RFC5106]).\n      Support for identity privacy
      within CHAP is not available.\n   o  RADIUS may return information from the
      home network to the visited\n      one in a manner that makes it possible to
      either identify the user\n      or at least correlate his session with other
      sessions, such as the\n      use of static data in a Class Attribute [RFC2865]
      or in some\n      accounting attribute usage scenarios [RFC4372].\n   o  Mobility
      protocols may reveal some long-term identifier, such as a\n      home address.\n
      \  o  Application-layer protocols may reveal other permanent\n      identifiers.\n
      \  To prevent the correlation of identities with location information,\n   it
      is necessary to prevent leakage of identity information from all\n   sources,
      not just one.\n   Unfortunately, most users are not educated about the importance
      of\n   identity confidentiality, and some protocols lack support for\n   identity-privacy
      mechanisms.  This problem is made worse by the fact\n   that users may be unable
      to choose particular protocols, as the\n   choice is often dictated by the type
      of network operator they use,\n   the type of network they wish to access, the
      kind of equipment they\n   have, or the type of authentication method they are
      using.\n   A scenario where the user is attached to the home network is, from
      a\n   privacy point of view, simpler than a scenario where a user roams\n   into
      a visited network, since the NAS and the home RADIUS server are\n   in the same
      administrative domain.  No direct relationship between\n   the visited and the
      home network operator may be available, and some\n   RADIUS brokers need to
      be consulted.  With subscription-based network\n   access as used today, the
      user has a contractual relationship with\n   the home network provider that
      could (theoretically) allow higher\n   privacy considerations to be applied
      (including policy rules stored\n   at the home network itself, for the purpose
      of restricting further\n   distribution).\n   In many cases it is necessary
      to secure the transport of location\n   information along the RADIUS infrastructure.
      \ Mechanisms to achieve\n   this functionality are discussed in Section 7.1.\n"

      to Location Recipients by a Location Server in the visited\n   network.  Some
      identifier needs to be used as an index within the\n   location database.  One
      possible identifier is the Network Access\n   Identifier.  RFC 4282 [RFC4282]

    title: A.2.  Distribution of Location Information at the Visited Network
  - contents:
    - "A.3.  Requirements Matching\n   Section 7.1 of [RFC3693] details the requirements
      of a \"Location\n   Object\".  We discuss these requirements in the subsequent
      list.\n   Req. 1.  (Location Object generalities):\n      *  Regarding requirement
      1.1, the syntax and semantics of the\n         Location Object are taken from
      [RFC3825] and [RFC4776].  It is\n         furthermore possible to convert it
      to the format used in the\n         Geography Markup Language (GMLv3) [GMLv3],
      as used with PIDF-LO\n         [RFC4119].\n      *  Regarding requirement 1.2,
      a number of fields in the civic\n         location-information format are optional.\n
      \     *  Regarding requirement 1.3, the inclusion of type of place item\n         (CAtype
      29) used in the DHCP civic format gives a further\n         classification of
      the location.  This attribute can be seen as\n         an extension.\n      *
      \ Regarding requirement 1.4, this document does not define the\n         format
      of the location information.\n      *  Regarding requirement 1.5, location information
      is only sent\n         from the RADIUS client to the RADIUS server.\n      *
      \ Regarding requirement 1.6, the Location Object contains both\n         location
      information and privacy rules.  Location information\n         is described
      in Sections 4.2, 4.3.1, and 4.3.2.  The\n         corresponding privacy rules
      are detailed in Sections 4.4 and\n         4.5.\n      *  Regarding requirement
      1.7, the Location Object is usable in a\n         variety of protocols.  The
      format of the object is reused from\n         other documents, as detailed in
      Sections 4.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.2,\n         4.4, and 4.5.\n      *  Regarding requirement
      1.8, the encoding of the Location Object\n         has an emphasis on a lightweight
      encoding format to be used\n         with RADIUS.\n   Req. 2.  (Location Object
      fields):\n      *  Regarding requirement 2.1, the target identifier is carried\n
      \        within the network-access authentication protocol (e.g., within\n         the
      EAP-Identity Response when EAP is used and/or within the\n         EAP method
      itself).  As described in Section 7.2 of this\n         document, it has a number
      of advantages if this identifier is\n         not carried in clear.  This is
      possible with certain EAP\n         methods whereby the identity in the EAP-Identity
      Response only\n         contains information relevant for routing the response
      to the\n         user's home network.  The user identity is protected by the\n
      \        authentication and key exchange protocol.\n      *  Regarding requirement
      2.2, the Location Recipient is, in the\n         main scenario, the home RADIUS
      server.  For a scenario where\n         the Location Recipient is obtaining
      location information from\n         the Location Server via HTTP or SIP, the
      respective mechanisms\n         defined in these protocols are used to identify
      the recipient.\n         The Location Generator cannot, a priori, know the recipients
      if\n         they are not defined in this protocol.\n      *  Regarding requirement
      2.3, the credentials of the Location\n         Recipient are known to the RADIUS
      entities based on the\n         security mechanisms defined in the RADIUS protocol
      itself.\n         Section 7 of this document describes these security mechanisms\n
      \        offered by the RADIUS protocol.  The same is true for\n         requirement
      2.4.\n      *  Regarding requirement 2.5, Sections 4.2, 4.3.1, and 4.3.2\n         describe
      the content of the Location fields.  Since the\n         location format itself
      is not defined in this document, motion\n         and direction vectors as listed
      in requirement 2.6 are not\n         defined.\n      *  Regarding requirement
      2.6, this document provides the\n         capability for the RADIUS server to
      indicate what type of\n         location information it would like to see from
      the RADIUS\n         client.\n      *  Regarding requirement 2.7, timing information
      is provided with\n         the 'Sighting Time' and 'Time-to-Live' fields defined
      in\n         Section 4.2.\n      *  Regarding requirement 2.8, a reference to
      an external (more\n         detailed ruleset) is provided with the Extended-Location-\n
      \        Policy-Rules Attribute in Section 4.5.\n      *  Regarding requirement
      2.9, security headers and trailers are\n         provided as part of the RADIUS
      protocol or even as part of\n         IPsec.\n      *  Regarding requirement
      2.10, a version number in RADIUS is\n         provided with the IANA registration
      of the attributes.  New\n         attributes are assigned a new IANA number.\n
      \  Req. 3.  (Location Data Types):\n      *  Regarding requirement 3.1, this
      document reuses civic and\n         geospatial location information as described
      in Sections 4.3.2\n         and 4.3.1.\n      *  With the support of civic and
      geospatial location information,\n         support of requirement 3.2 is fulfilled.\n
      \     *  Regarding requirement 3.3, the geospatial location information\n         used
      by this document only refers to absolute coordinates.\n         However, the
      granularity of the location information can be\n         reduced with the help
      of the AltRes, LoRes, and LaRes fields\n         described in [RFC3825].\n      *
      \ Regarding requirement 3.4, further Location Data Types can be\n         added
      via new coordinate reference systems (CRSs -- see the\n         Datum field
      in [RFC3825]) and via extensions to [RFC3825] and\n         [RFC4776].\n   Section
      7.2 of [RFC3693] details the requirements of a \"using\n   protocol\".  These
      requirements are listed below.\n   Req. 4.:  The using protocol has to obey
      the privacy and security\n      instructions coded in the Location Object (LO)
      regarding the\n      transmission and storage of the LO.  This document requires
      that\n      entities that aim to make location information available to third\n
      \     parties be required to obey the privacy instructions.\n   Req. 5.:  The
      using protocol will typically facilitate that the keys\n      associated with
      the credentials are transported to the respective\n      parties, that is, key
      establishment is the responsibility of the\n      using protocol.  Section 7
      of this document specifies how security\n      mechanisms are used in RADIUS
      and how they can be reused to\n      provide security protection for the Location
      Object.\n      Additionally, the privacy considerations (see Section 7.2) are\n
      \     also relevant for this requirement.\n   Req. 6.  (Single Message Transfer):
      \ In particular, for tracking of\n      small target devices, the design should
      allow a single message/\n      packet transmission of location as a complete
      transaction.  The\n      encoding of the Location Object is specifically tailored
      towards\n      the inclusion into a single message that even respects the (Path)\n
      \     MTU size.\n   Section 7.3 of [RFC3693] details the requirements of a \"Rule-based\n
      \  Location Data Transfer\".  These requirements are listed below.\n   Req.
      7.  (LS Rules):  With the scenario shown in Figure 8, the\n      decision of
      a Location Server to provide a Location Recipient\n      access to location
      information is based on Rule Maker-defined\n      privacy rules that are stored
      at the home network.  With regard to\n      the scenario shown in Figure 9,
      the Rule Maker-defined privacy\n      rules are sent from the RADIUS server
      to the NAS (see Sections\n      4.4, 4.5, and 7.2 for more details).\n   Req.
      8.  (LG Rules):  For all usage scenarios, it is possible to\n      consider
      the privacy rule before transmitting location information\n      from the NAS
      to the RADIUS server or even to third parties.  In\n      the case of an out-of-band
      agreement between the owner of the NAS\n      and the owner of the RADIUS server,
      privacy might be applied on a\n      higher granularity.  For the scenario shown
      in Figure 8, the\n      visited network is already in possession of the user's
      location\n      information prior to the authentication and authorization of
      the\n      user.  A correlation between the location and the user identity\n
      \     might, however, still not be possible for the visited network (as\n      explained
      in Section 7.2).  A Location Server in the visited\n      network has to evaluate
      available rulesets.\n   Req. 9.  (Viewer Rules):  The Rule Maker might define
      (via mechanisms\n      outside the scope of this document) which policy rules
      are\n      disclosed to other entities.\n   Req. 10.  (Full Rule language):
      \ GEOPRIV has defined a rule language\n      capable of expressing a wide range
      of privacy rules that is\n      applicable in the area of the distribution of
      Location Objects.  A\n      basic ruleset is provided with the Basic-Location-Policy-Rules\n
      \     Attribute (Section 4.4).  A reference to the extended ruleset is\n      carried
      in Section 4.5.  The format of these rules is described in\n      [RFC4745]
      and [GEO-POLICY].\n   Req. 11.  (Limited Rule language):  A limited (or basic)
      ruleset is\n      provided by the Policy-Information Attribute in Section 4.4
      (and\n      as introduced with PIDF-LO [RFC4119]).\n   Section 7.4 of [RFC3693]
      details the requirements of a \"Location\n   Object Privacy and Security\".
      \ These requirements are listed below.\n   Req. 12 (Identity Protection):  Support
      for unlinkable pseudonyms is\n      provided by the usage of a corresponding
      authentication and key-\n      exchange protocol.  Such protocols are available,
      for example,\n      with the support of EAP as network-access authentication
      methods.\n      Some EAP methods support passive user-identity confidentiality,\n
      \     whereas others even support active user-identity confidentiality.\n      This
      issue is further discussed in Section 7.  The importance for\n      user-identity
      confidentiality and identity protection has already\n      been recognized as
      an important property (see, for example, a\n      document on EAP method requirements
      for wireless LANs [RFC4017]).\n   Req. 13.  (Credential Requirements):  As described
      in Section 7 ,\n      RADIUS signaling messages can be protected with IPsec.
      \ This\n      allows a number of authentication and key exchange protocols to
      be\n      used as part of IKE, IKEv2, or KINK.\n   Req. 14.  (Security Features):
      \ GEOPRIV defines a few security\n      requirements for the protection of Location
      Objects, such as\n      mutual end-point authentication, data object integrity,
      data\n      object confidentiality, and replay protection.  As described in\n
      \     Section 7, these requirements are fulfilled with the usage of\n      IPsec
      if mutual authentication refers to the RADIUS entities\n      (acting as various
      GEOPRIV entities) that directly communicate\n      with each other.\n   Req.
      15.  (Minimal Crypto):  A minimum of security mechanisms are\n      mandated
      by the usage of RADIUS.  Communication security for\n      Location Objects
      between RADIUS infrastructure elements is\n      provided by the RADIUS protocol
      (including IPsec and its dynamic\n      key-management framework), rather than
      relying on object security\n      via S/SIME (which is not available with RADIUS).\n"
