    \ of binding of multipart documents:\n           stapled documents should stay\
    \ together on the desktop,\n           while paper clipped ones should be easily\
    \ spreadable\n        2) big paper clips vs small ones; heirarchical assembly\n\

    \ are made.\n        2) to reduce transmission charges, electronic staples should\
    \ be\n           bought in boxes of 5000.  Reference: Apple's \"bento\"\n    \
    \       technology?\n        3) electonic staples should have a standard \"size\
    \ and shape\"\n           so a supply of staples could be used be used by several\n\
    \           programs.\n"

  - "3)      recycling electronic staples and paper clips\n        1) to assure proper\
    \ accounting, and to detect patent violations\n           (people making their\
    \ own electronic staples), it may be\n           necessary to attach a certificate\
    \ to each staple or paper\n           clip.\n        2) When a file or folder\
    \ is deleted, a \"recycler\" program could\n           look inside for staples\
    \ or paper clips that could be reused\n           or recycled.\n             \
    \   1) staples could be reycled for a small credit\n                2) paper clips\
    \ could be reused.\n"

  - "4)      custom-look electronic staples and paper clips\n        1) when stabled\
    \ or clipped documents are displayed on the\n           desktop, there should\
    \ be some icon or visual indicator to\n           show the presence of the (possibly\
    \ removable) staple\n           or paper clip\n        2) \"color=\" and \"shape=\"\
    \ attributes in the MIME line should\n           allow senders to customize the\
    \ appearance of individual\n           staples or paper clips.\n             \
    \   1) this could have some significance for office filing\n                 \
    \  systems, for instance: a silver paper clip could\n                   trigger\
    \ one workflow component, while\n                   a gold paper clip could trigger\
    \ another.\n        3) \"src=\" would allow the specification of a URL of the\
    \ image to\n           be shown, for even greater control of appearance.\n   \
    \     4) it should be possible to specify 3D modelling of your custom\n      \
    \     paper clip, for electronic desktops being viewed through\n           virtual\
    \ reality headsets\n"

  - "5)      electronic paper clip sculpture\n        1) instead of discarding or\
    \ reusing paper clips, it should be\n           possible to \"bend\" them and\
    \ display the resulting sculpture\n           on the desktop\n               \
    \ 1) a morphing interface would be suitable\n        2) linked chains of paper\
    \ clips\n        3) each paper clip should keep track of how many times it has\n\
    \           been  bent.  Above a certain limit, the clip should fail.\n"

  - "6)      electronic paper clips as page flags\n        1) in addition to using\
    \ electronic paper clips to group related\n           documents, it should be\
    \ possible to attach an electronic\n           paper clip to a single page of\
    \ a multipage document or\n           collection of documents.  This highlights\
    \ or draws\n           attention to the page.\n        2) it should be possible\
    \ to include positioning information\n           with the electronic paper clip,\
    \ to mark specific paragraphs\n           or sentences\n        3) combinations\
    \ of color, shape, size, position, orientation,\n           etc. could have special\
    \ meaning\n"

    \ of very small children\n                1) thus, one should consider keeping\
    \ them in a locked\n                   drawer of the electonic desk on home PCs\n\
    \        2) they should not be attached to documents on floppy disks, as\n   \
