    \            Bedford, Massachusetts\f          The widely touted network interface\
    \ protocol, \"X.25\", and\n     its attendant conceptual framework, the International\
    \ Standards\n     Organization's Reference Model for Open System Interconnection\n\
    \     (ISORM), are analyzed and found wanting.  The paper is a\n     companion\
    \ piece to M82-48, and M82-51.\n                            A CRITIQUE OF X.25\n\
    \                              M. A. Padlipsky\n     Introduction\n          According\
    \ to some sources, the International Standards\n     Organization's (ISO) \"Open\
    \ System Interconnection\" (OSI) effort\n     has adopted the International Consultative\
    \ Committee on Telephony\n     and Telegraphy (CCITT) developed X.25 protocol(s)\
    \ as its Levels\n     1-3. (\"Loose constructionists\" of the ISORM would hold\
    \ that X.25\n     is a mechanization of L1-L3 rather than the mechanization, and\
    \ at\n     least one British source holds that \"we in the U.K. don't believe\n\
    \     that ISO have adopted X.25.\")  In the U.S. Government arena,\n     where\
    \ the author spends much of his time, the Government\n     Accounting Office (GAO)\
    \ has suggested that the Department of\n     Defense (DoD) ought to consider adopting\
    \ \"X.25 networks,\"\n     apparently in preference to networks based on protocols\
    \ developed\n     by the DoD-sponsored intercomputer networking research community.\n\
    \     That intercomputer networking research community in turn has,\n     with\
    \ a few recent exceptions, adhered to its commitment to the\n     Oral Tradition\
    \ and not taken up the cudgels against X.25 in the\n     open literature, even\
    \ though X.25 is an object of considerable\n     scorn in personal communications.\n\
    \          Although the DoD Protocol Standards Technical Panel has\n     begun\
    \ to evolve a \"Reference Model\" different from ISO's for\n     reasons which\
    \ will be touched on below, there seems to be a need\n     to address the deficiencies\
    \ of X.25 on their own demerits as soon\n     as possible. Without pretending\
    \ to completeness*, this paper will\n     attempt to do just that.\n         \
    \ The overall intent is to deal with X.25 in the abstract;\n     because of who\
    \ pays the bills, though, a necessary preliminary is\n     to at least sketch\
    \ the broad reasons why the DoD in particular\n     should not\n     ________________\n\
    \     *  Various versions of X.25 and ISO documentation were employed;\n     \
    \   one incompleteness of note, however, is that no attempt has\n        been\
    \ made to do proper bibliographic citation.  Another\n        incompleteness lies\
    \ in the area of \"tutoriality\"; that is,\n        appropriate prior knowledge\
    \ is assumed on the part of the\n        reader.  (The author apologizes for the\
    \ omissions but hasn't\n        the time or the energy to be overly scholarly.\
    \  Reference [3]\n        might be of use to the reader who feels slighted.)\n\
    \     RFC 874                                            September 1982\n    \
    \ employ intercomputer networks which base their protocol suites on\n     the\
    \ ISO Reference Model (ISORM) with X.25 as Levels 1-3.  (Note\n     that this\
    \ is a different formulation from \"use communications\n     subnetworks which\
    \ present an X.25 interface.\")  Very briefly, the\n     DoD has concerns with\
    \ \"survivability,\" reliability, security,\n     investment in prior art (i.e.,\
    \ its research community has a\n     working protocol suite in place on many different\
    \ operating\n     systems), procurability (i.e., ISORM-related protocol suites\
    \ do\n     not as yet fully exist even on paper and the international\n     standardization\
    \ process is acknowledged even by its advocates to\n     require several years\
    \ to arrive at full suite specification, much\n     less offer available interoperable\
    \ implementation), and\n     interoperability with a much wider range of systems\
    \ than are ever\n     likely to receive vendor-supplied implementations of ISORM\n\
    \     protocol suites.  Regardless of which particular concerns are\n     considered\
    \ to dominate, the DoD cannot be expected to await\n     events in the ISO arena.\
    \  (Particularly striking is the fact that\n     DoD representatives are not even\
    \ permitted under current doctrine\n     to present their specific concerns in\
    \ the area of security in the\n     sort of unclassified environment the ISO arena\
    \ constitutes.)\n          Some zealous ISORM advocates have suggested that the\
    \ DoD\n     research community suffers from a \"Not Invented Here\" syndrome\n\
    \     with respect to ISORM-related protocols, though, so even if the\n     various\
    \ reasons just cited were to prevail, there would still be\n     an open issue\
    \ at some level.  At least one or two zealous members\n     of the research community\
    \ have asserted that the problem is not\n     Not Invented Here, but Not Invented\
    \ Right, so an assessment of\n     the apparent keystone of the ISORM suite, X.25,\
    \ from the\n     perspective of whether it's \"good art\" ought to be appropriate.\n\
    \     That's what we're up to here.\n     RFC 874                            \
    \                September 1982\n     Problems With the Conceptual Model*\n  \
    \        There is confusion even amongst its advocates as to the real\n     conceptual\
    \ model of X.25-based ISO networking.  Some draw their\n     Reference  Model\
    \ as two \"highrises,\" others draw \"parking\n     garages\" beside each highrise.\
    \  That is, some draw the seven\n     ISORM layers in large rectangles (representing\
    \ Hosts) next to one\n     another, showing each layer in communication with its\
    \ \"peer\" in\n     the other Host/Open System; this implies an \"end-to-end\"\
    \ view of\n     X.25.  Others draw smaller rectangles between the larger ones,\n\
    \     with Levels 1-3 having peer relationships from the Host-OS (\"Data\n   \
    \  Terminal Equipment\") to the Comm Subnet Node (\"Data Circuit\n     Terminating\
    \ Equipment\"); this implies a \"link-by-link\" view of\n     X.25.  This ambiguity\
    \ does not engender confidence in the\n     architects, but perhaps the real problem\
    \ is with the spectators.\n     Yet it is indisputable that when internetting\
    \ with X.75, the\n     model becomes \"hop-by-hop\" (and it is likely it's meant\
    \ to be\n     link-by-link even on a single comm subnet).\n          A major problem\
    \ with such a model is that the designers have\n     chosen to construe it as\
    \ requiring them to break the \"virtual\n     circuit\" it is supposed to be supporting\
    \ whenever there is\n     difficulty with any one of the links.  Thus, if internetting,\
    \ and\n     on some interpretations even on one's proximate net, rerouting of\n\
    \     messages will not occur when needed, and all the upper levels of\n     protocols\
    \ will have to expend space-time resources on\n     reconstituting their own connections\
    \ with their counterparts.\n     (Note that the success of the reconstitution\
    \ under DCE failure\n     appears to assume a certain flexibility in routing which\
    \ is not\n     guaranteed by the Model.)  This can scarcely be deemed sound\n\
    \     design practice for an intercomputer networking environment,\n     although\
    \ many have conjectured that it probably makes sense to\n     telephonists.\n\
    \     ________________\n     *  Note that we are assuming an ISO-oriented model\
    \ rather than a\n        CCITT-oriented one (X.25/X.28/X.29) because the latter\
    \ appears\n        to offer only \"remote access\" functionality whereas the sort\n\
    \        of intercomputer networking we are interested in is concerned\n     \
    \   with the full \"resource-sharing\" functionality the former is\n        striving\
    \ for.  This might be somewhat unfair to X.25, in that\n        it is taking the\
    \ protocol(s) somewhat out of context; however,\n        it is what ISO has done\
    \ before us, and if what we're really\n        accomplishing is a demonstration\
    \ that ISO has erred in so\n        doing, so be it.  As a matter of fact, it\
    \ can also be argued\n        that X.25 is itself somewhat unfair--to its users,\
    \ who are\n        expecting real networking and getting only communication; cf.\n\
    \        Padlipsky, M. A., \"The Elements of Networking Style\", M81-41,\n   \
    \     The MITRE Corporation, October 1981, for more on the extremely\n       \
    \ important topic of resource sharing vs. remote access.\n     RFC 874       \
    \                                     September 1982\n          Indeed, it appears\
    \ the virtual circuit metaphor is in some\n     sense being taken almost literally\
    \ (with the emphasis on the\n     \"circuit\" aspect), in that what should be\
    \ an environment that\n     confers the benefits of packet-switching is, at the\
    \ X.25 level,\n     reduced to one with the limitations of circuit-switching.\
    \  On the\n     other hand, the metaphor is not being taken literally enough in\n\
    \     some other sense (with the emphasis on the \"virtual\" aspect), for\n  \
    \   many construe it to imply that the logical connection it\n     represents\
    \ is \"only as strong as a wire.\"  Whether the whole\n     problem stems from\
    \ the desire to \"save bits\" by not making\n     addresses explicitly available\
    \ on a per-transmission basis is\n     conjectural, but if such be the case it\
    \ is also unfortunate.\n          (As an aside, it should be noted that there\
    \ is some evidence\n     that bit saving reaches fetish--if not pathological--proportions\n\
    \     in X.25:  For instance, there does not even appear to be a Packet\n    \
    \ Type field in data packets; rather--as best we can determine--for\n     data\
    \ packets the low order bit of the \"P(R)\" field, which\n     overlaps/stands\
    \ in the place of the Packet Type is always 0,\n     whereas in \"real\" Packet\
    \ Type fields it's always 1.  [That may,\n     by the way, not even be the way\
    \ they do it--it's hard to tell ...\n     or care.])\n          There is also\
    \ confusion even amongst its advocates as to\n     what implications, if any,\
    \ the protocol(s) has (have) for comm\n     subnet node to comm subnet node (CSN)\
    \ processing.  Those who draw\n     just two highrises seem to be implying that\
    \ from their\n     perspective the CSN (or \"DCE\") is invisible.  This might\
    \ make a\n     certain amount of sense if they did not assert that each floor\
    \ of\n     a highrise has a \"peer-relationship\" with the corresponding floor\n\
    \     of the other highrise--for to do so implies excessively long\n     wires,\
    \ well beyond the state of the wire-drawing art, when one\n     notices that the\
    \ first floor is the physical level.  (It also\n     appears to disallow the existence\
    \ of concatenated comm subnets\n     into an internet, or \"catenet,\" unless\
    \ the CSN's are all\n     identically constituted.  And those who hold that the\
    \ ISORM\n     dictates single protocols at each level will have a hard time\n\
    \     making an HDLC interface into a Packet Radio Net, in all\n     probability.)\n\
    \          Those who, on the other hand, \"draw parking garages,\" seem\n    \
    \ to be dictating that the internal structure of the CSN also\n     adhere to\
    \ X.25 link and physical protocols.  This implies that\n     Packet Radio or satellite\
    \ CSNs, for example, cannot \"be X.25.\"\n     Now that might be heartening news\
    \ to the designers of such comm\n     subnets, but it presumably wasn't intended\
    \ by those who claim\n     universality for X.25--or even for the ISO Reference\
    \ Model.\n     RFC 874                                            September 1982\n\
    \          Even granting that ambiguities in the conceptual model do\n     not\
    \ constitute prima facie grounds for rejecting the protocol(s),\n     it is important\
    \ to note that they almost assuredly will lead to\n     vendor implementations\
    \ based on differing interpretations that\n     will not interoperate properly.\
    \ And the unambiguous position that\n     virtual circuits are broken whenever\
    \ X.25 says so constitutes a\n     flaw at least as grave as any of the ambiguities.\n\
    \          Another, in our view extremely severe, shortcoming of the\n     X.25\
    \ conceptual model is that it fails to address how programs\n     that interpret\
    \ its protocol(s) are to be integrated into their\n     containing operating systems.\
    \  (This goes beyond the shortcoming\n     of the X.25 specifications in this\
    \ area, for even the advocates\n     of the ISORM--who, by hypothesis at least,\
    \ have adopted X.25 for\n     their Levels 1-3--are reticent on the topic in their\
    \ literature.)\n     Yet, if higher level protocols are to be based on X.25, there\n\
    \     must be commonality of integration of X.25 modules with operating\n    \
    \ systems at least in certain aspects.  The most important example\n     that\
    \ comes to mind is the necessity for \"out-of-band signals\" to\n     take place.\
    \  Yet if there is no awareness of that sort of use\n     reflected in the X.25\
    \ protocol's specification, implementers need\n     not insert X.25 modules into\
    \ their operating systems in such a\n     fashion as to let the higher level protocols\
    \ function properly\n     when/if an X.25 Interrupt packet arrives.\n        \
    \  Yet much of the problem with the conceptual model might turn\n     out to stem\
    \ from our own misunderstandings, or the\n     misunderstandings of others.  After\
    \ all, it's not easy to infer a\n     philosophy from a specification.  (Nor,\
    \ when it comes to\n     recognizing data packets, is it easy even to infer the\n\
    \     specification--but it might well say something somewhere on that\n     particular\
    \ point which we simply overlooked in our desire to get\n     the spec back on\
    \ the shelf rapidly.) What other aspects of X.25\n     appear to be \"bad art\"\
    ?\n     \"Personality Problems\"\n          When viewed from a functionality perspective,\
    \ X.25 appears\n     to be rather schizophrenic, in the sense that sometimes it\n\
    \     presents a deceptively end-to-end \"personality\" (indeed, there\n     are\
    \ many who think it is usable as an integral Host-Host, or\n     Transport, and\
    \ network interface protocol, despite the fact that\n     its specification itself--at\
    \ least in the CCITT \"Fascicle\"\n     version--points out several functional\
    \ omissions where a\n     higher-level protocol is expected--and we have even\
    \ spoken to one\n     or two people who say they actually do -- use it as an end-to-end\n\
    \     protocol, regardless); sometimes it presents a comm subnet\n     network\
    \ interface personality (which all would agree it must);\n     and sometimes (according\
    \ to some observers) it presents a\n     RFC 874                             \
    \               September 1982\n     \"Host-Front End Protocol\" personality.\
    \  Not to push the \"bad art\"\n     methaphor too hard, but this sort of violation\
    \ of \"the Unities\"\n     is, if demonstrable, grounds for censure not only to\
    \ literary\n     critics but also to those who believe in Layering.  Let's look\
    \ at\n     the evidence for the split-personality claim:\n          X.25 is not\
    \ (and should not be) an \"end-to-end\" protocol in\n     the sense of a Transport\
    \ or Host-to-Host protocol.  Yet it has\n     several end-to-end features.  These\
    \ add to the space-time expense\n     of implementation (i.e., consume \"core\"\
    \ and CPU cycles) and\n     reflect badly on the skill of its designers if one\
    \ believes in\n     the design principles of Layering and Least Mechanism.  (Examples\n\
    \     of end-to-end mechanisms are cited below, as mechanisms\n     superfluous\
    \ to the network interface role.)  The absence of a\n     datagram mode which\
    \ is both required and \"proper\" (e.g., not Flow\n     Controlled, not Delivery\
    \ Confirmed, not Non-delivery mechanized)\n     may also be taken as evidence\
    \ that the end-to-end view is very\n     strong in X.25.  That is, in ISO Reference\
    \ Model (ISORM) terms,\n     even though X.25 \"is\" L1-3, it has delusions of\
    \ L4-ness; in\n     ARPANET Reference Model (ARM) terms, even though X.25 could\
    \ \"be\"\n     L I, it has delusions of L II-ness.*\n          X.25 is at least\
    \ meant to specify an interface between a\n     Host (or \"DTE\") and a comm subnet\
    \ processor (or \"DCE\"),\n     regardless of the ambiguity of the conceptual\
    \ model about whether\n     it constrains the CSNP \"on the network side.\"  (Aside:\
    \  that\n     ambiguity probably reflects even more badly on certain X.25\n  \
    \   advocates than it does on the designers, for there is a strong\n     sense\
    \ in which \"of course it can't\" is the only appropriate\n     answer to the\
    \ question of whether it is meant to constrain\n     generic CSN processors (CSNP's)\
    \ in the general case.  Note,\n     though, that it might well be meant to constrain\
    \ specific DCE's;\n     that is, it started life as a protocol for PTT's--or Postal,\n\
    \     Telephone, and Telegraph monopolies--and they are presumably\n     entitled\
    \ to constrain themselves all they want.)  Yet the\n     end-to-end features alluded\
    \ to above are redundant to the\n     interfacing role, and, as noted, extraneous\
    \ features have\n     space-time consequences. There are also several features\
    \ which,\n     though not end-to-end, seem superfluous to a \"tight\" interface\n\
    \     protocol.  Further, the reluctance of the designers to\n     incorporate\
    \ a proper \"datagram\" capability in the protocol (what\n     they've got doesn't\
    \ seem to be\n     ________________\n     *  For more on the ARM, see Padlipsky,\

    \ information destined for the outboard\n     implementation of the relevant protocols\
    \ and data to be\n     transmitted through X.25, but there is no evidence of such\n\
    \     mechanisms in the protocol.  \"Borrowing\" a Packet Type id for\n     H-FP\
    \ would be risky, as the spec is subject to arbitrary\n     alteration.  Using\
    \ some fictitious DTE address to indicate the\n     proximate DCE is also risky,\
    \ for the same reason.  Further, using\n     \"Call user data\" to \"talk to\"\
    \ the counterpart H-FP module allows\n     only 15 octets (plus, presumably, the\
    \ 6 spare bits in the 16th\n     octet) for the conversation, whereas various\
    \ TCP and IP options\n     might require many more octets than that.  Granted\
    \ that with\n     sufficient ingenuity--or even by the simple expedient of\n \
    \    conveying the entire H-FP as data (i.e., using X.25 only to get\n     channels\
    \ to demultiplex on, and DTE-DCE flow control, with the\n     \"DCE\" actually\
    \ being an Outboard Processing Environment that gets\n     its commands in the\
    \ data fields of X.25 data packets)--X.25 might\n     be used to \"get at\" outboard\
    \ protocol interpreters, but its\n     failure to address the issue explicitly\
    \ again reflects badly on\n     its designers' grasp of intercomputer networking\
    \ issues.\n     (Another possibility is that the whole H-FP notion stems from\
    \ the\n     use of X.25 as a Host-Host\n     ________________\n     *  That is,\
    \ as a distributed processing mechanism which allows\n        Host operating systems\
    \ to be relieved of the burden of\n        interpreting higher level protocols\
    \ \"inboard\" of themselves by\n        virtue of allowing Host processes to manipulate\
    \ \"outboard\"\n        interpreters of the protocols on their behalf.  Note that\
    \ the\n        outboarding may be to a separate Front-End processor or to the\n\
    \        CSNP itself.  (The latter is likely to be found in\n        microprocessor-based\
    \ LAN \"BIU's.\")  Note also that when\n        dealing with \"process-level\"\
    \ protocols (ARM L III;\n        approximately ISORM L5-7), only part of the functionality\
    \ is\n        outboarded (e.g., there must be some Host-resident code to\n   \
    \     interface with the native File System for a File Transfer\n        Protocol)\
    \ and even when outboarding Host-Host protocols (ARM L\n        II; approximately\
    \ ISORM L4 plus some of 5) the association of\n        logical connections (or\
    \ \"sockets\") with processes must be\n        performed inboard--which is why,\
    \ by the way, it's annoying to\n        find ISO L5 below ISO L6: because, that\
    \ is, you'd like to\n        outboard \"Presentation\" functionality but its protocol\
    \ expects\n        to interact with the \"Session\" protocol, the functionality\
    \ of\n        which can't be outboarded.  (Although this approach, not the\n \
    \       proper context for a full treatment of the H-FP approach, it\n       \
    \ is also of interest that the approach can effectively insulate\n        the\
    \ Host from changes in the protocol suite, which can be a\n        major advantage\
    \ in some environments.)\n     RFC 874                                       \
    \     September 1982\n     protocol so that some might think of it in its Host\
    \ aspect as\n     \"simply\" a way of getting at the H-HP.  This interpretation\
    \ does\n     give rise to the interesting observation that DCE's seem to need\n\
    \     a protocol as strong as TCP amongst themselves, but doesn't\n     strike\
    \ the author as particularly convincing evidence for viewing\n     X.25 as anything\
    \ like a proper H-FP--if for no other reason than\n     that a central premise\
    \ of Outboard Processing is that the\n     Host-side H-FP module must be compact\
    \ relative to an inboard\n     generic Network Control Program.)\n          X.25,\
    \ then, is rather schizophrenic:  It exceeds its brief\n     as an  interface\
    \ protocol by pretending to be end-to-end\n     (Host-Host) in some respects;\
    \ it is by no means a full end-to-end\n     protocol (its spec very properly insists\
    \ on that point on several\n     occasions); it's at once too full and too shallow\
    \ to be a good\n     interface; and it's poorly structured to be treated as if\
    \ it were\n     \"just\" an H-FP.  (Some would phrase the foregoing as \"It's\n\
    \     extremely ill layered\"; we wouldn't argue.)\n     A Note on \"Gateways\"\
    *\n          Although it was at least implied in the discussion of\n     conceptual\
    \ model problems, one aspect of X.25/X.75 internetting\n     is sufficiently significant\
    \ to deserve a section of its own:  Not\n     only does the link-by-link approach\
    \ taken by CCITT make it\n     unlikely that alternate routing can take place,\
    \ but it is also\n     the case that ARPANET Internet Protocol (IP) based internetting\n\
    \     not only permits alternate routing but also could alt-route over\n     an\
    \ \"X.25 Subnet.\"  That is, in IP's conceptual model, Gateways\n     attach to\
    \ two or more comm subnets \"as if they (the Gateways)\n     were Hosts.\"  This\
    \ means that they interpret the appropriate\n     Host-comm subnet processor protocol\
    \ of whatever comm subnets\n     they're attached to, giving as the \"proximate\
    \ net address\" of a\n     given transmission either the ultimate (internet addressed)\n\
    \     destination or the address of another Gateway \"in the right\n     direction.\"\
    \  And an implementation of IP can certainly employ an\n     implementation of\
    \ (\"DTE\") X.25 to get a proximate net, so ... at\n     least \"in an emergency\"\
    \ X.25 interface presenting Public Data\n     Networks can indeed carry IP traffic.\
    \  (Note also that only the\n     proximate net's header has to be readable by\
    \ the nodal processor\n     of/on the proximate net, so if some appropriate steps\
    \ were taken\n     to render the data portion of such transmissions unintelligible\n\
    \     to the nodal processors, so much the better.)\n     ________________\n \
    \    *  This section was added to address the ill-founded concerns of\n      \
    \  several ISORMites that \"TCP/IP won't let you use Public Data\n        Nets\
    \ in emergencies.\"\n     RFC 874                                            September\
    \ 1982\n          (Further evidence that X.75 internetting is undesirable is\n\
    \     found in the fact that the U.S. National Bureau of Standards has,\n    \
    \ despite its nominal adoption of the ISORM, inserted IP at\n     approximately\
    \ L3.5 in its version of the Reference Model.)\n     The Off-Blue Blanket\n  \
    \        Although touched on earlier, and not treatable at much\n     length in\
    \ the present context, the topic of security deserves\n     separate mention.\
    \  We are familiar with one reference in the open\n     literature [1] which appears\
    \ to make a rather striking point\n     about the utility of X.25 in a secure\
    \ network.   Dr. Kent's point\n     that the very field sizes of X.25 are not\
    \ acceptable from the\n     point of view of encryption devices would, if correct\
    \ (and we are\n     neither competent to assess that, nor in a position to even\
    \ if we\n     were), almost disqualify X.25 a priori for use in many arenas.\n\
    \     Clearly, uncertified \"DCE's\" cannot be permitted to read\n     classified\
    \ (or even \"private\") data and so must be \"encrypted\n     around,\" after\
    \ all.\n          It would probably be the case, if we understand Dr. Kent's\n\
    \     point, that X.25 could be changed appropriately--if its\n     specifiers\
    \ were willing to go along.  But this is only one\n     problem out of a potentially\
    \ large number of problems, and,\n     returning briefly to our concern with the\
    \ interplay of X.25 and\n     the DoD, those persons in the DoD who know best\
    \ what the problems\n     are and/or could be are debarred from discussing them\
    \ with the\n     specifiers of X.25.  Perhaps a sufficiently zealous ISORM\n \
    \    advocate would be willing to suggest that Professor Kuo's\n     publisher\
    \ be subsidized to come out with a new edition whenever a\n     problem arises\
    \ so that if Dr. Kent happens to spot it advantage\n     can continue to be taken\
    \ of his ability to write for the open\n     literature--but we certainly hope\
    \ and trust that no ISORMite\n     would be so tone-deaf as to fail to recognize\
    \ the facetiousness\n     of that suggestion.\n          In short, it appears\
    \ to be difficult to dispute the\n     assertion that whatever sort of security\
    \ blanket X.25 could\n     represent would at best be an off shade of blue.\n\
    \     Space-Time Considerations\n          Another topic touched on earlier which\
    \ deserves separate\n     mention, if only to collect the scattered data in a\
    \ single\n     section, is that of what have been called space-time\n     considerations.\
    \  That is, we are concerned about how well X.25 in\n     particular and the ISORM-derived\
    \ protocols in general will\n     implement, both in terms of size of protocol\
    \ interpreters (PI's)\n     and in terms of execution and delay times.\n     RFC\
    \ 874                                            September 1982\n          On\
    \ the space heading, certainly the fact that X.25 offers\n     more functionality\
    \ in its end-to-end guise than is required to\n     fulfill its network interface\
    \ role suggests that X.25 PI's will\n     be bigger than they need be.  As an\
    \ aside--but a striking one--it\n     should be noted that X.25's end-to-end functions\
    \ are at variance\n     with the ISORM itself, for the \"peer entity\" of a DTE\
    \ X.25 entity\n     must surely be the local DCE X.25.  Perhaps a later version\
    \ of\n     the ISORM will introduce the polypeer and give rise to a whole\n  \
    \   new round of Layering-Theologic controversy.*  Speaking of the\n     ISORM\
    \ itself, those who hold that each layer must be traversed on\n     each transmission\
    \ are implicitly requiring that space (and time)\n     be expended in the Session\
    \ and Presentation Levels even for\n     applications that have no need of their\
    \ services.  The Well-Known\n     Socket concept of the ARM's primary Host-Host\
    \ protocol, the\n     Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), lets Session functionality\n\
    \     be avoided for many applications, on the other hand--unless ISORM\n    \
    \ L5 is to usurp the Host's user identification/authentication role\n     at some\
    \ point.  (Yes, we've heard the rumors that \"null layers\"\n     might be introduced\
    \ into the ISORM; no, we don't want to get into\n     the theology of that either.)\n\
    \          On the time heading, X.25's virtual circuit view can be\n     debilitating--or\
    \ even crippling--to applications such as\n     Packetized Speech where prompt\
    \ delivery is preferred over ordered\n     or even reliable delivery.  (Some hold\
    \ that the X.25 datagram\n     option will remedy that; others hold that it's\
    \ not \"really\n     datagrams\"; we note the concern, agree with the others,\
    \ and pass\n     on.)  Speaking of reliable delivery, as noted earlier some\n\
    \     observers hold that in order to present an acceptable virtual\n     circuit\
    \ X.25 must have a protocol as strong as TCP \"beneath\"\n     itself; again,\
    \ we're in sympathy with them.  Shifting focus again\n     to the ISORM itself,\
    \ it must be noted that the principle that\n     \"N-entities\" must communicate\
    \ with one another even in the same\n     Host via \"N-1 entities\" even in the\
    \ same Host is an over-zealous\n     application of the Principle of Layering\
    \ that must consume more\n     time in the interpreting of the N-1 protocol than\
    \ would a direct\n     interface between N-level PI's or such process-level protocols\
    \ as\n     FTP and Telnet, as is done in the ARPANET-derived model.\n        \
    \  Other space-time deficiencies could be adduced, but perhaps\n     a shortcut\
    \ will suffice.  There is a Law of Programming\n     (attributed to Sutherland)\
    \ to the effect that \"Programs are like\n     waffles: you should always throw\
    \ the first one out.\"  Its\n     relevance should become\n     ________________\n\
    \     *  And perhaps we now know why some just draw the highrises.\n     RFC 874\
    \                                            September 1982\n     clear when it\
    \ is realized that (with the possible exception of\n     X.25) ISORM PI's are\
    \ in general either first implementations or\n     not even implemented yet (thus,\
    \ the batter, as it were, is still\n     being mixed).  Contrast this with the\
    \ iterations the\n     ARPANET-derived PI's--and, for that matter, protocols--have\
    \ gone\n     through over the years and the grounds for our concern over\n   \
    \  X.25/ISORM space-time inefficiency become clear irrespective of\n     corroborative\
    \ detail. Factor in the consideration that space-time\n     efficiency may be\
    \ viewed as contrary to the corporate interests\n     of the progenitors of X.25\
    \ (\"the PTT's\") and at least the current\n     favorite for ISORM Level 4 (ECMA--the\
    \ European Computer\n     Manufacturers' Association), and it should become clear\
    \ why we\n     insist that space-time considerations be given separate mention\n\
    \     even though touched upon elsewhere.*\n     Getting Physical\n          Still\
    \ another area of concern over X.25 is that it dictates\n     only one means of\
    \ attaching a \"DTE\" to a \"DCE.\"  That is, earlier\n     references to \"the\
    \ X.25 protocol(s)\" were not typographical\n     errors. Most of the time, \"\
    X.25\" refers to ISORM Level 3;\n     actually, though, the term subsumes L2 and\
    \ L1 as well.  Indeed,\n     the lowest levels constitute particular bit serial\
    \ interfaces.\n     This is all very well for interfacing to \"Public Data Nets\"\
    \n     (again, it must be recalled that X.25's roots are in CCITT), but\n    \
    \ is scarcely appropriate to environments where the communications\n     subnetwork\
    \ may consist of geosynchronous communications satellite\n     channels, \"Packet\
    \ Radios,\" or whatever.  Indeed, even for\n     conventional Local Area Networks\
    \ it is often the case that a\n     Direct Memory Access arrangement is desired\
    \ so as to avoid\n     bottlenecking--but DMA isn't HDLC, and the \"vendor supported\
    \ X.25\n     interface\" so prized by some won't be DMA either, one imagines.\n\
    \     (Speaking of LAN's, at least the evolving standard in that\n     arena--\"\
    IEEE 802\"--apparently will offer multiple physical\n     interfaces depending\
    \ on comm subnet style [although there is some\n     disagreement on this point\
    \ amongst readers of their draft specs];\n     we understand, however, that their\
    \ Level 2 shares X.25's end-end\n     aspirations--and we haven't checked up on\
    \ DMA capability.)  X.25,\n     then, imposes constraints upon its users with\
    \ regard to interface\n     technology that are inappropriate.\n     ________________\n\

    \ are the\n     author's responsibility.  Mention should be made, however, of\
    \ a\n     few recent documents in the area:  The Defense Communications\n    \
    \ Agency (DCA Code J110) has sent a coordinated DoD position [2] to\n     NBS\
    \ holding that X.25 cannot be the DoD's sole network interface\n     standard;\
    \ Dr. Vinton Cerf of the ARPA Information Processing\n     Technology Office made\
    \ a contribution to the former which\n     contains a particularly lucid exposition\
    \ of the desirability of\n     proper \"datagram\" capability in DoD comm subnets\
    \ [3]; Mr. Ray\n     McFarland of the DoD Computer Security Evaluation Center\
    \ has also\n     explored the limitations of X.25 [4]. Whether because these\n\
    \     authors are inherently more tactful than the present author, or\n     whether\
    \ their positions are more constraining, or even whether\n     they have been\
    \ more insulated from and hence less provoked by\n     uninformed ISORMite zealots,\
    \ none has seen fit to address the\n     \"quality\" of X.25.  That this paper\
