  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC suggests an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\n\
    \   community.  Hosts on the Internet that choose to implement a Message\n   Send\
    \ Protocol may experiment with this protocol.  Please refer to the\n   current\
    \ edition of the \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\" for the\n   standardization\
    \ state and status of this protocol.  Distribution of\n   this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: Discussion
  contents:
  - "Discussion\n   The Message Send Protocol is used to send a short message to a\
    \ given\n   user on a given terminal on a given host.  This is similar to the\n\
    \   service provided by Unix's write command, which is limited to the\n   users\
    \ on that host.  This service is also known on some hosts as\n   \"SEND\".\n \
    \  As the Internet grows, more and more people are using hosts that do\n   not\
    \ run TCP/IP at all times.  These hosts may be able to use a simple\n   protocol\
    \ that can be implemented in a subset of TCP/IP.  The Message\n   Send Protocol\
    \ is one such protocol.\n   Note that a message sending protocol is already defined\
    \ using TCP.\n   The SMTP protocol includes a \"SEND\" command that will direct\
    \ mail to\n   a user's terminal.  SMTP's SEND is not useful in this instance\n\
    \   because TCP requires quite a bit of code.  For the purposes of\n   standardization,\
    \ we will include a TCP based Message Send Service.\n"
- title: TCP Based Message Send Service
  contents:
  - "TCP Based Message Send Service\n   One message send service is defined as a connection\
    \ based application\n   on TCP.  A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port\
    \ 18.  Once a\n   connection is established a short message is sent by the client\
    \ out\n   the connection (and any data received by the client is thrown away).\n\
    \   The client closes the connection after sending the message.\n"
- title: UDP Based Message Send Service
  contents:
  - "UDP Based Message Send Service\n   Another message send service is defined as\
    \ a datagram based\n   application on UDP.  A server listens for UDP datagrams\
    \ on UDP port\n   18.  When a datagram is received by the server, an answering\
    \ datagram\n   is sent back to the client containing exactly the same data.\n"
- title: Message Syntax
  contents:
  - "Message Syntax\n   The message should consist of several parts.  The first part\
    \ is a\n   single octet indicating the protocol revision, currently decimal 65,\n\
    \   'A'.  The second part is the name of the user that the message is\n   directed\
    \ to.  This and the remaining parts are null-terminated, and\n   consist of eight-bit\
    \ characters.  Do not strip the eighth bit of the\n   characters.  The third part\
    \ is the name of the terminal.  The fourth\n   part is the actual message.\n \
    \  The total length of the message shall be less than 512 octets.  This\n   includes\
    \ all four parts, and any terminating nulls.\n   If the terminal part is empty,\
    \ then \"the right\" terminal is chosen.\n   If the user part is empty, then the\
    \ message is written on the\n   console.\n   If this protocol is changed, the\
    \ revision number will be changed.  In\n   no case will any of the four parts\
    \ be removed.\n"
- title: Advisories
  contents:
  - "Advisories\n   It is advisable for servers to strip escape sequences before sending\n\
    \   them to actual terminals.  Some terminals can do nasty things when\n   you\
    \ send them certain escape sequence.\n   In both the TCP and UDP versions of the\
    \ service, checksums are always\n   used.\n"
