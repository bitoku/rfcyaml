- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are a number of considerations that factor into address\n\
    \   assignment policies.  For example, to provide for the long-term\n   health\
    \ and scalability of the public routing infrastructure, it is\n   important that\
    \ addresses aggregate well [ROUTE-SCALING].  Likewise,\n   giving out an excessive\
    \ amount of address space could result in\n   premature depletion of the address\
    \ space.  This document focuses on\n   the (more narrow) question of what is an\
    \ appropriate IPv6 address\n   assignment size for end sites.  That is, when end\
    \ sites request IPv6\n   address space from ISPs, what is an appropriate assignment\
    \ size.\n   RFC 3177 [RFC3177] called for a default end site IPv6 assignment size\n\
    \   of /48.  Subsequently, the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)\n   developed\
    \ and adopted IPv6 address assignment and allocation policies\n   consistent with\
    \ the recommendations of RFC 3177 [RIR-IPV6].  In 2005,\n   the RIRs began discussing\
    \ IPv6 address assignment policy again.\n   Since then, APNIC [APNIC-ENDSITE],\
    \ ARIN [ARIN-ENDSITE], and RIPE\n   [RIPE-ENDSITE] have revised the end site assignment\
    \ policy to\n   encourage the assignment of smaller (i.e., /56) blocks to end\
    \ sites.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 3177, updating its recommendations in\
    \ the\n   following ways:\n      1) It is no longer recommended that /128s be\
    \ given out.  While\n         there may be some cases where assigning only a single\
    \ address\n         may be justified, a site, by definition, implies multiple\n\
    \         subnets and multiple devices.\n      2) RFC 3177 specifically recommended\
    \ using prefix lengths of /48,\n         /64, and /128.  Specifying a small number\
    \ of fixed boundaries\n         has raised concerns that implementations and operational\n\
    \         practices might become \"hard-coded\" to recognize only those\n    \
    \     fixed boundaries (i.e., a return to \"classful addressing\").\n        \
    \ The actual intention has always been that there be no hard-\n         coded\
    \ boundaries within addresses, and that Classless Inter-\n         Domain Routing\
    \ (CIDR) continues to apply to all bits of the\n         routing prefixes.\n \
    \     3) This document moves away from the previous recommendation that\n    \
    \     a single default assignment size (e.g., a /48) makes sense for\n       \
    \  all end sites in the general case.  End sites come in different\n         shapes\
    \ and sizes, and a one-size-fits-all approach is not\n         necessary or appropriate.\n\
    \   This document does, however, reaffirm an important assumption behind\n   RFC\
    \ 3177:\n      A key principle for address management is that end sites always\
    \ be\n      able to obtain a reasonable amount of address space for their\n  \
    \    actual and planned usage, and over time ranges specified in years\n     \
    \ rather than just months.  In practice, that means at least one\n      /64, and\
    \ in most cases significantly more.  One particular\n      situation that must\
    \ be avoided is having an end site feel\n      compelled to use IPv6-to-IPv6 Network\
    \ Address Translation or other\n      burdensome address conservation techniques\
    \ because it could not\n      get sufficient address space.\n   This document\
    \ does not make a formal recommendation on what the exact\n   assignment size\
    \ should be.  The exact choice of how much address\n   space to assign end sites\
    \ is an issue for the operational community.\n   The IETF's role in this case\
    \ is limited to providing guidance on IPv6\n   architectural and operational considerations.\
    \  This document provides\n   input into those discussions.  The focus of this\
    \ document is to\n   examine the architectural issues and some of the operational\n\
    \   considerations relating to the size of the end site assignment.\n"
- title: 2.  On /48 Assignments to End Sites
  contents:
  - "2.  On /48 Assignments to End Sites\n   Looking back at some of the original\
    \ motivations behind the /48\n   recommendation [RFC3177], there were three main\
    \ concerns.  The first\n   motivation was to ensure that end sites could easily\
    \ obtain\n   sufficient address space without having to \"jump through hoops\"\
    \ to do\n   so.  For example, if someone felt they needed more space, just the\n\
    \   act of asking would at some level be sufficient justification.  As a\n   comparison\
    \ point, in IPv4, typical home users are given a single\n   public IP address\
    \ (though even this is not always assured), but\n   getting any more than one\
    \ address is often difficult or even\n   impossible -- unless one is willing to\
    \ pay a (significantly)\n   increased fee for what is often considered to be a\
    \ \"higher grade\" of\n   service.  (It should be noted that increased ISP charges\
    \ to obtain a\n   small number of additional addresses cannot usually be justified\
    \ by\n   the real per-address cost levied by RIRs, but additional addresses\n\
    \   are frequently only available to end users as part of a different\n   type\
    \ or \"higher grade\" of service, for which an additional charge is\n   levied.\
    \  The point here is that the additional cost is not due to the\n   RIR fee structures,\
    \ but to business choices ISPs make.) An important\n   goal in IPv6 is to significantly\
    \ change the default and minimal end\n   site assignment, from \"a single address\"\
    \ to \"multiple networks\" and\n   to ensure that end sites can easily obtain\
    \ address space.\n   A second motivation behind the original /48 recommendation\
    \ was to\n   simplify the management of an end site's addressing plan in the\n\
    \   presence of renumbering (e.g., when switching ISPs).  In IPv6, a site\n  \
    \ may simultaneously use multiple prefixes, including one or more\n   public prefixes\
    \ from ISPs as well as Unique Local Addresses\n   [ULA-ADDRESSES].  In the presence\
    \ of multiple prefixes, it is\n   significantly less complex to manage a numbering\
    \ plan if the same\n   subnet numbering plan can be used for all prefixes.  That\
    \ is, for a\n   link that has (say) three different prefixes assigned to it, the\n\
    \   subnet portion of those prefixes would be identical for all assigned\n   addresses.\
    \  In contrast, renumbering from a larger set of \"subnet\n   bits\" into a smaller\
    \ set is often painful, as it can require making\n   changes to the network itself\
    \ (e.g., collapsing subnets).  Hence,\n   renumbering a site into a prefix that\
    \ has (at least) the same number\n   of subnet bits is more straightforward, because\
    \ only the top-level\n   bits of the address need to change.  A key goal of the\n\
    \   recommendations in RFC 3177 is to ensure that upon renumbering, one\n   does\
    \ not have to deal with renumbering into a smaller subnet size.\n   It should\
    \ be noted that similar arguments apply to the management of\n   zone files in\
    \ the DNS.  In particular, managing the reverse\n   (ip6.arpa) tree is simplified\
    \ when all links are numbered using the\n   same subnet ids.\n   A third motivation\
    \ behind the /48 recommendation was to better\n   support network growth common\
    \ at many sites.  In IPv4, it is usually\n   difficult (or impossible) to obtain\
    \ public address space for more\n   than a few months worth of projected growth.\
    \  Thus, even slow growth\n   over several years can lead to the need to renumber\
    \ into a larger\n   address block.  With IPv6's vast address space, end sites\
    \ can easily\n   be given more address space (compared with IPv4) to support expected\n\
    \   growth over multi-year time periods.\n   While the /48 recommendation does\
    \ simplify address space management\n   for end sites, it has also been widely\
    \ criticized as being wasteful.\n   For example, a large business (which may have\
    \ thousands of employees)\n   would, by default, receive the same amount of address\
    \ space as a home\n   user, who today typically has a single (or small number\
    \ of) LAN and a\n   small number of devices (dozens or less).  While it seems\
    \ likely that\n   the size of a typical home network will grow over the next few\n\
    \   decades, it is hard to argue that home sites will make use of 65K\n   subnets\
    \ within the foreseeable future.  At the same time, it might be\n   tempting to\
    \ give home sites a single /64, since that is already\n   significantly more address\
    \ space compared with today's IPv4 practice.\n   However, this precludes the expectation\
    \ that even home sites will\n   grow to support multiple subnets going forward.\
    \  Hence, it is\n   strongly intended that even home sites be given multiple subnets\n\
    \   worth of space, by default.  Hence, this document still recommends\n   giving\
    \ home sites significantly more than a single /64, but does not\n   recommend\
    \ that every home site be given a /48 either.\n   A change in policy (such as\
    \ above) would have a significant impact on\n   address consumption projections\
    \ and the expected longevity for IPv6.\n   For example, changing the default assignment\
    \ from a /48 to /56 (for\n   the vast majority of end sites, e.g., home sites)\
    \ would result in a\n   savings of up to 8 bits, reducing the \"total projected\
    \ address\n   consumption\" by (up to) 8 bits or two orders of magnitude.  (The\n\
    \   exact amount of savings depends on the relative number of home users\n   compared\
    \ with the number of larger sites.)\n   The above-mentioned goals of RFC 3177\
    \ can easily be met by giving\n   home users a default assignment of less than\
    \ /48, such as a /56.\n"
- title: 3.  Other RFC 3177 Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Other RFC 3177 Considerations\n   RFC 3177 suggested that some multihoming\
    \ approaches (e.g.,\n   Generalized Structure Element (GSE)) might benefit from\
    \ having a\n   fixed /48 boundary.  This no longer appears to be a consideration.\n\
    \   RFC 3177 argued that having a \"one-size-fits-all\" default assignment\n \
    \  size reduced the need for customers to continually or repeatedly\n   justify\
    \ the usage of existing address space in order to get \"a little\n   more\". \
    \ Likewise, it also reduces the need for ISPs to evaluate such\n   requests. \
    \ Given the large amount of address space in IPv6, there is\n   plenty of space\
    \ to grant end sites enough space to be consistent with\n   reasonable growth\
    \ projections over multi-year time frames.  Thus, it\n   remains highly desirable\
    \ to provide end sites with enough space (on\n   both initial and subsequent assignments)\
    \ to last several years.\n   Fortunately, this goal can be achieved in a number\
    \ of ways and does\n   not require that all end sites receive the same default\
    \ size\n   assignment.\n"

- title: 5.  Summary
  contents:
  - "5.  Summary\n   The exact choice of how much address space to assign end sites\
    \ is an\n   issue for the operational community.  The recommendation in RFC 3177\n\
    \   [RFC3177] to assign /48s as a default is not a requirement of the\n   IPv6\
    \ architecture; anything of length /64 or shorter works from a\n   standards perspective.\
    \  However, there are important operational\n   considerations as well, some of\
    \ which are important if users are to\n   share in the key benefit of IPv6: expanding\
    \ the usable address space\n   of the Internet.  The IETF recommends that any\
    \ policy on IPv6 address\n   assignment policy to end sites take into consideration\
    \ the following:\n      - it should be easy for an end site to obtain address\
    \ space to\n        number multiple subnets (i.e., a block larger than a single\
    \ /64)\n        and to support reasonable growth projections over long time\n\
    \        periods (e.g., a decade or more).\n      - the default assignment size\
    \ should take into consideration the\n        likelihood that an end site will\
    \ have need for multiple subnets\n        in the future and avoid the IPv4 practice\
    \ of having frequent and\n        continual justification for obtaining small\
    \ amounts of\n        additional space.\n      - Although a /64 can (in theory)\
    \ address an almost unlimited\n        number of devices, sites should be given\
    \ sufficient address\n        space to be able to lay out subnets as appropriate,\
    \ and not be\n        forced to use address conservation techniques such as using\n\
    \        bridging.  Whether or not bridging is an appropriate choice is\n    \
    \    an end site matter.\n      - assigning a longer prefix to an end site, compared\
    \ with the\n        existing prefixes the end site already has assigned to it,\
    \ is\n        likely to increase operational costs and complexity for the end\n\
    \        site, with insufficient benefit to anyone.\n      - the operational considerations\
    \ of managing and delegating the\n        reverse DNS tree under ip6.arpa on nibble\
    \ versus non-nibble\n        boundaries should be given adequate consideration.\n"
