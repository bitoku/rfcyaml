- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   For the purposes of this document, an enterprise is an entity\n\
    \   autonomously operating a network using TCP/IP and in particular\n   determining\
    \ the addressing plan and address assignments within that\n   network.\n   This\
    \ document describes address allocation for private internets. The\n   allocation\
    \ permits full network layer connectivity among all hosts\n   inside an enterprise\
    \ as well as among all public hosts of different\n   enterprises. The cost of\
    \ using private internet address space is the\n   potentially costly effort to\
    \ renumber hosts and networks between\n   public and private.\n"
- title: 2. Motivation
  contents:
  - "2. Motivation\n   With the proliferation of TCP/IP technology worldwide, including\n\
    \   outside the Internet itself, an increasing number of non-connected\n   enterprises\
    \ use this technology and its addressing capabilities for\n   sole intra-enterprise\
    \ communications, without any intention to ever\n   directly connect to other\
    \ enterprises or the Internet itself.\n   The Internet has grown beyond anyone's\
    \ expectations. Sustained\n   exponential growth continues to introduce new challenges.\
    \  One\n   challenge is a concern within the community that globally unique\n\
    \   address space will be exhausted. A separate and far more pressing\n   concern\
    \ is that the amount of routing overhead will grow beyond the\n   capabilities\
    \ of Internet Service Providers. Efforts are in progress\n   within the community\
    \ to find long term solutions to both of these\n   problems. Meanwhile it is necessary\
    \ to revisit address allocation\n   procedures, and their impact on the Internet\
    \ routing system.\n   To contain growth of routing overhead, an Internet Provider\
    \ obtains a\n   block of address space from an address registry, and then assigns\
    \ to\n   its customers addresses from within that block based on each customer\n\
    \   requirement. The result of this process is that routes to many\n   customers\
    \ will be aggregated together, and will appear to other\n   providers as a single\
    \ route [RFC1518], [RFC1519].  In order for route\n   aggregation to be effective,\
    \ Internet providers encourage customers\n   joining their network to use the\
    \ provider's block, and thus renumber\n   their computers. Such encouragement\
    \ may become a requirement in the\n   future.\n   With the current size of the\
    \ Internet and its growth rate it is no\n   longer realistic to assume that by\
    \ virtue of acquiring globally\n   unique IP addresses out of an Internet registry\
    \ an organization that\n   acquires such addresses would have Internet-wide IP\
    \ connectivity once\n   the organization gets connected to the Internet. To the\
    \ contrary, it\n   is quite likely that when the organization would connect to\
    \ the\n   Internet to achieve Internet-wide IP connectivity the organization\n\
    \   would need to change IP addresses (renumber) all of its public hosts\n   (hosts\
    \ that require Internet-wide IP connectivity), regardless of\n   whether the addresses\
    \ used by the organization initially were\n   globally unique or not.\n   It has\
    \ been typical to assign globally unique addresses to all hosts\n   that use TCP/IP.\
    \ In order to extend the life of the IPv4 address\n   space, address registries\
    \ are requiring more justification than ever\n   before, making it harder for\
    \ organizations to acquire additional\n   address space [RFC1466].\n   Hosts within\
    \ enterprises that use IP can be partitioned into three\n   categories:\n    \
    \  Category 1: hosts that do not require access to hosts in other\n          \
    \        enterprises or the Internet at large; hosts within\n                \
    \  this category may use IP addresses that are\n                  unambiguous\
    \ within an enterprise, but may be\n                  ambiguous between enterprises.\n\
    \      Category 2: hosts that need access to a limited set of outside\n      \
    \            services (e.g., E-mail, FTP, netnews, remote login)\n           \
    \       which can be handled by mediating gateways (e.g.,\n                  application\
    \ layer gateways). For many hosts in this\n                  category an unrestricted\
    \ external access (provided\n                  via IP connectivity) may be unnecessary\
    \ and even\n                  undesirable for privacy/security reasons. Just like\n\
    \                  hosts within the first category, such hosts may use\n     \
    \             IP addresses that are unambiguous within an\n                  enterprise,\
    \ but may be ambiguous between\n                  enterprises.\n      Category\
    \ 3: hosts that need network layer access outside the\n                  enterprise\
    \ (provided via IP connectivity); hosts in\n                  the last category\
    \ require IP addresses that are\n                  globally unambiguous.\n   We\
    \ will refer to the hosts in the first and second categories as\n   \"private\"\
    .  We will refer to the hosts in the third category as\n   \"public\".\n   Many\
    \ applications require connectivity only within one enterprise and\n   do not\
    \ need external (outside the enterprise) connectivity for the\n   majority of\
    \ internal hosts. In larger enterprises it is often easy to\n   identify a substantial\
    \ number of hosts using TCP/IP that do not need\n   network layer connectivity\
    \ outside the enterprise.\n   Some examples, where external connectivity might\
    \ not be required,\n   are:\n         - A large airport which has its arrival/departure\
    \ displays\n           individually addressable via TCP/IP. It is very unlikely\n\
    \           that these displays need to be directly accessible from\n        \
    \   other networks.\n         - Large organizations like banks and retail chains\
    \ are\n           switching to TCP/IP for their internal communication. Large\n\
    \           numbers of local workstations like cash registers, money\n       \
    \    machines, and equipment at clerical positions rarely need\n           to\
    \ have such connectivity.\n         - For security reasons, many enterprises use\
    \ application\n           layer gateways to connect their internal network to\
    \ the\n           Internet.  The internal network usually does not have\n    \
    \       direct access to the Internet, thus only one or more\n           gateways\
    \ are visible from the Internet. In this case, the\n           internal network\
    \ can use non-unique IP network numbers.\n         - Interfaces of routers on\
    \ an internal network usually do not\n           need to be directly accessible\
    \ from outside the enterprise.\n"
- title: 3. Private Address Space
  contents:
  - "3. Private Address Space\n   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has\
    \ reserved the\n   following three blocks of the IP address space for private\
    \ internets:\n     10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)\n     172.16.0.0\
    \      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)\n     192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255\
    \ (192.168/16 prefix)\n   We will refer to the first block as \"24-bit block\"\
    , the second as\n   \"20-bit block\", and to the third as \"16-bit\" block. Note\
    \ that (in\n   pre-CIDR notation) the first block is nothing but a single class\
    \ A\n   network number, while the second block is a set of 16 contiguous\n   class\
    \ B network numbers, and third block is a set of 256 contiguous\n   class C network\
    \ numbers.\n   An enterprise that decides to use IP addresses out of the address\n\
    \   space defined in this document can do so without any coordination\n   with\
    \ IANA or an Internet registry. The address space can thus be used\n   by many\
    \ enterprises. Addresses within this private address space will\n   only be unique\
    \ within the enterprise, or the set of enterprises which\n   choose to cooperate\
    \ over this space so they may communicate with each\n   other in their own private\
    \ internet.\n   As before, any enterprise that needs globally unique address space\
    \ is\n   required to obtain such addresses from an Internet registry. An\n   enterprise\
    \ that requests IP addresses for its external connectivity\n   will never be assigned\
    \ addresses from the blocks defined above.\n   In order to use private address\
    \ space, an enterprise needs to\n   determine which hosts do not need to have\
    \ network layer connectivity\n   outside the enterprise in the foreseeable future\
    \ and thus could be\n   classified as private. Such hosts will use the private\
    \ address space\n   defined above.  Private hosts can communicate with all other\
    \ hosts\n   inside the enterprise, both public and private. However, they cannot\n\
    \   have IP connectivity to any host outside of the enterprise. While not\n  \
    \ having external (outside of the enterprise) IP connectivity private\n   hosts\
    \ can still have access to external services via mediating\n   gateways (e.g.,\
    \ application layer gateways).\n   All other hosts will be public and will use\
    \ globally unique address\n   space assigned by an Internet Registry. Public hosts\
    \ can communicate\n   with other hosts inside the enterprise both public and private\
    \ and\n   can have IP connectivity to public hosts outside the enterprise.\n \
    \  Public hosts do not have connectivity to private hosts of other\n   enterprises.\n\
    \   Moving a host from private to public or vice versa involves a change\n   of\
    \ IP address, changes to the appropriate DNS entries, and changes to\n   configuration\
    \ files on other hosts that reference the host by IP\n   address.\n   Because\
    \ private addresses have no global meaning, routing information\n   about private\
    \ networks shall not be propagated on inter-enterprise\n   links, and packets\
    \ with private source or destination addresses\n   should not be forwarded across\
    \ such links. Routers in networks not\n   using private address space, especially\
    \ those of Internet service\n   providers, are expected to be configured to reject\
    \ (filter out)\n   routing information about private networks. If such a router\
    \ receives\n   such information the rejection shall not be treated as a routing\n\
    \   protocol error.\n   Indirect references to such addresses should be contained\
    \ within the\n   enterprise. Prominent examples of such references are DNS Resource\n\
    \   Records and other information referring to internal private\n   addresses.\
    \ In particular, Internet service providers should take\n   measures to prevent\
    \ such leakage.\n"
- title: 4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Private Address Space
  contents:
  - "4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Private Address Space\n   The obvious\
    \ advantage of using private address space for the Internet\n   at large is to\
    \ conserve the globally unique address space by not\n   using it where global\
    \ uniqueness is not required.\n   Enterprises themselves also enjoy a number of\
    \ benefits from their\n   usage of private address space: They gain a lot of flexibility\
    \ in\n   network design by having more address space at their disposal than\n\
    \   they could obtain from the globally unique pool. This enables\n   operationally\
    \ and administratively convenient addressing schemes as\n   well as easier growth\
    \ paths.\n   For a variety of reasons the Internet has already encountered\n \
    \  situations where an enterprise that has not been connected to the\n   Internet\
    \ had used IP address space for its hosts without getting this\n   space assigned\
    \ from the IANA. In some cases this address space had\n   been already assigned\
    \ to other enterprises. If such an enterprise\n   would later connects to the\
    \ Internet, this could potentially create\n   very serious problems, as IP routing\
    \ cannot provide correct\n   operations in presence of ambiguous addressing. Although\
    \ in principle\n   Internet Service Providers should guard against such mistakes\
    \ through\n   the use of route filters, this does not always happen in practice.\n\
    \   Using private address space provides a safe choice for such\n   enterprises,\
    \ avoiding clashes once outside connectivity is needed.\n   A major drawback to\
    \ the use of private address space is that it may\n   actually reduce an enterprise's\
    \ flexibility to access the Internet.\n   Once one commits to using a private\
    \ address, one is committing to\n   renumber part or all of an enterprise, should\
    \ one decide to provide\n   IP connectivity between that part (or all of the enterprise)\
    \ and the\n   Internet.  Usually the cost of renumbering can be measured by\n\
    \   counting the number of hosts that have to transition from private to\n   public.\
    \ As was discussed earlier, however, even if a network uses\n   globally unique\
    \ addresses, it may still have to renumber in order to\n   acquire Internet-wide\
    \ IP connectivity.\n   Another drawback to the use of private address space is\
    \ that it may\n   require renumbering when merging several private internets into\
    \ a\n   single private internet. If we review the examples we list in Section\n\
    \   2, we note that companies tend to merge. If such companies prior to\n   the\
    \ merge maintained their uncoordinated internets using private\n   address space,\
    \ then if after the merge these private internets would\n   be combined into a\
    \ single private internet, some addresses within the\n   combined private internet\
    \ may not be unique. As a result, hosts with\n   these addresses would need to\
    \ be renumbered.\n   The cost of renumbering may well be mitigated by development\
    \ and\n   deployment of tools that facilitate renumbering (e.g.  Dynamic Host\n\
    \   Configuration Protocol (DHCP)). When deciding whether to use private\n   addresses,\
    \ we recommend to inquire computer and software vendors\n   about availability\
    \ of such tools.  A separate IETF effort (PIER\n   Working Group) is pursuing\
    \ full documentation of the requirements and\n   procedures for renumbering.\n"
- title: 5. Operational Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Operational Considerations\n   One possible strategy is to design the private\
    \ part of the network\n   first and use private address space for all internal\
    \ links. Then plan\n   public subnets at the locations needed and design the external\n\
    \   connectivity.\n   This design does not need to be fixed permanently. If a\
    \ group of one\n   or more hosts requires to change their status (from private\
    \ to public\n   or vice versa) later, this can be accomplished by renumbering\
    \ only\n   the hosts involved, and changing physical connectivity, if needed.\
    \ In\n   locations where such changes can be foreseen (machine rooms, etc.),\n\
    \   it is advisable to configure separate physical media for public and\n   private\
    \ subnets to facilitate such changes.  In order to avoid major\n   network disruptions,\
    \ it is advisable to group hosts with similar\n   connectivity needs on their\
    \ own subnets.\n   If a suitable subnetting scheme can be designed and is supported\
    \ by\n   the equipment concerned, it is advisable to use the 24-bit block\n  \
    \ (class A network) of private address space and make an addressing\n   plan with\
    \ a good growth path. If subnetting is a problem, the 16-bit\n   block (class\
    \ C networks), or the 20-bit block (class B networks) of\n   private address space\
    \ can be used.\n   One might be tempted to have both public and private addresses\
    \ on the\n   same physical medium. While this is possible, there are pitfalls\
    \ to\n   such a design (note that the pitfalls have nothing to do with the use\n\
    \   of private addresses, but are due to the presence of multiple IP\n   subnets\
    \ on a common Data Link subnetwork).  We advise caution when\n   proceeding in\
    \ this area.\n   It is strongly recommended that routers which connect enterprises\
    \ to\n   external networks are set up with appropriate packet and routing\n  \
    \ filters at both ends of the link in order to prevent packet and\n   routing\
    \ information leakage. An enterprise should also filter any\n   private networks\
    \ from inbound routing information in order to protect\n   itself from ambiguous\
    \ routing situations which can occur if routes to\n   the private address space\
    \ point outside the enterprise.\n   It is possible for two sites, who both coordinate\
    \ their private\n   address space, to communicate with each other over a public\
    \ network.\n   To do so they must use some method of encapsulation at their borders\n\
    \   to a public network, thus keeping their private addresses private.\n   If\
    \ two (or more) organizations follow the address allocation\n   specified in this\
    \ document and then later wish to establish IP\n   connectivity with each other,\
    \ then there is a risk that address\n   uniqueness would be violated.  To minimize\
    \ the risk it is strongly\n   recommended that an organization using private IP\
    \ addresses choose\n   randomly from the reserved pool of private addresses, when\
    \ allocating\n   sub-blocks for its internal allocation.\n   If an enterprise\
    \ uses the private address space, or a mix of private\n   and public address spaces,\
    \ then DNS clients outside of the enterprise\n   should not see addresses in the\
    \ private address space used by the\n   enterprise, since these addresses would\
    \ be ambiguous.  One way to\n   ensure this is to run two authority servers for\
    \ each DNS zone\n   containing both publically and privately addressed hosts.\
    \  One server\n   would be visible from the public address space and would contain\
    \ only\n   the subset of the enterprise's addresses which were reachable using\n\
    \   public addresses.  The other server would be reachable only from the\n   private\
    \ network and would contain the full set of data, including the\n   private addresses\
    \ and whatever public addresses are reachable the\n   private network.  In order\
    \ to ensure consistency, both servers should\n   be configured from the same data\
    \ of which the publically visible zone\n   only contains a filtered version. There\
    \ is certain degree of\n   additional complexity associated with providing these\
    \ capabilities.\n"

- title: 7. Conclusion
  contents:
  - "7. Conclusion\n   With the described scheme many large enterprises will need\
    \ only a\n   relatively small block of addresses from the globally unique IP\n\
    \   address space. The Internet at large benefits through conservation of\n  \
    \ globally unique address space which will effectively lengthen the\n   lifetime\
    \ of the IP address space. The enterprises benefit from the\n   increased flexibility\
    \ provided by a relatively large private address\n   space. However, use of private\
    \ addressing requires that an\n   organization renumber part or all of its enterprise\
    \ network, as its\n   connectivity requirements change over time.\n"
