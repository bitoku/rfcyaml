Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing devices which implement the FDDI based on the ANSI FDDI SMT 7.3 draft standard [8], which has been forwarded for publication by the X3T9.5 committee.
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: STD 16, RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
STD 16, RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
STD 15, RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
Format of Definitions Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [7].
This document defines the managed objects for FDDI devices which are to be accessible via the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
At present, this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet standard MIB: fddi(15)
For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the MIB II [4] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:
The definitions of the objects presented here draws heavily from related work in the ANSI X3T9.5 committee and the SMT subcommittee of that committee [8].
In fact, the definitions of the managed objects in this document are, to the maximum extent possible, identical to those identified by the ANSI committee.
The semantics of each managed object should be the same with syntactic changes made as necessary to recast the objects in terms of the Internet standard SMI and MIB so as to be compatible with the SNMP.
Examples of these syntactic changes include remapping booleans to enumerated integers, remapping bit strings to octet strings, and the like.
In addition, the naming of the objects was changed to achieve compatibility.
These minimal syntactic changes with no semantic changes should allow implementations of SNMP manageable FDDI systems to share instrumentation with other network management schemes and thereby minimize implementation cost.
In addition, the translation of information conveyed by managed objects from one network management scheme to another is eased by these shared definitions.
Only the essential variables, as indicated by their mandatory status in the ANSI specification, were retained in this document.
The importance of variables which have an optional status in the ANSI specification were perceived as being less widely accepted.
Several new datatypes are introduced as a textual convention in this MIB document.
These textual conventions enhance the readability of the document and ease comparisons with its ANSI counterpart.
It should be noted that the introduction of these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax or the semantics of any managed objects.
The use of these is merely an artifact of the explanatory method used.
Objects defined in terms of one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that define the primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.
The changes from RFC 1285 [2] to this document, based on changes from ANSI SMT 6.2 to SMT 7.3, were so numerous that the objects in this MIB module are located on a different branch of the MIB tree.
No assumptions should be made about compatibility with RFC 1285.
SMI OBJECT TYPE FROM RFC 1212;
This MIB module uses the extended OBJECT TYPE macro as    defined in [7].
This data type specifies 1 nanosecond units as   an integer value.
The encoding is normal integer representation, not   two's complement.
Since this type is used for variables   which are encoded as TimerTwosComplement in the ANSI   specification, two operations need to be performed on such   variables to convert from ANSI form to SNMP form:
Multiply by 80 to convert from 80 nsec to 1 nsec units
Moreover, the objects for which   this data type is used effectively do not lose any range   due to the lower maximum value since they do not require   the full range.
Example: If fddimibMACTReq had a value of 8 ms, it would   be stored in ANSI TimerTwosComplement format as 0xFFFE7960
[8 ms is 100000 in 80 nsec units, which is then converted   to two's complement] but be reported as 8000000 in SNMP   since it is encoded here as FddiTimeNano.
This data type is used for some FDDI timers.
It specifies   time in 1 millisecond units, in normal integer   representation.
This data type is used to refer to an instance of a  MAC,   PORT, or PATH Resource ID.
Zero is used to indicate the absence of a resource.
The unique identifier for the FDDI station.
This is a   string of 8 octets, represented as X' yy
xx xx' with the low order 6 octet (xx) from a unique IEEE   assigned address.
The high order two bits of the IEEE   address, the group address bit and the administration bit
(Universal/Local) bit should both be zero.
The first two   octets, the yy octets, are implementor defined.
The representation of the address portion of the station id   is in the IEEE (ANSI
canonical notation for   48 bit addresses.
The canonical form is a 6 octet string   where the first octet contains the first 8 bits of the   address, with the I/G(Individual/Group) address bit as the   least significant bit and the  U/L (Universal/Local) bit   as the next more significant bit, and so on.
Note that   addresses in the ANSI FDDI standard SMT frames are   represented in FDDI MAC order.
The representation of long MAC addresses as management   values is in the IEEE (ANSI
canonical   notation for 48 bit addresses.
The canonical form is a   6 octet string where the first octet contains the first 8   bits of the address, with the I/G (Individual/Group)
address bit as the least significant bit
and the  U/L   (Universal/Local) bit as the next more significant bit,
that the addresses in the SMT frames are   represented in FDDI MAC order.
the SMT group   Implementation of the SMT group is mandatory for all   systems which implement manageable FDDI subsystems.

"This variable is a list of permitted Paths where each list element defines the Port's permitted Paths.
The first octet corresponds to 'none', the second octet to 'tree', and the third octet to 'peer'.
ACCESS  read only STATUS  mandatory DESCRIPTION
"Indicates the MAC, if any, whose transmit path exits the station via this PORT.
The value shall be zero if there is no MAC associated with the PORT.
Otherwise, the MACIndex of the MAC will be the value of the variable."
ACCESS  read only STATUS  mandatory DESCRIPTION
"Indicates the Paths which are available to this Port.
In the absence of faults, the A and B Ports will always have both the Primary and Secondary Paths available.
The value is a sum.
This value initially takes the value zero, then for each type of PATH that this port has available, 2 raised to a power is added to the sum.
The powers are according to the following table:
INTEGER { multimode(1), single mode1(2), single mode2(3), sonet(4), low cost fiber(5), twisted pair(6), unknown(7), unspecified(8)

"This variable indicates the type of PMD entity associated with this port."
..3) ACCESS  read only STATUS  mandatory DESCRIPTION
"A value that indicates the connection capabilities of the port.
The pc mac lct bit indicates that the station has the capability of setting the PC MAC LCT Flag.
The pc mac loop bit indicates that the station has the capability of setting the PC MAC Loop Flag (refer to ANSI 9.4.3.2).
The value is a sum.
This value initially takes the value zero, then for each capability that this port has, 2 raised to a power is added to the sum.
