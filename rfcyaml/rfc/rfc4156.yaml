- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the wais Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n\
    \   scheme that was originally specified in RFC 1738.  The purpose of\n   this\
    \ document is to allow RFC 1738 to be made obsolete while keeping\n   the information\
    \ about the scheme on standards track.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   URIs were previously defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396], which\
    \ was updated\n   by RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  Those documents also specify how to\
    \ define\n   schemes for URIs.\n   The first definitions for many URI schemes\
    \ appeared in RFC 1738\n   [RFC1738].  Because that document has been made obsolete,\
    \ this\n   document copies the wais URI scheme from it to allow that material\
    \ to\n   remain on standards track.\n"
- title: 2.  Scheme Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  Scheme Definition\n   The WAIS URL scheme is used to designate WAIS databases,\
    \ searches, or\n   individual documents available from a WAIS database.  The WAIS\n\
    \   protocol is described in RFC 1625 [RFC1625].  Although the WAIS\n   protocol\
    \ is based on Z39.50-1988, the WAIS URL scheme is not intended\n   for use with\
    \ arbitrary Z39.50 services.\n   Historical note: The WAIS protocol was not widely\
    \ implemented and\n   almost no WAIS servers are in use today.\n   A WAIS URL\
    \ takes one of the following forms:\n      wais://<host>:<port>/<database>\n \
    \     wais://<host>:<port>/<database>?<search>\n      wais://<host>:<port>/<database>/<wtype>/<wpath>\n\
    \   If :<port> is omitted, the port defaults to 210.  The first form\n   designates\
    \ a WAIS database that is available for searching.  The\n   second form designates\
    \ a particular search. <database> is the name of\n   the WAIS database being queried.\n\
    \   The third form designates a particular document, within a WAIS\n   database,\
    \ to be retrieved.  In this form <wtype> is the WAIS\n   designation of the type\
    \ of the object.  Many WAIS implementations\n   require that a client know the\
    \ \"type\" of an object prior to\n   retrieval; the type is returned along with\
    \ the internal object\n   identifier in the search response.  The <wtype> is included\
    \ in the\n   URL in order to give the client interpreting the URL adequate\n \
    \  information to actually retrieve the document.\n   The <wpath> of a WAIS URL\
    \ consists of the WAIS document-id.  The WAIS\n   document-id should be treated\
    \ opaquely; it may only be decomposed by\n   the server that issued it.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Many security considerations for URI schemes\
    \ are discussed in\n   [RFC3986].  There are no security considerations listed\
    \ in [RFC1625],\n   but it should be noted that there is no privacy nor authentication\n\
    \   specified in the WAIS protocol.\n"
