  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Datatracker is a web-based system for managing\
    \ information\n   about Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and RFCs, IPR disclosures, liaison\n\
    \   statements, and several other important aspects of the IETF process\n   [IDTRACKER].\n\
    \   The Datatracker can track and report on the status of every I-D that\n   has\
    \ been submitted to the IESG for evaluation and publication.  In\n   contrast,\
    \ the tool currently has almost no ability to track the\n   status of I-Ds that\
    \ have not been submitted to the IESG. [RFC6174]\n   Document authors and others\
    \ have asked for more visibility into the\n   status and progression of IETF Working\
    \ Group (WG) drafts.\n   This document specifies requirements to extend the Datatracker\
    \ to\n   enable status tracking and reporting for WG I-Ds.  After these\n   requirements\
    \ are implemented, WG Chairs will be able to use the\n   Datatracker to provide\
    \ everyone with more information about the WG\n   status of the I-Ds associated\
    \ with their WGs than is currently\n   possible.\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The terms \"WG I-D\", \"WG document\"\
    , and \"WG draft\" are used\n   synonymously throughout this document.  The same\
    \ is true for the\n   plural case of each term.\n   A \"WG draft\" is an I-D that\
    \ has achieved consensus for adoption as a\n   work item by a WG (compared to\
    \ an individual submission I-D that has\n   not, or has not yet, achieved consensus).\n\
    \   The terms \"WG document\" and \"WG draft\" are not intended to apply to\n\
    \   any other document that may be reviewed, discussed, or produced by an\n  \
    \ IETF Working Group.  WG meeting materials such as Blue Sheets,\n   agendas,\
    \ jabber logs, scribe's notes, minutes, and presentation\n   slides are not to\
    \ be considered \"WG documents\" or \"WG drafts\" in the\n   context of this document.\n\
    \   The phrase \"WG status of an I-D\" refers to the WG state that an I-D\n  \
    \ is in per the definitions in Section 4.2 of [RFC6174].  This phrase\n   does\
    \ not refer to an I-D's availability status (e.g., \"Expired\",\n   \"Active\"\
    , \"Replaced by\") as described in Section 3.1 of [RFC6174], or\n   to any of\
    \ the IESG states used by IETF Area Directors (ADs) to\n   describe the status\
    \ of I-Ds they may be evaluating.  Note that this\n   phrase encompasses all of\
    \ the states that a WG I-D may be in, plus\n   one more (viz. \"Call for Adoption\
    \ by WG Issued\").\n   The phrase \"I-D associated with a WG\" is intended to\
    \ describe two\n   types of Internet-Drafts:\n   -  I-Ds that have been accepted\
    \ as WG drafts; and\n   -  I-Ds that are being considered under the guidance of\
    \ a WG Chair\n      for adoption by a WG.\n   An I-D having a filename that contains\
    \ the string 'draft-ietf-'\n   followed by a WG acronym is almost always a WG\
    \ draft and is to be\n   interpreted as being an \"I-D associated with a WG\"\
    \ for the purposes\n   of this document.\n   An I-D having a filename that includes\
    \ the author's name and a WG\n   acronym but does not include the string '-ietf-'\
    \ may be a candidate\n   for adoption by a WG and, if so, is also to be interpreted\
    \ as being\n   an \"I-D associated with a WG\" for the purposes of this document.\n\
    \   The requirements specified in this document use English phrases\n   ending\
    \ with \"(R-nnn)\", where \"nnn\" is a unique requirement number.\n   When used\
    \ in the context of the requirements in this document, the\n   key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\n   NOT\", and\
    \ \"MAY\" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].  RFC 2119\
    \ defines the use of these key words to help make\n   the intent of standards\
    \ track documents as clear as possible.  The\n   same key words are used in this\
    \ document to make the meaning of the\n   requirements specified herein as clear\
    \ as possible.\n"
- title: 3.  General Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  General Requirements\n   The enhancements to be made to the Datatracker described\
    \ in this\n   document MUST be implemented in a manner that provides WG Chairs\
    \ and\n   the people they designate to act as their Delegates with the option\n\
    \   to input and update the WG status of some, all, or none of the I-Ds\n   associated\
    \ with their WGs using the WG I-D states and I-D status\n   annotation tags defined\
    \ in [RFC6174] (R-001).  In other words, the\n   implementation must not require\
    \ that WG Chairs change their way of\n   working, but only provide optional features.\
    \  WG Chairs must have the\n   flexibility to use the enhancements to the Datatracker\
    \ to track the\n   WG status of their I-Ds as is most appropriate for them.\n\
    \   To ensure that at least some WG status information is tracked for\n   every\
    \ I-D associated with a WG, the Datatracker must be enhanced to\n   generate a\
    \ few automatic state transitions for every WG I-D.  The\n   requirements for\
    \ this feature are specified in Section 7 of this\n   document.\n   Requirement\
    \ R-001 SHALL NOT impair the ability of the Datatracker to\n   track and display\
    \ the availability state of any I-D (R-002).  I-D\n   availability states (e.g.,\
    \ \"Active\", \"Expired\", \"Replaces\") are\n   described in Section 3.1 of [RFC6174].\n\
    \   The Datatracker SHALL NOT permit users other than a Working Group's\n   Chairs\
    \ (e.g., the Chairs of a different IETF WG) to update the WG\n   status of a WG's\
    \ documents through the regular Datatracker interface,\n   unless the privileges\
    \ to do so have been explicitly delegated to them\n   by one of the WG's Chairs\
    \ (R-003).\n   The user interface to be provided by the Datatracker to WG Chairs\n\
    \   (and their Delegates) to input the WG status of the I-Ds associated\n   with\
    \ their WGs SHOULD have a look and feel that is similar to the\n   interface currently\
    \ used by ADs to identify the status of I-Ds under\n   formal evaluation by the\
    \ IESG (R-004).\n   Any new pages created to display the status of WG I-Ds SHOULD\
    \ be\n   designed to have a look and feel that is similar to the pages\n   currently\
    \ provided by the Datatracker to display the status of I-Ds\n   under formal evaluation\
    \ by the IESG (R-005).\n   New javascript user interface code and style sheets\
    \ implemented to\n   satisfy the requirements in this document SHOULD reuse or\
    \ share\n   existing code where practical so that when a change to the IESG\n\
    \   status of an I-D is entered into the Datatracker, the WG status\n   tracking\
    \ for that I-D can benefit, and vice versa (R-006).\n   The Datatracker MUST date\
    \ and timestamp every update to the WG status\n   of an I-D that is associated\
    \ with a WG and be able to use that\n   information when it displays the status\
    \ change history for the I-D\n   (R-007).  The WG status change history for an\
    \ I-D MUST also identify\n   the person or entity that updated the WG status of\
    \ the I-D (e.g., one\n   of the WG's Chairs, a Delegate, an AD, the System, the\
    \ IETF\n   Secretariat) and describe the change (e.g., \"WG State changed from\n\
    \   'a' to 'b'\", \"WG Annotation Tag 'x' Set (or Reset)\") (R-008).\n   The inputting\
    \ or updating of the WG status of an I-D SHALL NOT\n   overwrite any previously\
    \ archived status change history information\n   for the I-D; every update to\
    \ the WG status of an I-D MUST be added to\n   the status change history log for\
    \ the I-D (R-009).\n   WG I-D status tracking MUST be implemented per-draft, not\
    \ per-WG\n   (R-010).\n   WG I-D status tracking SHOULD be implemented as a new\
    \ front-end to\n   the Datatracker's existing IESG state machine [IESGIDSM] (R-011).\n\
    \   The Datatracker SHALL permit authorized users (e.g., WG Chairs,\n   Delegates)\
    \ to change the WG state of a draft independently from the\n   IESG state of the\
    \ same I-D and vice versa (R-012).\n"

  - "6.9.  Revised I-D Needed (Annotation Tag)\n   After an I-D is submitted to the\
    \ IESG, it may be judged as needing\n   revision before it can be published as\
    \ an RFC.  An AD or the IESG as\n   a whole may return a document to a WG for\
    \ revision.\n   An I-D that needs revision may be identified when the Responsible\
    \ AD\n   appends the \"Revised I-D Needed\" annotation tag to the IESG state of\n\
    \   the I-D.\n   If an AD or the IESG as a whole sends an I-D back to a WG for\n\
    \   revision (e.g., as described in Section 3.2 of [RFC6174]), the WG's\n   Chairs\
    \ may decide to change the WG state of the I-D from \"Submitted\n   to IESG for\
    \ Publication\" to a different state and to append one or\n   more WG I-D status\
    \ annotation tags to the I-D (e.g., per Sections\n   4.3.8 or 4.3.9 of [RFC6174]).\n\
    \   The Datatracker SHALL allow, but not require, the WG Chair or\n   Delegate\
    \ who attaches a \"Revised I-D Needed\" annotation tag to the WG\n   status of\
    \ an I-D to indicate the number of weeks they expect it will\n   take for a revised\
    \ document to be produced (R-093).  The Datatracker\n   should also prompt the\
    \ user to consider changing the WG state of the\n   I-D from \"Submitted to IESG\
    \ for Publication\" to something else (e.g.,\n   Parked WG Document, WG Document,\
    \ Waiting for WG Chair Go-Ahead)\n   (R-094).\n   If a revised version of the\
    \ I-D is not submitted to the WG before the\n   time specified in R-093 elapses,\
    \ the Datatracker SHALL send an e-mail\n   to the WG's Chairs and Delegates to\
    \ remind or 'nudge' them to\n   followup on the revisions to the document (R-095).\n\
    \   The Datatracker SHALL automatically reset or clear the \"Revised I-D\n   Needed\"\
