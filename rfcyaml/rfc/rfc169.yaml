    \       Stephen D. Crocker -- ARPA/IPT\n   The number of networks has grown to\
    \ the point where not all\n   participants are familiar with each other; more\
    \ networks are under\n   development. This workshop is intended especially for\
    \ those\n   manufactureers, users and researchers who have just entered, or are\n\
    \   about to enter, the network field.  Presentations are invited on all\n   aspects\
    \ of computer networks, particularly including user\n   communities, inter-node\
    \ protocols, terminal and switching equipments,\n   and communications technology.\n\
    \   Presentations on embryonic systems are especially invited.\n   Tentative Agenda\n\
    \   Session I and II -- Description of Specific Systems\n   Presentation of specific\
    \ systems with emphasis on such topics as the\n   aim of the system and scope;\
    \ the constraints applied by the\n   application; the equipment used; protocols;\
    \ expected lifetime; etc.\n   Session III -- Functional Capabilities - Alan Weis\
    \ - IBM Research\n   This session will discuss such topics as file transmission,\
    \ the\n   referencing of foreign data sets, remote job entry protocols,\n   resource\
    \ control, data standards, etc.\n   Session IV -- Limitations of Hardware and\
    \ Software Systems for\n   Networks - Al Irvine - NCR\n   Multiplexers, terminals,\
    \ software systems, and hardware design will\n   be among the topics discussed\
    \ at this session.\n   Panel Session -- Network Management Problems - Einar Stefferud\
    \ -\n   Consultant\n   Participation in the workshop will be by invitation from\
    \ the program\n   committee and will be limited to 65 persons, in order to facilitiate\n\
    \   discussion.  To encourage free discussion of tentative conclusions,\n   no\
    \ workshop proceedings will be published.  The workshop should\n   stimulate generation\
    \ of high quality papers for subsequent\n   publications.\n   Should you desire\
    \ to participate in this workshop, please return the\n   attached questionnaire\
    \ to the program committee prior to 20 July\n   1971.  Be sure to arrange any\
    \ release required by your organization.\n   A registration fee of $45 includes\
    \ means and housing.\n   Invitations will be mailed to selected participants approximately\
    \ 15\n   August 1971.  Whether or not you plan to participate, please call\n \
    \  this announcement to the attention of qualified colleagues who have\n   been\

    \       '\n                   GENERAL INFORMATION ON IEEE WORKSHOPS\n   What is\
    \ a Workshop?\n   The objectives of these workshops are:\n      To clarify, by\
    \ exhaustive and off-the-record discussion between\n      active workers in the\
    \ field, the merits and disadvantages of\n      controversial alternative approaches\
    \ to a specific phase of\n      computer organization, and to establish the basis\
    \ for a group of\n      high-quality papers for IEEE meetings and publications.\n\
    \   The workshop involves four (4) key concepts:\n   1.  Small number of participants\
    \ to permit exhaustive discussion:\n   2.  Off-the-record proceedings to allow\
    \ discussion of incomplete and\n       preliminary results:\n   3.  Selected mature\
    \ participants to obviate the need for tutorial and\n       introductory material:\n\
    \   4.  A carefully defined topic to keep the discussion in focus.\n   Off-The-Record\
    \ Meetings\n   To permit discussion of incomplete and tentative results, information\n\
    \   at the workshop cannot be published.  Slides or blackboards may not\n   be\
    \ photographed so the workshop does not constitute disclosure in the\n   sense\
    \ of the Patent Law.  After the meeting, participants are\n   encouraged to publish\
    \ significant contributions.\n   Selected Participants\n   By limiting the workshop\
    \ to a small number of active workers, mature\n   scientists knowledgeable in\
    \ the specific area under discussion,\n   formal papers can be displaced by brief\
    \ opening statements followed\n   by an open discussion.\n   General Information\
    \ on IEEE Workshops\n   Page 2.\n   Publication of Results\n   One measure of\
    \ the success of a workshop is the resulting publication\n   of research.  While\
    \ the workshop itself is closed, it should serve as\n   a stimulus to generate\
    \ a series of high-quality papers for subsequent\n   open meetings.\n   Session\
    \ Organization\n   The workshop is divided into four (4) scheduled sessions, each\n\
    \   centered on one phase of the problem to be discussed.  Normally, the\n   workshop\
    \ chairman will assign to each session chairman the task of\n   clarifying the\
    \ subsidiary questions to be discussed in his session.\n   Each session is divided\
    \ into \"talks.\" The speakers are designated as\n   discussion leaders.  Most\
    \ participants at the workshop will be\n   discussion leaders at one of the sessions.\
    \  The session chairman will\n   attempt to provide each speaker with the time\
    \ he requests (within\n   limits).  Normally, five to ten minutes will be allowed\
    \ for formal\n   presentation, with 15 to 30 minutes reserved for discussion and\n\
    \   debate.  In addition, the chairman may include a general discussion\n   period\
    \ at the end of the session.\n"
