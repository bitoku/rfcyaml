  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n
    \  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community\n   In
    particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the\n   Border Gateway
    Protocol Version 4 or lower.\n   The origin of this memo is from RFC 1269 \"Definitions
    of Managed\n   Objects for the Border Gateway Protocol (Version 3)\", which was\n
    \  updated to support BGP-4 in RFC 1657.  This memo fixes errors\n   introduced
    when the MIB module was converted to use the SMIv2\n   language.  This memo also
    updates references to the current SNMP\n   framework documents.\n   This memo
    is intended to document deployed implementations of this\n   MIB module in a historical
    context, to provide clarifications of some\n   items, and to note errors where
    the MIB module fails to fully\n   represent the BGP protocol.  Work is currently
    in progress to replace\n   this MIB module with a new one representing the current
    state of the\n   BGP protocol and its extensions.\n   This document obsoletes
    RFC 1269 and RFC 1657.\n"

  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of
    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "3.  Overview\n   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP-4 implementation.\n
    \  Apart from a few system-wide scalar objects, this MIB is broken into\n   three
    tables: the BGP Peer Table, the BGP Received Path Attribute\n   Table, and the
    BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table.  The BGP Peer\n   Table contains information
    about state and current activity of\n   connections with the BGP peers.  The BGP
    Received Path Attribute\n   Table contains path attributes received from all peers
    running BGP\n   version 3 or less.  The BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table contains\n
    \  path attributes received from all BGP-4 peers.  The actual attributes\n   used
    in determining a route are a subset of the received attribute\n   tables after
    local routing policy has been applied.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB relates to a system providing inter-domain
    routing.  As\n   such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this
    MIB\n   may result in denial of service to a large number of end-users.\n   There
    are several management objects defined in this MIB that have a\n   MAX-ACCESS
    clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects\n   should be considered
    sensitive or vulnerable in most network\n   environments.  The support for SET
    operations in a non-secure\n   environment without proper protection can have
    a negative effect on\n   network operations.  These objects include:\n      o
    bgpPeerAdminStatus\n        Improper change of bgpPeerAdminStatus, from start
    to stop, can\n        cause significant disruption of the connectivity to those\n
    \       portions of the Internet reached via the applicable remote BGP\n        peer.\n
    \     o bgpPeerConnectRetryInterval\n        Improper change of this object can
    cause connections to be\n        disrupted for extremely long time periods when
    otherwise they\n        would be restored in a relatively short period of time.\n
    \     o bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured, bgpPeerKeepAliveConfigured\n        Misconfiguration
    of these objects can make BGP sessions more\n        fragile and less resilient
    to denial of service attacks on the\n        inter-domain routing system.\n      o
    bgpPeerMinASOriginationInterval,\n        bgpPeerMinRouteAdvertisementInterval\n
    \       Misconfiguration of these objects may adversely affect global\n        Internet
    convergence of the routes advertised by this BGP\n        speaker.  This may result
    in long-lived routing loops and\n        blackholes for the portions of the Internet
    that utilize these\n        routes.\n   There are a number of managed objects
    in this MIB that contain\n   sensitive information regarding the operation of
    a network.  For\n   example, a BGP peer's local and remote addresses might be
    sensitive\n   for ISPs who want to keep interface addresses on routers confidential\n
    \  in order to prevent router addresses used for a denial of service\n   attack
    or spoofing.\n   Therefore, it is important in most environments to control read\n
    \  access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of\n   these
    object when sending them over the network via SNMP.\n   SNMP versions prior to
    SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure
    (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on
    the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider
    the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],
    section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
    (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy
    SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n"
