  - "1.  Introduction\n   The iCalendar [RFC5545] data format is used to represent
    calendar\n   data and is used with the iCalendar Transport-Independent\n   Interoperability
    Protocol (iTIP) [RFC5546] to handle scheduling\n   operations between calendar
    users. iCalendar is in widespread use,\n   and in accordance with provisions in
    that specification, extension\n   elements have been added by various vendors
    to the data format in\n   order to support and enhance capabilities.  This specification\n
    \  collects a number of these ad hoc extensions and uses the new IANA\n   registry
    capability defined in [RFC5545] to register standard\n   variants with clearly
    defined definitions and semantics.  In\n   addition, some new elements are introduced
    for features that vendors\n   have recently been requesting.\n"

    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n   The notation used in this memo
    is the ABNF notation of [RFC5234] as\n   used by iCalendar [RFC5545].  Any syntax
    elements shown below that\n   are not explicitly defined in this specification
    come from iCalendar\n   [RFC5545].\n"
  title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
- contents:
  - "3.  Backwards-Compatible Extension Properties\n   iCalendar defines properties
    that can have different value types\n   indicated by a \"VALUE\" parameter.  The
    definition of a property\n   specifies a \"default\" value type that is assumed
    to be used when no\n   \"VALUE\" parameter is present.  However, this poses a
    problem to the\n   iCalendar parser/generator software that does not know about
    the\n   default values for new properties.  For example, if a new property\n   \"FOO\"
    were defined with a default value type of URI and a URI value\n   with a comma
    was used, an iCalendar generator not aware of this fact\n   would likely treat
    the property value as \"TEXT\" and apply backslash\n   escaping to the comma in
    the value, effectively making it an invalid\n   URI value.\n   To avoid this problem,
    this specification recommends that all\n   properties not defined in [RFC5545]
    always include a \"VALUE\"\n   parameter if the type is other than \"TEXT\".  That
    is, in the example\n   above, the \"FOO\" property would have a \"VALUE=URI\"
    parameter.  This\n   allows iCalendar parser/generator software to track the correct
    types\n   of unknown properties.\n   New properties defined in this specification
    use the term \"no\n   default\" in the \"Value Type\" definition to indicate that
    the \"VALUE\"\n   parameter has to be included.\n"

      be specified multiple times in an\n      iCalendar object.  However, each property
      MUST represent the name\n      of the calendar in a different language.\n   Description:
      \ This property is used to specify a name of the\n      iCalendar object that
      can be used by calendar user agents when\n      presenting the calendar data
      to a user.  Whilst a calendar only\n      has a single name, multiple language
      variants can be specified by\n      including this property multiple times with

      the \"DESCRIPTION\"\n   property to allow it to be defined in an iCalendar object.
      \ The\n   following additions are made to the definition of this property,\n
      \  originally specified in Section 3.8.1.5 of [RFC5545].\n   Purpose:  This
      property specifies the description of the calendar.\n   Conformance:  This property
      can be specified multiple times in an\n      iCalendar object.  However, each
      property MUST represent the\n      description of the calendar in a different
      language.\n   Description:  This property is used to specify a lengthy textual\n
      \     description of the iCalendar object that can be used by calendar\n      user
      agents when describing the nature of the calendar data to a\n      user.  Whilst

    - "5.3.  UID Property\n   This specification modifies the definition of the \"UID\"
      property to\n   allow it to be defined in an iCalendar object.  The following\n
      \  additions are made to the definition of this property, originally\n   specified
      in Section 3.8.4.7 of [RFC5545].\n   Purpose:  This property specifies the persistent,
      globally unique\n      identifier for the iCalendar object.  This can be used,
      for\n      example, to identify duplicate calendar streams that a client may\n
      \     have been given access to.  It can be used in conjunction with the\n      \"LAST-MODIFIED\"
      property also specified on the \"VCALENDAR\" object\n      to identify the most
      recent version of a calendar.\n   Conformance:  This property can be specified
      once in an iCalendar\n      object.\n   The description of the \"UID\" property
      in [RFC5545] contains some\n   recommendations on how the value can be constructed.
      \ In particular,\n   it suggests use of host names, IP addresses, and domain
      names to\n   construct the value.  However, this is no longer considered good\n
      \  practice, particularly from a security and privacy standpoint, since\n   use
      of such values can leak key information about a calendar user or\n   their client
      and network environment.  This specification updates\n   [RFC5545] by stating
      that \"UID\" values MUST NOT include any data that\n   might identify a user,
      host, domain, or any other security- or\n   privacy-sensitive information.  It
      is RECOMMENDED that calendar user\n   agents now generate \"UID\" values that
      are hex-encoded random\n   Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) values as defined
      in\n   Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of [RFC4122].\n   The following is an example of
      such a property value:\n   UID:5FC53010-1267-4F8E-BC28-1D7AE55A7C99\n   Additionally,
      if calendar user agents choose to use other forms of\n   opaque identifiers
      for the \"UID\" value, they MUST have a length less\n   than 255 octets and
      MUST conform to the \"iana-token\" ABNF syntax\n   defined in Section 3.1 of
      [RFC5545].\n"

      property specifies information for accessing a\n      conferencing system.\n
      \  Value Type:  URI -- no default.\n   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard,
      feature, and label property\n      parameters can be specified on this property.\n
      \  Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in a\n      \"VEVENT\"
      or \"VTODO\" calendar component.\n   Description:  This property specifies information
      for accessing a\n      conferencing system for attendees of a meeting or task.
      \ This\n      might be for a telephone-based conference number dial-in with\n
      \     access codes included (such as a tel: URI [RFC3966] or a sip: or\n      sips:

      URI [RFC7230]), or for an instant messaging group chat\n      room (such as
      an xmpp: URI [RFC5122]).  If a specific URI for a\n      conferencing system
      is not available, a data: URI [RFC2397]\n      containing a text description
      can be used.\n      A conference system can be a bidirectional communication
      channel\n      or a uni-directional \"broadcast feed\".\n      The \"FEATURE\"
      property parameter is used to describe the key\n      capabilities of the conference
      system to allow a client to choose\n      the ones that give the required level
      of interaction from a set of\n      multiple properties.\n      The \"LABEL\"
      property parameter is used to convey additional\n      details on the use of
      the URI.  For example, the URIs or access\n      codes for the moderator and
      attendee of a teleconference system\n      could be different, and the \"LABEL\"
      property parameter could be\n      used to \"tag\" each \"CONFERENCE\" property

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Several of the new properties or parameters defined
    by this\n   specification allow reference to \"external\" URIs.  Care MUST be
    taken\n   when accessing data at external URIs as malicious content could be\n
    \  present.  Clients SHOULD ensure that suitable permission is granted\n   by
    calendar users before such URIs are dereferenced.\n   The \"REFRESH-INTERVAL\"
    property could be used by an attacker to make\n   a client carry out rapid requests
    to the server hosting the calendar\n   by specifying a very short duration (e.g.,
    one second).  This could\n   lead to resource consumption on the client or server
    and to denial-\n   of-service attacks against the server.  Clients MUST ensure
    that they\n   throttle requests to the server to a reasonable rate.  In most cases,\n
    \  updating a public calendar once per day would suffice.  If the\n   \"REFRESH-INTERVAL\"
    is any less than that, clients SHOULD warn the\n   calendar user and allow them
    to override it with a longer value.\n   The \"CONFERENCE\" property can include
    a \"FEATURE\" property parameter\n   with a \"MODERATOR\" value.  In some cases,
    the access code used by the\n   owner/initiator of a conference might be private
    to an individual,\n   and clients and servers MUST ensure that such properties
    are not sent\n   to attendees of a scheduled component.\n   Both the \"COLOR\"
    and \"IMAGE\" properties are likely to be used by\n   calendar users to express
    their own personal view of the calendar\n   data.  In addition, these properties
    could be used by attackers to\n   produce a confusing display in a calendar user
    agent.  When such\n   properties are encountered in calendar data that has come
    from other\n   calendar users (e.g., via a scheduling message, \"public\" calendar\n
    \  subscription, etc.), it is advisable for the client to give the\n   receiving
    calendar user the option to remove (or adjust) these\n   properties as the data
    is imported into their calendar system.\n   This specification changes the recommendations
    on how \"UID\" property\n   values are constructed to minimize leaking any information
    that might\n   be security sensitive.\n   Security considerations in [RFC5545]
    and [RFC5546] MUST also be\n   adhered to.\n"

  - "8.  Privacy Considerations\n   Several of the new properties or parameters defined
    by this\n   specification allow reference to \"external\" URIs.  Access to those\n
    \  URIs could be tracked, leading to loss of privacy.  Clients SHOULD\n   ensure
    that suitable permission is granted by calendar users before\n   such URIs are
    dereferenced.  In particular, calendar publishers\n   wishing to help protect
    the privacy of their subscribers MUST use\n   HTTP with Transport Layer Security
    [RFC7230] (\"https:\" URIs instead\n   of \"http:\" URIs) for access to calendar
    data or ancillary data such\n   as images.\n   In general, for their own privacy
    protection, users have to rely on\n   the privacy policies of any conferencing
    system being accessed via\n   the \"CONFERENCE\" property.  It is entirely possible
    for such systems\n   to uniquely identify and log the activity and participation
    (or lack\n   thereof) of calendar users in the conference.  Calendar user agents\n
    \  SHOULD track which conferencing systems are used and warn users the\n   first
    time a new one is about to be used.  This is particularly\n   important if the
    client automatically \"dials in\" to the conference\n   when the event start time
    occurs.\n   By giving different calendar users different values for the \"REFRESH-\n
    \  INTERVAL\" property, it is possible for a publisher of calendar data\n   to
    uniquely identify each refresh from each calendar users' clients\n   and thereby
    track user activity and IP address over time.  To address\n   this, clients SHOULD
    add or subtract some random amount of time from\n   the published \"REFRESH-INTERVAL\"
    value when doing actual refreshes.\n   This specification changes the recommendations
    on how \"UID\" property\n   values are constructed to minimize leaking any information
    that might\n   be privacy sensitive.\n   Privacy considerations in [RFC5545] and
    [RFC5546] MUST also be\n   adhered to.\n"
