Abstract This memo defines two MIB modules and corresponding MIB Object Definitions that describe how label switching controlled Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM) interfaces can be managed given the interface stacking as defined in the MPLS LSR STD MIB and MPLS TE STD MIB.
This memo defines how label switching controlled Frame Relay [RFC3034] and ATM [RFC3035] interfaces can be realized given the interface stacking as defined in the MPLS LSR STD [RFC3813] and MPLS TE STD [RFC3812] MIBs.
This document also contains a MIB module that sparsely extends the MPLS LSR STD MIB's mplsInterfaceConfTable in such a way as to identify which MPLS type interfaces have LC ATM or LC FR capabilities.
Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at mpls@uu.net.
This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS architecture [RFC3031], as well as from RFC 3035 and RFC 3034.
Specifically, the following terms will be used in this document.
C FR  RFC 3034 defines a label switching controlled Frame Relay (LC FR) interface.
Packets traversing such an interface carry labels in the DLCI field C ATM RFC 3035 defines a label switching controlled ATM (LC ATM) interface as an ATM interface controlled by the label switching control component.
When a packet traversing such an interface is received, it is treated as a labeled packet.
The packet's top label is inferred from either the contents of the Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI) field or the combined contents of the Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) and VCI fields.
Any two LDP peers that are connected via an LC ATM interface will use LDP negotiations to determine which of these cases is applicable to that interface.
Static configuration of labels is also possible.
When LDP is used to distribute labels for use on label controlled interfaces, label configuration information may be available in the MPLS LDP ATM STD MIB [RFC3815] when LC ATM interfaces are used, or the MPLS LDP FRAME RELAY STD MIB [RFC3815]
when LC FR interfaces are used.
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
4.  Interface Stacking of LC ATM
[RFC2863] can carry labeled MPLS traffic, they too are considered MPLS subinterfaces with ifType   mpls(166).
They differ slightly in their capability from a packet oriented MPLS interface in that they may carry ATM  or Frame Relay encapsulated traffic.
It is thus beneficial to identify them as such.
To do this, two tables are defined that extend
the MPLS LSR STD MIB's mplsInterfaceTable (see section 5 for LC ATM or section 6 for LC FR).
Structure of the MPLS LC ATM STD MIB Module
The MPLS LC ATM STD MIB module is structured simply as a table of entries that sparsely extend those found in the interfaces table.
In particular, the entries in the mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable extend interfaces capable of supporting MPLS, as is defined in [RFC3813], to include entries that also support LC ATM (and their unique attributes).
Therefore, the module can be visualized as follows.
Note that the ifTable comes from [RFC2863], the mplsInterfaceTable from [RFC3813], and the mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable from the MPLS LC ATM STD MIB module described below.
In the example shown above, five interfaces exist on the device in question.
Of those interfaces, those with ifIndex   .2
and .4 are of ifType
indicating that they are capable of MPLS.
Of those two, the entry with index .4 is capable of MPLS LC ATM operations.
Note that the label partition model utilized by the authors of this document reflects widespread implementation and is seen by the MPLS working group as sufficiently flexible to meet the operational needs, even if it is more restrictive than [RFC3035] allows.
To this end, we have limited the control and unlabeled VPI and VCI to single values.
Note that mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVci and mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVci MUST not be equal; nor should mplsLcAtmStdCtrlVpi or mplsLcAtmStdUnlabTrafVpi be equal.
Structure of the MPLS LC FR STD MIB Module
The MPLS LC FR STD MIB module is structured simply as a table of entries that sparsely extend those found in the interfaces table.
In particular, the entries in the mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable extend interfaces capable of supporting MPLS, as is defined in [RFC3813], to include entries that also support LC Frame Relay (and their unique attributes).
Therefore, the module can be visualized as follows.
Note that the ifTable comes from [RFC2863], the mplsInterfaceTable from [RFC3813], and the mplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable from the MPLS LC FR STD MIB module described below.
In the example shown above, five interfaces exist on the device in question.
Of those interfaces, those with ifIndex   .2
and .4 are of ifType
indicating that they are capable of MPLS.
Of those two, the entry with index .4 is capable of MPLS LC Frame Relay operations.
Note that even though the architecture as described in [RFC3034] calls for supporting mixed labeled and unlabeled traffic, this MIB does not support that, as this capability does not seem to be used operationally.
Note that the DLCI ranges represented by mplsLcFrStdTrafficMinDlci to mplsLcFrStdTrafficMaxDlci and mplsLcFrStdCtrlMinDlci to mplsLcFrStdCtrlMaxDlci MUST not overlap.

"This is the VPI value used for indirectly connected LC ATM interfaces.
For these interfaces, the VPI field is not available to MPLS, and the label MUST be encoded entirely within the VCI field (see [RFC3035]).
If the interface is directly connected, this value MUST be set to zero.
"This object is used to create and delete entries in this table.

If a manager attempts to create an entry for a corresponding mplsInterfaceConfEntry that does not support LC ATM, the agent MUST return an inconsistentValue error.
If this table is implemented read only, then the agent must set this object to active(1) when this row is made active.

current DESCRIPTION "Collection of objects needed for MPLS LC FR interface configuration."
It is clear that these MIB modules are potentially useful for monitoring MPLS LSRs supporting LC ATM and/or LC FR.
These MIBs can also be used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
the MplsLcAtmStdInterfaceConfTable and mplsLcFrStdInterfaceConfTable collectively contain objects that may be used to provision MPLS
LC or FR enabled interfaces.
Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result in disruption of traffic on the network.
This is especially true if traffic has been established over these interfaces.
The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where possible.
Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any v3 agent that implements this MIB module.
Administrators should consider whether read access to these objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable under certain circumstances.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
collectively show the LC ATM and/or LC FR interfaces, their associated configurations, and their linkages to other MPLS related configuration and/or performance statistics.
Administrators not wishing to reveal this information should consider these objects sensitive/vulnerable and take precautions so they are not revealed.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
As described in and as requested in the MPLS TC STD MIB [RFC3811], MPLS related standards track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
There are 2 MPLS MIB modules contained in this document; each of the following "IANA Considerations" subsections requested from IANA a new assignment under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
New assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].
The IANA has assigned { mplsStdMIB 9 } to the MPLS LC ATM STD MIB module specified in this document.
IANA Considerations for MPLS LC FR STD MIB
The IANA has assigned { mplsStdMIB 10 } to the MPLS LC FR STD MIB module specified in this document.
