  - "1.  Introduction\n   A significant part of today's Internet traffic is generated\
    \ by peer-\n   to-peer (P2P) applications, used originally for file sharing, and\n\
    \   more recently for real-time multimedia communications and live media\n   streaming.\
    \  P2P applications pose serious challenges to the Internet\n   infrastructure;\
    \ by some estimates, P2P systems are so popular that\n   they make up anywhere\
    \ between 40% and 85% of the entire Internet\n   traffic [Karagiannis], [LightReading],\
    \ [LinuxReviews], [Parker],\n   [Glasner].\n   P2P systems ensure that popular\
    \ content is replicated at multiple\n   instances in the overlay.  But perhaps\
    \ ironically, a peer searching\n   for that content may ignore the topology of\
    \ the latent overlay\n   network and instead select among available instances\
    \ based on\n   information it deduces from empirical measurements, which in some\n\
    \   particular situations may lead to suboptimal choices.  For example, a\n  \
    \ shorter round-trip time estimation is not indicative of the bandwidth\n   and\
    \ reliability of the underlying links, which have more of an\n   influence than\
    \ delay for large file transfer P2P applications.\n   Most Distributed Hash Tables\
    \ (DHT) -- the data structures that impose\n   a specific ordering for P2P overlays\
    \ -- use greedy forwarding\n   algorithms to reach their destination, making locally\
    \ optimal\n   decisions that may not turn out to be globally optimized [Gummadi].\n\
    \   This naturally leads to the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization\n   (ALTO)\
    \ problem [RFC5693]: how to best provide the topology of the\n   underlying network\
    \ while at the same time allowing the requesting\n   node to use such information\
    \ to effectively reach the node on which\n   the content resides.  Thus, it would\
    \ appear that P2P networks with\n   their application-layer routing strategies\
    \ based on overlay\n   topologies are in direct competition against the Internet\
    \ routing and\n   topology.\n   One way to solve the ALTO problem is to build\
    \ distributed\n   application-level services for location and path selection [Francis],\n\
    \   [Ng], [Dabek], [Costa], [Wong], [Madhyastha] in order to enable peers\n  \
    \ to estimate their position in the network and to efficiently select\n   their\
    \ neighbors.  Similar solutions have been embedded into P2P\n   applications such\
    \ as Vuze [Vuze].  A slightly different approach is\n   to have the Internet service\
    \ provider (ISP) take a proactive role in\n   the routing of P2P application traffic;\
    \ the means by which this can\n   be achieved have been proposed [Aggarwal], [Xie],\
    \ [Saucez].  There is\n   an intrinsic struggle between the layers -- P2P overlay\
    \ and network\n   underlay -- when performing the same service (routing); however,\n\
    \   there are strategies to mitigate this dichotomy [Seetharaman].\n   This document,\
    \ initially intended as a complement to RFC 5693\n   [RFC5693] and discussed during\
    \ the creation of the IETF ALTO Working\n   Group, has been completed and refined\
    \ in the IRTF P2P Research Group.\n   Its goal is to summarize the contemporary\
    \ research activities on the\n   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization problem\
    \ as input to the ALTO\n   working group protocol designers.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Application-Level Topology Estimation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Application-Level Topology Estimation\n   Estimating network topology information\
    \ on the application layer has\n   been an area of active research.  Early systems\
    \ used triangulation\n   techniques to bound the distance between two hosts using\
    \ a common\n   landmark host.  In such a technique, given a cost function C, a\
    \ set\n   of vertexes V and their corresponding edges, the triangle inequality\n\
    \   holds if for any triple {a, b, c} in V, C(a, c) is always less than\n   or\
    \ equal to C(a, g) + C(b, c).  The cost function C could be\n   expressed in terms\
    \ of desirable metrics such as bandwidth or latency.\n   We note that the techniques\
    \ presented in this section are only\n   representative of the sizable research\
    \ in this area.  Rather than\n   trying to enumerate an exhaustive list, we have\
    \ chosen certain\n   techniques because they represent an advance in the area\
    \ that further\n   led to derivative works.\n   Francis et al. proposed IDMaps\
    \ [Francis], a system where one or more\n   special hosts called tracers are deployed\
    \ near an autonomous system.\n   The distance measured in round-trip time (RTT)\
    \ between hosts A and B\n   is estimated as the cumulative distance between A\
    \ and its nearest\n   tracer Ta, plus the distance between B and its nearest tracer\
    \ Tb,\n   plus the shortest distance from Ta to Tb.  To aid in scalability\n \
    \  beyond that provided by the client-server design of IDMaps, Ng\n   et al. proposed\
    \ a P2P-based Global Network Positioning (GNP)\n   architecture [Ng].  GNP was\
    \ a network coordinate system based on\n   absolute coordinates computed from\
    \ modeling the Internet as a\n   geometric space.  It proposed a two-part architecture:\
    \ in the first\n   part, a small set of finite distributed hosts called landmarks\n\
    \   compute their own coordinates in a fixed geometric space.  In the\n   second\
    \ part, a host wishing to participate computes its own\n   coordinates relative\
    \ to those of the landmark hosts.  Thus, armed\n   with the computed coordinates,\
    \ hosts can then determine interhost\n   distance as soon as they discover each\
    \ other.\n   Both IDMaps and GNP require fixed network infrastructure support\
    \ in\n   the form of tracers or landmark hosts; this often introduces a single\n\
    \   point of failure and inhibits scalability.  To combat this, new\n   techniques\
    \ were developed that embedded the network topology in a\n   low-dimensional coordinate\
    \ space to enable network distance\n   estimation through vector analysis.  Costa\
    \ et al. introduced\n   Practical Internet Coordinates (PIC) [Costa].  While PIC\
    \ used the\n   notion of landmark hosts, it did not require explicit network support\n\
    \   to designate specific landmark hosts.  Any node whose coordinates\n   have\
    \ been computed could act as a landmark host.  When a node joined\n   the system,\
    \ it probed the network distance to some landmark hosts.\n   Then, it obtained\
    \ the coordinates of each landmark host and computed\n   its own coordinates relative\
    \ to each landmark host, subject to the\n   constraint of minimizing the error\
    \ in the predicted distance and\n   computed distance.\n   Like PIC, Vivaldi [Dabek]\
    \ proposed a fully distributed network\n   coordinate system without any distinguished\
    \ hosts.  Whenever a node A\n   communicates with another node B, it measures\
    \ the RTT to that node\n   and learns that node's current coordinates.  Node A\
    \ subsequently\n   adjusts its coordinates such that it is closer to, or further\
    \ from, B\n   by computing new coordinates that minimize the squared error.  A\n\
    \   Vivaldi node is thus constantly adjusting its position based on a\n   simulation\
    \ of interconnected mass springs.  Vivaldi is now being used\n   in the popular\
    \ P2P application Vuze, and studies indicate that it\n   scales well to very large\
    \ networks [Ledlie].\n   Network coordinate systems require the embedding of the\
    \ Internet\n   topology into a coordinate system.  This is not always possible\n\
    \   without errors, which impacts the accuracy of distance estimations.\n   In\
    \ particular, it has proved to be difficult to embed the triangular\n   inequalities\
    \ found in Internet path distances [Ledlie].  Thus,\n   Meridian [Wong] abandons\
    \ the generality of network coordinate systems\n   and provides specific distance\
    \ evaluation services.  In Meridian,\n   each node keeps track of a small fixed\
    \ number of neighbors and\n   organizes them in concentric rings, ordered by distance\
    \ from the\n   node.  Meridian locates the closest node by performing a multi-hop\n\
    \   search where each hop exponentially reduces the distance to the\n   target.\
    \  Although less general than virtual coordinates, Meridian\n   incurs significantly\
    \ less error for closest node discovery.\n   The Ono project [Ono] takes a different\
    \ approach and uses network\n   measurements from Content Distribution Networks\
    \ (CDNs) such as Akamai\n   to find nearby peers.  Used as a plugin to the Vuze\
    \ bittorrent\n   client, Ono provides 31% average download rate improvement [Su].\n\

    \  Table 1\n   Table 1 summarizes the application-level topology estimation\n\
    \   techniques.  The salient performance metric is the relative error.\n   While\
    \ all approaches define this metric a bit differently, it can be\n   generalized\
    \ as how close a predicted distance comes to the\n   corresponding measured distance.\
    \  A value of zero implies perfect\n   prediction, and a value of 1 implies that\
    \ the predicted distance is\n   in error by a factor of two.  PIC, Vivaldi, and\
    \ Meridian compare\n   their results with that of GNP, while GNP itself compares\
    \ its results\n   with a precursor technique, IDMaps.  Because each of the techniques\n\
    \   uses a different Internet topology and a varying number of landmarks\n   and\
    \ dimensions to interpret the data set, it is impossible to\n   normalize the\
    \ relative error across all techniques uniformly.  Thus,\n   we present the relative\
    \ error data in pairs, as reported in the\n   literature describing the specific\
    \ technique.  Readers are urged to\n   compare the relative error performance\
    \ in each column on its own and\n   not draw any conclusions by comparing the\
    \ data across columns.\n   Most of the work on estimating topology information\
    \ focuses on\n   predicting network distance in terms of latency and does not\
    \ provide\n   estimates for other metrics such as throughput or packet loss rate.\n\
    \   However, for many P2P applications latency is not the most important\n   performance\
    \ metric, and these applications could benefit from a\n   richer information plane.\
    \  Sophisticated methods of active network\n   probing and passive traffic monitoring\
    \ are generally very powerful\n   and can generate network statistics indirectly\
    \ related to performance\n   measures of interest, such as delay and loss rate\
    \ on link-level\n   granularity.  Extraction of these hidden attributes can be\
    \ achieved\n   by applying statistical inference techniques developed in the field\n\
    \   of inferential network monitoring or network tomography subsequent to\n  \
    \ sampling of the network state.  Thus, network tomography enables the\n   extraction\
    \ of a richer set of topology information, but at the same\n   time inherently\
    \ increases complexity of a potential information plane\n   and introduces estimation\
    \ errors.  For both active and passive\n   methods, statistical models for the\
    \ measurement process need to be\n   developed, and the spatial and temporal dependence\
    \ of the\n   measurements should be assessed.  Moreover, measurement methodology\n\
    \   and statistical inference strategy must be considered jointly.  For a\n  \
    \ deeper discussion of network tomography and recent developments in\n   the field,\
    \ we refer the reader to [Coates].\n   One system providing such a service is\
    \ iPlane [Madhyastha], which\n   aims at creating an annotated atlas of the Internet\
    \ that contains\n   information about latency, bandwidth, capacity, and loss rate.\
    \  To\n   determine features of the Internet topology, iPlane bridges and\n  \
    \ builds upon different ideas, such as active probing based on packet\n   dispersion\
    \ techniques to infer available bandwidth along path\n   segments.  These ideas\
    \ are drawn from different fields, including\n   network measurement as described\
    \ by Dovrolis et al. in [Dovrolis] and\n   network tomography [Coates].\n"

  - "2.2.2.  Oracle-Based ISP-P2P Collaboration\n   In the general solution proposed\
    \ by Aggarwal et al. [Aggarwal],\n   network providers offer host servers, called\
    \ \"oracles\", that help P2P\n   users choose optimal neighbors.\n   The oracle\
    \ concept uses the following mechanism: a P2P client sends\n   the list of potential\
    \ peers to the oracle hosted by its ISP and\n   receives a re-arranged peer list,\
    \ ordered according to the ISP's\n   local routing policies and preferences. \
    \ For instance, to keep the\n   traffic local, the ISP may prefer peers within\
    \ its network, or it may\n   pick links with higher bandwidth or peers that are\
    \ geographically\n   closer to improve application performance.  Once the client\
    \ has\n   obtained this ordered list, it has enough information to perform\n \
    \  better-than-random initial peer selection.\n   Such a solution has been evaluated\
    \ with simulations and experiments\n   run on the PlanetLab testbed, and the results\
    \ show both improvements\n   in content download time and a reduction of overall\

  contents:
  - "3.  Application-Level Topology Estimation and the ALTO Problem\n   The application-level\
    \ techniques described in Section 2.1 provide\n   tools for peer-to-peer applications\
    \ to estimate parameters of the\n   underlying network topology.  Although these\
    \ techniques can improve\n   application performance, there are limitations of\
    \ what can be\n   achieved by operating only on the application level.\n   Topology\
    \ estimation techniques use abstractions of the network\n   topology, which often\
    \ hide features that would be of interest to the\n   application.  Network coordinate\
    \ systems, for example, are unable to\n   detect overlay paths shorter than the\
    \ direct path in the Internet\n   topology.  However, these paths frequently exist\
    \ in the Internet\n   [Wang].  Similarly, application-level techniques may not\
    \ accurately\n   estimate topologies with multipath routing.\n   When using network\
    \ coordinates to estimate topology information, the\n   underlying assumption\
    \ is that distance in terms of latency determines\n   performance.  However, for\
    \ file sharing and content distribution\n   applications, there is more to performance\
    \ than just the network\n   latency between nodes.  The utility of a long-lived\
    \ data transfer is\n   determined by the throughput of the underlying TCP protocol,\
    \ which\n   depends on the round-trip time as well as the loss rate experienced\n\
    \   on the corresponding path [Padhye].  Hence, these applications\n   benefit\
    \ from a richer set of topology information that goes beyond\n   latency, including\
    \ loss rate, capacity, and available bandwidth.\n   Some of the topology estimation\
    \ techniques used by P2P applications\n   need time to converge to a result. \
    \ For example, current BitTorrent\n   clients implement local, passive traffic\
    \ measurements and a tit-for-\n   tat bandwidth reciprocity mechanism to optimize\
    \ peer selection at a\n   local level.  Peers eventually settle on a set of neighbors\
    \ that\n   maximizes their download rate, but because peers cannot reason about\n\
    \   the value of neighbors without actively exchanging data with them,\n   and\
    \ because the number of concurrent data transfers is limited\n   (typically to\
    \ 5-7), convergence is delayed and easily can be\n   sub-optimal.\n   Skype's\
    \ P2P Voice over IP (VoIP) application chooses a relay node in\n   cases where\
    \ two peers are behind NATs and cannot connect directly.\n   Measurements taken\
    \ by Ren et al. [Ren] showed that the relay\n   selection mechanism of Skype (1)\
    \ is not able to discover the best\n   possible relay nodes in terms of minimum\
    \ RTT, (2) requires a long\n   setup and stabilization time, which degrades the\
    \ end user experience,\n   and (3) is creating a non-negligible amount of overhead\
    \ traffic due\n   to probing a large number of nodes.  They further showed that\
    \ the\n   quality of the relay paths could be improved when the underlying\n \
    \  network Autonomous System (AS) topology is considered.\n   Some features of\
    \ the network topology are hard to infer through\n   application-level techniques,\
    \ and it may not be possible to infer\n   them at all, e.g., service-provider\
    \ policies and preferences such as\n   the state and cost associated with interdomain\
    \ peering and transit\n   links.  Another example is the traffic engineering policy\
    \ of a\n   service provider, which may counteract the routing objective of the\n\
    \   overlay network, leading to a poor overall performance [Seetharaman].\n  \
    \ Finally, application-level techniques often require applications to\n   perform\
    \ measurements on the topology.  These measurements create\n   traffic overhead,\
    \ in particular, if measurements are performed\n   individually by all applications\
    \ interested in estimating topology.\n"
